<text>Bosanska Krajina (, , ) is a geographical region, a subregion of Bosnia, in western Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is enclosed by several rivers, namely the Sava (north), Glina (northwest), Vrbanja and Vrbas (east and southeast, respectively). The region is also a historic, economic, and cultural entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina, noted for its preserved nature and wildlife diversity.

The largest city and historical center of the region is Banja Luka. Other cities and towns include Bihać, Bosanska Krupa, Bosanski Petrovac, Čelinac, Bosansko Grahovo, Bužim, Cazin, Drvar, Gradiška, Ključ, Kostajnica, Kozarska Dubica, Kneževo, Kotor Varoš, Laktaši, Mrkonjić Grad, Novi Grad, Prijedor, Sanski Most, Šipovo, Velika Kladuša, Teslić, and Prnjavor.
Bosanska Krajina has no formal status; however, it has a significant cultural and historical identity that was formed through several historic and economic events. The territory of Bosanska Krajina is currently divided between Republika Srpska and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

==Naming==
During the Medieval Bosnia period, the region of Bosanska Krajina was known as Donji Kraji () and Zapadne Strane (). After the downfall of the Kingdom of Bosnia and subsequent Ottoman conquest of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1463, which contributed to the Ottoman territorial expansion into the western Balkans in a series of wars, the region between the Una and Vrbas rivers became known as &quot;Krajina&quot; () or &quot;Bosanska Krajina&quot; (). The first recorded usage of the name &quot;Bosanska Krajina&quot; is in 1594. Also, for the same territory, the exonym &quot;Turkish Croatia&quot; appeared in German speaking Austria-Hungary in the first decades of the 18th century, and was first used in maps created by the &quot;Austro-Hungarian — Ottoman Border Commission&quot;, which was mandated by the peace treaty of Karlowitz (1699), and then the peace treaty of Passarowitz (1718), and consisted exclusively of Austrians&#x27; and Venetians&#x27; military cartographers, and one Croat (Vitezović). In the mid-19th century the term &quot;Turkish Croatia&quot;, used in some Austrian maps for the Western Balkans, was replaced in favor of region&#x27;s common name, &quot;Bosanska Krajina&quot;.

==Geography==
Sub-regions (geographical and historical) include: Bihaćka krajina, Cazinska krajina, Potkozarje, Lijevče, etc.

== History ==

===Middle Ages===
In the 6th century, today&#x27;s northwestern Bosnia was part of the Roman province of Dalmatia. It fell under the jurisdiction of the Eastern Roman Empire. Shortly thereafter, Eurasian Avars and their Slavic subjects from central-eastern Europe invaded Dalmatia and settled in what is now Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the 7th century, the Serbs and Croats formed principalities initially under the Eastern Roman Empire. The region was part of the Duchy of Croatia in the Early Middle Ages. which later became part of the Kingdom of Croatia under Tomislav I.

Archaeological data show that medieval cemeteries of northwestern Bosnia clearly indicate that from the first half of the 10th century this territory was under the political rule of Tomislav I. Northern parts of these territories were ruled by the Slavonian Banate (parishes of Sana, Vrbas, and Dubica, while Lower Pounje was part of the parish of Zagreb) as lower Slavonia, where the parish of Sana served as seat of Babonić family, and later the Blagaj family, and southern were parts were the parishes of Pset and Pliva. In the 13th and 14th century, a region called &quot;Donji Kraji&quot; (parish of Pliva), located in today&#x27;s southern Bosanska Krajina developed, and was first mentioned as a property of the Diocese of Bosnia and claimed by the Bosnian Banate.

By the end of the 14th century, the Ottoman Empire had significantly expanded into the western Balkans in a series of wars, and the Turkish westward incursions eventually made this region an Ottoman borderland. Jajce had fallen to the Ottoman Turks in 1463, marking the downfall of the Kingdom of Bosnia, although was later taken from the Ottoman Turks and organized as defensive Banate of Jajce. The Battle of Krbava Field in 1493 effectively ended the Kingdom of Hungary&#x27;s persistent hold over the entire region, restricting them to fortified cities, and when Jajce fell again in 1528, Ottoman rule persisted almost until the end of the 19th century.

In the late 15th century, a local Croatian lord (&quot;knez&quot;), Juraj Mikuličić, erected a fort in the village of Bužim near Bihać, fearing the advancing Ottoman army. Mikuličić died in 1495, but the Bužim fort would not pass to Ottoman control until 1576. Bosanska Krajina was the last region in Bosnia to fall to the Ottoman Empire; the last city to fall was Bihać in 1592, which eventually paved the way for the Islamization of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

===Ottoman period===
After the crucial 1526 Battle of Mohács and the 1527 election in Cetin, Croatia became part of the Austrian Habsburg Empire. The Ottoman Empire formally established the Eyalet of Bosnia in 1580. The Croatian lands in general were reduced to a fraction of what they encompassed, and only the westernmost parts of today&#x27;s Bosanska Krajina still resisted the Ottoman rule. Nevertheless, the Ottoman armies preferred to advance towards their targets in the northwest through more easily passable terrain, such as along the river Danube, for example Vienna was first besieged in 1529 after the army had gone through Osijek, Mohács, and Buda. The natural obstacles in and around the region, especially at the time, included the rivers Sava, Vrbas, Una and Sana, as well as the mountains such as Plješevica, Šator, Klekovača, Raduša, Grmeč, Kozara, and Vlašić.

Turkish incursions expanded further to the north, and Charles of Styria erected a new fortified city of Karlovac in 1579. In 1580, the Ottoman Turks responded by declaring the Pashaluk of Bosnia which unified all the Sanjaks, including territory in modern-day Croatia. As a result of the wars and border changes, the Catholic Croat population moved north, and was replaced with Orthodox Serbs.

The Bužim fort, under Ottoman control since 1576, was successfully held by the Ottoman Turks in numerous battles (1685, 1686, 1688, 1737) and it was also upgraded (1626, 1834) until their eventual surrender in the 19th century. The building remains to this day as a monument to the Ottoman conquest of Bosnia. Bihać held out longer than Bužim; it was a free royal city and at one time the capital of the Kingdom of Croatia (metropolis et propugnaculum totius regni Croatiae). But, in 1592 the Turkish army of about 20,000 under Hasan Predojević, an Ottoman vizier, attacked and forcefully occupied Bihać.

When the Ottoman Empire lost the War of the Holy League (1683–1690) to the Habsburg monarchy and her allies, and ceded Slavonia and Hungary to Austria at the 1699 Treaty of Karlowitz, the northern and western borders of the Sanjak of Bosnia (corresponding largely to the current borders of the modern Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina), became a permanent frontier between the Austrian and Ottoman empires.

===19th century===
In mid-1858, an uprising known as Pecija&#x27;s First Revolt broke out in the region, resulting from Ottoman pressure against the local Serb populace. It was crushed by December. The Bosnian Frontier, like the rest of Bosnia and Herzegovina, participated in the Herzegovina Uprising against the Ottoman Empire (1875–1878).

===World War II===

During World War II, Bosanska Krajina was known for its very strong resistance to the Fascist regime of the Independent State of Croatia. The local Serb population in Bosanska Krajina was targeted in the Genocide of Serbs in the Independent State of Croatia by the regime&#x27;s Croat and Bosniak bands, serving as an overture to future conflicts at the end of the 20th century. The anti-fascist Yugoslav Partisan movement in the Bosanska Krajina region was more ethnically diverse than in any other part of former Yugoslavia during World War II. In the winter of 1942–1943, the Yugoslav Partisans established the Republic of Bihać in Bosanska Krajina. Soon afterwards, Bosanska Krajina was also the place of historical agreements that have taken place in Jajce and Mrkonjić Grad in 1943, ones that established the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina in its current borders, as well as the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

===Bosnian War===
During the 1992-95 Bosnian War, Bosanska Krajina was divided between Republika Srpska, the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia. The Serb entity of SAO Bosanska Krajina was established in summer 1991. The region was also a place of concentration camps, including Manjača and Omarska where Bosniaks were held, tortured, raped, and killed.

==Demography==
The population of the region numbered almost one million before the Bosnian War. The composition of the current population of Bosanska Krajina has dramatically changed, because of expulsions, forced relocation and emigration during the Bosnian war in 1992–95.

==Economics==
In the immediate aftermath of World War II Bosanska Krajina was considered one of the poorest regions of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This poverty was a contributing factor to 1950 Cazin Uprising against the communist government, the only such uprising in post-war Bosnia and Herzegovina and Yugoslavia.

The later economic boom and prosperity of Bosanska Krajina was mostly due to planned urban development programs that were created specifically for this region in early and mid-1970s by Urban Institute in Banja Luka. The development was further stimulated by the simplification of the banking system that encouraged investments in resource processing industry. As a result, the region has seen a boom in agricultural and industrial production.

Agrokomerc, a food manufacturing industry located in northwest region was the largest food manufacturer in Bosnia and Herzegovina and former Yugoslavia. Other industries included chemical industry Saniteks in Velika Kladuša, electronics industry Rudi Cajevec in Banja Luka, Textile industry Sana in Bosanski Novi as well as a range of wood and food processing companies that stimulated an economic boom in this region. There was also a significant ore industry developed around the Kozara Mountain.

==Transport and aviation==
The expressway E-661 (locally known as M-16) leads north to Croatia, existing as an expressway from Banja Luka to Laktaši and as a two-lane road from Laktaši to the Bosnian/Croatian border. This second section of the road is currently being upgraded to an expressway.

Under planning is two new expressways. One from Prijedor to Bosanska Dubica to shorten the travelling time to Zagreb. The other one is to the east heading towards Doboj and connecting Bosanska Krajina to the important Corridor Vc in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Banja Luka International Airport is located 23 km from Banja Luka.
There are two airlines currently, B&amp;H Airlines and Adria Airways, with regular flights to Ljubljana (four times weekly) and Zürich (three times weekly). Charter flights also operate from the airport, and the airport can be used as a back-up to Sarajevo Airport. Zagreb Airport, due to weather conditions in winter often preferable to Sarajevo, is approximately two hours away from Banja Luka by car.

Željava Air Base, situated on the border between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina under Plješevica Mountain, near the town of Bihać in Bosnia and Herzegovina, was the largest underground airport and military airbase in the former Yugoslavia and one of the largest in Europe.

Prijedor also has an airfield in the north-eastern part of the city in the area of Urije. The airfield has a fleet of light aircraft and sailplanes. The airfield was used by the Yugoslav partisans and was the first operative partisan airfield during World War II. The airfield also serves as the home of the city&#x27;s renovated Parachuting club.

Bosanska Krajina is the hub of the railway services in Bosnia and Herzegovina, comprising more than one-half of the railway network of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Services operate to the northern and western Bosnian towns Banja Luka, Prijedor, Bosanski Novi and Bihać. The rail network also operates to Zagreb (twice daily), and Belgrade.

<text>The Utah Symphony is an American orchestra based in Salt Lake City, Utah. The orchestra&#x27;s principal venue is Abravanel Hall. In addition to its Salt Lake City subscription concerts, the orchestra travels around the Intermountain West serving communities throughout Utah. The orchestra accompanies the Utah Opera in four productions per year at Salt Lake&#x27;s Capitol Theatre. In addition, the Utah Symphony and Utah Opera have a summer residency at the Deer Valley Music Festival, located in Park City, Utah. The orchestra receives funding from the Utah State Legislature for educational concerts. The Symphony has a division in Utah Valley that is based out of the Noorda Center for the Performing Arts at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah.

==History==
The first attempt to create a symphony orchestra in the Utah area occurred in 1892, four years before Utah achieved statehood. The Salt Lake Symphony (not to be confused with the modern Salt Lake Symphony) was created and presented just one concert before disbanding. In 1902, the Salt Lake Symphony Orchestra was formed, and it remained in existence until 1911. In 1913, the Salt Lake Philharmonic was formed, and it continued until 1925.

The organization of a symphony with &quot;Utah&quot; in its name started during the Great Depression as part of the Federal Music Project, an employment-assistance program which formed part of Federal Project Number One (which in turn was an arm of the Works Project Administration). The Project hired Reginald Beales to create a musical group in Utah. He formed the Utah State Sinfonietta with a core of 5 members. That group grew rapidly and toured extensively, presenting concerts throughout Utah.

By 1940, federal funding for arts projects had ceased, so local enthusiasts formed the Utah State Symphony Orchestra on April 4, 1940, with Fred E. Smith as president. They scheduled their first concert for May 8, 1940 and asked Hans Henriot to conduct it. The resulting concert was so successful that the group offered Henriot a contract to direct the orchestra. This ensemble grew to 52 part-time musicians.

In 1947, Maurice Abravanel became the orchestra&#x27;s music director. He built the ensemble into a full-time orchestra and developed its wider national reputation. He recorded and toured extensively with the orchestra. Under Abravanel, the orchestra first recorded with Vanguard Records and then with Vox Records. including complete symphony cycles of Mahler and of Tchaikovsky, as well as works by Varese, Milhaud, Gottschalk, Honegger, and Satie. The Utah Symphony’s recordings of Mahler’s symphonies with Abravanel were the first complete cycle recorded by an American orchestra (Vanguard). Honors for Abravanel&#x27;s Mahler recordings with the orchestra include the “Mahler Medal of Honor” from the Bruckner Society of America (1965) and the International Gustav Mahler Society award for “Best Mahler Recording” (Fifth Symphony, 1975). During Abravanel’s tenure, the Orchestra’s music education program grew into one of the most extensive arts education programs in the region. Educational concerts were given on orchestra tours across the Intermountain West and at home in the Salt Lake Valley. Abravanel concluded his tenure as music director in 1979. That same year, it left its longtime home at the Mormon Tabernacle and moved into Symphony Hall (renamed Abravanel Hall in 1993), its first dedicated concert venue.

The Orchestra’s season grew to a year-round schedule by 1980. Successors to Abravanel included Varujan Kojian (1980–1983), Joseph Silverstein (1983–1998), and Keith Lockhart (1998–2009). Under Silverstein and Lockhart, the orchestra continued its commitment to contemporary American music. In July 2002, the governing boards of Utah Symphony and Utah Opera decided to consolidate both organizations, resulting in the formation of &quot;Utah Symphony | Utah Opera&quot;. At the time of the merger, it was one of only two merged symphony and opera companies in the United States.

In September 2009, Thierry Fischer became the orchestra&#x27;s music director. Contemporary works commissioned by the orchestra during Fischer&#x27;s tenure have included &quot;EOS (Goddess of the Dawn)&quot; by Augusta Read Thomas and the percussion concerto &quot;Switch&quot; by Andrew Norman. Fischer is currently contracted with the Utah Symphony through the 2021–2022 season. In May 2019, the orchestra announced that Fischer is to conclude his tenure as its music director at the end of his current contract, at the close of the 2021–2022 season. However, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, in October 2020, the orchestra announced a change to the scheduled conclusion of Fischer&#x27;s contract as its music director, through August 2023, to supersede the May 2019 announcement.

In January 2009, the orchestra named Gerald Steichen as its principal pops conductor. In 2017, Conner Gray Covington was appointed to the role of assistant conductor, and subsequently promoted to associate conductor. Covington remained with the orchestra until 2021. Benjamin Manis became the orchestra&#x27;s next associate conductor for the 2022-2023 season. Matthew Straw held the title of assistant conductor for the 2023-2024 season. The current assistant conductor of the orchestra is Jessica Rivero Altarriba.

David Robertson first guest-conducted the orchestra in October 2020. He returned for an additional guest-conducting engagement in December 2021. In December 2022, the orchestra announced the appointment of Robertson as its first-ever creative partner, effective with the 2023-2024 season, with a contract of 3 years.

In December 2022, Markus Poschner first guest-conducted the orchestra. He returned for a subsequent guest-conducting appearance in November 2023. In November 2024, the Utah Symphony announced the appointment of Poschner as its next music director, effective with the 2027-2028 season. Poschner took the title of music director-designate with immediate effect.

In May 2024, Delyana Lazarova first guest-conducted the orchestra. In December 2024, the orchestra announced the appointment of Lazarova as its next principal guest conductor, the first female conductor to be named to the post, effective with the 2025-2026 season, with an initial contract of two seasons.

<text>Raffaele &quot;Ralph&quot; DePalma (occasionally spelt De Palma, December 19, 1882 – March 31, 1956) was an American racing driver who won the 1915 Indianapolis 500. His entry at the International Motorsports Hall of Fame estimates that he won about 2,000 races. DePalma won the 1908, 1909, 1910, and 1911 American AAA national dirt track championships and is credited with winning 25 American Championship car races. He won the Canadian national championship in 1929. DePalma estimated that he had earned $1.5 million by 1934 after racing for 27 years. He is inducted in numerous halls of fame. He competed on boards and dirt road courses and ovals.

== Biography ==

Born in Biccari, Apulia, Italy, DePalma&#x27;s family, who was from the near Troia, emigrated to the United States in the early 1890s. As a young man he tried bicycle racing with mixed success, but at the age of twenty-two he began racing motorcycles before switching to the automobile dirt track racing circuit in 1909, the year that the American Automobile Association established the national driving championship.

DePalma was immediately successful in car racing. In 1911, DePalma won the first Milwaukee Mile Championship Car race. However, he is still remembered for the dramatic manner in which he lost the 1912 Indianapolis 500. After leading the race for 196 of the 200 laps, his Mercedes cracked a piston and with only 2 laps remaining; he and his mechanic had to push the car across the finish line to take eleventh place. At that time, only cars completing the full 200 laps received any prize money. This Mercedes remains on display at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame Museum.

He went on to perform strongly that year, but was almost killed in an accident on October 5 at the Grand Prize held in a road course in Milwaukee. After being impaled by a corn stalk, he was hospitalized for 11 weeks; he recovered and was back to racing the following spring.

In 1912 and again in 1914, DePalma won the Elgin Trophy at Elgin, Illinois and in 1914 he scored what he called his greatest victory when he beat Barney Oldfield to capture the Vanderbilt Cup on the roads of Santa Monica, California. He entered the 1914 Indianapolis 500 and qualified, but withdrew before the race claiming he felt his engine could not survive the race.
DePalma had been let go by the Mercer Automobile Co. racing team in favor of Barney Oldfield. In a Mercedes &quot;Gray Ghost,&quot; he showed he was a master tactician in beating Oldfield&#x27;s much faster car. He ended 1914 by winning his second U.S. national driving championship. The following year, 1915, he drove to victory at 1915 Indianapolis 500 with a Mercedes 4.5 liter GP car, but became the subject of much controversy the following May, when he held out for appearance money to drive in the 1916 edition of “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing,” which track owner, Carl G. Fisher refused, and DePalma did not run in the 500 race. All was forgiven by September, when the Indianapolis Motor Speedway held a special &quot;Harvest Classic&quot; event and an agreement was reached for the great driver to race one of the Speedway’s Peugeots. 

DePalma was an intense competitor but one of the most popular racers with his fellow drivers and the fans because of his good sportsmanship, a quality he displayed on and off the track. In June 1917 he lost to Barney Oldfield in a series of 10 to 25 mile match races at the Milwaukee Mile. On February 12, 1919, at Daytona Beach, Florida, he drove a Packard to a world speed record of over a measured mile (1.6 km). International competition began following the adoption of the three liter engine limit in the U.S. and Europe in 1920. DePalma began the year driving for the French manufacturer, Ballot. His Ballot vehicle won the pole position for the 1920 Indianapolis race and he led for many laps but bad luck dogged him in the race (faulty bearings on the Ballot) and he did not finish. However, DePalma did race his Ballot vehicle in the Elgin Road Race and won his third Elgin trophy in 1920. Then in 1921 DePalma traveled with other Americans to Le Mans to compete in the French Grand Prix. There, he finished second to the Duesenberg driven by fellow American, Jimmy Murphy. DePalma won the Canadian national championship in 1929.

In 1923, he established the DePalma Manufacturing Company in Detroit to build race cars and engines for automobiles and aircraft.

DePalma later competed in stock cars until he retired from racing in 1936. In his career, he competed in 2,889 races in America and Europe and won 2,557, according to his Associated Press obituary that appeared in the Detroit Free Press on April 1, 1956. He was an honorary referee for the Indianapolis 500, the last time in 1954.

== Death ==

DePalma died at his home in South Pasadena, California, from cancer on March 31, 1956, at age 73. He was interred in the Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California.

== Film appearances ==

DePalma had a small role in the 1920 Hollywood film &quot;High Speed&quot; and in 1924 played the part of the Champion in an action/drama film written by Wilfred Lucas titled &quot;Racing for Life&quot;. He also had a cameo in &quot;The Cool Hot Rod&quot; (1953).

== Family ==

DePalma is the brother of 500 competitor John DePalma and the maternal uncle of 1925 Indianapolis winner Peter DePaolo.

== Awards ==

*In 1973, he was made a posthumous member of the Automotive Hall of Fame in Dearborn, Michigan.
*In 1991, he was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame.
*He was named to the National Sprint Car Hall of Fame in 1991.

<doc id="1172899" wikidata="Q7142911" url="?curid=1172899" title="Past Mortem">
<text>Past Mortem is a detective novel by Ben Elton first published in 2004. It is about a serial killer on the loose in England, mainly in the London area, and Scotland Yard&#x27;s attempts at tracking him or her down. At the same time, &quot;Past Mortem&quot; raises a number of sociological, psychological and moral questions such as bullying, revenge, &quot;getting a life&quot; versus living in the past, domestic violence, and the changing market value of people as they get older. Apart from its serious aspects, the book also contains a lot of humour, especially when the respective private entanglements of Detective Inspector Edward Newson, the officer in charge of the police investigation, and his assistant, Detective Sergeant Natasha Wilkie, are described. However, as one critic put it, &quot;some of the descriptions of the sex scenes might prove a bit much for the faint-hearted&quot;.

==Plot summary==

When Adam Bishop, a middle-aged self-made man in the building trade, is cruelly murdered at his London home, Detective Inspector Ed Newson has a hunch that the crime has been committed by a psychopath who has killed before. He links up the new case with a number of older, unsolved ones, and a certain pattern emerges: It turns out that each victim was a bully many years ago when they went to school, and that they have now been killed in exactly the same way as they used to torture their peers. However, when Newson and Sergeant Natasha Wilkie talk to the former victims they soon find out that none of them could be the serial killer.

Although successful in his job, when it comes to his private life Edward Newson is a lonely, sex-starved man secretly in love with his assistant, Natasha. Now in his mid-thirties, he nostalgically looks back at his school days and the two girls with whom he was romantically involved when they were all 14—Helen Smart, the leftist intellectual, and Christine Copperfield, the &quot;golden girl&quot;. Newson cannot resist the temptation and logs on to Friends Reunited. To his surprise, more of his former classmates than he would have thought are also online, and soon a class reunion is being organised—by Christine Copperfield, of all people.

This is the point where Newson&#x27;s private life collides with his murder investigation. The serial killer uses the same web site—Friends Reunited—as the source of his knowledge about instances of bullying that happened decades ago. When Helen Smart posts a long account of how back at school she was forced by Christine Copperfield to stuff a tampon down her throat the murderer is supplied with one more story on which he or she might act. Christine Copperfield dies with a tampon stuffed down her throat.

In the tradition of the whodunnit, while new murders are committed, the identity of the killer remains unknown until the final pages of the novel.

==Critical reception==
Jane Jakeman of The Independent said the book has &quot;an obvious solution&quot; and criticized the sexual aspects of the storyline saying that &quot;Elton relentlessly exploits every crude possibility&quot;. Stephanie Merritt of The Observer called the book &quot;engaging and smartly plotted&quot; but felt the book has &quot;potential to date quickly&quot;. Adam Lively of The Times praised the &quot;warm-hearted characterisation&quot; calling the lead character, Ed Newson, &quot;engagingly characterised&quot; but did feel it has a &quot;predictable outcome&quot;.

<doc id="1172904" wikidata="Q5538" url="?curid=1172904" title="Cotoneaster">
<text>Cotoneaster is a genus of flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae, native to the Palaearctic region (temperate Asia, Europe, north Africa), with a strong concentration of diversity in the genus in the mountains of southwestern China and the Himalayas. They are related to hawthorns (&quot;Crataegus&quot;), firethorns (&quot;Pyracantha&quot;), photinias (&quot;Photinia&quot;), and rowans (&quot;Sorbus&quot;).

Depending on the species definition used, between 70 and 300 different species of &quot;Cotoneaster&quot; are described, with many apomictic microspecies treated as species by some authors, but only as varieties by others.

The majority of species are shrubs from tall, varying from ground-hugging prostrate plants to erect shrubs; a few, notably &quot;C. frigidus&quot;, are small trees up to tall and trunk diameter. The prostrate species are mostly alpine plants growing at high altitudes (e.g. &quot;C. integrifolius&quot;, which grows at in the Himalayas), while the larger species occur in scrub and woodland gaps at lower altitudes.

==Description==
The shoots are dimorphic, with long shoots ( long) producing structural branch growth, and short shoots ( long) bearing the flowers; this pattern often developing a &#x27;herringbone&#x27; form of branching. The leaves are arranged alternately, long, ovate to lanceolate in shape, entire; both evergreen and deciduous species occur.

The flowers are produced in late spring through early summer, solitary or in corymbs of up to 100 together. The flower is either fully open or has its five petals half open diameter. They may be any shade from white through creamy white to light pink to dark pink to almost red, 10–20 stamens and up to five styles. The fruit is a small pome diameter, pink or bright red, orange or even maroon or black when mature, containing one to three (rarely up to five) seeds. Fruit on some species stays on until the following year.

== Wildlife value ==
&quot;Cotoneaster&quot; species are used as larval food plants by some Lepidoptera species including grey dagger, mottled umber, short-cloaked moth, winter moth, and hawthorn moth. The flowers attract bees and butterflies and the fruits are eaten by birds.

Although only a single species is native there, in the UK and Ireland, &quot;Cotoneaster&quot; species are, along with the related genus &quot;Pyracantha&quot;, a source of nectar. The red berries are also highly attractive to blackbirds and other thrushes.

== Cultivation and uses ==
Cotoneasters are very popular garden shrubs, grown for their attractive habit and decorative fruit. Some cultivars are of known parentage, such as the very popular &quot;Cotoneaster&quot; × &quot;watereri&quot; (Waterer&#x27;s cotoneaster; &quot;C. frigidus&quot; × &quot;C. salicifolius&quot;), while others are of mixed or unknown heritage.

The following species and cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit:-
* &quot;Cotoneaster atropurpureus&quot; &#x27;Variegatus&#x27; 
* &quot;Cotoneaster conspicuus&quot; &#x27;Decorus&#x27;
* &quot;Cotoneaster&quot; &#x27;Cornubia&#x27; 
* &quot;Cotoneaster lacteus&quot; 
* &quot;Cotoneaster procumbens&quot; &#x27;Queen of Carpets&#x27; 
* &quot;Cotoneaster&quot; &#x27;Rothschildianus&#x27;
* &quot;Cotoneaster salicifolius&quot; &#x27;Gnom&#x27; 
* &quot;Cotoneaster salicifolius&quot; &#x27;Pink Champagne&#x27; 
* &quot;Cotoneaster sternianus&quot; 
* &quot;Cotoneaster&quot; × &quot;suecicus&quot; &#x27;Coral Beauty&#x27;
* &quot;Cotoneaster&quot; × &quot;suecicus&quot; &#x27;Juliette&#x27; 
===Invasiveness===
Many species have escaped from cultivation and become invasive weeds where climatic conditions are suitable for them, such as the many Chinese species naturalised in northwestern Europe. &quot;C. glaucophyllus&quot; has become an invasive weed in Australia and California. &quot;C. simonsii&quot; is listed on the New Zealand National Pest Plant Accord preventing its sale and distribution because of its invasiveness. On Portland, Dorset, UK, it has become invasive and is regularly culled to prevent damage to the Jurassic Coast.

== Nomenclature and classification ==
The genus name &quot;Cotoneaster&quot; derives from &quot;cotoneum&quot;, a Latin name for the quince, and the suffix &quot;-aster&quot;, &#x27;resembling&#x27;. The name is correctly masculine, though in some older works it was wrongly treated as feminine, resulting in different name endings for many of the species (e.g.&quot;Cotoneaster integerrima&quot; instead of &quot;Cotoneaster integerrimus&quot;).

The genus is often divided into two or more sections, though the situation is complicated by hybridisation:
* &quot;Cotoneaster&quot; sect. &quot;Cotoneaster&quot; (syn. sect. &quot;Orthopetalum&quot;). Flowers solitary or up to 6 together; petals forward-pointing, often tinged pink. Mostly smaller shrubs.
* &quot;Cotoneaster&quot; sect. &quot;Chaenopetalum&quot;. Flowers more than 20 together in corymbs; petals opening flat, creamy white. Mostly larger shrubs.

==Edibility==
All Cotoneaster berries are eaten by many birds. Like most other small, red berries, they are evolved to have birds spread the seeds widely and are not good for humans to eat. The Children&#x27;s Hospital of Philadelphia lists Cotoneaster berries as poisonous

<doc id="1172906" wikidata="Q2364900" url="?curid=1172906" title="Conkeror">
<text>Conkeror is a Mozilla-based web browser designed to be navigated primarily by a computer keyboard. Its design is mainly patterned after the text editor GNU Emacs, with some influence from other programs, including vi.

It was originally written by Shawn Betts, the primary author of keyboard-driven ratpoison and Stumpwm tiling window managers. Formerly an extension for the Mozilla Firefox browser, it is now developed for XULRunner as a stand-alone application. Since Firefox 52 ESR (September 2018), when the last official Mozilla browser that supported XULRunner reached end-of-life, there is no officially-supported browser from Mozilla for Conkeror to be based on. Firefox forks like Pale Moon and Waterfox continue to bundle XULRunner and can be used to run Conkeror.

Conkeror is released under the same set of free software licenses as Mozilla: the GNU General Public License, the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the Mozilla Public License.

== Browsing ==
Conkeror emphasizes Emacs-derived key bindings and keyboard-based browser navigation. By pressing a key (codice_1, for &quot;follow&quot;, by default), Conkeror brings up a small, numbered label beside every element within the current view on the page that can be clicked. The user can type the number of the link and codice_2 to follow the link, or type the link name to narrow down the choices; when the part of the name already typed uniquely identifies a link, it becomes numbered one, highlighted green, and then hitting codice_3 will follow it.

Conkeror has a large number of standard key bindings, and more can be added. The following are some examples of default key bindings: (key bindings are case sensitive)
Like Emacs, Conkeror makes use of buffers in order to allow multiple pages to remain open at the same time (similar to tabs in traditional browsers). Users can open new buffers and navigate through them using key bindings. For example, codice_4 opens a hyperlink in a new buffer, codice_5 goes to a URL or search term in a new buffer, and codice_6 opens the start page in a new buffer. Buffers can be cycled through using codice_7 to go to the next buffer or codice_8 to go to the previous one. codice_9 displays a list of the currently open buffers from which the user can choose a buffer using the up and down arrows.

== Customization ==
The Conkeror browser can be customized in many ways using JavaScript as the scripting language, much in the way that Emacs uses Emacs Lisp. Customizations can be as simple as rebinding keys, but can also be more involved; for instance, writing new interactive commands. By default, Conkeror looks for these customizations in &quot;~/.conkerorrc&quot;. If &quot;~/.conkerorrc/&quot; is a directory instead of a file, then all the contained files will be read, which is a technique to enable modularization of bigger customizations.

Conkeror also ships with a number of loadable JavaScript modules, some of which provide core functionality; others are user-loadable and provide additional functionality.

Conkeror has &quot;modes&quot; in which the key bindings, page display or browser behaviour become uri-specific. Some modes, like xkcd-mode, come by default. In xkcd-mode, the message which is normally displayed when the user mouses over the comic strip is instead displayed in a special font below the strip. Other modes include those for Google Maps, Reddit and YouTube, and modes can be user-defined as well.

== Name ==
The name of the browser is pronounced identically to that of the Konqueror web browser from the KDE suite of desktop software, although according to the Conkeror FAQ, &quot;the full name of the browser in spoken English is &#x27;Conkeror (with a C) to avoid confusion.

Also according to the FAQ, the name derives from the name given to the winner of a game of conkers, a children&#x27;s game involving horse chestnuts on a string, as well as from a brand of beer also called Conkeror.

<doc id="1172911" wikidata="Q7895050" url="?curid=1172911" title="University of Alberta Students' Union">
<text>The University of Alberta Students&#x27; Union (UASU) is the student society that represents undergraduate students at the University of Alberta. Originally established in October 1908 as the Students&#x27; Council, the UASU is a non-profit corporation that operates under the authority of the Post-Secondary Learning Act (Alberta). Its membership consists of the roughly 31,000 undergraduate students enrolled at the university.

With an annual budget of more than $13,000,000 and hundreds of paid and volunteer staff, the Students&#x27; Union serves as an advocate for students and provides a variety of services to its members. The Students&#x27; Union also operates a number of businesses, manages various targeted trust funds, hosts a wide variety of entertainment and educational events, and runs the Students&#x27; Union Building.

== History ==
The UASU was founded in 1908 following the opening of the University of Alberta. Despite the university having a small student body of only 45 students, the original UASU consisted of eight elected representatives. Among the first body were Stacey McCall, the first UASU president, Cecil Rutherford, son of Alberta Premier and founder of the University of Alberta Alexander Cameron Rutherford, and Kathleen Wilson, the first woman to register at the University of Alberta.

In 1916, Katie McCrimmon was elected as President of the UASU. She became the first woman to become President of a students&#x27; union in Canada. 

In 1920, the Students&#x27; Council was renamed to the University of Alberta Students Union. 

In 1927, the UASU undertook its first construction project. Resulting from the lack of sports and recreation facilities, the UASU imposed a $3 annual fee per student, raised $1800 from local businesses, and secured a $20,000 from the Alberta government for the purposes of building a covered skating rink. The rink was completed in December 1927 and remained in use for the next thirty years.

In 1951, the first building constructed by UASU opened. Presently called University Hall, it purpose was to house the UASU, but, was quickly found to be too small. University Hall was given to the University of Alberta&#x27;s administration following the completion of the Students&#x27; Union Building in 1967.

In 1962 referendum, the student body approved an $11/term fee per student for the purposes of building a new student owned facility. In 1965, with funding from the Government of Alberta, construction began. The building, called the Students&#x27; Union Building (SUB), opened in 1967 and was the largest building of its kind in Canada upon completion. 

In 1971, in response to a lack of affordable student housing, the UASU began construction on the Housing Union Building (HUB). It was completed two years later in 1973 and offered subsidized housing to students. Financial difficulties including a deficit of $1.8 million, forced the UASU to sell HUB to the University of Alberta April 1976 for $1.

In 2018, the UASU celebrated its 100th anniversary. 

==Students&#x27; Council==
The Students&#x27; Council is the highest decision-making body of the UASU and is composed of a speaker, a general manager (both of whom are non-voting members), councillors elected from each faculty, 5 executive members and an undergraduate student representative to serve on the university&#x27;s Board of Governors, all of whom are elected in an annual campus-wide general election every March.

The breakdown of faculty councillors is as below:

* 1 from the Faculty of Agricultural, Life and Environmental Sciences
* 2 from the Faculty of Arts
* 1 from the Faculty of Augustana
* 1 from the Faculty of Business
* 1 from the Faculty of Education
* 2 from the Faculty of Engineering
* 1 from Faculte Saint-Jean
* 1 from the Faculty of Kinesiology, Sport &amp; Recreation
* 1 from the Faculty of Law
* 1 from the Faculty of Medicine &amp; Dentistry
* 1 from the Faculty of Native Studies
* 1 from the Faculty of Nursing
* 1 from the Faculty of Open Studies
* 1 from the Faculty of Pharmacy
* 3 from the Faculty of Science

==Representation==
Provincially, the Students&#x27; Union participates in the Council of Alberta University Students. The Students&#x27; Union was a founding member of the Canadian Alliance of Students Associations. While it took a brief hiatus on its membership, having pulled out in 2003, the Students&#x27; Union moved to rejoin CASA in March 2008.

In the fall of 2016, the Students&#x27; Union expanded the U-Pass program to Fort Saskatchewan, Leduc and Spruce Grove.

==Services==
The Students&#x27; Union provides a number of services to assist students in their academic careers. These services include:
* Access Fund
* Campus Food Bank
* InfoLink
* Ombudservice
* Peer Support Centre
* Safewalk
* Student Job Registry
The Students&#x27; Union also runs several businesses, which offer discounts to Students&#x27; Union staff and volunteers.

== Students&#x27; Union Building ==
Built in 1967, the Students&#x27; Union Building (SUB) is the headquarters of the Students&#x27; Union. It contains the Horowitz Theatre.

=== Horowitz Theatre ===
The Horowitz Theatre is a 683-seat concert hall which hosts a variety of events, including live music, dance and lectures. The theatre has no regular season, and is rented by various student and community groups. They also regularly host shows organized by promoters looking for an intimate mid-sized venue in Edmonton.

Built in 1967 during the building of the Students&#x27; Union Building, the theatre was originally called SUB Theatre. The theatre has been through three renovations since opening: a major overall in 1983, a technical update in 1988, and another major renovation which finished in 2024. The theatre was renamed in 1989 to honour the outgoing university president at the time, Dr. Myer Horowitz.

<text>The Beer Heights Light Railway operates of minimum-gauge track at Beer, Devon, England. It is part of Pecorama, an exhibition owned by Peco.

==Overview==
The official opening was by Rev. W.V. Awdry on 14 July 1975, at which time it offered a return ride from &quot;Much Natter&quot; station via a balloon loop. Subsequently, it was almost doubled in length by construction of the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Gorge&quot; extension which involved a very considerable cutting and tunnel, and the complex track layout also includes a more recent steeply-graded branch line to &quot;Wildway Down&quot;. The station at Deepwater was revamped in late 2014 and reopened in July 2015 as &#x27;Deepwater Halt&#x27;. 

The line is notable for its high standard of presentation to the public and for the fine views obtainable from it. It is home to eight live steam locomotives designed on narrow gauge principles.

==Locomotives==
The railway currently has eight steam locomotives, two diesel and one electric. A locomotive called &#x27;Finn MacCool&#x27; also visits every summer (usually July – September) from the Belfast and County Down Miniature Railway Society, Northern Ireland, to help out in the peak season. Other locomotives also visit during the &#x27;Loco Week&#x27; and &#x27;Bank Holiday Weekend Gala&#x27; in August. A list of locomotives currently in use is below:

<doc id="1172920" wikidata="Q2630861" url="?curid=1172920" title="Operation Yellow Ribbon">
<text>Operation Yellow Ribbon () was commenced by Canada to handle the diversion of civilian airline flights in response to the September 11 attacks in 2001 in the United States. Canada&#x27;s goal was to ensure that potentially destructive air traffic be removed from United States airspace as quickly as possible, and away from potential U.S. targets, and to instead place these aircraft on the ground in Canada, at military and civilian airports primarily in the Canadian provinces of Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, and British Columbia. Yukon, New Brunswick, Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, the Northwest Territories, and Quebec also took in aircraft so that any malicious or destructive potential threats could be better contained and neutralized. None of the aircraft proved to be a threat, and Canada hosted thousands of passengers who were stranded until U.S. airspace was reopened.

Canada commenced the operation after the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), implementing Security Control of Air Traffic and Air Navigation Aids (SCATANA), grounded all aircraft across the United States, an unprecedented action. The FAA then worked with Transport Canada to reroute incoming international flights to airports in Canada.

During the operation, departing flights—with the exception of police, military, and humanitarian flights—were cancelled, marking the first time that Canadian airspace had been shut down. In total, as a result of Operation Yellow Ribbon, between 225 and 240 aircraft were diverted to 17 different airports across the country.

==Deployment of emergency measures==
Immediately after the attacks on the World Trade Center (WTC), both Transport Canada and Nav Canada, the Canadian air navigation agency, activated their emergency measures.

===Transport Canada===
Transport Canada activated its situation centre (SitCen) in Ottawa at 09:21 EDT (13:21 UTC), 18 minutes after the second plane hit the WTC.

The SitCen is Transport Canada&#x27;s emergency operations centre (EOC), originally constructed to deal with earthquakes along the British Columbia Coast. It had been used several times prior to September 11, 2001, including the January 1998 North American ice storm and after Swissair Flight 111 crashed off the coast from Peggy&#x27;s Cove, Nova Scotia, on September 2, 1998. As personnel staffed the SitCen, key organizations such as Nav Canada, the Department of National Defence, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC), and Canada Customs and Revenue Agency (CCRA) were also involved in SitCen operations. One of the tasks of the SitCen was to maintain contact with other members of the Canadian aviation community, such as the Air Transport Association of Canada and local airport authorities. Their counterparts in the FAA (United States) and other international civil aviation authorities were also kept apprised.

===Nav Canada===

Nav Canada set up two command centres, the Strategic Command Centre (SCC) and the Tactical Command Centre (TCC).

The SCC, located at the head office in Ottawa and headed by Andy Vasarins, vice-president of operations, oversaw the entire crisis and ensured that information and resources were effectively shared amongst the TCC and other parties.

The TCC was originally a training institute in Cornwall, Ontario, and headed by Kathy Fox, assistant vice-president of air traffic services. Its role in the crisis was to disseminate information amongst airports and control towers. To facilitate this, general managers from across Canada were present. After the immediate crisis passed, the TCC was relocated to the head office and its operations were merged with the SCC.

==The operation==
The operation officially began at 09:45 ET (13:45 UTC), when Ben Sliney, working in his first day in his position as the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration&#x27;s (FAA) National Operations Manager, ordered all U.S. airspace to be shut down as a result of the attacks.

===Actions taken by Transport Canada===
After learning that the FAA had closed down U.S. airspace, David Collenette, the Canadian Transport Minister, gave orders that Canadian airports be open only for outgoing police, military, and humanitarian flights, and incoming U.S. bound international flights. This was the first unplanned closure of Canadian airspace.

About 500 flights were en route to the U.S. at the time of the attacks. Transport Canada instructed Nav Canada to give permission for transoceanic flights that were at least halfway towards their destination (i.e. had already passed the point of no return across the Atlantic or Pacific Ocean) to land at the nearest Canadian airport, depending on their point of origin and remaining fuel. Planes were entering Canadian airspace at a rate of one to two planes per minute.

During the operation, SitCen staff focused on two issues: where to land the aircraft, and how to screen, deplane, and clear tens of thousands of passengers through immigration and customs. CIC and CCRA brought in extra staff from other posts to clear the passengers.

The first airport to receive diverted flights was Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Goose Bay, which received seven aircraft; fourteen other airports from coast to coast would also receive the diverted flights. As the operation progressed, SitCen staff maintained contact with the affected airports, Collenette, and his deputy, Margaret Bloodworth.

===Atlantic flights===
The operation was a challenge for airports in Atlantic Canada. Transport Canada asked Nav Canada to instruct flights coming from Europe to avoid Macdonald–Cartier International Airport in Ottawa, Lester B. Pearson International Airport in Toronto, and Dorval International Airport in Montreal as a security measure, since they are among the major—and therefore busiest—airports in Central Canada. The majority of incoming flights from Europe were received by Atlantic airports, though some diverted flights did land at Dorval and Pearson.

Gander International Airport, which was the first North American airport on the transatlantic route, took in 38 wide-body aircraft, mostly heading for U.S. destinations. The number of passengers and crew accommodated at Gander was about 6,600. The population of Gander at the time was fewer than 10,000 people. Jean Chrétien, then-Canadian Prime Minister, stated that in the span of a few short hours the population of Gander jumped by more than 50%.

Halifax International Airport handled 40 flights in a similar manner. St. John&#x27;s International Airport, Greater Moncton International Airport, CFB Goose Bay and Stephenville International Airport handled the remainder of the transatlantic flights.

===Pacific flights===
Most flights coming from Asia and the Pacific to destinations on the West Coast of the United States and points beyond had no choice but to land at Vancouver International Airport, as it was the only major Canadian airport on the West Coast capable of handling the large aircraft used for transpacific flights. Thirty-four flights carrying 8,500 passengers landed in Vancouver, British Columbia.

===Military involvement===
There were also several incidents in which the military escorted jets into Canadian airspace. The joint U.S.–Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command used Canadian Forces Air Command and United States Air Force fighter jet aircraft to intercept and escort civilian passenger flights to Whitehorse International Airport in Yukon.

One of the intercepted flights was Korean Air Flight 85, destined for John F. Kennedy International Airport with a stopover in Anchorage, Alaska, which was believed to have been hijacked. Concerns about the plane being crashed into Anchorage led several buildings in the city to be evacuated. Several buildings were also evacuated in Whitehorse as a precaution. The flight ended up running low on fuel, and according to a public affairs official at the airport, there was also a communication problem with the air crew. When it landed at the airport, witnesses reported that the RCMP ordered the crew out of the plane at gunpoint. The incident was a misunderstanding caused by a malfunctioning transponder and translation error. A year after the event, then-Prime Minister Jean Chrétien revealed that he had given permission to the intercepting fighter jets to shoot down the airliner if the fighter pilots believed that the plane carried terrorists.

Global and the &quot;National Post&quot; reported that a similar incident occurred at Vancouver International Airport. Two U.S. F-15s escorted an Air China Boeing 747 bound from Beijing to San Francisco onto the airport&#x27;s north runway. Officials at the airport reported that it was purely a communication problem.

===Reaction===
Prior to landing, most pilots did not inform passengers of the situation or the attacks in order to avoid fear and panic. On some planes, even pilots were unaware of the terrorist attacks. Global TV quoted one pilot telling reporters: &quot;When we were in the air, we really didn&#x27;t know what was going on. All we heard was security measures and we were diverted. That was all we knew…&quot;

Only after landing did pilots tell passengers what had happened, sometimes addressing passengers directly in the cabin. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; quoted a woman whose flight from Frankfurt to Dallas was diverted to Pearson, saying that three hours before landing, the pilot announced that the plane was heading through turbulence. She went on to say that &quot;then he said we were experiencing strong headwinds and we had to land in Canada to refuel. When we landed, he said, &#x27;Okay, there&#x27;s been a terrorist attack.&#x27;&quot;

Passengers had to wait for hours to disembark because Transport Canada was on high-security alert. The RCMP deployed extra personnel to airports so that they could perform a security sweep of each aircraft, lined up on closed runways at most airports. They also increased their presence in the airport terminals.

At some airports, stranded passengers watched television coverage while others talked to the airport chaplains, as at Pearson. Airports had crisis support teams to help them.

The CBC reported that the operation received thanks from Washington. Norman Mineta, the United States Secretary of Transportation, said at a White House news briefing that &quot;we owe our Canadian neighbours a debt of gratitude for helping us as we redirected…flights and their passengers to airports in Canada.&quot; On the tenth anniversary of 9/11, President Barack Obama recalled Canada&#x27;s help on that day, and expressed his gratitude for Canada&#x27;s friendship and solidarity.

==Aftermath==

===Totals===
The actual number of diverted aircraft and passengers varies from each source. Transport Canada said over 33,000 passengers on 224 flights arrived in Canada, whereas Nav Canada gave a total of 239 flights. According to Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, the number of flights was between 225 and 250 and the number of passengers was between 30,000 and 45,000.

Halifax International Airport received the most flights while Vancouver International Airport received the most passengers.

Transport Canada and airports involved in the operation also reported a dramatic increase in traffic at their websites for updated and current information concerning news releases, FAQs, and diverted flight information. Transport Canada reported that on September 12, 2001, the day after the attacks, there were more than 47,000 visits to their web site alone. Halifax International Airport reported that just in September, there were 2.1 million visits to their web site, and in October, half a million. Both numbers were far above the average at the time of 40,000 to 50,000 visits per month.

===Consequences for Canada===

After the initial task of diverting the flights was over, thousands of stranded passengers and flight crews had to be housed and fed until the crisis was over. During the diversion of flights, some airports, including Vancouver International, were inundated with hundreds of telephone calls from members of the public and the corporate community offering their support. In Ottawa, SitCen staff were also inundated with calls from airports, air carriers, the media, and the general public. SitCen staff received an estimated 5,000 calls a day.

When asked in a CNN interview if he was able to get food to the passengers, Jean Chrétien, the Prime Minister of Canada, said that he was able to, and that &quot;many of them have been accommodated in hotels and schools and gymnasiums and so on. And the Canadian authorities and provincial authorities are working… [to make their visitors] in those places as comfortable as possible.&quot;

Public efforts to help those affected by Operation Yellow Ribbon led to positive remarks on the subject by people such as Chrétien and his wife, Aline; the United States Ambassador to Canada, Paul Cellucci; Collenette; Governor General Adrienne Clarkson and her husband, John Ralston Saul; and in the provinces, premiers, and lieutenant governors. Airports involved in the effort received messages of thanks from passengers, airlines, residents who took in the passengers, and staff at U.S. immigration and U.S. customs. Edmonton International Airport also received a child passenger&#x27;s drawing of the diverted flights on the ground there, published on page 12 of their 2001 annual report. Some airports, including Halifax and Edmonton, also published messages of thanks on their websites and/or annual reports. Many stories of the hospitality given to stranded passengers have come out as a result of the operation.

Some airports were awarded for how they handled the crisis. The British Columbia Aviation Council presented its 2001 Airport Management Award to Vancouver International Airport, citing its professional and compassionate handling of the situation, while the Canadian Public Relations Society (Nova Scotia) presented Halifax International an Amethyst Award in the Crisis Communications category to honour the authority&#x27;s crisis communication response to the situation.

On September 11, 2002, about 2,500 people gathered at Gander International Airport for Canada&#x27;s memorial service to mark the first anniversary of the attacks, over which Chrétien, Collenette, and Cellucci and other provincial and local officials presided. Chrétien addressed them: &quot;9/11 will live long in memory as a day of terror and grief. But thanks to the countless acts of kindness and compassion done for those stranded visitors here in Gander and right across Canada it will live forever in memory as a day of comfort and of healing&quot; and closed his speech by commending Operation Yellow Ribbon, &quot;You did yourselves proud, ladies and gentlemen, and you did Canada proud.&quot;

==In popular culture==
Operation Yellow Ribbon has been the subject of several popularizations. 

It was dramatized in the CBC miniseries &quot;Diverted&quot; and is the subject of the Broadway musical &quot;Come from Away&quot;, written by the Canadian writing team of Irene Sankoff and David Hein. The musical follows the stories of several passengers, Newfoundlanders, and flight crews in the days following 9/11. The show ran on Broadway at the Schoenfeld Theatre from 2017 to October 2, 2022. It received seven nominations in the 2017 71st Tony Awards, including best musical. It won a Tony Award for Best Direction of a Musical. Gander&#x27;s part in Operation Yellow Ribbon is examined in the 2018 film &quot;You Are Here&quot;, which won the Canadian Screen Award for best documentary.

The efforts of Gander Centre and Gander Air Traffic control during Operation Yellow Ribbon were showcased on a Discovery Channel documentary entitled &quot;9/11: Cleared for Chaos.&quot;

<text>× &quot;Ascocenda&quot;, abbreviated as Ascda in the horticultural trade, was a human-made hybrid orchid genus resulting from a cross between the former genus &quot;Ascocentrum&quot; and &quot;Vanda&quot; (Asctm × V). It was first described in Orchid Rev. 57: 172 (1949). &quot;Ascocentrum&quot; is now synonymous with &quot;Vanda&quot;, so the name is obsolete. Hybrids in the nothogenus × &quot;Ascocenda&quot; are now properly termed &quot;Vanda&quot;.

× &quot;Ascocenda&quot; hybrids are common in cultivation with numerous cultivars and often combine the large flower size of the &quot;Vanda&quot; parents with the color and compactness of the &quot;Ascocentrum&quot; parents.

They are evergreen compact epiphytes with upright, narrow, oviform leaves. The inflorescence is an axillary cluster with 6 to 8 open flowers. They bloom twice or sometimes three times a year with long lasting flowers. The flowers are brightly colored, often overlaid with contrasting colors.

<text>Queen Elizabeth II Dock is a dock situated on the River Mersey at Eastham, in the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral, Merseyside, England.

Construction of the dock began in 1949, adjacent to the entrance of the Manchester Ship Canal at Eastham Locks and opening directly onto the river. The dock was built to provide berthing facilities for large tankers that could not be accommodated on the existing canal due to their size. Simultaneously, Eastham Oil Terminal was built nearby and pipelines were laid to link the dock and storage facility to the Stanlow Oil Refinery near Ellesmere Port. The Queen Elizabeth II Dock became operational on 19 January 1954.

The lock chamber measures in size with a water depth of . Two steel gates are located at either end of the lock, with a further gate one third of the way along from the Mersey entrance. These gates open by retracting into the dock wall. The dock itself was constructed with four berths, each capable of handling tankers of up to 30,000 gross tons.

Subsequent increases in tanker size since the dock was built has meant that the largest tankers use the Tranmere Oil Terminal and at offshore berths at Anglesey in North Wales.

As part of the emergency procedures for the Manchester Ship Canal, an emergency siren located at the dock is tested every morning around 0845 and is audible in many parts of South Liverpool and Ellesmere Port.

<doc id="1172930" wikidata="Q5312069" url="?curid=1172930" title="Dudleya virens">
<text>Dudleya virens, the green liveforever or bright green dudleya, is an uncommon species of perennial, succulent plant in the family Crassulaceae, native to several coastal southern California and Baja California locations.

==Distribution==
The succulent is found growing in the Palos Verdes Hills on the Palos Verdes Peninsula coast in Los Angeles County; on several of the Channel Islands in California; and on Guadalupe Island off the northwestern Baja California Peninsula, Mexico.

==Description==
&quot;Dudleya virens&quot; leaves are fleshy and strap-shaped, 8–20 cm long and 1.5–3 cm broad, tapering from the base (or from near middle) and are mostly green. They are arranged in a rosette.

The flowers are white, with five petals 7–10 mm long. They are produced in April, May, and June. Hummingbirds visit the flowers for their nectar.

===Subspecies===

There has been some developing arguments on how to best categorize the various subspecies of &quot;Dudleya virens&quot;. The division stems from the fact that the current groupings of the &quot;Dudleya virens&quot; subspecies are polyphyletic as opposed to monophyletic. The overall evolutionary history of &quot;Dudleya virens&quot; has been difficult to pin down which has contributed to the confusion surrounding the clarification of the subspecies. This has led to some researchers suggesting that the white leafed sub species of should be separated into its own species that is distinct from the green colored subspecies, although this theory is not backed with any DNA results.

==Cultivation==
&quot;Dudleya virens&quot; is cultivated as an ornamental plant in the specialty native plants and succulents horticulture trade. It is used in containers, drought tolerant landscapes, and habitat gardens. It prefers well-draining soil, and grows best in full sun or light shade.

== Endangerment and Conservation ==

=== Poaching and Predation ===
&quot;Dudleya virens&quot; has been specifically affected by the surge in &quot;Dudleya&quot; poaching to be sold in a similar way to &quot;Dudleya farinosa&quot; which was covered in the 2021 documentary &quot;Plant Heist&quot;&quot;.&quot; Where &quot;Dudleya virens&quot; plants are illegally harvested and shipped to regions of Asia to be sold for profit as medicine or as a pot plant. The succulent is also threatened by invasive grazing animal species that were introduced during the colonization of the Americas. These animals over consume the plants. The poaching by people and predation by invasive species has led to &quot;Dudleya virens,&quot; specifically &quot;Dudleya virens&quot; spp. &quot;insularis,&quot; to be ranked a 1B.2 in terms of rarity (rare, threatened, or endangered) by the state of California.

=== Conservation ===
Through consorted conservation efforts, &quot;Dudleya virens&quot; has been able to make a considerable ecological come back from its previously concerning status. One of the major factors in their successful rehabilitation has been the removal of invasive grazing species: rabbits, horse, and pigs that were introduced during the colonization of California. These animals tend to over consume several &quot;Dudleya virens&quot; subspecies throughout the Channel Islands. The other major factor is that California passed a bill that makes poaching &quot;Dudleya virens&quot; with an intent to sell a fineable offense&quot;.&quot; The removal of these invasive grazers and the crack down of succulent poaching has created the conditions necessary for &quot;Dudleya virens&quot; to recover across the Channel Islands.

<doc id="1172932" wikidata="Q407577" url="?curid=1172932" title="Sodium azide">
<text>Sodium azide is an inorganic compound with the formula . This colorless salt is the gas-forming component in some car airbag systems. It is used for the preparation of other azide compounds. It is an ionic substance, is highly soluble in water, and is acutely poisonous.

==Structure==
Sodium azide is an ionic solid. Two crystalline forms are known, rhombohedral and hexagonal. Both adopt layered structures. The azide anion is very similar in each form, being centrosymmetric with N–N distances of 1.18 Å. The ion has an octahedral geometry. Each azide is linked to six centers, with three Na–N bonds to each terminal nitrogen center.

==Preparation==
The common synthesis method is the &quot;Wislicenus process&quot;, which proceeds in two steps in liquid ammonia. In the first step, ammonia is converted to sodium amide by metallic sodium:
It is a redox reaction in which metallic sodium gives an electron to a proton of ammonia which is reduced in hydrogen gas. Sodium easily dissolves in liquid ammonia to produce solvated electrons responsible for the blue color of the resulting liquid. The and ions are produced by this reaction.

The sodium amide is subsequently combined with nitrous oxide:
These reactions are the basis of the industrial route, which produced about 250 tons per year in 2004, with production increasing due to the increased use of airbags.

===Laboratory methods===
Curtius and Thiele developed another production process, where a nitrite ester is converted to sodium azide using hydrazine. This method is suited for laboratory preparation of sodium azide:
:
Alternatively the salt can be obtained by the reaction of sodium nitrate with sodium amide.

== Chemical reactions ==
===Acid formation of hydrazoic acid===
Treatment of sodium azide with strong acids gives gaseous hydrazoic acid (hydrogen azide; HN3), which is also extremely toxic:

===Hydrazoic acid equilibrium===
Aqueous solutions contain minute amounts of hydrazoic acid, the formation of which is described by the following equilibrium:

:, &quot;K&quot; = 10−4.6

===Destruction===
Sodium azide can be destroyed by treatment with &quot;in situ&quot; prepared nitrous acid (HNO2; not HNO3). &quot;In situ&quot; preparation is necessary as HNO2 is unstable and decomposes rapidly in aqueous solutions. This destruction must be done with great caution and within a chemical fume hood as the formed gaseous nitric oxide (NO) is also toxic, and an incorrect order of acid addition for &quot;in situ&quot; formation of HNO2 will instead produce gaseous highly toxic hydrazoic acid (HN3).

==Applications==

===Automobile airbags and aircraft evacuation slides ===
Older airbag formulations contained mixtures of oxidizers, sodium azide and other agents including ignitors and accelerants. An electronic controller detonates this mixture during an automobile crash:
The same reaction occurs upon heating the salt to approximately 300 °C. The sodium that is formed is a potential hazard alone and, in automobile airbags, it is converted by reaction with other ingredients, such as potassium nitrate and silica. In the latter case, innocuous sodium silicates are generated. While sodium azide is still used in evacuation slides on modern aircraft, newer-generation automotive air bags contain less sensitive explosives such as nitroguanidine or guanidine nitrate.

===Organic and inorganic synthesis===
Due to its explosion hazard, sodium azide is of only limited value in industrial-scale organic synthesis. In the laboratory, it is used to introduce the azide functional group by displacement of halides. The azide functional group can thereafter be converted to an amine by reduction with either  in ethanol or lithium aluminium hydride or a tertiary phosphine, such as triphenylphosphine in the Staudinger reaction, with Raney nickel or with hydrogen sulfide in pyridine. Oseltamivir, an antiviral medication, is currently produced in commercial scale by a method which utilizes sodium azide.

Sodium azide is a versatile precursor to other inorganic azide compounds, e.g., lead azide and silver azide, which are used in detonators as primary explosives. These azides are significantly more sensitive to premature detonation than sodium azide and thus have limited applications. Lead and silver azide can be made via double displacement reaction with sodium azide and their respective nitrate (most commonly) or acetate salts. Sodium azide can also react with the chloride salts of certain alkaline earth metals in aqueous solution, such as barium chloride or strontium chloride to respectively produce barium azide and strontium azide, which are also relatively sensitive primarily explosive materials. These azides can be recovered from solution through careful desiccation.

===Biochemistry and biomedical uses===
Sodium azide is a useful probe reagent, and an antibacterial preservative for biochemical solutions. In the past merthiolate and chlorobutanol were also used as an alternative to azide for preservation of biochemical solutions.

Sodium azide is an instantaneous inhibitor of lactoperoxidase, which can be useful to stop lactroperoxidase catalyzed 125I protein radiolabeling experiments.

In hospitals and laboratories, it is a biocide; it is especially important in bulk reagents and stock solutions which may otherwise support bacterial growth where the sodium azide acts as a bacteriostatic by inhibiting cytochrome oxidase in gram-negative bacteria; however, some gram-positive bacteria (streptococci, pneumococci, lactobacilli) are intrinsically resistant.

=== Agricultural uses ===
It is used in agriculture for pest control of soil-borne pathogens such as &quot;Meloidogyne incognita&quot; or &quot;Helicotylenchus dihystera&quot;.

It is also used as a mutagen for crop selection of plants such as rice, barley or oats.

==Safety considerations==
Sodium azide can be fatally toxic, and even minute amounts can cause symptoms. The toxicity of this compound is comparable to that of soluble alkali cyanides, although no toxicity has been reported from spent airbags.

It produces extrapyramidal symptoms with necrosis of the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and basal ganglia. Toxicity may also include hypotension, blindness and hepatic necrosis. Sodium azide increases cyclic GMP levels in the brain and liver by activation of guanylate cyclase.

Sodium azide solutions react with metallic ions to precipitate metal azides, which can be shock sensitive and explosive. This should be considered for choosing a non-metallic transport container for sodium azide solutions in the laboratory. This can also create potentially dangerous situations if azide solutions should be directly disposed down the drain into a sanitary sewer system. Metal in the plumbing system could react, forming highly sensitive metal azide crystals which could accumulate over years. Adequate precautions are necessary for the safe and environmentally responsible disposal of azide solution residues.

=== Intentional consumption ===

Sodium azide has gained attention in the Netherlands and abroad as a chemical used for homicidal and suicidal purposes.

Sodium azide has been attributed to at least 172 deaths in the period from 2015 to 2022 as part of an illicit substance used as a suicide aid commonly called &quot;drug X&quot; (Dutch: &quot;middel X&quot;) In 2021, a review of all case reports of sodium azide intoxication indicated that 37% of cases were suicide attempts. An increase in the usage of sodium azide as a suicide drug has been attributed to its availability through pyrotechnics-focused online stores.

=== Treatment ===
The US CDC reports that there is no specific antidote for azide poisoning. A 2021 narrative review identifies several cases of survival from ingestion when the patient is treated with antidotes for cyanide poisoning. From a mechanistic standpoint, hydroxocobalamin is more likely to be helpful than other antidotes such as sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate. As a result, the recommended treatment is hemodynamic support and hydroxocobalamin. First responders should use personal protection equipment to protect themselves from azide exposure.

A 2023 research article reports that hydroxocobalamin reverses azide poisoning in cell cultures, fruit flies, and mice.

A potential future treatment for both azide and cyanide poisioning is trans-[14]-dienyl cobalt(II) (5,7,7,12,14,14-hexamethyl-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradeca-4,11-dienyl cobalt(II), CoN4[14]), which binds to the two ions with higher affinity than hydroxocobalamin &quot;in vitro&quot; and has good efficacy in mice.

<text>Teiaiagon was an Iroquoian village on the east bank of the Humber River in what is now the York district of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It was located along the Toronto Carrying-Place Trail. The site is near the current intersection of Jane Street and Annette Street, at which is situated the community of Baby Point.

The name means &quot;It crosses the stream.&quot;

==History==
Percy Robinson&#x27;s &quot;Toronto During the French Regime&quot; shows Teiaiagon as being a jointly occupied village of Seneca and Mohawk. Helen Tanner&#x27;s &quot;Atlas of Great Lakes Indian History&quot; describes Teiaiagon as a Seneca village around the years 1685-1687, although it existed before that time, and as a Mississauga village around 1696.

Étienne Brûlé passed through Teiaiagon in 1615. The village was on an important route for the developing fur trade industry, and it was also &quot;surrounded by horticultural fields&quot;. It was said to be about &quot;a day&#x27;s journey from the Toronto Lake, our present Lake Simcoe&quot;.

On November 18, 1678, René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle departed Fort Frontenac for Niagara in a brigantine with a crew including La Motte and the Récollet missionary Louis Hennepin, following the north shore of Lake Ontario to mitigate the effects of a storm. The ship was grounded three times, forcing the crew to stop at the mouth of the Humber River on November 26. The surprised inhabitants of the village &quot;were hospitable and supplied them with provisions&quot;. On December 5, the ship set off after being cut out of the ice with axes. Before departing, &quot;La Motte&#x27;s men bartered their commodities with the natives&quot; for corn.

Hennepin and others have recorded that the village was inhabited by as many as 5,000 people and had 50 long houses. La Salle camped at Teiaiagon several other times, once in the summer of 1680, and &quot;perhaps twice in 1681&quot; during his expeditions. There was a burial ground located in the central part of the village.

The Senecas left the village, either pushed out by, or voluntarily for, the Mississaugas by 1701. With the removal of the Iroquois from southern Ontario by the Mississaugas, the Anishinaabe and French trade began to flourish in the region shortly after the Great Peace of Montreal of 1701. Associated with this trade, there was a very small French garrison or Magasin Royal located near the site of Teiaiagon from 1720 to 1730. In 1730, the French garrison was located downriver of the site. A store was later built at the mouth of the Humber in 1750 and Fort Rouillé soon after, east of the Humber.

The Mississaugas did not live at the site of the village of Teiaiagon, but had a village located across the Humber River, on the west bank of the river, near Old Mill Road and Bloor Street, from 1788-1805. James Bâby from Detroit in 1816 acquired the land now called Baby Point and only had orchards located on the site of Teiaiagon. The site was relatively undisturbed as it was not farmed. The Teiaiagon area was acquired by the government for a military fortress and army barracks, but then was sold to Robert Home Smith, who began developing the Baby Point subdivision in 1912. In 1949, at the south-west corner of Baby Point Road and Baby Point Crescent, a plaque was erected, briefly mentioning &quot;Taiaiagon.&quot;

==Cartography==
Possibly because early European explorers had difficulty in transcribing First Nations names into European orthographic systems, numerous spelling variations exist. These include &quot;Taiaiako&#x27;n&quot;, &quot;Taiaiagon&quot;, &quot;Teyeyagon&quot;, and &quot;Toioiugon&quot;.

The name &quot;Teiaigon&quot; appears on a 1688 map of New France drawn by Jean-Baptiste-Louis Franquelin based on &quot;sixteen years&#x27; of observation of the author&quot;. It was indicated to be on the eastern side of a small bay, from which a portage route led to the west branch of Lake Taronto.

==Archeology==
Excavations at Baby Point were first conducted in the late nineteenth century. Records from that excavation have been lost, though it is known that they revealed &quot;traces of palisade walls&quot;. In the late 1990s and early 2000s another excavation, conducted as a result of installation of a natural gas line to the residential neighbourhood, discovered the burial plots of two Seneca women, which were dated to the 1680s. One of the women was buried with a moose antler comb engraved with a rattlesnake-tailed panther, &quot;possibly representing Mishipizheu&quot;, which morphs into a bear. The other woman was buried with three brass rings and a carved moose antler comb depicting &quot;two human figures wearing European-style clothes flanking an Aboriginal figure&quot;. Another burial plot on Baby Point was found in 2010 when a house was being renovated. Artifacts were studied and a ceremonial reburial took place.

Just north of the site, in today&#x27;s Magwood Park, is &quot;Thunderbird Mound&quot;, which is believed to be an ancient burial mound. The site has not been studied for its archaeology. The site is considered threatened by erosion and pedestrian traffic by the Taiaiako&#x27;n Historical Preservation Society.

==Iroquois villages on the north shore of Lake Ontario==

By the late 1660s various Five Nation Iroquois had established seven villages along the shores of Lake Ontario where trails led off into the interior. In addition to Teiaiagon at the mouth of the Humber River, the following settlements have been identified by historian Percy James Robinson:

* Ganneious - on the site of present-day Napanee
* Kente - on the Bay of Quinte
* Kentsio - on Rice Lake
* Ganaraske - on the site of present-day Port Hope
* Ganatsekwyagon - at the mouth of the Rouge River
* Quinaouatoua (or Tinawatawa) - Near modern-day Hamilton

<text>Cape Emine ( ) is a headland located at the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast. It is located south of Varna, north of Burgas and south of Obzor. It forms the tip of Stara Planina. Cape Emine is said to be Bulgaria&#x27;s stormiest cape.

In the Middle Ages, there was a fortress called &quot;Emona&quot; on Cape Emine. Its name was derived from &quot;Aemon&quot;, the ancient name for Stara Planina. Nowadays, only some ruins of the fortress are left. There are also remnants of a monastery and a lighthouse. The village of Emona is located nearby.

Cape Emine is the endpoint of the European walking route E3 (its Bulgarian section is also known as &quot;Kom–Emine&quot;).

<doc id="1172977" wikidata="Q572736" url="?curid=1172977" title="Force 10 from Navarone (film)">
<text>Force 10 from Navarone is a 1978 action war film loosely based on Alistair MacLean&#x27;s 1968 novel of the same name. It is a sequel to the 1961 film &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot;. The parts of Mallory and Miller are played by Robert Shaw (who died before the film was released), and Edward Fox, succeeding in the roles originally portrayed by Gregory Peck and David Niven. It was directed by Guy Hamilton and also stars Harrison Ford, Carl Weathers, Barbara Bach, Franco Nero (in a &quot;plastic surgery&quot; role previously played by Tutte Lemkow), and Richard Kiel.

The film gets its title from the Alistair MacLean book of the same name, but bears so little resemblance to the novel that MacLean loosely adapted part of the screenplay into his 1982 book &quot;Partisans&quot;.

==Plot==
In 1943, sometime after destroying the German fortress, Major Keith Mallory and Sergeant Donovan &quot;Dusty&quot; Miller are sent to find and eliminate Nicolai, a German spy who previously betrayed the Navarone mission to the occupying German army in Greece. Nicolai is now believed to have successfully infiltrated the Yugoslav Partisans under the assumed identity &quot;Captain Lescovar&quot;. To get to Axis-occupied Yugoslavia, Mallory and Miller team up with &quot;Force 10&quot;, an American commando unit led by Rangers lieutenant colonel Mike Barnsby, and steal a Royal Air Force bomber from an air field. They are joined by Weaver, an U.S. Army Medical Corps sergeant who was arrested by the Military Police and escaped, only to be shot down by the Luftwaffe. Only Barnsby, Mallory, Miller, Weaver, and Lieutenant Doug Reynolds make it out and escape the crippled plane in a crash landing.

The survivors come upon a band of men they believe to be the Yugoslavian partisans, but the unit is later suddenly trapped and surprised as their helpers reveal themselves to be pro-German Chetniks, led by Captain Drazak. Taken prisoner, they tell the German army commander in control of the area, Major Schroeder, that they are actually deserters. To keep Schroeder from opening Miller&#x27;s suitcase, which is stuffed with high explosives, Mallory claims it contains the newly developed and top-secret penicillin, which will spoil if opened and exposed. The next morning, the prisoners are told that Schroeder has already opened the case, finding it full of firewood. They improvise an elaborated second excuse, claiming they buried the drug samples. Schroeder sends Barnsby and Mallory to retrieve them under the guard of his concubine Maritza and three soldiers. Miller, Weaver, and Reynolds are left behind in camp.

Far from camp, Maritza kills the Germans and reveals herself to be an actual partisan and the person who had hid the explosives. She directs Mallory and Barnsby towards the real partisan camp, which is under the command of her father, Major Petrovich. Mallory and Barnsby meet another patrol of Yugoslav partisans led by Lescovar, who has gained Petrovich&#x27;s trust, and are taken to their camp, which lies near a hydroelectric dam. An arch bridge spanning the deep river ravine is set to be used by a coming German force for an impending assault on the partisans, who have been unable to destroy the bridge before. Barnsby reveals that the bridge is actually Force 10&#x27;s assigned mission target.

Mallory convinces Petrovich to mount a rescue mission of demolitions expert Miller back at the Chetnik camp, using Lescovar and Marko, another loyal partisan. The four re-enter the Chetnik camp at night, with Mallory and Barnsby posing as captives, and Lescovar and Marko disguised as Chetniks escorting them. Drazak discovers that Maritza must have helped Miller and Mallory escape, and he begins beating her viciously. Schroeder and Reynolds are killed in a gun battle, but the others escape with a badly hurt Maritza and with the recovered explosives.

Miller assesses that the bridge is impregnable, which Barnsby refuses to accept. Mallory hits upon the better idea of destroying the upstream dam, to use the sudden onrush flood of millions of gallons of water to destroy the bridge. A night-time air drop is arranged with Allied Air Forces to replace Force 10&#x27;s lost supplies, but Lescovar, revealed to be the saboteur, calls in German warplanes to stop the drop. Maritza catches Lescovar in the act, but he kills her before she can warn the others, and German planes bomb the illuminated drop zone.

Angered by the botched air drop, Petrovich orders the men to be sent to partisan commander Tito&#x27;s headquarters for transport back to Italy. Accompanied by Lescovar and Marko, the team instead infiltrates the German railroad marshaling yards to steal explosives there. Lescovar again betrays them, alerting a German sergeant to their presence. Marko sacrifices himself to save the others, who escape with Lescovar aboard a train leaving for Sarajevo. Lescovar is questioned by the others, who have finally grown more suspicious of him. Lescovar initially denies the accusations, but gives himself away and is shot dead by Barnsby, who then asks Mallory to return the favour by helping him accomplish Force 10&#x27;s original mission.

Jumping the train near the dam, the team splits up: Miller and Weaver run a diversion, while Mallory and Barnsby sneak into the dam structure. Weaver runs into Captain Drazak and kills him in a knife fight. Mallory and Barnsby set their charges within the concrete dam; its structural integrity compromised by the blast, the dam wall bursts, releasing a torrent of water that topples the bridge downstream. The German assault is thwarted, saving Petrovich and the partisan guerrillas.

Mallory and Barnsby rejoin Miller and Weaver, but Mallory reminds the others they are trapped on the wrong side of the river. As the closing film credits roll, the men begin a strenuous journey back to friendly territory.

==Production==
===Initial development===
There had been plans to produce the film shortly after the 1961 film, with Gregory Peck and David Niven reprising their roles. Following the success of the original film, producer Carl Foreman asked MacLean to write a hardcover sequel novel on which a follow-up film would be based, but the author was reluctant to write an entire novel and instead delivered a screen treatment.

In April 1967 Foreman announced he would make &quot;After Navarone&quot; with Anthony Quinn, Gregory Peck, and David Niven reprising their roles and J Lee Thompson returning as director. The film would be made by Columbia. In May 1967 it was announced the film would be called &quot;The High Dam&quot; and filming would take place in 1969. Filming, however, did not proceed: MacLean decided to develop the screen treatment as a book; he published &quot;Force 10 from Navarone&quot; in 1968, and the novel became a best seller.

Throughout the 1970s Foreman tried to get financial backing for the film. In December 1972 MacLean said Foreman&#x27;s plan was to use the original cast, but commented, &quot;they&#x27;ll look a bit old for the war now.&quot;

===Financing===
In September 1976 it was announced Foreman, Oliver Unger and the German finance company, Mondo Films, had acquired the screen rights to the novel and screenplay &quot;Force 10 from Navarone&quot;. Foreman wrote the treatment and served as executive producer, but Unger wound up producing.

The producers wanted Robert Bolt to write the screenplay but he was busy working with David Lean. Bolt&#x27;s agent Peggy Ramsey suggested they hire Robin Chapman.

In August 1977, the production company set up to make the movie, Navarone Productions, signed an agreement with AIP for the latter to distribute the film. AIP provided $2.1 million of the budget.

The film was originally budgeted at $8,312,224. AIP provided $2,104,942.93 to Navarone Productions and subsequently spent an additional $97,109.15 to produce a U.S. version of the film. Columbia Pictures advanced $2.9 million and agreed to pay an additional $1.1 million after delivery of the film in return for the exclusive and perpetual distribution rights in all territories outside the United States and Canada. A German investment group contributed $1 million, a Yugoslavian production company lent or provided services equal to $2 million; and American Broadcasting Company paid $1.8 million for the right to broadcast the motion picture three times on network television.

Cinematographer Christopher Challis recalled that the film was originally considered to be filmed in Pakistan until someone realised that Pakistanis did not resemble Yugoslavians or Germans and the expense to make them appear as such on film would be financially prohibitive.

===Casting===
By the time film was to start, 17 years after the original, Peck and Niven were considered too old and the decision was made to recast.

By October 1977 the main cast had been settled: Robert Shaw, Edward Fox, Harrison Ford, Franco Nero, Barbara Bach. Shaw said &quot;I find it a bit ridiculous at my age to be running around a mountain in Yugoslavia saying &#x27;Let&#x27;s go&#x27;.&quot;

It was Ford&#x27;s first film after the release of &quot;Star Wars&quot;. He says he picked the part because it was a &quot;strong supporting character&quot; that was &quot;very different from Han Solo. I wanted to avoid being stereotyped as a science fiction type.&quot; Ford later said he did the film &quot;to take advantage of the chance to work. And it was a job I did for the money.&quot;

Fox at the time was best known for &quot;The Day of the Jackal&quot; and playing Edward VIII on television. Caroline Munro said she was offered the female lead but she turned it down because it involved too much nudity.

MacLean was reportedly unhappy with the prominence given to the Barbara Bach character. &quot;She&#x27;s of minimal importance in my novel,&quot; he said.

===Filming===
Filming went for five months starting in late 1977. Shepperton Studios outside London were used for most indoor scenes and included a full-scale mock-up of a Lancaster bomber, while scenes were shot around the Đurđevića Tara Bridge, Montenegro, and Jablanica Dam on Jablaničko Lake in Jablanica, Bosnia and Herzegovina with the assistance of Jadran Film. Scale models of the dam, the valley and the bridge were constructed at the Mediterranean Film Studios in Malta.

President Tito of Yugoslavia authorised his government to assist the production, including providing 2,000 soldiers as extras as well as uniforms and equipment and several Yugoslavian army T-34 tanks. He visited the set.

Some scenes were also shot in the Royal Naval Dockyard (South Yard) in Devonport, Plymouth. During a shot of the railway carriages the letters PSTO(N) can be seen, this stands for Principal Supply and Transport Officer (Navy), and is on Jersey in the Channel Islands.

George MacDonald Fraser was hired to do further work on the script during filming in Yugoslavia, in part because he and Guy Hamilton got along well when both worked on &quot;Superman&quot; (1978). However, Fraser is not credited on the film.

Edward Fox said five people worked on the script. &quot;The action had been laid down but the characters were still stick figures. We had to dress them up and make the lines fit them as we went along.&quot;

Ford said during filming, &quot;I was lost because I didn&#x27;t know what the story was about. I didn&#x27;t have anything to act. There was no reason for my character being there. I had no part of the story that was important to tell. I had a hard time taking the stage with the bull that I was supposed to be doing.&quot;

The bridge over the Tara River, which is the target of the commando operation in the film, was destroyed by partisans in 1942 with the original engineer that built the bridge (Lazar Jauković) involved in the operation to destroy it.

Shaw said during filming that &quot;I&#x27;m seriously thinking that this might be my last film. I no longer have anything real to say. I&#x27;m appalled at some of the lines. I&#x27;m not at ease in film. I can&#x27;t remember the last film I enjoyed making.&quot; Shaw&#x27;s words proved prophetic as he died in August 1978 of a heart attack, before &quot;Navarone&quot; was released. It was his penultimate film, as he was filming &quot;Avalanche Express&quot; when he died.

Filming went over budget to more than $10 million and the completion guarantor had to step in and provide additional funds.

===Musical score===
Composer Ron Goodwin scored the film to the 126-minute version during the summer of 1978. Before the film was released it was shortened to 118 minutes. Additional music cues were created by recycling music from other parts of the film – typically reusing suspense passages in scenes for which they were not written. The CD release of the soundtrack by &quot;Film Score Monthly&quot; chronicles these changes, and presents the score as Goodwin wrote and recorded it for the 126-minute version.

==Release==
After being screened at Camp David as the Thanksgiving film for US President Jimmy Carter, the film was released in the United States on 8 December 1978 to mixed reviews (according to production notes that accompanied the 2000 DVD release).

Before the film came out Maclean said in an interview that the only film he liked made from his writings was &quot;Guns of Navarone&quot; and &quot;I am hopeful this return to &quot;Navarone&quot; will be good too, although the storyline bears little resemblance to what I wrote. Robert Shaw was a good actor, one of the most in demand in the world today. And I am told he did a good job. Whatever, this couldn&#x27;t help be the best [of the recent adaptations of his work for the screen] because the rest were rubbish. But I am not bitter, you understand. The sale of my stories to the movies has been a matter of business – a process from which I usually detach myself.&quot;

The 118-minute cut was released theatrically overseas by Columbia Pictures, which had released &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot;.

==Reception==
Review aggregations website Rotten Tomatoes gives it a score of 67% based on 21 reviews. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film a 2+1⁄2 out of a 4-star rating in his 1979 review. 

Harrison Ford said &quot;It wasn&#x27;t a bad film. There were honest people involved and it was an honest effort. But it wasn&#x27;t the right thing for me to do.&quot;

===Box office===
The film made a quarter of what the original did at the box office.

==Legal action==
Although three producers of the film are deceased (Carl Foreman, Sidney Cohn and Oliver Unger), their estates and surviving producer Peter Gettinger sued Sony Pictures (owner of Columbia Pictures) for unpaid sums from distribution rights. Following a May 2008 trial in the New York Supreme Court, a judgement awarded the producers more than 30 years of funds withheld by Columbia Pictures. Sony appealed, but the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court upheld the initial verdict on 1 September 2009.

<text>Midnight Nation is a religious-themed twelve-issue American comic book limited series created by J. Michael Straczynski and published from 2000 to 2002 by Top Cow Productions under their Joe&#x27;s Comics imprint. It is about a man who is killed, in a sense, and is on a journey to save his soul.

==Synopsis==
Los Angeles police officer Lieutenant David Grey encounters a brutal murder. When he tracks down a possible lead he encounters strange, goblin-like men who attack him. When he awakes, Grey finds himself in a hospital, and those around him have become translucent and can no longer see him. It is explained to him by his mysterious guide Laurel that he has lost his soul and he has now been plunged into a shadow world that runs parallel to our own, filled with people who were forgotten by the world and &quot;fell through the cracks&quot;.

David is told that without his soul he will slowly become like &quot;the Walkers&quot;, the monstrous people he encountered who attacked him. David must travel on foot to New York City where &quot;The Other Guy&quot; (devil) holds his soul. Laurel has guided many others on the same journey before, but none have survived the trip.

Along the way David encounters various tests, such as fighting these Walkers, meeting his future self, slowly losing his mind and his sense of self, and finally falling in love with Laurel, who is not in fact human. He also saves his ex-wife (who had walked out on him years earlier due to his unwavering dedication to his job as a police officer) from the Walkers. He also encounters an enigmatic old man who seems immune to the Walkers attacks and has no fear of them, and is able to drive them away in terror. It is later revealed that he is Lazarus who has been waiting for the return of Jesus Christ since Jesus Christ told him to do so. He is currently watched over by an angel wielding a flaming sword.

When David finally reaches New York, the Other Guy begins to lecture him on things such as life, hope, God, and humanity. He tells him that hope is a lie and that he intends to increase misery around the world until all of humanity becomes like the abandoned and forgotten people he met on his trip through the parallel world. When that is done, he can recreate the world as he sees fit. He then forces David to feel all the suffering humanity has felt over its existence, which causes him to go insane and run through the streets as one of the Walkers. He sees a mannequin that resembles Laurel in a shop window, and returns to the citadel, finding Laurel being nailed to a circular wooden board.

The Other Guy tells him that Laurel was lying to him about his soul: if he recovers it he will become one of the Walkers; if he does not, he will cease to belong to either world. The Other Guy also informs him that if he gives his soul to Laurel, she will cease to be an agent of God (for that is what she truly is), she will be reborn as a human. David pushes his soul into Laurel, and is drawn back into the real world, where he is transported to a hospital and eventually reunited with his estranged wife. He discovers he has the ability to still perceive people who have fallen through the cracks, and eventually is taken by Lazarus to the meeting with his past self, and then to a meeting with the reborn Laurel, now a happy teenage girl.

==Collected editions==
The comic ran for 12 issues, along with one one-shot story (a &quot;Wizard&quot; #1/2 edition), and was collected as a softcover trade paperback in 2003 ().

A deluxe, oversized hardcover edition was released in 2009. It includes&quot; Midnight Nation&quot; #1-12, the&quot; Wizard&quot; #1/2 issue, a cover gallery, and extras such as a script, layout page, and super-gloss poster ().

==TV adaptation==
In July 2016, Bleeding Cool reported that Straczynski was producing a TV series with Gale Anne Hurd and was writing the pilot script.

<doc id="1172987" wikidata="Q55218" url="?curid=1172987" title="István Szabó">
<text>István Szabó (; born 18 February 1938) is a Hungarian film director, screenwriter, and opera director.

Szabó is one of the most notable Hungarian filmmakers and one who has been best known outside the Hungarian-speaking world since the late 1960s. Working in the tradition of European auteurism, he has made films that represent many of the political and psychological conflicts of Central Europe&#x27;s recent history, as well as of his own personal history. He made his first short film in 1959 as a student at the Academy of Drama and Film in Budapest, and his first feature film in 1964.

He achieved his greatest international success with &quot;Mephisto&quot; (1981) for which he was awarded an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Since then, most of Szabó&#x27;s films have been international co-productions filmed in a variety of languages and European locations. However, he has continued to make films in Hungarian, and even in his international co-productions he has often filmed in Hungary using Hungarian talent. 

In 2006, weekly Hungarian magazine &quot;Élet és Irodalom&quot; (&quot;Life and Literature&quot; in English) published an article revealing that Szabó had been an informant of the Communist regime&#x27;s secret police.

==Life==
Born in Budapest, Szabó is the son of Mária (née Vita) and István Szabó, the latter of whom was a doctor from a long line of doctors. Szabó came from a family of Jews who had converted to Catholicism, but were considered Jews by the Arrow Cross Party (Hungarian fascists). They were forced to separate and hide in Budapest sometime between 15 October 1944, when Nazi Germany deposed the Hungarian government for trying to sign an armistice with the Allies, installing the Arrow Cross in power, and 13 February 1945, when the Soviets defeated the German Army in Budapest. Szabó survived by hiding at an orphanage, but his father died of diphtheria shortly after the German defeat. Memories of these events would later appear in several of his films.

In 2006, weekly Hungarian magazine &quot;Élet és Irodalom&quot; (&quot;Life and Literature&quot; in English) published an article revealing he had been an informant for the Communist regime&#x27;s secret police. Between 1957 and 1961, he submitted 48 reports on 72 people, mostly classmates and teachers at the Academy of Drama and Film in Budapest. According to historian István Deák, in only one case did Szabó&#x27;s informing cause significant damage, when an individual was denied a passport. After the article was published, over 100 prominent intellectuals, including some of those about whom Szabó had made reports, published a letter of support for him. Szabó&#x27;s initial response to the article was that informing had been an act of bravery, since he had intended to save the life of his former classmate Pál Gábor. When this claim turned out not to be true, Szabó admitted that his true motive had been to prevent his own expulsion from the Academy. Author Anna Porter asserted that &quot;whether this is true or not is impossible to prove as not much has remained of Szabó&#x27;s file and as revelations about the murky past of prominent figures such as Szabó have become mired in controversy.&quot;

In a 2001 interview, Szabó revealed that he believes in God, but considers the subject personal and does not like to talk about it.

==Career==

===Pre–1964===
As a child, Szabó wanted to be a doctor like his father. By the age of 16, however, had been inspired by a book by Hungarian film theorist Béla Balázs to become a film director. After finishing high school, he was one of 11 applicants out of 800 who were admitted to the Academy of Drama and Film in Budapest, where he studied under Félix Máriássy, who became something of a father figure to him. His classmates included Judit Elek, Zsolt Kézdi-Kovács, János Rózsa, Pál Gábor, Imre Gyöngyössy, Ferenc Kardos, and Zoltán Huszárik. During this period, Szabó directed several short films, most notably his thesis film, &quot;Koncert&quot; (1963), which earned a prize at the International Short Film Festival Oberhausen. Subsequently he was apprenticed to the head of the Hunnia Film Studio, János Herskó, which resulted in an opportunity to direct his first feature film at the age of 25, rather than having to spend ten years working as an assistant director.

The beginning of Szabó&#x27;s career coincided with the beginning of a “new wave” in Hungarian cinema, one of several new wave cinemas that occurred around this time throughout Western and Eastern Europe. The new wave in Eastern Europe began against a backdrop of political liberalization, the decentralization of film industries, and the emergence of films as valuable commodities for export to Western European markets. The resulting films were more formally experimental, politically anti-establishment, and, especially in the case of Szabó, psychologically probing than the films of the previous generation . Hungarian filmmakers in particular experienced a significant increase in freedom of expression due to the reforms of the Kádár government.

===Hungarian films, 1964–1980===
Szabó&#x27;s first feature film, &quot;The Age of Illusions&quot; (1964), is a partly autobiographical film about the problems Szabó&#x27;s generation had starting their careers, dealing with the older generation, and developing romantic relationships. The appearance of a poster for François Truffaut&#x27;s &quot;The 400 Blows&quot; in the background of a scene suggests Szabó&#x27;s artistic compatibility with Truffaut and the French New Wave. The film won the Silver Sail for Best First Work at the Locarno International Film Festival and a Special Jury Prize for Best Director at the Hungarian Film Festival.

&quot;Father&quot; (1966) is a coming-of-age story that displays Szabó&#x27;s increasing fascination with history and his childhood memories. The plot covers events from the Arrow Cross Party dictatorship to the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, revolving around the disorientation and self-awareness of a generation that had to grow up without a father figure in wartime. The main character replaces the image of his absent father with fantasy images that change over time. These events take place during a period of his life when he begins to transition to adulthood. Finally, he is able to face the reality of his situation and comes to understand that he has to rely on his own strength rather than that of an idealized father figure. The film won the Grand Prix at the 5th Moscow International Film Festival and the Special Jury Prize at Locarno, and established Szabó as the most internationally famous Hungarian filmmaker of his time, as well as an auteur in the European film tradition. In 2000, &quot;Father&quot; appeared as number 11 on a list of the 12 best Hungarian films according to a group of Hungarian film critics.

&quot;Lovefilm&quot; (1970) focuses on a young man&#x27;s relationship with his childhood sweetheart, told through flashbacks that include the Arrow Cross dictatorship and 1956, and rendered in an experimental, fragmented form. This experimental tendency in Szabó&#x27;s films reached its apotheosis in &quot;25 Fireman Street&quot; (1973), which began as a short film, &quot;Dream About a House&quot; (1971). &quot;25 Fireman Street&quot; takes place during the course of a long, hot night in Budapest, during which the residents of a single apartment building are plagued by dream-memories of pain and loss spanning thirty years, including both World Wars, the Arrow Cross dictatorship, the Communist takeover, and 1956. While the film won the top prize at Locarno, Szabó was upset by its lack of success at the box office and at film festivals. Attributing this lack of success to the film&#x27;s complex structure, he decided to give his next film a simpler structure.

In &quot;Budapest Tales&quot; (1976), Szabó traded his earlier, complex narrative structures, characterized by flashbacks and dreams, for a more linear one. At the same time, he traded the literal representation of history for an allegorical one. The film follows a disparate group of people who come together on the outskirts of an unnamed city at the end of an unnamed war to repair a damaged tram and ride it into the city. Allegorically, the film was interpreted by critics variously as representing Hungarian history specifically or universal human responses to war and reconstruction more generally.

Szabó&#x27;s first four full-length films featured the actor András Bálint in roles based on Szabó himself. While Bálint also appeared in &quot;Budapest Tales&quot;, this was Szabó&#x27;s first feature film that did not contain a significant amount of autobiographical material. He did not make another autobiographical film until &quot;Meeting Venus&quot;, eighteen years later.

&quot;Budapest Tales&quot; was even less successful than &quot;25 Fireman Street&quot; at the box office and festivals. According to author David Paul, this may explain why Szabó shifted gears even more dramatically in his next film, &quot;Confidence&quot; (1980), in which historical events are represented straightforwardly, and are filtered through neither memory nor allegory. The film focuses on the relationship between a man and woman who are forced to share a room as they hide from the Arrow Cross toward the end of the Second World War. It garnered a Best Director award for Szabó at the Berlin Film Festival and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 53rd Academy Awards.

===International co-productions featuring Brandauer, 1981–1988===
Szabó&#x27;s next three films constituted a new phase in his career—moving away from Hungarian productions, in Hungarian, written by Szabó alone, and featuring Bálint, and moving toward international co-productions, in German, written by Szabó in collaboration with others, and featuring Austrian actor Klaus Maria Brandauer. The informal trilogy—&quot;Mephisto&quot; (1981), &quot;Colonel Redl&quot; (1985) and &quot;Hanussen&quot; (1988)—features Brandauer in a series of roles based on historical figures who, as represented in the films, compromised their morals in order to climb the ladder of success within a context of authoritarian political power. In &quot;Mephisto&quot;, based on a novel by Klaus Mann, Brandauer plays an actor and theater director in Nazi Germany, a role based on Mann&#x27;s former brother-in-law Gustaf Gründgens. The film won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and the award for Best Screenplay at the Cannes Film Festival, and greatly increased Szabó&#x27;s international prestige.

In &quot;Colonel Redl&quot;, Brandauer plays Alfred Redl, counter-intelligence chief of the Austro-Hungarian Empire who was blackmailed into espionage for the Russians in order to prevent the revelation of his homosexuality. The film won top awards in Germany and the UK, but provoked a scandal in Austria, where several periodicals accused the film of bringing the country into disrepute. In &quot;Hanussen&quot;, Brandauer plays the real life clairvoyant performer Erik Jan Hanussen, whose growing fame brings him into increasingly close—and dangerous—contact with the Nazis.

===1991–present===
After his Brandauer trilogy, Szabó continued to make international co-productions, filming in a variety of languages and European locations. He has continued to make some films in Hungarian, however, and even in his international co-productions, he often films in Hungary and uses Hungarian talent.

&quot;Meeting Venus&quot; (1991), the first of several English-language films directed by Szabó—and his first comedy—is based on his experience directing &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; at the Paris Opera in 1984. Niels Arestrup plays a Hungarian directing the opera at an imaginary pan-European opera company, and encountering a multitude of pitfalls that symbolize the challenges of a united Europe.

With &quot;Sweet Emma, Dear Böbe&quot; (1992), Szabó returned to a strictly Hungarian subject—this time, however, focused on a contemporary, rather than historical, social problem. The film follows two young, female teachers of Russian facing the obsolescence of their specialty after the fall of the socialist government, as well as a variety of types of sexual harassment in the new Hungary. The film won the top prize at the Berlin Film Festival.

&quot;Sunshine&quot; (1999)—a three-hour historical epic, and an English-language, international co-production—was viewed by many critics as Szabó&#x27;s most ambitious film, and, along with &quot;Mephisto&quot;, his most important. Hungary&#x27;s Jews had figured in either a marginal or coded fashion in several of Szabó&#x27;s earlier films, produced during the socialist period when discourse around the history of the country&#x27;s Jews was more circumscribed. In &quot;Sunshine&quot;, for the first time, Szabó focused explicitly on this aspect of Hungarian history, which he himself had experienced as a child during the Arrow Cross dictatorship. Ralph Fiennes plays three generations in the Sonnenschein family as they experience the trials of twentieth-century Hungarian Jewish history, from the late Austro-Hungarian Empire through the Holocaust to the 1956 Revolution.

Several characters are based on real people, including the Zwack family, with their successful liquor business, the Olympic fencer Attila Petschauer, and the Jewish police official Ernö Szücs. The film won European Film Awards for Best Screenwriter, Best Actor, and Best Cinematographer. It received a rating of 74% Fresh from review aggregator &quot;Rotten Tomatoes&quot;.

An example of an extremely positive review was that of Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, who called it “a movie of substance and thrilling historical sweep.” A. O. Scott of the &quot;New York Times&quot; had a more mixed reaction, writing that, by the end, “the movie has accumulated sufficient power and momentum to erase the memory of its earlier awkwardness. It shows such sympathy for its characters, and approaches its subject with such intelligence, that it&#x27;s easy to forgive the clumsy editing, the haphazard insertion of black-and-white newsreels, and the hyperventilating sexual ardor that seems to be a Sors family curse.”

In &quot;Taking Sides&quot; (2001), Szabó returned to thematic territory he had explored in &quot;Mephisto&quot;. Stellan Skarsgård plays real life German conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler, and Harvey Keitel a U.S. Army investigator interrogating Furtwängler about his collaboration with the Nazis. The film won several awards at the Mar del Plata Film Festival in Argentina, including Best Director.

&quot;Being Julia&quot; (2004), based on a novel by W. Somerset Maugham, stars Annette Bening as a famous British actress experiencing a series of romantic and professional rivalries. Bening won a Golden Globe Award for her performance.

In 2005, Szabó was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 27th Moscow International Film Festival.

&quot;Rokonok&quot; (2006) was a Hungarian production based on a 1932 novel by Zsigmond Móricz about political corruption. Sándor Csányi plays a newly elected attorney general whose relatives (rokonok) come out of the woodwork looking for favors. It was entered into the 28th Moscow International Film Festival.

&quot;The Door&quot; (2012), an English language production based on a Hungarian novel by Magda Szabó (no relation), focuses on the relationship between an affluent novelist (Martina Gedeck) and her poor, mysterious maid (Helen Mirren). It opened the 13th Tbilisi International Film Festival and won the Michael Curtiz Audience Award at the Hungarian Film Festival of Los Angeles.

Szabó&#x27;s frequent collaborators have included actors András Bálint, Klaus Maria Brandauer, Péter Andorai, and Ildikó Bánsági; cinematographer Lajos Koltai; and screenwriters Péter Dobai and Andrea Vészits.

===Themes===
Several interconnected themes run through Szabó&#x27;s films, the most common being the relationship between the personal and the political or historical. On the personal level, his first three feature films deal with coming of age issues, but political/historical events form the backdrop of these issues and continually rupture the attempts of the characters to lead their private lives. In an interview in 2008, Szabó said, “My mother once told me, &#x27;We had a nice childhood and our youth was beautiful, but our life was destroyed by politics and history.&#x27;” The political/historical events most commonly depicted are the dominant traumatic events of mid-20th century Hungarian and Central European history—Nazism, the Second World War, and, in Hungary—or, more accurately, Budapest—the Arrow Cross dictatorship and the Holocaust, the Communist takeover, and the 1956 Revolution. Szabó himself has frequently referred to this theme as the search for security.

A related theme is the moral compromises individuals make in order to succeed in immoral political systems. In an interview about &quot;Taking Sides&quot;, Szabó said, “I don&#x27;t think that life is possible without making compromises. The question is only one of limits: how far to go. When one crosses the line, then the compromise starts to be a bad, even deadly, one.” This theme is dominant in the Brandauer trilogy and, as Istvan Deak points out, may be related to Szabó&#x27;s own collaboration with the Communist secret police.

Another closely related theme is the arts—most often theater, but also music and film itself. In several of Szabó&#x27;s films—most famously in &quot;Mephisto&quot;—artists become caught up in conflicts around politics, role-playing, and identity.

===Style===
Szabó&#x27;s early films—culminating in &quot;Lovefilm&quot; and &quot;25 Fireman Street&quot;—were influenced by the French New Wave in their experimentation with flashbacks, dream sequences, and unconventional narrative structures built on these techniques.

Szabó emphasizes iconography in his films, insofar as he tends to invest certain objects and places with symbolic meaning. Tram cars play this role in many of his films, and one becomes the central image in &quot;Budapest Tales&quot;. Budapest itself plays an important role in many of his films, including scenes of the Danube and of buildings Szabó lived in when he was a child.

Acting also plays a key role in Szabó&#x27;s films, as he values psychological complexity in his central characters. In his first several features, he tended to use the same lead actors over and over—first András Bálint, then Klaus Maria Brandauer. Consistent with this focus on acting, he frequently employs long close-up shots to emphasize the play of emotions on the faces of his characters.

===Other work===
In addition to writing and directing films, Szabó has also served in a variety of other capacities in the film industry, including writing and directing television movies and episodes, short films, and documentaries, as well as serving as assistant director, screenwriter, producer, and actor in films directed by others. In 1969, he was a member of the jury at the 6th Moscow International Film Festival.

Szabó has directed several operas, including &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; in Paris, &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; in Leipzig, &quot;Il Trovatore&quot; in Vienna, and &quot;Three Sisters&quot; in Budapest. He has taught at film schools in Budapest, London, Berlin, and Vienna. In 1989, he was one of the founding members of the European Film Academy, and, in 1992, of the Széchenyi Academy of Literature and Arts.

<text>A UK Restricted Service Licence (often called an RSL) is typically granted to radio stations and television stations broadcasting within the UK to serve a local community or a special event. Licences are granted by the broadcasting authority Ofcom (formerly the Radio Authority and the Independent Television Commission, respectively).

==History==

In 1972, the Independent Broadcasting Authority was created and given responsibility for regulating independent television and radio services in the UK. 

Over time, the demand for local services increased, and finally prompted an Act of Parliament to deregulate the respective industries and facilitate new long-term and short-term broadcast licences. 

In 1990, the Broadcasting Act 1990 became law, and led to the establishment of two licensing authorities: the Radio Authority to license new radio services and monitor existing licences, and the Independent Television Commission, to license new short-term television services. 

While the 1990 act proved successful, licensing procedures remained restrictive compared to those in other countries.

In 2004, the Radio Authority and ITC were folded into the Office of Communications. Today Ofcom handles all licensing for frequencies used by television and radio services. 

Until May 2015 short-range broadcasts and wireless links, and other programme makers frequencies were licensed by JFMG (Joint Frequency Management Group), owned by Arqiva. In May 2015 Ofcom made the decision to end the contract with Arqiva and to in-source the existing services.

==Radio==
Short-term RSLs are typically broadcast on low-power FM (1 W–25 W) or AM (1 W) and can generally last a maximum of 28 consecutive days and can only be applied for twice in twelve months with four complete months separating the two broadcast periods (and only once in twelve months inside Greater London) by the same applicant/group.

They are generally used for special events, sporting events, religious festivals, student radio, hospital radio or to trial a radio project in preparation for an application for a permanent licence. Long-term RSLs (typically broadcast on low-power AM, but more recently in remote areas on low-power FM as well) are used for radio stations broadcasting to closed areas of private land such as university campuses and hospitals. They can be compared with the low-power broadcasting movement in the United States. Channel Travel Radio broadcast a travel news service using a Long-term RSL licence along part of the M20 motorway in East Kent. The service operated on 107.6MHz from 1995 to 2000.

A number of stations that ran several RSL broadcasts in the 1990s and early 2000s have since gone on to run full-time radio stations. The first FM RSL license was issued on 5th July 1988 to Radio Thamesmead (south-east London) for the Thamesmead Town show on the weekend of 23–24 July 1988. The license fee was £700 for the transmission on 104.3MHz at 1W ERP. The station later obtained a full-time license operating as RTM Radio.

===Radio stations broadcasting under a Restricted Service Licence===

Some example stations broadcast with RSLs (with more than a single appearance)

*Worthy FM (Glastonbury Festival)
*103 The Eye, previously TWCFM, awarded the first full-time community radio licence in UK 1.11.2005 for Melton Mowbray by Ofcom
*Radio Caroline, former offshore &quot;pirate&quot; radio station now available on satellite and Internet Radio
*Phoenix FM, community radio station in Brentwood which broadcast 12 RSLs before being awarded a full-time licence by Ofcom
*Don FM, London pirate radio station
*Blink FM, a youth radio station operating at selected times annually in south Buckinghamshire
*Takeover Radio, children&#x27;s radio service in Leicester
*XFM (London)
*KMFM Maidstone, previously CTR 105.6 and 20/20FM
*Huntingdon Community Radio (Huntingdon), now awarded a full-time licence by Ofcom and known as HCRfm

*Chaine FM, Christmas radio station, broadcasting each December in Larne, Northern Ireland

==Television==

RSLs were also issued to television stations and other organisations which wished to cover a very small area. These licences (also known as Restricted Television Service Licences or RTS licences) restrict power, and hence range, but not operating hours. These licences are valid for four years, and must be competed for on renewal.

The first local TV station to go on the air in the UK with an analogue RSL licence was TV12 on the Isle of Wight. It commenced broadcasting in October 1998 from the main ITV/BBC transmitter at Rowridge. TV12&#x27;s studios were initially at the Medina Centre in Newport – later moving to retail premises in the town centre and finally a factory unit on the outskirts of the town. Initially a staff of more than 25 made hundreds of hours of local programmes – most of which were filmed on location in and around the island.

Later local TV licences were awarded for stations in Belfast, Bristol, Cardiff, Carlisle, Coleraine, Derry, Dundee, Edinburgh, Fawley, Glasgow, Hertford, Lanarkshire, Leicester, Limavady, Manchester, Northampton, Norwich, Oxford, Portsmouth, Reading, Southampton, Swansea, Taunton, Teesside, Ware, Wellington, and York.

In light of the national switch-over from analogue to digital TV the television regulator, Ofcom, extended several analogue Local TV licences until local digital switchover became due in each respective area. This process was complete in October 2012. Meanwhile, in February 2009 bids were invited for auctions for the first local digital multiplex licences to be offered in the UK – the first two of which were awarded shortly thereafter. However the awarding of additional licences was halted in favour of a network of local broadcasters.

<doc id="1173001" wikidata="Q2521405" url="?curid=1173001" title="Sallustius Lucullus">
<text>Sallustius Lucullus (possibly died 89 or 93 AD) was a governor of Roman Britain during the late 1st century AD, holding office after Gnaeus Julius Agricola, although it is unclear whether he was the immediate successor or if there was another unknown governor in between. Lucullus has been described as &quot;an enigma&quot;, as the only definite fact known about him is Suetonius&#x27; report that the emperor Domitian had him executed for allowing a new type of lance to be named after him. 

Anything more about Lucullus is conjecture or inference: for example, since every other known governor of Roman Britain had been a consul prior to being appointed governor, it is reasonable to assume Lucullus also had been consul; since all of the consuls from the year 85 until past the death of Domitian are known, he must have been consul before the year 85. Although it is not known in which year he was executed, Sheppard Frere wrote, &quot;the most likely date for his execution is 89, and the most likely reason is that he was thought to be involved in the conspiracy of Saturninus, legate of Upper Germany which was suppressed that spring.&quot; However, Domitian is also known to have executed a number of Senators in the year 93 for a number of reasons, so that is also a likely date.

It is also possible that Lucullus was the grandson of King Cunobeline (died 40 AD) and was also likely the son of Adminius (died after 43 AD), both of the Catuvellauni tribe.

== Enigma ==
Nothing is known of him for certain other than the story recorded by Suetonius. This story may mask another reason for Lucullus&#x27; execution; that so little is known has led to a number of theories about him.

Ronald Syme, noting the difficulty of polyonymous names, proposed identifying Lucullus with a known suffect consul of 89, Publius Sallustius Blaesus. Blaesus is known from the correspondence of Pliny the Younger and a number of inscriptions, most notably the &quot;Acta Arvalia&quot;, which record his presence at their ceremonies during the years 77 through 91, when there is a gap in the &quot;Acta&quot;, and when it resumes in 101, Blaesus is missing. For this and related reasons Syme identified the two as the same person. His arguments were accepted by later experts, such as Anthony Birley and Edward Champlin. However, P. Conole and Brian Jones point out since the records of the Arval Brethren &quot;record his presence in Rome during every year of the first half of Domitian&#x27;s reign for which complete minutes have survived, it is difficult to see how he could have managed to gain sufficient provincial experience in praetorian posts to merit appointment to Britain, an Imperial consular province.&quot;

A second theory was proposed by Dr. Miles Russell of Bournemouth University. An inscription from Chichester, recorded by Samuel Woodford in his &quot;Inscriptionum Romano-Britannicarum Conllectio&quot; (1658) but since lost, refers to Sallustius Lucullus, giving his &quot;praenomen&quot; as Gaius and describing him as a propraetorian legate of the emperor Domitian. Another inscription from Chichester, discovered in 1923, refers to a &quot;Lucullus, son of Amminus&quot;. Russell argues that this is the same Lucullus, and that his father was the native British prince Amminus, son of Cunobelinus, who fled to Rome c. 40. He also argues that Fishbourne Roman Palace, near Chichester, was built for Sallustius Lucullus as governor, rather than, as is often argued, for the client king Tiberius Claudius Cogidubnus. Although other archaeologists have dated the construction of the palace to c. 73, Russell&#x27;s reinterpretation of the ground plan and finds leads him to date the palace after 92, which would be consistent with Lucullus rather than Cogidubnus as its occupant. However, other scholars argue against Russell&#x27;s identification of the Lucullus of either inscription with the Roman governor. Woodford&#x27;s missing inscription was dismissed as a fake by R. G. Collingwood and R. P. Wright in their &quot;Roman Inscriptions of Britain&quot; (1965): its mention of Domitian, whose name was removed from public inscriptions following his &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot;, argues for its inauthenticity, moreover the governors of Britain were ex-consuls, not ex-praetors. Russell&#x27;s restoration of the second inscription () produces a text which does not follow Roman naming conventions, and the altar the inscription is part of is not worthy of either a Celtic prince or a Roman governor, and omits any mention of the dedicant&#x27;s rank.

A third theory was proposed by Conole and Jones, identifying this Lucullus with the Lucius Lucullus who was proconsul of Hispania Baetica, and a student of marine life, at the time Pliny the Elder wrote his &quot;Natural History&quot; (c. 77). This Lucullus would have been of appropriate rank to be appointed governor of Britain at the right date. Moreover, since it appears that although they are not the same person, Sallustius Blaesus is a relative of Lucullus, and Blaesus was appointed suffect consul the same year of Saturninus&#x27; unsuccessful revolt, Lucullus&#x27; execution had nothing to do with Saturninus&#x27; actions. Brian Jones develops this scenario further in his study of Domitian. There Jones states that Gaius Julius Karus was awarded &quot;dona militaria&quot; comprising three crowns and a silver spearshaft for an otherwise unknown British war -- an exceptional decoration, and equivalent to the decorations Domitian awarded the man who crushed Saturninus&#x27; revolt. Jones proposes the following theory: Lucullus opposed Domitian&#x27;s plans to move the frontier of Roman Britain south to a more defensible location; these views and associated acts were reported by Karus; the emperor Domitian saw this opposition as treason, and gave Karus orders to eliminate Lucullus, who was rewarded generously. Nevertheless, Jones re-iterates that this reconstruction of events surrounding Lucullus &quot;should be regarded as speculative.&quot;

==Military activity==
Archaeology can tell us something of Roman military activity in the years following Agricola&#x27;s recall in 84. Sallustius (or his unknown predecessor, if one existed) may have attempted to consolidate Agricola&#x27;s victories in Scotland by building the Glen Forts which Peter Salway dates to his rule. Forts at Ardoch and Dalswinton in southern Scotland, which Agricola had built, were extensively rebuilt in the late 80s and evidence of improvements of other military installations in the region points to a strong presence in the Scots Lowlands.

Inchtuthil was abandoned around this time as well, however, and it is likely that demands for troops elsewhere in the empire denied Sallustius enough manpower to continue to hold the far north. There is archaeological evidence that some of the Roman watchtowers in northern Scotland remained occupied until 90, however.

All in all, it is likely that troop shortages forced Sallustius to withdraw from northern Scotland but still permitted him to occupy the south.

<doc id="1173004" wikidata="Q5306386" url="?curid=1173004" title="Dream Job">
<text>Dream Job is an American reality televisionseries made by ESPN, which premieredon February 22, 2004. It was the network&#x27;s second reality show, with two editions of &quot;Beg, Borrow &amp; Deal&quot; having previously aired. However, this was the first reality show from a network to offer its winner an on-air place on one of its shows. The show was hosted by Stuart Scott.

==Summary==
The premise of &quot;Dream Job&quot; was to find a new anchor for ESPN&#x27;s popular sports news program, &quot;SportsCenter&quot;. The winner of &quot;Dream Job&quot; would get a one-year contract with the network, and would play a trivia quiz on &quot;SportsCenter&quot; to determine her or his annual salary. The winner would also receive a new Mazda 3. Every week, either one or two contestants would be cut from the show as the American viewing public and the show&#x27;s judging panel were allowed the power of whom they wanted to be cut from the show.

==Season 1==

===Contestants===
In September 2003, the show&#x27;s producers went on a nationwide talent search to find those who wanted a chance to be an ESPN anchor. Over 10,000 people attended the talent search across the United States. The field was narrowed down to 10 contestants who would compete in the televised finals, which started in the Winter of 2004. Originally, the show wanted 11 contestants, 10 from the nationwide search, and another from a contest that was being sponsored by the popular fast food chain Wendy&#x27;s. A 12th contestant would be selected as an alternate.

The last 12 contestants still in the running on the premiere episode ranged in ages from 21 to 40. They were:
* Maggie Haskins, the youngest contestant, a Chicago native who was a full-time student at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. Haskins was originally the alternate, but producers later changed their minds and she competed from the show&#x27;s first episode.
* Michael Quigley, the oldest contestant, an auto parts salesman from Lansdowne, Pennsylvania. Quigley quickly became known for his over-the-top anchoring style, similar to a play-by-play announcer.
* Aaron Levine, 21, a senior at Stanford University
* Mike Hall, 22, a senior at the University of Missouri
* Casey Stern, 25, an executive recruiter from Bellmore, New York
* Zachariah Selwyn, 28, an actor and a musician from Los Angeles
* Nick Stevens, 29, a Brooklyn-based comedian
* Chris Williams, 31, an attorney from Boston
* Chet Anekwe, 38, a Nigerian-born computer programmer from Jersey City
* Alvin Williams, 38, a retail manager from Montgomery, Alabama (Williams won the contest sponsored by Wendy&#x27;s to become a contestant on the show)
* Kelly Milligan, 38, a Dallas attorney
* Lori Rubinson, 39, from New York City, now a host at WFAN

=== Judges ===
The judging panel consisted of:
* Tony Kornheiser, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; columnist and author, and co-host of ESPN&#x27;s talk show, &quot;Pardon the Interruption&quot;.
* Kit Hoover, a former Fox News correspondent, cast member on the inaugural season of MTV&#x27;s &quot;Road Rules&quot;, and co-host of the ESPN2 morning show, &quot;Cold Pizza&quot;.
* LaVar Arrington, a former NFL linebacker, who at the time played for the Washington Redskins.
* Al Jaffe, the Vice President of Talent at ESPN.

The judging panel&#x27;s job consisted of giving criticism to the contestants after performing a task on the show and cutting contestants.

=== Episodes ===
There was one segment that recurred each week on the show called &quot;My SportsCenter.&quot; Each contestant was to read a highlight, or, as they did in week 4, introduce packages done by the person they were co-anchoring their segment with. Each show also consisted of a different sporting event. These ranged from an analysis of the NCAA men&#x27;s basketball tournament to the &quot;Al Jaffe Sports Quiz&quot;, which is given to every on-air personality who applies for a job at ESPN.

The first two weeks of the show saw the contestants split into groups of 6, and each doing the &quot;My SportsCenter&quot; segment solo. To break a tie between Chris Williams and Michael Quigley at the end of the first show, Scott called a network executive who made the final decision to cut Chris Williams. Alvin Williams was cut the following week. In week 3, on March 7, 2004, the &quot;My SportsCenter&quot; segment became co-anchored, and Quigley and Rubenson were voted off. For the &quot;My SportsCenter&quot; segment in week 4, on March 14, 2004, all the eight remaining contestants were sent to Florida to do reports on Major League Baseball teams in Spring Training. Stevens and Chet Anekwe were cut. A special episode chronicling the nationwide search was shown the night after. In week 5, on March 21, 2004, &quot;My SportsCenter&quot; again became a solo segment, with each contestant reading two highlight packages, both on the NCAA men&#x27;s basketball tournament. The Al Jaffe Sports Quiz took place that night as well. Each of the six remaining contestants were asked five questions. Selwyn scored highest, answering three questions correctly. After the segment, though, host Scott called out Haskins and Hall. Two days earlier, on March 19, 2004, the entertainment section of the &quot;New York Post&quot; ran a brief paragraph that stated that Hall and Haskins had been dating for some time. When asked, they confirmed the article&#x27;s truth, but not directly. Amidst all the romance talk, Stern and Milligan were cut that night.

==== Finale ====
The two-hour finale, airing on March 28, 2004, would determine who the new &quot;SportsCenter&quot; anchor would be. In the first hour, only the judges would determine who got cut. Haskins and Selwyn, arguably the most popular contestants on the show, were cut, leaving Levine and Hall in the championship round. Haskins was tabbed by Jaffe as the show&#x27;s most improved contestant. She was praised for having the best writing during her time on the show. When making the decision to cut Selwyn, Kornheiser said, &quot;I probably just made a mistake.&quot; In hour two, the American viewing public would cut one more contestant. At the end of the night, Levine was cut by garnering 60% of the viewers&#x27; votes. Mike Hall was the first ever &quot;Dream Job&quot; winner.

Later that night on &quot;SportsCenter&quot;, Hall took his sports quiz and correctly answered 5 questions. Each correct answer was worth $5,000, increasing his first-year salary from $70,000 to $95,000. He graduated from the University of Missouri on May 15, 2004. He started his tenure as a regular &quot;SportsCenter&quot; anchor on July 19, 2004. He had done some on-air work for ESPNEWS before officially joining &quot;SportsCenter&quot;.

As for Selwyn, he became a color commentator on the Game Show Network series, &quot;Extreme Dodgeball&quot;, which began on June 15, 2004. He also hosted three episodes of &quot;Around the Horn&quot;, which some believe may have been a trial of sorts to determine if he was worthy to replace Tony Reali. He currently can be seen on &quot;Attack of the Show&quot; on G4.

==Season 2==

David Holmes won season 2 of &quot;Dream Job&quot;.

==Season 3==

=== Judges ===
All five judges from Season 2 returned: &quot;The Denver Post&quot; columnist, &quot;Cold Pizza&quot; contributor, and &quot;Around the Horn&quot; panelist Woody Page; former &quot;Cold Pizza&quot; co-host Kit Hoover (who actually made her final appearance on &quot;Cold Pizza&quot; during this &quot;Dream Job&quot; season); &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; writer and ESPN NBA analyst who was judging possible colleagues, Stephen A. Smith; and ESPN executive vice-president of talent, Al Jaffe.
Voting stayed the same. Each judge and the American viewing public was given one vote each to cut a contestant with. In the event of a tie between contestants, America&#x27;s vote would be the tie-breaker.

=== Contestants ===
The show&#x27;s contestants were six former NBA stars vying to become ESPN&#x27;s next NBA analyst:
* Dennis Scott, who spent most of his career with the Orlando Magic
* Dee Brown, who is most famous for winning the 1991 slam dunk contest with a no-look dunk while playing for the Boston Celtics (he also played for the Toronto Raptors and the Magic before retiring)
* Matt Bullard, who won an NBA championship with the Houston Rockets in 1994
* Darryl Dawkins, who, in 1975, became the first high school player ever to be drafted directly into the league
* J.R. Reid, who averaged double figures in scoring during his first three years in the NBA
* Gerald Wilkins, one of the most popular New York Knicks ever

Dana Barros was originally slated to be one of the six contestants, but was missing from the show during its first episode, apparently dropping out at the last minute. He was replaced by the Orlando Magic&#x27;s first-ever draft pick, Nick Anderson, but Anderson soon exited, and was replaced by Dennis Scott.

=== Summary ===
Due to Barros&#x27; absence, there were only five contestants for the season premiere. This meant that at the end of the episode, no one would be cut; ESPN thus touted the first episode as a &quot;special preview&quot; episode. Promotional ads for the show leading up to episode two said Nick Anderson would be Barros&#x27; replacement, but those ads quickly disappeared, as Anderson was then replaced by Dennis Scott. On episode two, Wilkins was the first contestant to go. The following week, Dawkins was gone, the victim of America&#x27;s vote being used as a tiebreaker when he got his second cut vote of the night, though Scott also had two cut votes. Week four saw Reid saying goodbye, with Scott finally getting the boot in week five. That left Bullard and Brown in the last showdown for the &quot;Dream Job&quot; of ESPN NBA analyst. Bullard&#x27;s mistakes got the best of him, and Dee Brown was the winner of the third season of the show, as Bullard got three votes to be cut.

<doc id="1173008" wikidata="Q2664204" url="?curid=1173008" title="Massimo Introvigne">
<text>Massimo Introvigne (born June 14, 1955) is an Italian sociologist of religion, author, and intellectual property attorney. He is a co-founder and the managing director of the Center for Studies on New Religions (CESNUR), a Turin-based nonprofit organization which has been described as &quot;the highest profile lobbying and information group for controversial religions&quot;.

== Early life and work ==
Introvigne was born in Rome, Italy on June 14, 1955. Introvigne earned a B.A. in Philosophy from the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome in 1975, and a J.D. from the University of Turin in 1979. He worked for the law firm Jacobacci e Associati as an intellectual property attorney, specialized in domain names. In 1988 he co-founded the Center for Studies on New Religions (CESNUR), a nonprofit organization based in Turin that studies new religious movements and opposes the anti-cult movement. Introvigne is the group director of CESNUR. 

He joined Alleanza Cattolica in 1972, a conservative lay Catholic association, for which he has received much criticism. From 2008 to 2016, he was the vice-president of the association. Beginning in 2012, Introvigne was listed as an &quot;invited professor of sociology of religious movements&quot; at the Salesian Pontifical University in Turin. Introvigne is a proponent of the theory of religious economy developed by Rodney Stark.

In 2012, Introvigne was appointed chairperson of the newly-formed Observatory of Religious Liberty of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Beginning in 2018, Introvigne was editor-in-chief of the daily magazine on religious issues and human rights in China and elsewhere, &quot;Bitter Winter&quot;, which is published by CESNUR.

== New religious movements ==
Swedish academic , writing for &quot;Reading Religion&quot;, described Introvigne as &quot;one of the major names in the study of new religions.&quot; Sociologist Roberto Cipriani has called Introvigne &quot;one of the Italian sociologists of religion most well-known abroad, and among the world&#x27;s leading scholars of new religious movements&quot;. In George D. Chryssides&#x27;s &quot;Historical Dictionary of New Religious Movements&quot;, Introvigne is noted to be &quot;regarded as a cult apologist&quot; by members of the anticult movement.

In 2001, sociologist Stephen A. Kent described Introvigne as a &quot;persistent critic of any national attempts to identify or curtail so-called &#x27;cults&#x27;&quot;, arguing that,
:&quot;In the context, therefore, of the debate over Scientology in France and Germany, CESNUR is a think-tank and lobbying group, attempting to advance Scientology&#x27;s legitimation goals by influencing European and American governmental policies toward it. It is not a neutral academic association, even less so because on its web page Introvigne intermingles ideological positions within solid research and information. On issues, however, that are key to the religious human rights debates — apostates, brainwashing, undue influence, compromised academic research, &#x27;sect&#x27; membership and the potential for harm, critical information exchange on the Internet, etc. — he advocates doctrinaire positions that favour groups like Scientology.&quot;
In the mid-1990s, Introvigne testified on behalf of Scientologists in a criminal trial in Lyon. After Introvigne was critical of the publication of the 1995 report on cults by the French government, journalists described Introvigne as a &quot;cult apologist&quot;, saying he was tied to the Catholic Alliance and Silvio Berlusconi&#x27;s then ruling party. Introvigne responded that his scholarly and political activities were not connected.

Introvigne has written on the concept of brainwashing. CESNUR published the &quot;Encyclopedia of Religion in Italy&quot; in 2001, of which Introvigne was the main author. Journalist and Scientology-critic Tony Ortega penned a series of 2018/19 articles criticizing &quot;The Journal of CESNUR&quot; as an unreliable &quot;apologist journal&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Introvigne is a Roman Catholic. Introvigne is also director of CESPOC, the Center for the Study of Popular Culture. He was the Italian director of the Transylvanian Society of Dracula, which included the leading academic scholars in the field of the literary and historical study of vampire myth. In 1997, J. Gordon Melton and Introvigne organized an event at the Westin Hotel in Los Angeles where 1,500 attendees came dressed as vampires for a &quot;creative writing contest, Gothic rock music and theatrical performances&quot;.

<doc id="1173010" wikidata="Q1624233" url="?curid=1173010" title="Hokkien mee">
<text>Hokkien mee, literally &quot;Fujian noodles&quot;, is a group of related Southeast Asian dishes that have their origins in the cuisine of China&#x27;s Fujian (Hokkien) province.

==Types==
&quot;Hokkien mee&quot; can refer to five distinct dishes, with each being ubiquitous in specific localities in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. The dishes are all indigenous to the region and not known in Fujian itself, although they are all thought to have descended from lor mee (卤面), a staple of Fujianese cooking.

=== Singapore &quot;Hokkien mee&quot; ===
In Singapore, Hokkien mee () refers to a dish of egg noodles and rice noodles stir-fried with egg, slices of pork, prawns and squid. The key to the dish is copious quantities of an aromatic broth made from prawns and pork bones, slowly simmered for many hours. Sambal chilli and calamansi limes are served on the side for the diner to blend in, giving it an extra zing and tanginess. Traditionally, small cubes of fried lard are added, and some stalls also serve the dish on an &quot;opeh&quot; leaf (soft areca palm bark), which enhances the fragrance of the dish. Some also use garlic chive (koo chye) as an ingredient. 

The Singaporean version of Hokkien mee was created after World War II by Chinese sailors from Fujian (Hokkien) province in southern China. After working in the factories, they would congregate along Rochor Road and fry excess noodles from the noodle factories over a charcoal stove. The dish is considered a classic of Singaporean cuisine and several hawker stalls selling it have been recognized by the Michelin Guide.

The dish is also known as &quot;fried Hokkien noodles&quot; (炒福建面), &quot;Hokkien fried prawn noodles&quot; (福建炒虾面), and particularly in Malaysia, &quot;sotong mee&quot; (squid noodles) to differentiate it from other types of Hokkien mee.

=== Penang &quot;hokkien mee&quot; (noodle soup) ===

The Penang variant can be easily distinguished from the other variants by its characteristic spicy prawn broth. It primarily consists of rice vermicelli and thicker yellow egg noodles, while the broth is made with prawn heads and shells, and pork ribs. Sliced prawns or shrimps are also added into the dish, along with pork slices, hard boiled eggs, and &quot;kangkung&quot; (&quot;Ipomoea aquatica&quot;). Some of the Hokkien Mee are served with bean sprouts, fried shallots, lard and &quot;sambal&quot; too. In Penang, pig skin, an ingredient rarely served in Kuala Lumpur, is a common topping as well.

Egg noodles are served in richly flavoured dark soup stock with prawns, pork slices, fish cake slices and bean sprouts, topped with fried shallots and scallion. The stock is made using dried shrimp, plucked heads of prawns, white pepper, garlic and other spices. Traditionally, lard is added to the soup, but this is now less common due to health concerns. A &quot;dry&quot; (without soup) version is also available; this version usually involves flavouring the noodles and toppings with vinegar, soy sauce, oil and chili, if desired. The dish is also usually served with freshly cut red chili slices in light soy sauce and lime juice.

The name &quot;Hokkien Mee&quot; is controversial and often discussed in local forums. Majority of the Penangites and hawkers are Hokkien who spoke in the Hokkien-dialect. Thus, the Hokkien prawn-soup noodle was called &quot;Hokkien Mee&quot; in Penang as there are varieties of noodles with prawn as main ingredients such as &quot;lam mee&quot; while local Hokkien Mee was served with sliced small shrimp. Nevertheless, not all Malaysians speak hokkien. Therefore, Penang Hokkien Mee is also known as &quot;Penang Har Mee&quot; especially in other northern region which Cantonese was their most-spoken dialects, as &quot;Har&quot; means prawn in Cantonese (&quot;Hae&quot; in Hokkien).

===Singaporean &quot;hae mee&quot;===
Another version of the dish called &quot;prawn noodles&quot; (虾面 &quot;hae mee&quot;) in Singapore is similar to the Penang variation of Hokkien mee. Egg noodles and rice noodles are served in richly flavoured dark soup stock with prawns, pork slices, fish cake slices, and bean sprouts topped with fried shallots and spring onion. The stock is made using dried shrimps, prawn heads, white pepper, garlic and other spices.

=== Medan &quot;Mie Hokkien&quot;===

In Indonesia, hokkien mee (known as &quot;Mie Hokkien&quot;) is associated particularly with the city of Medan on Sumatra. While the ingredients resemble the Singaporean version, instead of being stir-fried together, the ingredients are typically cooked separately and simply tossed together before serving.

===&quot;Hokkien char mee&quot; ===
&quot;Hokkien char mee&quot; (Hokkien fried noodles; ) is served in Kuala Lumpur and the surrounding region. It is a dish of thick yellow noodles braised in thick dark soy sauce with pork, squid, fish cake and cabbage as the main ingredients and cubes of pork fat fried until crispy (sometimes pork liver is included). The best examples are usually cooked over a raging charcoal fire. This dish originated from a hawker stall chef, Ong Kim Lian, at Petaling Street in 1927.

<text>Wikinews is a free-content news wiki and a project of the Wikimedia Foundation that works through collaborative journalism through user-created content. Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales has distinguished Wikinews from Wikipedia by saying, &quot;On Wikinews, each story is to be written as a news story as opposed to an encyclopedia article.&quot; Wikinews&#x27;s neutral point of view policy aims to distinguish it from other citizen journalism efforts such as Indymedia and OhmyNews. In contrast to most Wikimedia Foundation projects, Wikinews allows original work in the form of original reporting and interviews. In contrast to newspapers, Wikinews does not permit op-ed.

As of 2025, Wikinews sites are active in languages, with a total of articles and recently active editors (editors that contributed to the site in the last 30 days).

== Early years==
The first recorded proposal of a Wikimedia news site was a two-line anonymous post on January 5, 2003, on the Wikimedia community&#x27;s Meta-Wiki. Daniel Alston, who edited Wikipedia as Fonzy, claimed to have been the one who posted it. The proposal was then further developed by German freelance journalist, software developer, and author Erik Möller. Early opposition from long-time Wikipedia contributors, many of them pointing out the existence of Wikipedia&#x27;s own news summaries, gave way to detailed discussions and proposals about how it could be implemented as a new project of the Wikimedia Foundation.

The domain name wikinews.org was registered on April 2, 2004. In November 2004, a demonstration wiki was established to show how such a collaborative news site might work. A month later, in December 2004, the site was moved out of the &quot;demo&quot; stage and into the beta stage under public domain copyleft. A German language edition was launched at the same time. Soon, editions in Italian, Dutch, French, Spanish, Swedish, Bulgarian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Ukrainian, Serbian, Japanese, Russian, Hebrew, Arabic, Thai, Norwegian, Chinese, Turkish, Korean, Hungarian, Greek, Esperanto, Czech, Albanian, and Tamil (in that chronological order) were set up.

In September 2005, the project moved to the Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 license. On September 7, 2007, the English Wikinews published its 10,000th article.

== Interviews ==
Wikinews reporters have conducted interviews with several notable people, including an interview in December 2007 with Israeli President Shimon Peres by Wikinews reporter David Shankbone. Shankbone had been invited to conduct the interview by the America-Israel Friendship League and the Israeli foreign ministry.

Other notable interviews have included writers, actors, and politicians, such as Augusten Burroughs, several 2008 U.S. Republican Party presidential primaries candidates like Sam Brownback and Duncan Hunter, and others like British politician Tony Benn, writer Eric Bogosian, New Zealand politician Nick Smith, former New Zealand prime minister John Key, World Wide Web co-inventor Robert Cailliau, drag queen RuPaul, and former Wikimedia Foundation executive Sue Gardner.

== Criticism ==
Wikinews has been criticized for its alleged inability to remain neutral in perspective and provide verifiable, reliable sources. In 2005, Robert McHenry, former editor-in-chief of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, criticized the credibility of the project:

McHenry was skeptical about Wikinews&#x27; ability to provide a neutral point of view and its claim to be evenhanded, saying that &quot;[t]he naïveté is stunning.&quot;

In a 2007 interview given to Wikinews, Sue Gardner, at that time a special adviser to the board of the Wikimedia Foundation and former head of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s Internet division, CBC.ca, dismissed McHenry&#x27;s comment, stating:

Wikinews has also had issues with maintaining a separate identity from Wikipedia, which also covers major news events in real-time. Columnist Jonathan Dee of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said in 2007 that &quot;So indistinct has the line between past and present become that Wikipedia has inadvertently all but strangled one of its sister projects, the three-year-old Wikinews... [Wikinews] has sunk into a kind of torpor; lately it generates just 8 to 10 articles a day... On bigger stories there&#x27;s just no point in competing with the ruthless purview of the encyclopedia.&quot; Andrew Lih and Zachary M. Seward commented on the continuing issue in a 2010 piece in the Nieman Journalism Lab called &quot;Why Wikipedia beats Wikinews as a collaborative journalism project.&quot; Lih wrote &quot;it&#x27;s not clear that the wiki process really gears itself towards deadlines and group narrative writing&quot; and that &quot;if you&#x27;re trying to write something approaching a feature piece, it&#x27;s much harder to get more than two or three people to stay consistent with the style.&quot; Lih considers Wikipedia&#x27;s stricter &quot;formula&quot; for article composition an advantage in a large wiki with many editors. Brian Keegan wrote in 2019 that the Wikinews model of requiring approval before publication ultimately limited its ability to grow, especially compared to the more open nature of Wikipedia.

Thomas Roessing wrote in &quot;The International Encyclopedia of Journalism Studies&quot; in 2019 about journalism on Wikipedia and Wikinews: &quot;Many people turn to Wikipedia for more information after they received news from the mass media ... There is a substantial danger of havoc resulting from hasty handling of information about an unfolding situation.&quot; Roessing presents the issue of a &quot;citation cycle&quot;, where professional journalists turn to Wikipedia for research, but the Wikipedia community goes to mass media sources for breaking news articles. Roessing writes about the problem of differentiating Wikipedia and Wikinews: &quot;The quality and the speed in which Wikipedia responds to news is one of the challenges to Wikinews.&quot; Additionally, Roessing refers to an analogy made by author Matthew Yeomans: &quot;Usually, Wikinews retells stories that were first published by Internet outlets of the traditional mass media (which also serve as sources for Wikinews&#x27; articles). This tends to result in &quot;dull regurgitation of facts&quot; as Yeomans (2005) put it.&quot;

== Language editions ==
As of 2025, there are Wikinews sites for languages of which are active and are closed. The active sites have articles and the closed sites have articles. There are registered users of which are recently active.

The top ten Wikinews language projects by mainspace article count:

<doc id="1173020" wikidata="Q1260713" url="?curid=1173020" title="Dru Hill">
<text>Dru Hill is an American R&amp;B group, whose repertoire included soul, hip hop soul and gospel music. The group was founded in Baltimore in 1992 by Tamir &quot;Nokio the N-Tity&quot; Ruffin, and as of 2023, is still active. Dru Hill recorded seven top 40 hits, and is best known for the R&amp;B number-one hits &quot;In My Bed&quot;, &quot;Never Make a Promise&quot; and &quot;How Deep Is Your Love&quot;. Its original members were lead singer Mark &quot;Sisqó&quot; Andrews, Tamir &quot;Nokio&quot; Ruffin, Larry &quot;Jazz&quot; Anthony and James &quot;Woody&quot; Green. The group achieved popularity in the late 1990s.

Signing to Island Records through A. Haqq Islam&#x27;s University Records imprint, the group released two successful albums, &quot;Dru Hill&quot; and &quot;Enter the Dru&quot;, before separating for a period from late 1999 to 2002, during which time Sisqó and Woody released solo albums. Dru Hill was influenced by the Dragon and Asian culture, as displayed in their wardrobe and logo. While Woody&#x27;s album, &quot;Soul Music&quot;, was a moderate success in the gospel music industry, Sisqó&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Unleash the Dragon&quot;, and its hit singles, &quot;Thong Song&quot; and &quot;Incomplete&quot;, were major pop successes, and established Sisqó as a household name outside of Dru Hill. Sisqó&#x27;s second album, &quot;Return of Dragon&quot;, did not perform as well.

In 2002, by then part of the Def Soul record label, following a merger between Island, sister label Def Jam Recordings and Universal Music Group, the group reunited and added fifth member Scola to the lineup for their third album, &quot;Dru World Order&quot;; after that album underperformed the group met with Island Def Jam president L.A. Reid about a follow-up. When the group failed to develop their fourth album, Def Jam cited the group as non-productive and destructive, having dropped the group from Def Soul in 2004. In 2009, the group signed to Kedar Entertainment Group and released their fourth album, &quot;InDRUpendence Day&quot;, the following year, with new member Tao taking the place of the again departed Woody.

==History==
===Early career===
The members of Dru Hill are natives of Baltimore. The group became known getting jobs at The Fudgery, a local fudge factory at Harborplace at Baltimore&#x27;s Inner Harbor, beginning a store tradition of singing and performing to entertain guests while making fudge. The group&#x27;s name comes from Baltimore&#x27;s Druid Hill Park, which is commonly shortened in the local vernacular to &quot;Dru Hill&quot;.

=== Self-titled debut album (1996) ===
After scoring a deal with Island Black Music, an urban, &quot;Black market-targeted&quot; division of Island Records in 1994, two years later, on November 19, 1996, the group released their eponymous debut album. It peaked at number twenty-three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and went on to sell over one million copies by the summer of 1997. It scored major hits like &quot;In My Bed&quot;, &quot;Tell Me&quot; and &quot;Never Make a Promise&quot;.

=== Success, guest appearances and Island Records dispute ===
Between their first and second albums, Dru Hill contributed &quot;We&#x27;re Not Making Love No More&quot;, a number 2 R&amp;B and number 13 pop hit, to the &quot;Soul Food&quot; soundtrack. &quot;We&#x27;re Not Making Love No More&quot; was written and produced by producer Babyface. Dru Hill and rapper Foxy Brown recorded &quot;Big Bad Mama&quot;, a remake of Carl Carlton&#x27;s 1981 hit &quot;She&#x27;s a Bad Mama Jama (She&#x27;s Built, She&#x27;s Stacked)&quot;, which was the main single for the soundtrack to the 1997 Bill Bellamy film &quot;Def Jam&#x27;s How to Be a Player&quot;. The group was also instrumental in writing and producing for new University artist Mýa, whose first two singles &quot;It&#x27;s All About Me&quot; and &quot;Movin&#x27; On&quot;, were co-written by Sisqó, who also performs guest vocals on &quot;It&#x27;s All About Me&quot;.

In 1997, Dru Hill filed a lawsuit against Island Records, seeking a release from its contract, after an Island employee hit one of the group&#x27;s managers, Keith Ingram, over the head with a pool cue. It was discovered that the employee in question had a criminal record. At an October 1997 deposition hearing, Eric Kronfeld, president and chief operating officer of Island&#x27;s parent company PolyGram, was asked why he had hired such an individual. His response was that if he were not to hire African-Americans with criminal records, then &quot;there would be virtually no African-Americans employees in our society or in our industry.&quot;

Kronfield&#x27;s remarks set off a wave of controversy when word of them reached the media in November. The Reverend Jesse Jackson became personally involved, publicly stating that the Dutch-based PolyGram had &quot;a pattern of race and sex exclusion.&quot; Jackson met with PolyGram chairman Alain Levy and several other executives, who issued a public apology for Kronfield&#x27;s statement, and replaced Kronfield as president with Motown Records&#x27; chairman Clarence Avant. By the end of the month, Dru Hill had settled with Island Records, and issued a joint statement with the label, stating in the agreement that they would remain on the label.

=== &quot;Enter the Dru&quot; (1998), Island Def Jam merger, Woody&#x27;s departure and Sisqó&#x27;s solo success ===
Dru Hill&#x27;s third top 20 pop hit came in the form of 1998&#x27;s &quot;How Deep Is Your Love&quot; (Pop #3), which was included on the soundtrack to the Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker film &quot;Rush Hour&quot;. The single &quot;This Is What We Do&quot;, featuring a guest rap from Method Man, set the tone for the group&#x27;s second album, &quot;Enter the Dru&quot;. The album featured several other mid-tempo tracks in the vein of &quot;How Deep Is Your Love&quot;, as well as the R&amp;B top 5 single &quot;These are the Times&quot; (Pop #21), co-written and co-produced by Babyface, and featuring guitar work from Atlanta-based session guitarist and former Earth Wind &amp; Fire member Dick Smith. The album was released on October 27, 1998. It peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and eventually sold two million copies by May 1999.

After PolyGram (parent company of Island) was acquired by Seagram on December 10, 1998, thus PolyGram&#x27;s music division was later merged with Universal Music Group in 1999. Then, on New Year&#x27;s Eve, Island Records&#x27; operations as a label was combined with sister labels Mercury Records and Def Jam Recordings to become The Island Def Jam Music Group. As a result, Island Black Music was folded, soon after Island and Mercury&#x27;s R&amp;B and hip hop rosters were transferred to Def Jam and thus, Dru Hill was moved to its R&amp;B division of Def Soul, having found a new label home. However, after a shooting incident at a concert in Paris that almost costed two lives of its entourage, member Woody Rock decided to part ways with the group. Later that year, Dru Hill released a remix of &quot;You Are Everything&quot;, featuring rapper Ja Rule, and recorded a version of &quot;Enchantment Passing Through&quot; for the soundtrack to the Broadway musical &quot;Aida&quot;, which was also featured on Sisqó&#x27;s solo debut album &quot;Unleash the Dragon&quot;, which was later released in November 1999. The album had a minor hit with his first single, &quot;Got to Get It&quot; featuring Make It Hot. His second single, &quot;Thong Song&quot;, became a major hit during the spring of 2000, and his third, &quot;Incomplete&quot;, became a number-one hit during the summer.

The group made the final appearance of that year on the title track to the western comedy film &quot;Wild Wild West&quot;, starring the track&#x27;s leading performer, Will Smith.

===&quot;Dru World Order&quot; (2002) and Def Soul issues===
Before the group&#x27;s third album came into fruition, Dru Hill began having problems internally. Sisqó&#x27;s success as a solo artist had hampered the group. Def Jam president Kevin Liles, a fellow Baltimore native, pressured the group for a comeback album and a few solo follow-ups, but it never fully materalized. Jazz was supposed to release a solo debut album in 2001 after having recorded it between 1999 and 2000, but due to issues with Lyor Cohen, another top Def Jam executive, the album was shelved and Jazz was dropped from the Def Soul division as a solo artist. Nokio focused on his work as a producer, having produced for DMX (&quot;What These Bitches Want&quot;), Foxy Brown (&quot;Na Na Be Like&quot;) and others. In 2000, Sisqó and Nokio formed the label, Dragon Records, and signed a girl group named LovHer. Then, on June 19, 2001, Sisqó released his sophomore solo album, &quot;Return of Dragon&quot;, but it performed poorly, causing Dru Hill&#x27;s comeback for the year to be postponed. After releasing his solo gospel album, &quot;Soul Music&quot;, in May, and with a new agreement with Def Jam, Dru Hill decided to invite Woody back into the fold while adding a new member, Rufus &quot;Scola&quot; Waller&quot; to the group as its fifth inductee. &quot;Dru World Order&quot; was finished by July and finally released on November 26, 2002, two years after its planned release. Nearly all of the album&#x27;s tracks were produced by Nokio, who sung lead on the tracks &quot;She Said&quot; and &quot;Men Always Regret&quot;. Producers such as Bryan Michael Cox, Eric &quot;Nealante&quot; Phillips and Kwamé also made contributions. Most of the album&#x27;s tracks featured Sisqó, Jazz, Woody, and Scola sharing the leads, including the lead single &quot;I Should Be...&quot;. &quot;I Should Be...&quot; was a top thirty pop hit and a top ten R&amp;B hit, respectively.

By August 2003, promotion and marketing for the album died down as Def Jam signed another boy band to its Def Soul imprint, 112, helping to support their upcoming fourth album at the time, &quot;Hot &amp; Wet&quot;. Because of this, Dru Hill felt frustrated and decided to take another hiatus until issues would have been resolved. Throughout 2004, their label situation worsened when Liles and Cohen left Def Jam and were replaced by L.A. Reid. He started pushing the group to record a fourth studio album for the label only to postpone the project to focus on artists of his certainty. Due to the group&#x27;s failure to produce any new music featuring Sisqó, who chose not to lend his vocals to new recordings as ordered by Reid, he reviewed Dru Hill as a destructive and a self-imploding group that was not fully productive. As a result, the buzz around the album never became a reality and on July 17, 2004, the group was confirmed to have been dropped from Def Soul, ending their five-year relationship with Def Jam.

On October 11, 2005, Def Soul released a greatest hits compilation, &quot;Dru Hill: Hits&quot;, along with a corresponding DVD collection of the group&#x27;s music videos. Both collections included Sisqó&#x27;s biggest solo hits, &quot;Thong Song&quot; and &quot;Incomplete&quot;, alongside the Dru Hill songs.

=== Family affairs ===
In the midst of Dru Hill&#x27;s label issues, in 2003, Sisqó became involved in a relationship with his stylist Elizabeth Pham, whom he later married on August 17, 2018. That same year, on June 12, group founder Nokio fathered a son named Niko, whose mother is radio personality Angie Martinez.

===Woody and Scola&#x27;s departure===
In early 2008, the original quartet version of Dru Hill began touring alongside fellow 1990s acts Tony! Toni! Toné!, Bell Biv Devoe, and Keith Sweat. The group held a contest in their native Baltimore for a replacement for Woody, who left the group again earlier in January, settling upon a new singer, Antwuan &quot;Tao&quot; Simpson. The group never said why they did not keep Scola in the group, although it was later stated by Nokio that &quot;five people [mess] up the money&quot;.

===&quot;InDRUpendence Day&quot; (2010)===
&quot;InDRUpendence Day&quot; is Dru Hill&#x27;s fourth album, released on July 27, 2010. It features the group&#x27;s new member, Tao. The album has released three singles: &quot;Love MD&quot;, &quot;Remain Silent&quot; and &quot;Back to the Future&quot;. It was released under the label, Kedar Entertainment, which was founded by the album&#x27;s executive producer, Kedar Massenburg.

===New lineup and &quot;The Second Coming&quot;===
Jazz left the group in early 2018 to work on his solo album and Tao left in early 2019 to work on a solo project because he did not like the direction Dru Hill was going.

In August 2018, a new album, &quot;The Second Coming&quot;, was announced. It was to feature two new members from the group Playa, Smoke and Black, who started performing with them after Jazz left the group. The first single from the album, &quot;What You Need&quot;, was released in February 2020. Later that month, Nokio confirmed on Magic 95.9 that he has left Dru Hill to spend time with his family. A comeback of the band with the new lineup, Sisqo, Smoke, and Black, was hinted in March 2020.

==Television appearances==
Dru Hill had their own television show titled &quot;Keith Sweat&#x27;s Platinum House&quot;. It debuted June 28, 2010, on Centric. It focused on their fourth album, &quot;InDRUpendence Day&quot;, and depicted the progress of returning as a full group, and their work to create new music.

The original premiere on July 14, 2009, on the main BET Network was postponed, but aired later on Centric.

<text>Publius Metilius Nepos (c. 45 – 127 AD) was a Roman senator during the late 1st century. He is known to have been suffect consul in the &quot;nundinium&quot; of September to December 91, and was appointed Governor of Britannia by the Emperor Domitian before his death in 96, and held the post until 98.

During his governorship, the colonies of &quot;Colonia Domitiana Lindensium&quot; (Lincoln) and &quot;Colonia Nervia Glevensium&quot; (Gloucester) were founded.

Further details about Nepos are more difficult about which to be confident. The inscriptions of the Frater Arvale record a Publius Metilius Sabinus Nepos as one of their brotherhood who attended their meetings in the years 105, 110, and 111, who had died by 26 February 118 when a successor was co-opted in his place. On the other hand, a papyrus from Roman Egypt records the joint consulate of P. Metilius Nepos II and Marcus Annius Libo for 128; apparently Nepos died in late 127, and his term assigned to another person. Some assistance is provided by the presence of a &quot;Metilius&quot; -- who could be Publius Metilius Nepos or Publius Metilius Sabinus Nepos -- as suffect consul in 103. It is likely we have two consular senators with similar names: one died before February 118, the other in late 127.

Pliny the Younger addressed several letters to a Nepos, and at least one more to a Sabinus. It is not yet possible to determine which Nepos Pliny was writing to, nor even be assured he was writing to either of these Metilii Nepotes.

The question of children and descendants is an open one. On one hand there is a Publius Metilius P.f. Secundus, suffect consul in 123, who could be the son of either Metilii Nepotes; on the other, Anthony Birley notes there are two polyonymous senators of the next generation whose names include Metilius as part of their nomenclature: Marcus Sedatius Severianus, consul in 153, and Marcus Metilius Aquillius Regulus, consul in 157. The solution awaits further information.

<text>The rufous-tailed robin (Larvivora sibilans) is a small passerine bird. Its breeding range extends from southern Siberia and the Sea of Okhotsk to southern China and southeastern Asia.

It has a number of alternative English names: pseudorobin, red-tailed robin, Swinhoe&#x27;s red-tailed robin, Swinhoe&#x27;s robin, Swinhoe&#x27;s pseudorobin, Swinhoe&#x27;s nightingale or whistling nightingale.

==Taxonomy==
The rufous-tailed robin was previously placed in the genus &quot;Luscinia&quot;. A large molecular phylogenetic study published in 2010 found that &quot;Luscinia&quot; was not monophyletic. The genus was therefore split and several species including rufous-tailed robin were moved to the reinstated genus &quot;Larvivora&quot;. The rufous-tailed robin is genetically most closely related to the rufous-headed robin (&quot;Larvivora ruficeps&quot;). These two species form a sister group to a clade containing the Japanese robin (&quot;Larvivora akahige&quot;) and the Ryukyu robin (&quot;Larvivora komadori&quot;).

The genus name &quot;Larvivora&quot; comes from the Neo-Latin &quot;larva&quot; meaning caterpillar and &quot;-vorus&quot; meaning eating (&quot;vorace&quot; to devour), and &quot;sibilans&quot; is Latin for &quot;whistling&quot;.

==Morphology==

The rufous-tailed robin is much the same size as the European robin at length. It is plain greyish brown above and grey to white below, with circular pale markings on its heavily mottled throat and breast. It has a bright rufous rump and tail. The flanks are buff and there is whitish ring round the eye and a pronounced buffish cheek stripe. The tip of the lower mandible is slightly upturned. The beak is brownish-black and the legs pinkish-grey. The sexes generally look alike but the females may be marginally paler. Juveniles are similar to the adults but tinged with ochre and with dark edges to the upper plumage. At first glance this bird could be confused with the American &quot;Catharus&quot; thrushes such as veery and hermit thrush.

The male rufous-tailed robin sings by day, but also by night during the breeding season. The song consists of several similar phrases, being loud cascading trills starting at a high pitch and ending lower, rather like the neigh of a horse. Calls include whistles when the bird is alarmed and a jangling &quot;chok-chok&quot; when the parents have young to care for.

==Distribution and habitat==

The rufous-tailed robin is a migratory insectivorous species breeding in forests in the taiga of northeastern Asia and south to Mongolia, and wintering in Southeast Asia and southern China. It is a rare vagrant to Western Europe. The first record for this bird in Europe was on Fair Isle, Scotland in October 2004. Another was seen in Poland in January 2006. More recently, it was seen in Norfolk, England in October 2011 and again in September 2013, and in Denmark in October 2012.

It is a bird of coniferous woodlands and damp broad-leafed woodland with fallen trees and thick undergrowth, particularly spruce and fir with willow, alder, birch, poplar and bird cherry. It is mainly a lowland species but sometimes occurs at altitudes of up to 1,200 m (4,000 ft) above sea level. In its winter quarters it is found in forests, in areas with scattered trees, scrubland, parks and gardens.

==Behaviour==

This is an elusive bird and difficult to spot as it lurks among concealing branches, remaining stationary for considerable periods. It is terrestrial in its habits and insectivorous, mainly feeding on ants, beetles, spiders and other invertebrates. It often flicks its tail in a characteristic way.

Breeding takes place in June or July. The nest is cup-shaped and is often in a hole in a tree or on a stump and usually quite near the ground. It is made from dead leaves, grasses and moss and lined with finer materials. There are usually five or six eggs, either plain pale blue or blueish-grey irregularly blotched with brown. Migration southwards starts soon after the nestlings are reared, in late August in Russia and a few weeks later in Korea. The birds arrive in the vicinity of Hong Kong in November and also overwinter in Thailand, Laos and Vietnam. In the spring they move northwards again, reaching Korea in May and Russia by early June.

==Status==
The rufous-tailed robin is considered by the IUCN to be of least concern. This is because it has an extremely large range, appears to be quite common within that range and the population seems to be stable.

<text>Titus Avidius Quietus (died by 107 AD) was a Roman senator active during the reigns of the emperors Domitian, Nerva and Trajan. The offices he held included suffect consul in AD 93 and governor of Roman Britain around 98.

==Background==
Pliny the Younger mentions that Quietus was an intimate friend of the Stoic philosopher Publius Clodius Thrasea Paetus, a fact Anthony Birley uses to deduce Quietus was born in the early AD 40s. Literary references to other members of his family, the Avidii, indicates they had their origins in Faventia (modern Faenza, Italy), located on the Via Aemilia. Archeological evidence points to Quietus owning at least two houses at Rome, and inscriptions found in Sardinia indicate he owned estates on that island.

==Political career==
Only two posts from his career before he was appointed to the consulship are known. In 82 the veterans of Legio VIII Augusta stationed in Germania Inferior asked Quietus, who is described as &quot;leg. Aug. ornatissimo viro&quot;, to become the patron of the colony of Deultum in Thrace, where they had settled. This petition, recorded in an inscription set up in Rome, led Birley to suspect that Quietus &quot;was chosen as patron of Deultum because he was legionary legate at the time the men were settled, i.e. in 82.&quot; Later, perhaps in 91–2, Quietus served as proconsul of Achaea; Birley suggests it was while in this post that Quietus became the friend of Plutarch, who mentions him fondly in his &quot;Quaest. conv.&quot; and &quot;De fraterno amore&quot;.

Birley notes that &quot;at first sight it is a little surprising&quot; that Quietus, with clear connections to the Stoics, was appointed to a consulship under Domitian, especially in 93, &quot;the very year when Domitian carried out a major purge of the Stoics.&quot; Birley explains that Domitian may have hoped to reconcile with the group until the last moment. Following Domitian&#x27;s assassination in 96, Quietus spoke in defense of Pliny the Younger before the Senate when the latter attempted to obtain revenge for the Stoic leader Helvidius Priscus. Soon after this speech, he was appointed governor of Roman Britain, despite Quietus lacking recent military experience. Birley believes his appointment fits the pattern of Nerva&#x27;s rule, who appointed a number of elder statesmen to positions of power.

His career after Britain, if any, is unknown. Birley concludes that he was dead by the time Pliny wrote his second letter mentioning him, which experts date to c. 107.

==Family==
Literary references to other members of his family, the Avidii, indicates they had their origins in Faventia (modern Faenza, Italy), located on the Via Aemilia. Quietus had a son of the same name. The younger Avidius Quietus was suffect consul in 111, and later Proconsul of Asia. The nephew of the older Quietus, Gaius Avidius Nigrinus, consul in 110, was put to death at Faventia in 118 on charges of conspiring against Hadrian. However Nigrinus&#x27; daughter, Avidia, married the man Hadrian later was to adopt and make his successor, Lucius Ceionius Commodus.

<doc id="1173050" wikidata="Q1857905" url="?curid=1173050" title="Cyclic vomiting syndrome">
<text>Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) is a chronic functional condition of unknown pathogenesis. CVS is characterized as recurring episodes lasting a single day to multiple weeks. Each episode is divided into four phases: inter-episodic, prodrome, vomiting, and recovery. Inter-episodic phase (symptom free phase), is characterized as no discernible symptoms, normal everyday activities can occur, and this phase typically lasts one week to one month. The prodrome phase is known as the pre-emetic phase, characterized by the initial feeling of an approaching episode, still able to keep down oral medication. Emetic or vomiting phase is characterized as intense persistent nausea, and repeated vomiting typically lasting hours to days. Recovery phase is typically the phase where vomiting ceases, nausea diminishes or is absent, and appetite returns. &quot;Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) is a rare abnormality of the neuroendocrine system that affects 2% of children.&quot; This disorder is thought to be closely related to migraines and family history of migraines.

==Signs and symptoms==

Affected individuals may vomit or retch 6–12 times in an hour and an episode may last from a few hours to over three weeks and in some cases months, with a median episode duration of 41 hours. Stomach acid, bile and, if the vomiting is severe, blood may be vomited. Some with the condition will ingest water to reduce the irritation of bile and acid on the esophagus during emesis. Between episodes, the affected individual is usually normal and healthy otherwise but can be in a weak state of fatigue or experience muscle pain. In approximately half of cases the attacks, or episodes, occur in a time-related manner. Each attack is stereotypical; that is, in any given individual, the timing, frequency and severity of attacks is similar. Some affected people experience episodes that progressively get worse when left untreated, occurring more frequently with reduced symptom free phase.

Episodes may happen every few days, every few weeks or every few months, for some happening at common uniform times, typically mornings. For other affected people, there is not a pattern in time that can be recognized. Some with the condition have a warning of an episodic attack; they may experience a prodrome, some documented prodromal symptoms include: unusually intense nausea and pallor, excess salivation, sweating, flushing, rapid/irregular heartbeat, diarrhea, anxiety/panic, food aversion, restlessness/insomnia, irritability, depersonalization, fatigue/listlessness, intense feelings of being hot or chilled, intense thirst, shivering/shaking, retching, tachypnea, abdominal pain/cramping, limb paresthesias, hyperesthesia, photophobia, phonophobia, headache, and dyspnea, heightened sensitivity, especially to light, though sensitivity to smell, sound, pressure, and temperature, as well as oncoming muscle pain and fatigue, are also reported by some patients. Many experience a full panic attack when nausea begins and continue to panic once the vomiting has begun. Medications like Lorazepam, Alprazolam, and other benzodiazepines are prescribed by their doctors and instructed to take immediately at the onset of any of their CVS symptoms and/or triggers. Some prodromal symptoms are present inter-episodically as well as during acute phases of illness. The majority of affected people can identify triggers that may precede an attack. The most common are various foods, infections (such as colds), menstruation, extreme physical exertion, lack of sleep, and psychological stresses, both positive and negative.

An affected person may also be light-sensitive (photophobic), sound-sensitive (phonophobic) or, less frequently, temperature- or pressure-sensitive during an attack. Some people also have a strong urge to bathe in warm or cold water. In fact, many people with CVS experience a compulsion to be submerged in hot water, and end up taking several baths during the duration of an episode. For some the psychological compulsion to be in hot water is so extreme that they cannot stop themselves from taking very long baths in near scalding hot water several times per day. For some of these people, they may have just finished taking a lengthy bath in extremely hot water and immediately feel this compulsion again and end up taking another bath right after drying off. Some people with the condition experience insomnia, diarrhea (GI complications), hot and cold flashes, and excessive sweating before an episode. Some report that they experience a restless sensation or stinging pain along the spine, hands, and feet followed by weakness in both legs. Some of these symptoms may be due to dehydration or hypokalemia from excessive vomiting, rather than the underlying cause of CVS.

==Genetics==
There is no known genetic pathogenesis for CVS. Recent studies suggest many affected individuals have a family history of related conditions, such as migraines, psychiatric disorders and gastrointestinal disorders. Inheritance is thought to be maternal, a possible genetic mitochondrial inheritance. Adolescents show higher possible mitochondrial inheritance and maternal inheritance than found in adults. Single base-pair and DNA rearrangements in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been associated with these traits.

==Diagnosis==

The cause of CVS has not been determined and there are no diagnostic tests for CVS. Several other medical conditions, such as cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS), can mimic the same symptoms, and it is important to rule these out. If all other possible causes have been excluded, a diagnosis of CVS using Rome criteria by a physician may be appropriate.

Once formal investigations to rule out gastrointestinal or other causes have been conducted, these tests do not need to be repeated in the event of future episodes.

===Diagnostic criteria===
Due to the lack of specific biomarkers available for the disorder, and if all other possible causes can be ruled out (such as intestinal malrotation), physicians rely on the Rome IV process criteria in order to diagnose patients. Patients must meet all three of the following criteria to receive diagnosis: 

# Stereotypical episodes of acute vomiting each with a duration of less than 1 week
# A history of at least three discrete episodes in the prior year and at least two episodes in the past 6 months, each occurring at least 1 week apart
# An absence of vomiting between episodes, but other milder symptoms can be present between cycles

Criteria must be fulfilled for the last 3 months with symptom onset at least 6 months prior to diagnosis. A history of family history of migraine headaches can also be used in facilitating diagnosis.

==Treatment==
Treatment for cyclic vomiting syndrome depends on the evident phase of the disorder.

Because the symptoms of CVS are similar (or perhaps identical) to those of the disease well-identified as &quot;abdominal migraine,&quot; prophylactic migraine medications, such as topiramate and amitriptyline, have seen recent success in treatment for the prodrome and vomiting phases, reducing the duration, severity, and frequency of episodes.

Therapeutic treatment for the prodromal phase, characterized by the anticipation of an episode, consists of sumatriptan (nasal or oral) an anti-migraine medication, anti-inflammatory drugs to reduce abdominal pain, and possible anti-emetic drugs. These options may be helpful in preventing an episode or reducing the severity of an attack.

The most common therapeutic strategies for those already in the vomiting phase are maintenance of salt balance by appropriate intravenous fluids. Sedation via high dose intravenous benzodiazepines, typically lorazepam, has been shown to shorten the length of emergency department stays for some patients. Having vomited for a long period prior to attending a hospital, patients are typically severely dehydrated. For a number of patients, potent anti-emetic drugs such as ondansetron (Zofran) or granisetron (Kytril), and dronabinol (Marinol) may be helpful in either preventing an attack, aborting an attack, or reducing the severity of an attack. Many patients seek comfort during episodes by taking prolonged showers and baths typically quite hot. The use of a heating pad may also help reduce abdominal pain.

Lifestyle changes may be recommended, such as extended rest, reduction of stress, frequent small meals, and to abstain from fasting. A diet change may be recommended avoid food allergens, eliminating trigger foods such as chocolates, cheese, beer, and red wine.

Some patients experience relief from inhaled isopropyl alcohol.

Intravenous Haloperidol may be an effective treatment.

==Prognosis==
Fitzpatrick et al. (2007) identified 41 children with CVS. The mean age of the sample was 6 years at the onset of the syndrome, 8 years at first diagnosis, and 13 years at follow-up. As many as 39% of the children had resolution of symptoms immediately or within weeks of the diagnosis. Vomiting had resolved at the time of follow-up in 61% of the sample. Many children, including those in the remitted group, continued to have somatic symptoms such as headaches (in 42%) and abdominal pain (in 37%).

Most children who have this disorder miss on average 24 school days a year. The frequency of episodes is higher for some people during times of excitement. Charitable organizations to support affected people and their families and to promote knowledge of CVS exist in several countries.

A 2005 study by Fleisher et al. identified 41 adults who had been previously seen for complaints compatible with CVS. The average age at presentation of the sample was 34 years, and the mean age at onset was 21 years. The mean duration of the CVS at the time of consultation was 12 years. Of the 39 patients surveyed, 85% had episodes that were fairly uniform in length. Most patients reported these attacks in the morning hours. Of those 39 patients, 32% were completely disabled and required financial support due to CVS. Despite this, data suggests that the prognosis for CVS is generally favorable.

Complications can include dehydration, dental caries, or an esophageal tear.

==Epidemiology==
The average age at onset is 3–7 years, with described cases as young as 6 days and as old as 73 years. Typical delay in diagnosis from onset of symptoms is 3 years. Females show a slight predominance over males.

One study found that 3 in 100,000 five-year-olds are diagnosed with the condition. Two studies on childhood CVS suggest nearly 2% of school-age children may have CVS.

==History==
Cyclic vomiting syndrome was first described in France by Swiss physician Henri Clermond Lombard and first described in the English language by pediatrician Samuel Gee in 1882.

It has been suggested that Charles Darwin&#x27;s adult illnesses may have been due to this syndrome. Darwin&#x27;s illness had features seen in patients with cyclic vomiting, in particular his susceptibility to seasickness when onboard HMS Beagle, episodes being brought on by pleasurable events, and his periods of extreme lethargy dating back to his university student days. However in Darwin&#x27;s case it is argued that his vomiting was due to an inherited mitochondrial disorder.

<text>In computing based on the Java Platform, JavaBeans is a technology developed by Sun Microsystems and released in 1996, as part of JDK 1.1.

The &#x27;beans&#x27; of JavaBeans are classes that encapsulate one or more objects into a single standardized object (the bean). This standardization allows the beans to be handled in a more generic fashion, allowing easier code reuse and introspection. This in turn allows the beans to be treated as software components, and to be manipulated visually by editors and IDEs without needing any initial configuration, or to know any internal implementation details.

As part of the standardization, all beans must be serializable, have a zero-argument constructor, and allow access to properties using getter and setter methods.

==Features==
;Introspection
:Introspection is a process of analyzing a Bean to determine its capabilities. This is an essential feature of the Java Beans specification because it allows another application, such as a design tool, to obtain information about a component.
;Properties
:A property is a subset of a Bean&#x27;s state. The values assigned to the properties determine the behaviour and appearance of that component. They are set through a setter method and can be obtained by a getter method.
;Customization
:A customizer can provide a step-by-step guide that the process must follow to use the component in a specific context.
;Events
:Beans may interact with the EventObject EventListener model.
;Persistence
:Persistence is the ability to save the current state of a Bean, including the values of a Bean&#x27;s properties and instance variables, to nonvolatile storage and to retrieve them at a later time.
;Methods
:A Bean should use accessor methods to encapsulate the properties. A Bean can provide other methods for business logic not related to the access to the properties.

== Advantages ==

* The properties, events, and methods of a bean can be exposed to another application.
* A bean may register to receive events from other objects and can generate events that are sent to those other objects. 
* Auxiliary software can be provided to help configure a bean. 
*The configuration settings of a bean can be saved to persistent storage and restored. 

== Disadvantages ==
* A class with a zero-argument constructor is subject to being instantiated in an invalid state. If such a class is instantiated manually by a developer (rather than automatically by some kind of framework), the developer might not realize that the class has been improperly instantiated. The compiler cannot detect such a problem, and even if it is documented, there is no guarantee that the developer will see the documentation.
* JavaBeans are inherently mutable and so lack the advantages offered by immutable objects.
* Having to create getters for every property and setters for many, most, or all of them can lead to an immense quantity of boilerplate code.

== JavaBeans API ==

The JavaBeans functionality is provided by a set of classes and interfaces in the codice_1 package.
== JavaBean conventions ==
In order to function as a JavaBean class, an object class must obey certain conventions about method naming, construction, and behaviour. These conventions make it possible to have tools that can use, reuse, replace, and connect Java Beans.

The required conventions are as follows:

* The class must have a public default constructor (with no arguments). This allows easy instantiation within editing and activation frameworks.
* The class properties must be accessible using &quot;get&quot;, &quot;set&quot;, &quot;is&quot; (can be used for boolean properties instead of get), &quot;to&quot; and other methods (so-called accessor methods and mutator methods) according to a standard naming convention. This allows easy automated inspection and updating of bean state within frameworks, many of which include custom editors for various types of properties. Setters can have one or more arguments.
* The class should be serializable. (This allows applications and frameworks to reliably save, store, and restore the bean&#x27;s state in a manner independent of the VM and of the platform.)

===Code example===

package player;

public class PersonBean implements java.io.Serializable {

 /** Properties **/
 private boolean deceased = false;

 private List list;

 /** Property &quot;name&quot;, readable/writable. */
 private String name = null;

 /** No-arg constructor (takes no arguments). */
 public PersonBean() {

 public List getList() {
 return list;
 
 public void setList(final List list) {
 this.list = list;

 * Getter for property &quot;name&quot;.
 public String getName() {
 return name;

 * Setter for property &quot;name&quot;.
 * @param value
 public void setName(final String value) {
 this.name = value;

 * Getter for property &quot;deceased&quot;
 * Different syntax for a boolean field (is vs get)
 public boolean isDeceased() {
 return deceased;

 * Setter for property &quot;deceased&quot;.
 * @param value
 public void setDeceased(boolean value) {
 deceased = value;
}
codice_2:

import player.PersonBean;
 * Class &quot;TestPersonBean&quot;.
public class TestPersonBean {
 * Tester method &quot;main&quot; for class &quot;PersonBean&quot;.
 * @param arguments
 public static void main(final String[] arguments) {
 final PersonBean person = new PersonBean();

 person.setName(&quot;Bob&quot;);
 person.setDeceased(false);
 person.setList(new ArrayList());

 // Output: &quot;Bob [alive]&quot;
 System.out.print(person.getName());
 System.out.println(person.isDeceased() ? &quot; [deceased]&quot; : &quot; [alive]&quot;);
}

&lt;jsp:useBean id=&quot;person&quot; class=&quot;player.PersonBean&quot; scope=&quot;page&quot;/&gt;
&lt;jsp:setProperty name=&quot;person&quot; property=&quot;*&quot;/&gt;

&lt;html&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
 Name: &lt;jsp:getProperty name=&quot;person&quot; property=&quot;name&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 Deceased? &lt;jsp:getProperty name=&quot;person&quot; property=&quot;deceased&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;form name=&quot;beanTest&quot; method=&quot;POST&quot; action=&quot;testPersonBean.jsp&quot;&gt;
 Enter a name: &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;name&quot; size=&quot;50&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 Choose an option:
 &lt;select name=&quot;deceased&quot;&gt;
 &lt;option value=&quot;false&quot;&gt;Alive&lt;/option&gt;
 &lt;option value=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Dead&lt;/option&gt;
 &lt;/select&gt;
 &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Test the Bean&quot;&gt;
 &lt;/form&gt;

<doc id="1173060" wikidata="Q1682269" url="?curid=1173060" title="Snagov">
<text>Snagov is a commune, located north of Bucharest, in Ilfov County, Muntenia, Romania. The commune is composed of five villages: Ciofliceni, Ghermănești, Snagov, Tâncăbești, and Vlădiceasca. Snagov is a tourist and spa resort, but the necessary infrastructure has regressed after 1989. At the 2021 census, the commune had a population of 8,331. 

== Name ==
The name &quot;Snagov&quot; is of Slavic origin, from the word &quot;sneg&quot; (meaning &quot;snow&quot;). The area of today&#x27;s commune along with surrounding lands has had this name since at least 1408.

== Geography ==
Snagov is located on the Wallachian Plain, on the shore of Lake Snagov (biggest natural lake in Romania: 600 hectares; 2¼ sq. mi., 16 km; 10 miles long), which is still partially surrounded by old oak forest (remnants of Codrii Vlăsiei).

==History==
===Antiquity=== 
Archaeologists confirmed human presence of inhabitants since 400 BC.

===Early medieval history and the feudal estate===
Snagov village was built around Lake Snagov and Snagov Monastery, founded in the late 14th century on an islet in Lake Snagov, about north of Snagov village. The first written record of it is found in a document from the court of Mircea cel Bătrân and dated 1408.

=== The modern settlement ===
Snagov monastery was excavated in 1933 by archaeologist Dinu V. Rosetti.

== Tourism ==
Cultural attractions include the Snagov Monastery, Snagov Palace, several monuments, the Snagov Museum, a set of four local traditions (fishing, braiding of vegetable fibers, pottery, traditional fabrics).

Natural attractions are associated with two protected natural areas, Snagov Lake (100–150 ha; approx. 300 acres) and Snagov Forest (10 ha; 25 acres), which are included in the Snagov Natural Complex Reserve. With an area of 1,147.7 ha (4½ sq. mi.), the nature reserve was established in 1952 and includes all the forests on the shore of the lake.

Also in Snagov one can find a Tourist Information Center, a Rental Center (bicycles, kayaks), a Biodiversity Center, and a site with the entire Snagov Eco-tourism Offer (attractions, activities, circuits, audio guides, etc.)

== Events ==
* 25 June 1933: The National Celebration of Water day, with King Carol II, Michael I, Nicolae Iorga, Iuliu Maniu, Dimitrie Gusti, Grigore Antipa and many other top officials, as well as Liga Navală Română, Cercetașii României and representatives of the local community in attendance. This is the reason for celebrating the day of Lake Snagov on June 25, when Romanians also celebrate &quot;Sânzienele/Drăgaica&quot;.
* 23 August 1944: Ion Antonescu left Snagov Palace in order to go to Bucharest at the request of King Michael I, where he was arrested during the Royal Coup. Manfred von Killinger, who was also staying at a nearby villa on the shore of Lake Snagov, committed suicide soon after, because he failed to maintain Romania on the side of Nazi Germany, as requested by Adolf Hitler.
* 1962 to 1972: Regata Snagov was an international rowing competition held between 1962 and 1972.
* 2002: The Romanian government decided to build at Snagov a Disneyland-style theme park, called &quot;Dracula Park&quot;; the project was canceled in 2006. The connection with &quot;Dracula&quot; is due to a spurious 19th-century tradition that makes Snagov Monastery the site of the tomb of Vlad the Impaler.
* 4–5 April 2003: An informal meeting of the prime ministers of the seven states invited to join the NATO alliance was held at Snagov Palace.
* 25 June 2008: A pedestrian footbridge was struck by a tipper lorry, which was lifted and then collapsed onto a moving car, killing a 21-year old woman driving towards Bucharest and a male passenger. The footbridge has not been rebuilt since then, and the stairways were left as a memorial to the death of the victim, and a new footbridge was built further away from the original one.
* 2016: Protection of the natural area (heritage) was reinforced by &quot;The management plan and the ANPLS regulation&quot; published in the Official Gazette.

== Notable people ==
Romanian president Nicolae Ceaușescu and his entourage used Snagov as a vacation retreat. Over 50 heads of state, prime ministers, top politicians from more than 40 states, crossed Lake Snagov with the &quot;Snagov 1&quot; luxury boat (today called &quot;Leader&quot;). In Snagov, at the film studios Castel Film Romania, over 250 films were produced. At the Snagov Museum, collections are presented about 130 personalities related to Snagov.

== Twin towns/sister cities ==
Initiated but not yet implemented - with: Port of Le Havre from France and Sarkad from Hungary, Gandiaye village from Senegal.

==Notable sites==
* Snagov Monastery – first mentioned by 1438.
* Snagov Palace – built by Prince Nicholas of Romania in 1928.
* Yacht Club Snagov (1928), transformed in Baza Veche (1948), currently named Complexul Sportiv Național Nicolae Navasart, where there exist 4 statues of relevant personalities from Romanian nautical sports.
* Snagov Park and Snagov Beach – built by Dem I. Dobrescu, Mayor of Bucharest, in 1930.
* The Imre Nagy monument. Between 1956 and 1957, the prime minister of Hungary was kept for a few months in Snagov before being sent to trial and executed in Budapest.
* Siliștea Snagovului, the old church built-in 1664.
* Snagov Museum, inaugurated in 2008.
* Snagov Stadium, a football stadium seating 2,000.
* The Tâncăbești transmitter – a medium wave broadcasting station, near Tâncăbești, built by 1949, which uses as antenna a tall guyed mast radiator. Works on 855 kHz used before the 1990s a transmission power of 1,500 kW. Today it may be 300 kW.

<text>The Battle of Halbe (, Battle of the Halbe Pocket; , Halbe pocket) was a battle lasting from April 24 – May 1, 1945 in which the German Ninth Army—under the command of General Theodor Busse—was destroyed as a fighting force by the Red Army during the Battle of Berlin.

The Ninth Army, encircled in a large pocket in the Spree Forest region south-east of Berlin, attempted to break out westwards through the village of Halbe and the pine forests south of Berlin to link up with the German Twelfth Army commanded by General Walther Wenck with the intention of heading west and surrendering to the Western Allies. To do this, the Ninth Army had to fight its way through three lines of Soviet troops of the 1st Ukrainian Front under the command of Marshal Ivan Konev, while at the same time units of the 1st Belorussian Front, under the command of Marshal Georgy Zhukov, attacked the German rearguard from the northeast.

After heavy fighting, about 30,000 German soldiers—just over one third of those originally in the pocket—reached the comparative safety of the Twelfth Army&#x27;s front lines. The rest were either killed or captured by Soviet forces.

== Prelude ==
On April 16, the Red Army started the Battle of Berlin with a three Front attack across the Oder-Neisse line. By April 21, it had broken through the German front line in two places and had started to surround Berlin. The German Ninth Army covered the defenses of the Seelow Heights against Marshal Zhukov&#x27;s 1st Belorussian Front, but its position was unhinged by the successful attack of Marshal Ivan Konev&#x27;s 1st Ukrainian Front (against Army Group Centre) on the Neisse. By April 20, the Ninth Army retreated south-east of Berlin, opening the way for the 1st Belorussian Front.

Because of the high speed of the advance of Konev&#x27;s forces, the Ninth Army was now threatened with envelopment by the two Soviet pincers that were heading for Berlin from the south and east. The southern pincer consisted of the 3rd and 4th Guards Tank Armies which had penetrated the furthest and had already cut through the area behind the Ninth Army&#x27;s front lines.

== Encirclement ==
=== German dispositions ===

The command of the V SS Mountain Corps, encircled with the Ninth Army north of Forst, passed from the 4th Panzer Army (part of Army Group Centre) to the Ninth Army (part of Army Group Vistula under the command of Colonel-General Gotthard Heinrici). The corps was still holding on to Cottbus. While the bulk of Army Group Centre was being forced, by the advance of the 1st Ukrainian Front, to retreat along its lines of communication to the south-west towards Czechoslovakia, the southern flank of the 4th Panzer Army had some local successes counterattacking north against the 1st Ukrainian Front.

Contrary to realities on the ground, Hitler ordered the Ninth Army to hold Cottbus and set up a front facing west, then they were to attack into the Soviet columns advancing north. This would allow them to form the northern pincer which would meet with the 4th Panzer Army coming from the south and envelop the 1st Ukrainian Front before destroying it. They were to anticipate an attack south by the 3rd Panzer Army and to be ready to be the southern arm of a pincer attack which would envelop the 1st Belorussian Front, which would then be destroyed by SS-general Felix Steiner&#x27;s III SS Panzer Corps advancing from the north of Berlin. Later in the day, Steiner made it plain that he did not have the divisions to make this effort. Heinrici then explained to Hitler&#x27;s staff that unless the Ninth Army retreated immediately, it would be enveloped by the Soviet forces. He stressed it was already too late for the unit to move north-west to Berlin and would have to retreat west.

At his afternoon situation conference on April 22, Hitler flew into a rage when he realised that his plans of the day before were not going to be implemented. He declared that the war was lost, blamed the generals and announced that he would stay in Berlin until the end and then kill himself. In an attempt to coax Hitler out of his rage, the Chief of Staff of the OKW, Colonel-General Alfred Jodl, speculated that the 12th Army, which was facing the American forces, could move to Berlin because the Americans already on the Elbe River were unlikely to move further east. Hitler immediately seized upon the idea and within hours, the army&#x27;s commander, General Walther Wenck, was ordered to disengage from the American forces and move the Twelfth Army north-east to support Berlin. It was then realised that if the Ninth Army moved west, it could link up with the Twelfth Army. In the evening, Heinrici was given permission to make the linkup.

Although in Hitler&#x27;s mind the Twelfth Army was going to break through to Berlin, and the Ninth Army, once it had broken through to the Twelfth Army, was going to help them, there is no evidence that Generals Heinrici, Busse or Wenck thought that this was at all possible. However, Hitler&#x27;s agreement to allow the Ninth Army to break through to the Twelfth Army would allow a window through which sizable numbers of German troops could retreat to the west and surrender to the American forces, which is exactly what Wenck and Busse agreed to do. This was made easier when, shortly after midnight on April 25, Busse was given authority &quot;to decide for himself the best direction of attack&quot;.

=== The situation of the German 9th Army ===
Before being encircled, the Ninth Army had already suffered heavy losses in the Battle of the Seelow Heights. It is estimated that, at the start of the encirclement, it had fewer than 1,000 guns and mortars, approximately 79 tanks, and probably a total of 150–200 combat-ready armoured fighting vehicles left. In all, there were about 80,000 men in the pocket, the majority of whom belonged to the Ninth Army, consisting of the XI SS Panzer Corps, V SS Mountain Corps and the newly acquired V Army Corps, but there was also the Frankfurt Garrison. The number of tanks reported included 36 tanks in the XI SS Panzer Corps, including up to 14 Tiger II tanks of the 102nd SS Heavy Panzer Battalion. Air supply was attempted on April 25 and 26, but could not be carried out because the planes that had taken off could not find the drop point for supply, and no contact with the encircled army could be established.

The pocket into which the Ninth Army had been pushed by troops of the 1st Belorussian and 1st Ukrainian Fronts was a region of lakes and forest in the Spree Forest south-east of Fürstenwalde. The Soviet forces, having broken through and surrounded their primary objective of Berlin, then turned to mopping up those forces in the pocket. On the afternoon of April 25, the Soviet 3rd, 33rd and 69th Armies, as well as the 2nd Guards Cavalry Corps (which was a formation capable of infiltration through difficult terrain such as forests), attacked the pocket from the north-east as ordered by Marshal Georgy Zhukov, the commander of the 1st Belorussian Front. Konev knew that to break out to the west, the Ninth Army would have to cross the Berlin–Dresden Autobahn south of a chain of lakes starting at Teupitz and running north-east. On the same day of his attack in the north-east, Zhukov sent the 3rd Guards Army to support the 28th Army, which was ready to close the likely breakout route over the Berlin–Dresden Autobahn.

=== Soviet dispositions ===

Soviet forces ordered to attack the Ninth Army numbered around 280,000 men, 7,400 guns and mortars, 280 tanks and self-propelled guns, and 1,500 aircraft. The force included six Air Corps and the 1st Guards Breakthrough Artillery Division, which was committed on April 25.

In the area to the west of the encirclement, Soviet forces were already positioned in depth, with (from the north)

* the 29th Army&#x27;s 128th Rifle Corps in the area of Mittenwalde and Motzen.
**the 3rd Guards Rifle Corps in the area of Tornow, Radeland, Baruth/Mark, Golssen.
* the 3rd Guards Army&#x27;s 120th Rifle Corps south of Halbe.
**the 21st Rifle Corps along the Berlin to Dresden Autobahn 13 to the west of Lübben.
* the 13th Army&#x27;s 102nd Rifle Corps with the 117th Guards Rifle Division near Luckenwalde.
**the 27th Rifle Corps&#x27;s 280th Rifle Division at Jüterbog, where the Wehrmacht&#x27;s main artillery school was located.
In terms of mechanized formations, the 3rd Guards Tank Army&#x27;s 9th Mechanised Corps had its 71st Mechanized Brigade between Teupitz and Neuhof; the 4th Guards Tank Army&#x27;s 68th Guards Tank Brigade stood near Kummersdorf Gut; and the 3rd Guards Army&#x27;s 25th Tank Corps near Duben. Both the 3rd Guards Army and the 13th Army were to be heavily reinforced throughout the battle, as they were to be in the path of the German break-out. A reinforcement of particular note was the deployment of the 1st Guards Breakthrough Artillery Division under the command of the 3rd Guards Army in the sector of Teurow to Briesen.

== Breakout ==

=== The Twelfth Army&#x27;s attack and the Ninth Army&#x27;s plan ===
The relief attempt by the Twelfth Army started on April 24 with General Wenck&#x27;s XX Corps attacking east and northwards. During the night, the &quot;Theodor Körner RAD Division&quot; attacked the Soviet 5th Guards Mechanised Corps, under the command of General I. P. Yermakov, near Treuenbrietzen. The next day, the &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; Division started to engage the Soviet troops in and around Beelitz and caught the 4th Guards Tank Army&#x27;s 6th Guards Mechanized Corps&#x27; open flank, overrunning rear-area units. While the &quot;Ulrich von Hutten&quot; Division tried to reach Potsdam, with the &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; Division on its eastern flank, to open a corridor into Berlin, other elements of the Twelfth Army, as Wenck had agreed with Busse, pushed east to meet the Ninth Army.

In the words of Busse to Wenck, the Ninth Army was planning to push west &quot;like a caterpillar&quot;. According to Busse&#x27;s plan, the Tiger II heavy tanks of the 102nd SS Heavy Panzer Battalion should lead this caterpillar. The metaphor is quite apt because, as the head led the way, the rear-guard in the tail was going to be engaged in just as heavy fighting trying to disengage from following Soviet forces.

On the night of April 25/26, a new order was issued to the Ninth and Twelfth Armies by Hitler. It stipulated that:

* The Twelfth Army was to cut off the 4th Guards Tank Army by reaching the line Beelitz to Ferch, and to attack eastwards to unite with the Ninth Army.
* The Ninth Army was to hold on to its eastern front between Spreewald and Fürstenwalde, and to attack westward to link up with the Twelfth Army.
* Once both armies were combined, they were to attack northwards and open a corridor through the Red Army&#x27;s encirclement of Berlin.

The final army conference of the Ninth Army took place at 15:00 on April 28. At this point, contact was lost with the V Corps and the V SS Mountain Corps. The conference found that the only possible break-out route had to lead through Halbe. This was not difficult for the Soviet commanders to deduce as well, while, on the other hand, Ninth Army had virtually no information about the Soviet force dispositions between it and the Twelfth Army. From this conference onward, command and control within the Ninth Army collapsed. There was almost no contact between the Ninth Army headquarters and Army Group Vistula, and little contact with formations under Ninth Army command. There were few or no maps to guide planning or combat operations.

In his book &quot;Slaughter at Halbe&quot;, Tony Le Tissier accused Busse of failing to exercise effective command and control of the encircled army, thereby contributing to the failure of successive break-out attempts. Le Tissier writes that Busse&#x27;s initial movement of his HQ put him into a situation where he lost the ability to control the formations in the pocket. In his break-out plan, Ninth Army HQ was to be placed immediately behind the spearhead of the breakout, the 502nd SS Heavy Tank Battalion, which effectively reduced his ability to exercise command to the tactical level. He also accuses Busse of failing to adequately support the first breakout attempt (see below). The spearhead for the Ninth Army break-out plan on April 28 was to be the 502nd SS Heavy Panzer Battalion with remaining elements of the Panzergrenadier Division Kurmark. These units were split into two wedges. The northern wedge included the 502nd SS Panzer, Ninth Army HQ, XI SS Panzer Corps HQ, and Panzergrenadier Division Kurmark HQ. Remnants of the 21st Panzer Division were to cover in a north-westerly direction, while remnants of the 32nd SS Division &quot;30. Januar&quot; was to cover the east and provide the rearguard.

=== The first breakout attempt ===
On the evening of April 25, Busse ordered the two battlegroups - &quot;Kampfgruppe von Luck&quot;, consisting of the 21st Panzer Division and &quot;Kampfgruppe Pipkorn&quot;, containing the 35th SS Police Grenadier Division, both named after their commanders - to attempt a break-out in the direction of the road centre of Baruth. The attempted breakout failed.

On the following day, the battle continued around Baruth, and tank-hunting teams blew up some of the dug-in Soviet tanks. Some supply canisters were delivered by air, but the strength of the battle group was insufficient to hold off a Soviet counter-attack. Heavy air attacks, a strike by the 4th Bomber Air Corps around noon with 55 aircraft, and repeated strikes by the 1st and 2nd Air Assault Corps with 8–10 aircraft each, a total of ca. 500 missions, caused heavy casualties and chaos. The forces of the two battle groups were destroyed, with Soviet reports claiming 5,000 prisoners taken, 40 tanks and self-propelled guns destroyed, and almost 200 guns and mortars captured. These forces and weapons were sorely missed during later break-out attempts. Pipkorn, the commander of the other battle group, was killed during the battle, and Luck taken prisoner on April 27. Few of the survivors of the battle reached the Elbe.

=== The second breakout attempt ===
The next morning, the German vanguard found a weak point between the two armies and many German troops were able to cross the &quot;Autobahn&quot; before the Soviet forces plugged the gap. The fighting was heavy and included continuous air attacks by the 2nd Air Army, as well as tree-bursting shells which rained wood splinters through the area. During the battle, the Soviet air force flew 2,459 attack missions and 1,683 bombing sorties. The German forces found that they could not use their armour as well as they had hoped, because it was vulnerable to destruction on the roads and could not get a good grip on the sandy soil of the pine forests in the region. The German vanguard managed to reach and cross Reichsstrasse 96, south of Zossen and north of Baruth, where it was spotted by a Luftwaffe plane. Hitler was furious when he realised that Busse was attempting to break out west and not to come to his aid in Berlin. His command sent several messages demanding that the army turn towards Berlin, but received no answer.

During the night and the next day (April 27), the German forces renewed their attack along two axes south from the village of Halbe towards Baruth, and in the north from Teupitz. This attack failed to produce a mass breakout although, like the day before, some groups were able to slip through the Soviet lines.

The front lines were not continuous because the dense forest terrain meant that visibility was down to metres, so there was danger of ambush and sudden assault for both sides. Smoke from burning sections of the forest, set alight by shell fire, helped the Germans and hindered the Soviets because it shielded the Wehrmacht troops from aerial reconnaissance and attack. On the other hand, the smoke hindered many groups because, without a compass and no sun, it was difficult to judge which direction to go. The sandy soil precluded the digging of foxholes and there was no time to construct anything more elaborate, so there was little to no protection from wooden splinters created by artillery and tank HE shells, which the Soviet forces deliberately aimed to explode at tree-top height.

=== The third breakout attempt ===
On the night of April 28, the German forces tried another mass breakout from around Halbe. They broke through the 50th Guards Rifle Division and created a corridor from Halbe to the west, but paid a very high price. During April 28 and 29, the Soviets reinforced the flanks and attacked from the south, pouring in Katyusha rockets and shells, concentrating on the area around the Halbe.

By this time, the German troops were spread out over a wide area. The rearguard was at Storkow and the vanguard had linked up with the 12th Army at Beelitz. There were large groups around Halbe. The Soviet battle plan was to split the caterpillar into segments and then destroy each segment individually. The German battle plan was to continue moving west as fast as possible, keeping the corridor open.

The situation in Halbe was desperate for the Germans. Orders were still being issued to recognisable formations, but these were by now all mixed up. There was considerable tension between the Waffen-SS and Wehrmacht troops, with both accusing the other of helping their own while ignoring the plight of the other. In Halbe itself, some of the civilians took pity on very young soldiers (&quot;Kindersoldaten&quot;) and allowed them to change out of their uniforms into civilian clothes. In one documented case, an SS man appeared at the door of a cellar intending to shoot a &quot;Panzerfaust&quot; into a cellar with about forty civilians and young Wehrmacht soldiers in it, only to be shot dead by one of the soldiers.

During the following days, the fighting became more and more confused. If the Germans came into contact with Soviet forces and overran a Soviet position, the Soviets counter-attacked not only with ground forces, but with artillery and aircraft. Losses on both sides were very high. By the time the fighting was over (around the end of April, beginning of May), about 25,000 German soldiers had escaped to join up with the 12th Army on the eastern side of Reichstrasse 2, the road running north-south through Beelitz.

Although this was the end of the Battle of Halbe, it was not the end of the breakout. Some 9th Army forces were again surrounded west of Luckenwalde by the north-westerly thrust of the 4th Guards Tank Army, only 10 km away from German 12th Army troops. The combined German 12th Army and 9th Army remnants then retreated westwards towards the Elbe so that they could surrender to American forces, which had halted their advance on the west bank of the river. The bulk of the fleeing German forces, along with several thousand civilians, reached and crossed the Elbe using the partially destroyed bridge at Tangermünde between 4 May and 7 May 1945, surrendering to elements of the U.S. 102nd Infantry Division, U.S. 9th Army, until Soviet forces reached the eastern bridgehead and halted further crossings.

== Aftermath ==
The casualties on both sides were high. There are about 24,000 Germans buried in the Halbe Forest Cemetery (), making it the largest war cemetery in Germany from World War II. About 10,000 are unidentified soldiers killed during the first half of 1945. The Red Army claimed to have killed 60,000 German soldiers and taken 120,000 as prisoners. The number of prisoners is supported by some sources, while other sources consider it to be exaggerated. Thousands of Red Army soldiers died trying to stop the breakout, most being buried at the Sowjetische Ehrenfriedhof of Baruth/Mark cemetery (de) next to the Baruth–Zossen road (Bundesstraße 96). These are the known dead, but the remains of more who died in the battle are found every year, so the total will never be known. Nobody knows how many civilians died, but it could have been as high as 10,000.

<text>WEPN-FM (98.7 FM, &quot;La Exitosa 98.7&quot;) is a radio station in New York City, owned by Emmis Corporation. The station carries a Spanish-language format with a gold-based mix of Latin pop and English-language adult contemporary music. The station&#x27;s transmitter is located at the Empire State Building.

WEPN-FM originally began operations as an experimental FM station in 1939, spun off from 710 WOR. It then became one of the first licensed commercial FM stations in 1941. Until 1965, when the FCC prohibited this practice in larger markets, the station served as an FM simulcast of WOR. At that time, the station—by then owned by RKO General—flipped to one of New York&#x27;s first free-form radio formats, focusing on progressive rock. In 1974, it adopted a top 40 format. Amid declining listenership, the station briefly adopted an adult contemporary format modeled after Chicago sister WFYR in 1980.

Beginning in December 1980, after further declines in ratings under the format, the station began to transition to a format focused primarily on dance music (such as disco) and R&amp;B; the format officially launched in August 1981, with the station becoming WRKS-FM, and adopting the branding &quot;Kiss FM&quot;. The new rhythmic contemporary format was immediately successful. In 1983, WRKS became the first station in New York City to regularly play hip hop, furthering its success. Amid the golden age of hip hop, WRKS-FM was New York&#x27;s highest-rated radio station for a period.

After RKO General&#x27;s exit from the broadcasting industry in the late-1980s, the station was sold to Atlanta-based Summit Communications Group in 1989. WRKS was, in turn, acquired by Emmis Communications—the owner of its rival WQHT—in 1994, forming the first duopoly in New York City radio. In defense of the urban contemporary format of WQHT, Emmis flipped WRKS to an urban adult contemporary format focusing primarily on R&amp;B, while maintaining the &quot;Kiss&quot; branding.

In 2012, the &quot;Kiss&quot; brand came to an end when Emmis leased the station to The Walt Disney Company under a 12-year local marketing agreement (LMA). The station flipped to sports radio as WEPN-FM, the flagship of the ESPN Radio network. The LMA was transferred to Good Karma Brands (GKB) in 2021, which continued the ESPN Radio format. In August 2024, the LMA with GKB expired; as a result, WEPN-FM&#x27;s programming was migrated to the former WCBS under a new LMA between GKB and Audacy, while WEPN-FM flipped to an interim hot adult contemporary format. On January 10, 2025, WEPN flipped to a Spanish-language format with a focus on Latin- and English pop hits.

== History ==
=== Experimental operations (1939–1941) ===
In the late 1930s, WOR (710 AM), then licensed to Newark, New Jersey, and owned by the Bamberger Broadcasting Service, Inc., a division of R.H. Macy and Company, became interested in the newly developed technology of FM radio. In the summer of 1939, WOR engineers, working with Bell Telephone engineers, set up an experimental 1,000-watt transmitter in Carteret, New Jersey, with the call sign W2XWI. In June 1940 experimental operations were moved to 444 Madison Avenue in New York City, now operating under the call sign W2XOR.

=== As W71NY (1941–1943) ===
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) began permitting commercial operations by FM stations in 1941, and Bamberger&#x27;s New York station was included among the first authorizations made for the original FM band. The station was given the call sign W71NY, which reflected its operation at 47.1 MHz.

=== As WBAM (1943–1948) ===
Effective November 1, 1943, the FCC updated its call letter policy to allow FM stations to have call signs similar to those used on the AM band. The station initially chose WOR-FM, but six weeks later changed it on December 14 to WBAM. In 1945 the FM band was moved to higher frequencies, and WBAM was initially reassigned to 96.5 MHz, before moving to 98.7 MHz in October 1947.

=== As WOR-FM (1948–1972) ===

WBAM changed its call sign to WOR-FM on June 13, 1948. Like most early FM stations, the station initially simulcast AM sister station WOR. Macy&#x27;s/Bamberger sold the WOR stations (which launched a television station in October 1949) to the General Tire and Rubber Company in 1952. General Tire reorganized its broadcasting division into RKO General in 1957. WOR-FM simulcast its AM sister station&#x27;s full service Talk/MOR format.

In 1965, the Federal Communications Commission ordered AM stations in large markets to end continuous simulcasting on co-owned FM frequencies, a move made to spark development of FM stations as individual entities. On July 30, 1966, WOR-FM began running a freeform-based progressive rock format for most of its broadcast day, though the station continued to simulcast WOR radio&#x27;s morning program &quot;Rambling with Gambling&quot; for a time afterwards. Under the leadership of legendary disc jockey Murray &quot;the K&quot; Kaufman, and featuring other notable disc jockeys such as Scott Muni and Rosko, the freeform format was the first of its kind in New York City radio. Later, Muni and Rosko departed for WNEW-FM, where the same progressive format would become a huge success.

Initially, the Drake-Chenault-consulted, Top 40-formatted WOR-FM played new songs but in less of a rotation than WABC, which was then New York&#x27;s big Top 40 station. Some of the notable early personalities included Bill Brown (who was a holdover from the rock format and would leave for then-rock station WCBS-FM in 1969); Joe McCoy (who would later become general manager of WCBS-FM); Johnny Donovan (who would go to WABC in 1972 and remain there until his 2015 retirement); Tommy Edwards (announcer), later the longtime midday personality on Chicago Top 40 giant WLS (AM); and Al Brady (who would program WABC in 1979), among others.

=== As WXLO (1972–1981) ===

On October 23, 1972, RKO General changed the station&#x27;s call sign to WXLO, and starting in April 1974, it became known as &quot;99X&quot;, a reference to the WXLO frequency&#x27;s close proximity on the FM dial to 99 MHz. This was a version of what was known as the &quot;Q&quot; format, so named because it was modeled after station KCBQ in San Diego. The format featured about 15-20 currents, with a heavy emphasis on constant contests and promotions.

In 1976, WXLO held a contest in which listeners had to guess the identity of six Beatles songs blended together in a sound montage. The Beatles montage was about three seconds in duration and contained one or two notes of each of the songs. They were &quot;Hey Jude&quot;, &quot;Got to Get You into My Life&quot;, &quot;Day Tripper&quot;, &quot;Come Together&quot;, &quot;Do You Want to Know a Secret&quot;, and &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot;. The station announced that the contest winner was from Tappan, New York. The prize was a Rock-Ola jukebox stocked with Beatles 45s. The station also once held an all-Elton John weekend. Listeners had to count how many Elton songs were played and win his &quot;Greatest Hits Vol. 1&quot; album. Another weekend they held a &quot;No Bee Gees&quot; weekend, where they asked their listeners to request Bee Gee songs that they didn&#x27;t want played. &quot;I&#x27;ll be sure to not get that on the air for you&quot; a DJ said on that weekend.

WXLO evolved to a younger skewing Top 40 format and the &quot;99X&quot; moniker remained until late 1979, when it became &quot;FM 99 WXLO&quot;. This iteration had decent ratings for a while, but by the spring of 1980, the ratings fell dramatically. RKO General phased out the Top 40 format, and brought in new program director Don Kelly from successful sister soft adult contemporary WFYR in Chicago in an attempt to duplicate that format&#x27;s success on WXLO. The station at first attempted a call letter change back to WOR-FM, but an FCC challenge from competing crosstown WRFM (now WWPR-FM) prevented the call letter change from happening. Still, Kelly attempted to make the station the same adult contemporary format he had in Chicago. These changes did not gain any new listeners for WXLO, and ratings sank even lower. Later, Kelly adjusted the music and very slowly and gradually began mixing more disco and soul into the format. In the fall of 1980, Kelly, in consultation with RKO General, decided to go after WBLS-FM&#x27;s urban audience and WKTU&#x27;s Rhythmic audience by bringing in new music director Barry Mayo. Mayo, shortly before his arrival, suggested a new format for the station to Kelly and then-general manager Lee S. Simonson after he received a surprising lambasting from his idol, WBLS Program Director Frankie Crocker (who would later become his rival). Mayo would later become WXLO&#x27;s program director when Kelly left to start his own consultancy.

By December 1980, the station was leaning towards Disco and R&amp;B. The station dropped American Top 40 in January 1981. The evolution was gradual, and by May 1981, WXLO was nearly all rhythmic, playing almost all disco, soul, and rhythmic-friendly pop. Almost all the rock and AC crossovers were gone. By today&#x27;s standards, this station would be called &quot;Rhythmic CHR&quot;, but that term did not exist back in 1981. Therefore, the station was classified as &quot;Urban Contemporary&quot; (which today would be considered as a strictly R&amp;B-type format whether Rap or Soul).

=== As WRKS-FM (1981–2012) ===
==== Enter &quot;Kiss FM&quot; (1981–1994) ====

In June 1981, the station was known on-air as &quot;FM 99 WXLO making its move to 98.7&quot;. By the middle of July, the station had changed its call sign to WRKS-FM (the meaning of which originally referred to its being an RKO Station) and adopted the on-air brand &quot;98.7 Kiss FM&quot;, as the station&#x27;s transition to this new urban contemporary format was completed by that August. The first song on &quot;Kiss FM&quot; was &quot;Make That Move&quot; by Shalamar. Early on, WRKS played a great deal of R&amp;B and dance music, and became an almost instant hit with listeners, as its ratings skyrocketed from 22nd place to third. Notable Kiss FM Mixmasters at the time Shep Pettibone and, later, Tony Humphries, were commissioned to create longer versions of current popular songs. Longtime urban contemporary leader WBLS was caught off-guard by the sudden rise of the new station, which represented its first direct competition in that format.

Around mid-1983, the station approached Afrika Bambaataa about an underground hip hop music show. He liked the idea and appointed DJ Jazzy Jay, a fellow member of Zulu Nation. He then passed the gig on to his cousin, DJ Red Alert. In Fall 1983, WRKS became the first station in the United States to play rap music in regular rotation. Also that year, non-R&amp;B dance music and disco were phased out, as the station played strictly music catering mainly to an African-American audience. WBLS responded by hiring Mr. Magic to conduct a weekend rap show, which helped WBLS reach number-three in the ratings that year, beating out WRKS. Nevertheless, the station had made such strides in its first two-and-a-half years that it resulted in Barry Mayo being promoted as general manager, the first African-American to hold such a position in the RKO radio chain.

WRKS incorporated artists such as Kurtis Blow, Whodini, Run DMC, Fat Boys, LL Cool J, and Public Enemy into the same rotation as such established acts as Ashford &amp; Simpson, Kool and the Gang, and Gladys Knight. In 1986, Indianapolis-based Emmis Communications launched WQHT (then at 103.5 FM), which had an early emphasis on dance music, forcing WRKS and WBLS to add more dance music to their playlists again. In 1988, Mayo left to organize a new broadcasting company with Lee S. Simonson and Bill Pearson, and RKO appointed Charles Warfield (former general manager of WBLS) as the new general manager of WRKS. With Vinny Brown as the station&#x27;s program director, WRKS became the No. 1 radio station in the largest media market in the world for six years right through the mid 1990s.

By the late 1980s, however, RKO General was forced out of the broadcasting business when the FCC began revoking its licenses to its radio and television stations in New York, Boston and Los Angeles because of gross misconduct and lack of candor on the part of its corporate parent, the General Tire and Rubber Company. Having already been stripped in 1982 of its license to WNAC-TV in Boston, RKO was left with no choice but to break up its broadcasting unit. In New York City, RKO&#x27;s three stations were sold to different companies during a two-year period beginning in 1987. Two years after WOR-TV went to MCA (and renamed WWOR-TV), on June 26, 1989, RKO sold WRKS to the Summit Communications Group of Atlanta. Around the same time, WOR radio was sold to Buckley Broadcasting.

That same year, WBLS lured on-air personality Mike Love (formerly of the original &quot;Kiss Wake-Up Club&quot;) to their morning drive show. WRKS immediately formulated a new morning show featuring Ken &quot;Spider&quot; Webb and Jeff Foxx along with then-unknown Wendy Williams. (Foxx and Webb would continue on for the next several years, while Williams held various shifts on the station.)

For many years, WRKS was number one in the Arbitron ratings due to its hip hop-influenced format. WRKS was also the first radio station in the United States to embrace dancehall and reggae music by adding Dahved Levy to do a Sunday night reggae show with Sting International. The battle between WRKS and WBLS continued into the 1990s, but a major turning point occurred in the spring of 1994, when WQHT changed formats from dance music to primarily hip-hop by luring &quot;Funk Master Flex&quot; away from WRKS, who, at the time, was a fill-in DJ for &quot;DJ Red Alert&quot; when Red Alert was out on tour or making appearances, thus competing directly with WRKS. WRKS responded by adding &quot;The Bomb Squad Mix Show&quot;, hosted by &quot;The N.O.&quot; (also known as &quot;The Native One&quot;) featuring &quot;DJ Enuff&quot;, &quot;DJ Ace&quot;, and &quot;Supernatural the Freestyle Fanatic&quot;. The Bomb Squad began &quot;breaking&quot; hot new hip-hop artists and ushering in the &quot;Golden Era of Hip Hop&quot;. The Bomb Squad was the first hip-hop mix show in the country to play the records of The Notorious B.I.G., Wu Tang Clan, and Mobb Deep. The Bomb Squad introduced its signature &quot;bomb dropping&quot; whistle sound effect as they played exclusive new hip-hop music and produced fresh remixes not heard on other urban stations across the country. Leaning towards a younger demographic, the station formulated a new morning show featuring Wendy Williams, who was replaced by &quot;The Native One&quot; during her former 6 p.m.-10 p.m. weeknights shift.

Based on WRKS&#x27;s success, several radio stations in other markets began to use the &quot;Kiss FM&quot; moniker for branding the station itself or its format. In the case of WRKS, the branding was grandfathered even as Clear Channel Communications trademarked &quot;Kiss FM&quot; for its use on its mainstream top 40 pop stations in the late 1990s, largely based on KIIS-FM in Los Angeles, whose &quot;KIIS&quot; name was trademarked by prior owner Gannett Company in 1986.

==== &quot;Smooth R&amp;B and Classic Soul&quot; (1995–2012) ====
In December 1994, WQHT&#x27;s parent Emmis Communications took advantage of newly relaxed FCC ownership regulations and agreed to purchase WRKS from Summit, forming the market&#x27;s first FM duopoly. WRKS subsequently stopped playing hip-hop and flipped to urban adult contemporary format using the slogan &quot;Smooth R&amp;B and Classic Soul&quot;. The shift in format resulted in notable personalities associated with the previous format, such as Wendy Williams and Red Alert, moving from WRKS to WQHT. The new sound on WRKS was introduced by the station during its annual &quot;Twelve Days of Kiss-mas&quot; promotion during the Christmas holiday, and was fully implemented in January 1995. Soul music legend Barry White became the station&#x27;s imaging voice and promotional face, and would remain in this role until his death in 2003.

In September 1995, WRKS hired another deep-voiced bass singer, Isaac Hayes, as its new morning show host, and later added Ashford &amp; Simpson to helm its afternoon drive program. Funk musician Roger Troutman (of the band Zapp) and former disc jockey-turned-motivational speaker Les Brown also hosted programs on WRKS around this time.

WRKS&#x27;s playlist for its first year consisted almost exclusively of songs from the 1960s and 1970s; after 1996, the station began reintroducing current R&amp;B back into rotation. But in 1999, WRKS switched from a classic soul-based Urban AC format to a mostly current R&amp;B format. That same year, Frankie Crocker was hired as an announcer and a weekend DJ. The station slowly began to reintroduce rap in 2000. When WWPR-FM was launched in March 2002, the station shifted back to classic soul. In 2003, Barry Mayo briefly returned as general manager for WRKS, WQHT and jazz-formatted WQCD (now WFAN-FM), and WRKS returned to its full-fledged Urban AC format.

In April 2001, WRKS became the New York home for the nationally syndicated &quot;Tom Joyner Morning Show&quot;, as Isaac Hayes chose not to renew his contract with the station; he remained for a few months to host the local segments within the program (known on the station as &quot;The Tom Joyner Morning Show with Isaac Hayes&quot;). Joyner&#x27;s first stint on WRKS lasted only two years. D. L. Hughley was brought on to host &quot;The D. L. Hughley Morning Show&quot; in July 2009. Emmis planned to syndicate the show, but after a dispute between Emmis and a proposed distributor over who would pay his salary, Hughley left the station and the program was cancelled on August 7, 2010. The station picked up Joyner&#x27;s program again in 2011. In 2003, author and &quot;relationship expert&quot; Michael Baisden became host of the afternoon show, which later became syndicated nationally in January 2005.

In early September 2010, the slogan for the station, &quot;Old School &amp; Today&#x27;s R&amp;B&quot;, changed to &quot;&#x27;80s, &#x27;90s &amp; Today&#x27;s R&amp;B&quot;, which included dropping most pre-1979 titles. This would later change to &quot;Classic Soul &amp; Today&#x27;s R&amp;B&quot;, which would last until the station&#x27;s demise in 2012.

Following the death of Whitney Houston—who was born in nearby Newark, New Jersey—on February 11, 2012, WRKS dedicated the subsequent weekend to commemorating her career, including tributes by the station&#x27;s staff and alumni, and listener phone-ins.

Notable station personalities during the Kiss years included:
* Barry Mayo (1981)
* Jazzy Jay (1983)
* Shep Pettibone (Mastermixer) (1981–1984)
* DJ Chuck Chillout (1982–1989)
* Tony Humphries (1982–1994)
* Wendy Williams (1989–1994)
* Ashford &amp; Simpson (1995–1999)
* Roberta Flack (1995–1999)
* Isaac Hayes (1996–2001)
* Kool DJ Red Alert (Mastermixer) (1983–1994; 2007–2012)
* Tom Joyner (2001–2003; 2011–2012)
* Michael Baisden (2003–2012)
* DJ Cocoa Chanelle (Mastermixer) (2011–2012)
* Ed Lover (2011–2012)

Once rival WBLS acquired WRKS&#x27;s intellectual property in a merger of the two outlets announced on April 26, with a joint statement on both stations&#x27; respective websites.

=== ESPN Radio (2012–2024) ===

On April 26, 2012, the Walt Disney Company and Emmis Communications agreed to a 12-year-lease of the 98.7 FM frequency for an undisclosed price. YMF Media (which acquired WBLS&#x27; parent Inner City Broadcasting Corporation) acquired the intellectual property and trademarks of WRKS, primarily the New York City market rights to &quot;Kiss-FM&quot;. As a result, Kiss signed off on the 30th with a goodbye show featuring all of the remaining airstaff, and went off the air at midnight, with &quot;Brother&#x27;s Gonna Work It Out&quot; by Willie Hutch being the last song on Kiss. Immediately after, ESPN Radio began broadcasting on 98.7 FM under a local marketing agreement with the Walt Disney Company. Inner City/YMF also moved WBLS and its AM sister station WLIB into WRKS&#x27;s former office/studio space at Emmis&#x27; New York broadcast facility.

The 98.7 frequency simulcast WEPN, the ESPN owned-and-operated AM station until September 7, 2012, when the AM station switched over to ESPN Deportes Radio full-time. After the closure of ESPN Deportes Radio in 2019, the AM station became a passthrough for overflow programming, including the national ESPN Radio weekday schedule.

The station&#x27;s call sign changed to WEPN-FM on May 14, 2012, to match the AM call sign. YMF Media then transferred the WRKS call sign to the ESPN Radio affiliate in the Jackson, Mississippi area.

In December 2021, Beaver Dam, Wisconsin-based Good Karma Brands—an operator of ESPN Radio affiliates in other markets—announced that it would acquire operational control of WEPN-FM from Disney/ESPN, with Good Karma assuming the remainder of Disney&#x27;s lease agreement with Emmis Communications; Emmis maintains ownership of the station&#x27;s license. In the same transaction, Good Karma purchased full ownership of WEPN (AM) and ESPN Radio-owned stations in Chicago and Los Angeles from Disney.

===End of ESPN Radio LMA, &quot;TJ 98.7&quot; (2024–2025)===
On September 19, 2023, GKB owner Craig Karmazin told the &quot;New York Post&quot; that it would not renew the LMA with Emmis when it expires and would thus relinquish the 98.7 FM frequency on August 31, 2024. GKB had made an offer to acquire WEPN-FM outright, but talks with Emmis were unproductive. The original plan was to consolidate WEPN-FM&#x27;s local programming onto 1050 AM, and direct users to the ESPN New York digital platform for overflow programming. However, on August 12, 2024, GKB instead announced that it would enter into an LMA with Audacy&#x27;s 880 WCBS beginning August 26, replacing its all-news format with WEPN-FM&#x27;s former programming as WHSQ.

After the expiration of the LMA, WEPN-FM&#x27;s operations would be returned to Emmis; it planned to carry a music-based format on 98.7 in the interim, pending the search for a new operator or the outright sale of the station. Shortly before the expiration, Emmis would reach an agreement with syndicator United Stations Radio Networks to provide interim programming for WEPN-FM; plans were made for the programming to be anchored by &quot;The TJ Show&quot; —a United Stations-distributed show hosted by former WHTZ &quot;Elvis Duran and the Morning Show&quot; co-host TJ Taormina. The station&#x27;s on-air imaging and programming was developed in around a week, which would be automated and voice-tracked using the Radio.Cloud platform to integrate localized content.

At midnight on August 31, 2024, WEPN-FM abruptly ended its ESPN Radio programming (to the point that it joined &quot;Shut Up and Dance&quot; by Walk the Moon already in progress) and flipped to hot adult contemporary as &quot;TJ 98.7&quot;. The format was intended as being temporary from its start, with promos billing the &quot;TJ&quot; format as a &quot;pop-up&quot; radio station that would be &quot;here... until we&#x27;re not&quot;; &quot;The TJ Show&quot; would air twice daily during morning and afternoon drive for the run of the format.

=== &quot;La Exitosa&quot; (2025–present) ===
On January 8, 2025, it was announced that the &quot;TJ 98.7&quot; format would end, with the station airing promos inviting listeners to tune in at 6:00 p.m. on January 10, 2025 &quot;to hear what&#x27;s next&quot;. At that time, following a live farewell show hosted by Taormina, both WEPN-FM and sister AM station WLIB relaunched as the Spanish-language &quot;La Exitosa&quot;. Similarly to stations such as WMIA-FM in Miami, the station carries a gold-based mix of Latin pop and English-language adult contemporary hits, with programming and imaging conducted in Spanish.

<text>Dorothy Coade Hewett (21 May 1923 – 25 August 2002) was an Australian playwright, poet and author. She wrote in a number of different literary styles: modernism, socialist realism, expressionism and &quot;avant garde&quot;. She was a member of the Australian Communist Party in the 1950s and 1960s, which informed her work during that period.

In her lifetime she had 22 plays performed, and she published nine collections of poetry, three novels and other prose works. There have been four anthologies of her poetry.

== Early life and education ==
Dorothy Coade Hewett was born on 21 May 1923 in Perth, Western Australia. Until the age of 12, Hewett lived on a sheep and wheat farm, Lambton Downs, in the Western Australian wheat belt. The selection of nearly 2,000 prime acres had been taken by her maternal grandparents in 1912 at Malyalling near Wickepin, and the land was cleared by 15-year-old Albert Facey. It was said of her grandmother Mary Coade that &quot;money stuck to her fingers&quot;. Her business acumen made the family wealthy, first in a drapery shop in Perth, then in the wheat belt through farm production, ownership of three local general stores, insider trading in land options along the line of a new railway, and liens on crops and property. Hewett&#x27;s father survived the Gallipoli campaign and the Western Front in World War I, and he was twice decorated for bravery.

Hewett was educated through correspondence school until age 12. She and her younger sister told each other elaborate stories about the landscape of the farm. She began writing poetry at the age of six, and her parents would wake in the night to write down her poems. Her first poem was published when she was nine years old. On annual trips to Perth, Hewett became entranced with the theatre and the world of Hollywood. Her mother had severe early-onset menopause symptoms and beat the wilful and imaginative young Hewett.

The family moved to Perth in 1935 where they opened the Regal Theatre in Subiaco. Hewett attended Perth College, where she had to wear shoes, hat and gloves for the first time, a shock after her ragamuffin life on the farm. As a painfully shy country girl, she was known as &quot;Hermit Hewett&quot;. She excelled at English and received the State Exhibition award in English in 1941. To assist his talented daughter, her father took her to a meeting of the Fellowship of Australian Writers.

Hewett enrolled at the University of Western Australia (UWA) in 1942, where she participated eagerly in university life. She won the national Meanjin poetry award that year, aged 17. With several friends she founded the University Drama Society and acted in a number of Repertory plays, including a melodrama that she wrote herself. She received high distinctions in English, but failed French for several years and did not graduate.

== Realist writer period and the Communist Party ==
After leaving UWA, Hewett worked in a bookshop and as a cadet journalist with the Perth &quot;Daily News&quot;, but lost both these jobs. She rejected the lifestyle and aspirations of her wealthy parents and eventually joined the Communist Party of Australia (CPA). She briefly edited the Communist Party newspaper &quot;The Workers&#x27; Star&quot;. Dozens of articles authored by Dorothy Hewett appear in the &quot;Worker&#x27;s Star&quot; from 1945 to 1947. Recuperating after an attempted suicide following a failed wartime relationship, she wrote the poem &quot;Testament&quot;, her first mature work, which won the prestigious ABC Poetry Prize in 1945. On the rebound, she married the Party lawyer Lloyd Davies that year and their child Clancy was born in 1947.

After World War II, she briefly re-enrolled at University of Western Australia and became editor of the university journal, &quot;Black Swan&quot;, soon nicknamed &quot;&quot;Red&quot; Swan&quot;. Her enthusiasm was such that she kept the journal &#x27;politically pure&#x27; by writing most of the contents herself under various &quot;noms de plume&quot;. The authorities banned it from distribution in any other Australian university.

Hewett covered the 1946 Pilbara Strike for the &quot;Worker&#x27;s Star&quot;, and wrote the epic ballad, &quot;Clancy and Dooley and Don McLeod&quot;, which cemented her position as a radical author and a supporter of Indigenous rights. However, she then virtually discontinued writing for a life of activism and child-rearing.

In 1949, she fell in love with the boilermaker Les Flood, and eloped with him to Sydney, to live in the inner-city suburb of Redfern. The CPA strongly disapproved of what they called immoral behaviour and she had to restart at the bottom, selling the Communist weekly paper &quot;Tribune&quot; on the street, and leafleting. The time she spent living in poverty in Kings Cross and Redfern and volunteering for the CPA informed some of her later works. In the period of McCarthyism their house was a regular meeting place for the CPA, devoted to printing and distributing material opposing the Communist Party Dissolution referendum and later the Petrov Commission. During this period, Hewett wrote mostly journalism, under pseudonyms, for the &quot;&quot;Tribune&quot;&quot;.

The following year her first child, Clancy, died of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Melbourne, an event which was to have a profound effect on the rest of her life.

In 1952, Hewett and Flood joined a trade union delegation to Russia, and they were among the first Westerners to visit the new People&#x27;s Republic of China.

Hewett worked for a year as a mill hand in a cotton spinning mill, which gave her the material for her first novel, &quot;Bobbin Up&quot;. The climatic moment is a strike by the women workers against poor working conditions and unfair dismissals. The style and content are firmly rooted in socialist realism&quot;.&quot; &quot;Bobbin Up&quot; was translated into five languages&quot;.&quot;

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Hewett engaged in debates about literature and social change from a committed Marxist perspective. She was one of the founders of the left-wing organisation the Union of Australian Women, editing the first edition of their journal, and she participated enthusiastically in Realist Writers groups in Sydney and Perth.

Flood had recurring paranoid schizophrenia, untreatable at the time, and was unable to work. Hewett took a job as a copywriter on the catalogue of Walton Sears Department Store to support the family, and then with Leyden Publishing. In 1958, as Flood became increasingly violent and dangerous, she fled back to her parents in Western Australia with their three small boys Joe, Michael and Tom Flood.

In South Perth her parents built a house for her on the old tennis court at the back of their property. Rebuilding her life, Hewett trained at the Graylands Teachers&#x27; College but was removed when they found she had been not only married but divorced.

In 1960, she married the poet, cane cutter and seaman, Merv Lilley. Lilley had been a foundation member of the Bush Music Club, and he introduced the family to folk music, which was beginning its revival. In late 1961, the family, which now included one-year-old Kate Lilley, travelled to Queensland with a caravan to visit Lilley&#x27;s family. Before leaving WA, Hewett and Lilley roneoed a joint volume of their poetry &quot;What About the People!&quot; In the next few years a number of these poems were put to music by aspiring folk singers. &quot;Weevils in the Flour&quot;, a song about the Depression childhood of her friend Vera Deacon, has been a favourite with union choirs and folk singers, with a folklore all of its own. Another song, &quot;Sailor Home From the Sea&quot;, has been recorded under four different tunes.

Les Flood had been sighted in WA, and to avoid him, the family remained in Queensland for a year and bought an old house in Wynnum, Brisbane. The house had no water or sewerage and Hewett caught an intestinal bug. Afterwards she had ongoing health problems that often confined her to bed.

During 1962, the family participated in the radical salon society along the Brisbane foreshore, led by John Manifold the folklorist and poet. With Nancy Wills, Hewett wrote a short political musical play &quot;Ballad of Women&quot;, which contains many of the Brechtian elements and figures of her later musicals. She began to publish new poems in &quot;Tribune&quot;, mostly paeans to socialism. As they made the long return journey to Perth on the Trans Australian Railway at the end of the year, Hewett went into labour with her sixth child and the baby Rozanna was delivered in Kalgoorlie.

In Perth, Hewett completed her Arts degree and obtained a position as a university tutor in English at the University of Western Australia, which she held until 1973. She financially supported her family with some help from Lilley and her parents.

Hewett made a trip to a Weimar Writer&#x27;s Conference in 1965, and was treated for thrombosis in the Soviet Union. Here she became aware of the plight of dissident writers under the heavy censorship regime of the Soviet bloc. Hewett arranged protests on behalf of the Sinyavsky-Daniel trial in 1965, after which she became increasingly disillusioned with Communism. In 1967, she wrote her first full-scale play &quot;This Old Man Comes Rolling Home&quot;, which remains popular today. This would be her last work of socialist realism.

During the Prague Spring in 1968 she was a strong supporter of the moderate Czech regime. She and Lilley organised a protest march in Perth with students and the CPA. Although the CPA distanced itself from the Warsaw Pact Invasion of Czechoslovakia, Hewett subsequently left the Party along with many others. She was attacked by former friends who remained Stalinist hardliners.

== Mature work ==
In 1968, her first volume of verse &quot;Windmill Country&quot; was published, including all her best poems up to that time.

Concerned about critical comments that her first play was dated, she wrote an overtly outré play, the &quot;savage but hilarious attack on academic suburbia&quot; &quot;Mrs Porter and the Angel&quot;. It caricatured members of the UWA English department, so the play was unable to be staged in Perth for fear of defamation proceedings, and it was first performed at the PACT Theatre in Sydney in May 1969.

She continued with a series of expressionist plays. At the end of 1970, her &quot;tour-de-force&quot; play &quot;The&quot; &quot;Chapel Perilous&quot; was staged in Perth. The self-parodying hero, Sally Banner, resonated with the emerging feminist movement and ensured Hewett&#x27;s lasting fame. She followed it in 1972 with &quot;Bonbons and Roses for Dolly&quot;, a musical play about failed dreams set in an idealised Regal Theatre.

In 1973, Hewett received the first of eight grants from the new Literature Board of the Australia Council. She was over 50 years old when she was at last enabled to become a full-time professional writer.

She returned in late 1973 to her &quot;city of marvellous experience&quot; Sydney, where she bought a rambling terrace in Woollahra with her share of her recently deceased mother&#x27;s estate. Here she enjoyed her most productive years, creating in quick succession: &quot;The Tatty Hollow Story&quot; (a woman who cannot be defined by her former lovers); &quot;The Golden Oldies&quot; (for two actors and two dummies); the opera extravaganza &quot;Joan&quot; (her only work set outside of Australia, with 75 actors and 40 musicians); the show musical &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Cross&quot;; the rock opera &quot;Catspaw; The Fields of Heaven&quot; for the Festival of Perth; and two books of poetry &quot;Rapunzel in Suburbia&quot; and &quot;Greenhouse&quot;. In 1977 she wrote her most popular play &quot;The Man from Mukinupin&quot;.

In collaboration with poets associated with the &quot;Generation of &#x27;68&quot; and &quot;New Poetry&quot; magazine, particularly Robert Adamson (with whom she maintained a close lifetime friendship), her work became more sparse and directed and the romantic element more controlled.

In 1981, after her children had left home, she moved to another large, semi-ruined terrace in the centre of Darlinghurst. In the 1980s, she published the poetry collections &quot;Alice in Wormland&quot; and &quot;Peninsula&quot;. The latter was written in Portsea, Melbourne, in a cottage &quot;Imara&quot; made available to writers by Neilma Gantner. A number of less-successful plays were trialled, sometimes in playhouses in country towns. Towards the end of her time in Darlinghurst, she wrote the first volume of her autobiography &quot;Wild Card&quot;, which covers the years 1923 to 1958. She completed the book during a trip to Oxford, England. Encouraged by its success, she continued with further works.

==Later years==

Hewett moved at the end of 1991 to an old coach house at Faulconbridge in the Blue Mountains west of Sydney. She wrote two moderately successful novels, and a poetry collection &quot;Halfway Up the Mountain&quot;, but struggled to get new theatre work onto the stage until she wrote the successful play &quot;Nowhere&quot;, which was staged in 2001. She was disabled by osteoarthritis and was progressively reliant on a wheelchair and then bedridden. Her husband Lilley cared for her into his eighties. She died from recurring breast cancer on 25 August 2002. At the time of her death she was working on the second volume of her autobiography.

== Literary style and contribution ==
According to The Oxford Companion to Australian Literature, Hewett used &quot;poetry, music and symbol to portray life&#x27;s paradoxes and her characters&#x27; mingling of perception and delusion&quot; while adding &quot;her verse is confessional and romantic in theme, wryly humorous, frankly bawdy, varied in tone and rich in imagery&quot;.

D&#x27;Aeth finds a &quot;dizzying amplitude of styles in her work, beginning with modernism in her early poems through socialist realism to expressionist musical farce, followed by a late response to American poetic experimentation in the 1950s and 1960s&quot;, citing her trademark &quot;vivid phantasmagoria and baroque larrikin humour&quot;. Even a single play like &quot;The Chapel Perilous&quot; employs tragedy, farce, naturalism, Brechtian expressionism and musical comedy in quick succession. In fact, Hewett paid scant attention to convention or literary fashion, following her own muse on topics she believed were important. Even during her Realist Writer period, her works were much more passionate and dramatic than was normal for the socialist realism genre.

She and Alma De Groen were almost the only female playwrights during the Australian drama renaissance of the 1970s. When most plays of the time were naturalistic along the style of TV dramas, Hewett&#x27;s plays incorporated allusion, mystery, landscape, poetry, songs and music, with lashings of ironic humour that saved her characters from excessive posturing. Much of her work was autobiographical and intensely personal, and several works were set in her childhood dreamscape of wheatbelt Western Australia.

Hewett worked directly with most of the major directors and actors of the time, and was her own dramaturg during first-time performances. Female actors particularly appreciated the strong roles they were given in Hewett&#x27;s plays.

Various musicians have set Hewett&#x27;s words to music. &quot;Weevils in the Flour&quot; has been recorded six times, most notably by Declan Affley and The Bushwackers. Robyn Archer recorded a rock version of Hewett&#x27;s poem &quot;In Moncur Street&quot;. A number of composers worked with Hewett on music for her plays, notably Jim Cotter and Patrick Flynn. While the lyrics in the plays were published with the text, unfortunately the music was never published or recorded, so it usually had to be re-composed for any subsequent staging.

She was appointed as Writer in Residence in eight Australian universities and one in the USA between 1975 and 1990, where she participated fully in university life, giving encouragement to younger writers.

Her very late emergence as a major figure prevented her travelling abroad to publicise her work to any extent. &quot;Bobbin Up&quot; was published throughout Europe and therefore is well known internationally. However, with the exception of &quot;The&quot; &quot;Man from Mukinupin&quot;, which was staged in London, her plays never found their way outside Australia.

== Personal life ==
For much of her life after 1960, Hewett struggled with ill-health, apart from a very active period in the 1970s. She had thrombosis from 1965. Her ongoing gastric trouble and a slipped retina were corrected by surgery in 1971–72. Progressive osteoarthritis restricted her mobility from the late 1970s, and many of her later works were written in bed, where she also received visitors.

The necessity to support a large family was also a major limitation on her activity. She only became a full-time writer from the age of 51, with the aid of Literature Board grants, intermittent earnings from writing and from university fellowships, and an ongoing bequest from her father&#x27;s estate.

== Controversies ==

Her early romantic involvements, her attempted suicide and her membership of the CPA greatly distressed her parents and grandparents. On the other hand, when she left the CPA she was strongly attacked by hard-line Communist colleagues, though the Party always claimed her as their own. Padraic McGuiness attacked her as a former Communist immediately after her death.

The subject matter and language of her plays could be shocking to members of her audience. The publisher sent warnings to school librarians to return &quot;Chapel Perilous&quot; if necessary, and most of them did. Women rushed out of a performance of &quot;Bonbons and Roses&quot; in tears when menstruation took place on stage, and flowers were placed in the theatre toilets in protest. Mixed reviews and modest box office takings caused the hyped musical &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Cross&quot; to shoulder part of the blame for the failure of the new Paris Theatre company in 1978.

Hewett&#x27;s characters and locations often derived from real life but could sometimes be too thinly disguised. In 1977, her first husband Lloyd Davies sued her for libel for a poem &quot;The Uninvited Guest&quot; – possibly the first time someone has been sued for a poem. The action was protested across the nation, with the South Australian Parliament choosing to read the poem into its records. Several fundraising events opposing censorship were held to help defray the legal defence costs, and Bob Hudson recorded a satirical song &quot;Libel&quot; to assist. The matter was settled out-of-court, the book was recalled and the offending poem was removed. The plays &quot;The&quot; &quot;Chapel Perilous&quot; and &quot;The Tatty Hollow Story&quot;, which contained unflattering depictions of a Davies-like character, could not be shown in Perth. Davies subsequently wrote a rambling defence of his lawsuit and conducted a lecture tour in support.

Hewett was outspoken in defence of Australian literature, especially in her later years. In 2000 Hewett launched a broadside at lack of support for writers by publishing houses and governments, saying independent publishing houses were being taken over by big overseas companies, that the price of books was rising, and only generous public funding would enable experimental writing and young, unknown writers to find a place.

In 2018, fifteen years after her death, Hewett&#x27;s two daughters appeared on the front page of &quot;The Australian&quot;, and in other media interviews. The women stated that they had been very sexually active as teenagers in the 1970s, with their parents&#x27; knowledge and tacit approval. Some of their sexual activity had been conducted with adult visitors to Woollahra, specifically naming the political writer Bob Ellis, Martin Sharp and other deceased celebrities. Kate Lilley asserted that on several occasions, sex with unnamed men had not been consensual. The two women believed their mother had not ensured their safety. The accusations were not confirmed and no charges were laid.

A media frenzy ensued, in which the tabloid press attacked &quot;paedophile rings&quot;, the libertarian 1970s, Hewett&#x27;s lapsed Communism, and Ellis in particular, who was detested by conservatives. The Australian Senate passed a motion raised by Senator Cory Bernardi, calling for renaming of the Dorothy Hewett Award at the University of Western Australia. The university did not comply.

<text>A network access server (NAS) is a group of components that provides remote users with a point of access to a network.

==Overview==
A NAS concentrates dial-in and dial-out user communications. An access server may have a mixture of analog and digital interfaces and support hundreds of simultaneous users. A NAS consists of a communications processor that connects asynchronous devices to a LAN or WAN through network and terminal emulation software. It performs both synchronous and asynchronous routing of supported protocols.

The NAS is meant to act as a gateway to guard access to a protected resource. This can be anything from a telephone network, to printers, to the Internet. A client connects to the NAS. The NAS then connects to another resource asking whether the client&#x27;s supplied credentials are valid. Based on that answer the NAS then allows or disallows access to the protected resource.

==Examples==
The above translates into different implementations for different uses. Here are some examples.

*An Internet service provider which provides network access via common modem or modem-like devices (be it PSTN, DSL, cable or GPRS/UMTS) can have one or more NAS (network access server) devices which accept PPP, PPPoE or PPTP connections, checking credentials and recording accounting data via back-end RADIUS servers, and allowing users access through that connection.
* The captive portal mechanism used by many WiFi providers: a user wants to access the Internet and opens a browser. The NAS detects that the user is not currently authorized to have access to the Internet, so the NAS prompts the user for their username and password. The user supplies them and sends them back to the NAS. The NAS then uses the RADIUS protocol to connect to an AAA server and passes off the username and password. The RADIUS server searches through its resources and finds that the credentials are valid and notifies the NAS that it should grant the access. The NAS then grants the user access to the Internet.
*Another use of a NAS would be in voice over IP (VoIP). However, instead of using a username and password, many times a phone number or IP Address are used. If the phone number is a valid customer then the call can be completed. Other uses might be to verify whether a phone number has long distance access or a telephone card has minutes left.

==Associated protocols==
Although not required, NASs are almost exclusively used with authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) servers. Of the AAA protocols available, RADIUS tends to be the most widely used. The Diameter base protocol extends RADIUS services by providing error handling and inter-domain communications. This protocol is used in networks like the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS).

<text>In geometry, a hendecagram (also endecagram or endekagram) is a star polygon that has eleven vertices.

The name &quot;hendecagram&quot; combines a Greek numeral prefix, &quot;&quot;, with the Greek suffix &quot;&quot;. The &quot;hendeca-&quot; prefix derives from Greek ἕνδεκα (ἕν + δέκα, one + ten) meaning &quot;eleven&quot;. The &quot;-gram&quot; suffix derives from γραμμῆς (&quot;grammēs&quot;) meaning a line.

==Regular hendecagrams==
There are four regular hendecagrams, which can be described by the notation
{11/2}, {11/3}, {11/4}, and {11/5}; in this notation, the number after the slash indicates the number of steps between pairs of points that are connected by edges. These same four forms can also be considered as stellations of a regular hendecagon.

Since 11 is prime, all hendecagrams are star polygons and not compound figures.

==Construction==
As with all odd regular polygons and star polygons whose orders are not products of distinct Fermat primes, the regular hendecagrams cannot be constructed with compass and straightedge.
However, describe folding patterns for making the hendecagrams {11/3}, {11/4}, and {11/5} out of strips of paper.

==Applications==

Prisms over the hendecagrams {11/3} and {11/4} may be used to approximate the shape of DNA molecules.
Fort Wood, now the base of the Statue of Liberty in New York City, is a star fort in the form of an irregular 11-point star.

The Topkapı Scroll contains images of an 11-pointed star Girih form used in Islamic art. The star in this scroll is not one of the regular forms of the hendecagram, but instead uses lines that connect the vertices of a hendecagon to nearly-opposite midpoints of the hendecagon&#x27;s edges. 11-pointed star Girih patterns are also used on the exterior of the Momine Khatun Mausoleum; Eric Broug writes that its pattern &quot;can be considered a high point in Islamic geometric design&quot;.

An 11-point star-shaped cross-section was used in the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster, for the core of the forward section of the rocket (the hollow space within which the fuel burns). This design provided more surface area and greater thrust in the earlier part of a launch, and a slower burn rate and reduced thrust after the points of the star were burned away, at approximately the same time as the rocket passed the sound barrier.

<text>Britannia Superior (Latin for &quot;Upper Britain&quot;) was a province of Roman Britain created after the civil war between Septimius Severus and Clodius Albinus. Although Herodian credits Severus with dividing Roman Britain into the Northern territory of Britannia Inferior and the Southern territory of Britannia Superior, modern scholarship argues that it is more likely that Caracalla was the person who made the split sometime in the early 3rd century CE. The previous British capital Londinium remained the centre of Britannia Superior while Eboracum, or modern York was the capital of Britannia Inferior. Epigraphical evidence shows that Upper Britain encompassed approximately what is now Wales, southern England and East Anglia. However, the official boundary between Britannia Superior and Inferior is still unclear.

Although Londinium went through a period of decline during this time, the province as a whole continued to be developed. Villas were expanded and a new wall around the capital was created.

Governors of Britannia Superior are difficult to trace and it is hard to decipher exactly when the province became distinct from its twin Britannia Inferior. Also, little information about their system of governance or their peoples exist today. However, some archeological research of Britannia Superior leads historians to believe that Romano-British relations may have to be restudied with a more modern approach.

Due to instability within the Roman Empire, reforms by Diocletian and Carausius&#x27; usurping total provincial power in the late 3rd century, the province was restructured by Constantius early in the 4th century.

== Build up and civil war ==
After the murder of Emperor Commodus on 31 December 192 AD, Pertinax was chosen by Commodus&#x27; conspirators as a suitable replacement for the title of Roman ruler. He would be the first of five Emperors during 193AD, known as the tumultuous Year of the Five Emperors. During this year, the leader of the Roman Empire was to be decided within a civil war between its three largest military forces. This civil war was contested by Clodius Albinus in Britain, Septimius Severus in the Danube and Syrian leader Pescinnius Niger.

Following the murder of Pertinax by his own guard on 28 March 193 AD Severus and Albinus swore an alliance as shown on the altar Ostia. The altar shows that all names (including Albinus&#x27;) apart from Severus&#x27; have been etched out of the inscription. This is evidence that Severus eventually become the victor of the civil war. During the alliance with Albinus, Severus gave himself the name Petrinax to avenge the recently murdered emperor. Severus marched on Rome and disbanded the Praetorian guard with his own installment.

The tension between Severus and Albinus&#x27; contest to usurp the Roman Empire&#x27;s throne resulted in the Battle of Lugdunum (modern day Lyon) on 19 February 197. According to Cassius Dio&#x27;s &quot;Roman History&quot; Severus and Albinus were equally armed with 150 000 soldiers on both sides at Lyon. The skirmish went back and forth but the decisive collapse of Albinus&#x27; left wing turned the battle in favor of a Severus victory. Once he realized that his defeat was imminent Albinus committed suicide giving Severus total control of the Roman Empire.

== The split of Roman Britain ==
According to Roman historian Herodian&#x27;s work &quot;History of the Empire&quot;, Severus split Roman Britain into Upper and Lower provinces soon after the Battle of Lugdunum. However there is still confusion among historians as to the exact date and circumstances behind the division of Roman Britain.

A.J. Graham argues this matter of doubt is due to a considerable lack of evidence for Herodian&#x27;s division date of 197AD. Related evidence of Legion lists by Cassius Dio could possibly be used to confirm Herodian&#x27;s claims but Dio&#x27;s inscriptions are undated. Graham concludes that Severus did not split Roman Britain himself. Instead Graham argues the split would have officially taken place under the power Severus&#x27; co-emperor Caracella sometime between 211 and 220 AD. Graham concludes that although the specifics of the division are inconclusive the nature of the split is still important. The distinction of Superior and Inferior is important because the inferior Lower Britain lay in the northernmost part of the province. This fact reveals Caracella&#x27;s passive nature of agreement and retreat with the Maetian barbarians beyond the Roman border.

Epigraphical evidence shows that an inscription made during the time of Lucius Julius Julianus between 198-209 AD describes his legions being based at Caerleon in what was to become Upper Britain. This leads historians to believe Britain had still not been divided by 209 AD. This is also evidence that although fewer legions were in the north, Lower Britain relied on soldiers from the south. Evidence pointing towards the existence of a southern concord serving near Corbridge in Lower Britain exists. Another altar devoted to a southern commander proves that detachments of two Upper Britain legions were serving together on the northern frontier.

The rank between the governors of Superior and Inferior is important. Because of the division of legions historians assume that the governor of Britannia Superior held a consular rank while his opposite in Britannia Inferior was a lower praetorian rank. This also has created confusion among historians because it has been suggested that during wartime the governor of Britannia Superior would take lead of the northern armies which would vitiate the reasons behind the split in the first place. What historians can safely agree on is that Roman Britain had very different systems of rule between the imperial reign of Severus and his successor Caracalla.

Severus&#x27; influence on the split is that as Emperor he performed this same action of division by separating Roman Syria in 194 AD. However, if the division is attributed to Caracella, he did this while also readjusting the boundaries of Pannonias Superior and Pannonias Inferior in 213 or 214 AD. He divided the four total legions equally between both provinces, unlike he did in Britain. Instead two legions garrisoned Upper Britain while Lower Britain only had access to one. Although not totally a similar move, this has been extrapolated by historians as a general policy move the Roman Empire had made towards its provinces at the time.

The split of Britain into upper and lower provinces demonstrates a problem that faced the Roman province. It was necessary to prevent a large army being in the hands of a single governor on the peripheries of the empires. The power base was too strong as seen in Albinus&#x27; ability to mobilize a large military in his conflict with Severus.

The division created two separate capitals of Roman Britain. Londinium (present day London) was the capital of Superior, and Eboracum (present day York) was created as the capital of Britannia Inferior. Due to the unsettled Maetae population to the north of Britannia Inferior, Severus decided to rule the entire Roman Empire from Eboracum while trying to regain control of island.

== Buildings ==
During Britannia Superior&#x27;s time as a province, the building of fortifications was seen throughout the territory. This was not for any military purpose because there was no true offensive threat to Upper Britain. Towns were fortified at their own leisure. Verulalium and Winchester had already begun to be fortified in the first century AD, but building continued throughout the second century until at least 270 AD. The building of these fortification walls may have become an area of contest, at least between the three main colonies. However, the lack of fortifications around smaller villas leads scholars to believe that there was no real threat of peasant revolt at this time even if it was on the mind of Roman elites.

The purpose of the walls remain unclear. The towns would have needed a valid reason to convince the Emperor to allow them the resources and manpower to build because they were not simple projects. Emperors seemed concerned that if these towns were surprisingly overtaken by a peasant revolt that the fortifications could be used against the Romans.

Although the villas mentioned above may not have been heavily fortified there is archeological evidence to suggest a period of intense building to expand the infrastructure of villas around the Upper Province. For example, two villas on the outer ridge of the Cotswolds called Witcombe and Frocester Court were enlarged between 270-275 AD.

It is also thought that the Emperor Probus made sure to fortify coastal dwellings within the province. This was done in tandem with sea fortifications in Gaul to guarantee a safer hold on the Oceanus Britannicus (renamed to English channel). 

==Londinium==
Due to the lack of minted coins in Roman Britain during part of the Severan period (180–253 CE), it is hard for scholars to tell whether Upper Britain as a whole province was in a period of decline or not, even though there is much evidence towards a decline in Londinium. It is clearly known that there was at least enough money and resources to complete a new wall of Londinium during this period. The discovery of a coin containing the image of Commodus at a London site leads historians to believe that the wall was not completed no earlier than 190 CE, and perhaps as late as 220 CE. The new wall was 9 ft (2.7m) thick at ground level, including an 8 ft (2.4m)-thick plinth above.

The work was beyond local capability at the time which meant that the order to build it must have come from the top of the Roman Empire. The wall was either commissioned by Albinus or Severus. To tell which leader built the wall, both of their motivations have been studied by historians. City walls served as a main protector against enemies, but most towns in Britain did not receive much fortification until the late 2nd century. Archeology shows that the wall was not made in haste to combat any type of emergency at Londinium. Historians say this lack of haste could be proof that Albinus had the wall built foreseeing it would be wise to have a better fortified British capital when he withdrew most of his troops toward Rome to fight for the throne in the 190s.

Historians still ponder why Severus did not knock down Albinus&#x27; wall upon his arrival in Britain. The most prevalent theory states that because Severus was more concerned with the northern instability within Britain, he decided to keep the walls intact. This also leads researchers to believe Severus would not have planned a Londinium wall to be built before his arrival in the province because the capital was already a stable area.

Although this was a time of economic collapse, monumental sculptures which were made during this time have been unearthed too. 52 massive blocks of limestone built into the fourth-century riverside wall (the wall&#x27;s extension), some with indented ornaments, were found in 1975; 45 of them in turn came from two extremely large monuments figures containing Hercules, Minerva, Mars and many other Roman deities.

Gatehouses were also built at Ludgate, Newgate, Bishopgate and Aldgate. These smaller walls and gatehouses were also completed in the middle of London&#x27;s recession, when suburbs such as Walbrook and Southwark lay derelict.

== Governance ==
Under the peace restored by Caracella, both the Upper and Lower provinces began a system of governance that was both similar and distinct. Although the provinces were technically separated, two inscriptions from Geta Bridge and one from Cherterholm mention that the governor of Superior spoke of &quot;beneficiarri&quot; from his staff on duty in the Lower province. Scholars note that, for a time at least, Britain continued to be governed as a single entity. This means that consular governors like Geta Caesar and Ulpius Marcellus would have been the last two governors before the division. After that, it becomes unclear which specific governors oversaw the Upper Province. It is also unclear what type of general administrative changes happened after the division. The most current theory is that civil jurisdiction over the Lower Province was given to the commander of the Legion at York, but the consular Governor of the Southern Province took command over the entire country when needed.

The Governors of Upper Britain were generally of consular rank, including the following:

* Tiberius Julius Pollienus Auspex, a man who may have governed Numidia c. 217-20. His time as governor of Superior may have occurred sometime during c. 223–226.
* Gaius Junius Faustinus Postumianus, a former statesman who had served on Severus&#x27; staff in Britain (probably sometime during 222–235).
* Rufinus. This may have been A. Triarius Rufinus, consul ordinarius in 210, or Q. Aradius Rufinus, a consul who likely served in the early 3rd century.
* Marcus Martiannius Pulcher (middle of the 3rd century).
* Titus Desticius Juba (253–255), noted for the rebuilding of Legio II Augusta&#x27;s Caerleon barracks.

== The dissolution of Britannia Superior ==
The first rumblings of misfortune for Britannia Superior&#x27;s prosperity occurred in 260 AD. The Roman Empire was having trouble with German invasions and briefly lost control over some of its provinces. Britannia, along with Germania, Gaul and Hispania adhered to an independent emperor. This territory was called &quot;The Empire of the Gallic Provinces&quot; or in Latin &quot;Imperium Galliarum&quot;. Relative peace in Upper Britain may have contributed to a sense of ease in the Gallic emperor because Britain brought much propaganda power.

The Roman Empire suffered during this period. After the murder of Gordian III in 244 CE and until Diocletian (284 CE) fifty-five different emperors declared themselves &quot;Caesar&quot;.

The importance of a strong Oceanus Britannicus (between Britannia and Gaul) reoccurs in 287 AD. Carausius, a senior Roman officer was suspected of collusion with pirates on the channel. To save himself from execution, he rebelled and took over the entirety of Britain. Protected by the sea, Carausius&#x27; reign was particularly hard to dislodge. In 293, he was murdered by his own finance minister Alectus, but only after he had already lost control over parts of Britain.

Alectus took control of Roman Britain in the autumn of 293; however his reign was short and uneventful. In September of 296, the new Emperor Constantius launched an invasion of Britain. With his colleague Asclepiodotus creating a diversion in the Channel, Carausius took advantage of mist to elude enemy fleets and landed near Southampton. Alectus was not a very strong strategic commander and he made an error of not instigating a naval battle. He was caught on his back foot by the invasion. Although Constantius had to return due to bad weather, Alectus was defeated at an inland battle near modern day Silchester. It was at this time that the new conqueror began the first revision of Roman Britain since Caracella. It seems likely that Britannia Superior and Inferior were instantly separated into smaller territorial units. Scholars think that Constantius first divided Upper Britain in two, giving Chester to a new province centered on London and chiseled out the eastern part of Superior from the southern part of Inferior. By the time of the Verona List (313–314 AD), the four new provinces of Roman Britain were Britannia Prima, B. Secunda, Maxima Caesariensis and Flavia Caesariensis.
== Historical significance ==
Near the end of the first century, Britannia Superior was the home to a changing supply of pottery and cultural practices. Observations on South East British settlements during this period show that efforts of globalization could be found in Roman Britain. In particular, researchers found that areas which fell within Britannia Superior proved that cultural hybridization could occur even within an elite ruling culture. This led researchers to a discovery that Romanization was not necessarily an elitist ideology which forced Britain to aspire to what was &quot;Roman&quot;. Instead, Romano-British cultures changed in a way that falls outside the elitist paradigm. It is more likely that these two cultures hybridized themselves in a more progressive way of connectivity instead of a power structure of subjugation.

== Upper Britain&#x27;s Seal ==

According to a 1993 discovery at Burgh Castle, located in Norfolk, a leaded seal described itself as the &quot;(Seal) of the Province of Upper Britain&quot;. Also on the seal is a stag facing right underneath the coverage of a tree. This has led historians to believe that the stag was thought of as an official animal of Upper Britain. Official seals coming from Lower Britain usually contained bulls.

<text>Britannia Inferior (Latin for &quot;Lower Britain&quot;) was a new province carved out of Roman Britain probably around AD 197 during the reforms of Septimius Severus although the division may have occurred later, between 211 and 220, under Caracalla. The removal of the governors in Londinium from control over the legions guarding Hadrian&#x27;s Wall was aimed at reducing their power, given Clodius Albinus&#x27;s recent bid to become emperor. The province was probably formalised around 214 by Severus&#x27;s son Caracalla.

Including most of modern northern England and the Midlands, the region was governed from the city of Eboracum (modern York) by a praetorian legate in command of a single legion stationed in the city. This subdivision of Britannia lasted throughout the Severan dynasty until the reorganisation of the empire under Diocletian in 296.

==Establishment==
During the reign of Commodus, the defences along the northern border of the empire in Britannia fell into neglect and disrepair. The peace of the region was further disturbed in the tumultuous period after Commodus&#x27; death as the military power vacuum on the continent distracted the defensive legions stationed in Britannia. After his accession in 193, Severus took special interest in refortifying the northern border in Britannia, and in 208 he moved to Eboracum to oversee the military campaigns against the northern tribes. While there is some confusion as to the exact date when the subdivision of Britannia was made, it seems clear that Severus&#x27;s intentions were to break up the size of the military under the command of an individual governor (as he had done in Syria), preventing them from wielding too large a military force, or at least one that could destabilize the emperor&#x27;s control.

An African inscription dated to the reign of Caracalla provides a potential early confirmation of the division occurring under Severus. Herodian puts the date of the split in 197, although there is no evidence of this distinction being formalised in inscriptions until after the death of Severus in 211. Thus, it is likely that the division of military control in Britannia was formally established by Caracalla sometime between 211 and 20. Caracalla also moved the southern border of the province northwards from the line established by Severus, transferring northern modern Wales and the region surrounding Chester to Britannia Superior.

== History ==
In the reign of Severus, the province&#x27;s fortifications were significantly improved in order to provide better defence against northern tribes. A major rebuilding of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall was included among these efforts. The province hosted a single legion during Caracalla&#x27;s reign, the VI Victrix, which was stationed at Eboracum. However, although Britannia Inferior had only the single legion (compared to the two stationed in Britannia Superior) the northern province actually had more soldiers than the south did, as a result of the large number of auxiliaries in the north. After the successes of Severus against the northern tribes, these troops furnished small units known as exploratores which were sent beyond the frontier to oversee native activities and ensure that the terms of Roman treaties with these groups were upheld. These measures were mostly effective and during Britannia Inferior&#x27;s existence the northern border was largely peaceful after the campaign of Severus.

From 260 to 273 AD Britannia Inferior, along with much of the rest of the western Empire, broke away from the rest of the Roman Empire to form the Gallic Empire. The second half of the province&#x27;s history also coincided with a period of poor economic conditions across Roman Britain.

The symbol of the province, attested by several lead sealings, was a bull.

==Reorganisation==
In 296, the emperor Diocletian conducted a major reorganisation of the empire. The newly named Diocese of Britannia was subdivided into four provinces, Britannia Prima and Maxima Caesariensis from Britannia Superior and Britannia Secunda (capital in Eboracum) and Flavia Caesariensis (capital in Lindum) from Britannia Inferior.

<doc id="1173112" wikidata="Q845763" url="?curid=1173112" title="Millet (Ottoman Empire)">
<text>In the Ottoman Empire, a millet (; ) was an independent court of law pertaining to &quot;personal law&quot; under which a confessional community (a group abiding by the laws of Muslim sharia, Christian canon law, or Jewish halakha) was allowed to rule itself under its own laws.

Despite frequently being referred to as a &quot;system&quot;, before the nineteenth century the organization of what are now retrospectively called millets in the Ottoman Empire was not at all systematic. Rather, non-Muslims were simply given a significant degree of autonomy within their own community, without an overarching structure for the &quot;millet&quot; as a whole. The notion of distinct &quot;millets&quot; corresponding to different religious communities within the empire would not emerge until the eighteenth century. Subsequently, the &quot;millet&quot; system was justified through numerous foundation myths linking it back to the time of Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror (r. 1451–81), although it is now understood that no such system existed in the fifteenth century. Heads of millets, or &quot;milletbaşı&quot; (Ethnarch), usually had absolute secular and ecclesiastical power over their communities, being answerable only to the Sultan.

During the 19th century rise of nationalism in the Ottoman Empire, as a result of the Tanzimat reforms (1839–76), the term was used for legally protected &quot;ethno-linguistic&quot; minority groups, similar to the way other countries use the word &quot;nation&quot;. During this era, the status of these groups, their relation to the central government, and their self-governance, were codified into constitutions, elevating the power of the laity at the expense of clergy. The word &quot;millet&quot; comes from the Arabic word &quot;millah&quot; (ملة) and literally means &quot;nation&quot;. Abdulaziz Sachedina regards the millet system as an example of pre-modern religious pluralism, as the state recognized multiple different religious groups in exchange for some control over religious identification and the enforcement of orthodoxy. Notably, Ethnarchs principally conversed with the Foreign Ministry, as if they represented foreign nations, but after 1878 it was through the Justice Ministry.

Historian Johann Strauss wrote that the term &quot;seems to be so essential for the understanding of the Ottoman system and especially the status of non-Muslims&quot;. Other authors interpret the &quot;millet&quot; system as one form of non-territorial autonomy and consider it as such a potentially universal solution to the modern issues of ethnic and religious diversity. According to Taner Akçam, the Ottoman state was &quot;... based on the principle of heterogeneity and difference rather than homogeneity and sameness, [which] functioned in an opposite way to modern nation-states.&quot;

== Term ==

The term &quot;millet&quot;, which originates from the Arabic &quot;milla&quot;, had three basic meanings in Ottoman Turkish: religion, religious community and nation. The first sense derives from Quranic usage and is attested in Ottoman administrative documents into the 19th century. Benjamin Braude has argued that before the Tanzimat reforms, the word &quot;millet&quot; in the sense of religious community denoted the Muslim religious community or the Christians outside of the Ottoman Empire. This view is supported by Donald Quataert. In contrast, Michael Ursinus writes that the word was used to refer to non-Muslim subjects of the Ottoman Empire even before that time. The term was used inconsistently prior to the 19th century.

The systematic use of &quot;millet&quot; as designation for non-Muslim Ottoman communities dates from the reign of Sultan Mahmud II () in the early 19th century, when official documentation came to reiterate that non-Muslim subjects were organized into three officially sanctioned &quot;millets&quot;: Greek Orthodox, Armenian, and Jewish. The bureaucrats of this era asserted that the millet system was a tradition dating back to the reign of Sultan Mehmed I (). Many historians have accepted this claim and assumed that a &quot;millet&quot; system of this form existed since early Ottoman times. Recent scholarship has cast doubt on this idea, showing that it was rather a later political innovation, which was introduced in the rhetorical garb of an ancient tradition. The Ottoman state used religion rather than ethnicity to define each &quot;millet&quot;, and people who study the Ottoman Empire do not define the Muslims as being in a &quot;millet&quot;.

The Ottoman Turkish version of the Ottoman Constitution of 1876 uses the word &quot;&quot;millet&quot;, as do the Arabic and Persian versions; despite this, at the time the usage of the Arabic word &quot;milla&quot;&quot; was declining in favour of the word &quot;ummah&quot;.

The Armenian, Greek, and Jewish residents did not use the word &quot;millet&quot; and instead described themselves as &quot;nations&quot; (, Armenian: ազգ (azg), Greek: Έθνος (ethnos), and Ladino: &quot;nasyon&quot;). The lack of use of the word &quot;&quot;millet&quot; among the Christian and Jewish minorities reflected in versions of the Ottoman Constitution in their respective languages: The French version of the Ottoman Constitution used the word &quot;communauté&quot; in the place of &quot;millet&quot;&quot;, and so the others used words modeled after or based on the French: հասարակութիւն (&quot;hasarakut&#x27;iwn&quot;) in Armenian, общност/община (&quot;obstina&quot;) in Bulgarian, κοινότης (&quot;koinotēs&quot;) in Greek, and &quot;komunita&quot; in Judaeo-Spanish.

== Concept ==

The millet system is closely linked to Islamic rules on the treatment of non−Muslim minorities living under Islamic dominion (&quot;dhimmi&quot;). The Ottoman term specifically refers to the separate legal courts pertaining to personal law under which minorities were allowed to rule themselves (in cases not involving any Muslim) with fairly little interference from the Ottoman government.

People were bound to their &quot;millets&quot; by their religious affiliations (or their confessional communities), rather than their ethnic origins, according to the &quot;millet&quot; concept (excepting the Armenian case, until the modern era). The &quot;millets&quot; had a great deal of power – they set their own laws and collected and distributed their own taxes. All that was required was loyalty to the Empire. When a member of one &quot;millet&quot; committed a crime against a member of another, the law of the injured party applied, but the ruling Islamic majority being paramount, any dispute involving a Muslim fell under their sharia-based law.

Later, the perception of the &quot;millet&quot; concept was altered in the 19th century by the rise of nationalism within the Ottoman Empire.

== &quot;Millets&quot; ==
Although the Ottoman administration of non-Muslim subjects was not uniform until the 19th century and varied according to region and group, it is possible to identify some common patterns for earlier epochs. Christian and Jewish communities were granted a large degree of autonomy. Tax collection, education, legal and religious affairs of these communities were administered by their own leaders. This enabled the Ottomans to rule over diverse peoples with &quot;a minimum of resistance&quot;. The Jewish community, in particular, prospered under Ottoman rule, and its ranks were swelled with the arrival of Jews who were expelled from Spain. At the same time, non-Muslims were subject to several forms of discrimination and excluded from the Ottoman ruling elite. Armenians formed three &quot;millets&quot; under the Ottoman rule. A wide array of other groups such as Catholics, Karaites, and Samaritans was also represented.

=== Muslims ===
The large number of Circassians in the Ottoman Empire was mainly due to the Crimean War. During the war and following years, many Circassians fled the conquest of their homeland by Russia. Circassians in the Ottoman Empire, despite being Muslim, mainly kept to themselves and maintained their separate identity, even having their own courts, in which they would tolerate no outside influence.

=== Orthodox Christians ===

The Orthodox Christians were included in the &quot;Rum Millet&quot; (&quot;millet-i Rûm&quot;) or the &quot;Roman nation&quot;, and enjoyed a certain autonomy. It was named after Roman (&quot;Byzantine&quot;) subjects of the Ottoman Empire, but Orthodox Greeks, Bulgarians, Albanians, Georgians, Arabs, Aromanians, Megleno-Romanians, Romanians, and Serbs were all considered part of the same &quot;millet&quot; despite their differences in ethnicity and language and despite the fact that the religious hierarchy was dominated by the Greeks. Nevertheless, ethnonyms never disappeared and some form of ethnic identity was preserved as evident from a Sultan&#x27;s Firman from 1680, that lists the ethnic groups in the Balkans as follows: Greeks (&quot;Rum&quot;), Albanians (&quot;Arnaut&quot;), Serbs (&quot;Sirf&quot;), &quot;Vlachs&quot; (&quot;Eflak&quot;, referring to the Aromanians and Megleno-Romanians), and Bulgarians (Bulgar).

The Ecumenical Patriarch was recognized as the highest religious and political leader (&quot;millet-bashi&quot;, or ethnarch) of all Eastern Orthodox subjects of the Sultan, though in certain periods some major powers, such as Russia (under the 1774 Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca), or Britain claimed the rights of protection over the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s Orthodox subjects. The Serbian Patriarchate of Peć and the Archbishopric of Ohrid, autonomous Orthodox Churches under the tutelage of the Ecumenical Patriarch, were taken over by the Greek Phanariots during the 18th century, in 1766 and 1767 respectively.

By the 19th century the Orthodox Christian millet was dominated by Greeks, which were worried of Bulgarian and Romanian autocephalism. Over the course of 1860–1862, a series of laws were produced by a constitutional committee which, taken together, make up the Basic Laws of the Greek Orthodox Millet.

=== Armenians ===
Until the 19th century, there was a single Armenian &quot;millet&quot; (millet-i Ermeniyân) which served all ethnic Armenians irrespective of whether they belonged to the Armenian Apostolic Church, the Armenian Catholic Church, or the Armenian Protestant Church (which was formed in the 19th century). Besides a religious role, this &quot;millet&quot; also played a political and cultural role. Namely, it bundled together all Armenian and some other groups, showcasing a shift from religious identity towards national identity. As a result of this, a type of hegemony emerged in which all groups that were under this &quot;millet&quot; had to conform to the norms imposed by the leader of the &quot;millet&quot;, who was appointed by the Sultan. This had a cultural, political, linguistic, and religious effect on all of these groups. Only later did separate Catholic &quot;millets&quot; emerge. Non-Armenians from churches which were theologically linked to the Armenian Church (by virtue of being non-Chalcedonians) were under the authority of the Armenian Patriarchate, although they maintained a separate hierarchy with their own Patriarchs; these groups included the Syriac Orthodox and the Copts. 

Armenian Catholics and Armenian Protestants in 1850 (with British backing) separated from the Armenian Gregorian Millet to become their own millets. After the 1856 Imperial Reform edict, the Armenian Protestant Millet was the first millet to have a constitution sanctioned by the government, which was based on the principle of representative and lay control. Debate for a constitution among the Gregorian Armenians would be influenced by the Protestant Armenians&#x27;. The Armenian Gregorian Millet received a constitution on March 29, 1863, after several years of tensions within the Armenian community between Loussavorial and Khavarials and with the Porte.

=== Assyrians ===
Assyrians are referred to as &#x27;Asuri&#x27; in the Turkish vernacular. Assyrians split by Christian sect were thus treated as separate ethnic groups for the Ottoman government. The Church of the East largely identifies as Assyrian, but the liturgical language is called Syriac, hence multiple &#x27;millets&#x27; for Syriac speaking Assyrians arose as a consequence of the separation by Church affiliation, as was required by 19th century Ottoman law.

The Syriac Catholic community was recognized as its own &quot;millet&quot; in 1829.n and the Chaldean Catholic community was recognized as its own &quot;millet&quot; in 1844. The Syriac Orthodox community in the Ottoman Empire was for long not recognized as its own &quot;millet&quot;, but part of the Armenian &quot;millet&quot; under the Armenian Patriarch. This meant that the Syriac Orthodox were subject to the hegemony of the Armenians linguistically, culturally, politically, and religiously. During the &quot;Tanzimat&quot; reforms (1839–78), the Syriac Orthodox were granted independent status with the recognition of their own &quot;millet&quot; in 1873.

=== Jews ===
Under the &quot;millet&quot; system the Jews were organized as a community on the basis of religion, alongside the other millets (&quot;e.g.&quot; Eastern Orthodox millet, Armenian millet, etc.). They were the most geographically spread group within the empire. Ottoman Jews enjoyed privileges similar to Christians in the Ottoman Empire. In the framework of the &quot;millet&quot; they had a considerable amount of administrative autonomy and were represented by the &quot;Hakham Bashi&quot; ( حاخامباشی), who held broad powers to enact, judge, and enforce the laws among the Jews in the Ottoman Empire and often sat on the Sultan&#x27;s divan. The Jewish millet received a constitution in 1865.

The Jews, like the other &quot;millet&quot; communities of the Ottoman Empire, were still considered &quot;People of the book&quot; and protected by the Sharia Law of Islam. However, while the Jews were not viewed in the eyes of the law as equals of Muslims, they were still treated relatively well at points during the Ottoman Empire. Norman Stillman explains that the prosperity of medieval Jews was closely tied to that of their Muslim governors. Stillman notes that during the time between the 9th and 13th centuries when Jewish culture blossomed, &quot;medieval Islamic civilization was at its apogee&quot;. Given their rampant persecution in medieval Europe, many Jews looked favorably upon &quot;millet&quot;. In the late 19th century such groups as the Bilu, a group of young Russian Jews who were pioneers in the Zionist movement, proposed negotiating with the Sultan to allow a &quot;millet&quot; like settlement which would allow them greater independence in Palestine.

=== Roman Catholics ===

After the Fall of Constantinople, the only Latin Catholic group in the Sultan&#x27;s domain were the Genoese who lived in the Byzantine capital. Over the next decades, Turkish armies pushed into the Balkans, overrunning the Catholic populations of Albania, Bosnia, Croatia, and Hungary.

The Melkite Catholics gained their autonomy as a religious community in 1848 by Sultan Abdulmecid. Bruce Masters claims that Melkite Catholics insisted that they had a &quot;millet&quot; of their own, that would grant them &quot;sense of distinctiveness&quot;.

In the Orient, the 16th century saw the Maronites of Lebanon, the Latins of Palestine, and most of the Greek islands, which once held Latin Catholic communities, come under Turkish rule. Papal response to the loss of these communities was initially a call to the crusade, but the response from the European Catholic monarchs was weak: French interest, moreover, lay in an alliance with the Turks against the Habsburgs. Furthermore, the Catholics of the Ottoman world received a protector at the Porte in the person of the French ambassador. In this way the Roman Catholic &quot;millet&quot; was established at the start of the Tanzimat reforms.

=== Protestants ===
== History ==

=== Use for Sassanid Empire ===

In a 1910 book William Ainger Wigram used the term &quot;melet&quot; in application to the Persian Sasanian Empire, arguing that the situation there was similar to the Ottoman &quot;millet&quot; system and no other term was readily available to describe it. Some other authors have also adopted this usage. The early Christians there formed the Church of the East (later known as the Nestorian Church after the Nestorian schism). The Church of the East&#x27;s leader, the Catholicos or Patriarch of the East, was responsible to the Persian king for the Christians within the Empire. This system of maintaining the Christians as a protected religious community continued after the Islamic conquest of the Sassanids, and the community of Nestorian Christians flourished and was able to send missionaries far past the Empire&#x27;s borders, reaching as far as China and India.

=== 19th century (Reformation Era) ===
In 1839 and 1856, reforms were attempted with the goal of creating equality between the religious communities of the Ottoman Empire. In the course of these reforms, new &quot;millets&quot; emerged, notably for Eastern Catholic and Protestant Christian communities. The heads of each &quot;millet&quot; and clerics in them were also to have their internal rule reviewed by the central government and to keep their power in check. Many clerics in the &quot;millet&quot; system pushed back against these reforms as they believed it was meant to weaken the &quot;millets&quot; and the power these clerics had built for themselves. These &quot;millets&quot;, refusing to give up any autonomy, slowed down the attempted reforms and their impact on the equality of religious communities.

==== Reformulation into Ottomanism ====

Before the turn of the 19th century, the &quot;millets&quot; had a great deal of power – they set their own laws and collected and distributed their own taxes. The Tanzimat reforms aimed to encourage Ottomanism among the subject nations and stop the rise of secessionist nationalist movements. within the Ottoman Empire. The reforms tried to integrate non-Muslims and non-Turks more thoroughly into the Ottoman society with new laws and regulations, but failed.

In 1856, during the Tanzimat era, Sultan Abdulmejid I enacted the &quot;Hatt-ı Hümayun&quot; (modern Turkish &quot;Islahat Fermânı&quot;; &quot;Firman of the Reforms&quot;), which proclaimed freedom of religion and civil equality of all religious communities. It further granted the authorities in each &quot;millet&quot; greater privileges and self-governing powers, but also required oaths of allegiance to the Sultan.

In March 1863, the Sultan enacted the &quot;Regulation of the Armenian Nation&quot; (Turkish: &quot;Nizâmnâme−i Millet−i Ermeniyân&quot;): a constitution for the Armenian Orthodox Gregorian nation (&quot;millet&quot;) of that time. This document was drawn up by Armenian intelligentsia, which sought to curb the powers of the Armenian Patriarch and nobility. It created an Armenian National Assembly.

These two reforms, which were theoretically perfect examples of social change by law, caused serious stress on the Ottoman political and administrative structure.

==== Effect of Protectorate of missions ====

The Ottoman System lost important domestic powers under the Capitulations of the Ottoman Empire. Many foreigners resident in the Empire were not subject to its laws, but rather those of their homelands. In addition, European powers became formal Protectors of certain groups in the empire: Russia of Eastern Orthodox groups, France of Roman Catholics, and Great Britain of Jews and other groups.

Russia and Britain competed for the Armenians; the Eastern Orthodox perceived American Protestants, who had over 100 missionaries established in Anatolia by World War I, as weakening their own teaching.

These religious activities, subsidized by the governments of western nations, were not devoid of political goals, such in the case of candlestick wars of 1847, which eventually led in 1854 to the Crimean War. Tension began among the Catholic and Orthodox monks in Palestine with France channeling resources to increase its influence in the region from 1840. Repairs to shrines were important for the sects as they were linked to the possession of keys to the shrines. Notes were given by the protectorates, including the French, to the Ottoman capital about the governor; he was condemned as he had to defend the Church of the Holy Sepulchre by placing soldiers inside the temple because of the &quot;candlestick wars&quot;, eliminating the change of keys. Successive Ottoman governments had issued edicts granting primacy of access to different Christian groups which vied for control of Jerusalem&#x27;s holy sites.

==== Effect of nationalism ====

Under the original design, the multi-faced structure of the &quot;millet&quot; system was unified under the House of Osman. The rise of nationalism in Europe under the influence of the French Revolution had extended to the Ottoman Empire during the 19th century. Each millet became increasingly independent with the establishment of its own schools, churches, hospitals and other facilities. These activities effectively moved the Christian population outside the framework of the Ottoman political system.

The Ottoman &quot;millet&quot; system (citizenship) began to degrade with increasing identification of religious creed with ethnic nationality. The interaction of ideas of French revolution with the &quot;millet&quot; system created a strain of thought (a new form of personal identification) which made nationality synonymous with religion under the Ottoman flag. It was impossible to hold the system or prevent Clash of Civilizations when the Armenian national liberation movement expressed itself within the Armenian church. Patriarch Nerses Varjabedyan expressed his position on Ottoman Armenians to the British Foreign Secretary, Lord Salisbury on 13 April 1878.

=== Post-Ottoman use ===
Today a version of religion-based legal pluralism resembling the millet system still persists in varying forms in some post-Ottoman countries like Iraq, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Israel, the Palestinian Authority, Egypt, and Greece (for religious minorities), which observe the principle of separate personal courts and/or laws for every recognized religious community and reserved seats in the parliament. Some legal systems which developed outside the Ottoman Empire, such as those in India, Iran, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, display similar characteristics.

In Egypt for instance, the application of family law – including marriage, divorce, alimony, child custody, inheritance, and burial – is based on an individual&#x27;s religious beliefs. In the practice of family law, the State recognizes only the three &quot;heavenly religions&quot;: Islam, Christianity, and Judaism. Muslim families are subject to the Personal Status Law, which draws on Sharia. Christian families are subject to canon law, and Jewish families are subject to Jewish law. In cases of family law disputes involving a marriage between a Christian woman and a Muslim man, the courts apply the Personal Status Law.

Israel, too, keeps a system based on the Ottoman &quot;millet&quot;, in which personal status is based on a person&#x27;s belonging to a religious community. The state of Israel – on the basis of laws inherited from Ottoman times and retained both under British rule and by independent Israel – reserves the right to recognise some communities but not others. Thus, Orthodox Judaism is officially recognised in Israel, while Reform Rabbis and Conservative Rabbis are not recognised and cannot perform marriages. Israel recognised the Druze and Baháʼí as separate communities, which the Ottomans and British had not – due mainly to political considerations. Also, the state of Israel reserves the right to determine to which community a person belongs, and officially register him or her accordingly – even when the person concerned objects to being part of a religious community (e.g., staunch atheists of Jewish origin are registered as members of the Jewish religious community, a practice derived ultimately from the fact that the &quot;millet&quot; ultimately designated a person&#x27;s ethnicity more than a person&#x27;s beliefs).

Israeli secularists such as Shulamit Aloni and Uri Avnery often protested and called for abolition of this Ottoman remnant, and its replacement by a system modeled on that of the United States where religious affiliation is considered a person&#x27;s private business in which the state should not interfere. However, all such proposals have been defeated.

Greece recognizes only a Muslim minority, and no ethnic or national minorities, such as Turks, Pomaks, or Bulgarians. This is the result of several international treaties as the Convention Concerning the Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations of 1923 and of the Treaty of Lausanne of 1924, when the old &quot;millet&quot; categories were used for the exchange between Greece and Turkey of the Greek Orthodox population in Turkey and Moslems in Greece. The categories were also used to establish the protection of the two remaining recognized minorities, the &quot;Muslims of Western Thrace&quot; (Turks, Pomaks, and Roms) and the &quot;Greek Orthodox of Istanbul&quot;. In 1924, upon the League of Nations&#x27; demand, a bilateral Bulgarian-Greek agreement was signed, known as the Politis–Kalfov Protocol, recognizing the &quot;Greek Slavophones&quot; as Bulgarians and guaranteeing their protection. On 2 February 1925, the Greek parliament, claiming pressure from the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, which threatened to renounce the Greek–Serbian Alliance of 1913, refused to ratify the agreement; the refusal lasted until 10 June 1925. Under the 1927 Mollov-Kafantaris Agreement, the bulk of the Slavic-speaking population in Greece left for Bulgaria.

==== Current meaning of the word ====
Today, the word &quot;&quot;millet&quot;&quot; means &quot;nation&quot; or &quot;people&quot; in Turkish, e.g. &quot;Türk milleti&quot; (&quot;Turkish nation&quot;), &quot;İngiliz milleti&quot; (&quot;English nation&quot;), etc. It also retains its use as a religious and ethnic classification; it can also be used as a slang to classify people belonging to a particular group (not necessarily religious or ethnic), such as &quot;dolmuşçu milleti&quot; (&quot;minivan taxi drivers people&quot;) or &quot;kadın milleti&quot; (&quot;women folk&quot;).

<text>Nicotiana sylvestris is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family Solanaceae, known by the common names woodland tobacco, flowering tobacco, and South American tobacco. It is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant in the tobacco genus &quot;Nicotiana&quot;, native to the Andes region in Argentina and Bolivia, in South America.

==Description==
It is a tall plant, growing to high by broad. The leaves are simple, somewhat sticky, with the blade partially surrounding the stem, clasping petiole.

Flowers are produced on many-branched stems. The flowers are tubular, white, borne in racemes held above the foliage. Flowers can be over 7 cm long with a face 2 cm wide. Their intense scent is strongest at night, to attract pollinating moths. Each flower eventually produces a large quantity of small seeds. 

This plant is thought to be one of the parents of &quot;Nicotiana tabacum&quot;, the plant used in modern tobacco production. However, all parts of &quot;N. sylvestris&quot; can cause discomfort or irritation if consumed.

==Cultivation==
&quot;Nicotiana sylvestris&quot; is cultivated as an ornamental plant. It is often planted in gardens for its architectural qualities and highly fragrant flowers. Though a short-lived perennial, in colder zones it is normally grown as a half-hardy annual, sown under glass with heat in early spring, and planted out after the last frosts. In Great Britain, it will only successfully overwinter in more sheltered coastal areas or parts of London where the temperature never falls below .

This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

<doc id="1173132" wikidata="Q371291" url="?curid=1173132" title="Britannia Prima">
<text>Britannia Prima or Britannia I (Latin for &quot;First Britain&quot;) was one of the provinces of the Diocese of &quot;the Britains&quot; created during the Diocletian Reforms at the end of the 3rd century. It was probably created after the defeat of the usurper Allectus by Constantius Chlorus in AD 296 and was mentioned in the Verona List of the Roman provinces. Its position and capital remain uncertain, although it was probably located closer to Rome than Britannia II. At present, most scholars place Britannia I in Wales, Cornwall, and the lands connecting them. On the basis of a recovered inscription, its capital is now usually placed at Corinium of the Dobunni (Cirencester) but some emendations of the list of bishops attending the 315 Council of Arles would place a provincial capital in Isca (Caerleon) or Deva (Chester), which were known legionary bases.

==History==
Following the Roman conquest of Britain, it was administered as a single province from Camulodunum (Colchester) and then Londinium (London) until the Severan Reforms following the revolt of its governor Clodius Albinus. These divided the territory into Upper and Lower Britain (&quot;Britannia Superior&quot; and &quot;Inferior&quot;), whose respective capitals were at Londinium and Eboracum (York). During the first phases of the Diocletian Reforms, Britain was under the control of Allectus&#x27; Britannic Empire as part of the Carausian Revolt. At some point after the territory was retaken by Constantius Chlorus in AD 296, the Diocese of the Britains (with its vicar at Londinium) was established and made a part of the Prefecture of Gaul. The Britains were then divided among three, four, or five provinces, which seem to have borne the names Prima, Secunda, Maxima Caesariensis, and (possibly) Flavia Caesariensis and Valentia.

The placement and capitals of these late British provinces are uncertain, although the late-4th century List of Offices describes the governor of Prima as being equestrian rank (&quot;&quot;), making the province unlikely to have been based in Londinium.

Describing the metropolitan sees of the early British church established by SS Fagan and &quot;Duvian&quot;, Gerald of Wales placed Britannia Prima in Wales and western Britain, explaining its name by reference to the legendary Brutus&#x27;s first settlements. Modern scholars disregard this gloss but generally agree in placing Britannia Prima in Wales, Cornwall (&quot;Cornubia&quot;), and the area connecting them. William Camden placed Prima to the south closest to Rome and this was generally accepted after the appearance of Charles Bertram&#x27;s highly-influential 1740s forgery &quot;The Description of Britain&quot;, which gave Prima borders south of the Thames and the Bristol Channel; his work was, however, debunked over the course of the mid-19th century.
Owing to an inscription discovered at Corinium of the Dobunni (Cirencester) which refers to a rector of Britannia Prima named Lucius Septimius, Corinium is generally accounted as the provincial capital. The list of bishops who attended the 314 Council of Arles is patently corrupt but generally assumed to have mimicked the Roman administration: Camden proposed that Prima was based at London and Secunda at Caerleon and these were the two bishops apart from York. Bishop Stillingfleet and Thackery further proposed that scribal error had produced the bishop &quot;de colonia Londinensium&quot; (&quot;from London colony&quot;) from original notes understood as &quot;Civ. Col. Londin.&quot; when &quot;Civ. Col. Leg. II&quot; (Caerleon) was intended. (Others place the bishop variously in Lincoln, Chester, and Colchester.)

==Legions==
The Second Augustan and Twentieth Valerian legions may have still been based at Isca Augusta (Caerleon) and Deva Victrix (Chester), although this is unclear.

==Valentia==

Ammianus records that in the year 369 Count Theodosius established or refounded the province of Valentia (further attested in the List of Offices) from lands recaptured from &quot;the enemy&quot;. Its location is a matter of scholarly debate, but some place it in northwestern Wales with its capital at Deva (Chester). If so, it was probably intended to counter the extensive Irish piracy and raiding occurring in late antiquity.

<text>The Communist Party of Thailand (Abrv: CPT; , ) was a communist party in Thailand active from 1942 until the 1990s.

Initially known as the Communist Party of Siam, the party was founded officially on 1 December 1942, although communist activism in the country began as early as 1927. In the 1960s, the CPT grew in membership and support and by the early 1970s was the second largest communist movement in mainland Southeast Asia (after Vietnam). The party launched a guerrilla war against the Thai government in 1965. Even though the CPT suffered internal divisions, at its political peak the party effectively acted as a state within the state. Its rural support is estimated to have been at least four million people; its military arm consisted of 10–14,000 armed fighters. Its influence was concentrated in the northeastern, northern and southern Thailand. Following a series of internal party disputes, changes in international communist alliances, successful counter-insurgency policies of Thailand&#x27;s government including a widely accepted offer of amnesty for party cadres, and the Cold War coming to its conclusion, the party disappeared from the political scene in the early-1990s.

==1920s–1930s==
The origins of the communist movement in Thailand begin with the founding of the Siam Special Committee of the South Seas Communist Party between 1926 and 1927. An infusion of leftists fleeing China for Thailand in the late 1920s following the Nationalist-Communist split of 1927 also increased support for activities. Accounts vary, but sometime between late 1929 and early 1930 the Communist Party of Siam was inaugurated.

==1940s–1950s: Party creation==
During its initial phase of existence, the Communist Party of Siam remained a small party. It mainly comprised intellectuals in Bangkok. By early-1948, British intelligence sources deemed reports that the party had 3,000 members nationwide as &quot;exaggerated&quot;. The party enjoyed a brief period of legality from 1946 to 1948. The secret party headquarters were in a wooden building on Si Phraya Road, Bangkok.

A CPT delegation attended the second national congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) in Tuyen Quang in February 1951.

The CPT held its second party congress in 1952.

==1960s: The People&#x27;s War==

In 1960, the party attended the International Meeting of Communist and Workers Parties held in Moscow.

The CPT held its third party congress in September 1961. In the Sino-Soviet split, the CPT sided with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). In October 1964, its position was made clear in a congratulatory message on the occasion of the 15th anniversary of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Ideologically, the party aligned with Maoism. In 1961, it formulated a policy of armed struggle along the lines of the Chinese experience, which was made public in 1964. The party condemned the Communist Party of the Soviet Union as revisionist and socially imperialist. As of 1966, relations with the Communist Party of Vietnam began to deteriorate, as the CPT criticized the CPV for failing to take a clear pro-CCP stance.

The Voice of the People of Thailand (VOPT), a CPT radio station, was established in Yunnan, southern China in March 1962.

The party launched the Thai Patriotic Front (TPF) on 1 January 1965. The TPF had a six-point programme for peace and neutrality. The Front called for the formation of a patriotic and democratic government, and opposed the Thai government and US troop presence in Thailand. The TPF was poised to fill the role of the united front in the triangular setting of the people&#x27;s war strategy (party-army-front).

Low intensity armed struggle began in August 1965 when the party declared through VOPT that &quot;an era of armed struggle had begun&quot;. Concomitantly, the party began armed actions in the Na Kae District of Nakhon Phanom Province. At the time it was estimated that the party had around 1,200 armed fighters under its command.

Opposition to US military presence in Thailand was a key element of the CPT during the Vietnam War. The CPT alleged that Thailand was a neocolonial country under US control. Emphasis was thus given to the struggle for national independence. As of 1968, the theory of neocolonialism was rejected by large sections of the party, who were inspired by Maoist positions arguing that Thailand was a semi-colonial country.

As of 1968, the CPT guerrilla network consisted of less than 4,000 armed fighters, scattered across the northern mountains and other periphery regions. The CPT guerrilla had limited links to outside support.

In 1969, the Supreme Command of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army of Thailand was formed, marking a new phase in the build-up of guerrilla forces. The armed struggle had spread to various districts in the north in the Phetchabun Mountains and the Phi Pan Nam Range. The armed forces of the party had also established a presence along the border with Malaysia, in the areas were the armed forces of the Communist Party of Malaya was based.

In July 1969, nine CPT members were arrested, including a high-ranking Central Committee member. The arrests were presented by the government as a crucial victory over the party.

==1970s: Peak==
From 1970 on, the People&#x27;s Liberation Army of Thailand (PLAT) received significant logistical support from China and Vietnam. PLAT forces intensified their operations, including attacks on US Air Force bomber bases in the country.

When Thailand and the People&#x27;s Republic of China established diplomatic relations in 1975, an announcement on VOPT hailed this development.

In the aftermath of the 6 October 1976 Massacre at Thammasat University and in the climate of increasing repression after the military take-over of the country, the CPT was able to expand its membership base. Many of the new recruits were students, workers, intellectuals, farmers or cadres of the Socialist Party of Thailand. More than 1,000 students joined the party, including most elected campus representatives throughout the country. A large section of the newly recruited members received political and military training in PLAT camps in Laos. Instructors were Thai, Lao, and Vietnamese.

In many cases, students accustomed to urban life had difficulties adapting to the harsh realities of guerrilla struggle, and thus the party decided to place many of them in villages rather deep in the jungle. The new student recruits were divided into groups of five to ten, which were distributed along the approximately 250 &quot;liberated villages&quot; of the country.

By 1977, the party had an estimated 6,000 to 8,000 armed fighters, and about a million sympathizers. Half of the provinces of the country were declared &quot;communist infiltrated&quot; by official Thai sources at the time.

The entry of leftist intellectuals to the party strengthened its capability to pursue united front policies. Following the expansion of its membership, the CPT began to stretch out a hand to wider sections of Thai society for forming a broad democratic front. On 7 May 1977, the Socialist Party of Thailand (SPT) declared that it would cooperate in armed struggle with the CPT. On 2 July, the two parties declared the formation of a united front.

On 4 October, VOPT declared the formation of the Committee for Coordination of Patriotic and Democratic Forces on 28 September. The nine-member coordination committee consisted of
*Chairman: Udom Srisuwan (CPT Central Committee Member)
*Vice Chairman: Boonyen Wothong (SPT)
*Committee Member: Monkon Na Nakhon (CPT)
*Committee Member: Therdphum Chaidee
*Committee Member: Sithon Yotkantha (farmers movement)
*Committee Member: Samak Chalikun (Socialist United Front Party)
*Committee Member: Chamni Sakdiset
*Spokesman and Committee Member: Sri Inthapathi (formerly working for the Public Relations Department of the government)
*Secretary: Thirayut Boonmi (students movement and editor of &quot;Samakhi Surop&quot; (&quot;United to Fight&quot;), a magazine being circulated among students and intellectuals both in Thailand and abroad).

Aligned with the CPT at the time were also the Thai Moslem People&#x27;s Liberation Armed Forces and the National Student Center of Thailand.

==Shifting alliances==
The military and political growth of the party would however be hampered by developments wider afield. The party depended on support from states and communist parties in neighbouring countries, and as international alliances shifted the CPT found itself vulnerable.

In late 1978, the Sino-Soviet split developed into armed hostilities in Southeast Asia as war broke out between Vietnam and Kampuchea, two countries that supported the CPT. Laos, a country which hosted many PLAT bases, sided with Vietnam in the dispute. In January 1979, the CPT and PLAT were expelled from Laos by the government, a military setback for the party. Bunyen Worthong and a small section of other ex-student leaders and intellectuals broke with the party leadership and on 22 October 1979, they formed the Thai Isan Liberation Party (generally called &quot;Pak Mai&quot;, the &#x27;New Party&#x27;) in Vientiane. &quot;Pak Mai&quot; was a communist party that supported Vietnamese-Laotian positions and was based in Laos.

Initially, the CPT adopted a neutral stance in the conflict between Vietnam and Kampuchea, causing relations to deteriorate with both the Chinese and the Vietnamese parties. However, as Vietnam intervened militarily in Kampuchea, the CPT condemned the Vietnamese action in a statement issued on 7 June 1979.

As diplomatic and trade relations between Thailand and China improved, and Thai and Chinese governments found a common enemy in pro-Soviet Vietnam, moral and logistical support for the CPT by the Chinese declined sharply. The Chinese Communist Party began advising the CPT to tone down their revolutionary discourse against the Thai government in their radio broadcasts and to support Democratic Kampuchean forces against the Vietnamese. On 10 July 1979, VOPT declared that it would cease to its broadcasting service. On 11 July, the last VOPT broadcast was transmitted. &quot;Renmin Ribao&quot; carried a congratulatory message from the CPT on the 30th anniversary of the People&#x27;s Republic of China on 30 September, which called for militant unity between Thai and Chinese communists, but thereafter news about the CPT in Chinese media became scarce.

==1980s: Decline==
In 1980, the Thai government adopted a government order, &quot;66/2523&quot;, encouraging CPT cadres to defect. Communist cadres were eventually granted amnesty.

In March 1981, the Socialist Party of Thailand broke off relations with the CPT, claiming that CPT was controlled by foreign influences.

In April 1981, the CPT leadership sought talks with the Thai government. The government responded that CPT fighters had to demobilize before any talks could be initiated. In a declaration on 25 October 1981, Major General Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, the director of the Thai Army Operations Department, said that the war against CPT armed forces was approaching its end as all major bases of the PLAT in the north and northeast had been destroyed.

In 1982, the government, under Prime Minister General Prem Tinsulanonda, issued another executive order, 65/2525, offering amnesty to CPT-PLAT fighters.

In 1982–1983, CPT experienced mass defections of its cadres, and its military potential was severely reduced. Many of those who defected in the early 1980s were the students and intellectuals who had joined CPT after the 1976 massacre. The defectors generally rejected the Maoist ideological positions of the CPT, arguing that Thailand was emerging as an industrial nation and the peasant war strategy had to be abandoned.

Damri Ruangsutham, an influential politburo member, and Surachai Sae Dan, a leading figure of the party in southern Thailand, were captured by state forces at that time.

There have been no reports of CPT activity since the beginning of the 1990s. The exact fate of the party is not known, and it remains banned to this day.

==Party organization==
As of the 1970s, the party was led by a seven-member politburo, elected by a 25-member Central Committee. Under the Central Committee were various provincial (&quot;changwat&quot;) committees and under them district (&quot;amphoe&quot;) committees. At the local level there were &quot;tambon&quot; (subdistrict) and &quot;muban&quot; (village) party structures.

Information on the leadership of the CPT is scarce. The CPT itself was always secretive about the identity of its leaders. According to a 1977 Kampuchean document, it was claimed that the General Secretary of the CPT was &quot;Khamtan&quot; (&quot;nom de guerre&quot; of Phayom Chulanont). Other sources mention &quot;Comrade Samanan&quot; (Jaroen Wanngam) as the party leader during the same period.

==Ethnic composition==
Prior to the formation of the Communist Party of Siam, the Chinese Communist Party had an active exile branch working among ethnic Chinese in the country. The party obtained legal status in 1946, and had a major influence on trade unions and Chinese students. The party had around 2,000 active members and another 3,000 sympathizers in Siam. After the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949 most ethnic Chinese communists in Thailand joined the CPT. From 1949 until 1976, the party membership was largely ethnically Chinese. Following the rapid expansion of the party following the 1976 massacre, ethnic Thais came to constitute the majority of party members. There was also a strong presence of other ethnic minorities in the party ranks. While many Hmongs in neighbouring Laos tended to side with anti-communist forces, the CPT was able to build a strong base among Hmong people in Thailand.

<text>Britannia Secunda or Britannia II (Latin for &quot;Second Britain&quot;) was one of the provinces of the Diocese of &quot;the Britains&quot; created during the Diocletian Reforms at the end of the 3rd century. It was probably created after the defeat of the usurper Allectus by Constantius Chlorus in AD 296 and was mentioned in the Verona List of the Roman provinces. Its position and capital remain uncertain, although it probably lay further from Rome than Britannia I. At present, most scholars place Britannia II in Yorkshire and northern England. If so, its capital would have been Eboracum (York). 


==History==
Following the Roman conquest of Britain, it was administered as a single province from Camulodunum (Colchester) and then Londinium (London) until the Severan Reforms following the revolt of its governor Clodius Albinus. These divided the territory into Britannia Superior and Britannia Inferior, whose respective capitals were at Londinium and Eboracum. During the first phases of the Diocletian Reforms, Britain was under the control of the Allectus&#x27;s Britannic Empire as part of the Carausian Revolt. At some point after the territory was retaken by Constantius Chlorus in AD 296, the Diocese of the Britains (with its vicar at Londinium) was formed and made a part of Prefecture of Gaul. The Britains were divided among three, four, or five provinces, which seem to have borne the names Prima, Secunda, Maxima Caesariensis, and (possibly) Flavia Caesariensis and Valentia.

The placement and capitals of these late British provinces are uncertain, although the &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot; lists the governor (&quot;&quot;) of Britannia II as being equestrian rank, making it unlikely to have been based in Londinium. The list of bishops who attended the 314 Council of Arles is patently corrupt but generally assumed to have mimicked the Roman administration: it seems certain one of the bishops was from Eboracum, even if his name (&quot;Eborius&quot;) was a scribal error.

==Camden==
William Camden argued for a placement of Secunda in Wales and Charles Bertram&#x27;s highly-influential forgery &quot;On the State of Britain&quot; placed Secunda gave it borders on the Dee and Severn; this was generally accepted from the mid-18th to the mid-19th century before being revealed as a fraud. It has been generally discounted since the discovery of inscriptions showing western England was part of Prima, with a possible capital at Corinium.

==Valentia==

Ammianus records that in the year 369 Count Theodosius established or refounded the province of Valentia (further attested in the List of Offices) from lands recaptured from &quot;the enemy&quot;. Its location is a matter of scholarly debate, but some place it at Hadrian&#x27;s Wall in the area around Luguvalium (Carlisle). If so, it would have been formed at some point in the 4th century out of territory formerly administered from Eboracum. Others place it between Hadrian&#x27;s Wall and the Antonine Wall or in Wales in the area around Deva (Chester); in both cases, some of the territory also may have been formerly administered from Eboracum prior to the reörganization.

<text>Samuel Charles Silkin, Baron Silkin of Dulwich, PC, QC (6 March 1918 – 17 August 1988) was a British Labour Party politician and cricketer. He was the MP for Dulwich from 1964 to 1983, and served as Attorney General for England and Wales from 1974 to 1979. 

==Early life==
Silkin was born in Neath in 1918, the second son of Lewis Silkin (afterwards Baron Silkin), a Labour Member of Parliament (MP) and a minister in Clement Attlee&#x27;s Cabinet from 1945 to 1950. His younger brother, John, was also an MP and Cabinet minister. He was educated at Dulwich College and Trinity Hall, Cambridge. He played two games of first-class cricket in 1938, one each for Cambridge University Cricket Club and Glamorgan County Cricket Club.

==Career==
He became a lawyer and was called to the bar in 1941. He received a commission in the British Army in December 1941. 

On 18 March 1946, Silkin, with the military rank of lieutenant colonel, presided over the Double Tenth war crimes trials at the Supreme Court Building in Singapore. Twenty-one Japanese &quot;Kenpeitai&quot; were accused of torturing 57 internees, resulting in the deaths of 15. On 15 April 1946, after a hearing lasting 21 days, eight were sentenced to death by hanging. Three others received life imprisonment, one a sentence of fifteen years, and two were given prison terms of eight years. Seven were acquitted.

In 1963, Silkin was raised to the rank of Queen&#x27;s Counsel. He chaired the Society of Labour Lawyers. He served as a councillor on Camberwell Borough Council from 1953 until 1959.

==Parliamentary career==
At the 1964 general election, Silkin was elected Member of Parliament for the Dulwich constituency, adjoining his father&#x27;s former constituency of Peckham. He was subsequently re-elected in Dulwich and continued to serve until his retirement at the 1983 general election.

From 1974 to 1979, he served as Attorney General for England and Wales and Northern Ireland under Labour Prime Ministers Harold Wilson and James Callaghan. After his retirement from politics, he was created a life peer as Baron Silkin of Dulwich, of North Leigh in the County of Oxfordshire on 13 May 1985.

==Family==
In 1941, Silkin married Elaine Stamp, with whom he had two sons and two daughters. His first wife died in 1984, and the following year, he married Sheila Marian.

Silkin died at Churchill Hospital in Oxford on 17 August 1988, at the age of 70.

<text>Adams Aliyu Oshiomhole (born 4 April 1952) is a Nigerian politician who has served as the senator representing the Edo North senatorial district since 2023. He is a former national chairman of the All Progressive Congress. He previously served as the president of the Nigeria Labour Congress from 1999 to 2007 and as governor of Edo State from 2008 to 2016.

As APC national chairman, he was suspended from office by the Abuja Court of Appeal on 16 June 2020.

==Background==
Oshiomhole was born on 4 April 1952 at Iyamho, near Auchi in Edo State. He was born Muslim but was led into Christianity by his late wife Clara, who died of cancer aged 54. He became a Catholic and his Christian name is Eric. 

After his secondary education, he obtained a job with the Arewa Textiles Company, where he was elected union secretary. He became a full-time trade union organiser in 1975.

In May 2015, he married a young model, Lara Fortes.

==Education==
Oshiomhole decided that he needed to further his education and so in 1975 he proceeded to Ruskin College at Oxford, United Kingdom, to study industrial relations, majoring in labour economics. Furthermore, in 1989, he attended the National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies (NIPSS) in Plateau State, Nigeria, making him a Member of the National Institute (MNI).

==Career==

===Labour leader===
In 1982, Oshiomhole was appointed general secretary of the National Union of Textile, Garment and Tailoring Workers of Nigeria, a union with over 75,000 workers. After democracy was restored in 1999, he became president of the Nigerian Labour Congress and was prominent as the leader of a campaign of industrial action against high oil prices in Nigeria.

Early in the administration of President Olusegun Obasanjo, he negotiated a 25% wage increase for public sector workers. In return he publicly supported Obasanjo and endorsed his candidacy when he was re-elected in 2003.

The textile workers union elected Oshiomhole for a second term as general secretary while he continued as president of the NLC (Nigeria Labour Congress).

His relationship with Obasanjo turned sour as neglect of local oil refineries led to the reliance on imported gasoline, followed by rises in the price of fuel. Oshiomhole led strikes and demonstrations against the increase. He faced arrests, tear gas and temporary blockades of union offices, and Obasanjo introduced legislation to make it more difficult for the NLC to strike. The NLC alleged that on 9 October 2004, Oshiomhole was abducted by State Security Services during a protest, but the Nigerian government said he submitted to voluntary custody.

He represented African workers for two terms on the governing body of the International Labour Organization (ILO), serving on the committee on freedom of association. He was also a member of the executive board of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.

===Politics===
In April 2007, Oshiomhole ran for governor of Edo State under the Action Congress Party, with which his Labour Party had entered a strategic alliance.

Oserheimen Osunbor of the People&#x27;s Democratic Party (PDP) was declared the winner. However, the AC contested the election on the basis of various irregularities. On 20 March 2008, the Edo State election tribunal nullified the election of Osunbor and declared Oshiomhole the winner. On 11 November 2008, a federal appeal court sitting in Benin City upheld the ruling of the state&#x27;s elections petitions tribunal, declaring Oshiomole to be the governor of Edo State. The decision was based on several voting irregularities.

During the 2012 Edo State gubernatorial election, he was elected to a second term, winning the elections in a massive landslide. His tenure ended on 12 November 2016.

On 23 June 2018, Oshiomhole emerged as the national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) following a voice vote by delegates at the party&#x27;s national convention.

On 12 November 2019, Oshiomhole was suspended from the APC after 18 local government chairmen of the party in his native state of Edo passed a vote of no confidence on him. He was accused of trying to disintegrate the party in Edo State. But a faction of the party loyal to Oshiomhole declared his suspension null and void and then suspended Governor Godwin Obaseki of the state whom they say orchestrated Oshiomhole&#x27;s suspension.

On 15 January 2020, Edo APC reaffirmed the suspension of Oshiomhole and said he had no legal right to continue to function as the APC national chairman by the virtue of his suspension in Edo State. On 4 March 2020, a high court sitting in Abuja ordered the suspension of Oshiomhole from the office of the national chairman of the APC, that having been suspended from the party, Oshiomhole was no longer a member of the party and could not possibly continue to discharge his official responsibilities as national chairman with a clear order of the court that Oshiomhole be restricted from the national secretariat of the party. 

Armed security agents, including the Police, Department of State Service (DSS) and Civil Defence were heavily deployed to the secretariat to prevent Oshiomhole from entering. On 5 March 2020, a federal high court in Kano gave another judgement which vacated the judgement of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) High Court and restored Oshiomhole as the national chairman of the APC. This created confusion as to which judgement to obey because both courts (FCT High Court and Federal High Court Kano) are of equal jurisdiction and none of them could vacate the judgement of the other.

Oshiomole appealed against his suspension at the Abuja Court of Appeal and the court affirmed his suspension on 16 June 2020. 

On 28 May 2022, Oshiomhole won the APC primaries for the 2023 Edo North senatorial elections. On 26 February 2023, INEC declared Oshiomhole the winner of 2023 senatorial election for Edo North senatorial district. With 107,110 votes, Oshiomhole was declared the winner of the polls, defeating the incumbent Senator Francis Alimekhena of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), who scored 55,344 votes. 

He was named Chairman, Senate Committee on Interior of the 10th Senate, on 8 August 2023.

==Awards and honours==
On 15 November 2011, Oshiomhole was conferred a Commander of the Order of the Niger by President Goodluck Jonathan. However, almost a year and a half later, the award was disputed by the Peoples Democratic Party&#x27;s chairman, Chief Dan Orbih, who accused Oshiomhole of age falsification. He was also conferred the &quot;Icon of Democracy&quot; award by the Nigeria Union of Journalists on 21 November 2011.

<text>Nicotiana longiflora, the longflower tobacco or long-flowered tobacco, is a species of tobacco native to South America that is sometimes cultivated for its tubular flowers that emit a very sweet odour at night.

This plant has been a significant source of disease resistance in flue-cured and burley tobacco. Some of the disease impacted by resistance from this species are: black shank, cyst nematode, root-knot nematode, and wildfire. The resistance form &quot;N. longiflora&quot; imparts near immunity to race 0 black shank, but no resistance to race 1. One of the varieties still in use today is 14 x L8, the second most popular burley tobacco variety in the U.S.

<doc id="1173179" wikidata="Q3267532" url="?curid=1173179" title="USS Guitarro (SS-363)">
<text>USS &quot;Guitarro&quot; (SS-363), a , was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the guitarro.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Guitarro&quot; initially was ordered as a unit of the &quot;Balao&quot; class, but her builder, the Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company, did not receive the drawings for the &quot;Balao&quot; class from the Electric Boat Company in time to build &quot;Guitarro&quot; or the submarines , , and to the new design, so they were built as &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarines. Thus, in some references, these four submarines are listed as units of the &quot;Balao&quot;-class.

&quot;Guitarro&quot; was launched 26 September 1943 by the Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company at Manitowoc, Wisconsin, sponsored by Mrs. Pauline Palmer McIntire, wife of Vice Admiral Ross T. McIntire, chief of the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, and commissioned at Manitowoc on 26 January 1944.

==World War II service==
&quot;Guitarro&quot; departed Manitowoc for Chicago 13 February, and there she was placed in a floating drydock. Steamer &quot;Minnesota&quot; towed the drydock to New Orleans, arriving 22 February, and there &quot;Guitarro&quot; prepared for sea. Steaming from New Orleans 1 March, she operated out of Balboa, Canal Zone, for several weeks and departed for Pearl Harbor 2 April 1944.

=== First war patrol, May – June 1944 ===

Arriving at Pearl Harbor 17 April, &quot;Guitarro&quot; prepared for her first war patrol off Formosa. She got underway on this duty 7 May 1944. On the night of 30 May the submarine encountered heavily escorted cargo vessel &quot;Shisen Maru&quot;, and scoring two hits sent her to the bottom. She evaded counter-attacks by the screen ships and headed south for rendezvous with a wolf pack of four submarines under the command of Comdr. F. W. Fenno.

On the night of 2 June &quot;Guitarro&quot; made a moonlight periscope approach and launched two torpedoes at the frigate &quot;Awaji&quot;, sinking her immediately. The submarine was then forced down to avoid depth charge, torpedo, and aircraft attacks. She made port at Darwin, Australia, 19 June, and 2 days later sailed for Fremantle, arriving 27 June 1944.

=== Second war patrol, July – September 1944 ===

Departing on her second war patrol 21 July 1944, &quot;Guitarro&quot; set course for the South China Sea off the west coast of Luzon. She commenced her approach to the lead escorts of a large convoy 7 August and after missing the first target scored three hits on frigate &quot;Kusakaki&quot;, blowing off her bow and sinking her in a spectacular explosion. The remainder of the convoy escaped as &quot;Guitarro&quot; eluded the determined attacks of an escort destroyer. She surfaced the next day to sink a small coastal vessel with her deck gun, and then steamed toward Cape Bolinao, where she was to rendezvous with the next day.

&quot;Guitarro&quot; detected a convoy along the coastline 10 August, maneuvered from beachside, and launched four torpedoes. Tanker &quot;Shinei Maru&quot; exploded and burned furiously as &quot;Guitarro&quot; dived to avoid depth charges. The submarine suffered considerable outside damage but no serious injury, and she departed for the vicinity of Cape Calavite with &quot;Raton&quot;.

While submerged the morning of 21 August &quot;Guitarro&quot; heard a distant depth charge attack, and soon sighted the smoke of a convoy. Hampered by an unfavorable current and a radically maneuvering convoy, she was unable to mount an attack on two tankers; but a cargo ship turned into her and received four torpedoes as a reward. Passenger-cargo ship &quot;Uga Maru&quot; (4,433 tons) was sunk, and &quot;Guitarro&quot; escaped amid a violent depth charge attack.

The versatile submarine, finding the water too shallow for a torpedo attack, surfaced 27 August to engage three coastal tankers with her deck gun and succeeded in sinking &quot;Nanshin Maru&quot;. Two other tankers were damaged but managed to escape into shoal water. &quot;Guitarro&quot; returned to Fremantle to complete her patrol 8 September 1944.

=== Third war patrol, October – November 1944 ===

In company with , &quot;Guitarro&quot; departed Fremantle 8 October 1944 for her third war patrol in Philippine waters. As the epochal Battle of Leyte Gulf developed, &quot;Guitarro&quot; played an important role. She sighted the Japanese Central Force under Admiral Takeo Kurita on the night of 23 – 24 October and tracked the ships through Mindoro Strait, unable to close for an attack. Her contact reports on the force were vital to the success of the ensuing engagements, which by 26 October virtually eliminated the remaining Japanese naval forces in the Pacific.

&quot;Guitarro&quot;, &quot;Bream&quot;, and &quot;Raton&quot; rendezvoused 30 October and the three boats attacked a convoy off Cape Bolinao that night. Unable to score any hits until the next day, &quot;Guitarro&quot; managed to work her way inside the screen and fire no less than nine torpedoes at 08:47. She observed one cargo ship break in half and was rocked by a tremendous explosion from another direct hit on an ammunition ship. &quot;Guitarro&quot; was driven down by the force of the explosion, prompting Comdr. Haskins to report: &quot;The Commanding Officer never wishes to hit an ammunition ship any closer than that one.&quot; She teamed up with &quot;Bream&quot; and 4 November to sink passenger-cargo ship &quot;Kagu Maru&quot;. After &quot;Bream&quot;&#x27;s initial attack, &quot;Guitarro&quot; added four hits before diving to avoid escort vessels.

Remaining off western Luzon, &quot;Guitarro&quot; and her wolf pack next encountered heavy cruiser &quot;Kumano&quot; in convoy. Damaged in the Battle off Samar, the cruiser had repaired at Manila and was en route to Japan when the submarines struck. &quot;Guitarro&quot; fired nine torpedoes and gained three hits, but failed to sink the cruiser. Pounded by torpedoes from the other boats, &quot;Kumano&quot; was finally stopped, towed ashore by one of her sisters, and eventually finished off by carrier aircraft 25 November 1944. &quot;Guitarro&quot;, meanwhile, had returned to Fremantle 16 November. For her outstanding performance on her first three patrols, the submarine was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation.

=== Fourth and fifth war patrols, December 1944 – May 1945 ===

&quot;Guitarro&quot; departed Fremantle 11 December 1944 on her fourth war patrol, transiting Lombok Strait 17 December to patrol the South China Sea. After putting in at Mios Woendi 17 January 1945 for repairs, she made an attack with undetermined results on a convoy off Cape Batagan. On 1 March 1945, she was operating on the surface in heavy fog when at 01:10 H Time she sighted a torpedo at a distance of which passed ahead of her. With strong indications of nearby U.S. SD and SJ submarine radars, she challenged what she presumed was a nearby U.S. submarine for 45 minutes via SJ radar signals beginning at 01:25 H Time before receiving a reply and exchanging recognition signals. The other submarine never identified itself, but the torpedo had come from its direction. Although unable to prove conclusively that they had been either in contact with or fired upon by another U.S. submarine, &quot;Guitarro&quot;′s crew concluded that they had nearly been the victims of a friendly fire incident. Finding targets scarce in her patrol area, &quot;Guitarro&quot; returned to Fremantle on 15 March 1945.

&quot;Guitarro&quot; again put out to sea 9 April 1945 on her fifth war patrol, and was unsuccessfully attacked by aircraft and a patrol boat in Lombok Strait. She then made her way to the northeast coast of Sumatra, where she engaged in a new mission, the laying of mines, off Berhala Island. After an uneventful patrol astride the shipping lanes between Borneo and Singapore, &quot;Guitarro&quot; anchored off Saipan 27 May 1945. Next day she departed for Pearl Harbor, where she arrived 8 June. Arriving at San Francisco 18 June 1945, &quot;Guitarro&quot; decommissioned at Mare Island 6 December and was placed in reserve.

== 1952-1953 service and Fleet Snorkel conversion ==
&quot;Guitarro&quot; recommissioned 6 February 1952, and after overhaul at San Diego engaged in a series of training exercises off the coast until 10 September 1953. She again decommissioned 22 September 1953 and underwent a Fleet Snorkel conversion to snorkel equipment at Mare Island Shipyard. She was featured in the 1953 film &quot;The 49th man&quot;.

== Transfer to Turkey as TCG &quot;Preveze&quot; (S 340) ==

&quot;Guitarro&quot; subsequently recommissioned 15 May 1954 and commenced the training of Turkish sailors prior to transfer to Turkey under the Military Defense Assistance Program. &quot;Guitarro&quot; decommissioned and was loaned to Turkey 7 August 1954. She was commissioned as TCG &quot;Preveze&quot;, the first submarine on that name. Originally designated S 22, she was redesignated S 340 in 1965. On 1 January 1972 the submarine was formally sold to Turkey. She was decommissioned on 4 May 1972, renamed &quot;Ceryan Botu (No. 4)&quot;, and served as a battery charging hulk until scrapped in September 1983. Her sail was preserved at Gölcük Naval Base until the earthquake of 17 August 1999.

==Awards==
&quot;Guitarro&quot; was awarded four battle stars and a Navy Unit Commendation for her service in World War II. Her first, second, third, and fifth war patrols were designated &quot;successful.&quot;

<doc id="1173185" wikidata="Q6187532" url="?curid=1173185" title="Jessica Utts">
<text>Jessica Utts (born 1952) is a parapsychologist and statistics professor at the University of California, Irvine. She is known for her textbooks on statistics and her investigation into remote viewing.

== Statistics education ==
In 2003, Utts published an article in &quot;American Statistician&quot;, a journal published by the American Statistical Association, calling for significant changes to collegiate level statistics education. In the article she argued that curricula do a fine job of covering the mathematical side of statistics, but do a poor job of teaching students the skills necessary to properly interpret statistical results in scientific studies. The argument continues that common errors found in news articles, such as the common misinterpretation that correlative studies show causation, would be reduced if there were significant changes made to standard statistics courses.

In 2016, Utts served as the 111th president of the American Statistical Association.
She is a Fellow of the American Statistical Association, and also a Fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics.

== Investigation of remote viewing ==

In 1995, the American Institutes for Research (AIR) appointed a panel consisting primarily of Utts and Ray Hyman to evaluate a project investigating remote viewing for espionage applications, the Stargate Project, which was funded by the Central Intelligence Agency and Defense Intelligence Agency, and carried out initially by Stanford Research Institute and subsequently by SAIC.

A report by Utts claimed the results were evidence of psychic functioning, however Hyman in his report argued Utts&#x27; conclusion that ESP had been proven to exist, especially precognition, was premature and the findings had not been independently replicated. According to Hyman &quot;the overwhelming amount of data generated by the viewers is vague, general, and way off target. The few apparent hits are just what we would expect if nothing other than reasonable guessing and subjective validation are operating.&quot; Funding for the project was stopped after these reports were issued. Jessica Utts also co-authored papers with the parapsychologist Edwin May, who took over Stargate in 1985. The psychologist David Marks noted that because Utts had published papers with May &quot;she was not independent of the research team. Her appointment to the review panel is puzzling; an evaluation is likely to be less than partial when an evaluator is not independent of the program under investigation.&quot;

The Stargate Project was terminated in 1995 with the conclusion that it was never useful in any intelligence operation. The information was vague and included a lot of irrelevant and erroneous data. There was also reason to suspect that the research managers had adjusted their project reports to fit the known background cues.

Utts is on the executive board of the International Remote Viewing Association (IRVA).

<text>The Socialist Party of Thailand (SPT) was a political party in Thailand, active in the 1970s. SPT was led by its general secretary Boonsanong Punyodyana.

SPT won 15 out of 269 seats in the 1975 parliamentary elections. That election, which was the first free polls after many years of dictatorship, also saw other left-wing parties like the New Force Party (12 seats) and Socialist Front (10 seats) represented in Parliament.

Boonsanong Punyodyana was murdered on 28 February 1976. Around 10,000 people attended his memorial service.

After the Thammasat University massacre and military coup on 6 October 1976, many SPT went into exile or joined the Communist Party of Thailand&#x27;s guerrillas in the border areas with Laos in northern Thailand and Isan (northeastern Thailand). 

Thus the party was dissolved at the order of the military junta’s National Administrative Reform Council leader Sangad Chaloryu on 6 October 1976.

<text>Red Bull Racing, currently competing as Oracle Red Bull Racing and also known simply as Red Bull or RBR, is a Formula One racing team, competing under an Austrian racing licence and based in the United Kingdom. It is one of two Formula One teams owned by conglomerate Red Bull GmbH, the other being RB Formula One Team. The Red Bull Racing team has been managed by Christian Horner since its formation in 2005.

Red Bull had Cosworth engines in and Ferrari engines in . The team used engines supplied by Renault between and (from to 2018, the Renault engine was re-badged TAG Heuer following the breakdown in the relationship between Red Bull and Renault in ). During this partnership, they won four successive Drivers&#x27; and Constructors&#x27; Championship titles from to , becoming the first Austrian team to win the title.

The team began using Honda engines in . The works Honda partnership culminated in following Red Bull driver Max Verstappen&#x27;s World Drivers&#x27; Championship victory, with Verstappen also winning the championship in , , and . Red Bull also won two Constructors&#x27; Championship titles in 2022 and 2023, but lost out in 2021 to Mercedes and in 2024 to McLaren. Honda left the sport officially after 2021 but is set to continue to supply complete engines from Japan to the team partly under Red Bull Powertrains branding until the end of .

== History ==

=== Origins ===
The current Red Bull team traces its origins back to the Stewart Grand Prix outfit that made its debut in . Jackie Stewart sold his team to the Ford Motor Company late in 1999, and Ford made the decision to rebrand the team Jaguar Racing with little subsequent success over the next five years.

The Jaguar Racing Formula One constructor and racing team was put up for sale in September 2004 when Ford decided it could &quot;no longer make a compelling business case for any of its brands to compete in Formula One.&quot; Red Bull, an energy drinks company, agreed its purchase of Jaguar Racing on the final day of the sale, 15 November 2004. BBC Sport reported that Ford asked bidders for a symbolic US$1 in return for a commitment to invest US$400 million in the team over three Grand Prix seasons. The team continued to have access to the Cosworth engine developed for their 2005 chassis, and the operation continued under the new title. Christian Horner was installed as the new team boss and lined up David Coulthard and Christian Klien to drive for the team. The team operated under a British racing licence from to .

Red Bull Racing was not the start of Red Bull&#x27;s involvement in Formula One, as they sponsored Sauber from 1995 to 2004. After buying a Formula One team of its own, Red Bull ended its long-term partnership with the Swiss team. Red Bull also runs a young drivers programme, Red Bull Junior Team, whereby Red Bull sponsors promising young drivers. High-profile drivers who have received this backing include Enrique Bernoldi, Christian Klien, Patrick Friesacher, Vitantonio Liuzzi and Scott Speed. Red Bull also sponsors many drivers and teams competing in the Formula 2 Championship, Formula One&#x27;s &quot;feeder&quot; series.

=== Cosworth engines (2005) ===

==== 2005 season ====
Red Bull&#x27;s owner, Dietrich Mateschitz, reportedly tried to recruit former Formula One driver and BMW Motorsport chief (and fellow Austrian) Gerhard Berger to help guide the team through its debut season. However, this was never realised. For , the chassis was christened the RB1. Red Bull Racing used Cosworth engines in its maiden year due to the ease of continuing with the engine Jaguar Racing used.

Former McLaren driver David Coulthard led the team. Coulthard was chosen for his experience, considered ideal to help lead the fledgling team. For the second car, Red Bull shared the drive between two of its young sponsored drivers: Christian Klien, who had driven for Jaguar in and 2004 F3000 champion Vitantonio Liuzzi. At first, it was announced that Klien and Liuzzi would swap driving duty every four races, but by the end of the season, Liuzzi had appeared only four times.

Red Bull&#x27;s first year in Formula One was a massive success compared to its predecessors, Jaguar Racing. They were 6th in the Constructors&#x27; Championship for most of the season, only beaten by the fast-improving BAR Hondas at the end of the season. In a single season, they amassed more points than Jaguar had in and 2004. Coulthard, after a poor 2003 and 2004 with McLaren, was a revelation for the team while Klien showed that he had vastly improved from 2004. Overall they scored 34 points; 24 for Coulthard, 9 for Klien and 1 for Liuzzi. Red Bull Racing was a consistent point and occasional podium challenger for most of their debut season.

American driver Scott Speed, who rose through the ranks in the American equivalent of the Red Bull Junior Team, Red Bull Driver Search, was Red Bull Racing&#x27;s third driver in 2005 for the Canadian and United States Grands Prix. Speed was attractive to Red Bull Racing because of his American nationality which would raise the profile of both Red Bull and Formula One in America, a market where the sport has traditionally struggled to make an impact.

=== Ferrari engines (2006) ===

==== 2006 season ====

On 23 April 2005, the team announced a deal to utilise customer Ferrari engines in . This coincided with a rule change mandating the use of V8 engines, making it likely that both Red Bull Racing and Ferrari would use the same specification engine. Red Bull Racing continued to use Michelin tyres, rather than the Bridgestones used by Ferrari.

On 8 November 2005, Red Bull Racing hired Adrian Newey, the highly successful McLaren technical director.

On 15 December 2005, the team&#x27;s second car, the Red Bull RB2, hit the track for the first time. David Coulthard completed a handful of laps of the Silverstone circuit in England, and declared the new car was a &quot;sexy looking thing&quot;. In early testing Red Bull was plagued with cooling problems and overheating of car components.

At the opening race of the 2006 season in Bahrain, Christian Klien qualified eighth (ahead of Giancarlo Fisichella&#x27;s Renault and both BMWs). Coulthard had problems when he flat-spotted a tyre fighting with Nick Heidfeld, and finished 10th; the cooling problems returned when his Ferrari engine expired on the slowing down lap, forcing a grid penalty for the following race. In Malaysia, Coulthard made up several places from the back of the grid but was forced to retire with hydraulic problems, while Klien had an opening lap incident with Kimi Räikkönen and after pitting for repairs also retired with hydraulic failure. Coulthard got a point in Australia after Scott Speed was penalised for passing him under the yellow flags. The following races were marred with retirements and lowly finishes.

Coulthard finished 3rd at Monaco, the team&#x27;s first podium finish. Team boss Christian Horner said before the race that if one of his cars were to finish on the podium, he would jump into a swimming pool at the track naked. He ended up jumping into the pool wearing only a red cape. Coincidentally both Stewart Grand Prix and Jaguar Racing, the team&#x27;s predecessors, also scored their maiden podiums at that race.

Coulthard scored a point at Montreal, passing Jenson Button in the closing stages of the race despite starting in last place due to an engine change that warranted a grid penalty. Klien also fared well, driving the second RB2 to 11th position. At the Klien retired along with eight other cars including Toro Rosso driver Scott Speed on the first lap after a series of first corner incidents. Coulthard finished 7th.

The team finished 7th in the FIA Constructors&#x27; Championship, with 16 points, five points ahead of the struggling Williams team. Coulthard (14 pts) finished in 13th place in the drivers&#x27; standings, the departed Klien (2 pts) was classified in 18th position. Klien&#x27;s replacement, Robert Doornbos, failed to score any points.

=== Renault engines (2007–2018) ===
====Customer era (2007–2010)====
=====2007 season=====

 saw the debut of the Adrian Newey designed RB3. After lengthy discussions over Red Bull Racing&#x27;s obligation to continue to use Ferrari engines for 2007, the team announced on 31 August 2006 they would use customer Renault engines for the 2007 season, the Ferrari contract being passed to Scuderia Toro Rosso.

The team announced on 7 August 2006 that it had signed Mark Webber to drive alongside Coulthard for the 2007 season, replacing Christian Klien who ended his association with the team. Klien was replaced by Robert Doornbos for the last three races of 2006. Doornbos became the team&#x27;s non-racing third driver for 2007. In 2007 Red Bull officially became an Austrian constructor by receiving an Austrian licence, though continued to operate from the same base in Britain.

Despite qualifying in 7th place for his home race in Melbourne, Mark Webber finished down in 13th due to a persistent problem with a fuel flap that closed as the pit mechanics went to put the fuel in and when it was opened it remained open until the next pit stop greatly increasing drag and decreasing airflow over the rear wing. It was worse for Coulthard however, who crashed heavily with Williams&#x27;s Alexander Wurz in the late stages of the race. Malaysia was more of the same for Webber, while Coulthard retired with brake problems. However, in Bahrain the team showed improving pace, and Coulthard and Webber were running 7th (with Coulthard starting from the back) and 8th respectively before reliability problems put both out of the race in quick succession. However, in testing at Barcelona Coulthard has set the fastest lap in the new configuration of the circuit (since superseded by Felipe Massa). Coulthard secured the team&#x27;s first points by scoring a gritty 5th with a faulty gearbox on his closing laps in Spain, while Webber was dogged with hydraulic problems all weekend, eventually retiring from the race after failing to set a competitive lap in qualifying. The performance hike the team experienced at the Catalan track left both drivers and team optimistic about their future results, with reliability troubles being as much a focus as the increase of their already competitive pace.

Red Bull Racing further strengthened their technical department by hiring Geoff Willis as Technical Director on 17 July 2007.

After this, the drivers seemed to have a stroke of good luck during the unpredictable and exciting 2007 European Grand Prix in which Webber finished 3rd, his second career podium. Coulthard backed it up with a strong 5th which was made all the more impressive by the fact he started 20th on the grid after the team mistakenly kept him in the pits too long resulting in him not being able to complete another qualifying lap.

Red Bull had a strong end to the season. Webber came close to victory at the Japanese Grand Prix, but he was involved in a crash with Sebastian Vettel. During the same race, Coulthard again demonstrated his wet-weather ability and finished 4th.

At the Chinese Grand Prix, Red Bull had a competitive qualifying session. Coulthard achieved 5th on the grid, along with Webber in 9th.

=====2008 season=====
Red Bull continued with the same drivers in and had numbers 9 and 10 on their cars after finishing 5th in the 2007 Constructors&#x27; Championship. Red Bull presented the RB4 at the Jerez circuit on 16 January and announced that Sébastien Buemi would be their test and reserve driver for 2008 combining it with his GP2 drive with the Arden International GP2 team.

After Webber retired from the opening round he went on to score 5 consecutive points finishes. Coulthard had a tougher start to the 2008 campaign due to poor qualifying, but a 3rd place at Canada gave Red Bull their first podium since the 2007 European Grand Prix. At the half-way mark, the team had notched up 24 points – the same as their total for the 2007 season – and were locked in a fierce battle with Toyota and Renault for 4th in the Constructors&#x27; Championship. The team had also resolved the reliability problems that had dogged them the previous year.

However, as the season progressed, Red Bull failed to keep up with their competitors. Red Bull scored just 5 points in the last 10 races, and Toro Rosso – the Red Bull &#x27;B team&#x27; – had overhauled their total by the season&#x27;s end and won the rain-affected , becoming the first Red Bull-owned team to win a race. This fact led many to claim that the Renault engine powering the Red Bull was lacking in horsepower compared to the Ferrari and Mercedes engines. For the 2009 season, Renault was allowed to equalise the difference in engine power compared to their competitors after the single-year freeze in engine development from 2007.

Webber notched up his 50th top ten grid position in 107 Grands Prix at the . Coulthard announced his retirement from Formula One at the and, despite hopes for a strong final home Grand Prix, was forced to retire on the first lap, which also occurred at his final race in Brazil where he retired at the second corner.

=====2009 season=====

For , Red Bull Racing launched their new RB5 chassis virtually on 8 February utilising a 3D computer-generated video narrated by Sebastian Vettel. The physical launch of the car was held the next day. The team secured their first pole position at the with Sebastian Vettel, posting the fastest time with just a single qualifying lap in Q3. Mark Webber qualified in third on the grid. The next day, Vettel won, with Webber second. Vettel&#x27;s victory, in rain-soaked conditions, marked Red Bull Racing&#x27;s first-ever win (although the team&#x27;s predecessor, Stewart GP, had won the 1999 European Grand Prix courtesy of Johnny Herbert).
In the next race at Bahrain after qualifying 3rd, Vettel finished second behind Jenson Button and collected another eight world championship points. At the , Webber and Vettel finished third and fourth respectively, after having qualified fifth and second. In Turkey, Webber and Vettel finished second and third respectively. At the the car had new upgrades and Sebastian Vettel won after qualifying on pole position, ending championship leader Jenson Button&#x27;s run of four straight wins. The team scored another 1–2 at the with Mark Webber (who scored his first win despite being given a drive-through penalty earlier on) leading home Sebastian Vettel. Mark Webber also took his second Formula One victory at the . Another 1–2 finish for the team was achieved at the season-ending , this time with Vettel finishing ahead of Webber.

Vettel finished second in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 84 points, 11 behind Jenson Button. Mark Webber finished fourth with 69.5 points. The team also finished second in the Constructors&#x27; Championship with 153.5 points, 18.5 points behind Brawn GP.

=====2010 season=====

For the 2010 season, the team retained both Mark Webber and Sebastian Vettel, with Renault remaining the engine supplier.

At the opening round, the , Vettel took pole position while Webber qualified sixth. Vettel led the race until he slowed due to a spark-plug failure, while the two Ferraris and Lewis Hamilton overtook Vettel. Vettel finished fourth, and Webber finished eighth.

In Australia, Vettel again took pole, with Webber in the second position. Vettel led the race and again looked set to take the race, but he reported a vibration of one of the front wheels on his car. The problem seemed to subside, and the decision was made to keep him on the track rather than pit him. A few corners later, the problem struck again, and Vettel ran off the track and subsequently retired, due to brake failure. Webber got wheelspin off the line and gave up one position on the run to the first right-handed corner. Subsequent errors led to him dropping a few more places, and near the end of the race, he crashed with Hamilton, destroying his front wing. He pitted to get a new one, and finished ninth, scoring two points.

In Malaysia, Webber took pole with Vettel in the third position. Vettel managed to pass both Nico Rosberg and Webber before the first corner, leading for all bar two laps en route to his and the team&#x27;s first victory of the year. Webber led the other two laps and eventually finished second, with the team moving up into third in the Constructors&#x27; Championship.
The team once again scored pole position in China, when Vettel managed to set a faster time than Webber, who completed the front row. Webber overtook Vettel at the start, but both were overtaken by Fernando Alonso, who was later given a penalty for a false start. The race was then hit by rain and Jenson Button made the best strategy call and won the race, Vettel finished sixth whilst Webber was eighth. This left Vettel and Webber fifth and seventh in the Drivers&#x27; Championship respectively, and the team in third in the Constructors&#x27; Championship.

At the the two drivers were the other way around, with Webber on pole position and Vettel second on the grid. Webber won the race without too much trouble. Vettel, however, suffered brake problems and dropped to fourth – this became third when Hamilton had a puncture and crashed from second on the penultimate lap.

Webber took pole position again at the ; Vettel qualified third behind Renault&#x27;s Robert Kubica, but overtook him at the start. Webber won the race and Vettel finished in second place.
After the race, Webber was leading the championship after being in seventh after China, with Vettel in second place (this was only by countback though because both drivers were on 78 points). The team was leading the Constructors&#x27; Championship.

At the , Webber again took pole position, taking the team&#x27;s run of pole positions to seven consecutive races, with Vettel third on the grid. Following the pit stops, Webber and Vettel were running first and second until lap 40, when Vettel attempted to overtake Webber, leading to a collision between the two. Webber finished third, while Vettel was forced to retire. Neither driver took 100% of responsibility while senior members of the team alluded to the thought that Webber had not provided &quot;enough room&quot; for Vettel.

In Canada, Hamilton took pole position – the first non-Red Bull pole of the year. Webber and Vettel were second and third respectively in qualifying before the pair finished fourth and fifth in the race. The team admitted that it was a track that the car struggled with.

At the in Valencia, Spain, Vettel won from pole position, leading every lap of the race. Webber collided with the Lotus of Heikki Kovalainen, flipping his Red Bull car into a somersault before landing and crashing into a tyre barrier.

At the at Silverstone, Vettel took pole position but after a bad start, he got a puncture and subsequently dropped to the back of the field, eventually finishing seventh. Webber, who started from second, won after leading for the entire race.

Vettel qualified in pole position in front of the two Ferraris in Germany, but finished his home race behind the pair in third place. Webber qualified in fourth but finished in sixth behind both the McLaren cars. During the race Felipe Massa controversially let Fernando Alonso past into the lead to win the race after a message from the team. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said: &quot;That was the most blatant team order ever&quot;. He also criticised Ferrari for not letting their drivers race each other.

At the in Budapest, Vettel again took pole position and was leading until the safety car came out. He was second behind Webber, who started second and was then given a drive-through penalty for exceeding the ten-car maximum distance between himself and the safety car. This cost him second place and he finished third. Webber won the race after using his super-soft tyres for over half the race to build up a lead to keep him ahead after his stop. Webber won with Fernando Alonso ten seconds behind in second place.

The saw Webber claim pole position, despite McLaren and Ferrari having a straight-line speed advantage. At the start, the anti-stall device on Webber&#x27;s car came on, dropping the Australian to 5th. Vettel, meanwhile in 3rd (after starting 4th) was chasing Jenson Button for 2nd place when he collided with the Brit at the Bus Stop. After sensing an inside passing opportunity, Vettel attempted to quickly change direction while under braking, causing the car to spear into the side of Button&#x27;s McLaren. Button retired from the race, while Vettel was able to pit for repairs. He subsequently received a drive-through penalty for his action and suffered a rear tyre puncture while attempting to overtake Vitantonio Liuzzi, finishing 15th. Webber was able to capitalise on the DNF of Button and Alonso, as well as a mistake by Renault&#x27;s Robert Kubica, during his pit stop, and finish 2nd, behind race winner Hamilton.

At the in Monza, Webber had a bad start and was 9th from 4th place on the grid after the first lap. Vettel had brake binding problems for a short period, around lap 20, and he too dropped back a place but was then back on the pace. Webber was held back by Nico Hülkenberg in the latter part of the race, until he passed, and finished 6th. Vettel stayed out on soft tyres until the penultimate lap, doing better lap times than Webber and overtaking Mark when he pitted, to finish fourth.

At the in Yeongam, Vettel gave the team its 19th pole position, while Webber started second, making it a Red Bull front row. On lap 18, Webber spun and hit the wall, and hit the Mercedes of Nico Rosberg, causing both drivers to retire. Worse was to come for the team when Vettel&#x27;s engine failed just 10 laps from the finish, while he was in the lead, and the German retired and handed his lead to Fernando Alonso in the Ferrari. Red Bull had suffered their first double retirement since the 2008 Australian Grand Prix and as a result, Webber lost his championship lead and Vettel&#x27;s engine failure prevented him from leading the championship for the first time in 2010, but the team still led the Constructors&#x27; Championship.

At the in São Paulo, Red Bull Racing became Constructors&#x27; Champion for the first time after Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber finished 1–2 in the race, enough to finish ahead of McLaren and Ferrari. In doing so Red Bull became the first Austrian team to win the Formula One Constructors&#x27; Championship. Christian Horner stated that the main goal had been achieved and that now his remaining aim was to win the Drivers&#x27; Championship and put the icing on the cake of Red Bull&#x27;s year. In some other teams, the drivers would have been told to change positions, to improve better placed Mark Webber&#x27;s chances to win the drivers&#x27; title in the last race, but the team insisted that the faster driver should win the race, and kept being reluctant to give any orders of the kind &quot;let your teammate pass&quot; to their drivers.

In the final race at Abu Dhabi, Sebastian Vettel won the race and the Formula One Drivers&#x27; Championship. Red Bull finished the year with a total of 9 Grand Prix victories with five going to Sebastian Vettel and four going to Mark Webber. Red Bull claimed a total of 15 pole positions with 10 going to Vettel and five going to Webber. The team scored six fastest laps three scored by Vettel and three scored by Webber. Horner also praised the sportsmanship of both drivers stating that they conducted themselves in a well orderly and mannered fashion.

====Renault full-works partnership era (2011–2015)====
=====2011 season=====
Red Bull Racing was officially promoted to Renault&#x27;s full-works partnership status, receiving free engines as Renault&#x27;s full-works constructor team was rebranded to Lotus Renault GP. Both Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber were retained by the team for the season, as was engine supplier Renault. Vettel defended his world title – becoming the ninth driver to do so – after winning eleven of the season&#x27;s races, and also achieved 15 pole positions during the season, breaking Nigel Mansell&#x27;s record from the season. Webber finished the season in third place in the championship, taking one victory, in the final race of the season in Brazil. The team also defended their respective title, as they finished the season with 650 points in the Constructors&#x27; Championship, 153 points ahead of the next closest team, McLaren. Nissan&#x27;s premium automotive brand Infiniti joined Red Bull Racing as an official partner for the 2011 and 2012 seasons which saw Infiniti logos appear on the race car, drivers overalls and team kit.

=====2012 season=====

For the 2012 season, Red Bull retained the duo of Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber from the previous three years. Webber was signed on a one-year contract extension while Vettel continued under his current multi-year agreement, ending at the end of 2014. Vettel won the Drivers&#x27; Championship for a third consecutive time in 2012 making him the youngest triple World Champion, surpassing Ayrton Senna.

=====2013 season=====
The team was renamed Infiniti Red Bull Racing for the 2013 season following the announcement that premium automotive brand Infiniti had become Title Partner and Vehicle Performance Partner of the team. Infiniti Red Bull continued with drivers Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber for the fifth consecutive season. As with 2012, Webber was signed on a single year contract while Vettel continued to honour his current multi-year agreement.

In Australia, the first race of the season, Vettel placed the new RB9 on pole position but struggled in the race finishing in 3rd place behind title rivals of 2012, Kimi Räikkönen and Fernando Alonso whilst teammate Webber finished in sixth place. In Malaysia the team went better with Vettel again putting the RB9 on pole, but unlike in Australia winning the race, albeit under heavy controversy. Vettel won the race after disobeying a direct team order. Red Bull ordered both its drivers to maintain position with the now infamous ‘Multi 21’ instruction, which was a code for the driver in car #2 (Webber) must remain ahead of the other driver in car #1 (Vettel). Vettel ignored the order and passed Webber with 13 laps remaining. In the cool down room Webber could be heard asking his teammate &quot;Multi-21, Seb. Multi-21!” and so despite the 1–2 result, the race was overshadowed by Vettel&#x27;s actions. In China, the third race of the season, Vettel qualified in 9th whilst Webber qualified 14th after an issue with his fuel pick up led him to have to stop the car on the track. Infiniti Red Bull failed to give the FIA a 1-litre fuel sample, therefore, placing Webber at the back of the grid. The downfall of his performance was matched when a collision and then a dislodged wheel nut led to Webber not completing the race. Vettel finished in 4th, retaining his lead in the World Championship. In Bahrain, the fourth race of the season, Vettel qualified in second place behind Nico Rosberg. Webber qualified fifth but after a 3 place grid penalty started the race in seventh. In the race, Webber failed to improve on his qualifying position finishing 7th whilst his teammate won the race in a dominating fashion. After the fourth race of the season, Infiniti Red Bull finished the first round of flyaway races leading both the Drivers&#x27; and Constructors&#x27; Championships. Sebastian Vettel extended his contract with Infiniti Red Bull Racing until the end of 2015, despite interests in racing for Ferrari and Mercedes. At the , Mark Webber announced his retirement from Formula One at the end of the season, having signed a deal with Porsche in the FIA World Endurance Championship for 2014. It was then announced before the Italian Grand Prix that Daniel Ricciardo, the Toro Rosso driver, would replace Webber for the 2014 season, ending talk of Lotus&#x27;s Kimi Räikkönen taking Webber&#x27;s seat.

At the , Vettel secured the team&#x27;s 50th pole position, and 40th Grand Prix victory. At the , Vettel sealed the Drivers&#x27; Championship title, and in doing so, won the Constructors&#x27; Championship for Infiniti Red Bull Racing for the fourth consecutive year.

=====2014 season=====
Infiniti Red Bull started the season with reigning World Champion Sebastian Vettel and Daniel Ricciardo who replaced Mark Webber after he had announced in 2013 that he would be moving to Porsche in the World Endurance Championship for 2014.

In pre-season testing, it became clear, not just from Red Bull, but other Renault teams that the Renault engine was very unreliable and down on power compared to the Ferrari and Mercedes engines. Renault struggled to get the new hybrid engine to function properly all through testing with the combustion engine, the kinetic recovery system, and the turbo all unable to work as one.

At the , Ricciardo had qualified second on his first race for the team while Vettel qualified a rather distant 13th being at least 1.8 seconds off pole-sitter Lewis Hamilton. In the race itself, Ricciardo finished second while Vettel retired after just three laps due to a power unit failure. However, after the race, Ricciardo was disqualified for violating the FIA&#x27;s new rule of capping fuel use at 100 kg per hour in each race. He thus lost his podium finish. Red Bull appealed this decision on 14 April but lost their case.

At the Vettel qualified second while Ricciardo qualified fifth. On lap 49 Ricciardo had to retire due to a technical failure while Vettel went on to finish third and earn his first podium finish of the season. Ricciardo was hit with a ten-place grid penalty for the , due to an unsafe release by Red Bull at one of his pit stops. At the Ricciardo qualified third, but dropped to 13th due to his ten-place grid penalty from the previous week. Vettel qualified 11th. Ricciardo managed to finish fourth, obtaining his first championship points of the season. Vettel finished sixth. At the , under harsh weather conditions, Ricciardo qualified 2nd, with Vettel qualifying third. Ricciardo finished in 4th again, nearly 25 seconds ahead of his teammate Vettel, who finished 5th.

Ricciardo would go on to obtain the first podium finish in his career as a Formula One driver at the , after qualifying third, over a second behind polesitter Lewis Hamilton. Vettel did not participate in Q3 due to problems with his gearbox, which ultimately needed to be replaced, incurring a five-place grid penalty. Despite starting from the 15th position, Vettel managed to finish the race in 4th, setting the fastest lap of the race in the process. In Canada, Ricciardo won the race, achieving his first career victory in Formula One.

After an with poor results, including Vettel&#x27;s retirement, Christian Horner described the performance of the Renault engine as &quot;unacceptable.&quot; He also mocked Renault in an interview with Servus TV by saying that &quot;the big difference between Mercedes and Renault is that when a driver with a Mercedes engine pushes the overtake button his car goes faster. When our drivers, which have a Renault engine, push the button, the car stops!&quot;

The team finished second in the championship on 405 points, with the team only winning three races throughout the season.

=====2015 season=====

Daniel Ricciardo returned for a second season with the team. At the previous year&#x27;s , the team announced that Vettel would leave after the 2014 season. He was replaced by Daniil Kvyat for 2015, who had spent a single season with the junior Toro Rosso team.

2015 for Infiniti Red Bull was seen initially as a continuous resurgence for the team. It was expected from the progress Renault made with the engine in 2014 that in 2015 it would be close to the Mercedes duo of Hamilton and Rosberg. However, it quickly became apparent that reliability, power, and drivability were all major issues that plagued the team through the season.

At the Ricciardo qualified 7th while Kvyat qualified 13th. Kvyat failed to start the race due to a gearbox failure, whilst Ricciardo finished the race in sixth, a lap down from the race winner, Lewis Hamilton. The team scored their best finish in Hungary, where Ricciardo and Kvyat finished 2–3. Their only opportunity to win a race occurred at the , however, both of the team&#x27;s drivers made some mistakes allowing both of the Mercedes cars to pass them. Lewis Hamilton won the race and, as a result, his third Formula One World Championship.

Come the end of the season, it was the first winless season for Infiniti Red Bull since 2008, and come seasons end, Red Bull wanted to end its partnership with Renault due to the lack of progress and confidence expressed by Renault. Red Bull would however be unable to agree to have another engine instead opting to run Renault engines for the 2016 season but rebadged as TAG-Heuer.

They ended the season in fourth place on 187 points with Kvyat in seventh (95 points) and Ricciardo in eighth (92 points), their lowest finish position in seven years.

==== TAG Heuer era (2016–2018) ====
===== 2016 season =====

For 2016, Red Bull Racing used Renault engines branded as TAG Heuer due to their public breakdown with Renault in 2015. Infiniti also departed as a main sponsor to the newly reformed Renault Sport Formula One Team for the same reason. The team announced on 17 March 2016, one day before the Australian Grand Prix weekend, that they had formed a new technology partnership with Aston Martin, for the new season.

At the , Red Bull recorded their first podium of the season with Daniil Kvyat finishing third behind Sebastian Vettel and Nico Rosberg.

Daniil Kvyat and Max Verstappen traded places ahead of the , with Verstappen promoted to Red Bull Racing and Kvyat returning to Scuderia Toro Rosso. Verstappen eventually won the Spanish Grand Prix, becoming the youngest ever Grand Prix winner.
2016 in general was a much stronger season for Red Bull Racing than 2015, especially after Max Verstappen replaced Daniil Kvyat. This may be because Daniel Ricciardo was pushed much more by Verstappen than he was by Kvyat, Ricciardo stating he has learned from Verstappen&#x27;s driving techniques to improve as a driver. Red Bull would go on to collect podium finishes with Max Verstappen in Austria and Silverstone, with Daniel Ricciardo in Monaco, Budapest and in Singapore, with both Verstappen and Ricciardo being on the podium in Germany and Malaysia. Daniel Ricciardo collected his 4th career victory in Malaysia after Lewis Hamilton&#x27;s engine failure. Verstappen had challenged for the victory but was compromised due to an incident at the start between Vettel and Rosberg leading to Verstappen referring to Vettel as &#x27;crazy&#x27;. This incident was the latest flare-up between Vettel and Verstappen after the two disagreed over a first corner collision at the Belgian Grand Prix which resulted in Max failing to score at a race where he started on the front row, outqualifying his teammate for only the 2nd time, in which a large number of Dutch fans had travelled to see him race.

Towards the end of the Brazilian Grand Prix Verstappen dropped to 14th after changing back to wet tyres. He then gained 11 places in the closing 16 laps finishing in third place.

Red Bull Racing finished second in the Constructors&#x27; Championship that year, with Daniel Ricciardo taking third in the Drivers&#x27; Championship.

===== 2017 season =====

In 2017, Red Bull Racing retained their 2016 driver line-up and continued using TAG Heuer-branded Renault engines. In the first race in Australia, Ricciardo retired on lap 25, in a weekend plagued with problems for him, while Verstappen finished 5th.

Verstappen suffered various reliability issues with the car, suffering three retirements due to the engine and one due to an electric problem at the . He was also involved in three first-lap collisions that ended in retirement.

The team won three races in ; Ricciardo won the after starting tenth, while Verstappen won the and the . Moreover, Verstappen and Ricciardo finished second and third at the . In the Drivers&#x27; Championship, Ricciardo finished fifth with 200 points and Verstappen sixth with 168 points. The team finished third in the Constructors&#x27; Championship with 368 points.

===== 2018 season =====
Ricciardo and Verstappen were both retained by the team for the 2018 season. On 25 September 2017, it was announced that Aston Martin would become Red Bull Racing&#x27;s title sponsor from 2018.

The team suffered a double retirement at the ; Ricciardo retired on lap 2 with an electrical issue, whilst Verstappen retired two laps later. Ricciardo then took the team&#x27;s first win of the season at the following race, the , having started sixth on the grid. During the , both drivers crashed into each other at Turn 1. The team achieved a podium with Verstappen, during the securing the 3rd place, while Ricciardo achieved 5th place. At the Red Bull had a dominant car due to its highly efficient high down-force setup. Ricciardo scored a pole position, and despite running into an engine issue costing him power, he eventually won the race. This incident re-ignited the bad relationship with its engine manufacturer, Renault. Meanwhile, Verstappen crashed during free practice 3 and started from 20th on the grid, finishing the race in 9th place. This race also put an end to a streak of incidents for Verstappen. Monaco was also the last race that saw Daniel Ricciardo on the podium with Red Bull, with him parting ways with the team and joining rival team Renault at the end of the season.

The European season saw consistent podiums and a good form, with Verstappen winning Red Bull&#x27;s home race at the Red Bull Ring during the . The second half of the season saw great form from Verstappen and good development of the car, as Verstappen scored 6 out of 8 possible podiums, and was the driver which scored the most points following the 2018 World Champion Lewis Hamilton. Ricciardo had a spree of mechanical issues and retirements during the second half of the season, with him getting 7 retirements in total and no podiums after the first six races coming to the end of the season. Verstappen won the from second after pole position was grabbed by his teammate, making it Red Bull&#x27;s first front-row lock-out in the turbo-hybrid era.

Verstappen was also finding himself in a back-to-back win at the Brazilian Grand Prix but clashed with rival Esteban Ocon as the latter tried to unlap himself, costing him the victory. Following the race the drivers conflicted, resulting in 2 days of public service for Verstappen, which he completed on 9 February 2019. Ricciardo&#x27;s multiple retirements would end up costing both himself and Red Bull key points in the Drivers&#x27; and Constructors&#x27; Championships. Verstappen would finish the 2018 season in 4th place, just 3 points behind Kimi Räikkönen while Daniel Ricciardo would finish the season in 6th place, behind Valtteri Bottas. Red Bull would finish the season in 3rd place behind Mercedes and Ferrari.

By the , Red Bull, encouraged by the progress of Honda in the sister team Scuderia Toro Rosso, decided that in 2019 it would officially end its relationship with Renault for the Honda power.

=== Honda engines (2019–2025) ===
==== Works-era (2019–2021)====
===== 2019 season =====
Preceding the 2018 , Red Bull Racing confirmed they are to utilise full-works Honda power units from 2019 to 2020, signing a two-year deal and thus ending their twelve-year partnership with Renault. The switch to Honda marked the first time since that Honda supplied two teams (own works team and Super Aguri) in the sport respectively.

On 3 August 2018, it was announced that Ricciardo would be leaving the team at the end of the season to join Renault, signing a two-year contract with them. Pierre Gasly was promoted from Toro Rosso to replace him.

On 12 August 2019, it was announced that Alex Albon would move to Red Bull Racing for the rest of the season, replacing Gasly, who returned to Toro Rosso.

===== 2020 season =====
For the 2020 season, the team retained Max Verstappen and Alex Albon as their line-up.

Because of a modified calendar due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the first race of the season was the Austrian Grand Prix. Toward the beginning of the race, Max Verstappen&#x27;s Red Bull retired due to a technical issue. Later in this race, whilst making a charge for his first podium, Alex Albon was involved in an incident with Lewis Hamilton which led to the Red Bull leaving the track and finishing in thirteenth. For the next six rounds, Verstappen finished in the podium positions including winning the 70th Anniversary Grand Prix. Meanwhile, Albon consistently scored points but failed to finish with a podium. During the Italian Grand Prix, Alex Albon had an incident with Pierre Gasly at turn 1 dropping him to fifteenth and was also given a five-second penalty for pushing Romain Grosjean during lap 5 leading to him finishing fifteenth. On the other hand, Verstappen had another mechanical issue and retired on lap 3. The next week however, Albon scored his first-ever Formula One podium at the finishing third while Verstappen had a collision with Gasly forcing him to retire. For the rest of the season, Verstappen managed to finish in the podium every race but three and Albon finished with one more.

The team ended the season in second in the World Constructors&#x27; Championship with 319 points. In the World Drivers&#x27; Championship, Verstappen finished third with 214 points and Albon finished seventh with 105 points. Following the season, Red Bull announced that Sergio Perez would replace Alex Albon as the second Red Bull driver for the 2021 season.

===== 2021 season =====
In October 2020, engine manufacturer Honda announced it would end its full-works participation in Formula One at the end of the 2021 season. Verstappen was contracted to continue racing for the team with experienced Mexican Sergio Pérez becoming his teammate as Albon took the reserve driver role. Verstappen took pole position at the season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix. Verstappen was later out-qualified by Sergio Pérez at the 2021 Emilia Romagna Grand Prix, but went on to win the race and be just one point behind Lewis Hamilton in the Drivers&#x27; Championship standings. At the Monaco Grand Prix, Red Bull Racing took the lead of the Constructors&#x27; Championship for the first time since the 2013 Brazilian Grand Prix as a result of another Verstappen win and a poor result for Mercedes. Verstappen also took the lead in the championship for the first time in his career after the race. In the Azerbaijan Grand Prix Verstappen led the majority of the race and looked set to win before a late-race tyre blowout. Pérez won the race. Verstappen then took pole and won the next three races while Pérez took one more podium in France to grow Red Bull&#x27;s championship lead.

At Silverstone, Red Bull was beaten in Friday qualifying but Verstappen won the sprint on Saturday to claim a 4th consecutive pole position. During the race, Hamilton and Verstappen made contact at Copse corner, resulting in Verstappen crashing out of the race. In Hungary, both Red Bulls suffered severe damage in a first-lap accident triggered by Mercedes&#x27; Valtteri Bottas. Pérez was out of the race, Verstappen managed to salvage a 9th-place finish. In Spa Verstappen took pole and won a rain-shortened race in which half points were awarded. In Italy, Hamilton and Verstappen made contact yet again at the Rettifilo chicane which resulted in both drivers retiring from the race, and Verstappen receiving a 3-place grid penalty for the next race, as the stewards judged him at fault for the collision. At the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, Verstappen took pole position, his first since Austin. He secured his first world title and a first championship for the team since 2013 with a last lap overtake on Hamilton.

On 10 October 2022, the FIA announced that Red Bull were one of two teams who had breached the 2021 Financial Regulations applicable during the season, with Red Bull committing what was described as &quot;a Procedural Breach and a Minor Financial Overspend (less than 5% of the Cost Cap)&quot;. On 28 October 2022, the FIA announced that Red Bull had entered an Accepted Breach Agreement; in summary Red Bull were in breach of 13 points of non-compliance. The agreement resulted in a $7m fine and a 10% reduction in permitted aerodynamic research.

==== Red Bull Powertrains collaboration with Honda (2022–2025) ====
===== 2022 season =====
American multinational software company Oracle became the team&#x27;s title sponsor for the season.

Following Honda&#x27;s withdrawal as a works entity after 2021, an engine development freeze lobbied by Red Bull allowed them to sign a deal with Honda to use their engines until the end of 2024 (this would later be extended until 2025). The initial deal would see Red Bull receive the Honda engine I.P and then construct and maintain the engines through a newly formed company named Red Bull Powertrains Limited which also took over part of Honda&#x27;s Milton Keynes facility. This was only made possible by the engine freeze being agreed upon as Red Bull, at the time, did not have the ability to further develop the Honda engine and without the freeze, there were concerns of falling behind rival manufacturers. For the 2022 season, to reflect Honda&#x27;s initial decision to withdraw, it was agreed that Red Bull would rebrand the Honda engines as RBPT power units.

During the season, as future regulations were announced for the next generation power units for the 2026 season, that initial deal was scrapped and another was created that would see Honda remain involved and retain all I.P of its engines and agree to continue to manufacture, supply and maintain the engines until the end of the current regulations at the conclusion of the 2025 season. Despite their withdrawal, Honda developed and manufactured an improved power unit in time for the 2022 season – which would be used up to the end of 2024 – and will continue to provide trackside support and maintenance. The Honda-Red Bull deal was later extended to include the 2025 season.

On 27 July, in Morocco, official information was published on the approval of an application submitted jointly by Porsche and Red Bull GmbH in which Porsche acquired 50% of the shares in Red Bull Technology, the parent company of Red Bull Racing and its Formula One program. This application had to be filed with the antitrust authorities of up to 20 countries, including outside the European Union. The press release was due to go out for the Austrian GP, however the FIA did not approve the regulations for the 2026 engines before 29 June as planned, delaying official confirmation of Porsche&#x27;s entry into Formula One. However, by March 2023 Porsche had decided to abandon its planned entry into F1.

Max Verstappen secured the sixth Drivers&#x27; World Championship for the team at the Japanese Grand Prix, dominating much of the season winning 15 out of 22 races. He then won the United States Grand Prix to secure the Constructors&#x27; World Championship for Red Bull, their fifth overall and the first since 2013.

===== 2023 season =====
Red Bull Racing retained their 2022 line-up, defending World Champion Max Verstappen and teammate Sergio Pérez, for the 2023 season. To reflect the re-strengthened deal agreed upon in 2022, Honda returned to being the named supplier of engines and it&#x27;s branding was added back to the cars and team kit. 

Immediately, the RB19 was on the pace, outpacing all the other teams during pre-season testing. This pace was confirmed at the first race in Bahrain when Verstappen, who took a comfortable pole position and race victory – the first of many throughout 2023. His teammate Pérez would himself win two races during the season, taking victory at the Saudi Arabian and Azerbaijan Grands Prix. The only race Red Bull did not win throughout the 2023 season was in Singapore, where Verstappen and Pérez finished fifth and eighth respectively; Verstappen&#x27;s former Toro Rosso teammate Carlos Sainz Jr. would take the victory at Marina Bay.

Red Bull remained consistent throughout the season, going on to secure the Constructors&#x27; Championship after Max Verstappen&#x27;s triumph at the Japanese Grand Prix. He would then secure the Drivers&#x27; Championship at the following Qatar Grand Prix sprint event, with his victory at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix marking the culmination of one of Red Bull&#x27;s most successful seasons in Formula One to date. Following the success of the previous year&#x27;s RB18, the RB19, also designed by Adrian Newey, was noted as being one of the most dominant cars in Formula One history. The RB19 won 21 out of the 22 races in the season, with a 95.45% win rate, outperforming the McLaren MP4/4, another Honda-powered car with a high win rate. The MP4/4 had won 15 out of 16 races in the season with a 93.8% win rate; the only race it did not win is the 1988 Italian Grand Prix – which, like the 2023 Singapore Grand Prix, was won by Ferrari.

Winning the 2023 Hungarian Grand Prix, the twelfth consecutive race Red Bull had won, set the record for most consecutive wins by a constructor, beating the record of eleven which had been held by McLaren since the 1988 Belgian Grand Prix. The streak was subsequently extended to fifteen, with wins at the Belgian, Dutch, and Italian Grands Prix. In addition, Verstappen became the first driver to surpass 1,000 laps led in a single season, and became the only driver to complete every racing lap in the 2023 season.

===== 2024 season =====
Red Bull Racing retained their 2023 line-up, 3-times World Champion Max Verstappen and teammate Sergio Pérez, for the 2024 season. The RB20 was revealed on 15 February, with what Verstappen described as a &quot;bold&quot; and &quot;aggressive&quot; design.

Red Bull Racing comfortably won the first two races, with Verstappen winning with over a ten-second gap from the car behind – both times the second car of Sergio Pérez. However, a brake failure due to overheating in the 2024 Australian Grand Prix caused Max Verstappen to retire.

The team achieved its one-hundredth pole position at the 2024 Chinese Grand Prix, with Max Verstappen on pole. The team acquired their first pole position fifteen years earlier with Sebastian Vettel at the 2009 Chinese Grand Prix.

During the summer break, Red Bull Racing announced the departure of its Sporting Director, Jonathan Wheatley after 18 years with the team. He will remain with the team until the end of the 2024 season, before entering a period of gardening leave in 2025. He is set to join upcoming Formula One team, Audi, with the position of team principal in 2026.

Red Bull slowly recovered from issues stemming from an underfloor tweak at the 2023 Spanish Grand Prix. A new floor was introduced at the 2024 Azerbaijan Grand Prix, slightly improving the RB20&#x27;s pace. Following a remarkable victory from Max Verstappen after starting from P17 in the 2024 São Paulo Grand Prix, Max scored 31 points during the weekend, securing his championship lead. He went on to take P5 in the 2024 Las Vegas Grand Prix, outscoring his championship rival, Lando Norris, winning his fourth championship at 403 points. Verstappen then won the following Qatar Grand Prix. However, this was not enough to stop the team losing all mathematical chance of retaining the constructors&#x27; title the team had won in 2022 and 2023 as Pérez retired with a clutch issue.

===== 2025 season =====
During the 2024 Miami Grand Prix race weekend, Red Bull Racing announced the departure of its Chief Technical Officer, Adrian Newey after 19 years with the team. He will leave in the first quarter of 2025. Despite initially having signed a contract until 2026, it was announced on 18 December 2024 that Sergio Pérez had mutually terminated his contract with Red Bull and would leave the team after four seasons. On 19 December, it was announced that Liam Lawson, who had already driven for Red Bull&#x27;s sister team AlphaTauri/RB for parts of 2023 and 2024, would be lining up alongside Verstappen for the 2025 season.

===RBPT-Ford engines (2026 onwards)===
After months of speculation, Porsche AG confirmed in September that talks with Red Bull GmbH would not continue. The intention was to reach an engine and team partnership, based on equal footing but the negotiations never came to fruition. Instead, on 3 February 2023, Ford Motor Company announced a partnership with Red Bull Powertrains that would begin during the 2026 season, providing &quot;expertise in areas including battery cell and electric motor technology as well as power unit control software and analytics&quot; and &quot;combustion engine development&quot; for Red Bull Racing and RB Formula One Team.

The new power unit (PU) regulations in 2026 by the FIA will retain the same layout as current engines, with the same RPM. However, a reduced fuel flow rate will be introduced. A power output of 400kW (539 HP) will be achieved with the new PUs. The Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) will be simplified to reduce costs. The Energy Recovery System (ERS) will be increased to 350kW, compared to the previous 120kW.

== Corporate information ==

=== Image and marketing ===
Red Bull has been very vocal about wanting to make Formula One &quot;fun&quot; again. One way in which they went about doing that was by employing Mark Gallagher, who was head of marketing for nine years at Jordan, itself an exciting brand in the late 1990s. Red Bull also started &quot;The Red Bulletin&quot;, a sports and adventure magazine that is released four times per race weekend and distributed to the paddock and members of the public from behind the main grandstand at each track.

In the 2006 Monaco Grand Prix, they supported the movie &quot;Superman Returns&quot;, which continues the line of marketing events begun by the &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot; promotion of 2005 (in the 2005 race, the pit crew dressed up as clone troopers) and the &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Twelve&quot; promotion of 2004, as well as &quot;Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines&quot; promotion of 2003 when the team ran under the Jaguar Racing banner. When Coulthard finished third in the 2006 race, he donned a Superman cape for his appearance on the podium.

In the 2019 British Grand Prix, 007 logos were used in the livery to replace the Aston Martin logos, to celebrate the 1007th Grand Prix. The cars also had Bond-themed number plates on the underside of their rear wings. Max Verstappen had the number plate from the Aston Martin DB5 from &quot;Goldfinger&quot; (BMT 216A) while Pierre Gasly&#x27;s car featured the Aston Martin V8 plate (B549 WUU) from &quot;The Living Daylights&quot;. Both drivers wore special racing overalls with a print of a single-breasted dinner suit. The 007 logo was first used during their race as Jaguar in the 2002 season to promote &quot;Die Another Day&quot;.

At the 2024 Goodwood Festival of Speed, Red Bull celebrated its 20th year as a racing team by bringing together past and present drivers for celebrations, including: a parade of Red Bull Formula One cars driven by those drivers, team lead Christian Horner and technical director Adrian Newey; an on-site Red Bull &#x27;Energy Station&#x27; with displays and a press and fan meeting place; and photo-ops, including a group photo of Horner and Newey with Red Bull Academy ProgrammeF1 Academy-championship driver Hamda Al Qubaisi (2023– ) and RBR Formula One drivers David Coulthard (–), Christian Klien (2005–), Mark Webber (–), Daniel Ricciardo (–), Max Verstappen (– ) and Sergio Perez (–).

=== Finances ===
Red Bull Racing had revenue of $285.4 million and expenses of $284.4 million in 2011. The revenue came from prize money ($88.8 million), sponsors ($59.7 million), and the remainder from Red Bull. Expenses included $112.8 million in research and development and $82.7 million in salaries for 605 employees.

=== Red Bull Technology ===
Red Bull Technology Limited, previously Red Bull Racing Holdings Limited, is the parent company of Red Bull Racing set up to design, engineer, and build the cars for its Formula One team, and previously its sister team Scuderia Toro Rosso. Red Bull Technology was regarded as a loop-hole to allow Red Bull to run two teams with the same car from 2007, which had been prohibited in Formula One since the 1980s. Complaints were issued to the FIA from rival teams, but they were discarded by the sport&#x27;s governing body. Neither Red Bull Racing nor Scuderia Toro Rosso denied they ran fundamentally the same chassis, but claimed the separate development programs, different engines and in their opinion that the chassis was designed by neither team made it legal.

The regulations were changed in 2010 to forbid the use of identical cars between teams, and Toro Rosso no longer had its cars produced by Red Bull Technology. Since then the team indigenously designed and built their cars, having built the necessary infrastructure in-house.

Red Bull Technology also partnered Scuderia Toro Rosso, later Scuderia AlphaTauri and Visa Cash App RB as their transmission partner and supplier from 2006 onwards, and KERS partner and supplier from 2011 to 2013. They also served Team Lotus, later Caterham F1 as transmission supplier from 2011 to 2014 and KERS supplier from 2012 to 2013.

Red Bull Technology uses &quot;rFactor Pro&quot; driving simulation software.

=== Red Bull Advanced Technologies ===
Red Bull Advanced Technologies Limited (RBAT) is owned by Red Bull GmbH and serves as the commercial technology and engineering services arm of Red Bull Racing. The company is based in the United Kingdom, in a dedicated facility, adjacent to the Red Bull Racing Formula One facilities.

Red Bull Advanced Technologies in collaboration with Aston Martin developed the Aston Martin Valkyrie sports car.

Red Bull Advanced Technologies in a collaborative effort with Dallara and IndyCar, developed the &#x27;aeroscreen&#x27; safety device for usage in the IndyCar Series.

Red Bull Advanced Technologies announced in June 2022 that they were developing a hypercar completely in-house, named the RB17, in line with their Formula One car naming scheme. The car would be designed by Adrian Newey, Chief Technical Officer at Red Bull Racing. Only 50 units are to be made, with production scheduled to begin in 2025. The prototype was revealed to the public at Goodwood Festival of Speed by Oracle Red Bull Racing Team in July 2024.

== Sister Formula One team ==
In the autumn of 2005, Red Bull announced that they had purchased the cash-strapped Minardi Formula One team, and it would be known as Scuderia Toro Rosso (Italian for &quot;Team Red Bull&quot;)(STR) from 2006 onwards. STR operates as a separate team, but the two share certain technical resources. In 2006, STR used a chassis based on the 2005 Red Bull Racing Red Bull RB1 chassis, originally designed by Jaguar Racing, and Minardi&#x27;s contracted supply of rev-limited V10 Cosworth engines. It was widely speculated that the 2007 chassis for both teams would be essentially the same Adrian Newey design, although Red Bull was careful to announce that the &quot;STR2 will be built by Red Bull Technology, and Toro Rosso will fully own the intellectual rights of the car&quot;. Formula One teams are not allowed to use another team&#x27;s chassis. STR has been used as a &#x27;B&#x27; team for Red Bull Racing, allowing the company to work with more drivers. As of the 2010 season this arrangement was outlawed, and the STR5 is the first Toro Rosso car designed and built in-house. In 2006, Red Bull Racing driver Vitantonio Liuzzi was given a full-time seat with STR alongside another Red Bull sponsored driver, Scott Speed. Liuzzi retained his seat in STR for the 2007 season. Sebastian Vettel replaced Speed in the middle of the 2007 season, and Sébastien Bourdais replaced Liuzzi at STR for the season. Against expectation, Toro Rosso performed well during the 2008 season and Sebastian Vettel won the 2008 Italian Grand Prix. This meant that STR took their first win before Red Bull Racing, and helped to secure Vettel a drive with Red Bull Racing for 2009 when he also took that team&#x27;s first win.

For , the team was rebranded as Scuderia AlphaTauri to promote Red Bull&#x27;s fashion brand of the same name. Scuderia AlphaTauri achieved their maiden Grand Prix win under the new name at the 2020 Italian Grand Prix. The race marked Pierre Gasly&#x27;s first career race victory and the first for a French driver since Olivier Panis won the 1996 Monaco Grand Prix 24 years prior.

For , the team was rebranded as RB Formula One Team and is competing as Visa Cash App RB Formula One Team. Daniel Ricciardo and Yuki Tsunoda were retained from the previous season.

For 2025, the team was rebranded as Racing Bulls and is competing as Visa Cash App Racing Bulls F1 Team. Yuki Tsunoda was retained from the previous season and Isack Hadjar was signed for his rookie season.

<text>The Choptank River is a major tributary of the Chesapeake Bay and the largest river on the Delmarva Peninsula. Running for , it rises in Kent County, Delaware, runs through Caroline County, Maryland, and forms much of the border between Talbot County, Maryland, on the north, and Caroline County and Dorchester County on the east and south. It is located north of the Nanticoke River, and its mouth is located south of Eastern Bay. Cambridge, the county seat of Dorchester County, and Denton, the county seat of Caroline County, are located on its south shore.

Its watershed area in Maryland is , of which is open water, so it is 22% water. The predominant land use is agricultural with , or 48% of the land area. The river is named after the native Choptank people.

==Course==
The Choptank River begins at Choptank Mills, Delaware, where Tidy Island Creek and Culbreth Marsh Ditch join together. It ends at the Chesapeake Bay in a very wide mouth between Blackwalnut Point on Tilghman Island, and Cook Point, near Hudson, Maryland. Tidy Island Creek and Culbreth Marsh Ditch rise in western Kent County, Delaware. The entire watershed is in the coastal plain. The Choptank reaches sea level near Denton, Maryland, and is not salty until around below Denton.

==Navigability==
The river is navigable up to Denton, about 45 miles upriver. The bridge at Cambridge limits traffic to 50 feet vertical clearance. The river’s mouth is marked in the main channel by an abandoned, tilting masonry lighthouse on the underwater Sharps’ Island. Knapp’s Narrows offers a shortcut to boats approaching from the north.

==Tributaries==
Its main tributaries are the Tred Avon River and Tuckahoe Creek on the north side, and Cabin Creek and Hunting Creek on the south side. There are several small creeks on the northern shore, including Harris Creek, Broad Creek, Edge Creek, Irish Creek, Island Creek, La Trappe Creek, Bolingbroke Creek, Mile Creek, Kings Creek, Forge Branch and Broadway Branch. On the southern shore the small creeks include Jenkins Creek, the Warwick River, Marsh Creek, Maryland, Skeleton Creek, Mitchell Run, Hog Creek, Fowling Creek, Robins Creek, Church Creek, Williston Creek, Watts Creek, Chapel Branch, Spring Branch, Gravelly Branch and Cow Marsh Creek.

He also translated Goda Devi&#x27;s Tamil Tiruppavai into Telugu Keertanaas. Other translations of Tiruppavai are available - but they are all word for word. His translation is unique because he had taken the central idea of each Pasuram, made it into Pallavi and wove around it the rest of the paasuram into anupallavi and charanam(s).

<text>Mel Lisboa Alves (born 17 January 1982) is a Brazilian actress.

== Biography ==
Lisboa was born in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul. She is the daughter of the astrologer Cláudia Lisboa Alves and the musician Bebeto Alves. She studied cinema at the Fluminense Federal University (UFF), in Niterói, but left the course to pursue acting. She has no direct degree of kinship with the gaúcho musician Nei Lisboa.

== Career ==
She debuted as an actress in 2001, starring in the miniseries, &quot;Presença de Anita&quot;, playing Anita, a mysterious and seductive young woman. Due to the great sexual appeal of this character, she participated in a sensual essay for the Paparazzo site. The mini-series earned an average of 30 IBOPE points and was broadcast in full in 2002 on TV Globo.

In 2002, in the soap opera &quot;Desejos de Mulher&quot;, she played Gabriela, a young woman from the interior with aspirations of becoming a model. This project was not as successful as Presença de Anita, due to Lisboa’s association with her previous role and the low ratings of the pilot. The actress, at the time, acknowledged that she was dazzled by the success of such a prominent role, but that the experience of playing another role with little acceptance allowed her to mature.

In 2003, she participated in a second sensual essay, this time for Trip magazine. The following year she posed naked for the Brazilian edition of Playboy magazine, in its 29th anniversary edition. In the same year, after signing a contract with SBT which failed to go ahead, she returned to Rede Globo and worked on the soap opera &quot;Como uma Onda&quot;, playing Lenita Paiva, a spoiled rich girl.

In 2007 she became a television presenter at GNT / Sat TV Globo and released the book &quot;Mundo Afora – Diário de Bordo de Mel Lisboa&quot;, which included stories and photographs from her program. The same year she joined the cast of the soap opera &quot;Sete Pecados&quot; (&quot;Seven Sins&quot;), in which she played the role of Carla, a young, humble, but extremely ambitious girl with a questionable personality.

In 2011 she signed with Rede Record TV. Her first role was in the series &quot;Sansão e Dalila&quot; (&quot;Samson and Deliah&quot;), playing the female protagonist.

In October 2012, she was admitted to the hospital with an intestinal virus and had to cancel espetáculo.

In 2013, the actress returned to the stage in a theater play, &quot;Homem Não Entra&quot;, bringing the Western genre to the stage. She also returned to television in a new GNT show, &quot;As Canalhas&quot;, and a telenovela written by Carlos Lombardi, &quot;Pecado Mortal&quot; in the Rede Record.

In 2014, Mel Lisboa portrayed the singer Rita Lee in the play &quot;Rita Lee Mora ao Lado – O Musical&quot;, directed by Márcio Macena and Débora Dubois, based on the book &quot;Rita Lee Mora ao Lado – Uma biografia alucinada da rainha do rock&quot;, written by Henrique Bartsch.

In 2015 she played Henutmire in &quot;Os Dez Mandamentos&quot;, her most recent work on Rede Record.

== Personal life ==
Mel Lisboa was married to Brazilian actor Daniel Alvim from 2004 to 2008, and on November 8 of that same year, married musician Felipe Rosseno. The couple has been together since then and they have two children.

In 2009, she declared herself an atheist in an interview given to Tpm magazine.

<doc id="1173245" wikidata="Q1076521" url="?curid=1173245" title="Psychedelic experience">
<text>A psychedelic experience (known colloquially as a trip) is a temporary altered state of consciousness induced by the consumption of a psychedelic substance (most commonly LSD, mescaline, psilocybin mushrooms, or DMT). For example, an acid trip is a psychedelic experience brought on by the use of LSD, while a mushroom trip is a psychedelic experience brought on by the use of psilocybin. Psychedelic experiences feature alterations in normal perception such as visual distortions and a subjective loss of self-identity, sometimes interpreted as mystical experiences. Psychedelic experiences lack predictability, as they can range from being highly pleasurable (known as a good trip) to frightening (known as a bad trip). The outcome of a psychedelic experience is heavily influenced by the person&#x27;s mood, personality, expectations, and environment (also known as set and setting).

Researchers have interpreted psychedelic experiences in light of a range of scientific theories, including model psychosis theory, filtration theory, psychoanalytic theory, entropic brain theory, integrated information theory, and predictive processing. Psychedelic experiences are also induced and interpreted in religious and spiritual contexts.

Along with psilocybin&#x27;s unique effect on the state of mind, psilocybin has been subject to the idea of being used for therapeutic treatments. This rapidly developing field of psilocybin-assisted therapy is worth mentioning due to the promising results of studies targeting a variety of mental disorders like depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and obsessive-compulsive disorder(OCD).

==Etymology==
The term &quot;&quot; was coined by the psychiatrist Humphrey Osmond during written correspondence with author Aldous Huxley and presented to the New York Academy of Sciences by Osmond in 1957. It is derived from the Greek words and thus meaning &quot;mind manifesting,&quot; the implication being that psychedelics can develop unused potentials of the human mind. The term &quot;trip&quot; was first coined by US Army scientists during the 1950s when they were experimenting with LSD.

==Phenomenology==
Despite several attempts that have been made, starting in the 19th and 20th centuries, to define common phenomenological structures of the effects produced by classic psychedelics, a universally accepted taxonomy does not yet exist.

===Visual alteration===
A prominent element of psychedelic experiences is visual alteration. Psychedelic visual alteration often includes spontaneous formation of complex flowing geometric visual patterning in the visual field. When the eyes are open, the visual alteration is overlaid onto the objects and spaces in the physical environment; when the eyes are closed the visual alteration is seen in the &quot;inner world&quot; behind the eyelids. These visual effects increase in complexity with higher dosages, and also when the eyes are closed. The visual alteration does not normally constitute hallucinations, because the person undergoing the experience can still distinguish between real and imagined visual phenomena, though in some cases, true hallucinations are present. More rarely, psychedelic experiences can include complex hallucinations of objects, animals, people, or even whole landscapes. Visual alterations also include other effects such as afterimages, shifting of color hues, and pareidolia. The appearance of colors and light are usually enhanced.

=== Mystical experiences ===

A number of studies by Roland R. Griffiths and other researchers have concluded that high doses of psilocybin and other classic psychedelics trigger mystical experiences in most research participants. Mystical experiences have been measured by a number of psychometric scales, including the Hood Mysticism Scale, the Spiritual Transcendence Scale, and the Mystical Experience Questionnaire. The revised version of the Mystical Experience Questionnaire, for example, asks participants about four dimensions of their experience, namely the &quot;mystical&quot; quality, positive mood such as the experience of amazement, the loss of the usual sense of time and space, and the sense that the experience cannot be adequately conveyed through words. The questions on the &quot;mystical&quot; quality in turn probe multiple aspects: the sense of &quot;pure&quot; being, the sense of unity with one&#x27;s surroundings, the sense that what one experienced was real, and the sense of sacredness. Some researchers have questioned the interpretation of the results from these studies and whether the framework and terminology of mysticism are appropriate in a scientific context, while other researchers have responded to those criticisms and argued that descriptions of mystical experiences are compatible with a scientific worldview.

A group of researchers concluded in a 2011 study that psilocybin &quot;occasions personally and spiritually significant mystical experiences that predict long-term changes in behaviors, attitudes and values&quot;.

Some research has found similarities between psychedelic experiences and non-ordinary forms of consciousness experienced in meditation and near-death experiences. The phenomenon of ego dissolution is often described as a key feature of the psychedelic experience.

Individuals who have psychedelic experiences often describe what they experienced as &quot;more real&quot; than ordinary experience. For example, the psychologist Benny Shanon, after observing ayahuasca trips, referred to &quot;the assessment, very common with ayahuasca, that what is seen and thought during the course of intoxication defines the real, whereas the world that is ordinarily perceived is actually an illusion.&quot; Similarly, the psychiatrist Stanislav Grof described the LSD experience as &quot;complex revelatory insights into the nature of existence… typically accompanied by a sense of certainty that this knowledge is ultimately more relevant and &#x27;real&#x27; than the perceptions and beliefs we share in everyday life.&quot;

=== Bad trips ===

A &quot;bad trip&quot; is a highly unpleasant psychedelic experience. A bad trip on psilocybin, for instance, often features intense anxiety, confusion, agitation, or even psychotic episodes. Bad trips can be connected to the anxious ego-dissolution (AED) dimension of the APZ questionnaire used in research on psychedelic experiences. As of 2011, exact data on the frequency of bad trips are not available. Some research suggests that the risk of a bad trip on psilocybin is higher when multiple drugs are used, when the user has a history of certain mental illnesses, and when the user is not supervised by a sober person.

In clinical research settings, precautions including the screening and preparation of participants, the training of the session monitors who will be present during the experience, and the selection of appropriate physical setting can minimize the likelihood of psychological distress. Researchers have suggested that the presence of professional &quot;trip sitters&quot; (i.e., session monitors) may significantly reduce the negative experiences associated with a bad trip. In most cases in which anxiety arises during a supervised psychedelic experience, reassurance from the session monitor is adequate to resolve it; however, if distress becomes intense it can be treated pharmacologically, for example with the benzodiazepine diazepam.

Research shows that preparing for the psychedelic experience, as well as the set and setting of the individual and environment they will be in, can help mitigate &quot;bad trips&quot;. Harvard Psychologist Timothy Leary has said that &quot;set&quot; and &quot;setting&quot; are important to the experience. Set refers to the participants&#x27; internal state – their mental, emotional and physical state, as well as their intentions for the experience (whether they want to solve a complex problem, discover the underlying secrets of the universe, or heal from a past trauma) – the better these preliminary conditions, the better the experience usually goes. Setting refers to the environment the experience will take place in. Leary and others have found that, due to the highly suggestible nature of the psychedelic experience, the environment the participant is in plays a critical role. For example, a warmly decorated room with a comfortable couch, nice music and an overall welcoming atmosphere will have a much more positive effect than a cold stainless steel and concrete reinforced hospital room. Taking these necessary precautions before a psychedelic experience, along with the presence of trained professionals, have been shown to significantly reduce an overall negative experience.

The psychiatrist Stanislav Grof wrote that unpleasant psychedelic experiences are not necessarily unhealthy or undesirable, arguing that they may have potential for psychological healing and lead to breakthrough and resolution of unresolved psychic issues. Drawing on narrative theory, the authors of a 2021 study of 50 users of psychedelics found that many described bad trips as having been sources of insight or even turning points in life.

== Scientific models ==
Link R. Swanson divides scientific frameworks for understanding psychedelic experiences into two waves. In the first wave, encompassing nineteenth- and twentieth-century frameworks, he includes model psychosis theory (the psychotomimetic paradigm), filtration theory, and psychoanalytic theory. In the second wave of theories, encompassing twenty-first-century frameworks, Swanson includes entropic brain theory, integrated information theory, and predictive processing.

=== Model psychosis theory ===
Researchers studying mescaline in the early twentieth century and LSD in the mid-twentieth century took interest in these drugs as producing a temporary &quot;model psychosis&quot; that could assist researchers and medical students in understanding the experiences of patients with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.

It was popular to compare between experiences of psychedelics and psychosis in the mid-20th century. The scales used in psychosis and psychedelic research, in the late-20th and 21st century, are more different. Despite the many similarities that were observed between experiences of psychedelics and psychosis in the past, contemporary psychosis and psychedelic research highlight some features more than others (since they have different goals and assumptions), such as mysticism, connectedness, awe, peace, ego dissolution, hallucinations, suspiciousness, disorganization, hostility, grandiosity, and withdrawal.

=== Filtration theory ===
Aldous Huxley and Humphrey Osmond applied the pre-existing ideas of filtration theory, which held that the brain filters what enters into consciousness, to explain psychedelic experiences (and it is from this paradigm that the term &quot;psychedelic&quot; is derived). Huxley believed that the brain was filtering reality itself and that psychedelics granted conscious access to &quot;Mind at Large,&quot; whereas Osmond believed that the brain was filtering aspects of the mind out of consciousness. Swanson writes that Osmond&#x27;s view seems &quot;less radical, more compatible with materialist science, and less epistemically and ontologically committed&quot; than Huxley&#x27;s. Supporting this theory, research has found that LSD disrupts thalamic gating, leading to altered perceptions by allowing more information to flow through the brain&#x27;s gatekeeping mechanisms.

=== Psychoanalytic theory ===
Psychoanalytic theory was the predominant interpretive framework in mid-twentieth-century psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy. For instance, Czech psychiatrist Stanislav Grof characterised psychedelic experiencing as &quot;non-specific amplification of unconscious mental processes&quot;, and he analysed the phenomenology of the LSD experience (particularly the experience of what he termed psychospiritual death and rebirth) in terms of Otto Rank&#x27;s theory of the unresolved memory of the primal birth trauma.

=== Entropic brain theory ===
Entropic brain theory is a theory of consciousness proposed in 2014 by neuroscientist Robin Carhart-Harris and colleagues that was inspired by research on psychedelic drugs. The theory suggests that the entropy of brain activity within certain limits indexes the richness of conscious states, particularly under the influence of psychedelics. This theory posits that elevated brain entropy correlates with heightened informational richness, suggesting that psychedelics increase brain criticality, making it more sensitive to internal and external perturbations. This enhanced state of brain activity is proposed to influence susceptibility to environmental factors (&quot;set&quot; and &quot;setting&quot;) and potentially offer new insights for treating psychiatric and neurological disorders, including depression and disorders of consciousness.

=== Integrated information theory ===
Integrated information theory is a theory of consciousness proposing to explain all forms of consciousness, and has been applied specifically to psychedelic experiences by Andrew Gallimore.

=== Predictive processing ===
Sarit Pink-Hashkes and colleagues have applied the predictive processing paradigm in neuroscience to psychedelic experiences in order to formalize the idea of the entropic brain.

== In religious and spiritual contexts ==

Alan Watts likened psychedelic experiencing to the transformations of consciousness that are undertaken in Taoism and Zen, which he says is, &quot;more like the correction of faulty perception or the curing of a disease… not an acquisitive process of learning more and more facts or greater and greater skills, but rather an unlearning of wrong habits and opinions.&quot; Watts further described the LSD experience as, &quot;revelations of the secret workings of the brain, of the associative and patterning processes, the ordering systems which carry out all our sensing and thinking.&quot;

According to Luis Luna, psychedelic experiences have a distinctly gnosis-like quality; it is a learning experience that elevates consciousness and makes a profound contribution to personal development. For this reason, the plant sources of some psychedelic drugs such as ayahuasca and mescaline-containing cacti are sometimes referred to as &quot;plant teachers&quot; by those using those drugs.

Furthermore, psychedelic drugs have a history of religious use across the world that extends back for hundreds or perhaps thousands of years. They are often called entheogens because of the kinds of experiences they can induce, however various entheogens happen to also be hypnotics (muscimol mushrooms), deliriants (&quot;jimsonweed&quot;) or atypical/quasi-psychedelics like cannabis. Some small contemporary religious movements base their religious activities and beliefs around psychedelic experiences, such as Santo Daime and the Native American Church.

== Psychedelic-Assisted Therapy==

As mentioned in the beginning, psilocybin-assisted therapy has been proven to be beneficial when treating different kinds of psychiatric disorders due to its unique enhancements on the mind. Though the research with psilocybin-assisted therapy is fairly a new idea, its efficacy in improving mental disorders is undeniable.

===Depression===

Psilocybin is well known for its enhancements on the mind and overall mood, so it comes as no surprise that it was tested on individuals who suffer from depression. Psilocybin proved to be an efficient tool when it comes to treating, not only symptoms of depression, but also anxiety along with it. It was also found that these results were long-term upholding the possibility of psilocybin being used as a long-term treatment.

===Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder===
Individuals who suffer from PTSD have also been proven to reap benefits from psilocybin-assisted therapy. In this study it was found that MDMA had been very successful in reducing symptoms of PTSD, which led them to the conclusion that psilocybin would have very similar effects due to the similarities in these drugs.

===Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder===
In a study that reviewed a variety of drugs to determine if it had an impact on symptoms of OCD, psilocybin was also tested and determined effective in reducing symptoms. This reduction in symptoms applied to all individuals who participated in the study, proving psilocybin to be very reliable along with efficiency in reducing OCD symptoms.

<text>And Quiet Flows the Don (Quiet Flows the Don or The Silent Don, , literally &quot;The Quiet Don&quot;) is a novel in four volumes by Russian writer Mikhail Sholokhov. The first three volumes were written from 1925 to 1932 and published in the Soviet magazine &quot;Oktyabr&quot; in 1928–1932, and the fourth volume was finished in 1940.

The novel is considered one of the most significant works of literature in the 20th century. It depicts the lives and struggles of Don Cossacks during the First World War, the Russian Revolution, and Russian Civil War. In 1965, Sholokhov was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature for the novel.

==Plot summary==
The novel deals with the life of the Cossacks living in the Don River valley during the early 20th century, starting around 1912, just prior to World War I. The plot revolves around the Melekhov family of Tatarsk, who are descendants of a Cossack who, to the horror of many, took a Turkish captive as a wife during the Crimean War. She is accused of witchcraft by Melekhov&#x27;s superstitious neighbors, who attempt to kill her but are fought off by her husband. Their descendants, the son and grandsons, who are the protagonists of the story, are therefore often nicknamed &quot;Turks&quot;. Nevertheless, they command a high level of respect among people in Tatarsk.

The second eldest son, Grigory Panteleevich Melekhov, is a promising young soldier who falls in love with Aksinia, the wife of Stepan Astakhov, a family friend. Stepan regularly beats her and there is no love between them. Grigory and Aksinia&#x27;s romance and elopement raise a feud between her husband and his family. The outcome of this romance is the focus of the plot as well as the impending World and Civil Wars which draw the best young Cossack men into what will be two of Russia&#x27;s bloodiest wars. The action moves to the Austro-Hungarian front, where Grigory ends up saving Stepan&#x27;s life, but that doesn&#x27;t end the feud. Grigory, at his father&#x27;s insistence, takes a wife, Natalya, but still loves Aksinia.

Grigory takes part in the Civil War, changing sides four times (Red to White to Red to White to indifferent). Many of his friends and relatives are killed in action or executed by both the Reds and Whites. Natalya dies after a failed amateur abortion, leaving Grigory with two small children who are eventually cared for by Aksinia. This does not prevent Grigory and Aksinia from trying a final escape alone together, but she is killed by a stray bullet during a fight with Red troops. Grief-stricken, Grigory buries her and returns home, with his prospects unclear.

The book deals not only with the struggles and suffering of the Cossacks but also the landscape itself, which is vividly brought to life. 
There are also many folk songs referenced throughout the novel. 
&quot;And Quiet Flows the Don&quot; grew out of an earlier, unpublished work, the &quot;Donshina&quot;:I began the novel by describing the event of the Kornilov putsch in 1917. Then it became clear that this putsch, and more importantly, the role of the Cossacks in these events, would not be understood without a Cossack prehistory, and so I began with the description of the life of the Don Cossacks just before the beginning of World War I. (quote from &quot;M.A. Sholokhov: Seminarii&quot;, (1962) by F.A. Abramovic and V.V. Gura, quoted in &quot;Mikhail Aleksandrovich Sholokhov&quot;, by L.L. Litus.)

Protagonist Grigory Melekhov is reportedly based on two Cossacks from Veshenskaya, Pavel Nazarovich Kudinov and Kharlampii Vasilyevich Yermakov, who were key figures in the anti-Bolshevist struggle of the upper Don.

==Literary significance, criticism, and accusations of plagiarism==

The novel has been compared to Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;War and Peace&quot; (1869), notably by Maxim Gorky. Like the Tolstoy novel, &quot;And Quiet Flows the Don&quot; is an epic of Russian life during a tempestuous era of crisis, and examines it through political, military, romantic, and civilian lenses. Various rumours of plagiarism began circulating from 1930. Solzhenitsyn and others accused Sholokhov of plagiarizing a novel by Fyodor Kryukov, a more obscure author who fought against Bolshevism and died in 1920. An investigation in the late 1920s upheld Sholokhov&#x27;s authorship of &quot;Silent Don&quot;, and the allegations were denounced as malicious slander in &quot;Pravda&quot;.

During the Second World War, Sholokhov&#x27;s archive was destroyed in a bomb raid, and only the fourth volume survived. Sholokhov had his friend Vassily Kudashov look after it. Following Kudashov&#x27;s death in the war, his widow took possession of the manuscript, but she never disclosed her ownership. The manuscript was finally found by the Institute of World Literature of Russian Academy of Sciences in 1999 with assistance from the Russian Government. The writing paper dates back to the 1920s. 605 pages are in Sholokhov&#x27;s own hand, evidencing considerable re-drafting and re-organising of the material by Sholokhov, and 285 pages are transcribed by his wife Maria and sisters.

==Awards and nominations==
The novel won the Stalin Prize in 1941 and its author won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1965.

==Adaptations==
The novel has been adapted for the screen four times: a 1931 film by Ivan Pravov and Olga Preobrazhenskaya; a second, 1958 adaption was directed by Sergei Gerasimov and starred Elina Bystritskaya and Pyotr Glebov. In 1992–1993 a remake was directed by Sergei Bondarchuk (starring Rupert Everett); the film was not finished until 2006, when Fyodor Bondarchuk completed the editing, and was shown on Russian television as a seven-part miniseries. A shorter, 3-hour version of Bondarchuk&#x27;s &quot;And Quiet Flows the Don&quot; was released on DVD in several countries. In 2015 the novel was adapted again more comprehensively as a 14-part TV-series, directed by Sergey Ursulyak.

Ivan Dzerzhinsky based his opera &quot;&quot; (&quot;Tikhiy Don&quot;) on the novel, with the libretto adapted by his brother Leonid. Premiered in October 1935, it became popular after Stalin saw and praised it a few months later. The opera was proclaimed a model of socialist realism in music and won Dzerzhinsky a Stalin Prize.

The lyrics for the folk song &quot;Where Have All the Flowers Gone?&quot; by Pete Seeger and Joe Hickerson were adapted from the cossack folk &quot;Koloda duda&quot; () song sung by Daria in &quot;And Quiet Flows the Don&quot; Part 1, Chapter 3 (page 17 Knopf edition).

== English translations ==
The English translation by Harry C. Stephens (who used the name Stephen Garry) of the first two volumes appeared under the title &quot;And Quiet Flows the Don&quot; in 1934, while the other two were published in 1940 as &quot;The Don Flows Home to the Sea&quot;. The whole work was published as a set of two books under the title &quot;The Silent Don&quot;. Garry&#x27;s translation lacks about 25 percent of the novel text. In 1950 Garry&#x27;s translation was &quot;revised and completed&quot; by Robert Daglish. In 1984 Daglish published his own translation of the novel as &quot;Quiet Flows the Don&quot;.

<doc id="1173255" wikidata="Q5619043" url="?curid=1173255" title="Gunnar Hägglöf">
<text>Bo Gunnar Rickardsson Hägglöf (12 December 1904 – 12 January 1994) was a Swedish diplomat, in 1939 briefly cabinet member, then head of the foreign ministry&#x27;s bureau for foreign trade during World War II, after the war participating in the preparations of the United Nations&#x27; 1947 UN Partition Plan of Palestine, then ambassador to London 1948–1967 and Paris 1967–1971.

Gunnar Hägglöf has published several books, chiefly popularizing Sweden&#x27;s World War II history for domestic and foreign readers. In his books, and also in accounts by other authors, Hägglöf appears as an outspoken critic of the idealist policies of Foreign Minister Sandler and Activist advocates for Sweden&#x27;s military engagement for the defence of Finland after the Soviet attacks in 1939 (the Winter War) and 1941 (the Continuation War).

Although Hägglöf in policy matter was closer to left-leaning neutralist Social Democrats, led by Ernst Wigforss, he doesn&#x27;t spare retrospect criticism on that circle&#x27;s pro-Soviet sentiments, and particularly the policies of Foreign Minister Undén&#x27;s (1945–1962), that in Hägglöf&#x27;s view was based on an exaggeratedly rosy perception of the Soviet Union.

Contrary to many other writers on the subject, Hägglöf also makes a point of reminding readers of the Allies&#x27; disrespect for neutral countries during a war that they perceived as a fight of life and death; and how openly discussed plans for an Allied invasion of Scandinavia was a chief reason for Nazi Germany to launch a preventive invasion (Operation Weserübung) in April 1940.

Gunnar Hägglöf was in the service of the Swedish government for all of his life. However, without doubt, his most critical achievements were during World War II, when he and associated negotiators managed to gain the confidence of both German and British counterparts, which ensured the enclosed Sweden a considerably improved supply of food and other necessities than during World War I.

==History==
&quot;World&quot; was launched by Joel Belz in 1986 as a publication of &quot;The Presbyterian Journal&quot;, a theologically conservative magazine founded in 1942. However, due to low readership and financial difficulties, &quot;The Presbyterian Journal&quot; cancelled the publication that June. Belz convinced the board of &quot;The Presbyterian Journal&quot; to shut down operations and reallocate its resources to &quot;World&quot;, which relaunched in 1987. It started with about 5,000 subscribers and the publishers initially requested donations in every issue to stay afloat. At its peak, &quot;World&quot; had a circulation exceeding 160,000.

In 2005, Nick Eicher replaced Joel Belz as CEO and &quot;World&quot; considered moving its headquarters to a different city. In 2008, &quot;World&quot; switched from publishing weekly to biweekly. That same year Eicher was succeeded by Kevin Martin. In July 2011, &quot;World&quot; moved its office from Innsbruck Mall in Asheville to a former bank building at Biltmore Village.

&quot;World&quot; magazine received national media attention in 2009, when its then features editor Lynn Vincent was chosen to collaborate on former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Going Rogue: An American Life&quot;.

In 2012, &quot;World&quot; began referring to itself as &quot;World News Group&quot;, which includes its print, digital, and broadcast properties. In 2014, Nick Eicher became Chief Content Officer, responsible for all editorial content for the organization. WorldMag.com launched in September 2004 (the website switched to WNG.org in 2021).

In 2021, Marvin Olasky&#x27;s tenure as editor-in-chief of &quot;World Magazine&quot; ended, but he continued working with the magazine until 2022, and he planned to continue working with World Journalism Institute beyond that time.

In July 2024, &quot;World&quot; changed its magazine from printing biweekly to monthly. Three months later, in late September, &quot;World&quot;&#x27;s two office buildings in Biltmore Village were flooded by up to six feet of water from the Swannanoa River during Hurricane Helene.

==Editorial team==
World News Group&#x27;s editorial staff is led by co-chief content officers, Lynn Vincent (also the executive editor of &quot;World&quot;) and Nick Eicher. In addition, an editorial council provides direction for organization&#x27;s editorial efforts. The current members of the editorial council are Brian Basham (program director-World Watch), Paul Butler (executive producer-World Radio), Rebecca Cochrane (editorial director-God&#x27;s World News), Leigh Jones (Executive Editor-Feature), Tim Lamer (executive editor—commentary); Lynde Langdon (executive eitor—news), and Mickey McLean (executive editor-World Digital), along with the co-CCOs.

Unlike &quot;World&quot;&#x27;s business staff, which works almost entirely in Asheville, the majority of its editorial and production staff live elsewhere.

==Coverage of evangelical controversies==
&quot;World&quot; has received positive critical commentary from the &quot;New York Times&quot; regarding its investigative reporting on controversies within the evangelical Christian community.

In an August 29, 2009, cover story, &quot;World&quot; reported on the C Street Center in Washington, D.C., and the secretive organization behind it, the Fellowship, a.k.a. &quot;The Family&quot;. Scott Horton of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; praised the piece, saying the magazine&#x27;s &quot;attitude is critical and exacting. The piece looks like serious journalism, much like the publication&#x27;s exposé work on Ralph Reed and other scandals in the past.&quot; Rachel Maddow, on her August 17, 2009, show said, &quot;The article exposes The Family&#x27;s mysterious money trail and describes the C Street scandals using the word &#x27;scandal&#x27; and argues that The Family subscribes to a, quote, &#x27;muddy theology&#x27; and it harbors, quote, &#x27;a disdain for the established church.&#x27;&quot;

The magazine reported that Christian apologist and conservative political commentator Dinesh D&#x27;Souza had shared a hotel room with his fiancée prior to filing for divorce from his previous wife. After &quot;World&quot; broke the story, D&#x27;Souza resigned as president of New York&#x27;s The King&#x27;s College in response.

In December 2018, &quot;World&quot;″s investigative report on Harvest Bible Chapel and its pastor, James MacDonald, led to a shakeup at the suburban Chicago megachurch. The article written by freelance writer Julie Roys included detailed information on financial mismanagement and a culture of deception and intimidation at the church. On February 13, 2019, the elders of the church announced the firing of MacDonald.

==World Digital==
&quot;World&quot;″s digital properties are headed by Executive Editor Mickey McLean. The &quot;World&quot; website includes daily news stories, including daily news briefs called &quot;The Sift,&quot; weekly news roundups and editorial cartoons. &quot;World&#x27;s&quot; magazine content is also available through its apps for iOS, Android, and Amazon Kindle devices.

==World Radio==
On August 6, 2011, &quot;World&quot; launched a weekly two-hour radio news program called &quot;The World and Everything in It&quot;. Hosted by then-executive producer Nick Eicher and senior producer Joseph Slife, the program aired weekends on U.S. stations and featured reports, interviews, and analysis from the organization&#x27;s editorial team. In May 2013, &quot;The World and Everything in It&quot; became a 30-minute daily podcast. Slife left the program in May 2017 and was replaced as co-host by Mary Reichard.

<text>Pirate radio in the United Kingdom has been a popular and enduring radio medium since the 1960s, despite expansions in licensed broadcasting, and the advent of both digital radio and internet radio. Although it peaked throughout the 1960s and again during the 1980s/1990s, it remains in existence today. Having moved from transmitting from ships in the sea to tower blocks across UK towns and cities, in 2009 the UK broadcasting regulator Ofcom estimated more than 150 pirate radio stations were still operating.

==1960s==

Pirate radio in the UK first became widespread in the early 1960s when pop music stations such as Radio Caroline and Radio London started to broadcast on medium wave to the UK from offshore ships or disused sea forts. At the time, these stations were not illegal because they were broadcasting from international waters. The stations were set up by entrepreneurs and music enthusiasts to meet the growing demand for pop and rock music, which was not catered for by BBC Radio services.

The first British pirate radio station was Radio Caroline, which started broadcasting from a ship off the Essex coast in 1964. By 1967, ten pirate radio stations were broadcasting to an estimated daily audience of 10-15 million. Influential pirate radio DJs included John Peel, Tony Blackburn, Kenny Everett, Johnnie Walker, Tony Prince, Emperor Rosko, and Spangles Muldoon.

The format of this wave of pirate radio was influenced by Radio Luxembourg and American radio stations. Many followed a top-40 format with casual DJs, making UK pirate radio the antithesis of BBC radio at the time. Spurred on by the offshore stations, land-based pirate stations took to the air on medium wave at weekends, such as Radio Free London in 1968.

Radio Caroline&#x27;s audience was one third the size of the BBC Light Programme in the parts of the country where it could be received, but the Light Programme&#x27;s audience did not decrease, indicating that pirate radio appealed to an audience that the BBC did not serve.

In reaction to the popularity of pirate radio, BBC Radio was restructured in 1967, establishing BBC Radio 1, Radio 2, Radio 3 and Radio 4. A number of DJs of the newly formed Radio 1 came from pirate stations. The UK Government also closed the international waters loophole via the Marine, &amp;c., Broadcasting (Offences) Act 1967, although Radio Caroline would continue to broadcast in various forms right up to 1990.

== 1970s ==
The Marine, &amp;c., Broadcasting (Offences) Act 1967 officially outlawed offshore stations, but unlicensed radio continued, moving from ships and sea-based platforms to urban areas in the latter part of the 1960s (despite being already illegal under the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1949). During this period, home-made medium wave (and sometimes short wave) transmitters were often constructed inside cheap, expendable biscuit tins. The main method employed by most medium-wave or short-wave pirate stations during the 1970s involved programming played back on cassette recorders (often powered by a car battery), with a long wire antenna slung up between two trees.

The 1970s and 1980s saw a wave of land-based pirate radio, broadcasting mostly in larger towns and cities, transmitting from flats and tower blocks. These included community-focused local stations as well as stations emerging for the first time to specialise in particular music genres. One of the earliest was Radio Jackie originally broadcasting in south west London.

Soul music stations would start to appear in the 1970s. The first of these was Radio Invicta, regarded as Europe&#x27;s first soul music station first broadcasting in 1970. The station would launch the careers of Pete Tong, Gilles Peterson and a number of the shows were presented by what was then known as the &quot;Soul Mafia&quot; - DJs such as Chris Hill and Froggy.

== 1980s ==
Entering the 1980s, transmitters capable of FM broadcasting were beginning to be picked up reasonably cheaply, with the ability to transmit over a forty-mile radius from a 15-storey tower. Engineers such as Pyers Easton would build them for stations such as London Greek Radio and Kiss FM.

In London, a notable moment would be the launching of Britain&#x27;s first black owned music station Dread Broadcasting Corporation (DBC) in 1980. DBC played reggae and soca as well as other black music and would be instrumental to the later development of black community broadcasting as well as launching the career of BBC presenter Ranking Miss P.

Soul stations would become prolific in the early-mid 1980s, with Invicta joined by Horizon Radio, and JFM in 1981. Both of these would broadcast until 1985 when they were followed by Solar Radio and Starpoint. London Weekend Radio (LWR) would start life in 1983 playing contemporary pop music during the day with more specialist shows in the evenings and weekends; however, having briefly closed down, management of the station was handed to club promoter Zak Dee and in 1984, LWR rose again as a dedicated soul, hip hop, jazz-funk, and reggae station, launching the career of Tim Westwood. LWR&#x27;s biggest rival would arrive in the form of Kiss FM, first broadcasting in late 1985. The station was formed by George Power who had previously run another pirate station, London Greek Radio, along with DJs Gordon Mac and Tosca Jackson. By 1988, Kiss would boast a line-up of top DJs including Norman Jay, Jazzie B (of Soul II Soul), Colin Faver, Trevor Nelson, Judge Jules, Danny Rampling, Paul Trouble Anderson, and Coldcut, playing soul, jazz-funk, reggae, hip hop and the emerging sounds of house music. A 1987 Evening Standard readers&#x27; poll placed Kiss in second place behind Capital Radio and ahead of Radio 1.

Around the UK, the West Midlands and Birmingham would see a large number of stations forming including the likes of Peoples Community Radio Link (PCRL) which started in 1985, and Sunshine Radio. Although launching in very late 1979, Merseyland Alternative Radio broadcast from the Wirral in the early 1980s, showcasing many bands from the Merseyside area.

Despite being better catered for by legal radio, there was still space for stations playing alternative rock and indie music which was struggling to get mainstream airplay. In London, stations such as RFM (Rock FM) and London Rock, and in Manchester KFM Radio would spring up to cater for those music genres during the mid-late 1980s. In 1989, a London pirate radio station Q102 would become a short-lived but hugely influential station in the breaking of early 1990s indie and Britpop bands. This station would be the roots of the later legal XFM.

Pirate radio met with increasing opposition, especially from the authorities in the form of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). It had claimed since the 1970s that pirate radio caused interference to licensed broadcasters and could interfere with frequencies used by emergency services. Nonetheless, the growth of pirate radio in the 1980s was so rapid that at one point pirate radio operators outnumbered legal broadcasters and in popularity.

Twice in the mid-late 1980s, the UK Government had floated plans to tackle pirate radio by offering new licenses, particularly in London. In 1989, new licenses were advertised but stations would have to commit to closing down voluntarily and come off-air as part of bidding for them. London&#x27;s Kiss FM was one of those that duly did so, yet despite strong backing and support, would lose out to Jazz FM. However, further licenses were advertised subsequently and Kiss would win one on its second attempt and become the UK&#x27;s first legal radio station specialising in black and dance music in September 1990.

However, even as this unfolded, a new wave of pirate radio stations emerged as the acid house scene exploded. Particularly in London, stations such as Sunrise, Fantasy, Friends FM, and Centreforce became the &quot;seven day rave stations&quot;.

==1990s==
The Broadcasting Act 1990 led to the brief decline of UK pirate radio by encouraging diversity in radio and developing commercial radio, whilst bringing in tougher penalties for those caught in unlicensed broadcasting. The number of unlicensed broadcasters soon began to rise again, partly out of the belief that the Act had undermined community radio and small broadcasters. As stations such as Kiss would increasingly discover that advertising revenue and market share became as important as the music it played, new pirate stations once again sprang up to cater for underground music scenes that were developing. The biggest of these would be the rising rave music scene, with stations moving to a &quot;rave on the air&quot; format with back to back mixing and listener participation through &#x27;shouts&#x27; - enabled by the growth of pagers and mobile phones. In London, such stations included the likes of Rush, Kool FM, Pulse FM, Innocence, Don FM, and Defection.
The authorities and media alleged an organised crime and drugs link with the rave stations, culminating in a high-profile raid in Hackney in the summer of 1993 on Rush. The &quot;Evening Standard&quot; headline exclaimed &quot;Drug gangs set up fortresses.&quot; Harsher laws imposed more severe fines on DJs and businesses that advertised on stations. The Rush raid was featured in the seminal BBC Two documentary &quot;Pirates&quot;, shown as part of the &quot;Arena&quot; series in December 1993.

For those ill-served by mainstream and legal radio, pirate radio filled the void, especially for the black community. In London, stations as Galaxy Radio, Genesis, Station, and Vibes have mixed black music with phone-ins and cultural programmes, &quot;We are trying to bring a balance into the community - to introduce culture and history and to inform people&quot; as one of those involved in Galaxy. These stations still broadcast today.

Outside London the picture was similar, with notable pirate radio stations including PCRL, Frontline, and Sting in Birmingham; The Superstation, Buzz FM and Soul Nation in Manchester; Dance FM, Fantasy FM, and SCR in Sheffield; Passion Radio, Ragga FM, For the People in Bristol; Fresh FM in Leicester; Z100 in Liverpool, and Dream FM in Leeds.

By the mid to late 1990s, genres such as happy hardcore, jungle/drum&#x27;n&#x27;bass and speed/UK garage saw a new generation of pirate radio stations emerge. In London, Kool FM was joined by Rinse FM, Rude, Flex FM, Eruption FM, and Dream FM in championing jungle music/drum&#x27;n&#x27;bass, and the latter also happy hardcore. Speed/UK garage was being pushed by stations such as London Underground (notably the Dreem Teem), Freek FM (notably DJ EZ), Shine FM, and Girls FM. Flex FM and Rinse FM (legal now) would make a transition from jungle to UK garage during the course of the 1990s.

== 2000s ==

As pirate radio persisted into the 2000s, UK broadcasting regulator Ofcom undertook research into its popularity and published its findings in 2007. This estimated that, &quot;there are currently around 150 illegal radio stations in the UK. At any one time, it is believed that around half of these are transmitting in London, within the M25 area&quot;. It found that: &quot;a large proportion of these are operating in London, with notable clusters in Harlesden, Stoke Newington, Southwark and Lambeth&quot;.

It also commissioned research among residents of the London boroughs of Hackney, Haringey and Lambeth, finding that &quot;about 24 percent of all adults aged 14 or older living within the three London boroughs listen to pirate radio stations. The research found that 37 percent of students aged 14–24 and 41 percent of the African-Caribbean community listened to pirate radio&quot;. The development and promotion of grass-roots talent, the urban music scene and minority community groups were important for pirate radio. According to the research, pirate radio listeners and those running pirate radio stations thought that licensed broadcasters failed to cater sufficiently for the needs of the public. Pirate radio was regarded as the best place to hear new music and particularly urban music. Pirate radio stations were appreciated for their local relevance by providing information and advertisements about local community events, businesses and club nights.

An operation by Ofcom to take unlicensed operators off-air in late 2005 revealed that London&#x27;s airwaves were still very active, including long established stations such as Kool FM, Point Blank, Bassline, Lightning FM, Y2K FM, Deja Vu, and Rinse FM. The latter two were instrumental in the development of underground grime and dubstep music scenes. The authorities continued to assert the risk of interference to emergency services by stations.

== 2010s to present ==
Ofcom responded to a Freedom of Information request in July 2015, that revealed they had raided and seized almost 400 pirate radio set-ups in London in just a two-year period.

==Community radio==
Since 2010, Ofcom have promoted the take-up of Community Radio, especially in areas such as London with a concentration of pirate radio stations. As such, a number of former pirate radio stations have made the transition to legal broadcasting through community radio licences, such as Rinse FM, Kane FM, and most recently Flex FM. However, some remain sceptical of the ability of the local community and pirate broadcasters to make the move to legal status.

==Political pirate radio==
Although UK pirate radio has in the main concentrated on broadcasting music not catered for by the mainstream, there has been some overt political pirate radio. The earliest of these was Radio Free Scotland, which hijacked the sound channels of BBC television after closedown. Similarly, Voice of Nuclear Disarmament would do the same for a short period in the early 1960s in London. In the 1970s, Radio Enoch, named after Enoch Powell, was set up by people on the right wing of the Conservative and Unionist Party to help re-elect a conservative government. Although Radio Enoch had vowed to return if a Labour administration was re-elected, it failed to do so after Tony Blair was elected in 1997. In 1982, Our Radio was broadcasting music, anarchism, and other left wing views to London. Our Radio once evaded arrest by setting up a dummy antenna for the Home Office to find. During the 1984–1985 miners&#x27; strike, Radio Arthur operated in the Nottinghamshire area. More recently, Interference FM was set up by a collective to broadcast during the Carnival Against Capitalism demonstration on 18 June 1999.

Political programming has been a feature of the many black community pirate radio stations that have grown in the UK since the 1980s. For the likes of Galaxy Radio, part of their mission is to: &quot;de-brainwash the black community&quot;. The station combines reggae and soca with robust articulation of &quot;black empowerment against a system designed our oppress our brothers and sisters&quot; and live phone-in discussions. Genesis Radio, launched in the early 1990s, follows a similar format. Duwayne Brooks, councillor and friend of Stephen Lawrence who was murdered in a racist attack in 1993, has in the past urged police to work with community stations such as Genesis in order to improve &quot;police engagement with the community&quot; and &quot;run our own appeals for information after incidents&quot;. Where black community stations have also been effective is to raise awareness and raise funds for local concerns, often where mainstream media has overlooked them. In 2002, Powerjam launched an appeal through one of its talk shows to raise money to save a young girl from a rare tissue disease.

==Internet and pirate radio==
The advent of the Internet has brought both opportunities and challenges for pirate radio. In the early days, the internet became another communication means in which to advertise and promote stations, with station listings, frequencies, and information starting to be posted. Some stations decided to embrace the Web and early radio streaming technologies as a means of ceasing illegal broadcasting - the most notable and pioneering of these was the former London pirate Face FM that re-invented itself as the internet station InterFACE. For those that had no intention of coming off the air, the internet provided a way to expand their promotion and audience reach by establishing websites and enable them to begin to stream live beyond their usual broadcast area. For the now legal Rinse FM, their website not only streamed shows live but it would also provide them a platform to develop their identity and to promote their events whilst still unlicensed.
By the 2010s, this landscape was changing with increasing use of social media and music streaming services, with research by RAJAR reporting that: &quot;Although 90% of people still listen to the radio each week, the proportion listening to FM and AM stations has fallen from 68% in 2010 to 58% in March.&quot;

For some, the Internet still does not replace the need for pirate radio: &quot;Pirate will never stop; it’s cyclical. If you push people hard enough, they’ll find a mode of expression. The internet has been pretty cool for that, but it’s not the be-all-and-end-all&quot;, whilst others argue that for music like grime, pirate radio continues to be &quot;such an essential platform for emerging voices&quot;. For former pirates such as Kool London, Internet radio has given them a new lease of life.

== Legal situation ==
The Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006 provides for Ofcom to issue licences to radio broadcasters for the use of stations and wireless telegraphy apparatus. The Act sets out a number of criminal offences relating to wireless telegraphy, including the establishment or use of a wireless telegraphy station or apparatus for the purpose of making an unlicensed broadcast. The financing or participating in the day-to-day running of unlicensed broadcasting is also a criminal offence, as is the supplying of a sound recording for an unlicensed station and advertising through unlicensed stations. The act allows Ofcom to take a number of actions against individuals committing these offences, including power of entry and search and seizure of equipment. It is a criminal offence to obstruct a person exercising enforcement powers on Ofcom&#x27;s behalf. Furthermore, the Broadcasting Act 1990 provides that anyone convicted of an unlawful broadcasting offence is disqualified from holding a broadcasting licence for five years.

Anti-social behaviour orders (ASBO) have also been used in the fight against pirate radio.
