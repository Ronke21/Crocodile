<text>The names of commissioned ships of the United States Navy all start with USS, for United States Ship. Non-commissioned, primarily civilian-crewed vessels of the U.S. Navy under the Military Sealift Command have names that begin with USNS, standing for United States Naval Ship. A letter-based hull classification symbol is used to designate a vessel&#x27;s type. The names of ships are selected by the Secretary of the Navy. The names are those of states, cities, towns, important persons, important locations, famous battles, fish, and ideals. Usually, different types of ships have names originated from different types of sources.

Modern aircraft carriers and submarines use nuclear reactors for power. See United States naval reactors for information on classification schemes and the history of nuclear-powered vessels.

Modern cruisers, destroyers and frigates are called surface combatants and act mainly as escorts for aircraft carriers, amphibious assault ships, auxiliaries and civilian craft, but the largest ones have gained a land attack role through the use of cruise missiles and a population defense role through missile defense.

==Aircraft carriers==

Aircraft carriers (CVN) have the ability to put most nations within striking distance of U.S. air power which makes them the cornerstone of US forward deployment and deterrence strategy. Multiple carriers are deployed around the world to provide military presence, respond quickly to crises, and participate in joint exercises with allied forces; this has led the Navy to refer to their &quot;Nimitz&quot;-class carriers as &quot;4.5 acres of sovereign and mobile American territory&quot;. &quot;In accordance with customary international law as reflected in United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and as discussed in &quot;The Commander&#x27;s Handbook on the Law of Naval Operations&quot; and The State Department Cable on the Status of Military Sealift Command Vessels, ships owned or operated by a State and used, for the time being, only on government non-commercial service are entitled to sovereign immunity. Whether in internal, territorial, or international waters, such ships are immune from arrest and search, and exempt from foreign taxation and any foreign regulation requiring flying the flag of that foreign state while in its ports or territorial sea.&quot; Former President Bill Clinton summed up the importance of the aircraft carrier by stating that &quot;when word of crisis breaks out in Washington, it&#x27;s no accident the first question that comes to everyone&#x27;s lips is: where is the nearest carrier?&quot; The power and operational flexibility of a carrier lie in the aircraft of its carrier air wing. Made up of both fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft, a carrier air wing is able to perform over 150 strike missions at once, hitting over 700 targets a day. Carrier air wings also protect friendly forces, conduct electronic warfare, assist in special operations, and carry out search and rescue missions. The carriers themselves, in addition to enabling airborne operations, serve as command platforms for large battle groups or multinational task forces. U.S. Navy aircraft carriers can also host aircraft from other nations&#x27; navies; the French Navy&#x27;s Rafale has operated, during naval exercises, from U.S. Navy flight decks.

==Amphibious warfare ships==

===Amphibious assault ships===

Amphibious assault ships, sub-types known as landing, helicopter dock or LHD and landing, helicopter assault or LHA. (also referred to as a commando carrier or an amphibious assault carrier), are a type of amphibious warfare ship employed to land and support ground forces on enemy territory by an amphibious assault. The design evolved from aircraft carriers converted for use as helicopter carriers, but includes support for amphibious landing craft, with most designs including a well deck. Coming full circle, some amphibious assault ships now have a secondary role as aircraft carriers, supporting V/STOL fixed-wing aircraft.

The role of the amphibious assault ship is fundamentally different from a standard aircraft carrier: its aviation facilities have the primary role of hosting helicopters to support forces ashore rather than to support strike aircraft. However, some are capable of serving in the sea-control role, embarking aircraft like Harrier fighters for CAP and anti-submarine warfare helicopters or operating as a safe base for large numbers of STOVL fighters conducting air support for the Marine expeditionary unit once it has gone ashore. Most of these ships can also carry or support landing craft, such as air-cushioned landing craft (hovercraft) or LCUs.

* (2 in active service of 11 planned)
===Amphibious command ships===

Amphibious command ships (LCC) of the United States Navy are large, special purpose ships, originally designed to command large amphibious invasions. However, as amphibious invasions have become less likely, they are now used as general command ships, and serve as floating headquarters for two, forward deployed, numbered Fleet commands. Currently, they are assigned to the 6th and 7th fleets as flagships.

* (2 in active service)
===Amphibious transport docks===

Amphibious transport docks, also known as landing platform dock or LPD, is an amphibious warfare ship, a warship that embarks, transports, and lands elements of a landing force for expeditionary warfare missions. Several navies currently operate this kind of ship. The ships are generally designed to transport troops into a war zone by sea, primarily using landing craft, although invariably they also have the capability to operate transport, utility and attack helicopters and multi-mission tilt-rotor aircraft.

* (12 in active service of 17 planned)
===Dock landing ships===

Dock landing ships, also known as landing ship, dock or LSD, are amphibious warfare ships with well docks to transport and launch landing craft and amphibious vehicles. Some ships with well decks, such as the Soviet Ivan Rogov class, also have bow doors to enable them to deliver vehicles directly onto a beach (like a Landing Ship, Tank). Modern dock landing ships also operate helicopters.

A ship with a well deck (docking well) can transfer cargo to landing craft in rougher seas than a ship that has to use cranes or a stern ramp. The US Navy hull classification symbol for a ship with a well deck depends on its facilities for aircraft - a (modern) LSD has a helicopter deck, a LPD also has a hangar, and a LHD or LHA has a full-length flight deck.

* (4 in active service)
===Expeditionary mobile base===

Expeditionary mobile bases are semi-submersible, flexible, modular platforms providing that perform large-scale logistics movements such as the transfer of vehicles and equipment from sea to shore. These ships significantly reduce the dependency on foreign ports and provide support in the absence of port availability.
* (4 in active service of 6 planned)

==Cruisers==

Cruisers and Guided missile cruisers (CG) are a type of warship. The term has been in use for several hundred years, and has had different meanings throughout this period. During the Age of Sail, the term &quot;cruising&quot; referred to certain kinds of missions – independent scouting, raiding or commerce protection – fulfilled by a frigate or sloop, which were the &quot;cruising warships&quot; of a fleet.

In the middle of the 19th century, &quot;cruiser&quot; came to be a classification for the ships intended for this kind of role, though cruisers came in a wide variety of sizes, from the small protected cruiser to armored cruisers that were as large (although not as powerful) as a battleship.

By the early 20th century, cruisers could be placed on a consistent scale of warship size, smaller than a battleship but larger than a destroyer. In 1922, the Washington Naval Treaty placed a formal limit on cruisers, which were defined as warships of up to 10,000 tons displacement carrying guns no larger than 8 inches in calibre. These limits shaped cruisers until the end of World War II. The very large battlecruisers of the World War I era were now classified, along with battleships, as capital ships.

In the later 20th century, the obsolescence of the battleship left the cruiser as the largest and most powerful surface combatant (excluding aircraft carriers). The role of the cruiser varied according to ship and navy, often including air defense, commerce raiding, and shore bombardment. The U.S. Navy in the Cold War period built guided-missile cruisers primarily designed to provide air defense, while the navy of the USSR built battlecruisers with heavy anti-ship missiles designed to sink NATO carrier task forces.

* (27 completed; 13 in active service, 14 retired) – the first ship class with the AEGIS combat system
==Destroyers==
Destroyers DDG are fast maneuverable long-endurance warships intended to escort larger vessels in a fleet, convoy or battle group and defend them against smaller powerful short-range attackers. They were originally developed in the late 19th century as a defense against torpedo boats, and by the time of the Russo-Japanese War in 1904, these &quot;torpedo boat destroyers&quot; (TBD) were &quot;large, swift, and powerfully armed torpedo boats designed to destroy other torpedo boats.&quot;

Before World War II, destroyers were light vessels with little endurance for unattended ocean operations; typically a number of destroyers and a single destroyer tender operated together. After the war, the advent of the guided missile allowed destroyers to take on the surface combatant roles previously filled by battleships and cruisers. This resulted in larger and more powerful guided missile destroyers more capable of independent operation.

At the start of the 21st century, destroyers are the heaviest surface combatant ships in general use, with only two nations (United States and Russia) currently operating the heavier class cruisers, with no battleships or true battlecruisers remaining. Modern destroyers, also known as guided missile destroyers, are equivalent in tonnage but vastly superior in firepower to cruisers of the World War II era, capable of carrying nuclear tipped cruise missiles. Guided missile destroyers such as the &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; class are actually larger and more heavily armed than most previous ships classified as guided missile cruisers, due to their massive size at long, displacement (8200-9700 tons) and armament of over 90 missiles.

Guided-missile destroyers are destroyers designed to launch guided missiles. Many are also equipped to carry out anti-submarine, anti-air, and anti-surface operations. The NATO standard designation for these vessels is DDG. Nations vary in their use of destroyer D designation their hull pennant numbering, either prefixing, or dropping it altogether. The U.S. Navy has adopted the classification DDG in the American hull classification system.

In addition to the guns that destroyers have, a guided-missile destroyer is usually equipped with two large missile magazines, usually in vertical-launch cells. Some guided-missile destroyers contain powerful radar systems, such as the United States’ Aegis Combat System, and may be adopted for use in an anti-missile or ballistic-missile defense role. This is especially true of navies that no longer operate cruisers, as other vessels must be adopted to fill in the gap.

* (2 in active service, 1 under sea trials)
==Frigates==
Frigates FF or FFG (according to the modern classification of U.S. navy warships) are smaller ships than destroyers. They are designed primarily to protect other ships (such as merchant convoys), and perform some Anti-Submarine Warfare duties. They are cheaper but of more limited capability than destroyers. The last active class of frigates in the US Navy was the , decommissioned in September 2015, leaving the navy no active frigates.

On 15 January 2015, U.S. Navy Secretary Ray Mabus announced that ships of the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) classes built in the future would be re-classified as &quot;frigates&quot;. This would apply only to the future variations of these ships. Current ships will retain the LCS classification unless and until they are upgraded to the standards of the newer ships.

On 30 April 2020, the US Navy awarded a contract to design and produce the next generation small surface combatant, the Guided Missile Frigate (FFG(X)). The contract for detail design and construction (DD&amp;C) of up to 10 Guided Missile Frigates (consisting of one base ship and nine option ships) was awarded to Fincantieri Marinette Marine Corporation (MMC) of Marinette, Wisconsin. The FFG(X) will have multi-mission capability to conduct air warfare, anti-submarine warfare, surface warfare, electronic warfare, and information operations. Specifically FFG(X) will include an Enterprise Air Surveillance Radar (EASR) radar, Baseline Ten (BL10) AEGIS Combat System, a Mk 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS), communications systems, MK 57 Gun Weapon System (GWS) countermeasures and added capability in the EW/IO area with design flexibility for future growth.

* &quot;Constellation&quot; class (4 on order, 20 planned)
==Littoral combat ships==


Littoral combat ships LCS are a class of relatively small surface vessels intended for operations in the littoral zone (close to shore) by the United States Navy. It was &quot;envisioned to be a networked, agile, stealthy surface combatant capable of defeating anti-access and asymmetric threats in the littorals.&quot;

The and the are the first two LCS variants. Both are slightly smaller than the U.S. Navy&#x27;s guided missile frigates and have been likened to corvettes. They have the capabilities of a small assault transport, including a flight deck and hangar for housing two SH-60 or MH-60 Seahawk helicopters, a stern ramp for operating small boats, and the cargo volume and payload to deliver a small assault force with fighting vehicles to a roll-on/roll-off port facility. Standard armaments include Mk 110 57 mm guns and RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missiles. They are also equipped with autonomous air, surface, and underwater vehicles. Possessing lower air defense and surface warfare capabilities than destroyers, the LCS concept emphasizes speed, flexible mission modules and a shallow draft.

The first littoral combat ship, , was commissioned on 8 November 2008 in Veteran&#x27;s Park, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The second ship, and first of the trimaran design, , was commissioned on 16 January 2010, in Mobile, Alabama. In 2012, CNO Jonathan W. Greenert stated that LCSs would be deployed to Africa in place of destroyers and cruisers. In late 2014, the Navy proceeded with a procurement plan for enhanced versions of the LCS and upgraded older ships to meet the program&#x27;s 52-ship requirement; the modified LCS will be redesignated as FF. In December 2015, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter ordered the Navy to reduce the planned LCS/FF procurement from 52 to 40, and downselect to one variant by FY 2019.

It was announced in January 2015 that future and retrofitted versions of these two classes will be re-classified as frigates. The navy has currently built and/or planned out to 24 of a total of 52 ships.

==Mine countermeasures ships==
Mine countermeasures vessels or MCM are a type of naval ship designed for the location of and destruction of naval mines which combines the role of a minesweeper and minehunter in one hull. The term MCMV is also applied collectively to minehunters and minesweepers.

A &quot;minesweeper&quot; is a small naval warship designed to engage in minesweeping. Using various mechanisms intended to counter the threat posed by naval mines, waterways are maintained clear for safe shipping.

A &quot;minehunter&quot; is a naval vessel that actively detects and destroys individual naval mines.

* (8 of 14 in active service, 5 decommissioned, 1 lost to accident)
==Patrol ships==
Patrol ships PC are relatively small naval vessels generally designed for coastal defense duties. There have been many designs for patrol boats. They may be operated by a nation&#x27;s navy, coast guard, police force or customs and may be intended for marine (blue water) and/or estuarine or river (&quot;brown water&quot;) environments. They are commonly found engaged in various border protection roles, including anti-smuggling, anti-piracy, fisheries patrols, and immigration law enforcement. They are also often called upon to participate in rescue operations. Vessels of this type include the original yacht (from Dutch/Low German &quot;jacht&quot; meaning hunting or hunt), a light, fast-sailing vessel used by the Dutch navy to pursue pirates and other transgressors around and into shallow waters.

* (14 built, none in active service, all transferred to the Philippine Navy or other navies)
==Submarines==

Submarines SSN, SSBN, SSGN are watercraft capable of independent operation underwater. There are currently two types; attack and ballistic. &quot;Attack submarines&quot; (SSN) have tactical missions, including controlling naval and shipping activity, serving as cruise missile-launching platforms, and intelligence-gathering. &quot;Ballistic submarines&quot; (SSBN) primarily have the single strategic mission of nuclear deterrence by being hidden launching-platforms for nuclear SLBMs. However, some of these boats have been converted to (SSGN) and launch standard cruise missiles.

* (attack submarines: 28 in active service, 34 retired of 62 built)
* (attack submarines: 3 in active service of 3 planned)
* (attack submarines: 21 in active service of 48 planned)
* (ballistic missile submarines: 14 in active service of 24 planned)
**(&quot;Ohio&quot; class converted to guided missile submarines: 4 in active service)
==Future requirements==
In a 2012 study called the &quot;Force Structure Assessment&quot;, the Navy determined a post-2020 battle-force requirement of 306 ships.
* 12 fleet ballistic missile submarines
* 11 nuclear-powered aircraft carriers
* 48 nuclear-powered attack submarines
* 0-4 nuclear-powered cruise missile submarines
* 88 large, multi-mission, surface combatants
* 52 small, multi-role, surface combatants
* 33 amphibious landing ships
* 29 combat logistics force ships
* 33 support vessels

==Historically significant vessels==
The U.S. Navy has operated a number of vessels important to both United States and world naval history:
* , nicknamed &quot;Old Ironsides&quot;, is the only surviving vessel of the original six frigates authorized by Congress in the Naval Act of 1794, which established the United States Navy. It served with distinction in the War of 1812, singlehandedly defeating a number of powerful enemy warships, and is currently docked in Charlestown, Massachusetts, as the oldest commissioned warship &quot;afloat&quot;.
* was involved in the Battle of Flamborough Head on 23 September 1779, one of the most celebrated naval actions of the American War of Independence. This battle is famous in part for &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot;″s commander John Paul Jones, when called upon to surrender his sinking ship by the captain of the more heavily armed British frigate by replying, &quot;Sir, I have not yet begun to fight!&quot;, before defeating and capturing the Serapis.
* was a 36-gun sailing frigate that ran aground and was captured intact in Tripoli Harbor by Barbary corsairs during the First Barbary War. On the night of 16 February 1804, four months after the ship was turned against American ships, Lieutenant Stephen Decatur led a small detachment of U.S. Marines aboard a captured Tripolitan ketch close enough to board her. Decatur&#x27;s men stormed the ship, overpowered the Tripolitan sailors, and set fire to &quot;Philadelphia&quot;. British Admiral Horatio Nelson is said to have called this &quot;the most bold and daring act of the age.&quot;
* was Commodore Matthew Perry&#x27;s flagship when the threat of force by his fleet brought about the signing of the Convention of Kanagawa in 1854. This treaty played a leading role in the opening of Japan to the West and the creation of the Open Door Policy.
* &#x27; and &#x27; are together known for participating in the first engagement between two steam-powered ironclads, known as the Battle of Hampton Roads, on 9 March 1862. &quot;Monitor&quot; was the first ironclad built by the U.S. Navy and its design introduced the rotating gun turret to naval warfare.
* was the first submarine built by the U.S. Navy. The submarine sank in 1863 while being towed during a storm and never saw combat. Though not a U.S. Navy vessel, the Confederate (from the same war and era) was the first successful combat submarine.
* &#x27; and &#x27; fought a celebrated a single-ship action known as the Battle of Cherbourg (1864) during the American Civil War on 19 June 1864, off Cherbourg, France.
* In January 1898, &quot;Maine&quot; was sent from Key West, Florida, to Havana, Cuba, to protect U.S. interests during a time of local insurrection and civil disturbances. Three weeks later, on 15 February at 9:40 p.m., an explosion on board the Maine occurred in the Havana Harbor. The explosion was a precipitating cause of the Spanish–American War that began in April 1898.
* is a protected cruiser that became famous as the flagship of Commodore George Dewey at the victorious Battle of Manila Bay during the Spanish–American War in 1898, which lead directly to the United States annexing the Philippines from 1899 to 1946. &quot;Olympia&quot; has been preserved as a museum ship to the present day.
* was the first submarine commissioned in the U.S. Navy.
* was the lead ship of her class of six battleships. She served as flagship the Great White Fleet, the popular nickname for the U.S. Navy battle fleet that completed a circumnavigation of the globe from 16 December 1907 to 22 February 1909. This dramatic show of force was presented by order of U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt to demonstrate to the rest of the world America&#x27;s military power and blue-water navy capability.
* was the lead ship of her class, and, when commissioned in 1910, was the first American modern &quot;dreadnought&quot; battleship, a type of battleship armed with eight or more major caliber guns, pioneered by the British Royal Navy, which made all previous battleships obsolete.
* is notable for being the first US battleship to become a permanent museum ship, the first battleship declared to be a US National Historic Landmark, the only remaining World War I–era dreadnought battleship, and the only remaining capital ship to have served in both World Wars.
* was the United States Navy&#x27;s first aircraft carrier, converted in 1920 from the collier USS &quot;Jupiter&quot;. She was also the U.S. Navy&#x27;s first electrically propelled ship.
* was a river gunboat that was sunk by Japanese aircraft on 12 December 1937 while she was anchored in the Yangtze River outside Nanking (now known as Nanjing), China. Japan and the United States were not at war at the time. The Japanese claimed that they did not see the American flags painted on the deck of the gunboat, apologized, and paid an indemnity. Nevertheless, the attack, and the subsequent Allison incident in Nanking, caused U.S. opinion to turn against the Japanese.
* was commissioned on 2 June 1941 as the first of 122 escort carriers built by United States shipyards during World War II. Escort carriers were typically smaller, shorter, slower, cheaper, and more quickly built than fleet carriers, and also carried fewer planes. They however made huge contributions to winning the war through escorting convoys, providing air support to ground troops, transporting aircraft, and forming the core of hunter-killer groups which sought out and sank enemy submarines.
* was a was torpedoed and sunk by a German submarine in a case of mistaken identity, during the period of neutrality five weeks before the attack on Pearl Harbor entered the United States into World War II. Many consider it the first United States Navy ship sunk by hostile action in the European theater of World War II. The ship&#x27;s sinking provoked a furious outburst in the United States, especially when Germany refused to apologize, instead countering that the destroyer was operating in what Germany considered to be a war zone and had suffered the consequences
* was a , best known for her cataclysmic and dramatic sinking, with the loss of 1,177 lives, during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, the event that brought about U.S. involvement in World War II. The USS &quot;Arizona&quot; Memorial is constructed over the shattered hull, which still contains the remains of most of the crew. It is commonly—but incorrectly—believed that &quot;Arizona&quot; remains perpetually in commission, likely because naval vessels entering Pearl Harbor render honors to the remains of the vessel.
* , a which primarily served during World War I and was notable for being sunk in the attack on Pearl Harbor. She was used to test various remote control equipment before being turned into a target ship for training Navy dive bombers. Supposedly mistaken by the Japanese for an active ship, she was sunk and attempts to right and refloat her failed. Alongside USS &quot;Arizona&quot;, she is the only other ship to remain in Pearl Harbor in the aftermath of the attack. She is also the state ship of Utah.
* , a , was the most engaged and decorated U.S. warship in World War II, involved in five of the six major carrier-versus-carrier battles of the Pacific Theater, as well as a host of minor engagements, and earning 20 of 22 possible battle stars. She was the only ship outside the British Royal Navy to earn the Admiralty Pennant, the highest award of the British, in the more than 400 years since its creation.
* , a , was best known for launching the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo on 18 April 1942, as well as participating in the pivotal victory at the Battle of Midway.
* was the lead ship of her highly successful class of submarine, which, along with the closely related and , eventually totaled 213 ships. These modern submarines were responsible for most of the destruction 55% of Japan&#x27;s merchant marine that came about from American submarine attack during World War II. The war against shipping was the single most decisive factor in the collapse of the Japanese economy during the war. The &quot;Gato&quot;, &quot;Balao&quot;, and &quot;Tench&quot; classes also remained the backbone of American underwater fleet well past the ending of the war.
* was an light cruiser torpedoed and sunk by Japanese submarine at the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal 13 November 1942. A total 687 men, including, infamously, all five of the Sullivan brothers from Waterloo, Iowa, were killed in action as a result of its sinking.
* was the only US battleship to sink an enemy battleship in direct combat, when she sank the in the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, 13 November 1942.
* was an aircraft carrier and the lead ship of the twenty four-ship . The &quot;Essex&quot; class was the 20th century&#x27;s most numerous class of capital ships, was the backbone of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s combat strength during World War II from mid-1943 on, and (along with the addition of the three carriers just after the war) continued to be the heart of U.S. Naval strength until the 1960s and 1970s.
* was a that sank six Japanese submarines in twelve days during May 1944, a feat unparalleled in the history of antisubmarine warfare.
* was a best known for torpedoing and sinking the 72,000-ton Japanese aircraft carrier , the largest warship ever sunk by a submarine, in November 1944.
* , a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine that performed the amazing feat of sinking three Japanese submarines in a 76-hour period, in February 1945 during World War II.
* , a , delivered components of Little Boy, the first nuclear weapon used in combat, to the US Air Army Air Force base on Tinian island. Upon completion of this secret mission, it was sunk on 30 July 1945 by the Imperial Japanese Navy, leading to the worst loss of life at sea in U.S. Navy history. Approximately 300 sailors of the listed crew of 1,196 died in the attack itself, but of the 880 who survived after, only 316 men lived to be rescued. The men survived four days after suffering from a lack of food, dehydration, exposure, and shark attacks (as referenced in the movie &quot;Jaws&quot;).
* , an , was the site of the surrender of the Empire of Japan which ended World War II. She was also the last battleship built by the United States. In 1955, she was decommissioned and assigned to the inactive reserve fleet (the &quot;Mothball Fleet&quot;), but reactivated and modernized in 1984 as part of the 600-ship Navy plan, and fought in the 1991 Gulf War. Decommissioned in 1995, she was the last actively serving battleship in the world. She was donated to the USS Missouri Memorial Association in 1998 and became a museum ship at Pearl Harbor, moored facing USS &quot;Arizona&quot;.
* , a submarine commissioned in 1954, was the world&#x27;s first nuclear-powered ship. It demonstrated its capabilities by traveling , more than half of which was submerged, in two years before having to refuel while breaking the record for longest submerged voyage, as well as being the first submarine to transit submerged under the North Pole in 1958.
* , a nuclear-powered submarine commissioned in 1957, was the first ship to physically reach the North Pole when she surfaced there in 1958.
* , a nuclear-powered submarine commissioned in 1959, made the first submerged circumnavigation of the world during its shakedown cruise in 1960, as well as being the only non-Soviet submarine to be powered by two nuclear reactors.
* , the lead ship of her class of nuclear-powered attack submarines and was lost by accident on 10 April 1963.
* , commissioned in 1959, was the first ever ballistic missile submarine.
* was the first nuclear-powered &quot;surface&quot; warship in the world when she was commissioned in 1961 and signalled a new era of United States naval weaponry by being the first large ship in the Navy to have guided missiles as its main battery.
* was the world&#x27;s first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier when she was commissioned in 1961.
* was an that was involved in a skirmish with North Vietnamese torpedo boats on 2 August 1964, known as the Gulf of Tonkin incident, which served as President Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s legal justification for deploying U.S. conventional forces in Vietnam and for the commencement of open warfare against North Vietnam.
* was an intelligence gathering ship involved in an international incident when attacked by Israeli jet fighter planes and motor torpedo boats on 8 June 1967, during the Six-Day War and while in international waters off the Sinai Peninsula.
* was an intelligence gathering vessel involved in an international incident when boarded and seized by the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea (North Korea) on 23 January 1968. The ship is still under Korean control, and remains in commission to this day.
* is lead ship of her class of ten nuclear-powered supercarriers. Since &quot;Nimitz&quot; was commissioned on 3 May 1975, these ships have been the centerpiece of American naval power. They are also largest warships ever built, although they are being eclipsed by the upcoming s.
* was a light cruiser, present during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and earning nine battle stars for World War II service. Transferred to the Argentine Navy in 1951, she was ultimately renamed in 1956. She was torpedoed and sunk during the Falklands War on 2 May 1982 by the British nuclear-powered submarine , with the loss of 323 lives, or just over half of Argentine deaths in the war. The sinking of &quot;General Belgrano&quot; was controversial in both Britain and Argentina at the time, and for some, remains so to this day.
* was struck on 17 May 1987 by two Exocet antiship missiles fired from an Iraqi Mirage F1 fighter during the Iran–Iraq War becoming the victim of the only successful anti-ship missile attack on a U.S. Navy warship.
* is an which struck an Iranian mine on 14 April 1988, severely damaging, and nearly sinking her, resulting in ten injured sailors, but no fatalities. The ship suffered flooding, fires, and a broken keel, which normally is fatal to the ship, but damage control efforts saved the ship. The attack resulted in the launching of Operation Praying Mantis. The ship was repaired and continued active service until it was decommissioned on 22 May 2015.
* is a AEGIS equipped guided missile cruiser. On 3 July 1988, the ship shot down Iran Air Flight 655 over the Persian Gulf, killing all 290 civilian passengers on board, including 38 non-Iranians and 66 children.
* On 12 October 2000, while at anchor in Aden, Yemen, &quot;Cole&quot; was attacked by Al-Qaeda suicide bombers, who sailed a small boat near the destroyer and detonated explosive charges. The blast created a hole in the port side of the ship about in diameter, killing 17 crew members and injuring 39.
* is a that, on 9 February 2001, precipitated international controversy when she struck the Japanese fishery high school training ship &quot;Ehime Maru&quot; (えひめ丸) off the coast of Oahu, causing the fishing boat to sink in less than ten minutes with the death of nine crew members. The &quot;Greeneville&quot; was conducting a practice emergency main ballast tank blow as a demonstration to civilian visitors.

<doc id="1176728" wikidata="Q5581873" url="?curid=1176728" title="Gonin Gumi">
<text>The were groups of five households that were held collectively responsible, in a manner similar to the Frith-borh in England, during the Edo period of Japanese history. All households in the shogunate were members of such a group, with all members of the group held responsible for the good conduct of all of the other members, and of their dependents. The responsibility included responsibility for crime and for non-payment of taxes.

== Overview ==
When the Tokugawa Shogunate came to power, they implemented a patriarchal system in Japan by reinforcing organized farming villages. The Gonin Gumi, which was introduced in January 1725, was an integral part of this policy. The Japanese official register declared that members of the collective are &quot;duty bound to keep watch not only over the doings of their families, but also of their employees and tenants, as they are responsible to the Government for actions of these people.&quot; The Gonin Gumi were primarily aimed at combating the vagabondage and brigandage of the time, including mutual defence against the rōnin. Some sources underscored that this system was established for the purpose of taxation and the peasant households that constitute each Gonin Gumi were jointly held responsible for a member&#x27;s inability to pay. 

The Gonin Gumi was headed by a leader who was usually elected from within, but sometimes appointed from above. In Kyoto, an elder called &quot;machi toshiyori&quot; led the grouping, with three member-representatives helping him in the administration. The groups did not always contain five households. In some districts, the groups could comprise six, or even ten, households. The Gonin Gumi was reorganized annually and those who left and did not join other groups could be punished after a trial.

The Gonin Gumi are sometimes erroneously conflated with the &quot;ryo-donari&quot; (両隣) or &quot;muko-sangen&quot; (向こう三軒), which are informal social institutions. The Gonin Gumi were formal institutions, involved in law enforcement.

<text>The Church Lads&#x27; and Church Girls&#x27; Brigade is an Anglican youth organisation with branches in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Bermuda, Kenya, South Africa, Barbados, Newfoundland and St Helena. Its origins lie in the formation in 1891 of the Church Lads&#x27; Brigade with its sister organisation, the Church Red Cross Brigade, later the Church Girls&#x27; Brigade, founded in 1901. The two respective founders were Walter M. Gee and the Reverend Thomas Milner. The two brigades amalgamated in 1978 to form the Church Lads&#x27; and Church Girls&#x27; Brigade.
The Church Lads&#x27; Brigade was one of the founding members of The National Council for Voluntary Youth Services (NCVYS), and the Church Lads&#x27; and Church Girls&#x27; Brigade remains a member for their work on development of young people.

The brigade&#x27;s patron saint is Martin of Tours. A banner depicting St Martin, which was presented by the brigade in 1921 to honour those members who died in the First World War, is kept at Westminster Abbey.

== Structure ==
The brigade is structured by location. Each location (typically a diocese) has a regiment or a diocesan battalion, this then divides into battalions (South, Central, North East – Durham, Oldham, Rochdale, Bolton, and Tameside) and then into companies. Generally, each regiment has more than one battalion, and each battalion has more than one company.

In Newfoundland, the brigade is composed of the Eastern Diocesan Regiment, split between the Avalon Battalion and the Trinity-Conception Battalion. Those battalions are further split into companies. The brigade has seen a decrease in membership, and many companies have now become defunct.

During the First World War, the Church Lads&#x27; Brigade was involved in the creation of the Newfoundland Regiment and the 16th (Service) Battalion (Church Lads&#x27; Brigade), King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps, among other.

It shares material with the Archives of the Newfoundland Church Lads’ Brigade. Membership receives an opportunity to have &quot;Brigader&quot; magazine twice a year, the Newfoundland CLB &quot;Bugle&quot; and offers of merchandise.

== Sections ==
The brigade is split into groups. These correspond with the age of the members:

* &quot;The Martins&quot; (named after the patron saint): 4 to 7 years of age.
* &quot;The Y Team&quot; (previously YB &amp; YGC: Young Boys and Young Girls Corp): 7 to 10 years of age.
* &quot;JTC&quot; (Jump To The Challenge (previously Junior Training Corps)): 10 to 13 years of age.
* &quot;Seniors&quot;: 13 to 21 years of age.
* &quot;Staff: 18 years onwards.

Members can become leaders and staff.

The following are the section designations for the CLB in Newfoundland:
* &quot;LTC&quot; (Little Training Corps. Previously LBC: Little Boys Corps): 5 and 6 years of age.
* &quot;YTC&quot; (Young Training Corps. Previously YBC: Young Boys Corps): 7 to 9 years of age.
* &quot;JTC&quot; (Junior Training Corps): 10 to 12 years of age.
* &quot;SC&quot; (Senior Corps.): 13 to 18 years of age.
* &quot;Staff&quot;: 19 years onwards. Can include commissioned officers or non-uniformed instructors.

== Ranking system ==

===Newfoundland===
In Newfoundland, LTC and YTC sections only ever hold the rank of &quot;private&quot;. Privates bear no chevrons or sashes. Ranks that merit chevrons wear the chevron on the mid-upper arm, facing downward. Youth ranks that merit Crowns wear them below their elbow. Officer ranks worn it on both sides of the lapel.

====JTC Section====
*Private 
*Junior lance corporal (one chevron, on the right arm only)
*Junior corporal (two chevrons, on the right arm only)
: Jr/L/Cpl and Jr/Cpl are considered &quot;junior&quot; non-commissioned officers (NCOs)

==== Senior Section ====
*Private
*Lance corporal (one chevron on each arm)
*Corporal (two chevrons on each arm)
*Lance sergeant (three chevrons on each arm; an N.C.O. Proficiency course is required to achieve this rank)
*Sergeant (three chevrons and a green sash with a button emblazoned with the C.L.B. crest)
: Lance corporal to sergeant are NCOs, while WO2s and WO1s are warrant officers. 
*Warrant officer, second class (two crowns, one on each arm, a red sash, and a drill cane)
: Many that hold this rank also hold the position of &quot;sergeant major&quot;. The rank is often shortened to &#x27;WO2&#x27; when addressing someone of this rank. A W.O. proficiency course, along with having been a sergeant for at least one year and being over the age of 17, is required to achieve this rank.
*Warrant officer, first class (two crowns, one on each arm, and a drill cane) 
: Those who are awarded this rank also hold the position of &quot;battalion sergeant major&quot;. This rank can take on both the attributes of a senior section member or those of an officer, but wear an officer&#x27;s uniform.
: After achieving a warrant officer rank, members who move into the ranks of officers are given the privilege of skipping the &quot;officer candidate&quot; stage.

====Officer ranks====
*Officer candidate 
: Often referred to as an &#x27;O.C.&#x27; when being addressed, an O.C. is someone who has not yet completed officer proficiency and achieved the status of a full commissioned officer. They do not wear any sign of rank.
*Second lieutenant (one pip on each lapel)
*First lieutenant (two pips on each lapel)
*Captain (three pips on each lapel)
*Major (a crown on each lapel)
: Those who achieve the rank of major are usually on battalion, or regimental staff. Battalion commanders hold the rank of major.
*Lieutenant colonel (one pip and a crown on each lapel)
: The regimental commander holds the rank of lieutenant colonel.
*Colonel (a pip, a crown, and another pip on each lapel)
: The current (and past) governor and commandant holds the rank of colonel.

==Activities==

===Company night===
Members will arrive and be instructed; subs will be taken before moving onto badgework. The members are then instructed to fall in and perform drills before moving onto games. Lastly, the Brigade Prayer is said before any notices are given out.

===Badgework===
Badgework can take place in several different forms. The brigade has Christian teachings. Many companies have been known to award The Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award.

=== Drill ===
Many companies have a parade one Sunday a month; all members are required to attend a family service in church before parading. By the time members reach JTC, the older members are encouraged to take turns commanding drill.

===Camp===
There are national camps available, one being a trip to Butlins and another being &#x27;spring adventure&#x27; (the location varies); these are both early in the year. Many brigade companies choose to take their members on expeditions, sometimes working towards their Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award.

In Newfoundland, week-long summer camps are offered for members of the JTC and SC sections, while in the fall and winter, weekend hiking and survival camps, known as &quot;Challenge Camps&quot; are held for members of the Senior Corps only.

===Sports===
Members are encouraged to get involved in a number of sports. Some of these sports are used as competitions between battalions and then between regiments.

Each February, battalions are invited to take part in a unihoc contest. The different companies stay at Butlins, in Skegness, for 2 or 3 nights.

===Band===
Many brigade companies in the United Kingdom also have a marching band with instruments such as drums, bugles, cymbals and glockenspiels. Several bands also run brass and woodwind bands.

Many battalions and regiments run their own band competitions for their members; there is also a National Band Competition for the bands to compete in which takes place annually around May, within which many of the brigade companies take part nationally. In Newfoundland, each battalion has its own marching band, such as the Regimental Band.

====Music played====
Historically, many companies have had a large bugle section, therefore choosing to play bugle marches such as &quot;Assam Rifles&quot; (Winter), &quot;The Little Bugler&quot; (Duthoit) and &quot;Mechanised Infantry&quot; (McBain). The woodwind section will play other marches, such as &quot;Aces High&quot;.

==National Band==
To support individual companies, the CLCGB runs a National Band, giving the members an opportunity to play in a band of over 60 members. The band plays across Britain, Europe and New York on summer tours. The band plays a variety of music, having a brass and woodwind section with traditional drum corps, bugle corps and mallet sections.

==National Choir==
The brigade has a National Choir. Formed in 1991, the choir welcomes members from all regions in which the brigade operates and provides the opportunity for members to sing. It supports brigade events and performs three concerts in the autumn of each year. It has also played a role in the brigade&#x27;s annual service of remembrance held each November in the chapel of the National Memorial Arboretum at Alrewas, Staffordshire. The membership of the choir went from about 25 to 50.

==Brigade prayer==
Members are encouraged to pray at least once every night. This prayer is the standard brigade prayer.
Heavenly Father, bless and guide with your spirit the work of the Church Lads&#x27; and Church Girls&#x27; Brigade. Help us never be ashamed to confess the faith of Christ crucified. To fight valiantly under his banner against sin, the world and the devil, and to continue as his faithful soldiers and servants to the end of our lives. Amen.
Some companies, such as St James Brightlingsea in Essex, will say Grace at the end of the Brigade Prayer.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with us all, evermore. Amen.

An alternate version of the Brigade Prayer is used in Newfoundland. The prayer is usually said at the beginning of a parade night, while the Grace is generally said at the end: 
Grant O God, That we may never be ashamed to confess the faith of Christ crucified, and to faithfully fight under his banner against sin, the world, and the devil; to continue as his faithful soldiers and servants, unto our lives end. Through the same Jesus Christ our Lord, Amen.

==Cultural references ==
The CLB is mentioned in the traditional Newfoundland song &quot;Recruiting Sargeant&quot;, which honours the Royal Newfoundland Regiment. The ballad was popularized in 1997 when it was covered by the Canadian folk rock band Great Big Sea.

<text>WRSU-FM (88.7 FM) is a non-commercial college radio station serving the greater Central New Jersey area, broadcasting from the campus of Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey. It is a student and faculty-run radio station. 

==Programming==
WRSU currently operates mostly on free-form programming. Shows do not have to fit a certain style with DJs creating their own playlists. Genres of music that the station features include indie rock, alternative rock and heavy metal music. The station also broadcasts electronic music, rap/hip-hop, and other diverse genres of music. There is an eclectic level of diversity in WRSU&#x27;s specialty programming, and many shows focus on one particular brand of music and are broadcast weekly. The station commits its Sunday programming schedule to members of the diverse New Brunswick community.

The station helps select and present live local bands and musicians on stage at the annual Rutgers Day festival.

===Sports===
WRSU has a large listenership for its sports programming, as the WRSU Sports department covers a wide range of teams to train students for a career in broadcast media. The station has been broadcasting Rutgers athletics since 1954.

Student broadcasters perform play-by-play coverage of all home and away games for Rutgers football, Rutgers men&#x27;s basketball, and Rutgers women&#x27;s basketball. WRSU remains the flagship station for the Rutgers women&#x27;s basketball program. WRSU&#x27;s student sportscasters also broadcast all home games for the Rutgers baseball and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer teams, and broadcasts of Rutgers lacrosse and wrestling have also been incorporated into the station&#x27;s schedule in recent years. WRSU also credentials students to cover many home games as sports reporters, allowing members of the department to practice writing game stories and opinion pieces to be posted on the WRSU website. In 2019, WRSU Sports was named &quot;Best Football Play by Play&quot; by the Intercollegiate Broadcasting System at its 2019 international conference in New York City.

Since 1974, WRSU has hosted a post game show, called &quot;Knightline&quot;, for listeners to call-in and discuss Rutgers athletics after every Football and Men&#x27;s Basketball broadcast.

====Sports talk====
The station currently broadcasts several weekly sports talk shows, hosted by members of the Sports department. These shows feature frequent interviews from members of the regional and national sports media, as well as those within the Rutgers athletic community, as well as listener phone calls. In September 2019, the numerous sports shows - including the longtime Tuesday evening show &quot;SportsKnight&quot; - were consolidated into &quot;WRSU Crew&quot;, an afternoon drive-time show that often serves as a lead-in to evening sports broadcasts.

===News===
WRSU features eight daily newscasts a week - Monday at 10 pm, Tuesday through Thursday at noon and 10 pm, and Fridays at noon. The newscasts cover events, issues, and trends happening at Rutgers, with national and local headline reports, Sports reports, and weather forecasts.

The news department also produces &quot;KnightBeat&quot;, a news-talk show featuring interviews with campus organizations and leaders, discussions of the latest news headlines, and detailed profiles and discussions of Rutgers issues.

The WRSU news department also provides live coverage of Rutgers events, as well as annual election coverage. In recent years WRSU has broadcast from both the Democratic and Republican Presidential Conventions Headquarters.

WRSU provided live coverage of the 2008 Presidential election on November 4, featuring live reports from the New Jersey Democratic and Republican headquarters, analysis by Rutgers political commentators, up-to-the-minute results, and live reports from College Avenue during student celebrations.

==History==
WRSU first went on the air on April 26, 1948. In its earliest inception, WRSU was an AM Carrier Current station that broadcast from 12 College Avenue, with transmitters in the basements of several Rutgers dormitory buildings, as well as at the New Jersey College for Women, which would eventually become Douglass College. During this period, WRSU ran on the 630 AM band. The station&#x27;s first general manager and founder was Charles Brookwell, Class of &#x27;49.

Beginning in the 1950s, the station changed frequencies and changed operating facilities, eventually moving to 680 on the AM band. The carrier current transmitters were expanded to include operation in 23 dormitory buildings on three campuses. The current offices of the station began to be used in 1969 and are located at 126 College Avenue located in the Rutgers Student Center.

WRSU-AM ceased operation in 1976, two years after the inception of WRSU-FM.

;WRSU-FM

WRSU-FM went on the air at 88.7 MHz with 1350 watts ERP on January 27, 1974. During the 1950s and 1960s, the station played current popular music, but starting in the &#x27;70s, the station underwent a conscious effort to introduce album-oriented progressive/free form movement with a heavy concentration on Community Affairs. The first song ever played was Crosby, Stills, and Nash&#x27;s &quot;&quot; The seventies were also a time when live interviews with singers began and ranged from the local band Holme to Wonder Woman Linda Carter promoting her first album.

==Philosophy==
WRSU has a station playlist of current music, but it generally consists of several hundred entire albums, and individual DJs have a large amount of control over the format of their shows. The station is strictly non-commercial, and aims for a free-form style of broadcasting.

The station is under the management of Rutgers University. While operations are on a strictly volunteer level and no course credit is involved for students, the station does seek to develop the skills of their student personnel for practical use in professional broadcasting fields.

==Funding and operations==
WRSU receives funding from Rutgers University, and is a strictly non-commercial radio station. However, WRSU does receive grants and underwriting from local businesses and record stores. Usually, this underwriting takes the form of a credit for the station at said record store in exchange for hourly notices broadcast on the station.

==Notable alumni==
For more than 60 years, WRSU has prepared many of its students for a career in sports, news and entertainment media.

<doc id="1176734" wikidata="Q2023546" url="?curid=1176734" title="Netherlee">
<text>Netherlee is an affluent suburban residential area in East Renfrewshire, Scotland. It is situated on the west bank of the White Cart Water about 4 miles (6.5 km) south of Glasgow city centre. Part of the Greater Glasgow conurbation, it is mostly contiguous with the city, and is just beyond the boundary of its local authority area. It is a separate census locality from Glasgow, like other areas such as neighbouring Giffnock and Clarkston. Netherlee is directly contiguous with Stamperland. It is also in a council ward with Clarkston and its neighbour Busby. As of 2012, Netherlee has a population of 4,550.

Originally a small rural hamlet dependent upon the mills along the river, Netherlee became extensively urbanised in the 20th century, developing into an affluent commuter suburb. The area is served by a parish church, primary school and library, as well as a number of local shops and parks. Cathcart Cemetery also falls within the boundaries of Netherlee.

==History==

In the medieval era, the area of modern Netherlee and Clarkston was known as the Lands of Lee, centred on Lee Castle. The small hill on which the castle stood is now the small park behind Netherlee Post Office. In the 15th century, the Lands of Lee were split up into Netherlee, and Midlee (now Stamperland) and Overlee (both now part of neighbouring Clarkston). From the 1660s onwards, the Maxwell family of Bogton, (which extended into modern Muirend) developed the original Williamwood House and the surrounding Williamwood Estate. The house was built adjacent to the site of Lee Castle, the latter being demolished around this time.

The original hamlet of Netherlee developed in connection with a paper mill which was opened on the western bank of the White Cart Water around 1700. Towards the end of the 18th century, the Netherlee House mansion was built by one of the mill&#x27;s owners, John Muir. By the 1790s, Netherlee had expanded from the riverside to a new village centre on the main road from Glasgow to Kilmarnock (now the location of MacLaren Place). In the 1830s the mill became a calico printworks, which provided the main source of employment in the area until the 1880s.

The early years of the 20th century saw the first phase of urbanisation. New housing developments, typically red sandstone terraces, began to eat up former agricultural land. Due to building restrictions as a result of the First World War, however, it was not until the 1920s that the majority of residential streets off the main artery were fully developed as they appear today. Netherlee in the mid-1930s was mostly as it is today, with the construction of the parish church, primary school and the MacLaren Place building.

==Governance==
Netherlee is in East Renfrewshire, one of the 32 council areas of Scotland for local government purposes. East Renfrewshire Council, the unitary local council, is based in nearby Giffnock and is responsible for local government. For local electoral purposes, Netherlee was formerly a ward electing a single councillor to East Renfrewshire Council, but is now grouped with Clarkston and Busby as a larger multi-member ward electing three councillors. Netherlee and Stamperland together form one of East Renfrewshire&#x27;s designated community council areas, but following the dissolution of the previous community council in 2015 there were insufficient nominations for it to be re-established at that time.

The Netherlee area has been part of the historic county of Renfrewshire since medieval times. From 1890 onwards, Renfrewshire was an area of local government administered by a county council. Although Renfrewshire ceased to be used for local government purposes in 1975, it continues to exist as both a Lieutenancy area and registration county. Netherlee is also within the ancient parish of Cathcart, which formed the lowest tier of local government between 1845 and 1930, and which continues to exist for some statistical purposes. Between 1930 and 1975, Netherlee was within the First Landward District of Renfrewshire.

Following the abolition of administrative counties in 1975, Netherlee became a part of the new Eastwood District within Strathclyde Region under the two tier system of local government which lasted until the creation of the present unitary authorities in 1996.

In the Parliament of the United Kingdom, Netherlee is represented in the House of Commons as part of the county constituency of East Renfrewshire. Kirsten Oswald of the Scottish National Party was first elected as MP for East Renfrewshire in the 2015 General Election. For the Scottish Parliament, Netherlee forms part of the Eastwood constituency within the West of Scotland electoral region. As such it is currently represented by Jackson Carlaw of the Scottish Conservative Party as the constituency Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) in addition to the seven regional list MSPs.

==Geography==

At , Netherlee is in Scotland&#x27;s Central Lowlands. The community is above sea level, northwest of East Kilbride, south of Glasgow and east of Barrhead. The area is contiguous with the city of Glasgow and forms part of the Greater Glasgow conurbation. It lies on the west bank of the White Cart Water, a tributary of the River Clyde.

==Demography==

For census purposes, Netherlee is classed as a locality within the settlement of Greater Glasgow. According to the United Kingdom Census 2011, Netherlee had a total resident population of 4,562. The population is 88% White Scottish, with white people as a whole making up 97.1% of the total. 2.4% are Asian with 0.5% from other ethnic backgrounds. 62.2% of the population identified as Christian (38.8% Church of Scotland, 19.7% Roman Catholic and 3.7% other Christian denominations), with 28.9% stating they had no religion.

The most recent estimate, from mid-2012, suggests the population of Netherlee has decreased very slightly to 4,550.

In a 2014 Royal Mail survey, the G44 postcode – which includes Netherlee – was rated as the most desirable area of Scotland to live in. Statistics from the 2020 Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation ranks Netherlee as one of the ten least deprived areas in Scotland.

==Culture and community==
Netherlee Library is operated by East Renfrewshire Culture and Leisure, a charity partially funded by East Renfrewshire Council.

==Landmarks==
MacLaren Place is a Category B listed building on Clarkston Road. A long three-storey tenement building with shops on the ground floor, its design combines traditional Glasgow tenement stylings with contemporary art deco details. Designed by Glasgow architect Andrew Wilson, it was built in 1935 for local landowner John MacLaren Lochead (who lived in the now-demolished Netherlee House) and replaced an earlier cottage-style tenement row.

Netherlee Parish Church on Ormonde Avenue is also Category B listed. Built in 1933 by architects Stewart and Paterson, it was probably the last stone church built in the Glasgow area.
The north part of Netherlee (referred to as Bogton on some maps) as well as First Avenue and small areas around North Williamwood were made a conservation area in 2019. They were classed as an article 2 protection area up until that point, which gave it the majority of the protections of a conservation area anyway.

==Education==
There is one non-denominational primary school in the area, Netherlee Primary School, opened in 1933 to serve the growing population. It was extensively modernised and expanded in the 1990s. In December 2005 it became the first school in Scotland to achieve a top-level &quot;excellent&quot; rating following inspection by Her Majesty&#x27;s Inspectorate of Education. It acts as a feeder for Williamwood High School in neighbouring Clarkston.

==Notable people==
Former Rangers and Scotland footballer Bob McPhail lived in Netherlee in retirement, until his death in 2000.

Scottish folk singer Alastair McDonald lives in Netherlee.

Olympic athlete Lee McConnell moved to Netherlee in 2013.

<text>Kallikomo (Greek: Καλλίκωμο) is a village and a community in the municipal unit of Skillounta, Elis, Greece. It is situated 5 km from the Ionian Sea, 3 km west of Krestena, 5 km north of Kato Samiko and 16 km southeast of Pyrgos. The GR-9/E55 (Patras - Pyrgos - Kyparissia) runs through the village. The junction with the Greek National Road 76 to Krestena and Megalopoli is 1 km east of the village. The community consists of the villages Kallikomo, Krounoi and Ladiko.

==Historical population==
==History==
The village Kallikomo is a planned town, built around 1970 by the army in order to house the inhabitants of the villages Krounoi and Ladiko, that had been destroyed by an earthquake in 1965. In 2001, Ladiko was completely deserted and Krounoi had only 105 inhabitants. The only intact building that remains in Ladiko is the church of St. Demetrius. Krounoi has a church dedicated to St. Panteleimon. Ladiko and Krounoi have no municipal building of their own today, being assigned to the one in Kallikomo.

On March 26, 2002, pilot Pantelis Karantalis was hailed as a hero by the population of Kallikomo for managing to steer his crashing A-7 Corsair bomber away from the village before bailing out.

<doc id="1176748" wikidata="Q940871" url="?curid=1176748" title="Sticharion">
<text>The sticharion (also &quot;stikharion&quot; or &quot;stichar&quot;; Greek: στιχάριον; Slavonic: Стиха́рь - Stikhár’) is a liturgical vestment of the Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Churches, roughly analogous in function to the alb of the Western Church. The sticharion is worn by all classes of ordained ministers in the Constantinopolitan Rite and comes in two forms: one worn by priests and one worn by deacons and other altar servers.

The sticharion is derived from the &quot;chiton&quot;, a long, sleeved garment which reached to the ground and was worn in ancient times by both men and women.

==Deacons and Servers==
In the form worn by deacons, subdeacons, altar servers, and sometimes by readers, the sticharion is a long robe with wide, loose sleeves, fastened at the neck, and often open down the sides but held shut with buttons or ties. Thus in form, it is close to the dalmatic and tunicle of Western Christianity. There is usually a cross embroidered or appliquéd to the center of the back, between the shoulder blades. This type of sticharion is often made from rich brocade in the various liturgical colors, and worn as an outer vestment. The sticharion is symbolic of &quot;a pure and tranquil conscience, a spotless life, and the spiritual joy in the Lord which flows therefrom.&quot;

==Priests==
The sticharion used by priests and bishops is worn as the undermost vestment. In this form, it is often made from a lighter fabric: linen, satin, silk, etc., and is usually white in color, though it may also be made of colored fabric. It is usually far less ornate than the deacon&#x27;s sticharion. The priest&#x27;s sticharion has narrow sleeves that tie at the wrists. The white color symbolizes that the grace of the Holy Spirit covers the celebrant with a garment of salvation.

In the Russian tradition, a bishop&#x27;s sticharion can be more elaborately embellished than a priest&#x27;s and is sometimes called a &quot;podsakkosnik&quot; (Russian:подсаккосник), &quot;i.e.&quot;, &quot;under-sakkos&quot;.

Coptic priests wear a white sticharion with a large cross on the front and back, and smaller ones on each sleeve. &quot;Ⲓⲏ̅̅ⲥ̅̅ Ⲡⲓⲭ̅̅ⲥ̅̅ ̀Ⲡϣⲏⲣⲓ ̀ⲙⲫ̅ϯ&quot; (Nomina Sacra for Ⲓⲏⲥⲟⲥ Ⲡⲓ̀ⲭⲣⲏⲥⲧⲟⲥ ̀Ⲡϣⲏⲣⲓ ̀ⲙⲪⲛⲟⲩϯ), meaning &quot;Jesus Christ the Son of God,&quot; is usually written around the crosses. An epitrachelion-like garment is usually worn on top but not used during lesser services, along with other garments on special occasions. Chaldean Catholic and Assyrian priests wore a similar alb-like garment, called a &quot;kottinâ&quot;. The Syriac &quot;kuttino&quot; is now almost always white also. The Armenian &quot;patmucan&quot; and Ethiopian &quot;qamis&quot; are similar to the sticharion.

==Liturgical use==
Deacons, subdeacons and altar servers wear the sticharion at any service at which they are serving. However, in Greek practice, the custom has developed to wear only the orarion and epimanikia without the sticharion during the lesser services.

Before vesting, the deacon or altar servicemen will take his sticharion for the priest (or bishop, if he is present) to bless before he puts it on. Bishops and priests will bless their vestments themselves before vesting. Each minister will kiss the cross on the back of their phelonion before putting it on.

When vesting for the Divine Liturgy priests and deacons say the following vesting prayer as they put on the garments:

:&quot;My soul shall rejoice in the Lord, for He hath clothed me in the garment of salvation, and with the vesture of gladness has He covered me; He hath placed a crown upon me as on a bridegroom, and He hath adorned me with comeliness.&quot;

When a bishop is vesting before the Divine Liturgy the prayer above is read by the Protodeacon, as the subdeacons place the vestment upon him. Sometimes this prayer is chanted by the choir during the vesting of the bishop.

<text>The Battle of Cape Spada was a naval battle between the Royal Navy and the during the Battle of the Mediterranean in the second World War. It took place on 19 July 1940 in the Mediterranean Sea off Cape Spada, the north-western extremity of Crete.

==Prelude==

The action occurred when a Commonwealth squadron patrolling the Aegean encountered two Italian cruisers en route from Tripoli to Leros, an Italian colony in the Dodecanese Islands. The Commonwealth squadron was commanded by the Australian Captain John Collins aboard the light cruiser with the H-class destroyers , , , and the similar of the Royal Navy. The Italian 2nd Cruiser Division was commanded by Vice-Admiral Ferdinando Casardi aboard the fast light cruiser which included , another light cruiser.

==Battle==

When the Italians encountered the Allied destroyers at about 07:30, &quot;Sydney&quot; and &quot;Havock&quot; were to the north on a sweep for submarines. The other destroyers led the Italian cruisers on a chase northwards to give &quot;Sydney&quot; time to come to the rescue. &quot;Sydney&quot; sighted the Italians at 08:26, opening fire at 08:29, and the Italian cruisers turned away to the south-west. In the chase that followed, &quot;Bartolomeo Colleoni&quot; was hit several times by &quot;Sydney&quot; and a shell tore through her unarmored hull; the boilers and guns were disabled at 09:23, leaving her dead in the water.

The crew of &quot;Bartolomeo Colleoni&quot; fought on but were unable to manoeuvre or use the main armament; despite the fire from her guns, she was sunk by three torpedoes launched from &quot;Ilex&quot; and &quot;Hyperion&quot; at 09:59. &quot;Sydney&quot; continued to engage &quot;Bande Nere&quot;. &quot;Sydney&quot; was hit in the funnel by an Italian shell but hit &quot;Bande Nere&quot; at least twice, killing eight in the bow and the hangar. Later, &quot;Sydney&quot; disengaged because she was short of ammunition, &quot;Bande Nere&quot; returned to Benghazi, shadowed by the battleship and a screen of destroyers.

Despite their speed advantage, the Italian cruisers failed to outrun &quot;Sydney&quot; because they had to steer south-southwest, instead of the most obvious route of escape to the south, to avoid being trapped between their opponents and the Cretan coast. This gave the Australian cruiser the chance to close the range. The light armour of &quot;Colleoni&quot; and &quot;Bande Nere&quot; was unable to withstand &quot;Sydney&quot;″s shells. The lack of aerial reconnaissance was another factor contributing to the successful Commonwealth chase.

==Aftermath==

===Casualties===
Of the crew of &quot;Bartolomeo Colleoni&quot; there were 555 survivors but 121 men, including the captain, Umberto Novaro, were killed.

===Subsequent operations===
The British destroyers were bombed by Italian aircraft after the battle, damaging &quot;Havock&quot;, whose no. 2 boiler was flooded. A floatplane from &quot;Warspite&quot;, which was searching for &quot;Bande Nere&quot;, ditched in the sea and was lost near Tobruk, the crew being taken prisoner by the Italians. Allied Convoy AN 2 was ordered to sail back to Port Said and remain there until &quot;Bande Nere&quot; reached Benghazi.

<text>Tactical Air Command (TAC) is an inactive United States Air Force organization. It was a Major Command of the United States Air Force, established on 21 March 1946 and headquartered at Langley Air Force Base, Virginia. It was inactivated on 1 June 1992 and its personnel and equipment absorbed by Air Combat Command (ACC).

Tactical Air Command was established to provide a balance between strategic, air defense, and tactical forces of the post–World War II U.S. Army Air Forces followed by, in 1947, the U.S. Air Force. In 1948, the Continental Air Command assumed control over air defense, tactical air, and air reserve forces. After two years in a subordinate role, Tactical Air Command (TAC) was established as a major command.

In 1992, after assessing the mission of TAC and to accommodate a decision made regarding Strategic Air Command (SAC), Headquarters United States Air Force inactivated TAC and incorporated its resources into the newly created Air Combat Command.

== History ==

===Operational history===
World War II showed the effectiveness of tactical air power in supporting army ground forces. However, the rapid demobilization in late 1945 meant that the huge air armada that had brought Germany to her knees and victory in Europe had been downsized to a shadow of its former self.

Following the end of World War II, Headquarters United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) had little funding and most wartime personnel had been released from active duty and returned to civilian life. Many USAAF aircraft were being sent to storage or scrapyards, although the increasing tension with the Soviet Union meant that combat military air forces were still needed. The big questions were how large and what kind of forces.

A major realignment of the USAAF was undertaken in early 1946. As part of the realignment, three major command divisions within the Continental United States (CONUS) were formed: Strategic Air Command, Tactical Air Command, and Air Defense Command. Each was given a specific responsibility, using assets prescribed to accomplish the assigned mission. Tactical Air Command was formed to command, organize, equip, train and administer assigned or attached forces. It was to plan for and participate in tactics for fighter, light bombardment and other aircraft. These included tactical fighters, tactical bombers, tactical missiles, troop carrier aircraft, assault, reconnaissance, and support units. TAC also planned for and developed the capability to deploy tactical striking forces anywhere in the world.

During its existence, Tactical Air Command deployed personnel, material and/or aircraft to Asia (both Pacific Rim/Southeast Asia and Southwest Asia/Middle East), Africa, North America, South America, Europe and Australia in support of its prescribed mission.

TAC&#x27;s original authorization was 25,500 officers and enlisted men. Aircraft assets available consisted of propeller-driven North American P-51 Mustangs, Republic P-47 Thunderbolts and a handful of the new jet-powered Lockheed P-80 Shooting Stars. TAC was also given control of the Third Air Force, Ninth Air Force and Twelfth Air Force.

==== Berlin Airlift ====
On 18 September 1947, the United States Air Force was established as a separate military force, with TAC as one of its major commands. Six months later, in March 1948, the first test of the United States&#x27; resolve began with the blockade of Berlin by the Soviet Union and the need for tactical air power in Europe to underscore the airlift mission was necessary.

At the time, there was only one U.S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) tactical air unit available in Europe, the 86th Composite Group at Neubiberg Air Base near Munich, flying P-47Ds. TAC was called upon to send additional units and aircraft to Europe to reinforce the 86 FG. The 36th Fighter Group, flying Lockheed F-80B &quot;Shooting Stars,&quot; was transferred from Howard AFB in the Panama Canal Zone to Fürstenfeldbruck Air Base near Munich. In addition to tactical fighter aircraft, TAC also deployed available C-47 Skytrain transports to Europe, transferring them to USAFE, which was in control of the airlift. As the airlift continued, TAC also transferred available C-54 Skymaster transports to Europe, where they were assigned to the troop carrier groups that had been sent to Germany for the airlift.

Consequently, the Soviet Union entered into negotiations with the United States, the United Kingdom and France which culminated in an agreement, signed on 5 May 1949, that resulted in the lifting of the blockade, but it did not settle the basic issue of freedom of access. Despite the resumption of surface traffic into the city, the airlift continued until 30 September to mass a reserve of food, fuel, and other supplies in the event the Soviets reimposed the blockade.

==== Continental Air Command ====

In December 1948, Air Defense Command (ADC) and TAC were brought together to form Continental Air Command (ConAC). HQ TAC was reduced to the status of an operational headquarters under CONAC. This move reflected an effort to concentrate all fighter forces deployed within the continental United States (CONUS) to strengthen the air defense of the North American continent. The creation of ConAC was largely an administrative convenience: the units assigned to ConAC were dual-trained and expected to revert to their primary strategic or tactical roles after the air defense battle was won. Two years later, on 1 December 1950, the Air Force reestablished Tactical Air Command as a major command and removed it from assignment to ConAC in large part due to the need to deploy personnel and aircraft to Japan and South Korea due to the Korean War.

=== Korean War ===

On the morning of 25 June 1950, the peace in South Korea was shattered by the sound of invading tanks. The North Korean army had crossed the 38th parallel and were driving south towards the South Korean capital of Seoul in an effort to unite the country under Communist rule. The United States Air Force, weakened by post-World War II demobilization, associated budget reductions, and preoccupied with the threat of the Soviet Union, was thrust into its first war as a separate service when North Korea invaded South Korea.

Air bases in the United States went on mobility alert to prepare for overseas movement in response to what was then described as the &quot;Korean Emergency.&quot; Units from SAC and CONAC were deployed to Japan and South Korea, while Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard units were recalled to active duty and, in the case of the Air National Guard, placed under Federal Service in case they were needed. What started out as an emergency turned into a bona-fide war. The Korean War marked the creation of a professional Air Force that would grow in size and strength for decades to come.

From the start, the deployed tactical fighters and bombers to Japan and South Korea were effective. On 10 July a North Korean armored column was trapped at a bombed-out bridge near Pyongtaek. F-80 Shooting Stars, B-26 Invaders, and F-82 Twin Mustangs destroyed 117 trucks, 38 tanks, and seven half-tracks. This attack, along with others, gutted North Korea&#x27;s single armored division. Had it survived, the North Korean force could have easily punched through the United Nations (UN) defensive line at Pusan and driven UN Command (UNC) forces into the sea.

By the end of August 1950, the initial North Korean onslaught was reversed and Seoul was retaken. As the United Nations forces advanced into North Korea, forces from the Communist China stepped in to help their North Korean allies. The UN advance ground to a halt in December, then retreated south in early 1951 while tactical aircraft continued to support of United Nations forces. Eventually, the line stabilized along the 38th Parallel, where a stalemate ensued for the next two years.

==== Known TAC units and aircraft deployed to Far East Air Forces (1950–1953) ====
Units and aircraft were stationed both in South Korea and Japan and attached to Fifth Air Force during their deployment to Far East Air Forces (FEAF). This list does not include ConAC, Air Force Reserve, or Air National Guard tactical air units federalized and deployed to FEAF during the Korean War.

=== United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) ===


Even with the active war in Korea raging, in the early 1950s Europe received a higher priority of air power than Korea by the Truman Administration and the Department of Defense. Deterring the threat of a Communist takeover of Western Europe was considered more important to the long-term survival of the United States than a Communist victory in Korea.

In September 1950, NATO&#x27;s Military Committee had called for an ambitious buildup of conventional forces to meet the Soviets, subsequently reaffirming this position at the February 1952 meeting of the Atlantic Council in Lisbon which had established a goal of ultimately fielding 96 divisions in the event of a conventional war in 1954. In support of this, the United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), which consisted of 16 wings totaling 2,100 aircraft, was programmed to expand to 28 wings, 22 of them in NATO&#x27;s Central Region alone, backed by deployed Strategic Air Command units sent from CONUS.

The USAF reassigned combat wings from TAC to USAFE during the period from April 1951 through December 1954. These were:
* 81st Fighter-Interceptor Wing
: Reassigned to: RAF Bentwaters, United Kingdom
* 47th Bombardment Wing, Light
: Deployed to: RAF Sculthorpe, United Kingdom
: (Remained assigned to TAC&#x27;s 49th Air Division)
* 20th Fighter-Bomber Wing
: Reassigned to: RAF Wethersfield, United Kingdom
* 406th Fighter-Bomber Wing
: Reassigned to: RAF Manston, United Kingdom
* 66th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing
: Reassigned to: Sembach Air Base, West Germany
* 10th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing
: Reassigned to: Spangdahlem Air Base, West Germany
* 50th Fighter-Bomber Wing
: Reassigned to: Hahn Air Base, West Germany
* 21st Fighter Bomber Wing
: Reassigned to: Chambley-Bussieres Air Base, France
* 48th Fighter Bomber Wing
: Activated at: Chaumont-Semoutiers Air Base, France
: (Replaced ANG 137th Fighter-Bomber Wing)
* 388th Fighter Bomber Wing
: Reassigned to: Etain-Rouvres Air Base, France
* 60th Troop Carrier Wing
: Reassigned to: Dreux-Louvillier Air Base, France
* 465th Troop Carrier Wing
: Reassigned to: Toul-Rosières Air Base, France
* 38th Tactical Bombardment Wing (Light)
: Reassigned to: Laon-Couvron Air Base, France

These wings gave USAFE and NATO approximately 500 fighters, 100 light bombers, 100 tactical reconnaissance aircraft, 100 tactical airlift transports, and 18,000 USAF personnel.

====Rotational Deployments to Mediterranean Bases====
With the phase-out of the B-47 Stratojet from SAC in the mid-1960s, the need for Strategic Air Command &quot;Reflex&quot; European bases diminished and the Sixteenth Air Force (16AF) was turned over to the USAFE on 15 April 1966.

Prior to 1966, TAC routinely deployed CONUS-based North American F-100 Super Sabre wings to 16AF bases in Spain, as well as to Aviano Air Base, Italy. With USAFE taking possession of these bases from SAC, Tactical Air Command reassigned the 401st Tactical Fighter Wing from England Air Force Base, Louisiana to USAFE on a permanent basis to Torrejon Air Base, Spain on 27 April to perform host functions at the base and to support rotational temporary duty (TDY) to Italy and Turkey for NATO alerts. However, when the 401st&#x27;s fighter squadrons deployed to South Vietnam in the 1960s for the Vietnam War, squadrons from Homestead AFB, Florida and Myrtle Beach AFB, South Carolina were utilized to fill the need in Spain. These squadrons remained in Europe until 1970, when the drawdown in Vietnam allowed the squadrons from the 401st, which were deployed to Southeast Asia, to rejoin their home unit.

=== Composite Air Strike Force ===
: &quot;see: Nineteenth Air Force&quot;

In the aftermath of the Korean War, TAC developed the Composite Air Strike Force (CASF) concept, a mobile rapid-deployment strike concept designed to respond to &quot;brush fire&quot; conflicts around the world. A CASF included fighter bomber aircraft for both conventional and nuclear attack missions, as well as troop carrier, tanker, and tactical reconnaissance assets. TAC composite air strike forces were intended to augment existing combat units already in place as part of United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), the Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), or the Alaskan Air Command (AAC).

In addition, the new Century Series of TAC fighters were making their first flights, designed from the lessons learned in the air over Korea. As these new fighters and new transport aircraft came on line, there were problems with each one. TAC pilots risked life and limb to iron out the problems and make these aircraft fully operational. Also, with the development of air refueling, TAC could now flex its muscles and demonstrate true global mobility. Deployments to Europe and the Far East became a way of life for TAC units. When Strategic Air Command abandoned its fighter escort force in 1957, those aircraft were transferred to TAC, further augmenting its strength.

The first deployment of the Composite Air Strike Force took place in July 1958 in response to an imminent coup d&#x27;état in Lebanon. TAC scrambled forces across the Atlantic to Turkey, where their presence was intended to force an end to the crisis. A similar CASF was deployed in response to conflicts between China and Taiwan in 1958.

CASF received another test in 1961, when the Berlin Crisis resulted in TAC quickly deploying 210 aircraft to Europe, consisting of 144 North American F-100D Super Sabres and 54 Lockheed F-104C Starfighters, but also including 6 McDonnell RF-101 Voodoo and 6 Douglas RB-66C Destroyer reconnaissance aircraft. Also as part of the CASF, the Air National Guard subsequently deployed 36 Lockheed F-104A Starfighters, 54 North American F-86H Sabres, and 90 Republic F-84F Thunderstreaks.

In 1961, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara organized the United States Strike Command at MacDill AFB, Florida to integrate CASF efforts with those of the Strategic Army Corps. TAC had gone from a meager postwar force to a force capable of putting the right amount of assets in the right place when they were needed.

=== Tactical missiles ===

In 1949, TAC began testing the Martin B-61, later redesignated as TM-61 Matador surface-to-surface cruise missile at Holloman AFB, New Mexico. The initial flight ended in a crash, but the second launch was successful and outran the chase aircraft. Testing continued with launches of 46 missiles at both Holloman AFB and the Long Range Proving Ground at Cape Canaveral, Florida, and in March 1954 the first operational missile squadron in the U.S. Air Force, the 1st Pilotless Bomber Squadron, was deployed to Bitburg Air Base, Germany. Launches at Holloman and Cape Canaveral continued until 1963, at which time the missile was redesignated again as the MGM-1 Matador.

In 1954, an improved missile, the TM-76A Mace (later redesignated the CGM-13 Mace began development at Holloman AFB, with its first launch in 1956. The ATRAN (Automatic Terrain Recognition and Navigation) Mace &quot;A&quot; was launched from a mobile transporter/launcher while the inertially guided Mace &quot;B&quot; was launched from a hardened bunker. Both used a solid fuel booster rocket for initial acceleration and an Allison J33 turbojet for flight. The TM-76B, redesignated as CGM-13B remained on alert until 30 April 1969 with the 71st Tactical Missile Squadron at Bitburg AB, and until October 1969 with the 498th Tactical Missile Group at Kadena Air Base, Okinawa. As TAC was responsible for training crews that were assigned to both PACAF and USAFE, the only tactical missiles in TAC&#x27;s inventory were the training missiles of the 4504th Missile Training Wing at Orlando AFB, Florida. Ninth Air Force (TAC), while headquartered at Shaw AFB, South Carolina, maintained the USAF Tactical Missile School at Orlando AFB under command of the 4504 MTW from 1956 until 1966, when the MGM-13A was phased out and the remaining CGM-13Bs were transferred to the Lowry Technical Training Center at Lowry AFB, Colorado.

The U.S. Army had largely assumed the tactical ground launched nuclear missile program until the 1980s when TAC&#x27;s BGM-109G &quot;Gryphon&quot; ground launched cruise missile (GLCM) was deployed along with the Army&#x27;s Pershing II ballistic missile to counter the mobile medium- and intermediate- range ballistic nuclear missiles deployed by the Soviet Union in Eastern Bloc countries. This entire class of weaponry was eliminated by the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF treaty) and removed by 1990, thus reducing both the number and the threat of nuclear warheads.

=== Cuban Missile Crisis ===

The Cold War took on a frightening phase in October 1962. Following the Bay of Pigs fiasco, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev increased Soviet aid to Cuba, including military supplies. In August 1962, the Soviet Union, with Cuban cooperation, began to build intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) and medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM) sites on the island. The American intelligence community, suspicious of the construction on the island, needed tangible proof that Soviet ballistic missiles were being deployed to Cuba and called for photographic aerial reconnaissance.

Routine photo reconnaissance flights over Cuba revealed that the Soviet Union was, in fact, in the process of placing nuclear-armed missiles on that island. In response, the United States let it be known that any use of those missiles against any country in the Western Hemisphere would be considered as an attack on the United States and a full nuclear response on the Soviet Union would be the result. The United States and the Soviet Union stood eyeball to eyeball at the brink of a nuclear exchange.

====Photographic Reconnaissance====

On 11 October 1962, Headquarters Strategic Air Command (SAC) notified the 4080th Strategic Wing at Laughlin AFB, Texas, to &quot;freeze&quot; two officers, Major Richard S. Heyser and Major Rudolf Anderson, Jr., for a special project. The pair reported to Edwards AFB, California, where they received orders to conduct strategic reconnaissance flights over Cuba. On 13 October, Major Anderson deployed to McCoy AFB, Florida, to join a U-2 aircraft ferried in for the special mission. Meantime, Major Heyser launched from Edwards AFB in a U-2 equipped to photograph suspect sites on the island of Cuba. Heyser arrived over the island during daylight on 14 October and the next day, Major Anderson made his first flight from McCoy AFB. Photographs obtained on these flights confirmed that Soviet/Cuban crews had launch pads under construction that, when completed, could fire nuclear-armed IRBMs with a range of approximately 5,000 miles and MRBMs with a range of approximately 3,000 miles.

While the SAC U-2s flew high-altitude reconnaissance missions, the staff of the 363d Tactical Reconnaissance Wing at Shaw AFB, South Carolina, was made aware of the potential need for low-level flights over Cuba. Mission planners at Shaw began planning such flights and preparing target folders. On 21 October, HQ Tactical Air Command ordered the 363d to deploy to MacDill AFB, Florida. The wing began immediately to move RF-101 Voodoo and RB-66 Destroyer aircraft, personnel, and photographic equipment to Florida. By the next morning, the aircraft were at MacDill, cameras cocked, ready to carry out any reconnaissance missions.

SAC and TAC reconnaissance aircraft were further augmented by reconnaissance aircraft of the U.S. Navy. RF-8A Crusader photo reconnaissance aircraft Light Photographic Squadron SIX TWO (VFP-62) operating from NAS Jacksonville and NAS Key West, Florida conducted high-speed low level reconnaissance flights over the Cuban missile sites while additional P-2 Neptune and P-3 Orion maritime patrol aircraft operating from various bases tracked Soviet ships and submarines transiting to and from Cuba.
While aircrews went on alert, support personnel expanded the base photo laboratory facilities and installed additional photo vans and darkrooms. Because of a shortage of adequate facilities, aircrews and other airmen occupied temporary, inadequate, wooden barracks that hampered crew rest. After trying off-base housing, the aircrews moved to permanent airmen&#x27;s quarters on the base for the remainder of the deployment. On 26 October, the 363rd launched the first flight of two low-level reconnaissance RF-101 aircraft. For the next three weeks, wing aircraft, by photographic and visual reconnaissance, gathered vital data, including prestrike intelligence, air-surveillance verification of Cuban buildup, and subsequent dismantling of the IRBM and MRBM sites and Soviet Ilyushin Il-28 jet tactical bombers. Because of the possibility of alternate sites and concealed storage facilities, the wing initiated intensive low-level aerial search efforts. Other flights returned with highly significant photographs of missiles and related equipment on docks at Cuban ports, the loading of Soviet freighters, and the deck cargo of Soviet ships entering and leaving Cuban ports. Consequently, the President of the United States was constantly aware of Soviet actions regarding the withdrawal of the missiles from Cuba.

Analysis of the 363d photographs provided a wide range of essential intelligence concerning Cuba. Frequent sorties over major Cuban airfields provided daily information on the number, type, and specific location of Cuban aircraft. Photos also revealed the number and location of assembled, partially assembled, or unassembled IL-28 Soviet twin-engine tactical bombers with a range of 1,500 miles. This information was vital to establish immediate air superiority if strike forces went into action. On one of these missions, the 363d discovered the first evidence of the existence of infrared homing air-to-air missiles (Soviet AA-2s). Surface-to-air missile (SAM) sites proved to be prime targets for low-level reconnaissance missions. The wing also garnered extensive intelligence concerning Cuban ground equipment, military encampments, cruise-missile sites, and possible landing beaches for amphibious assault by U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps forces.

====Tactical Air Command combat aircraft deployment to Florida bases====
SAC ordered continual U-2 reconnaissance flights over Cuba and, at the same time, ordered the redeployment of its medium and heavy bombers and tanker aircraft from its three Florida bases, MacDill AFB, McCoy AFB and Homestead AFB, in order to make room for TAC fighter aircraft. In mid-October, the Nineteenth Air Force (19AF) moved from its home base of Seymour Johnson AFB, North Carolina, to Homestead AFB, Florida. Once at Homestead AFB, 19AF spearheaded the deployment of TAC units at the beginning of the Cuban Missile Crisis, deploying numerous F-84, F-100, F-105, RB-66, and KB-50 units and aircraft to the SAC bases in Florida.

19AF&#x27;s commander headed the main air operations center, the Air Force Atlantic Advanced Operational Nucleus (ADVON). Augmented by airmen and officers from other TAC air forces, Air Force Atlantic ADVON soon controlled nearly 1,000 aircraft and 7,000 men and women. During the Cuban Missile Crisis four primary Air Elements were organized and postured in Florida. Air Force record cards and historical records contain the following information:

* HQ, Air Force Provisional 33 (Fighter Recon). Organized at Homestead AFB and assigned to TAC, with attachment to Air Force Atlantic (Main). The Air Division Provisional 1, 2, and 3 were assigned as elements at the same time.
* HQ, Air Division Provisional 1 was organized at Homestead AFB and assigned to the Air Force Provisional 33 (Fighter Reconnaissance). On 29 Oct 1962, the division was relieved from assignment to Air Force Provisional 33 and assigned directly to TAC. At the same time, it was attached to the Air Force Atlantic (ADVON). Serving in the division were deployed elements of the following wings:
:: 31st Tactical Fighter Wing (F-100), Homestead AFB Florida, 24 Oct-9 Nov 1962
:: 401st Tactical Fighter Wing (F-100), England AFB, Louisiana, 24 Oct-9 Nov 1962
:: 474th Tactical Fighter Wing (F-100), Cannon AFB, New Mexico, 24 Oct-9 Nov 1962
: Altogether, the 1st Provisional Air Division included a force of 181 F-100 fighter aircraft and over 1,600 personnel.
* HQ, Air Division Provisional 2 was also organized at McCoy AFB, Florida, and assigned to AF Prov 33 (Ftr Recon). On 29 Oct 1962, the division was relieved from assignment to 33 AF Prov 33 (Ftr Recon) and assigned directly to TAC, with attachment to AF Atlantic (ADVON).
:: 4th Tactical Fighter Wing (F-105), Seymour Johnson AFB, North Carolina, 21 Oct-c. 29 Nov 1962
:: 354th Tactical Fighter Wing (F-100), Myrtle Beach AFB, South Carolina, 21 Oct–1 Dec 1962
:: 427th Air Refueling Squadron: (20 KB-50J Superfortress), Langley AFB, Virginia
* HQ, Air Division Provisional 3 was organized at MacDill AFB, Florida, and assigned to AF Prov 33 (Ftr Recon). On 29 Oct 1962, the division was relieved from assignment to 33 AF Prov 33 (Ftr Recon) and assigned directly to TAC, with attachment to AF Atlantic (ADVON).
:: 12th Tactical Fighter Wing (F-84F), MacDill AFB, Florida
:: 15th Tactical Fighter Wing (F-84F), MacDill AFB, Florida
:: 27th Tactical Fighter Wing (F-100), Cannon AFB, New Mexico, 21 Oct-1 Dec 1962
:: 363d Tactical Reconnaissance Wing (RF-101), (RB-66), Shaw AFB, South Carolina, 21 Oct-30 Nov 1962

Civilian airports in West Palm Beach, Fort Lauderdale and Miami, Florida also received TAC Units.

Like the Navy&#x27;s RF-8A Crusaders, TAC RF-101 Voodoo reconnaissance aircraft from Shaw AFB continued to fly high speed low level sorties over Cuba on a daily basis, photographing suspected missile sites and Cuban military bases. In some cases the films were flown directly to Washington, D.C., and onto President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s desk within hours of being taken.

General Walter C. Sweeney, Jr., Commander of Tactical Air Command, proposed an operational plan which called first for an air attack on the surface-to-air missile (SAM) sites in the vicinity of known medium range (MRBM) and intermediate range ballistic missile (IRBM) launchers by eight fighter-bombers per SAM site. Concurrently, each of the Cuban MiG airfields thought to be protecting MRBM/IRBM sites were to be struck by at least twelve fighters. Following the air-strikes on SAM sites and MiG fighter airfields, each MRBM and IRBM launch site was to be attacked by at least twelve aircraft. General Sweeney&#x27;s plan was accepted and, additionally, Cuban Ilyushin Il-28 &quot;Beagle&quot; bombers bases were added to the target list.

====Crisis resolution====

While the invasion forces gathered in Florida, Kennedy ordered the U.S. State Department to develop a plan for civil governance in Cuba. Former Secretary of State Dean Acheson and the Joint Chiefs of Staff favored an invasion, but U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy vehemently opposed that plan and instead advocated a blockade. The President listened to his brother, and on 22 October 1962, appeared on television to explain to America and the world that the United States was imposing a strict quarantine on offensive military equipment being shipped to Cuba. Kennedy also warned Khrushchev that the United States would regard any missile attack from Cuba as an attack from the Soviet Union and would retaliate against the Soviet Union.

The quarantine began on 24 October and tensions mounted as the Soviets continued to work on the missile sites and their ships continued moving toward Cuba. Then on 26 October, Khrushchev sent another message in which he offered to withdraw or destroy the weapons in Cuba, provided the United States would lift the blockade and promise not to invade the island. The increasing tempo in the military, however, continued unabated. SAC ordered over sixty B-52 bombers to continue on airborne alert, while TAC forces in Florida assumed a one-hour alert and prepared to go to a fifteen-minute alert, which involved pilots waiting in aircraft for launch orders.

After a heated debate Robert Kennedy met with the Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Anatoly Dobrynin, and in effect, promised to remove obsolete American PGM-19 Jupiter MRBMs from Turkey. This promise was sufficient and the next day the Soviet Union informed the United States that the missiles in Cuba would be withdrawn. The Soviets began turning their ships around, packing up the missiles in Cuba, and dismantling the launch pads. As the work progressed, the Air Force started to redeploy aircraft back to home bases and lower the alert status. The United States and Soviet Union stepped back from the brink, and the crisis was resolved without armed conflict. Never in the history of the Cold War had the United States and the Soviet Union come so very close to mutual nuclear destruction.

===New Aircraft===
In 1962, the Air Force commenced evaluation of the US Navy/US Marine Corps F-4 Phantom II as a possible replacement for older fighter aircraft in the counter-air, interdiction and close air support (CAS) roles. In January 1962, two Navy F4H-1 aircraft were loaned to USAF and, since the 18 September 1962 naming convention for all DoD aircraft had not yet taken effect, were given the interim designation of F-110A Spectre. Twenty-four additional USN F4H-1 aircraft, subsequently redesignated as F-4Bs, were loaned to USAF for additional evaluation. This evaluation resulted in a USAF decision to acquire their own version of the F-4, designated as the F-4C. Following its initial flight in May 1963, the F-4C entered USAF service with TAC in November 1963. The F-4 would prove to be one of the most numerous jet fighters ever operated by USAF, with over 2800 examples acquired for service in TAC, USAFE, PACAF and the Air Force Systems Command (AFSC), to include later versions such as the RF-4C, F-4D, F-4E and F-4G.

In 1960, DoD also combined a USAF requirement for a new fighter-bomber to ostensibly replace TAC&#x27;s F-105 fighter-bombers with a USN need for a new carrier-based air superiority fighter, then launched a competition among aircraft manufacturers for the final design. In 1962, General Dynamics and Boeing were selected as finalists with the General Dynamics variable-geometry wing Tactical Fighter Experimental (TFX) design eventually winning out. Designated as the F-111, the Navy version was known as the F-111B and the USAF version the F-111A, with the first flight of the F-111A taking place in December 1964 and the first production models delivered to the USAF in 1967. Additional variants such as the FB-111A for SAC and the F-111E, F-111F and EF-111A for TAC and USAFE, plus the F-111K for the RAAF followed. Meanwhile, the Navy&#x27;s F-111B program was canceled after five examples when it became apparent that its performance characteristics were unsuitable for an aircraft-carrier based fighter and interceptor, with many of its design features and systems being incorporated into the successful Grumman F-14 Tomcat. In all, 562 F-111s of all series were built.

USAF also acquired a number of other USN aircraft originally designed for aircraft carrier use and pressed them into USAF service. This included the transfer of the piston-engine Douglas A-1 Skyraider in its A-1E and A-1H variants being retired from the Navy inventory in the mid-1960s for close air support, rescue aircraft escort, and special operations duties in Vietnam, as well as the Navy&#x27;s LTV A-7 Corsair II light attack bomber in new production numbers, the USAF versions of which were designated A-7D and A-7K.

In the case of the A-7, the USAF was initially reluctant to take on yet another Navy-designed aircraft, but on 5 November 1965, Secretary of the Air Force Harold Brown and Chief of Staff of the Air Force, General John P. McConnell, announced that USAF had decided to order a version of the aircraft, designated A-7D, for TAC. The first A-7D made its initial flight in April 1968, and deliveries of production models began in December 1968. When A-7D production ended in 1976, LTV had delivered 459 to the U.S. Air Force. These aircraft continued in TAC service until supplanted by F-16 Fighting Falcon or A-10 Thunderbolt II aircraft. Most A-7Ds and all A-7Ks were later transferred to Air National Guard (ANG) units operationally-gained by TAC, remaining in ANG service until 1993 when they, too, were replaced by the F-16 or A-10.

=== Pacific Air Forces and the Vietnam War ===



During the tenure of the Kennedy Administration, as an additional background to the Cold War there was the onset of low intensity guerrilla wars and wars of insurgency with proxies of the Soviet Union. During 1963, the situation in South Vietnam was heating up on a daily basis and more and more &quot;military advisors&quot; were being sent to that small country in Southeast Asia.

==== Special Operations Units ====
Air Force Special Forces units became part of TAC in 1961 when a counter-insurgency force was activated at Eglin AFB, Florida. Aircraft of these units consisted of a combination of propeller-driven World War II and Korean War-vintage fighters, modified trainers, Douglas B-26 Invader attack bombers and an eclectic collection of cargo and utility aircraft. Originally activated as a Combat Crew Training Squadron, the unit was upgraded to a wing and designated as the 1st Air Commando Wing. In 1964, TAC ordered a squadron of specially modified C-130E aircraft to support U.S. Army Special Forces and Central Intelligence Agency teams operating deep inside enemy territory. As the war in Vietnam intensified, additional air commando units were organized in Southeast Asia. In 1968, these units were redesignated as &quot;Special Operations&quot; squadrons.

====Tactical Fighters====
In response to what has become known as the Gulf of Tonkin incident in 1964, TAC pilots and support personnel found themselves deployed to places like Da Nang AB and Phan Rang AB in South Vietnam and Takhli RTAFB and Korat RTAFB in Thailand. Initially, TAC began deploying squadrons of F-100 Super Sabre, RF-101 Voodoo and F-105 Thunderchief aircraft to these overseas installations under the cognizance of PACAF. As the American effort in Southeast Asia increased, TAC used a process of deploying squadrons to PACAF-operated bases in South Vietnam and Thailand, with the squadrons being attached temporarily on rotational deployments or being permanently reassigned to the PACAF wing.

For the next decade, TAC would be consumed by operations in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. On a daily basis, flight crews trained by TAC would hurl themselves and their planes at targets across the area of operations, to include over the skies of North Vietnam. As the command responsible for training aircrews for overseas duty, TAC maintained Readiness Training Units in the United States to train pilots and other aircrew members for fighters, reconnaissance and troop carrier (redesignated tactical airlift after 1 July 1966) squadrons in the Pacific.

====Troop Carrier====
In December 1964, TAC deployed a squadron of C-123 Provider assault transports from the 464th Troop Carrier Wing at Pope AFB, North Carolina to Clark Air Base, Philippines, then on to Tan Son Nhut Air Base, South Vietnam to set up a tactical air cargo transportation system.

To support the increased military strength in Southeast Asia, TAC also began deploying its C-130 equipped troop carrier (later re-designated tactical airlift) squadrons to bases in Okinawa and the Philippines. In late 1965, TAC transferred two C-130 wings and two additional squadrons, a total of eight squadrons, to PACAF&#x27;s 315th Air Division for operations in Southeast Asia.

==== 1972 Spring Invasion ====

In 1970, the war was beginning to wind down as the conflict was being Vietnamized. Units from the Republic of Vietnam Air Force (VNAF) took on more and more combat to defend their nation and USAF tactical air strength was reduced as several air bases and, in some cases, formerly USAF aircraft, were turned over to the VNAF.

Bombing of North Vietnam (Operation Rolling Thunder) had ended in 1968, and as a result, North Vietnamese forces had built up their air defenses and continued to pour men and equipment into the South via the Ho Chi Minh trail. By the beginning of 1972 there were only about 235 USAF tactical combat aircraft in Southeast Asia. Vietnamization was severely tested by the Easter Offensive of 1972, a massive conventional invasion of South Vietnam by North Vietnamese Army forces in spring 1972. On 30 March 1972, the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN) launched an all out invasion of South Vietnam with over 13 divisions, pushing South Vietnamese units aside with little difficulty. President Nixon stepped up air strikes to turn back the invasion, or at least to slow it down.

In response to the invasion, TAC deployed both squadrons and wings to air bases in Thailand. Known units deployed were:
* Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base
: 8th Tactical Fighter Squadron, Eglin AFB, Florida (F-4E)
: 414th Fighter Weapons Squadron, Nellis AFB, Nevada (F-4E)
* Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base
: 4th Tactical Fighter Wing, Seymour Johnson AFB, North Carolina (F-4D)
* Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base
: 49th Tactical Fighter Wing, Holloman AFB, New Mexico (F-4D)

By October 1972, the effect of the air campaign was being felt in North Vietnam. North Vietnamese delegates returned to the bargaining table in Paris to engage in peace talks in a serious manner. Besides the pressure from USAF, USN and USMC tactical fighters, fighter-bombers and fighter aircraft, as well as USAF B-52 bombers, the political climate in Moscow and Peking had changed to encourage the North Vietnamese to agree to a settlement.

==== Uneasy Peace 1973 ====
On 27 January 1973, the Paris Peace Accords were signed with an effective date of 28 January 1973. For TAC, the war in Southeast Asia (SEA) was almost over. With the official end of hostilities came the long-awaited release of American Prisoners of War from inside North Vietnam. The last USAF aircraft left South Vietnam at the end of January 1973, and the final group of American Prisoners of War were released from North Vietnam on 29 March 1973.

The accords effectively ended United States military operations in North and South Vietnam. Laos and Cambodia, however, were not signatories to the Paris agreement and remained in states of war with their internal rebel forces.

The United States was helping the Royal Laotian government achieve whatever advantage possible before working out a settlement with the Laotian communists and their allies. The USAF flew combat sorties over Laos during January and February 1973. On 17 April, the USAF flew its last mission over Laos, working a handful of targets requested by the Laotian government.

In Cambodia, there was no peace in 1973. Local communist insurgents of the Khmer Rouge kept up their attacks on the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, so the Cambodian Government urgently called upon the U.S. for help and the USAF in Thailand was ordered to carry out a massive bombing campaign against the insurgents on the outskirts of the city. The Cambodian Army would attempt to attack Khmer Rouge forces, however the rebels would simply slip away and move somewhere else. This tactic effectively succeeded in wearing down the government forces. In July and August 1973, the Khmer Rouge focused on taking Phanom Penh and other major cities. In addition, it was reported that the Khmer Rouge was utilizing tear gas in its attacks.

Congressional pressure in Washington grew against these bombings, and on 30 June 1973, the United States Congress passed public law PL 93-50 and 93-52, which cut off all funds for combat in Cambodia and all of Indochina effective 15 August 1973. Air strikes by the USAF peaked just before the deadline, as the Cambodian Army engaged a force of about 10,000 Khmer Rouge rebels that encircled Phnom Penh.

The last shot fired in anger in Southeast Asia was by a TAC A-7D Corsair II of the TAC deployed 354th Tactical Fighter Wing, based at Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base over the suburbs of Phnom Penh. By the end of 1975, all TAC units and aircraft were withdrawn from Southeast Asia.

===Post-Vietnam era===
Hard lessons had been learned during the Vietnam War. New methods of projecting global air power had been perfected and several new types of aircraft were developed as a result of some of the lessons and shortcomings that had been learned in the skies over Hanoi.

The first of these was the F-15 Eagle, an optimized air superiority fighter to replace the F-4 Phantom II in counter-air and the F-106 Delta Dart in air defense roles and would not engage in multi-mission air-to-ground roles. Following operational test and evaluation, the first F-15A was delivered to TAC&#x27;s 1st Tactical Fighter Wing at Langley AFB, Virginia in November 1974. Training on the new type, which also included twin seat F-15B versions, began at once.

The A-10 Thunderbolt II, optimized as a close air support aircraft with emphasis on being able to defeat Soviet armor in the event of a Soviet/Warsaw Pact invasion of Western Europe, began arriving in March 1977 at Myrtle Beach AFB, South Carolina, equipping the 354th Tactical Fighter Wing.

Finally, the F-16 Fighting Falcon, later nicknamed the &quot;Viper,&quot; also entered the Air Force inventory, initially assigned to the 388th Tactical Fighter Wing at Hill AFB, Utah in January 1979. With the cost of acquiring the F-15 continuing to escalate in the early and mid-1970s, the F-16 was the successful design of the USAF Lightweight Fighter (LWF) competition, increasing overall USAF tactical fighter numbers with a multi-mission fighter that could replace those F-4 Phantom IIs not replaced by the F-15 in the air-to-air role and being able to concurrently assumed the F-4&#x27;s role in air-to-ground / interdiction roles.

====Divestment of Tactical Airlift====
It was found during the Vietnam War that there was a large duplication of aerial port facilities and mission objectives between MAC, TAC and PACAF. A study group recommended the consolidation of all tactical airlift forces under MAC as a cost-saving measure under MAC and on 1 December 1974 all TAC and TAC-gained AFRES and ANG C-130 tactical airlift wings, groups and squadrons were reassigned to MAC. In 1975, PACAF and USAFE tactical airlift wings were also reassigned to MAC, thus ending the theater troop carrier mission as it had existed since the beginning of World War II.

==== Inactivation of Aerospace Defense Command and assumption of the Continental Air Defense mission ====

In early 1977, strong congressional pressure to reduce USAF management &quot;overhead&quot;, and the personal conviction of the Air Force Chief of Staff that substantial savings could be realized without a reduction in operational capability, resulted in the disestablishment of Aerospace Defense Command (ADC) as a USAF major command.

ADC was inactivated on 1 October 1979, with its &quot;atmospheric&quot; resources e.g., its Regular Air Force and Air National Guard F-101, F-102 and F-106 fighter-interceptors; ground-based warning radars; and associated bases and personnel) subsequently transferred to TAC under a sub-entity named Air Defense, Tactical Air Command (ADTAC). ADC&#x27;s EC-121 Warning Star airborne early warning aircraft had already been retired by 1978 and it never received that aircraft&#x27;s replacement, the E-3 Sentry AWACS, that began entering the TAC inventory in 1977. As a result of changes in USAF doctrine and tactics, AWACS was always intended as strictly a TAC airframe nominally operating from forward-deployed locations and incorporating many of the lessons learned from employing the EC-121 in its Big Eye, College Eye, Rivet Top and Disco roles with PACAF&#x27;s 7th Air Force during the Vietnam War.

The new command was, essentially, a transition organization between ADC, and the transfer of the continental air defense mission from a combination of the Regular Air Force and the Air National Guard to one totally residing in TAC-gained assets of the Air National Guard by 1990.

==== Red Flag Aggressor training ====

The 57th Fighter Weapons Wing at Nellis AFB, Nevada began giving Regular Air Force units some of the most intense combat training ever achieved through the Red Flag program, beginning in 1976. This would later expand to include the Air Force Reserve, the Air National Guard, aviation squadrons of the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps (augmenting their Naval Fighter Weapons School / TOPGUN program), and various NATO and Allied nations.

The origin of Red Flag was the unacceptable performance of U.S. Air Force pilots and weapon systems officers in air combat maneuvering (ACM) (air-to-air combat) during the Vietnam War in comparison to previous wars. Air combat over North Vietnam between 1965 and 1973 led to an overall exchange ratio (ratio of enemy aircraft shot down to the number of own aircraft lost to enemy fighters) of 2.2:1. In fact, for a period of time in June and July 1972 during Operation Linebacker, the ratio was less than 1:1.

The aggressor units at Red Flag were originally equipped with readily available T-38 Talon aircraft loaned from the Air Training Command (ATC) to simulate the Soviet Union&#x27;s MiG-21. Northrop F-5 Tiger II fighters, painted in color schemes commonly found on Soviet and Warsaw Pact aircraft, were added shortly thereafter and became the mainstay until the F-16 was introduced in the mid/late 1980s.

The Red Flag exercises, conducted in four to six cycles per year by the 414th Combat Training Squadron evolved into very realistic large scale aerial war games, the purpose being to train pilots and navigators/weapon systems officers/electronic warfare officers and air battle managers from the U.S., NATO and other allied countries for real combat situations. This includes the use of &quot;enemy&quot; hardware and live ammunition for bombing exercises within the Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR).

==== Operation Eagle Claw and divestment of USAF Special Operations forces ====
 
In 1978, the unrest in Iran against the pro-U.S. monarch, Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, and his autocratic rule boiled over into a revolution. In January 1979, the Shah fled Iran to exile in Egypt and Iran was turned into an &quot;Islamic Republic.&quot; On 22 October 1979, the Shah was allowed to travel to the United States for further medical treatment, causing widespread anger in Iran. Furious at what was called &quot;evidence of American plotting&quot; by the Iranian revolutionaries, the American Embassy in Tehran was taken over by a group of armed revolutionaries in violation of accepted diplomatic practices and international law, with the entire staff becoming hostages. While the situation was trying to be resolved through diplomatic means, no real progress was gained for the release of the hostages. In a bold plan, U.S. military forces were instructed to come up with a course of action to go into Iran and free the hostages by force of arms.

In April 1980, TAC air assets were deployed to areas close to Iran to be ready if and when Washington gave the &quot;GO&quot; signal. Operation Eagle Claw got underway on 24 April 1980 when USAF special operations MC-130 Combat Talon transport planes and Navy RH-53D Sea Stallion helicopters with Marine Corps flight crews deployed to Desert One, a small staging site inside Iran itself.

From the start, it appeared that the operation was running into problems. After launching from the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz (CVN-68), an unforeseen low-level sandstorm, also known as a haboob, caused two of eight helicopters to lose their way en route to Desert One, but only after men and equipment had been assembled there. A third helicopter suffered a mechanical failure and was incapable of continuing with the mission. Without enough helicopters to transport men and equipment to Desert Two, the mission was aborted. After the decision to abort the mission was made, one of the helicopters lost control while taking off and crashed into one of the MC-130s. In the ensuing explosion and fire, eight US servicemen were killed: five USAF aircrew in the MC-130, and three USMC aircrew in the RH-53. During the evacuation, six RH-53 helicopters were left behind intact.

The failure of the various services to work together with cohesion forced the establishment of new organizational structures within the services and eventually a new multi-service organization. In 1984, TAC transferred all of it special operations units, aircraft and personnel to Military Airlift Command (MAC) concurrent with MAC&#x27;s establishment of 23rd Air Force as a dedicated organization for USAF special operations forces. This organization formed the foundation for what would later become Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) in 1987. Also in 1987, the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) was established at MacDill AFB, Florida as a joint-service force to coordinate the special operations forces for the Army, Navy and Air Force, with AFSOC as its USAF component command.

==== USAF Thunderbirds ====
For most of its history, the USAF Air Demonstration Squadron (USAF ADS), better known as the Thunderbirds, had flown front-line fighter aircraft, having been part of TAC since they moved to Nellis AFB, Nevada in the mid-1950s. In 1969, the team switched aircraft from the F-100 Super Sabre to the F-4 Phantom II. However, due to the 1973 oil crisis, the team only flew six air shows and was grounded for some time. In 1974, the Thuunderbirds switched to the more economical T-38 Talon advanced jet trainer. The rationale for the change to a trainer was purely economical in an era of post-Vietnam fiscal austerity, since five T-38s used the same amount of fuel needed for one F-4 Phantom II. The switch to the T-38 also saw an alteration of the team&#x27;s flight routine to exhibit the aircraft&#x27;s maneuverability in tight turns.

In January 1982, a devastating accident during a training flight claimed the lives of four USAF ADS pilots at their primary practice facility, Indian Springs Air Force Auxiliary Field, northwest of Nellis AFB. While practicing the four-plane diamond loop, the formation impacted the ground at high speed, instantly killing all four pilots. The cause of the crash was officially listed as a result of pilot error by Thunderbird #1, the team leader, as he misjudged the proper altitude to execute the loop. The other three aircraft, following proper procedure, were looking at the Lead&#x27;s aircraft, rather than the ground, and followed the Lead aircraft into the ground. The airshow season for that year was canceled and it was also decided to equip the squadron with the Block 15 F-16A/B Fighting Falcon and start over for 1983. In 1992, the squadron was upgraded to the Block 32 F-16C/D, and in 2009 to the Block 52 F-16C/D.

==== Fourth generation jet fighter aircraft ====

The late 1970s through 1992 were a transition era for most TAC fighter wings, replacing their third generation Vietnam-Era fighter and attack aircraft such as the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, General Dynamics F-111, and LTV A-7 Corsair II with fourth generation fighter aircraft like the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle, General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon and Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II). The F-15A/B and subsequent F-15C/D were designed for the air superiority role, which was not really filled since the North American F-86 Sabre entered the USAF inventory in the 1950s. Conversely, the F-16 was designed for a multi-mission fighter-bomber role, replacing the F-4D/Es, while the A-10 was designed to fill the close air support mission of the A-7D.

Although developed and initially deployed in the late 1970s, budgetary constraints limited their deployment into the active duty forces. The Reagan Administration embarked on a massive overhaul of the United States armed forces and large numbers of these aircraft were ordered and deployed to front line active duty Air Force wings beginning in 1983.

The upgrade was not limited to first line USAF units, as beginning in 1985, Air National Guard (ANG) and Air Force Reserve (AFRES) units also began trading in their Vietnam Era aircraft for newer and more sophisticated weapons systems with F-16A/Bs being allocated to Guard and Reserve units as active duty Air Force units upgraded to the F-16C/Ds models. F-15A/B models of the 1970s were also provided to ANG squadrons when newer F-15C/D models reached front-line wings. As A-10s replaced A-7s, A-37s and OV-10s in the Regular Air Force, the A-7 and A-37 close air support aircraft, along with newly produced twin-seat A-7Ks, were flown by many ANG squadrons, often training with both Regular Army and Army National Guard combat units in ground support operations. The last A-7D/Ks were retired in 1993, being replaced in the ANG by A-10s and F-16C/Ds.

In 1984, a new version of the 1960s General Dynamics F-111 also began equipping select TAC and USAFE units. This version, known as the EF-111A Raven, was modified to carry electronic jamming units, its sole purpose being to fly into enemy airspace and confuse enemy radar so that the strike package could follow and accomplish the mission, replacing the venerable Douglas RB/EB-66 of the 1950s and 1960s that served in the Vietnam War.

A new version of the F-15, the F-15E Strike Eagle, was also developed to replace the F-111E/F tactical strike aircraft in TAC&#x27;s and USAFE&#x27;s arsenal. Developed from the twin-seat F-15B, the Strike Eagle was designed for long-range interdiction of enemy ground targets deep behind enemy lines while concurrently retaining air-to-air combat capability. The first F-15Es were deployed to the 4th Tactical Fighter Wing at Seymour Johnson AFB, North Carolina on 29 December 1988.

Across the Nevada desert skies in the 1980s, there were reports of strange lights in the night skies, with some of these reports explained as possible UFOs. Most of these reports seem to come from the area around Tonopah and another area identified on maps as Nellis AFB&#x27;s Area 51. The UFO story seemed to hold water, as the USAF radars at Nellis and FAA radars at Las Vegas could not see any aircraft in the area of question. The strange lights over the Nevada desert were officially recognized in November 1988 when the Department of Defense unveiled the F-117 Nighthawk stealth aircraft, an outgrowth of USAF&#x27;s Have Blue reduced radar cross-section (RCS) research aircraft. Although ostensibly designated as a &quot;fighter,&quot; the F-117 was actually a precision light bomber with no air-to-air combat capability.

The F-117 was a well-kept secret throughout the 1980s. The first prototype aircraft had first flown in 1981 and one had crashed in June 1984 in the Nevada desert. It took another crash of the aircraft in California in 1988 to finally lift the veil of secrecy. On 9 May 1992, four Lockheed F-117A Nighthawks from the Tonopah Test Range Airport, Nevada, arrived at Holloman AFB, New Mexico and were assigned to the 49th Tactical Fighter Wing.

==== Collapse of the Warsaw Pact ====
One of the effects of this massive buildup of American military might during the 1980s was pressure inside of the Soviet Union to match the United States. However, internal pressures inside the Soviet Union for increased freedoms, along with economic pressures led to the loosening of their control in Eastern Europe. In 1989, one by one of these nations in Eastern Europe began to rebel against their Communist governments, leading to the opening of the Berlin Wall in November. The mighty Warsaw Pact as well as the Soviet Union was crumbling from within.

It was clear that the threat the western democracies faced in Europe was coming to an end as the Soviet Union imploded from within. As a result of the end of Cold War tensions, the United States began a period of downsizing the military. The Base Realignment and Closure (or BRAC) process was developed in an attempt to achieve the government&#x27;s goal of closing and realigning military installations.

Through the BRAC process, numerous active duty, Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve bases and stations were marked for closing and units were inactivated. Beginning in 1988, some units became what were called &quot;Super Wings,&quot; comprising more than one unit and aircraft type, along with several different missions. With all of the cutbacks it seemed that any type of major armed conflict was a thing of the past.

=== Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm ===
In 1980, Tactical Air Command units of TAC&#x27;s Ninth Air Force were allocated to President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s Rapid Deployment Force, formally known as the Rapid Deployment Joint Task Force (RDJTF). In 1983, the RDJTF became a separate unified command known as the United States Central Command (USCENTCOM), focusing on the Middle East. Ninth Air Force, headquartered at Shaw AFB, South Carolina, provided the aircraft, personnel and materiel to form United States Central Command Air Forces (CENTAF), the USAF component command of USCENTCOM, which was also headquartered at Shaw AFB as a combined organization with 9th Air Force. Starting in 1981, Ninth Air Force aircraft and personnel were deployed to Egypt for Exercise BRIGHT STAR, an evolution that would continue biennially for the rest of the decade.

On 2 August 1990, ground forces of Iraq invaded Kuwait without warning. President George H. W. Bush proclaimed that the situation was not tolerable and with that he drew a what was referred to as &quot;a line in the sand.&quot; The United States took their case to the United Nations, and the UN in turn condemned the actions of Iraq and proclaimed that they must withdraw. Iraq refused to withdraw from the small country, claiming it as being part of their sovereign territory. The United States, now backed by United Nations mandates, again told the Iraqi leadership to withdraw or suffer the results of continued aggression.

In response to the invasion, the largest military buildup since the Vietnam War commenced. By 15 August, the 1 TFW had deployed F-15Cs and F-15Ds in a fifteen-hour non-stop flight from their home station at Langley AFB, Virginia to Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. They were standing alert within hours of their arrival and Operation Desert Shield was underway.

By January 1991, numerous of TAC combat squadrons had been deployed as part of Desert Shield. Diplomacy had failed to resolve the situation and Iraq had been given the ultimatum, &quot;...get out of Kuwait or suffer the wrath of the United Nations Coalition.&quot; Leaders from Iraq proclaimed that if the UN forces crossed into Iraqi territory they would suffer the &quot;Mother of all battles,&quot; and as the deadline came and passed, there was no movement of Iraqi forces that indicated a pullback.

In the early morning hours of 17 January 1991, anti-aircraft batteries in Baghdad erupted as the first strikes by F-117A Nighthawks hit critical command and control targets in the Iraqi capital. Operation Desert Storm had begun.

During the next few hours, USAF tactical air assets, along with U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, Royal Air Force, French Air Force, Royal Saudi Air Force and Free Kuwait Air Force tactical aircraft, pounded command and control facilities, bridges, and other lines of communication. USAF Wild Weasel F-4Gs went after Iraqi SAM sites like they had in Vietnam, while USAF A-10s hunted Iraqi tanks and troops. In the first three days of the air war, eleven Iraqi aircraft were shot down by USAF F-15Cs.

During the six-week air war, any and all Iraqi military assets were targeted by Coalition attack aircraft. The Iraqis responded by launching Soviet-built SCUD ballistic missiles against targets in Israel and the Arabian peninsula. With no accurate guidance system, the SCUD missies were very similar to the German V-2 rocket when it came to hitting a specific target. SCUDs that launched returned to earth with a chance of hitting something in the general area that it was pointed at. Classified as a terror weapon, the SCUDs became a top priority for TAC, USN/USMC and Coalition aircraft to find the mobile launching sites and destroy them.

The ground war began in late February 1991 and lasted approximately 100 hours. TAC close air support A-10 aircraft supported ground forces as they had trained for in the United States and Europe for well over a decade. Military planners and Washington officials were correct when they proclaimed that the war in the desert would &quot;...not be another Viet Nam,&quot; and Desert Storm would go into the history books as one of TAC&#x27;s most shining moments.

=== Inactivation of Tactical Air Command and establishment of Air Combat Command ===
Operation Desert Storm was also the swan song for Tactical Air Command. The planning and execution of the mission was the result of 45 years of TAC being honed into one of the most effective military organizations in history. Following the 1991 Gulf War and the end of the Cold War, U.S. military planners perceived a serious blurring between the responsibilities of TAC and SAC. The collapse of the former Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War led senior defense planners to conclude that the structure of the military establishment which had evolved during the Cold War years was not suited to the new world situation. As shown by Desert Shield / Desert Storm, U.S. military forces would increasingly be called upon to participate in smaller-scale regional contingencies and humanitarian operations.

In a post-Cold War / post-Desert Storm environment, General Merrill A. McPeak, the then- Chief of Staff of the Air Force, envisioned a streamlined Air Force, eliminating superfluous organizational layers. General John M. Loh, who served as Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force before becoming the commander of TAC on 26 March 1991, was heavily involved in the restructuring decisions. As a result, in the spring of 1992 the decision was made to merge most SAC resources with all of TAC&#x27;s resources, while simultaneously reorganizing the Military Airlift Command (MAC). On 1 June 1992, Tactical Air Command (TAC), Strategic Air Command (SAC), and Military Airlift Command (MAC) were inactivated, being replaced by two new major commands, Air Combat Command (ACC) and Air Mobility Command (AMC). A brief ceremony at Langley AFB, Virginia marked the inactivation of TAC and the activation of ACC. General Loh, who had commanded TAC until its inactivation, became the first commander of ACC.

<text>Fort Amherstburg was built by the Royal Canadian Volunteers at the mouth of the Detroit River to replace Fort Detroit, which Britain was required to cede to the United States of America in 1796 as a result of the Jay Treaty.

Built in the years before the War of 1812, Fort Amherstburg included &quot;King&#x27;s Navy Yard&quot; for shipbuilding on the upper Great Lakes (Lakes Erie, Huron, and Superior). The War of 1812 began and escalated quickly with US General William Hull invading Canada in July 1812. Soldiers from the fort repelled the Americans at River Canard. After General Hull retreated back to Fort Detroit, British General Isaac Brock and the Shawnee Chief Tecumseh met at Fort Amherstburg to plan the attack of Fort Detroit in the British Indian Department building located outside of the fort grounds. After losing the Battle of Lake Erie (including the flagship , which was built at the nearby Navy Yard Park), the British/Canadians destroyed the fort and retreated as most of the cannons normally placed in the bastions were put onto the ships to be used for the engagement on Lake Erie and subsequently were lost.

The Americans built a new, smaller fort on the same site with a reduced perimeter. The north-west bastion and connected wall still remain today . After the end of the war, the British/Canadians reclaimed (what is now) Southern Ontario and Fort Malden.

After the War of 1812, the British let the fort fall into disrepair until threats of rebellion grew in Upper Canada. The fort was repaired to full military use and was garrisoned with men from the 34th Regiment of Foot (made famous for their routing the French 34th regiment during the Napoleonic wars).

After the 1837 rebellion, the Fort again was not necessary as a military installation. It was changed from a military institution to a psychiatric institution. Its employees resided in the smallest barracks building, and the other two large barracks housed inmates sorted by gender. Trees were planted on and around the fort property to provide much-needed shade, which had not been wanted by the military as it would have obscured their view of an attacking force. After some time, the psychiatric institution moved to St. Catharines, Ontario, where it still exists.

After that second use for the grounds ended, the fort property was used as a woodmill until the property was sold off as private residences. The two large barracks buildings are no longer on the grounds. One was moved into the town of Amherstburg where it burned down during the 1920s while being used as a stable. The other barracks building technically still exists today. It has been moved from the fort grounds, divided up into three and sold as individual residences. They maintain the same shape as they had had as barracks, and at least one of the houses was found to have its original walls still intact.

Fort Amherstburg continues today in a military tradition and is a historic site (known as &quot;Fort Malden&quot;) that is frequently visited by tourists from around the world. Every Canada Day, an 1812 6-pounder field cannon is fired before a large display of fireworks is commenced. The Fort is garrisoned with summer staff who wear the same pattern of uniform and ladies who wear clothing styles of the early 19th century. Visitors can see what fort life was like in the early 19th century through cooking demonstrations and musket firing demonstrations. The biggest event at Fort Malden would be on the Canadian Civic Holiday weekend where re-enactors of time periods ranging from Ancient Rome to World War II gather and perform combat demonstrations and have a full encampment.

<doc id="1176775" wikidata="Q1115874" url="?curid=1176775" title="Orarion">
<text>The Orarion (Greek: ; Slavonic: орарь, &quot;orar&quot;) is the distinguishing vestment of the deacon and subdeacon in the Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodox Churches and Eastern Catholic Churches. It is a narrow stole, usually wide and of various lengths, made of brocade, often decorated with crosses (three, five or seven) embroidered or appliquéd along its length. It is usually trimmed with decorative banding around the edges and fringe at the two ends.

==Deacon==
The deacon wears the orarion over his left shoulder with the front portion draped over his left forearm. He will take this portion in his right hand when leading litanies or drawing attention to a particular liturgical action. This single orarion is the oldest form, as illustrated in traditional and older iconography.

Archdeacons and protodeacons are awarded the much longer double orarion, which is worn over the left shoulder, wrapped around the chest and back, and brought back over the left shoulder to the front. The Archdeacon&#x27;s orarion may also have the word &quot;Holy&quot; embroidered three times on it in large letters, using nomina sacra where customary, in reference to the Trisagion. In modern Greek Orthodox practice, all deacons usually wear the double orarion.
When preparing for Communion, the deacon will wrap the orarion around his waist, bringing the ends up over his shoulders (forming a cross in back) and then straight down in front, tucking them under the section around the waist.

Armenian usage is identical to the Byzantine Rite, except that their deacons wear the single orarion, which they call &quot;urar&quot;.

Eastern Catholics follow the same tradition as do their Orthodox counterparts. Sometimes in Greek Catholic practice, the double orarion is worn only over the left shoulder (folded to make up for length) over a cassock if the deacon in question is preaching, but not participating otherwise. This use of the orarion on top of a cassock is most often seen among Greek-Catholics of the Ukrainian and Ruthenian tradition; this is a marked departure from general Byzantine practice, in which there is no tradition of wearing the orarion without sticharion.

==Subdeacon==
The subdeacon also wears the orarion, but always wrapped around his body in the manner described above. In the Greek tradition, tonsured taper-bearers wear the orarion similarly crossed in back, but with the ends hanging parallel in front. In the same Greek tradition, altar-servers will sometimes be given a blessing to wear the orarion with the ends hanging parallel in front.

In Slavic Orthodox use, no one below the rank of subdeacon is usually permitted to wear the orarion. However, readers and altar servers are sometimes given a blessing by the bishop to vest in the orarion and perform some limited functions of a subdeacon. This is usually in cases where a man has been discerned to have a vocation to the subdiaconate and plans to marry but has not yet done so. The canons require that if a man is to marry, he must do so before ordination to the subdiaconate, and that anybody who marries after subdiaconal ordination is to be deposed.

<doc id="1176777" wikidata="Q1362029" url="?curid=1176777" title="Science and technology in the Soviet Union">
<text>Science and technology in the Soviet Union served as an important part of national politics, practices, and identity. From the time of Lenin until the dissolution of the USSR in the early 1990s, both science and technology were intimately linked to the ideology and practical functioning of the Soviet state and were pursued along paths both similar and distinct from models in other countries. Many great scientists who worked in Imperial Russia, such as Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, continued work in the USSR and gave birth to Soviet science.

The Soviet government made the development and advancement of science a national priority, emphasizing science at all levels of education and showering top scientists with honours. Very large numbers of engineers graduated every year. Soviet scientists won acclaim in several fields, marked by a highly developed pure science and innovation at the theoretical level, though interpretation and application fell short. They were at the cutting edge of science in fields such as mathematics and in several branches of physical science, notably theoretical nuclear physics, chemistry, and astronomy. The physical chemist and physicist Nikolay Semenov was the first Soviet citizen to win a Nobel Prize, in 1956 among several other Soviet Nobel Prize winners and the mathematician Sergei Novikov was the first Soviet citizen to win a Fields Medal in 1970 followed by Grigory Margulis in 1978 and Vladimir Drinfeld in 1990.

Soviet technology was most highly developed in the fields of nuclear physics, where the arms race with the West convinced policy makers to set aside sufficient resources for research. Due to a crash program directed by Igor Kurchatov (based on spies of the Cambridge Five), the Soviet Union was the second nation to develop an atomic bomb, in 1949, four years after the United States. The Soviet Union detonated a hydrogen bomb in 1953, a mere ten months after the United States. Space exploration was also highly developed: in October 1957 the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, into orbit; in April 1961 a Soviet cosmonaut, Yuri Gagarin, became the first man in space. The Soviets maintained a strong space program until economic problems led to cutbacks in the 1980s. The Soviet Union also had more scientists and engineers, relative to the world population, than any other major country due to the strong levels of state support for scientific developments by the 1980s. 

Although the sciences were less rigorously censored than other fields such as art, there were several examples of suppression of ideas. In the most notorious, agronomist Trofim Lysenko refused to accept the chromosome theory of heredity usually accepted by modern genetics. Claiming his theories corresponded to Marxism, he managed to talk Joseph Stalin in 1948 into banning the practice and teaching of population genetics and several other related fields of biological research; however, this decision was reversed in the 1960s. Cybernetics was also marginalised during the Stalinist period and received a hostile public campaign in 1951. Although, the discipline was rehabilitated during the post-Stalinist period from 1954 until 1959.

==Organization==

Unlike some Western countries, most of the research work in the USSR was conducted not at universities, but at specially set up research institutes. The more prestigious of them were parts of the USSR Academy of Sciences; others were within the system of specialized academies, or the research arms of various government ministries.

The core of fundamental science was the USSR Academy of Sciences, originally set up in 1925 and moved from Leningrad to Moscow in 1934. It consisted of 250 research institutes and 60,500 full-time researchers in 1987, a large percentage in the natural sciences such as biology.

All of the union&#x27;s republics except the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic had their own republican academies of science, while the Urals, Siberian, and Far Eastern regional branches of the academy coordinated fundamental science in Eastern Russia.

Medical research was coordinated by the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences (Академия медицинских наук СССР), which after 1992 was reorganized into the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences (Российская академия медицинских наук).

Agricultural research was organized under the aegis of the All-Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences of the Soviet Union.

===Scientific Research Institutes (NII)===
A large part of research was conducted in &quot;NII&quot;s — &quot;scientific research institutes&quot; (). There have been a great number of NIIs, each specialized in a particular field.

* Ioffe Physico-Technical Institute founded 1918
* Institute of Anthropology and Ethnography founded 1933
* Institute for Physical Problems founded 1934
* Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology founded 1946
* Institute of Radio-engineering and Electronics founded 1954
* Joint Institute for Nuclear Research founded 1956
* Novosibirsk TB Research Institute founded 1943

==Ideological restrictions on science==

Already in the 1920s, certain fields of scientific research were labeled &quot;bourgeois&quot; and &quot;idealist&quot; by the Communist Party. All research, including natural sciences, was to be founded on the philosophy of dialectical materialism. Humanities and social sciences were additionally tested for strict accordance with historical materialism.

After World War II, many scientists were forbidden from cooperation with foreign researchers. The scientific community of the Soviet Union became increasingly closed. In addition to that, the party continued declaring various new theories &quot;pseudo-scientific&quot;. Genetics, pedology and psychotechnics were already banned in 1936 by a special decree of the Central Committee. On August 7, 1948, the V.I. Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences announced that from that point on Lamarckian inheritance, the theory that personality traits acquired during life are passed on to offspring, would be taught as &quot;the only correct theory&quot;. Soviet scientists were forced to redact prior work, and even after this ideology, known as Lysenkoism, was demonstrated to be false, it took many years for criticism of it to become acceptable. After the 1960s, during the Khrushchev Thaw, a policy of liberalization of science was implemented, but the policy of Lysenkoism continued. Lysenkoism was officially renounced in 1964, after Leonid Brezhnev came to power.

==After Soviet collapse==
After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, rapid inflation and decline in governmental revenues caused the scientific establishment to lose much of its funding and stability for the first time since the 1920s.
Salaries were not paid for months, and research monies disappeared. International organizations offered aid programs to discourage emigration. In general, however, the Russian scientific community has been slow to recover from the political and economic shocks of the 1990s.

==Soviet Nobel Prize winners in science==
The following Soviet scientists were recipients of a Nobel Prize.

===Physics===
*1958 Pavel Cherenkov, Ilya Frank and Igor Tamm &quot;for the discovery and interpretation of the Cherenkov effect&quot;
*1962 Lev Landau &quot;for his theories about condensed matter, particularly about liquid helium superfluidity&quot;
*1964 Nikolay Basov and Aleksandr Prokhorov &quot;for fundamental work in the area of the quantum electronics, which led to the construction of oscillators and amplifiers based on the maser laser principle&quot;
*1978 Pyotr Kapitsa &quot;for his fundamental inventions and discoveries in Cryophysics&quot;
*2001 Zhores Alferov (RU) &quot;for the development of semiconductor heterostructures for high-speed and opto-electronics&quot; (working in the time of the USSR)
*2003 Alexei Abrikosov (RU), Vitaly Ginzburg (RU) &quot;for innovative work in the theory about superconductors&quot; (working in the time of the USSR)

===Chemistry===
*1956 Nikolai Semenov For outstanding work on the mechanism of chemical transformation including an exhaustive analysis of the application of the chain theory to varied reactions (1934–1954) and, more significantly, to combustion processes. He proposed a theory of degenerate branching, which led to a better understanding of the phenomena associated with the induction periods of oxidation processes.

==National Prizes==
The most prestigious government prize awarded for achievements in science and technology was originally the Stalin Prize. After the death of Stalin, the Stalin Prize was renamed the USSR State Prize, and the new Lenin Prize became the top award.

<text>Vehementer Nos was a papal encyclical promulgated by Pope Pius X on 11 February 1906. He denounced the French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State enacted two months earlier. He condemned its unilateral abrogation of the Concordat of 1801 between Napoleon I and Pope Pius VII that had granted the Catholic Church a distinctive status and established a working relationship between the French government and the Holy See. The title of the document is taken from its opening words in Latin, which mean &quot;We with vehemence&quot;.

==Background==
Prior to the French Revolution of 1789, Roman Catholicism had been the state religion of France, and closely identified with the &quot;ancien regime&quot;. During the French Revolution, the National Assembly had taken Church properties and issued the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, which made the Church a department of the State, effectively removing it from papal authority. Subsequent laws abolished the traditional Gregorian calendar and Christian holidays. The revolution led to a brief separation of church and state in 1795, ended by Napoleon&#x27;s re-establishment of the Catholic Church as the state religion with the Concordat of 1801.

While the Concordat restored some ties to the papacy, it was an attempt on Napoleon&#x27;s part to win favor with Catholics in France and largely favored the state. According to its terms Catholicism was recognized as the religion of the great majority of the French but not the official state religion. While the Papacy had the right to depose bishops, the French government retained the right to nominate them. The state would pay clerical salaries to clergy who swore an oath of allegiance to the state. The Catholic Church also gave up all claims to Church lands confiscated after 1790, but Sunday was reestablished as a &quot;festival&quot;, effective Easter Sunday, 18 April 1802.

==1905 law==
In 1905 the French government passed a law stipulating “the separation of churches and the state&quot;, and unilaterally abrogating the terms of the 1801 Concordat. According to Sheridan Gilley while claiming to guarantee freedom of worship, the law kept religion under state regulation. The act stipulated that all Church property be turned over to &quot;associations&quot; of lay people. The pope and most French Catholics considered the law as undermining the independent authority of the Church. Pius viewed it as related to Modernist theories popular in France, and a concerted attack upon the Church. In Italy, Modernism was more political than doctrinal.

In February 1906 the government began to make inventories of ecclesiastical property in order &quot;to prevent any theft of antiques&quot;. This provoked riots in Paris, Lille, and some country districts by disgruntled French Catholics. People barricaded themselves in churches. According to Mary McAuliffe, people rang church bells to sound the alarm, and armed themselves with sticks and pitchforks. She notes that in the Pyrenees, the Basques brought their bears. Opposition to the reforms was supported by the monarchists.

<text>The Icelandic Elf School () is an organization located in Reykjavík, Iceland, that teaches visitors about Icelandic folklore.

The organization teaches about the hidden people and thirteen types of elves, entities purported by the institution to reside within Iceland. The school&#x27;s principal, Magnús Skarphéðinsson, states:Hidden people are just the same size and look exactly like human beings, the only difference is that they are invisible to most of us. Elves, on the other hand, aren’t entirely human, they’re humanoid, starting at around eight centimeters.The Icelandic Elf School publishes materials on hidden people, which serve both as an educational resource and a teaching aid within the classroom.

Established in 1991, the school arranges educational excursions lasting approximately five hours for its visitors. Since opening the institution has welcomed more than 9,000 attendees, the majority of whom are foreign. Other services provided by the Álfaskólinn include aura readings and explorations into past lives.

<text>Tom Whittaker (born 1948 in York) was the first disabled person to climb to the summit of Mount Everest.

Whittaker&#x27;s right foot needed to be amputated following a car accident in 1979. Following this serious accident, he regained his strength and continued climbing. He was educated at Idaho State University.

In 1981, he founded the Cooperative Wilderness Handicapped Outdoor Group (C.W.HOG) in Pocatello, Idaho. While living in Idaho, he was active in the southeast Idaho climbing community.

His first attempt on Everest was in 1995.

On May 27, 1998, on his third attempt, Whittaker reached the summit of Mount Everest, a lifelong dream, making him the first person with a disability to accomplish this feat.

Whittaker&#x27;s current quest is to climb the highest peaks on all seven continents.

In the 2006, Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours List, Whittaker was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE). Tom currently lives in Prescott, Arizona with his daughter, Georgia.

<text>U.S. Route 192 (US 192) is an east–west route of the United States Numbered Highway system in central Florida. It runs from U.S. Route 27 (State Road 25) in Four Corners, Lake County, east past Walt Disney World and through Kissimmee, St. Cloud and Melbourne, to end at State Road A1A in Indialantic, one block from the Atlantic Ocean. It crosses (and runs concurrent with) its &quot;parent&quot;, U.S. Route 92, in Kissimmee, for only .

The U.S. Route is assigned the following unsigned State Road numbers:
*The full length of State Road 530, from US 27 (SR 25) to Main Street in Kissimmee
*The southernmost part of State Road 500, from Kissimmee to Indialantic

US 192 is a major tourist strip in the area around the Walt Disney World Resort and features numerous timeshare and other resorts; the road includes &quot;mile markers&quot; (though not strictly placed at the exact mile intervals) to help tourists locate businesses. In the late 1990s, the Osceola Parkway (County Road 522) opened, providing a tolled alternate between Walt Disney World and Kissimmee.

For most of its route, US 192 is the Irlo Bronson Memorial Highway, named after former state representative, senator and cattleman Irlo O. Bronson, Sr. It is also known as Space Coast Parkway, as it leads to the Space Coast.

==Route description==


US 192 (SR 530) begins at a trumpet interchange on U.S. Route 27 (State Road 25) in Lake County, just north of the Polk County line. (Three of the four ramps enter Polk County.) It heads east as a four-to-six lane divided highway, crossing into Orange County (just north of Osceola County) after about a mile (1.5 km). Soon after entering Orange County, County Road 545 heads north, serving the far western areas of the county. An old alignment of US 192 (Bali Boulevard) is present to the north between the county line and CR 545; it used to continue east to the south (in Osceola County) to near Lindfields Boulevard.

After spending under in Orange County, US 192 crosses the line into Osceola County, continuing to parallel it. It intersects with State Road 429 (opened to the north in late 2005 and to the south in late 2006) before curving southeast away from the county line. In that area, the density of tourist attractions increases as the road approaches Walt Disney World. An old alignment (Black Lake Road) is present on the north side between the curve away from the county line and Sherberth Road, near where it curves back east. Sherberth Road is the westernmost public access to Walt Disney World, intersecting the Osceola Parkway west of Disney&#x27;s Animal Kingdom. Just east of it is an intersection with County Road 545, which heads south.

Near the crossing of Reedy Creek, US 192 enters the Reedy Creek Improvement District (Walt Disney World), although the highway remains under state ownership, unlike other roads in the RCID. Both sides of the road are owned by Disney and kept empty, so US 192 has a short freeway section through Walt Disney World. An interchange provides access to World Drive, the main north–south road in Walt Disney World, and then US 192 crosses Interstate 4 (State Road 400), the end of Disney property. The north side again is filled with tourist attractions, while the south side is at first part of Celebration, Disney&#x27;s planned community.

Celebration Avenue heads south to an interchange with State Road 417, which crosses US 192 with no direct access. Just east of that crossing, US 192 crosses Bonnet Creek, the east end of Celebration, and International Drive heads north. An intersection with Poinciana Boulevard provides access to the Osceola Parkway to the north and Poinciana to the south, and State Road 535 heads north soon after. SR 535, and US 192 to the east, is part of the old Kissimmee-Vineland Road, built parallel to the Florida Midland Railroad; the intersection of US 192 and SR 535 has been moved to give US 192 the through road.

Just after crossing SR 535, US 192 turns southeast onto the alignment of the old Kissimmee-Vineland Road. Another old alignment - Old Vineland Road - is present in this section, rejoining as US 192 turns back east towards downtown Kissimmee. After the road crosses Shingle Creek, it becomes Kissimmee&#x27;s Vine Street, a major east–west road passing north of downtown. Close to downtown, US 192 crosses John Young Parkway. This is a major north–south road from Kissimmee north to Orlando, built as an alternate to the Orange Blossom Trail. To the south, since ca. 2000, John Young Parkway carries U.S. Route 17/92 (State Road 600) southwest out of Kissimmee. US 17, US 92 and SR 600 run concurrent with US 192 and SR 530 for to Main Street, which heads south into downtown Kissimmee and north to Orlando as the Orange Blossom Trail. This carries US 17, US 92 and SR 600 to the north, and carried them south until ca. 2000. Also to the north on Main Street is U.S. Route 441 (State Road 500); both of these routes turn east with US 192 out of Kissimmee. SR 530 ends at the intersection of Vine Street and Main Street; thus Vine Street carries US 192, US 441 and SR 500 east from Kissimmee.

Several miles from downtown Kissimmee, US 192 turns southeast. The road intersects Fortune Road (formerly Boggy Creek Road) before an interchange with Florida&#x27;s Turnpike (State Road 91). This interchange, consisting of a connector road between US 192 and a trumpet interchange at the Turnpike, once served all movements. A new northbound offramp was built several miles to the east, where US 192 crosses the Turnpike, when the Turnpike north of SR 60 changed from a ticket system to a barrier toll system.

After crossing the Turnpike, US 192 turns back east, becoming 13th Street in St. Cloud. The original alignment (part of the Kissimmee-Melbourne Highway) between Kissimmee and St. Cloud, which paralleled the St. Cloud and Sugar Belt Railway, began at Main Street and Drury Avenue in downtown Kissimmee, heading east on Drury Avenue and Neptune Road, crossing US 192 west of downtown St. Cloud and becoming 10th Street. In St. Cloud, County Road 523 heads south at Vermont Avenue. After leaving St. Cloud, at the unincorporated community of Ashton, County Road 15 (Narcoossee Road) heads north past Narcoossee and into Orange County. Unsigned State Road 15 begins at that intersection, heading east with US 192, US 441 and SR 500. 10th Street (the old alignment) ends at CR 15 north of US 192, but the road used to continue across, turning southeast to hit US 192 east of CR 15.
Leaving the St. Cloud area, US 192 again begins to turn southeast, running mainly through swampland for the rest of its path to Melbourne. Another old alignment - Lake Lizzie Drive - begins there, running north of US 192 to its end just west of Alligator Creek. County Road 532 (Nova Road) splits off to the northeast in that area, crossing Lake Lizzle Drive and then turning east. After the Alligator Creek crossing, yet another old alignment - Old Melbourne Highway, former State Road 500A - splits to the east. Portions of this road have been closed to the public, as the old road runs past Mercury Marine&#x27;s former Lake X landing strip. The rest of the alignment is on private property owned mostly by Deseret Ranch.

At Holopaw, around the middle of the old alignment, U.S. Route 441 and State Road 15 split off to the south, leaving only US 192 and SR 500 beyond to Melbourne. West of Deer Park, the old road crosses to the south side of the new road. Several miles later, at Deer Park, County Road 419 begins to the north; the road to the south is unnumbered and ends at old US 192. From there, the old alignment heads straight east back to the current road, passing the Kempfer Sawmill and the former Union Cypress Railroad.

Soon after the old and new alignments join, US 192 crosses into Brevard County on the original Kissimmee-Melbourne Highway, roughly paralleling the old Union Cypress Railroad. As it approaches Melbourne on New Haven Avenue, it crosses Interstate 95 (State Road 9), intersects County Road 511 (north only), crosses County Road 509, and intersects State Road 507. Soon after SR 507, US 192 cuts northeast to Strawbridge Avenue, which runs one block north of New Haven Avenue, providing a bypass of the Historic Downtown Melbourne. After crossing U.S. Route 1 (State Road 5) at the site of the historic 1900 Building, Strawbridge Avenue and New Haven Avenue merge at the west end of the Melbourne Causeway across the Indian River. New Haven Avenue is still maintained by the state east of US 1, and is considered a section of SR 500. East of the Indian River, US 192 enters Indialantic on Fifth Avenue, where it spends four blocks before ending at State Road A1A, one short block from the Atlantic Ocean.

==History==

Florida&#x27;s State Road system was defined by law in 1923. Included in that system was State Road 24, running along the existing Kissimmee-Melbourne Highway from State Road 2 in Kissimmee to State Road 4 in Melbourne. This road had been built in 1918 through the land of George W. Hopkins. In the mid-1920s, SR 24 became part of the Dixie Highway, connecting the western route in Kissimmee with the eastern route in Melbourne.

The United States Numbered Highways were assigned in late 1926, including U.S. Route 192, running from U.S. Route 92 in Kissimmee east to U.S. Route 1 in Melbourne. In the 1930s, several sections in Osceola County were realigned.
In 1931, another State Road - State Road 257 - was defined. This route would begin in Kissimmee, heading northwest on the Kissimmee-Vineland Road and west on the Kissimmee-Lake Wilson Road, and then make its way generally north to Clermont and Howey-in-the-Hills. (This follows the existing US 192 from Kissimmee to the curve just west of Walt Disney World; the road was never built beyond the west end of Oak Island Road.)

SR 24 was extended east in 1933 to State Road 140 (now State Road A1A) at the Atlantic Ocean, but US 192 did not join it. In 1935, SR 24 was extended the other way, from Kissimmee northwest along the Kissimmee-Vineland Road and beyond, ending in Mount Plymouth. (This overlapped with the beginning of SR 257, and only coincided with present US 192 there.)


In the 1945 renumbering, three State Roads were assigned to what is now US 192. From Kissimmee to Melbourne, still the only part of US 192 at the time, SR 24 became part of State Road 500. The 1933 extension of SR 24 to the Atlantic Ocean became the short State Road 516. Finally, State Road 530 was assigned along former SR 24 and SR 257 from Kissimmee west to the end of Oak Island Road, turning south there along Goodman Road and Old Lake Wilson Road to Loughman, continuing east on Loughman Road to end at State Road 600 (U.S. Highway 17/92).

On July 13, 1950, a newly constructed road, running west from the south end of State Road 545 to U.S. Route 27 (State Road 25), was assigned the number State Road 545A. This soon became part of SR 530, which was rerouted to its present alignment.

In the late 1960s, US 192 was extended east along SR 516 (renumbered at some point to an extension of SR 500) to end at State Road A1A In 1972 it was extended west along SR 530 to U.S. Route 27 (State Road 25), crossing Interstate 4 and the recently opened Walt Disney World Resort along the way.

US 192 underwent extensive reconstruction in the 1990s, which continues to the present date. The widening of the portion from SR 535 to Interstate 4 to six lanes went several years behind schedule because of unanticipated drainage complications. Construction to widen US 192 to four lanes from east of St. Cloud to I-95, eliminating the remaining 2-lane section, was completed in 2008. The rebuilt intersection with I-4 was fully opened in July 2007.

<doc id="1176801" wikidata="Q742196" url="?curid=1176801" title="Darden Restaurants">
<text>Darden Restaurants, Inc. is an American multi-brand restaurant operator headquartered in Orlando, Florida. Darden has more than 1,800 restaurant locations and more than 175,000 employees, making it the world&#x27;s largest full-service restaurant company. The company began as an extension of Red Lobster, founded by William Darden and initially backed by General Mills. Red Lobster was later sold in July 2014.

The firm owns three fine dining restaurant chains: Ruth&#x27;s Chris Steak House, Eddie V&#x27;s Prime Seafood, and The Capital Grille; and seven casual dining restaurant chains: Olive Garden Italian Restaurant, LongHorn Steakhouse, Bahama Breeze, Seasons 52, Yard House, and Cheddar&#x27;s Scratch Kitchen. In July 2024, Darden agreed to acquire Chuy&#x27;s.

==History==

William &quot;Bill&quot; Darden opened his first restaurant, The Green Frog, in Waycross, Georgia, in 1938 at age 19. He later founded the Red Lobster Inns of America and opened the first Red Lobster restaurant in Lakeland, Florida, in 1968. Red Lobster, which grew quickly, formed the basis of the organization that later became known as Darden Restaurants.
Darden chose Lakeland to see how a seafood restaurant would fare in a non-coastal region. The initial Red Lobster franchise was lauded by diners and critics alike. The restaurant became successful and, by 1970, had expanded to three locations in the state, with two more under construction. While the locations were profitable, the company needed more resources to expand. As such, Darden sold the company to food giant General Mills that year. After an extended illness, Darden died on March 29, 1994, at the age of 75.

===General Mills ownership===
General Mills, a company that makes breakfast cereals, upgraded the chain to a more casual dining/family fare-oriented format, opened a new company headquarters in Orlando, and retained Darden as company manager. In 1975, when Darden was promoted to Vice President of General Mills, Joseph (Joe) R. Lee, the company&#x27;s first restaurant manager, was promoted to President of Red Lobster. Under General Mills&#x27; ownership, Red Lobster expanded into a chain of almost 400 locations by 1985. The company underwent several restructurings and transformed itself from an inexpensive fast-food seller into a chain of casual dining seafood restaurants by 1988.

One of the company&#x27;s first ventures into the diversification of its portfolio was the York Steak House chain of English-themed steak and chop restaurants in the 1970s. The franchised steak and potatoes restaurant was a cafeteria-style restaurant with a salad bar and hot station. By the end of the 1980s, the chain had been mostly closed down, though one independent location still exists. These restaurants were very similar to Ruby Tuesday.

In 1982, Darden opened the first Olive Garden concept restaurant in Orlando. The chain took off, and by 1989 General Mills had opened over 145 restaurants, making the chain the fastest-growing unit in the company&#x27;s restaurant holdings. While Olive Garden did not meet critical success, it was popular, and its per-restaurant sales soon grew to match those of Red Lobster. The company eventually became the largest chain of Italian-themed full-service restaurants in the United States.

In 1990, China Coast was launched as an attempt to create a (U.S.) national casual dining restaurant that featured American Chinese cuisine. While the chain eventually expanded to some 50 restaurants, its sales could have been better, and it lost an estimated US$20 million. By the end of 1995, the restaurants were shuttered and the remaining locations were either converted to Red Lobsters or Olive Gardens or closed altogether.

===Darden===
In 1995, General Mills decided to spin off its restaurant chains to focus on consumer food products. The new company was named Darden Restaurants, after Red Lobster&#x27;s founder. General Mills stockholders received one share of Darden for every common share of General Mills held. General Mills restaurants had $108 million net income in that year. At the end of 1995, Darden operated 1,250 restaurants in 49 states with 73 locations in Canada.

Darden Restaurants was spun off from General Mills beginning on May 9, 1995, when it began trading on the when-issued basis at $9.75 a share. The company became a fully separate entity on May 31, 1995, when its shares went on sale on the NYSE. The shares opened at $10.75, 17% below expectations, but climbed to $11.125 by the close of trading.

Darden executives planned to have two additional chains in place by 1998. In March 1996, Darden launched a test of a Bahama Breeze Caribbean Grille concept featuring food and drinks found in the islands of the Caribbean Sea and a Caribbean theme.

Markets were oversaturated with restaurants in 1997, forcing Darden to close 48 poorly performing locations and lose $91 million due to the restructuring. Red Lobster and Olive Garden were given makeovers in 1998. Darden also made a profit of $102 million that year.

In 1999, Darden opened an additional location after recovering from the 1996–1997 losses. The company then began testing a new concept called Smokey Bones BBQ Sports Bar, which opened in late 1999 in Orlando. The restaurant is a sports bar concept featuring barbecue and related foodstuffs in an Appalachian mountain lodge setting.

In 2003, Seasons 52 was under development to &quot;provide guests the opportunity to indulge while still eating well.&quot; Seasons 52 restaurants were only being opened in the Florida or Atlanta markets during its initial phase.

Darden announced in January 2007 that the company was willing to expand by purchasing existing 100-location chains or even considering franchisors. By May, Darden indicated that its Smokey Bones division would be sold and/or shut down including the two Rocky River Grillhouse, the proposed replacement concept for Smokey Bones. In August, Darden acquired rival Atlanta-based restaurant holder Rare Hospitality for US$1.4 billion, gaining Rare&#x27;s two chains, The Capital Grille and LongHorn Steakhouse. As part of the Rare acquisition, Darden set up its Specialty Restaurant Group to include Capital Grille, Bahama Breeze, and Seasons 52. In December, Darden announced that it would sell its Smokey Bones chain to Barbeque Integrated, Inc., an affiliate of Sun Capital Partners, Inc., for approximately $80 million. The sale was completed in January 2008.

===Expansion and ownership changes===
In 2010, Seasons 52 started a new expansion phase opening up in 11 more states over the next three years.

In January 2011, Darden announced co-locating their Olive Garden and Red Lobster brands in smaller markets to share kitchens but continue separate menus and eating areas. As part of the February Darden analyst conference, an analyst indicated that the corporation may be targeting another restaurant chain for acquisition, possibly BJ&#x27;s, California Pizza Kitchen or Yard House. In October 2011, Darden acquired two chains, Eddie V&#x27;s Prime Seafood and Wildfish Seafood Grille, for a $59 million cash transaction, and were placed within its Specialty Restaurant Group, Also in October, Darden signed an area development agreement with Americana Group of Kuwait to develop and operate at least 60 locations using the Red Lobster, Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse concepts.

In July 2012, Darden acquired the Yard House 39-location beer-centric chain for $585 million from TSG Consumer Partners. Yard House will be alongside the other upscale restaurants in Darden&#x27;s Specialty Restaurant Group. On December 23, 2013, Darden&#x27;s stock rose 3% after activist investor Starboard Value, a hedge fund, took a stake in the company.

===Red Lobster sale===
On December 19, 2013, Darden announced plans to sell or spin off the Red Lobster brand, citing pressure from stock investors. This was in direct response to the company spending US$100 million on a new digital platform. At the time, the project was already at least one year behind schedule and above budget. A large number of layoffs occurred in its marketing department, and the company&#x27;s second in command also left.

On May 12, 2014, Darden announced that as part of the spinoff of Red Lobster, it was converting the co-located Red Lobster and Olive Garden locations into standalone Olive Garden locations. On May 16, 2014, Darden announced that it would be selling the Red Lobster seafood restaurant chain to Golden Gate Capital for US$2.1 billion. Darden announced the completion of the sale of Red Lobster on July 28, 2014.

===Acquisitions===
Differences between Starboard and Darden management soon emerged over the hedge fund&#x27;s proposal to split the company in two and spin off a third to handle their real estate portfolio, a move Starboard said would greatly boost shareholder value. Matters came to a head when management announced a plan to spin off the underperforming Red Lobster early in 2014. Starboard led a large group of investors in asking management to delay the move and see if better options, such as its plans to revitalize the chain, were available. When management instead decided to sell the chain to private equity firm Golden Gate Capital in May, Starboard and other investors sharply criticized the $2.1 billion &quot;fire sale&quot; price as a serious undervaluing of Red Lobster and its assets, such as the underlying real estate. It also claimed management had refused shareholders&#x27; requests for a special meeting to discuss the deal.

Clarence Otis, Jr. announced he would be resigning as CEO at the end of 2014, the same day the Red Lobster sale was complete. Management said afterward that it would work on a needed turnaround plan for Olive Garden, which was also struggling. However, after CNBC reported on a leaked document, supposedly offered to potential lenders and buyers earlier in the year, that described Red Lobster&#x27;s financial position far more optimistically than management had in its contemporary public statements, one of the investors, a union pension fund, filed suit alleging material misrepresentation. Management claimed Golden Gate had prepared the document in consultation with Red Lobster&#x27;s executives, who could have been expected to have that view of the chain&#x27;s future. Gene Lee was named permanent CEO on February 23, 2015, after serving as interim CEO in October 2014.

Starboard assembled its slate of directors to challenge all the sitting board members in the company&#x27;s upcoming shareholder elections. In support of their candidacy, it released a 294-slide presentation in early September about how the company had gone wrong and how its directors would restore it to health. While it received considerable media attention for its detailed focus on Olive Garden, in particular the chain&#x27;s &quot;wasteful&quot; practice of serving too many of its free unlimited breadsticks at once (to prevent food waste due to staleness: instead of one per customer plus an additional one per table; additional breadsticks are served fresh on demand) and not salting the water it boiled pasta in, to secure a longer warranty on the pots, it also attacked management for spending lavishly on the chain&#x27;s corporate headquarters while paying the general managers of individual restaurants less than its competitors did. Management responded two days later that it was already implementing many of the suggested changes, and said the free breadsticks merely represented &quot;Italian generosity.&quot; Nevertheless, in October, shareholders replaced the entire board with Starboard&#x27;s slate, in what an observer called an &quot;epic fail&quot; for management, since that rarely happens.

On March 27, 2017, Darden announced its intent to acquire Cheddar&#x27;s Scratch Kitchen for $780 million from shareholders such as L Catterton and Oak Investment Partners. On March 28, 2017, when Darden announced that it had acquired Cheddar&#x27;s Scratch Kitchen and &quot;lifted its full-year earnings outlook,&quot; the company became the biggest gainer that day on the S&amp;P 500, with shares growing nearly 9%. The acquisition was completed on April 24, 2017.

On May 3, 2023, Darden announced it was acquiring Ruth&#x27;s Hospitality Group Inc. for $21.50 per share in an all-cash transaction, with an equity value of approximately $715 million. Ruth&#x27;s Hospitality is the owner and operator of the Ruth&#x27;s Chris Steak House chain.

<text>Wiffle ball is a scaled back variation of baseball that was developed in 1953 in Fairfield, Connecticut. Originally, it was intended to be played in confined space or otherwise small area, but became a popular outdoor activity. The sport is played using a perforated light-weight plastic ball and a long hollow plastic bat. Two teams of one to five players each attempt to advance imaginary runners to home plate, and score, based on where each batter places the ball on the field. The term &quot;Wiffle ball&quot; may refer to the sport as a whole, or the ball used in the sport. Wiffle is a registered trademark of &quot;Wiffle Ball, Inc.&quot; and was derived from the slang word &quot;whiff&quot; meaning to strike out. 

== History ==
Miniature versions of baseball have been played for decades, including stickball, improvised by children, using everything from rolled up socks to tennis balls. The ball most commonly used in the game was invented by David N. Mullany at his home in Fairfield, Connecticut in 1953 when he designed a ball that curved easily for his 12-year-old son. It was named when his son and his friends would refer to a strikeout as a &quot;&quot;. The Wiffle Ball is about the same size as a regulation baseball, but is hollow, lightweight, of resilient plastic, and no more than thick. One is perforated with eight oblong holes; the other half is non-perforated. This construction allows pitchers to throw curveballs and risers.

In April 2011, the Health Department of the State of New York included wiffle ball on a list of recreational activities that present a &quot;significant risk of injury&quot; to children. Under a state law passed in 2009, any program for children that included two or more such activities would be defined as a “summer camp” subject to government regulation. The story became a frequent source of ridicule and amusement, with Parenting.com sarcastically commenting, &quot;According to new legislation introduced in New York State, to survive classic schoolyard games like capture the flag is to cheat death.&quot; Wiffle Ball executives originally thought the order was a joke, because the company has never been sued over any safety issues in its 50+ year history. The disapproval of people from across the nation pressured the New York legislature to remove wiffle ball and other items such as archery and scuba diving from the list of risky activities.

==Game==
Wiffle ball is a simplified version of the game of baseball that is designed to be a miniature version of the game that is suitable to be played both indoor and outdoors, often in confined spaces. Because of this, the rules of wiffle ball are very alike to baseball. A single game of wiffle ball consists of 6 innings or 60 minutes, whichever is earlier.

A playing field is not necessary, but if a field is marked, it is shaped like an isosceles triangle. The batter stands at the top of the triangle looking down the two equal sides that are about 60 feet in length. A ball hit about thirty feet counts as a &quot;single&quot; and a ball hit about 45 feet counts as a &quot;double.&quot; When a ball is hit outside of the sides of the triangle, it counts as a foul ball. The line across the bottom of the triangle is about twenty feet in length, and a ball hit across this line counts as a &quot;home run.&quot; Scoring of this game is similar to scoring in baseball as are the terms used, i.e., &quot;single,&quot; &quot;double,&quot; &quot;foul ball&quot; and &quot;home run.&quot; However, there is no running around bases for the batter(s), and there is no chasing the ball for the pitcher and fielders.

The objective for each team in Wiffle ball is to score more runs than their opponent, thus winning the game. Once both teams have completed their agreed number of innings (usually six) or time limit has been reached, the team with the highest number of runs will be declared the winner. Should the number of runs be the same at the end of the game then the game is drawn. Some Wiffle ball leagues allow tied games and the points are shared equally by the two teams whereas others will insist on one more innings each, with the highest score being declared the winner. Another version of the game, called wiffle-beer, has become increasingly popular among college students. All regular wiffle ball rules apply, with the main difference being each player must hold a can of beer while batting and while in the outfield, with the runner needing to finish the beer before reaching home plate or the run does not count. Wiffle-beer is usually played 18 innings instead of the traditional 9 innings.

== Tournaments ==
Wiffle ball tournaments have been held in the United States and Europe since 1977. That year, Rick Ferroli began holding tournaments in his backyard tribute to Fenway Park in Hanover, Massachusetts. In 1980, the World Wiffle Ball Championship was established in Mishawaka, Indiana by Jim Bottorff and Larry Grau. With the explosion of the Internet in the 1990s, there are now hundreds of Wiffle ball tournaments played in the United States, most in the same place every year, with a few tournament &quot;circuits&quot;. The World Wiffle Ball Championship remains the oldest tournament in the nation, having moved to the Chicago suburbs in 2013, after introducing regional stops over three decades in Baltimore; Los Angeles; Indianapolis; Eugene, Oregon; and Barcelona, Spain. The tournament is featured at #27 in the book, &quot;101 Baseball Places to Visit Before You Strike Out.&quot;

The NWLA (National Wiffle League Association) tournament is held in various Midwestern and Mid-Atlantic locations, which change on an annual basis. The tournament crowns a champion from a field of all-star teams from leagues across the country. 

Several organizations such as FastPlastic and Golden Stick have hosted universally recognized National Championships in the past. Currently, United Wiffle is the governing body for the tournament, as its inception took place in 2020 in York, Pennsylvania. The Usual Suspects were crowned champion, as the squad captained by Danny Lanigan defeated Black Dog Country Club 5-3 in the championship game. The scope of the tournament has since expanded to meet the criteria of a World Championship Tournament, with teams from Japan and Canada having competed in recent years. 

==Leagues==
There are many competitive wiffle ball leagues in the United States, including Major League Wiffle Ball at the forefront. There have throughout history been other wiffleball leagues, current ones include AWA Wiffle Ball, the most viewed wiffleball league, and other leagues considered “Minor League Wiffleball” such as Bay City Wiffle Ball, WR Wiffle Ball, Northville Wiffle League, NWA Wiffle Ball, Big League Wiffle Ball and Mid-Atlantic Wiffle.

The most followed Wiffle Ball league, AWA Wiffle Ball launched in 2020 in a backyard in Edmonds, Washington, where the eight-team league remains based; over the course of the next four years, it expanded in popularity through its social media presence, airing live games on TikTok and later YouTube. ESPN8 The Ocho has aired the AWA&#x27;s all-star game annually since 2022. It is the most viewed wiffleball league. 

Another Wiffle Ball league is MLW Wiffle Ball. MLW was established by Kyle Schultz in Brighton, Michigan in 2009. The league consists of eight teams, which are the Eastern Eagles, Western Wildcats, Coastal Cobras, Midwest Mallards, Great Lakes Gators, Pacific Predators, Metro Magic, and Downtown Diamondbacks.

MLW has a strong following on social media, uploads highlights of all of their games to YouTube, and has also hosted open public tournaments in 8 different states (Michigan, Ohio, Arizona, Texas, Illinois, New York, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania). The league gained significant notoriety throughout its 2020 season, after several other professional sports were postponed or cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The league has been featured by TBS, &quot;The Athletic&quot;, Whistle Sports, and twice been highlighted on ESPN&#x27;s &quot;SportsCenter&quot; Top 10 Plays. They also have played games in states other than Michigan, in which they have played games in Oklahoma, Ohio, Vermont, California, Pennsylvania, Missouri, Georgia, Florida, New York, Illinois, and Texas. Notable venues they have played in include Fifth Third Field, home of the Toledo Mud Hens, and a wiffle ball field at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, home of the Phillies. In 2022, MLW began playing their World Series games at netural sites, where they played at SoFi Stadium in LA, home of the NFL’s LA Rams and LA Chargers, for the 2022 World Series, where the Diamondbacks swept the Cobras in 3 to win their second straight title. That event was without fans unlike the 2023 World Series, which was held at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, home of the NFL’s Atlanta Falcons and the MLS Atlanta United. In that series, the Magic came back from a 2-0 deficit in the series to win their first World Series title over the Eagles. Most recently, in 2024, the World Series was held at AT&amp;T Stadium in Dallas, home of the NFL&#x27;s Dallas Cowboys. In that series, the Eagles got revenge from their 2023 World Series loss when they swept the Predators in 3 to win their first title since 2016. The most recent champions are the Eastern Eagles, managed by Daniel Schultz.

The name has also been associated with a small league in the southwestern Illinois city of Granite City, which has come to be a hub of the sport with the Lakeside Kings having won multiple world championships in the Wiffle Ball National Championship Series. The League&#x27;s inaugural national championship was held in October 2001 in Granite City,
whose wiffle only stadium has long been known for its similarity to Fenway Park and Busch Stadium. The national championship was launched following a decade long increase in interest in the sport, among fans and players of all ages.

As of 2015, there was also a sixty player league in Havre de Grace, Maryland, which featured former NBA player Gary Neal.

In 2013, the Greater Cincinnati Wiffleball League was founded in Cincinnati, Ohio. The GCWL season runs from May through October. Averaging 10 teams and over 50 players each season, it is recognized as one of the premier wiffleball leagues in the United States.

==Fields==
Some wiffle ball players have built fields to resemble major league ballparks. Thomas P. Hannon, Jr. authored a book, &quot;Backyard Ball&quot;, on his experiences building a smaller version of Ebbets Field. Patrick M. O&#x27;Connor wrote a book, &quot;Little Fenway&quot;, about building his versions of Fenway Park and Wrigley Field. But not all wiffle ball fields have been modeled from major league ball parks. Some have created original fields, Strawberry Field in Encino, California being the most exquisite. Rick Messina spent over $700,000 constructing Strawberry Field, which features lights for night games, bleachers, and a press box. He also converted a neighboring house into a clubhouse/pub.

Building fields can lead to controversy and legal issues. In 2008, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published an article about Greenwich, Connecticut teenagers who were forced by the city to tear down a wiffle ball field they had built because of neighbor complaints.

==In popular culture==
In 1965 a wiffle ball was initially used when developing the sport of pickleball, but it was eventually replaced with a more durable ball.

In his 2003 book &quot;The Complete Far Side&quot;, cartoonist Gary Larson reproduces a letter he received after including a &quot;wiffle swatter&quot; in his cartoon. The letter contains language from Wiffle Ball Incorporated&#x27;s attorneys: &quot;In the future, when you use the brand name WIFFLE, the entire brand should be capitalized, and it should only be used in reference to a product currently manufactured by The Wiffle Ball, Inc.&quot; In 2009, video game developer Skyworks Technologies released a game based on Wiffle ball, simply titled &quot;Wiffle Ball&quot;.

In science, it is frequently used by marine biologists as a size reference in photos to measure corals and other objects.

<doc id="1176812" wikidata="Q3540382" url="?curid=1176812" title="Frank Worrell Trophy">
<text>The Frank Worrell Trophy is awarded to the winner of the West Indies–Australia Test match series in cricket. The trophy is named after Frank Worrell who was the first black captain of the West Indies. It was first awarded at the end of the 1960–61 series in Australia, the first Test of which ended in a tie. The Australian Cricket Board of Control and Don Bradman commissioned former Test cricketer and professional jeweller Ernie McCormick to create a perpetual trophy following the tie. The trophy&#x27;s design incorporated a ball used in the tied Test.

, Australia hold the trophy following the 1–1 series draw in the West Indies 2023–24 tour. Australia also lead in overall wins, winning 15 of the 25 series, while the West Indies have won 8, the remaining 3 ending in draws (with the trophy being retained by the incumbents). Brian Lara is the most successful batsman in the history of the trophy, scoring 2,815 runs for the West Indies in 56 innings at an average of 52.12. He also holds the record for the highest score (277) which he made in the third Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground during the 1992–93 series. West Indian fast bowler Courtney Walsh has taken the most wickets in the trophy, with 135 over 38 matches, at an average of 28.68, while Australia&#x27;s Graham McKenzie has the best bowling figures of 8 wickets for 71 runs, achieved in the second Test of the 1968–69 series. Australian Mark Waugh has taken the most catches, with 45 in 28 matches, while West Indian Jeff Dujon is the most successful wicketkeeper, making 84 dismissals in 23 matches.

==History==
Frank Worrell became the first black captain of the West Indies cricket team prior to their 1960–61 tour of Australia. The first Test of the five-match series ended in a tie, the first in the history of Test cricket. Don Bradman remarked to Australia captain Richie Benaud, &quot;That is the greatest thing that&#x27;s ever happened to the game&quot;. Evelyn Wellings described the Test as &quot;the Greatest Test Match, the Greatest Cricket Match and surely the Greatest Game ever played with a ball&quot;. Despite that setback, with Benaud claiming the Australians had &quot;thrown away a match&quot;, they went on to win the series 2–1 with one drawn Test. Former cricketer and journalist Johnny Moyes declared the series to be &quot;the most wonderful cricket tour Australia has known&quot;. The West Indies team received acclaim for their performances, the whole series was played in a convivial manner, and the Australians, suitably impressed by Worrell, named the trophy after him.

Winning the first and third Tests of the 1964–65 series, the West Indians took the trophy to the Caribbean for the first time. The following three series were all won by Australia, with the 1975–76 series ending 5–1. The West Indies sole Test victory in the latter series, at the WACA Ground in Perth, was by an innings and 87 runs. It featured an explosive innings from West Indian batsman Roy Fredericks who struck 169 from 145 deliveries and was described by former batsman Lindsay Hassett as the &quot;greatest innings I&#x27;ve seen in Australia&quot;. The 1977–78 series saw the beginning of fifteen years of West Indian dominance in the trophy, but it was not without controversy. The first two Tests of that series were completed within three days, the second being notable for Graham Yallop becoming the first batsman to wear a helmet at the crease. With the West Indies team departing to join Kerry Packer&#x27;s World Series Cricket as the World Series Cricket West Indies XI, Australia managed a victory against the second-string team in the third Test but were beaten by 198 runs in the fourth. The final Test saw the West Indies eight wickets down with more than 100 runs needed when Vanburn Holder was dismissed. Although the decision was legitimate, Holder&#x27;s reaction on the way back to the pavilion was interpreted otherwise, and the Jamaican crowds began to riot. The match was abandoned, and with two of the three umpires refusing to consider a sixth day&#x27;s play, the result was declared a draw. The 1981–82 series was drawn overall, with one victory each and one draw, thus the West Indies retained the trophy.

After drawing the first two Tests of the 1983–84 series, the West Indies swept the Australians aside, winning the remaining Tests, two by ten wickets and one by an innings and 36 runs. They continued their good form in the following series in Australia, with dominant wins in the first three Tests, losing the final Test (a dead rubber at that point) to secure the trophy with a 3–1 victory. The West Indies were consistently superior over the next three series, winning seven Test matches to Australia&#x27;s three, thereby holding the Frank Worrell Trophy from 1978 to 1993. The final and deciding Test of the 1992–93 series saw Curtly Ambrose take seven wickets for one run in 32 deliveries, reducing Australia from 85 for 2 to 119 all out. For the 1994–95 series, the West Indies brought in a new coach and a new manager. Despite a fourth wicket stand of 124 between Brian Lara and Carl Hooper after the West Indies had been reduced to 6 runs for 3 wickets, Australia secured a ten-wicket victory inside three days. A draw in the second Test was followed by a nine-wicket victory for the West Indies in the third. The fourth and final Test was later referred to as &quot;make or break for both teams&quot; by the Australian bowler Paul Reiffel. Although Richie Richardson scored a century in the first innings, this was overshadowed by the Waugh brothers – Mark made 126 while Steve scored 200; together they shared a 231-run fourth wicket stand to push Australia to a formidable total.

Australia made it back-to-back series wins with a 3–2 victory in 1996–97, yet could only draw the series in the West Indies in 1998–99. However, the 2000–01 series saw the emergence of a commanding Australian Test team, who would go undefeated against the West Indies until 2024. That series saw the Australians whitewash the Caribbeans, winning 5–0, the first such result since the West Indies toured Australia and New Zealand in 1930–31. The defeat was unsurprising; the West Indies had been whitewashed in their previous three Test series, in Pakistan, South Africa and New Zealand. Australia took the 2003 series 3–1, and won the following seven series without losing a Test, including three more whitewashes in the 2005–06 series, 2015 series and 2022–23 series. The second Test of the 2023–24 series at the Gabba saw Australia&#x27;s record undefeated run come to an end where the West Indies won by 8 runs. Overall, Australia have won 50 of the 105 Test matches played for the Frank Worrell Trophy, with the West Indies winning 31.

<text>Terry Alan Smiljanich (born March 1, 1947) is a retired American lawyer who acted as counsel to the United States Senate during the congressional hearings on the Iran-Contra affair. In 1983 Smiljanich co-founded the law firm Blasingame, Forizs &amp; Smiljanich.

==Early life==

Smiljanich was born in Tampa, Florida in 1947 to Peter and Olga Smiljanich. His father was in the Air Force and the family traveled extensively, with stays in Japan, Mississippi, Florida and Texas. He attended Alamo Heights High School, Randolph High School on Randolph Air Force Base in Texas, and graduated in 1965 from Thomas Jefferson High School in Tampa, Florida.

==Education==

Smiljanich attended the University of Florida, where he met his wife Dorothy Weik in 1967 (they married in 1969). He graduated in 1969 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English, and attended the University of Florida College of Law, serving as editor of the &quot;University of Florida Law Review&quot; and graduating in 1972.

==Career==

Smiljanich served as a law clerk to United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida Judge Ben Krentzman in Tampa from 1972 to 1974. He was Assistant United States Attorney for the Middle District of Florida from 1974 to 1977. While serving as a federal prosecutor, he handled organized crime cases, kidnappings, bank robberies, and environmental crimes, among other prosecutions. He won convictions of several organized crime figures. Smiljanich served in the United States Army Reserve from 1972 to 1981, and became a captain.

Smiljanich acted as counsel to the United States Senate during the congressional hearings on the Iran-Contra affair. His responsibilities included investigations of State Department and White House personnel involved in the political scandal. He conducted the public interrogation of former United States Secretary of the Treasury and Chief of Staff Donald Regan during the televised hearings.

In 1983 Smiljanich co-founded the law firm Blasingame, Forizs &amp; Smiljanich. He was a partner there until 1997 when the firm merged with James, Hoyer &amp; Newcomer the firm became James, Hoyer, Newcomer &amp; Smiljanich, P.A. where he was a senior partner. As a lawyer he has been critical of mortgage banks and the practices in the private mortgage insurance business estimating that over one million homeowners in the U.S. were victims of the industry&#x27;s failure to warn them about credit report issues that could raise premiums to over $700 a month on a $200,000 loan. He is the founder and managing editor of the Consumer Warning Network writing extensively for that organization. In his capacity at the Network he has been interviewed on local and national news programs and appeared in videos produced by the organization on a variety of topics including the foreclosure crisis, consumer scams and homeopathy.

With Charles Wachter he authored a book for lawyers on class action suits in Florida.

==Skepticism==

He was a founding member and from 1989 to 2015 served as Chairman (now &quot;Chairman Emeritus&quot;) of the Tampa Bay Skeptics, a scientific skeptic non-profit organization (affiliated with the Center for Inquiry) that Smiljanich says is &quot;devoted to critical examination of paranormal and fringe-science claims&quot;. He described the goals of the organization &quot;to counteract some of the kooks out there&quot; and &quot;attempt to impose some rationality in the world.&quot;

In a 1990 letter to the editor he chided the &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; for a credulous review of a book on UFOs saying such content may boost circulation, &quot;but do little to encourage proper skepticism in a country quickly slipping into scientific illiteracy.&quot; In another letter to the editor of the paper, in 1993, he called astrology and creationism pseudosciences whose claims should be subject to scientific analysis, going on to say, &quot;The fact that they have failed miserably in that regard allows scientists to throw them into the garbage heap along with flat earths, mind reading, and fortune telling.&quot; In a 2008 &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; article on a guardian angel seminar Matt Albucher quotes Smiljanich, &quot;I say before you believe in something, you should require some credible evidence. In this case, there is none.&quot;

Since 1989 the Tampa Bay Skeptics has offered a $1,000 challenge to anyone able to prove the existence of paranormal powers under mutually agreed testing protocols, similar to the One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge offered by the James Randi Educational Foundation. There have been ten attempts, including two that were televised, and no successes.

From 1988 to 2013 the Tampa Bay Skeptics published a quarterly newsletter, &quot;The Tampa Bay Skeptics Report&quot; for which Smiljanich was a regular contributor. He has written for the &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot;, a national magazine published by the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry and &quot;The Tampa Tribune&quot;. In 2010 he spoke at a meeting of the Humanist Society of the Suncoast in Florida.

==Philanthropy==

Smiljanich is a member of the Major Gifts Committee for the University of Florida College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and bequeathed $1 million to the school. He is also a board member of the Advisory Council for the Department of Astronomy at the University.

==Hobby==

A member and officer of the Alachua Astronomy Club, Smiljanich is an amateur astronomer.

<text>was considered to be one of Japan&#x27;s most powerful and influential building tycoons. He joined the real estate business of his father, Taikichiro Mori, after graduating from the University of Tokyo and was president and CEO of Mori Building, of which he and his older brother Kei&#x27;s (a university professor) families owned 100%. He owned 12.74% of Sunwood Corporation.

The family name is found on many real estate developments in Japan. Minoru and his brother Akira were listed on the Forbes list of the world&#x27;s richest men. His largest project was the Roppongi Hills development in Tokyo, which opened in 2003. The Shanghai World Financial Center, once China&#x27;s tallest building, was completed in 2008. Mori acknowledged the influence of Le Corbusier but believed he had surpassed the Swiss architect&#x27;s urban designs, particularly in the Roppongi Hills project.

In 2006, Mori&#x27;s last development, Omotesando Hills, opened near Harajuku station consisting of a set of ramped shopping floors.

In 2008, he was named Asia Businessman of the Year 2007 by Fortune magazine.

In 2009, he was honoured as an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) by Queen Elizabeth II. He died of heart failure in 2012. He was 77.

<doc id="1176845" wikidata="Q1966947" url="?curid=1176845" title="National Barn Dance">
<text>National Barn Dance, broadcast by WLS-AM in Chicago, Illinois starting in 1924, was one of the first American country music radio programs and a direct precursor of the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot;.

&quot;National Barn Dance&quot; also set the stage for other similar programs, in part because the clear-channel signal of WLS could be received throughout most of the Midwest and even beyond in the late evening and nighttime hours, making much of the United States (and Canada) a potential audience. The program was well received and thus widely imitated. &quot;National Barn Dance&quot; ended its broadcast in 1968.

==History==

&quot;National Barn Dance&quot; was founded by Edgar L. Bill. To him goes the credit for arranging to have a program of &quot;down-home&quot; tunes broadcast from radio station WLS, of which Bill was then director. Having lived on a farm, he knew how people loved the familiar sound and informal spirit of old-fashioned barn dance music. The first broadcast was an impromptu sustaining program. An avalanche of telephone calls and letters indicated a definite demand from the public for this type of broadcast, and &quot;National Barn Dance&quot; was born. It first aired on WLS on April 19, 1924, and originated from the Eighth Street Theater starting in 1931. The show was picked up by NBC Radio in 1933. NBC expanded the program&#x27;s coverage in 1942, adding it to the schedules of international broadcast shortwave stations. In 1946, it switched to the ABC Radio Network and aired until 1952 on Saturday nights from 6:30 p.m. to midnight.

George D. Hay (a.k.a. The Solemn Ole Judge) has always claimed that he started the WLS &quot;Barn Dance&quot; when he worked for them as an announcer, but research is showing that this was a falsehood of documented history and that his claim was to help him get a job as the first director of WSM Radio c. 1925 Nashville, Tennessee.

The show regularly featured Gene Autry, Henry Burr, Red Foley, The Three Little Maids, Jenny Lou Carson, Eddie Dean, Lulu Belle and Scotty, Pat Buttram, George Gobel, The Williams Brothers (featuring future crooner Andy Williams), Arkansas Woodchopper, The DeZurik Sisters and the Hoosier Hot Shots. Other guests included Smiley Burnette, Eddie Peabody and Joe Kelly, best remembered today as the host and moderator of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Quiz Kids&quot;. The announcer was Jack Holden and it was once sponsored by Alka-Seltzer. The program aired from The Center Theater in Chicago, and people used to stand outside in the snow and cold waiting to get in. The National Barn Dance was the only known radio program to charge an admission fee.

ABC made two moves that ultimately led to &quot;National Barn Dance&quot;&#x27;s slow demise. The first was the cancellation of the network broadcast in 1952. After a few years, audiences finally began to wane, and the program ceased live performances after 1957. The show continued to air on WLS until 1959 when ABC bought the station and changed the format to Top 40 rock and roll, canceling &quot;National Barn Dance&quot; outright. The show moved to Chicago&#x27;s WGN-AM, with Orion Samuelson as the show&#x27;s host, until it finally left the air in 1968.

===Chronology===
*1924–33: WLS (AM)
**1925–28: Two separate versions, WLS-AM (&quot;National Barn Dance&quot;) and WSM-AM (&quot;WSM Barn Dance&quot;); the latter became the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot; in 1928
*1933–46: WLS (AM), carried by NBC Radio
*1946–52: WLS (AM), carried by ABC Radio
*1952–60: WLS (AM)
*1960–68: WGN-AM

== Performers ==
==Film and TV==
A fictionalized account of the show&#x27;s origins, &quot;The National Barn Dance&quot; (1944), was filmed by director Hugh Bennett from a screenplay by Hal Fimberg and Lee Loeb. The film starred Jean Heather, Charles Quigley, Robert Benchley, Mabel Paige and Charles Dingle, while Pat Buttram and Joe Kelly appeared as themselves. Two acts who were radio show regulars, The Hoosier Hotshots and The Dinning Sisters, also had featured musical spots in the film. Paramount Pictures reportedly paid WLS $75,000 for the rights in 1943.

&quot;ABC Barn Dance&quot;, a filmed TV series featuring some of the radio performers, was telecast on ABC from February 21–November 14, 1949. Hosted by Jack Stillwell and Hal O&#x27;Halloran, the 30-minute musical variety format presented a mix of folk music with country and Western tunes.

In 1964, it became a nationally syndicated program through Mid-America Video Tape Productions, then a subsidiary of television station WGN-TV in Chicago (the predecessor of Tribune Entertainment).

==Offshoots==
In 1925, prior to network radio or syndication, Hay brought his &quot;Barn Dance&quot; concept to Nashville, Tennessee. The result was a show called the &quot;WSM Barn Dance&quot;. It became so popular that on December 10, 1927, Hay renamed it the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot;. WSM became one of the first NBC affiliates in 1927, and the &quot;Opry&quot; is still on the air today.

A second program was launched in the 1930s by &quot;National Barn Dance&quot;&#x27;s then-president John Lair in Renfro Valley, Kentucky; the &quot;Renfro Valley Barn Dance&quot; still takes place weekly but is no longer aired on radio (although a sister program, the &quot;Renfro Valley Gatherin&#x27;&quot;, does still air weekly on Sunday mornings).

<text>Charles Holland Locke, (September 16, 1887 – May 30, 1980) was a Canadian Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada.

Born in Morden, Manitoba, he served articles first with a law firm in Morden, then moved to Winnipeg to finish his articles in the office of Albert Hudson, who was later appointed to the Supreme Court. Locke was called to the bar of Manitoba in 1910 but interrupted his legal practice to serve overseas with the Canadian military in World War I, being awarded the Military Cross. After the War, he returned to practise in Winnipeg, but in 1928 he moved to Vancouver, joining the bar of British Columbia.

Locke was appointed to the Supreme Court of Canada on June 3, 1947, filling the vacancy caused by the death of his mentor, Albert Hudson. He was the first person born in western Canada to be appointed to the Supreme Court. He served as Puisne Justice until September 16, 1962.

In 1971, he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada.

==Personal life==
His son, Charles Conrad Locke (September 24, 1917–October 1, 2011), was a justice of both the Supreme Court of British Columbia and British Columbia Court of Appeal.

<text>The Blue Ribbon Online Free Speech Campaign (officially the Blue Ribbon Campaign for Online Freedom of Speech, Press and Association) is an online advocacy campaign for intellectual freedom on the Internet, orchestrated by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). Web site owners are encouraged to place images of blue ribbons on their sites and link to EFF&#x27;s campaign. This is done so that they can help spread awareness of the threats to unrestricted speech in new media.

==History==
The campaign was launched immediately after the passing of the Communications Decency Act (CDA) in the United States on February 1, 1996, followed by the Black World Wide Web protest on February 8, 1996, and remained popular throughout the 1990s and into the early 2000s. The Communications Decency Act was ruled unconstitutional in large part by the Supreme Court on June 26, 1997 in a joint ACLU/EFF suit. EFF relaunched the campaign on June 15, 1998 to raise awareness of other legislation that they felt threatened freedom of expression online, especially the CDA follow-up bill, the Child Online Protection Act (COPA), also eventually overturned.

<text>Gina Bachauer (Greek: Τζίνα Μπαχάουερ; May 21, 1913, AthensAugust 22, 1976, Athens) was a Greek classical pianist who toured extensively in the United States and Europe. Interested in piano at a young age, Bachauer graduated from the Athens Conservatory and studied under Alfred Cortot and Sergei Rachmaninoff. She is best known for playing Romantic piano concertos. She played hundreds of concerts for the Allied troops in the Middle East during World War II while she lived in Egypt. She spent a lot of time touring the United States and Europe, giving over 100 concerts each year. Bachauer also recorded extensively, both as a soloist and with orchestras. She received an honorary doctorate from the University of Utah. During her career she was called the &quot;queen of pianists&quot;. The Gina Bachauer International Piano Foundation was named in honor of her contributions to the musical world. In her personal life, Bachauer married music conductor Alec Sherman, who became her manager. She died at the age of 63 at the Athens Festival.

== Biography ==
Gina Bachauer was born in Athens, Greece in a Jewish family. She was interested in the piano from a young age; she gave her first recital as a child in her hometown of Athens. She graduated from the Athens Conservatory in 1929. She gained further piano instruction from Alfred Cortot and Sergei Rachmaninoff. Her studies under Rachmaninoff involved trailing him around the world, requesting lessons even as he toured. Her debut performance with an orchestra was in 1932. She had three &quot;debuts&quot; before her career truly took off. Her first debut was interrupted by her father&#x27;s financial problems; she returned to Greece to work for her family. Her next debut was interrupted by World War II, but she continued playing, practicing, and looking for opportunities. She gave hundreds of concerts all over the world by the end of her career. Bachauer played a wide range of music but was most known for her performances of Romantic piano concertos.

She married Alec Sherman after playing with the New London Orchestra under his direction. Sherman left his conducting career to become Bachauer&#x27;s manager. She died in 1976 of a heart attack at the Athens Festival, on the day she was to appear as a soloist with the National Symphony Orchestra of Washington, D.C.

== Career ==

Bachauer toured the American and European continents throughout her career, giving over 100 concerts each year. She would travel and perform eleven months out of the year. In 1965, she had done 14 coast-to-coast tours of the United States. She performed solo recitals in addition to her performances with orchestras. She received critical acclaim for her work and was called the &quot;queen of pianists&quot; during her busy career. After her studies under Cortot and Rachmaninoff, she toured Italy, Yugoslavia, Greece, and Egypt, but the outbreak of World War II stranded her in Cairo. There, she gave concerts to troops in the area, expanding her repertoire beyond classical music for a time because it bored the troops. She considered her 1935 performance with the Athens Symphony Orchestra as her true debut, as it launched her career more than any of her previous performances. In 1955, she performed in the Herodes Atticus Theatre before King Paul and Queen Frederika. She was the first solo pianist to do so. She debuted in the United States in 1950 and, despite a low turnout, received positive reviews.

Recording music was also a significant part of Bachauer&#x27;s career. She recorded for the HMV (His Master&#x27;s Voice), RCA Victor, and Mercury labels. She did recordings with orchestras and released her own solo albums.

During her three decades as the &quot;queen of pianists&quot;, Bachauer took time to support young pianists by listening to them perform and offering her advice. In 1973, she took a short break from touring to judge the American Music Scholarship Association&#x27;s piano competition and worked with the students who competed.

Bachauer was also the piano teacher of Princess Irene and gave piano lessons to King Paul. Princess Irene performed with Bachauer on some of her tours in the United States, including concerts in Salt Lake City, Seattle, Cincinnati, and Dallas. The Dallas Symphony Orchestra reached out to Bachauer in 1971 when they were experiencing financial difficulty. In response, Bachauer brought Princess Irene to perform a two-piano concerto with her as part of a Dallas Symphony Orchestra program. The novelty of a Greek princess combined with the popularity of Bachauer brought in a huge audience, as well as $100,000 for the struggling orchestra.

Bachauer was a close friend of Maurice Abravanel and often appeared with the Utah Symphony Orchestra. She was considered an honorary citizen of Utah and held an honorary doctorate of music from the University of Utah. The Gina Bachauer International Piano foundation is based in Salt Lake City. She also frequently played with the London Philharmonic and the BBC Orchestra.

==Legacy==
The Gina Bachauer International Piano Foundation&#x27;s programs include educational outreach and prestigious competitions. The Gina Bachauer International Piano Competition was established in 1976 in her honor. It attracts young pianists worldwide to Salt Lake City each year. As of 1997, the house in which Bachauer lived in Halandri stood empty, though it was still taken care of, along with the stray cats that Bachauer fed when she was alive, by friends and neighbors.

In 1981, the Greek Post issued a stamp in Bachauer&#x27;s honor. She is considered one of the greatest pianists of the 20th century.

<text>The Rhode Island Computer Museum is a vintage computer museum located in Warwick, Rhode Island, United States. The museum&#x27;s Learning Lab and display space are in the lower level of the La-Z-Boy building at 1755 Bald Hill Road, Warwick, RI 02886. The museum&#x27;s warehouse is in Bldg 310 Compass Circle, Suite C, North Kingstown. With technology’s rapid transformation, the rich history of the development of computers and digital technology can easily get lost, and the museum aims to preserve this history to inspire young people with an interest in technology.

The official purpose of the museum is “procuring and preserving whatever relates to computer science and its history, disseminating knowledge, and encouraging research in computer science by means of visits, lectures, discussions, and publications.”

== History ==
The museum began in 1996 with a core group, all of whom had been members of a British sports car club. Talking among themselves, the eventual founders of the museum decided that a former computer museum in Boston was failing to inform and inspire future generations about the origins of the computer.

The museum was formally established as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit in 1999.

In 2015, the museum also started leasing space in the Meadows Professional Office Complex to offer a more interactive experience, including classes for the community and students.

== Collection ==
The museum occupies 5,000 square feet of warehouse space housing software and hardware spanning decades, books, computers, printers, floppy disks, hard drives, and many other electronic items. People from around the country have made donations to the collection. The museum also sometimes refurbishes computers and other hardware and donated it to people in the community who otherwise could not afford these items.

On display are a number of personal microcomputers from the United States and UK, and mainframe computers (e.g. DEC VAXes, Wang 2200-VP, DEC PDP-8, -9, -10, -11, -12, etc.). The collection also includes examples of Sequent multi-processor machines, a Data General Eclipse from the Harvard Cyclotron, one of two surviving Astronautics, and a large selection of Wang VS machines.

The museum&#x27;s Learning Lab is open 10am to 5pm, only on Saturdays, and has about two dozen active volunteer members who both care for and explain the collection. The Lab and Warehouse are open at other times by appointment.

== Educational outreach ==
Members of the RICM run programming and robotics workshops at public libraries in Rhode Island and host their own workshops in the museum. Known as the &quot;Learning Lab&quot;, the RICM offers classes for students interested in the uses of digital and traditional media to promote creativity, critical thinking, and hands-on computer learning opportunities. Workshop offerings include computer coding with &quot;Minecraft&quot;, dissecting electronic devices, using Raspberry Pis (credit-card sized computers), and operating with Arduinos (open software program used for interactive projects).

== Media appearances ==
RICM has been contacted to rent equipment for the sets of shows and movies from small independent projects to Hollywood blockbusters. In 2015, about one-third of the museum&#x27;s total revenue came from such deals with entertainment companies.

Below is a list of films/TV shows that have used the museum&#x27;s collection as part of their set design:

* &quot;Hidden Figures&quot;
* &quot;Joy&quot;
* &quot;Halt and Catch Fire&quot;
* &quot;The Americans&quot;
* &quot;Knives Out&quot;

<text>Frederik L. Schodt (born January 22, 1950) is an American translator, interpreter, and writer.

== Biography ==
Schodt&#x27;s father was in the US foreign service, and he grew up in Norway, Australia, and Japan. The family first went to Japan in 1965 when Schodt was fifteen. They left in 1967, but Schodt remained to graduate from American School in Japan in Tokyo in 1968. After entering the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), in 1970, Schodt returned to Japan and studied Japanese intensively at International Christian University (ICU) for a year and half. He graduated from UCSB in 1972, and after a brief bohemian stint at a variety of jobs and traveling, he became a tour guide in Los Angeles for Japanese tourists, also escorting them to Canada and Mexico. After trying to interpret for a group once at Sunkist, he realized that he could become an interpreter, but needed further training. In 1975, he was awarded a scholarship from Japan&#x27;s Ministry of Education, to return to ICU and study translation and interpreting. After finishing his studies at ICU in 1977, he began working in the translation department of Simul International, in Tokyo. In mid-1978, he returned to the United States, and since then has worked in San Francisco as a freelance writer, translator, and interpreter.

While working in Tokyo in 1977, he joined with several university friends in contacting Tezuka Productions. They sought permission to translate the &quot;Phoenix&quot; comic into English.

Schodt is notable in manga and anime fandom for his translations of works such as Osamu Tezuka&#x27;s &quot;Phoenix&quot;, Tezuka&#x27;s &quot;Astro Boy&quot;, Riyoko Ikeda&#x27;s &quot;The Rose of Versailles&quot;, Keiji Nakazawa&#x27;s &quot;Barefoot Gen&quot;, Henry Yoshitaka Kiyama&#x27;s &quot;The Four Immigrants Manga&quot;, and others.

His best known book is &quot;Manga! Manga! The World of Japanese Comics&quot;, published in 1983 and reprinted several times, with an introduction by Tezuka.

&quot;Manga! Manga!&quot; won a prize at the &quot;Manga Oscar Awards&quot; in 1983. Furthermore, in 2000 Schodt was awarded the Asahi Shimbun&#x27;s Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize &quot;Special Prize&quot; for his outstanding contribution to the appreciation of manga worldwide.

<text>The Human Shield Action to Iraq was a group of people who traveled to Iraq to act as human shields with the aim of preventing the U.S.-led coalition forces from bombing certain locations during the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

== Chronology ==
In December 2002, Kenneth O&#x27;Keefe, an ex-U.S. marine and Persian Gulf War veteran who had attempted multiple times to renounce his U.S. citizenship, posted a call to action for large numbers of western citizens to migrate to Iraq and deploy themselves as &quot;Human Shields&quot;. The action was ultimately named the TJP (Truth Justice Peace) Human Shield Action to Iraq. O&#x27;Keefe believed that protests and petitions had no chance of preventing the invasion and that a large presence of western citizens, strategically placed in Iraq at potential targets, was the only viable deterrent to war. He argued that thousands of human shields deployed to these sites would make the invasion politically untenable. O&#x27;Keefe publicly acknowledged Saddam Hussein as a &quot;violent dictator&quot; and &quot;mass-murderer&quot; before he arrived in Iraq; it has been speculated he did this in an attempt to neutralize the perception that the human shields were simply pawns of Saddam. Consequently, he received no favor from Saddam, his influence within the action declined rapidly as he traveled to Iraq, and eventually he was deported days before the invasion. Before his deportation he repeatedly alleged Western support for Hussein during some of his most notorious atrocities; ultimately he argued that it was the people of Iraq who would suffer most from war.

In January 2003 a group of anti-war activists joined O&#x27;Keefe in London and set out to carry out the plan. On 25 January 2003 a group of 50 volunteers left London and headed for Baghdad with the intention of acting as human shields. The convoy travelled through Europe and Turkey by bus and picked up more volunteers along the way, totalling roughly 75 people. It has been estimated that 200 to 500 people eventually made their way into Iraq before the invasion in March.

Upon reaching Baghdad, a strategy was formed on the assumption that there would not be enough human shields to avert an invasion. This was to involve the voluntary deployment of activists to strategic locations throughout Baghdad, and possibly Basra, in an effort to avert the bombing of those locations. There was much internal debate about which locations were to be chosen.
Eventually volunteers deployed to Al Daura Electrical Plant, Baghdad South Electrical Plant, 7 April Water Treatment Plant, Al Daura Water Treatment Plant, Tejio Food Silo, Al Daura Oil Refinery and Al Mamun Telecommunications Facility.

The need to work closely with the Iraqi government was not something many of shield volunteers felt comfortable with. Some felt that the list delivered by the officials compromised their autonomy. Others felt that they would rather be deployed in schools, hospitals, and orphanages. These shield volunteers left Iraq. The rest took up residence at the sites, a list of which was sent to the Joint Chiefs of Staff together with a request that they recognize the activists&#x27; assertion that targeting these sites would be in violation of Article 54 Protocol Additional to the Geneva Convention. There was no response to the letters.

At its peak the total of shield volunteers in Baghdad numbered about 500, but the realization that the thousands needed to have a chance of stopping attacks on Baghdad had not materialized, combined with the failure of the United Nations to forestall war, meant that bombing was imminent. Many of the shields chose to stay; many others chose to leave. Still others, like O’Keefe, were ordered out by the Iraqi government. Some, including a 21-year-old, Tom Hurndall, a young photo-journalist, who had travelled to observe and work with the human shields, left Baghdad over concerns as to the activities being undertaken. He subsequently went to the Palestinian territories where he was shot by an Israeli soldier while working with and photographing the International Solidarity Movement.

None of the 80 shields who stayed in Baghdad throughout the war were killed or injured. None of the sites where they were residing were destroyed.

During their deployments a small group of volunteers led by Gordon Sloan of New Zealand took on the job of vetting sites to ensure they were not in close proximity to military facilities. This was to be the cause of some conflict with their Iraqi host, Dr. Abdul Razak al-Hashimi, Saddam Hussein&#x27;s spokesman during the first Gulf War, and head of the Friendship, Peace and Solidarity organisation which was hosting the activists under the authority of the Ba&#x27;athist Iraqi government.

With an invasion imminent Hashimi became frustrated by Sloan&#x27;s explorations, called a meeting, and asked the activists to deploy to sites or leave Iraq. Hashimi&#x27;s meeting is said by some of the leading volunteers to have been a costly political mistake. It was the trigger of much anxiety among the volunteers and negative reporting in the media, including mis-reports that activists were being forced to deploy to military sites. It was also at this point that some of the British volunteers were to return to London along with the two double-decker red buses and their owner, which were originally meant to have left soon after arrival.

The paranoia that rose up around Hashimi&#x27;s announcement and the reports that the buses were leaving Iraq slowed the influx of activists into Iraq, and caused some of those already there to leave Iraq, believing they had lost credibility through Hashimi&#x27;s actions. The Iraqi authorities, on the other hand, saw Kenneth O&#x27;Keefe, Sloan, and other organisers as constantly challenging Hashimi&#x27;s authority and being deliberately disruptive, and that some would-be shields were taking too long to deploy to sites. Five of the &#x27;trouble makers&#x27; were then asked to leave the country.

Many activists stayed on, however, and remained at the chosen sites. It is claimed that eighty human shields stayed in the Baghdad area throughout the bombing campaign.

== Analysis and effects of the human shields ==

On 26 February 2003, Senior CNN Pentagon Correspondent, Jamie McIntyre, commented that the &quot;Pentagon says they will try to work around human shields&quot; as long as they were not deployed to military sites. Of all the shielded sites, only the Al Mamun Telecommunications Facility – arguably a legitimate target under the Geneva Conventions – was eventually bombed, one day after the human shields pulled out of it.

For violating a U.S. prewar travel ban, human shields from the U.S. faced fines and/or imprisonment. On the day after the departure of the human shield convoy, White House Chief of Staff, Andrew Card, released a statement condemning the action and Fox News reported that U.S. leaders were considering prosecuting U.S. human shields for war crimes.

=== Criticisms ===
The Human Shield Movement was criticized for what many saw as being an overt act of aiding Saddam Hussein&#x27;s governance. Charges of the shields being &quot;dupes&quot; and &quot;useful idiots&quot; for Saddam were widespread in the U.S. The participants argued that while various governments around the globe carry out acts of aggression, the human shield action was aimed at averting one.

Human Rights Watch stated that &quot;civilians acting as human shields, whether voluntary or not, contribute indirectly to the war capability of a state. Their actions do not pose a direct risk to opposing forces. Because they are not directly engaged in hostilities against an adversary, they retain their civilian immunity from attack.&quot; Human Rights Watch also noted that the use by a state of human shields, voluntary or not, is a violation of international law, citing Protocol I of the First Geneva Convention.

Jonah Goldberg claimed after a debate with O&#x27;Keefe, that &quot;O&#x27;Keefe and his friends are objectively in favor of Saddam Hussein and his murderous regime because they believe he is uniquely worth defending with their bodies. They may be brave, I guess, but they&#x27;re still idiots, and I&#x27;m sure Saddam is grateful for them&quot;.

Maria Ermanno, chairwoman of the Swedish Peace and Arbitration Society, cited reports that Iraqi officials were arranging transportation, accommodations and news conferences for the human shields and that they were being used for propaganda purposes by Saddam Hussein: &quot;To go down to Iraq and live and act there on the regime&#x27;s expense, then you&#x27;re supporting a terrible dictator. I think that method is entirely wrong,&quot; Ermanno told Swedish Radio.

The Iraqi government was also criticized for encouraging and facilitating the human shield actions, since this was a violation of international law and Protocol I, article 20 of the Geneva Convention.

A decade after the start of the Iraq War a number of human shields were interviewed for an article on the movement. None of them regretted having taken part in the action. &quot;It was the right thing to do,&quot; claimed Eric Levy who was at Dura oil refinery in southern Baghdad for the duration of the air campaign: &quot;The war was illegal and immoral. We may have failed to stop the invasion, but by putting ourselves in harm&#x27;s way, we sent a clear message to the world. A message that will hopefully continue to reverberate.&quot;

<text>Greer County, a county created by the Texas legislature on February 8, 1860 (and was named for John Alexander Greer, Lieutenant Governor of Texas), was land claimed by both Texas and the United States. The region of Greer County is now in present-day Oklahoma.

==Origin of the dispute==
The dispute arose from a map submitted with the Adams–Onís Treaty of 1819. The treaty stated that the boundary between the French claims on the north and the Spanish claims on the south was Rio Roxo de Natchitoches (Red River) until it reached the 100th meridian west as noted on John Melish&#x27;s map published in 1818. The problem was that the 100th meridian on the Melish map was some east of the true 100th meridian and the Red River forked about east of the 100th meridian. Texas claimed the land south of the North Fork (red on the map) and the United States claimed the land north of the South Fork (blue on the map, later called the Prairie Dog Town Fork Red River). 

==&quot;United States vs. State of Texas&quot;==

The dispute resulted in a lawsuit, which was heard by the Supreme Court under its original jurisdiction. The Court&#x27;s opinion, in &quot;United States v. State of Texas&quot; , issued on March 16, held that the land of some belonged to the United States. Following that ruling, on May 4, 1896, the land was officially assigned by Congress to Oklahoma Territory. The Greer County Homestead Law, passed just afterwards, gave the Texas settlers the they were living on and the option to purchase an additional 160 acres for .

==Legacy==
When Oklahoma became the 46th U.S. state on November 16, 1907, old &quot;Greer County&quot; was divided into Greer, Jackson, and southwest Beckham counties. Harmon County was created May 22, 1909 by a vote of the people from a portion of Greer County.

<text>Daniel Joseph O&#x27;Keeffe (2 June 1907 – 2 June 1967), known as &quot;Danno&quot;, was an Irish Gaelic footballer, regarded by some as the greatest goalkeeper in the history of the sport.

==Career==
O&#x27;Keeffe was born in Fermoy, County Cork, but the family moved to Tralee, County Kerry when he was nine-years-old. His first competitive football was played with a junior team, the Rangers, but when he advanced to senior grade he joined Kerins O&#x27;Rahilly&#x27;s and with them won two County Championship titles. O&#x27;Keeffe made his first inter-county appearance on the Kerry junior team that won the All-Ireland Junior Championship in 1930. A year later he was the substitute goalkeeper on the Kerry senior team to meet Kildare in the All-Ireland final, however, a few hours before the game he was informed that he would be playing and collected his first winners&#x27; medal. O&#x27;Keeffe was first-choice goalkeeper for seventeen years in total and claimed a then record of seven All-Ireland Championship titles. His other honours include a record 14 Munster Championship medals and two National League titles. O&#x27;Keeffe was also a regular on the Munster team and won three Railway Cup medals, including one as captain of the team. Playing until he was 41 years old, he was posthumously named on the Football Team of the Century and the Football Team of the Millennium.

==Personal life and death==
O&#x27;Keeffe worked for Kerry County Council in Tralee and was eventually promoted to the post of Clerical Officer in charge of the staff on the roads division. He married Mary Moriarty in 1939 and had two children. O&#x27;Keeffe died suddenly on 2 June 1967.

<doc id="1176875" wikidata="Q4827044" url="?curid=1176875" title="Autovivification">
<text>In the Perl programming language, autovivification is the automatic creation of new arrays and hashes as required every time an undefined value is dereferenced. Perl autovivification allows a programmer to refer to a structured variable, and arbitrary sub-elements of that structured variable, without expressly declaring the existence of the variable and its complete structure beforehand.

In contrast, other programming languages either:

# Require a programmer to expressly declare an entire variable structure before using or referring to any part of it; or
# Require a programmer to declare a part of a variable structure before referring to any part of it; or
# Create an assignment to a part of a variable before referring, assigning to or composing an expression that refers to any part of it.

Perl autovivification can be contrasted against languages such as Python, PHP, Ruby, and many of the C style languages, where dereferencing null or undefined values is not generally permitted. It can be compared to the HTML standard&#x27;s &quot;named access on the window object&quot; which results in corresponding globally scoped variables being automatically accessible to browser-based JavaScript.

==Hashes==
It is important to remember that autovivification happens when an undefined value is dereferenced. An assignment is not necessary. The debugger session below illustrates autovivification of a hash just from examining it:

 DB&lt;1&gt; x \%h
0 HASH(0x2f1a248)
 empty hash
 DB&lt;2&gt; x $h{1}{2}{3}{4}
0 undef
 DB&lt;3&gt; x \%h
0 HASH(0x2f1a248)
 1 =&gt; HASH(0x2f1a260)
 2 =&gt; HASH(0x29a3c68)
 3 =&gt; HASH(0x2dc3038)
 empty hash
 DB&lt;4&gt;

The debugger session below illustrates autovivification of a hash from assigning to an inner hash:

 DB&lt;1&gt; $h{A}{B}{C}{D}=1
 DB&lt;2&gt; x \%h
 0 HASH(0x83c71ac)
 &#x27;A&#x27; =&gt; HASH(0x837d50c)
 &#x27;B&#x27; =&gt; HASH(0x83c71e8)
 &#x27;C&#x27; =&gt; HASH(0x83c7218)
 &#x27;D&#x27; =&gt; 1
 DB&lt;3&gt;

Hashes several layers deep were created automatically without any declarations. Autovivification can prevent excessive typing. If Perl did not support autovivification, the structure above would have to be created as follows:

 DB&lt;1&gt; %h = (A =&gt; {B =&gt; {C =&gt; {D =&gt; 1}}})
 DB&lt;2&gt; x \%h
 0 HASH(0x83caba4)
 &#x27;A&#x27; =&gt; HASH(0x83cfc28)
 &#x27;B&#x27; =&gt; HASH(0x83cab74)
 &#x27;C&#x27; =&gt; HASH(0x83b6110)
 &#x27;D&#x27; =&gt; 1
 DB&lt;3&gt;
==File and directory handles==
Perl 5.6.1 and newer support autovivification of file and directory handles. Calling codice_1 on an undefined variable will set it to a filehandle. According to perl561delta, &quot;[t]his largely eliminates the need for typeglobs when opening filehandles that must be passed around, as in the following example:

for my $file ( qw(this.conf that.conf) ) {
 my $fin = open_or_throw(&#x27;&lt;&#x27;, $file);
 process_conf($fin);
 # no close() needed
use Carp;
sub open_or_throw {
 my ($mode, $filename) = @_;
 open my $h, $mode, $filename
 or croak &quot;Could not open &#x27;$filename&#x27;: $!&quot;;
 return $h;


==Emulation in other programming languages==

===C++===
The C++ Standard Library&#x27;s associative containers (codice_2 and codice_3) use codice_4 to get the value associated to a key. If there is nothing associated to this key, it will construct it and value initialize

the value. For simple types like int or float, the value initialization will be zero initialization.
std::unordered_map&lt;std::string, std::vector&lt;int» a;
a[&quot;the answer&quot;].push_back(42); // Autovivifies the a[&quot;the answer&quot;] vector and then appends to it.
Another example of counting occurrences of strings:
std::unordered_map&lt;std::string, int&gt; counts;
while (auto&amp; s = GetNextString()) {
 counts[s]++; // creates counts[s] if it doesn&#x27;t exist and set to zero, then increment.


A similar trick can be achieved with the codice_5 method, which returns an iterator to the element associated to the key, even if it already exists.

===Python===
Python&#x27;s built-in codice_6 class can be subclassed to implement autovivificious dictionaries simply by overriding the codice_7 method that was added to the class in Python v2.5. There are other ways of implementing the behavior, but the following is one of the simplest and instances of the class print just like normal Python dictionary objects.

»&gt; class Tree(dict):
... def __missing__(self, key):
... value = self[key] = type(self)()
... return value

»&gt; # Common names by class, order, genus, and type-species
»&gt; common_names = Tree()
»&gt; common_names[&#x27;Mammalia&#x27;][&#x27;Primates&#x27;][&#x27;Homo&#x27;][&#x27;H. sapiens&#x27;] = &#x27;human being&#x27;
»&gt; common_names
{&#x27;Mammalia&#x27;: {&#x27;Primates&#x27;: {&#x27;Homo&#x27;: {&#x27;H. sapiens&#x27;: &#x27;human being&#x27;}}}}

»&gt; # Famous quotes by play, act, scene, and page
»&gt; quotes = Tree()
»&gt; quotes[&#x27;Hamlet&#x27;][1][3][3] = &#x27;This above all: to thine own self be true.&#x27;
»&gt; quotes
{&#x27;Hamlet&#x27;: {1: {3: {3: &#x27;This above all: to thine own self be true.&#x27;}}}}
===Ruby===

Ruby hashes can take a block specifying an object to be returned for non-existing indexes. These can be used to implement autovivificious maps.
irb(main):001:0&gt; tree = proc { Hash.new { |hash, key| hash[key] = tree.call } }
=&gt; #&lt;Proc:0x007fda528749a0@(irb):1&gt;
irb(main):002:0&gt; lupin = tree.call
irb(main):003:0&gt; lupin[&quot;express&quot;][3] = &quot;stand and deliver&quot;
=&gt; &quot;stand and deliver&quot;
irb(main):004:0&gt; lupin
=&gt; {&quot;express&quot;=&gt;{3=&gt;&quot;stand and deliver&quot;}}
===Java===

Java Map has a method codice_8 that can be used to emulate autovivificous maps.
public static &lt;K,V&gt; Function&lt;K, V&gt; defaultDict(Map&lt;K, V&gt; map, Supplier&lt;? extends V&gt; supplier) {
 return key -&gt; map.computeIfAbsent(key, k -&gt; supplier.get());

public static void main(String[] args) {
 Function&lt;String, List&lt;String» dict = defaultDict(new HashMap&lt;&gt;(), ArrayList::new);
 dict.apply(&quot;foo&quot;).add(&quot;bar&quot;);


===PHP===

PHP arrays are natively autovivificious.

$arr = array();
$arr[&quot;express&quot;][3] = &quot;stand and deliver&quot;;

However, this only applies to assignment, and not array access.

=== JavaScript ===
ES6 introduces a new class that can be used to implement autovivification. With other features of JavaScript, this can be reduced to a single line of code:

var tree = () =&gt; new Proxy({}, { get: (target, name) =&gt; name in target ? target[name] : target[name] = tree() });

// Test:
var t = tree();
t.first.second.third = &#x27;text&#x27;;
console.log(t.first.second.third); // or t[&#x27;first&#x27;][&#x27;second&#x27;][&#x27;third&#x27;]
=== C# ===
C#, using indexers and C# 4.0 dynamics,

class Tree
 private IDictionary&lt;string, object&gt; _dict = new Dictionary&lt;string, object&gt;();

 public dynamic this[string key]
 get { return _dict.ContainsKey(key) ? _dict[key] : _dict[key] = new Tree(); }
 set { _dict[key] = value; }
}

// Test:
var t = new Tree();
t[&quot;first&quot;][&quot;second&quot;][&quot;third&quot;] = &quot;text&quot;;
Console.WriteLine(t[&quot;first&quot;][&quot;second&quot;][&quot;third&quot;]);
 can be used for implementing different syntaxes also,

using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Dynamic;

class Tree : DynamicObject
 private IDictionary&lt;object, object&gt; dict = new Dictionary&lt;object, object&gt;();

 // for t.first.second.third syntax
 public override bool TryGetMember(GetMemberBinder binder, out object result)
 var key = binder.Name;

 if (dict.ContainsKey(key))
 result = dict[key];
 else
 dict[key] = result = new Tree();

 return true;
 
 public override bool TrySetMember(SetMemberBinder binder, object value)
 dict[binder.Name] = value;
 return true;

 // for t[&quot;first&quot;][&quot;second&quot;][&quot;third&quot;] syntax
 public override bool TryGetIndex(GetIndexBinder binder, object[] indexes, out object result)
 var key = indexes[0];

 if (dict.ContainsKey(key))
 result = dict[key];
 else
 dict[key] = result = new Tree();

 return true;

 public override bool TrySetIndex(SetIndexBinder binder, object[] indexes, object value)
 dict[indexes[0]] = value;
 return true;
}

// Test:
dynamic t = new Tree();
t.first.second.third = &quot;text&quot;;
Console.WriteLine(t.first.second.third);

// or,
dynamic t = new Tree();
t[&quot;first&quot;][&quot;second&quot;][&quot;third&quot;] = &quot;text&quot;;
Console.WriteLine(t[&quot;first&quot;][&quot;second&quot;][&quot;third&quot;]);

<text>An internal link is a type of hyperlink on a web page to another page or resource, such as an image or document, on the same website or domain. It is the opposite of an external link, a link that directs a user to content that is outside its domain.

Hyperlinks are considered either &quot;external&quot; or &quot;internal&quot; depending on their target or destination. Generally, a link to a page outside the same domain or website is considered external, whereas one that points at another section of the same web page or to another page of the same website or domain is considered internal. Both internal and external links allow users of the website to navigate to another web page or resource. These definitions become clouded, however, when the same organization operates multiple domains functioning as a single web experience, e.g. when a secure commerce website is used for purchasing things displayed on a non-secure website. In these cases, links that are &quot;external&quot; by the above definition can conceivably be classified as &quot;internal&quot; for some purposes. Ultimately, an internal link points to a web page or resource in the same root directory.

Similarly, seemingly &quot;internal&quot; links are in fact &quot;external&quot; for many purposes, for example in the case of linking among subdomains of a main domain, which are not operated by the same person(s). For example, a blogging platform, such as WordPress, Blogger or Tumblr host thousands of different blogs on subdomains, which are entirely unrelated and the authors of which are generally unknown to each other. In these contexts one might view a link as &quot;internal&quot; only if it linked within the same blog, not to other blogs within the same domain.

The existence of internal links are used in websites in order to navigate to multiple pages under a domain, making them a requirement if a website were to have more than one page (unless that page is meant to be inaccessible to the average visitor). Internal Links are also commonly used by web crawlers (e.g. for indexing a website for a search engine).

<text>Trees for Life is an international nonprofit movement, based in Wichita, Kansas, USA, that works for the empowerment of villagers in developing countries. 

== History ==
This movement started by enabling people around the world to help plant fruit trees in developing countries. Now it has matured to where Trees for Life provides a platform for people of various disciplines to work on long-term fundamental solutions to problems in the areas of &quot;education&quot;, &quot;health&quot; and &quot;environment.&quot;

Trees for Life was founded in 1984 by Balbir Mathur, an India-born American businessman. While working as an international business consultant, Mathur had several life-changing experiences, and went through an illness that left him unable to walk for two years. After his illness he started helping people in India plant fruit trees. He left his former business interests and started doing this work full-time. When others wanted to help on a full-time basis, Mathur realized that the vision was larger than himself.

Trees for Life has had projects in India, Guatemala, Haiti, Brazil, Nepal, Costa Rica, Indonesia, Nicaragua and Cambodia. According to the organization, more than two million people have participated in its programs and tens of millions of fruit trees have been planted.

In the mid-1990s, Trees for Life learned that the highly nutritious leaves of the Moringa oleifera tree were a simple yet overlooked resource for combating malnutrition for the poor. So they designed and implemented programs to share this message with people in developing countries. Today, governments in Asia, Africa and Latin America plant Moringa trees as a national policy—including more than 20 million trees in Africa alone.

Trees for Life has also initiated a program called &quot;Books for Life.&quot; This project aims to instill a love of reading and interest in learning in areas of the world where people have limited or no access to books and education. In partnership with local communities, who provide partial funding, library staff and management, libraries have been established or enhanced in Nicaragua, India and Pakistan. Each year during 2006-2010 a &quot;Kansas Youth Book Drive&quot; was held. People across the state of Kansas have donated more than 138,000 gently used children&#x27;s books for Pakistan, Liberia, several other African countries, and under-served populations in the USA.

<text>Saturnino Herrán Guinchard (9 July 1887 – 8 October 1918) was a Mexican painter influential to Latin culture in the late 19th and early 20th century.

== Biography ==
Saturnino Herrán was raised in Aguascalientes, a city in North-Central Mexico ingrained with Spanish culture. His father owned &quot;the only bookstore in the city&quot; and was a professor of bookkeeping at The Academy of Science&quot;. At the age of ten, he was exceptional in drawing, painting, and draftsmanship. In 1903, when he was sixteen, his father died. Two years later, the family moved to Mexico City where he studied painting further and began to teach.

At 25 years old, he met Rosario Arellano, his future wife, who occasionally acted as a figure model for pieces like &quot;Mujer en Tehuantepec&quot; (1914). At the height of his career in 1914, they were married. There is little that is known about their marriage other than it appeared to be &quot;congruent&quot; and &quot;enlightened&quot;. Together they had one son, José Francisco.

Herrán completed majestic paintings of Mexican Indigenous people, giving them heroic strength, beauty, and dignity. In 1910, he participated in the exhibition commemorating the Centennial Anniversary of Mexico&#x27;s Independence. A desire to be a mural painter appeared during his career, and in 1911 he completed commissioned large-scale, mural-like paintings.

Herrán died suddenly in Mexico City on 8 October 1918, at the age of 31, &quot;from a gastric complication&quot;.

== Early career ==

In 1901 Herrán began taking drawing lessons at the Aguascalientes Academy of Science where his father worked. José Inés Tovilla and Severo Amador helped teach him both drawing and painting. In 1903, his father died. He and his mother moved to Mexico City, where he worked at a telegraph office to support her and took classes from Julio Ruelas at the Academy of San Carlos. He then studied draughtsmanship under Antonio Fabres, a Catalan painter and color under Mexican colorist Germán Gedovius. His work was highly inspired by European theories of modern art including Greek and Roman aesthetics and a high degree of naturalism. He was an &quot;outstanding student&quot; receiving &quot;honorable mentions&quot; in multiple courses. Herrán immersed himself in Mexican art, mixing that with his training in academic European technique, for he saw art as a spiritual experience.

His first paintings displayed figures as allegories of nature and included Spanish mythology and scenes of everyday people at work who were either exhausted or optimistic. By 1908 he gained success and recognition within the artistic community and began winning awards on top of scholarships. In 1909 he became a professor drawing at the National Institute of Fine Arts, where his pupils were Diego Rivera and Roberto Montenegro. In 1910, he turned down a scholarship to study in Europe and took a job as a draftsman in the Department for the Inspection of Archeological Monuments.

1910 launched Herrán into greater success when he participated in the Centennial Anniversary of Mexico&#x27;s Independence. With fellow artist Jose Orozco, he formed the Society of Mexican Painters and Sculptors and staged a counter-exhibition to the Centennial Anniversary that included art that was purely Mexican. It included his triptych &quot;The Legend of the Volcanoes.&quot; Herrán&#x27;s pieces were associated with the work of Velázquez and José de Rivera, with his own influence from Catalan modernism. The exhibition was so popular that the entrance had to be controlled by police. This exhibition made an impression on José Vasconcelos, the future Secretary of Education of Mexico after it was revolutionized. After seeing the exhibition, he commissioned Herrán to do a large-scale mural in the School of Arts and Crafts in 1911.

== Mexican modernism ==
On top of being a professor, Herrán was an activist for modern art, a muralist, book illustrator, draughtsman, and stained glass colorist. While his work had influence from Mexico, Spain, and Catalan it did not fully break away from the traditional European style he was trained to paint in. Herrán, being of mixed descent himself, recognized the multitude of races Mexico embodied, and painted people in natural habitats, capturing their strength, dignity, and inherent beauty. This realization was a part of a movement called &#x27;indigenismo&#x27;-a movement that called for social elevation, for a developed personal identity that is inextricably linked to a plethora of Latin races. His generation marked him as one of the painters that &quot;embodied the nations soul&quot;.

&quot;The Offering&quot; (1913) exemplifies Mexican modernism with its allegorical allusion to life&#x27;s journey. It displays a punt boat in a canal filled with zempasúchitl flowers, a marigold that is traditionally associated with death. Featured are a baby, a youthful man, and an elderly man offering the flowers for the dead. This is a reference to ofrenda, a tradition deeply connected to Mexico&#x27;s Dia de los Muertos, a celebration of ancestry that is said to connect the living to the dead. Each character represents a different stage of life, but they are all following the same end destination and respecting their course. When Herran died, his widowed wife requested &quot;The Offering&quot; yet it was taken to the National Fine Arts Institute. Herrán&#x27;s works gave credence to the &quot;spiritual beauty of the native people of Mexico in exquisite drawings of Indians whose languid silhouettes stand out against freely interpreted backgrounds of Pre-Columbian sculpture.&quot; See: &quot;The Shawl&quot; (1916) and &quot;Criolla with Mantilla&quot; (1917–1918).

== Later career: muralist ==
By this time in his career, Saturnino finally became a muralist. &quot;Mural art would be, by definition, revolutionary and Marxist, nationalist and indigenous. In this art, in rather Manichean fashion, the forces of good (those mentioned) confront the forces of evil, represented by Spain, Catholicism, and the Conquistadores and, in modern times, capitalism&quot; These ideologies were painted by fellow artists Orozco and Rivera, making them illustrious in the art world. As mentioned above, he went on to create commissioned murals for the School of Arts and Crafts. His works were used as model for future muralists throughout the 1920s and 1930s.

In Herrán&#x27;s famous triptych &quot;Our Gods&quot; (1914-1918), he displayed legendary Aztec goddess Coatlicue, who, according to legend, gave birth to the sun, moon, stars. It was commissioned for the Palace of Fine Arts in Mexico City. The mural is sixteen feet tall with multiple panels. Latin and Caucasian races are showcased on both sides, yet it draws the eyes of the viewer in to engage with the center panel, &quot;Coatlicue Transformed&quot;. Jesus Christ, God of the early Christians is in the center of the goddess. Hands, hearts, skulls and crosses are displayed along with lilies, which are representative of Christian spirituality. The piece is a fusion of both cultures as all races on both sides are turned worshiping one god-like figure with one Aztec and one European reference to a higher power. Christ and Coatlicue coalesce in &quot;a vivid expression of his theme concerning the mixture of the two races&quot; &quot;Our Gods&quot; is arguably Herrán&#x27;s greatest, most infamous work due to its deep calling to the viewer to accept others, think spiritually, and unify two cultures. It was never fully completed as he worked on it until the day he died. Due to his clear skill with draughtsmanship, some of Herrán&#x27;s contemporaries criticized his style, calling his paintings &quot;painted drawings&quot; or &quot;effeminate&quot;, yet others believe his &quot;superb draftsmanship of the human figure [provided] the strength of his best work&quot;.

== Legacy ==

Saturnino paved the way for artists like Orozco and Rivera by creating masterpieces with deep, relatable meaning. Stylistically, he painted his strengths and used well-cultured techniques from years of learning with Spanish, European, and Catalan influence. Herran used free brushwork over his drawings to capture vibrations of light . He blurred certain background colors together to create ambiance. He preferred strong contours, dynamic imagery, and color balanced. &quot;The refinement of Herran&#x27;s draughtsmanship and use of colour balances the naturalistic imagery in these works combining drawing with watercolour, a technique adapted from Spanish painters such as Néstor de la Torre&quot;. Along with integrating well- developed techniques, his work displays a deep knowledge of the human psyche. His art links eminence and dignity to Mexican heritage. It has brought deep meaning to teaching the value of cultural acceptance and gives insight into the brevity of human life for every viewer to relate to.

<doc id="1176893" wikidata="Q5434295" url="?curid=1176893" title="Fantasy Football League (TV series)">
<text>Fantasy Football League is a British television comedy programme originally hosted by David Baddiel and Frank Skinner. It was inspired by the Fantasy Football phenomenon which started in the early 1990s and followed on from a BBC Radio 5 programme hosted by Dominik Diamond, although the radio and TV versions overlapped by several months. Three series were broadcast from 14 January 1994 to 10 May 1996 (followed by episodes during Euro 96). The show then moved to ITV for live specials on alternate nights throughout the 1998 World Cup and then again through Euro 2004.

After the show ended, Baddiel and Skinner went on to produce a series of podcasts for &quot;The Times&quot;, documenting their experiences while travelling across Germany at the 2006 World Cup. The success of these led to the duo being signed by Absolute Radio, where they hosted a similar show from South Africa during the 2010 World Cup.

In 2022, a revival of the show was commissioned to be broadcast on Sky Max with new hosts Elis James and Matt Lucas. This ended in 2024, after 24 episodes over two series.

==Format==
The format was originally heavily reliant on an actual fantasy football league, made up of teams picked by regular guest celebrities at the point that the game became popular in the mid-1990s.

In the &#x27;kitchen&#x27; area stood the third regular on the show, Angus Loughran, referred to only as &quot;Statto&quot;. Clad only in a dressing gown and pyjamas, he would dispense footballing facts and statistics on demand, particularly in the early shows when the fantasy league element was strongest. He was the butt of many of Frank and David&#x27;s jokes, and was often made fun of for being apparently dull and naive, but quickly became an audience favourite (with chants of &quot;Statto! Statto!&quot; becoming common later in the run). In the Sky era, comedian and BT Sport presenter Andrew Mensah takes Loughran&#x27;s former role.

The Sky series featured celebrity guests including Keir Starmer, Michael Sheen, Brian Cox, Trevor McDonald, Maisie Adam and Jennifer Saunders.

==Controversy==
Skinner and Baddiel performed a sketch with toys, using a Mr. Potato Head to portray Nottingham Forest manager Frank Clark and a toy footballer with a (genuine) pineapple on top to portray Forest striker Jason Lee and his unusual hairstyle. This led to Lee suffering torrents of abuse from fans at actual matches, including chants like &quot;He&#x27;s got a pineapple, on his head, he&#x27;s got a big pineapple, on his head!&quot; (to the tune of &quot;He&#x27;s Got the Whole World in His Hands&quot; by Laurie London). Some sketches also featured Baddiel in blackface.

In response to the racism, Lee said: &quot;I&#x27;d ask them if they realised the significance of what they were doing. It was, looking back, a form of bullying. I work in equalities now, and it can affect different people in different ways. I don&#x27;t think people appreciate the possible harm it can cause. Not everyone has the make-up to deal with that, and they shouldn&#x27;t have to.&quot; Baddiel has since admitted that his portrayal of Lee was &quot;part of a very bad racist tradition&quot;. In an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot; in July 2022, Skinner said &quot;When Dave walked out from makeup that night, I still don’t know why one or both of us or someone there didn’t say what the fuck is happening?&quot; He also added, &quot;Looking back, it was a bullying campaign. And it&#x27;s awful. And yeah, I&#x27;m ashamed of it.&quot; Baddiel finally apologised to Lee to his face later that year, though Lee questioned why it had taken Baddiel so long to do so.

In 2022, Sky apologised for a sketch in which Elis James portrayed Nottingham Forest manager Steve Cooper with a wonky eye, apparently mocking his appearance.

<text>John Joe O&#x27;Reilly (1918 – 1952) was a legendary Gaelic footballer who played for the Cavan county team. He is the only man to lead a team to All-Ireland glory outside of Ireland, having captained the Cavan team to victory against Kerry in the iconic 1947 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final played at the Polo Grounds in New York City.

==Playing career==
Born at the Derries Upper, Killeshandra, County Cavan, his father was Big John O&#x27;Reilly who played as the goalkeeper on the Cavan county team and his mother was Sarah Anne. After early successes with St Patrick&#x27;s College, Cavan and his club, Cornafean, he captained the Cavan county team, which won All-Ireland Senior Football Championships in 1947 (at the New York City Polo Grounds) and 1948, having also played on three losing sides in the final. He won 11 Ulster senior football medals, as Cavan took the title each year from 1937 until 1949, except two. He won a National Football League medal and four Railway Cup medals, in 1942 and 1943 (when he was the first ever Cavan captain), 1947 and as captain again in 1950. John Joe O&#x27;Reilly was one of only eight men to have had the honour of being presented with the Sam Maguire twice as captain.

O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s father also played in goal for Cavan and his brother, Tom O’Reilly, played on the 1947 All-Ireland winning team and also won Railway Cup medals for Ulster in 1943 and 1944.

==Death and legacy==
A Commandant in the Irish Army, John Joe O&#x27;Reilly, suffered a serious injury during a football match against Ardclough in 1952 from which he never recovered. He died in the General Military Hospital in the Curragh on 22 November 1952 at only 34 years of age. In 1984, the GAA&#x27;s centenary year he was named at centre half-back on the Football Team of the Century. In 1999 he was again honoured by the GAA by being named on their Gaelic Football Team of the Millennium. The song &quot;The Gallant John Joe&quot; was written by Peter Albert McGovern, Swanlinbar County Cavan Ireland, as a tribute to John Joe O&#x27;Reilly.

== Statue ==
On 20 November 2022, two days before the 70th anniversary of his death, a 7-foot bronze statue of John Joe, sculpted by Seamus Connolly, was unveiled at Market Square in Cavan. The unveiling celebrations included speeches by GAA President Larry McCarthy, iconic Kerry GAA midfielder Mick O&#x27;Connell and was attended by a huge array of GAA legends, including Brian McEniff and Jimmy Deenihan, as well as representation from the Defence Forces. It is the first GAA monument in the province of Ulster.

<text>Osseointegration (from Latin &quot;bony&quot; and &quot;to make whole&quot;) is the direct structural and functional connection between living bone and the surface of a load-bearing artificial implant (&quot;load-bearing&quot; as defined by Albrektsson et al. in 1981). A more recent definition (by Schroeder et al.) defines osseointegration as &quot;functional ankylosis (bone adherence)&quot;, where new bone is laid down directly on the implant surface and the implant exhibits mechanical stability (i.e., resistance to destabilization by mechanical agitation or shear forces). Osseointegration has enhanced the science of medical bone and joint replacement techniques as well as dental implants and improving prosthetics for amputees.

== Definitions ==
Osseointegration is also defined as: &quot;the formation of a direct interface between an implant and bone, without intervening soft tissue&quot;.

An osseointegrated implant is a type of implant defined as &quot;an endosteal implant containing pores into which osteoblasts and supporting connective tissue can migrate&quot;. Applied to oral implantology, this refers to bone grown right up to the implant surface without interposed soft tissue layer. No scar tissue, cartilage or ligament fibers are present between the bone and implant surface. The direct contact of bone and implant surface can be verified microscopically.

Osseointegration may also be defined as:
# Osseous integration, the apparent direct attachment or connection of osseous tissue to an inert alloplastic material without intervening connective tissue.
# The process and resultant apparent direct connection of the endogenous material surface and the host bone tissues without intervening connective tissue.
# The interface between alloplastic material and bone.

== History ==

Osseointegration was first observed—albeit not explicitly stated—by Bothe, Beaton, and Davenport in 1940. Bothe et al. were the first researchers to implant titanium in an animal and remarked how it tended to fuse with bone. Bothe et al. reported that due to the elemental nature of the titanium, its strength, and its hardness, it had great potential to be used as future prosthesis material. Gottlieb Leventhal later described osseointegration in 1951. Leventhal placed titanium screws in rat femurs and said, &quot;At the end of 6 weeks, the screws were slightly tighter than when originally put in; at 12 weeks, the screws were more difficult to remove; and at the end of 16 weeks, the screws were so tight that in one specimen the femur was fractured when an attempt was made to remove the screw. Microscopic examinations of the bone structure revealed no reaction to the implants, the trabeculation appeared to be perfectly normal.&quot; The reactions described by Leventhal and Bothe et al. would later be coined into the term &quot;osseointegration&quot; by Per-Ingvar Brånemark of Sweden. In 1952, Brånemark did an experiment where he used a titanium implant chamber to study blood flow in rabbit bone. At the end of the experiment, when it became time to remove the titanium chambers from the bone, he discovered that the bone had integrated so completely with the implant that the chamber could not be removed. Brånemark called this &quot;osseointegration&quot;, and, like Bothe et al. and Leventhal before him, saw the possibilities for human use.

In dentistry the implementation of osseointegration started in the mid-1960s as a result of Brånemark&#x27;s work. In 1965 Brånemark, who was at the time Professor of Anatomy at University of Gothenburg, placed dental implants into the first human patient—Gösta Larsson. This patient had a cleft palate defect and needed implants to support a palatal obturator. Gösta Larsson died in 2005, with the original implants still in place after 40 years of function.

In the mid-1970s Brånemark entered into a commercial partnership with the Swedish defense company Bofors to manufacture dental implants and the instrumentation required for their placement. Eventually an offshoot of Bofors, Nobel Pharma, was created to concentrate on this product line. Nobel Pharma subsequently became Nobel Biocare.

Brånemark spent almost 30 years fighting the scientific community for acceptance of osseointegration as a viable treatment. In Sweden he was often openly ridiculed at science conferences. His university stopped funding for his research, forcing him to open a private clinic to continue treating patients. Eventually an emerging breed of young academics started to notice the work being done in Sweden. Toronto&#x27;s George Zarb, a Maltese-born Canadian prosthodontist, was instrumental in bringing the concept of osseointegration to the wider world. The 1983 Toronto Conference is generally considered to be the turning point, when finally the worldwide scientific community accepted Brånemark&#x27;s work. Osseointegration is now a highly predictable and common treatment modality. Since 2010, Professor Munjed Al Muderis in Sydney, Australia, used a high tensile strength titanium implant with plasma sprayed surface as an intramedullary prosthesis that is inserted into the bone residuum of amputees and then connect through an opening in the skin to a robotic limb prosthesis. This lets amputees mobilize with more comfort and less energy consumption. Al Muderis also published the first series of combining osseointegration prosthesis with Joint replacement enabling below knee amputees with knee arthritis or short residual bone to walk without needing a socket prosthesis.

On December 7, 2015, two Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom veterans, Bryant Jacobs and Ed Salau, became the first in America to get a percutaneous osseointegrated prosthesis. In the first stage, doctors at Salt Lake Veterans Affairs Hospital embedded a titanium stud in the femur of each patient. About six weeks later, they went back and attached the docking mechanism for the prosthesis.

==Mechanism==

Osseointegration is a dynamic process in which characteristics of the implant (i.e. macrogeometry, surface properties, etc.) play a role in modulating molecular and cellular behavior. While osseointegration has been observed using different materials, it is most often used to describe the reaction of bone tissues to titanium, or titanium coated with calcium phosphate derivatives. It was previously thought that titanium implants were retained in bone through the action of mechanical stabilization or interfacial bonding. Alternatively, calcium phosphate coated implants were thought to be stabilized via chemical bonding. It is now known that both calcium phosphate coated implants and titanium implants are stabilized chemically with bone, either through direct contact between calcium and titanium atoms, or by the bonding to a cement line-like layer at the implant/bone interface. While there are some differences (e.g. like the lack of chondrogenic progenitors), osseointegration occurs through the same mechanisms as bone fracture healing.

==Technique==
For osseointegrated dental implants, metallic, ceramic, and polymeric materials have been used, in particular titanium. To be termed osseointegration the connection between the bone and the implant need not be 100%, and the essence of osseointegration derives more from the stability of the fixation than the degree of contact in histologic terms. In short it is a process where clinically asymptomatic rigid fixation of alloplastic materials is achieved, and maintained, in bone during functional loading. Implant healing time and initial stability are a function of implant characteristics. For example, implants using a screw-root form design achieve high initial mechanical stability through the action of their screws against bone. Following placement of the implant, healing typically takes several weeks or months before the implant is fully integrated into the bone. First evidence of integration occurs after a few weeks, while more robust connection is progressively effected over the next months or years. Implants that have a screw-root form design result in bone resorption followed by interfacial bone remodeling and growth around the implant.

Implants using a plateau-root form design (or screw-root form implants with a wide enough gap between the pitch of the screws) undergo a different mode of peri-implant ossification. Unlike the aforementioned screw-root form implants, plateau-root form implants exhibit de novo bone formation on the implant surface. The type of bone healing exhibited by plateau-root form implants is known as intramembranous-like healing.

Though the osseointegrated interface becomes resistant to external shocks over time, it may be damaged by prolonged adverse stimuli and overload, which may cause implant failure. In studies done using &quot;Mini dental implants,&quot; it was noted that the absence of micromotion at the bone-implant interface was needed to enable proper osseointegration. It was also noted that there is a critical threshold of micromotion above which a fibrous encapsulation process occurs, rather than osseointegration.

Other complications may arise even in the absence of external impact. One issue is growth of cement. In normal cases, absence of cementum on the implant surface prevents attachment of collagen fibers. This is normally the case due to the absence of cementum progenitor cells in the area receiving the implant. However, when such cells are present, cement may form on or around the implant surface, and a functional collagen attachment may attach to it.

===Advances in materials engineering: metal foams===
Since 2005, a number of orthopedic device makers have introduced products with porous metal construction. Clinical studies on mammals have shown that porous metals, such as titanium foam, may allow formation of vascular systems within the porous area. For orthopedic uses, metals such as tantalum or titanium are often used, as these metals have high tensile strength and corrosion resistance with excellent biocompatibility.

The process of osseointegration in metal foams is similar to that in bone grafts. The porous bone-like properties of the metal foam contribute to extensive bone infiltration, allowing osteoblast activity to take place. In addition, the porous structure allows for soft tissue adherence and vascularization within the implant. These materials are currently deployed in hip replacement, knee replacement and dental implant surgeries.

== Testing procedures ==
There are a number of methods used to gauge the level of osseointegration and the subsequent stability of an implant. One widely used diagnostic procedure is percussion analysis, where a dental instrument is tapped against the implant carrier. The nature of the ringing that results is used as a qualitative measure of the implant&#x27;s stability. An integrated implant will elicit a higher pitched &quot;crystal&quot; sound, whereas a non-integrated implant will elicit a dull, low-pitched sound.

Another method is a reverse torque test, in which the implant carrier is unscrewed. If it fails to unscrew under the reverse torque pressure, the implant is stable. If the implant rotates under the pressure it is deemed a failure and removed. This method comes at the risk of fracturing bone that is mid-way in the process of osseointegration. It is also unreliable in determining the osseointegration potential of a bone region, as tests have yielded that a rotating implant can go on to be successfully integrated.

A non-invasive and increasingly implemented diagnostic method is resonance frequency analysis (RFA). A resonance frequency analyzer device prompts vibrations in a small metal rod temporarily attached to the implant. As the rod vibrates, the probe reads its resonance frequency and translates it into an implant stability quotient (ISQ), which ranges from 1–100, with 100 indicating the highest stability state. Values ranging between 57 and 82 are generally considered stable, though each case must be considered independently.

==Osseoperception==
One of the peculiarities of osseointegrated prostheses is that mechanical events at the prosthesis (e.g. touch) are transferred as vibrations through the bone.
This &quot;osseoperception&quot; means that the prosthesis user regains a more accurate sense of how the prosthesis is interacting with the world. Users of bone-anchored lower limb prostheses report, for example, that they can tell which type of soil they are walking on due to osseoperception.

Recent research on users of bone-anchored upper and lower limb prostheses showed that this osseoperception is not only mediated by mechanoreceptors but also by auditory receptors. This means that, rather than just feeling mechanical influences on the device, users also hear the movements of their prosthesis. This joint mechanical and auditory sensory perception is likely responsible for the improved environment perception of users of osseointegrated prostheses compared to traditional socket suspended devices. It is not clear, however, to what extent this implicit sensory feedback actually influences prosthesis users in everyday life.

== Applications ==
* Prosthetic implants (e.g. Arthroplasty, dental implants) are fields of application
* Retention of a craniofacial prosthesis such as an artificial ear (ear prosthesis), maxillofacial reconstruction, eye (orbital prosthesis), or nose (nose prosthesis)
* Bone anchored limb prostheses
* Bone anchored hearing conduction amplification (bone-anchored hearing aid)
* Eyeborg perceive color through sound waves (sound conduction through bone)
* Knee and hip replacement

<text>Richard Warren Sears (December 7, 1863 – September 28, 1914) was an American businessman who co-founded the department store Sears, Roebuck and Company with his partner Alvah Curtis Roebuck.

==Early life==

Sears was born in Stewartville, Minnesota. His father was James Warren Sears, born circa 1828 in New York, a blacksmith and wagon-maker; his mother was Eliza Burton, born in Ohio circa 1843. The family was living in Spring Valley, Minnesota, by June 1870, where his father served as a city councilman and eventually sold his wagon shop in 1875. Both of his parents were of English descent. During his boyhood in Spring Valley, he befriended Almanzo Wilder, the future husband of Laura Ingalls Wilder. In 1880, he started working as a telegraph operator in the town of North Branch, Minnesota, for the Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway, and was later transferred to North Redwood Falls, Minnesota, to be station agent there.

==Businessman==
In 1886, when Sears was 23, his station received a shipment of gold watches from a Chicago manufacturer, but the local consignee, jeweller Edward Stegerson, refused the unsolicited shipment.

A common scam existing at the time involved wholesalers who would ship their products to retailers who had not ordered them. Upon refusal, the wholesaler would offer the already price-hiked items to the retailer at a lower consignment cost in the guise of alleviating the cost to ship the items back. The unsuspecting retailer would then agree to take this new-found bargain off the wholesaler&#x27;s hands, mark up the items and sell them to the public, making a small profit in the transaction.But Stegerson, a retailer savvy to the scam, flatly refused the watches. Young Sears jumped at the opportunity, and made an agreement with the wholesaler to keep any profit he reaped above $12, and then he set about offering his wares to other station agents along the railroad line for $14. The watches were considered an item of urban sophistication. Also because of the growth of railways, and the recent application of time zones, farmers and railroads needed to keep time accurately which had not been necessary until then. For those two reasons the station agents had no trouble selling the watches to passers-by.

Within six months, Sears had netted $5,000 and felt so confident in this venture that he moved to Minneapolis and founded the R. W. Sears Watch Company. He began placing advertisements in farm publications and mailing flyers to potential clients. From the beginning, it was clear that Sears had a talent for writing promotional copy. He took the personal approach in his ads, speaking directly to rural and small-town communities, persuading them to purchase by mail-order.

==Chicago==
In 1887, Sears moved his company to Chicago, an important transportation center for the Midwestern United States, and moved his residence to nearby Oak Park, Illinois. In 1887 he also hired watch repairman Alvah Curtis Roebuck to repair any watches being returned. Roebuck was Sears&#x27;s first employee, and he later became co-founder of Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company, which was formed in 1891 when Sears was 28 years old. In 1895 the company was short of cash and Roebuck had left the business. Sears sold one half of the company for $75,000.00 to Aaron Nusbaum and his brother-in-law, Julius Rosenwald. The company was incorporated in Illinois as Sears Roebuck &amp; Co. of Illinois on September 7, 1895. Richard Sears retired in 1908 at age 44 and Julius Rosenwald became the President.

The first Sears catalog was published in 1893 and offered only watches. By 1897, items such as men&#x27;s and ladies clothing, plows, silverware, bicycles and athletic equipment had been added to the offering.

The 500-page catalog was sent to some 300,000 homes. Sears catered to the rural customer because, having been raised on a farm, he knew what the rural customer needed. He also had experience working with the railroad and he knew how to ship merchandise to remote areas.

In 1908 Sears made another move forward and began to sell mail order homes through the catalogs.

==Death==
In 1908 Sears retired and moved from Oak Park to Lake Bluff, Illinois, suffering from failing health due to alcoholism. Six years later, he died in Waukesha, Wisconsin, of Bright&#x27;s disease.

==Legacy==
Sears&#x27;s birthplace in Stewartville is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Sears was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1892.

<doc id="1176907" wikidata="Q2920094" url="?curid=1176907" title="Aderet, Israel">
<text>Aderet () is a moshav in central Israel. Located in the Judean foothills in the Adullam region, south of Beit Shemesh, west of Gush Etzion and overlooking the Valley of Elah, it falls under the jurisdiction of Mateh Yehuda Regional Council. In it had a population of .

==History==
The moshav was founded in the early 1959 by Jewish immigrants from Romania. All of the initial settlers, however, left the site. In 1963, the government re-established the town and brought in Jewish immigrants from the Atlas Mountains in Morocco. Its name was taken from Book of Ezekiel 17:8, meaning &quot;mighty&quot; in the phrase &quot;mighty vine&quot;, a symbol of reborn Israel. The name recalls the viticulture in the area.

The residents were involved in poultry farming and other agricultural activities until the late 1980s, when the village evolved into a dormitory community for Jerusalem (40 km) and Tel Aviv (65 km). In 1997 a new neighborhood was built, bringing the population to over 110 families. An additional building project started in late 2006 for seventy plots.

==Education==
There are two kindergartens located on the moshav. School-age children are bused outside the community mostly to either Alon Shvut or Rosh Tzurim. A pre-military mechina, open to both religious and non-religious students, was founded after the year 2000. There are four synagogues in Aderet, and the chief rabbi is Moshe Dadon.

==Tourism==
In the vicinity of Aderet are a vineyard and number of archeological sites from the Roman and Byzantine Eras, including the Atari and Midras ruins from the period of the Bar Kokhba revolt. The cave of Adullam, famous as a refuge for David during his period of flight from King Saul, is 1 km south of Aderet, and the ancient site of Sokho, now famous for its annual flowering of lupines, is 2 km north.

<doc id="1176908" wikidata="Q60790078" url="?curid=1176908" title="Aegium">
<text>Aegium or Aigion (), or Aegeium or Aigeion (Αἴγειον), was a town and polis (city-state) of ancient Achaea, and one of the twelve Achaean cities. It was situated upon the coast west of the river Selinus, 30 stadia from Rhypae, and 40 stadia from Helice.

The city stood between two promontories in the corner of a bay, which formed the best harbour in Achaea next to that of Patrae. It is said to have been formed out of a union of seven or eight villages. It was already mentioned in the Homeric Catalogue of Ships in the &quot;Iliad&quot;. When the neighbouring city of Helice sank into the sea following an earthquake in 373 BCE, Aegium annexed its territory and became the chief city of the Achaean League. When the League dissolved later in the same century, however, Aegium came for some time under Macedonian rule.

Eventually, the Achaean League was refounded by the cities of Dyme and Patras in 280 BC, and the citizens of Aegium, taking courage to expel the Macedonian garrison, joined in 275 BC. From this time on Aegium served as the capital of the Achaean League. It was the meeting place for the assembly of the Achaeans and retained this distinction until Philopoemen carried a law that the meeting might be held in any of the towns of the confederacy. Even under the Roman Empire the Achaeans were allowed to keep up the form of their periodical meetings at Aegium, just as the Amphictyons were permitted to meet at Thermopylae and Delphi.

The meetings were held in a grove near the sea, called Homagyrium or Homarium, sacred to Zeus Homagyrius or Homarius (Ὁμαγύριον, Ὁμάριον); a temple was also there called Homarium. Close to this grove was a temple of Demeter Panchaea. The words Homagyrium, &#x27;assembly&#x27;, and Homarium, &#x27;union&#x27;, refer to those meetings, though in later times they were explained as indicating the spot where Agamemnon assembled the Grecian chieftains before the Trojan War. There were several other temples and public buildings at Aegium, of which an account is given by Pausanias.

Aegium had several Olympic winners including Xenophon, Ladas (stadion race), Athenodorus (Αθηνόδωρος) (stadion race), Straton (Στράτων) (pancration and wrestling).

Its site is located near the modern city of Aigio.

<doc id="1176911" wikidata="Q16961297" url="?curid=1176911" title="Chemnitzer concertina">
<text>A Chemnitzer concertina is a musical instrument of the hand-held bellows-driven free-reed category, sometimes called &quot;squeezeboxes&quot;. The Chemnitzer concertina is most closely related to the bandoneón (German spelling: &quot;Bandonion&quot;), and more distantly, to the other types of concertinas and accordions. It&#x27;s essentially a bigger version of the Anglo Concertina that sounds more akin to an Accordion due to having Multiple Ranks of Reeds.

== Physical description ==
It is roughly square in cross-section, with the keyboards consisting of cylindrical buttons on each end arranged in curving rows. Like other concertinas, the buttons are at the sides of the instrument, whereas the keys and buttons of an accordion are at the front. A strap, usually of leather, is fitted at each end to hold the player&#x27;s palm against the instrument for playing. Compare to the English concertina where the thumb holds a strap, the little finger is held on a rest, and the remaining three fingers press the keys. The instrument is bisonoric, meaning that each button corresponds to two notes: one when the bellows is compressed, and another when it is expanded. On most instruments, two or more (and as many as five) reeds sound for each note. The tones produced are either in octaves, unison, or in some combination thereof.

Internal construction is different from other concertinas in that the action more closely resembles that of an accordion, and that the reeds are of steel (rather than brass) and are often fixed in groups of twenty or more to long zinc or aluminum plates, rather than to individual frames. This arrangement resembles that of the Russian accordion, the bayan.

== History ==
Sources differ whether German inventor Carl Friedrich Uhlig created his first concertina after seeing Charles Wheatstone&#x27;s instrument of the same name, or whether the two men invented their instruments concurrently and independently. Uhlig&#x27;s patent dates to 1834, and while Wheatstone patented a related instrument, the symphonium in 1829, he did not patent an instrument under the name &quot;Concertina&quot; until 1844.

== Types ==

Uhlig&#x27;s first instrument had five buttons on each side, but the keyboard was quickly expanded and as it did so, it diverged into different lineages. Heinrich Band&#x27;s was sold under the name &quot;Bandonion&quot;. Several other German instruments were sold under the name &quot;concertina&quot; (or &quot;konzertina&quot;), and their keyboard systems were given names based on their creators, as with Band and Scheffler, or their city of origin, as with the Carlsfelder and Chemnitzer systems.

Strictly speaking, the Chemnitzer layout is one of 38, 39, 51 or 52 buttons, or one of the American expanded versions of the 52-button system. Especially in English-speaking countries, the term Chemnitzer is frequently applied to any of the square German concertinas that are not bandonions.

In the United States, especially in the Midwest, where other concertina types are not as well known, it may be called simply a &quot;concertina&quot;. 

There are also Chemnitzer concertinas with 65 buttons (130 notes in total) created by Albert Nechanicky which are called &quot;130 Key Concertinas&quot;. The treble keyboard has a 3 octave range from A3 to A6 and the bass keyboard has a complete Bass and Chord System with all 12 chromatic bass notes and 96 chords all of which can be played on both push and pull. These types of instruments are being revived and are becoming more popular in every genre of music, due to their versatility.

The 152-key Chemnitzer has 76 buttons and uses an extended layout from the 130, increasing its range and versatility, also being recovered.

Chemnitzer Concertinas have up to 4 Ranks of Reeds, although versions w/ 5 (or more) sets of reeds exist &amp; are being recovered.

== Innovations ==

The most notable innovations to the internal construction of the Chemnitzer concertina were made by German-American instrument builders in Chicago: Ernest Glass patented an aluminum action in 1912 (), which was quicker and quieter than earlier wooden actions; his son Otto further improved this action in 1928 (). Otto Schlicht patented an action in 1932 () which improved the pivot method of the action levers and allowed action levers to be manufactured by bending metal stock rather than by die stamping. In 1910, prior to these improvements, Robert Leppert was issued a patent (), the specification of which describes in detail an action containing jointed levers between keys and pallets, however the claims of the patent only relate to a means of expression control also described; it is not clear whether Leppert actually invented the action arrangement. 

Albert G. Nechanicky (1909-1986) invented the 130-key Chemnitzer concertina which is fully chromatic, allowing it to play in every key. This innovative concertina eliminates the need to carry several 104-key concertinas pitched in different keys, sometimes built without markings identifying their respective tonalities. He also published a method for his instrument which explains how its layout differs from others.

Many American and Italian builders (such as Eagle Concertinas) of the 20th century began using reeds and reed blocks like the ones in accordions as a cost-saving measure, to facilitate repair, and to improve the sound.

The Chemnitzer concertina has been predominantly used in folk music, especially polka music played by Central and Eastern Europeans and by nineteenth- and twentieth-century immigrants to the United States from those regions. &quot;Whoopee John&quot; Wilfahrt and Walter &quot;Li&#x27;l Wally&quot; Jagiello were two prominent examples of polka musicians playing Chemnitzer concertinas. However, the instrument, especially in its 52-button and larger versions, is capable of performing in other musical contexts, such as classical music.

<text>A comics anthology collects works in the medium of comics, typically from multiple series, and compiles them into an anthology or magazine. The comics in these anthologies range from comic strips that are too short for standalone publication to comic book chapters that might later be compiled into collected comic book volumes (such as manga tankobon and comic albums).

<text>Melissa Etheridge is the debut album by American singer-songwriter Melissa Etheridge, released by Island Records on May 2, 1988.

The album was re-released on September 23, 2003, as a two-CD remastered edition containing a bonus disc of ten tracks recorded live at the Roxy in Los Angeles and a five-track session from BBC Kent in April 1988.

As of 2010, the album has tallied 1,145,000 copies in the United States alone, according to Nielsen SoundScan. This figure does not include sales of the album between 1988 and 1991.

==Reception==

&quot;Billboard&quot; called the album an &quot;excellent debut&quot; and &quot;as varied as Etheridge is talented,&quot; noting that &quot;Bring Me Some Water&quot; should bring album rock radio to its knees, while &quot;Similar Features&quot; and several other tracks have broader - even AC appeal.&quot; &quot;

In their review, &quot;Cashbox&quot; stated that &quot;nobody this side of Tina Turner can belt like Melissa Etheridge. Insiders are calling her the next Janis Joplin, and she&#x27;s certainly got the whiskey voice,
the Texas twang and the hard-luck stories of sexual pain. But she&#x27;s also got an identity of her own and a big future.&quot;

AllMusic called it &quot;one of the most stunning debut albums of the 1980s...Etheridge&#x27;s true talent, however, is reconciling uncontrollable emotions such as jealousy with a strong and fiercely independent spirit. Perhaps that&#x27;s why Etheridge became a role model for a generation of young women who found her to be an uncompromising artist unafraid to expose (and celebrate) her strengths and weaknesses.&quot;

<text>Martin O&#x27;Connell (born 29 August 1963 in Carlanstown, County Meath) is an Irish former sportsperson. He played Gaelic football with his local club St Michael&#x27;s and was a senior member of the Meath county team from 1984 until 1997. O&#x27;Connell was listed on the &quot;An Post/GAA Football Team of the Millennium&quot;.

In a senior inter-county career that spanned two decades, O&#x27;Connell won every honour in the game at senior level. O&#x27;Connell claimed a Meath record of six Leinster and three National Football League titles.

O&#x27;Connell has also been the recipient of many awards off the field. He claimed four All Star awards as well as being named Texaco Footballer of the Year in his final playing season in 1996. Shortly after his inter-county career ended O&#x27;Connell was named in the left wing-back position on the GAA Football Team of the Millennium.

In May 2020, the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; named O&#x27;Connell as one of the &quot;dozens of brilliant players&quot; who narrowly missed selection for its &quot;Top 20 footballers in Ireland over the past 50 years&quot;.

The All-Ireland medal he won in 1987 was stolen during a burglary in November 2020 but retrieved a short time later.

<text>The DigiBarn Computer Museum, or simply DigiBarn, is a computer history museum in Boulder Creek, California, United States. The museum is housed in a 90-year-old barn constructed from old-growth Redwood in the Santa Cruz Mountains, which is adjacent to Silicon Valley. It was co-founded by Bruce Damer and Allan Lundell on May 7, 2001.

The primary focus of the museum&#x27;s collection is on the birth and evolution of personal, interactive computing, starting with the LINC (1962), considered by some to be the first true personal computer, and leading on up through the homebrew microcomputer revolution of the 1970s, the propagation of personal computing to homes and businesses in the 1980s and the spread of networked computing in the 1990s. The Digibarn does have a few large machines on display such as a Cray-1 supercomputer. One notable point is that a large number of the Digibarn artifacts are available to visitors in a hands-on fashion, allowing them to boot up, load software and interact with the machines.

The Digibarn collection has mainly been donated by individuals and companies in nearby Silicon Valley and around the world. The Digibarn has a major focus on the legacy of Xerox and the birth of the graphical user interface with a large collection of Apple products, although other historic computer systems are featured, including the Atari 400, Osborne 1, Kaypro II and the IBM 5150 (IBM PC).

As of December 2021, most of the collection is on a long-term loan at the System Source Computer Museum.

<text>Jacqui (Jacob) Eli Safra (born 1947) is a Swiss investor from Geneva. He is a descendant of the Syrian Jewish Safra banking family.

==Biography==
Jacqui Eli Safra is the son of Elie Safra (1922–1993) and his wife Yvette Dabbah (1927–2006) and the nephew of Edmond Safra. He is a graduate of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and worked in various positions at the Republic National Bank of New York.

Some of Safra&#x27;s investments include Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc., Spring Mountain Vineyard (Saint Helena, California), Parknasilla Hotel and neighbouring Garinish Island (both near Sneem, County Kerry, Republic of Ireland).

==Filmography==
Under the name J.E. Beaucaire (the name of the character played by Bob Hope in the film &quot;Monsieur Beaucaire&quot;), Safra appeared in minor roles in three movies and financed eight Woody Allen films through a production company, Sweetland Films, run with his long-time girlfriend Jean Doumanian, a former close friend of Allen.

===Actor===

*&quot;The Ox&quot; (1991) – Shop Owner
*&quot;Radio Days&quot; (1987) – Diction Student
*&quot;Stardust Memories&quot; (1980) – Sam

<text>Kasabian ( ) are an English rock band formed in Leicester in 1997 by lead vocalist Tom Meighan, guitarist and second vocalist Sergio Pizzorno, guitarist Chris Karloff and bassist Chris Edwards. Drummer Ian Matthews joined in 2004. Karloff left the band in 2006 and founded a new band called Black Onassis. Jay Mehler joined as touring lead guitarist in 2006, leaving for Liam Gallagher&#x27;s Beady Eye in 2013, to be replaced by Tim Carter, who later became a full-time band member in 2021. Meighan left the band in July 2020, with Pizzorno stepping up as full-time lead vocalist.

In 2010 and 2014, Kasabian won the Q Awards for Best Act in the World Today. They were named Best Live Act at the 2014 Q Awards and the 2007 and 2018 NME Awards. The band&#x27;s music is often described as indie rock, but Pizzorno has said he &quot;hates indie bands&quot; and does not feel Kasabian fit into that category.

Kasabian have released eight studio albums – &quot;Kasabian&quot; (2004), &quot;Empire&quot; (2006), &quot;West Ryder Pauper Lunatic Asylum&quot; (2009), &quot;Velociraptor!&quot; (2011), &quot;48:13&quot; (2014), &quot;For Crying Out Loud&quot; (2017)&quot;, The Alchemist&#x27;s Euphoria&quot; (2022) and &quot;Happenings&quot; (2024). The band&#x27;s music has been described as a mix of The Stone Roses and Primal Scream with the swagger of Oasis. Their music has won them several awards and recognition in the media, including a Brit Award in 2010 for Best British Group, and their live performances have received praise, the most notable of which was their appearance as headliners at the 2014 Glastonbury Festival.

==History==
=== 1997–2002: Early years ===
The band was formerly called Saracuse. They started recording at Bedrock Studios in Leicester where Chris Edwards had once worked as a sound engineer before moving into the telecommunications and data industry where he was employed by Bedrock&#x27;s parent company, Micina Technologies Group. The original band members came from Countesthorpe and Blaby, and the band formed while Pizzorno, Meighan and Edwards were attending Countesthorpe Community College. The first demo EP was produced by Scott Gilbert and handed to the band on 24 December 1998. Three songs were recorded live: &quot;Whats Going On&quot;, &quot;Life of Luxury&quot; and &quot;Shine On&quot;. Their first public appearance was at the Vipers Rugby Club to celebrate Edwards&#x27; 18th birthday with family and friends. Saracuse had several tracks included on a triple CD album called RED which was produced by Bedrock Studios and showcased Leicester bands in late 1999. They were also invited to take part in the event of the same name at Leicester De Montfort Hall later the same year but declined following the advice of their then-manager Allan Royland. The band was signed to BMG by London DJ and producer Sam Young and changed their name to Kasabian, after Linda Kasabian, a member of the Charles Manson cult who later went on to testify against Manson at his trial. In an interview with &quot;Ukula&quot;, bassist Chris Edwards explained how former guitarist Chris Karloff picked the name. Reading up on Charles Manson, the Kasabian name stuck with Karloff. &quot;He just thought the word was cool... so it was decided&quot;, says Edwards. is a common Armenian surname, from the dialectal Armenian &quot;ġasab&quot; taken from Arabic () &quot;butcher&quot; and the patronymic ending յան &quot;-yan&quot;. Sam Young had been working at Concept Music, a small independent label, when the band&#x27;s manager left the Saracuse demo on his desk. Concept wanted to sign the band and a two-single deal was offered. However, Young did not take over managerial duties and did not solely get them signed instantly to BMG. EMI were interested in the band as well.

=== 2003–2005: &quot;Kasabian&quot; ===

Their eponymous debut album was released in the UK on 13 September 2004, receiving good sales and generally positive reviews. During the recording, the band lived in a farmhouse near Rutland Water to avoid being disturbed. Kasabian featured at Glastonbury Festival 2005 on the &quot;Other Stage&quot;.

Despite having two prior single releases with debut single &quot;Processed Beats&quot; and lead single &quot;Reason Is Treason&quot;, it was their third single release &quot;Club Foot&quot; that gave Kasabian success in the UK Singles Chart. The song, which was written in the early years of Kasabian, went on to enjoy both critical and commercial success and has been performed at nearly every Kasabian live performance since its release.

During this period, various drummers played with Kasabian, including current keyboard player Ben Kealey, DJ Dan Ralph Martin, Martin Hall-Adams, brothers Mitch and Ryan Glovers and some others. While recording in Bristol, the band met Ian Matthews, who plays on &quot;Processed Beats&quot;, &quot;Butcher Blues&quot;, &quot;Beneficial Herbs&quot; and possibly some other songs on the debut album and B-sides. He was asked to tour with them in 2004 and became a permanent member in April 2005. The album was produced by Jim Abbiss.

=== 2006–2007: &quot;Empire&quot; and Karloff&#x27;s departure ===

During the recording of Kasabian&#x27;s second album, &quot;Empire&quot;, Christopher Karloff, one of the band&#x27;s chief songwriters, had &quot;artistic and creative differences&quot; and was asked to leave the band, according to the band&#x27;s website, although there is evidence to suggest that he left due to personal circumstances. In 2013 he confirmed that &quot;differences in the musical direction and personal unresolved things&quot; led to his departure. Ultimately, he contributed to three of the songs on &quot;Empire&quot;, including the self-titled first single.

The album, which was co-produced by Jim Abbiss, was released in the UK on 28 August 2006. &quot;Empire&quot; was released as the first single from the album and reached No. 9 on the UK Singles Chart &quot;Shoot the Runner&quot; reached No. 17 in the same chart. A third single, &quot;Me Plus One&quot;, was released on 2 January 2007.

Kasabian won the Best Live Act award at the 2007 NME Awards.

=== 2008–2010: &quot;West Ryder Pauper Lunatic Asylum&quot; ===
The band released an EP titled &quot;Fast Fuse&quot; in late 2007 which featured the songs &quot;Fast Fuse&quot; and &quot;Thick as Thieves&quot;. Both tracks are featured in their third album.

Kasabian started work on their third album in late 2007 with producer Dan the Automator. On 5 March 2009, it was revealed that the album title would be &quot;West Ryder Pauper Lunatic Asylum&quot;, with a release date of 8 June 2009. The song &quot;Vlad the Impaler&quot; was released as a free download for a period of 4 days, as a preview for the album. The promo video for &quot;Vlad the Impaler&quot; stars Noel Fielding of &quot;The Mighty Boosh&quot;. Fielding is a fan of Kasabian and appeared in an &quot;NME&quot; cover with the band. The album&#x27;s first single was the track &quot;Fire&quot;, which was released on 1 June 2009, used as the theme song for the English Premier League from the 2010–11 season onward, and the song &quot;Where Did All the Love Go?&quot; was released as the second single. The third single &quot;Underdog&quot; was used in the mobile and PC game Asphalt 8: Airborne as well as in the movie &quot;Takers&quot; (2010). Underdog was also used in the 2009 TV advert for Sony Bravia 200hz televisions. The advert also featured Kaka, at the time the world&#x27;s most expensive footballer at the time.

On 14 June 2009, &quot;West Ryder Pauper Lunatic Asylum&quot; reached No. 1 in the UK Albums Chart, spending two weeks there. &quot;West Ryder Pauper Lunatic Asylum&quot; was shortlisted for the 2009 Mercury Prize and named &quot;Best Album&quot; at the 2009 Q Awards. The band won &quot;Best Group&quot; at the 2010 Brit Awards. At the 2010 Q Awards the band won the &quot;Best Act in the World Today&quot;.

The first three albums were released as a box-set called &quot;The Albums&quot; in 2010.

=== 2011–2012: &quot;Velociraptor!&quot; ===

Kasabian started work on their fourth album, &quot;Velociraptor!&quot;, in November 2010 with Dan the Automator as producer. It was revealed in a number of interviews that some songs were already written. One track, titled &quot;Green Fairy&quot;, which featured on the &quot;London Boulevard&quot; soundtrack, is present on the record under the name &quot;La Fée Verte&quot;, but the album version is different from the soundtrack version. In June 2011, Kasabian closed the Isle of Wight Festival. They also headlined Rockness festival and played at Rock Werchter in July 2011. The band confirmed that the album would be released on 19 September 2011.

&quot;Switchblade Smiles&quot;, the first song to be heard from &quot;Velociraptor!&quot;, was exclusively played on UK radio on 7 June 2011 during Zane Lowe&#x27;s show on BBC Radio 1. The title and release date of the fourth album was also confirmed on the show. This first single from the album was available for visitors to listen to on the Kasabian website and was available as a download for people who pre-order the album. Two tracks from the album (&quot;Velociraptor&quot; and &quot;Switchblade Smiles&quot;) were premièred throughout the four-date warm-up tour including playing at the Leeds O2 Academy before the RockNess and Isle of Wight festivals in June 2011. A track from the album &quot;Days Are Forgotten&quot; was due for radio release on 22 July 2011. However, it surfaced online the night before. The album failed to crack the Billboard Top 200 chart upon its first week of release in the United States.

On 27 November 2011, Kasabian performed &quot;Goodbye Kiss&quot; during the BBC&#x27;s Formula 1 2011 closing season montage. In the same month, the band went on a full tour of the UK, including two sold-out gigs at the Capital FM Arena in Nottingham, supported at the shows by Miles Kane and Australian band ME. On 31 December 2011, Kasabian played a New Year&#x27;s Eve concert entitled NYE:Rewired at the O2 Arena, London. The event was streamed live on YouTube.

Following early 2012 dates in Japan, Australia and Europe, Kasabian launched their North American leg in Dallas on 12 March, with 19 dates in U.S. and Canada until late April. It was announced on 16 May on the Kasabian website that their show of 15 December 2011, that was filmed at the O2 in London, would be screened in over 60 cinemas in the UK and Ireland on 30 May 2012. The film, titled &quot;Kasabian Live! Live at the O2&quot; is distributed by Altive Media and Eagle Vision. On 29 June 2012, Kasabian performed at the Main Square festival in Arras France. At the end of the set, Tom Meighan returned to the stage without the band and performed the Beatles &quot;She Loves You&quot; unaccompanied, something that he had also done three days earlier in Athens, Greece, and on 16 June in Denmark at the NorthSide Festival. On 8 July 2012, the band headlined the UK festival T in the Park. Kasabian also headlined the Reading and Leeds Festivals on 24 and 25 August 2012.

=== 2013–2015: &quot;48:13&quot; ===
In March 2013, Sergio Pizzorno confirmed via Facebook that touring rhythm guitarist Jay Mehler had left Kasabian to join Liam Gallagher&#x27;s new band Beady Eye as a touring bass guitarist. Tim Carter joined Kasabian as a touring guitarist, first performing with the band on 6 March 2013 at Russell Brand&#x27;s Give It Up for Comic Relief, comedy and music gig at Wembley Arena. Carter is a music engineering producer and assistant to Dan the Automator, who co-produced &quot;West Ryder Pauper Lunatic Asylum&quot; and &quot;Velociraptor!&quot;.

Following a handful of gigs and festival performances throughout the year, Kasabian posted a teaser video in November 2013, announcing that they had been working on new material for the previous six months. The album was produced by Sergio Pizzorno. They also announced that they would be playing a homecoming gig in Victoria Park, Leicester to 60,000 people in June 2014, around the ten year anniversary of their debut album. On 4 April 2014, Kasabian were confirmed to be headlining the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury Festival 2014 on 29 June 2014.

On 28 April 2014, the band revealed that the album would be titled &quot;48:13&quot; and released on 9 June 2014. The lead single to promote the album, &quot;Eez-eh&quot;, was released on 29 April 2014. &quot;Eez-eh&quot; was performed at Glastonbury Festival 2014 alongside other tracks from 48:13 and previous albums. The show also featured two cover versions – &quot;Crazy&quot;, originally recorded by Gnarls Barkley, and &quot;Praise You&quot; by Fatboy Slim, which has been used as an intro to their song &quot;L.S.F.&quot;.

At the NME Awards 2015 Kasabian were nominated for 9 awards, beating the 2009 Oasis record (7 nominations).

=== 2016–2021: &quot;For Crying Out Loud&quot; and Meighan&#x27;s departure ===

In 2016, the band played a short tour in May, culminating in two concerts at Leicester City Football Club&#x27;s ground, the King Power Stadium, to celebrate the club winning the Premier League. At the first of these two concerts, Kasabian debuted a new song, &quot;Put Your Life On It&quot;, dedicated to the city and those who are no longer with us to see the city&#x27;s recent sporting achievements, accompanied by a gospel choir from De Montfort University. They also performed a short set in Leicester&#x27;s Victoria Park, as part of Leicester City&#x27;s victory parade on 16 May. Numerous inspirations for the sixth album also have been listed, including Nirvana, Bruce Springsteen, David Bowie and Claudio Ranieri. On 8 September, it was confirmed that &quot;Comeback Kid&quot; will be featured on the soundtrack of EA Sports game &quot;FIFA 17&quot;. In December 2016, the group were rumoured to be playing Reading and Leeds Festival the following year, but insisted that &quot;the band are currently finishing their new album&quot;. The band played the Reading and Leeds Festival in August 2017, as well as several other festivals that year.

In a January 2017 interview with &quot;NME&quot;, Pizzorno revealed that the upcoming album would contain a track called &quot;Bless This Acid House&quot;, which, in his opinion, is one of the best songs he has written.

In March 2017, it was confirmed that the band&#x27;s sixth album would be titled &quot;For Crying Out Loud&quot;, and released in May of that year. The album cover features a photograph of the band&#x27;s guitar technician Rick Graham. The band embarked on a world tour in support, that included performances at the Reading and Leeds Festivals and headlining TRNSMT in Glasgow.

In July 2020, it was announced that Meighan was stepping down from Kasabian by mutual consent due to personal issues. It would soon emerge that Meighan had assaulted his then-fiancée in April; he was later to appear in court in July. In light of these revelations, the band stated that they had decided to sever their professional relationship with Meighan.

Following Meighan&#x27;s sacking, remaining band founders Pizzorno and Chris Edwards met to discuss Kasabian&#x27;s future. They decided that the band should continue, and after considering the possibility of recruiting a new singer, Pizzorno felt it would be best if he took on the role himself. In late October 2020, the remaining band members issued a media statement confirming both Meighan&#x27;s permanent dismissal from the band and his termination as a partner in their touring and merchandising companies.

On 28 May 2021, Kasabian announced an October tour of the UK, their first since Meighan&#x27;s departure, with Pizzorno assuming all lead vocal duties and touring guitarist Tim Carter becoming a full-time member of the band. The new-look Kasabian made its debut in Glasgow on 13 October, with the band now joined by Robert Harvey of the Music as a multi-instrumentalist and backing vocalist.

On 1 October 2021, Liam Gallagher announced that Kasabian would be supporting him at Knebworth Park on 3 and 4 June 2022. The band also supported Gallagher at Hampden Park on 26 June that same year.

=== 2021–2023: &quot;The Alchemist&#x27;s Euphoria&quot; ===


On 27 October 2021, Kasabian released their first single in over four years, &quot;Alygatyr&quot;. On 6 May 2022, a second single &quot;Scriptvre&quot; was released, along with a music video and the announcement of their seventh album &quot;The Alchemist&#x27;s Euphoria&quot;, which was released on 12 August. On 3 June 2022, the day that Kasabian played at Knebworth Park as support act for Liam Gallagher, they released the third single &quot;Chemicals&quot; along with a lyric video and, on 20 June 2022, a music video.

&quot;The Alchemist&#x27;s Euphoria&quot; topped the UK Albums Chart, and despite polarising fan reception, it was generally praised by critics.

=== 2024–present: &quot;Happenings&quot; ===

On 16 June 2023, Kasabian released &quot;Algorithms&quot;, the lead single for their next record which would be released the following year. Commenting on the song, frontman Pizzorno said &quot;robots can&#x27;t experience emotion and being in the moment, whereas humans can, and that is the beauty that separates us&quot;. In December 2023, Kasabian announced a homecoming show at Victoria Park in Leicester, titled &quot;Summer Solstice II&quot; in July 2024. It follows the band&#x27;s first performance at the park back in 2014, their first since 2016.

On 21 February 2024, Kasabian announced their eighth studio album, &quot;Happenings&quot; and released &quot;Call&quot;, the album&#x27;s second single following &quot;Algorithms&quot;. In an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; discussing their upcoming album, frontman Serge Pizzorno added &quot;thinking about where we are with phone screens, us being able to create something that people can be a part of in the real world has got to be a positive. I’ve seen it in people’s faces at the shows, that need to experience something that just snaps you out for yourself, to feel a connection. Well, that’s &quot;Happenings&quot;&quot;&quot;.&quot; On 12 April 2024, Kasabian released the &quot;summer-ready&quot; single &quot;Coming Back to Me Good&quot;.

On 21 June 2024, the band released the last single from &quot;Happenings&quot;, &quot;Darkest Lullaby&quot;. Just over a week later, they played a surprise set at Glastonbury Festival 2024 on the Woodsies stage. &quot;Happenings&quot; was released on 5 July 2024 to generally favourable reviews, with the album being described as &quot;joyous&quot; and &quot;punchy&quot;. It debuted at #1 on the UK Albums Chart.

<text>The Leys School is a co-educational private school in Cambridge, England. It is a boarding and day school for about 565 pupils between the ages of eleven and eighteen, and the head is a member of the Headmasters&#x27; and Headmistresses&#x27; Conference.

== History ==
The nineteenth century saw the founding of a large number of new schools in Britain, especially by the churches—including the Wesleyan Methodist Church. Although there were already several leading schools that offered an education for the sons of ministers of the church, some Methodists were asking also for schools to be established for sons of lay church members. The Methodist Conference set up a committee to look at the possibility of starting a new school at either Oxford or Cambridge.

Following several visits to Cambridge, they discovered that a twenty-acre (80,000 m2) site called &quot;The Leys Estate&quot; was being offered for sale. The estate was situated within easy reach of the city centre on the Trumpington Road, and it was close to the River Cam and to a number of Cambridge Colleges. The estate was acquired for the sum of £14,275 on 27 September 1872. The Reverend Doctor W. F. Moulton, who had been the secretary of the committee, was asked to become headmaster of the new school. The school opened on 16 February 1875 with sixteen boys, all from English Methodist families. After two years there were 100 pupils.

During the twentieth century, The Leys grew significantly and by 1930 the number of pupils had reached 271. During World War II, the school temporarily moved to the Atholl Palace Hotel in Pitlochry, Scotland, returning to Cambridge in 1946. During the Cold War, the school was designated the auxiliary headquarters to the Regional Seat of Government for Cambridge in time of war. Today the majority of the pupils are boarders and since the admission of girls to the Sixth Form in the 1980s, the school has become fully co-educational. It now accepts pupils from the age of eleven, rather than the age of thirteen as it was before.

Due to its location, the school is popular with Cambridge academics as a place to send their children, as well as a place to teach. For example, the physicist Stephen Hawking sent his son to the school and gave a number of talks to its pupils.

==Coat of arms==
The red cross signifies the Christian foundation of the School whilst the open book and the lighted lamp are symbols of learning.

The significance of the red rose is obscure: three such roses appear in the arms of the largest Cambridge college, Trinity, and Cambridge bears two silver roses in its arms. The most likely explanation, however, of the red roses is that several of the School&#x27;s founders were from Lancashire and likely incorporated the Red Rose of Lancaster to symbolise their origins.

The stars of the original design may have symbolised aspiration or faith and hope in higher things. The wyvern, the crest used by the Wesley family, was presumably added to signify the association of The Leys School with the Wesleyan Methodist Church.

== Principles ==
Despite its Methodist traditions it has, for more than fifty years, been liberal on religion (although never secular). Many pupils received confirmation into the Church of England in the school chapel, and some others have had religious backgrounds from faiths other than the Christianity. Despite its religious liberalism, The Leys is predominantly a Christian school and they state openly that &quot;The School’s Christian ethos lies at the heart of our education philosophy.&quot;

Pupils attend a weekday chapel service on a Thursday or Friday morning and in addition are required to attend a number of weekend Chapel services, which happen on Sunday mornings.

The school motto is &quot;In Fide Fiducia&quot; (Latin for &quot;In Faith, Trust&quot;), which is also the motto for its associated prep school, St Faith&#x27;s School. The two schools make up The Leys and St Faith&#x27;s Foundation. The school song is Rev. B. Hellier&#x27;s &quot;Χαίρετε&quot;.

== Sport ==

The main sports played by girls during the three terms are:
*Hockey (Autumn)
*Netball (Spring)
*Tennis (Summer)
*Cricket (Summer)

Optional sports offered in the games programme include swimming, squash, badminton, athletics, S&amp;C, dance and sailing (at St. Ives). In addition, football, basketball and a range of other sports are offered through the after-school activities programme. 

The school has a range of sports facilities spread across its 50-acre (200,000 m2) site. Other than the above-mentioned sports, the sports pitches include concrete, grass and AstroTurf tennis courts and a football pitch. Indoor facilities include a fully-equipped fitness centre, a sports hall for indoor sports such as badminton, basketball and netball, three squash courts and an aerobics studio. The school has a 25-meter heated indoor swimming pool and a rowing boathouse on the River Cam, shared with King&#x27;s, Churchill and Selwyn Colleges. 

Famous Leysian sportsmen include Neil White (Olympic hockey in 1948); Freddie Brown (Captain of England&#x27;s cricket team); Geoff Windsor-Lewis (Wales Rugby, 1960); Paul Svehlik (England and Great Britain Hockey); Neil Christie (Olympic rowing, 1976 and 1980), Will Hooley (USA Rugby), Alex Goode (England Rugby) and James Albery (England and Great Britain Hockey).

== &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot; ==
The setting for popular novel and play &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot; is believed to have been based on The Leys where author James Hilton was a pupil (1915–1918). Hilton is reported to have said that the inspiration for the protagonist, Chips, came chiefly from W.H. Balgarnie, one of the masters at The Leys (1900–30) who was in charge of the Leys Fortnightly (where Hilton&#x27;s first short stories and essays were published). Over the years old boys have written to Geoffery Houghton, a master of The Leys for a number of years and a historian of the school, confirming the links between Chips and Balgarnie. As with Mr. Chips, Balgarnie died at the school, at the age of 82, having been linked with the school for 51 years and living his last years in modest lodgings opposite the school. Again, like Mr. Chips, Balgarnie was a strict disciplinarian, but would also invite boys to visit him for tea and biscuits.

Hilton wrote, upon Balgarnie&#x27;s death that &quot;Balgarnie was, I suppose, the chief model for my story. When I read so many other stories about public school life, I am struck by the fact that I suffered no such purgatory as their authors apparently did, and much of this miracle was due to Balgarnie.&quot; Furthermore, the facial hair of one of the masters at The Leys earned him the nickname &quot;Chops,&quot; a likely inspiration for Mr. Chips&#x27; name.

== The Leys Memorial ==
The Memorial Chapel of The Leys is situated on the grounds of the school. It was built as a memorial to the first headmaster of The Leys, William Fiddian Moulton. Plans for the chapel, designed by architect Robert Curwen, were first presented to the school&#x27;s second headmaster, W. T. A. Barber; he deemed the project an unnecessary luxury. Services were held in the school hall until 1904 when the governors approved the chapel&#x27;s construction. The cost, including all furnishings, was estimated in 1925 to have been £39,000.

The foundation stone was laid at the marble West Door by Princess Helena of Waldeck and Pyrmont on 8 June 1905 and the chapel was consecrated on 27 October 1906. The building&#x27;s design is Gothic, to complement the surrounding buildings. All visible woodwork is in oak. The roof comprises elaborately worked tussels and tracery work, somewhat after the lines of the famous roof of Westminster Hall. The floor is of alternating black and white marble. The chapel was designed to seat 350 boys, with the west balcony reserved for household staff.

In the First World War, 927 Leysians joined the armed services and 146 of them died. A memorial to the old Leysians who died, costing £48,000 and funded by donation, was on 6 June 1920 unveiled by the Duke of York. The memorial consists of four rows of names divided in the middle by a statue of an armoured St George, below which is written &quot;To The Immortal Memory of Old Leysians Who Fell In The War Of 1914–1919&quot;, and in large block capitals the words &quot;My Marks And Scars With Me To Be A Witness For Me That I Have Fought His Battles Who Now Will Be My Reward.&quot;

The chapel has fourteen windows; the Governors commissioned H. J. Salisbury to decorate them according to a unified theme.[&quot;&quot;] The work was modelled on the windows of the King&#x27;s College Chapel, Cambridge. Because the Leys is a Methodist school, the work was required to be simple and avoid complex symbolism. All but one of the windows depict passages from the New Testament concerning the story of Christ; the large window over the main entrance, however, shows ten Old Testament subjects foretelling the coming of the Messiah.

The Pulpit is made of oak and has a brass inscription reading &quot;To the Glory of God and for the Preaching of His holy word this Pulpit was carved by Anne Hobson, Helen Mary Chubb, and George Hayter Chubb, and presented by the latter to The Leys, October, 1906.&quot;

== The Leys Thistle ==
The Scottish community at the school set up the &#x27;Leys Thistle&#x27; in October 1915 in order to unite Scottish families while they were away from Scotland. The &#x27;Thistle&#x27; was created by Scottish members of North &#x27;A&#x27;. Following the first meeting on Halloween 1915, the &#x27;rush to join was tremendous&#x27; and many applicants were said to have lied about Scottish heritage to get into the club, such was the demand. The publication of the society was called the &#x27;Leys Thistle&#x27; and the first publication was in March 1917. The motto of the club is &quot;Nemo Me Impune Lacessit&quot; or &#x27;no one touches me with impunity&#x27;.

The first publication of &#x27;The Leys Thistle&#x27; states that the club had only three rules:
* &#x27;That we, a brotherhood of fellows, united with each other to help and do anything can do to live up to the glorious traditions of Scotland.&#x27;
* &#x27;To be an influence for good in the School: although we can&#x27;t do much, still we can live decent and clean sportsmen&#x27;s lives.&#x27;
* &quot;To keep the society going: although the older fellows are leaving, still we look to younger generations to keep the flag flying.&#x27;

<doc id="1176960" wikidata="Q4958403" url="?curid=1176960" title="Brave and Crazy">
<text>Brave and Crazy is the second studio album by American singer-songwriter Melissa Etheridge, released by Island Records on September 11, 1989. As of 2010, the album has sold 632,000 copies in the United States alone, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

==Reception==
&quot;Billboard&quot; commented that &quot;though more polished, rocker&#x27;s sophomore outing never sacrifices passion, emotion, and guts for style. Etheridge remains a one-trick artist - most of her songs are in a similar midtempo rocker guitar style - but her lyrics, delivered with startling conviction, lead her to the head of the class.&quot;

In their review, &quot;Cashbox&quot; stated that &quot;&quot;Brave and Crazy&quot; documents an artist still stoking the furnace of desire...Alternating between somewhat balladic songs and fierce rockers, the album does not suffer the dreaded sophomore slump, but it does convey the suffering born of the blues...While much is said of Etheridge’s vocal instrument, her prowess as a 12-string ace is a large part of why her compositions succeed as well as they do.&quot;

&quot;Allmusic&quot; noted that &quot;the throaty singer/guitarist/composer is slightly more reflective than on her first release, but no less confident. Nor is she is any less rootsy. Etheridge&#x27;s earthiness is a large part of her appeal, and she uses it most advantageously...As introspective as things get on this CD, Etheridge never becomes wimpy or self-pitying. For all its vulnerability, &quot;Brave and Crazy&quot; is the work of someone who comes across as a survivor.&quot;

<text>Hans Hotter (19 January 19096 December 2003) was a German operatic bass-baritone. He stood and his appearance was striking. His voice and diction were equally recognisable.

==Early life and career==
Born in Offenbach am Main, Hesse, Hotter studied with Matthäus Roemer in Munich. He worked as an organist and choirmaster before making his operatic debut in Opava in 1930.

He performed in Germany and Austria under the Nazi regime, avoiding pressure on performers to join the Nazi Party, and made some appearances outside the country, including concerts under the baton of Bruno Walter in Amsterdam, who advised him that if Hotter could not leave his family members he had little alternative but to remain in Germany. Hotter was unable to pursue an international career until his Covent Garden debut in 1947. After that, he sang in all the major opera houses of Europe. He made his Metropolitan Opera debut as the title character in &quot;Der fliegende Holländer&quot; in 1950. In four seasons at the Met, he performed 35 times in 13 roles, almost all Wagnerian.

Probably Hotter&#x27;s best known vocal achievement was his Wotan in &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot;, beginning with the &quot;Rheingold&quot; Wotan and ending with the &quot;Siegfried&quot; Wanderer, which he first sang in the German provinces in his early 20s, and adding the &quot;Walküre&quot; shortly thereafter at the German theatre in Prague; he played the roles until the mid-1960s, by which time his voice underwent a brief crisis owing to severe asthma, causing him to miss the first season of the post-war Bayreuth Festival in 1951, but he sang there for several years starting in 1952. His interpretation of Wotan was first recorded in a 1930s studio version of Act II of &quot;Die Walküre&quot;. In &quot;Die Walküre&quot; and &quot;Siegfried&quot; he was recorded in Decca&#x27;s famous Ring Cycle in the early 1960s, conducted by Georg Solti and produced by John Culshaw. His interpretation of the role of Wotan was also captured in live recordings at the Bayreuth Festival conducted by Clemens Krauss and Joseph Keilberth in the mid-1950s. He also directed a complete &quot;Ring&quot; at Covent Garden from 1961 to 1964. His portrayals of Amfortas and Gurnemanz in &quot;Parsifal&quot; was preserved on record in several of Hans Knappertsbusch&#x27;s live recordings from Bayreuth.

An admired Hans Sachs in &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot;, Hotter nevertheless preferred to sing the smaller and lower-pitched role of Pogner later in his career, because its tessitura was better suited to his voice. Also, he was afflicted in later years with a chronic back injury. Similarly, he sang in &quot;Parsifal&quot; first as the baritone Amfortas when he was younger and switched to the bass Gurnemanz later, and to the even lower bass Titurel after that. He was also celebrated for his Pizarro in Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Fidelio&quot;, of which a live 1960s recording from Covent Garden was issued for the first time in 2005 under the Testament label.

Hotter had a close working relationship with Richard Strauss. He performed in the premieres of the Strauss late operas: as the commandant in the 1938 opera &quot;Friedenstag&quot;, as Olivier in &quot;Capriccio&quot; in 1942 and the Jupiter in private dress rehearsal in 1944 of &quot;Die Liebe der Danae&quot;. After the end of the war, he also sang Sir Morosus in &quot;Die Schweigsame Frau&quot; with the Vienna Philharmonic conducted by Karl Böhm. Strauss dedicated his song &quot;Erschaffen und beleben&quot; to Hotter, who also recorded many of the songs of Strauss. Hotter&#x27;s daughter Gabriele married Strauss&#x27; grandson Richard in 1962.

Although his international fame was almost entirely in the German repertoire, in Germany and Austria he was also known for performing Verdi in the vernacular and was, for example, a popular Falstaff and a formidable Grand Inquisitor in &quot;Don Carlos&quot;, a role he also performed in Italian in several theatres, including the Metropolitan Opera in New York. He performed, and recorded, several non-German opera roles in German translation, including Count Almaviva (Mozart), Boris Godunov (Mussorgsky) and Don Basilio (Rossini).

Hotter was also known as a lieder singer. He left several recordings of Schubert lieder, including &quot;Winterreise&quot;, &quot;Schwanengesang&quot;, and other songs. He also sang sacred music and left recordings of Bach cantatas and one recording of Haydn&#x27;s &quot;Die Schöpfung&quot; in which he sang both the low bass role of Archangel Raphael and the soft, high baritone role of Adam.

A passionate anti-Nazi, Hotter used to make fun of Hitler at parties and refused to take part in the Bayreuth Festival during the Third Reich because of the Festival&#x27;s association with Hitler and his politics. According to Hotter&#x27;s obituary in &quot;The Times&quot;, Hitler kept Hotter&#x27;s records in his private collection. When Hotter was interrogated about this at a postwar denazification hearing, he answered that the Pope had some of them too.

Hotter never completely retired from the stage, making his final public appearance in his nineties after several seasons singing such significant character roles as Schigolch in Alban Berg&#x27;s twelve-tone opera &quot;Lulu&quot;. He was a notable narrator in Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Gurre-Lieder&quot;, a role he continued to take well into his eighties.

==Anecdotes==

At a brilliant performance of Walküre in Covent Garden in 1961 a mishap occurred during the final scene when Wotan is supposed to ever so slowly, silently depart from the stage. Right after striking Brünnhild&#x27;s rock to call on Loge to surround it with a cordon of fire, Hotter was blinded by the light and lost his footing, falling off the stage with a crash. As he was covered in armour, he hit ground like a bomb on a corrugated-iron factory. That, however, is not how the opera is supposed to end. Hotter did not want to suggest to the audience that he had jumped off the mountain in remorse after stripping his favourite daughter of her status as goddess and putting her to sleep. So, as the music continued, Hotter gallantly climbed back on stage, reassuring the audience that he was still alive and well and the music continued to the last chord.

At an earlier Walküre performance in 1956, also at Covent Garden, Hotter remembers a harmless but cheerful mishap. A bit late for his entrance in act III, he rushed backstage and swung an enormous cloak over his shoulders, entering the stage with his angry, impetuous &quot;Wo ist Brünnhild?&quot;. His appearance, however, gave rise to merriment in the audience, a situation he would only understand at the end of the opera. He successfully sang for more than an hour before he realized that towering above his shoulders, invisible to him, was the coat-hanger on which the cloak had been hanging, a fluffy, pink coat-hanger. As Ernest Newman noted in his review, he was surely &quot;the only man in the world who can actually step on stage and persuade you that he is God.&quot;

<text>Michael O&#x27;Connell (born 4 January 1937) is an Irish former Gaelic footballer. Throughout his 25-year club career, he played for Young Islanders, winning seven South Kerry Championship titles during a golden age for the club; he also played for divisional side South Kerry, and experienced success in the County Championship. At inter-county level, he captained Kerry to win the 1959 All-Ireland Championship; he later claimed a further three All-Ireland medals, as well as Munster Championship and National League successes.

==Early life==
Mick O&#x27;Connell was born on Valentia Island, County Kerry in 1937. His father was a fisherman who also worked on the family&#x27;s small farm on the island. From an early age, O’Connell showed his footballing talent and &quot;inimitable signs of excellence&quot;.

==Playing career==
===Club===
O’Connell began his club football career with neighbouring Waterville. When a football club, Young Islanders, was founded on Valentia Island, as per GAA rules O&#x27;Connell switched allegiance to his local parish team. He won three Kerry County Championship medals with the South Kerry divisional side.

===Inter-county===
====Underage====
O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s career with Kerry began in 1955 when he lined out in the Munster Minor Championship. Kerry lost the replayed Munster final to Tipperary.

====Senior====
He quickly joined the Kerry senior football team, making his debut in 1956 against Tipperary in the Munster Championship. He later lined out in the Munster final against Cork, but lost out in a replay. Two years later, in 1958, O&#x27;Connell won the first of eight Munster titles in a row; however, Kerry suffered a shock defeat by Derry in the All-Ireland semi-final. In 1959 O’Connell was captain when Kerry won the National Football League. He later guided his native county to another Munster title; however, he had to retire injured in Kerry&#x27;s All-Ireland victory over Galway.

Following a second National League victory in 1961 O&#x27;Connell captured his second All-Ireland medal in 1962 when Kerry defeated Roscommon in the final. A third National League victory quickly followed at the start of 1963. After two All-Ireland defeats by Galway in 1964 and 1965 Kerry surrendered their provincial crown to Cork in 1966 and 1967. O&#x27;Connell won a ninth Munster title in 1968; however, Kerry lost out to Down in the All-Ireland final. This defeat was followed by a great year of success in 1969 as O&#x27;Connell added a fourth National League medal to his collection before winning a tenth Munster title. He later won a third All-Ireland medal following a victory over Offaly.

In 1970 O&#x27;Connell entered the third decade of his inter-county football career, winning an eleventh Munster title in the process. A fourth All-Ireland medal quickly followed after a victory over Meath in the first 80-minute All-Ireland final. O&#x27;Connell claimed two more National League medals in 1971 and 1972, before winning his twelfth and final provincial medal in 1972. That year Offaly later defeated Kerry in O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s last All-Ireland final appearance. In spite of this loss, he was still presented with an All-Star award. O&#x27;Connell retired from inter-county football in 1973.

===Retirement===
In retirement from playing O&#x27;Connell published his autobiography, &quot;A Kerry Footballer&quot;, in 1974. Ten years later in 1984, the GAA&#x27;s centenary year, his reputation as one of the all-time greats was recognised when he was named in the midfield position on the GAA&#x27;s Football Team of the Century. In 2000 O&#x27;Connell was also named on the associations &#x27;Football Team of the Millennium&#x27;.

==Personal life==
In 1972 O&#x27;Connell married his wife Rosaleen. They have three children, Máire, Mícheál and Diarmuid. Mícheál married Emma, daughter of then-President Mary McAleese in December 2009.

<text>A micrometeorite is a micrometeoroid that has survived entry through the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Usually found on Earth&#x27;s surface, micrometeorites differ from meteorites in that they are smaller in size, more abundant, and different in composition. The IAU officially defines meteoroids as 30 micrometers to 1 meter; micrometeorites are the small end of the range (~submillimeter). They are a subset of cosmic dust, which also includes the smaller interplanetary dust particles (IDPs).

Micrometeorites enter Earth&#x27;s atmosphere at high velocities (at least 11 km/s) and undergo heating through atmospheric friction and compression. Micrometeorites individually weigh between 10−9 and 10−4 g and collectively comprise most of the extraterrestrial material that has come to the present-day Earth.

Fred Lawrence Whipple first coined the term &quot;micro-meteorite&quot; to describe dust-sized objects that fall to the Earth. Sometimes meteoroids and micrometeoroids entering the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere are visible as meteors or &quot;shooting stars&quot;, whether or not they reach the ground and survive as meteorites and micrometeorites.

==Introduction==
Micrometeorite (MM) textures vary as their original structural and mineral compositions are modified by the degree of heating that they experience entering the atmosphere—a function of their initial speed and angle of entry. They range from unmelted particles that retain their original mineralogy (Fig. 1 a, b), to partially melted particles (Fig. 1 c, d) to round melted cosmic spherules (Fig. 1 e, f, g, h, Fig. 2) some of which have lost a large portion of their mass through vaporization (Fig. 1 i). Classification is based on composition and degree of heating.


The extraterrestrial origins of micrometeorites are determined by microanalyses that show that:
*The metal they contain is similar to that found in meteorites.
*Some have wüstite, a high-temperature iron oxide found in meteorite fusion crusts.
*Their silicate minerals have major and trace elements ratios similar to those in meteorites.
*The abundances of cosmogenic manganese (53Mn) in iron spherules and of cosmogenic beryllium (10Be), aluminum (26Al), and solar neon isotope in stony MMs are extraterrestrial
*The presence of pre-solar grains in some MMs and deuterium excesses in ultra-carbonaceous MMs indicates that they are not only extraterrestrial but that some of their components formed before the Solar System.

An estimated 40,000 ± 20,000 tonnes per year (t/yr) of cosmic dust enters the upper atmosphere each year of which less than 10% (2700 ± 1400 t/yr) is estimated to reach the surface as particles. Therefore the mass of micrometeorites deposited is roughly 50 times higher than that estimated for meteorites, which represent approximately 50 t/yr, and the huge number of particles entering the atmosphere each year (~1017 &gt; 10 μm) suggests that large MM collections contain particles from all dust-producing objects in the Solar System including asteroids, comets, and fragments from the Moon and Mars. Large MM collections provide information on the size, composition, atmospheric heating effects and types of materials accreting on Earth while detailed studies of individual MMs give insights into their origin, the nature of the carbon, amino acids and pre-solar grains they contain.

Chemical analysis of the microscopic chromite crystals, or chrome-spinels, retrieved from micrometeorites in acid baths has shown that primitive achondrites, which represent less than half a percent of the MM reaching Earth today, were common among MMs accreting more than 466 million years ago.

==Collection sites==

Micrometeorites have been collected from deep-sea sediments, sedimentary rocks and polar sediments. They were previously collected primarily from polar snow and ice because of their low concentrations on the Earth&#x27;s surface, but in 2016 a method to extract micrometeorites in urban environments was discovered.

===Ocean sediments===
Melted micrometeorites (cosmic spherules) were first collected from deep-sea sediments during the 1873 to 1876 expedition of HMS &quot;Challenger&quot;. In 1891, Murray and Renard found &quot;two groups [of micrometeorites]: first, black magnetic spherules, with or without a metallic nucleus; second, brown-coloured spherules resembling chondr(ul)es, with a crystalline structure&quot;. In 1883, they suggested that these spherules were extraterrestrial because they were found far from terrestrial particle sources, they did not resemble magnetic spheres produced in furnaces of the time, and their nickel-iron (Fe-Ni) metal cores did not resemble metallic iron found in volcanic rocks. The spherules were most abundant in slowly accumulating sediments, particularly red clays deposited below the carbonate compensation depth, a finding that supported a meteoritic origin. In addition to those spheres with Fe-Ni metal cores, some spherules larger than 300 μm contain a core of elements from the platinum group.

Since the first collection of HMS &quot;Challenger&quot;, cosmic spherules have been recovered from ocean sediments using cores, box cores, clamshell grabbers, and magnetic sleds. Among these a magnetic sled, called the &quot;Cosmic Muck Rake&quot;, retrieved thousands of cosmic spherules from the top 10 cm of red clays on the Pacific Ocean floor.

===Terrestrial sediments===
Terrestrial sediments also contain micrometeorites. These have been found in samples that:
*Have low sedimentation rates such as claystones and hardgrounds
*Are easily dissolved such as salt deposits and limestones
*Have been mass sorted such as heavy mineral concentrates found in deserts and beach sands.
The oldest MMs are totally altered iron spherules found in 140- to 180-million-year-old hardgrounds.

===Urban micrometeorites===
In 2016 a new study showed that flat roofs in urban areas are fruitful places to extract micrometeorites. The &quot;urban&quot; cosmic spherules have a shorter terrestrial age and are less altered than the previous findings.

Amateur collectors may find micrometeorites in areas where dust from a large area has been concentrated, such as from a roof downspout.

===Polar depositions===
Micrometeorites found in polar sediments are much less weathered than those found in other terrestrial environments, as evidenced by little etching of interstitial glass, and the presence of large numbers of glass spherules and unmelted micrometeorites, particle types that are rare or absent in deep-sea samples. The MMs found in polar regions have been collected from Greenland snow, Greenland cryoconite, Antarctic blue ice Antarctic aeolian (wind-driven) debris, ice cores, the bottom of the South Pole water well, Antarctic sediment traps and present day Antarctic snow.

==Classification and origins of micrometeorites==

===Classification===
Modern classification of meteorites and micrometeorites is complex; the 2007 review paper of Krot et al. summarizes modern meteorite taxonomy. Linking individual micrometeorites to meteorite classification groups requires a comparison of their elemental, isotopic and textural characteristics.

===Comet versus asteroid origin of micrometeorites===
Whereas most meteorites originate from asteroids, the contrasting make-up of micrometeorites suggests that most originate from comets.

Fewer than 1% of MMs are achondritic and are similar to HED meteorites, which are thought to be from the asteroid 4 Vesta. Most MMs are compositionally similar to carbonaceous chondrites, whereas approximately 3% of meteorites are of this type. The dominance of carbonaceous chondrite-like MMs and their low abundance in meteorite collections suggests that most MMs derive from sources different from those of most meteorites. Since most meteorites derive from asteroids, an alternative source for MMs might be comets. The idea that MMs might originate from comets originated in 1950.

Until recently the greater-than-25-km/s entry velocities of micrometeoroids, measured for particles from comet streams, cast doubts against their survival as MMs. However, recent dynamical simulations suggest that 85% of cosmic dust could be cometary. Furthermore, analyses of particles returned from the comet, Wild 2, by the &quot;Stardust&quot; spacecraft show that these particles have compositions that are consistent with many micrometeorites. Nonetheless, some parent bodies of micrometeorites appear to be asteroids with chondrule-bearing carbonaceous chondrites.

==Extraterrestrial micrometeorites==
The influx of micrometeoroids also contributes to the composition of regolith (planetary/lunar soil) on other bodies in the Solar System. Mars has an estimated annual micrometeoroid influx of between 2,700 and 59,000 t/yr. This contributes to about 1 m of micrometeoritic content to the depth of the Martian regolith every billion years. Measurements from the Viking program indicate that the Martian regolith is composed of 60% basaltic rock and 40% rock of meteoritic origin. The lower-density Martian atmosphere allows much larger particles than on Earth to survive the passage through to the surface, largely unaltered until impact. While on Earth particles that survive entry typically have undergone significant transformation, a significant fraction of particles entering the Martian atmosphere throughout the 60 to 1200-μm diameter range probably survive unmelted.

<text>Jasraj (28 January 1930  – 17 August 2020) was an Indian classical vocalist, belonging to the &quot;Mewati gharana&quot; (musical apprenticeship lineage). His musical career spanned 75 years resulting in national and international fame, respect and numerous major awards and accolades. His legacy includes memorable performances of classical and semi-classical vocal music, classical and devotional music, albums and film soundtracks, innovations in various genres including &quot;Haveli Sangeet&quot; and popularizing the &quot;Mewati Gharana&quot; – a school of thought in Hindustani classical music. Pandit Jasraj taught music to amateur and professional students in India, Europe, Canada and the United States.

== Early life ==
Jasraj was born on 28 January 1930 in Pili Mandori, a village in the then Hisar district (now in Fatehabad district) of Haryana, in an artistic Brahmin family to Pandit Motiram, a classical singer and Krishna Bai. He was the youngest of three sons, in a family of classical singers. Motiram died in 1934 when Jasraj was four, on the day he was to be appointed as the state musician in the court of Mir Osman Ali Khan. His eldest brother was vocalist Pandit Maniram, who instructed Jasraj after the death of their father. Jasraj&#x27;s elder brother, Pandit Pratap Narayan, was also an accomplished musician and was the father of music composer duo Jatin–Lalit, singer-actress Sulakshana Pandit and actress Vijeta Pandit. Pandit Pratap Narayan taught Jasraj to play tabla starting at age 7, but Jasraj decided that he wanted to only sing by 14.

Jasraj spent his youth in Hyderabad, and travelled often to Sanand in Gujarat to study music with musicians of the &quot;Mewati gharana&quot;. Jasraj performed for Thakur Jaiwant Singhji Vaghela, the Thakur Sahib of Sanand, who was deeply dedicated to classical music, and received training from him.

In 1946, Jasraj moved to Calcutta, where he began singing classical music for radio.

== Personal life ==

In 1962, Jasraj married Madhura Shantaram, the daughter of film director V. Shantaram, whom he had first met in 1960 in Bombay. They initially lived in Calcutta, moving to Bombay in 1963. They had two children, a son, Shaarang Dev Pandit, a daughter, Durga Jasraj, and four grandchildren.

Madhura made a film, &quot;Sangeet Martand Pandit Jasraj&quot; in 2009 and directed her first Marathi film, &quot;Aai Tuza Ashirwad&quot;, in 2010, in which her husband and Lata Mangeshkar sang in Marathi.

== Career ==
=== Training ===
Jasraj was initiated into vocal music by his father, and later trained as a tabla accompanist under his elder brother, Pandit Pratap Narayan. He would frequently accompany Maniram in his solo vocal performances. He credits the vocalist, Begum Akhtar, as inspiring him to take up classical music.

Jasraj began training as a vocalist at the age of 14, after renouncing tabla in reaction to how accompanists were treated at the time . He would practice singing close to 14 hours a day. In 1952 when he was 22 he performed his first stage concert as a vocalist in the court of King Tribhuvan Bir Bikram Shah of Nepal in Kathmandu. Before becoming a stage performer, Jasraj worked as a performing artist on radio for several years.

He initially trained as a classical vocalist with Pandit Maniram, and later with Jaiwant Singh Waghela, a vocalist and beenkar.

=== Technique and style ===
==== Classical music ====
Although Jasraj belonged to the Mewati gharana, a school of music known for its traditional performances of , Jasraj had sung khayals with some flexibility, adding elements of lighter styles, including the . During the initial stages of his career, he was criticised for incorporating elements from other schools of music, or , into his singing. Musicologist S. Kalidas has noted, however, that this borrowing of elements across &quot;gharanas&quot; has now become more commonly accepted.

Jasraj created a novel form of called &quot;Jasrangi&quot; that is styled on the ancient system of &quot;&quot;, between a male and a female vocalist, who each sing different ragas at the same time. He was also known for presenting a variety of rare ragas including Abiri Todi and Patdeepaki.

==== Semi-classical and popular music ====
In addition to performing classical music, Jasraj had worked to popularise innovations in semi-classical musical styles, such as &quot;Haveli Sangeet&quot;, which involves semi-classical performances in temples. He had also sung classical and semi-classical compositions for film soundtracks, such as the song, &#x27;Vandana Karo&#x27;, composed in the raga &quot;Ahir Bhairav&quot; by the composer Vasant Desai, for the film &quot;Ladki Sahyadri Ki&quot; (1966), a duet with vocalist Bhimsen Joshi for the soundtrack of the film &quot;Birbal My Brother&quot; (1975), and a ballad, &quot;Vaada Tumse Hai Vaada&quot; for a horror film titled &quot;1920&quot; (2008) directed by Vikram Bhatt.

In memory of his father, Jasraj organised an annual musical festival called the Pandit Motiram Pandit Maniram Sangeet Samaroh in Hyderabad. The festival has been held annually since 1972.
On 28 January 2017, the production house Navrasa Duende celebrated Jasraj&#x27;s 87th birthday and 80 years of his service to music with a classical music concert titled &quot;My Journey, an Intimate Evening with Pandit Jasraj&quot; at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, New Delhi. He received a standing ovation.

==== Teaching ====
Jasraj tutored several students who have gone on to perform as classical musicians, including Saptarshi Chakraborty, Sanjeev Abhyankar, violinist Kala Ramnath, Sandeep Ranade, shehnai player Lokesh Anand, Tripti Mukherjee, Suman Ghosh, flautist Shashank Subramanyam, Anuradha Paudwal, Sadhana Sargam, and Ramesh Narayan.

He was also the founder of schools for Indian classical music in Atlanta, Tampa, Vancouver, Toronto, New York, New Jersey, Pittsburgh, Mumbai, and Kerala. Jasraj would spend six months of each year in the United States and Canada at either his home in New Jersey, teaching, or touring. At age 90, he was teaching some of his international students through Skype.

== Death ==
Pandit Jasraj remained in the US when the country entered its COVID-19 lockdown. He died at his home in New Jersey on 17 August 2020 at 5:15 am EST, due to cardiac arrest. His body was later repatriated on an Air India flight to Mumbai where it was cremated with state honours and 21-gun salute at Pawan Hans Crematorium in Vile Parle. The Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi said that his death &quot;leaves a deep void in the Indian cultural sphere. Not only were his renditions outstanding, he also made a mark as an exceptional mentor to several other vocalists.&quot;

On 27 December 2023, Modi released a commemorative postage stamp to mark 50 years of Jasraj&#x27;s music festival.

<text>A block diagram is a diagram of a system in which the principal parts or functions are represented by blocks connected by lines that show the relationships of the blocks. They are heavily used in engineering in hardware design, electronic design, software design, and process flow diagrams.

Block diagrams are typically used for higher level, less detailed descriptions that are intended to clarify overall concepts without concern for the details of implementation. Contrast this with the schematic diagrams and layout diagrams used in electrical engineering, which show the implementation details of electrical components and physical construction.

== Usage ==
As an example, a block diagram of a radio is not expected to show each and every connection and dial and switch, but the schematic diagram is. The schematic diagram of a radio does not show the width of each connection in the printed circuit board, but the layout does.

To make an analogy to the map making world, a block diagram is similar to a highway map of an entire nation. The major cities (functions) are listed but the minor county roads and city streets are not. When troubleshooting, this high level map is useful in narrowing down and isolating where a problem or fault is.

Block diagrams rely on the principle of the black box where the contents are hidden from view either to avoid being distracted by the details or because the details are not known. We know what goes in, we know what comes out, but we can&#x27;t see how the box does its work.

In electrical engineering, a design will often begin as a very high level block diagram, becoming more and more detailed block diagrams as the design progresses, finally ending in block diagrams detailed enough that each individual block can be easily implemented (at which point the block diagram is also a schematic diagram). This is known as top down design. Geometric shapes are often used in the diagram to aid interpretation and clarify meaning of the process or model. The geometric shapes are connected by lines to indicate association and direction/order of traversal. Each engineering discipline has their own meaning for each shape. Block diagrams are used in every discipline of engineering. They are also a valuable source of concept building and educationally beneficial in non-engineering disciplines.

In process control, block diagrams are a visual language for describing actions in a complex system in which blocks are black boxes that represent mathematical or logical operations that occur in sequence from left to right and top to bottom, but not the physical entities, such as processors or relays, that perform those operations. It is possible to create such block diagrams and implement their functionality with specialized programmable logic controller (PLC) programming languages.

In biology there is an increasing use of engineering principles, techniques of analysis and methods of diagramming. There is some similarity between the block diagram and what is called Systems Biology Graphical Notation. As it is there is use made in systems biology of the block diagram technique harnessed by control engineering where the latter is itself an application of control theory.
An example of this is the function block diagram, one of five programming languages defined in part 3 of the IEC 61131 (see IEC 61131-3) standard that is highly formalized (see formal system), with strict rules for how diagrams are to be built. Directed lines are used to connect input variables to block inputs, and block outputs to output variables and inputs of other blocks.

<text>Seán O&#x27;Neill (born 1938, Newry) is an Irish retired Gaelic footballer. He played with his local club John Mitchel and was a member of the Down senior inter-county team from the 1950s until the 1960s. O&#x27;Neill is one of only four Down players to win three All-Ireland titles.

==Career==
O&#x27;Neill scored 85 goals and over 500 points for Down senior football team in his career, and was a key figure in the county’s All-Ireland victories of 1960, 1961 and 1968. O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s credits include eight Ulster senior football medals and eight Railway Cup medals in 1960, 1963 to 1966, 1968, 1970 and 1971. He won three National League medals, in 1960, 1962 and 1968, as well as six All Star awards. Other honours include a Sigerson Cup medal with the Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast in 1958, whom he later coached to further wins. He played club football with John Mitchel GFC Newry, winning the Down Senior Football Championship in 1960, 1964, 1967 and 1968. He also won the Down Minor Championship with Newry Mitchels in 1956 - the year the club was formed. His brother Kevin won an all Ireland with down in the 1960s.

Along with Joe Lennon, Dan McCartan and Paddy Doherty, he was one of four Down men who won all three All-Ireland medals in the 1960s.

==Later life==
O&#x27;Neill was the Down minor team coach, winning the 1977 All-Ireland Minor Football Championship.

Sean coached the Queen&#x27;s University Belfast senior team in the early 1980s. As coach, he won the Sigerson Cup in 1982 and the Ryan Cup in 1984 and 1985.

In 1984, the Gaelic Athletic Association centenary year, he was honoured by being named on their Football Team of the Century. In 2000 he was again honoured by the GAA by being named on their Gaelic Football Team of the Millennium.

O&#x27;Neill is a solicitor by profession.

<text>Lacey&#x27;s Spring is an unincorporated community in northeastern Morgan County, Alabama, United States at the base of Brindlee Mountain. It is included in the Decatur Metropolitan Area, as well as the Huntsville-Decatur Combined Statistical Area. It is located south of Huntsville&#x27;s Land within Morgan County.

The community was established by three Virginia-born brothers, Hopkins, John, and Theophilus Lacy. The community took on their name and became the site for a U.S. post office in February 1831. &quot;Lacy&#x27;s Spring&quot; became &quot;Lacey&#x27;s Spring&quot; when the postal seal furnished by Washington officials mistakenly inserted an &quot;e&quot; into the name.

<doc id="1176993" wikidata="Q17062935" url="?curid=1176993" title="Never Enough (Melissa Etheridge album)">
<text>Never Enough is the third studio album by American singer-songwriter Melissa Etheridge, released by Island Records on March 17, 1992. the album has sold 997,000 copies in the United States alone, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

==Reception==
&quot;Billboard&quot; called the album her &quot;most mature effort yet, venturing into new stylistic
and lyrical territories. The first single, &quot;Ain&#x27;t It Heavy,&quot; is already strong at album rock radio, while dance gem
&quot;2001 &quot; Etheridge&#x27;s most adventurous composition to date - promises to cross over from rock to pop to dance audiences. All-out commitment from label bodes well for the singer&#x27;s third and strongest album.&quot; 

&quot;Cashbox&quot; awarded the album their &#x27;Pick of the Week&#x27;, stating that &quot;a more mature Melissa has returned with her third album...the 10-cut LP kicks off with the current single, &quot;Ain&#x27;t It Heavy,&quot; and is full of good rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll as well as the funky, danceable &quot;2001,&quot; and the very poignant &quot;The Letting Go&quot; which features Melissa alone, accompanying herself on piano. 

in their review, &quot;Allmusic&quot; stated that &quot;lyrically, it seemed to be the singer&#x27;s most personal album yet...It was a risk to issue a record like &quot;Never Enough&quot; after a three-year hiatus and into a market that might have expected &quot;Bring Me Some More Water.&quot; Etheridge&#x27;s choice of a single was even more gutsy. &quot;2001&quot; sounded nothing like anything she had done before. Guided by stuttering, synthetic percussion and a guitar line reminiscent of the Edge&#x27;s postmodern squawk on U2&#x27;s &quot;The Fly,&quot; &quot;2001&quot; was simultaneously one of the album&#x27;s coolest and craziest songs. It further indicated Etheridge&#x27;s maturation as a songwriter and helped make &quot;Never Enough&quot; her strongest statement to that point.

<text>KMTR (channel 16) is a television station in Eugene, Oregon, United States, affiliated with NBC and The CW Plus. It is owned by Roberts Media, LLC, which maintains a shared services agreement (SSA) with Sinclair Broadcast Group, owner of CBS affiliate KVAL-TV (channel 13), for the provision of certain services. The two stations share studios on Blanton Road in Eugene, where KMTR&#x27;s transmitter is also located. KMTR maintained separate facilities on International Court in Springfield, Oregon, until 2020 when the station relocated to KVAL&#x27;s building; master control and some internal operations for KMTR were based at the KVAL studios.

KMTR reaches additional viewers in west-central Oregon via co-owned full-power satellite stations KMCB (channel 23) in Coos Bay and KTCW (channel 46) in Roseburg.

==History==
The station began broadcasting on October 4, 1982, after former NBC affiliate KVAL-TV began selectively omitting certain NBC prime time broadcasts from its evening lineup, replacing them with alternate programming from rival network, CBS. The resulting conflict over this programming decision preceded the introduction of KMTR to the media market, and a switch of KVAL&#x27;s affiliation from NBC to CBS. The Columbia Empire Broadcasting Corporation of Yakima, Washington, acquired the station in 1984.

In late 1995, the station was bought by the Wicks Broadcast Group of New York City. In March 1996, Wicks Broadcast Group named Brian Benschoter the station&#x27;s new GM; he started shaking things up immediately for the third-place Eugene-based station. On May 21, 1996, he abruptly fired longtime sports anchors Brian Lamb and Steve Freedman without warning. Lamb, an -year veteran of the station, and Freedman, an -year employee, introduced the &quot;Prep Athlete of the Week&quot; segment that became an immensely popular weekly honor. The award is still considered by locals as the top media honor one can receive for high school sports in the Eugene/Springfield area. Lamb and Freedman were replaced by Joe Giansante, a sports talk radio host on KUGN AM 590.

In September 1998, an agreement between KMTR, The WB 100+ Station Group and the area&#x27;s cable provider allowed the station to launch cable-only WB affiliate &quot;KZWB&quot;. Since it was a cable-exclusive outlet, the call sign was not officially recognized by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). KMTR provided sales and promotional opportunities to the cable channel.

In March 1999, Wicks sold KMTR to the Ackerley Group, who merged with Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia) in 2001. KMTR was named &quot;Station of the Year&quot; for 2005 by the Oregon Association of Broadcasters (OAB).

In February 2006, the two satellite stations, KMTZ and KMTX, changed their call letters to KUCW and KTCW, respectively. In May 2006, KMTR signed a long term affiliation agreement with The CW, a replacement network for the WB. In September 2006, KMTR added The CW on a digital subchannel, replacing the cable-only KZWB.

On April 20, 2007, Clear Channel entered into an agreement to sell its entire television stations group to Newport Television, a unit of Providence Equity Partners. The deal closed on March 14, 2008.

KMTR shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 16, on February 17, 2009, the original target date on which full-power television stations in the United States were to transition from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate (which was later pushed back to June 12, 2009). The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 17, using virtual channel 16.

In 2012, Newport Television entered into agreements to sell most of its stations to the Nexstar Broadcasting Group, Sinclair Broadcast Group, Cox Media Group and Shield Media, LLC. It would not be until November 26, 2012, when Newport announced a sale to Fisher Communications. Because Fisher already owned KVAL-TV, Fisher assigned the rights to acquire the FCC license to KMTR Television, LLC, which is wholly owned by Roberts Media, LLC. Roberts Media is wholly owned by veteran broadcaster Larry Roberts. KMTR Television then entered into a shared services agreement (SSA) with Fisher. WHAM-TV in Rochester, New York, was the last remaining station to be owned by Newport Television as of November 2012 that had not yet been sold, until December 3 when it was announced that Sinclair would acquire the non-license assets of WHAM. While still awaiting FCC approval of the sale to KMTR Television, LLC, on April 11, 2013, Fisher announced that it would sell its properties, including KVAL and the planned SSA with KMTR, to Sinclair. 
The FCC granted its approval of KMTR to KMTR Television, LLC, on April 24 and the sale was consummated June 3, 2013. On February 19, KMTR was the sole Newport Television property, until June 1 when it was the last station to have its sale completed. After the completion of the sale, certain operations and personnel changes were made. The sale of the Fisher stations to Sinclair was completed on August 8, 2013.

In 2016, KMTR remained the only &quot;Big Four&quot; network-affiliated station in Western Oregon to produce its local newscasts in pillarboxed 4:3 standard definition until finally switching to 16:9 on October 22.

Beginning in 2019, KMTR began moving out of its original building in Springfield. As of summer 2020, KMTR&#x27;s studios and master control room are in the same facility as KVAL, and KMTR has upgraded its newscasts and syndicated programming to HD.

By the end of 2019, CW Eugene has been airing in 720p high definition over KMTR and KMCB (and all their associated repeater signals); however, KTCW (and its associated repeater signals) continued to air the subchannel in 4:3 standard definition, until it was upgraded by the end of March 2020.

On July 28, 2021, the FCC issued a Forfeiture Order stemming from a lawsuit against KMTR owner Roberts Media. The lawsuit, filed by AT&amp;T, alleged that Roberts failed to negotiate for retransmission consent in good faith for KMTR. Owners of other Sinclair-managed stations, such as Deerfield Media, were also named in the lawsuit. Roberts was ordered to pay a fine of $512,228.

KMTR served as the host station for the 2022 World Athletics Championships which were held at the University of Oregon&#x27;s Hayward Field. It was the only station on the West Coast where weekend prime time coverage of the meet was carried live; all other West Coast markets aired coverage on tape delay, though the event was carried live across the country on Peacock.

<doc id="1177013" wikidata="Q361131" url="?curid=1177013" title="Luke P. Blackburn">
<text>Luke Pryor Blackburn (June 16, 1816September 14, 1887) was an American physician, philanthropist, and politician from Kentucky. He was elected the 28th governor of Kentucky, serving from 1879 to 1883. Until the election of Ernie Fletcher in 2003, Blackburn was the only physician to serve as governor of Kentucky.

After earning a medical degree at Transylvania University, Blackburn moved to Natchez, Mississippi, and gained national fame for implementing the first successful quarantine against yellow fever in the Mississippi River valley in 1848. He came to be regarded as an expert on yellow fever and often worked &quot;pro bono&quot; to combat outbreaks. Among his philanthropic ventures was the construction of a hospital for boatmen working on the Mississippi River using his personal funds. He later successfully lobbied Congress to construct a series of similar hospitals along the Mississippi.

Although too old to serve in the military, Blackburn supported the Confederate cause during the Civil War. In the early days of the war, he acted as a civilian agent for the governments of Kentucky and Mississippi. By 1863, he was aiding Confederate blockade runners in Canada. In 1864, he traveled to Bermuda to help combat a yellow fever outbreak that threatened Confederate blockade running operations there. Shortly after the war&#x27;s end, a Confederate double agent accused him of having carried out a plot to start a yellow fever epidemic in the Northern United States that would have hampered the Union war effort. Blackburn was accused of collecting linens and garments used by yellow fever patients and smuggling them into the Northern states to be sold. The evidence against Blackburn was considerable, although much of it was either circumstantial or provided by witnesses of questionable reputation. Although he was acquitted by a Toronto court, public sentiment was decidedly against him throughout much of the United States. Today, historians still disagree as to the strength of the evidence supporting Blackburn&#x27;s role in the alleged plot. Any plot of this nature was destined to fail, however; in 1900, Walter Reed discovered that yellow fever is spread by mosquitoes, not by contact.

Blackburn remained in Canada to avoid prosecution by U.S. authorities, but he returned to his home country in 1868 to help combat a yellow fever outbreak along the Gulf Coast of Texas and Louisiana. Although the charges against him had not been dropped, he was not arrested or prosecuted. He rehabilitated his public image by rendering aid in yellow fever outbreaks in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1873, Fernandina, Florida, in 1877, and Hickman, Kentucky, in 1878. Dubbed the &quot;Hero of Hickman&quot;, Blackburn&#x27;s ministrations propelled him to the Democratic gubernatorial nomination the following year. In the general election, he defeated Republican Walter Evans by a wide margin. As governor, Blackburn won passage of several reforms in the areas of state finance and internal improvements, but his signature accomplishments were in the area of penal reform. Troubled by the conditions at the penitentiary in Frankfort, Blackburn attempted to ease overcrowding through liberal use of his gubernatorial pardon, earning him the derisive nickname &quot;Lenient Luke&quot;. He also secured approval of the construction of a new penitentiary at Eddyville, the adoption of a warden system to replace the corrupt private oversight of the old penitentiary, and the implementation of the state&#x27;s first parole system. Although his record of reform led historians to laud him as &quot;the father of prison reform in Kentucky&quot;, his liberal pardon record and expenditure of scarce taxpayer money to improve the living conditions of prisoners was unpopular at the time, and he was booed and shouted down at his own party&#x27;s nominating convention in 1883. After his term as governor, he returned to his medical practice and died in 1887. The Blackburn Correctional Complex, a minimum-security penal facility near Lexington, Kentucky, was named in his honor in 1972.

==Early life and family==
Luke Blackburn was born June 16, 1816, in Woodford County, Kentucky. He was the fourth of thirteen children born to Edward M. (&quot;Ned&quot;) and Lavinia (Bell) Blackburn. Blackburn&#x27;s great-uncle, Gideon Blackburn, was a well-known Presbyterian missionary and served as president of Centre College in Danville, Kentucky. Many of Blackburn&#x27;s relatives were involved in politics. His maternal grandfather was a delegate to the 1799 Kentucky Constitutional Convention and his uncle, William Blackburn, was President Pro Tempore of the Kentucky Senate and acting lieutenant governor in the administration of Governor James Turner Morehead. Noted statesman Henry Clay was also a distant cousin, and occasionally visited the Blackburn home.
Blackburn obtained his early education in the local public schools. At age sixteen, he began a medical apprenticeship under his uncle, physician Churchill Blackburn. During his apprenticeship, he aided his uncle in treating victims of cholera outbreaks in Lexington and Paris. He later matriculated to Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky, where he earned a medical degree in March 1835. After graduation, he opened a medical practice in Lexington and was instrumental in combating a cholera epidemic in nearby Versailles. He accepted no payment for his services during the epidemic.

On November 24, 1835, Blackburn married his distant cousin, Ella Gist Boswell. Boswell&#x27;s father, Dr. Joseph Boswell, had died in the Lexington cholera epidemic a year earlier. The couple&#x27;s only child, son Cary Bell Blackburn, was born in 1837. Just before Cary&#x27;s birth, Blackburn invested heavily in the hemp rope and bagging industry and suffered a significant financial loss when the business venture subsequently failed. In 1843, Blackburn was elected as a Whig to the Kentucky House of Representatives and served a single, undistinguished term. He did not seek re-election, and in 1844, he and his younger brother opened a medical practice in Frankfort, Kentucky.

Drawn by the city&#x27;s prosperous economy, the Blackburns relocated to Natchez, Mississippi, in 1847. Luke Blackburn quickly became an active member of the community, helping found a temperance society, joining a militia group, and becoming the administrator of a local hospital. He became a close associate of Jefferson Davis and William Johnson. In 1848, Blackburn served as the city&#x27;s health officer and implemented the first successful quarantine against a yellow fever outbreak in the Mississippi River valley. Using his own personal funds, he established a hospital for boatmen who navigated the Mississippi River. He also successfully lobbied the Congress to establish a hospital in Natchez; upon its completion in 1852, he was appointed surgeon there. In 1854, he implemented another successful quarantine against yellow fever. The Mississippi Legislature commissioned Blackburn to lobby the Louisiana State Legislature to establish a quarantine at New Orleans to protect cities along the Mississippi River; Louisiana authorized him to organize such a system.

Blackburn and his son Cary traveled to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in September 1854 to secure an apprenticeship for Cary under noted physician Samuel D. Gross. While they were there, a yellow fever outbreak hit Fort Washington near Long Island, New York. The mayor of New York City asked Blackburn to help treat victims of the outbreak; Blackburn accepted the invitation and refused compensation for his services. When he returned home in November 1856, he found his wife Ella, who suffered from dropsy and a nervous condition, ailing with a fever. Despite Blackburn&#x27;s efforts to save her, Ella Blackburn&#x27;s condition worsened and she died before the end of the month. Blackburn was stricken with grief, and friends encouraged him to tour Europe, as he had often spoken of doing, to ease his sorrow. He did so in early 1857, visiting hospitals in England, Scotland, France, and Germany. While in Paris, Blackburn met fellow Kentuckian Julia M. Churchill, who was traveling with her sister and niece. Blackburn and Churchill cut their journeys short, returned home, and were married in November 1857. After their honeymoon, the couple took up residence in New Orleans in January 1858, and Blackburn resumed his medical practice. A brief poem written by Blackburn indicates that the couple had a daughter named Abby, but the child apparently died as an infant, and her birth and death dates are unknown.

==Civil War==
Blackburn&#x27;s sympathies lay with the Confederacy at the outbreak of the Civil War. Too old to enlist in the Confederate Army, he acted as an envoy for Kentucky governor Beriah Magoffin to obtain weapons from Louisiana for the defense of Kentucky, but he failed to secure the arms. In early 1862, he was assigned to the staff of Major General Sterling Price as a surgeon. Mississippi Governor John J. Pettus appointed him as one of two commissioners to oversee the care of the state&#x27;s wounded soldiers in February 1863. After securing sufficient medical supplies for the wounded, Blackburn traveled to Richmond, Virginia, to meet with Confederate Secretary of War James Seddon and offered to serve as General Inspector of Hospitals and Camps without taking compensation or a rank. When the offer was refused, Governor Pettus asked Blackburn to travel to Canada to collect provisions for blockade runners there. Blackburn and his wife left Mississippi for Halifax, Nova Scotia, in August 1863, then continued on to Toronto (in what was then the Province of Canada) where they lodged in a boardinghouse. On one occasion, Blackburn was aboard a blockade running ship carrying ice from Halifax to Mobile, Alabama, when the ship was captured by the Union Navy. Union officials assumed Blackburn was a civilian passenger on the vessel and released him, after which he returned to Canada.

A devastating outbreak of yellow fever struck the island of Bermuda in April 1864. The island was a major base of operations for Confederate blockade runners, and the epidemic threatened their continued operations there. At the request of Charles Monck, the Governor General of the United Provinces of Canada, Blackburn traveled to Bermuda to aid soldiers and civilians there. Blackburn continued his ministrations until mid-July when he briefly returned to Halifax. The epidemic on the island continued, and Blackburn returned there in September to continue aiding the victims. He remained there until the outbreak abated in mid-October. For his efforts in Bermuda, Blackburn received 100 British pounds and a commendation from Queen Victoria. Although little is known of his actions in Canada for the remainder of the war, he was rumored to have been part of a plot to incite massive insurrections in New England as a diversion, allowing fellow Confederate agent Thomas Hines to lead a prison break at Camp Douglas in Chicago. When word of the plot was leaked to Union officials, they sent troops to reinforce Boston, Massachusetts, Blackburn&#x27;s rumored target, quashing his role in the operation.

===Yellow fever plot===

On April 12, 1865, just days after the last major battle of the Civil War, a Confederate double agent named Godfrey Joseph Hyams approached the U.S. consul in Toronto claiming to have information about a plot by Blackburn to infect Northern cities with yellow fever. Hyams said he and Blackburn had been introduced by Confederate agent Stuart Robinson at the Queen&#x27;s Hotel in Toronto in December 1863. According to Hyams, he had agreed to help Blackburn smuggle trunks of clothes used by patients infected with yellow fever into Boston, Massachusetts; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Washington D.C.; New Bern, North Carolina; and Norfolk, Virginia (the latter two cities being occupied by Union troops). Hyams said he was instructed to sell the trunks&#x27; contents to used clothing merchants, and that Blackburn, subscribing to the common nineteenth century belief that yellow fever could be spread by contact, hoped that by dispersing the &quot;contaminated&quot; articles throughout these major cities he could trigger an epidemic that would cripple the Northern war effort. Hyams further alleged that Blackburn had filled a valise with fine shirts and instructed him to deliver it to President Abraham Lincoln at the White House, saying they were from an anonymous admirer. Upon completion of these tasks, Hyams said, Blackburn had promised to pay him $60,000. Hyams claimed he delivered the trunks as agreed, but did not attempt to deliver the valise to President Lincoln. According to his testimony, he never received more than nominal compensation for his efforts, partially prompting his decision to reveal the plot to the authorities.

Independent of Hyams&#x27; testimony, officials in Bermuda had received information that Blackburn had collected a second cache of &quot;contaminated&quot; garments and linens. According to this information, Blackburn contracted with Edward Swan, a hotel owner in St. George&#x27;s, to store them until mid-1865 and then ship them to New York City, in an attempt to start an outbreak there. Acting on this intelligence, Bermudan officials raided Swan&#x27;s hotel and found three trunks of garments and linens with stains consistent with the &quot;black vomit&quot; symptomatic of yellow fever. Swan was arrested and charged with violating the local health code. The contents of the trunks were soaked with sulfuric acid and buried.

The assassination of Abraham Lincoln just two days after Hyams related his story to Canadian officials heightened U.S. interest in arresting Blackburn to connect the assassination to Confederate President Jefferson Davis and his operatives in Canada. The U.S. Bureau of Military Justice ordered Blackburn&#x27;s arrest for attempted murder, but an arrest could not be effected because Blackburn was in Canada, beyond the Bureau&#x27;s jurisdiction. The subsequent discovery of the cache of garments and linens in Bermuda convinced Canadian authorities to act. They arrested Blackburn on May 19, 1865, charging him with violation of Canada&#x27;s neutrality in the Civil War. He was held for trial on $8,000 bond. In October 1865, a Toronto court acquitted Blackburn on grounds that the trunks of garments had been shipped to Nova Scotia, which was out of the court&#x27;s jurisdiction. A charge of conspiracy to commit murder was dropped after Blackburn&#x27;s attorney reminded the court that such a charge could only be made if the accused had made an attempt on the life of a head of state. Blackburn did not testify in the trial and only spoke of the plot years later when he denounced it as &quot;too preposterous for intelligent gentlemen to believe.&quot;

Historians disagree as to the strength of the evidence against Blackburn, and many of the federal and Confederate records relating to the case have been lost. Writing in the journal &quot;America&#x27;s Civil War&quot;, U.S. Navy physician J. D. Haines notes that the Confederate agents who testified against Blackburn were of dubious reputation. Hyams in particular received immunity from prosecution and was paid for his testimony. Haines also points out that Blackburn&#x27;s previous reputation as a humanitarian was ignored; in the hysteria following Lincoln&#x27;s assassination, conspiracy theories abounded and Northerners were inclined to believe the worst about anyone with Confederate sympathies. &quot;The New York Times&quot; vilified Blackburn as &quot;The Yellow Fever Fiend&quot; and &quot;a hideous devil&quot;. Historian Edward Steers concedes that the evidence against Blackburn was circumstantial, but in his book &quot;Blood on the Moon&quot;, he contends that enough evidence survives not only to prove Blackburn&#x27;s involvement in the plot, but to show that high-ranking Confederate officials up to and including President Jefferson Davis were aware of, condoned, and financed it. As well as a violation of his Hippocratic Oath, Blackburn&#x27;s plot was one of the earliest attempts at a refined biological warfare.

==Post-war humanitarian work==
After his acquittal, Blackburn remained in Canada to avoid arrest and prosecution by U.S. authorities. When he learned of a yellow fever outbreak in New Orleans and the Texas Gulf Coast, Blackburn wrote to President Andrew Johnson on September 4, 1867, asking permission to return to the U.S. and help treat the disease. Not waiting for Johnson&#x27;s response—which never came—Blackburn returned to the U.S., arriving in Louisville on September 25, 1867, en route to New Orleans. After rendering aid during the epidemic, he and his family moved to an Arkansas plantation owned by his wife.

No attempt to arrest Blackburn was made, and he returned to Kentucky with his family in early 1873. The family lived in Louisville&#x27;s Galt House hotel, and Blackburn resumed his medical practice in that city. During a cholera epidemic in 1873, Blackburn rightly theorized that the disease was spread by the consumption of contaminated water, but most citizens accepted the competing theory that cholera was a miasmatic disease. This theory was espoused by Thomas S. Bell, a better-known physician in Louisville. Thousands died as a result of failing to heed Blackburn&#x27;s advice to boil potentially contaminated water before drinking it. Blackburn&#x27;s philanthropic work included treating victims of yellow fever outbreaks in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1873 and Fernandina, Florida, in 1877. He refused to accept compensation for his services in either city, but was presented with gifts from appreciative residents in both cases. Several southern newspapers also carried glowing accounts of Blackburn&#x27;s service.

Louisville&#x27;s &quot;Courier-Journal&quot; carried an announcement of Blackburn&#x27;s candidacy for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in Kentucky on February 11, 1878. It is not clear why, with only meager prior political experience, he decided to seek the office. He may have been influenced by the members of his family who were involved in politics. His brother Joseph was, at the time, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, and another brother, James, had served in the Kentucky Senate. Two of his wife&#x27;s brothers also held political office; Samuel Churchill was Secretary of State under Governors John L. Helm, John W. Stevenson, and Preston Leslie, and Thomas Churchill served as treasurer and later governor of the state of Arkansas. Whatever the reason, even his friends did not believe his announcement was wise due to his political inexperience. He opened his campaign with a speech in Owen County on March 29, 1878.
About the same time as his gubernatorial campaign began, Blackburn appeared before the Kentucky General Assembly to advocate measures to protect the state against disease outbreaks, including the creation of a state board of health and the construction of quarantine centers in the state&#x27;s border towns. To a large degree, his pleas fell upon deaf ears, with the exception of his proposal for the state board of health, which was created in March 1878. Soon after, news came that yellow fever had appeared in the lower Mississippi Valley earlier than usual; by August 1878, it had reached epidemic proportions. Blackburn advocated implementing quarantines to deal with the influx of people fleeing north to escape the disease, but many of the state&#x27;s doctors did not believe yellow fever could survive as far north as Kentucky. Some towns in the Jackson Purchase region attempted to implement crude quarantines, but the city of Louisville completely ignored Blackburn&#x27;s advice and welcomed refugees from the South. Blackburn temporarily halted his gubernatorial campaign and traveled to Louisville to help treat those who arrived there already suffering from the disease.

On September 5, the mayor of Hickman, Kentucky, a small western town along the Mississippi River, telegraphed the state board of health, informing them that yellow fever had reached epidemic levels in the city and requesting that Blackburn be sent to them as soon as possible. Blackburn arrived on September 7 to find that roughly 20 percent of the town&#x27;s population were ill with yellow fever. He organized cleanup crews to disinfect the town and a squad of Negroes to guard vacated homes. In late September, when it appeared the Hickman epidemic was waning, Blackburn traveled to Chattanooga and Martin, Tennessee, to render aid, but within ten days, he received word that the outbreak in Hickman had resurged and spread to nearby Fulton, Kentucky. Blackburn returned to the area and continued his ministrations until late October, when the outbreak had fully subsided.

==Governor of Kentucky==

Returning to Louisville, Blackburn was fêted at the Galt House hotel. For weeks, receptions were held in his honor, gifts of appreciation poured in from across the state and region, and he was hailed as the &quot;Hero of Hickman&quot;. It was against this backdrop that he resumed his gubernatorial campaign in November 1878. Two other men also sought the Democratic gubernatorial nomination: Lieutenant Governor John C. Underwood and former Congressman Thomas Laurens Jones. Before the yellow fever outbreak, Underwood had been the favorite, but public sentiment had turned in Blackburn&#x27;s favor after his service to the people of Hickman. Underwood questioned whether Blackburn&#x27;s medical background had adequately prepared him to be the state&#x27;s chief executive; he also mounted a failed legal challenge that claimed Blackburn had not met the constitutional state residency requirement of seven years. In late March 1879, however, Underwood determined that he would not be able to overcome the &quot;avalanche&quot; of support for Blackburn and withdrew his candidacy. At the May 1 Democratic nominating convention, Blackburn was nominated by an overwhelming majority—935 delegates to the convention voted for him compared to just 22 for Jones.

Due to ill health, Blackburn could not take an active part in the campaign. He sought relief from his ailments at Crab Orchard Springs, while much of the campaign oratory was delivered on his behalf by fellow Democrats Boyd Winchester, Parker Watkins Hardin, W. C. P. Breckinridge, and others. Republicans, who had nominated Walter Evans, had fewer speakers with which to canvass the state, and were at a decided disadvantage. Democrats attacked the administrations of Republican Presidents Ulysses S. Grant and Rutherford B. Hayes, cited the alleged abuses perpetrated in the South by Carpetbaggers and Scalawags, and leveled charges that Republicans favored capitalists over the state&#x27;s working class. Republican orators, led by William O&#x27;Connell Bradley, charged Democrats with financial extravagance, citing a $3 million surplus in the state treasury in 1865 compared with a $1 million debt in 1878. Bradley claimed that Democrats had maintained their power in the state through gerrymandering election districts. He cited poor conditions at the state penitentiary and inadequate funding of public education as evidence of Democratic mismanagement of the state.

In late May 1879, the Republican-leaning &quot;Cincinnati Gazette&quot; reported on Blackburn&#x27;s alleged plot to infect northern cities with yellow fever during the Civil War, apparently the first time the incident had been reported in Kentucky. The newspaper formed a special department for the sole purpose of investigating the claims against Blackburn and published a daily column in which it related the department&#x27;s findings. In the wake of the &quot;Gazette&quot;&#x27;s investigation, other Northern newspapers, including the &quot;Canton Repository&quot;, &quot;Cleveland Herald&quot;, and &quot;Philadelphia Press&quot;, derided Kentuckians for even considering the election of Blackburn (who they nicknamed &quot;Dr. Blackvomit&quot;). The scandal gained more traction nationally than in Kentucky. Blackburn did not respond to the accusations, and Kentucky Republicans barely made mention of it, knowing that the northern press in general and the &quot;Cincinnati Gazette&quot; in particular were widely distrusted in the state. Kentucky newspaper editor Henry Watterson opined that most Kentuckians already knew about Blackburn&#x27;s Civil War activities and either explicitly approved of them or were apathetic about events that had occurred a decade and a half earlier.

In the general election, Blackburn defeated Evans by a vote of 125,790 (56%) to 81,882 (36%), the largest Democratic margin of victory in a decade. Greenback Party candidate C. W. Cook garnered 18,954 votes, approximately 8 percent of the total votes cast. These votes came mainly at the expense of Blackburn and the Democrats. Until the election of Ernie Fletcher in 2003, Blackburn would be the only physician elected governor of Kentucky.

===Financial reform===
Immediately after his election, Blackburn began planning ways to balance the state&#x27;s budget. In his 1880 address to the legislature, Blackburn reported that since 1867, the state had spent three million dollars more than it had taken in. Previous administrations had paid for the excess by using money from the federal government for &quot;war claims&quot; by the state and money from the state&#x27;s sinking fund. Further, an economic depression had lowered property values and the state legislature had, in response to public demand, lowered taxes, further shrinking government income. Blackburn forcefully asserted that the situation must be remedied.

In response to recommendations from the governor, the General Assembly enacted cost-saving reforms in the judicial system, including the abolition of criminal, chancery, and common pleas courts, dividing the state instead into 18 circuit court districts. The number of jurors required for certain cases was reduced, juror salaries were set at a fixed rate, and penalties were established for soliciting jury duty. Reimbursement amounts for transporting and caring for prisoners were capped to prevent inflation of costs by local law enforcement. Salaries of state officials were reduced by 20 percent. The state property tax was also increased from 40 to 45 cents per $100 of taxable property, and laws were strengthened to facilitate the collection of delinquent taxes.

===Penal reform===

Blackburn&#x27;s primary focus was on reforms to the state&#x27;s penal system. According to Blackburn, 953 prisoners were being held at the state penitentiary, although the structure only contained 780 cells. Conditions in the penitentiary were poor and resulted in many illnesses. One fifth of the state&#x27;s prisoners suffered from pneumonia in 1875. When Blackburn became governor in 1879, the mortality rate of the almost one thousand inmates in the state penitentiary was over 7 percent. Scurvy caused by poor nutrition afflicted 75 percent of prisoners. Blackburn compared conditions at the penitentiary to the infamous Black Hole of Calcutta.

The poor conditions at the penitentiary were partially because the state leased management of the facility to private contractors, who frequently neglected prisoners&#x27; needs to cut costs. These contractors often provided benefits such as cheap laundry services and free meals to legislators to secure contracts and encourage them to ignore their abuse of prisoners. Blackburn called for the contract system to be replaced with a system of oversight by wardens employed by the state.

Before the General Assembly could act on his recommendations, Blackburn began granting pardons to relieve prison overcrowding. He particularly favored clemency for the incurably sick so they could go home to die with their families. During his term, Blackburn pardoned over one thousand individuals, earning him the nickname &quot;Lenient Luke&quot;. The pardons were extremely unpopular with both the public and the Democratic political establishment. Several newspapers claimed that Blackburn sold pardons for two dollars apiece, though no evidence exists to support such an accusation.

In the 1880 legislative session, the General Assembly approved Blackburn&#x27;s recommendation to construct a new state penitentiary in Eddyville. Legislators also responded to Blackburn&#x27;s call for a warden system, authorizing the state to employ a warden, deputy warden, clerk, physician, and chaplain for the penitentiary. As a means of alleviating overcrowding, the Assembly allowed private contractors to lease convict labor from the penitentiary. These contractors would be responsible for feeding, clothing, housing, and caring for the prisoners in their charge. With no oversight of these contractors, however, prisoner abuses again occurred, including malnutrition, overwork, and beatings that often resulted in injury and death. Finally, legislators adopted, for the first time in state history, a rudimentary parole process. Due to his extensive record of reforming the state prison system, Blackburn is considered &quot;the father of prison reforms in Kentucky&quot;.
===Other reforms===
Blackburn was also a zealous advocate for improved river navigation. He persuaded the legislature to apply a $100,000 allocation from the U.S. Congress to the improvement of navigation along the Kentucky River and gave concurrent jurisdiction over the Big Sandy and Licking Rivers to the federal government so they could be improved as well. Legislators also approved construction of a canal around the Cumberland Falls and improvements along the Tradewater River.

Blackburn&#x27;s other accomplishments included establishing a state railroad commission and reorganizing the Kentucky Agricultural and Mechanical College. Kentucky A&amp;M had been separated from Kentucky University under Blackburn&#x27;s predecessor, James B. McCreary; Blackburn now advocated that it be put under the control of and supported by the state. This was done, and the rechartered institution, located at Lexington, became known commonly as the State College; in 1916, it was renamed the University of Kentucky.

==Later life and death==

Despite his record of reforms, Democratic party leaders were largely displeased with Blackburn and his administration. They decried his record number of pardons and resented the fact that he did not give more consideration to party service and loyalty when appointing individuals to state jobs. Further, state newspapers noted a lack of eloquence by the governor, and this provided additional fodder for Blackburn&#x27;s critics. Having announced at the beginning of his term that he would seek no further political office, Blackburn nonetheless attempted to defend his record in a speech at the 1883 Democratic nominating convention, but boos and shouts for him to sit down almost drowned out the address. Finally, Blackburn responded to the heckling by saying he expected to be criticized for his reforms, but that anyone who charged his administration with corruption was a &quot;liar—a base and infamous liar&quot;. At this, the clamor from the crowd became deafening, and Blackburn was forced to end his address and take his seat.

Blackburn retired from public life at the expiration of his term. He briefly visited a Virginia resort before returning to his apartment at Louisville&#x27;s Galt House and resuming his medical practice. While attending the 1883 National Conference of Charities, Blackburn was lauded for his prison reforms by guest speaker George Washington Cable. He also received praise at a similar conference in Saratoga Springs, New York, a few weeks later.

A few months after his return to Louisville, Blackburn opened a sanatorium near Cave Hill Cemetery. His failing health impeded the success of the endeavor, however, and in January 1887, he returned to the state capital of Frankfort—a city he regarded as his home—knowing that death was near. After a prolonged illness, he became comatose and died September 14, 1887. He was buried in Frankfort Cemetery.

On May 27, 1891, the state erected a monument over Blackburn&#x27;s grave. The granite monument features a bas-relief depicting the Parable of the Good Samaritan. In 1972, the state opened the Blackburn Correctional Complex, a minimum security prison near Lexington named for Governor Blackburn.

<doc id="1177019" wikidata="Q421787" url="?curid=1177019" title="Copper(II) oxide">
<text>Copper(II) oxide or cupric oxide is an inorganic compound with the formula CuO. A black solid, it is one of the two stable oxides of copper, the other being Cu2O or copper(I) oxide (cuprous oxide). As a mineral, it is known as tenorite, or sometimes black copper. It is a product of copper mining and the precursor to many other copper-containing products and chemical compounds.

==Production==
It is produced on a large scale by pyrometallurgy, as one stage in extracting copper from its ores. The ores are treated with an aqueous mixture of ammonium carbonate, ammonia, and oxygen to ultimately give copper(II) ammine complex carbonates, such as . After extraction from the residues and after separation from iron, lead, etc. impurities, the carbonate salt is decomposed with steam to give CuO. 

It can be formed by heating copper in air at around 300–800 °C:
For laboratory uses, copper(II) oxide is conveniently prepared by pyrolysis of copper(II) nitrate or basic copper(II) carbonate: 
: (180°C)
Dehydration of cupric hydroxide has also been demonstrated:

==Reactions==
Copper(II) oxide reacts with mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and nitric acid to give the corresponding hydrated copper(II) salts:
: CuO + 2 HNO3 → Cu(NO3)2 + H2O
: CuO + 2 HCl → CuCl2 + H2O
: CuO + H2SO4 → CuSO4 + H2O

In presence of water it reacts with concentrated alkali to form the corresponding cuprate salts:
: 2 NaOH + CuO + H2O → Na2[Cu(OH)4]

It can also be reduced to copper metal using hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon:
: CuO + H2 → Cu + H2O
: CuO + CO → Cu + CO2
: 2 CuO + C → 2Cu + CO2
When cupric oxide is substituted for iron oxide in thermite the resulting mixture is a low explosive, not an incendiary.

==Structure and physical properties==
Copper(II) oxide belongs to the monoclinic crystal system. The copper atom is coordinated by 4 oxygen atoms in an approximately square planar configuration.

The work function of bulk CuO is 5.3 eV.

==Uses==
As a significant product of copper mining, copper(II) oxide is the starting point for the production of many other copper salts. For example, many wood preservatives are produced from copper oxide.

Cupric oxide is used as a pigment in ceramics to produce blue, red, and green, and sometimes gray, pink, or black glazes.

It is incorrectly used as a dietary supplement in animal feed. Due to low bioactivity, negligible copper is absorbed.

It is used when welding with copper alloys.

A copper oxide electrode formed part of the early battery type known as the Edison–Lalande cell. Copper oxide was also used in a lithium battery type (IEC 60086 code &quot;G&quot;).

===Pyrotechnics and fireworks===
Used as moderate blue coloring agent in blue flame compositions with additional chlorine donors and oxidizers such as chlorates and perchlorates. Providing oxygen it can be used as flash powder oxidizer with metal fuels such as magnesium, aluminium, or magnalium powder. Sometimes it is used in strobe effects and thermite compositions as crackling stars effect.

==Similar compounds==
An example of natural copper(I,II) oxide is the mineral paramelaconite, Cu+2Cu2+2O3.

<doc id="1177026" wikidata="Q8052750" url="?curid=1177026" title="Yes I Am (Melissa Etheridge album)">
<text>Yes I Am is the fourth studio album by American singer-songwriter Melissa Etheridge, released by Island Records on September 21, 1993. The pivotal album that gave Etheridge national and international recognition, the rock ballad &quot;Come to My Window&quot; was the first single released from the album, which peaked at No. 25 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and its video featured the actress Juliette Lewis having a nervous breakdown. This single was quickly followed by &quot;I&#x27;m the Only One&quot;, which became a major hit in the US and reached No. 8 on the Hot 100, and &quot;If I Wanted To&quot;, which reached No. 16. By 2010, the album had sold over 4,348,000 copies in the United States alone, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

The title is generally thought to refer to Etheridge&#x27;s recent coming out as a lesbian, confirming long-standing rumors about her personal life. However, in 2018, Etheridge clarified that in fact the title for the track and album were not statements regarding her sexual identity. That same year, she went on tour to celebrate the 25th anniversary of &quot;Yes I Am&quot;&#x27;s release and also re-released the album with eight bonus tracks.

== Recording and production ==
The songs on &quot;Yes I Am&quot; were recorded at A&amp;M Studios in Los Angeles, California. The album was produced by Etheridge and Hugh Padgham, who also engineered the album. Padgham had previously worked mainly with British artists and bands including Genesis, David Bowie and Sting. He also produced Etheridge&#x27;s next album, &quot;Your Little Secret&quot;.

The main musicians backing Etheridge were Kevin McCormick (who had co-produced her previous albums), Mauricio Fritz Lewak, Waddy Wachtel and Scott Thurston. Pino Palladino replaced McCormick on several tracks and David Sutton replaced him on one song. Ian McLagen and James Fearnley also made appearances.

In their review, &quot;Billboard&quot; noted that &quot;working with Etheridge for the first time, veteran producer Padgham has not tampered with the formula that made the rock singer/songwriter&#x27;s first three works album rock standbys. Here, she scores with bluesy lead single &quot;I&#x27;m The Only One&quot; and tracks &quot;If I Only Wanted To,&quot; &quot;Come To My Window,&quot; and &quot;All- American Girl.&quot; 

In their review, &quot;Allmusic&quot; stated that &quot;Melissa Etheridge wasn&#x27;t out of the closet when she released &quot;Yes I Am&quot; in 1993, yet it&#x27;s hard not to notice the defiant acclamation in the album&#x27;s title. This barely concealed sense of sexual identity seeps out from the lyrics, and it informs the music as well, which is perhaps the most confident she has ever been. It&#x27;s also the most professional she&#x27;s ever been.&quot;

<doc id="1177035" wikidata="Q3368598" url="?curid=1177035" title="Pat Spillane">
<text>Patrick Gerard Spillane (born 1 December 1955), better known as Pat Spillane, is an Irish former Gaelic football pundit and player. His league and championship career at senior level with the Kerry county team spanned seventeen years from 1974 to 1991. Spillane is widely regarded as one of the greatest players in the history of the game.

Born in Templenoe, County Kerry, Spillane was born into a strong Gaelic football family. His father, Tom, and his uncle, Jerome, both played with Kerry and won All-Ireland medals in the junior grade. His maternal uncles, Jackie, Dinny, Mickey, and Teddy Lyne, all won All-Ireland medals at various grades with Kerry throughout the 1940s and 1950s.

Spillane played competitive Gaelic football as a boarder at St Brendan&#x27;s College. Here he won back-to-back Corn Uí Mhuirí medals, however, an All-Ireland medal remained elusive. Spillane first appeared for the Templenoe club at underage levels, before winning a county novice championship medal in 1973. With the amalgamated Kenmare District team he won two county senior championship medals in 1974 and 1987. While studying at Thomond College Spillane won an All-Ireland medal in the club championship in 1978. He also won one Munster medal and a county senior championship medal in Limerick.

Spillane made his debut on the inter-county scene at the age of sixteen when he was picked on the Kerry minor team. He enjoyed two championship seasons with the minor team, however, he was a Munster runner-up on both occasions. Spillane subsequently joined the Kerry under-21 team, winning back-to-back All-Ireland medals in 1975 and 1976. By this stage he had also joined the Kerry senior team, making his debut during the 1973–74 league. Over the course of the next seventeen years, Spillane won eight All-Ireland medals, beginning with a lone triumph in 1975, a record-equalling four championships in a row from 1978 to 1981 and three championships in a row from 1984 to 1986. He also won twelve Munster medals, two National Football League medals and was named Footballer of the Year in 1978 and 1986. He played his last game for Kerry in August 1991. Spillane was joined on the Kerry team by his two brothers, Mick and Tom, and together won a total of 19 All-Ireland medals – a record for a set of brothers.

After being chosen on the Munster inter-provincial team for the first time in 1976, Spillane was an automatic choice on the starting fifteen for the following six years. During that time he won four Railway Cup medals.

In retirement from playing Spillane combined his teaching career with a new position as a sports broadcaster. His media career began with RTÉ in 1992, where he started as a co-commentator before progressing to the role of studio analyst with the flagship programme &quot;The Sunday Game&quot;. He also enjoyed a four-year tenure as host of the evening highlights edition of the programme. Spillane also writes a weekly column for the &quot;Sunday World&quot;. On 9 July 2022, he announced that the 2022 All-Ireland Football Final would be his last appearance as a pundit on &quot;The Sunday Game&quot;.

Even during his playing days, Spillane came to be recognised as one of the greatest players of all time. After fighting his way back from a potentially career-ending anterior cruciate ligament injury, he was named in the right wing-forward position on the Football Team of the Century in 1984. Spillane was one of only two players from the modern era to be named on that team. He switched to the left-wing forward position when he was named on the Football Team of the Millennium in 1999. Spillane&#x27;s collection of nine All-Stars is a record for a Gaelic footballer, while his tally of eight All-Ireland medals is also a record which he shares with several other players.

==Biography==
Born in Templenoe, County Kerry, Spillane arrived into a family steeped in Gaelic football history. His father, Tom (1923–1964), played Gaelic football with Kerry and won a Munster title in 1948. A number of maternal uncles (his mother was bred by the Lyne Family of Killarney&#x27;s Legion) also had the distinction of representing their county in football. His mother&#x27;s name was Maura.

When Spillane was an eight-year-old, his father died, leaving his mother to take over the running of the family pub while simultaneously raising a family of four children. Spillane was educated at the local national school and later attended St Brendan&#x27;s College in Killarney, where one of his best friends was future Kerry teammate Páidí Ó Sé. At St Brendan&#x27;s his football skills were developed. He played senior football with &#x27;Brendan&#x27;s&#x27; but lost both an All-Ireland Colleges&#x27; semi-final and a final.

Spillane subsequently attended Thomond College in Limerick where he studied to be a P.E. teacher. He was later joined by his brother Mick at Thomond and they both played on the college football team. In the late 1980s Spillane took over the running of the family pub in Templenoe. He worked as a P.E. and geography teacher at St. Gobán&#x27;s College in Bantry, County Cork, where he became vice-principal and, subsequently, principal of the school in 2011. He also led the school&#x27;s under-16 boys team to two &#x27;Munsters&#x27; in a row in 2005–2006 and 2006–2007; both finals were played on Kerry soil against Limerick opposition. As a result of the Croke Park Agreement, he retired as principal in 2012 to secure his right to a pension but expressed regret at feeling forced to do so. He subsequently chaired CEDRA, the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, an organisation tasked with creating jobs in rural parts of the country until 2025.

Spillane lives in Templenoe with his wife Rosarii, and three children Cara (1990), Shóna (1992), and Pat Jnr (1997). He still helps to train his local teams.

Pat Jnr has played for the Sligo county team since 2022.

Spillane took over his mother&#x27;s bar, renaming it Pat Spillane&#x27;s Bar, and he ran it before leasing it. Spillane&#x27;s footballer brother Tom bought the pub from Pat in the late 2010s, with the intention of running it alongside his sons Killian and Adrian (also Kerry footballers).

==Playing career==

===Club===
Spillane played his club football with the local club in Templenoe. He won a county novice championship with the club in 1973 before collecting a county junior championship winners&#x27; medal in 1975.

Spillane also played club football with Thomond College during his time there in the late 1970s. In 1977 he was captain of the side that defeated Croom to take the Limerick senior championship title. Thomond later represented the county in the provincial club series and even reached the final. A 0–12 to 1–3 defeat of the famous Nemo Rangers club gave Spillane a Munster club winners&#x27; medal. He later led his team out in Croke Park for the All-Ireland final against St. John&#x27;s of Antrim. The Limerick club had no Limerick native on the team, however, victory was secured thanks to goals by Spillane and Sligo&#x27;s Mick Kilcoyne. The 2–14 to 1–3 victory gave Spillane an All-Ireland club winners&#x27; medal.

===Minor &amp; under-21===
By the early 1970s, Spillane had joined the Kerry minor football team, however, he had no success in this grade as Cork dominated the provincial championship. He quickly progressed onto the Kerry under-21 team where he captured a Munster title in 1975 following a nine-point trouncing of Waterford. Spillane&#x27;s side later qualified for the All-Ireland final with Dublin providing the opposition. A 1–15 to 0–10 score line gave Kerry the victory and gave Spillane an All-Ireland winners&#x27; medal.

In 1976 Spillane made it two Munster under-21 titles in a row as Kerry retained their provincial crown at the expense of Cork. He later lined out in a second All-Ireland final. Kildare provided the opposition on that occasion, however, they were no match for Kerry. Spillane collected a second All-Ireland winners&#x27; medal following a 0–14 to 1–3 victory.

===Senior===
Spillane made his senior inter-county debut as a substitute in a National Football League game against Galway in March 1974. He lined out in the drawn National League final that year; however, he did not start the replay which Kerry won. Spillane retained his place as a substitute for Kerry&#x27;s unsuccessful Munster Championship campaign.

In 1975 a new-look Kerry team was formed under the management of former player Mick O&#x27;Dwyer. It was the beginning of a glorious era for Kerry football and Spillane played a key role in orchestrating much of the success for the team that would come to be regarded as the greatest of all time. That year he won his first senior Munster title, dethroning Cork as provincial champions in the process. Spillane later lined out in his first senior All-Ireland final. Reigning champions Dublin provided the opposition and were installed as the red-hot favourites over the youngest Kerry team of all time. On a rain-soaked day John Egan and substitute Ger O&#x27;Driscoll scored two goals and &#x27;the Dubs&#x27; were ambushed by 2–12 to 0–11. It was Spillane&#x27;s first All-Ireland winners&#x27; medal at senior level. Because team captain Mickey &#x27;Ned&#x27; O&#x27;Sullivan had left injured in the first half, Spillane, at the age of nineteen, was given the task of accepting the Sam Maguire Cup on the Hogan Stand.

In 1976 Spillane captured his second Munster title before later lining out in his second All-Ireland final. Once again it was Dublin who provided the opposition. Both sides were hoping for success, however, new &#x27;Dub&#x27; Kevin Moran was causing havoc with the Kerry defence. Jimmy Keaveney converted a penalty to help Dublin to a 3–8 to 0–10 victory and defeat for Spillane.

1977 proved to be another frustrating year. The year began with Spillane capturing a first National League medal on the field of play and a third consecutive Munster title following another win over Cork. Kerry later took on Dublin for the third consecutive year, however, this time it was in the All-Ireland semi-final. In one of the greatest games of football ever-played &#x27;the Dubs&#x27; triumphed and Spillane was still left waiting for a second All-Ireland medal.

In 1978 Kerry faced little competition in the provincial championship once again. A defeat of Cork gave Spillane a fourth Munster winners&#x27; medal in a row. Kerry later qualified for a third All-Ireland final in four years. Old rivals Dublin provided the opposition, however, the game turned into a rout. The game is chiefly remembered for Mikey Sheehy&#x27;s sensational goal. The Kerry forward lobbed the ball over the head of Paddy Cullen, who was caught off his line arguing with the referee. New full-forward Eoin Liston scored a hat-trick of goals. Spillane played all over the field, including goalkeeper after Charlie Nelligan was sent off. At the full-time whistle, Kerry were the winners by 5–11 to 0–9.

In 1979 Kerry made it five-in-a-row in Munster as Cork fell by ten points in the provincial final. Spillane later went in search of a third All-Ireland medal as he lined out in a fourth championship decider. Dublin provided the opposition for the fifth consecutive occasion. Kerry were handicapped throughout the game. Ger Power did not start the game, while John O&#x27;Keeffe got injured and Páidí Ó Sé was sent off during the encounter. Two goals by Mikey Sheehy and a third by John Egan helped &#x27;the Kingdom&#x27; to a 3–13 to 1–8 victory. It was Spillane&#x27;s third All-Ireland winners&#x27; medal.

Kerry&#x27;s dominance continued in 1980. Another defeat of Cork in the provincial final gave Spillane a sixth Munster winners&#x27; medal in succession. Another All-Ireland final appearance beckoned, this time with Roscommon providing the opposition. The Connacht champions shocked Kerry and took a five-point lead inside the first twelve minutes. Mikey Sheehy popped up again to score the decisive goal, as Kerry went on to claim a 1–9 to 1–6 victory in a game that contained sixty-four frees. The victory gave Kerry a third All-Ireland title in succession, while Spillane added a fourth All-Ireland winners&#x27; medal to his ever-growing collection. Kerry had succeeded in winning 3 in a row.

In 1981 Spillane won his seventh consecutive Munster title; however, he later damaged his knee in a club game in August of that year. His movement was severely hampered but he was still selected as a substitute for the All-Ireland final against Offaly. Spillane was brought on with only a few minutes left in the match and he captured his fifth All-Ireland winners&#x27; medal on the field of play as Kerry won by 1–12 to 0–8.

Spillane played sporadically for Kerry in 1982 as the team attempted to capture an unprecedented fifth All-Ireland medal in a row. He played no part in Kerry&#x27;s eighth consecutive Munster final victory over Cork, however, he did return for a second consecutive All-Ireland final against Offaly. Kerry had the upper hand for much of the game and were leading by two points with two minutes left to be played. The game, however, was not over as Offaly substitute Séamus Darby, who had entered the game almost unnoticed, produced the most spectacular of finishes by scoring a late goal. Kerry failed to score again to level the match and Offaly went on to win their third All-Ireland title ever. Kerry&#x27;s five-in-a-row dream was shattered.

Spillane played no part in the 1983 championship as he was recovering from an operation on his snapped cruciate ligament. While many players would never play again following such an injury Spillane fought his way back to fitness in time to win his second National League medal and his eighth Munster title in 1984. The centenary-year All-Ireland final pitted Kerry against old rivals and reigning champions Dublin. &#x27;The Kingdom&#x27; dominated the game from start to finish. Only two Dublin forwards scored as Kerry ran out easy winners by 0–14 to 1–6. It was Spillane&#x27;s sixth All-Ireland winners&#x27; medal.

Kerry made no mistake again in 1985. A two-goal victory over Cork gave Spillane a ninth Munster winners&#x27; medal. Another All-Ireland final beckoned, with Dublin providing the opposition for a second consecutive year. Jack O&#x27;Shea scored a key goal after eleven minutes and Kerry stormed to a nine-point lead at half-time. &#x27;The Dubs&#x27; came storming back with Joe McNally scoring two goals. The gap could not be bridged and Kerry won by 2–1 to 2–8. The victory gave Spillane a record-equalling seventh All-Ireland winners&#x27; medal.

In 1986 Kerry&#x27;s dominance showed no sign of disappearing. Cork fell again in the provincial final, giving Spillane an 11th Munster title. A tenth All-Ireland final appearance quickly followed and it turned out to be an historic occasion. Tyrone provided the opposition in their first-ever championship decider. A Peter Quinn goal gave the Ulster men a six-point lead in the second half, however, the game was far from over. Spillane ran fifty yards up the field for a hand-passed goal to get Kerry back on track. Mikey Sheehy scored a second goal to give &#x27;the Kingdom&#x27; a 2–15 to 1–10 victory. Spillane was named man of the match as he collected a third All-Ireland medal in a row. It was his eighth All-Ireland medal overall, a record haul of All-Ireland medals and a record that he shares with several other players. For the last trio of All-Ireland victories Spillane was joined by his two brothers, Mick and Tom, on the Kerry team.

The glory days were now over for Kerry as Cork captured the next four Munster titles. Spillane continued to play with Kerry, winning his 12th Munster title in 1991. Kerry were subsequently defeated by eventual champions Down in the All-Ireland semi-final and Spillane decided to retire from inter-county football.

===Inter-provincial===
Spillane also lined out with Munster in the inter-provincial football competition and enjoyed much success. He first lined out with his province in 1976 as Munster defeated Leinster by 2–15 to 2–8. It was his first Railway Cup winners&#x27; medal and the first of three-in-a-row for Spillane and for Munster. After losing out in 1979 and 1980 Spillane captured a fourth and final Railway Cup title in 1981.

===International===
Spillane&#x27;s career also included four appearances with Ireland in the International Rules series. He scored a point in the opening game against Australia in 1986. Ireland went on to win the series 2–1. Spillane was back on the team again in 1987. This time he lined out in all three games of the series. He scored ten points in the final game at Croke Park; however, Australia were victorious on that occasion.

==Records==
Spillane made and broke a number of records during his football career. In 1986 Spillane and his three Kerry teammates broke Danno O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s long-standing record by capturing an unprecedented eighth All-Ireland winners&#x27; medal. His inter-county football career, which spanned three decades, saw him earn a record nine All-Star awards, more than any other player in the history of the game. Spillane shares this record of nine All-Star wins with Kilkenny hurlers Henry Shefflin, D.J. Carey, Tommy Walsh and Eddie Keher (although Keher&#x27;s record is made up of 5 All-Stars and 4 Cú Chulainn Awards). His All-Star accolades were presented as part of a six-in-a-row from 1976 until 1981 and a three-in-a-row from 1984 until 1986. Spillane is also one of only a handful of players to have won senior Munster winners&#x27; medals in each of three separate decades.

Spillane was presented with the Texaco Footballer of the Year award on two occasions, the first in 1978 and the second in 1984. His second win was all the more remarkable considering he had battled back from a career-threatening injury. Also in 1984, the GAA&#x27;s centenary year, Spillane was singled out as one of the greatest players of all-time when he was chosen in the left wing-forward position on the Football Team of the Century. He retained this position on the Football Team of the Millennium in 1999.

The three Spillane brothers – Pat, Tom and Mick – hold the record number of All-Ireland senior winners&#x27; medals in either hurling or football with nineteen. Including medals won as non-playing substitutes Pat won eight, Mick won seven and Tom won four.

==Media career==
Spillane has been described as &quot;one of the first trailblazers in the field of product endorsement&quot; within Gaelic games, featuring in print advertisements for cattle feed Tend-R-Leen, in which he said: &quot;For my money there&#x27;s no better substitute for Tend-R-Leen&quot;.

Following retirement from Gaelic football, Spillane developed a career in the media. He joined &quot;The Sunday Game&quot; team as a co-commentator in 1992 before later working as a studio analyst.

For a brief time Spillane presented &quot;The Sunday Game&quot; highlights programme during the summer months until 2009.

As an analyst of games, Spillane has often expressed his disdain for Ulster football teams, particularly those of Armagh, Tyrone and, latterly, Donegal. In 2003, he described Armagh&#x27;s and Tyrone&#x27;s style of defence as &quot;puke football&quot;. This led him to another appearance on &quot;Reeling in the Years&quot;, following on from most of the 1970s and 1980s. Latterly, Spillane has mocked Tyrone&#x27;s GPS trackers, referring to the devices as &quot;bras.&quot;

In 2011, Spillane aired his views of the Donegal senior football team, he branded their style of play &quot;Shite football&quot;. After Donegal&#x27;s Ulster Senior Football Championship defeat of Antrim in May 2011, Spillane was critical on &quot;The Sunday Game&quot; of Ryan Bradley, scorer of two points in his first Ulster start, being in receipt of the man-of-the-match award. Spillane said Bradley was &quot;the best of a bad bunch&quot; and didn&#x27;t deserve the award at all, causing Donegal manager Jim McGuinness to react furiously. McGuinness called Spillane&#x27;s comments &quot;way over the top&quot;.

Spillane also has a weekly column in the &quot;Sunday World&quot; newspaper.

Spillane has appeared as himself in an episode of the Irish soap opera &quot;Fair City&quot;.

On 9 July 2022, Spillane announced his retirement as a pundit on &quot;The Sunday Game&quot; after three decades and that the 2022 All-Ireland Football Final would be his last appearance. He appeared as a guest on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; at the earliest available opportunity on 2 September to speak about this.

<text>Frederick William Frohawk (16 July 1861 – 10 December 1946) was an English zoological artist and lepidopterist.

Frohawk was the author of &quot;Natural History of British Butterflies&quot; (1914), &quot;The Complete Book of British Butterflies&quot; (1934) and &quot;Varieties of British Butterflies&quot; (1938).

Frohawk was born at Brisley Hall, East Dereham, Norfolk, the son of a yeoman farmer Francis Frohawk and his wife, Lydia Drage. The youngest child in his family, his interest in drawing and natural history was nurtured by his mother. At seven he spotted and caught a rare pale clouded yellow butterfly. The family moved to Great Yarmouth and later Ipswich where he found many interesting butterflies. After the death of his father around 1873, the family moved to Croydon and later South Norwood. He went to school at Norwood College and during this time contracted typhoid leading to near blindness in one eye. In 1880 the family moved to Upper Norwood and here Frohawk concentrated on illustration and obtained his first commission for illustrating &quot;The Field&quot;. Frohawk was encouraged in his work by Lord Walter Rothschild, who later bought his water-colours of butterflies.

His major butterfly works include the two volume &quot;Natural History of British Butterflies&quot; (1924) and &quot;The Complete Book of British Butterflies&quot; (1934). In 1927, a need for money forced him to sell his butterfly collection to Lord Rothschild for £1000. These are now part of the Rothschild collection in the Natural History Museum at London. He also illustrated numerous bird books, including &quot;Aves Hawaiienses: The Birds of the Sandwich Islands&quot;; and &quot;Birds of the British Isles and their Eggs&quot; with A G Butler, published around 1898.

He married Margaret Grant in June 1895 and spent the honeymoon in the New Forest. Margaret died on 16 February 1909 leaving him to care for two daughters. In 1911 he married Mabel Jane Bowman on 4 October at St James, Westminster and they had a third daughter Valezina, named after a form of the silver-washed fritillary. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Entomological Society in 1891 and made a Special Life Fellow in 1926. He died on 10 December 1946 and was buried at Headley, Surrey.

His sister Lydia was married to the equine artist Lynwood Palmer.

In 1996, his daughter Valezina, former wife of Vernon Henry St John, 6th Viscount Bolingbroke, inaugurated a commemorative sign marking the &quot;Frohawk Ride&quot; in the New Forest.

<doc id="1177048" wikidata="Q2078126" url="?curid=1177048" title="Abbeydorney">
<text>Abbeydorney () is a village in County Kerry, Ireland. Located north of the county town of Tralee, the village had a population of 418 as of the 2016 census of Ireland. Abbeydorney falls within the civil parish of O&#x27;Dorney, and is sometimes colloquially called by that name.

== History until 1900 ==
Bivallate and Multivallate ringforts in North Kerry and nearby abbeydorney show that the area has been settled since the Bronze Age.

=== Abbey ===
The name of the village derives from the translation of the Irish Mainistir Ó dTorna – in English O&#x27;Dorney Abbey – which was the Cistercian Order Abbeydorney Abbey, established in 1154 and located north of the village. The abbey is often called Kyrie Eleison (which is Greek for &quot;Lord, have mercy&quot;). It was suppressed in 1537 during the reign of King Henry VIII of England.

===Village===

The village that developed around the abbey is of an agrarian nature and the institutions that have developed reflect this. In 1885, Abbeydorney GAA club was established, and in 1895 Abbeydorney Co-operative Dairy Society was formed. A courthouse for petty sessions was held fortnightly in Abbeydorney. The courthouse closed in 1919.

== History from 1900 ==
People from the village were involved in the Irish War of Independence and the Irish Civil War. Many also joined the Irish Volunteers.

=== War of Independence ===

Abbeydorney was home to RIC barracks, which changed location at-least twice since the force was set up in the village. 

On October 12, 1920, lorries of armed RIC men evacuated, robbed and torched the Abbeydorney Co-Operative Creamery. The manager of the creamery, Tim O&#x27;Donovan received a blow to the back of the head by a constable&#x27;s rifle when he refused to give up the key to his safe.

On October 18, 1920 O&#x27;Donovan&#x27;s house and that of his engine man, Patrick Tuomey was set alight by RIC constables in retalliation.

On November 25th, 1920 the burning of the creamery was brought up in the House of Commons, where Chief Secretary, Sir Hamar Greenwood said that, according to a report, the creamery was burned on October 12th but they did not know who had committed the destruction.

On October 31st, 1920 an RIC constable was shot dead in the village and another was seriously injured. The next day, people leaving mass were held up and searched. Most of the younger men had fled the village out of fear of being caught. That night, RIC Constables left the barracks with barrels of petrol. All roads to the village had been cordoned off. The houses of several people in the village were burned:

* Eugene Moriarty, blacksmith
* Mrs Peggy Joe Lovett, publican
* John Lynn, building contractor
* Mike Whelan, shopkeeper
* Willie O&#x27;Rahilly, insurance agent
* Mrs. Griffin, music teacher (pleaded with raiders to allow her to preserve her furniture)
* Jeremiah O&#x27;Donovan, carpenter
* Mrs. Kearney had a hayshed on her farm burned down.

Many of these houses were rebuilt after the burning with financial aid from the American Committee for Relief in Ireland which was distributed by the Irish White Cross.

== Amenities ==
As of December 2023, Abbeydorney is home to a School, A Community Centre, two restaurants, a gym, a GAA Complex that also contains a pub, and a play-park. The village is also home to a doctor&#x27;s practice and a physiotherapy clinic.
=== Church ===

St. Bernard&#x27;s Church, a modern ecclesiastical catholic church lies on the Bridge Road, next to the River Brick. It is built on the site of a former church which was demolished in 1966.

==Transport==
Abbeydorney railway station serving the village opened on 20 December 1880 on the line from Tralee to Limerick via Listowel. Passenger services were withdrawn on 4 February 1963, although the route through Abbeydorney continued to be used by freight trains for a while before the line to Listowel was finally closed altogether in 1977 and then to Tralee 1978. The station closed on 6 February 1978.

==Sport==
=== Hurling ===
The local Abbeydorney hurling team have won five County Championships, the last in 2024, and in more recent times their minor teams have won the minor county championship in 1999 and again in 2008. Abbeydorney GAA is also one of the oldest teams in Kerry. It was founded in 1885

In 2024, Abbeydorney Hurling Team beat Ballyduff in the county final, qualifying to play Brickey Rangers GAA from Waterford in the AIB Munster Club Intermediate Hurling Championship Quarter-Final. They won this match by a point, but would lose their next match against Cashel King Cormacs from Tipperary

=== Ladies Football ===
The Abbeydorney Ladies Football Club was the feeding ground for the great Kerry Ladies teams of the 1980s and 1990s. In more recent years they secured back-to-back All-Irelands. They won the Junior All-Ireland Club title in 2004 and followed that a year later in 2005 by winning the All-Ireland Intermediate Club title.

=== Camogie ===
Abbeydorney is home to an up-and-coming camogie team named Abbeykillix, serving the villages of Abbeydorney, Kilflynn and Lixnaw.

==Common surnames==
According to Irish census of 1901 and 1911, common names in the area at the time included: Sullivan, Connor, Stack, Walsh, Shanahan, Buckley, Fitzgerald, Lawlor, Dowling, Glavin, McCarthy, Slattery, Brosnan, Hayes, Lynch, Moriarty, O&#x27;Connor, O&#x27;Leary, Lovett, Mahony, Maunsell, Murphy, Brennan, Cronin, Nolan, Sheehan, and Sheehy.

<text>The lira (; sign: [[Turkish lira sign|₺]]; ISO 4217 code: TRY; abbreviation: TL) is the official currency of Turkey Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and Northern Syria. One lira is divided into one hundred &quot;kuruş&quot;.

==History==

===Ottoman lira (1844–1923)===
The lira, along with the related currencies of Europe and the Middle East, has its roots in the ancient Roman unit of weight known as the libra which referred to the Troy pound of silver. The Roman libra adoption of the currency spread it throughout Europe and the Near East, where it continued to be used into medieval times. The Turkish lira, the French livre (until 1794), the Italian lira (until 2002), Lebanese pound and the pound unit of account in sterling (a translation of the Latin &quot;libra&quot;; the word &quot;pound&quot; as a unit of weight is still abbreviated as &quot;lb.&quot;) are the modern descendants of the ancient currency.

The lira was introduced as the main unit of account in 1844, with the former currency, kuruş, remaining as a subdivision. The Ottoman lira remained in circulation until the end of 1927.

===First Turkish lira (1923–2005)===

The banknotes of the first and second issue depict &quot;Mustafa Kemal Atatürk&quot; on the obverse side. This change was done according to the 12 January 1926 issue of the official gazette. After Atatürk&#x27;s death, his portrait was replaced with one of İsmet İnönü for the third and fourth issues. Atatürk returned for the fifth issue and all subsequent issues.

After periods of the lira pegged to sterling and the franc, a peg of TL 2.8 = US$1 was adopted in 1946 and maintained until 1960, when the currency was devalued to TL 9 = US$1. From 1970, a series of hard, then soft pegs to the dollar operated as the value of the Turkish lira began to fall.

The following are based on yearly averages:

* 1960s: US$1 = TL 9
* 1970: US$1 = TL 11.30
* 1975: US$1 = TL 14.40
* 1980: US$1 = TL 80
* 1985: US$1 = TL 500
* 1990: US$1 = TL 2,500
* 1995: US$1 = TL 43,000
* 2000: US$1 = TL 620,000
* 2001: US$1 = TL 1,250,000
* 2005: US$1 = TL 1,350,000

The &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; ranked the Turkish lira as the world&#x27;s least valuable currency in 1995 and 1996, and again from 1999 to 2004. The lira&#x27;s value had fallen so far that one original gold lira coin could be sold for TL 154,400,000 before the 2005 revaluation.

===Second Turkish lira (2005–present)===


28 January 2004, the Grand National Assembly of Turkey passed a law that allowed for redenomination by the removal of six zeros from the Turkish lira, and the creation of a new currency. It was introduced on 1 January 2005, replacing the previous Turkish lira (which remained valid in circulation until the end of 2005) at a rate of YTL 1 (ISO 4217 code &quot;TRY&quot;) = TL 1,000,000 in old lira (ISO 4217 code &quot;TRL&quot;). With the revaluation of the Turkish lira, the Romanian leu (also revalued in July 2005) briefly became the world&#x27;s least valued currency unit. At the same time, the Government introduced two new banknotes with the denominations of ₺50 and ₺100.

In the transition period between January 2005 and December 2008, the second Turkish lira was officially called &quot;Yeni Türk lirası&quot; (&quot;New Turkish lira&quot;). The letter &quot;Y&quot; in the currency code was taken from the Turkish word , meaning &quot;new&quot;. It was officially abbreviated &quot;YTL&quot; and subdivided into 100 new (). Starting in January 2009, the &quot;new&quot; marking was removed from the second Turkish lira, its official name becoming just &quot;Turkish lira&quot; again, abbreviated &quot;TL&quot;. All obverse sides of current banknotes have portraits of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. The reverse sides of all coins (except for ₺1 commemorative coins) have portraits of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. Since 2012, 9 different ₺1 circulating commemorative coins were introduced.

=== 2018–present currency crisis ===
In 2018, the lira&#x27;s exchange rate deteriorated rapidly, reaching ₺4.5 per US dollar by mid-May and ₺4.9 a week later. Economists generally attributed the accelerating loss of value to Recep Tayyip Erdoğan preventing the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey from making necessary interest rate adjustments. Erdoğan, who claimed interest rates beyond his control to be &quot;the mother and father of all evil&quot;, stated that &quot;the central bank can&#x27;t take this independence and set aside the signals given by the president.&quot; Despite Erdoğan&#x27;s apparent opposition, Turkey&#x27;s Central Bank raised interest rates sharply.

As of 2020, the Turkish lira continued to plummet in value, with the currency going through a process of depreciation, consistently reaching all-time lows. The Turkish lira deflated by over 400% compared to the US dollar and the euro since 2008, largely due to Erdoğan&#x27;s expansionist foreign policy. Erdoğan has tried to fix the financial crisis with unorthodox banking methods.

The Turkish lira partially recovered in early 2021 with the government&#x27;s increase in interest rates. However, the currency began to crash due to inflation and depreciation starting on 21 March 2021, after the sacking of Central Bank chief Naci Ağbal. The Turkish lira reached a then-all-time-low of ₺8.8 to the dollar on 4 June. The Turkish lira became one of the quickest collapsing currencies of 2021. The Turkish lira reached a new low of ₺8.9 to the dollar in September 2021. In late 2021, the Turkish lira began collapsing rapidly, with the exchange rate falling 9% against the US dollar, reaching an all-time low of ₺12.5 to the dollar. The Turkish lira continued to collapse in December, with the inflation rate reaching unseen levels, collapsing to ₺14.5 to the US Dollar, losing nearly all of its original value. On 17 December, the lira fell by 8.5%, raising the exchange rate to ₺16.5 to the US dollar. Despite the currency collapse, Erdoğan lowered interest rates down to 14% from 15%, causing the lira to lose half of its value since the start of 2021. The Turkish Lira continued to decline throughout 2022. The central bank governor Şahap Kavcıoğlu lowered interest rates by 150 basis points, from 12% to 10.5%, down from the 2021 low of 15%. The official inflation rate of the Lira through 2022 reached 83%, but independent reviews of the Turkish lira put the inflation rate even higher. 

In 2023, Erdoğan began to follow orthodox banking methods. Under the guidance of Mehmet Şimşek and Hafize Gaye Erkan, the central bank began to rapidly increase interest rates. By the end of the year, the interest rate stood at 42.5%, and the annual inflation rate decreased to 53.86%, down from 83% in 2022. The central bank increased the interest rate to 50% in March 2024 under Fatih Karahan, the new governor, and has kept it as such as for eight consecutive months. This has resulted in the lira gaining value since May, when inflation peaked at 75.45%, but has decreased to 47.09% in November. Many investors have regained trust in the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey.

==Coins==
From 1 January 2009, the prefix &quot;new&quot; was removed from the second Turkish lira, its official name in Turkey becoming &quot;Turkish lira&quot; again; new coins without the word &quot;yeni&quot; were introduced in denominations of 1kr., 5kr., 10kr., 25kr., 50kr. and ₺1. Also, the center and ring alloys of the 50kr. and ₺1 coins were reversed.

===Circulating commemorative coins===
Since 2012, the Turkish State Mint has introduced nine commemorative coins in circulation.

* 2018: Commemoration of inauguration ceremony of the President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan
* 2020: 100th anniversary of Grand National Assembly of Turkey
* 2022: Commemoration of the opening ceremony of 1915 Çanakkale Bridge
* 2022: 100th anniversary of the Great Offensive
* 2023: 100th years of the republic (5 lira)

==Banknotes==
A new series of banknotes, the &quot;E-9 Emission Group&quot; entered circulation on 1 January 2009, with the E-8 group ceasing to be valid after 31 December 2009 (although still redeemable at branches of the Central Bank until 31 December 2019). The E-9 banknotes refer to the currency as &quot;Turkish lira&quot; rather than &quot;new Turkish lira&quot; and include a new ₺200 denomination. The new banknotes have different sizes to prevent forgery. The main specificity of this new series is that each denomination depicts a famous Turkish personality, rather than geographical sites and architectural features of Turkey. The dominant color of the 5-Turkish-lira banknote has been determined as &quot;purple&quot; on the second series of the current banknotes.

==Currency sign==

The lira was originally symbolised as TL, inverting the characters of the Ottoman lira&#x27;s sign, LT, which stood for &quot;&quot; in French. Historically English language sources used &quot;£T&quot; or &quot;T£&quot; for the currency, but it is unknown whether this notation was ever used within Turkey.

The current currency sign of Turkish lira was created by the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey in 2012. The new sign was selected after a country-wide contest. The new symbol is composed of the letter &quot;L&quot; shaped like a half anchor, and embedded double-striped letter &quot;T&quot; angled at 20 degrees.

The design, created by Tülay Lale, was endorsed after a country-wide competition. It was chosen as the winner from a shortlist of seven submissions to the board of the Central Bank, selected from a total of 8,362 entries. The symbol resembles the first letter of the Turkish monetary unit, &quot;L&quot;, in the form of a half anchor with double stroke.

Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan announced the new symbol on 1 March 2012. At its unveiling, Erdoğan explained the design as &quot;the anchor shape hopes to convey that the currency is a &#x27;safe harbour&#x27; while the upward-facing lines represent its rising prestige&quot;.

Faik Öztrak, vice chairman of the main opposition party CHP, alleged that the new sign resembles the initials &quot;TE&quot; of then-prime minister Tayyip Erdoğan in a reference to the tughra of Ottoman sultans. The new Turkish lira sign was also criticized for allegedly showing a similarity with an upside-down Armenian dram sign.

In May 2012, the Unicode Technical Committee accepted the encoding of a new character for the currency sign, which was included in Unicode 6.2 released in September 2012. On Microsoft Windows operating systems, when using Turkish-Q or Turkish-F keyboard layouts, it can be typed with the combination .

<text>Lilliput was a small-format British monthly magazine of humour, short stories, photographs and the arts, founded in 1937 by the photojournalist Stefan Lorant. The first issue came out in July and it was sold shortly after to Edward Hulton, when editorship was taken over by Tom Hopkinson in 1940: his assistant editor from 1941 to 1948 was Kaye Webb. During the 1950s &quot;Lilliput&quot; was edited by Jack Hargreaves. It had a reputation for publishing what were, for the time, fairly daring photographs of female nudes.

Contributors included H. E. Bates, Gordon Beckles, Sir Max Beerbohm, James Boswell, Nigel Balchin (author), Bill Brandt, Brassaï, Patrick Campbell, Barbara Comyns, C.E.M. Joad, Aleister Crowley, Robert Doisneau, Dominick Elwes, Ronald Ferns, C. S. Forester, John Glashan, Zoltán Glass, Sydney Jacobson, Robert Graves, Michael Heath, Constant Lambert, Ergy Landau, Nancy Mitford, Stephen Potter, V. S. Pritchett, E. Arnot Robertson, Murray Sayle, Ronald Searle, Sir Sacheverell Sitwell, and Ylla. 

The first 147 issues (until late 1949) had covers illustrated by Walter Trier with each design depicting a man, a woman, and a small Scottish Terrier dog in various situations and periods.

In August 1960 &quot;Lilliput&quot; was absorbed into &quot;Men Only&quot; (which only later became pornographic).

&quot;Lilliput Review&quot;, an American periodical that started in 1989, is unrelated.

<text>Michael Sheehy (born 28 July 1954) is an Irish Gaelic football selector and former player. His league and championship career at senior level with the Kerry county team spanned fifteen seasons from 1973 to 1988.

Born in Tralee, County Kerry, Sheehy&#x27;s father, Jim Sheehy, had played with the Laune Rangers club in his youth. Sheehy first played competitive Gaelic football during his schooling at Tralee CBS. He first appeared for the Austin Stacks club at underage levels, before winning an All-Ireland medal with the senior team in 1977. Sheehy also won one Munster medal and five county club championship medals.

Sheehy made his debut on the inter-county scene at the age of sixteen when he was picked on the Kerry minor team. He played two championship seasons with the minors, and was a Munster Minor Football Championship runner-up on both occasions. Sheehy subsequently joined the Kerry under-21 team, winning two All-Ireland Under-21 Football Championship medals in 1973 and 1975. By this stage he had also joined the Kerry senior team, making his debut during the 1973-74 league. Over the course of the next fifteen seasons, Sheehy won eight All-Ireland SFC medals, beginning in 1975, followed by a record-equalling four championships in a row from 1978 to 1981 and three championships in a row from 1984 to 1986. He also won eleven Munster SFC medals, three National Football League medals and was named Footballer of the Year in 1979. He played his last game for Kerry in July 1987.

After being chosen on the Munster inter-provincial team for the first time in 1976, Sheehy was an automatic choice on the starting fifteen for the following seven years. During that time he won five Railway Cup medals.

In retirement from playing, Sheehy became involved in team management and coaching. In 2012 he was appointed as a selector with the Kerry senior team. Since then he has helped steer the team to one All-Ireland title and four successive Munster titles.

Sheehy was named in the right corner-forward position on the Football Team of the Century in 1984. Sheehy was one of only two players from the modern era to be named on that team, and was also included (also in the right corner-forward position) on the Football Team of the Millennium in 1999. Sheehy also won seven All-Stars, while his tally of eight All-Ireland medals, albeit one as a non-playing substitute, is also a record which he shares with fellow Kerry players Páidí Ó Sé, Pat Spillane and Denis &quot;Ógie&quot; Moran. His scoring tally of 29-205 was a record which stood for 25 years.

==Playing career==

===Club===
Sheehy played his club football with the local club, Austin Stacks, in Tralee. He won his first county senior championship title with the club in 1973, following a defeat of West Kerry. A second county winners&#x27; medal followed two years later, in 1975, following a win over Mid Kerry. Austin Stacks retained their title in 1976 before later representing the county in the provincial club series, and even reaching the final. A narrow 1–7 to 0–8 defeat of St Finbarr&#x27;s gave Sheehy a Munster club winners&#x27; medal. He later lined out at Croke Park for the All-Ireland final against Ballerin of Derry. The Ulster champions took an early lead, courtesy of two first-half goals. Sheehy, however, scored two late points, one from an acute line-ball and one from a 45-metre free, giving Austin Stacks a 1–13 to 2–7 win, and Sheehy an All-Ireland club winners&#x27; medal.

===Minor and under-21===
By the early 1970s, Sheehy had joined the Kerry minor football team; however, he had no success in this grade, as Cork dominated the provincial championship. He quickly progressed onto the Kerry under-21 team, where he captured a Munster Under-21 Football Championship title in 1973, following a one-goal defeat of Cork. Sheehy&#x27;s side later qualified for the All-Ireland final with Mayo providing the opposition. A 2–13 to 0–13 score line gave Kerry the victory, and gave Sheehy an All-Ireland Under-21 Football Championship winners&#x27; medal.

Two years later, in 1975, Sheehy secured a second Munster title, following a nine-point trouncing of Waterford. Kerry later qualified for the All-Ireland final with Dublin providing the opposition. A 1–15 to 0–10 score line gave Kerry the victory, and gave Sheehy a second All-Ireland under-21 winners&#x27; medal.

===Senior===
Sheehy made his senior inter-county debut for Kerry in the 1973–1974 National Football League campaign. Kerry reached the final of the competition and recorded a victory, following a replay, over Roscommon. Sheehy retained his place as a substitute for Kerry&#x27;s unsuccessful Munster Senior Football Championship campaign.

In 1975 a new-look Kerry team was formed under the management of former player Mick O&#x27;Dwyer. That year Sheehy won his first senior Munster title, dethroning Cork as provincial champions in the process. Sheehy later lined out in his first senior All-Ireland SFC final. Reigning champions Dublin provided the opposition, and were installed as the favourites over the youngest Kerry team of all time. On a rain-soaked day, John Egan and substitute Ger O&#x27;Driscoll scored two goals, and Dublin were beaten by 2–12 to 0–11. It was Sheehy&#x27;s first All-Ireland SFC winners&#x27; medal.

In 1976 Sheehy captured his second Munster title, before later lining out in his second All-Ireland final. Once again it was Dublin who provided the opposition. Jimmy Keaveney converted a penalty to help Dublin to a 3–8 to 0–10 victory.

1977 began with Sheehy winning a second National League medal on the field of play, and a third consecutive Munster title following another win over Cork. Kerry later took on Dublin for the third consecutive year; however, this time it was in the All-Ireland semi-final. Dublin won the game, and Sheehy was still left waiting for a second All-Ireland medal.

In 1978, Kerry faced little competition in the provincial championship once again. A defeat of Cork gave Sheehy a fourth Munster winners&#x27; medal in a row. Kerry later qualified for a third All-Ireland final in four years. Old rivals Dublin provided the opposition. The game is chiefly remembered for Sheehy&#x27;s sensational goal. The Kerry forward lobbed the ball over the head of Paddy Cullen, who was caught off his line arguing with the referee, Seamus Aldridge. At the full-time whistle, Kerry were the winners by 5–11 to 0–9.

In 1979, Kerry made it five-in-a-row in Munster, as Cork fell by ten points in the provincial final. Sheehy later went in search of a third All-Ireland medal as he lined out in a fourth championship decider. Dublin provided the opposition for the fifth consecutive occasion. Two goals by Sheehy, and a third by John Egan, helped the &#x27;Kingdom&#x27; to a 3–13 to 1–8 victory. It was Sheehy&#x27;s third All-Ireland winners&#x27; medal.

Kerry&#x27;s dominance continued in 1980. Another defeat of Cork in the provincial final gave Sheehy a sixth Munster winners&#x27; medal in succession. Another All-Ireland final appearance beckoned, this time with Roscommon providing the opposition. The Connacht champions shocked Kerry, and took a five-point lead inside the first twelve minutes. Sheehy popped up again to score a decisive goal, as Kerry went on to claim a 1–9 to 1–6 victory in a game that contained sixty-four frees. The victory gave Kerry a third All-Ireland title in succession, while Sheehy added a fourth All-Ireland winners&#x27; medal to his collection.

In 1981, Sheehy won his seventh consecutive Munster title, before lining out in a fourth consecutive All-Ireland final against Offaly. He secured his fifth All-Ireland SFC winners&#x27; medal that day, with Kerry winning by a score of 1–12 to 0–8.

In 1982, Sheehy secured an eighth consecutive Munster final victory over Cork, and Kerry&#x27;s record-breaking All-Ireland SFC five-in-a-row bid remained intact. The championship decider pitted the &#x27;Kingdom&#x27; against Offaly for the second year in a row. Kerry had the upper hand for much of the game, and were leading by two points with two minutes left to be played. The game, however, was not over as Offaly substitute Séamus Darby, who had entered the game almost unnoticed, scored a late goal. Kerry failed to score again to level the match, and Offaly went on to win their third All-Ireland title ever. Kerry&#x27;s five-in-a-row dream was shattered.

Kerry missed out on a historic nine-in-a-row in Munster in 1983, as Cork won at last. &#x27;The Kingdom&#x27; recovered the following year, with Sheehy winning his third National League medal and his ninth Munster title. The centenary-year All-Ireland final pitted Kerry against old rivals, and reigning champions, Dublin. &#x27;The Kingdom&#x27; dominated the game from start to finish. Only two Dublin forwards scored as Kerry ran out easy winners on a score line 0–14 to 1–6. It was Sheehy&#x27;s sixth All-Ireland winners&#x27; medal.

In 1985, a two-goal victory over Cork gave Sheehy a tenth Munster winners&#x27; medal. Another All-Ireland final beckoned, with Dublin providing the opposition for a second consecutive year. Kerry won by 2–1 to 2–8. The victory gave Sheehy a record-equalling seventh All-Ireland winners&#x27; medal.

In 1986 Cork fell again in the provincial final, giving Sheehy an eleventh Munster title. A tenth All-Ireland final appearance followed, and Tyrone provided the opposition in their first-ever Championship decider. Sheehy scored a second goal to give the &#x27;Kingdom&#x27; a 2–15 to 1–10 victory. The victory gave Sheehy a third All-Ireland medal in-a-row. It was his eighth All-Ireland SFC winners&#x27; medal overall, a record haul of championship medals and a record that he shared with fellow Kerrymen Páidí Ó Sé, Ger Power, Ogie Moran and Pat Spillane.

Cork won the Munster title following a replay in 1987. In the same year, Sheehy decided to retire from inter-county football.

===Inter-provincial===
Sheehy also lined out with Munster in the inter-provincial football competition. He first lined out with his province in 1976, as Munster defeated Leinster by 2–15 to 2–8. It was his first Railway Cup winners&#x27; medal, and the first of three in a row for Sheehy and for Munster. After losing out in 1979 and 1980, Spillane captured a fourth Railway Cup title in 1981. His fifth, and final, Railway Cup title came in 1982

===Soccer===
Sheehy also played soccer in his youth. He had been offered trials with Southampton F.C. in the early 1970s. He was given a list of fixtures for the Southampton reserve team, and told to travel over any weekend for a trial with the team. There was only one snag: he would have to pay his own way. Sheehy didn&#x27;t think that was the way to do things, so he turned down the offer. Sheehy played for St. Brendan&#x27;s Park F.C. in Tralee. Later in the supplement, it is said that he gave up soccer when he broke on to the Kerry senior team.

<doc id="1177073" wikidata="Q8058841" url="?curid=1177073" title="Your Little Secret">
<text>Your Little Secret is the fifth studio album by American singer-songwriter Melissa Etheridge, released by Island Records on November 14, 1995. It is her highest-charting album on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, where it peaked at No. 6. The album also contained three singles, &quot;Your Little Secret&quot;, &quot;I Want to Come Over&quot;, and &quot;Nowhere to Go&quot;. &quot;I Want to Come Over&quot; went on to reach No. 22 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and &quot;Nowhere to Go&quot; peaked at No. 40.

As of 2010, the album has sold 1,348,000 copies in the United States alone, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

==Reception==
&quot;Billboard&quot; praised the record, calling it a &quot;superbly well-crafted album. Armed with her sharpest material to date, the tightest band with which she&#x27;s ever recorded, and an in-your-face sound, Etheridge
rocks even more passionately than on her previous smash, &quot;Yes I Am&quot;...Under pressure to follow up a multiplatinum, milestone album, Etheridge has delivered the goods and then some. A new plateau for an artist who has set the pace for female rockers of her generation.&quot; 

In their review, &quot;Cashbox&quot; noted that &quot;on this, her fifth album, Etheridge continues to demonstrate the consistency that has made her a superstar. The disc kicks in with the grinding rocker/title track, then settles into a groove of anthem-like rockers, such as “I Really Like You,” “This War Is Over” and the record’s best track, the engaging “An Unusual Kiss.” Her ballad skills are underrated, but as “Nowhere To Go” and the opening half of “Shriner’s Park” prove, she is just as talented in that medium. The bottom line is Etheridge is a
great singer with good songs, making every album a project worth embracing.&quot;

&quot;Allmusic&quot; were more mixed in their review, stating that &quot;Etheridge&#x27;s challenge would be to grow as a writer, now that incessant touring and a string of good-but-not-great albums finally had brought her to the platinum threshold. &quot;Your Little Secret&quot; left the question about such growth open.&quot;

<text>Central Georgia Technical College (CGTC) is a unit of the Technical College System of Georgia (TCSG) and provides education for an eleven-county service area in central Georgia. The school&#x27;s service area includes Baldwin, Bibb, Crawford, Dooly, Houston, Jones, Monroe, Peach, Pulaski, Putnam, and Twiggs counties. CGTC is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) to award associate degrees, diplomas, and technical certificates of credit.

==History==
CGTC was originally established in 1962 under the name &quot;Macon Area Vocational-Technical School,&quot; though the school did not officially start holding classes until 1966. The school&#x27;s initial service area was focused solely on the local Macon community, but expanded in 1990 when the school, then named Macon Technical Institute, assumed control of the Baldwin County Adult Center in Milledgeville. The Georgia General Assembly approved funding for a full campus to be constructed in Milledgeville in 1993, and construction of the facility was completed in Fall 1997. The school&#x27;s current service area was formally expanded to its current size on July 6, 2000, as part of the Education Reform Act in Georgia. This act also renamed the school to its current form. After passage of this act, the school built learning centers in the remaining five counties of its seven-county service area.

On September 26, 2012, the State Board of the Technical College System of Georgia voted to merge Central Georgia Technical College and Middle Georgia Technical College. The merger of the colleges created one of the largest two-year colleges in Georgia, with an 11 county service delivery area larger than the state of Delaware.

==Locations and programs==
CGTC&#x27;s primary campuses are located in Warner Robins, Macon and Milledgeville, where associate degrees, diplomas, and technical certificates are available in a variety of programs. There are also Learning Centers in Eatonton, Forsyth, Gray, Hawkinsville, Jeffersonville, and Roberta. The learning centers offer technical certificates, continuing education courses, and learning support courses.

==Athletics==
CGTC began its athletics program in 2010 with the launching of men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams. In addition to basketball, the CGTC athletics program features men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cross country teams. CGTC&#x27;s teams are nicknamed the Titans, and participate in Division I of the National Junior College Athletic Association and the Georgia Collegiate Athletic Association conference.

<text>The Scottish League Cup (), also known as the [[Premier Sports]] Cup for sponsorship reasons, is a football competition open to all Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL) clubs. First held in 1946–47, it is the oldest national League cup in existence. The competition had a straight knockout format but became a group and knockout competition from 2016–17.

Rangers are the record holders of the cup, winning 28 times. Celtic are the current holders, winning their 22nd title after beating Rangers 3–3 (5-4 pen.) at Hampden Park on 15 December 2024.

The domestic television rights are held by Premier Sports who replaced BT Sport from the 2019–20 season.

==Format==
Historically, the Scottish League Cup has oscillated between being a straightforward single-elimination knockout tournament and having an initial group phase. Since the 2016–17 season, the League Cup has used a group phase format. The format has eight groups of five teams playing each other once in a round-robin format. The forty teams playing in the group stage consist of the 38 league clubs who are not participating in UEFA competitions, along with two teams from outside the league. In the group phase, three points are given for a win and one point for a draw. If matches are level after ninety minutes, a penalty shoot-out is held with the winning team gaining a bonus point. The groups are regionalised: there are four groups in the North section, and four in the South section, with three pots for each regional section – top seeds, second seeds, and unseeded clubs. Each group will consist of one top seed, one second seed, and three unseeded clubs.

The eight group winners and three best runners-up progress into the second round, where they are joined by the five clubs participating in UEFA competitions. The tournament then adopts a single-elimination knockout format. There are no replays, which means all drawn matches are decided by extra time and a penalty shootout, if necessary. The semi-final matches are played on a neutral ground, determined by the location and size of supports involved. The final game is traditionally played at Hampden Park in Glasgow, though due to renovations some finals have been played at other venues, such as Celtic Park or Ibrox Stadium. The new format also allowed the SPFL to reintroduce the two-weekend winter break in January. Along with the newly designed tournament, a new television deal for it was announced as BT Sport took over rights from BBC Scotland. In February 2016 the SPFL announced the League Cup final would be moved to November.

== History ==
The cup has its origins in a regional cup competition called the Southern League Cup which was introduced in 1940 when wartime restrictions led to a suspension of the Scottish Cup. This tournament was largely regional and did not involve all of the teams who comprised the Scottish Football League prior to the outbreak of war. The first official Scottish Football League Cup was contested during the 1946–47 season, when Rangers defeated Aberdeen in the final.

The competition was very popular with supporters during the first few decades of its existence. The tournament consisted of 8 or 9 groups consisting of 4 or 5 teams. The groups were seeded into 2 sets with the top 16 teams in Division 1 making up the first four groups. This guaranteed that 4 &#x27;top&#x27; teams would play 4 &#x27;lesser&#x27; teams in the quarter-finals.

Extra games when the Premier League was formed and expanded European competitions meant that by the early 1980s, its long-winded format, which involved group rounds played early in the season leading to two-legged knock-out rounds, attracted much criticism. In the mid-1980s the tournament was revamped to a shorter, single elimination knock-out format with a final played prior to Christmas, which provided the excitement of a cup final early in the season.

During the 1999–2000 competition, the semi-finals and final were moved to the springtime to avoid the congestion of fixtures caused by the early rounds of the UEFA club competitions and Scotland&#x27;s representatives in Europe were given automatic byes until the third round of competition.

From the 2016–17 edition the League Cup reverted to a group stage format, with single-elimination knock-out in the last 16 onwards.

===Previous finals===
===Sponsorship===
The League Cup has been known by different names due to sponsorship:

== Trophy ==
Before the competition&#x27;s official inception, the Scottish Football League awarded the Southern League Cup winners a trophy that had been borrowed from the Scottish Football Association. In the summer of 1946, the Scottish FA asked for the return of that trophy, which became the Victory Cup. 

This left the Scottish Football League without a cup for their new tournament. On 15 January 1947, long-term Clyde, and then Scottish Football League, chairman John McMahon donated the three-handled trophy that is still used to this day.

During the 1980s when Skol lager sponsored the competition, a second trophy known as the Skol Cup was also awarded. After the 1987–88 competition when Rangers won their third Skol Cup, they were given the trophy permanently and a new Skol Cup with a slightly different design was introduced the following season.

== European qualification ==
Until 1995, the winners of the Scottish League Cup were granted a place in the UEFA Cup, although this privilege was rarely invoked as the winning teams usually qualified for Europe by some other means, such as winning the League Championship or Scottish Cup. The final example of this was Raith Rovers who represented Scotland in the 1995–96 UEFA Cup after winning the League Cup the previous season as a First Division club. Since this privilege has been discontinued, some winners have missed out on European football qualification the following season, including 2015–16 winners Ross County who have still never qualified for European football in their history. Additionally Ross County and East Fife are the only League Cup winners to have never played in a UEFA club competition.

==Performance by club==
==Media coverage==
Scottish League Cup matches are shown live by Premier Sports in the United Kingdom and Ireland. In Australia, the Scottish League Cup is broadcast by beIN Sports. The 2009 Scottish League Cup Final was shown live on SBS due to a fixture clash on previous hosts&#x27; Setanta channel. In sub-Saharan Africa, the Scottish League Cup matches are shown live by ESPN
