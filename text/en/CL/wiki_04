<text>Band Aid 20 was the 2004 incarnation of the charity supergroup Band Aid. The group, which included Daniel Bedingfield, Dido, Justin Hawkins of The Darkness, Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead, Chris Martin of Coldplay, Bono of U2, and Paul McCartney, re-recorded the 1984 song &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot;, written by Band Aid organisers Bob Geldof and Midge Ure.

==Recording==
The song was recorded on 14 November 2004, to benefit Sudan&#x27;s troubled Darfur region, and was released that same month. The single became the UK&#x27;s biggest seller of 2004 as well as the Christmas number one.

Bono and Paul McCartney were the only artists from the original Band Aid to lend their voices to Band Aid 20. There was a reported dispute over the line &#x27;Well tonight thank God it&#x27;s them, instead of you&#x27;, which Bono sang on the original version. Justin Hawkins, of The Darkness, laid down a version of the line, as did Robbie Williams, but Bono insisted on re-recording his version, which was eventually used on the record.

Travis lead singer Fran Healy, who played guitar on the recording, said, &quot;It&#x27;s dead exciting. When [the 1984 version] was first recorded, I was 11 and I went everywhere looking for it and I couldn&#x27;t find it, and now we&#x27;re going to do the follow-up to it. It&#x27;s going to be great, McCartney&#x27;s doing it, Bono&#x27;s going to sing his own line, [and] we&#x27;re going to help out with some music, with Nigel Godrich, who produced the single. I really wanted to get Franz Ferdinand involved in it -- I think they&#x27;re going to do it, although I haven&#x27;t spoken to Midge Ure for about a week now.&quot;

&quot;Midge did a thumbnail sketch of the original with new music on it,&quot; Healy continued. &quot;He&#x27;s got the Darkness doing the guitars at the end, and he&#x27;s changed the arrangement of it. He shipped that over to L.A. where Nigel was working with McCartney. If it turns out absolutely shit, it does not matter. What I will say is you&#x27;ve got to buy the record because it&#x27;s the only record that&#x27;s going to save lives this side of Christmas, and you can&#x27;t ask for more than that.&quot;

A special documentary titled &quot;Band Aid 20: Justice, Not Charity&quot;, which went behind-the-scenes of the new recording, was broadcast by BBC One on 6 December 2004.

==Release==
The Band Aid 20 single was first played simultaneously on &quot;The Chris Moyles Show&quot; (on BBC Radio 1) and the breakfast shows on Virgin Radio and Capital Radio, at 8 am on 16 November 2004. The music video was first broadcast in the UK simultaneously over multiple channels, including the five UK analogue terrestrial channels, at 5:55 pm on 18 November 2004, with an introduction by Madonna.

One of the new ways to buy the song, by downloading it from the internet, hit a problem when Apple Computer&#x27;s iTunes Music Store initially refused to supply it, due to their fixed-pricing policy. A partial solution was reached after a few days, enabling UK users to download the song at the standard iTunes price, with Apple donating an extra amount (equivalent to the price difference) to the Band Aid Trust.

The single sold 72,000 copies in the first 24 hours when it was released on 29 November 2004, and went straight in at No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart on 5 December 2004. The CD version sold over 200,000 copies in the first week and was the fastest-selling single of the year. It stayed at No. 1 for Christmas and the week after, a total of four weeks, one week shorter than the 1984 original. It was the last single ever to sell a million physical copies in the UK as the format largely died out other than as a niche product.

The single was supported by companies such as the mobile entertainment provider, WebTV, which allowed customers to play and purchase the song and music video on their mobile phones. It could also be purchased with a bundle of tracks including both the original 1984 version and the 2004 version of &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot;. HMV stores opened early to give customers more time to buy the single and staff wore Band Aid 20 shirts that said, &quot;Have you bought your copy yet?&quot;. Prime Minister Tony Blair was seen picking up a copy of the charity single at an HMV store in Edinburgh.

==Critical reception==
Band Aid 20&#x27;s efforts met with mixed criticism. The BBC said the new generation of singers, who differed greatly from those that appeared on the 1984 original, endeavoured to fit their talents into a 20-year-old template resulting in an &quot;anonymous&quot; record. &quot;The Guardian&quot; said the appearance of female singers was successful.

==Artwork==
British artist Damien Hirst designed an intimidating cover for the Band Aid 20 single, featuring the grim reaper and a starving African child. However, this was later dropped after fears that it might scare children.

<doc id="1152063" wikidata="Q5476301" url="?curid=1152063" title="Fourways">
<text>The area referred to as Fourways (which is a collection of suburbs, including the traditional suburb of Fourways) is the fastest-developing commercial and residential hub in Sandton, north of Johannesburg, South Africa. The main access routes to Fourways are off the N1 at R511 Winnie Mandela Drive, or alternatively along R564 Witkoppen Road. It is located mostly in Region E of the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality. It is roughly as far as one can go in the Johannesburg Metropolitan area before it dissolves into rolling hills, game farms and the capital Pretoria, 55 kilometres to the northeast. Hartebeespoort Dam and the Magaliesberg Mountains lie half an hour to the north-west. It is bordered by Bryanston to the east and south and Randburg to the west.

The Fourways area is also home to the Fourways Mall which became the largest shopping centre in Africa post an extensive upgrade. Montecasino, which is a leisure and casino complex, is also located in the Fourways district.

== History ==
Long before the district came to be called Fourways, it was a residence and game farm owned by the Eriksen family. The residence they built here in the early 1940s was named Norscot Manor (after their nationalities &#x27;Nor&#x27;wegian and &#x27;Scot&#x27;tish). The house is in the classic Cape Dutch style, although it is far too large and misshapen to be considered a true Cape Dutch.

After being sold off piece by piece, the stately manor house was given to the City Council of Johannesburg in the 1970s, who named the suburb that was planned around it &#x27;Norscot&#x27;. The mansion now serves Fourways as Norscot Manor Recreation Centre, the majority of it being a library, but also encompassing an art gallery, lessons for children in Irish &amp; Highland dancing, Ballet, Biodanza, Indian and Modern dancing as well as Judo and Karate, a playground and a tea garden. There has been much alteration to the manor. It contains Art Deco finishes which abound and remain, such as seashell-inspired window fastenings, and air grates above windows delicately molded of plaster and depicting classic Art Deco ideas: the stag and a sylph-like female form in a forest. In 2015, the Norscot manor house was awarded &#x27;blue plaque&#x27; heritage status from the City of Johannesburg, which was unveiled by local Ward Councillor Chris Santana on 18 February 2015.

Fourways was so named because of the four-way stop where William Nicol Drive and Witkoppen Road met. Today William Nicol Drive cuts under Witkoppen Road and is 3 lanes wide. The Fourways name is symbolised with two four-way roundabouts on Kingfisher Drive, the main thoroughfare of the Greater Fourways suburb, intersecting Robin Drive and Alexander Avenue. This suburb also has the original () house the Eriksen lived in before Norscot Manor was built, and it can be found on Flamingo Avenue.

== Geography ==
The Fourways area encompasses several suburbs and estates. The suburbs include Fourways (on the Western side of William Nicol Drive, with a small portion on the Eastern side colloquially known as Little Fourways), Magalies View, Bryanston Ext. 34, several Magaliessig extensions, Norscot, Norscot Slopes, Lone Hill and Beverley, Craigavon, Broadacres. The estates are Cedar Creek, Cedar Lakes, Fourways Gardens, Dainfern, Dainfern Valley, Dainfern Ridge and Fernbrook Estate. The estates have come to be because of the city&#x27;s high crime rate. Dainfern is centred on a golf course, while Cedar Lakes, Fourways Gardens and Fernbrook Estate are centred on family ideals and parks, Fourways Gardens has a small nature enclosure which used to be home to a set of zebra and several blue cranes. The weather is warmer here than that to the South. Fourways will, on average, enjoy Pretoria&#x27;s temperatures, owing to their proximity.

Of the koppies located in Greater Johannesburg, Fourways has one located in the Fourways Nature Reserve, named the Norscot Koppies. Lone Hill and Beverley has another, located in the Lonehill Nature Reserve, named the Lonehill Koppie.

Apart from the metropolitan&#x27;s older and most prestigious suburbs, such as Westcliff in Johannesburg and Sandhurst in Sandton, this area has some of the metro&#x27;s priciest and most sought-after homes.

Central Fourways comprises the entertainment district. These centres are Design Quarter, just north of Magaliessig, Fourways Mall north of Fourways, Montecasino to the east of Fourways, Fourways Crossing just east of Fourways Mall and the newest development, Cedar Square to the north-west of Fourways Mall. It must be mentioned that Broadacres and Lonehill are served by their own smaller shopping centres. These centres are chic, and are frequented by stay-at-home moms, Broadacres being the particular favourite because of the large park-like grounds it encloses, making it a safe and enjoyable haven for children.

== Schools ==

Fourways has several reputable schools. They include the government school Fourways High School in Greater Fourways (grades 8-12), the private Crawford schools: Pre-Primary, and Preparatory in Craigavon (grades 000-7) as well as Crawford Pre-Primary, Preparatory and College in Lonehill (grades 000-12). Dainfern is served by Dainfern College (grades 0-12). Further closer to the Lanseria area is Heronbridge College, a prestigious private school off the R114 Niedgedatcht. Residents of Fourways have a precedent stake in entering their children in Bryanston&#x27;s elite government primary schools Bryandale Primary School and Bryanston Primary School, because of Fourways&#x27; close proximity to Bryanston.

The poor soil quality of the area is owed to the fact that the top-soil was sold off between the 1920s and 1960s.

Some of the main attractions in Fourways are:
*Fourways Mall, the first of the large malls in the area.
*Cedar Square, home to various restaurants, a Virgin Active and the country&#x27;s first 65m ski slope.
*Montecasino, a faux-Tuscan complex designed by architect bureaus Creative Kingdom and Bentel Abramson &amp; Partners.
*Fourways Crossing, a &quot;factory mall&quot; style complex.
These facilities are on the intersection between the R511 and Witkoppen Road, the intersection after which the area was named.

==Trivia==
There are two urban legends, one that the Lonehill Nature Reserve came to be when alarmed residents heard that an American had bought the topmost rock of the Lonehill Koppie. In a panic they had the surrounding area declared a nature reserve, and the American could no longer remove it. The second was that Afrikaners believed that the English would be driven out of South Africa if the top rock could be dislodged. The reserve is open from September through April on Saturdays and Sundays and is an idyllic place to laze away or exert oneself - both koppies may be climbed, and original rock art can be observed.

==Safety and Security==
The Douglasdale office of the South African Police Service located in Douglasdale service the majority of the Fourways District and Bryanston area.

<text>The Fafo Research Foundation, also known as the Fafo Foundation or just Fafo (), is a Norwegian research foundation and owner of the research institute: The &quot;Fafo Institute for Labour and Social Research.&quot; The institute conducts social research both in Norway and internationally. Fafo has its main office in Oslo and an office in Beijing. 

Fafo was founded by the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions (LO) in 1982 and was reorganized as an independent research foundation in 1993 with contributions from the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions, Norwegian Union of Municipal and General Employees and six major Norwegian companies (Orkla Group, Umoe, Elkem, Coop Norge, Sparebank1 Gruppen and Telenor). The first director of Fafo was Terje Rød Larsen (1982–1993). Under his leadership, Fafo became increasingly involved in international peace research and politics, particularly in the Middle East, from the late 1980s; the institute played a central role in the negotiations that culminated in the Oslo Accords. The origin of the Oslo Accords can be traced back to a research project initiated by Fafo in the Palestinian territories, and the negotiations that led to the accords were hosted by Fafo in Oslo. Terje Rød Larsen would subsequently become a UN Under-Secretary-General responsible for coordinating the Middle East peace process.

Jon Hippe was director of Fafo from 2005 to 2015, when he was succeeded by Tone Fløtten, who is managing director of both the foundation and the research institute. As of 2020, Fafo employed 71 researchers.

The foundation is also the owner of the independent analytical group Economics Norway (), consisting of 15 employees as of 2020.

==Fafo Institute for Labour and Social Research==
In 2015 Fafo merged its international research division into the Fafo Institute for Labour and Social Research (). Its scope is industrial relations and labour market policy, social policy and the welfare state, and studies of work and enterprise development. Its international approach is mostly based on living condition surveys in areas previously excluded from social science research, such as Haiti, China and Iraq. Fields included are labour relations, welfare policy, and living conditions.

Fafo has conducted extensive research on the Nordic model, most notably through heading two major research projects in the Nordic countries, commissioned by SAMAK in 2012 and the Nordic Council of Ministers in 2017. Internationally, Fafo was also commissioned by the Central Party School of the Chinese Communist Party to participate in an educational program on the foundations of the Norwegian society model. A representative of the school cited a wish to learn more about the Norwegian approaches to the welfare state and environmental protection.

Sissel Trygstad and Hanne C. Kavli are Heads of Research, and Tone Fløtten is Managing Director.

<text>Paz Lenchantin (born December 12, 1973) is an Argentine-American musician. She is best known for having been the bass guitarist and backing vocalist of the alternative rock band Pixies, playing with the band and recording three studio albums between 2013 and 2024. Prior to joining Pixies, Lenchantin was a member of Entrance, A Perfect Circle, Silver Jews and Zwan. 

In April 2024, &quot;Consequence&quot; named Lenchantin the 75th greatest bass guitarist of all time, noting: &quot;Not only did she fit in beautifully in [A Perfect Circle and Pixies], but she was also a shining light in Billy Corgan’s short-lived band Zwan. In addition to her bass playing, she’s also an accomplished vocalist and a skilled violinist.&quot;

==Early life==
Lenchantin moved to Los Angeles with her family at the age of four. Her father, Mario Merdirossian, is a classical pianist who has been a professor of piano at the National University of Buenos Aires-Tandil, the University of Mississippi, and the Catholic University of Lima, Peru. Lenchantin speaks fluent Spanish and English. She began playing piano at age five. She then took violin lessons at age 8 and taught herself how to play guitar at age 12. Her sister Ana Lenchantin is a musician and a frequent collaborator. She also frequently collaborated with her brother Luciano Lenchantin before his death in 2003. In the &#x27;90s, Paz was a piano teacher, a music programmer for video games, and a sound composer for the Sci-Fi Channel.

== Career ==

Lenchantin joined Billy Howerdel, Josh Freese, Troy Van Leeuwen, and Maynard James Keenan in the band A Perfect Circle. She contributed to their albums &quot;Mer de Noms&quot; and &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot;. Lenchantin later left the group to join Billy Corgan, Jimmy Chamberlin, Matt Sweeney, and David Pajo in the band Zwan. 

In 2002, Lenchantin, Melissa Auf der Maur (Smashing Pumpkins and Hole), Samantha Maloney, and Radio Sloan (the Need) created a new band, the Chelsea. The all-female supergroup played only one show on February 2, 2002 before going their separate ways. An audience recording of said show was later bootlegged. Lenchantin returned to play strings and piano with A Perfect Circle in recording their cover album &quot;Emotive&quot;, released November 2, 2004 and debuting at #2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. She also contributed a solo cover of the song &quot;The Hollow&quot; to A Perfect Circle&#x27;s CD/DVD release &quot;aMOTION&quot;. Since 2005, Lenchantin has been collaborating with the Entrance Band on their album &quot;Prayer of Death&quot;, as co- producer as well as contributing bass and violin. She also appeared on the previous Entrance album &quot;Wandering Stranger&quot; (2004). She is now a seemingly permanent member of the Entrance Band.

Since 2012, Paz has been touring with Josephine Foster supporting the &quot;Blood Rushing&quot; album promotion. In December 2013, Lenchantin was announced as the new touring bassist for Pixies, in replacement of founding band member Kim Deal and touring bassist Kim Shattuck, for their 2014 tour. In July 2016, Lenchantin confirmed that she was a full-time member of Pixies. 

On 4 March 2024, the Pixies announced that Lenchantin had left &quot;to concentrate on her own projects&quot;. In a statement to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Lenchantin said that the choice was not hers and that her &quot;departure [was] a bit of a surprise to [her] as it is to many&quot;.

=== Other appearances ===
Lenchantin played strings on the Queens of the Stone Age album &quot;Songs for the Deaf&quot;. She has played with David Pajo in Papa M, and contributed fiddle on the Silver Jews record &quot;Tanglewood Numbers&quot;. She has toured with RTX/Jennifer Herrema of Royal Trux. In 2002, she performed on Trust Company&#x27;s album &quot;The Lonely Position of Neutral&quot;. In 2005 she played violin on the Kaura track &quot;Dividing Lines&quot;. She has also contributed to and toured with Jarboe of Swans. In 2000, she appeared in A Perfect Circle&#x27;s &quot;Judith&quot; music video as bassist. Lenchantin also played bass on Brightblack Morning Light&#x27;s 2006 self-titled album on Matador Records. She worked with director Michael Mann on his film &quot;Miami Vice&quot; contributing violin on several scenes. She contributed playing strings on Melissa Auf der Maur&#x27;s first solo album &quot;Auf der Maur&quot;. In 2008, Paz co-wrote the Ashes Divide song &quot;Denial Waits&quot;, and she played violin on Jenny Lewis&#x27; second studio album &quot;Acid Tongue&quot;. She appeared on Into the Presence&#x27;s 2009 album, playing the bass.

<text>The -minimum spanning tree problem, studied in theoretical computer science, asks for a tree of minimum cost that has exactly vertices and forms a subgraph of a larger graph. It is also called the -MST or edge-weighted -cardinality tree. Finding this tree is NP-hard, but it can be approximated to within a constant approximation ratio in polynomial time.

==Problem statement==
The input to the problem consists of an undirected graph with weights on its edges, and a The output is a tree with vertices and edges, with all of the edges of the output tree belonging to the input graph. The cost of the output is the sum of the weights of its edges, and the goal is to find the tree that has minimum cost. The problem was formulated by and by .

Ravi et al. also considered a geometric version of the problem, which can be seen as a special case of the graph problem.
In the geometric -minimum spanning tree problem, the input is a set of points in the plane. Again, the output should be a tree with of the points as its vertices, minimizing the total Euclidean length of its edges. That is, it is a graph -minimum spanning tree on a complete graph with Euclidean distances as weights.

==Computational complexity==
When is a fixed constant, the -minimum spanning tree problem can be solved in polynomial time by a brute-force search algorithm that tries all -tuples of vertices.
However, for variable , the -minimum spanning tree problem has been shown to be NP-hard by a reduction from the Steiner tree problem.

The reduction takes as input an instance of the Steiner tree problem: a weighted graph, with a subset of its vertices selected as terminals. The goal of the Steiner tree problem is to connect these terminals by a tree whose weight is as small as possible. To transform this problem into an instance of the -minimum spanning tree problem, attach to each terminal a tree of zero-weight edges with a large number of vertices per tree. (For a graph with vertices and terminals, they use added vertices per tree.) Then, they ask for the -minimum spanning tree in this augmented graph with . The only way to include this many vertices in a -spanning tree is to use at least one vertex from each added tree, for there are not enough vertices remaining if even one of the added trees is missed. However, for this choice of , it is possible for -spanning tree to include only as few edges of the original graph as are needed to connect all the terminals. Therefore, the -minimum spanning tree must be formed by combining the optimal Steiner tree with enough of the zero-weight edges of the added trees to make the total tree size large enough.

Even for a graph whose edge weights belong to the set }, testing whether the optimal solution value is less than a given threshold is NP-complete. It remains NP-complete for planar graphs. The geometric version of the problem is also NP-hard, but not known to belong to NP, because of the difficulty of comparing sums of square roots; instead it lies in the class of problems reducible to the existential theory of the reals.

The -minimum spanning tree may be found in polynomial time for graphs of bounded treewidth, and for graphs with only two distinct edge weights.

==Approximation algorithms==
Because of the high computational complexity of finding an optimal solution to the -minimum spanning tree, much of the research on the problem has instead concentrated on approximation algorithms for the problem. The goal of such algorithms is to find an approximate solution in polynomial time with a small approximation ratio. The approximation ratio is defined as the ratio of the computed solution length to the optimal length for a worst-case instance, one that maximizes this ratio. Because the NP-hardness reduction for the -minimum spanning tree problem preserves the weight of all solutions, it also preserves the hardness of approximation of the problem. In particular, because the Steiner tree problem is NP-hard to approximate to an approximation ratio better than 96/95, the same is true for the -minimum spanning tree problem.

The best approximation known for the general problem achieves an approximation ratio of 2, and is by . This approximation relies heavily on the primal-dual schema of .
When the input consists of points in the Euclidean plane (any two of which can be connected in the tree with cost equal to their distance) there exists a polynomial time approximation scheme devised by .

<text>USS &quot;Guavina&quot; (SS/SSO/AGSS/AOSS-362), a , was a ship of the United States Navy named for the guavina, a fish which may reach a length of indigenous to the West Indies and the Atlantic coasts of Central America and Mexico.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Guavina&quot; initially was ordered as a unit of the &quot;Balao&quot; class, but her builder, the Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company, did not receive the drawings for the &quot;Balao&quot; class from the Electric Boat Company in time to build &quot;Guavina&quot; or the submarines , , and to the new design, so they were built as &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarines. Thus, in some references, these four submarines are listed as units of the &quot;Balao&quot;-class.

&quot;Guavina&quot; was launched by the Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company at Manitowoc, Wisconsin, on 29 August 1943, sponsored by Miss Marie Roen, and commissioned on 23 December 1943.

==Operational history==
After shakedown, &quot;Guavina&quot; was towed down the Mississippi in a floating drydock by tug &quot;Minnesota&quot;, reaching New Orleans 24 January 1944. She underwent training exercises at New Orleans and at Balboa, C.Z., before reaching Pearl Harbor 5 April to prepare for her first war patrol.

=== First war patrol, April – May 1944 ===

&quot;Guavina&quot; sailed 6 April 1944, on her first offensive cruise. On 22 April she sank by gunfire two trawlers loaded with lumber and cargo and 3 days later torpedoed a large &quot;maru&quot;. Her first big kill came 26 April when she sent torpedoes into two of the merchant ships in a seven-ship convoy. One of them, &quot;Noshiro Maru&quot;, sank almost immediately after three tremendous explosions. The second maru also exploded, although persistent depth charging prevented &quot;Guavina&quot; from staying around to observe the sinking.

After standing lifeguard duty off Wake Island during air strikes 21 May – 26 May, the submarine returned to Majuro Atoll 28 May. Her aggressive first patrol forecast even greater service for the nation.

=== Second war patrol, June – July 1944 ===

On her second war patrol (20 June – 31 July) &quot;Guavina&quot; sailed from Majuro to Brisbane, Australia, sinking 1 ship and rescuing 12 downed aviators. At 13:24 on 3 July she picked up an obviously important ship with four escorts, and trailed her to get in attack position. Finally at 03:48 the next morning &quot;Guavina&quot; launched four torpedoes, three of which hit and set off a tremendous explosion. The sub spent the next 3 hours running silent and deep to avoid a total of 18 depth charges and 8 aerial bombs, surfacing at 06:43 to observe the wreckage of &quot;Tama Maru&quot; (3,052 tons). A total of 321 troops, two gunners and eleven crewmen were killed. While on lifeguard duty off Yap 2 July to 21 July, &quot;Guavina&quot; picked up a total of 12 downed B-24 airmen, and then headed for Brisbane via Seeadler Harbor, Admiralty Islands.

=== Third and fourth war patrols, August – December 1944 ===

&quot;Guavina&quot;&#x27;s third war patrol (16 August – 29 September) took her along the Philippine coast off Mindanao. On 31 August she opened fire on two small coastwise steamers, chasing them almost onto the beach before finally destroying them. Then, after a period of lifeguard duty, on 15 September &quot;Guavina&quot; sighted a large ship, later revealed to be a transport at anchor. Closing for the kill she loosed a salvo of three torpedoes. Only one hit, so she fired three more, scoring twice. Although the target was enveloped in fire and smoke, it still did not sink; so &quot;Guavina&quot; administered the final fatal blow with a spread of two torpedoes which totally disintegrated the target.

Departing Brisbane 27 October, &quot;Guavina&quot; headed to the South China Sea for her fourth war patrol. A night surface attack 15 November netted her a large maru; one torpedo hit caused a violent explosion, as the maru apparently was carrying aviation gasoline; a second fish sent through the fiery waters finished her. Tanker &quot;Down Maru&quot; fell victim to &quot;Guavina&quot; 22 November, and a second tanker anchored nearby met the same fate the following day. During the final month she searched for additional victims. Then finding unfavorable attack conditions, she sailed for port, making Perth, Australia 27 December.

=== Fifth and sixth war patrols, January – May 1945 ===

Working first with and then with and , &quot;Guavina&quot; spent her fifth war patrol (23 January – 5 March 1945) again in the South China Sea. The value of the coordinated attack group was quickly proved as on 6 February &quot;Guavina&quot; was directed in for the kill by &quot;Pampanito&quot; and sank the 6,892-ton tanker &quot;Taigyo Maru&quot;. To avoid the subsequent depth charging, &quot;Guavina&quot; pulled the unusual maneuver of lying on the bottom near the stern of her recent victim.

She returned &quot;Pampanito&quot;&#x27;s favor the following day by providing a diversion in the form of four flares from her &quot;Buck Rogers&quot; gun as her sister sub maneuvered for a successful shot. &quot;Guavina&quot; sank another tanker, the 8,673-ton &quot;Eiyo Maru&quot;, 20 February, and suffered one of the severest depth chargings of the war. With no room to run, she lay on the bottom at while Japanese escorts and planes dropped a total of 98 depth charges and bombs during the next 7 hours. Battered but undaunted, she sailed to Subic Bay in the Philippines, arriving 5 March for a badly needed refit.

On her sixth war patrol (21 March – 8 May) &quot;Guavina&quot; worked in coordination with , , and &quot;Blenny&quot; in the South China Sea. A lack of targets resulted in her returning empty-handed, but she did rescue five B-25 crew members 28 March before returning to Pearl Harbor 8 May. With six successful war patrols behind her she proceeded to the West Coast for overhaul. She departed San Francisco for Pearl Harbor 6 August, but with the end of the war returned to the States. &quot;Guavina&quot; then put in at Mare Island and was placed in commission, in reserve, and Decommissioned 8 June 1946.

=== Post-war service as submarine tanker ===

From March 1949, &quot;Guavina&quot; underwent extensive overhaul and modification under project SCB 39 for conversion to a submarine oiler at Mare Island, and was even equipped with a snorkel. &quot;Guavina&quot; recommissioned in the active fleet as SSO-362 1 February 1950 at Mare Island. After operations along the West Coast, she sailed to Norfolk via Balboa and San Juan 24 July to 25 August. Further operations out of Norfolk were followed by overhaul at Philadelphia and on 29 January 1951, &quot;Guavina&quot; reported to Key West, her new homeport.

Operating out of Key West, &quot;Guavina&quot; cruised to the Caribbean Sea and up the East Coast to Nova Scotia to test the concepts of fueling seaplanes and other submarines, although most of her work was in the Gulf of Mexico and the Straits of Florida. After overhaul at Philadelphia 18 April to 26 July 1952, &quot;Guavina&quot; was redesignated AGSS-362. Two more years of operations along the East Coast and in the Gulf were followed by a second extensive overhaul at Philadelphia. To aid refueling, &quot;Guavina&quot; gained a large, raised platform over the after torpedo room, which was soon dubbed the &quot;flight deck&quot;.

And a flight deck it soon became as in January 1956 &quot;Guavina&quot; began testing the concept of mobile support of seaplanes from a submarine oiler. After an initial 2-week trial period, &quot;Guavina&quot; and a variety of seaplanes carried out refueling development for most of 1956. Sailing from Charleston 18 September, the submarine headed for the Mediterranean Sea. After her 2-month deployment there with the 6th Fleet and Patrol Squadron 56, &quot;Guavina&quot; returned to Key West 1 December, then put into Charleston for overhaul.

Emerging from overhaul 12 July 1957 with the new designation AOSS-362, &quot;Guavina&quot; resumed her established pattern of testing various applications of submarine oiler and seaplane refueling concepts, operating principally in the Caribbean. Ranging along the coast from New London to Bermuda, she also engaged in antisubmarine exercises and other peacetime training missions.

=== Grounding ===

On 16 February 1958 &quot;Guavina&quot; was operating in the Bahamas and dropped anchor off the island of San Salvador. Overnight, high winds and heavy seas pushed her aground. &quot;Guavina&quot; spent several days stuck hard aground in the shallow sandy surf of San Salvador. She eventually was freed by the combined efforts of the salvage and rescue ships and and the ocean tugs and .

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Guavina&quot; arrived at the Charleston Navy Yard in Charleston, South Carolina, on 4 January 1959, and decommissioned there on 27 March 1959, going into reserve. She served as a training ship for United States Naval Reserve personnel in the 5th Naval District at Baltimore, Maryland, until struck from the Navy List on 30 June 1967 and sunk as a target by the submarine off Cape Henry, Virginia, with a Mark 16-1 torpedo.

==Honors and awards==
&quot;Guavina&quot; received five battle stars for World War II service.

==Notable Veterans==
Maxime Faget, the NASA engineer responsible for the design of the Mercury spacecraft, and who contributed to the design of the Gemini and Apollo spacecraft and the Space Shuttle served on &quot;Guavina&quot; during the Second World War.

<text>The 1897 VFL season was the inaugural season of the Victorian Football League (VFL), the highest-level senior Australian rules football competition in Victoria. The season ran from 8 May to 4 September, comprising a 14-round home-and-away season followed by a three-week finals series featuring the top four clubs. Eight Victorian Football Association (VFA) clubs – , , , , , , and – featured in the inaugural season after seceding from the VFA in 1896.

Essendon won the inaugural premiership after winning all three of its finals matches, with Geelong finishing as runners-up with two wins. Geelong won the minor premiership by finishing atop the home-and-away ladder with an 11–3 win–loss record. Geelong&#x27;s Eddy James and Melbourne&#x27;s Jack Leith tied for the leading goalkicker medal as the league&#x27;s leading goalkickers.

==Background==
In 1897, the VFL competition consisted of eight teams of 20 on-the-field players each, with no &quot;reserves&quot; (although any of the 20 players who had left the playing field for any reason could later resume their place on the field at any time during the match). Each team played each other twice in a home-and-away season of 14 rounds.

Once the 14-round home-and-away season had finished, the 1897 VFL Premiers were determined according to the conditions dictated by the specific format and conventions of the 1897 Finals System, which was used in this season only.

==Season notes==
* The game between Essendon and Melbourne in the third round of the finals holds the record for the lowest combined score in a match in VFL/AFL history: 1.16 (22).
* George Stuckey, the captain of the Essendon Football Club team that won the VFL&#x27;s inaugural premiership, also won the 130-yard Stawell Gift in 1897 in 12.2 seconds off a handicap of 12 yards.
* In the first round of 1897, the VFL revoked the VFA&#x27;s (then prevailing) push-in-the-back rule. The rule was reinstated before the second round&#x27;s matches on the following Saturday due to complaints from fans, players and officials.
* On 12 June, a League representative team played against a Ballarat Football League representative team at the Brunswick Street Oval. Ballarat 13.11 (89) defeated the League 8.6 (54).
* On 3 July 1897, Fitzroy rover Bill McSpeerin weaved his way and bounced the ball the length of the Brunswick Street Oval to score a goal against St Kilda.
* Fred Waugh was unable to play in South Melbourne&#x27;s team for the Round 11 game with St Kilda after attempting suicide. He had been spurned by his lover, and had become disconsolate. His mother found him in his room covered in blood, having cut his throat with a blunt knife. Luckily, he missed severing his windpipe and blood vessels, and a doctor was able to repair the wounds.
* Carlton&#x27;s first six matches were all away games due to renovations at Princes Park, with the first game at Princes Park being a 5.6 (36) loss to Collingwood 6.4 (40) on 22 June, the Diamond Jubilee Holiday.
* The first-round finals match between Geelong and Essendon at the Corio Oval was the only finals match to be played in Geelong until 2013.

<doc id="1152090" wikidata="Q4819591" url="?curid=1152090" title="Hampton Roads Beltway">
<text>The Hampton Roads Beltway is a loop of Interstate 64 and Interstate 664, which links the communities of the Virginia Peninsula and South Hampton Roads which surround the body of water known as Hampton Roads and comprise much of the region of the same name in the southeastern portion of Virginia in the United States. It crosses the harbor of Hampton Roads at two locations on large four-laned bridge-tunnel facilities: the eastern half carries Interstate 64 (and U.S. Route 60) and uses the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel and the western half carries Interstate 664 and uses the Monitor-Merrimac Memorial Bridge-Tunnel. The beltway has the clockwise direction (as looking down at a map of the area) signed as the Inner Loop, and the counter-clockwise direction signed as the Outer Loop. The entire beltway, including the bridge-tunnels, is owned and operated by the Virginia Department of Transportation.

==History==
Even before Interstate 64 was built beginning in 1958, from some of the earliest planning stages, there were hopes of a circumferential highway to Interstate highway standards for the Hampton Roads region. Some proposals envisioned state and local and/or toll funding if necessary to achieve that goal.

Indeed, the first two-laned portion of the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel was built with toll revenue bond funding in 1957 prior to the creation of I-64. It carried U.S. Route 60 and State Route 168 designations, and tied in with the new Tidewater Drive in Norfolk. (Tolls were removed when the other two lanes and tunnel were built adjacently to the immediate south of the older structure with federal Interstate Highway funding in the mid 1970s.)

Building of Interstate 64 was the first priority in the region, and a portion of Interstate 264 through Portsmouth connecting with the Downtown Tunnel was completed even as I-64 finally reached its eastern terminus at Bower&#x27;s Hill in Norfolk County (which became the City of Chesapeake in 1963).

I-64, the portion of the Hampton Roads Beltway which was completed first, makes a huge long arc around the area, from Hampton through portions of Norfolk, Virginia Beach, and Chesapeake and around Portsmouth to reach Bower&#x27;s Hill at the edge of the Great Dismal Swamp.

It was a number of years before the newer I-664 portion was built. The roadway connects with I-64 at Bower&#x27;s Hill in Chesapeake and crosses through portions of Portsmouth and Suffolk to cross Hampton Roads via the Monitor-Merrimac Memorial Bridge-Tunnel and then pass through eastern Newport News to reconnect with I-64 in Hampton. This completed the loop in 1992.

In January, 1997, a -long I-64/I-664 loop was designated by the Virginia Department of Transportation (and signed) as the Hampton Roads Beltway.

==Route description==
I-664 begins at a full Y interchange with I-64 and I-264 that serves as the terminus of all three Interstates in the Bowers Hill section of the city of Chesapeake. I-64 heads southeast as a continuation of the Hampton Roads Beltway through Chesapeake while I-264 heads east toward Portsmouth and Norfolk. I-664 heads west as an eight-lane freeway that has a southbound-only exit ramp to US 13 and US 460 (Military Highway) and crosses over Military Highway and a Norfolk Southern Railway rail line. The Interstate has a cloverleaf interchange with Military Highway, which here carries US 58 in addition to US 13 and US 460. The interchange also provides access to US 460 Alternate, which follows US 58 east into Portsmouth. I-664 curves north as a four-lane freeway that crosses Goose Creek and has a diamond interchange with SR 663 (Dock Landing Road) and a cloverleaf interchange with SR 337 (Portsmouth Boulevard).

Just south of its partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 659 (Pughsville Road), I-664 crosses a rail line; a spur from that rail line heads north in the median of the freeway as the highway enters the city of Suffolk. The rail spur leaves the median and heads northeast toward Portsmouth just south of its interchange with SR 164 (Western Freeway) and US 17 (Bridge Road). SR 164 heads east toward downtown Portsmouth while US 17 heads northwest to the James River Bridge. There is no access from southbound I-664 to southbound US 17; that movement is made via the next interchange, a cloverleaf interchange with SR 135 (College Drive) that serves satellite campuses of Tidewater Community College and Old Dominion University and the Portsmouth neighborhood of Churchland.

North of SR 135, northbound I-664 has a vehicle inspection station and crossovers before the highway enters the Monitor-Merrimac Memorial Bridge-Tunnel. The bridge-tunnel passes to the west of Craney Island, an artificial island in the city of Portsmouth that lies to the west of the mouth of the Elizabeth River. West of the highway is the confluence of the James River and Nansemond River to form Hampton Roads, as well as the James River Bridge a short distance to the north on the namesake river. I-664 heads north-northeast along a causeway for to a point west of the Newport News Middle Ground Light, where the pair of bridges curve to the north-northwest onto an artificial island where the highway descends into a pair of tunnels under the estuary&#x27;s main shipping channel. The Interstate resurfaces on another artificial island at Newport News Point east of the coal piers in the city of Newport News.

I-664 has a southbound vehicle inspection station adjacent to its first interchange in Newport News, with Terminal Avenue. The Interstate parallels the southern end of CSX&#x27;s Peninsula Subdivision as it passes through interchanges with several streets to the east of downtown Newport News. The southern interchange has ramps to and from 25th, 26th, and 27th streets; the first two streets carry eastbound and westbound US 60, which is unmarked from I-664. The northern interchange has ramps to and from 35th Street and Jefferson Avenue; Jefferson Avenue is SR 143, which is also unmarked from the Interstate. I-664 curves east as a six-lane freeway away from the railroad and has an oblique crossing of SR 351 (39th Street) prior to half-diamond interchanges with Roanoke Avenue and Chestnut Street. The Interstate enters the city of Hampton and has diamond interchanges with Aberdeen Road and Powhatan Parkway before reaching its northern terminus at I-64. I-664 meets its parent highway at a directional T interchange above Newmarket Creek just south of Hampton Coliseum.

The Hampton Roads Beltway continues east along I-64, continuing the Inner Loop. I-64 curves north-northeast to pass north of Downtown Hampton and cross the Hampton River, turning back southward to reach the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel, which it utilizes to cross the main shipping channel at the entrance to the harbor of Hampton Roads from the Chesapeake Bay.

Once on the Southside, I-64 turns south through Norfolk, passing the eastern boundary of Naval Station Norfolk and Chambers Field, and the spur route supplying it, Interstate 564. It then becomes a six lane divided highway with a two lane reversible roadway in the middle, which is used for HOV-traffic during morning and afternoon rush hours. It continues through Norfolk, curving multiple times and eventually ending up heading due south as it passes the interchange with another of its spur routes, Interstate 264 on the northwest side of Virginia Beach.

After I-264, there are no more directional markers I-64 until its &quot;eastern&quot; terminus, because I-64 &quot;east&quot; will actually head west after its current southward course, and vice versa. From I-264 to its &quot;eastern&quot; terminus, it is simply only signed as the Inner and Outer loop of the Hampton Roads Beltway.

Shortly after the I-264 interchange, I-64 leaves Virginia Beach for the city of Chesapeake. It soon comes to a complex interchange between another of its spur routes, Interstate 464, along with SR 168 and U.S. 17. I-64, now running westward, crosses the Southern Branch of the Elizabeth River using the High Rise Bridge. The road then curves northwesterly and comes back to Bowers Hill, where it meets the western terminus of Interstate 264 and the southern terminus of Interstate 664, completing the Beltway.

=== High Rise Bridge &amp; I-64 widening ===
The Southside portion of the Beltway (from the I-464/SR 168/U.S. 17 interchange in Chesapeake to the Bowers Hill Interchange in Suffolk) was approved in March 2015 for the addition of two lanes of capacity in each direction, with the possibility of them being either 2 HOT lanes, 1 HOV &amp; 1 general purpose lane or all four lanes being tolled. Widening would be accomplished by adding the lanes in the median east of U.S. 17 and to the outside shoulder west of U.S. 17. The approved plan also calls for the construction of a new, four-lane 135 ft. fixed span bridge to the south of the current High Rise Bridge. Construction will be conducted in multiple phases, similar to the widening project on the Peninsula:
* The first phase of the project would widen I-64 to 6 lanes in each direction by adding the new lane to the median in both directions as a managed lane, begin the construction of the new High Rise Bridge, and replace and rehabilitate other existing bridges in the area. This segment is estimated to cost around $600 million.
* The second phase would see all six lanes of I-64 shifted to the newly constructed bridge while the old bridge is demolished and replaced with a new four lane bridge that would eventually carry Inner Loop (I-64 West) traffic.
* The final phase would see the addition of the fourth lanes of traffic added to both directions and the shift of Inner Loop/I-64 West to the newly reconstructed bridge.
Once completed, the entire corridor would be an eight-lane stretch of highway, with two 135-ft fixed span bridges. Estimated costs for the entire project are currently estimated at $2.30 billion. Currently, the project is expected to be awarded in August 2017, with construction likely to begin in 2018. Plans have construction to be complete by 2020.

=== Outer Loop/I-264 interchange widening ===
In 2016, VDOT undertook a project to build and improve on the exit ramp from the Outer Loop (I-64 westbound, from Chesapeake towards Norfolk/Hampton) to eastbound I-264. The single lane exit ramp is typically highly congested during peak traffic hours due to the fact that it requires vehicles exiting onto I-264 to weave merge into a collector-distributor lane which carries traffic exiting to nearby Virginia State Route 403 (Newtown Road). Plans call for adding a second Outer Loop exit lane and widening of the exit ramp from one to two lanes. The project will also build a new, two lane collector distributor road for traffic exiting to Newtown Road, while allowing traffic from the Outer Loop to connect to the old collector-distributor lanes without weaving through traffic. The projects expected cost is $158 million, and should be completed by October 2019.

=== High Occupancy - Toll (HOT) lane conversion ===

As part of the I-64 Express Lanes project, the Hampton Roads Beltway will see the conversion of all of its HOV lanes to HOT lanes. Segment 1 will convert the 2 lane reversible roadway in Norfolk between the I-64/I-564 interchange and the I-64/I-264 interchange to HOT-2 lanes, Segment 2 would convert the single HOV-2 diamond lane in each direction to HOT-2 lanes, and will extend those lanes across the new High Rise Bridge to the Bowers Hill interchange, and Segment 3 would continue the project from the I-564/I-64 interchange in Norfolk across the Hampton Roads to the I-64/I-664 interchange in Newport News.

Segment 1 is currently the only completed section. Segment 2 is currently under construction as part of the I-64 Southside Widening and the Segment 3 as part of the HRBT Expansion in 2024.

<text>Imperial War Museum Duxford is a branch of the Imperial War Museum near Duxford in Cambridgeshire, England. Britain&#x27;s largest aviation museum, Duxford houses the museum&#x27;s large exhibits, including nearly 200 aircraft, military vehicles, artillery and minor naval vessels in seven main exhibition buildings. The site also provides storage space for the museum&#x27;s other collections of material such as film, photographs, documents, books and artefacts. The site accommodates several British Army regimental museums, including those of the Parachute Regiment (named &quot;Airborne Assault&quot;) and the Royal Anglian Regiment.

Based on the historic Duxford Aerodrome, the site was originally operated by the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) during the First World War. During the Second World War Duxford played a prominent role during the Battle of Britain and was later used by United States Army Air Forces fighter units in support of the daylight bombing of Germany. Duxford remained an active RAF airfield until 1961. After the Ministry of Defence declared the site surplus to requirements in 1969 the Imperial War Museum received permission to use part of the site for storage. The entirety of the site was transferred to the museum in February 1976.

In keeping with the site&#x27;s history many of Duxford&#x27;s original buildings, such as hangars used during the Battle of Britain, are still in use. Many of these buildings are of particular architectural or historic significance and over thirty have listed building status, Duxford &quot;retain[ing] the best-preserved technical fabric remaining from [a historic airfield] up to November 1918&quot; and being &quot;remarkably well-preserved&quot;. The site also features several purpose-built exhibition buildings, such as the Stirling Prize-winning American Air Museum, designed by Sir Norman Foster. The site remains an active airfield and is used by civilian flying companies, and hosts regular air shows. The site is operated in partnership with Cambridgeshire County Council and the Duxford Aviation Society, a charity formed in 1975 to preserve civil aircraft and promote appreciation of British civil aviation history.

==History==
The Imperial War Museum originated during the First World War in 1917 as the National War Museum committee, formed by the British government to record the war effort and sacrifice of Britain and her Empire. The museum opened in 1920, by which point it had been renamed the &quot;Imperial&quot; War Museum. With the outbreak of the Second World War, the museum&#x27;s terms of reference were enlarged to include that conflict as well. The museum&#x27;s terms of reference was broadened again in 1953 to include all modern conflicts in which British or Commonwealth forces were engaged. The effect of these expansions of remit was to cause the museum&#x27;s collections to expand enormously, to the point that many parts of the collection, especially those of aircraft, vehicles and artillery, could not be effectively stored or exhibited. Although the museum&#x27;s south London home (a nineteenth-century building in Southwark which was previously the Bethlem Royal Hospital) had been extended in 1966, by the end of the decade the museum was seeking additional space.

RAF Duxford, a Royal Air Force fighter station had been declared surplus to requirements by the Ministry of Defence in 1969, and the museum duly requested permission to use part of one of the airfield&#x27;s hangars as temporary storage. Duxford featured three double bay hangars of First World War vintage, which together provided over of space. Within two years, ten of the museum&#x27;s aircraft had been brought to Duxford, and were being restored by volunteers of the East Anglia Aviation Society. While the museum&#x27;s own aircraft were not restored to flying condition, by cooperating with private groups the museum was able to mount its first airshow in 1973. Further air shows followed, with a display in June 1976 attracting an audience of 45,000 people. The runway was bought by Cambridgeshire County Council in 1977. The success of these shows provided a valuable source of revenue, and complemented the efforts of volunteers, so that the museum applied for the permanent transfer of the entire site to its use. Permission was received in February 1976 and Duxford became the first outstation of the Imperial War Museum. Initially open from March–October, Duxford received 167,000 visitors in the 1977 season, and 340,000 in 1978. Two million visitors had been received by 1982 and Duxford welcomed its ten millionth visitor in August 2005.

===Duxford aerodrome===

Duxford has been associated with British military aviation since 1917, when a site near the village of Duxford, in southern Cambridgeshire, was selected for a new Royal Flying Corps training aerodrome. From 1925 Duxford became a fighter airfield, a role it was to retain until the end of its operational life, and in August 1938 the Duxford-based No.19 Squadron RAF became the first to operate the Supermarine Spitfire.
With the outbreak of war in September 1939 Duxford was home to three RAF squadrons engaged on coastal patrol duties. From July 1940, Duxford saw considerable action during the Battle of Britain as a sector station of RAF Fighter Command&#x27;s No. 12 Group. In the middle years of the war Duxford was home to specialist units, such as the tacticians and engineers of the Air Fighting Development Unit. In April 1942 the first Typhoon Wing was formed at Duxford. Notable among the pilots of the Wing was Group Captain John Grandy who would later rise to be Chief of the Air Staff and also served as Chairman of the Trustees of the Imperial War Museum from 1978 to 1989.

In March 1943 the United States Army Air Forces&#x27; 78th Fighter Group started to arrive at Duxford with their Republic P-47 Thunderbolts. The Group reequipped with North American P-51 Mustangs in December 1944 and until the end of the war in Europe the Group remained at Duxford carrying out bomber escort and fighter sweeps, ground strafing and ground attack missions.
Duxford was officially returned to the RAF on 1 December 1945. It remained a fighter station but by 1958 changing defence priorities saw the RAF&#x27;s fighter force move to more northerly bases. Duxford&#x27;s last operational flight was made in July 1961. No longer operational, the site gradually became increasingly derelict and overgrown. In 1968 the American film studio United Artists obtained permission to use the site for the filming of &quot;Battle of Britain&quot;. During the shoot a single bay hangar, which had been built during the First World War, was demolished to simulate an air raid. After the Ministry of Defence announced its intention to dispose of Duxford plans were drawn up for various developments including two Young Offenders Institutes but were not implemented.
==Duxford Aviation Society==
Duxford is operated in partnership between the Imperial War Museum, Cambridgeshire County Council and the Duxford Aviation Society. The Society is a registered charity (No. 285809) and states two objectives; to educate the public by collecting and exhibiting historic aircraft, military vehicles and boats, and to support the Imperial War Museum.

The Society was formed in 1975 from a divergence of members of the East Anglian Aviation Society, which formerly operated the now-closed Bassingbourn Tower Museum at the former RAF Bassingbourn.

Duxford Aviation Society preserves and maintains the Civil Aviation Collection. Especially notable aircraft in the collection include a de Havilland Comet which made the first eastbound jet-powered trans-Atlantic passenger flight on 4 October 1958, and Concorde G-AXDN 101, a pre-production aircraft which achieved the highest speed of any Concorde, making a westwards trans-Atlantic flight in two hours, 56 minutes.

In support of the Museum&#x27;s goals, the DAS Military Vehicle Wing provides one of the world&#x27;s leading teams of military vehicle restoration engineers The Wing (or its volunteers) own some of the vehicles located at Duxford, and provide restoration services for vehicles within the museum&#x27;s collection. The team also operate vehicles for demonstrations during the year. The wing&#x27;s works have been featured in the Discovery Channel&#x27;s Tank Overhaul programme, James May&#x27;s 20th Century, and wide variety of magazines and other media.

Other elements of the society provide or support a range of functions at the Duxford site, including canteen, aircraft conservation, learning and interpretative activities and administrative tasks. An affiliated group, the Duxford Radio Society, collects, preserves, exhibits, and demonstrates historic military electronic equipment. This is housed in Buildings 177 and 178, close to the Gibraltar Gun.

Since January 1999, the Society have operated the Friends of Duxford membership scheme with the Museum.

As of 2008, the Duxford Aviation Society had almost 700 volunteer members.

==Air shows and flying==
Duxford remains an active airfield and maintains two parallel runways; an unpaved grass strip, and a concrete runway with a length of , both oriented at 060/240-degrees. The runway was originally purchased from the Ministry of Defence by the Cambridgeshire County Council in 1977. In October 2008, an agreement was reached between the council and the Imperial War Museum, under which the runways and of surrounding grassland would be sold to the museum for approximately £1.6 million.

Since 1973, Duxford has held regular air shows. Duxford is the home of several private aviation companies, such as Classic Wings, The Fighter Collection, the Old Flying Machine Company and The Aircraft Restoration Company. Between them these companies provide pleasure flights, historic aircraft for film or television work, and aircraft restoration services. Perhaps the most notable privately owned and operated aircraft based at Duxford is B-17 Preservation Ltd&#x27;s &quot;Sally B&quot;, the only airworthy B-17 Flying Fortress in Europe.

Major air shows held regularly include the Duxford Air Show, and American Air Day, which is held in conjunction with units of the Third Air Force (part of the United States Air Forces in Europe), based at nearby RAF Lakenheath and RAF Mildenhall. The Flying Legends show (organised by The Fighter Collection), was held annually at Duxford until 2019.

The Duxford Air Show usually exhibits a wide range of aircraft, from vintage warbirds to contemporary jet aircraft, along with aerobatic flying by groups such as the Red Arrows. while the Flying Legends show focuses on historic aircraft, especially those of the Second World War. In 2008 it was reported that these displays generate up to £1.8 million, while the loss of up to £100,000 due to adverse weather is also budgeted for. The policing bill, necessary to manage the resulting road traffic, was reported as some £8,000. Major events have included the Battle of Britain 70th Anniversary airshow, held on 4–5 September 2010, attended by more than 40,000 people, featuring formation displays by four Hawker Hurricanes and sixteen Spitfires.

As an active civil airfield, operations at Duxford are regulated by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). In 2002 a privately operated Aero L-39 Albatros suffered a braking failure on landing, overran the runway and came to rest on the M11 motorway, a student pilot being killed after ejecting at ground level. An Air Accidents Investigation Branch inquiry recommended a review of arrangements for aircraft taking off or landing towards the M11. As a result, the CAA and Duxford agreed to a reduction in the runway&#x27;s declared length, from to , in order to provide a greater margin of error.

As a licensed airfield Duxford has its own Fire Service (currently five vehicles, and 16 fire fighters / officers) which operates as part of the Airfield &amp; Security department, the fire service was originally operated by voluntary crews who were part of Duxford Aviation Society, with the training officers coming from Stansted and other local airports, for the last few years it has been a mixed voluntary/full-time operation.

==Site layout==
When originally planned in 1917, Duxford aerodrome was to occupy a site divided by what is now the A505 road which runs north-east from Royston to Newmarket. The area north of the road would be occupied by accommodation and administrative buildings with the airfield, hangars and technical buildings on the south side. Still divided by the A505, the museum&#x27;s site is now bounded to the east by the M11 motorway, which meets the A505 adjacent to the museum site at Junction 10. The construction of the M11 in 1977 (the year the museum opened) forced the shortening of the runway by . In its role as a museum, the north side of the site is occupied by the Imperial War Museum&#x27;s stored collections and is not generally open to the public, while the south side is occupied by various hangars and other historic buildings, purpose-built structures, and by two runways.

The south side visitor entrance, which now houses a shop and visitor facilities, was previously the airfield&#x27;s armoury. The various buildings are arranged roughly parallel to the A505; AirSpace is furthest east, with Hangars 2, 3, 4 and 5 running westwards, followed by the American Air Museum and the Land Warfare Hall. The museum site is approximately from one end to the other, and a visitor bus operates during opening hours.

Some aircraft and other exhibits are displayed externally, such as a Comet tank and replica Hawker Hurricane as gate guardians at the main entrance. Several commercial airliners belonging to the Duxford Aviation Society stand on the runway apron opposite the hangars. A Bloodhound surface-to-air missile stands on the site of the demolished hangar. A United States Air Force F-15 Eagle previously stood near the American Air Museum (now hanging inside). A Royal Engineers&#x27; Centurion AVRE stands outside the Land Warfare Hall and the Gibraltar Gun, a 9.2-inch artillery piece previously emplaced on the Rock of Gibraltar is nearby.

As a historic site, many of Duxford&#x27;s buildings are of particular architectural or historic significance. In 2005, following a review of sites relating to British aviation history by English Heritage, some 255 buildings at 31 sites received listed building status. Duxford contains over thirty of these buildings, the largest number at any one site. Listed buildings include three hangars dating back to the First World War and the operations block, which received Grade II* status. This block, open to the public, houses the wartime operations room from which Duxford&#x27;s aircraft were directed. Another historic building, the 1918 Watch Office, has been converted to accommodate the &quot;Historic Duxford&quot; exhibition, depicting the history of the site and the experiences of Duxford&#x27;s personnel.

==AirSpace==
In 2000, Duxford announced plans for the redevelopment of Hangar 1, previously known as the &#x27;Superhangar&#x27;, which was built in the 1980s. The plans would expand the building by 40%, providing more display and conservation space, improve internal conditions, and enable the museum&#x27;s British and Commonwealth aircraft collection to be brought under cover. Planning permission was received later that year. The project cost £25 million and was supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund, the East of England Development Agency and BAE Systems, which contributed £6 million. The building, which provides of floor space, consists of an aircraft conservation area, a large exhibition hall, and a mezzanine providing views of the aircraft and interactive educational installations exploring aeronautical engineering and the principles of flight.

AirSpace officially opened to the public on 12 July 2007. Over 30 aircraft are on display, dating back to the First World War; early aircraft include rare examples of an Airco DH.9 and a Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8. The former is one of only six surviving DH9s and the only example on display in the UK, and the latter is the only complete and original R.E.8 in existence. More recent notable aircraft include a Hawker Siddeley Harrier which served during the Falklands War with No. 1 Squadron RAF, and a Panavia Tornado, which flew the highest number of bomber sorties of any Tornado in the 1991 Gulf War. Also on display is a British Aircraft Corporation TSR-2 strike aircraft, one of only two survivors from the cancellation of the project in 1965. Recent additions include Eurofighter Typhoon DA4, one of seven Typhoon development aircraft, which was donated to the museum by the Ministry of Defence in 2008 and went on display in June 2009. Civil aircraft include the Duxford Aviation Society&#x27;s Concorde and Comet described above.
===Airborne Assault===
AirSpace also houses &quot;Airborne Assault&quot;, the museum of the British Army&#x27;s Parachute Regiment and airborne forces. Previously located at Browning Barracks near Aldershot, the museum opened at Duxford on 8 December 2008. The opening ceremony was led by the then Prince Charles, the Parachute Regiment&#x27;s Colonel-in-Chief. The museum chronicles the history of British airborne forces from the Second World War to current operations in Afghanistan and cost £3 million.

==Hangar 2: Flying Aircraft==
Hangar 2 is a double Type T2 hangar, erected in the 1970s. It occupies the site of a T2 hangar erected in the 1950s. It accommodates the flyable aircraft of Duxford&#x27;s private aviation companies, such as The Fighter Collection, and allows visitors to see aircraft undergoing maintenance or restoration.

==Hangar 3: Air and Sea==
Hangar 3, an original Belfast truss hangar, houses Duxford&#x27;s maritime exhibition. The collection includes notable vessels and naval aircraft. Boats on display include Coastal Motor Boat 4, built by Thornycroft in 1916. She saw action during the Baltic campaign of 1918–19, and her commander Lieutenant Augustus Agar won the Victoria Cross for sinking the Russian cruiser &quot;Oleg&quot; on 17 June 1919. Other vessels include the Vosper motor torpedo boat MTB-71, acquired from the British Military Powerboat Trust in 2005, an example of an X-Craft midget submarine, and a wartime Royal National Lifeboat Institution boat, the &quot;Jesse Lumb&quot; which was stationed at Bembridge on the Isle of Wight. A variety of naval aircraft are on display, including a de Havilland Sea Vixen, Sea Venom, and Sea Vampire, and a Westland Wasp helicopter which was embarked on the frigate HMS &quot;Apollo&quot; during the Falklands War.
==Hangar 4: Battle of Britain Exhibition==
Hangar 4 is one of Duxford&#x27;s historic hangars, and now houses an exhibition exploring Duxford&#x27;s history as an operational RAF airfield from the First World War to the Cold War. The early period is represented by a Bristol Fighter, a type operated by Duxford&#x27;s No.2 Flying Training School from 1920. The latter period is represented by a Hawker Hunter which flew at Duxford with No. 65 Squadron RAF, a Gloster Javelin, the type which made the last operational flight at Duxford in 1961, and by a Hungarian Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21, a common Warsaw Pact jet fighter. Britain&#x27;s air defence during the Second World War is particularly emphasised, with exhibits representing the Battle of Britain, the Blitz and the V-1 flying bomb offensive from 1944. Notable aircraft include a Messerschmitt Bf 109E which was flown during the Battle of Britain until forced down in Sussex due to engine failure. It is displayed as part of a tableau showing the crashed aircraft under guard. One unusual aircraft on display is the Cierva C.30A autogyro, which was used by 74 (Signals) Wing, based at Duxford, to test the calibration of coastal radar units.

==Hangar 5: Conservation in Action==
Hangar 5, the westernmost original hangar, houses Duxford&#x27;s aircraft conservation workshops. Open to the public, the hangar allows visitors to see museum staff and volunteers at work on a variety of conservation tasks. Notable projects include a Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter acquired from an American owner in &#x27;jungle recovery&#x27; condition, and a Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8 now on display in AirSpace. Duxford is a partner with the British Aviation Preservation Council in the National Aviation Heritage Skills Initiative, which has been funded since 2005 by the Heritage Lottery Fund and aims to provide training to volunteers supporting aviation heritage projects. It is currently working on the cockpits of a Handley Page Victor (XH669) and a Vickers Valiant (XD826).

==American Air Museum==
From the late 1970s the museum acquired several important American aircraft; a B-17G Flying Fortress in 1978, a B-29 Superfortress named &quot;It&#x27;s Hawg Wild&quot; in 1980 and a B-52 Stratofortress in 1983. With Duxford&#x27;s association with the US Army Air Forces (USAAF), in the mid-1980s plans developed for a commemoration of the role of American air power in the Second World War. A group of American supporters was formed, and the architect Norman Foster was commissioned to design a new building. Fundraising for the project began in 1987, support and funds being sought in the United States; the Founding Member was General Jimmy Doolittle in 1989. Fundraising events were held across the US in Houston (1989), Washington, D.C., (1991) and Los Angeles (1992). The project was widely supported in the United States by some 50,000 individual subscribers. A further $1 million of funding was secured from Saudi Arabia, and £6.5 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund. On 8 September 1995 the groundbreaking for the new building was performed by wartime 78th Fighter Group veteran, Major James E Stokes.

===Architecture and construction===
The American Air Museum was designed by Norman Foster and Chris Wise at Arup. The museum&#x27;s specification called for a landmark building that would provide a neutral backdrop for the aircraft collection and provide appropriate climatic controls while being cost efficient to operate. The building is shaped as a section of a torus, formed from a curved concrete roof wide, high and deep. The dimensions of the building were dictated by the need to accommodate the museum&#x27;s B-52 Stratofortress bomber with its wingspan and a tail high. The roof was constructed as a double-layered concrete shell, built in 924 precast reinforced concrete sections. Inverted T-shaped sections provided the inner layer with further flat panels forming the outer layer.

The roof weighs and is able to support suspended aircraft weighing up to . A glass wall, demountable to permit aircraft to be rearranged, allows in daylight, thereby reducing lighting costs and enabling the aircraft to be seen from outside the building. It also allows visitors inside the museum to watch aircraft landing or taking off. From a visitor&#x27;s perspective, the pedestrian entrance leads to a mezzanine floor level with the cockpit of the museum&#x27;s B-52, while the lack of supporting columns allows aircraft to hang from the ceiling. Heavier aircraft stand on the floor of the building, which covers . Construction began with the building of abutments in October 1995 and the roof was completed in September 1996. The building won the 1998 Stirling Prize for Foster and Partners and was described by the judges as &quot;a great big, clear span hangar of a building...dramatic, awe-inspiring, an object of beauty...simple yet replete with imagery.&quot;

===Opening and re-dedication===
The American Air Museum was opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 1 August 1997. The total cost of the project had been £13.5 million. The museum was re-dedicated on 27 September 2002, in a ceremony attended by the then Prince Charles &amp; former President George H. W. Bush. Since being opened, the museum has had its glass front temporarily removed to permit access for an SR-71 Blackbird and Consolidated B-24 Liberator. The SR-71, serial number 61-7962, is the only example of its type on display outside the United States, and set a flight altitude record of 85,069 feet (25,929m) in July 1976. Besides the Blackbird, nineteen other American aircraft are on display. Notable examples include a C-47 Skytrain which flew with the 316th Troop Carrier Group and participated in three major Second World War airborne operations; the June 1944 Normandy landings, Operation Market Garden and Operation Varsity, the airborne crossing of the River Rhine in March 1945. The museum&#x27;s B-29 flew during the Korean War as part of the 7th Bomb Wing; it is the only example in Europe and one of only two preserved in museums outside the United States. The B-52 flew 200 sorties during the Vietnam War as part of the 28th Bomb Wing. The General Dynamics F-111 on display flew 19 missions during the 1991 Gulf War as part of the 77th Fighter Squadron.

On 17 January 2014 the museum announced an award of £980,000 from the Heritage Lottery Fund. The museum planned to use the money to build a website based on the photographic collection of aviation historian Roger Freeman, to update the museum&#x27;s interpretation, and to conserve aircraft and other exhibits. The museum launched &quot;americanairmuseum.com&quot; in October 2014. The website seeks to crowdsource photographs and information from the public about the men and women of the US Army Air Forces who served from the UK in the Second World War and the British people who befriended them.

==Land Warfare Hall==
The Land Warfare Hall was opened on 28 September 1992 by Field Marshal Lord Bramall on behalf of Prime Minister John Major. The building provides accommodation for the Imperial War Museum&#x27;s collection of armoured vehicles, artillery and military vehicles. Also included are vehicles belonging to the Duxford Aviation Society Military Vehicle Section. The hall comprises a viewing balcony that runs for most of the length of the hall, providing views over a range of tableaux of vehicles, tanks and artillery that run chronologically from the First World War to the present day. Notable among the First World War exhibits is a battle-damaged artillery limber used by L Battery Royal Horse Artillery during an action at Néry in September 1914 where three Victoria Crosses were won. The Second World War in particular is illustrated with tableaux of the North African Campaign, the Eastern Front and the invasion of Normandy. Outside the building is a Whale floating roadway bridge span from Mulberry B harbour at Arromanches.

Significant vehicles in the collection include three command vehicles used by Field Marshal Montgomery, commander of 21st Army Group during the north-west Europe campaign. Also on display are extracts from Montgomery&#x27;s personal papers, which are held by the Imperial War Museum&#x27;s Department of Documents. Other tableaux depict scenes from post-1945 conflicts such as the Korean War, the Northern Ireland Troubles, the Falklands War, British peacekeeping contributions in Bosnia and the Gulf War. As many of the vehicles in the Land Warfare Hall are maintained in running condition, the site features garages and a running area behind the building. 

Various diorama are exhibited, including of the Battle of the Tennis Court.

===Forgotten War===
The Land Warfare Hall also houses the Forgotten War exhibition, which opened on 25 March 1999 and was a joint project between the Imperial War Museum and the Burma Star Association. The Association represents veterans of the Burma campaign who often consider themselves to have fought in a &quot;Forgotten Army&quot; compared to those who fought in Europe. The exhibition explores aspects of the Second World War in the Far East and features artifacts, archival film and photographs, and tableaux depicting scenes such as troops moving through jungle and a Burmese village. The exhibition was supported financially by the Burma Star Association and by £126,000 from the National Heritage Memorial Fund.

===Royal Anglian Regiment Museum and Memorial===
The Land Warfare Hall also accommodates the Royal Anglian Regiment Museum. The Royal Anglian Regiment was formed in 1964 by the amalgamation of the three regiments of the East Anglian Brigade and the Royal Leicestershire Regiment. The museum was opened in June 1996 by noted war correspondent Martin Bell, who had previously served as a sergeant in the Suffolk Regiment while a national serviceman. The museum covers the history of the Regiment and its predecessors, which date back to the seventeenth century, up to recent operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and Sierra Leone. Alongside the museum is the Cambridgeshire Regiment Exhibition, which displays items from the Cambridgeshire Regiment collection. Exhibits include the Singapore Drums, lost at the fall of Singapore in 1942 and recovered after the war.

On 12 September 2010 a Royal Anglian Regiment memorial was dedicated at Duxford. A fundraising campaign, which raised more than £340,000, was launched following the deaths in action of nine soldiers of 1st Battalion Royal Anglian Regiment during the unit&#x27;s 2007 operational tour in Helmand Province, Afghanistan. The memorial is inscribed with the names of 78 soldiers killed since 1958 (when the first of the three East Anglian regiments was formed) in conflicts including Afghanistan, Iraq, Northern Ireland and Aden. The dedication was attended by more than 5,000 people.

==North side: collections storage==
In addition to the exhibition buildings, Duxford&#x27;s &#x27;North Side&#x27;, the area of the site north of the A505 road, provides storage for the Imperial War Museum&#x27;s collecting departments. The stored collections include the film collection, which includes reels existing on nitrate film stock, which is highly flammable and subject to decomposition, kept in purpose-built vaults at nearby Ickleton. Other collections stored at Duxford&#x27;s north side include books, maps, ephemera, photographs, documents and collections of uniforms and equipment.

<text>Carlos Javier Meléndez Sauri (born 10 April 1965 in Hato Rey, Puerto Rico) is a Puerto Rican architect and singer who is a former member of Menudo.

Meléndez is a cousin of band creator Edgardo Diaz, who had success as director of La Pandilla in Spain and who admired the success obtained by The Jackson 5 in the United States. Carlos Meléndez and his brothers, Oscar and Ricky, wore curly hair, a style which was popular during the 1970s.

In 1977, Diaz created Menudo, asking Carlos and his brothers to become band members, along with Fernando and Nefty Sallaberry, who are also brothers. Carlos Meléndez lasted in Menudo until mid 1980, barely missing out on the group&#x27;s golden era. The only Meléndez brother to participate during Menudo&#x27;s era of worldwide fame was Ricky. Like Oscar, Carlos Meléndez did, however, become famous through Puerto Rico when the group began to have a televised show, and with two of Menudo&#x27;s first hits: a Spanish version of ABBA&#x27;s &quot;Voulez Vous&quot; and &quot;Los Fantasmas&quot;. Carlos Meléndez tried a duo singing career with Fernando Sallaberry for a brief time after leaving Menudo. He did not record any major hits by himself, however, and soon, retired from music. 

In 1987, 4 of the original 5 Menudo members, Carlos &amp; Ricky Meléndez, and Nefty and Fernando Sallaberry reunited on a project - a group- they were going to call XCHANGE. There was some publicity, and they recorded a few demos, but were not offered a recording contract and disbanded.

Carlos Melendez is an architect who resides in Florida.

== In pop culture ==
Melendez is played by Leyson Andreck Brito in the 2020 Amazon Prime Video series based on Menudo, &quot;Subete A Mi Moto&quot;.

<text>A melt sandwich is a type of hot sandwich containing a suitable meltable cheese (sometimes grated) and a filling of meat or fish. The sandwich is grilled on the stovetop until the cheese melts (hence the name) and the bread is toasted, or heated in an oven.

One common type is the tuna melt, a melt sandwich filled with canned tuna that has been mixed with mayonnaise (tuna mayo) and other ingredients such as pickles, tomato, and onion. Other popular choices are ham, roast beef, chicken, turkey, or a ground beef patty (for a patty melt). Both patty melts and tuna melts are staples of the traditional American diner; patty melts were commonly found on menus by the 1940s, and tuna melts by the 1960s.

<text>The 1898 VFL season was the second season of the Victorian Football League (VFL), the highest-level senior Australian rules football competition in Victoria. The season featured eight clubs and ran from 14 May to 24 September, comprising a 14-round home-and-away season followed by a finals series featuring all eight clubs.

 won the premiership, defeating by 15 points in the 1898 VFL grand final; it was Fitzroy&#x27;s first VFL premiership. Essendon won the minor premiership by finishing atop the home-and-away ladder with an 11–3 win–loss record. &#x27;s Archie Smith won the leading goalkicker medal as the league&#x27;s leading goalkicker.

==Background==
In 1898, the VFL competition consisted of eight teams of 20 on-the-field players each, with no &quot;reserves&quot; (although any of the 20 players who had left the playing field for any reason could later resume their place on the field at any time during the match).

Each team played each other twice in a home-and-away season of 14 rounds.

Once the 14 round home-and-away season had finished, the 1898 VFL &quot;Premiers&quot; were determined by the specific format and conventions of the 1898 VFL finals system.

==Win–loss table==
The following table can be sorted from biggest winning margin to biggest losing margin for each round. If two or more matches in a round are decided by the same margin, these margins are sorted by percentage (i.e. the lowest-scoring winning team is ranked highest and the lowest-scoring losing team is ranked lowest). Opponents are listed above the margins and home matches are in bold.

By winning the minor premiership and accruing at least eight premiership points from its three sectional matches, Essendon won the right to challenge the semi-final winner for the premiership.

<doc id="1152126" wikidata="Q829984" url="?curid=1152126" title="Mathematics Genealogy Project">
<text>The Mathematics Genealogy Project (MGP) is a web-based database for the academic genealogy of mathematicians. it contained information on 300,152 mathematical scientists who contributed to research-level mathematics. For a typical mathematician, the project entry includes graduation year, thesis title (in its Mathematics Subject Classification), &quot;alma mater&quot;, doctoral advisor, and doctoral students.

==Origin of the database==
The project grew out of founder Harry Coonce&#x27;s desire to know the name of his advisor&#x27;s advisor. Coonce was Professor of Mathematics at Minnesota State University, Mankato, at the time of the project&#x27;s founding, and the project went online there in the autumn of 1997. Coonce retired from Mankato in 1999, and in the autumn of 2002 the university decided that it would no longer support the project. The project relocated at that time to North Dakota State University. Since 2003, the project has also operated under the auspices of the American Mathematical Society and in 2005 it received a grant from the Clay Mathematics Institute. Harry Coonce has been assisted by Mitchel T. Keller, Assistant Professor at Morningside College. Keller is currently the Managing Director of the project.

==Mission and scope==
The Mathematics Genealogy Mission statement: &quot;Throughout this project when we use the word &#x27;mathematics&#x27; or &#x27;mathematician&#x27; we mean that word in a very inclusive sense. Thus, all relevant data from statistics, computer science, philosophy or operations research is welcome.&quot;

== Scope ==
The genealogy information is obtained from sources such as &quot;Dissertation Abstracts International&quot; and &quot;Notices of the American Mathematical Society&quot;, but may be supplied by anyone via the project&#x27;s website. The searchable database contains the name of the mathematician, university which awarded the degree, year when the degree was awarded, title of the dissertation, names of the advisor and second advisor, a flag of the country where the degree was awarded, a listing of doctoral students, and a count of academic descendants. Some historically significant figures who lacked a doctoral degree are listed, notably Joseph-Louis Lagrange and Isaac Newton.

The oldest chronological entries in the project are Abu Sahl &#x27;Isa ibn Yahya al-Masihi (who died c. 1010) and his student Ibn Sina, commonly known in the West as Avicenna. They each have, as of May 2024, more than 220,000 descendants in the genealogy.

==Reliability and completeness==
It has been noted that &quot;the data collected by the mathematics genealogy project are self-reported, so there is no guarantee that the observed genealogy network is a complete description of the mentorship network. In fact, 16,147 mathematicians do not have a recorded mentor, and of these, 8,336 do not have any recorded proteges.&quot; Maimgren, Ottino and Amaral (2010) stated that &quot;for [mathematicians who graduated between 1900 and 1960] we believe that the graduation and mentorship record is the most reliable.&quot;

<text>Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe ( , ; 6 March 1940 – 28 January 2007) was a French philosopher. He was also a literary critic and translator. Lacoue-Labarthe published several influential works with his friend Jean-Luc Nancy.

Lacoue-Labarthe was influenced by and wrote extensively on Martin Heidegger, Jacques Derrida, Jacques Lacan, German Romanticism, Paul Celan, and Gérard Granel. He also translated works by Heidegger, Celan, Friedrich Nietzsche, Friedrich Hölderlin, and Walter Benjamin into French.

Lacoue-Labarthe was a member and president of the Collège international de philosophie.

==Work==
===Collaboration with Jean-Luc Nancy===
Lacoue-Labarthe wrote several books and articles in collaboration with Jean-Luc Nancy, a colleague at the Université Marc Bloch in Strasbourg. Early collaborations included &quot;Le Titre de la lettre: une lecture de Lacan&quot; (1973; trans., &quot;The Title of the Letter: A Reading of Lacan&quot;) and &quot;L&#x27;Absolu littéraire: théorie de la littérature du romantisme allemand&quot; (1978; trans., &quot;The Literary Absolute: The Theory of Literature in German Romanticism&quot;).

In 1980 Lacoue-Labarthe and Nancy organized a conference at Cerisy-la-Salle, centered around Derrida&#x27;s 1968 paper &quot;Les fins de l&#x27;homme&quot;. Following this conference and at Derrida&#x27;s request, in November 1980 Lacoue-Labarthe and Nancy founded the &quot;Centre de recherches philosophiques sur le politique&quot; (Centre for Philosophical Research on the Political). The Centre operated for four years, pursuing philosophical rather than empirical approaches to political questions. During that period Lacoue-Labarthe and Nancy produced several important papers, together and separately. Some of these texts appear in &quot;Les Fins de l&#x27;homme à partir du travail de Jacques Derrida: colloque de Cerisy, 23 juillet-2 août 1980&quot; (1981), &quot;Rejouer le politique&quot; (1981), &quot;La retrait du politique&quot; (1983), and &quot;Le mythe nazi&quot; (1991, revised edition; originally published as &quot;Les méchanismes du fascisme&quot;, 1981). Many of these texts are gathered in translation in &quot;Retreating the Political&quot; (1997).

===On Martin Heidegger===
In 1986 Lacoue-Labarthe published a book on Celan and Heidegger entitled &quot;La poésie comme expérience&quot; (1986; trans., &quot;Poetry as Experience&quot;). Lacoue-Labarthe received his &quot;doctorat d&#x27;état&quot; in 1987 with a jury led by Gérard Granel and including Derrida, George Steiner and Jean-François Lyotard. The monograph submitted for that degree was &quot;La fiction du politique&quot; (1988; trans., &quot;Heidegger, Art, and Politics&quot;), a study of Heidegger&#x27;s relation to National Socialism. These works predate the explosion of interest in the political dimensions of Heidegger&#x27;s thought which followed the publication of a book by Victor Farías.

In &quot;Poetry as Experience&quot; Lacoue-Labarthe argued that, even though Celan&#x27;s poetry was deeply informed by Heidegger&#x27;s philosophy, Celan was long aware of Heidegger&#x27;s association with the Nazi party and therefore fundamentally circumspect toward the man and transformative in his reception of his work. Celan was nonetheless willing to meet Heidegger. Heidegger was a professed admirer of Celan&#x27;s writing, although Celan&#x27;s poetry never received the kind of philosophical attention which Heidegger gave to the work of poets such as Friedrich Hölderlin or Georg Trakl. Celan&#x27;s poem &quot;Todtnauberg,&quot; however, seems to hold out the possibility of a rapprochement between their work. In this respect Heidegger&#x27;s work was perhaps redeemable for Celan, even if that redemption was not played out in the encounter between the two men. 
Lacoue-Labarthe considered that Heidegger&#x27;s greatest failure was not his involvement in the National Socialist movement but his &quot;silence on the extermination&quot; and his refusal to engage in a thorough deconstruction of Nazism. He also believed, however, that Heidegger&#x27;s thought offers pathways to a philosophical confrontation with Nazism, pathways which Heidegger failed to follow, but which Lacoue-Labarthe did attempt to pursue.

== Theatrical work ==
Lacoue-Labarthe was also involved in theatrical productions. He translated Hölderlin&#x27;s version of &quot;Antigone&quot;, and collaborated with to stage the work at the on 15 and 30 June 1978. Lacoue-Labarthe and Deutsch returned to the Théâtre national de Strasbourg to collaborate on a 1980 production of Euripides&#x27; &quot;Phoenician Women&quot;. Lacoue-Labarthe&#x27;s translation of Hölderlin&#x27;s version of &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; was staged in Avignon in 1998, with Charles Berling in the title role.

<text>Giorgio Perlasca (31 January 1910 – 15 August 1992) was an Italian businessman. With the collaboration of official diplomats, he posed as the Spanish consul-general to Hungary in the winter of 1944, and saved 5,218 Jews from deportation to Nazi extermination camps in eastern Europe. In 1989, Perlasca was designated by Israel as a Righteous Among the Nations.

==Early life==
Perlasca was born in Como and grew up in Maserà, province of Padua, Italy. During the 1920s, he became a supporter of Italian Fascism, fighting in East Africa during the Second Italo-Abyssinian War, and in the Spanish Civil War for the Nationalist &quot;Corpo Truppe Volontarie&quot;. As a gratitude safe conduct for his service in Spain, he was awarded a diplomatic mission from Francisco Franco.

Perlasca grew disillusioned with fascism, in particular, due to Benito Mussolini&#x27;s alliance with Nazism and adoption of Italian racial laws that came into force in 1938.

==In World War II==
During the initial phase of World War II, he worked at procuring supplies for the Italian Army in the Balkans. He was later appointed as an official delegate of the Italian government with diplomatic status and sent to Eastern Europe with the mission of buying meat for the Italian army fighting on the Russian front. On 8 September 1943, Italy surrendered to the Allies. Italians had to choose whether to join Mussolini&#x27;s newly formed Italian Social Republic, which was fascist, or stay loyal to the King and join the Allied side. Perlasca chose the latter.

In Budapest, he was arrested and confined to a castle reserved for diplomats. After a few months, he used a medical pass that allowed him to travel within Hungary and requested political asylum at the Spanish Embassy. He took advantage of his status as a veteran of the Spanish war, adopted the first name of &quot;Jorge&quot; and, since Spain was neutral in the war, he became a free man.

Perlasca worked with the Spanish Chargé d&#x27;Affaires, Ángel Sanz Briz, and other diplomats of neutral states to smuggle Jews out of Hungary. The system he devised consisted of furnishing &quot;protection cards&quot; which placed Jews under the guardianship of various neutral states. He helped Jews find refuge in protected houses under the control of various embassies, which had extraterritorial conventions that gave them an equivalent to sovereignty. They could provide asylum for Jews.

When Sanz Briz left Hungary at night in November 1944, he did not tell Perlasca that he was going to leave, and Perlasca chose to remain in Hungary. The Hungarian government ordered the Spanish Embassy building and the extraterritorial houses where the Jews took refuge to be cleared out. Perlasca immediately made the false announcement that Sanz Briz was due to return from a short leave, and that he had been appointed as chargé d&#x27;affaires for the meantime. Throughout the winter, Perlasca was active in hiding, shielding and feeding thousands of Jews in Budapest. He continued issuing safe conduct passes as initiated by Spanish government, on the basis of a Spanish decree passed 20 December 1924 that granted citizenship to Jews of Sephardic origin (descendants of Iberian Jews expelled from Spain in the late 15th century), but it had been canceled in 1930, a fact the Hungarian authorities were not aware of.

In December 1944, Perlasca rescued two boys from being herded onto a freight train in defiance of a German lieutenant colonel on the scene. The Swedish diplomat-rescuer Raoul Wallenberg, also present there, later told Perlasca that the officer who had challenged him was Adolf Eichmann. Over 45 days, from 1 December 1944 to 16 January 1945, Perlasca helped save more than 5,000 Jews.

According to Perlasca, he also prevented the execution of a plan to raze the Budapest Ghetto with around 60,000 people in it, as the Nazis had done in Warsaw. While Perlasca was posing as the Spanish consul-general, he learned of the intentions of the SS and the far-right Hungarian Arrow Cross to destroy the ghetto. He asked for a direct hearing with the Hungarian interior minister, Gábor Vajna, and threatened him with legal and economic measures against the &quot;3,000 Hungarian citizens&quot; (in fact, a much smaller number) declared by Perlasca as residents of Spain, unless Vajna withdrew the plan. After this episode, the plan to raze the Budapest Ghetto was cancelled.

== After the war==
After the war, Perlasca managed to return to Italy only in August 1945. On 5 June 1945, while still in Istanbul, he delivered a first brief report on his activity to the Spanish consul general in Turkey, in order to prevent any legal charges for his actions on behalf of the Spanish embassy. Back home, Perlasca drew up a detailed memorandum of the events, dated 13 October 1945, and sent it to the Spanish foreign minister in Madrid and to the Italian government, keeping a copy for himself. He also wrote to Sanz Briz, the ambassador who he had replaced in Budapest, who laconically replied, warning Perlasca not to expect recognition for his work.

Perlasca didn&#x27;t tell his story publicly or even to his family, but rather turned to those he considered might be the only appropriate recipients. The few institutional bodies to which he wrote, however, ignored him for diplomatic and political reasons or due to a simple lack of interest. Even the Jewish historian Jenő Lévai, who asked for a copy of the Perlasca&#x27;s memorandum in 1946 and then contributed to spread his name, omitted to tell Perlasca&#x27;s story in his &quot;Black Book&quot;, presumably for political reasons. Back home, Perlasca was also asked to pay with his own money for an expensive car (a Fiat 500 &quot;Topolino&quot;) which he had rented during the rescue of the Jews and had been destroyed in the Soviet siege of Budapest; Perlasca later struggled to make ends meet.

Only in 1961, on the occasion of the media clamor around the Eichmann trial, did the Resto del Carlino newspaper publish a first article by Giuseppe Cerato that told Perlasca&#x27;s story, without resonance; the same happened with an article by Furio Colombo published in the end of the 1960s on La Stampa.

Perlasca never yearned for fame or explicitly hid his story; he simply told it to those he thought might be the appropriate recipient, and then lived his life. Only in 1980 did Perlasca&#x27;s family learn of the memorandum he drafted, after Perlasca had a stroke, when he decided to talk about it to his closest relatives, but he continued to keep it private once he recovered. The family eventually learned of the contents of the memorandum in 1987, when the story became public.

In 1987, a group of Hungarian Jews whom Perlasca had saved finally found him after searching for him for 42 years in Spain. There was wide publicity at the time over the event, and Perlasca became noted for his heroic deeds. Enrico Deaglio wrote an account of his remarkable heroism, &quot;Banality of Goodness&quot; (2002), which became a bestseller. The book was adapted as a made-for-TV film, &quot;Perlasca – Un eroe Italiano&quot; (2005), by the RAI national television corporation, not to be confused with the 1993 movie &quot;Perlasca&quot;. In 1989, Perlasca was awarded by the Hungarian parliament in its plenary session with the highest national honor. The following year Perlasca received acclaim in the United States and was welcomed by dozens of journalists and some survivors (Eva Lang, Avrham Ronai) in Washington, when the Holocaust Museum awarded him as Righteous Among the Nations.

In October 1991, Perlasca was awarded the title Grand Ufficiale of the Italian Republic; the Senate approved the grant of a life pension for notable Italian senior citizens in financial difficulty (via the ), but Perlasca declined the grant.

Perlasca died of a heart attack in Padua on 15 August 1992.

<text>Maria Alexandrovna Spiridonova (; 16 October 1884 – 11 September 1941) was a Narodnik-inspired Russian revolutionary. In 1906, as a novice member of a local combat group of the Tambov Socialists-Revolutionaries (SRs), she assassinated a security official. Her subsequent abuse by police earned her enormous popularity with the opponents of Tsarism throughout the empire and even abroad.

After spending over 11 years in Siberian prisons she was freed after the February Revolution of 1917, and returned to European Russia as a heroine of the destitute, and especially of the peasants. According to G.D.H. Cole, she was, along with Alexandra Kollontai, one of the most prominent women leaders during the Russian Revolution, leading the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries to initially side with Vladimir Lenin and the Bolsheviks, and then to break with them.

From 1918 on, Spiridonova faced repression from the Soviet government, as she was repeatedly arrested, imprisoned, briefly detained in a mental sanitarium, and sent into internal exile, before being shot in 1941. A successful campaign was run to discredit her name and portray her as a hysterical extremist, and she was &quot;forced into oblivion&quot;. In 1958, when publishing the fourth volume of &quot;A History of Socialist Thought&quot;, G.D.H. Cole wrote that nothing was known of what had happened to her after 1920. Twenty years later, Richard Stites was still uncertain whether her death occurred in 1937 or 1941. Only after the end of Stalinism and the fall of the Soviet Union did it gradually become possible to reconstruct the last decades of her life.

==Biography==
=== Early life ===

Spiridonova was born in the city of Tambov, located approximately south-southeast of Moscow. Her father, a bank official, was a member of the non-hereditary minor nobility of the Russian Empire. She attended the local gymnasium until 1902, when the death of her father, and a case of tuberculosis, caused her to drop out. She studied dentistry in Moscow for a short while, before returning to Tambov to work as a clerk for the local Assembly of the Nobility. She soon became involved in political activism and was arrested during the student demonstrations of March 1905. In September 1905 she applied for training as a feldsher (a health care professional similar to a physician assistant) but was rejected due to her political record. Instead, she joined the Party of Socialists–Revolutionaries (SRs) and became a full-time activist. During this time, she formed a relationship with Vladimir Vol&#x27;skii, a local SR leader.

Like most SRs, she shared the Narodniks&#x27; philosophy of assassination and terrorism as a weapon of revolution, and was one of hundreds of SRs who, in the years around the 1905 Revolution, attacked the Russian state and its leaders.

===Luzhenovsky assassination===

Spiridonova&#x27;s target was , a landowner and Tambov provincial councillor who had been appointed district security chief in Borisoglebsk, a town southeast of Tambov. Luzhenovsky, also a local leader of the Union of the Russian People (the most important branch of the Black Hundred), was known for his harsh suppression of peasant unrest in the district, and the SR committee in Tambov had &quot;passed a death sentence on him&quot;. Spiridonova volunteered to kill him. She stalked Luzhenovsky for several days, and finally got her chance at the Borisoglebsk railway station on 16 January 1906. Disguised as a secondary school student, she fired several shots from a revolver and hit Luzhenovsky five times. He died on 10 February 1906.

Unable to escape, Spiridonova tried to shoot herself but was restrained, brutally beaten and arrested by Luzhenovsky&#x27;s Cossack guard. She was then transferred to the local police station where she was stripped naked, searched and mocked by her captors. She was interrogated and tortured for more than half a day by two government officials, P.F. Avramov, head of the Cossack guard, and T.S. Zhdanov, a local police officer. That night she was transported to Tambov by train. During the journey, Avramov subjected her to further ill-treatment and sexual harassment, possibly rape.

The Luzhenovsky assassination was one of close to two hundred acts of SR &quot;individual terror&quot; during the 1905 Revolution and the two following years&#x27; turmoil. It received mainly local attention until the following month, when Spiridonova succeeded in leaking a very well-thought-out letter to the press. It described the treatment she had received, including threats of gang rape directed at her, and hinted that Avramov might have raped her on the train to Tambov. The letter was published on 12 February 1906 by &quot;Rus&quot;, a liberal newspaper in Saint Petersburg, and soon taken up by others, becoming an immediate sensation with their readers.

Progressive public opinion in Russia traditionally tended to consider terrorism with a certain degree of understanding, as it was regarded as a natural reaction against autocracy. For example, in 1878, a jury caused a sensation by acquitting populist terrorist Vera Zasulich despite her pleading guilty to causing serious injury to Colonel Fyodor Trepov during a failed attempt to assassinate him. In the case of Spiridonova, many were outraged by the appalling cruelty to a prisoner, especially as she was an attractive young woman. Liberal circles throughout Russia condemned the Tambov authorities. Spiridonova was described as &quot;a pure, virginal being, a flower of spiritual beauty [...] [being put] into the shaggy paws of brutally repulsive, brutally malicious, brutally salacious orangutans&quot;.
&quot;Rus&quot; sent reporter Vsevolod A. Vladimirov to Tambov. He produced seven sensational articles that appeared in March 1906. These articles exaggerated Spiridonova&#x27;s mistreatment and injuries, and more explicitly touched on her alleged rape. Vladimirov also glossed over Spiridonova&#x27;s political convictions, portraying her as a genteel, high-principled victim of the tyrannical Russian system. This annoyed the Tambov SRs almost as much as it did the conservatives and the authorities. Spiridonova herself repudiated Vladimirov&#x27;s account.

On 11 March, Spiridonova was tried and convicted of Luzhenovsky&#x27;s murder and sentenced to death. However, the tribunal also asked that the sentence be commuted to penal servitude in Siberia, in view of her ill health. This was approved on 20 March. The liberal press continued its campaign in her support. On 2 April, Avramov was himself assassinated, creating a further sensation.

The government released its report on the case on 8 April. The report acknowledged that Spiridonova had been beaten by the Cossacks at the time of her arrest and that Avramov had verbally abused her on the train, but denied all the more lurid accusations. This was denounced by some as a whitewash.

Secret letters from Spiridonova in prison to her sister Yulia, a fellow SR, had been seized by police on 19 February and were summarized by the Tambov deputy prosecutor in a report to the national authorities. His extracts indicate that Spiridonova consciously participated in the image-making that was going on outside, suggesting what should be emphasized and what should be played down. A request in one letter not to reveal her &quot;romantic history&quot;, presumably her relationship with Volsky, was quoted. Many liberals called this an attempt to slander her morals. The governor of Tambov had known about the affair (Spiridonova appealed for a meeting with Volsky, whom she described as her fiancé although he was already married), but did not pass on the information, which would have demolished Spiridonova&#x27;s &quot;virginal&quot; image.

Spiridonova was sent to Siberia in the company of five other prominent female SR terrorists. The group was sometimes called the &quot;Shesterka&quot; (&quot;Six&quot;). As a result of the press campaign, Spiridonova was the most famous. She was also young, attractive, and an ethnic Russian (at least four of the others were Jewish, Belarusian, and Ukrainian). The &quot;Shesterka&quot; were transported by train from Moscow to the Nerchinsk katorga, a system of penal labor colonies in Transbaikal (east of Lake Baikal and near the border of China). Their slow journey lasted around a month and turned into a kind of triumphal progress: the train was met at every stop by growing crowds of sympathizers. Each time, although she was suffering from a serious recurrence of tuberculosis, Spiridonova would get up from her couch, greet the audience with smiles and patiently answer their numerous questions, expounding the SR political program. Aleksandra Izmailovich, one of the &quot;Shesterka&quot;, later commented:

Spiridonova and her comrades were first detained in the Akatuy penal colony. The prison regime of the colony was exceedingly mild, more similar to a sort of internal exile or political confinement than to a real prison. In 1907, however, they were moved to the new female colony that had been established at Maltsev, another centre of the Nerchinsk katorga. Here the rules of detention were somewhat stricter, though not so extreme as in &quot;the regimes of punishment and mistreatment that &#x27;politicals&#x27; endured elsewhere&quot; (including beatings, floggings and isolation in dark, freezing cells). &quot;For the Maltsev women there was no forced labor, only enforced isolation from the outside world in which each day was like the next and the one that had gone before&quot;.

In 1908, a young Ukrainian maximalist, Irina Konstantinovna Kakhovskaya, arrived at Maltsev. She had been convicted of involvement in a terrorist group. Kakhovskaya was a descendant of Decembrist revolutionary Pyotr Grigoryevich Kakhovsky, who had been hanged in 1826 for assassinating Saint Petersburg Governor Mikhail Andreyevich Miloradovich and another Grenadier officer. She formed a special friendship with Spiridonova and Izmailovich, a bond of political and personal sisterhood that would last throughout their lives.

In April 1911, 28 female inmates, including Spiridonova, were transferred back to Akatuy where the conditions of their detention were further worsened and they were forced to work in a bookbindery. The constant physical work, however, was eventually welcomed by the detainees and made their prison life more tolerable.

===Left SR leader===
====Accommodation with the revolution====
After the February Revolution of 1917, Spiridinova was released from incarceration at the women&#x27;s Akatuy prison by a general amnesty covering imprisoned political criminals. According to Alexander Rabinowitch, Spiridonova was widely esteemed by the common people of Russia, being venerated by many peasants as very nearly a saint.

Spiridonova traveled from Siberia to Moscow to attend the 3rd National Congress of the Party of Socialists-Revolutionaries (the SRs) late in May 1917, but she was not elected to the governing Central Committee of the party. Despite this failure, Spiridonova became deeply involved in party affairs as a leader of the SR left wing and of the party&#x27;s organization in the capital city of Petrograd. She was also involved in work helping to establish soviets amongst the peasantry.

Following the October Revolution, Spiridonova cast her lot with the Left SRs, who had split from their old party and sided with their erstwhile rivals of the Bolshevik Party. She was extremely supportive of efforts to forge a unity government between the Bolsheviks, the Left SRs, and the other socialist parties represented in the Soviets, but when it proved impossible to reach a general agreement, she supported the Left SRs entering into a coalition government with only the Bolsheviks. Her name was included by the railroad union (Vikzhel) in a list of possible candidate ministers for the unity government, but she did not take a ministerial role in the new Bolshevik-Left SR government. Instead, she was appointed head of the Peasant Section of the Central Executive Committee of the All-Russian Soviet of Workers&#x27;, Peasants&#x27;, and Soldiers&#x27; Deputies (VTsIK), making her nominally a chief official over peasant affairs. She was later one of a handful of Left SR leaders offering early support for Lenin&#x27;s decision to agree to the draconian peace terms offered by the government of Imperial Germany in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. As the head of the Peasant Section of the VTsIK, Spiridonova appeared almost exclusively focused on winning the approval of the soviets and enforcement of an SR-inspired law of land socialization, constituting agrarian reform. The law was eventually passed on 19 February 1918. Consequently, for some months she strived primarily to safeguard the alliance with the Bolsheviks, even at the cost of being temporarily sidelined within her own party.

On 18 January 1918, at the inaugural meeting of the Constituent Assembly, both the Left SRs and the Bolsheviks proposed Spiridonova as their candidate for the chair, but centrist SR Víktor Mikhailovich Chernov was elected instead. The Assembly was dissolved for good after the end of that same first session.

====Revolt against Bolshevism====
The honeymoon between Spiridonova (and the Left SRs generally) and the Bolsheviks was short-lived. Late in the spring of 1918, Bolshevik military detachments were formed to conduct forced requisitions of grain in a desperate effort to stave off famine in the cities amidst economic collapse. &quot;The brutal Bolshevik grain-procurement policy and the devastating impact on the peasantry of the Soviet government&#x27;s vast territorial and increasingly onerous economic concessions to Imperial Germany&quot; caused widespread discontent in the countryside and the Peasant Section of the VTsIK was overwhelmed with complaints and protests. As head of the Section, Spiridonova was especially aware of the deepening misery of peasants throughout the country. Unity between Left SRs and Bolsheviks turned to rivalry over the future of the revolution and a competition ensued for control of the 5th Congress of Soviets, scheduled to begin in Moscow on 4 July 1918.

Historian Alexander Rabinowitch summarized the prelude to what he would later term &quot;the suicide of the Left SRs&quot; in his work on the first year of Soviet rule in Petrograd:
On 7 July 1918, two members of the Left SR Party, Iakov Bliumkin and , assassinated German ambassador Wilhelm Mirbach. Spiridonova immediately assumed the &quot;political&quot; responsibility for the attack on behalf of the party&#x27;s Central Committee. In her 1937 letter to the NKVD (see below), she claimed also to have directed the attack (even showing a sort of &quot;professional&#x27; pride).

The confrontation with the government, however, did not evolve as the Left SR leadership expected. At the time of Mirbach&#x27;s assassination, the Left SRs enjoyed undoubted military superiority in the Moscow area and within the Cheka, but they &quot;showed no inclination to press home&quot; this advantage: they appeared &quot;much less interested in seizing power themselves than they were in calling for a popular uprising to force the Bolsheviks to change their policies. The Left SRs had no idea where this uprising would end up: they were happy to leave that to the &#x27;revolutionary creativity of the masses&#x27;.&quot; For his part, Lenin, far from fueling a new conflagration with Germany, used Mirbach&#x27;s assassination as a pretext for the suppression of the Left SR organization, the terrorist attack being immediately portrayed as a straightforward uprising against Soviet power. Lenin promptly summoned Jukums Vācietis, the commander of the Latvian Riflemen, now headquartered in the outskirts of the capital, and secured their support; albeit not immediately available, they were the only military forces capable of effectively opposing the units controlled by the Left Social Revolutionaries. While the latter continued &quot;to rise up&quot; without even moving from their barracks, Spiridonova and her comrades hastened to the Bolshoi Theatre, where she delivered an inflamed speech against the Bolshevik regime before the ongoing Congress of Soviets, which they evidently regarded as the supreme authority in the Soviet republic. In the meantime, the theatre security forces proceeded to seal the building and detain all the Left SR delegates therein. Later, the Bolsheviks recaptured the Cheka headquarters at the Lubyanka and overcame the Cheka Combat Detachment commanded by Left SR Dmitry Popov, the unit that had taken over the Pokrovsky barracks and arrested Felix Dzerzhinsky when he had gone there to arrest Mirbach&#x27;s assassins. Thus ended the Left SR uprising, and historian Orlando Figes notes that &quot;it was not a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; but—not unlike the Bolsheviks&#x27; own July uprising of 1917—a suicidal act of public protest to galvanize &#x27;the masses&#x27; against the regime. At no point did the Left SRs ever really think of taking power. They were only &#x27;playing at revolution&#x27;.&quot;

Spiridonova and many other Left SR leaders were imprisoned in Moscow, her Peasant Section of the VTsIK was dissolved, and an undisclosed number of other party members (over 200 according to Spiridonova herself) were summarily executed.

After she was kept in jail for several months, it was announced that Spiridonova was to be tried on 1 December 1918. To undercut the possibility of a potentially volatile situation developing, a secret trial was conducted on 27 November instead. Spiridonova was sentenced to one year in prison for her part in the Left SR revolt but was amnestied the next day.

====Further imprisonment====
Spiridonova became the voice of a radical faction of the Left SRs opposed to any accommodation with the &quot;Communist&quot; regime (as the Bolsheviks now styled themselves) and she publicly denounced the government for having betrayed the revolution with its policies and actions. Despite her bitter refusal to compromise, Spiridonova remained separate from the party&#x27;s ultra-left terrorist wing, focusing on the idea of revitalizing the system of Soviets in opposition to the rule of the Communist party by bureaucratic edict.

In January 1919, after another public speech in opposition to the Communist government, Spiridonova was arrested by the Moscow Cheka. She was tried once more on 24 February 1919, with ex Left Communist leader Nikolai Bukharin as the sole witness for the prosecution. Bukharin charged that Spiridonova was mentally ill and a menace to society in the deadly political atmosphere of the Russian Civil War. Spiridonova was found guilty and sentenced to one year&#x27;s incarceration in a mental sanitarium, effectively removing her from politics.

Instead of a sanitarium, Spiridonova was actually confined in a small holding cell inside a military barracks in the Kremlin, where her already frail health rapidly deteriorated. Left SR militants organized her escape on 2 April 1919. Spiridonova subsequently lived underground in Moscow as a peasant woman under the pseudonym Onufrieva. She was rearrested 19 months later, ill with typhus and suffering from an unstated nervous disorder; it was &quot;the night of October 26, 1920, exactly three years after the victory of the October Revolution&quot;. This time, the Communist authorities proved somewhat more merciful than usual: given her extremely poor health, Spiridonova was initially put under house arrest. Alexandra Izmailovich was transferred from Butyrka prison and charged with nursing her, along with the party co-leader, Boris Kamkov, then possibly Spiridonova&#x27;s romantic partner as well. Kamkov was with her at the moment of arrest and was permitted to stay beside her for the next four months. She was later transferred to a Cheka medical facility, then confined in a psychiatric prison.

She was finally released to the custody of two Left SR comrades on 18 November 1921 under the condition that she cease all political activity. Historian Alexander Rabinowitch comments that there is no evidence that she ever violated this condition. Spiridonova&#x27;s active political life was at an end.

=== Persecution, death and legacy ===
Despite her withdrawal from active politics, she was arrested again on 16 May 1923. At the time, large numbers of moderate socialist and liberal leaders were permitted or obliged to emigrate to the West (including the two Left Socialist-Revolutionaries to whom Spiridonova had been entrusted). Nevertheless, Spiridonova was charged with &quot;having made preparations to flee abroad&quot; and sentenced to three years of administrative exile, a sentence that was repeatedly extended. She spent the rest of the 1920s in Kaluga (1923–25), Samarkand (1925–28) and Tashkent (1928–30). In 1930, after Joseph Stalin&#x27;s consolidation of power, Spiridonova was arrested once again. Charged with maintaining contacts abroad, she was sentenced to three more years of administrative exile (twice extended), this time in Ufa, capital of the Bashkir Republic. She lived with her former prison partner Izmailovich during the whole period of exile. Kakhovskaya also spent time with them as often and as long as she was permitted to. In the mid-1920s, Spiridonova had also married her fellow exile , a Left SR leader of peasant origin and erstwhile Deputy People&#x27;s Commissar for Agriculture.

In 1937, Spiridonova was arrested yet again, with several former party comrades including her husband, her teenaged stepson, her invalid father-in-law, Alexandra Izmailovich, Irina Kakhovskaya and the latter&#x27;s aged aunt. The group was accused of plotting to create a united counter-revolutionary center and to assassinate Bashkir Communist leaders. Spiridonova underwent cruel interrogation in prison in Ufa and in Moscow for several months, without admitting any guilt, although a confession was extorted from her husband. In November 1937, she wrote a long letter to the 4th Section of the Main Directorate of State Security (GUGB) within the People&#x27;s Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD) from her cell, protesting against the prison treatment inflicted on her, contesting the correctness of the judicial procedure and rejecting every single charge. The letter proclaimed that she fully supported the construction of socialism and acknowledged the Communist leadership. However, she concluded what was later called her &quot;last testament&quot; with a vibrant heart-felt plea against capital punishment, twice abolished in the aftermaths of the February and October Revolutions and twice re-established by subsequent governments despite vehement protests from the Left Social-Revolutionaries:

On 7 January 1938, she was eventually sentenced to 25 years in prison by the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court. After a hunger strike, she was held in isolation at Oryol Prison. On 11 September 1941 (three months after the German invasion of the USSR), Spiridonova, Izmailovich, Mayorov and over 150 other political prisoners (among them Christian Rakovsky and Olga Kameneva) were executed by order of Stalin in the Medvedevsky Forest massacre.

Despite Kakhovskaya&#x27;s efforts after the 1956 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, &quot;not until 1990 were the 1941 charges against Spiridonova rescinded [...] Finally, in 1992, [she] was exonerated of the charges for which she had been imprisoned and exiled beginning in 1918, and was fully rehabilitated&quot; by the Russian Federation. The exact burial place of the Medvedevsky Forest victims has never been found.

== Spiridonova in Russian culture ==
Some of Russia&#x27;s major poets, such as Maksimilian Voloshin, dedicated their poems to Spiridonova during the First Revolution. Russian historian Yaroslav Leontiev believes that Boris Pasternak also immortalized Spiridonova (but already without being able to name her directly), in the first few lines of his poem &quot;The Year 1905&quot;, published in 1926.

<text>Glencoe High School is a public secondary school in Hillsboro, Oregon that is part of the Hillsboro School District. It was founded in 1980 to relieve overcrowding at Hillsboro High School caused by the city&#x27;s rapid expansion. Glencoe High is the second oldest of the four high schools in the city. Glencoe is classified as a 6A school for activities and sports. It takes its name from the former community of Glencoe. In 2003, the school, along with all schools in the district, made national news when 17 days of classes were cut from the school year due to budget cuts to education in Oregon. IN 2016, the graduation rate was 86%.

==Academics==
In 2008, 85% of the school&#x27;s seniors received a high school diploma. Of 384 students, 328 graduated, 34 dropped out, five received a modified diploma, and 17 were still in high school the following year.

The school received a silver ranking in &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;″s 2010 &quot;America&#x27;s Best High Schools&quot; survey. For the second year in a row, Glencoe was recognized by the State of Oregon on the Oregon Report Card as &quot;Exceptional&quot;; one of six large high schools in the state to receive that recognition. Glencoe is a certified Project Lead The Way school.

==Athletics==
Glencoe has won state championships in track and field, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, and football (twice, in 1986 and 1994). In 2018 the school moved from the 6A-2 Metro League to the 6A-3 Pacific Conference. In the 2007–08 season Glencoe won its first state championship in soccer. Its cross-town rival has been Hillsboro High School; however, Hilhi currently plays in the 5A-1 Northwest Oregon Conference. Since opening, the school has used the off-campus Hare Field for football games.

The school has been state champions in the following sports in the following years:
* 2010 - 5A softball
* 2007 - 5A boys&#x27; soccer
* 1994 - 4A football
* 1990 - 4A girls&#x27; basketball
* 1989 - 3A boys&#x27; track and field

<doc id="1152156" wikidata="Q18411" url="?curid=1152156" title="Juliet of the Spirits">
<text>Juliet of the Spirits () is a 1965 fantasy comedy-drama film directed by Federico Fellini and starring Giulietta Masina, Sandra Milo, Mario Pisu, Valentina Cortese, and Valeska Gert. The film is about the visions, memories, and mysticism that help a middle-aged woman find the strength to leave her philandering husband. The film uses &quot;caricatural types and dream situations to represent a psychic landscape&quot;. It was Fellini&#x27;s first feature-length color film, but followed his use of color in &quot;The Temptation of Doctor Antonio&quot; episode in the portmanteau film, &quot;Boccaccio &#x27;70&quot; (1962).

The film was shown in competition at the 26th Venice International Film Festival; and received Academy Award nominations for Best Costume Design and Best Set Decoration. It won the 1966 Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and Giulietta Masina won a David di Donatello for her performance. Woody Allen loosely remade it with his 1990 film &quot;Alice&quot;.

==Plot==

Giulietta Boldrini, an upper-class housewife, attempts to deal with her mundane life and philandering, oppressive husband, Giorgio, by exploring the odd lifestyle of a glamorous neighbour, Suzy, and through dreams, visions and fantasies. As she taps into her desires (and her demons) she slowly gains greater self-awareness, leading to independence, although, according to Masina (Fellini&#x27;s wife), the ending&#x27;s meaning is debatable.

==Cast==
==Production==
&quot;Juliet of the Spirits&quot; was shot on location in Fregene, and at Safa-Palatino and Cinecittà Studios in Rome.

Fellini&#x27;s longtime musical collaborator Nino Rota composed the soundtrack. Until his death in 1979, Rota wrote the music for every Fellini film except his directorial debut, &quot;Variety Lights&quot;. The music in &quot;Juliet of the Spirits&quot; contains circus themes, as in Fellini&#x27;s &quot;8½&quot;, and also uses organ, cocktail piano, guitar, saxophones, and voices without words to convey Juliet&#x27;s shifts in feeling.

==Reception==
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 79% based on 29 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10. On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film&#x27;s re-release has a weighted average score of 83 out of 100, based on 9 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Stephen Holden wrote of a revival in 2001: &quot;Fellini went deliriously and brilliantly bananas with the color to create a rollicking through-the-looking-glass series of tableaus evoking a woman&#x27;s troubled psyche.&quot; Roger Ebert gave the film four stars out of four and included it in his 2001 list of &quot;The Great Movies&quot;. Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; praised the film, writing, &quot;Federico Fellini&#x27;s 1965 &quot;Juliet of the Spirits&quot; remains a timeless, major work of a master, a portrait of a dutiful wife plunged into crisis that triggers her spiritual awakening. With Fellini&#x27;s own wife, the great Giulietta Masina, as Juliet, and with his unique command of fantasy and spectacle in full force, &quot;Juliet of the Spirits&quot;, Fellini&#x27;s first film in color, is at once an eye-popping display of bravura and a work of compassionate insight.&quot;

The film was less well received in Italy. Giovanni Grazzini of &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot; wrote, &quot;It is known that Fellini&#x27;s imagination, in recent years, has been unrestrained by a taste conventionally called baroque: ornamental delirium, decorative bliss. Juliet&#x27;s marital crisis is thus suffocated by the scenographic luxury, the clamor or the tenderness of the colors, the bizarre splendor of the costumes; although sometimes there is an authentic heartbeat of humanity.&quot;

<doc id="1152162" wikidata="Q1364012" url="?curid=1152162" title="Allantois">
<text>The allantois ( ; : allantoides or allantoises) is one the extraembryonic membranes arising from the yolk sac. It is a hollow sac-like structure filled with clear fluid that forms part of the developing conceptus in an amniote that helps the embryo exchange gases and handle liquid waste. The other extraembryonoic membranes are the yolk sac, the amnion, and the chorion. In mammals these membranes are known as fetal membranes.

The allantois, along with the amnion, chorion, and yolk sac (other extraembryonic membranes), identify humans and other mammals, birds, and reptiles as amniotes. These extraembryonic membranes that form the embryo have aided amniotes in the transition from aquatic to terrestrial environments. Fish and amphibians are &quot;anamniotes&quot;, lacking the allantois.

==Function==
This sac-like structure, whose name is Greek for sausage (from ἀλλαντοειδής &quot;allantoeidḗs&quot;, in reference to its shape when first formed) is primarily involved in nutrition and excretion, and is webbed with blood vessels. The function of the allantois is to collect liquid waste from the embryo, as well as to exchange gases used by the embryo.

===In mammals===
In mammals, except the egg-laying monotremes, the allantois is one of the fetal membranes, and is part of and forms an axis for the development of the umbilical cord.

While the function of the allantois remains conserved, there is a divergence in the characteristics of the allantois among mammalian species. Structural variations of the allantois include differences in size and shape.

In mammals, the emergence of the allantois varies during early development. In humans, the allantois appears during the presomitic stages of mid-gastrulation. The mouse allantois appears before the first somite pair as well; however, it occurs shortly after gastrulation. In both pigs and rabbits, the allantois arises at early somite stages.

The human allantois is a caudal out-pouching of the yolk sac, which becomes surrounded by the mesodermal connecting stalk known as the body-stalk. The vasculature of the body-stalk develops into umbilical arteries that carry deoxygenated blood to the placenta. It is externally continuous with the proctodeum and internally continuous with the cloaca. The embryonic allantois becomes the fetal urachus, which connects the fetal bladder (developed from cloaca) to the yolk sac. The urachus removes nitrogenous waste from the fetal bladder. After birth the urachus becomes obliterated as the median umbilical ligament.

The mouse allantois consists of mesodermal tissue, which undergoes vasculogenesis to form the mature umbilical artery and vein.

===In marsupials===
In most marsupials, the allantois is avascular, having no blood vessels, but still serves the purpose of storing nitrogenous (NH3) waste. Also, most marsupial allantoises do not fuse with the chorion. An exception is the allantois of the bandicoot, which has a vasculature, and fuses with the chorion. Koalas and wombats also demonstrate allantoic fusion with the chorion.

===In reptiles and birds===

The structure first evolved in reptiles and birds as a reservoir for nitrogenous waste, and also as a means for oxygenation of the embryo. Oxygen is absorbed by the allantois through the egg shell.

In most reptiles and birds, the allantois consists of extraembryonic endoderm enclosed in mesodermal tissue. A chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) is later formed from the chorion and allantois.

==Clinical significance==
During the third week of embryonic development, the allantois protrudes into the area of the urogenital sinus. During fetal development, the allantois becomes the urachus, a duct between the bladder and the yolk sac. A patent allantois can result in a urachal cyst.

Because the allantois can be cultured ex vivo, it has utility as a model system for studying the formation of blood vessels as well as considerable usefulness in drug screening.

<doc id="1152164" wikidata="Q5113026" url="?curid=1152164" title="Christopher Parker">
<text>Christopher Parker (born 24 August 1983) is a retired English actor and television presenter, best known for portraying Spencer Moon on BBC One soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot; between 2002 and 2005.

== Early career ==
Christopher Parker&#x27;s career began at an early age as a model appearing in print campaigns and TV commercials. He progressed onto small roles in TV dramas such as &quot;The Bill&quot;, &quot;London&#x27;s Burning&quot; (appearing in the last ever episode) and &quot;Judge John Deed&quot;. Parker worked as a stunt double in &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot;.
He then came to wider attention in the role of Spencer Moon in the BBC soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot;, where he played the younger brother of Alfie Moon, portrayed by British actor Shane Richie.

During his time on &quot;EastEnders&quot;, he appeared in the first series of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; and made it through to the final alongside his partner Hanna Karttunen.

== Recent broadcasting ==
In 2005/06 he worked as a presenter on &quot;CD:UK&quot;, &quot;MTV News&quot;, &quot;CBBC&quot; with Fearne Cotton, Radio Disney and as an entertainment presenter on the morning television show &quot;This Morning&quot;.

Parker hosted an hour long special called &quot;Bond is Back&quot; for American television about the latest James Bond film, &quot;Casino Royale&quot;.

He has appeared on CBBC on &quot;Hider in the House&quot; presented by Jason King and Joel and taken part in ITV2&#x27;s reality television programme &quot;Deadline&quot; with chief editor Janet Street-Porter. He was the first celebrity to be sacked by Street-Porter, for refusing to take pictures of famous people without first asking their permission.

He presented &quot;Dead Famous Live&quot; opposite Gail Porter and was, for a period, the face of the digital music channel Bubble Hits.

Parker appeared in the second series of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Hotel Babylon&quot; opposite Danny Dyer. In 2006 he worked alongside Christian Slater, Nick Moran and Eddie Izzard in a live performance of the Hollywood film &quot;The Rogues&quot;.

Parker splits his time between Los Angeles and London. In Los Angeles he worked for Fox owned channel TV Guide Channel and also Reelz Channel (a film themed channel).

In 2008, he took part in the Strictly Come Dancing Live Arena Tour and he has acted in Tim Smith&#x27;s short film Schoolboy and also the feature film Education of Keiron which stars James Wilby. He is also presenting holiday segments for ITV1&#x27;s This Morning and has a column in Teen Now magazine.

Chris Parker hosted a weekly show on Gala Bingo&#x27;s TV channel, commencing June 2009.

Christopher took part in a celebrity version of TV show Total Wipeout which aired on 2 January 2010.

== Law career ==
Parker later studied for a law degree at Birkbeck, University of London. He was a final year law student in April 2013. He has expressed a desire to take his law aspirations further after completing his degree, but has encountered problems with many law firms requiring A-level results which, due to his acting experiences when younger, he lacks. As of October 2022, he is a senior consultant at London-based law firm Ignition Law.

== Personal life ==
Parker has completed two London Marathons, one for the charity Barnardo&#x27;s and the second for the Make Poverty History Campaign and visited Africa with Comic Relief alongside Fearne Cotton. He is also a celebrity supporter for the British Red Cross.

In 2004, he attempted suicide by cutting his wrists and taking an overdose of paracetamol tablets after a woman claimed he lied about their relationship to hide his sexuality. After two friends found him, he was left with no lasting damage, and said the attempt was stupid but that he had reached the stage of desperation. After three weeks of extended leave from &quot;EastEnders&quot;, he and production staff reached a mutual decision that he would not return to the series.

<text>The 1999 Rugby League Tri-Nations series was contested by Australia, Great Britain and New Zealand in 1999. It was the first multi-national rugby league tournament to feature the sport&#x27;s three world powers since the 1989–1992 Rugby League World Cup (the 1995 World Cup featured England and Wales separately). Co-hosts Australia and New Zealand played in the final, which was narrowly won by the Kangaroos. Great Britain didn&#x27;t win a game of the tournament.

After the Lions narrowly defeated the Queensland Cup premiers, Burleigh Bears, a poor crowd attended their match against Australia at Suncorp Stadium. Fearing a similar attendance for the series final, the tournament organisers relocated the match to Ericsson Stadium.

With the Rugby League World Cup to be staged the following year, and tours of Great Britain by Australia in 2001 and 2003 and New Zealand in 2002, the Tri-nations was not held again until 2004.

== Venues ==
The games were played at the following venues in Australia and New Zealand. The tournament final was played in Auckland.

<text>Rota (&quot;The Oath&quot;) is an early 20th-century Polish poem, as well as a celebratory anthem, once proposed to be the Polish national anthem. &quot;Rota&quot;&#x27;s lyrics were written in 1908 by activist for Polish independence, poet Maria Konopnicka as a protest against German Empire&#x27;s policies of forced Germanization of Poles. Konopnicka wrote &quot;Rota&quot; in 1908 while staying in Cieszyn. The poem was published for the first time in &quot;Gwiazdka Cieszyńska&quot; newspaper on 7 November. The music was composed two years later by composer, conductor and concert organist, Feliks Nowowiejski.

==History==
Konopnicka&#x27;s poem came into being as a protest against the German Empire&#x27;s oppression and suppression of Polish culture in German-annexed western Poland — lands that from years 1772 and 1793–95 (after the three partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth) to 1918 were under Prussian — and later, German — rule. During the Prussian and German rule, German political leaders like Otto von Bismarck, Eugen von Puttkammer and thinkers like Eduard von Hartmann campaigned for policy of &quot;ausrotten&quot; (literally &quot;uprooting&quot;, i.e. extermination – the same term was decades later used by Nazi Germany in describing what must be done with Jews) of Poles and &quot;Rota&quot; was written as a reply to this campaign.

&quot;Rota&quot; was first sung publicly during a patriotic demonstration in Kraków on July 15, 1910, held to commemorate the 500th anniversary of the Polish-Lithuanian victory over the Teutonic Knights at the Battle of Grunwald. The anthem quickly became popular across partitioned Poland. Until 1918, &quot;Rota&quot; served as the anthem of the Polish Scouting movement. Between 1920 and 1922 the piece was chosen as state anthem of the Republic of Central Lithuania, a puppet state fully dependent on the Second Polish Republic (i.e. interwar Poland); while in Poland proper it was seriously considered as a possible national anthem too – among the other several different poems which the post-1926 government led by Józef Piłsudski thought over – as it was associated with anti-German struggles from the late 19th century. (&quot;Rota&quot; was promoted especially by political right which saw the proposed &quot;We Are the First Brigade&quot; of the Pilsudski legion as too partisan and was lackluster on &quot;Poland Is Not Yet Lost&quot;.) In the end, however, the last song was chosen (today&#x27;s Polish anthem).

During the German occupation of Poland in World War II, on the eve of 11 November 1939 (Polish Independence Day), in Zielonka, a town at the outskirts of Warsaw, the scouts from the Polish Scouting Association put up posters with the text of the poem on the walls of the buildings. In reprisal, German occupying forces carried out an execution of 9 scouts and other inhabitants of the town. The Communists also retained the same national anthem as well as &quot;Rota&quot;, making it the official anthem of the 1st Tadeusz Kościuszko Infantry Division.

At the turn of the 1980s and 1990s of the 20th century, this composition was considered as the anthem of proposed Polish National-Territorial Region within the Lithuanian SSR. After 1989 &quot;Rota&quot; became the official anthem of the Polish People&#x27;s Party. Until 2003, the melody of the anthem was played by the Gdańsk &quot;carillon&quot; tower and served as the signature theme of the television stations TVP Poznań and TVP Gdańsk. In 2010 &quot;Rota&quot; and its author Konopnicka were honored by a special resolution of the Polish Sejm. &quot;Rota&quot; is also the official anthem of League of Polish Families political party.

From May 2024, an autograph score of the composition (prepared for publication in 1910) is presented at a permanent exhibition in the Palace of the Commonwealth in Warsaw.

<doc id="1152185" wikidata="Q172239" url="?curid=1152185" title="Jo Bonnier">
<text>Karl Jockum Jonas &quot;Joakim&quot; Bonnier (31 January 1930 – 11 June 1972), commonly known as Jo Bonnier, was a Swedish racing driver and motorsport executive, who competed in Formula One from to . Bonnier won the 1959 Dutch Grand Prix with BRM.

Born and raised in Stockholm, Bonnier was the son of geneticist Gert Bonnier and born into the wealthy Bonnier family, the controlling family of the eponymous Bonnier Group. Bonnier competed in Formula One for Maserati, Scuderia Centro Sud, BRM, Porsche, Rob Walker Racing and Ecurie Bonnier, winning the with BRM to become the first Swedish Formula One Grand Prix winner and finishing eighth in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship that year.

Outside of Formula One, Bonnier entered 13 editions of the 24 Hours of Le Mans from to , finishing runner-up in alongside Graham Hill, driving the Ferrari 330P. During the latter, Bonnier died when his Lola T280 collided with traffic and left him critically injured. Until his death, Bonnier had been the chairman of the Grand Prix Drivers&#x27; Association.

==Early life==
Karl Jockum Jonas Bonnier was born in Stockholm, to the wealthy Bonnier family. His father, Gert, was a professor of genetics at the University of Stockholm, while many members of his extensive family were in the publishing business. He spoke six languages and, although his parents hoped that he would become a doctor, for a while it was his aspiration to enter the family publishing business. He attended Oxford University for a year, studying languages, then went to Paris, France, planning to learn about publishing.

==First competition==
Bonnier began competitive racing in Sweden at age 17, on an old Harley-Davidson motorcycle. He returned home to Sweden in 1951 after his Paris trip, and later took part in several rallies as the proud owner of a Simca.

==Formula One==

Bonnier entered Formula One in , driving a Maserati. His racing career almost ended in September 1958 in a race at Imola. He debuted a 1500cc Maserati and moved up through the field following a bad start, passing Luigi Musso, and was gaining on leader Eugenio Castellotti at around two seconds per lap when he lost control after another car pulled directly into his path as they negotiated a fast corner. His Maserati struck a large rock at the edge of the road and catapulted. The other driver went underneath him as he turned over and over in the air and, while he was upside down, the crash helmet of his competitor made contact with his. Bonnier&#x27;s Maserati landed on its side before skidding 75 feet and heading into a ditch, where it came to a stop against a pole. Bonnier was thrown out of the car and suffered concussion, several cracked ribs, and a broken vertebra. His car was completely written off.

His greatest achievement in Formula One was taking victory for BRM in the 1959 Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort, when the notoriously unreliable car worked well for once (Dan Gurney and Hans Herrmann had bad crashes after brake failures). He also won the 1960 German Grand Prix with a Porsche 718, a race held for Formula Two in preparation for the rule change of 1961. Bonnier was one of the driving forces behind the Grand Prix Drivers&#x27; Association. 
Despite his win for BRM, Bonnier did not drive for many works teams throughout his career, with only one-offs as a replacement driver for Lotus, Brabham and Honda. After his debut in a works Maserati, he then drove for his own &quot;Joakim Bonnier Racing Team&quot; and for Mimmo Dei&#x27;s Scuderia Centro Sud in the late 50s, before finding a spot in the BRM and Porsche teams.

After Porsche quit Grand Prix racing at the end of the 1962 season, Bonnier switched to Rob Walker Racing Team, the only privateer to have scored wins in World Championship events, where he drove Coopers and Brabhams, scoring few points.

In 1966, he reformed his own team as Anglo-Suisse Racing Team (later to be renamed Ecurie Bonnier), but his interest in Formula One gradually diminished. His last full season was 1968, in which he traded his old Cooper T86 for an old McLaren. He raced occasionally in Formula One until 1971.
In 1966, along with American racing drivers Phil Hill, Richie Ginther and Carroll Shelby, he was racing advisor to the 1966 motor racing epic &quot;Grand Prix&quot; starring James Garner. All the aforementioned (including Garner, who did all his own driving) were employed as drivers for the racing scenes. While filming the 1966 Belgian Grand Prix at the notorious and extremely fast Spa-Francorchamps circuit, Bonnier, along with more than half the field including Jackie Stewart, Bob Bondurant, Graham Hill and Denny Hulme, crashed out on the first lap of the race. According to Phil Hill, Bonnier went through an upstairs window at a house next to the track and could not take part in the later filming on the circuit.

==Sports car racer==

Alongside Formula One, Bonnier also took part in many sports car races. He won the 1960 Targa Florio, co-driving a works Porsche 718 with Hans Herrmann, and in 1962 took a Ferrari 250 TRI entered by Count Giovanni Volpi to top honours in the 12 Hours of Sebring, sharing the car with Lucien Bianchi. In 1963 he was once again winner at the Targa Florio, with Carlo Mario Abate in another works Porsche 718.

1964 was his best year in sports car racing, where he co-drove a Ferrari P entered by &quot;Maranello Concessionaires&quot; with Graham Hill, taking a 330P to second place in the 24 Hours of Le Mans and to a win at Montlhéry, while a 12-hour race in Reims also gave him a first place in a 250LM.
He then won the 1000km Nürburgring in a Chaparral in 1966 (with Phil Hill), his last win in a major sports car event, but still managed to snatch victories in the minor 1000 km of Barcelona at Montjuïc in 1971 (with Ronnie Peterson), and the 4 Hours of Le Mans in 1972 (with Hughes de Fierlant).

Bonnier purchased a McLaren M6B to campaign in the 1968 Can-Am series. In the first outing at the Karlskoga Sweden GP, Bonnier had the pole but an off course excursion on the first lap caused him to finish second to David Piper in a Ferrari 330P3/4. He then ran his McLaren in five of the six Can-Am races with his best finish an eighth at Las Vegas. He was plagued with mechanical problems most of the season. However, he finished 3rd in the M6B at the Mt Fuji 200-mile race.

In 1970, he drove a Lola T210 to victory in the European 2-Litre Sports Car Championship, securing the drivers title at the end of the season with 48 points.

==Other ventures==
===Team managements===

By the early seventies, he had taken to managing his team, entering several cars in World Sportscar Championship events, and taking a backseat to driving. 

===Safety advocacy===
Bonnier had also taken a lead in the fight for track safety, which had started around that time. 

==Death==
Bonnier was killed in a crash during the 1972 24 Hours of Le Mans. On the straight between Mulsanne Corner and Indianapolis, his open-top Lola T280-Cosworth collided with a Ferrari Daytona driven by a Swiss amateur driver Florian Vetsch. His car was catapulted over the Armco barriers and into the trees next to the track and he was killed instantly. According to Vic Elford, who was driving a factory-entered Alfa Romeo Tipo 33 and who had stopped to assist Vetsch escape from his burning Ferrari, the last he had seen of Bonnier&#x27;s Lola was that it was &quot;spinning into the trees like a helicopter&quot;.

<doc id="1152189" wikidata="Q2310516" url="?curid=1152189" title="2004 Rugby League Tri-Nations">
<text>The second Rugby League Tri-Nations tournament (known as the [[Gillette (brand)|Gillette]] Tri-Nations due to sponsorship) was contested between 16 October and 27 November of 2004. The format of the competition differed from the previous event in that the teams played each other twice, rather than once, prior to the final.

The tournament final of the tournament was predicted by some to be a close affair, with the British team heralded as slight favourites after finishing at the top of the league table. Instead, it was a one-sided match as Australia produced their best performance of the tournament. The game was effectively over by half-time when Australia led by 38–0.

== Participating teams ==
Each team was to play the other three twice during the round robin tournament. The top two finishing teams would then contest the final.
== Officials ==
One referee from each participating nation was appointed to control matches in the Tri-Nations:
* Tim Mander (2 matches)
* Russell Smith (3 matches)
* Glen Black (2 matches)

== Venues ==
The games were played at the following venues in New Zealand and England.

=== Final ===
The tournament final was played in Leeds.

=== Non-series Tests ===

=== Additional Matches ===
A one-off match was also played between an ANZAC side made up of touring Australian and New Zealand players and a Cumbria side.

On their way back to Australia just four days after the Tri-Nations Final, the Kangaroos played a match, known as the Liberty Bell Cup against the USA at the Franklin Field in Philadelphia. Played in quarters instead of halves, and on a synthetic field that was the size of a Grid iron field, the American&#x27;s shocked the Australians by racing to an 18–0 lead nearing half time and actually went into the long break with a 24–6 lead. They managed to keep their lead until late in the game when the fitness of the Australians, who had bombed numerous try scoring opportunities through the game, told and the Kangaroos overhauled the home team to win 36–24.

<text>Diarmuid Gavin (born 10 May 1964) is an Irish garden designer and television personality. He has presented gardens at the Chelsea Flower Show on nine occasions from 1995 to 2016, winning a number of medals, including gold in 2011. He has also authored or co-authored at least ten gardening-related books.

==Early life==
Gavin was born in London on 10 May 1964, to Irish parents, and brought to Ireland when he was a month old. He grew up in the Fairways development in Rathfarnham, a suburb of Dublin. When Gavin was six, his younger brother Conor was killed by a car while they were walking to school. He received his primary school education in St. Joseph&#x27;s Boys National School in Terenure. He received his secondary education at Templeogue College; he recalls the subjects as being &quot;horrifying,&quot; with the exception of art classes with a favourite teacher, Mr Weafer. He applied to the College of Amenity Horticulture at the Botanic Gardens in Glasnevin, Dublin, failing the first time, but securing entry three years later.

==Gardening career==
Gavin started work with small jobs, the first, a suburban house garden featuring gravel and railway sleepers, in 1988, while he was studying at Glasnevin, still intact as of 2016. A notable early commission was for social columnist Terry Keane, a contract during which he also met his future wife.

===Design and consulting===
Gavin runs his own garden and landscape design business, with an office in London, and contact details in Ireland also. The enterprise launched its website in 2005, but after a refresh, the site has displayed a holding page since 2013. Gavin has designed many gardens in the UK and Ireland, and beyond, for commercial, public sector and private clients. In interviews he has mentioned projects primarily in the UK and China, that his work primarily involves travel, and that he has never yet been to Ireland&#x27;s national flower show, Bloom. In particular the projects in China have tended to be large-scale and of long duration, involving a lot of time away from home, and limiting his work in Ireland and the UK.

===Chelsea Flower Show===
By the end of 2019, Gavin has participated in the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Chelsea Flower Show nine times, seven on the main avenue, the last having been 2016. His first Chelsea garden, in 1995, was inspired by the coastal gardens of Noelle Campbell-Sharp at Canuig House in Ballinskelligs, County Kerry. He discussed some of his garden concepts, and material sourcing, in his autobiographical volume. He entered again in 1996.

Gavin won a bronze medal in 1995, and a silver-gilt medal in 2004. In 2007, Gavin&#x27;s &quot;Westland Garden&quot;, featuring recycled materials, also won a silver-gilt medal.

====The Sky Garden, 2011 Gold medal====
In May 2011 Gavin returned to Chelsea after a three-year gap, with his &quot;Irish Sky Garden&quot;, which attracted funding of more than €1.7 million from Fáilte Ireland, the Irish tourism body, and was also supported by Cork City Council. Gavin described the garden as inspired by the Oscar-winning animator Richie Baneham (who drove visual effects for &quot;Avatar&quot;), as well as by the &quot;suspended table&quot; novelty restaurant concept, and by the Midsummer Festival of the Senses at Cork, the landscapes of Capability Brown, Charles Jencks and the some Italian Renaissance figures. The garden was built in an ovoid container suspended more than 25 metres above the ground. Twenty-five reflecting and flowing pools on the ground showcased the garden, which could be visited by show-goers in groups of up to eight. This garden won the gold medal at the show.

The Sky Garden attracted controversy when Cork City Council in Ireland agreed to put the garden on permanent display at Fitzgerald&#x27;s Park in the Mardyke area of the city – at a cost of at least €300,000 to the cash-strapped council. The decision attracted widespread criticism including that of a number of Cork city councillors with Councillor Ted Tynan pointed out that there were over 500 boarded up local council houses in the city and demanded clarification from the council as to what the exact cost of the garden would be. In the end, the garden was not set up in its full form, but aspects of its design were used in a reworking of Fitzgerald&#x27;s Park.

====2012 to present====
Gavin participated again in Chelsea, on the main avenue, in 2012, 2013 and 2016. His 2016 garden, the &quot;British Eccentric&#x27;s Garden&quot;, inspired by Heath Robinson and others, sponsored by Harrods, and planted with help from Helen Dillon and Carmel Duignan, won a silver gilt medal. He described the complexity of the preparation of the garden, which combined classic garden elements, buildings and mechanical animation, and involved planning and preparation over a year, and around 150 people. He did not participate in the 2017 Chelsea Flower Show, nor those of 2018 and 2019.

===Patronage, promotional and charitable work===
Gavin has been a patron at Southport Flower Show and many others. He became patron of the Royal Horticultural Society of Ireland in August 2019.

He has run several fundraising events for the Cill Rialaig Artists&#x27; Retreat.

Gavin has also participated in promotional work for Ireland&#x27;s horticultural development board, Bord Glas, free of charge.

===Work with retail===
As of 2016, Gavin was offering a garden design service with Harrods of London.

In 2018, Dunnes Stores, Ireland&#x27;s largest retail operator, announced an arrangement with Gavin, to launch events and special retail facilities on George&#x27;s Street in Dublin, later expanding.

==Talks and courses==
Gavin has presented many talks and lectures in both Ireland and the UK, and has also delivered courses on gardening and garden design.

==Television==
===Presenting===
Gavin presented &quot;Surprise Gardeners&quot;, a Central TV (ITV) series, and also &quot;Virgin Gardeners&quot; for Channel 5. He presented or co-presented a number of BBC television programmes, including &quot;Gardeners&#x27; World&quot; and &quot;Home Front&quot; (Home Front Inside Out, Home Front in the Garden) with Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen, as well as &quot;Planet Patio&quot; and &quot;Art of the Garden&quot; (BBC2). In 2004, he presented &quot;Diarmuid&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot;, and a Twofour and RHS production, &quot;Gardens Through Time&quot;. &quot;Homefront&quot; and &quot;Gardens Through Time&quot; both had accompanying books published.

RTÉ screened the television show &quot;I Want a Garden&quot;. In 2011, RTÉ launched &quot;Dirty Old Towns&quot; with Gavin as co-presenter, and a second series aired in 2012.

Gavin presented an episode of &quot;Great British Garden Revival&quot; on BBC Two in 2014.

On 8 October 2013, Gavin appeared as a guest on The Sarah Millican Television Programme on BBC, and on 9 October 2013, on the ITV game show &quot;Big Star&#x27;s Little Star&quot;, with his daughter Eppie. On 14 December 2013, Gavin appeared on &quot;The Chase: Celebrity Special&quot;, and on 5 March 2014, he appeared in an episode of &quot;Sport Relief&#x27;s Top Dog&quot; with his dog, Roxie.

On 8 September 2019 Gavin appeared on a Channel 5 edition of the Irish reality TV home improvement show &quot;Room to Improve&quot;.

Gavin appeared on Series 1 of The Apprentice UK, agreeing to donate a Suzuki 600 motorcycle to a charity auction.

<text>Augusta Viktoria of Schleswig-Holstein (Auguste Viktoria Friederike Luise Feodora Jenny; 22 October 1858 – 11 April 1921) was the last German Empress and Queen of Prussia by marriage to Wilhelm II, German Emperor.

==Biography==
===Early life and family===
Augusta Victoria was born at Dolzig Castle, the eldest daughter of Frederick VIII, future Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg, and Princess Adelheid of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, a niece of Queen Victoria, through Victoria&#x27;s half-sister Feodora. She grew up at Dolzig until the death of her grandfather, Christian August II, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg, in 1869. The family then moved to Castle Primkenau and the estate her father had inherited. She was known within her family as &quot;Dona&quot;.

===Crown Princess===
On 27 February 1881, Augusta married her half-second cousin Prince Wilhelm of Prussia. Augusta&#x27;s maternal grandmother Princess Feodora of Leiningen was the half-sister of Queen Victoria, who was Wilhelm&#x27;s maternal grandmother.

Wilhelm had earlier proposed to his first cousin, Princess Elisabeth of Hesse and by Rhine (known in the family as &quot;Ella&quot;), a daughter of his mother&#x27;s own sister, but she declined. He did not react well, and was adamant that he would soon marry another princess.

Wilhelm&#x27;s family was originally against the marriage with Augusta Victoria, whose father was not even a sovereign. However, Chancellor Otto von Bismarck was a strong proponent of the marriage, believing that it would end the dispute between the Prussian government and Augusta&#x27;s father. In the end, Wilhelm&#x27;s intransigence, the support of Bismarck, and a determination to move beyond the rejection of his proposal to Ella, led the reluctant imperial family to give official consent.

===Empress===
Augusta was known as &quot;Dona&quot; within the family. She had a somewhat lukewarm relationship with her mother-in-law, Victoria, who had hoped that Dona would help to heal the rift between herself and Wilhelm; this was not to be the case. The empress was also annoyed that the title of head of the Red Cross went to Dona, who had no nursing or charity experience or inclination (though in her memoirs, Princess Viktoria Luise paints a different picture, stating that her mother loved charity work). Augusta often took pleasure in snubbing her mother-in-law, usually small incidents, such as telling her that she would be wearing a different dress than the one Victoria recommended, that she would not be riding to get her figure back after childbirth as Wilhelm had no intention of stopping at one son, and informing her that Augusta&#x27;s daughter, Viktoria, was not named after her (though, again, in her memoirs, Viktoria Luise states that she was named after both her grandmother and her great-grandmother, Queen Victoria).

Augusta and her mother-in-law grew closer for a few years when Wilhelm became emperor, as Augusta was often lonely while he was away on military exercises and turned to her mother-in-law for the companionship of rank, although she never left her children alone with her lest they be influenced by her well-known liberalism. Nevertheless, the two were often seen riding in a carriage together. Augusta was at Victoria&#x27;s bedside when she died of breast cancer in 1901.

Augusta also had less than cordial relationships with some of Wilhelm&#x27;s sisters, particularly the recently married Crown Princess Sophie of Greece. In 1890, when Sophie announced her intention to convert to Greek Orthodoxy, Dona summoned her and told her that if she did so, not only would Wilhelm find it unacceptable as the head of the Evangelical State Church of Prussia&#x27;s older Provinces, but she would be barred from Germany and her soul would end up in Hell. Sophie replied that it was her business whether or not she did. Augusta became hysterical and gave birth prematurely to her son, Prince Joachim, as a result of which she was overprotective of him for the rest of his life, believing that he was too delicate. Evidently, so did Emperor Wilhelm; he wrote to his mother that if the baby had died, Sophie would have murdered it.

===Later life===
In 1920, the shock of exile and abdication, combined with the breakdown of Joachim&#x27;s marriage and his subsequent suicide, proved too much for Augusta&#x27;s health. She died in 1921, in Huis Doorn at Doorn in the Netherlands. Wilhelm, still reeling over the same losses, was devastated by her death. The Weimar Republic allowed her remains to be transported back to Germany, where they still lie in the Temple of Antiquities, not far from the New Palace, Potsdam. Because he was not permitted to enter Germany, Wilhelm could accompany his wife on her last journey only as far as the German border. She was buried in Antique Temple, Sanssouci Park, Potsdam, Germany.

===Issue===
Augusta gave birth to seven children by Wilhelm II:

*Wilhelm, German Crown Prince (1882–1951); married Duchess Cecilie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.
*Prince Eitel Friedrich (1883–1942); married Duchess Sophia Charlotte of Oldenburg.
*Prince Adalbert (1884–1948); married Princess Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen.
*Prince August Wilhelm (1887–1949); married Princess Alexandra Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg.
*Prince Oskar (1888–1958); married Countess Ina Marie von Bassewitz.
*Prince Joachim (1890–1920); married Princess Marie-Auguste of Anhalt.
*Princess Victoria Louise of Prussia (1892–1980); married Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick.

==In literature==
The funeral of Augusta Victoria is reflected upon in the novel by Katherine Anne Porter, &quot; Ship of Fools&quot;. In it, a German passenger silently reminisces on the funeral and its cinematic showing to a small colony of Germans living abroad in Mexico and describes the outpouring of public grief that was seen within that community. Augusta Victoria&#x27;s passing is viewed among Germans who lived through the First World War as the ending of a great epoch, the conclusion of which forever divorces them from their maternal country and enshrines Augusta Victoria as a venerable saint and symbol of a Germany long past.

<doc id="1152204" wikidata="Q7455797" url="?curid=1152204" title="Service robot">
<text>Service robots assist human beings, typically by performing a job that is dirty, dull, distant, dangerous or repetitive. They typically are autonomous and/or operated by a built-in control system, with manual override options.
The term &quot;service robot&quot; does not have a strict technical definition. The International Organization for Standardization defines a “service robot” as a robot “that performs useful tasks for humans or equipment excluding industrial automation applications”.

The first industrial robot arm, &quot;Unimate,&quot; was developed by Joseph F. Engelberger, known as the &quot;father of the robot arm,&quot; using George Devel.

According to ISO 8373 robots require “a degree of autonomy”, which is the “ability to perform intended tasks based on current state and sensing, without human intervention”. For service robots this ranges from partial autonomy - including human-robot interaction - to full autonomy - without active human robot intervention. The International Federation of Robotics (IFR) statistics for service robots therefore include systems based on some degree of human robot interaction or even full tele-operation as well as fully autonomous systems.

Service robots are categorized according to personal or professional use. They have many forms and structures as well as application areas.

==Types==
The possible applications of robots to assist in human chores is widespread. At present there are a few main categories that these robots fall into.

===Industrial===
Industrial service robots can be used to carry out simple tasks, such as examining welding, as well as more complex, harsh-environment tasks, such as aiding in the dismantling of nuclear power stations. Industrial robots have been defined by the International Federation of Robotics as &quot;an automatically controlled, reprogrammable, multipurpose manipulator programmable in three or more axes, which may be either fixed in place or mobile for use in industrial automation applications&quot;.

===Frontline Service Robots===
Service robots are system-based autonomous and adaptable interfaces that interact, communicate and deliver service to an organization&#x27;s customers.

===Domestic===
Domestic robots perform tasks that humans regularly perform in non-industrial environments, like people&#x27;s homes such as for cleaning floors, mowing the lawn and pool maintenance. People with disabilities, as well as people who are older, may soon be able to use service robots to help them live independently. It is also possible to use certain robots as assistants or butlers.

===Scientific===
Robotic systems perform many functions such as repetitive tasks performed in research. These range from the multiple repetitive tasks made by gene samplers and sequencers, to systems which can almost replace the scientist in designing and running experiments, analysing data and even forming hypotheses.

Autonomous scientific robots perform tasks which humans would find difficult or impossible, from the deep sea to outer space. The Woods Hole Sentry can descend to 4,500 metres and allows a higher payload as it does not need a support ship or the oxygen and other facilities demanded by human piloted vessels. Robots in space include the Mars rovers which could carry out sampling and photography in the harsh environment of the atmosphere on Mars.

<text>Hvalvík () is a village in the Faroe Islands, located in a valley on the east coast of the island of Streymoy. 

It is the southern half of a twin-village situated on both sides of the valley. The villages are divided by the river Stórá. The northern half which is approximately the same size is called Streymnes. Together the two villages have a population of more than 400 inhabitants.

Hvalvík-Streymnes is a village that has grown rapidly during the past years, mainly because of its proximity to the capital Tórshavn.

==Hvalvík Church==
The Church in Hvalvík is a traditional wooden church dating from 1829, built because the old Church from 1700 was ruined in a storm. It is the third oldest Church in the Faroe Islands, though the oldest of the traditional wooden black churches. The Church is built with wood bought from a ship that ran aground in Saksun in 1828. The architecture is typically Faroese, with no stone foundations. The pulpit dates back to 1609 and was originally in the Church in Tórshavn. 

The famous Bishop Alexander was raised in Hvalvík, in a place called Frammi við Kráir. Legend has it, that he was the first to import knives and forks.

The Church was featured on Faroese stamps issued in 1997:
Hvalvík means &quot;Whale Bay&quot;, for it is a good place for whaling.

<text>Hvannasund (, older spelling: &quot;Quannesund&quot;) is a village and municipality in the Faroe Islands, an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark.

Hvannasund is located on the west coast of the island of Viðoy. It faces Norðdepil on Borðoy. The villages are connected to each other by a causeway. A large cracked rock rests in an area just north of Hvannasund. An old legend details that the rock, called Skrudhettan, broke the very moment that Jesus was born. 

On 26 May 2008, the ocean inexplicably receded 2½ – 3 metres before suddenly hitting the area with great strength. A couple of days later, it was reported that a mini-tsunami had hit Hvannasund. There were no injuries or fatalities.

On 3 September 2008, a majority of the town council, notably excluding the mayor, announced that there would be a referendum on merging Hvannasund municipality with the municipality of Klaksvík. The referendum was held on 17 September. Of the 321 eligible, 278 cast their votes. The result was 68 in favor, 208 against and 2 blanks, thus the merger was rejected.

== Culture ==

=== Church ===
The church in Hvannasund was built in 1949 and was built by locals. Efforts to get contractors to build the church were unsuccessful, and the church ended up being built by local residents. On 13 November 1949, the church was consecrated by provost Jákup Joensen, which was his very first consecration of a church building. The church was designed by Faroese architect H.C.W. Tórgarð and has room for roughly 100 people. It is located close to the sea in very picturesque environment.

In 2016 an additional building was built next to the church to be used for events that require space for more people, such as funerals, weddings and baptisms.

<doc id="1152214" wikidata="Q5015998" url="?curid=1152214" title="Cacho Castaña">
<text>Humberto Vicente Castagna (June 11, 1942 – October 15, 2019), better known as Cacho Castaña, was an Argentine singer, songwriter, pianist and actor. Born in Buenos Aires, he initially worked as a shoe cobbler before becoming famous as a bolero singer in the 1970s. Castana composed and sung various compositions and songs, several of which became gold and platinum records. He also starred in multiple films. Castaña&#x27;s career declined during the 1990s but rebounded after 2003 and he became active in Argentina&#x27;s stage and festival circuit.

==Early life==
Cacho Castaña was born in Buenos Aires and was raised in modest circumstances in the Flores neighborhood. He worked with his father, a shoe cobbler, until he was 16. He developed an interest in music during his early years, becoming a piano teacher by the age of fourteen. He began his career in music in his teens as a pianist in Oscar Espósito&#x27;s &quot;orquesta típica&quot;, one of numerous such groups that performed tango music at the time, and also performed in the Chamamé folk genre.

== Career ==

=== Music ===
Castaña became famous as a bolero singer during the 1970s. He began performing on Argentine television programs such as &quot;Tiempo Final&quot; and &quot;Un Cortado&quot;, among others. He wrote numerous hits, including &quot;Me gusta, me gusta&quot; (&quot;I like it, I like it&quot;), &quot;Lo llaman el matador&quot; (&quot;He&#x27;s Nicknamed the Killer&quot;) and &quot;Hay que encontrar al ladrón&quot; (&quot;The Thief Must be Found&quot;), and his signature bolero: &quot;Para vivir un gran amor&quot; (&quot;To Live a Great Love&quot;). His lyrics became known for their extemporaneous and often autobiographical style, which he described as &quot;writing as I would speak.&quot;

He is much better known for his contributions to tango music. Some of his compositions are considered classics by his fans, including &quot;Qué tango hay que cantar&quot; (&quot;What Tango Must One Sing&quot;, with Rubén Juárez), &quot;Garganta con Arena&quot; (&quot;Throat full of sand&quot;, an homage to Roberto Goyeneche, his mentor), &quot;Tita de Buenos Aires&quot;, (&quot;Tita de Buenos Aires&quot;, dedicated to Tita Merello), &quot;A dónde vas? Quedate en Buenos Aires&quot; (&quot;Where are you going? Stay in Buenos Aires&quot;). Aside from these songs, he also composed an ode to the Flores neighborhood: &quot;Café la Humedad&quot;. Castaña composed around 2,500 songs, of which 500 have been recorded. He produced 44 records, of which fifteen became gold records (over 20,000 sold, per CAPIF ratings), and ten, platinum (over 40,000 sold).

=== Film ===

Aside from his musical career, Castaña was involved in filmography. Castaña starred in thirteen Argentine films, including two for which he wrote the score, &quot;El mundo que inventamos&quot; (&quot;The World We Created&quot;, 1973) and &quot;Los hijos de López&quot; (&quot;López&#x27;s Sons&quot;, 1980); numerous picaresque comedies; and in &quot;Felicidades&quot; (2000). A confirmed bachelor for much of his life, his numerous relationships included one with Susana Giménez during the 1970s (Giménez would later become a top-rated talk show hostess in Argentina). He ultimately married Andrea Sblano, the 27-year-old daughter of a close friend, in 2006; among his other close friends was former President Carlos Menem. His television appearances in later years included a cameo on the popular Argentine telenovela, &quot;Los Roldán&quot;. He earned a Konex Award in 2005 for his work as a songwriter, and his tango album released that year, &quot;Espalda con espalda&quot; (&quot;Back to back&quot;) earned a Gardel Prize. He was invited to perform &quot;with all the other monsters&quot; in Leopoldo Federico&#x27;s series, &quot;Selección Nacional de Tango Argentino&quot; (an event he considered &quot;the happiest day of my life&quot;), and was inducted into the National Academy of Tango in 2007.

=== Decline ===
Castaña&#x27;s career declined during the 1990s, but rebounded after 2003, and he became active in Argentina&#x27;s stage and festival circuit. He headlined numerous Corrientes Avenue shows, and was a regular performer in the National Peña Festival, in Villa María. A heavy smoker, he developed emphysema in later years, and was twice hospitalized as he prepared to appear in shows. He and his wife opened a children&#x27;s clothing boutique, &quot;Las Castañitas&quot;. Their marriage suffered, however, and they separated in 2011. He was again hospitalized following the separation, and made a speedy recovery.

== Death ==
Cacho Castaña died on October 15, 2019, due to complications from COPD after being hospitalized for two weeks.

<text>The Busan-Ulsan Metropolitan Area, centered on the harbor cities of Busan and Ulsan, is the Republic of Korea&#x27;s second-largest metropolitan area in terms of population and is the country&#x27;s second-most developed region as well. It is also an industrial region for shipbuilding, international trade, and heavy industries, such as car making and chemical production.

==Industries==
The Southeastern Maritime Industrial Region is one of South Korea&#x27;s chief industrial centers. Only the Capital Metropolitan Area, located around Seoul, is more advanced. This region began to grow as an international centre for commerce and industrial power in the late 1970s, during which the South Korean government began to introduce national development plans to spur South Korean industry. The results were shocking: within a decade, small fishing wharves like Busan and Ulsan grew into densely populated cities with over two million people each. Meanwhile, industries like car manufacturing and shipbuilding, never heard of before in South Korea, progressed ahead with ferocious speed.

Today, the Southeastern Maritime Industrial Region is made up of several industrial cities, all with a special local industry. Ulsan, Geoje, and Busan, all major international ports, especially the latter, which is the world&#x27;s third-largest trading harbor in terms of total cargo volume, specialize in car manufacturing and shipbuilding. For instance, in 1999, Korean shipbuilding companies based here, such as Hyundai Heavy Industries, Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering, and Samsung Heavy Industries overtook Japanese shipbuilding firms as the world&#x27;s best (). Especially in Ulsan, where heavy industries make up most of the city&#x27;s revenue, Hyundai Auto and other automobile companies are slowly taking leading positions in the global society.

In other cities, such as Pohang and Changwon, steel and oil refining is particularly advanced. Pohang itself is the seat of POSCO, the Korean steel giant, while Changwon is the capital of South Gyeongsang Province. Finally, in Gimhae and Gyeongju, tourism is very popular, as Gyeongju was the ancient capital of the Silla Kingdom, while Gimhae was the capital of the Gaya Kingdom.

<text>Hvítanes () is a village in the Faroe Islands. It is on Streymoy&#x27;s east coast, northeast of Hoyvík and Tórshavn. Its name means &quot;White Point&quot; in Faroese.

Hvítanes is located in a little bay with a stone beach and a harbour where the small boats can be pulled up a ramp out of reach of the sometimes destructive sea.

It was founded in 1837.

The Eysturoyartunnilin surfaces near Hvítanes and connects Tórshavn with the Skálafjørður on Eysturoy.

<doc id="1152225" wikidata="Q1158490" url="?curid=1152225" title="Damiano Defence">
<text>The Damiano Defence is a chess opening beginning with the moves:
# 

The defence is one of the oldest chess openings, with games dating back to the 16th century. It is a weak opening that gives a large advantage for White after 3.Nxe5. Even if White does not go for this continuation, simple leads to an advantage since 2...f6 prevents the g8-knight from developing to f6 and weakens Black&#x27;s .

The &quot;ECO&quot; code for the Damiano Defence is C40 (King&#x27;s Knight Opening). 
==3.d4 and 3.Bc4==
Black&#x27;s 2...f6 is a weak move that exposes Black&#x27;s king, weakens their kingside and prevents Black from developing their knight to f6. The moves 3.d4 and 3.Bc4 are strong replies; I.A. Horowitz wrote (substituting algebraic notation for his descriptive notation), &quot;Simple and potent is 3.Bc4 d6 4.d4 Nc6 5.c3, after which Black chokes to death.&quot;

==3.Nxe5!==

The most forceful move is the knight sacrifice 3.Nxe5 Taking the knight with 3...fxe5? exposes Black to a deadly attack after 4.Qh5+ Ke7 (4...g6 loses to 5.Qxe5+, forking king and rook, leaving Black down the exchange, though other options are worse) 5.Qxe5+ Kf7 6.Bc4+ d5! (6...Kg6 7.Qf5+ is devastating and leads to mate shortly after) 7.Bxd5+ Kg6 8.h4 (8.d4? Bd6!) 8...h5 (see diagram; 8...h6 is similar, except Black cannot play 9...Bxb7 because of 10.Qf5) 9.Bxb7! Bd6 (9...Bxb7 10.Qf5+ Kh6 11.d4+ g5 12.Qf7! mates quickly) 10.Qa5!, when Black&#x27;s best is 10...Nc6 11.Bxc6 Rb8, and now White can play 12.Qxa7 with five extra pawns. Bruce Pandolfini notes that Black&#x27;s opening is thus sometimes described as &quot;the five pawns &quot;. Alternatively, White can continue developing their pieces, remaining four pawns up. In either case, White has a clearly winning position.

Since taking the knight is fatal, after 3.Nxe5 Black should instead play 3...Qe7! (Other Black third moves, such as 3...d5, lead to 4. Qh5+! g6 5. Nxg6!) After 4.Nf3 (4.Qh5+? g6 5.Nxg6 Qxe4+ 6.Be2 Qxg6 leaves Black ahead a piece for a pawn) 4...Qxe4+ 5.Be2, Black has regained the pawn but has lost and weakened their kingside, and will lose more time when White chases the queen with Nc3, or 0-0, Re1, and a move by the bishop on e2. Nick de Firmian in &quot;Modern Chess Openings&quot; analyses instead 4...d5 5.d3 dxe4 6.dxe4, when White had a small advantage in Emmanuel Schiffers–Mikhail Chigorin, St. Petersburg 1897.

The fact that Black can only regain the pawn with 3...Qe7! shows that 2...f6? did not really defend the e-pawn at all. Indeed, even a relatively useless move like 2...a6 is less risky than 2...f6? After 2...a6?! 3.Nxe5, Black could still regain the pawn with 3...Qe7 4.d4 d6, but has not weakened the kingside or prevented the from developing to f6.

==History==
The opening is named after the Portuguese chess author Pedro Damiano (1480–1544), despite the fact that he condemned it as weak and the book may actually be Francesc Vicent’s writing that he signed. In 1847, Howard Staunton wrote of 2...f6, &quot;This move occurs in the old work of Damiano, who gives some ingenious variations on it. Lopez, and later authors, have hence entitled it &#x27;Damiano&#x27;s Gambit&#x27;.&quot; Instead, Staunton&#x27;s contemporary George Walker more logically reserved the term &quot;Damiano Gambit&quot; for the knight sacrifice played by White on the third move: 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 f6 3.Nxe5. Staunton referred to [1.e4 e5 2.Nf3] 2...Nc6, a highly respected move then and now, as &quot;Damiano&#x27;s defence to the &#x27;s opening&quot;.

The Damiano Defence is never seen today in top-level play. The greatest player to play the Damiano in serious master competition was Chigorin. As noted above, he played the 3...Qe7 line in a game against Schiffers at St. Petersburg 1897. Chigorin lost his queen on move 10 (see diagram), but Schiffers played so weakly that Chigorin later missed a brilliant and only escaped when Schiffers agreed to a draw in a winning position. Robert McGregor played the Damiano in a 1964 simultaneous exhibition against Bobby Fischer, essaying 3...Qe7 4.Nf3 d5 5.d3 dxe4 6.dxe4 Qxe4+ 7.Be2 Bf5, and drew, although Fischer did not play the best moves.

<doc id="1152227" wikidata="Q229013" url="?curid=1152227" title="Sarah Silverman">
<text>Sarah Kate Silverman (born December 1, 1970) is an American stand-up comedian, actress, and writer. She first rose to prominence for her brief stint as a writer and cast member on the NBC sketch comedy series &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; during its 19th season between 1993 and 1994. She then starred in and produced &quot;The Sarah Silverman Program&quot;, which ran from 2007 to 2010 on Comedy Central. For her work on the program, Silverman was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series.

She has also acted in television projects such as &quot;Mr. Show&quot; and &quot;V.I.P.&quot; and starred in films, including &quot;Who&#x27;s the Caboose?&quot; (1997), &quot;School of Rock&quot; (2003), &quot;Take This Waltz&quot; (2011), &quot;A Million Ways to Die in the West&quot; (2014), and &quot;Battle of the Sexes&quot; (2017). She also voiced Vanellope von Schweetz in &quot;Wreck-It Ralph&quot; (2012), and &quot;Ralph Breaks the Internet&quot; (2018). For her lead role in &quot;I Smile Back&quot; (2015) she was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award. She released an autobiography &quot;The Bedwetter&quot; in 2010 which she adapted into an off-Broadway musical in 2022.

Her comedy roles address social taboos and controversial topics, including racism, sexism, homophobia, politics, and religion, sometimes having her comic character endorse them in a satirical or deadpan fashion. During the 2016 United States presidential election, she became increasingly politically active; she initially campaigned for Bernie Sanders but later spoke in support of Hillary Clinton at the 2016 Democratic National Convention. She hosted the Hulu late-night talk show &quot;I Love You, America with Sarah Silverman&quot; from 2017 until late 2018.

==Early life==
Sarah Kate Silverman was born on December 1, 1970, in Concord, New Hampshire, to Beth Ann (née Halpin; 1941–2015) and Donald Silverman (1937–2023). She lived in both Manchester, New Hampshire and Bedford, New Hampshire as a child, attending McKelvie Middle School in the latter town. Her mother had been George McGovern&#x27;s personal campaign photographer and founded the theater company New Thalian Players, while Donald trained as a social worker and also ran a clothing store, Crazy Sophie&#x27;s Outlet. Silverman&#x27;s parents divorced and later married others. Silverman is the youngest of five children. Her sisters are Reform rabbi Susan Silverman, writer Jodyne Speyer, and actress Laura Silverman; her brother Jeffrey Michael died when he was three months old. She is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent and considers herself nonreligious. Her ancestors were from Poland and Russia, and she has stated her maternal grandmother escaped the Holocaust. She was in attendance when women lit menorahs at the Western Wall for the first time, in December 2014.
The first time Silverman performed stand-up comedy was in Boston at age seventeen. She described her performance as &quot;awful&quot;. After graduating from The Derryfield School in Manchester in 1989, she attended New York University for a year, but did not graduate. Instead, she performed stand-up in Greenwich Village.

==Career==
===1992–2007: Career beginnings and &quot;Jesus Is Magic&quot;===

After beginning her stand-up career in 1992, Silverman was part of the 1993–94 season of the NBC sketch comedy program &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (&quot;SNL&quot;) for eighteen weeks as a writer and featured player. She was fired after one season. Only one of the sketches she wrote made it to dress rehearsal and none aired, though she did appear on the show as a cast member in sketches, usually in smaller supporting roles. Former &quot;SNL&quot; writer Bob Odenkirk remarked, &quot;I could see how it wouldn&#x27;t work at &quot;SNL&quot; because she&#x27;s got her own voice, she&#x27;s very much Sarah Silverman all the time. She can play a character but she doesn&#x27;t disappear into the character—she makes the character her.&quot; Silverman has retrospectively stated that she was not ready for &quot;SNL&quot; when she secured the job, and that when she was fired, it hurt her confidence for a year but nothing could hurt her thereafter. She has cited her &quot;SNL&quot; stint as a key reason why she has been so tough in her career, and later expressed gratitude that her time on the program was short as it did not wind up defining her. She parodied the situation when she appeared on &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot; episode &quot;The New Writer&quot; (1996), playing Sanders&#x27; new staff writer, whose jokes are not used because of the chauvinism and bias of the male chief comedy writer, who favors the jokes of his male co-writers. She appeared in three episodes of &quot;Larry Sanders&quot; during its final two seasons.

She also starred in the HBO sketch comedy series &quot;Mr. Show&quot; (1995–1997) and had the leading role for the 1997 independent film &quot;Who&#x27;s the Caboose?&quot;, about a pair of New York comedians (Silverman and director Sam Seder) going to Los Angeles during pilot season to try to get a part in a television series; the film features numerous young comedians in supporting roles but never received a widespread theatrical release. Silverman and Seder later made a six-episode television series sequel titled &quot;Pilot Season&quot; in which Silverman stars as the same character and Seder again directed. She made her network stand-up comedy debut on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; on July 3, 1997.

Silverman made several TV program guest appearances, including on &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; in the two-part time-travel episode &quot;Future&#x27;s End&quot; (1996); &quot;Seinfeld&quot; in the episode &quot;The Money&quot; (1997); &quot;V.I.P.&quot; in the episode &quot; Hours&quot; (2002); &quot;Greg the Bunny&quot; as a series regular (2002); and on the puppet television comedy &quot;Crank Yankers&quot; as the voice of Hadassah Guberman (since 2002). She had small parts in the films &quot;There&#x27;s Something About Mary&quot;, &quot;Say It Isn&#x27;t So&quot;, &quot;School of Rock&quot;, &quot;The Way of the Gun&quot;, &quot;Overnight Delivery&quot;, &quot;Screwed&quot;, &quot;Heartbreakers&quot;, &quot;Evolution&quot;, &quot;School for Scoundrels&quot;, &quot;Funny People&quot; and &quot;Rent&quot;, playing a mixture of comic and serious roles.

In 2005, Silverman released a concert film, &quot;Sarah Silverman: Jesus Is Magic&quot;, based on her one-woman show of the same name. Liam Lynch directed the film, which was distributed by Roadside Attractions. It received 64% positive ratings based on 84 reviews on the film critics aggregator Web site Rotten Tomatoes and earned approximately $1.3 million at the box office. As part of the film&#x27;s publicity campaign, she appeared online in &quot;Slate&quot; as the cover subject of &quot;Heeb&quot; magazine and in roasts on Comedy Central of Pamela Anderson and Hugh Hefner.

Silverman played a therapist in a skit for a bonus DVD of the album &quot;Lullabies to Paralyze&quot; by the band Queens of the Stone Age. Silverman also appears at the end of the video for American glam metal band Steel Panther&#x27;s &quot;Death To All But Metal&quot;. On &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, Silverman parodied sketches from &quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show&quot;, replaying Dave Chappelle&#x27;s characterizations of Rick James and &quot;Tyrone&quot; as well as a Donnell Rawlings character based on the miniseries &quot;Roots&quot;. In 2006, Silverman placed 50th on &quot;Maxim&quot; Hot 100 List. In 2007, she placed 29th and appeared on the cover.

===2007–2010: &quot;The Sarah Silverman Program&quot;===

Her television sitcom, &quot;The Sarah Silverman Program&quot;, debuted on Comedy Central in February 2007; the series had 1.81 million viewers and portrayed the day-to-day adventures of fictionalized versions of Silverman, her sister Laura and their friends. A number of comedic actors from &quot;Mr. Show&quot; have appeared on &quot;The Sarah Silverman Program&quot;. Silverman was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for her acting on the show. At the awards ceremony, she wore a fake mustache. Comedy Central canceled &quot;The Sarah Silverman Program&quot; after three seasons.

In June 2007, she hosted the MTV Movie Awards. During her opening act, she commented on the upcoming jail sentence of Paris Hilton, who was in the audience, saying: &quot;In a couple of days, Paris Hilton is going to jail. As a matter of fact, I heard that to make her feel more comfortable in prison, the guards are going to paint the bars to look like penises. I think it is wrong, too. I just worry she is going to break her teeth on those things.&quot; In September 2007, she appeared at the &quot;MTV Video Music Awards&quot;. Following the comeback performance of Britney Spears, Silverman mocked her on stage, saying: &quot;Yo, she is amazing, man. I mean, she is 25 years old, and she has already accomplished everything she&#x27;s going to accomplish in her life.&quot;

In January 2008, she appeared on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; to show Jimmy Kimmel, her boyfriend at the time, a special video. The video turned out to be a song called &quot;I&#x27;m Fucking Matt Damon&quot; in which she and Matt Damon sang a duet about having an affair behind Kimmel&#x27;s back. The video created an &quot;instant YouTube sensation.&quot; She won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics at the 60th Primetime Emmy Awards. Kimmel responded with his own video a month later with Damon&#x27;s friend Ben Affleck, which enlisted a panoply of stars to record Kimmel&#x27;s song &quot;I&#x27;m Fucking Ben Affleck&quot;. On September 13, 2008, Silverman won a Creative Arts Emmy Award for writing the song &quot;I&#x27;m Fucking Matt Damon&quot;. Silverman guest-starred in a second-season episode of the USA cable program &quot;Monk&quot; as Marci Maven. She returned in the sixth-season premiere and for the 100th episode. According to the audio commentary on the &quot;Clerks II&quot; DVD, director Kevin Smith offered her the role that eventually went to Rosario Dawson, but she turned it down out of fear of being typecast in &quot;girlfriend roles&quot;. However, she told Smith the script was &quot;really funny&quot; and mentioned that if the role of Randal Graves was being offered to her she &quot;would do it in a heartbeat.&quot; She appeared in &quot;Strange Powers&quot;, the 2009 documentary by Kerthy Fix and Gail O&#x27;Hara about cult songwriter Stephin Merritt and his band The Magnetic Fields. Silverman wrote a comic memoir, &quot;The Bedwetter: Stories of Courage, Redemption, and Pee&quot;, which was published in 2010.

===2011–present: Career expansion ===
Silverman played Geraldine alongside Michelle Williams and Seth Rogen in &quot;Take This Waltz&quot;, written and directed by Sarah Polley. The film was well received when it premiered at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) and was picked up by Magnolia for U.S. distribution in summer 2012. At TIFF, she told the press she had deliberately gained weight for the part, which required a nude scene, emphasizing that Polley wanted &quot;real bodies and real women&quot;. In interviews, she warned fans not to expect too much. However, she later told podcaster and author Julie Klausner that she had not really gained weight and that the statements were meant as self-deprecating humor.

On September 20, 2012, Silverman made a public service announcement (PSA) criticizing new voter identification laws that create obstacles to the ability of certain groups to vote in the November presidential election, i.e., non-citizen immigrants voting illegally. The project was financed by the Jewish Council for Education &amp; Research (JCER) and was co-produced by Mik Moore and Ari Wallach (the pair that also co-produced The Great Schlep and Scissor Sheldon).

Silverman voiced Vanellope von Schweetz, one of the main characters in the 2012 Disney animated film &quot;Wreck-It Ralph&quot;. She reprised the role in the 2018 sequel &quot;Ralph Breaks the Internet&quot;. She is in the creative team that writes and produces the content for the YouTube comedy channel called Jash. The other partners are Michael Cera, Reggie Watts and Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim (also known as Tim &amp; Eric). The JASH channel premiered online March 10, 2013. In Seth MacFarlane&#x27;s western comedy film, &quot;A Million Ways to Die in the West&quot;, she played Ruth, a prostitute, who is in love with Edward (Giovanni Ribisi). It was released on May 30, 2014.

Additionally, Silverman starred in a pilot for NBC called Susan in 313, ordered for the 2012-2013 season but ultimately not picked up. Among the those acting in the show were Tig Notaro, June Diane Raphael, Ken Leung, Jeff Goldblum, and Harris Wittels. &quot;Variety&quot; praised the pilot but noted that it was likely too niche for the network. Silverman herself said NBC probably made the right decision and that network television&#x27;s structure may not have suited her. 

In 2013, HBO announced that Silverman would star with Patti LuPone and Topher Grace in a situation comedy pilot called &quot;People in New Jersey&quot;, produced by &quot;SNL&quot;″s Lorne Michaels. The pilot was not picked up for a series order.

Before the second volume of &quot;RWBY&quot;&#x27;s Volume 2 premiered in 2015, the show&#x27;s staff had gotten word that Silverman would be the voice actor for Neopolitan. However, according to the show&#x27;s companion book, the voice acting role &quot;never solidified.&quot;

From 2017 to 2018, she hosted the Hulu streaming television late-night talk show &quot;I Love You, America with Sarah Silverman&quot;. On October 10, 2019, she was featured in a 30-minute YouTube documentary called &quot;Laughing Matters&quot;, created by SoulPancake in collaboration with Funny or Die, wherein a variety of comedians discuss mental health.

After being unable to do stand-up shows during the COVID-19 pandemic, Silverman launched &quot;The Sarah Silverman Podcast&quot; in October 2020, in which she discusses topics ranging from her personal life to societal issues, politics and current events, as well as responding to listener call-ins.

In 2022 she adapted &quot;The Bedwetter&quot; into an off-Broadway musical. She wrote the book and lyrics to the musical. The production premiered at the Atlantic Theatre Company&#x27;s Linda Gross Theatre and ran from April 30 through July 10, 2022. The musical starred Caissie Levy and Bebe Neuwirth and was directed by Anne Kauffman. Silverman received Drama Desk Award and Outer Critics Circle Award nominations for her work.

In 2023 her hour long stand-up comedy special &quot;Someone You Love&quot; premiered on the HBO streaming service Max. It was the first stand-up comedy special to premiere on Max. It was filmed at the Wilbur Theater in Boston, and debuted her new song, &quot;Something to Tell You&quot;. The special received a Golden Globe nomination, and won the Writers Guild of American Award for Outstanding Comedy/Variety Special.

In February 2024 she began hosting &quot;Stupid Pet Tricks,&quot; a TV series on TBS. This comedy variety show is based on David Letterman&#x27;s popular segment on his &quot;The Late Show with David Letterman.&quot; The series give pet owners a chance to showcase their own pet&#x27;s silly antics. The show will have a ten-episode first season.

==Controversies==

In 2001, Silverman used the racial slur &quot;chink&quot; in an ironic fashion in the context of a joke during a TV interview with Conan O&#x27;Brien. Guy Aoki of the Media Action Network for Asian Americans (MANAA) publicly objected to her use of the slur, and the two had an open discussion on &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot; with Bill Maher. Silverman defended the joke and did not apologize. In an interview in the 2017 docu-series &quot;The History of Comedy&quot;, Silverman stated that she learned a lot from the experience, including that her comedy style isn&#x27;t for everyone, but she does not want to be viewed as racist because that was not her intent.

In a 2007 episode of &quot;The Sarah Silverman Program&quot;, her character wore blackface and said &quot;I look like the beautiful Queen Latifah.&quot; Silverman said in 2019 that a resurfaced still from the sketch had recently caused her to be fired from an unnamed film.

During the MTV Movie Awards in June 2007, which she hosted, Silverman joked in her opening monologue about Paris Hilton going to jail for violating probation on an alcohol-related drunk-driving conviction, making Hiltonwho was in the live audiencenoticeably uncomfortable. She later apologized for the jokes. Later that year, Silverman was criticized for mocking Britney Spears&#x27; &quot;slutty clothes&quot; and calling her two sons &quot;adorable mistakes&quot; at the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards. Her monologue garnered renewed criticism in 2021 shortly after the release of the documentary &quot;Framing Britney Spears&quot;, in the wake of which Silverman expressed regret over her remarks and claimed that she had not seen Spears&#x27; performance before taking the stage.

In 2019, Silverman received death wishes from two Baptist pastors over her 2005 routine &quot;Jesus is Magic&quot;, where she joked about killing Jesus: &quot;I&#x27;m glad the Jews killed Jesus. I&#x27;d do it again!&quot; In response, Silverman condemned the pastors and the &quot;manipulation of what can be true&quot;.

In 2023, during the Israel-Hamas war, Silverman was criticized for sharing an Instagram post on her story that supported Israel&#x27;s restriction of food, water and electricity to Gaza. Silverman later took the post down, claiming she had not read it in full before posting.

==Personal life==
Silverman became a vegetarian at the age of 10. She is open about her lifelong battle with clinical depression, which at one point led to her developing an addiction to Xanax. She credited her subsequent emotional health to taking the prescription drug Zoloft. She struggled with bedwetting from the time she was young until well into her teens and stated in a 2007 interview that she had wet the bed recently.

Silverman&#x27;s autobiography, published in April 2010, titled &quot;The Bedwetter&quot;, explores the subject of bedwetting as well as other personal stories from her life. She stated she did not want to get married until same-sex couples were able to. In 2014, she tweeted &quot;Just read that I wanna get married which is hilarious b/c I will never get married,&quot; adding, &quot;Why would I want the govt involved in my love life? Ew. It&#x27;s barbaric.&quot;

She stated that she does not want to have biological children because &quot;there&#x27;s just millions of kids that have no parents&quot; in the world and to avoid the risk that they might inherit her depression. In 2017, Silverman also said that she has prioritized her artistic career, constantly on tour, instead of motherhood.

Silverman&#x27;s real-life sister Laura played her sister on &quot;The Sarah Silverman Program&quot;. Another older sister, Susan, is a rabbi who lives in Jerusalem with her husband, Yosef Abramowitz, the co-founder and president of Arava Power Company, and their five children. Silverman considers herself culturally Jewish, which she has frequently mined for material, but says she is agnostic and does not follow Judaism, stating, &quot;I have no religion. But culturally I can&#x27;t escape it; I&#x27;m very Jewish.&quot;

In July 2016, Silverman spent a week in the intensive care unit at Cedars Sinai Hospital with epiglottitis.

In an interview on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; in October 2018, Silverman revealed that she was one of several female comedians who witnessed fellow comic Louis C.K. masturbate, which she said was a consensual act. Silverman stated she felt the act was not abusive, because of the absence of a power differential between the two, but also stated that due to context, it was &quot;not analogous&quot; to what C.K. had done with the other women, which she said was &quot;not OK&quot;.

She previously lived in West Hollywood, California. She currently lives in Los Feliz and has a property in East Village, Manhattan, New York City.

In 2022, Silverman revealed on her own podcast that she has misophonia, having first noticed it when she was a teenager.

===Relationships===
Silverman dated comedian Kevin Brennan in 1988.

Silverman dated comedian and fellow &quot;SNL&quot; writer Dave Attell.

Silverman began dating Jimmy Kimmel in 2002. She referred to the relationship in some of her comedy, joking: &quot;I&#x27;m Jewish, but I wear this Saint Christopher medal sometimes; my boyfriend is Catholic – but you know ... it was cute the way he gave it to me. He said if it doesn&#x27;t burn a hole through my skin, it will protect me.&quot; In July 2008, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; reported that the couple had split. However, in October 2008, the media reported they were on &quot;the road back to being together&quot;. The couple attended the wedding of Howard Stern and Beth Ostrosky, but split again in March 2009. Sarah dated &quot;Family Guy&quot;″s Executive Producer Alec Sulkin for a brief while in 2010.

At the Emmy Awards in August 2014, Silverman acknowledged she and Welsh actor Michael Sheen were in a relationship. Silverman said in February 2018 that the two had broken up over the holidays.

On Howard Stern&#x27;s SiriusXM radio show on November 17, 2020, she stated she was dating Rory Albanese, the former showrunner of &quot;The Daily Show&quot;.

:&quot;Rory Albanese works on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live&quot; alongside his comedian girlfriend&#x27;s ex.&quot; — Entertainment Tonight, December 1, 2023 

==Politics and activism==
In 2015, Silverman signed an open letter which the ONE Campaign had been collecting signatures for; the letter was addressed to Angela Merkel and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, urging them to focus on women, as they served as the head of the G7 in Germany and the African Union in Ethiopia, respectively, which would start to set the priorities in development funding in advance of a main UN summit in September 2015 that would establish new development goals for a generation.

Leading up to the 2016 US presidential election, she became increasingly politically active. In 2015, Silverman endorsed Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders for President of the United States, saying: &quot;He says what he means and he means what he says and he&#x27;s not for sale.&quot; She had previously introduced Sanders at a rally in Los Angeles, California that drew an audience of over 27,500 people.

She initially supported Sanders, but following the Democratic nomination later spoke in support of Hillary Clinton at the 2016 Democratic National Convention. In her convention speech, she urged other Sanders supporters to back Clinton and, later, amid boos from some Sanders supporters, said: &quot;Can I just say? To the &#x27;Bernie or Bust&#x27; people, you&#x27;re being ridiculous&quot;. In addition to discussing her regular use of cannabis on &quot;Conan&quot; and at the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards, Silverman has been vocal in her opposition to racial bias and unfair arrests for cannabis possession. She supports social justice programs to find work opportunities for non-violent offenders and was a primary investor in Lowell Herb Co, aiming to end cannabis prohibition in the United States.

Silverman again endorsed Bernie Sanders and campaigned for him for the 2020 US presidential election.

On September 23, 2020, she encouraged her Instagram followers to contact VoteRiders, a voter ID education organization, to make sure they have the necessary ID to vote&quot;.

In July 2023, Silverman and two other authors sued the tech companies OpenAI and Meta Platforms, alleging that the defendants&#x27; respective language models ChatGPT and LLaMA were trained on the plaintiffs&#x27; books without permission or compensation and that they had obtained said books through an illegal venue.

In October 2023, Silverman posted several social media posts and stories in support of Israel during the 2023 Israel–Hamas war. She also left the Democratic Socialists of America after being a member for several years, citing their published response to the initial Hamas attacks and lack of support for Israel.

<text>Kaldbaksbotnur is a village on the island of Streymoy in the Faroe Islands.

==Geography==

Kaldbaksbotnur is located on the east coast of Streymoy. The village consists two farms. One farm is located in the bottom of Kaldbaksfjørður on the western side of the river and this farm is also called Northern part of Sund. The other is on the eastern side of the river and relates to Kaldbak. When the road to Tórshavn opened in 1980 this connected both Kaldbaksbotnur and Kaldbak to the island&#x27;s road network.

In 1992 the 2816m tunnel &quot;Kollfjarðartunnilin&quot; was opened from Kaldbaksbotnur to Kollafjørður and this is now the main route from Tórshavn to the villages in the north of the island.

Throughout the 1990s Kaldbaksbotnur was served by bus route 4 operated by the blue Bygdaleiðir country buses which passed through the village on their route from Tórshavn to Kaldbak. Route 5, added in 2001, also ran from Tórshavn through Kaldbaksbotnur to the township of Kollafjørður. Since 2003, route 4 is running to Kollafjørður, while route 5 is running to Kaldbak. Both operate several times per day.

There is a Danish Navy base in the mountains above Kaldbaksbotnur in a valley called Mjørkadalur (Fog Valley). On the top of the mountains there is a NATO early-warning radar system.

==Geology==
A sample of stalagmitic white Mordenite (Na2CaK2)Al2Si10O24·7H2O) from Kaldbaksbotnur was collected by Volker Betz and can be seen at http://www.mindat.org/photo-177823.html

==Kaldbaksbotnur in music==
Kaldbaksbotnur is referred to in a song &quot;Útsetin&quot; performed by Teitur Lassen on his 2007 album Káta Hornið. It is performed in the Faroese language but the extract below (the 3rd and 4th verses out of eight) includes an English translation:

<doc id="1152238" wikidata="Q375415" url="?curid=1152238" title="Kirkja">
<text>Kirkja () is a village on the island of Fugloy, Faroe Islands. It is located on the south-tip of the island, and its land is stretching all over the western side of the island, including a small enclave in the now uninhabited &quot;Skarðsvík.&quot; Here archaeologists have located an old settlement that has probably been only a part-time settlement used either by people from Kirkja or Hattarvík.

==Transportation==
Kirkja is one of two villages on the island of Fugloy that are connected both by the road built in the 1980s and by the ferry that connects both Kirkja and Hattarvík to Hvannasund on the larger island of Viðoy, and in the last two decades the island can also be reached by helicopter either from the national airport in Vágar, the national capital of Tórshavn or the regional capital Klaksvík.

&quot;Kirkja&quot; means &quot;church&quot; and &quot;Fugloy&quot; means &quot;bird-island&quot; in Faroese. From here there is a view over the sound Fugloyarfjørður towards the capes of Svínoy and also towards the northernmost cape of the Faroes, Enniberg on Viðoy – one of the highest cliffs in the world – and the rounded isthmus of Viðareiði that has been a favorite motif for Faeroese and foreign painters throughout the past century because of its tremendously beautiful sunset. Kirkja thereby offers panoramas in the Faroes, making it a tourist attraction.

<doc id="1152241" wikidata="Q5327743" url="?curid=1152241" title="East Asian blepharoplasty">
<text>East Asian blepharoplasty, more commonly known as double eyelid surgery, is a cosmetic procedure that reshapes the skin around the eye to create a crease in an upper eyelid that naturally lacks one. Although 70-83% of East Asian women naturally have upper eyelid creases, it is estimated that 17-30% of Chinese and Japanese women lack this feature. This surgery may be performed on individuals of East Asian descent, including those from Chinese, Japanese, and Korean backgrounds. The primary goal is to enhance the eyelid&#x27;s appearance, making the eyes appear larger and, according to some cultural aesthetics, more attractive due to a &#x27;wide eyed&#x27; and expressive appearance.

== Historical context ==
The procedure was first performed in 1896 by Dr. Kotaro Mikamo in Japan, a period marked by significant Western influence following the Meiji Restoration. Mikamo&#x27;s introduction of the surgery has been interpreted in different ways. Although the majority of Japanese women naturally have double eyelids, one perspective sometimes held by Westerners is that the procedure was intended to &quot;westernize&quot; the eyes of Japanese women, influenced by Western beauty standards that were purportedly becoming increasingly prevalent in Japan during the Meiji period.
However, Mikamo recorded that the 82-83% of Japanese women actually have the double eyelid appearance, making it a physiologically normative feature among the population. He described the single-eyelid look as being &quot;monotonous and expressionless,&quot; suggesting that his motivation for the surgery was rooted in enhancing natural beauty rather than conforming to Western ideals. According to this perspective, Mikamo was working within existing Japanese aesthetics and norms, aiming to accentuate a feature that was already prevalent and culturally appreciated in Japan.

== Surgical techniques ==
Asian blepharoplasty is primarily performed using two techniques: non-incisional and incisional methods.

=== Non-incisional Technique (Suture Ligation) ===
The non-incisional method, or suture ligation, involves the strategic placement of sutures through all layers of the upper eyelid at the level of the upper tarsal margin. This technique facilitates adhesion between the subdermal tissues and the underlying levator aponeurosis, effectively creating the eyelid crease. It is less complex and has a shorter operation time, leading to a quicker recovery and fewer complications compared to more invasive methods. However, it tends to produce a static eyelid crease that does not vary with facial expressions and may diminish over time. Additionally, the underlying sutures can sometimes lead to corneal irritation.

=== Incisional Technique (Surgical Resection) ===
The incisional method, known as surgical resection, entails making an incision across the upper eyelid to remove excessive tissue, including skin, subcutaneous fat, orbicularis oculi muscle, and other anatomical components. This approach not only allows for the creation of a more dynamic and permanent eyelid crease but also can address other aesthetic concerns by removing excess skin and fat. The results are more aligned with the natural anatomy of the eye, making the crease appear more natural and dynamic. However, this method is more complex, requiring a longer operation and recovery time. One significant risk is lagophthalmos, where excessive removal of lid tissue can prevent the eyelid from fully closing.

Each of these techniques offers distinct advantages and poses specific challenges, making the choice between them dependent on individual anatomical and aesthetic considerations.

== Non-Surgical Double Eyelid Formation (Eyelid Training &amp; Adhesives) ==
Non-surgical methods for double eyelid formation involve the use of eyelid training tapes, adhesives, and crease reinforcement techniques. These approaches aim to create a fold in the upper eyelid without the need for invasive surgery.

=== Types of Non-Surgical Methods ===

# Temporary Adhesives &amp; Tapes: Products such as D-UP Wonder Eyelid Tape, AB Mezical Fiber Tape, and Eye Charm create a temporary crease by pulling the eyelid skin together. However, these are primarily for short-term use and do not train the skin to retain the crease over time.
# Eyelid Training Tapes: Unlike traditional eyelid tapes that rely solely on surface adhesion, some structured eyelid training tapes are designed to influence skin tension over time. Optifold, for example, uses a structured adhesive bandage that applies compression and skin tension realignment, encouraging the skin to develop a natural crease with repeated use.

=== Benefits of Eyelid Training Tapes ===

* Non-invasive alternative to surgery
* Gradual formation of a natural-looking double eyelid crease
* No risk of surgical complications such as scarring or lagophthalmos
* Adjustable and customizable for different eyelid types
* Reversible and allows users to test different crease positions before committing to permanent changes

=== Limitations ===

* Requires consistent use for several months for best results
* Effectiveness depends on eyelid skin thickness and individual biological factors
* Not as immediate or permanent as surgical procedures

== Modern trends ==
East Asian blepharoplasty have been reported to be the most common aesthetic procedure in Taiwan, South Korea and other parts of East Asia and is also frequently performed in Northeast Indian states such as Assam. The procedure has been reported to have some risk of complications, but is generally quite safe if done by an expert plastic surgeon. Practitioners of East Asian blepharoplasty include plastic surgeons (facial plastic and reconstructive surgeons), otolaryngologists, oral and maxillofacial surgeons, and ophthalmologists (oculoplastic surgeons). A procedure to remove the epicanthal fold (i.e., an epicanthoplasty) is often performed in conjunction with an East Asian blepharoplasty.

<text>Innovative Research Universities (IRU), formerly Innovative Research Universities Australia, is a network of eight comprehensive universities in Australia.

The main purpose of the group is to undertake advocacy on issues related to higher education policy, research and university students.

The IRU has eight university members: Charles Darwin University, James Cook University, Griffith University, La Trobe University, Flinders University, Murdoch University, Western Sydney University and the University of Canberra. Between them, the universities enrol over 238,000 students including around 55,000 international students.

The IRU is one of the four main university groupings in Australia. The other groups are Australian Technology Network, Group of Eight and Regional Universities Network.

== History ==
In 2003, a group of universities sharing common origins established the Innovative Research Universities a collaborative network to enhance the outcomes of higher education. The members were established as research-intensive universities during the 1960s and 1970s.

The founding six universities were: Flinders University, Griffith University, La Trobe University, Macquarie University, Murdoch University and The University of Newcastle. James Cook University joined in 2007, followed by Charles Darwin University in 2009. These additions were balanced as first Macquarie (2008) and then Newcastle (2014) left the group to pursue their future independently. In 2017, Western Sydney University joined, followed by the University of Canberra in 2021.

<text>Nólsoy (, previously also &quot;Nölsoy&quot;; ; ) is an island and village with a population of 230 people in central Faroe Islands, 4km east of the capital Tórshavn in Streymoy. 

==Description==

Nólsoy is the lowest of the Faroes; the highest point is Eggjarklettur (372 m) on the mountain &quot;Høgoyggj&quot;. The southern coast contains two capes, each with a lighthouse (Øknastangi on the south-east, Borðan on the south). The lighthouses were built in the late 18th century to aid smugglers working against the unpopular trading monopoly imposed by Denmark. In 2005, the National Bank of Denmark issued a 20 DKK commemorative coin for the lighthouse.

There is only one settlement on the island, also called Nólsoy, on the north-west coast on the Stongin peninsula which is attached to the rest of the island by a metres-wide isthmus. The small coastal village is made up of colourful homes and buildings, placed extremely close to each other to help shelter each other from storms. The island is accessible by a 20-minute ferry journey from Tórshavn. As many as 40 people that live in Nólsoy go to work in Tórshavn each morning. In recent years many young families have moved from Tórshavn to Nólsoy where the houses are cheaper than in Tórshavn. This way it is possible to live &quot;in the country&quot; and still be only 20 minutes from the capital.
Nólsoy is the most populous of the Faroe islands not to have an existing or planned road connection to the rest of the archipelago.

Ruins in Korndalur (Corn Valley) are associated with the legendary Princess of Nólsoy.

==Etymology==
Old Norse &quot;nór&quot; (genitive nórs) refers to a narrow stretch of land in a body of
water.

==People from Nólsoy==
Nólsoy has an annual civic festival called Ovastevna, held at the beginning of August. Ovastevna is similar to Ólavsøka in Tórshavn only smaller. Ovastevna is held to commemorate Ove Joensen from Nólsoy. He rowed from the Faroe Islands to Denmark in a traditional Faeroese boat in 1986. In 1987 Ove drowned in Skálafjørður-inlet where he fell overboard. The profit from the festival is used to build a swimming pool for the children in Nólsoy. Ove originally started this project after his row to Denmark.

Nólsoyar Páll came from Nólsoy. He is recognized as a kind of freedom fighter and national hero. He fought to end the Royal Trade Monopoly in the beginning of 19th century. The Royal Trade Monopoly was exhausting and impoverishing the people of the Faroe Islands from 1271 to 1856. Nólsoyar Páll carried trade between Denmark and Faroe Islands in his ship ‘Royndin Frida’. His ship was the first Faeroese ocean-going vessel since the early Middle Ages.

==Climate==
==Wildlife==
Nólsoy has one of the world&#x27;s largest colonies of European storm petrels (50,000 pairs). Mountain hares and house mice were introduced by humans, and Nólsoy has its own subspecies of house mouse &quot;Mus m. domesticus faroeensis&quot;, one of the largest in the world. Nólsoy is also home to the first known wild population of common frogs in the Faroe Islands.

===Important Bird Area===
The island has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because of its significance as a breeding site for seabirds, especially European storm petrels, Atlantic puffins (30,000 pairs) and black guillemots (100 pairs).

==Nólsoy on Faroese stamps==
Nólsoy has featured on a number of stamps from Postverk Føroya:

<doc id="1152260" wikidata="Q7776728" url="?curid=1152260" title="The Young &amp; Moody Band">
<text>The Young &amp; Moody Band was a British blues rock band from the late 1970s to the early 1980s, headed by Status Quo co-writer Bob Young and Whitesnake guitarist Micky Moody. The two met for the first time in 1975, when Moody&#x27;s band, Snafu, supported Status Quo on tour. They formed a friendship and in their spare time began writing songs together. Over a period of several years, they collected enough material for two albums and several singles.

The band started under the name &quot;Young &amp; Moody&quot;, releasing a self-titled album on Magnet Records in 1977. Later they changed their name to The Young &amp; Moody Band. Their 1981 single &quot;Don&#x27;t Do That&quot; also featured Lemmy from Motörhead, Cozy Powell and The Nolans and charted at No. 63 on the UK Singles Chart.

Their follow-up single, &quot;These Eyes&quot;, was used in a UK jeans commercial (). Graham Bonnet (ex Rainbow) supplied the vocals (but not on the single) and the lyrics &#x27;these eyes&#x27; were replaced with the word &#x27;Levis&#x27;. Written by Young and Moody, it was sung by Ed Hamilton, who also wrote &quot;Night Games&quot; from Bonnet&#x27;s third album &quot;Line-Up&quot;. Both tracks were available as singles on Bronze Records and featured on the compilation album &quot;A Quiet Night In&quot;. When released on that compilation album, it earned international gold discs.

<doc id="1152262" wikidata="Q4787153" url="?curid=1152262" title="Architecture of Limerick">
<text>As with other cities in Ireland, Limerick has a history of great architecture. A 1574 document, prepared for the Spanish ambassador, describes some of the wealth and architecture in the city:
:&quot;Limerick is stronger and more beautiful than all the other cities of Ireland, well walled with stout walls of hewn marble... There is no entrance except by stone bridges, one of the two of which has 14 arches, and the other 8 ... for the most part the houses are of square stone of black marble and built in the form of towers and fortresses.&quot;
Present-day Limerick has perhaps not as extensive historical architecture as other Irish cities, though some notable examples remain, such as the 800-year-old St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral and King John&#x27;s Castle.

==Ecclesiastical architecture==
;St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral
St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral is the older of Limerick&#x27;s two cathedrals and dates from the 12th century. The cathedral has elements of both Romanesque and Gothic styles of architecture with Romanesque arches and doorways and Gothic windows. The plan and elevation of the cathedral show signs of the design being an altered over the years. The original plan of the church was in the form of a Latin cross. Additions were made to the cathedral during the episcopate of Stephen Wall, Bishop of Limerick. The Romanesque doorway on the west side is an impressive carving of chevrons and patterns. Like many medieval churches in Ireland, the building has been heavily restored by the Victorians. The cathedral plays a dominant role in this medieval area within Limerick City showing the amalgamation of the architectural styles of Romanesque and Gothic. The tower of St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral was added in the 14th century, and it rises to 120 feet

;St. John&#x27;s Cathedral

The main body of St. John&#x27;s Cathedral was designed by English architect Philip Charles Hardwick, and constructed between 1856 and 1861. It has the tallest spire in Ireland at 94m (a later addition, designed by M.A. Hennessy and completed in 1883). The exterior of St. John&#x27;s was completely refurbished in 2004, with new roofing and repointing of all stonework. The cathedral today cuts an imposing presence on an otherwise undeveloped side of the city centre. An important historical Protestant church sits near the cathedral also, and although in need of some repair, is now in use today by Dance Limerick.

;St. Munchin&#x27;s Church, Englishtown
The church was constructed by architect James Pain in 1837 replacing an earlier structure. The church is Gothic in design.

;St. John&#x27;s Church, Irishtown
Constructed in 1851 by architect Joseph Welland the church replaced an earlier dating from the 11th century. This important historic site is adjacent to the former John&#x27;s Gate and the town walls where the existing Citadel is located and incorporated within St. John&#x27;s Hospital. The church has Romanesque features.

;Franciscan Church, Henry Street
Designed by William Corbett, the church is a fine example of classical architecture with an imposing portico in a similar fashion to the GPO in O&#x27;Connell Street, Dublin and the Bank of Ireland in College Green. The church dates from 1826.

;Sacred Heart Church, The Crescent
Designed by William Corbett, the church dates from 1832. Built in the classical style the facade is a centrepiece to The Crescent area of Georgian Limerick. The very fine classical interior, with a wealth of quality materials and craftsmanship, adds to the overall architectural importance of this ecclesiastical site.

;St Saviour&#x27;s Church (Dominicans)
The existing church in Glentworth Street was built in 1815, under the leadership of Fr Joseph Harrigan on land donated by Edward Henry, the Earl of Limerick. It replaced a church on Fish Lane. In 1973 it was elevated to a parish church. It as renjuvated in the 1860s by the architect John Wallace. The priory was built in 1943.

==Medieval Limerick==

The medieval city of Limerick is largely concentrated on the southern section of Kings Island known as Englishtown and south of the Abbey river in an area known as Irishtown, just to the north of the present day city center. The island contains some of Limerick&#x27;s main attractions including King John&#x27;s Castle which was completed in around 1200. The walls, towers and fortifications remain today. The remains of a Viking settlement was also uncovered during the construction of the visitor centre at the site. St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral was founded in 1168 and is recorded as the oldest building in Limerick. It was built on an earlier castle belonging to the King of Munster. Nicholas street and Mary Street the medieval center of Limerick contained many examples of medieval buildings including tall gabled houses in the Flemish or Dutch fashion. Unfortunately, very little, if any of this streetscape remains today. Following the development of Newtown Pery this area of the city went into decline. Today both the Englishtown and Irishtown areas remain neglected and dilapidated in appearance.

Castle Lane beside King Johns Castle includes a reconstruction of some medieval buildings including a granary, labourers cottage, and gabled houses. The development is mainly for tourism purposes.

==Georgian architecture==

Much Georgian architecture was evident in the city from about the 1800s onwards. Although some has since been demolished, much of the city centre area is built in the Georgian fashion. John&#x27;s Square, in front of St. John&#x27;s Cathedral, towards the city centre, is an example of this. Stone-faced Georgian offices and townhouses were built in a planned fashion around this square. The development of Georgian Limerick was driven by Edmund Sexton Pery, speaker of the Irish House of Commons, and his name has been retained in the Georgian city centre; Newtown Pery. This development extended the city south of the Abbey river and the ancient medieval city. During this time most of the walls of the medieval city were torn down to facilitate the expansion of the city. The new city, Newtown Pery was built completely in Georgian style with long wide and elegant streets in grid plan design with O&#x27;Connell Street (previously Georges street) as its centre. The new Georgian town became the new economic and cultural centre of Limerick as the medieval city along with its main street, Nicholas street, fell largely into decline. Much of the Georgian architecture is still largely intact with the Crescent area of O&#x27; Connell street and Pery Square being among some of the finest examples of Georgian architecture in Ireland. One publicly accessible example of Georgian architecture is the People&#x27;s Museum of Limerick at Pery Square. However much of the area is now in a neglected or decaying state while much of the more ornate styles around the retail areas of O&#x27; Connell street, William street and Sarsfield street has been lost and replaced with more modern styles of architecture.
The Hunt Museum is based in the historic 18th-century former Custom House. The museum was established to house a collection of approximately 2,000 works of art and antiquities formed by John and Gertrude Hunt during their lifetimes.

==Victorian and Edwardian architecture==
From the 19th century much Victorian and Edwardian architecture was evident in Limerick. Unified terraces, detached or semi detached dwellings were built by the middle classes on roads protruding from the city centre as can be seen today in O&#x27; Connell Avenue, South and North Circular Roads, Ennis Road, Shelbourne Road and Mulgrave Street. Typical features of this style of architecture in Limerick include arched or bay windows with brick detailing around doorways and elaborate railings enclosing long front gardens. Features of buildings dating from the Edwardian period also include balconies, porched and timbered gables, and horizontal mullioned windows.

==20th century==

From the period of Irish Independence right up to the 1960s there was very little development in Limerick. Housing had become a major problem as many of the city&#x27;s poorer residents lived in overcrowded slums, streets and laneways in the oldest parts of the city. Life in these parts of the city in the early 20th century are perhaps best described in the worldwide best seller &quot;Angelas Ashes&quot; written by Frank McCourt. During the 1960s Limerick Corporation began to clear the slums and laneways by relocating families to new large council estates on the edge of the city. The estates were built primarily in Moyross, Southill, the Island Field (St. Marys Park) and Ballinacurra Weston. Initially seen to be a success these estates began to experience high levels of disadvantage, unemployment, poverty and crime as was replicated in other parts of Ireland such as Ballymun. However, since the early 21st century, the inner-city areas have experienced regeneration and revitalisation with funding and development from the City and County Council, as well as the Government. In the early 1990s the city developed Arthur&#x27;s Quay Park on the site of a surface car park as part of a plan for a pedestrian route along the waterfront. The park, designed by Murray Ó Laoire Architects, incorporated a tourist information office and received the RIAI Triennial Gold Medal for 1989–1991.

The city also expanded during this time with much development outside the city boundary creating new city suburbs. The most notable development is the University of Limerick in the suburb of Castletroy towards the eastern end of the city. UL is the location of the University Concert Hall, a 1000-seat venue on the university campus which is suitable for holding a wide variety of events. The UL arena, which opened in 2002 is Ireland&#x27;s largest indoor complex. It consists of the National 50m Swimming Pool which is the only water facility in Ireland which has the approval of FINA, the international swimming body, and is the first in the country to be built to Olympic standards. The Arena&#x27;s Indoor Sports Hall comprises 3,600 square metres laid out with four wood-sprung courts, catering for a variety of sports, a sprint track, an international 400m athletics track, and a 200m three-lane suspended jogging track. The facility also has a state-of-the-art cardiovascular and strength training centre, a weight-training room, team rooms, an aerobics studio and classroom areas. The Arena is often used by the Munster rugby team. On the southside of the city the Crescent Shopping Centre the largest shopping centre in Ireland outside Dublin was built in the suburb of Dooradoyle. It has a retail space of 100,000m squared with over 90 shops.

By the end of the 20th century and early 21st century Limerick&#x27;s trend towards suburbanisation continued which has led to many concerns of the development of the city during this time, particularly in relation to the amount of out-of-town retail developments which has reduced footfall on city centre streets. Since the early 2010s, significant efforts have been made to increase footfall in the city centre and to reduce ongoing surburbanisation, with streets seeing facelifts, community events arranged by the council and the restricted development of retail outside of the city centre and city boundaries. A notable example is the Crescent S.C.

==Bridges==

As a city situated on a river (the Shannon), and at a crossing point, Limerick&#x27;s bridges are of vital importance to the region. They connect the northern bank of the river, and County Clare, to the southern bank and County Limerick. Apart from forming part of the Limerick to Galway route, the crossings are important today in connecting Shannon Airport to the city and beyond.

===Thomond Bridge===

The earliest bridge, Thomond Bridge, was built near a fording point. It was the scene of a failed defending of the city during the Siege of Limerick. At one ends sits the Treaty Stone, which stands as a symbol of the signed treaty. The treaty itself was probably signed in a campaign tent. The current bridge was built in 1836, replacing the earlier bridge which was also alongside King John&#x27;s Castle. The bridge now forms part of the R445 (formerly N7), carrying traffic on the &quot;Northern Relief Road&quot;.

===Sarsfield Bridge===
The second of Limerick&#x27;s River Shannon crossings is now called Sarsfield Bridge, to commemorate Patrick Sarsfield, the Earl of Lucan, who is renowned in Limerick for his role in the Williamite War and the 1691 siege and Treaty of Limerick in particular. The bridge was opened as Wellesley Bridge on 5 August 1835, following 11 years of construction. It was designed by the Scottish engineer Alexander Nimmo and based on the Pont de Neuilly in Paris. It was a particularly important development for the city as it allowed expansion to the northern shore of the river. The bridge itself consists of five large and elegant elliptical arches with an open balustrade, running from a man-made island, originally called Wellesley Pier but now known as Shannon Island, to the northern shore, and a simple flat, swivel deck with iron lattice railings crossing a canal and road from the island to what was known as Brunswick Street, now Sarsfield Street. The swivel end is no longer functional, although some of its heavy machinery is still intact underneath the roadway. A lock system has replaced the swivel section to allow for the passage of smaller boats. Apart from this, the bridge has remained largely unchanged since it opened and still has its original lamp standards.
Rowing clubhouses sit on Shannon Island at either side of the bridge. The Shannon Rowing Club was founded by Sir Peter Tait in 1866 and has a very elegant clubhouse on the northern side. Limerick Boat Club was founded in 1870 and has a simpler structure on the southern side.

A monument by sculptor James Power located on the bridge just above the Limerick Boat Club building, commemorates the 1916 Rising. An earlier monument on this site was a statue of Viscount Fitzgibbon of Mountshannon House, who was killed in The Charge of the Light Brigade at Balaclava in 1854, flanked by two Russian cannon captured in the Crimean War. This statue was blown up by the Irish Republican Army in 1930. The War of Independence memorial is located at the northern end of the bridge, commemorating two former mayors of Limerick (George Clancy and Michael O&#x27;Callaghan), among others, who were killed by the British in 1921. The quays on the northern shore are called Clancy Strand and O&#x27;Callaghan Strand in their honour.

===Shannon Bridge===
The Shannon Bridge is by far the newest River Shannon crossing in Limerick city centre. It was built in the late 1980s, officially opening on 30 May 1988, and connects to a relief road that passes through a bird sanctuary and runs around the north of the city. The bridge is still at times referred to as &quot;The New Bridge&quot;, although the Abbey Bridge across the Abbey River is newer. For some time after its construction, the bridge was also termed &quot;The Whistling Bridge&quot; – the fencing on the bridge resonated with the winds coming up the Shannon Estuary, producing a shrill whistling sound. In extreme winds, the sound was quite deafening. Simple grills were added, and the effect was ceased.

===Baal&#x27;s Bridge===
This is one of the oldest bridges in the city. The current structure was built in between 1830 and 1831 and is a single-arched hump-back limestone bridge. It replaced an earlier four-arched bridge that formed the only link before the mid-18th century crossing the Abbey river between Englishtown and Irishtown. Early drawings show a row of houses on the bridge before it was replaced. During the construction of the new bridge in 1830 a significant archaeological object was found in the foundations of the old bridge. A brass Square of Freemasonry symbolism was found in the foundations with an inscription dating from 1507. Also inscribed on the square is the text &quot;I will strive to live with love and care upon the level, by the square&quot;. It is reputed to be one of the earliest Masonic items to be found in the world.

===Other bridges and the tunnel===
Another bridge at the northern end of King&#x27;s Island, connects to Corbally on the north of the city. This is a simpler bridge, further up the Shannon. The only other road bridge across the Shannon near the city is the &quot;University Bridge&quot;, at the University of Limerick. Opened in 2004 by then Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, this fashionable modern bridge connects the recently commenced north bank campus (includes student villages/accommodation and Health Science building) to the main southern campus, but it does not serve as a public crossing point as there is no north bank entrance from the Clare side.

The university is also home to one of the longest footbridges in Europe – The Living Bridge.

Another bridge is named after Dr. Sylvester O&#x27;Halloran, which opened in 1987.

The Limerick Tunnel opened in July 2010 as part of the Limerick Southern Road. The tunnel forms a fourth river crossing of the Shannon. It is a 675m long, twin-bore road tunnel underneath the River Shannon on the outskirts of the city.

==Architecture lost and found==

Much of Limerick&#x27;s architectural heritage has changed over the past few decades. The main streets in the city centre were originally fronted by mostly uniform Georgian townhouses. Today, gaps and oddities may be found, with a fusion of modern-style and Georgian architecture in one building. The most recent example of a controversial demolition was the Cruises Hotel. This was the oldest hotel in Limerick; Daniel O&#x27;Connell himself stayed in it. It was demolished in 1990 to allow the construction of the Cruises Street pedestrian area, which opened in 1992. The site of what was Cruise&#x27;s Hotel is now home to a Costa Coffee shop on the right-hand corner of the street entrance. Other examples of lost architecture include the facade of the old Cannock&#x27;s Department Store (now Penney&#x27;s), which was demolished in the 1960s and replaced with a more modern styled building. However, the landmark clock on top of the building remains, and was subject to a major restoration project in 2024. The facade of Todd&#x27;s Department Store (now Brown Thomas) which was destroyed by a fire in the late 1950s has also been replaced with a more modern design.

Since the late 1990s, Ireland has had somewhat tougher development requirements. This has resulted in an increasing number of Georgian and other historical buildings being refurbished rather than demolished. Examples include the conversion of a historic bank to a pub and the conversion of old stone-built warehouses, with some Georgian townhouses changed to become up-market apartments. These refurbishments of Georgian townhouses include cleaned brickwork, replica railings outside sash windows with brass catches, and new replica street railings. Several areas of the city have experienced restoration projects, such as on Mallow Street, Catherine Street, The Crescent and historical areas of King&#x27;s Island, which has seen a significant uplift in the 21st century. King John&#x27;s castle was redeveloped between 2011 and 2013 to become a major tourist attraction for the city.

==Modern architecture==
Although a lot of developments in Limerick were concentrated in suburban areas of the city in the early 21st century, there has been notable modern architectural developments and improvements in the appearance of city centre in recent years. Most developments have been along the banks of the river Shannon and are facing onto the river. The most prominent are the 60m high Riverpoint building designed by Burke Kennedy Doyle Architects and completed in 2008 and the 200 ft four-star Clayton Hotel on Steamboat Quay, designed by Limerick firm Murray Ó Laoire Architects and completed in 2002. Other developments include apartments and office blocks along the quay&#x27;s and in areas such as Mount Kenneth Place, Harvey&#x27;s Quay, Lower Cecil Street and Steamboat Quay. Other developments in the city centre include the successful redevelopment of Bedford Row, Henry Street, Thomas Street and Catherine Street.

In 2007, Thomond Park underwent a redevelopment project which included the construction of two large stands to accommodate a capacity attendance of 26,500 with 15,100 seated. The stadium has become an icon for Limerick City and in 2009, the design of the stadium, by Murray Ó Laoire Architects, won the people&#x27;s choice award from the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland. 

In 2023, a new International Rugby Experience attraction, built on the corner of O&#x27;Connell Street and Cecil Street in the city centre, opened to the public. The building&#x27;s architecture is built based on the neighbouring Georgian architecture on O&#x27;Connell Street. The JP McManus charitable foundation donated €30 million for the building&#x27;s development. The foundation offered the building to Limerick City and County Council in April 2024, however the council announced in October 2024 that after &quot;extensive due diligence&quot; they would not be able to cover the operational and funding cost of the faculty. The building, designed by Niall McLaughlin Architects, was crowned &#x27;Ireland&#x27;s Favourite Building&#x27; in 2023 by the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland through the Public Choice awards.

<text>Maria Grazia Cucinotta (; born 27 July 1968) is an Italian actress who has featured in films and television series since 1990. Internationally she is best known for her roles in &quot;Il Postino&quot; and as the Bond girl, credited as &quot;Cigar Girl&quot;, in the James Bond film &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Cucinotta was born in Messina in Sicily, Italy. Her breakthrough role as an actress came in 1994&#x27;s critically acclaimed &quot;Il Postino&quot;, directed by Michael Radford. Cucinotta played the lead female role of Beatrice Russo, the love interest of the main character Mario Ruoppolo, played by Massimo Troisi, who passed away shortly after the film&#x27;s completion.

Although it was her first major role, Troisi had no doubt about her abilities, as Cucinotta later recalled: He was a director and an actor who had the patience to teach me everything because I arrived at that audition recommended by a woman, Nathalie Caldonazzo, who was Massimo&#x27;s girlfriend. That film changed my life. I&#x27;m happy that people still talk about him and that film with which he brought Italianness around the world.In 1999 she guest starred in &quot;The Sopranos&quot; episode &quot;Isabella&quot; as the titular character.

In 2005 Cucinotta appeared on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;The Italian Bob&quot;, voicing Sideshow Bob&#x27;s wife, Francesca.

Cucinotta won the &quot;America Award&quot; of the Italy-USA Foundation in 2010.
In 2012, Cucinotta received a star on the Italian Walk of Fame in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

Maria Grazia Cucinotta is Roman Catholic and devoted to Saint Anthony of Padua.

<doc id="1152269" wikidata="Q1486702" url="?curid=1152269" title="Light Railways Act 1896">
<text>The Light Railways Act 1896 (59 &amp; 60 Vict. c. 48) was an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.

==History==
Before the act each new railway line built in the country required a specific act of Parliament to be obtained by the company that wished to construct it, which greatly added to the cost and time it took to construct new railways. The economic downturn of the 1880s had hit agriculture and rural communities in the United Kingdom especially hard and the government wished to facilitate the construction of railways in rural areas, especially to facilitate the transport of goods. The 1896 act defined a class of railways which did not require specific legislation to construct – companies could simply plan a line under the auspices of the new act, and, having obtained a light railway order, build and operate it. By reducing the legal costs and allowing new railways to be built quickly the government hoped to encourage companies to build the new &#x27;light railways&#x27; in areas of low population and industry that were previously of little interest to them. 

A light railway is not a tramway but a separate class of railway. The act was triggered by the complexity of creating the low-cost railways that were needed at the time in rural areas, and by the successful use of tramway rules to create the Wisbech and Upwell Tramway in 1882, which was in fact a light railway in all but name.

The Regulation of Railways Act 1868 (31 &amp; 32 Vict. c. 119) had permitted the construction of light railways subject to &#x27;...such conditions and regulations as the Board of Trade may from time to time impose or make&#x27;; for such railways it specified a maximum permitted axle weight and stated that &#x27;...the regulations respecting the speed of trains shall not authorize a speed exceeding at any time twenty-five miles an hour&#x27;.

The Light Railways Act 1896 did not specify any exceptions or limitations that should apply to light railways; it did not even attempt to define a &#x27;light railway&#x27;. However, it gave powers to a panel of three Light Railway Commissioners to include &#x27;provisions for the safety of the public... as they think necessary for the proper construction and working of the railway&#x27; in any light railway order (LRO) granted under the act. These could limit vehicle axle weights and speeds: the maximum speed of 25 miles per hour (mph) often associated with the Light Railways Act 1896 is not specified in the act but was a product of the earlier Regulation of Railways Act 1868 (31 &amp; 32 Vict. c. 119). However, limits were particularly needed when lightly laid track and relatively modest bridges were used in order to keep costs down. LROs could also exempt light railways from some of the requirements of a normal railway: level crossings did not have to be protected by gates, but only by cattle grids, saving the cost of both the gates and a keeper to operate them. It did not exclude standard-gauge track, but narrow-gauge tracks were used for many railways built under its provisions. Many of the railways built under the auspices of the act were very basic, with little or no signalling (many ran under the &#x27;one engine in steam&#x27; principle). 

A number of municipal and company-owned street tramways were built or extended by the act, in preference to the Tramways Act 1870 (33 &amp; 34 Vict. c. 78). The procedure of the 1896 act was simpler, permission easier to obtain (local authorities had the right to veto lines under the 1870 legislation), and there was a 75% savings on rates payable as compared to a tramway.

The Light Railways Act 1896 was never a great success. By the 1920s the use of road transport had killed the majority of these little railways, although some survived thanks to clever management and tight financial control. The act was repealed in 1993 for England and Wales by the Transport and Works Act 1992 and no new light railway orders were allowed to be issued for Scotland since 2007.

Until the Transport and Works Act 1992 introduced transport works orders, heritage railways in the UK were operated under light railway orders.

== Railways built under the act ==
=== Preserved ===
* Kent and East Sussex Railway, opened in 1900, final section closed in 1970 but part reopened in stages from 1974.
* Vale of Rheidol Light Railway, operated continuously since 1902
* Welshpool and Llanfair Light Railway, opened in 1903, closed in 1956, reconstructed and reopened between 1963 and 1981 on the entire route except Welshpool town section
* Mid-Suffolk Light Railway, opened in 1905, closed in 1952, very short section opened over 40 years later
* Derwent Valley Light Railway, opened in 1913, short section operating as heritage

=== Closed ===
== Railways operated under the act ==

* Heart of Wales Line, since 1972

A number of railways have, over the years, been built on private land, with names that end in &quot;Light Railway&quot;. These have not needed parliamentary powers or a light railway order. The name has only reflected the light nature of the railway. Many miniature railways are named in this way.

==Railways authorised under the act, but not built==
*North Holderness Light Railway (1897)
*Wotton-under-Edge Light Railway (1899)
*Rosedale &amp; Lastingham Light Railway (1900)
*Headcorn and Maidstone Junction Light Railway (1906)
* Trentham, Newcastle-under-Lyme and Silverdale Light Railway (1914)
*Southern Heights Light Railway (1929)

<text>The Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS) is an international Catholic organisation with a mission to accompany, serve, and advocate on behalf of refugees and other forcibly displaced persons, that they may heal, learn, and determine their own future. Founded in November 1980 as a work of the Society of Jesus, JRS was officially registered on 19 March 2000 in Vatican City as a foundation. The impetus to found JRS came from the then superior general of the Jesuits, Pedro Arrupe, who was inspired to action by the plight of Vietnamese boat people. JRS has programmes in over 55 countries. The areas of work are in the field of education, emergency assistance, health care, livelihoods, reconciliation, and psychosocial support. JRS is also involved in advocacy and human rights work. This involves ensuring that refugees are afforded their full rights as guaranteed by the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and working to strengthen the protection afforded to Internally displaced persons (IDPs).
JRS&#x27;s international headquarters is located in Rome at the Society&#x27;s General Curia. The International Director is Br Michael Schöpf SJ.

==History==
JRS was founded in November 1980 by Fr. Pedro Arrupe SJ, the then superior general of the Society of Jesus, to respond to the plight of Vietnamese boat people fleeing their war-ravaged homeland.

Following the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, hundreds of thousands of South Vietnamese fled their homes, setting out in overcrowded boats across the South China Sea. Many did not survive the journey; they were killed by pirates, or drowned because of storms and rough seas. Fr Arrupe felt compelled to act. He called on the Jesuits &quot;to bring at least some relief to such a tragic situation.&quot;

Fr Arrupe wrote to over 50 Jesuit provinces regarding the situation, recognising that the Jesuits, then numbering 27,000 men across the world, were well-placed to coordinate a global humanitarian response. 

As conflicts broke out in Central and Latin America, southeastern Europe, and across Africa, JRS rapidly grew from helping Vietnamese boat people in a few camps in Southeast Asia to working with refugees around the world.

Nearly 20 years after its founding, JRS was officially registered as a foundation of the Vatican City State on 19 March 2000.

Today, JRS works in over 55 countries serving more than 1.5 million people. 

===Mission===
JRS&#x27;s mission is to accompany, serve, and advocate on behalf of refugees and other forcibly displaced persons, that they may heal, learn, and determine their own future.

As an international humanitarian NGO, JRS strives to implement the magis ideal of Ignatius of Loyola, founder of the Jesuits. One of the key messages of the 35th Jesuit General Congregation (2008) was to reach new physical, cultural, religious and social frontiers, to those who are estranged, a task confirmed by two Popes. The search for new frontiers has taken JRS to places where refugees face deprivation and abuse of their basic rights: traditional refugee camps, detention centres and prisons, conflict zones, border areas, and in the heart of big cities, including Iraq and Syria.

On 24 May 2019, Jesuit Superior General Arturo Sosa called all Jesuits to &quot;renewed commitment&quot; to JRS in accord with the Jesuits&#x27; newly promulgated apostolic preferences, endorsed by Pope Francis. For its part JRS is restructuring to produce &quot;strong country offices that will strengthen local capacity and encourage subsidiarity.&quot; JRS defined its priorities for 2019-2023 as, &quot;the promotion of reconciliation and social cohesion; the delivery of quality formal and informal education; innovative livelihood programmes that lead to self-reliance and sustainability; and effective advocacy for the rights of refugees.&quot;

JRS is a signatory to the Immunization Agenda 2030 pledge, seeking to increase the worldwide uptake of vaccines in support of the Sustainable Development Goals.

==Refugees==
In deciding with whom to work, JRS finds the scope of existing international conventions is too restrictive. It therefore applies the expression &#x27;de facto refugee&#x27; to all &quot;persons persecuted because of race, religion, membership of social or political groups&quot;; to &quot;the victims of armed conflicts, erroneous economic policy or natural disasters&quot;; and, for &quot;humanitarian reasons&quot;, to internally displaced persons, that is, civilians who &quot;are forcibly uprooted from their homes by the same type of violence as refugees but who do not cross national frontiers.&quot;

Since the above definition refers only to individuals in fear of persecution, regional organisations in both Africa (African Union 1969) and Latin America (Organisation for American States 1984) have developed wider definitions which include mass displacements which occur as a result of social and economic collapse in the context of conflict. JRS strives by &quot;accompaniment&quot; to respect the human dignity of all refugees throughout their ordeal.

==UNHCR==
On the website of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, detailed recent reports are given of JRS work under the following categories: Country Reports, Fact Finding Reports, Handbooks/Manuals, Legal Articles/Analyses/Commentaries, Policy/Position Papers, Regional Reports, and Thematic Reports.

<doc id="1152280" wikidata="Q1121429" url="?curid=1152280" title="Uasin Gishu County">
<text>Uasin Gishu County is one of the 47 counties of Kenya located in the former Rift Valley Province. Eldoret city has the county&#x27;s largest population centre as well as its administrative and commercial centre..It is bordered by Elgeyo-Marakwet to the East, Trans Nzoia to the North, Kakamega to the west, Nandi and Kericho to the South West and Baringo to the South East. It is a highland plateau with altitudes falling gently from above sea level to about above sea level. The topography is higher to the east and declines gently towards the western border&quot;.

Uasin Gishu is located on a plateau and has a cool and temperate climate. The county borders Trans-Nzoia County to the north, Elgeyo-Marakwet and Baringo counties to the east, Kericho County to the south, Nandi County to the south and south-west and Kakamega County to the west.

The county is named after Illwuasin-kishu, a maasai clan. The land was the grazing area of the clan. They surrendered the land to the colonial government in the Anglo-Maasai agreement of 1911 and were subsequently pushed towards Trans Mara District. The plateau that they once occupied was then registered in its Anglicised version, Uasin Gishu.

==History==
In 1903, the area was proposed as a potential Jewish homeland; British Uganda Programme, which was rejected by the Jewish community leaders in the Seventh Zionist Congress (1905).

In 1908, fifty-eight families of Afrikaans-speaking South Africans settled in the Uasin Gishu plateau. They were followed by sixty more families in 1911 and more later. The town of Eldoret was established in the midst of the farms they created.

<text>:&quot;There is another Kouchibouguac River that empties into the Northumberland Strait at Beaubassin East in New Brunswick.&quot;

The Kouchibouguac River is a river in eastern New Brunswick, Canada, which empties into the Northumberland Strait. It is 72 kilometres (44.7 mi) long. It is not to be confused with the Kouchibouguacis River running parallel to this river, about to the south.

This river flows through Kouchibouguac National Park. The river&#x27;s name means &quot;river of the long tides&quot; in Mi&#x27;kmaq.

During the 19th century, the white pine forests of the area were logged to provide masts and booms for the ships of the Royal Navy. Ships were built at the mouth of this river to transport the logs to Britain.

<text>Tahar Ben Jelloun (; born 1 December 1944) is a Moroccan writer who rose to fame for his 1985 novel &quot;L&#x27;Enfant de sable&quot; (&quot;The Sand Child&quot;). All of his work is written in French although his first language is Darija. He has been nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature.

==Early life and career==
Tahar Ben Jelloun was born in Morocco in December 1944. As a child, he attended an Arabic-French bilingual elementary school. He then studied in the Lycée Regnault in Tangier, Morocco, until he was 18 years old. He studied philosophy at Mohammed V University in Rabat.

After he was a professor of philosophy in Morocco, he joined the group that ran the literary magazine &quot;Souffles&quot; in the mid-1960s, and he wrote many pieces for the cultural magazine. He later participated in the student rebellion against the repressive and violent acts of the Moroccan police. In 1966, he was forced into military service as his punishment.

Five years later, his first poems were published in &quot;Hommes sous linceul de silence&quot; (1971). Shortly thereafter he moved to Paris to study psychology, and in 1972 began writing for &quot;Le Monde&quot;. He received his doctorate in social psychiatry in 1975.

In January 2003, Ben Jelloun was nominated one of the two candidates for the 16th seat of the Académie Française, the moderating body of the French language. This seat was last held by Léopold Sédar Senghor. A month later, Ben Jelloun ended his campaign for the position.

Today, Ben Jelloun is known for his literary career but also his appearances on French media outlets in which he speaks about the experiences of people of North African descent living in France. He lives in Paris and continues to write.

==Writing career==
Ben Jelloun&#x27;s 1985 novel &quot;L’Enfant de Sable&quot; (translated as &quot;The Sand Child&quot;) brought widespread attention. In 1987, he received the Prix Goncourt for his novel &quot;La Nuit Sacrée&quot; (&quot;The Sacred Night&quot;), which made him the first Maghreb author to receive the award.

His 1996 novel &quot;Les raisins de la galère&quot; (&quot;The Fruits of Hard Work&quot;) is a reflection on racism and traditional Muslim ideas about a woman&#x27;s place. The protagonist, Nadia (a young French woman of Algerian origin), fights racism and exclusion to find her place in French society.

In 1993, he received the journalistic award &quot;Golden Doves for Peace&quot;, issued by the Italian Research Center Archivio Disarmo. Ben Jelloun was awarded the International Dublin Literary Award for &quot;Cette aveuglante absence de lumière&quot; (&quot;This Blinding Absence of Light&quot;) in 2004. In 2005 he received the Prix Ulysse for the entire body of his work.

Ben Jelloun has written several pedagogical works. His first is &quot;Le Racisme expliqué à ma fille&quot;, translated as &quot;Racism Explained to My Daughter&quot; (1998). The text is an educative tool for children and is the main reason for him being regularly invited to speak at schools and universities. His text is addressed to his own daughter, but he is actually writing to all French children who are troubled by complex but important topics that surround racism. He argues that the primary solution to solve racism in France is through education, specifically education starting at a young age. He also makes the connection between colonialism and racism in a way that is understandable to his young audience by explaining that colonialism is a type of domination and power that aids racism to exist at the state level.

He also has written &quot;L&#x27;Islam expliqué aux enfants&quot;, translated as &quot;Islam Explained&quot; (2002), and &quot;Le Terrorisme expliqué à nos enfants&quot;, translated as &quot;On Terrorism&quot; (2016) in response to the 1990s protests against French immigration laws, the Islamophobia following the September 11 attacks in the United States, and the November 2015 Paris attacks, respectively.

In September 2006, Ben Jelloun was awarded a special prize for &quot;peace and friendship between people&quot; at the Lazio between Europe and the Mediterranean Festival. On 1 February 2008, Nicolas Sarkozy awarded him the Cross of Grand Officer of the Légion d&#x27;honneur.

In Africa, his novel &quot;Le mariage de plaisir&quot; was shortlisted for the GPLA 2016 (Belles-Lettres Category).

<text>Colonel Holman Fred Stephens (31 October 1868 – 23 October 1931) was a British light railway civil engineer and manager. He was engaged in engineering and building, and later managing, 16 light railways in England and Wales.

== Biography ==
Stephens was the son of Frederic George Stephens, Pre-Raphaelite artist and art critic, and his wife the artist Rebecca Clara (née Dalton). He was named after his father&#x27;s friend and former tutor, the painter Holman Hunt, although the two later fell out. He was a great nephew of the naturalist, explorer and biologist, Charles Darwin.

Stephens was apprenticed in the workshops of the Metropolitan Railway in 1881. He was an assistant engineer during the building of the Cranbrook and Paddock Wood Railway, which opened in 1892. In 1894 he became an associate member of the Institution of Civil Engineers, which allowed him to design and build railways in his own right.

He immediately set about his lifetime&#x27;s project of operating light railways for rural areas, mostly planned and built under the Light Railways Act 1896 (59 &amp; 60 Vict. c. 48). His first two railways, the Rye and Camber Tramway and the Hundred of Manhood and Selsey Tramway, predated this, but he built the first railway under the act, the Rother Valley Railway (later the Kent and East Sussex Railway).

The railways were planned, and some later run, from an office at 23 Salford Terrace in Tonbridge, Kent, which Stephens had rented in 1900 and purchased in 1927.

Many of his railways stayed independent of the larger systems created in the Grouping under the Railways Act 1921.

Stephens had no close relatives and never married. He had few interests outside of railways other than voluntary military service and Liberal Party politics, having befriended MP for Caernarfon David Lloyd George during Stephens&#x27; period as Manager of the Welsh Highland Railway and Ffestiniog Railway between 1925 and 1931. In 1916, during World War I, Stephens attained the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel in the Territorial Army (TA) with which he had been associated since the 1890s. He continued to support the TA throughout most of the 1920s.

When he died in 1931 aged 62, the management of his railways was taken over by his former &quot;outdoor assistant&quot; and life partner, W. H. Austen, who ran them until they closed or were incorporated into the national system in 1948.

A museum devoted to his life and achievements is at Tenterden Station in Kent.

== The railways ==
There are several books about Col. Stephens&#x27;s railways. The railways in which Stephens was involved were: 
== Other projects ==
Stephens was involved in many projects that did not come to fruition, 18 of which reached the early, Light Railway Order, stage. Many were extensions to existing railways; one was the 1920s &#x27;Southern Heights Light Railway&#x27;, a single-track electrified railway from Orpington to Sanderstead.

He was involved in:
*Central Essex Railway
*East Kent Light Railway Extensions
*East Sussex Railway
*Gower Railway
*Hadlow Railway
*Headcorn and Faversham Junction Railway
*Headcorn and Maidstone Junction Railway
*Hedingham and Long Melford Railway
*Kelvedon, Coggeshall and Halstead Railway
*Lands End, St Just and Great Western Junction Railway
*Long Melford and Hadleigh Railway
*Maidstone and Faversham Junction Railway
*Maidstone and Sittingbourne Railway
*Newport and Four Ashes Railway
*Orpington, Cudham and Tatsfield Railway
*Shropshire Railways (Shrewsbury and Market Drayton Extension)
*Southern Heights Light Railway
*Surrey and Sussex Railway
*Worcester and Broom Railway

==Locomotives==
The majority of the locomotives were second-hand, but a few were bought new from Hawthorn Leslie and Company including:

None of these has been preserved.

<text>&quot;Warszawianka 1831 roku&quot;, &quot;La Varsovienne&quot; (&quot;The Varsovian of 1831&quot;) is a Polish patriotic song written by Casimir François Delavigne with music by Karol Kurpiński.

==History==

The song was written in support of the November Uprising of 1830–1831. The French poet Casimir Delavigne was fascinated and inspired by the news of the uprising making its way to Paris and wrote the words, which were translated into Polish by the historian, journalist, and poet (great-uncle of novelist Henryk Sienkiewicz). 

It contains several stylistic allusions to &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; in the lyrics e.g. &quot;Aux armes, citoyens&quot; (in &quot;La Varsovienne&quot;: &quot;Polonais, à la baïonnette&quot;). The song was performed for the first time on 5 April 1831 at the National Theatre in Warsaw and immediately started to enjoy great popularity.

The song is sometimes confused with a later Polish revolutionary song of the same name (often referred to in Polish as &quot;Warszawianka 1905 roku&quot; or ‘the Varsovienne of 1905’, sometimes known in English as &quot;Whirlwinds of Danger&quot;), which had its music used for the 1936 Spanish anarchist song &quot;To the Barricades&quot;. It is today the official march past of the Polish Armed Forces. In 1918, after the regaining of independence by Poland, it was considered among the candidates for the country&#x27;s national anthem.

==Lyrics==

&lt;poem lang=&quot;fr&quot; style=&quot;float:left;&quot;&gt;French
Il s&#x27;est levé, voici le jour sanglant;
Qu&#x27;il soit pour nous le jour de délivrance!
Dans son essor, voyez notre aigle blanc
Les yeux fixés sur l&#x27;arc-en-ciel de France
Au soleil de juillet, dont l&#x27;éclat fut si beau,
Il a repris son vol, il fend les airs, il crie:
&quot;Pour ma noble patrie,
Liberté, ton soleil ou la nuit du tombeau!&quot;

&quot;Refrain:&quot;
Polonais, à la baïonnette!
C&#x27;est le cri par nous adopté;
Qu&#x27;en roulant le tambour répète:
À la baïonnette!
Vive la liberté!

Guerre! À cheval, cosaques des déserts!
Sabrons, dit-il, la Pologne rebelle:
Point de Balkans, ses champs nous sont ouverts;
C&#x27;est le galop qu&#x27;il faut passer sur elle.
Halte! n&#x27;avancez pas! Ses Balkans sont nos corps;
La terre où nous marchons ne porte que des braves,
rejette les esclaves
Et de ses ennemis ne garde que les morts

&quot;Refrain&quot;

Pour toi, Pologne, ils combattront, tes fils,
Plus fortunés qu&#x27;au temps où la victoire
Mêlait leurs cendres aux sables de Memphis
Où le Kremlin s&#x27;écroula sous leur gloire:
Des Alpes au Thabor, de l&#x27;Ebre au Pont-Euxin,
Ils sont tombés, vingt ans, sur la rive étrangère.
Cette fois, ô ma mère!
Ceux qui mourront pour toi, dormiront sur ton sein.

&quot;Refrain&quot;

Viens Kosciusko, que ton bras frappe au cœur
Cet ennemi qui parle de clémence;
En avait-il quand son sabre vainqueur
Noyait Praga dans un massacre immense?
Tout son sang va payer le sang qu&#x27;il prodigua,
cette terre en a soif, qu&#x27;elle en soit arrosée;
Faisons, sous sa rosée,
Reverdir le laurier des martyrs de Praga.

&quot;Refrain&quot;

Allons, guerriers, un généreux effort!
Nous les vaincrons; nos femmes les défient.
O mon pays, montre au géant du nord
Le saint anneau qu&#x27;elles te sacrifient.
Que par notre victoire il soit ensanglanté;
Marche, et fais triompher au milieu des batailles
L&#x27;anneau des fiançailles,
Qui t&#x27;unit pour toujours avec la liberté.

&quot;Refrain&quot;

À nous, Français! Les balles d&#x27;Iéna
Sur ma poitrine ont inscrit mes services;
À Marengo, le fer la sillonna;
De Champ-Aubert comptez les cicatrices.
Vaincre et mourir ensemble autrefois fut si doux!
Nous étions sous Paris... Pour de vieux frères d&#x27;armes
N&#x27;aurez-vous que des larmes?
Frères, c&#x27;était du sang que nous versions pour vous!

&quot;Refrain&quot;

O vous, du moins, dont le sang glorieux
S&#x27;est, dans l&#x27;exil, répandu comme l&#x27;onde,
Pour nous bénir, mânes victorieux,
Relevez-vous de tous les points du monde!
Qu&#x27;il soit vainqueur, ce peuple; ou martyr comme vous,
Sous le bras du géant, qu&#x27;en mourant il retarde,
Qu&#x27;il tombe à l&#x27;avant-garde,
Pour couvrir de son corps la liberté de tous.

&quot;Refrain&quot;

Sonnez, clairons! Polonais, à ton rang!
Suis sous le feu ton aigle qui s&#x27;élance.
La liberté bat la charge en courant,
Et la victoire est au bout de ta lance.
Victoire à l&#x27;étendard que l&#x27;exil ombragea
Des lauriers d&#x27;Austerlitz, des palmes d&#x27;Idumée!
Pologne bien-aimée,
Qui vivra sera libre, et qui meurt l&#x27;est déjà!

&quot;Refrain&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem lang=&quot;pl&quot; style=&quot;margin-left:1em; float:left;&quot;&gt;Polish
Oto dziś dzień krwi i chwały,
Oby dniem wskrzeszenia był!
W tęczę Franków Orzeł Biały
Patrząc, lot swój w niebo wzbił.
Słońcem lipca podniecany
Woła do nas z górnych stron:
&quot;Powstań, Polsko, skrusz kajdany,
Dzis twój tryumf albo zgon!&quot;

&quot;Refren:&quot;
Hej, kto Polak, na bagnety!
Żyj, swobodo, Polsko, żyj!
Takim hasłem cnej podniety
Trąbo nasza wrogom grzmij!
Trąbo nasza wrogom grzmij!

Na koń, woła Kozak mściwy,
Karać bunty polskich rot,
Bez Bałkanów są ich niwy,
Wszystko jeden zgniecie lot.
Stój! Za Bałkan pierś ta stanie,
Car wasz marzy płonny łup,
Z wrogów naszych nie zostanie,
Na tej ziemi, chyba trup.

&quot;Refren&quot;

Droga Polska, dzieci Twoje,
Dziś szczęśliwszych doszły chwil,
Od tych sławnych, gdy ich boje,
Wieńczył Kremlin, Tybr i Nil.
Lat dwadzieścia nasze męże,
Los po obcych ziemiach siał,
Dziś, o Matko, kto polęże,
Na Twem łonie będzie spał.

&quot;Refren&quot;

Wstań Kościuszko! Ugodź serca,
Co z litością mamić śmią,
Znałże litość ów morderca,
Który Pragę zalał krwią?
Niechaj krew tę krwią dziś spłaci,
Niech nią zrosi grunt, zły gość,
Laur męczeński naszej braci
Bujniej będzie po niej rość.

&quot;Refren&quot;

Tocz Polaku bój zacięty,
Ulec musi dumny car,
Pokaż jemu pierścień święty,
Nieulękłych Polek dar,
Niech to godło ślubów drogich,
Wrogom naszym wróży grób,
Niech krwią zlane w bojach srogich,
Nasz z wolnością świadczy ślub.

&quot;Refren&quot;

O Francuzi! Czyż bez ceny
Rany nasze dla was są?
Spod Marengo, Wagram, Jeny,
Drezna, Lipska, Waterloo
Świat was zdradzał, my dotrwali,
Śmierć czy tryumf, my gdzie wy!
Bracia, my wam krew dawali.
Dziś wy dla nas nic – prócz łzy.

&quot;Refren&quot;

Wy przynajmniej coście legli,
W obcych krajach za kraj swój,
Bracia nasi z grobów zbiegli,
Błogosławcie bratni bój.
Lub zwyciężym – lub gotowi,
Z trupów naszych tamę wznieść,
By krok spóźnić olbrzymowi,
Co chce światu pęta nieść.

&quot;Refren&quot;

Grzmijcie bębny, ryczcie działa,
Dalej! dzieci w gęsty szyk,
Wiedzie hufce wolność, chwała,
Tryumf błyska w ostrzu pik.
Leć nasz orle, w górnym pędzie,
Sławie, Polsce, światu służ!
Kto przeżyje wolnym będzie,
Kto umiera, wolny już!

&quot;Refren&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:1em; float:left;&quot;&gt;English translation of the Polish version
Today is a day of blood and glory,
Let it be a day of resurrection!
Gazing at France&#x27;s rainbow,
The White Eagle launches into flight.
Inspired by the sun of July,
He calls to us from above:
&quot;Arise, oh Poland, break your chains,
Today is a day of your victory or death!&quot;

&quot;Refrain:&quot; 
Hey, whoever is a Pole, to your bayonets!
Live, freedom, oh Poland, live!
Let this worthy battle cry
Sound forth to our foes!
Sound forth to our foes!
&quot;To horse!&quot; - a vindictive Cossack calls,
Punish the Polish mutinied companies,
Their fields have no Balkans,
In a trice we shall crush poles a sort».
Stand! This breast will stand for the Balkans:
Your tsar vainly dreams of loot,
From our enemies nothing remains
On this ground, except for corpses.
&quot;Refrain&quot;
Dear Poland! Today your children
Have reached happier moments,
Than those when their famous battles
Were crowned by the Kremlin, Tiber and Nile.
For twenty years our heroes
have been scattered by fate over foreign lands,
Now, oh Mother, he who is killed,
Shall sleep on your bosom.
&quot;Refrain&quot;
Rise, Kościuszko, strike in hearts,
Which dare to deceive with mercy.
Did that murderer know about mercy,
Which bathed Praga in blood?
Let he now repay for that blood in blood,
Let he, a malicious visitor, sprinkle it over the ground.
Martyr laurels of our brethren
Will grow more magnificent on it.
&quot;Refrain&quot;
Fight, oh Pole, a pitched battle,
The proud tsar must lose,
Show him a sacred ring,
A gift of fearless Polish women;
Let this sign of dear vows
Prophesy grave to our enemies,
Let it, bathed in blood in severe fights,
Witness our union with freedom.
&quot;Refrain&quot;
Oh Frenchmen! Are our wounds
Of no value for you?
At Marengo, Wagram, Jena,
Dresden, Leipzig, and Waterloo
The world betrayed you, but we stood firm.
In death or victory, we stand by you!
Oh brothers, we gave blood for you.
Today you give us nothing but tears.
&quot;Refrain&quot;
You, at least, who have fallen
In foreign lands for your land,
Our brothers, risen from tombs,
Bless your brothers&#x27; fight!
Either we win – or we are ready
To build a barrier of our corpses,
To slow down the giant,
Who wishes to bring chains to the world.
&quot;Refrain&quot;
Rattle, drums, roar, guns,
On! Children, form a deep line;
Freedom and Glory lead the regiments
Triumph shines on spearheads.
Fly, our eagle, in high flight,
Serve the glory, Poland, and the world!
He who survives will be free,
He who dies is already free!

&quot;Refrain&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

<doc id="1152311" wikidata="Q7512811" url="?curid=1152311" title="Signature (topology)">
<text>In the field of topology, the signature is an integer invariant which is defined for an oriented manifold &quot;M&quot; of dimension divisible by four.

This invariant of a manifold has been studied in detail, starting with Rokhlin&#x27;s theorem for 4-manifolds, and Hirzebruch signature theorem.

== Definition ==
Given a connected and oriented manifold &quot;M&quot; of dimension 4&quot;k&quot;, the cup product gives rise to a quadratic form &quot;Q&quot; on the &#x27;middle&#x27; real cohomology group

:formula_1.

The basic identity for the cup product

:formula_2

shows that with &quot;p&quot; = &quot;q&quot; = 2&quot;k&quot; the product is symmetric. It takes values in

:formula_3.

If we assume also that &quot;M&quot; is compact, Poincaré duality identifies this with

:formula_4

which can be identified with formula_5. Therefore the cup product, under these hypotheses, does give rise to a symmetric bilinear form on &quot;H&quot;2&quot;k&quot;(&quot;M&quot;,&quot;R&quot;); and therefore to a quadratic form &quot;Q&quot;. The form &quot;Q&quot; is non-degenerate due to Poincaré duality, as it pairs non-degenerately with itself. More generally, the signature can be defined in this way for any general compact polyhedron with &quot;4n&quot;-dimensional Poincaré duality.

The signature formula_6 of &quot;M&quot; is by definition the signature of &quot;Q&quot;, that is, formula_7 where any diagonal matrix defining &quot;Q&quot; has formula_8 positive entries and formula_9 negative entries. If &quot;M&quot; is not connected, its signature is defined to be the sum of the signatures of its connected components.

== Other dimensions ==

If &quot;M&quot; has dimension not divisible by 4, its signature is usually defined to be 0. There are alternative generalization in L-theory: the signature can be interpreted as the 4&quot;k&quot;-dimensional (simply connected) symmetric L-group formula_10 or as the 4&quot;k&quot;-dimensional quadratic L-group formula_11 and these invariants do not always vanish for other dimensions. The Kervaire invariant is a mod 2 (i.e., an element of formula_12) for framed manifolds of dimension 4&quot;k&quot;+2 (the quadratic L-group formula_13), while the de Rham invariant is a mod 2 invariant of manifolds of dimension 4&quot;k&quot;+1 (the symmetric L-group formula_14); the other dimensional L-groups vanish.

=== Kervaire invariant ===

When formula_15 is twice an odd integer (singly even), the same construction gives rise to an antisymmetric bilinear form. Such forms do not have a signature invariant; if they are non-degenerate, any two such forms are equivalent. However, if one takes a quadratic refinement of the form, which occurs if one has a framed manifold, then the resulting ε-quadratic forms need not be equivalent, being distinguished by the Arf invariant. The resulting invariant of a manifold is called the Kervaire invariant.

== Properties ==

*Compact oriented manifolds &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; satisfy formula_16 by definition, and satisfy formula_17 by a Künneth formula.

*If &quot;M&quot; is an oriented boundary, then formula_18.

*René Thom (1954) showed that the signature of a manifold is a cobordism invariant, and in particular is given by some linear combination of its Pontryagin numbers. For example, in four dimensions, it is given by formula_19. Friedrich Hirzebruch (1954) found an explicit expression for this linear combination as the L genus of the manifold. 

*William Browder (1962) proved that a simply connected compact polyhedron with 4&quot;n&quot;-dimensional Poincaré duality is homotopy equivalent to a manifold if and only if its signature satisfies the expression of the Hirzebruch signature theorem.

*Rokhlin&#x27;s theorem says that the signature of a 4-dimensional simply connected manifold with a spin structure is divisible by 16.

<doc id="1152323" wikidata="Q3181226" url="?curid=1152323" title="Baltic Finnic paganism">
<text>Baltic Finnic paganism, or Baltic Finnic polytheism was the indigenous religion of the various of the Baltic Finnic peoples, specifically the Finns, Estonians, Võros, Setos, Karelians, Veps, Izhorians, Votes and Livonians, prior to Christianisation. It was a polytheistic religion, worshipping a number of different deities. The chief deity was the god of thunder and the sky, Ukko; other important deities included Jumala, Ahti, and Tapio. Jumala was a sky god; today, the word &quot;Jumala&quot; refers to a monotheistic God. Ahti was a god of the sea, waters and fish. Tapio was the god of the forest and hunting.

Baltic Finnic paganism included necrolatry (worship of the dead) and shamanism (tietäjä(t), literally &quot;one who knows&quot;), and the religion was not always uniform across the areas it was practiced, as customs and beliefs varied during different periods of time and regions. Baltic Finnic paganism shares some features with its neighbouring Baltic, Norse and Germanic pagan beliefs.

The organic tradition was sidelined due to Christianisation starting from ca. 12th century and finally broken by the early 20th century, when folk Magic and oral traditions went extinct. Baltic Finnic paganism provided the inspiration for a contemporary pagan movement Suomenusko (), which is an attempt to reconstruct the old religion of the Finns. It is nevertheless based on secondary sources.

== Deities ==
Baltic Finnic pagans were polytheistic, believing in a number of different deities. Most of the deities ruled over a specific aspect of nature; for instance, Ukko was the god of the sky and thunder (&quot;ukkonen&quot; and &quot;ukonilma&quot; [&quot;Ukko&#x27;s air&quot;] are still used in modern Finnish as terms for thunderstorms). These deities were often pan-Finnic, being worshipped by many different tribes in different regions. The Baltic Finnic pagans were also animists, worshipping local nature deities at site-specific shrines to that particular deity. These shrines are thought to be mainly &quot;tree-gods&quot;: wooden statues or carvings done in trees or treestumps, depicting human figures, and have been scarcely preserved. One confirmed Stone Age wooden statue has been found in Pohjankuru, and folklore about worshipping tree-gods has been documented. Another kind of shrine are &quot;cup-stones&quot; (Finnish: &quot;:fi:kuppikivi&quot;), large natural stones into which cup-sized recesses have been drilled. Votive offerings of food or drink were left in these cups. Despite Christianization, offerings on these cup-stones continued up to the early 20th century.

=== Major deities ===
Several key deities were venerated by all the Baltic Finnic peoples and some other Finnic peoples, these pan-Finnic deities controlled many aspects of nature.
* The chief deity was Ukko (also [thought to be] known as Perkele), who was the ruler over the sky and thunder. A corresponding figure is known in countless other cultures of the world.
* Another deity that appeared very significant to the Baltic Finnic pagans, but about whom modern scholars know very little, was Jumi, whose name is related to &quot;Jumala&quot;, the modern Finnish language word for a monotheist God.
* There were many other important deities who ruled over a specific aspect of the natural world. Such as the deity of water was often called Ahti, and the deity of the forest was Tapio.
* Other major deities included Äkräs, the god of fertility; Mielikki, the goddess of the forests and the hunt; Kuu, the goddess of the moon; and Lempo, the god of wilderness and archery.
* Deities, who turned into Great heroes, who had, in mythology, once been human, such as Väinämöinen and Ilmarinen, were also objects of worship, in a way similar to the Greek pagans&#x27; worship of mythical human heroes like Herakles. Ilmarinen was previously a sky god, being replaced by Ukko.

==== Ukko ====
Ukko is the chief deity in Baltic Finnic paganism, he is the god of the sky, weather (mostly thunder, rain and clouds), a god of harvest and fertility. He is also given the epithet &quot;Ylijumala&quot; (&#x27;Supreme God&#x27; or &#x27;Highest God&#x27;) in at least the Finnish, Karelian and Ingrian regional variants of the pagan faith. He was associated with the sowing season during springtime according to Mikael Agricola. Ukko also had characteristics of a war god, and would be prayed to help in battle.

Ukko was sometimes given the epithet &quot;Isäinen ylinen Luoja&quot; (&#x27;Fatherly Supreme Creator&#x27;), and Salo notes that this could also be related to the sky-god &quot;*Dyēus&quot; of Proto-Indo-European religion.

Ukko is perhaps to a significant extent derived from the various Baltic peoples. The Latvian (&quot;Pērkons)&quot; and Lithuanian (&quot;Perkūnas)&quot;, which are the same thunder deity, are known to be the origins for the Finnish word &quot;Perkele&quot; (which is also [thought to be] another cognomen for Ukko). Ukko is thought to have entered Baltic Finnic paganism in the first millennium BC, replacing other chief deities who were more unique per region, such as Taara in Estonia. Before the influences of the Balts, the various Finnic people [most likely] had an earlier, original sky-god. Ilmarinen, who is known as the blacksmith in the Kalevala, is the earliest known to be sky-god of the various Uralic peoples. The Udmurt sky god corresponds to the Finnish Ilmarinen. Memories of Ilmarinen&#x27;s status as the sky deity have been preserved in Kalevala myths, such as the belief that he forged the firmament and the Sampo.

==== Tapio ====
Tapio is a major deity in Baltic Finnic paganism (in its most recent form), he is the king and god of the forest and hunting. Tapio was prayed to for luck in hunting, because of his control over game. Tapio would often be sacrificed to, by sacrificing of animals, such as birds. Tapionpöytä ((Picea abies), literally &#x27;Tapio&#x27;s table&#x27;) are spruce trees where sacrifices were made to Tapio. Tapio was extremely significant due to the tribal nature of the Baltic Finnic peoples during the time when Tapio was worshipped, as hunting and game was extremely important for survival, making Tapio one of the most important deities.

Tapio possessed over various spirits and was himself also a spirit, possessing (&#x27;Tapio&#x27;s spirits/elves&#x27;), the spirit beings were central to the hunter&#x27;s catch, and Tapio&#x27;s spirits were thought to live in the deepest ravines of the forest and took care of plants and animals, in the darkness of the deep forest, which was called . Tapiola was a kingdom which Tapio ruled over, and was sometimes used as the name for Finland by the Baltic Finnic pagan believers during the Early Middle Ages.

==== Ilmarinen ====
Ilmarinen is a major deity and former chief deity, in the form of a sky deity in Baltic Finnic paganism, alongside the Proto-Uralic religion until his replacement as the chief deity. Ilmarinen may have [possibly] also been a thunder deity under the name &quot;Ilmaričče.&quot; Other names for Ilmarinen are &quot;Ilmorinen&quot; and &quot;Ilmollini&quot;, as found from runes. Ilmarinen is also described in the pagan faith as the forger of the firmament, aurora borealis and the colors of the morning and evening. Ilmarinen was said to have the achievements of inventing iron and &quot;&quot; according to folklore.

He is also described as a blacksmith and is thought to have gained his smith status through Proto-Finnic contact with iron-working cultures such as the Balts or Germanic people.

==== Agricola&#x27;s list of deities ====
In 1551, Mikael Agricola published a present across Tavastia and Karelia, most of the deities were also widespread and known to those who practiced the pagan faith outside of those regions.
=== Haltija ===

Local animistic deities, known as haltijas or haltias, were also worshipped. Haltijas would act as spirits, gnome, or elf-like creatures in that guard, help, own, or protects somethin or somebody.

These haltijas could be male or female, and could take a human or another animal&#x27;s form. Haltijas could be found everywhere in nature, both in the biotic and abiotic parts. Every human has a haltija, usually called haltijasielu (haltija soul) or luontohaltija (nature haltija), which is one of the three parts of a person&#x27;s soul. The tradition blends with the Swedish tomte: the Finnish &quot;tonttu&quot; was a being analogous to haltija, but which lives in a building, like a home (&quot;kotitonttu&quot;) or a sauna (&quot;saunatonttu&quot;).

==== Maan haltija ====
Certain &quot;haltiat&quot;, known as &quot;maan haltija&quot; (literally &quot;tutelary of land&quot;), guarded the property of an individual, including their house and livestock. Votive offerings would be given to these haltijas at a shrine, as thanks for the help given and also to prevent the haltija from causing harm.

Sometimes haltijas of certain families and farms acted against other families and their farms by stealing their wealth or making the animals infertile, for instance. Many local haltijas were believed to have originally been the sacred spirits of ancestors. In some cases a haltija was the first inhabitant of a house. Sometimes while making a new house a local spirit of nature could be &quot;employed&quot; to work as a maan haltija.

==== Väki ====
Different elements and environments had their own haltijas. Haltijas were grouped into types or races called väki. &quot;Väki&quot; has multiple connected meanings of &quot;strength&quot;, &quot;force&quot;, &quot;throng&quot;, &quot;military troop&quot;; in the magical context, it referred ambiguously to magical strength and numbers. There were, for instance, different väki of water, forests, and graveyards.

Väkis could become angry if people acted in a disrespectful manner in their area. For example, cursing close to water made the väki of water angry. When angry, väkis could cause diseases and other misfortune to befall the human victim. Some väkis were always angry, like the väki of fire, explaining why every time you touch fire it burns, no matter how respectful you are around it.

Each tribe of väkis belonged to specific environments and if they were misplaced, problems occurred. For example, most väkis were misplaced if they attached to a human being, and they made the human being ill because they were in the wrong place. Illnesses were removed by sending väkis back to their right places. Shamans who cured diseases were returning the cosmic balance. For example, it was believed that on contact with the ground, as in falling on one&#x27;s face, diseases could spread to the human, caused by the &quot;väki&quot; of the earth. Similarly, löyly (sauna steam) was believed to contain a väki spirit (löylyn henki), which could cause open wounds to get infected.

According to the concept of väki being divided in two (into power and folk of haltijas) the ancient Finns believed that the world was totally animistic in that no force of nature or intelligent life existed without väkis or haltijas. In other words, nothing happened in the universe without it being caused by a group of spirits. Even a person&#x27;s soul consisted of many spirits.

== The Universe ==
=== Birth of the Universe ===
In Finnic mythology, there are two different theories on the creation of the universe and the earth. This includes the , in which the god sent a Black-throated loon into the Alkumeri (Finnish: ) to collect mud and sand to build the earth. This myth is common in various Siberian (Chukchi, Yugaghir and Ainu), Tatar and North American native folklore.

Another creation theory is that the world was born from the egg of a waterfowl. This myth which is thought to be of origin from the Indian Subcontinent, is possibly to have come from Uralic interaction with Indo-Iranians. This myth however was only well known among the Sámi, Finns, Komi and Mordvins.

=== End of the World ===
There is said to be no eschatology (the end of the world) in Finnic mythology. However based on similarities in other Uralic beliefs, it can be assumed that Finnic paganism included the idea that the world is in cyclicity and that it will be recurring at regular intervals.

== Soul, death, and the afterlife ==

=== Soul ===

The Finnic pagan belief about the soul dictated that the human soul is composed of three different parts: &quot;henki&quot;, &quot;luonto&quot; and &quot;itse&quot;. Each of the three were autonomous beings on their own. Similar beliefs about multiple autonomous souls are found amongst other peoples speaking Uralic languages, such as the Khanty and Mansi, who believe in two souls: the shadow and the &quot;lili&quot; (löyly).

&quot;Henki&quot; (translated as &quot;life&quot;, &quot;breath&quot; or &quot;spirit&quot;, sometimes also referred to as &quot;löyly&quot;) was a person&#x27;s life force, which presented itself as breathing, the beating of one&#x27;s heart and the warmth of their body. &quot;Henki&quot; was received prior to birth and it left at the moment of death. The word &quot;hengetön&quot; (lit. &quot;one without henki&quot;) can be used as a synonym for dead in the Finnish language even now. &quot;Henki&quot; share several similarities with the Norse idea of which carry almost identical basic meaning. 

&quot;Luonto&quot; (translated as &quot;nature&quot;) was a guardian spirit or protector. &quot;Luonto&quot; has also been referred to as the &quot;haltija&quot; of a person. A strong willed, artistic or otherwise talented person was believed to have a strong &quot;haltija&quot; who granted them good luck and skills to complete their tasks well. A weak &quot;luonto&quot; could be strengthened by various spells and rituals. &quot;Luonto&quot; could leave a person&#x27;s body without the person dying, but its lengthened absence would cause problems, such as alcoholism and other addictions. Unlike &quot;henki&quot;, &quot;luonto&quot; was not received prior to birth but instead either at the time of getting the first teeth or being given a name. A newborn child was thus considered to be particularly vulnerable. &quot;Luonto&quot; share several similarities with the overlapping ideas of &quot;Hamingja&quot; (luck), &quot;Fylgja&quot; (follower, companion guardian spirit), Vörðr (warden, a protection spirit) and individual norn (a person&#x27;s fate goddess) in Norse belief.

&quot;Itse&quot; was a spirit received at the time of birth or a few days after. It was believed to define one&#x27;s personality and receiving &quot;itse&quot; made one a person. In modern-day Finnish the word &quot;itse&quot; means &quot;self&quot;, but in old days &quot;itse&quot; was different from one&#x27;s self, &quot;minuus&quot;. Like &quot;luonto&quot;, &quot;itse&quot; could leave one&#x27;s body without the person dying but long absence would cause illnesses and misery. Depressions, for instance, was seen as a result of having lost one&#x27;s &quot;itse&quot;. If a person was diagnosed to be &quot;itsetön&quot; or &quot;luonnoton&quot; (without one&#x27;s &quot;itse&quot; or without one&#x27;s &quot;luonto&quot;), a shaman or a sage could try locating the missing part of the soul and bring it back. Although &quot;itse&quot; and &quot;luonto&quot; were usually lost after a traumatising event, it was possible to purposefully separate one&#x27;s &quot;itse&quot; from their body. This was required if a missing part of the soul needed to be found. &quot;Itse&quot; could also leave the body to appear as an &quot;etiäinen&quot; (a sort of false arrival apparition). At the time of a person&#x27;s death their &quot;itse&quot; joined the other deceased of the family or, in some cases, stayed among the living as a ghost. &quot;Itse&quot; share many similarities with the Norse concept of &quot;&quot; (mind, thought, willpower, courage), and to some extent also Vörðr (especially the false arrival apparition).

=== Burial ===
In some traditions, it was a habit to pause at a half-way point while transporting the dead body, from the dwelling to the graveyard. Here, a karsikko-marking was made on a big pine tree. The marking was for people to remember the person; and in the event that the spirit were to awaken and try to make its way back home from the graveyard, it would see its own karsikko-marking, then realize that it is dead and instead try to find the path to the spirit realm. A forest with karsikko-marked trees was a kind of supernatural barrier between dwellings of the living and the burial grounds.

After a person died there was a transitional period of thirty to forty days while their soul searched Tuonela, the land of dead, and tried to find their place there. During this period, the soul could visit its living relatives either as a ghost or in the form of an animal.

The soul visited relatives especially if it was unhappy. To please an unhappy soul, one would show respect by not speaking ill of the deceased or by having a sacrifice in 
the spirit&#x27;s name.

After this transitional period, the soul moved permanently into Tuonela. However, the soul could still come back if it were unhappy, or if it were asked to return by its relatives who needed help.

Some souls were not able to settle down or were not welcomed in Tuonela, and they continued haunting, i.e. bastard children who were killed and buried outside a cemetery usually ended up as permanent haunters of some place, typically screaming in terror, until someone digs up their bodies, blesses them, and buries them in a graveyard.

=== Ancestor veneration ===
People were afraid of ghosts, but spirits of ancestors could also help their living relatives, and they were asked to help. A shaman could be sent to Tuonela to ask for knowledge of spirits or even to take a spirit to the world of living as luonto. A Spirit of the dead had to be honoured by giving him/her sacrifices. Places where sacrifices were given to ancestors were called Hiisi ( = &quot;sacred forest&quot;, also a kind of open air temple, often included the Offering-stone, &quot;uhrikivi&quot;, collective monument for the dead of the family). Christianity held hiisi to be evil creatures and places. The old sacred places were often desecrated by being used as the building sites for the churches of the new religion, and the old sacred trees were hacked down.

=== Afterlife ===

The Finns believed in a place of afterlife called Tuonela, or sometimes also called Manala. In most traditions, it was situated underground or at the bottom of a lake, though sometimes it was said to exist on the other side of a dark river. Tuonela was ruled over by the god Tuoni, and his wife, the goddess Tuonetar.

Tuonela was a dark and lifeless place, where the dead were in a state of eternal sleep. Shamans were sometimes able to reach the spirits of their dead ancestors by traveling to Tuonela in a state of trance created by rituals. He had to make his way over the Tuonela river by tricking the ferryman. While in Tuonela, the shaman had to be careful not to get caught: the living were not welcome there. Shamans who were caught could end up decaying in the stomach of a giant pike fish with no hope of returning to normal life. If the shaman died during the trance ritual, it was believed that he had been caught by the guards at Tuonela.

== Mythology ==

The pagan Finns had many myths about their gods and their great heroes. Because they lived in a non-literate society, the stories were taught orally as folklore, and they were not written down. Finnic mythology survived Christianisation by being told as myths. Many of these myths were later written down in the 19th century as the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, which was created to be a national epic of Finland by Elias Lönnrot.

== Sanctuaries ==
=== Rock paintings ===

Rock paintings were common in Baltic Finnic paganism, and were often done with red clay during the Stone Age. These paintings would often symbolize common animals such as deer and fish, along with humans and palm prints. Folk poetry may have also been preserved on these rocks, however they have not survived on these rock paintings, and instead have been carried through generations via oral tradition. It is believed that most of these rock paintings were done by the Comb Ceramic culture.

=== Hiisi ===

Hiisi or sacred woods were places where people often went to during pilgrimages or served as a burial site to take sacrifices. Within these sacred woods, there would often be a special enclosed area for sacrifices, in which it was forbidden to enter, except for those who were doing the sacrificing to the deities. In Baltic Finnic folklore, hiisi sites were also likened to be the creation of the Hiidet (giants), and through oral tradition, jotuni or giants were said to dwell in hiisi sites.

=== Wetlands ===
Wetlands, such as bogs, swamps, springs and streams were holy places, especially for the use of sacrificing. The archeological findings of flint and tinderbox has shown that they have been used for the execution and disposal of those unwanted people in the tribe. Children who were born out of wedlock or those who had disabilities would also be killed in the wetlands. The word &quot;Suomi&quot; () is also thought to come from the word &quot;Suo&quot; ().

== Sacred animals ==

=== Bears ===

Finns heavily relied on hunting for survival before and during the Middle Ages. As such the animals that they hunted became vital to their survival, and they were treated with respect.

The bear was considered sacred and was venerated in the pagan beliefs of the Finns. Peijaiset, which was a memorial feast held to honour a slain animal, the most common animal to hold peijaiset to was the bear, and during the peijaiset, the bear was eaten and the bones were buried, and the skull placed on a venerated pine tree known as , kallohonkas were sacred places and it may have been a metaphor for the world tree. Peijaiset are also an important part of other Finno-Ugrics (Khanty and Mansi) and Siberians (Yugurs).

According to a pagan folk belief, the first bear came to people&#x27;s dwellings to do evil, however a Giant slapped the bear on the ear, and the bear had to beg for mercy. A deal was made: the bear promised to stay in the forest from then on, eat berries, and dig up common ants; the bear also promised to sleep all winter soundly in his nest. However, if it came back, people would then shoot and spear it. It kept its promise otherwise, which now sometimes ate cattle from the forest, from its own area. The story also follows a belief about why domestic animals came to the attention of people: to escape from the bear.

=== Other animals ===
In Karelia and Eastern Finland, before going hunting, hunters would pray to the emuu, the ancestral mother of the animal species being hunted, for help. The word &quot;emuu&quot; is Karelian and is related to the word &quot;emo&quot; &quot;animal mother&quot;. Each species had its own emuu.

From ancient drawings, petroglyphs, it is clear that the elk was a very important animal. Elk is also very important to other peoples of the region, such as the Komis, who depict their sky god Jenmar as half-human and half-elk. It appears much more than bears do, and it is theorised that the bear was such a holy animal that it was forbidden to depict it. Also, the bear&#x27;s name was almost forbidden to say, so many euphemisms were developed. The most usual Baltic Finnic word for bear in modern language, &quot;karhu&quot;, is just one of the many euphemisms, and it means &quot;rough fur.&quot; Among the many names of bear &quot;otso&quot; is probably the original &quot;real&quot; name, as suggested by the wide spread of the word otso and related words among many of the Uralic languages. Many euphemisms for bear are local.

Many water birds were holy for Finns and other Baltic Finns. They were often depicted on petroglyphs. It was believed that if you killed a water bird, you would die soon after. The holiest water bird was the swan. With its long neck, it could look to all the levels of the world, including &quot;Tuonela&quot;, the land of the dead. Birds are found often in Uralic mythology. For example, there are many stories about a bird creating the world. A very common Uralic myth is where a hunter (Finnish: Lemminkäinen, Mari Salij) travels to the underworld to marry a woman and comes across the primordial waterbird on the river of the underworld, the hunter shoots the waterbird with his bow, but the waterbird escapes and terrible things happen to the hunter. In many traditions it was believed that the world was created by the egg of a bird. In other traditions it was believed that the world was created on mud that bird took in its beak while diving.

In Karelia it was believed that a bird brings the soul to a newborn baby, and that the same bird takes the soul with it when that person dies. This soul-carrying bird was called &quot;&quot;, &quot;soul-bird&quot;. In some traditions people carried artifacts depicting their sielulintu. Sielulintu was believed to guard their souls while they slept. After the person died, the artifact-bird was inserted to sit on the cross at the person&#x27;s grave. Such crosses with soul birds still exist in graveyards in Karelia. This is one example how Christian and Pagan beliefs still existed side by side hundreds of years after the Christianisation of the Finnish and Karelian people.

== Shamanism ==
Shamanism played a big part in Baltic Finnic paganism, as it did (and still does) in Siberian (Chukchi, Yugaghir and Ainu) as well as in other Finno-Ugric pagan faiths. A &quot;tietäjä&quot; (shaman, literally &quot;one who knows&quot;) is a wise and respected person in the community, believed to have a special relationship with the spirit world. Shamans go into a trance to commune with spirits and ancestors or to take a journey into the spirit realm, the shaman would go into these trances via aid, such as witch drums, bear teeth and paws, and dancing. During trances shamans may ask their ancestors or various nature spirits for guidance. They believe that nature has the answers to all questions. Shamans were typically men of high standing in the local society, often landed peasants; it was thought that wealth was evidence of magic powers.

Shamans would most often play the roles of medical doctors, and would receive their medical information through their trances by visiting spirits and deities. Shamans would also have important religious influence, as tietäjä were fortunetellers, prophets and priests.

Among the Finns&#x27; western neighbours, the Norse of Scandinavia, it was a common belief that the Finns were wizards. In the Norse sagas, inclusion of a Finnish element almost always signifies a supernatural aspect to the story. According to tales, foreign seafarers bought ropes tied with three knots from Finns. By opening one knot, a seaman could raise a wind to make his ship go faster. However, opening all three knots would raise a storm. Finnish wizards were known and feared by neighbouring peoples around the Baltic Sea.

== Christianisation ==

The Christianisation of Finland, Estonia and Karelia began in Finland with Christian missionaries to entering Finland in around the 1000s.

=== In Finland ===
Swedish Crusaders entered Finland in and with the conquests by Sweden of Finland, Christianity began to have influence across Finland, however the native pagan religion persisted. Christianity began to gain more influence and power to convert with the establishment of the Bishopric of Turku in 1276, and with the Protestant Reformation, when Mikael Agricola translated the New Testament (&quot;Se Wsi Testamenti&quot;) into the Finnish language.

=== In Karelia ===
With the conquests of East-Karelia by the Novgorod Republic and various Finnish-Novgorodian wars, Eastern Orthodoxy began to have influence over much of Karelia.

Written information about Baltic Finnic paganism began to be collected in the 1800s, especially in Karelia, when Christianity was already the main religion across much of the Finno-Ugric community. Despite this, especially in Orthodox Karelia, many old beliefs and myths survived. The stories about Jesus and Väinämöinen, as well as the stories about Ukko and the God of Christianity, lived side by side and sometimes even got mixed up. Much information about the pagan faith has been preserved as part of folk tales, which, especially in Karelia.

== Songs and incantations ==

In the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries, Baltic Finnic folk magic often incorporated chanted or sung incantations. These incantations might bring healing or presage a &quot;tietäjä&#x27;s&quot; (shaman, literally &quot;one who knows&quot;) ecstatic trance. In the twentieth century, an American researcher in Minnesota reported sung charms for summoning cattle, avoiding hiccups, and avoiding cold based on interviews with a Finnish immigrant.

== Baltic Finnic Neopagan movements ==

In the 20th century, with the rise of the neopagan movement across the world, Finnish neopaganism arose as a reconstructed form of the old religion. It is mainly practiced in Finland where it has had an official minority religion status since 2013. Finnish neopaganism accounts for a relatively small percentage of the population. In 2020, the registered religious community of Finnish neopaganism, Karhun kansa (&quot;The Folk of the Bear&quot;), had approximately 80 members.

In Estonia, Estonian neopaganism was also founded in the early 20th century, Estonian neopaganism adapted many beliefs and myths of the ancient faith. There are two major sects of Estonian neopaganism, which includes Maausk and Taaraism. Maausk is considered an &#x27;umbrella&#x27; of native faith movements, encompassing deities, nature worship and earth religion, while Taaraism is a monistic faith centered around Tharapita, who is a pagan deity similar to Ukko. There were 3,860 self-declared adherents of Maausk and 1,770 adherents of Taarausk in 2021, in Estonia.

== Holidays ==
In Finland under Swedish rule, the practice of Baltic Finnic paganism was forbidden from the 1600s onwards, however there were still sacred groves where the pagan faith was practiced during the 1700s, which churchmen and authorities tried to eradicate. Among the current official mainstream holidays in Finland, Juhannus (known as &quot;Ukon juhla&quot; before Christianisation) and Kekri were originally celebrations that belonged to the pagan faith.

Many ancient holiday practices have gone extinct over the years, however holidays such as , Vakkajuhlat, and are still sometimes celebrated by smaller communities such as village associates or pagans.

<text>Amanda Donohoe (born 29 June 1962) is an English actress. She first came to public attention at age 16 for her relationship with pop singer Adam Ant, appearing in the music videos for the Adam and the Ants singles &quot;Antmusic&quot; (1980) and &quot;Stand and Deliver&quot; (1981) during their four-year relationship. After making her film debut in &quot;Foreign Body&quot; (1986), she co-starred in &quot;Castaway&quot; with Oliver Reed and starred in two films by Ken Russell: &quot;The Lair of the White Worm&quot; (1988) and &quot;The Rainbow&quot; (1989).

Donohoe later moved to the United States, where she appeared in films and in television series, which included winning a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress during her two years (1990–1992) as C.J. Lamb on the NBC drama series &quot;L.A. Law&quot;. She also appeared in the series &quot;Frasier&quot; in the episode &quot;Call Me Irresponsible&quot;. Other television roles include Natasha Wylde on the British soap opera &quot;Emmerdale&quot; (2009–2010). She has had numerous stage roles, including Yelena in a 1996 Broadway production of &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot;.

==Early life==
Donohoe was born in London, to Ted and Joanna Donohoe. She has an older sister, Cordelia. She is of Irish, Russian and Swiss ancestry. Her father worked for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, which led to her family moving a great deal, with a base in London but also living for periods overseas. After her father&#x27;s retirement, he joined her mother in her antiques-dealing business.

Donohoe was educated at the Francis Holland School. When 15 years old, she met Adam Ant and a year later, she left her parents&#x27; home and moved in with Ant in Notting Hill. In October 1980, she accompanied Ant to the recording of the &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; performance of &quot;Dog Eat Dog.&quot; Afterwards, in an incident in the BBC corridors, she personally stepped in to physically defend Ant from an assault by rival band 4&quot; Be 2&quot; which was also on the premises.

In 1981, Donohoe appeared in the promotional videos for the songs &quot;Antmusic&quot; and &quot;Stand and Deliver&quot; by Adam and the Ants, which were screened on TV when the band was at the height of its fame. Shortly before the band began its 1981 world tour, Donohoe was offered a place at the Central School of Speech and Drama; she left Ant.

==Career==
After graduation, Donohoe came to the attention of worldwide audiences in 1986 when she was cast to co-star with Oliver Reed as Lucy Irvine in &quot;Castaway&quot;. She followed this with roles in two Ken Russell films, &quot;The Lair of the White Worm&quot; and &quot;The Rainbow&quot;.

After moving to Los Angeles in 1990, Donohoe made her debut on television in the role of lawyer Cara Jean &quot;C.J.&quot; Lamb on the American television series &quot;L.A. Law&quot; in which she appeared during the fifth and sixth seasons of the series. In February 1991, she took part in the first of the so-called &quot;lesbian kiss episodes&quot; on American television when her character privately kissed fellow lawyer Abby Perkins, played by Michele Greene. Some of her other television roles include &quot;Bad Girls&quot; and a guest appearance in &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;. She had a major supporting role in the comedy film &quot;Liar Liar&quot; (1997), starring Jim Carrey.

Donohoe made her Broadway debut in a 1995 production of &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot;, at the Circle in the Square Theatre. She returned to the UK to play Mrs. Robinson in a 2001 stage production of &quot;The Graduate&quot;. In 2002, she attended the gala opening party for Le Touessrok Hotel in Mauritius.

After moving back to the UK in the early 2000s, Donohoe took the role of DI Susan Alembic in the crime drama &quot;Murder City&quot; (2004–2006). In 2009 she joined the cast of ITV soap opera &quot;Emmerdale&quot; as businesswoman Natasha Wylde. Donohoe played the character until leaving the series in November 2010. On 18 and 19 February 2010, she was a guest panelist on &quot;Loose Women&quot;. She has also lent her voice to the Activision PC video game &quot;Santa Fe Mysteries: The Elk Moon Murder&quot; as Karen Gordon.

==Personal life==
A socialist and feminist, Donohoe said in a Q&amp;A with &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2001 that she was categorically opposed to the death penalty, supported the monarchy, and would vote for the Labour Party in the general election of that year. Donohoe considered smoking cigarettes to be her most unappealing habit, and said she cooked and drank good red wine to relax.

<text>The Kick Inside is the debut studio album by English singer-songwriter Kate Bush. Released on 17 February 1978 by EMI Records, it includes her UK No. 1 hit, &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. The album peaked at No. 3 on the UK Albums Chart and has been certified Platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). Several progressive rock musicians were involved in the album including Duncan Mackay, Ian Bairnson, David Paton, Andrew Powell, and Stuart Elliott of the Alan Parsons Project and David Gilmour of Pink Floyd.

==Background and recording==
Having written songs since the age of 11, Kate Bush recorded demos with the assistance of her brothers, who were also musicians. A friend of theirs, Ricky Hopper, brought some of these tapes to various record companies in 1972, when Bush was 13. The tapes were passed over, but Hopper played them for his friend David Gilmour of Pink Floyd. Gilmour was immediately intrigued and went to meet with the Bush family and was impressed with Kate&#x27;s talent for songwriting. He financed some better-quality demos and while Pink Floyd were recording their album &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; (1975) at Abbey Road Studios, Gilmour played the tapes for record company executives. EMI Records was impressed and agreed to sign her, offering her an advance of £3,000. Two of the demos recorded in June 1975 were included on her debut album three years later: &quot;The Man with the Child in His Eyes&quot; and &quot;The Saxophone Song&quot;.

In 1976, Bush&#x27;s contract was finally agreed upon by her family. In preparation for the recording, she embarked on playing with the KT Bush Band around various pubs. According to her brother Paddy, who also played with her on stage, these started out as very small affairs with little public interest but grew to larger audiences over the months. Finally, in July and August 1977, the rest of the songs were recorded at AIR Studios in London, helmed by producer Andrew Powell. Bush was keen to keep the line-up of the KT Bush Band for the recordings, but EMI insisted that she use properly experienced session musicians. Powell engaged Ian Bairnson, Duncan Mackay and Stuart Elliott among others, many of whom he had worked with before.

It was around this time that Bush had started to study dance and movement as a way of presenting the songs. Subsequently, she credited her dance teacher Lindsay Kemp on the album; the song &quot;Moving&quot; was inspired by Kemp. EMI and Bush disagreed over the use of a certain shot, which emphasised her cleavage, on the picture sleeve for the first single. Initially, this was to be &quot;James and the Cold Gun&quot;, but Bush insisted on &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. EMI relented and the single was scheduled for release in November 1977. However, due to the disagreement over the picture sleeve, this date was pushed back to the new year of 1978. The song became a hit and reached number one in the UK Singles Chart in March. It stayed at the top of the charts for four weeks, becoming one of the biggest selling songs of the year and was the first time a female singer-songwriter topped the charts with a self-penned song.

The album, titled &quot;The Kick Inside&quot;, was released in February 1978 and featured 13 tracks. Bush&#x27;s cinematic and literary influences, qualities that would later be considered key to her work, were evident in the song &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. The song was not initially inspired by Emily Brontë&#x27;s novel but by a television adaptation, although Bush read the novel later in order to (in her own words) &quot;get the research right&quot;. Further influences can be found when she references Gurdjieff in &quot;Them Heavy People&quot;, while the title song is inspired by the ballad of Lizie Wan. Bush also writes openly about sexuality, particularly on the erotic &quot;Feel It&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Amour Looks Something Like You&quot;. &quot;Strange Phenomena&quot; questions unusual coincidences, premonition, and déjà vu.

The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;The Man with the Child in His Eyes&quot;, reached number six in the UK. Three other singles were released around the world during the next two years: &quot;Them Heavy People&quot;, &quot;Moving&quot; (which reached number one in Japan) and &quot;Strange Phenomena&quot;. &quot;The Man with the Child in His Eyes&quot; also charted on the American &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, Bush&#x27;s only single to do so until 1985. It peaked at number 85. Bush made an appearance on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in December 1978. Despite this publicity, &quot;The Kick Inside&quot; failed to enter the Top 200 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; albums chart.

The album peaked at number three on the UK Albums Chart and remained on the chart for much of the rest of the year. Eventually clocking up 71 weeks in the chart, it was certified platinum and remains one of Bush&#x27;s biggest selling records.

==Release==
&quot;The Kick Inside&quot; was released in the UK on 17 February 1978. In November 2018, Bush released box sets of remasters of her studio albums, including &quot;The Kick Inside&quot;.

Seven different versions of the album&#x27;s cover are known: 

# Standard UK cover (Bush holding on to a large Chinese styled kite superimposed on to a drawing of a human eye)
# US cover (Bush in a wooden box), 
# Canadian cover (Bush with hands on head), 
# Yugoslavian cover (Bush in white dress - upper body)
# Japanese cover (Bush in pink leotard - upper body)
# Swedish cassette edition (Bush in white dress - &#x27;Wuthering Heights&#x27; video still shot, full body) 
# Uruguayan cover (a black and white facial close up. This cover is the rarest and most valuable due being issued in very limited numbers.

The initial US edition used the same cover image as the standard Canadian issue, but this soon changed to the more familiar &#x27;Kate in wooden box&#x27; image used on subsequent American issues. The UK &#x27;kite sleeve&#x27; was also chosen as the artwork in various EU and South American countries as well as Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Scandinavia. All the original global vinyl variants (except for Uruguay) feature the same cover art on the reverse of the sleeve. 

It was released (twice) as a limited edition picture disc in the &#x27;kite sleeve&#x27;. These issues added an extra &#x27;P&#x27; to the black vinyl&#x27;s catalogue number (EMCP 3223) on both the sleeve and the disc itself. Two editions were released: 

* The first (released in 1979) for the UK market and has a circular sticker stating that it is a picture disc (usually in the top left hand corner of the sleeve). 
* The second pressing (apparently aimed at the US market, where the first pressing had proven popular) has an oval sticker (usually top centre). The second disc also states &quot;manufactured in the UK by EMI Records Ltd.&quot; as part of the copyright notice printed on the disc (due to its export status). The first edition does not have this wording.

==Critical reception==

Contemporary reviews were full of praise for the album. &quot;Billboard&quot; favoured the songs &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; and &quot;Them Heavy People&quot; among others and said Bush wrote &quot;evocative lyrics&quot; and delivered them with &quot;smooth and unrestrained vocals&quot;. Kris DiLorenzo of &quot;Crawdaddy&quot; said that &quot;Bush&#x27;s talent for soul-baring would be frightening were it not so ingenuous; she writes from a well of fantasy and feeling with a patina of experience, her concerns universal and womanly, not the usual wilted kitten yearning or last-rave bathos.&quot; Peter Reilly of &quot;Stereo Review&quot; praised Bush for going against the grain in women&#x27;s music. He favoured the songs &quot;The Man with the Child in His Eyes&quot; and &quot;Room for the Life&quot; but cared less for &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; and &quot;James and the Cold Gun&quot;.

In later reviews, the album continued to receive universal praise. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; critic Laura Snapes said of the album, &quot;It is ornate music made in austere times, but unlike the pop sybarites to follow in the next decade, flaunting their wealth while Britain crumbled, Bush spun hers not from material trappings but the infinitely renewable resources of intellect and instinct: Her joyous debut measures the fullness of a woman&#x27;s life by what&#x27;s in her head.&quot; Snapes spoke highly of every track, but had slight lyrical reservations for &quot;Room for the Life&quot;. In a 2008 review for BBC Music, writer Chris Jones said, &quot;Using mainly session musicians, &quot;The Kick Inside&quot; was the result of a record company actually allowing a young talent to blossom. Some of these songs were written when she was 13! Helmed by Gilmour&#x27;s friend, Andrew Powell, it&#x27;s a lush blend of piano grandiosity, vaguely uncomfortable reggae and intricate, intelligent, wonderful songs. All delivered in a voice that had no precedents.&quot; He says that the record company wanting to push &quot;James and the Cold Gun&quot; as the first single was a mistake as he labels it the album&#x27;s &quot;dullest track&quot;. AllMusic&#x27;s Bruce Eder said that the album is &quot;the sound of an impressionable and highly precocious teenager spreading her wings for the first time&quot; and called it &quot;a mightily impressive debut&quot;.

Not all reviews were positive. Sandy Robertson, from the now defunct music magazine &quot;Sounds&quot;, criticized the lyrics, especially on the song &quot;Kite&quot;: &quot;WHAT IS this supposed to be? Doom-laden, &#x27;meaningful&#x27; songs (with some of the worst lyrics ever; sample: &#x27;Beelzebub is aching in my belly-o/My feet are heavy and I&#x27;m rooted in my wellios&#x27;) sung with the most irritatingly yelping voice since Robert Plant&quot;.

In an article for &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot;, Marcello Carlin wrote that &quot;The Kick Inside&quot; &quot;probably kicked down more doors than the whole of the first and second waves of punk combined&quot;, writing of Bush&#x27;s unusual subjects, stark voice (&quot;seeming to glide and swoop at will, covering three-and-a-half octaves with minimal apparent effort&quot;) and piano chord progressions, saying &quot;their delayed sustain, their unexpected trapdoor modulations, the very fingers which were playing them ... couldn’t be ascribed to any realistic precedent; for one very important thing, they sounded so unambiguously feminine.&quot;

==Comments from other musicians==
Singer-songwriter Beth Orton named &quot;The Kick Inside&quot; one of her favourite albums. Fiona Apple said, &quot;I used to sing and play a bunch of her songs from &quot;The Kick Inside&quot; at my piano when I was a kid: &#x27;Feel It&#x27; and &#x27;Moving&#x27; and &#x27;The Kick Inside&#x27; and &#x27;Wuthering Heights&#x27;.&quot; Sarah McLachlan said she &quot;loved&quot; the album and was &quot;really attracted to her voice and songs&quot;.

<doc id="1152328" wikidata="Q2067258" url="?curid=1152328" title="Battle Beyond the Stars">
<text>Battle Beyond the Stars is a 1980 American space opera film produced by Roger Corman, directed by Jimmy T. Murakami, and starring Richard Thomas, Robert Vaughn, George Peppard, John Saxon, Sybil Danning and Darlanne Fluegel. Inspired by the Americanized edit under Corman&#x27;s lead; Battle Beyond the Sun (1962) of Soviet film Nebo Zovyot (1959), it was intended as a futuristic &quot;&quot;Magnificent Seven&quot; (itself a western version of &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;) in outer space&quot;, the screenplay was written by John Sayles with the score by James Horner and special effects designed by filmmaker James Cameron. The film was theatrically released by Corman&#x27;s New World Pictures and was a moderate box office success, despite receiving mixed reviews from critics.

==Plot==

Farm world Akir is threatened by the tyrannical warlord Sador, ruler of the Malmori Empire. Sador&#x27;s body parts are deteriorating and he lives only by stealing organs from others. Sador demands that the peaceful Akira submit to him when he returns in &quot;seven risings&quot;. Zed, last of the famous Akira Corsairs, suggests they hire mercenaries to protect them. Since Akir lacks valuable resources, its people can offer only food and shelter in payment. Unable to go in person, Zed offers his ship. Shad, a young man who has piloted the ship and is well known to its AI Nell, volunteers.

Shad goes to the space station of Doctor Hephaestus, an old friend of Zed. The station is populated mostly by androids, except for two humans: Hephaestus, whose numerous life support-systems have turned him into a cyborg, and his beautiful daughter Nanelia, who looks after him and the androids. The doctor wants Shad to mate with his daughter, by force if necessary. Shad persuades Nanelia to help him escape. She follows in her own ship; although it has no weapons, her highly advanced computer systems might be useful. The two split up to look for more mercenaries.

Shad encounters Cowboy, a freighter-pilot from Earth who is ambushed by Space Jackers while delivering a shipment of laser-handguns to the planet Umateal. Shad saves Cowboy from the Jackers. They arrive at Umateal too late to stop the destruction of the planet by Sador&#x27;s flagship, the &quot;Hammerhead&quot;, which is equipped with a Stellar Converter. Lacking the fuel to carry his weapons back home, Cowboy offers them to Akir instead. Shad talks Cowboy into sharing his gunslinging experience with the Akira as well.

Shad meets a set of five alien clones who share a group consciousness named Nestor. They admit their life is incredibly dull, since their whole race shares one mind. In order to be entertained, they have sent five members to join Shad&#x27;s cause. Nestor does not require payment, saying they are completely self-sufficient. Next, Shad recruits Gelt, a wealthy assassin who cannot show himself on any civilized planet for fear of retribution. Gelt offers his services in return for being allowed to live peacefully among the Akira. On his way back to Akir, Shad is approached by Saint-Exmin of the Valkyrie. She is a headstrong woman looking to prove herself in battle. She pilots the &quot;Dart&quot;, a small but extremely fast ship with enhanced firepower. Shad finds her annoying and wishes she would go away, but she tags along.

While passing through the Lambda Zone, Nanelia&#x27;s ship is attacked by a light creature called a &quot;zyme&quot; which is killed by the powerful Gator ship of Cayman of the Lazuli. Cayman and his eclectic crew of aliens are &quot;zymers,&quot; who hunt zyme as whalers hunt whales. After Cayman implies he could cook her down for protein or sell her, Nanelia accuses Cayman of being as heartless as Sador. Startled and enraged by the mention of the man who destroyed his homeworld long ago, Cayman joins their cause for the promise of Sador&#x27;s head. Back on Akir, Shad&#x27;s sister Mol is captured by Malmori pilots Kalo and Tembo, with the intent to rape her. As Shad and Company return, their approach frightens the Malmori into attempting to escape. Mol interferes with their controls, allowing Gelt the opportunity to destroy their ship, killing all three. On the planet&#x27;s surface, the heroes are greeted with caution by the natives, who are wary of violent species. When Sador returns, his Malmori forces are intercepted by Shad&#x27;s hired warriors. Gelt dogfights his way to the &quot;Hammerhead&quot;, which shoots him down. Shad insists that Gelt be buried with a fresh-cooked meal, as that was their arrangement: a meal and a place to hide. Cowboy and the laser-toting Akira ward off a Malmori ground force backed by a Sonic Tank. Many of Sador&#x27;s troops are killed, and their Sonic Tank is destroyed; however, many Akira die as well, including Zed.

After surviving an assassination attempt by Nestor, Sador launches the remainder of his fleet in a retaliatory strike against Akir. Saint-Exmin makes an attack run on &quot;Hammerhead&quot;, then blows herself up, achieving the glorious death that she sought. Although Sador&#x27;s aerospace forces are wiped out, &quot;Hammerhead&quot; picks off all the remaining mercenaries with laser battery-fire and nuclear missiles. Only Nell, piloted by Shad and Nanelia, survives the Malmori onslaught. Crippled and unable to fight, Nell is captured by &quot;Hammerhead&quot;&#x27;s tractor beam. Nanelia and Shad activate Nell&#x27;s self-destruct program, then flee in an escape pod. When Sador commands Nell to surrender, she detonates, causing his Stellar Converter to backfire and disintegrate &quot;Hammerhead&quot;. As Shad and Nanelia return to Akir, Nanelia despairs over their friends&#x27; deaths. Shad shares with her the teachings of Akir&#x27;s &quot;Varda&quot;: nobody is truly dead when they have been loved and are celebrated by the living. The Akira will always remember the sacrifices made by the mercenaries, who will forever be honored in the legends of Akir.

==Production==
===Development===
&quot;Battle Beyond the Stars&quot; was budgeted at an estimated $2,000,000. At the time of its release, it was the most expensive film produced by Roger Corman. Much of the budget allegedly went toward paying the salaries of George Peppard and Robert Vaughn, since both of screenwriter Sayles&#x27; previous films were low-budget productions.

To save on costs, the film was produced in Corman&#x27;s own studio, his &quot;renowned lumberyard facility&quot; in Venice, California. Initially, the film came out of producer Roger Corman&#x27;s desire to make a space opera-style film in the wake of the massive worldwide success of &quot;Star Wars&quot;. Up-and-coming screenwriter John Sayles had already written the Corman-produced &quot;The Lady in Red&quot; and &quot;Piranha&quot;, the latter of which was both a financial and critical success. At one point, Australian director Richard Franklin &quot;(Patrick, Psycho II&quot;) was attached to direct. However, he was replaced by Jimmy T. Murakami, a veteran animator who had previously been an uncredited co-director on Corman&#x27;s &quot;Humanoids from the Deep&quot;.

The film was co-financed by Orion Pictures who distributed the film in Europe. (Corman had a relationship with those executives when they worked at United Artists and had done a similar thing with them on &quot;Piranha&quot;.)

The planet Akir and its inhabitants, the Akira, a peaceful alien race at the center of the conflict, were named in honor of director Akira Kurosawa, whose film &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; provided the framework for the plot.

Corman initially hired James Cameron as a model maker for his studio after being impressed with his short film &quot;Xenogenesis&quot;. When the original art director for the film was fired, Cameron became responsible for the majority of the film&#x27;s special effects, or, as Cameron later put it, &quot;production design and art direction&quot;. This was Cameron&#x27;s first &quot;big break&quot; in the entertainment industry, and it helped to propel his career. He was recommended by long-time working partner and future wife Gale Anne Hurd, who was at the time working for Corman.

While Cameron initially worked on camera rigging, he soon started working on special effects and production design of interior sets. The low-budget led to Cameron&#x27;s designing the spaceship&#x27;s corridors out of spray-painted McDonald&#x27;s containers. Cameron paid great attention to detail, and hardly slept for weeks while working on the film. His hard work paid off, as the special effects were one aspect of the film highly received by both fans and critics, opening the door for his later successes.

According to Hurd, actor Bill Paxton was employed on the set as a carpenter, which is where she first met him, before working with him and Cameron on &quot;Aliens&quot;: &quot;So my first memory of Bill was him pounding nails and cracking everybody up. I mean, we’d be working at three or four in the morning and he would be the one who kept all our spirits up. He was that person on and off set&quot;.

===Score===
This was composer James Horner&#x27;s third film score. He had previously worked on Roger Corman&#x27;s &quot;Humanoids from the Deep&quot; and &quot;The Lady in Red&quot;, and the producer brought him back for &quot;Battle Beyond the Stars&quot;. The score features several elements that would become regular staples of Horner&#x27;s many science fiction and adventure film scores. Several fans have noted similarities between these scores and those for later films, such as &quot;Krull&quot; and &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot;. Horner was to go on to become a regular collaborator with James Cameron, eventually winning an Academy Award for Best Original Score for &quot;Titanic&quot;.

===Sound===
The supervising sound editor, also responsible for special sound effects, such as Robert Vaughn&#x27;s &quot;laser shot&quot; – based on Clint Eastwood&#x27;s .44 Magnum from &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; – was David Yewdall, a regular contract-worker for Corman films. Yewdall later remarked on the &quot;film&#x27;s frugal sound editorial budget&quot; in his &quot;Practical Art of Motion Picture Sound&quot;, and explained some of the movie&#x27;s sounds: each of the seven spaceships had its own sound. The Nestor ship&#x27;s sound was made from human voices generated by the community choir from his hometown college in Coalinga, California; Robert Vaughn&#x27;s ship was based on the recording of a dragster.

===Casting===
Prior to production, a Hollywood trade paper announced that John Wayne would star in the film, under the direction of Ingmar Bergman. In all likelihood, this was a joke, either by the trade paper or the film&#x27;s publicist.

===Reused material===
The starship footage was reused in another Roger Corman science fiction film, &quot;Space Raiders&quot;, blasted by critics, as well as in the ultra-low budget Corman features &quot;Starquest II&quot;, &quot;Vampirella&quot;, &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot;, &quot;Dead Space&quot;, and &quot;Forbidden World&quot;. This same footage was also reused in later films and video games: a clip from the film (in 3-D) is shown during the movie theater fight scene at the end of &quot;Bachelor Party&quot;, and footage was also used for the LaserDisc game &quot;Astron Belt&quot;. The soundtrack was later recycled by Corman for &quot;Raptor&quot; and other films. Sections of Horner&#x27;s score were reused in &quot;Space Raiders&quot; and other Corman films.

==Release==
&quot;Battle Beyond the Stars&quot; was released into 330 theaters on July 25, 1980, grossing $1.732m in its first three days. Corman recouped his costs upon selling the foreign distribution to Orion Pictures and Warner Bros. for $2.5 million. He also resold cable rights to HBO for $750,000.

The film was released on DVD on February 6, 2001, by New Concorde. The film was later picked up by Shout! Factory, who released it on DVD and Blu-ray in 2011 as part of the &quot;Roger Corman&#x27;s Cult Classics&quot; series.

==Reception==
&quot;Battle Beyond the Stars&quot; received mixed reviews from critics due to its similar space opera styling, capitalizing upon the success of &quot;Star Wars&quot;. Cameron&#x27;s special effects were praised as being impressive, considering the film&#x27;s low budget, and helped to open the door for his future success.

In Creature Feature, John Stanley gave the movie three and a half stars, recommending the film for its fun script, special effects and its spirit of fun. &quot;Filmink&quot; called it one of George Peppard&#x27;s &quot;best ever films&quot; in which his performance was &quot;warm, funny, touching… this sort of performance was why Peppard remained employed, for all his issues.&quot;

Christopher John reviewed &quot;Battle Beyond the Stars&quot; in &quot;Ares Magazine&quot; #5:

The film review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 50%, based on reviews from twelve critics.

<doc id="1152345" wikidata="Q2265254" url="?curid=1152345" title="Ted Lange">
<text>Theodore William Lange III (; born January 5, 1948) is an American actor, director and screenwriter best known for his roles as bartender Isaac Washington in the TV series &quot;The Love Boat&quot; (1977–1986) and Junior in &quot;That&#x27;s My Mama&quot; (1974–75).

==Early life, family and education==
Lange was born in Oakland, California, in 1948, the son of Geraldine and Theodore William Jr., both working in theatre and television. Lange graduated from Oakland Technical High School where he was class and student body president. He completed an associate of arts degree at Merritt Junior College in Oakland before majoring in Drama at San Francisco City College. At City College, Lange was particularly active on the theatre scene and named Best Actor by the Black Students Association. He also won a scholarship to the University of Colorado Shakespearean Festival in the summer of 1968. Ted is a directing alum of The American Film Institute.

== Career ==
=== Career beginnings ===
After college, Lange started in theatre appearing in local Oakland productions and as guest artist in residence at the University of Santa Clara. Later, he joined the New Shakespearan Company, acting in plays at the University of California, Berkeley.

Lange made his Broadway debut in the musical &quot;Hair&quot; and was featured in the first national touring of the show. He also performed in a one-man show, &quot;Behind the Mask: An Evening with Paul Laurence Dunbar&quot;.

Lange&#x27;s first screen appearance was in the documentary film &quot;Wattstax&quot; in 1973. After appearing in the film &quot;Black Belt Jones&quot; in 1974, he portrayed Junior on the series &quot;That&#x27;s My Mama&quot; before landing the role of the ship&#x27;s bartender, Isaac, on &quot;The Love Boat&quot; in 1977, opposite Gavin MacLeod.

In the early 1980s, following a letter of recommendation from Lynn Redgrave (whom he met on an episode of &quot;The Love Boat&quot;), Lange attended a summer school at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art to perfect his Shakespeare acting skills.

After he left the show in 1987, Lange appeared in various films and in guest roles on &quot;227&quot;, &quot;In the Heat of the Night,&quot; &quot;Evening Shade&quot;, &quot;Boy Meets World&quot;, &quot;The King of Queens&quot;, &quot;Scrubs&quot;, &quot;Drake &amp; Josh&quot;, &quot;Psych&quot;, &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot;, and &quot;Are We There Yet?&quot;.

===Directing and writing===
In 1977, he co-wrote the screenplay for the drama &quot;Passing Through&quot;, starring Nathaniel Taylor. During the run of &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, Lange also served as director and screenwriter of several episodes of the series. In 1999, Lange directed two episodes of &quot;Love Boat: The Next Wave&quot;, the UPN series based on &quot;The Love Boat&quot;. He also directed episodes of &quot;Moesha&quot;, &quot;Dharma &amp; Greg&quot;, and &quot;Eve&quot;. In 2008, he directed the drama &quot;For Love of Amy&quot;.

Lange has also done extensive theater work as playwright and stage director. He has penned 17 plays, including &quot;George Washington&#x27;s Boy&quot;, a historical drama about the relationship between the first president and his favorite slave, along with the comedy &quot;Lemon Meringue Facade&quot;.

Lange remained close to Gavin MacLeod, his acting mentor, who was a Palm Springs resident and saw his plays. In a 2014 interview with CBS New York, he said of his long-running friendship with him &quot;Gavin lives in Palm Springs, I&#x27;m in LA. So, when I do my plays, he comes down and sees my plays or I&#x27;ll go see what he&#x27;s doing!&quot; Lange also said in a 2017 interview with The Wiseguyz Show: &quot;Oh yeah, sure, Gavin was wonderful. Gavin lives down here in Palm Springs and we&#x27;re still tight, all of us, Gavin and Bernie and Jill; we still see each other. Fred lives in a different state, we&#x27;re still close, we&#x27;re still good friends.&quot;

===&quot;Ask Isaac&quot;===
Before the American edition of &quot;FHM&quot; folded in 2006, Lange wrote a sex and advice column, titled &quot;Ask Isaac&quot;, with adult film actress Jenna Jameson.

===&quot;Celebrity Fit Club&quot;===
In 2006, Lange appeared in the fourth season of the VH1 reality show &quot;Celebrity Fit Club&quot;. He lost 28 pounds during the show&#x27;s run.

==Personal life==
Lange married Sheryl Thompson in 1978, and they divorced in 1989. The couple has two children, Theodore William IV and Turner Wallace Lange. Lange married Mary Ley in 2001. His mother, Geraldine Lange, was a personal secretary to a San Francisco mayor and was public affairs director of KBHK-TV in San Francisco in the early 1970s. She also hosted programs on KBHK-TV. She died from COVID-19 on April 10, 2021.

==Awards==
For his work theater directing, Lange received the NAACP&#x27;s Renaissance Man Theatre Award, the Heroes and Legends HAL Lifetime Achievement Award, and the Dramalogue Award. Lange has also been the recipient of the James Cagney Directing Fellow Scholarship Award from the American Film Institute along with the Paul Robeson Award from Oakland&#x27;s Ensemble Theatre.

<doc id="1152347" wikidata="Q477494" url="?curid=1152347" title="Sheet (sailing)">
<text>In sailing, a sheet is a line (rope, cable or chain) used to control the movable corner(s) (clews) of a sail.

==Terminology==
In nautical usage the term &quot;sheet&quot; is applied to a line or chain attached to the lower corners of a sail for the purpose of extension or change of direction. The connection in derivation with the root &quot;shoot&quot; is more clearly seen in &quot;sheet-anchor&quot;, one that is kept in reserve, to be &quot;shot&quot; in case of emergency.

== Fore-and-aft rigs==
Fore-and-aft rigs comprise the vast majority of sailing vessels in use today, including effectively all dinghies and yachts. The sheet on a fore-and-aft sail controls the angle of the sail to the wind, and should be adjusted to keep the sail just filled. Most smaller boats use the Bermuda rig, which has two or three sets of sheets:

* The mainsheet is attached to the boom, and is used to control the mainsail. In a rig with no boom on the mainsail, the mainsheet would attach directly to the mainsail clew. A mainsheet is a line connected to the boom which allows a sailor to control the speed of a boat.
* The jib sheet attaches to the clew of the jib, and controls it. The jib has a sheet on each side, only one of which (the leeward one) will be in use at one time.
* The spinnaker sheet attaches to the clew(s) of the spinnaker, if carried. A symmetrical spinnaker has two sheets, an &quot;active&quot; one and a &quot;lazy&quot; one, in the same way as a jib, but they are attached to the sail&#x27;s two separate clews. On boats larger than around thirty feet, the spinnaker will also be fitted with guys, which are similar to sheets but control the pole instead of the sail. On smaller boats the lazy sheet is used as a guy.

On the smallest boats, a sheet is often a simple line, pulled by hand; on larger boats, intermediate blocks are sometimes used to provide mechanical advantage. However, many blocks and their multiply reeved lines, particularly on headsails, have been replaced by single-line sheets trimmed by powerful winches.

== Square rig ==
Square-rigged vessels are much less common, and are usually large ships. Nevertheless, they too have sheets on the movable corners of their square sails. Unlike fore-and-aft sheets, though, square-rig sheets do not control the angle of the sails (which is performed using braces); instead, they are used to haul the corners of the sails from their stowed positions down towards the tip of the yard below. They are then not adjusted significantly while sailing until the sail is to be handed (put away) again. The lowest sails, the courses, are trimmed using the sheets as these sails are loose footed and are secured to yards only at the head.

<text>Barbara Linnea Quigley (born May 27, 1958) is an American actress, best known as a scream queen in low-budget horror films during the 1980s and 1990s. Born in Davenport, Iowa, Quigley first pursued her career in the late 1970s, shortly after moving to Los Angeles. While working at Jack LaLanne&#x27;s health spa, she was encouraged by her friends to try modeling, and also began taking acting and guitar-playing classes. After appearing as an extra in various films, Quigley got her first acting role in the Charles Band-produced film &quot;Fairy Tales&quot; (1978). She continued receiving small parts, mostly in B movies. Her first bigger part was in the 1981 slasher film &quot;Graduation Day&quot;. Quigley followed with more films such as &quot;Savage Streets&quot; (1984) and &quot;Silent Night, Deadly Night&quot; (1984).

In 1985, Quigley appeared in the zombie horror film &quot;The Return of the Living Dead&quot; playing a teenaged punk, which is considered one of her most notable roles and earned her &quot;scream queen&quot; status. During the second half of the 1980s, Quigley starred in a number of low-budget films following the popularization of home video. She repeatedly worked with the directors David DeCoteau (&quot;Creepozoids&quot;, &quot;Nightmare Sisters&quot;, and &quot;Sorority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl-O-Rama&quot;) and Kevin Tenney (&quot;Night of the Demons&quot; and &quot;Witchtrap&quot;), and appeared alongside fellow scream queens Brinke Stevens and Michelle Bauer. By the end of the 1980s, Quigley decided to take a different direction and starred in the first two films of Rick Sloane&#x27;s comedy series &quot;Vice Academy&quot;. However, she continued being type cast as a victim in horror films.

Aside from her acting career, Quigley is also a singer (she formed an all-female band, The Skirts, in the early 1980s) and an author (she wrote three books: &quot;The Linnea Quigley Bio &amp; Chainsaw Book&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Screaming as Fast as I Can: My Life in B-Movies&quot;, and &quot;Skin&quot;). She is also an animal rights activist and a member of PETA.

==Career==

===Early life and career beginnings===
Quigley was born on May 27, 1958, in Davenport, Iowa, the daughter of Dorothy and William Heath Quigley. Her father was a chiropractor and psychologist. He worked as an executive vice president at Palmer College of Chiropractic. An only child, Quigley attended Garfield Elementary and Sudlow Middle Schools in Davenport. In 1972, she began attending Bettendorf High School in Bettendorf, Iowa. Quigley later reminisced about her school years: &quot;I was so shy. I didn&#x27;t move my mouth, didn&#x27;t sing in glee club or anything like that, didn&#x27;t do any plays. I was terribly, terribly shy.&quot;

Shortly after graduating from high school in 1976, Quigley moved with her parents to Los Angeles. She landed a job at Jack LaLanne&#x27;s health spa, where she met models who worked in films by doing work as extras. Encouraged by her friends, Quigley began taking acting and guitar-playing classes. One of her earliest acting jobs was a television commercial for Close-Up toothpaste. After getting a few extra parts, she got her first acting role in the Charles Band-produced erotic comedy &quot;Fairy Tales&quot; (1978), wherein she appeared as Sleeping Beauty. Her next role was in the pseudo-documentary &quot;Auditions&quot; (1978), again produced by Band and directed by Harry Hurwitz. She continued receiving small parts in films such as &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Near the Park&quot; (1981) and the Troma slasher &quot;Graduation Day&quot; (1981). She was given the role of Dolores after the original actress refused to do nude scenes. In 1981, producer and director Jim Feazell decided to shoot some additional footage for the reissue of his unsuccessful 1975 psychological thriller &quot;Wheeler&quot;. In one of the scenes, Quigley played a waitress menaced by a truck driver. The movie was re-released under the title &quot;The Hurting&quot; and later changed to &quot;Psycho from Texas&quot;.

Besides modeling and auditioning for films, Quigley also began auditioning for bands that would let her join in. She first played guitar in an all-female band, Mad Whistle, started by singer and songwriter Lucrecia Sarita Russo. Russo&#x27;s then-husband Jeffrey Spry appeared alongside Quigley in the film &quot;Graduation Day&quot; with his band Felony. Quigley then managed to form her own band called The Skirts. Her friend Haydee Pomar, whom she met on the set of Cheech &amp; Chong&#x27;s comedy &quot;Nice Dreams&quot; (1981), played the bass guitar. They practiced in the basement of the punk rock club The Masque and their music got featured in some of Quigley&#x27;s later movies. Their song &quot;Santa Monica Blvd. Boy&quot; was released on Mystic Records&#x27; 1983 compilation &quot;The Sound of Hollywood Girls&quot;.

===Acting career===
Quigley is best known for her role in &quot;The Return of the Living Dead&quot; (1985) (directed by Dan O&#x27;Bannon). She has also starred in dozens of other horror films, including &quot;Savage Streets&quot; (with Linda Blair), &quot;Silent Night, Deadly Night&quot;, &quot;Nightmare Sisters&quot;, &quot;Creepozoids&quot;, &quot;Sorority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl-O-Rama&quot;, &quot;Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers&quot;, &quot;Night of the Demons&quot; (the 1988 original and the 2009 remake), and &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master&quot;. Quigley is the author of two books about her career as a B-movie actress, &quot;Chainsaw&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Screaming as Fast as I Can&quot;. She has been called the &quot;Queen of the Bs&quot;.

Linnea co-starred with Daniel Baldwin in &quot;Stripperland&quot; (2011). She played in David DeCoteau&#x27;s movies &quot;1313: Cougar Cult&quot; (2012) and &quot;3 Scream Queens&quot; (2014), and Charles Band&#x27;s web series &quot;Trophy Heads&quot; (2014) with Brinke Stevens and Michelle Bauer. In 2012, Quigley guest appeared in Massachusetts death metal band Sexcrement&#x27;s music video entitled &quot;Trucker Bombed&quot;.

Alongside regular co-stars Brinke Stevens, and Michelle Bauer, Quigley appeared in and was a main subject for the 2011 documentary &quot;Screaming in High Heels: The Rise &amp; Fall of the Scream Queen Era&quot; and its 2020 follow up &quot;Screaming in High Heels: The Reunion&quot;. According to &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; and &quot;Horror Fuel&quot; magazine, Linnea will co-star alongside horror icons Michael Berryman, Bill Moseley and Kane Hodder in the 2022 feature &quot;Jasper&quot;, produced by Shaun Cairo.

==Personal life==
===Relationships===
Linnea&#x27;s father was Dr. William &quot;Nip&quot; Heath Quigley, a dean of education and vice president at Palmer College of Chiropractic in Davenport, Iowa. Her mother Dorothy was a homemaker. After she graduated from Bettendorf High School in 1976, she moved to California with her parents when her father became the president of the Los Angeles campus of Palmer College. He left the college in the late 1980s to open a private practice.

During the filming of &quot;Night of the Demons&quot; (1988), Quigley began a relationship with special-effects artist Steve Johnson. Later, while working on the film &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master&quot; (1988), Johnson proposed to Quigley on the set. &quot;I actually got engaged on the set of that movie right after coming out of Freddy&#x27;s chest. He gave me a ring so that was funny. While he&#x27;s hosing my K-Y Jelly off me and after it fell over almost killing us and some others, he still managed to ask me to marry him.&quot; They married on January 17, 1990, but divorced in 1992.

===Veganism===
Quigley is a vegan. She switched to a vegetarian diet in the late 1970s after her move to Los Angeles, first by eliminating red meat, then chicken and fish, and eventually all dairy and all other foods from animals. She is an animal-rights activist and an active member of the animal-rights organization PETA. In October 1990, she appeared on the cover of &quot;Vegetarian Times&quot;.

<doc id="1152361" wikidata="Q1124584" url="?curid=1152361" title="Sierra Madre Occidental">
<text>The Sierra Madre Occidental is a major mountain range system of the North American Cordillera, that runs northwest–southeast through northwestern and western Mexico, and along the Gulf of California. The Sierra Madre is part of the American Cordillera, a chain of mountain ranges (cordillera) that consist of an almost continuous sequence that form the western &quot;sounds&quot; of North America, Central America, South America, and West Antarctica.

==Etymology==
The Spanish name &quot;sierra madre&quot; means &quot;mother mountain range&quot; in English, and &quot;occidental&quot; means &quot;western&quot;, these thus being the &quot;Western mother mountain range&quot;. To the east, from the Spanish &quot;oriental&quot; meaning &quot;eastern&quot; in English, the Sierra Madre Oriental range or &quot;Eastern mother mountain range&quot; runs generally parallel to the Sierra Madre Occidental along eastern Mexico and the Gulf of Mexico.

The range extends from northern Sonora, a state near the Mexico–U.S. border at Arizona, southeast towards to the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt and Sierra Madre del Sur ranges. The high plateau that is formed by the range is cut by deep river valleys. This plateau is formed from volcanic rock overlying a basement of metamorphic rock.

This uplift has caused changes in weather patterns; increased rainfall occurring in the mountains has provided areas where ecosystems can form in wetter areas than surrounding land. This water source forms watersheds that provide the arid surroundings with water that makes it possible to irrigate and farm crops. The wet ecosystems are islands of biodiversity, differing significantly from what would otherwise be a desert landscape. Oak forests are the predominant plant life, and extend into the lowland deserts.

This forest and canyon land provided a place for a variety of indigenous people to live, until Spanish settlers with associated mestizos came into the area to found towns for the silver mines in the area. The major industries in the area now are agriculture and forestry, which have become contentious because of land degradation and the native population&#x27;s opposition to these practices.

==Geography==

The range trends from the north to southeast. Canyons cut by the rivers of the wet western slopes exist in addition to those of the northeast slopes, notably the Copper Canyon.

===Location===
The range runs parallel to the Pacific coast of Mexico, from just south of the Arizona-Sonora border southeast through eastern Sonora, western Chihuahua, Sinaloa, Durango, Zacatecas, Nayarit, Jalisco, Aguascalientes to Guanajuato, where it joins with the Sierra Madre del Sur and the Eje Volcánico Transversal (Transverse Volcanic Axis) of central Mexico after crossing . The mountains range from from the Gulf of California in the north, but begin to approach within of the Pacific in the south. These mountains are generally considered to be part of the much larger American cordillera, the mountains extending from Alaska down to these across western North America.

===Regions===
&quot;Sierra Tarahumara&quot; or &quot;Tarahumara&quot; is the name for the region of the Sierra Madre beginning at the Durango border and extending north. This name comes from the Tarahumara natives. This is a dramatic landscape of steep mountains formed by a high plateau that has been cut through with canyons including Copper Canyon, larger and, in places, deeper than the Grand Canyon. This plateau has an average elevation of with most of the more eroded canyons on the western slope, due to the higher moisture content.

The highest elevations occur in the Tarahumara range. The exact elevations of the highest peaks are not known within accurate enough ranges to determine their relative elevation. The highest point is probably Cerro Mohinora, located at . Estimates for the height of the mountain start around and go up to . However, Cerro Barajas, at , may be as high as although other sources give as the elevation. Cerro Gordo, at , may have an elevation between and .

The southern end of the mountains may be referred to as the Sierra Huichola. In this area, the Sierra Madre begins to give way to the Basin and Range Province. Subranges of this area include the Sierra de Alica and the Sierra Pajaritos, both in Nayarit, and the Sierra los Huicholes, Sierra de Morones, Sierra Nochistlán, and Sierra Fría extending eastwards into Jalisco, Zacatecas, and Aguascalientes.

===Water===
The mountains act as a source of water, in an otherwise arid environment from the increased precipitation from the mountain range. As such, rivers that have headwaters in the mountains provide water for irrigation in the surrounding lands. The need for water to irrigate prompted the construction of dams, which has been the source of several environmental concerns in the area.

The northern end of the range is more arid; hence, the Yaqui River, which drains that area, is an important source of irrigation in the state of Sonora. The Yaqui drains into the Gulf of California, as do the Fuerte River in Sinaloa and the Humaya River further south. The Río Grande de Santiago drains from the southern slopes of the Sierra Madre. Along the more arid eastern slopes of the mountains, the Nazas River and Aguanaval River drain the mountains into a closed basin. These mountains supply 90% of the water used for irrigation within the watershed. North of this system is the Conchos River which drains into the Rio Grande.

Along many rivers the arid conditions have caused courses to be dammed to provide water for irrigation. These dams have caused concerns along with those caused by other activities. The Yaqui has been dammed with three large reservoirs along its course. The Río Grande de Santiago has also been dammed, including the Aguamilpa Dam begun in 1991 and the El Cajón Dam upstream from it. To provide irrigation water for farming the dry basin, the Nazas river was dammed in the 1930s and 1940s. This has led to the former drainage lakes in the area drying up, and soil depletion from the elimination of the river as a source of soil. Due to the continued logging in the area, erosion on the slopes of hillsides has increased.

===Human===
Numerous small populations live in Copper Canyon, some of them around old missions. Many settlements consist of single families or small family groups near agricultural fields. There are also a few towns of note, including Creel, Chihuahua, with 5,000 inhabitants; it serves as a stop on the train line. South of Copper Canyon is the town of El Salto, Durango, situated along highway 40. To the west is Copala, Sinaloa.

To the south live the indigenous Cora people in the towns of Jesús María and La Mesa del Nayar. In addition, 1,000 people live in the village of Huajimic in Nayarit. The Bolaños River valley of Jalisco is populated with mining communities, such as San Martín de Bolaños, which has a population of around 3,000.

Few paved roads cross the mountains, meaning that travel times can be long, even between cities that are relatively close. In the north, Mexico Federal Highway 16 connects Hermosillo, Sonora and La Junta, Chihuahua. In the mountains, the La Entrada al Pacifico Corridor is an incomplete road intended to connect Los Mochis, Sinaloa and Chihuahua. Durango and Mazatlán are connected by highway 40, around 24 degrees north latitude.

==Geology==
The Sierra Madre Occidental is a high plateau of volcanic rock that is eroded in areas to reveal a basement composed of plutonic and sedimentary rocks underlying the two groups of extrusive volcanics. The lower of these groups is a series of volcanic rocks formed by lava flows. The surface of the plateau is made up of a second series of volcanic ignimbrites, covered mostly by clay rich organic soils. Some intrusions in the area have deposited ore veins that are commercially viable.

The landscape was shaped after rock placement. Rivers cut valleys into the plateau, following folds in the rocks. Rocks have broken off of the slopes, forming rocky sides. The bedrock is covered by the clay rich soils, except in eroded areas, where water carries away deposits leaving a stony surface.

===Geological history===
The basement is thought to be Older North American basement, especially in the North, and a number of different accreted terranes, which are mostly covered by Cenozoic volcanism. The northern extent of the Sierra Madre is the Cortés Terrane, although the northern extreme of this contains a small portion of the Carborca Terrane. Some of the northern end may also be underlain by a Precambrian basement placed around the same time as the Grenville Orogeny. Some of this area has a series of Paleozoic sedimentary sequences from a deep marine environment underlying it, considered by some to be part of the Cotes Terrane and by others to be transported. In some areas, distinct sedimentary rocks can be identified by shallow-water Silurian and Mississippian sedimentary rocks underlying deep-water Pennsylvanian and Permian, which are divided by Mississippian rhyolite. The Permian clastics contain some detrital rock that sit alongside low-grade metamorphosed sedimentary and volcanic rocks with serpentinite.

South of the Cortes and Carborca Terranes is the San José de García Terrane, which is a combination of Cretaceous arc volcanics and volcaniclastics, which may be thrusting over the Cortes terrane. The southern part of the range is made up of the Guerrero Composite Terrane, a large body, which is actually a complex of five different subterranes, not all of them within the main body of the Sierra Madre. However, the terrane is mostly covered by volcanics and sedimentary deposits, so it is only visible where erosion has revealed it. The main subterranes of the Guerrero Composite Terrane that are within the Sierra Madre are the Tahue and Zihuatanejo terranes. Dividing the Guerrero Terrane from the rest of the Sierra Madre terranes is a boundary that is thought to represent the Early Cretaceous Arperos Basin, a marine basin which separated the island arc that came to form the Guerrero terrane from the accretions that came to form the Sierra Madre terrane. It contains a lower formation made up of pillow basalts with pillow breccias, tuffs, and shales underlying a group of pelagic limestones, oozes, and turbidites.

Covering the southern basement are sedimentary and metamorphosed sedimentary rocks containing argillite, limestone, volcanic schist, slate, and greywacke which were exposed in the canyon of the Santiago River. Near these sediments late Oligocene to early Miocene granite and granodiorite intrusive bodies occur. A possible cause of this is that these bodies were roof pendants which were uplifted by plutons. Mesozoic limestone also occurs in northern portion of the mountains, mostly from the Cretaceous.
Towards the end of the Cretaceous, the Laramide orogeny increased the activity of magmatism in the area, forming the first major igneous series in the area. The igneous series are made up of formations of plutonic and volcanic rock, which would later be exposed. Interbedded with these rocks are sedimentary deposit rocks. In the center of the range, some of these rocks have been deformed by tectonic forcing that occurred at the same time. The southern part of the range contains none of the volcanism that is apparent in the northern range. These formations ended in the Paleocene. Eocene volcanism formed a series of andesitic and rhyolitic formations in the area, with spatial and temporal variations throughout. Most of the gold and silver deposits are also in these rocks.

In the Oligocene, ash flows became the predominant deposit of the area, with interbedded lava flows between. These ash flows began the second series of high magmatism formations. The Mid-Tertiary ignimbrite flare-up formed a series of ignimbrite formations, layered one atop another, that are sometimes broken by lava flows. The ignimbrite formations in this area cover the largest area of any known series, with ten calderas identified in the province. Three of these calderas are in Copper Canyon. The lava has formed a series of mafic rocks that comprise the Southern Cordilleran Basaltic Andesite Suite. The tuffs are above a thick formation of lava rock. Around five or six units have been identified, mostly around the Copper Canyon area. These tuffs have allowed wide-ranging correlation with formations in other geographical areas, for example Death Valley.

During the Miocene, three periods of volcanism marked separate events in the Sierras. Each period is marked by different volcanic processes. The first was a continuation of the Oligocene flare-up, which lasted through the early Miocene. This may be a distinct second occurrence of the same process, placing silica-rich lava above Oligocene rocks. Also in the early Miocene more intermediate basaltic andesites occur along faults and in grabens. Beginning in the early Miocene and continuing into the middle, an arc of andesite was placed during the spreading of the Gulf of California. The basin and range-style faulting of the middle-late Miocene took place at the same time as the placement of alkali basalts, In the westernmost slopes mafic dikes formed. These events have also been linked to the subduction of the Farallon Plate. Episodes of volcanism continued into the Quaternary.

===Structures===
The Sierras are believed to be a thick core covered by volcanics and eroded by numerous rivers. Some have suggested that the basement of the mountains have numerous intrusions made by mafic magma. At their surface, the mountains are made up of large-scale ignimbrite sheet that has been incised by rivers flowing from rainfall in the mountains. The surface of the plateau is almost exclusively from the second series of flows causing the rock that is most visible to be ignimbrites with lava flow layers. The region has a general strike from just west of north to just south of east.

Faults in the area tend to be younger than the upper volcanics, excluding those associated with calderas, but do occur in distinct periods. The large faults along the eastern slope have caused the slope to be made up of large escarpments that face into the interior basins. These faults are commonly covered by alluvium and basalt, making them difficult to discern, but can be found in certain fault blocks.

Grabens have formed in the north, and some of these are filled with volcanic and sedimentary floors, and long depressions have formed in the southern Sierra Madre. The faulting decreases in the center of the range where the faults are mostly small normal faults, but increases once again on the western slope. In fact, the major normal faults tend to diverge around the center of the core and join at either end. Some of these faults may have allowed ignimbrites to erupt from the surface, and so there may be some association between the ignimbrite occurrence and faults; this can be used to find out information about different kinds of basement rock present.

There are two faults dividing the Sierra Madre from the central Mexican Plateau. The more southern one is the north–south Aguascalientes fault extending from Altos de Jalisco to near Zacatecas, where it joins the more northern northwest–southeast trending San Luis–Tepehuanes fault extending from Guanajuato to Durango. The southern boundary of the Sierra Madre Occidental with the Jalisco block is a series of folds, thrust, and left lateral faults date from the middle Miocene. This may be evidence for a left transpressional shear zone. The area between this boundary and the Aguascalientes fault is filled with numerous grabens and half-grabens, as well an east–west left shear zone, the El Roble shear zone. At the west end of these grabens and half-grabens are the Pochotitan and the more northerly San Pedro fault systems, which form the western boundary of the faults in the southern mountains. In the north there is an unknown boundary between the Cortes Terrane and the Guerrero Composite Terrane. Some theorize that this is a section of the Mojave–Sonora Megashear, but this theory is not universally accepted; however, the Megashear is important, and, in fact, is necessary for reconstructions of the opening of the Gulf of California, as of 2003.

===Mineral deposits===
On a smaller scale, mineral deposits are distributed in formations of the Sierra Madre, although the events that placed these deposits vary throughout the mountains. The Guerrero composite terrane contains many of the economic deposits, often found in ore bodies younger than the Cretaceous.

Gold and silver deposits most commonly occur in the altered andesites of the early volcanics, typically these deposits are between 30 and 50 million years old. These are believed to be caused by later intrusions into the early flows. Fissure-vein deposits have been divided into two groups of fissure vein deposits, which are divided geographically into an eastern and western series. In the east, the gold and silver are accompanied by lead and zinc. In the south, the Bolaños mine district is contained with the Bolaños Graben. Some also occur as epithermal deposits. Also, some gold occurs along with copper in Cenozoic iron-oxide skarn and replacement deposits along the Pacific.

In addition to gold and silver and their related deposits, tin, iron, and mercury occur, sometimes in later units, mostly in later volcanics, and Molybdenum occurs in the mountains, often along with older copper deposits or in Oligocene deposits in the east. The belt of tin deposits lies mostly within the eastern slopes from Durango to Guanajuato. In these areas, tin occurs in rhyolitic ignimbrites in many, possibly over 1000, small deposits of cassiterite. Typically these deposits are divided from overlying ignimbrites by breccia, which may also contain ore. Many of these are thought to be hydrothermal deposits To the east of these units is a belt of more mercury deposits, followed by another belt of manganese deposits, although these deposits are mostly limited to Chihuahua and Hidalgo. Iron occurs in three different regions placed by different mechanisms. Along the Pacific there the numerous skarn and replacement deposits mentioned above with relation to gold. Iron occurs in Durango in the form of magnetite lava flows, which are often surrounded by smaller hematite deposits, thought to be ash flows. There is also a belt of iron deposits further east.

===Soil===
Most soil in the mountains is covered by an organic-rich layer over layers rich in clay. Soils are commonly phaeozems that are up to . Some soils are cambisols that are less than deep and well-drained. Due to the high clay content, which blocks water from being absorbed into the soil, larger rock particles in the soil help reduce runoff and soil losses from erosion. Areas that are covered in stone are known as lithosols, and make up most of the remaining surface in the mountains, especially on upper slopes. The last major soil type are vertisols, which are thin mineral-poor soils. Soils at higher elevations experience more leaching, due to increased rainfall. Acidic soils may have lower calcium content, leading to lower plant soil quality. Soils along the eastern slopes have increased organic content and a clay heavy layer that is developed more than those of the more arid eastern lands. The thickness of soil layers also increases.

Problems with soil degradation have been aggravated by the cultivation of drug crops, leading to deforestation of many areas. Other problems include overgrazing, which has led to terracing from cattle paths and the formation of a soil crust, and soil acidification, which poses a risk to some grasslands as of 2002.

==Climate==
The climate varies considerably between the northern and southern extents of this long mountain range. Seasonal variations also occur due to the presence of large bodies of warm water delivering warm damp air from each side of the range. This region undergoes a seasonal variety with two wet seasons, including a summer monsoon, and two dry seasons each year.

===Temperature, pressure, and wind===
Air pressure changes in northwestern Mexico and the southwest United States are the main causes of seasonal variation in the Sierra Madre. A high pressure area that rests over the mountains in the winter begins to move north of the mountains into New Mexico during the month of June. The high pressure begins to break down and move south during September or October; however, the breakdown is usually at a slower pace than the movement north. This high pressure belt is associated with the mechanics that form the Bermuda High.

The climate in the mountains is mild. Summer temperatures maintain a constant level. Maximum temperatures are typically in July at around 31 C with average temperatures of the order of 16 C during this same period. Mean annual temperatures are between above . Below-freezing temperatures can occur in the higher mountains, with precipitation occurring as snowfall certain times of year.

During the summer monsoon, wind patterns undergo large-scale changes. In May there is very little large-scale wind current through the mountains, most circulates around the mountains, although onshore flow is present. As the high pressure moves north, air is pulled off the Gulf of Mexico, bringing easterly winds aloft to the mountains. On the east slope of the mountain, daytime upslope winds flow to the crest, where the flow joins westerly winds. The mountains cause convection during the following monsoon season, during which nocturnal winds at low levels in the atmosphere move moisture overnight. Extensive lightning activity occurs during this season. After the high pressure breaks down, wind patterns return to those prior to the monsoon season.

=== Precipitation and humidity===
Precipitation varies on both annual and seasonal scales in the Sierra Madre. Annual differences in regional climate are associated with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation with El Niño years leading to a wetter climate. Monsoon rains come to the Sierra Madre in June as the high pressure area moves north, leading to wet summer seasons. This causes east winds bringing moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. On the western side of the mountains, which are affected by the largest change in precipitation between the dry season and monsoon season, in the monsoon season rainfall can exceed in a single month. The southern region receives more of the rainfall than the northern. Much of this precipitation occurs as tropical storms. As the high pressure over New Mexico breaks down, rainfall in the Sierra Madre ends. Because of the monsoon, the summer accounts for the majority of rainfall in the area. The spring and fall dry season separate out a weaker wet season in the winter. In addition to increasing in the southern ranges of the mountains, rainfall increases in the higher elevations of the Sierra Madre Occidental.

Humidity in the mountains varies at wide levels as does rainfall. In the early morning before dawn, the air is almost saturated (often over 90% relative humidity) near the mountain tops with low clouds over the range. Lower in the range, air is not as near saturated in the morning. Seasonal variation in humidity is also present with average May and June relative humidity around 50%, with 25% possible during the day. Also during the day, relative humidity drops and cloud levels rise as temperatures rise. The humidity of the range is also influenced by the same seasonal changes as rainfall. In the dry season dew points are low at high elevations (500 hPa), around in the south of the range, and in the north in May. In June, dew points begin to increase from the May levels up to in the north and in the south. By July these dew points are at throughout the range. The range allows higher dew points throughout these periods than the surrounding low lands. This rise in humidity accompanies the monsoon.

==Ecology==

The mountains create a diverse setting for plants and animals by creating a different set of conditions from the surroundings. The Sierra Madre Occidental pine-oak forests are found at elevations of throughout the range, but the forests in the mountains vary by elevation and place in the range. This ecoregion is noted for its high biodiversity and large number of endemic species, and for allowing some species to extend their range.

===Flora===
The dominant plants vary across the range, and the habitat that they present varies from scattered woodland to both deciduous and coniferous forest.

The elevation and latitude in the range are the major determining factors in the dominant plants. Oaks dominate the lower reaches of the mountains, where stands grow down to about . Some oak species even continue into the surrounding ecosystems. In the western slopes of the range, cloud forest also occurs, mostly on mid-elevation slopes with little exposure to wind or sun in the southern end of the range. At higher elevations pines begin to grow alongside the oaks, and pines begin to dominate the oaks at higher elevations. At high elevations and in the north, mixed conifer forests become the dominant ecosystem. These forests are composed primarily of pines and firs, which begin to grow at these elevations. There are also grasslands on some mountain tops, surrounded by the forest that occur in those areas.

Plants in the area typically have large responses to the change in climate with each season. Monsoon season is the largest of these effects, with leaf buds following only a few months after the rains begin. Flowering season occurs in the months preceding the summer monsoon. This is only the peak flowering season, with plants flowering throughout the year. Due to the early flowering, fruit is ripe and seeds are dispersed at the beginning of the rains. There are also areas where plants have little response to the seasons, particularly those areas that experience moist conditions, caused by the elevations. These plants may maintain leaves through times when other areas are in the dry season, during which most deciduous trees have no leaves.

===Fauna===
The mountains are often a corridor for species allowing more diversity in the area, by combining species from different regions. Animals typically associated with arid and mountainous habitats share the mountains with species associated with habitats further south.

There are many carnivorous and omnivorous mammals native to the area, although several are extirpated or are part of threatened populations. The Mexican wolf&#x27;s range in the mountains is limited to the foothills of Durango or the animal may have been extirpated; the black bear population is small, and the Mexican grizzly bear that once resided here is confirmed extinct. Jaguars and ocelots are also now rare. On the other hand, mountain lion and bobcat are more common. On the eastern slopes there are American badger, coyote and gray fox that live across the mountains. Native ungulates include the white tailed deer, mule deer, and collared peccary. Rodents and lagomorphs include the eastern cottontail, which lives in the forests of the western slopes, cliff chipmunk, rock squirrel, Mexican fox squirrel, and various species of Cricetidae. Raccoons, hog-nosed skunk, and hooded skunk live in the mountains. The white-nosed coati lives on the western slopes, and the ring-tailed cat lives throughout. Many species of bats live in the mountains also.

A variety of lizards live in the area and surroundings. The Tarahumara frog lives in the oak and pine stands preferring moving water to pools. The southern extent of the Sonoran mountain kingsnake&#x27;s range is the Chihuahuan desert into the mountains. Other snakes and frogs live in the mountains, and many species live in the western slopes.

Birds frequent the mountains, some as a migratory path and others as native species. The migratory birds often use the area to the west as an overwintering area, and migrate north along the western slopes. In the northern canyons birds may be divided into different habitats, or more specifically, the different types of forest, leading to differences in range by elevation. Some of this difference by elevation may even extend the range of some species, enabling tropical species to use the mountain valleys for migration. Bird species endemic to the Sierra Madre Occidental include tufted jay, the &quot;gray-eared&quot; subspecies of red warbler, eared quetzal, thick-billed parrot, and formerly included the imperial woodpecker, which now may be extinct.

The rivers and streams of the range contain some of the southernmost trout populations in North America. These populations may be native, although this is not universally accepted. Invasive fish compete with the native species which has been a cause of concern among researchers, along with concerns about the effects of logging on these species.

===Surroundings===
The Sonoran Desert is found in the northwestern foothills at . The Chihuahuan Desert is found to the northeast and east, the Meseta Central matorral and Central Mexican matorral to the southeast, and the Sinaloan dry forests to the west and southwest. These lower elevations are usually graded into by a stand of tropical deciduous forest, which has a large portion of flora made up of flowering plants and legumes. These flowering plants are mostly from the genus &quot;Bursera&quot;. The ecotone, made up of the tropical deciduous forest, is commonly sparsely populated, sometimes only by small stands of trees. It may be referred to as savanna.

===Preservation===
Preservation efforts in the modern day include those of Edwin Bustillos. Other groups, including Conservation International, work to protect animal species in the area. Basaseachic Falls National Park is a national park in the mountains containing the highest waterfalls in the country. Cumbres de Majalca National Park was designated in 1939. Additionally, there are reserves such as La Michilía in the southern Sierra Madre, or the Tutuaca reserve in western Chihuahua, which was established in 2000 under a new system of management. Other protected areas in the Sierra include the Bavispe, Campo Verde, Cerro Mohinora, Papigochic, and Sierra de Álamos–Río Cuchujaqui flora and fauna protection areas. The Cuenca Alimentadora del Distrito Nacional de Riego 043 Estado de Nayarit, established in 1949 to protect forests and watersheds, is now a natural resources protection area which conserves much of the southern Sierra.

==People and history==

The mountains are home to several indigenous nations speaking Uto-Aztecan languages, including the Tarahumara in the central portion of the range, the Huichol in the southern part of the range, and the Tepehuanes in the eastern slopes.

===Prehistory===
Archaic cultures are known to have inhabited the Sierra Madre along with the rest of the surrounding lands, but little is known of the culture, although it does vary between the northern and southern extremes of the range. The agrarian Chalchihuites Culture began as farming communities around the first century AD and remained small communities until 300 AD when new agricultural techniques caused a large growth in population until around 500 AD. This culture began to decline in the ninth century. The Mogollon culture has been described in the northern foothills. Sites date the emergence of the culture to around 900 AD, and its abandonment to around 1000–1100 AD. During the period estimated for Mogollon abandonment, the Rio Sonora culture began agricultural developments along the Rio Sonora and rivers flowing into it. This culture produced pottery and lived in pit houses, until 1150 to 1200 when they began to construct surface dwellings. Construction of these houses ended around AD1550.

===Spanish Sierra Madre===
Francisco de Ibarra came to Durango in 1554, and began to settle the area. He would explore the western coast and cross the Sierra Madre in 1564. Early Spanish influence in the area came from the new silver mines, the first of which was established in 1567 at Santa Barbara. As sites opened for mining, missionaries came to the areas and had a strong presence by 1595. The first meeting with the Tarahumara came in 1607, when a missionary went up the valley to meet them. Opposition to the missionaries built up, leading to the Tepehuán Revolt. This revolt began in 1616 in the town of Santa Catarina de Tepehuanes in Durango, and lasted for two years. The discovery of silver at Parral in 1631 led to the northern limit of settlement moving into Tarahumara lands.

The Jesuits renewed missionary activity in the 1630s, with a new program that increased in scope until around 1650. Tarahumara moved further into the mountains in order to escape the conditions. A smallpox epidemic caused a revolt in 1645. A revolt arose in 1648, primarily among the Tarahumara. A drought caused a pair of revolutions in 1650 and 1652. The last major revolt began in March 1690 among the Tarahumara and ended in 1698. Demands from labor drafts increased in the 1720s, placing a new pressure on missions. Criticism of the Jesuits rose in the 1730s with complaints of Jesuit Commerce, which was established by mission stores. In 1767, Jesuits were expelled from New Spain, ending the mission program.

A new colonial official, José de Gálvez, came to New Spain and established new laws that caused a boom in silver mining activity in the 1770s. After the Apache faced heightened resistance to raiding from the Spanish in Chihuahuan, they moved down to the Sierra Madre in 1794. By 1800, raiding had essentially ended.

===Mexican Sierra Madre===
After leaving San Carlos in the fall of 1881, Geronimo and other Apache moved to the mountains, and became known as the &quot;Nednai&quot;, sometimes referred to as the &quot;Pinery Apache&quot; or &quot;Bronco Apache&quot;. From there they raided Sonora and the surrounding land until General George Crook entered the mountains in 1883 to discuss Geronimo&#x27;s return. Geronimo eventually surrendered in 1886. Pancho Villa fled to the mountains in 1894, becoming a bandit.

====19th century====
Railroads came to the area starting in the 1880s and 1890s, which allowed many old mines in the region to reopen at a profit. Since most of the railroads were American, the foreign influence led to unrest among the people living in the mountains, causing the Tomochic rebellion in 1892. In addition to the railroads, canals were constructed in the 1890s in the Yaqui and Mayo river valleys. These canal projects failed, however, owing to the resistance that the natives of the valleys put up against the projects. Loggers began arriving in the mountains in the late 1800s. In response to the new industry, the Tarahumara moved further into the canyons.

====20th century====
The 1910 revolution began in Chihuahua and spread over the mountains throughout the winter of 1910–1911. Silver mines were forced to make payments to the rebels, but were allowed to continue operating. General John J. Pershing began to follow Pancho Villa in 1916 and entered the mountains; however, he received no information from the local population. The raids subsided by 1919, and Villa returned peacefully to the foothills.

In order to construct irrigation projects in the lowlands below the valleys, irrigation projects were never completed in the Sonoran hills; instead, the Yaqui River was dammed in the 1930s. Dams continued to be constructed in the 1940s and 1950s on the Yaqui River and its tributaries with the largest reservoir, behind the Álvaro Obregón Dam completed in 1952. Dams were also constructed on the Mayo river. Because of the dams, soil condition deteriorated, and more work was required to improve soil quality. The mountain range was crossed by the Ferrocarril Chihuahua al Pacifico railroad, completed in 1961. The railroad went up for sale in 1996, but no transaction was ever completed.

<text>Maintenance of way (commonly abbreviated to MOW, also known as &quot;Permanent Way Maintenance&quot; or &quot;PWM&quot; in Britain) refers to the maintenance, construction, and improvement of rail infrastructure, including tracks, ballast, grade, and lineside infrastructure such as signals and signs.

== Track ==
Railroad tracks consist of multiple key components: a track bed, and ballast forming the foundation of the tracks. Then the tracks themselves are place on the ballast, the tracks consist of a railroad tie, fasteners to secure the rails to the ties, such as spikes or clips, rails, which are assembled on a bed of ballast, which is in turn on a track bed that supports it all.

Ballast is a material used to support the ties and rails, and keep them in place. It is also a key part of drainage along railway lines to ensure the integrity of the tracks during rain and other wet weather. Ballast is often a crushed stone. Stones need to be irregularly shaped, in order to increase friction that holds the tracks in place.

Railroad ties can be made of a number of materials: wood, concrete, steel. Wood is one of the older materials used, and is common for its simplicity and usability in most situations, as well as ease of connecting to rails. Concrete ties are desirable on high speed routes, as well as those dealing with unusually heavy trains, such as the Powder River Basin&#x27;s coal trains. In some situations, such as the Gotthard Base Tunnel rails are affixed directly to concrete, eliminating the need for individual ties and the ballast that supports them.

Rails in use today are made of steel, formed into their final shape while still hot. Rails are frequently measured in weight per yard, such as per yard (0.91 m). Through the mid to late 20th century, rails were typically bolted together, this has given way to continuously welded rails that have fewer joints. 

Rails are secured to the ties using a fastener. With wood ties, spikes are commonly used. Concrete ties are unable to use spikes, and use other styles of fasteners, like clips. 

== Track inspection ==
Robust inspections are key to a safe railroad and discovering flaws and wear in tracks early enough that they can be addressed before causing a derailment, or becoming so severe that the work must be done immediately, regardless of whether it is a convenient time to do so. This task is increasingly done using specialized train cars or vehicles that can check tracks for hidden defects, invisible to the human eye, surveying miles of track a day. 

In the past, this task was often done by track workers, assigned sections of track to maintain and repair, and inspect for flaws. In the United States, where a crew could have responsibility for a significant distance, as long as , workers would travel on speeders, a small rail vehicle designed for rail workers to travel along the tracks that could be put on the tracks by hand.

Specialized trains for the sole purpose of inspecting vast stretches of tracks, such as Japan Railways&#x27;s Doctor Yellow, and Network Rail&#x27;s New Measurement Train are increasing part of track-inspection plans. Some of these trains are also capable of inspecting electrification infrastructure.

Britain&#x27;s railway system still makes routine use of visual inspections by workers walking along sections of track. Trained railway staff, &#x27;Patrollers&#x27;, walk along train tracks looking for abnormal conditions, loose bolts, and damage to trackside infrastructure such as fencing. The frequency of patrols varies depending on factors such as track speed, the specific construction of the track and yearly tonnage on a route. When hot weather is forecasted, additional &quot;hot weather patrols&quot; are also implemented; specifically looking for bents or kinks, caused by the rails expanding in the heat.

== Repair and replacement ==

The most fundamental maintenance of way task is the construction, repair, and replacement of the track and its supporting ballast and grade. In the early days of railroading, this task was almost entirely completed by manual labor. Teams of men, &#x27;section crews&#x27;, would be responsible for specific sections of track, each approximately long. Section crews would manually carry out tasks such as replacing worn out track components, clearing ditches and culverts, tamping ballast and removing snow and debris from switches.

For larger scale projects, specialized teams would be brought in to carry out the work. One account, by Joseph Noble, was that one of these crews of 110 men could replace of track in a 10 hour work day. As late as 1924, some track replacement crews were still doing the job entirely by hand, with crews even lifting rails by hand.

As the 20th century progressed, large scale track replacement became an increasingly mechanical task. The Spike puller replaced men manually prying spikes out of ties. A team of men with tie tongs manually removing a tie and inserting a new one replaced by a tie exchanger, manually driving spikes using a Spike maul replaced by a spike driver. The adjustment and packing of ballast by hand using shovels and ballast forks was replaced by a tamping machine and ballast regulator. Railroad cranes took over the task of lifting heavy track components such as ties and rails. Most of this equipment could be operated by a single person, or handful at most, dramatically reducing the workers needed to carry out a project. By the 1970s, a mechanized track-renewal crew was capable of replacing 400 ties on an average day, using as few as 43 men.

The section crew approach to maintenance has disappeared in the United States, with routine track work now carried out by teams of workers trained and equipped to carry out specific tasks like replacement of ties or damaged rails, that are sent around a company&#x27;s rail network. Technology increasing has reduced the number of people needed for the important routine maintenance tasks that section crews needed to do, and in some cases, outright eliminated the job. Workers using brooms and shovels to clear snow and ice from frog of railroad switches, have been replaced by propane switch heaters. The increased use of Continuous welded rail has reduced joints which require attention and maintenance, such as checking for loose bolts on fishplates, which join non-welded rails together on non-welded, joined rails. Ditch digging and clearing can now be handled by workers using backhoes and excavators, or by specialized rail equipment that digs the ditch as it travels along a track.

== Signal systems ==

Beyond the tracks, railways often have expansive, complicated signaling systems, that require constant maintenance to keep working.
The work of railway signal technicians has evolved significantly over the history of rail transport, particularly in the 20th century, as signals advanced from mechanical semaphore signals, to electric color light signals, and in the 21st century, increasingly advanced train protection systems such as European Train Control System, which in more advanced installations, eliminate equipment such as trackside signals and track circuits, relying on location information via GSM-R to keep trains separated. Semaphore signals routinely require maintenance such as oiling and greasing of mechanical linkages that move the signals, refilling and adjusting of oil lamps on the signal, and verifying the semaphore arm&#x27;s ability to move freely, and move into the correct positions. Electric color light signals require replacement of failed bulbs, and checking of electric circuits and relays, and replacement of failed electrical components. Signal maintaining staff would also assist in the care and upkeep of railroad switches, such as removal of debris preventing switches from moving, oil and greasing of motors.

== Electrification systems ==

On rail lines which include electrification by a third rail or an overhead line system, maintenance of way work also includes installing, repairing and replacing these systems.

Overhead line electrification while complex, is a task that with proper planning, done from trains on existing rail lines. British Rail, during the 1960s-1980s, during large scale projects to electrify routes such as the West Coast Main Line and East Coast Main Line, developed trains that could carry out the various tasks, boring foundations for supports, preparing cement, standing up steel support structures and attaching the contact wire, in an assembly line like fashion.

The electrification of an existing route, can involve significant additional work to accommodate the new electrical system, such as changes to or complete demolition and rebuilding of bridges, station canopies and tunnels. Alternatives to enlarging a tunnel, or rebuilding a bridge, can include lowering the track bed, in turn lowering the tracks.

Contact wires have a lifespan of around 20-30 years. Beyond this point, the likelihood of a wire breaking, and falling from the overhead support structure, as well excessive wear on other components that connect the contact wire to the overhead structure. Failure to keep up with this maintenance can lead to catastrophic damage to both the overhead wire system as well as on train equipment, particularly the pantograph, even at relatively low speeds.

Trees and other vegetation pose a hazard to overhead wires: falling tree branches can cause wires to disconnect from the support structure and arcing can occur if vegetation gets too close to wires. This poses significant hazards, from bright light of an arc flash and starting fires, as well as disruptions to railroad operations from tripped circuit breakers and downed wires. The development and consistent following of plans to control vegetation near overhead lines is critical to safe and uninterrupted rail journeys. This typically involves the trimming of branches that have strayed within a predetermined distance of the wires, as well as removal of trees that are simply too close to overhead wires and will always pose an issue.

<text>Panoz is an American manufacturer of luxury sports automobiles founded in 1989 as Panoz Auto Development by Dan Panoz, son of Don Panoz (1935 – 2018). The company has also been extensively involved in professional racing, and designs, engineers and builds its own race cars (including chassis and components). Panoz products have included the Panoz Roadster and AIV Roadster, the Panoz Esperante, and the Panoz Avezzano.

==Panoz and racing==
Since 1997, Panoz cars have competed in racing series around the world. Team Panoz Racing race the Panoz Avezzano in the Pirelli GTS class, and in 2018 won the Manufacturer&#x27;s Championship. In addition to Le Mans series (Now European Le Mans series) wins, an Esperante GTLM won the GT2 class at the 2006 24 Hours of Le Mans and in the same year, won the 2006 12 Hours of Sebring and was on the podium at the endurance season finale, 2006 Petit Le Mans. For the 2007 American Le Mans season, Panoz contracted longtime BMW Motorsport partner Prototype Technology Group to campaign the GTLM in the ALMS and Le Mans. Panoz has also provided IndyCar with the G-Force GF05 and GF09; and the Champ Car World Series with their final race car, the Panoz DP01 which was the final chassis used under ChampCar until the unification 
of the American open wheel series in road racing.

==Panoz Motor Sports Group==
Panoz Motor Sports Group was sold to NASCAR in 2012. The assets of the sale included the American Le Mans Series, Road Atlanta, Sebring International Raceway and Panoz Racing Schools. Mosport International Raceway was sold separately to a Canadian consortium led by Ron Fellows and Carlo Fidani.

Panoz, LLC., is an automotive manufacturer that builds and designs street cars and race cars. Élan Motorsports is a company that builds and designs race cars too. Both these two companies are still owned by the Panoz family.

===American Le Mans Series===

The American Le Mans Series (ALMS) was created by Don Panoz in 1999. Panoz also owned the International Motor Sports Association, the organization that sanctions the ALMS. It held its inaugural event, the 1998 Petit Le Mans as part of the Professional Sportscar Racing series. The ALMS has a partnership with the Automobile Club de l&#x27;Ouest, the organizers of the 24 Hours of Le Mans, to allow teams to compete to the same regulations. In 2012, the ALMS was sold to NASCAR and then in 2014, the series merged with the Rolex Sports Car Series to form United SportsCar Racing.

===Circuits===
The Panoz group previously owned Road Atlanta in Braselton, Georgia, United States as well as previously operated Sebring International Raceway in Sebring, Florida, United States. They also previously owned Mosport International Raceway in Bowmanville, Ontario, Canada but was sold in 2011. The tracks hosted the American Le Mans Series, now the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship, in addition to other top-level auto and motorcycle racing series.

===Élan Motorsport Technologies===

Élan Motorsports is a company that designs and builds race cars from top-level professional racing cars, through to amateur race cars. The company is owned by the Panoz family. Élan acquired other manufacturers, including famous Formula Ford builders Van Diemen and Indy Racing League constructor G-Force Technologies. Élan-built cars have raced in the Indy Racing League, Champ Car World Series, American Le Mans Series, Le Mans Series, and other championships.

===Panoz Racing School and series===

The Panoz Racing School was a driver training school previously operated at Road Atlanta and Sebring International Raceway. Students learned racing techniques in purpose-built Panoz GT-RA cars. Following completion of the course, students were eligible for an SCCA regional racing license. The school also included programs where customers could receive instruction in their own road cars.

The Panoz Racing Series was a one-make series made up of the Panoz School cars, as well as the more powerful Panoz GTS models. The series was designed for amateurs to learn racing in a low-cost environment.

<text>In the mathematical area of knot theory, a Reidemeister move is any of three local moves on a link diagram. and, independently, , demonstrated that two knot diagrams belonging to the same knot, up to planar isotopy, can be related by a sequence of the three Reidemeister moves.

Each move operates on a small region of the diagram and is one of three types:
No other part of the diagram is involved in the picture of a move, and a planar isotopy may distort the picture. The numbering for the types of moves corresponds to how many strands are involved, e.g. a type II move operates on two strands of the diagram.

One important context in which the Reidemeister moves appear is in defining knot invariants. By demonstrating a property of a knot diagram which is not changed when we apply any of the Reidemeister moves, an invariant is defined. Many important invariants can be defined in this way, including the Jones polynomial.

The type I move is the only move that affects the writhe of the diagram. The type III move is the only one which does not change the crossing number of the diagram.

In applications such as the Kirby calculus, in which the desired equivalence class of knot diagrams is not a knot but a framed link, one must replace the type I move with a &quot;modified type I&quot; (type I&#x27;) move composed of two type I moves of opposite sense. The type I&#x27; move affects neither the framing of the link nor the writhe of the overall knot diagram.

 showed that two knot diagrams for the same knot are related by using only type II and III moves if and only if they have the same writhe and winding number. Furthermore, combined work of , , and shows that for every knot type there are a pair of knot diagrams so that every sequence of Reidemeister moves taking one to the other must use all three types of moves. Alexander Coward demonstrated that for link diagrams representing equivalent links, there is a sequence of moves ordered by type: first type I moves, then type II moves, type III, and then type II. The moves before the type III moves increase crossing number while those after decrease crossing number.

 proved the existence of an exponential tower upper bound (depending on crossing number) on the number of Reidemeister moves required to pass between two diagrams of the same link. In detail, let formula_1 be the sum of the crossing numbers of the two diagrams, then the upper bound is formula_2 where the height of the tower of formula_3s (with a single formula_1 at the top) is formula_5.

 proved the existence of a polynomial upper bound (depending on crossing number) on the number of Reidemeister moves required to change a diagram of the unknot to the standard unknot. In detail, for any such diagram with formula_6 crossings, the upper bound is formula_7.

 proved there is also an upper bound, depending on crossing number, on the number of Reidemeister moves required to split a link.

<text>Donald Panoz ( or ; February 13, 1935 – September 11, 2018) was an American entrepreneur who founded two pharmaceutical companies.

== Early life ==

Panoz was an Italian-American. His father, Eugene Panunzio, immigrated to the United States from Avezzano, Italy in the 1900s. Eugene, who shortened his surname from the original &quot;Panunzio&quot; to &quot;Panoz&quot;, was a champion featherweight boxer.

Panoz attended Greenbrier Military School in Lewisburg, West Virginia, where he met Nancy, whom he would later marry. The two served in Japan with the United States Army, then moved to Pittsburgh upon their return to the United States.

== Business career ==
Panoz operated two drug stores in Pittsburgh while studying business at Duquesne University. In 1961, Panoz and Milan Puskar formed Milan Pharmaceuticals (which would later be renamed &quot;Mylan&quot;) in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia. While head of this company, Panoz headed a research group that invented time-release medication through a transdermal patch, known most commonly in today&#x27;s market for its nicotine application.

Panoz left Mylan in 1969 when the company refused to develop the patch, and subsequently moved the family to Ireland where he formed Élan Corporation. This company (now defunct) was an industry leader in drug delivery products and technology, and was the first Irish company to be publicly listed in the U.S. stock market. Panoz gradually reduced his stakes in the company, and it was bought by Perrigo in 2013.

Don and Nancy Panoz founded Château Élan Winery &amp; Resort in Braselton, Georgia, in 1992. At the time of Don&#x27;s death in 2018 the couple still owned the resort, which has since grown to . The Panozes sold a portion of their businesses to three partners in 2004. Similarly in Patterson, California, 35 miles east of San Jose, the Panozes developed Diablo Grande gated community and the Diablo Grande Winery and Resort, which was sold In 2005; and later they founded the St. Andrews Bay Resort and Spa in Scotland. This venue has since been sold and is now managed by Fairmont Hotels and Resorts as the Fairmont St Andrews. These venues feature golf course designs and collaborations from Bruce Devlin, Denis Griffiths, Jack Nicklaus, Gene Sarazen, and Sam Torrance.

== Panoz in motorsports ==
In 1989, Panoz funded an upstart company started by his son Dan, called Panoz Auto Development. Reportedly, the senior Panoz was skeptical at first of his son&#x27;s venture, but later used his position in the business world to bring celebrity motorsport figures such as Mario Andretti on board with the goal of entering a Panoz race car in the 24 Hours of Le Mans race.

Panoz Motorsports was formed in 1997 in Braselton and entered its brand new car, the Panoz Esperante GTR-1, at Le Mans. The team was competitive, finishing ahead of all but two of the major factory teams in its class.

In 1999, Panoz founded the American Le Mans Series with the aim of bringing European-style endurance sports car racing to the Americas.

<text>Edgar McLean Stevenson Jr. (November 14, 1927 – February 15, 1996) was an American actor and comedian. He is best known for his role as Lieutenant Colonel Henry Blake in the television series &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, which earned him a Golden Globe Award in 1974. Stevenson also appeared on a number of television series, notably &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, &quot;The Doris Day Show&quot; and &quot;Match Game.

==Early life and career==

Stevenson was born in Normal, Illinois (coincidentally, a town located in McLean County). He was the great-grandson of William Stevenson (brother of US Vice President Adlai E. Stevenson), making him a second cousin once removed of two-time presidential nominee Adlai E. Stevenson II. He was also the brother of actress Ann Whitney. His father, Edgar, was a cardiologist. Their shared middle name, &quot;McLean&quot;, came from Lottie McLean, Stevenson&#x27;s paternal grandmother.

Stevenson attended Bloomington High School and Lake Forest Academy. After high school, he joined the United States Navy, and served from January 1946 to November 1947 as a hospital corpsman. After his service he attended Northwestern University, where he was a Phi Gamma Delta fraternity brother, and graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in theater arts. 

Afterward, he worked at a radio station, played a clown on a live TV show in Dallas, became an assistant athletic director at Northwestern, and sold medical supplies and insurance. He also worked as a press secretary for his cousin in the presidential elections of 1952 and 1956. He formed the &quot;Young Democrats for Stevenson.&quot;

In 1961, Stevenson&#x27;s cousin invited him to social functions where he met a few business luminaries. He followed his cousin&#x27;s advice to look for a show business career. He auditioned and won a scholarship to the American Musical and Dramatic Academy. He made his professional career debut in &quot;The Music Man&quot; in 1962 and appeared regularly in Warsaw, Indiana, in summer stock productions. Before becoming a star, Stevenson appeared as a contestant on the &quot;Password&quot; television game show in New York City, winning five pieces of luggage. After this he appeared in New York City on stage, and in television commercials. He also performed on Broadway, and began to establish himself as a comedy writer, writing for the American version of &quot;That Was the Week That Was&quot;—in which Alan Alda appeared—and &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot;, performing occasionally on both shows. He was a regular on the 1970 &quot;The Tim Conway Comedy Hour&quot; variety show on CBS. 

During the late &#x27;60s and early &#x27;70s, he appeared in TV commercials for products such as Kellogg&#x27;s, Libby&#x27;s fruit cocktail, Dolly Madison and Winston cigarettes, in which he was shown sprinting around a parking lot of Winston delivery trucks and painting over the product slogan, replacing the &quot;like&quot; in &quot;like a cigarette should&quot; with the grammatically correct &quot;as&quot;.

===&quot;M*A*S*H&quot;===

After guest-starring in &quot;That Girl&quot; with Marlo Thomas, he was cast in &quot;The Doris Day Show&quot; in 1969, playing magazine editor boss Michael Nicholson until 1971. Originally, he auditioned for the role of Hawkeye Pierce in &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, but was persuaded to play Lt. Col. Henry Blake instead. Stevenson found his greatest success in &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;. The series quickly became one of the most popular situation comedies of its time, and was eventually recognized as one of the top sitcoms in television history. He wrote the episode &quot;The Trial of Henry Blake&quot;, and provided the story for another, &quot;The Army-Navy Game&quot;, which earned him an Emmy nomination.

Despite the show&#x27;s success, Stevenson began to resent (as did Wayne Rogers) playing a supporting role to the wisecracking Hawkeye (played by Alan Alda), and asked to be released from his contract during the show&#x27;s third season. The show&#x27;s writers reluctantly penned him an exit in the final episode of the 1974–1975 season (entitled &quot;Abyssinia, Henry&quot;), in which Lt. Colonel Blake was discharged, only to board a plane that was shot down over the Sea of Japan, killing everyone on board—a development added after scripts were distributed so the show&#x27;s actors would display genuine emotion.

In an interview, &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; actress Loretta Swit commented that Stevenson wanted to be the star and felt oppressed as one of an ensemble of eight. She said that before Stevenson left the series he told her, &quot;I know I will not be in anything as good as this show, but I have to leave and be number one.&quot; Although he had played ensemble parts for several years, he stated that the primary reasons for his departure were systemic problems with 20th Century Fox, especially disregard for simple comforts for cast and crew on location, and the more lucrative opportunities presented to him at the time.

Stevenson was replaced in the series by Harry Morgan, a best friend of Stevenson who had guest-starred opposite him in the Season Three premiere episode &quot;The General Flipped at Dawn&quot;. Morgan portrayed Colonel Sherman Potter for the show&#x27;s remaining eight seasons and starred in its short-lived spin-off &quot;AfterMASH&quot;.

===&quot;Match Game&quot;===
Stevenson appeared as a guest panelist for several weeks on &quot;Match Game&quot; in 1973 and 1974, and again in 1978 on the daytime and nighttime weekly syndicated version. In 1981, he became a regular panelist on the daily syndicated version of &quot;Match Game&quot;, staying with the show until its cancellation a year later. He would make occasional appearances on the subsequent &quot;Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour&quot; in 1983 and 1984.

==Later career==
After his departure from &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, Stevenson&#x27;s acting career declined. While occasionally filling in for Johnny Carson as guest host of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, Stevenson&#x27;s first attempt at his own show was an NBC variety show special titled &quot;The McLean Stevenson Show&quot; on November 20, 1975. The program finished 41st in the ratings that week and the planned series was ultimately scuttled. He then starred in a series of sitcoms: &quot;The McLean Stevenson Show&quot; (1976–77), &quot;In the Beginning&quot; (1978), &quot;Hello, Larry&quot; (1979–80) and &quot;Condo&quot; (1983). All four sitcoms were dismissed by audiences, lambasted by critics and all aired while &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; was still in production. Only &quot;Hello Larry&quot; lasted two seasons, all the others were cancelled in their first.

Stevenson guest-starred as Stan Zbornak&#x27;s brother Ted in the hit sitcom &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; in 1987, in addition to guest-starring in shows such as &quot;Square One TV&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; (as part of a cross-over with his series &quot;Hello, Larry&quot;), and &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;. He filled in for Johnny Carson as guest host of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; 58 times, and as a guest on the program in 1982, he brought his daughter Lindsey onto the set when she was just 16 weeks old. During the 1988–89 television season, he returned to a supporting TV role in an ensemble, playing Max Kellerman in the short-lived CBS series adaptation of &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot;.

Stevenson&#x27;s career decline resulted in his becoming a target for industry jokes. Steve Daley wrote in 1985 that he had &quot;worn out his television welcome&quot;, while David Bianculli drafted &quot;The Annual McLean Stevenson Memorial &#x27;I&#x27;m Gonna Quit This Show and Become a Big Star&#x27; Award&quot; early in his career as a critic. Stevenson commented in 1990 that some of the criticism was justified, conceding that leaving &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; was the biggest mistake of his career. &quot;I made the mistake of believing that people were enamored of McLean Stevenson when the person they were enamored of was Henry Blake,&quot; said Stevenson. &quot;So if you go and do &quot;The McLean Stevenson Show&quot;, nobody cares about McLean Stevenson.&quot; Stevenson admitted that his problem was finding something of the caliber of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, saying &quot;I&#x27;ve never been able to work with a group that&#x27;s as talented or scripts that are as good. I did some terrible shows. But nobody made me do it. I did everything by choice.&quot;

Stevenson&#x27;s screen credits include the Disney movie &quot;The Cat from Outer Space&quot; as a friend of Frank Wilson (played by Ken Berry) along with his &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; replacement Harry Morgan. He also was a co-host of the syndicated daytime talk show &quot;America&quot;, which lasted 16 weeks between September 16, 1985, and January 3, 1986.

==Death==
Stevenson was recovering from bladder cancer surgery at the Encino-Tarzana Regional Medical Center on February 15, 1996, when he suffered a sudden fatal heart attack. He was cremated and his ashes are interred in Forest Lawn - Hollywood Hills Cemetery in Los Angeles.

By coincidence, Roger Bowen, who portrayed Henry Blake in the 1970 movie &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, died of a heart attack the day after Stevenson&#x27;s death.

<text>Leila Shahid (born in Beirut in 1949) is a Palestinian diplomat. She was the first woman ambassador of Palestine, serving the PLO in Ireland in 1989, in The Netherlands in 1990, then serving the PA in France where she had taken office in Paris in 1993. From 2006 to 2014, she was the General Delegate of Palestine to the EU, Belgium and Luxembourg.

She is the daughter of Munib Shahid and Serene Husseini Shahid and thus related to the Al-Husayni clan. Shahid&#x27;s parents were from Acre and Jerusalem, but she grew up with her two sisters in exile in Lebanon. After studying anthropology and psychology at the American University of Beirut, Leila worked in the Palestinian refugee camps until 1974 when she began her doctorate in anthropology in Paris, where she met Jean Genet. In 1976 she was elected president of the Union of Palestinian students in France.

In September 1982, Shahid and Jean Genet went to Beirut. They arrived during the Sabra and Shatila massacres. Genet&#x27;s account was published in &quot;La revue d&#x27;études palestiniennes&quot;, in an article entitled Quatre heures à Chatila (Four Hours at Chatila) -- Catherine Biscovitch&#x27;s film &quot;Dancing Among the Dead&quot; was based on this article by Genet. While working as the Ambassador of Palestine to France, Shahid arranged for the safe storage of artefacts in that had been discovered during archaeological investigations in Gaza at sites such as Tell es-Sakan; they had been on display at the Institut du Monde Arabe for an exhibition on Gaza&#x27;s history but could not be returned after the end of the exhibition due to the start of the Second Intifada.

In 2004, she was with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat during his final days.

She was a longtime director of &quot;La revue d&#x27;études palestiniennes&quot; (The Review of Palestinian Studies), while serving as a board member right now.

The Russell Tribunal on Palestine was established in response to a call by Leila Shahid and Ken Coates (Chairperson of the Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation), Nurit Peled (Israeli, Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Speech 2001).

Though not a follower of the Baháʼí Faith, she is the great-great granddaughter of the Baháʼí prophet Baha&#x27;u&#x27;llah through her father, who was a grandson of Abdu&#x27;l-Baha. Her father was excommunicated from the Baháʼí Faith for opposition to Shoghi Effendi.

<text>&quot;This Is My Song&quot; is a song written by Charlie Chaplin in 1966, and performed by Petula Clark.

==Origin and Petula Clark recording==
&quot;This is My Song&quot; was intended for the film &quot;A Countess from Hong Kong&quot;, which Charlie Chaplin wrote and directed. Chaplin saw his film as a throwback to the shipboard romances that were popular in the 1930s, and wrote &quot;This Is My Song&quot; with the intent of evoking that era. To reinforce the evocation, Chaplin was determined to have Al Jolson sing the song—so determined that he only accepted the information that Jolson had died on 23 October 1950 when shown a photograph of Jolson&#x27;s tombstone. Ultimately, the song would be featured in the film only as an instrumental.
After being disillusioned with regard to Jolson, Chaplin considered having &quot;This Is My Song&quot; recorded by Petula Clark, who had a home in Switzerland near his residence. Clark&#x27;s husband and manager Claude Wolff—who at the time was with Clark in Reno, Nevada—received a copy of &quot;This Is My Song&quot; in September 1966, and liked the song which Clark felt had special potential for success in France. However, Clark&#x27;s regular collaborator Tony Hatch was not impressed with the song, and refused Wolff&#x27;s invitation to arrange it for Clark to record. French label Vogue Records then commissioned a then successful French arranger Jacques Denjean whose work was judged unsuitable by Wolff. Ultimately, Vogue&#x27;s U.S. distributor Warner Bros. records sent Ernie Freeman who flew to Reno to prepare for the song&#x27;s recording session which was to be produced by Sonny Burke at Western Studios in Los Angeles. Clark recorded the song not only in English, but in French as &quot;C&#x27;est Ma Chanson&quot; (lyrics by Pierre Delanoë, who also felt the song a poor choice for Clark), German as &quot;Love, So Heisst Mein Song&quot; (lyrics by Joachim Relin) and Italian as &quot;Cara Felicità&quot; (lyrics by Ciro Bertini). Clark did not even wish to record the song in English, because she disliked the deliberately old-fashioned lyrics, which Chaplin refused to modify; however, after the translated versions of the song had been recorded, some time remained on the session, and Burke coaxed Clark to use this to record Chaplin&#x27;s lyrics. The recording session featured the backing of the Wrecking Crew.

==UK hit==
Clark had assumed her recording of &quot;This Is My Song&quot; with the original quaint Chaplin lyrics would only be used as an album track; on learning of Pye Records&#x27; plan to release the track as a single she attempted to block its release. Instead, she found herself atop the UK Singles Chart for the first time in six years when &quot;This Is My Song&quot; reached no. 1 on the chart dated 16 February 1967, a position it retained the next week. Certified Silver for sales of 250,000, the total sales of &quot;This Is My Song&quot; in the UK would exceed 500,000.

The breakout of &quot;This Is My Song&quot; in the UK in February 1967 caused Pye Records to withdraw Clark&#x27;s current album release &quot;Colour My World&quot;, which was rush re-released with &quot;This Is My Song&quot; added on to reach no. 16 on the charts. &quot;This Is My Song&quot; was also included on Clark&#x27;s next album: &quot;These Are My Songs&quot;, which reached no. 38 UK later that year.

&quot;This is My Song&quot; (in English) is one of four Petula Clark hits for which she has expressed dislike, the others being: &quot;Sailor&quot;, another UK no. 1 hit; &quot;Monsieur&quot;, a German language no. 1 hit which won a gold disc for sales in Germany alone ; and &quot;My Love&quot;.

==International success==
Petula Clark&#x27;s &quot;This Is My Song&quot; was no. 1 for three weeks in Ireland and six weeks in Australia; it also topped the charts in Rhodesia and South Africa, and reached the top of the Dutch charts for both the Netherlands and Belgium. &quot;This Is My Song&quot; also earned hit status in Finland (#8), India (#5), Malaysia (#1), New Zealand (#15), Norway (#6), Singapore (#1), Spain (#8), Thailand (#9) and Venezuela (#5).

The North American single release omitted the opening lyrical section, following the instrumental introduction, owing to the length of the song. &quot;This Is My Song&quot; reached #3 in the U.S. and #4 in Canada. The &quot;These Are My Songs&quot; album peaked at #27 in the U.S., becoming Clark&#x27;s second—and final—US Top 30 album (&quot;Downtown&quot; at #21 would remain Clark&#x27;s top-ranking U.S. album).

&quot;C&#x27;est Ma Chanson&quot; reached #1 in France and #3 on the chart for Belgium&#x27;s French-speaking sector, also reaching #10 on Belgium&#x27;s Dutch chart where the English version had hit #1; total sales of the French-language version were reported as 350,000 by 8 April 1967. In Germany, the English version competed with the German-language version with the former more successful, reaching #16 while &quot;Love, So Heisst Mein Song&quot; peaked at #23. In Italy, the rendering &quot;Cara Felicità&quot; reached #23. In United Kingdom sales have reached 500,000 mark, while in Belgium 70,000. Sales in Belgium and France by 22 April 1967 have reached 500,000 total sales. &quot;This Is Not My Song&quot; sold 700,000 copies in France in five months while French version sold 350,000.

==Aftermath==
Although Clark had become a fixture on the upper realms of the U.S. charts through her collaboration with writer/producer Tony Hatch on &quot;Downtown&quot;, her UK singles chart success had been more hit-and-miss. The two singles before &quot;This Is My Song&quot;, &quot;Who Am I?&quot; and &quot;Colour My World&quot;, had failed to reach the UK Top 50. This made the strong UK showing of &quot;This Is My Song&quot;—Clark&#x27;s first single release since &quot;Downtown&quot; to be neither written nor produced by Hatch—the more remarkable.

The follow-up single &quot;Don&#x27;t Sleep in the Subway&quot; resumed the Clark/Hatch collaboration and was a UK hit (#12) but, like all Clark&#x27;s releases after &quot;This Is My Song&quot;, would fail to return her to the UK Top Ten.

Despite Clark&#x27;s reservations about the English version of &quot;This is My Song&quot;:
* the song&#x27;s popularity mandates its inclusion in any concert Clark gives in the English-speaking world; Clark generally performs the song combining French lyrics with the English.
* the one published biography of Clark written to date (by Andrea Kon in 1983) is titled &quot;This Is My Song&quot; (W.H. Allen &amp; Co. Ltd.).

==Other versions==
The first recording of &quot;This Is My Song&quot; was made by Harry Secombe, with Angela Morley responsible for arranging and conducting. Secombe himself found the lyrics risible; several takes were necessitated due to his bursting into laughter when he tried to sing the line: &quot;I care not what the world may say&quot;. Despite the eventual UK release of Clark&#x27;s version as a single, &quot;This Is My Song&quot;&#x27;s appeal was strong enough to sustain two versions high on the chart. Secombe&#x27;s version debuted at number 44 on 25 February 1967 (the second week Clark&#x27;s version was number one) to rise as high as number two on the chart dated 1 April (which featured Clark&#x27;s version at number eight). (Clark&#x27;s previous UK #1 song, &quot;Sailor&quot;, had also had a rival version, in that instance by Anne Shelton, which had reached the Top 10. Angela Morley, who&#x27;d regularly produced Clark for the Polygon label in the early 1950s, had also overseen the Shelton recording.) Secombe&#x27;s version of &quot;This Is My Song&quot; was included on the album &quot;Secombe&#x27;s Personal Choice&quot;, an April 1967 release whose chart peak of #6 in May 1967 bests that of both the Petula Clark albums which parented the song. Besides selling over 300,000 units in the UK, Secombe&#x27;s version of &quot;This Is My Song&quot; also became a hit in Australia (#6), Ireland (#13) and South Africa (#15).

Versions of &quot;This Is My Song&quot; have been recorded by Ronnie Aldrich, The Ray Charles Singers, Ray Conniff and the Singers (from the &quot;This Is My Song&quot; album/ 1967), Dada, James Darren, Percy Faith, Connie Francis (live version), Bobby Hendricks, Engelbert Humperdinck (whose &quot;Release Me&quot; succeeded Clark&#x27;s version of &quot;This Is My Song&quot; at #1 UK and kept Secombe&#x27;s version at #2), Morgana King, James Last, the Lennon Sisters, the Lettermen, the Patrick Linder and Thilo Wolf Big Band, Mantovani, Lena Martell, Al Martino, Paul Mauriat, Jane McDonald, Jim Nabors, Frank Sinatra, Jerry Vale, Bobby Vinton, Andy Williams, Taiwanese singer Tracy Huang (1980 with EMI) and Hong Kong artists, Nancy Sit (1967 with Crane Brand Records), Judy Jim 詹小屏 (1969 with EMI Columbia Graphophone Company) &amp; The Chopsticks (Sandra &amp; Amina) (1970 with Crown Records).

The Seekers also recorded a version of &quot;This Is My Song&quot; in 1967; however, the track was unreleased until 1995 when it was included on &quot;The Seekers - Complete&quot; box set. On the Seekers&#x27; &quot;Night of Nights...Live!&quot; release from 2002, &quot;This Is My Song&quot; follows &quot;Ten Thousand Years Ago&quot; - which only features the group&#x27;s male members - to showcase Judith Durham as a solo vocalist.

Foreign language covers of &quot;This Is My Song&quot; contemporary with the Petula Clark hit version include: the Croatian rendering &quot;Moja pjesma&quot; recorded by Tereza Kesovija in 1968; the Czech rendering &quot;Obrať Se S Důvěrou&quot; recorded by Helena Blehárová (cs); the Dutch rendering &quot;Sjungas till sömns&quot; recorded by Lize Marke to chart in Belgium (Flemish Region) at No. 26 (as a double A-side hit with &quot;Lara&#x27;s lied&quot;); another Dutch rendering: &quot;Daar Straalt Eeen Licht&quot;, recorded by the Netherlands-based group the Shephards; the French version titled &quot;C&#x27;est ma chanson&quot; by Les Compagnons de la chanson, which reached No. 43 on the Belgian chart in 1967; the Polish rendering &quot;Moja Piosenka&quot; recorded by Halina Kunicka (pl); and the Serbian rendering &quot;Ljubav Je To&quot; recorded by Senka Veletanlić. 1967 also saw at least thirteen recordings of renderings of &quot;This Is My Song&quot; made by artists local to Scandinavia (Denmark/ Finland/ Norway/ Sweden) beginning with the Swedish &quot;En serenad till dig&quot; introduced by Ann-Louise Hanson and also recorded by Gunnar Wiklund: other Scandinavian renderings included the Danish &quot;Min sang till dig&quot; recorded by both Gitte and Katy Bødtger and the Finnish &quot;Tämä on lauluni&quot; recorded by Matti Heinivaho (fi). Contemporary covers of &quot;C&#x27;est ma chanson&quot; include those by Lucky Blondo (fr) and Mireille Mathieu while &quot;Cara Felicità&quot; was recorded by 15 Italian singers in 1967. In Spain &quot;Amor es mi cancion&quot; had been recorded by Juan Bau, Dova, Gelu (es) and Los Javaloyas. Angelika Milster (de) remade &quot;Love, So Heisst Mein Song&quot; for her 1998 album &quot;&quot;Die größten Hits der Filmgeschichte&quot; as did Margot Eskens for a 2006 single release. Taiwanese singer Dai-Lin Chuang 黛玲 recorded a Chinese Mandarin version as 聽我歌唱 (Ting Wo Ge Chang) with EMI Pathe Records in 1967.

<doc id="1152400" wikidata="Q144040" url="?curid=1152400" title="Sierra Madre Oriental">
<text>The Sierra Madre Oriental () is a mountain range in northeastern Mexico. The Sierra Madre Oriental is part of the American Cordillera, a chain of mountain ranges (cordillera) that consists of an almost continuous sequence of mountain ranges that form the western &quot;backbone&quot; of North America, Central America, South America, and Antarctica.

==Setting==
Spanning the Sierra Madre Oriental runs from the Rio Grande on the border between Coahuila and Texas south through Nuevo León, southwest Tamaulipas, San Luis Potosí, Querétaro, and Hidalgo to northern Puebla, where it joins with the east-west running Eje Volcánico Transversal of central Mexico. The northernmost are the Sierra del Burro and the Sierra del Carmen which reach the border with the United States at the Rio Grande. North of the Rio Grande, the range continues northwestward into Texas and beyond as the Davis and Guadalupe Ranges.
Mexico&#x27;s Gulf Coastal Plain lies to the east of the range, between the mountains and the Gulf of Mexico coast. The Mexican Plateau, which averages in elevation, lies between the Sierra Madre Oriental and the Sierra Madre Occidental further west.

The climate of the Sierra Madre Oriental is drier than the rainforest areas further south. The Serranias del Burro in the northern range is much drier, semi-arid to arid, yet annually orographically induces and/or intensifies notably vigorous thunderstorm activity in April and May. This small region consistently is a particularly active area for supercells with significantly severe hail and tornadoes, which first form over to just leeward of the mountains then move eastward, sometimes hundreds of kilometres (miles) past the Rio Grande River into Texas.
==Highest major summits==
Cerro El Potosí, at above sea level (ASL), is the highest point of the Sierra Madre Oriental and the state of Nuevo León

==Ecology==
This long range of tall mountains is noted for its abundant biodiversity and large number of endemic species of plants and wildlife, from the dry north to the wetter south. The Sierra Madre Oriental pine-oak forests are found at high elevations in the range ( above sea level). To the east, the Tamaulipan matorral occupies the range&#x27;s lower slopes in Nuevo León and northern Tamaulipas, while the Veracruz moist forests cover the lower slopes of the central range, and the eastern slopes at the southern end of the range are home to the Veracruz montane forests. West of the range, the Mexican Plateau is home to deserts and xeric shrublands, including the Chihuahuan Desert to the north, the Meseta Central matorral on the central part of the plateau, and the Central Mexican matorral on the southern plateau.

Much of the wildlife can also be found in the Sierra Madre Occidental, which runs parallel to these mountains along western Mexico.

===Flora===
Pine-oak forests are dominated by several species of pine, such as &quot;Pinus nelsonii&quot;, &quot;P. cembroides&quot;, &quot;P. pseudostrobus&quot;, and &quot;P. arizonica&quot;, and oak, such as &quot;Quercus castanea&quot; and &quot;Q. affinis&quot;. Matorral is characterized by woody shrubs, small trees, cacti, and succulents. Montane chaparral is found above and is home to species in the genera &quot;Quercus&quot;, &quot;Arbutus&quot;, &quot;Yucca&quot;, &quot;Cercocarpus&quot; and &quot;Bauhinia&quot;. Piedmont scrub occurs below and is composed of plants in height such as &quot;Helietta parvifolia&quot;, &quot;Neopringlea integrifolia&quot; and &quot;Acacia&quot; spp. The canopy of moist forests is dominated by trees up to in height, including &quot;Brosimum alicastrum&quot;, &quot;Manilkara zapota&quot;, &quot;Celtis monoica&quot;, &quot;Bursera simaruba&quot;, &quot;Dendropanax arboreus&quot;, and &quot;Sideroxylon capiri&quot;.

===Fauna===

Birds of the forest include the Mexican chickadee, Montezuma quail, Strickland&#x27;s woodpecker, zone-tailed hawk and several species of jay.

Pine-oak forests in Coahuila are part of the migration route of monarch butterflies (&quot;Danaus plexippus&quot;).

===Threats and conservation===
Original habitats have been severely reduced by clearance for livestock grazing and logging over hundreds of years. Protected areas include the Cumbres de Monterrey National Park in Mexico and the Big Bend National Park in Texas. The El Cielo Biosphere in Tamaulipas preserves the northernmost tropical Veracruz moist forests in Mexico and extensive temperate cloud forests.

<text>Until August 2005, Britain in Europe was the main British pro-European pressure group. Despite connections to Labour and the Liberal Democrats, it was a cross-party organisation with supporters from many different political backgrounds. Initially founded to campaign for a “Yes” vote for the euro, it then progressed to support a “Yes” vote for the referendum on the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe.

The organisation was launched in 1999 by Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, Kenneth Clarke, Michael Heseltine and Charles Kennedy. In 2003, the organisation formally linked itself with the Brussels-based, pro-European, international organisation European Movement.

The director of Britain in Europe was Simon Buckby and later Lucy Powell. The director of communications was the Scottish Liberal Democrat politician Danny Alexander.

On 17 August 2005, the group was wound up following the French and Dutch &quot;No&quot; votes on the proposed European Constitution. Its resources were turned over to the European Movement.

A successor pro-EU campaign, founded in 2012, is British Influence.

<doc id="1152416" wikidata="Q1077315" url="?curid=1152416" title="Antitrust (film)">
<text>Antitrust (also titled Conspiracy.com and Startup) is a 2001 American techno-thriller film written by Howard Franklin and directed by Peter Howitt.

&quot;Antitrust&quot; portrays young idealistic programmers and a large corporation (NURV) that offers a significant salary, an informal working environment, and creative opportunities for those talented individuals willing to work for them. The charismatic CEO of NURV (Tim Robbins) seems to be good-natured, but new employee and protagonist Milo Hoffman (Ryan Phillippe) begins to unravel the terrible hidden truth of NURV&#x27;s operation.

The film stars Phillippe, Rachael Leigh Cook, Claire Forlani, and Robbins. &quot;Antitrust&quot; opened in the United States on January 12, 2001, and was generally panned by critics and box office failure.

==Plot==
Working with his three friends at their new software development company Skullbocks, Stanford graduate Milo Hoffman is recruited by Gary Winston, the CEO of the software corporation NURV. Milo is offered an attractive programming position with a large paycheck, an almost-unrestrained working environment, and extensive creative control over his work. After accepting, Hoffman and his girlfriend, Alice Poulson (Forlani), move to NURV headquarters in Portland, Oregon.

Despite development of the flagship product (Synapse, a worldwide media distribution network) being well on schedule, Hoffman soon becomes suspicious of the excellent source code that Winston personally provides to him, seemingly when needed most, while refusing to divulge the code&#x27;s origin.

After his best friend and fellow computer programmer, Teddy Chin, is murdered, Hoffman discovers that NURV is stealing the code they need from programmers around the world—including Chin—and then killing them. NURV not only employs an extensive surveillance system to observe and steal code, the company has infiltrated the Justice Department and most mainstream media. Even Hoffman&#x27;s girlfriend is a plant, an ex-con hired by the company to spy on and manipulate him.

In a secret NURV database of employee surveillance dossiers, Hoffman discovers highly-sensitive personal information about Lisa Calighan (Cook), a friendly co-worker. When he says he knows the company has this information about her, she agrees to help him expose NURV&#x27;s crimes. Coordinating with Brian Bissel, Hoffman&#x27;s old start-up friend, they plan to use a local public-access television station to hijack Synapse and globally broadcast their charges against NURV. However, Calighan is actually Winston&#x27;s accomplice and foils Hoffman.

When the plan fails, and as Winston prepares to kill Hoffman, a backup plan is put into motion. Off-screen, Hoffman had previously confronted and convinced Poulson to turn against NURV; she, the fourth member of Skullbocks, and NURV&#x27;s incorruptible security contractors usurp one of NURV&#x27;s own work centers—&quot;Building 21&quot;—and transmit incriminating evidence with the Synapse code. Calighan, Winston, and his entourage are arrested by the FBI for their crimes. After amicably parting ways with the redeemed Poulson, Hoffman rejoins Skullbocks.

==Cast==
==Allusions==

Roger Ebert found Gary Winston to be a thinly disguised pastiche of entrepreneur Bill Gates; so much so that he was &quot;surprised [the writers] didn&#x27;t protect against libel by having the villain wear a name tag saying, &#x27;Hi! I&#x27;m not Bill! Similarly, Ebert felt NURV &quot;seems a whole lot like Microsoft&quot;. Parallels between the fictional and real-world software giants were also drawn by Lisa Bowman of ZDNet UK, James Berardinelli of ReelViews, and Rita Kempley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. Microsoft spokesman Jim Cullinan said, &quot;From the trailers, we couldn&#x27;t tell if the movie was about or Oracle.&quot;

==Production==
Principal photography for &quot;Antitrust&quot; took place in Vancouver, British Columbia, California, and Portland, Oregon.

Stanley Park in Vancouver served as the grounds for Gary Winston&#x27;s house, although the gate house at its entrance was faux. The exterior of Winston&#x27;s house itself was wholly computer-generated; only the paved walkway and body of water in the background are physically present in the park. For later shots of Winston and Hoffman walking along a beach near the house, the CG house was placed in the background of Bowen Island, the shooting location. Catherine Hardwicke designed the interior sets for Winston&#x27;s house, which featured several different units, or &quot;pods&quot;, e.g., personal, work, and recreation units. No scenes take place in any of the personal areas, however; only public areas made it to the screen. While the digital paintings in Winston&#x27;s home were created with green screen technology, the concept was based on technology that was already available in the real world. The characters even refer to Bill Gates&#x27; house which, in real life, had such art. The paintings which appeared for Hoffman were of a cartoon character, &quot;Alien Kitty&quot;, developed by Floyd Hughes specifically for the film.
Simon Fraser University&#x27;s Burnaby campus stood in for external shots of NURV headquarters.
The Chan Centre for the Performing Arts at the University of British Columbia (UBC) was used for several internal locations. The centre&#x27;s foyer area became the NURV canteen; the set decoration for which was inspired by Apple&#x27;s canteen, which the producers saw during a visit to their corporate headquarters. The inside of the Chan—used for concerts—served as the shape for &quot;The Egg&quot;, or &quot;The NURV Center&quot;, where Hoffman&#x27;s cubicle is located. Described as &quot;a big surfboard freak&quot; by director Peter Howitt, production designer Catherine Hardwicke surrounded &quot;The Egg&quot; set with surfboards mounted to the walls; Howitt has said, &quot;The idea was to make NURV a very cool looking place.&quot; Both sets for NURV&#x27;s Building 21 were also on UBC&#x27;s campus. The internal set was an art gallery on campus, while the exterior was built for the film on the university&#x27;s grounds. According to Howitt, UBC students kept attempting to steal the Building 21 set pieces.

Hoffman and Poulson&#x27;s new home—a real house in Vancouver—was a &quot;very tight&quot; shooting location and a very rigorous first week for shooting because, as opposed to a set, the crew could not move the walls. The painting in the living room is the product of a young Vancouver artist, and was purchased by Howitt as his first piece of art.

The new Skullbocks office was a real loft, also in Vancouver, on Beatty Street.

===Open source===
&quot;Antitrust&quot;″s pro–open source story excited industry leaders and professionals, with the prospects of expanding the public&#x27;s awareness and knowledge level of the availability of open-source software. The film heavily features Linux and its community, using screenshots of the Gnome desktop, consulting Linux professionals, and including cameos by Miguel de Icaza and Scott McNealy (the latter appearing in the film&#x27;s trailers). Jon Hall, executive director of Linux International and consultant on the film, said &quot;[&quot;Antitrust&quot;] is a way of bringing the concept of open source and the fact that there is an alternative to the general public, who often don&#x27;t even know that there is one.&quot;

Despite the film&#x27;s message about open source computing, MGM did not follow through with their marketing: the official website for &quot;Antitrust&quot; featured some videotaped interviews which were only available in Apple&#x27;s proprietary QuickTime format.

==Reception==
Antitrust received mainly negative reviews, and has a &quot;Rotten&quot; consensus of 24% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 106 reviews, with an average score of 4 out of 10. The summary states &quot;Due to its use of clichéd and ludicrous plot devices, this thriller is more predictable than suspenseful. Also, the acting is bad.&quot; The film also has a score of 31 out 100, based on 29 reviews, on Metacritic. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;B+&quot; on scale of A to F.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film two stars out of four. Linux.com appreciated the film&#x27;s open-source message, but felt the film overall was lackluster, saying &quot;AntiTrust&quot;″ is probably worth a $7.50 ticket on a night when you&#x27;ve got nothing else planned.&quot;

James Keith La Croix of Detroit&#x27;s &quot;Metro Times&quot; gave the film four stars, impressed that &quot;&quot;Antitrust&quot; is a thriller that actually thrills.&quot;

The film won both the Golden Goblet for Best Feature Film, and Best Director for Howitt, at the 2001 Shanghai International Film Festival.

==Home media==
&quot;Antitrust&quot; was released as a &quot;Special Edition&quot; DVD on May 15, 2001, and on VHS on December 26, 2001. The DVD features audio commentary by the director and editor, an exclusive documentary, deleted scenes and alternative opening and closing sequences with director&#x27;s commentary, Everclear&#x27;s music video for &quot;When It All Goes Wrong Again&quot; (which is played over the beginning of the closing credits), and the original theatrical trailer. The DVD was re-released August 1, 2006. It was released on Blu-ray Disc on September 22, 2015.

<doc id="1152427" wikidata="Q80767" url="?curid=1152427" title="European Rowing Championships">
<text>The European Rowing Championships is an international rowing regatta organised by FISA (the International Rowing Federation) for European rowing nations, plus Israel, which, though not a member of the European federation, is treated as a European nation for competition purposes.

The championships date back to 1893, the year after FISA was founded. Over time, the competition grew in status and as it was not restricted to European countries, became regarded as the quasi-world championships. The World Rowing Championships were commenced in 1962 and the last European Championships were held in 1973 as from 1974, the World Championships became an annual event. The European Championships were re-introduced in 2007 but with a narrower focus on Europe.

==History==

The first regatta held as a European Rowing Championships was held in 1893 and these continued annually until 1913; the 1914 to 1919 events did not occur due to World War I. The annual schedule was next interrupted in 1928 when the Amsterdam Olympics were regarded as a replacement event; the 1920 Antwerp Olympics or the 1924 Paris Olympics had previously not been a reason for skipping the European Championships. The next time the Olympics were held in Europe, i.e. the 1936 Berlin Olympics, again saw the European Championships skipped. World War II saw the 1939 to 1946 regattas cancelled. The next European event was held in 1947, with subsequent years skipped due to Europe-based Olympics in 1948 (London) and 1952 (Helsinki).

The 1951 European Rowing Championships is notable as the first test event for international women&#x27;s rowing organised by the International Rowing Federation (FISA). Regattas continued under that name until 1973. From 1962, the event was replaced (one year in four) by the World Rowing Championships, which then became an annual event from 1974. Women&#x27;s events were introduced in 1954, the first international races for women, but even then men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s events were held on different days, and in some years at different venues.

On 27 May 2006 the FISA members voted to re-introduce a separate European Rowing Championships in its own right.

In the first regatta there were only three events (men&#x27;s single, coxed four and eight) and only ten entries. Races were 3,000 m long, except for singles – which were only 2,000 m. Coxed pair was first raced in the following year and double scull was added in 1898. Coxless pair was added in 1924 and coxless four was added the year after. The next change after that was the inclusion of women&#x27;s rowing.

In 2007, when the European Rowing Championship was re-introduced, there were 14 Olympic boat classes racing over 2,000m. Historically the leading European nations, notably Great Britain and Germany, had taken a haphazard approach to attending the championships. Following the 2012 Summer Olympics, however, both fully committed to the event going forward, and from that date, the championships have progressed rapidly to represent one of the key events in world rowing; given the historic and modern strength of European rowing, they rank behind only the Olympic Games, World Championships and World Cup Series. In Olympic years, when World Championships are not held, they provide a key test ahead of the Olympic regatta, in addition to a significant competitive opportunity in their own right.

In 2015, European Rowing announced that the 2018 edition of the championships would form part of the first European Championships, a co-branded multi-sport event organised by, and consisting of the European championships of, the individual European sports federations.

==Editions==
The first regatta held as a European Rowing Championships was held in 1893. 

Para events added to games since 2020.

== All-time medal table ==
Total of medals from 1893 to 2024. Alsace-Lorraine won one gold, three silvers and nine bronzes which are added to Germany&#x27;s total medals.

<text>Mustapha Hadji (; born 16 November 1971) is a Moroccan football coach and former player. He was named the 50th greatest African player of all time by the African football expert Ed Dove.

==Early life==
Hadji was born in Ifrane Atlas-Saghir, Morocco. He emigrated with his family to France at the age of ten. He holds Moroccan and French nationalities.

==Club career==
Hadji began playing in France. He signed his first contract with Nancy, where he spent his first season as a youth player before joining the senior squad in his second year with the club.

After playing five seasons for Nancy, Hadji joined Sporting Lisbon and then Deportivo la Coruña, but it was with Coventry City where he became well known, especially in Britain, after he was signed by Gordon Strachan in 1999.

Hadji was a goal-scoring attacking midfielder with great pace and skill. At Coventry, he was joined by Moroccan international, Youssef Chippo, sparking a brief trend for City fans to wear fezzes to games in their honour. After Coventry were relegated in 2001, he joined local rivals Aston Villa, having scored against them three times in the previous season. But after only playing sporadically, scoring in the league against Southampton and Everton and once in the UEFA Cup against Varteks, he was released on a free transfer to Espanyol in Spain where he remained until June 2004.

Hadji later played for Al Ain in the United Arab Emirates, where he remained for one year before returning to Europe. In 2005, he signed a two-year contract with Saarbrücken in the 2. Bundesliga. At the request of the coach Horst Ehrmantraut, Hadji made a midfield pairing with another Moroccan international, Faysal El Idrissi. On 4 August 2005, Hadji made his début for Saarbrücken, on the first day of the 2. Bundesliga season, against Bochum, losing the match 4–0. After another defeat, Ehrmantraut was sacked. Rudi Bommer took over as coach and Saarbrücken lost 2–1 after extra time in the second round of the DFB-Pokal against Unterhaching. Hadji scored to give his team the lead, but was sent off in the 85th minute and was suspended for three cup matches by the German Football Association.

In August 2007, Hadji signed for Fola Esch, in Luxembourg&#x27;s First Division. He ended his playing career in July 2010.

==International career==
At the 1994 FIFA World Cup, Hadji played in all three group games for Morocco, two as substitute. In Morocco&#x27;s third game against the Netherlands, Hadji set up the equalizer for Hassan Nader with his first touch after coming on as substitute. Despite this, Morocco lost all three games and were eliminated. Hadji scored a great goal in Morocco&#x27;s 2–2 draw with Norway in the 1998 FIFA World Cup but Morocco again failed to qualify for the knock-out stages. He was named African Footballer of the Year after the World Cup in France.

He played in 13 FIFA World Cup qualification matches.

==Other projects==
Hadji was selected as an ambassador for the 2010 World Cup by FIFA to represent Africa. He is also involved in a partnership with plans to invest in Morocco, thus providing opportunities for the local people, to help rid poverty from his homeland.

Hadji is also a supporter of the charity Show Racism The Red Card.

He would have been ambassador for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, representing his country if Morocco had been selected as the host.

==Coaching career==

===Umm Salal===

<text>William Gerald Douglas (17 April 1934 – 18 June 1991) was a Scottish film director best known for the trilogy of films about his early life.

==Biography==
Born in Newcraighall, a mining village on the outskirts of Edinburgh. He was brought up initially by his maternal grandmother, Jean Beveridge; following her death, he lived with his father and paternal grandmother. He undertook his National Service in Egypt, where he met his lifelong friend, Peter Jewell. On returning to Britain, Douglas moved to London and began a career of acting and writing. After spending some time with Joan Littlewood&#x27;s &#x27;Theatre Workshop&#x27; company at the Theatre Royal Stratford East, he was cast in the Granada television series, &quot;The Younger Generation&quot; in 1961 and had a musical, &quot;Solo&quot;, produced in 1962 at Cheltenham.

==Filmmaking career==
Having been interested in film-making all his life, in 1969 Douglas enrolled at the London School of Film Technique, where he wrote the screenplay for a short autobiographical film called &quot;Jamie&quot;. After initial difficulties in finding support for the project, he eventually found a champion at the British Film Institute in the newly appointed head of Production, Mamoun Hassan, who secured funding on the basis that &quot;Jamie&quot; should form part one of a trilogy – echoing the great childhood trilogies of Ray and Gorky. The film was renamed &quot;My Childhood&quot;, and its success on the international festival circuit paved the way for the second and third instalments of the trilogy of Douglas&#x27;s formative years: &quot;My Ain Folk&quot; (1973) and &quot;My Way Home&quot; (1978).

The &quot;Bill Douglas Trilogy&quot; recounts the harrowing experiences of a young boy, Jamie, growing up in material and emotional poverty with his brother and grandmother; followed by incarceration in a children&#x27;s home, and then living in a hostel for down-and-outs. Eventually the call-up for national service allows Jamie to find freedom through his friendship with Robert, a young middle class Englishman who introduces him to books and the possibility of a more optimistic and fulfilling future. The austere black and white images of the films embody a stillness and intensity reminiscent of silent cinema and this visual style is augmented by the equally spare and precise use of sound. Just as the stillness of the image forces the audience to look, so the relative silence encourages greater attention to specific sounds – boots scraping on asphalt, the chirping of birds and the timbre of voices – granting an emotional power that many considered lost in the aural bombardment characterising much contemporary cinema.

The &quot;Trilogy&quot; gained a wealth of critical plaudits but Douglas struggled to raise financing for his next project, and was forced to find other ways of earning a living. Mamoun Hassan, the former head of BFI Production, invited him to teach at the National Film and Television School from 1978 and he proved to be an inspiring presence. Hassan was also able, in his role as director of the National Film Finance Corporation to help realise the project of &quot;Comrades&quot;, Douglas&#x27;s film about the &#x27;Tolpuddle Martyrs&#x27;, six Dorset farm labourers who in 1834 were arrested and tried for forming a trade union and subsequently transported to Australia. Even so, the film did not appear until 1986, six years after the screenplay had been completed. Dubbed a &#x27;poor man&#x27;s epic&#x27;, &quot;Comrades&quot; continues Douglas&#x27;s interest in the perseverance of the human spirit in the face of material adversity. It also brings to the fore his fascination with the world of optics and image-making, through a number of references to various forms of Victorian optical entertainments such as the magic lantern, the zoetrope, the peep show and the camera obscura. The story itself is mediated by the character of an itinerant magic lanternist who reappears in a number of roles.

&quot;Comrades&quot; was to be Bill Douglas&#x27;s last film. He died of cancer and is buried in the churchyard of Bishop&#x27;s Tawton in Devon. He left behind him two unmade screenplays: &quot;Justified Sinner&quot;, an adaptation of James Hogg&#x27;s celebrated novel &quot;The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner&quot;, and &quot;Flying Horse&quot;, based on the life of pre-cinema pioneer Eadweard Muybridge. Another posthumous script, &quot;Ring of Truth&quot;, written during a fellowship to Strathclyde University in 1990, was produced by BBC Scotland in 1996.

==Personal life==
Bill Douglas lived with Peter Jewell (on whom Robert of the &quot;Trilogy&quot; was based) for much of his life. Of their relationship, Peter Jewell said in 2006:
==Legacy==
Douglas&#x27;s legacy was not confined to his films. Along with Peter Jewell, he was a voracious collector of books, memorabilia, and artefacts relating to the history and prehistory of cinema. This core collection formed the basis of the Bill Douglas Cinema Museum (formerly The Bill Douglas Centre for the History of Cinema and Popular Culture), housed at the University of Exeter, when it opened six years after his death. The museum contains an exhibition on Bill Douglas&#x27;s life and work and holds his working papers, which can be accessed by researchers.

In 2012, the Glasgow Short Film Festival announced the inaugural &quot;Bill Douglas Award&quot; for their International Short Film Competition, named in his honour.

<doc id="1152442" wikidata="Q568246" url="?curid=1152442" title="Shady Records">
<text>Shady Records is an American record label founded by rapper Eminem and his manager Paul Rosenberg in 1999, following the commercially successful release of &quot;The Slim Shady LP&quot; that same year. The label&#x27;s name comes from the last name of Eminem&#x27;s alter ego, Slim Shady.

The Shady Records roster was showcased on their 2006 compilation album, &quot;Eminem Presents: The Re-Up&quot;, which peaked at number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The label&#x27;s roster was also predominantly featured on the soundtrack to the film &quot;8 Mile&quot;; the film starred Eminem while the album was led by the single &quot;Lose Yourself&quot;. The song became the first hip hop song to win an Academy Award for Best Original Song.

Shady Records has signed and released projects for acts including Eminem himself, his group D12, Obie Trice, 50 Cent, Cashis, Bad Meets Evil, Slaughterhouse, Yelawolf, Griselda, Westside Gunn and Conway the Machine; its roster as of 2024 includes Westside Boogie, Grip and Ez Mil.

==History==

===1999–2004: Formation, first generation, growth and feuds===
After Eminem released &quot;The Slim Shady LP&quot;, he started his own record label in late 1999. Eminem looked for an avenue to release D12, and Rosenberg was keen to start a label, which led to the two teaming up to form Shady. Its A&amp;R Marc Labelle has defined the record label as &quot;a boutique label but [with] all the outlets of a major [and] Interscope backing up our every move.&quot;

D12 was the first act signed by Shady as they had been rapping together since the 1990s, and the members had made a promise that whoever became successful would come back and sign the others. In June 2001, D12 released &quot;Devil&#x27;s Night&quot;, peaking at #1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, earning 371,000 copies during the first week of release. Obie Trice was introduced to Eminem through D12&#x27;s Bizarre. Eminem signed him in June 2001 as the second Shady act. Obie Trice first got public attention via a freestyle skit on the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Night&quot; album and &quot;The Eminem Show&quot; track, &quot;Drips&quot;.

While working on the film &quot;8 Mile&quot;, Eminem had a meeting with then underground rapper 50 Cent. Eminem had heard 50 Cent&#x27;s mixtape, &quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Back?&quot;, taken them to Dr. Dre and offered him the chance to work together on the artist. 50 Cent became the first solo artist signed to Shady and Aftermath. The &quot;8 Mile&quot; soundtrack was the third Shady LP to be released. The first single was &quot;Lose Yourself&quot;, which earned multiple nominations and became a surprise win of an Academy Award for Best Original Song, the first time a hip hop song had ever won the award. The second single was 50 Cent&#x27;s &quot;Wanksta&quot;, which was released as a buzz track and became popular in 50 Cent&#x27;s home town. During this time, Eminem had also made a deal with DJ Green Lantern, who released the label&#x27;s first mixtape, &quot;Invasion!&quot;, in 2002. He was the DJ for Eminem during the Anger Management Tour.

The fourth release from Shady was 50 Cent&#x27;s &quot;Get Rich or Die Tryin&#x27;&quot;, in February 2003. The album became the fastest selling debut in U.S. history, selling 872,000 copies in its first week. Next to be released from Shady was Obie Trice&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Cheers&quot;, six months later. Despite being commercial successful, the LP was considered overshadowed by 50 Cent&#x27;s music at the time. In 2003, Shady was involved in several controversies with the likes of the inherited Murder Inc. feud that 50 Cent and G-Unit were involved in, on-going problems with the previous co-owners of &quot;The Source&quot; magazine, namely Benzino, as well as escalating issues with rapper Royce da 5&#x27;9&quot;, who was previously a friend of Eminem and D12, until they reunited in 2010.

Near the end of 2003, Eminem and Dr. Dre signed a joint deal with Stat Quo. Stat Quo became the second artist to be signed to Shady and Aftermath. The following year saw the release of D12&#x27;s second album, &quot;D12 World&quot;. Also, in 2004, Eminem and Rosenberg began a venture offered by Sirius Satellite Radio that saw the airing of their uncensored hip hop radio station, Shade 45. Shady DJ, DJ Green Lantern, was given his own show, whilst 50 Cent&#x27;s G-Unit DJ, DJ Whoo Kid, co-hosted G-Unit Radio on Saturdays.

===2005–2009: Development and &quot;Eminem Presents: The Re-Up&quot;===
2005 saw the release of 50 Cent&#x27;s second release, &quot;The Massacre&quot;, which set a record as the sixth fastest selling album since Nielsen SoundScan started tracking albums in 1991, with 1.14 million albums sold in four days. The album was a commercial success, and was only 32,000 records away from being the best-selling album of the year. On &quot;Piggy Bank&quot;, a song off the album, 50 Cent insulted several artists, including Jadakiss. The feud between Jadakiss and 50 Cent indirectly led to DJ Green Lantern leaving Shady Records. A few months after the release of &quot;The Massacre&quot;, Jadakiss appeared on a street DVD, and had DJ Green Lantern on loudspeaker through his phone, without Green Lantern being aware of this. The DJ shared his thoughts on how to deal with the feud. When the DVD was released and Eminem found out about what happened, Green Lantern had to leave Shady Records and &quot;Shade 45&quot;, and his upcoming album, &quot;Armageddon&quot;, was no longer a Shady Records-related project. The Alchemist was signed on as the official tour DJ for Eminem on the 2005 &quot;Anger Management 3 Tour&quot;, replacing the recently ousted DJ Green Lantern.

In August 2005, Eminem and the &quot;XXL&quot; magazine teamed up to release a special issue titled &quot;XXL Presents Shade 45&quot;, and was designed to give maximum exposure to Shade 45 as a radio station, and at the same time give maximum exposure to the Shady Records label as a whole, as well as the radio DJ&#x27;s and G-Unit Records&#x27; artists. &quot;XXL&quot; executive publisher, Jonathan Rheingold, stated that typically magazines based around particular artists were not favorable, but &quot;since Shade 45 is a truly authentic and uncensored rap radio channel, the marriage with the &quot;XXL&quot; brand made sense,&quot; before adding that it is what would interest rap fans. September 2005 also saw the signing of Bobby Creekwater to the label, making him the fifth artist and the second Atlanta-based rapper.

In early 2006, Chicago-born Orange County, California-based rapper named Cashis joined Shady Records, after he managed to get his demo heard by Eminem. Later in 2006, Obie Trice released his second album, &quot;Second Round&#x27;s on Me&quot;. However, the album did not fare as well commercially as his debut, seemingly because of the state of the hip-hop industry. The album saw a change in Obie Trice&#x27;s style, whose first album was considered to be a little light-hearted. &quot;Second Round&#x27;s on Me&quot; was considered to be a more serious, dark album, mainly showing the grittiness of Obie Trice&#x27;s life and surroundings.

In early 2006, there had been talk of Eminem having the label&#x27;s roster on a mixtape with new material to be presented by DJ Whoo Kid and The Alchemist. This talk went on for several months. In the end, it was announced that Eminem was so impressed with the mixtape material that he had decided to make it an official album, called &quot;Eminem Presents the Re-Up&quot;. The album had been long anticipated, until it was released in early December 2006. The release had spawned the single &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know&quot;, which featured 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks, and the latest signee Cashis.

In May 2007, Cashis released the eight-track &quot;The County Hound EP&quot; in an attempt to have people &quot;fiend&quot; for his music, or garner interest in it. The album was released as a limited edition EP. September saw the release of 50 Cent&#x27;s third album with the label, &quot;Curtis&quot;, which was involved in a well publicized competition with rapper Kanye West, who had his third album, &quot;Graduation&quot; set for release on the same day. In June 2008, Obie Trice departed from the label. A misunderstanding was made where it was believed he was attacking the label and Eminem on a single titled &quot;The Giant&quot; but they were quickly dismissed. In a statement, Paul Rosenberg stated &quot;Shady Records has agreed to allow Obie Trice to pursue his craft in a different forum free from the constraints of the current major label model [...] Eminem will continue to support and work with Obie on many levels of his career [...] He remains a close friend and member of the Shady family.&quot; In a 2012 interview, Obie opened up on the topic, admitting having issues with Interscope Records chairman Jimmy Iovine, which was Trice&#x27;s fault, clarifying &quot;I was kind of reckless, not on time, certain things and [Iovine] didn&#x27;t want to further the project with me so we tried to work it out but it just didn’t come to a head so I had to do what I had to do,&quot; before going on to note that his relationship with the label is great, and he continues to work with Eminem, notably on &quot;Bottoms Up&quot;, which was to be released originally on Shady Records.

Stat Quo was also released from the label in 2008. Stat felt the root cause appeared to him to be a straining relationship with Eminem stemming from differences relating to the promotion of the album. HipHopDX detailed the events following this point in the situation leading to his release from the label with &quot;Eminem&#x27;s decision to remove himself from Stat&#x27;s project, a subsequent, and unexplained, decision made by Dr. Dre to not appear in Stat&#x27;s video for &quot;Here We Go,&quot; and the aforementioned lack of support for the single by parent label, Interscope, Stat began seeking his release from the label.&quot; 2009 saw the departure of Bobby Creekwater who had been working on his debut album, &quot;A Brilliant Mistake&quot;.

===2010–2016: Shady 2.0 and &quot;Shady XV&quot;===
Slaughterhouse guest featured Eminem&#x27;s seventh album &quot;Recovery&quot; on the bonus track &quot;Session One&quot;. On January 12, 2011, Slaughterhouse and Yelawolf appeared on the cover of the XXL magazine with Eminem, then was confirmed that both acts were signed to Shady Records. On March 2, 2011, a track called &quot;2.0 Boys&quot; performed by Eminem, Slaughterhouse and Yelawolf surfaced.

On April 25, 2011, Eminem and Royce da 5&#x27;9&quot; announced plans to team up for a joint EP, slated for release on June 14. The project served as a long-awaited follow-up to their 1999 collaboration &quot;Nuttin&#x27; to Do&quot;, and featured production from Mr. Porter, Havoc of Mobb Deep, Bangladesh and more. &quot;Royce and I started hanging out again and inevitably that led us back into the studio&quot;, said Eminem in a statement. &quot;At first we were just seeing where it went without any real goal in mind, but the songs started to come together crazy, so here we are.&quot; Royce also talked about it, and said: &quot;I&#x27;m excited to see this project come to fruition considering the long lapse in time between when we worked before and now. We had a blast doing it and we just hope everyone enjoys it while we&#x27;re working on the &#x27;Monster&#x27; that will be the Slaughterhouse album.&quot;
In October 2011, Yelawolf and Slaughterhouse, along with Eminem, freestyled over East Flatbush Project&#x27;s &quot;Tried by 12&quot; on a DJ Premier-hosted BET Cypher segment at the 2011 BET Hip Hop Awards. Becoming referred to as the &quot;Shady 2.0 BET Cypher&quot;, it was considered to be a fan favorite segment of the cipher sessions presented throughout the awards show, with talk spreading across many online social media outlets, and Twitter having popularised trends relating with the terms &quot;#Cypher&quot; and &quot;#Shady 2.0&quot; as it was airing.

The label showcased acts at the 2012 SXSW festival on March 16, 2012, at the Austin Music Hall. The evening was presented by Shade 45 radio host Sway Calloway, the Shady Records artist line up for the evening included Slaughterhouse and 50 Cent, who performed his début album &quot;Get Rich or Die Tryin&#x27;&quot; in its entirety for the first time. Yelawolf was also scheduled to perform but couldn&#x27;t due to a spleen injury earlier that month.

On March 20, 50 Cent announced that his 50 Cent&#x27;s fifth studio album would be released on July 2, 2012. This was later delayed to November 13, 2012. Another delay was announced, pushing the release back to January 2013. On March 29, 2012, Yelawolf announced his second release under Shady, tentatively titled &quot;Love Story&quot;. On May 24, 2012, Eminem announced his eighth studio album, &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP 2&quot;, which was then released on November 5, 2013.

When speaking about all future Shady Records releases president Paul Rosenberg said that Eminem&#x27;s next album would be released post-Memorial Day 2013 and to expect new music from it soon. He also went on to discuss the other acts saying 50 Cent&#x27;s &quot;Street King Immortal&quot; would be released in the first half of 2013, with Yelawolf&#x27;s second album, &quot;Love Story&quot;, currently being recorded. Rosenberg would also state that all four members of Slaughterhouse would release solo projects prior to them returning to the studio as a group to record their second album under Shady Records. The first album released would be Joe Budden&#x27;s &quot;No Love Lost&quot; on February 5, 2013, under E1 Music. The second would be Kxng Crooked&#x27;s &quot;Apex Predator&quot; released under Treacherous C.O.B and Empire Distribution. However, Royce and Joell Ortiz of Slaughterhouse would confirm in May 2013 that they had put their solo projects on hold, and had begun working on their third studio album.

On February 20, 2014, 50 Cent announced he left Interscope Records, which included his deal with Shady Records and Aftermath Entertainment, in which he is now signed to Caroline Records.

On August 25, 2014, a press release on Eminem&#x27;s official website announced an upcoming compilation album by Shady Records, titled &quot;Shady XV&quot;. The two-disc album is scheduled for release on November 24, 2014, in the week of Black Friday and will consist of one greatest hits disc and one disc of new material from Shady Records artists such as D12, Slaughterhouse, Bad Meets Evil, and Yelawolf. On the same day, August 25, 2014, the first single from the album, titled &quot;Guts Over Fear&quot; and featuring singer-songwriter Sia, was released.

===2017–present: Third generation and the disbandment of D12 and Slaughterhouse===
On March 3, 2017, Shady Records and Griselda Records announced that Shady Records had signed Westside Gunn and Conway the Machine to the label both individually and collectively. Following the 2017 BET Hip-Hop Awards on October 11, 2017, Shady Records announced that they had signed Compton rapper Boogie.

The signings of these artists has led to Shady&#x27;s profitability again, with the releases of Yelawolf&#x27;s &quot;Trial by Fire&quot; and Eminem&#x27;s &quot;Revival&quot;. The latter would suddenly release his tenth studio album &quot;Kamikaze&quot; without any prior promotion.

During the transition, Royce da 5&#x27;9&quot; announced that Slaughterhouse had officially disbanded, so did Eminem with D12, and Yelawolf left the label after releasing &quot;Trunk Muzik 3&quot;.

In 2019, Boogie released his debut album &quot;Everything&#x27;s for Sale&quot;, and Griselda released their first album on the label, &quot;WWCD&quot;, both meeting critical acclaim.

On January 17, 2020, Eminem released his eleventh studio album &quot;Music to Be Murdered By&quot; without any prior announcement. Commercially, it debuted at number one in 12 countries. In the United States, the album sold 279,000 in its first week becoming Eminem&#x27;s tenth consecutive number-one album in the country. Eminem became the only artist with ten consecutive number-one albums in the United States and United Kingdom. Both Griselda and Westside Gunn left the label the same year.

On July 2, 2021, it was announced that Atlanta rapper Grip had signed to the label, and later released his debut Shady album, &quot;I Died for This!?&quot;.

On February 25, 2022, Conway the Machine released his second studio album, &quot;God Don&#x27;t Make Mistakes&quot;, and on June 17, 2022, Westside Boogie released &quot;More Black Superheroes&quot;. &quot;God Don&#x27;t Make Mistakes&quot; was his final album before signing off with Shady. That same year, Eminem released his second greatest hits album, &quot;Curtain Call 2&quot;, following his 2005 compilation album &quot;Curtain Call: The Hits&quot;.

On July 27, 2023, Eminem announced the signing of Ez Mil to Shady and Aftermath, and announced a collaboration titled &quot;Realest&quot;, and later a reissue of &quot;Du4li7y&quot;.

On May 31, 2024, Eminem came back from hiatus to release &quot;Houdini&quot;, the leading single of his upcoming album, &quot;The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce)&quot;, which was released on July 12, 2024.
