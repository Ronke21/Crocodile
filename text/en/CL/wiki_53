<text>WTTO (channel 21) is a television station licensed to Homewood, Alabama, United States, serving the Birmingham area as an affiliate of The CW. It is owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group alongside MyNetworkTV affiliate WABM (channel 68) and ABC affiliate WBMA-LD (channel 58). The stations share studios at the Riverchase office park on Concourse Parkway in Hoover (with a Birmingham mailing address); WTTO&#x27;s transmitter is located atop Red Mountain, near the Goldencrest neighborhood of southwestern Birmingham.

In Tuscaloosa, west Alabama, and the western portions of the Birmingham area, WTTO&#x27;s CW channel and two subchannels of WBMA-LD are rebroadcast on WDBB (channel 17), which is licensed to Bessemer. It is owned by Cunningham Broadcasting and managed by Sinclair under a local marketing agreement (LMA); however, Sinclair effectively owns WDBB, as the majority of Cunningham&#x27;s stock is owned by the family of deceased group founder Julian Smith.

WTTO had a tortuous history prior to starting operations. It took nearly two decades for the station to be approved and built. Once on air, the station was a successful independent for the Birmingham area. It served as the Fox affiliate for the market from 1990 to 1996, when an affiliation shuffle resulted in the loss of the affiliation.

==History==

===Early history of UHF channel 21 in central Alabama===
The UHF channel 21 allocation in Central Alabama was originally allocated to Gadsden. The first television station in the region to occupy the allocation was WTVS, which operated during the 1950s as an affiliate of the DuMont Television Network, and was one of the earliest UHF television stations in the United States.

However, it was never able to gain a viewership foothold against the region&#x27;s other stations; its owners ceased the operations of WTVS in 1957, as it had suffered from severely limited viewership due to the lack of television sets in Central Alabama that were capable of receiving stations on the UHF band (electronics manufacturers were not required to incorporate built-in UHF tuners into television sets until the passage of the All-Channel Receiver Act by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 1961, although such tuners would not be included on all newer sets until 1964).

===A long way to air===
In December 1963, Chapman Radio and Television Company—then the owners of radio station WCRT (1260 AM, now WYDE and 96.5 FM, now WMJJ)—filed an application to build a new television station in Homewood, using Birmingham&#x27;s channel 54 allocation. This application was designated for hearing with one by Symphony Network Association, Inc., in 1964. In 1965, the UHF table of allocations was overhauled, and channel 21 was substituted for 54 on Chapman&#x27;s application. The FCC granted the permit to Chapman in August 1965; however, the FCC chose to resume hearings on the matter after other applicants protested the granting of Chapman&#x27;s petition. (In the meantime, the Chapmans built, and then sold, WCFT-TV in Tuscaloosa.)

One of the new bidders was a startup station—WBMG (channel 42), the first commercial UHF station in Birmingham—which hoped it could replace channel 42 with 21. When the contest resumed, there were five applicants. Besides Chapman and WBMG, there was Tele-Mac of Birmingham, owned by John McClendon, who also ran a chain of Black-oriented radio stations including WENN in Birmingham; Alabama Television Corporation, owned by John S. Jemison; and Birmingham Broadcasting Company, which was owned by Black businessman A. G. Gaston. Tele-Mac bowed out in late November, leaving four parties seeking the channel.

Hearing examiner James Kraushaar&#x27;s initial decision, released in September 1968, gave the nod to Alabama Television, based on its superior technical proposal. However, Chapman and WBMG contested the award, and the FCC agreed, finding that Alabama Television had failed to contact Black people in the process of ascertainment of community needs required of prospective licensees. WBMG&#x27;s petition also raised a 1969 incident in which a cemetery owned by Jemison refused to bury the body of a Black soldier killed in Vietnam. In 1971, two other Alabama Television shareholders, George J. Mitnick and Joseph Engel, were sued by the United States Department of Justice for violations of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, and the FCC opened new hearings on the firm&#x27;s qualifications in light of the lawsuit.

Meanwhile, another applicant, Birmingham Broadcasting—which pledged the first integrated TV station in the country—was facing trouble in its ownership group. One of its stakeholders was Oscar Hyde, who was convicted on extortion charges in 1968 but still owned a third of the firm, putting it at a serious disadvantage in comparative hearing until Hyde sold his stake in 1973. WBMG had dropped out by this point, leaving Chapman and Birmingham Broadcasting the lone contenders for the construction permit; the Hyde stake was still being contested, but the FCC found the programming proposals from Chapman inadequate. Furthermore, the two financial institutions that had promised Birmingham Broadcasting funding in 1964 no longer existed in 1976. Hearings were held by the FCC that fall, but one Birmingham Broadcasting stakeholder, Jesse L. Lewis, refused to come; he was serving as the State Highway and Traffic Safety Director, making him the only Black leader of a state agency, and he feared that if he left town, his department would be abolished by the state legislature.

The question of financial backing turned out to be the deciding factor when an administrative law judge found in favor of Chapman&#x27;s bid in 1977. The decision was appealed to the full FCC, which upheld the ruling in March 1979. An attempted appeal in federal court turned out to have been filed one day late, while a petition for reconsideration made to the FCC was also dismissed.

===Early years===
With the permit in hand, construction—and new shareholders—entered the picture. The Chapman brothers sold half of the unbuilt station in 1980 to Byron Lasky, who owned Satellite Television &amp; Associated Resources, a company providing microwave-based subscription television service in Birmingham. The tower was erected alongside studios in the city&#x27;s Goldencrest neighborhood in early 1982, and on April 21, after more than 18 years, WTTO debuted as Birmingham&#x27;s fourth commercial TV station, with the first program being &quot;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century&quot;.

WTTO gave Birmingham its first independent station and Alabama its second, debuting a few weeks after WPMI-TV in Mobile. In 1983, Lasky acquired the remaining half of WTTO from the Chapmans. During this time, the station extended its cable reach, appearing on the system in Anniston in 1985.

Channel 21 was programmed as a typical UHF independent, maintaining a schedule reliant mainly on cartoons, sitcoms and movies. From its sign-on in 1982 until 1985, WTTO also carried programming from the Financial News Network. WTTO quickly became known in the market for airing a broad mix of cult films as part of its film lineup (the station also hosted film festivals at parks throughout central Alabama, featuring public screenings of the movies that it broadcast), as well as spoof promotional campaigns for its programs. WTTO quickly became the strongest independent station in Alabama, and one of the highest-rated independents in the United States. WTTO remained the only independent station in central Alabama for its first two years of operation; however, it would eventually gain a competitor in the west-central part of the state. In 1984, WDBB began broadcasting from Tuscaloosa, and it activated a new transmission facility in 1986 that extended its signal to Birmingham. It was WDBB (and WNAL-TV, a station in Gadsden that primarily rebroadcast it) that served as the market&#x27;s first Fox affiliate.

In September 1986, HR Broadcasting Company, a unit of HAR Communications, purchased the station along with WCGV-TV in Milwaukee from Byron Lasky&#x27;s companies. HAR Communications was 20% owned by Hal Roach Studios.

In June 1990, Qintex Entertainment sold its stake in HR Broadcasting Co., which owned WTTO and WCGV, to ABRY Communications for over $40 million. ABRY was successful in winning the Fox affiliation from WDBB, which moved to WTTO on September 1, 1990. As a result of their financial difficulties, WDBB and WNAL began simulcasting WTTO on January 30, 1991. Several stronger WDBB syndicated programs were added to WTTO&#x27;s schedule as a result. In addition to programming contracts, WTTO also purchased WDBB&#x27;s Birmingham business offices and W62BG, a translator improving service in parts of the city. The structure of WTTO&#x27;s relationship with WDBB and WNAL changed to one of an affiliation; the stations also had the ability to air some of their own programming. The three stations functioned as a regional network of their own, providing coverage comparable to WBRC and WVTM-TV.

By 1993, Abry had purchased WDBB and WNAL outright and converted both stations into full-time satellites of WTTO. WDBB then relocated its transmitter facilities to a tower in Moundville and reduced its transmitter power to reduce overlap with WTTO, but continued to maintain Bessemer as its city of license. That same year, WTTO entered into a local marketing agreement with WABM, which had been sold a few months earlier to a locally based group. By 1994, WTTO had become one of the highest-rated Fox affiliates in the country, and managed to overtake CBS affiliate WBMG as the third-highest-rated television station in central Alabama. Late that year, both WDBB and WNAL began airing separate programming during the daytime and late evening hours, consisting of syndicated sitcoms, drama and animated series that WTTO did not hold the rights to broadcast as well as local newscasts.

In 1994, Abry Communications merged with Sinclair Broadcast Group, which—in addition to acquiring WTTO and WDBB—also assumed the rights to the local marketing agreement with WABM. At that time, the station moved its operations into WABM&#x27;s facilities on Beacon Parkway West. In 1995, WNAL was purchased by Fant Broadcasting, but it continued to simulcast WTTO&#x27;s programming through a time brokerage agreement.

===Disaffiliation from Fox and eventual switch to The WB===
On May 5, 1994, Great American Communications (which would be renamed Citicasters following the completion of its debt restructuring later that year) agreed to sell WBRC and three of its sister stations—fellow ABC affiliate WGHP in High Point, North Carolina, NBC affiliate WDAF-TV in Kansas City and CBS affiliate KSAZ-TV in Phoenix—to New World Communications for $350 million in cash and $10 million in share warrants. As part of a broader deal between New World and Fox signed on May 23 of that year, New World agreed to affiliate five of its eight existing television stations and the four it had acquired from Great American with Fox, in a series of affiliation transactions that would take two years to complete due to the varying conclusion dates of their ongoing contracts with either ABC, NBC or CBS. WBRC was one of the stations involved in this agreement. Although WTTO had established itself as one of the network&#x27;s strongest affiliates, Fox jumped at the chance to align with WBRC, which had been the dominant station in central Alabama for over three decades.

Three weeks later, New World agreed to buy WVTM-TV and three other stations—CBS affiliates KDFW in Dallas–Fort Worth and KTBC in Austin, and ABC affiliate KTVI in St. Louis—from Argyle Television Holdings, in a purchase option-structured deal worth $717 million. The two purchases created a problem for New World due to conflicts caused by restrictions on television station ownership imposed by the FCC at the time; New World was not permitted to retain both WBRC and WVTM in any event as the ownership of two television stations in the same market by a single company was prohibited, and the concurrent acquisitions would give New World ownership of a combined fifteen stations, three more than the FCC allowed. The group&#x27;s affiliation deal with Fox allowed New World to solve its ownership conflicts in Birmingham, as it chose to establish and transfer the license of WBRC into a trust company with the intent to sell the station to the network&#x27;s broadcasting subsidiary, Fox Television Stations; the trust transfer was completed on July 24, 1995.

Although the transfer of WBRC to the trust was finalized on July 24, 1995, Fox could not switch WBRC&#x27;s network affiliation in the short-term, as the station&#x27;s contract with ABC would not expire until August 31, 1996. While this forced Fox Television Stations to operate WBRC as an ABC affiliate for 8½ months after its purchase of the station from the New World-established trust closed on January 17, 1996, creating the rare situation in which a station was run by the owned-and-operated station group of one network but maintained an affiliation with one of its competitors, it gave ABC enough time to find a new central Alabama affiliate. The network first approached WTTO for an affiliation agreement. However, Sinclair—which would not own any stations affiliated with either of the Big Three networks until it acquired River City Broadcasting in 1996—was only willing to carry ABC&#x27;s prime time and news programming, as it was not interested in carrying the network&#x27;s then-languishing daytime and Saturday morning programs. Even though WDBB operated a news department at the time negotiations with ABC began, Sinclair was also not willing to start a news department for WTTO; the group did not allocate a budget for news production for its non-Big Three stations at the time.

Unlike situations in St. Louis and the Piedmont Triad, where the network had little other choice but to align with a Sinclair-owned station (or one that the group would later acquire) due to a lack of another financially secure full-power station, other options were available in the Birmingham market. After turning down the WTTO offer in late 1995, ABC reached an agreement with Allbritton Communications to affiliate with WCFT in November of that year; Allbritton planned to acquire the non-license assets of WNAL-TV under a local marketing agreement and convert it into a satellite of WCFT-TV. Allbritton would later terminate the proposed LMA with WNAL and entered into an LMA with Osborne Communications Corporation to take over the operations of WJSU-TV; it also purchased low-power independent station W58CK (channel 58, now WBMA-LD) to serve as the official ABC affiliate for central Alabama for the purpose of being counted in the Birmingham station ratings reports (as Nielsen designated Tuscaloosa and Anniston as separate markets at the time), with WCFT and WJSU serving as its satellites; this prompted Allbritton to sign a groupwide affiliation deal with ABC which renewed the network&#x27;s affiliations with its stations in Little Rock, Tulsa, Harrisburg, Roanoke, and Washington, D.C. and caused the company&#x27;s stations in Charleston and Brunswick, Georgia to switch to the network.

On September 1, 1996, when WBRC-TV officially became a Fox owned-and-operated station and W58CK/WCFT/WJSU became an ABC affiliate, WTTO and WDBB reverted to operating as independent stations. Simultaneously, WNAL formally terminated the WTTO simulcast, and became the CBS affiliate for Gadsden and northeastern Alabama. WBRC originally planned to carry the entire Fox network schedule, running the Fox Kids block on weekday afternoons to replace the displaced ABC soap opera lineup upon its move to the W58CK trimulcast (which would be collectively known as &quot;ABC 33/40&quot;, a brand referencing the respective channel numbers of WCFT and WJSU, and will mostly be referred to hereafter in the article as &quot;WBMA+&quot;). However, in what would be the catalyst to a change in the carriage policies for Fox Kids that allowed stations the option of either airing the block or being granted the right to transfer the rights to another station in the market, Sinclair approached WBRC about allowing WTTO to retain Fox Kids, which the Fox network (on behalf of Fox Television Stations) allowed it to keep.

On January 27, 1997, WTTO and WDBB became affiliates of The WB Television Network, and changed its on-air branding to &quot;WB 21&quot;. It was one of the first Sinclair stations to affiliate with the network, occurring six months before the group struck an agreement to affiliate most of its UPN-affiliated and independent stations that it either owned or controlled to The WB on July 21. Prior to that point, Birmingham had been one of the largest markets that was not served by a local WB affiliate; central Alabama residents were only able to receive WB programs on satellite and some cable providers through the national superstation feed of the network&#x27;s Chicago affiliate, WGN-TV (now an independent station; its cable feed now operates as a standalone channel), which carried the network&#x27;s programming nationwide from The WB&#x27;s launch in January 1995 until October 1999.

With the WB affiliation, WTTO added one of Fox Kids&#x27; competitors, Kids&#x27; WB, to its inventory of children&#x27;s programming. The station carried Kids&#x27; WB&#x27;s weekday morning and afternoon blocks together on Monday through Friday mornings (bookending Fox Kids&#x27; weekday morning block) on either a one-day delay or live-to-air depending on the time slot and accordant block; the Saturday morning edition of the block, meanwhile, aired on Sundays in a day-behind arrangement as WTTO aired the Fox Kids weekend block on Saturdays. During the late 1990s, WTTO reduced the number of movies, classic sitcoms and cartoons on its schedule, and began shifting its syndicated programming towards a lineup of talk, reality and court shows as well as more recent syndicated sitcoms, that would become the common variety of programming for netlet stations at that time.

In early 2000, WDBB relocated its transmitter facilities back to its original guyed-mast transmission tower in Windham Springs (which was constructed and completed shortly before the station signed on in 1982). WTTO dropped the Fox Kids block back in September 1999, at which time, the station moved the Kids&#x27; WB blocks to weekday afternoons and Saturday mornings. Neither WBRC, nor any other central Alabama station, chose to acquire the local rights to Fox&#x27;s children&#x27;s programming lineup; as a result, Fox Kids, as well as the successor blocks that 4Kids Entertainment programmed for the network after 2002 (Fox Box and 4Kids TV), were not cleared in the Birmingham market for the years that the network continued to carry children&#x27;s programming; in addition, WTTO (as with WBRC) declined to air the paid programming block that replaced 4Kids TV in January 2009, &quot;Weekend Marketplace&quot;; it would air instead on WABM. WTTO has continued to air the children&#x27;s program blocks carried by The WB, and later by The CW (Kids&#x27; WB, The CW4Kids/Toonzai, Vortexx and One Magnificent Morning), without interruption through the years. In 2001, Sinclair purchased WABM outright, creating the Birmingham–Tuscaloosa–Anniston market&#x27;s first television duopoly with WTTO/WDBB.

===CW affiliation===
On January 24, 2006, the Warner Bros. Entertainment unit of Time Warner (which operated The WB) and CBS Corporation (which acquired UPN through its split from Viacom in December 2005) announced that the two companies would respectively shut down UPN and The WB, and enter into a joint venture to form a new &quot;fifth&quot; broadcast television network, The CW, that would initially feature a mix of programming from both of its forerunner networks as well as new content developed specifically for The CW. WTTO, however, continued to show The WB&#x27;s programming until the network&#x27;s closure on September 17, 2006. On May 2, 2006, Sinclair Broadcast Group announced that it had signed an affiliation agreement with the network, in which WTTO would become the Birmingham charter affiliate of The CW; when it officially joined the network upon its debut on September 18, WTTO/WDBB adopted &quot;CW 21&quot; as its official branding (although, the station sometimes identifies as &quot;CW 21 Alabama&quot; in some promotional imaging); sister station WABM affiliated with MyNetworkTV, a new secondary service started by Fox, on September 5, 2006.

In 2007, Sinclair sold WDBB to Cunningham Broadcasting, and entered into a time brokerage agreement to continue operating that station as its repeater. However, the sale itself was purely nominal, as 97% of Cunningham&#x27;s stock is controlled by trusts owned by the family of now-deceased Sinclair founder Julian Sinclair Smith (including, among others, its current chief executive officer David Smith). Since the late 1990s, when it was known as Glencairn, Ltd., Cunningham has long faced allegations that it merely acts a shell corporation to circumvent FCC rules on television station ownership within a single market.

====Secondary ABC affiliation====
On July 29, 2013, Allbritton Communications announced that it would sell its seven television stations—including the trimulcast operation involving WBMA-LD and satellites WCFT-TV and WJSU-TV—to Sinclair Broadcast Group (which would purchase the stations for $985 million), in order to focus on running its co-owned political news website, Politico. As part of the deal, Sinclair had intended to sell the license assets of WTTO and WABM to Deerfield Media, and retain operational responsibilities for those stations through shared services and joint sales agreements.

On December 6, 2013, the FCC informed Sinclair that applications related to the deal need to be &quot;amended or withdrawn&quot;, as Sinclair would retain the existing time brokerage agreement between WTTO and WDBB; this would, in effect, create a new LMA between WBMA+ and WDBB, even though the commission had ruled in 1999 that such agreements made after November 5, 1996, covering the programming of more than 15% of a station&#x27;s broadcast day would count toward the ownership limits for the brokering station&#x27;s owner. On March 20, 2014, as part of a restructuring of the Sinclair-Allbritton deal in order to address these ownership conflicts as well as to expedite approval of the Allbritton acquisition that was delayed due to the FCC&#x27;s increased scrutiny of outsourcing agreements (such as those maintained by Sinclair) used to circumvent in-market ownership caps, Sinclair announced that it would retain ownership of WTTO (under which WDBB would continue operating as its satellite under the existing LMA), and form a new duopoly between it and WBMA+ (which would mark the first known instance in which the senior partner in one duopoly became the junior partner in another, as well as the first instance involving a duopoly that was broken up legally terminating all operational ties with the junior partner); WABM was to be sold to a third-party buyer with which Sinclair would not enter into an operational outsourcing arrangement or maintain any contingent interest, other than a possible transitional shared facilities agreement until WTTO was able to move its operations from its Beacon Parkway studios to WBMA&#x27;s facility in Hoover.

On May 29, 2014, after informing the FCC that it had not found a buyer for WABM (even among the respective owners of WBRC, WVTM and WIAT that did not operate an existing duopoly in Birmingham, Raycom Media, Media General and LIN Media, the latter two of which were in the process of merging at the time), Sinclair stated that it would propose a surrendering of the WJSU and WCFT licenses, and migrate the WBMA simulcast to WABM&#x27;s second digital subchannel on the basis that the latter&#x27;s transmission facilities are superior to those of WCFT and WJSU (as a low-power station, WBMA-LD would not be affected as the FCC does not apply in-market ownership caps to low-power stations owned alongside any full-power station). After nearly a year of delays, Sinclair&#x27;s acquisition of Allbritton was approved by the FCC on July 24, 2014, and completed one week later on August 1.

On September 18, 2014, in preparation for the planned shutdown of WCFT and WJSU eleven days later on September 29 (the transaction would be suspended on Sinclair&#x27;s asking by the FCC days prior to the shutdown after the group agreed to sell both stations to Howard Stirk Holdings, on the agreement that Sinclair would not enter into any operational arrangements with HSH for either station), WDBB added a simulcast feed of WBMA-LD on digital subchannel 17.2, replacing WCFT (which became a Heartland affiliate) as WBMA&#x27;s Tuscaloosa repeater; WABM also added a simulcast of the WBMA on its 68.2 subchannel.

== Sports programming ==

In August 2009, WTTO/WDBB acquired the broadcast rights to ESPN Regional Television&#x27;s SEC Network syndication service, carrying most regular season college basketball and football games from the Southeastern Conference, as well as games from the first three rounds of the SEC men&#x27;s basketball tournament; this agreement ended when ESPN discontinued the service in 2012, upon the launch of a conference-focused cable-only network of the same name.

In September 2015, WTTO/WDBB became the local broadcast rightsholder to the ACC Network syndication service, airing most regular season football and basketball games from selected teams in the Atlantic Coast Conference as well as games from the first three rounds of the ACC men&#x27;s basketball tournament.

== Newscasts ==
WTTO launched its own in-house news operation on September 8, 2003, and began airing a nightly hour-long prime time newscast, titled &quot;WB21 News at 9:00&quot;. The program was developed and formatted around the &quot;News Central&quot; local/national hybrid news concept created by Sinclair that year; local news segments originated from the station&#x27;s Beacon Parkway studios in Birmingham, while national news, weather and sports segments were based out of studios located at Sinclair&#x27;s corporate headquarters on Beaver Dam Road in Hunt Valley, Maryland. In addition, WTTO also aired &quot;The Point&quot;, a controversial one-minute conservative political commentary feature during its newscasts; the segment was required to air on all Sinclair-owned stations that aired local newscasts (regardless of whether it carried the &quot;News Central&quot; format or not).

=== Outsourcing to WIAT ===

The &quot;WB21 News at 9:00&quot; was unable to make headway against WBRC&#x27;s longer-established (and much higher-rated) 9 p.m. newscast, which debuted in September 1996 upon its switch to Fox; as a result, WTTO outsourced production of its evening newscast to CBS affiliate WIAT through a news share agreement in October 2005. The WIAT-produced newscast was canceled on October 13, 2006, due to low ratings; the &quot;News Central&quot; format had earlier been phased out entirely in its other markets by March 2006.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s ATSC 1.0 channels are carried on the multiplexed signals of other Birmingham television stations:
===Analog-to-digital conversion===
On February 2, 2009, Sinclair Broadcast Group announced in an e-mail release to all cable and satellite television providers carrying its television stations that, regardless of the exact date of the mandatory switchover to digital-only broadcasting for full-power stations (which Congress rescheduled days later to June 12), its stations (including WABM) would shut down their analog signals on the originally scheduled transition date of February 17.

WTTO and WDBB ended regular programming on their analog signals, respectively over UHF channels 21 and 17, at 11:59 p.m. on that date. WTTO&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 28, using virtual channel 21. WDBB also continued to operate its digital signal on its pre-transition digital channel, UHF 18, using virtual channel 17. As part of the SAFER Act, WTTO and WDBB kept their analog signal on the air until March 19 to inform viewers of the digital television transition through a loop of public service announcements from the National Association of Broadcasters.

With the digital conversion, WTTO moved its transmitter facilities from its analog transmitter site east on Red Mountain to a digital transmitter overlooking the Goldencrest neighborhood, that it shares with radio stations WZZK (104.7 FM) and WBPT (106.9 FM). The move and the resulting expansion of its coverage area, resulted in the shutdown of W62BG as the main signal provided adequate coverage of the entire Birmingham area; the translator&#x27;s license was canceled in late October 2011.

<text>Pangbourne is a village and civil parish on the River Thames in the West Berkshire unitary area of the county of Berkshire, England. Pangbourne has shops, churches, schools and a village hall. Outside its grouped developed area is an independent school, Pangbourne College.

==Geography==
Pangbourne is situated on the A329 road west of Reading, the nearest town, and south east of Oxford. It is across the river from the Oxfordshire village of Whitchurch-on-Thames. The two villages are connected by Whitchurch Bridge and by the traversable weir of Whitchurch Lock. The River Pang flows through the centre of Pangbourne village before joining the Thames between Whitchurch Lock and Whitchurch bridge. Most of the developed area is just above the current flood plain of the River Thames which benefits from hay meadows traditionally used as flood meadows to either side of Pangbourne. Fewer than 15 properties here flooded during the Winter storms of 2013–14 in the United Kingdom.

==History==

Pangbourne&#x27;s name is recorded from 844 as Old English &quot;Pegingaburnan&quot; (dative case), which means &quot;the stream of the people of [a man called] Pǣga&quot;.

In Norman times, the manor was given to Reading Abbey and the manor house – now called Bere Court – became the abbot&#x27;s summer residence. The last abbot, Hugh Cook Faringdon, was arrested there in 1539 and subsequently executed in Reading. The manor was later purchased by Sir John Davis, the Elizabethan mathematician and the Earl of Essex&#x27;s fellow-conspirator. His monument is in the Church of England parish church of Saint James the Less.

The Pangbourne war memorial is found in the grounds of the church. It was designed by the artist Vera Waddington. Other monuments and hatchments in the church are mostly to the Breedon family. John Breedon, Senior, bought the manor in 1671. He was High Sheriff of Berkshire and brother of the Governor of Nova Scotia, whose son later succeeded John at the manor. The family produced a number of sheriffs and MPs for Berkshire, as well as doctors and rectors of the parish.

Kenneth Grahame, author of &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot;, retired to Church Cottage in Pangbourne. He died there in 1932. E. H. Shepherd&#x27;s famous illustrations of his book are said to have been inspired by the Thameside landscape there and the water voles of the river are thought to have inspired the character of Ratty. The Falkland Islands memorial chapel at Pangbourne College was opened by Queen Elizabeth II in March 2000. It was built to commemorate the lives and sacrifice of all who died during the Falklands War of 1982, and the courage of those who served with them to preserve the sovereignty of the islands. The Queen revisited the Memorial Chapel in 2007 to mark the 25th anniversary of the Falklands war.

Jimmy Page guitarist/producer owned a riverside cottage in Pangbourne from 1967 to 1975. The band Led Zeppelin was formed and rehearsals for their first album took place in Pangbourne.

On 12 April 2024, the men&#x27;s section of the public toilets were officially opened by David Potts, standing in for the planned Joe Lycett.

==Governance==
Pangbourne is a civil parish with an elected parish council. The parish covers the immediate agricultural green buffer and a part wooded, part cultivated south-western area. The rural area contains no other significant settlements and includes Pangbourne College. The parish shares boundaries with the Berkshire parishes of Purley-on-Thames, Tidmarsh, Sulham, Bradfield and Basildon. Along the River Thames, to the north, there is also a boundary with the Oxfordshire parish of Whitchurch-on-Thames. The parish is in the area of the unitary authority of West Berkshire. The parish council and the unitary authority are responsible for different aspects of local government. Pangbourne forms part of the Reading West and Mid Berkshire parliamentary constituency. The parish is twinned with Houdan in France.

==Transport==
The village&#x27;s railway station is located on the Great Western Main Line and has stopping services to via , and to via .

==Pangbourne and District Silver Band==

The history of the Pangbourne Band began in 1893 when a fife and drum band used to rehearse in a shed behind the water mill, but when the First World War broke out the band broke up, re-forming in 1919 after the Armistice. Regular concerts were held from then until the outbreak of the Second World War, when many of the bandsmen served in the Armed Forces and the band again broke up and the instruments were held in storage. In 1962, Henry Fuller, a local tutor, started the village brass group. Local musicians became involved when the old instruments were recovered from storage, and the band was established as a full-size contesting brass band within a few years. In 2009, Pangbourne All-Comers&#x27; Band was begun, incorporating brass and, for parade days, drums and bell lyre glockenspiel.

<text>Alexander Roberts Dunn VC (15 September 1833 – 25 January 1868) was the first Canadian awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for bravery in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Later in life, he assisted in raising a regiment in Canada for the British Army. He was the first Canadian to command a British Army regiment.

Dunn died of a gunshot wound under mysterious circumstances in Abyssinia (now Eritrea), where he was part of the British Expedition to Abyssinia. His grave was re-discovered by Canadian Armed Forces troops who were part of the United Nations peacekeeping force to the Eritrea-Ethiopia war of 2000-2001.

== Family and early life==

Dunn was born in York, Upper Canada (later Toronto, Ontario) in 1833, the son of John Henry Dunn, Receiver General of Upper Canada, and studied at Upper Canada College. When his family returned to England, he attended Harrow School. In 1852 at the age of 19, he purchased a commission in a cavalry regiment in the British Army, the 11th Hussars (Prince Albert’s Own). Dunn was six feet, three inches tall, and commissioned a special four foot long sabre from Wilkinson Sword to accommodate his height.

== Charge of the Light Brigade and the Victoria Cross ==

Dunn was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions at the Charge of the Light Brigade during the Battle of Balaclava on 25 October 1854, when he was 21 years of age.

Lieutenant Dunn was actively engaged in the battle, leading his troops in the futile attempts to capture the Russian artillery. When the retreat was finally called, he saw that one of his troopers, Sergeant Robert Bentley, was in trouble. Bentley&#x27;s horse was badly wounded. Russian lancers had picked Bentley out as a straggler and were attacking him, trying to knock him out of the saddle. Dunn wheeled his horse and returned to Bentley&#x27;s aid. He killed two or three of the Russian soldiers, lifted Bentley back up on his horse, and slapped its rear to get it moving back to safety. Dunn then noticed that another soldier from his troop, Private Harvey Levett, had been dismounted and was being attacked by a Russian hussar. Dunn came to Levett&#x27;s aid, killing the Russian hussar with his lengthy sabre.

When he was finally back to safety, Dunn found that only 25 had survived from his troop of 110 cavalrymen. Dunn broke down and cried.

Queen Victoria instituted the Victoria Cross in 1856, for conspicuous acts of bravery by any member of the British military. The award was available for events from 1854 onwards, to include acts of bravery during the Crimean War, which began in late 1853. After the war, it was announced that the 11th Hussars could nominate a soldier to receive the Victoria Cross for his bravery. Dunn was the unanimous choice of the regiment. His name was on the list of the first group of recipients of the Victoria Cross, announced in February 1857.

On 26 June 1857, Queen Victoria presented the first sixty-two Victoria Crosses at an awards ceremony in Hyde Park, in front of a crowd of 100,000. Although Dunn by that time had left the 11th Hussars, he was amongst that group of the first recipients.

== Later military career ==
Dunn sold his commission at the end of the Crimean War, having conducted an affair with the wife of a fellow officer. She left her husband for Dunn. He returned to Canada in 1856, where he initially ran his family&#x27;s estate, north of Toronto, and joined a local Masonic lodge.

In 1857, the Indian Mutiny began. Dunn assisted in raising a regiment in Canada for the British Army, the 100th (Prince of Wales&#x27;s Royal Canadian) Regiment of Foot, which he joined with the rank of major. When the 100th Regiment was leaving for Britain, Dunn was presented with a sword which had been recently found on the Plains of Abraham, and was thought to have belonged to General Wolfe. After arriving in Britain, the 100th Regiment was sent to Gibraltar to act as garrison troops.

Dunn exchanged into the 33rd Regiment of Foot in 1864, as a lieutenant-colonel. He was promoted to the rank of colonel in 1866, the youngest colonel in the British Army. At the start of the British Expedition to Abyssinia in 1868, he was given the command of the 33rd Regiment, the first Canadian to command a British regiment, but was killed in unusual circumstances during a hunting accident at Senafe before the military part of the campaign started.

== Death in Abyssinia ==

The accounts of Dunn&#x27;s death vary. It occurred at the town of Senafe in Abyssinia (now Eritrea). The official version from the 33rd Regiment is that Dunn was holding his rifle and trying to uncork a brandy flask, when the rifle slipped between his legs and discharged into his chest. He told his servant to run for a doctor, but by the time help arrived, Dunn was dead. However, another version is that Dunn dismounted from his horse and sent his servant to get water for the horse. When the servant returned, Dunn was found dead, possibly a suicide. Still other rumours circulated, possibly of murder.

==Dunn&#x27;s grave==
Dunn was buried in a local cemetery in Senafe. The location was eventually forgotten, until the end of World War II. A British soldier, leading a patrol of Eritrean Mounted Police, came across a grown-over cemetery, but found that one gravesite had been cleaned and tended recently. It was Dunn&#x27;s grave. Soldiers of the occupying Italian forces had tended the grave, even though they were at war with the Canadian and British armies. The British sent a report to London, but it appears to have been lost for some decades.

Half a century later, the grave was re-discovered by Canadian peacekeeping soldiers, who were part of the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea during the Eritrean–Ethiopian War of 1998–2000. Ben Mitchell of the Canadian Armed Forces gave his account of the re-discovery:

After the re-discovery of the grave, a group of Canadian Forces engineers from CFB Gagetown repaired it in 2001.

== Legacy ==
In addition to the Victoria Cross, Dunn was also awarded the British Crimea Medal with four clasps, for the Battle of the Alma (1854), the Battle of Balaclava (1854), the Battle of Inkermann (1854), and the siege of Sevastopol (1854–1855). He also received the Turkish Crimean War Medal, and the British Abyssinian War Medal.

Dunn&#x27;s medals came on sale at Sotheby&#x27;s in 1894. The federal government authorised Sir Charles Tupper, the Canadian High Commissioner to Britain, to buy the medals. They were brought to Canada and eventually placed on display in the main foyer of his old school, Upper Canada College, in Toronto. In 1977, due to a number of recent thefts and losses of Victoria Cross medals, the school replaced the Victoria Cross with a copy and moved the original to their bank safe deposit box. In 
2006, Upper Canada College placed the medals on loan to the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa.

In 1894, one of Dunn&#x27;s fellow-officers from the 100th Royal Canadian Regiment of Foot sent three souvenirs back to Canada, including Dunn&#x27;s camp-stool from the Crimea. The camp-stool and Dunn&#x27;s sword are now also on display at the Canadian War Museum.

The City of Ottawa, assisted by Royal Canadian Legion Branch 638 (Kanata), created Alexander Dunn Park, dedicated to Dunn&#x27;s memory. The park is located on Bellrock Drive in Ottawa.

There is a memorial plaque dedicated to Dunn at Clarence Square in Toronto, near where Dunn was born.

<text>Lucian is a tiny lunar impact crater that is located in the northeastern part of the Mare Tranquillitatis. It was named in 1973 after 2nd century Greek writer Lucian of Samosata. The nearest named craters are Lyell to the east-southeast, Theophrastus to the northeast and Gardner to the north-northeast. A little farther to the north is Maraldi crater. Lucian was previously designated Maraldi B.

This is a circular, cone-shaped formation with a negligible interior floor. It has not been significantly degraded by impact erosion.

<doc id="1172493" wikidata="Q859557" url="?curid=1172493" title="Liberal Christianity">
<text>Liberal Christianity, also known as liberal theology and historically as Christian Modernism (see Catholic modernism and Fundamentalist–Modernist controversy), is a movement that interprets Christian teaching by prioritizing modern knowledge, science and ethics. It emphasizes the importance of reason and experience over doctrinal authority. Liberal Christians view their theology as an alternative to both atheistic rationalism and theologies based on traditional interpretations of external authority, such as the Bible or sacred tradition.

Liberal theology grew out of the Enlightenment&#x27;s rationalism and the Romanticism of the 18th and 19th centuries. By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it was characterized by an acceptance of Darwinian evolution, use of modern biblical criticism, and participation in the Social Gospel movement. This was also the period when liberal theology was most dominant within the Protestant churches. Liberal theology&#x27;s influence declined with the rise of neo-orthodoxy in the 1930s and with liberation theology in the 1960s. Catholic forms of liberal theology emerged in the late 19th century. By the 21st century, liberal Christianity had become an ecumenical tradition, including both Protestants and Catholics.

In the context of theology, &quot;liberal&quot; does not refer to political liberalism, and it should also be distinguished from progressive Christianity.

==Liberal Protestantism==
Liberal Protestantism developed in the 19th century out of a perceived need to adapt Christianity to a modern intellectual context. With the acceptance of Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of natural selection, some traditional Christian beliefs, such as parts of the Genesis creation narrative, became difficult to defend. Unable to ground faith exclusively in an appeal to scripture or the person of Jesus Christ, liberals, according to theologian and intellectual historian Alister McGrath, &quot;sought to anchor that faith in common human experience, and interpret it in ways that made sense within the modern worldview.&quot; Beginning in Germany, liberal theology was influenced by several strands of thought, including the Enlightenment&#x27;s high view of human reason and Pietism&#x27;s emphasis on religious experience and interdenominational tolerance.

The sources of religious authority recognized by liberal Protestants differed from conservative Protestants. Traditional Protestants understood the Bible to be uniquely authoritative (&quot;sola scriptura&quot;); all doctrine, teaching and the church itself derive authority from it. A traditional Protestant could therefore affirm that &quot;what Scripture says, God says.&quot; Liberal Christians rejected the doctrine of biblical inerrancy or infallibility, which they saw as the idolatry (fetishism) of the Bible. Instead, liberals sought to understand the Bible through modern biblical criticism, such as historical criticism, that began to be used in the late 1700s to ask if biblical accounts were based on older texts or whether the Gospels recorded the actual words of Jesus. The use of these methods of biblical interpretation led liberals to conclude that &quot;none of the New Testament writings can be said to be apostolic in the sense in which it has been traditionally held to be so&quot;. This conclusion made &quot;sola scriptura&quot; an untenable position. In its place, liberals identified the historical Jesus as the &quot;real canon of the Christian church&quot;.

German theologian William Wrede wrote that &quot;Like every other real science, New Testament Theology has its goal simply in itself, and is totally indifferent to all dogma and Systematic Theology&quot;. Theologian Hermann Gunkel affirmed that &quot;the spirit of historical investigation has now taken the place of a traditional doctrine of inspiration&quot;. Episcopal bishop John Shelby Spong declared that the literal interpretation of the Bible is heresy.

The two groups also disagreed on the role of experience in confirming truth claims. Traditional Protestants believed scripture and revelation always confirmed human experience and reason. For liberal Protestants, there were two ultimate sources of religious authority: the Christian experience of God as revealed in Jesus Christ and universal human experience. In other words, only an appeal to common human reason and experience could confirm the truth claims of Christianity.

In general, liberal Christians are not concerned with the presence of biblical errors or contradictions. 
Liberals abandoned or reinterpreted traditional doctrines in light of recent knowledge. For example, the traditional doctrine of original sin was rejected for being derived from Augustine of Hippo, whose views on the New Testament were believed to have been distorted by his involvement with Manichaeism. Christology was also reinterpreted. Liberals stressed Christ&#x27;s humanity, and his divinity became &quot;an affirmation of Jesus exemplifying qualities which humanity as a whole could hope to emulate&quot;.

Liberal Christians sought to elevate Jesus&#x27; humane teachings as a standard for a world civilization freed from cultic traditions and traces of traditionally pagan types of belief in the supernatural. As a result, liberal Christians placed less emphasis on miraculous events associated with the life of Jesus than on his teachings. The debate over whether a belief in miracles was mere superstition or essential to accepting the divinity of Christ constituted a crisis within the 19th-century church, for which theological compromises were sought. Some liberals prefer to read Jesus&#x27; miracles as metaphorical narratives for understanding the power of God. Not all theologians with liberal inclinations reject the possibility of miracles, but many reject the polemicism that denial or affirmation entails.

Nineteenth-century liberalism had an optimism about the future in which humanity would continue to achieve greater progress. This optimistic view of history was sometimes interpreted as building the kingdom of God in the world.

===Development===
The roots of liberal Christianity go back to the 16th century when Christians such as Erasmus and the Deists attempted to remove what they believed were the superstitious elements from Christianity and &quot;leave only its essential teachings (rational love of God and humanity)&quot;.

Reformed theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834) is often considered the father of liberal Protestantism. In response to Romanticism&#x27;s disillusionment with Enlightenment rationalism, Schleiermacher argued that God could only be experienced through feeling, not reason. In Schleiermacher&#x27;s theology, religion is a feeling of absolute dependence on God. Humanity is conscious of its own sin and its need of redemption, which can only be accomplished by Jesus Christ. For Schleiermacher, faith is experienced within a faith community, never in isolation. This meant that theology always reflects a particular religious context, which has opened Schleirmacher to charges of relativism.

Albrecht Ritschl (1822–1889) disagreed with Schleiermacher&#x27;s emphasis on feeling. He thought that religious belief should be based on history, specifically the historical events of the New Testament. When studied as history without regard to miraculous events, Ritschl believed the New Testament affirmed Jesus&#x27; divine mission. He rejected doctrines such as the virgin birth of Jesus and the Trinity. The Christian life for Ritschl was devoted to ethical activity and development, so he understood doctrines to be value judgments rather than assertions of facts. Influenced by the philosophy of Immanuel Kant, Ritschl viewed &quot;religion as the triumph of the spirit (or moral agent) over humanity&#x27;s natural origins and environment.&quot; Ritschl&#x27;s ideas would be taken up by others, and Ritschlianism would remain an important theological school within German Protestantism until World War I. Prominent followers of Ritschl include Wilhelm Herrmann, Julius Kaftan and Adolf von Harnack.

==Liberal Catholicism==

Catholic forms of theological liberalism have existed since the 19th century in England, France and Italy. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a liberal theological movement developed within the Catholic Church known as Catholic modernism. Like liberal Protestantism, Catholic modernism was an attempt to bring Catholicism in line with the Enlightenment. Modernist theologians approved of radical biblical criticism and were willing to question traditional Christian doctrines, especially Christology. They also emphasized the ethical aspects of Christianity over its theological ones. Important modernist writers include Alfred Loisy and George Tyrrell. Modernism was condemned as heretical by the leadership of the Catholic Church.

Sean O&#x27;Riordan refers to a liberal attitude as one of four schools of thought adopted among the bishops and other theologians at the Second Vatican Council: the liberal attitude, reflective of the mid-century Nouvelle théologie movement, was &quot;modern-minded, enterprising, [and] ready for new ventures of faith&quot;, opting for &quot;newness&quot; in many aspects of the pastoral life of the Church &quot;from top to bottom&quot;.

Papal condemnation of modernism and Americanism slowed the development of a liberal Catholic tradition in the United States. Since the Second Vatican Council, however, liberal theology has experienced a resurgence. Liberal Catholic theologians include David Tracy and Francis Schussler Fiorenza.

== Liberal Quakerism ==
In the 1820s, Quakerism, also known as the Religious Society of Friends, experienced a major schism called the Hicksite–Orthodox split. The Hicksites were led by Quaker minister Elias Hicks, who put a strong focus on listening to one&#x27;s inward light instead of a primary appeal to doctrine or creeds. Hicks went as far as to say that strictly holding to the Bible was damaging to believers and to Christianity as a whole. In addition to other distinctives, Hicks denied Satan as an external being and did not talk about an eternal Hell.

Hicksite-Quakerism, often called the Liberal branch, is today found most prominently in the Friends General Conference, but it also found in the centrist Friends United Meeting. Rather than holding to any firm statement of faith, Hicksite Quakers are led by the Inward Light as they believe it leads them. While Evangelist Quakers (see Gurneyite–Conservative split) were seen as holding to human reason, Liberal Quakers took a more spiritual and open approach. Liberal Quakers variably hold to Christian universalism, religious pluralism, progressive Christianity and other ideas not commonly held in conservative Christian circles.

==Influence in the United States==
Liberal Christianity was most influential with Mainline Protestant churches in the early 20th century, when proponents believed the changes it would bring would be the future of the Christian church. Its greatest and most influential manifestation was the Christian Social Gospel, whose most influential spokesman was the American Baptist Walter Rauschenbusch. Rauschenbusch identified four institutionalized spiritual evils in American culture (which he identified as traits of &quot;supra-personal entities&quot;, organizations capable of having moral agency): these were individualism, capitalism, nationalism and militarism.

Other subsequent theological movements within the U.S. Protestant mainline included political liberation theology, philosophical forms of postmodern Christianity, and such diverse theological influences as Christian existentialism (originating with Søren Kierkegaard and including other theologians and scholars such as Rudolf Bultmann and Paul Tillich) and even conservative movements such as neo-evangelicalism, neo-orthodoxy, and paleo-orthodoxy. Dean M. Kelley, a liberal sociologist, was commissioned in the early 1970s to study the problem, and he identified a potential reason for the decline of the liberal churches: what was seen by some as excessive politicization of the Gospel, and especially their apparent tying of the Gospel with Left-Democrat/progressive political causes.

The 1990s and 2000s saw a resurgence of non-doctrinal, theological work on biblical exegesis and theology, exemplified by figures such as Marcus Borg, John Dominic Crossan, John Shelby Spong, Karen Armstrong and Scotty McLennan.

<text>Lyell is a lunar impact crater that lies along the eastern edge of the Mare Tranquillitatis, at the northern arm of the bay designated Sinus Concordiae. It was named after Scottish geologist Charles Lyell. To the north along the edge of the lunar mare is the crater Franz. The region of terrain to the east of Lyell is named Palus Somni.

The outer rim of this crater is an irregular series of ridges in a roughly circular formation. There are multiple gaps through this rim, connected the interior to the mare in the west. The wall is at its thickest along the eastern side of the crater.

The interior floor has been resurfaced by lava, leaving a level, featureless surface that has no markings or impacts of note. The central region of the inner floor has a relatively low albedo compared to the surrounding terrain, giving it a dark appearance that matches the nearby mare.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Lyell.

The name &quot;Abduh&quot; was proposed for Lyell A, but this was not approved by the IAU.

<doc id="1172503" wikidata="Q1936" url="?curid=1172503" title="Djibril Cissé">
<text>Djibril Cissé (born 12 August 1981) is a French former professional footballer who played as a forward.

Cissé started his career at his boyhood club Arles-Avignon in 1989, before playing for the youth teams at Nîmes and Auxerre. Cissé spent two years in the youth system at Auxerre, before graduating to the first team in 1998. After playing for Auxerre for six seasons, scoring 90 goals in 166 appearances, he moved to Premier League club Liverpool in 2004.

During his time at Anfield, Cissé played 79 games, scoring 24 times and winning the 2004–05 UEFA Champions League and 2005–06 FA Cup. He went on to play in Greece with Panathinaikos, Italy with Lazio, Qatar with Al-Gharafa, Russia with Kuban Krasnodar and Switzerland with Yverdon Sport. He also had further spells in English football with Sunderland and Queens Park Rangers, and France with Marseille and Bastia. In 2015, Cissé made one appearance for Réunion based club Saint-Pierroise, before retiring from professional football. In the course of his career, Cissé suffered from two leg breaks, breaking his left leg in 2004, and his right leg in 2006.

Cissé played for the France national football team at the 2002 and 2010 FIFA World Cups, and was also part of &quot;les Bleus&quot;&#x27; 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup winning squad.

==Club career==
===Auxerre===
After starting his career with Nîmes, Cissé signed for Auxerre at the age of 15. Playing for the youth team in 1999, Cissé won the Coupe Gambardella, the equivalent of the FA Youth Cup. After being promoted to the first team squad by coach Guy Roux, Cissé made his Ligue 1 debut at the age of 17 as a substitute against Paris Saint-Germain on 20 March 1999. His first goal came at the start of the 2000–01 season in a 2–1 defeat of Metz. He ended this season, his first as a regular in the first team, with eight goals from 25 games.

In the 2001–02 season, Cissé was the top scorer in Ligue 1 with 22 goals from 29 matches, as Auxerre finished in third place and qualified for the 2002–03 UEFA Champions League. Cissé&#x27;s form saw him make his debut for the France national team and earn a place in the team&#x27;s squad for the 2002 FIFA World Cup.

Cissé was again amongst the league&#x27;s top scorers in 2002–03 with 14 goals. He also scored six goals in six matches in Auxerre&#x27;s successful Coupe de France campaign, including both goals in the semi-final defeat of Rennes and the equaliser in the 2003 Coupe de France Final victory over PSG.

2003–04 proved to be Cissé&#x27;s most successful goalscoring season, with 30 goals in all competitions, including 26 in Ligue 1 to win the golden boot for the second time.

Overall, Cissé scored 70 goals in 128 league games for Auxerre, before signing for Liverpool in a deal worth over £14 million in the summer of 2004.

===Liverpool===
At Liverpool, Cissé scored five goals in 24 first-team games in all competitions for Liverpool in the 2004–05 season. He had only played 19 games for Liverpool when a freak accident occurred while playing against Blackburn Rovers on 30 October 2004. While Cissé and Blackburn&#x27;s Jay McEveley were challenging for the ball, Cissé&#x27;s boot got caught in the turf and his leg snapped. This resulted in a broken tibia and fibula, and physio Daryl Martin said &quot;It could take six to nine months for a recovery and the absolute worst-case scenario is 18 months...&quot; Cissé later revealed that had it not been for prompt attention from the trainers at the stadium, he would probably have lost the leg below the knee. He had pins inserted in the leg, and was expected to be out of action for the rest of the 2004–05 season.

However, in an unexpected return, Cissé was able to come on as a 75th-minute substitute in the second leg of Liverpool&#x27;s Champions League quarter-final tie with Juventus on 13 April 2005. He went on to score both Liverpool goals in their last Premiership match of the season, a 2–1 win over Aston Villa and also converted a penalty in Liverpool&#x27;s penalty shootout win over AC Milan in the Champions League final. During the 2005–06 season, Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez deployed Cissé on the right wing on numerous occasions. While his pace made him well suited to such a role, it was doubtful whether he would be happy to continue in this role rather than in his preferred position as striker. He scored two goals as Liverpool won the 2005 UEFA Super Cup. Cissé also scored Liverpool&#x27;s opening goal in the 2006 FA Cup Final with a sliding shot past West Ham United keeper Shaka Hislop. Liverpool went on to win 3–1 on penalties. He ended the 2005–06 season with 19 goals in all competitions.

===Marseille===

From the summer of 2005, the media had linked Cissé with a move away from Anfield. Speculation intensified as the season went on. In early June 2006, it was reported that a transfer to Marseille had been agreed. The very same day, Cissé broke his leg during France&#x27;s final warm up match against China on 7 June 2006. It was thought that even though a relatively quick recovery was expected, Cissé&#x27;s transfer would be postponed until at least the January transfer window. However, the two teams agreed a loan deal in July 2006.

Cissé made his return to training on 20 October 2006, and scored his first goal for Marseille on 22 December 2006 when they beat Saint-Étienne 2–1. With only four goals in 14 appearances by April, Cissé&#x27;s performances were drawing such criticism that former player Jean-Pierre Papin urged Cissé&#x27;s critics to be more patient while the striker recovered from his career-threatening injury. Despite the slow start, Cissé managed to score 4 goals in his final 7 league appearances to finish with 8 goals in 21 league appearances, helping Marseille to finish 2nd in the 2006–07 season and guarantee a Champions League place for the 2007–08 season. On 12 May 2007, he scored two goals in the French Cup Final against Sochaux, although Marseille still lost the match 5–4 on penalties, after a 2–2 stalemate after extra time following a late equaliser by another Liverpool player on loan Anthony Le Tallec.

On 7 July 2007, Marseille&#x27;s president Pape Diouf announced that the club had struck a deal with Liverpool to sign Cissé permanently, for an estimated fee of €8 million. But subsequently, Cissé was linked with a return to the English Premier League with Blackburn Rovers, Wigan Athletic, Tottenham Hotspur, Portsmouth and Bolton Wanderers said to be interested. Manchester City had their approach for Cissé rejected by Marseille boss, who said, &quot;He is wanted, that is for sure, I myself have been approached by Manchester City (about Cissé), but I turned it down categorically&quot;. On 26 January 2008, Cissé scored a hat-trick in Marseille&#x27;s 6–1 win against Caen.

===Sunderland===
On 20 August 2008, Cissé secured a loan switch to Premier League club Sunderland. At the same ground where he had scored on his Liverpool debut, Cissé scored the winning header on his debut against Tottenham to make it 2–1 to Sunderland. A few days later, Cissé announced his desire to secure a permanent deal with the club. Manager Roy Keane also expressed his desire to sign Cissé, telling &quot;The News of the World&quot;: &quot;I&#x27;d be happy to break the transfer record if Djibril&#x27;s doing the business&quot;. In the Tyne-Wear derby, Cissé scored his third Sunderland goal on 25 October 2008, with Sunderland winning 2–1. After scoring in a 4–1 victory against Hull, Cissé stated that despite the departure of Roy Keane from Sunderland, he still wished to complete a permanent move to the club. On 18 April 2009, Cissé scored his tenth league goal of the season in a 1–0 victory over Hull City at the Stadium of Light. On 24 May, it was confirmed that Sunderland would not be taking up the option to sign Cissé permanently, and he subsequently returned to Marseille.

===Panathinaikos===
On 25 June 2009, Cissé signed a four-year contract with Panathinaikos. It was reported that the player would earn €2.5 million per year, while French club Marseille would get an estimated €8 million as a transfer fee. The total cost of the transfer is about €20 million, taking into account the various bonuses. He scored his first goal in Greece against Crete-based Ergotelis and soon he became the new leader of the team. He was the Superleague topscorer for the 2009–10, leading his team to win the double. In his first year in Greece, Cissé scored 23 goals in 28 matches.

<text>Rigas Feraios ( , sometimes &quot;Rhegas Pheraeos&quot;; ) or Velestinlis (Βελεστινλής , also transliterated &quot;Velestinles&quot;); 1757 – 24 June 1798), born as Antonios Rigas Velestinlis (), was a Greek writer, political thinker and revolutionary, active in the Modern Greek Enlightenment. A victim of the Balkan uprising against the Ottoman Empire and a pioneer of the Greek War of Independence, Rigas Feraios is today remembered as a national hero in Greece.

==Early life==
Rigas Feraios was born in 1757 as Antonios Rigas Velestinlis into a wealthy family in the village of Velestino in the Sanjak of Tirhala, Ottoman Empire (modern Thessaly, Greece). His father&#x27;s name is believed to have been originally Georgios Kyratzis or Kyriazis. He later was at some point nicknamed &quot;Pheraeos&quot; or &quot;Feraios&quot;, by scholars, after the nearby ancient Greek city of Pherae, but he does not seem ever to have used this name himself; he is also sometimes known as &quot;Konstantinos&quot; or &quot;Constantine Rhigas&quot; (). He is often described as being of Aromanian ancestry, with his native village of Velestino being predominantly Aromanian. Although his family usually overwintered in Velestino, it had its roots in Perivoli, another Aromanian-inhabited village. Rigas&#x27; grandfather Konstantinos Kyriazis or Kyratzis relocated with his family to Velestino which had been transformed into a Perivoli parish. Some historians state that Rigas was a Greek, as Leandros Vranoussis, who assumes that his Greek family was long-time residing in Velestino.

According to his compatriot Christoforos Perraivos, Rigas was educated at the school of Ampelakia, Larissa. Perhaps Rigas took lower education there, because it is historically documented that Rigas was educated at the upper school &quot;Ellinomouseion&quot; in the village of Zagora on the mountain Pelion, where it still exists the old building of this school and it is widely known in the region as the &quot;School of Riga&quot;. Later he became a teacher in the near to Zagora village of Kissos, and he fought the local Ottoman presence. At the age of twenty he killed an important Ottoman figure, and fled to the uplands of Mount Olympus, where he enlisted in a band of soldiers led by Spiros Zeras.


He later went to the monastic community of Mount Athos, where he was received by Cosmas, hegumen of the Vatopedi monastery; from there to Constantinople (Istanbul), where he became a secretary to the Phanariote Alexander Ypsilantis (1725–1805).

Arriving in Bucharest, the capital of Wallachia, Rigas returned to school, learned several languages and eventually became a clerk for the Wallachian Prince Nicholas Mavrogenes. When the Russo-Turkish War (1787–1792) broke out, he was charged with the inspection of the troops in the city of Craiova.

Here he entered into friendly relations with an Ottoman officer named Osman Pazvantoğlu, afterwards the rebellious Pasha of Vidin, whose life he saved from the vengeance of Mavrogenes. He learned about the French Revolution, and came to believe something similar could occur in the Balkans, resulting in self-determination for the Christian subjects of the Ottomans; he developed support for an uprising by meeting Greek Orthodox bishops and guerrilla leaders.

After the death of his patron Rigas returned to Bucharest to serve for some time as &quot;dragoman&quot; at the French consulate. At this time he wrote his famous Greek version of &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;, the anthem of French revolutionaries, a version familiar through Lord Byron&#x27;s paraphrase as &quot;sons of the Greeks, arise&quot;.

==In Vienna==
Around 1793, Rigas went to Vienna, the capital of the Holy Roman Empire and home to a large Greek community, as part of an effort to ask the French general Napoleon Bonaparte for assistance and support. 
While in the city, he edited a Greek-language newspaper, &quot;Efimeris&quot; (i.e. &quot;Daily&quot;), and published a proposed political map of &quot;Great Greece&quot; which included Constantinople and many other places, including a large number of places where Greeks were minority.

He printed pamphlets based on the principles of the French Revolution, including &quot;Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen&quot; and &quot;New Political Constitution of the Inhabitants of Rumeli, Asia Minor, the Islands of the Aegean, and the principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia&quot;—these he intended to distribute in an effort to stimulate a Pan-Balkan uprising against the Ottomans.

He also published Greek translations of three stories by Retif de la Bretonne, and many other foreign works, and he collected his poems in a manuscript (posthumously printed in Iaşi, 1814).

==Death==

He entered into communication with general Napoleon Bonaparte, to whom he sent a snuff-box made of the root of a Bay Laurel taken from a ruined temple of Apollo, and eventually he set out with a view to meeting the general of the Army of Italy in Venice. While traveling there, he was betrayed by Demetrios Oikonomos Kozanites, a Greek businessman, had his papers confiscated, and was arrested at Trieste by the Austrian authorities (an ally of the Ottoman Empire, Austria was concerned the French Revolution might provoke similar upheavals in its realm and later formed the Holy Alliance).

He was handed over with his accomplices to the Ottoman governor of Belgrade, where he was imprisoned and tortured. From Belgrade, he was to be sent to Constantinople to be sentenced by Sultan Selim III. While in transit, he and his five collaborators were strangled to prevent their being rescued by Rigas&#x27;s friend Osman Pazvantoğlu. Their bodies were thrown into the Danube River.

His last words are reported as being: &quot;I have sown a rich seed; the hour is coming when my country will reap its glorious fruits&quot;.

==Ideas and legacy==
Rigas, using demotikì (Demotic Greek) rather than puristic (Katharevousa) Greek, aroused the patriotic fervor of his Greek contemporaries. His republicanism was given an aura of heroism by his martyrdom, and set liberation of Greece in a context of political reform. As social contradictions in Ottoman Empire grew sharper in the tumultuous Napoleonic era the most important theoretical monument of Greek republicanism, the anonymous &quot;Hellenic Nomarchy&quot;, was written, its author dedicating the work to Rigas Ferraios, &quot;who had been sacrificed for the salvation of Hellas&quot;.

His grievances against the Ottoman occupation of Greece regarded its cruelty, the drafting of children between the ages of five and fifteen into military service (&quot;Devshirmeh&quot; or &quot;Paedomazoma&quot;), the administrative chaos and systematic oppression (including prohibitions on teaching Greek history or language, or even riding on horseback), the confiscation of churches and their conversion to mosques.

Rigas wrote enthusiastic poems and books about Greek history and many became popular. One of the most famous (which he often sang in public) was the &quot;Thourios&quot; or battle-hymn (1797), in which he wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s finer to live one hour as a free man than forty years as a slave and prisoner&quot; («Καλύτερα μίας ώρας ελεύθερη ζωή παρά σαράντα χρόνια σκλαβιά και φυλακή»).

In &quot;Thourios&quot; he urged the Greeks (Romioi) and other Orthodox Christian peoples living at the time in the area of Greece (Arvanites/Albanians, Bulgarians, etc.) and generally in the Balkans, to leave the Ottoman-occupied towns for the mountains, where they could find freedom, organize and fight against the Ottoman tyranny. His call included also the Muslims of the empire, who disagreed and reacted against the Sultan&#x27;s governance.

It is noteworthy that the word &quot;Greek&quot; or &quot;Hellene&quot; is not mentioned in &quot;Thourios&quot;; instead, Greek populations are still referred to as &quot;Romioi&quot; (i.e. Romans, citizens of the Christian or Eastern Roman Empire), which is the name that they proudly used for themselves at that time.

Statues of Rigas Feraios stand at the entrance to the University of Athens and in Belgrade at the beginning of the street that bears his name (&quot;Ulica Rige od Fere&quot;). The street named after Rigas Feraios in Belgrade was the only street in Belgrade named after a non-Serb until World War I.

&quot;Rigas Feraios&quot; was also the name taken by the youth wing of the Communist Party of Greece (Interior), and a split of this youth wing was &quot;Rigas Feraios - Second Panhellenic&quot;.

His political vision was influenced by the French Constitution (i.e. democratic liberalism) 

Feraios&#x27; portrait was printed on the obverse of the Greek ₯200 banknote of 1996–2001. A ₯50 commemorative coin was issued in 1998 for the 200th anniversary of his death. His portrait appears on the Greek 10 lepta (cent) euro coin.

== In popular culture ==
Nikos Xydakis and Manolis Rasoulis wrote a song called &quot;Etsi pou les, Riga Feraio&quot; (Έτσι που λες, Ρήγα Φεραίο; &quot;That&#x27;s how it is, Rigas Feraios&quot;), which was sung by Rasoulis himself. Also, composer Christos Leontis wrote music based upon the lyrics of &quot;Thourio&quot; and Cretan Nikos Xylouris performed the song in the 1970s.

<text>Computronium is a material hypothesized by Norman Margolus and Tommaso Toffoli of MIT in 1991 to be used as &quot;programmable matter&quot;, a substrate for computer modeling of virtually any real object.

It also refers to an arrangement of matter that is the best possible form of computing device for that amount of matter. In this context, the term can refer both to a theoretically perfect arrangement of hypothetical materials that would have been developed using nanotechnology at the molecular, atomic, or subatomic level (in which case this interpretation of computronium could be unobtainium), and to the best possible achievable form using currently available and used computational materials.

According to the Barrow scale, a modified variant of the Kardashev scale created by British physicist John D. Barrow, which is intended to categorize the development stage of extraterrestrial civilizations, it would be conceivable that advanced civilizations do not claim more and more space and resources, but optimize their already available space increasingly, for example by building a matrioshka brain consisting of several layers of computronium around their star.

In the 2010 film &quot;The Singularity Is Near: A True Story About the Future&quot;, American futurist Ray Kurzweil discusses a universe filled with computronium. He believes this could be possible as early as the late 22nd century and would be accomplished by sending intelligent nanobots through the universe faster than light, e.g. by using wormholes. According to him, such an endeavor would have the potential to prevent the natural ending of the universe.

In addition, the term computronium is used in connection with science fiction narratives.

<text>Ross is a lunar impact crater that is located in the northwest part of the Mare Tranquillitatis. It was named after James Clark Ross (British explorer) and Frank E. Ross (American astronomer and optician). It lies south-southwest of the crater Plinius, and northeast of the lava-flooded Maclear.

This crater has a generally circular shape, but is not quite symmetrical. The inner walls slope down to a base of slumped material, before joining a relatively level interior floor. There is a low ridge to the west of the crater midpoint.
==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Ross.

<doc id="1172521" wikidata="Q10987672" url="?curid=1172521" title="Club good">
<text>Club goods (also artificially scarce goods, toll goods, collective goods or quasi-public goods) are a type of good in economics, sometimes classified as a subtype of public goods that are excludable but non-rivalrous, at least until reaching a point where congestion occurs. 
Often these goods exhibit high excludability, but at the same time low rivalry in consumption. Thus, club goods have essentially zero marginal costs and are generally provided by what is commonly known as natural monopolies.
Furthermore, club goods have artificial scarcity. Club theory is the area of economics that studies these goods.
One of the most famous provisions was published by Buchanan in 1965 &quot;An Economic Theory of Clubs,&quot; in which he addresses the question of how the size of the group influences the voluntary provision of a public good and more fundamentally provides a theoretical structure of communal or collective ownership-consumption arrangements.

==Definition matrix==

==Where club goods are found==
Examples of club goods include cinemas, cable television, software as a service, access to copyrighted works, and the services provided by social or religious clubs to their members. The EU is also treated as a club good, since the services it provides can be excluded from non-EU member states, but several services are nonrival in consumption. These include the free movement of goods, services, persons and capital within the Internal Market, and participation in a common currency: for example, adding extra countries to the Schengen Area would not make it more difficult for citizens of current EU members to move between countries.

Public goods with benefits restricted to a specific group may be considered club goods. For example, expenditures that benefit all of the children in a household but not the adults. The existence of club goods for children may offset the effects of sibling competition for private investments in larger families. While a large number of children in a family would usually reduce private investment ratios per child, due to competition for resources, the effects of a larger family on club goods are not as straightforward. As a result of economies of scale, investment ratios in club goods may eventually increase, since the relative price decreases when, in this example, a larger family consumes a club good. They are called child-specific goods and can also be referred to as club goods.

Specific examples for private club goods are memberships in gyms, golf clubs, or swimming pools. Both organisations generate additional fees per use. For example, a person may not use a swimming pool very regularly. Therefore, instead of having a private pool, you become member of a club pool. By charging membership fees, every club member pays for the pool, making it a common property resource, but still excludable, since only members are allowed to use it. Hence, the service is excludable, but it is nonetheless nonrival in consumption, at least until a certain level of congestion is reached. The idea is that individual consumption and payment is low, but aggregate consumption enables economies of scale and drives down unit production costs.
==Club theory==
James M. Buchanan developed club theory (the study of club goods in economics) in his 1965 paper, &quot;An Economic Theory of Clubs&quot;. He found that in neo-classical economic theory and theoretical welfare economics is exclusively about private property and all goods and services are privately consumed or utilized. Just over the last two decades before his provision in 1965, scholars started to extend the theoretical framework and communal or collective ownership-consumption arrangements were considered as well.

Paul A. Samuelson made an important provision in this regard, making a sharp conceptual distinction between goods that are purely private and goods that are purely public. While it extended the previously existing theoretical framework, Buchanan found that there was still a missing link that would cover the whole spectrum of ownership consumption possibilities. This gap contained goods that were excludable, shared by more people than typically share a private good, but fewer people than typically share a public good. The whole spectrum would cover purely private activities on one side and purely public or collectivized activities on the other side. Therefore, according to Buchanan, a theory of clubs needed to be added to the field.

The goal of his theory was to address the question of determining the &quot;size of the most desirable cost and consumption sharing arrangement&quot;.

The model was based on the assumptions that individuals have similar preferences for both private and public goods, the size of the club good and equal sharing of costs. The economic theory of clubs further tries to answer the undersupply equilibrium of a public good provision. Provision of club goods may sometimes pose an alternative to public good provisions by the federal or central government. An issue of club theory is that it may not result in equal and democratic distribution of the good eventually due to its excludability characteristic. James M. Buchanan was primarily interested in voluntary clubs. In these cases club good theory can critically assess how to achieve an optimal number of members of a club as well as the maximum utility for club members.

Examples of private goods that Buchanan offered to illustrate this concept were hair cuts and shoes. Two people can&#x27;t wear the same exact pair of shoes at the same time, but two or more people can take turns wearing them. As the number of people sharing the same pair of shoes increases, the amount of utility each person derives from the shoes diminishes.
For the case of service, like a haircut, the same logic applies. Sharing a haircut means, one-half haircut per month is consumed, or half a physical unit of service. Therefore, the utility for the person deriving from the service declines.

Using the example of a swimming pool facility, James M. Buchanan states that:

But each new member (or co-owner) helps reduce the cost of the club good, so there will be some optimal size of the good that maximizes the benefit for its members.

In the 90s Richard Cornes and Todd Sandler came up with three conditions to determine the optimal club size, which were based at equating costs and benefits at the margin.
Firstly, the provision condition which requires determination of the benefits to members from reducing congestion costs and set them in comparison to the cost of capacity. 
Secondly a utilisation condition, which requires an efficient use of the capacity. Here the user fees equate the members marginal benefit from consumption and the congestion costs the member&#x27;s participation imposes on others. If the fee is set too low, the club&#x27;s capacity will be overused, if the fee is too high the capacity will be underutilized. Hence, the club good must be priced in a way that reflects members preferences for crowding.

The third condition is that new members are added to the club, until the marginal benefit from additional membership is equal to the marginal congestion costs.

Because of the three conditions, there is usually a two-part pricing of club goods. One is the fixed up-front membership fees and the other is the per unit charge to achieve an optimal utilisation. In the case of a pure public good, like political lobbying a two-part pricing is not feasible, but a club can provide selective incentives, also called Member-only privileges, like subscribing to the club&#x27;s magazine or journal. Since clubs compete for members, as long as clubs can be closed freely and members are free to exit, prices for clubs will be in line with costs. The free exit option prevents clubs from charging prices that are too high, but incentivizes free-riding. Members understate their benefits, reduce their effort they supply towards achieving the club&#x27;s collective goals and take advantage of other club members.

The theory of clubs has been intensively applied to the realm of international alliances. Olson and Zeckhauser (1967) published a cost-sharing analysis of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). In particular they identify the conditions under which it would be in the interest of the club members to increase the size of NATO. According to them every members pay contribution fees, based on their specific marginal values. Therefore, costs shares are computed based on the club&#x27;s total costs and group size. They point out that the United States is by far the largest contributor to NATO and by that to the collective goal of the institution. The question raised is whether the differences in membership contribution are reasonable given each country&#x27;s valuation of the provided good by the alliance. Otherwise, the distribution of cost shares is unjust and several member states are free riding.

<doc id="1172526" wikidata="Q2244889" url="?curid=1172526" title="Love Child (song)">
<text>&quot;Love Child&quot; is a 1968 song released by the Motown label for Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes. The second single and title track from their album &quot;Love Child&quot;, it became the Supremes&#x27; 11th number-one single in the United States, where it sold 500,000 copies in its first week and 2 million copies by year&#x27;s end.

The record took just three weeks to reach the Top Ten of &quot;Billboard[[Love Child (song)|s Hot 100]] pop chart, which eventually it topped for two weeks (issues dated November 30 and December 7, 1968), before being dethroned by an even bigger Motown single, [[Marvin Gaye]]&#x27;s &quot;[[I Heard It Through the Grapevine]]&quot;. &quot;Love Child&quot; also performed well on the soul chart — where it spent three weeks at no. 2 (behind [[Johnnie Taylor]]&#x27;s &quot;[[Who&#x27;s Making Love]]&quot;) — and paved new ground for a major pop hit with its then-controversial subject matter of [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimacy]]. It is also the single that finally knocked [[the Beatles]]&#x27; &quot;[[Hey Jude]]&quot; off the top spot in the United States after its nine-week run. The Supremes debuted the dynamic and intense song on the season premiere of the [[CBS]] [[variety show|variety]] [[television programme|program]] &quot;[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]&quot; on Sunday, September 29, 1968. In &quot;Billboards special 2015 chart of the Top 40 Biggest Girl Groups of All Time on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, &quot;Love Child&quot; ranked highest among the Supremes&#x27; six entries.

==History==

===Recording===
In 1967, Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes dropped Florence Ballard, engaged new member Cindy Birdsong and added Ross&#x27;s name to the billing. Following this string of changes, the Supremes had mixed success on the pop charts. &quot;Reflections&quot; peaked at no. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot 100 and &quot;In and Out of Love&quot; peaked at 9, but the group&#x27;s next two singles did not reach the Top 20.

This prompted Motown label chief Berry Gordy to hold a special meeting in a room at the Pontchartrain Hotel in Detroit, which was attended by a team of writers and producers at the label, including R. Dean Taylor, Frank Wilson, Pam Sawyer, Deke Richards, and Henry Cosby. The group, calling themselves the Clan, set to work on a hit single for Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes. Instead of composing another love-based song, the team decided to craft a tune about a woman who is asking her boyfriend not to pressure her into sleeping with him, for fear they would conceive a &quot;love child&quot;. The woman, portrayed on the record by Diana Ross, is herself a love child, and, besides not having a father at home, had to endure wearing rags to school and growing up in an &quot;old, cold, run-down tenement slum.&quot; The background vocals echo this sentiment, asking the boyfriend to please &quot;wait/wait won&#x27;t you wait now/hold on/wait/just a little bit longer.&quot;

As was nearly always the case on singles released under the &quot;Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes&quot; name, Supremes members Mary Wilson and Cindy Birdsong do not perform on the record; Motown session singers The Andantes performed the background vocals. All lead vocals were by Diana Ross, who would leave the group in a year for a solo career.

===Reaction and response===
The public responded immediately to &quot;Love Child&quot; when it was released as a single on September 30, 1968, reaching number one on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Hot 100 and becoming the third biggest selling Supremes&#x27; single behind &quot;Baby Love&quot; and &quot;Someday We&#x27;ll Be Together.&quot; The feat was repeated in Canada, where it also reached number one in the &quot;RPM 100&quot; national singles chart. In the UK singles chart, the record peaked at no. 15, and no. 3 in Australia. Given that the single spent a then lengthy 11 weeks in the Top Ten of &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot 100 (the longest of any Supremes hit), its 1968 year-end ranking of 27 is low-seeming. But the ranking, which covers the period up to and including the issue dated December 14, 1968, is based on only nine of its 16 weeks on the Hot 100 (and four of the unused seven weeks were spent in the Top Ten). The track&#x27;s parent LP &quot;Love Child&quot; was released on November 13, 1968.

&quot;Cash Box&quot; said that &quot;Diana Ross clicks with a contemporary narrative message which (accompanied by up-tempo beat and pop arrangements) open up a new top forty image for the act.&quot;

* It was covered in 1990 by Sweet Sensation. Their cover peaked at number 13 in May 1990 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

==Use in popular culture==
In 1992, World Industries released a skateboard video entitled &quot;Love Child&quot;. The soundtrack for the video consisted entirely of music from the late 1960s era (unusual for a skateboard video); the featured segment with Daewon Song was set to &quot;Love Child&quot; and after that, &quot;One Bad Apple&quot; by The Osmonds. To this day &quot;Love Child&quot; is considered one of the best skateboard videos ever made.

Taken from the 1993 album &quot;Janet.&quot;, the 1994 single &quot;You Want This&quot; by Janet Jackson opens with a prominent sample of the first bar of &quot;Love Child&quot;.

In 1996, a foreign version of the song known as &quot;Halila&quot;, performed by the artist Laladin, was featured in the Demi Moore film &quot;Striptease&quot;.

In 2003, the song was featured prominently in &quot;The Wire&quot; episode &quot;Backwash&quot;.

In 2010 Korean-born American professional skateboarder Daewon Song recreated the first part of his &quot;Love Child&quot; run trick-for-trick for a DVS Shoes promotional video.

In 2016, &quot;Love Child&quot; was featured on the in-game radio in &quot;Mafia III&quot;.

<text>Sömmering is the lava-flooded remains of a lunar impact crater on the eastern edge of the Mare Insularum. It was named after German doctor Samuel Thomas von Sömmerring. To the southeast is the crater Mösting, and north of Sömmering lies a similar flooded crater designated Schröter. A rille designated Rima Schröter runs from the southeast of Schröter towards the east of Sömmering&#x27;s outer rim.

The western rim of this crater forms a slender arcing rise on the lunar mare, with a wide gap to the south and a narrow gap in the north. The eastern rim is much thicker in girth, and resembles a curved ridge. The interior floor is level and nearly featureless. The open southern end of this crater overlaps the lunar equator.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Sömmering.

<doc id="1172545" wikidata="Q1470712" url="?curid=1172545" title="Nailbomb">
<text>Nailbomb is a heavy metal band formed in 1993 as a side project by Brazilian musician Max Cavalera (then the frontman of Sepultura) and British musician Alex Newport of Fudge Tunnel. They played a combination of primarily industrial metal and thrash metal. The band recorded one studio album, &quot;Point Blank&quot;, and played a warmup live performance and their only official gig for 29 years at the 1995 Dynamo Open Air Festival two days later, after which the band disbanded. The band reunited for the first time in 29 years in Tempe, Arizona in November 2024.

==History==
Nailbomb hosted other musicians to play guest spots, including D.H. Peligro (Dead Kennedys), Max Cavalera&#x27;s brother Igor Cavalera (Sepultura co-founder), and guitarist Dino Cazares (co-founder and guitarist of Fear Factory). Nailbomb&#x27;s second album, &quot;Proud to Commit Commercial Suicide&quot;, was a live recording capturing the band&#x27;s appearance at the 1995 Dynamo Open Air Festival in Eindhoven, the Netherlands.

The project was largely defunct for over two decades, with no intention of the band ever reuniting or releasing any new material, until Cavalera announced in April 2017 he would play the entire &quot;Point Blank&quot; album on tour with his band Soulfly. Newport was not involved in the performances, citing his busy schedule as the reason. Instead, Cavalera drafted his son Igor Cavalera Jr., who had previously toured as a bassist and backing vocalist for Soulfly, to perform Newport&#x27;s vocal and keyboard/sampler parts.

On August 14, 2024, Max Cavalera announced that Nailbomb would reunite for its first show in 29 years as part of the &quot;Max Cavalera Dynasty Show&quot;, which took place at the Marquee Theatre in Tempe, Arizona on November 9. In addition to Cavalera, the lineup for this show was his son Igor and Travis Stone both on guitar, bassist Johny Chow, sampler Alex Cha and drummer Adam Jarvis. In early November 2024, it was announced Nailbomb would be playing the Alcatraz festival in Kortrijk, Belgium in August 2025.

<text>WVTM-TV (channel 13) is a television station in Birmingham, Alabama, United States, affiliated with NBC. Owned by Hearst Television, the station maintains studios and transmitter facilities atop Red Mountain, between Vulcan Trail and Valley View Drive in southeastern Birmingham, adjacent to the Vulcan Statue and next to the studios of Fox affiliate WBRC (channel 6).

==History==
===Early history===
The station first signed on the air on May 29, 1949, as WAFM-TV, originally carrying a limited schedule of local programming. The station began carrying select network programming on July 1, operating as a primary CBS and secondary ABC affiliate; channel 13 began carrying an expanded schedule of programming from ABC and CBS on October 1. It was originally owned by The Voice of Alabama, Inc., along with radio stations WAPI (1070 AM), and WAFM (then at 93.3, now WJOX-FM at 94.5 FM). It is the longest continuously operating television station in Alabama. During the summer of 1949, most programs aired by WAFM-TV aired during the daytime hours, allowing radio electronics and department stores to demonstrate television set receivers to potential customers. In January 1953, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved an application to increase the station&#x27;s transmitter power from 26,000 to 316,000 watts.

In July 1953, &quot;The Birmingham News&quot; bought the Voice of Alabama and changed the station&#x27;s call letters to WABT (for &quot;Alabama&#x27;s Best Television&quot;). The following year on July 4, 1954, WABT traded primary network affiliations with WBRC-TV (channel 6) and joined NBC; however it retained a secondary affiliation with ABC as did WBRC-TV, which took over the CBS affiliation as its then-new owners, Storer Broadcasting, had a strong relationship with the network (the company&#x27;s founder and chairman, George B. Storer, was a member of the board of directors at CBS). On January 26, 1956, newspaper publishing company Newhouse Newspapers (now Advance Publications) purchased the &quot;News&quot;. The station changed its call letters again in 1958 to WAPI-TV (for Alabama Polytechnic Institute [now known as Auburn University], which owned WAPI radio from 1925 to 1932) to match its sister AM radio station; WAFM-FM adopted the WAPI-FM calls at the same time, and received FCC permission to move its frequency to 94.5 FM.

Channel 13 also became known for its heavy schedule of local programs during the 1950s and 1960s, most notably two popular shows aimed at younger audiences hosted by two early staples of Birmingham television. Magician Cliff Holman hosted a children&#x27;s program on the station for 15 years from 1954 to 1968; originally debuting in March 1954 as &quot;The Tip Top Clubhouse&quot; (named after the Ward Baking Company&#x27;s Tip Top Bread brand), the afternoon cartoon showcase featured Holman—who previously served as the voice and puppeteer of Mr. Bingle, a marionette character originated in 1949 by City Stores of New York, for a Loveman&#x27;s-sponsored holiday series that aired on WAFM-TV in November 1950—in the persona of &quot;Cousin Cliff&quot; (which was given to him by Ward executives as the then-25-year-old was too young to fit the &quot;uncle&quot; image then common among other children&#x27;s show hosts), and underwent three format and title changes between 1956 and 1958, first as &quot;Cliff&#x27;s Clubhouse&quot; (after Ward Baking withdrew sponsorship due to corporate difficulties) and then as &quot;Cartoon Clubhouse&quot; and later, &quot;The Popeye Show&quot;, after WAPI acquired the local rights to the Fleischer Studios animated shorts. In 1969, Holman left WAPI after station management relegated &quot;Popeye&quot; to weekend mornings, after ratings declined following the show&#x27;s move to weekday mornings and a switch to a pre-recorded format; he revived his program at WHMA-TV (channel 40, now WGWW) in Anniston later that year, as &quot;The Cousin Cliff Show&quot;. Benny Carle hosted &quot;Western Theatre&quot;, a showcase of western films interspersed with studio segments with local children as part of its studio audience that aired from 1953 to 1954, when Carle left to take over Bob Bandy&#x27;s role as host the similarly formatted &quot;Circle Six Ranch&quot; on WBRC-TV, where he remained until 1964.

WBRC-TV became a full-time ABC affiliate on September 7, 1961, although it continued to occasionally carry certain CBS shows that WAPI chose not to carry until 1965. The WBRC deal with ABC—which was also a result of the strong relations between the network and WBRC&#x27;s owner, Taft Television and Radio Company, which acquired that station in 1957—forced WAPI-TV to shoehorn both NBC and CBS programs onto its programming schedule. This was rather unusual, since in most two-station markets, ABC (which would not be on equal footing with CBS and NBC until the early 1970s) was typically relegated to a secondary affiliation on either one or both of the existing television stations. The Birmingham market then (as it is now) was a fairly large market geographically, stretching across nearly the entire width of the state from near the Alabama–Mississippi state line eastward to the Alabama–Georgia state line. The market also has areas of fairly rugged terrain—particularly in the eastern part of the state, which lies within the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains—which often created impairment issues with the over-the-air reception of UHF television stations. Both of these factors made prospective broadcasters skittish about launching a television station on one of the available UHF allocations. Although there were two other VHF channels in the market (channels 7 and 10), both had been allocated to Alabama Educational Television (now Alabama Public Television). This came after George Storer&#x27;s company donated the two frequencies and accompanying transmitters to the Alabama Educational Television Commission (which were respectively signed on WCIQ and WBIQ on those channels in 1955) in a move that may have been an attempt to forestall future commercial competition in the market. As a result, while Birmingham had been large enough in terms of population to support three full network affiliates since the 1950s, it had a long wait for full-time service from all three networks.

The Birmingham market would not get a third commercial broadcast television outlet until WBMG-TV (channel 42, now WIAT) began in October 1965. Although WBMG nominally had a CBS affiliation, the network allowed WAPI-TV to continue airing its higher-rated programs. This was largely because WBMG had launched only one year after the FCC&#x27;s All-Channel Receiver Act went into law, requiring that television sets manufactured from 1964 onward include all-channel tuning; relatively few households in the area at the time had sets with built-in UHF tuning capability, or expensive converter boxes that enabled older television sets to pick up UHF signals. Compounding things, channel 42 operated at a comparatively low effective radiated power, producing a signal that was considerably weaker than that of either WAPI-TV or WBRC-TV. To fill out its schedule, WBMG aired some NBC programs that WAPI-TV turned down or otherwise had no room to broadcast on its schedule (such as &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;). Both stations listed &quot;CBS/NBC&quot; as their affiliation, as WBMG maintained a nominal secondary affiliation with the latter network. On April 3, 1967, WAPI-TV became the first television station in Birmingham to broadcast all of its programming in color, having acquired camera, projection and slide equipment to broadcast local and acquired programming in the format, in addition to carrying NBC and CBS programs available in color.

In May 1970, WAPI-TV became the exclusive NBC affiliate for Birmingham, simultaneously resulting in the CBS programs not already carried by that station moving to WBMG. The switch to an exclusive NBC affiliation was because two of Newhouse Broadcasting&#x27;s other stations, WSTM-TV in Syracuse and WETM-TV in Elmira, New York (which were then WSYR-TV [not to be confused with the current WSYR] and WSYE-TV respectively), were already affiliated with the network; in addition, the company&#x27;s chairman was alleged to not have a great personal relationship with CBS president William S. Paley. At the same time that WAPI and WBMG aligned with the respective networks, WCFT-TV (channel 33, now Heroes &amp; Icons affiliate WSES) in Tuscaloosa and WHMA-TV (channel 40, later WJSU-TV and now Heroes &amp; Icons affiliate WGWW) in Anniston, two UHF stations respectively serving the western and eastern portions of Central Alabama, also became full-time affiliates of CBS; like WBMG and WAPI prior to becoming exclusive network affiliates, WCFT and WHMA—both of which signed on the air in the late 1960s—started as affiliates of both CBS and NBC. Prior to that time, the prime time schedules of the Tuscaloosa and Anniston stations virtually mirrored that of WBMG, because of WAPI&#x27;s exclusive rights to network programming shown on that station for the entire viewing area.

Newhouse exited the broadcasting industry in the early 1980s to focus exclusively on its newspaper holdings. In 1979, the company sold its television stations, including WAPI-TV, to the Los Angeles-based Times Mirror Company; the WAPI radio stations were sold to Dittman Broadcasting. Following the completion of the sale, the station, due to an FCC rule in place at the time that stated that TV and radio stations in the same market, but with different ownership had to have differing call letters, changed its call letters to WVTM-TV (for &quot;Vulcan Times Mirror&quot;; the &quot;V&quot; referencing both the cast-iron statue in Vulcan Statue as well as its location atop Red Mountain at Vulcan Park, where WVTM&#x27;s transmitter tower was located) on March 28, 1980.

===New World Communications and NBC ownership===
In March 1993, Times Mirror sold WVTM, along with its three sister stations (ABC affiliate KTVI in St. Louis, and CBS affiliates KDFW in Dallas and KTBC in Austin, Texas) to Argyle Television Holdings in a two-part deal. Under the structure, WVTM and KTVI were the first two stations to be sold to New World, which respectively bought the stations for $45 million and $35 million; the purchase of the entire group was completed in December of that year following securement of financing for the deal.

In May 1994, New World Communications, which would sign an affiliation deal with Fox on May 22, agreed to purchase the four outlets from Argyle – in a deal structured as a purchase option – for $717 million. However two weeks earlier on May 5, New World also decided to purchase four television stations from Great American Communications, among them WBRC, for $350 million in cash and $10 million in share warrants. New World was able to finalize its purchase of WBRC on October 12, 1994, because the transfer applications for the Argyle stations were not submitted to the FCC until after those involved in the purchase of the Citicasters (to which Great American Communications was subsequently renamed) stations was already finalized.

However, WBRC and fellow ABC affiliate WGHP in High Point, North Carolina were immediately placed in an outside trust company as Citicasters restructured its plans for both stations and decided to sell them directly to Fox&#x27;s owned-and-operated station group, Fox Television Stations, once it discovered New World&#x27;s plan to purchase the Argyle stations (both purchases conflicted with two aspects of the FCC&#x27;s media ownership regulations; the purchases of WBRC and WVTM would have violated rules that prohibited a single company from owning both the #1 and the #2 television stations in the same market, plus both group deals would have given New World three more stations than the agency allowed at the time under its 12-station national television ownership limit). In January 1995, while the group awaited the Argyle purchase to receive approval by the FCC, New World took over the operations of the Argyle stations, including WVTM, through time brokerage agreements. The transfers of WBRC and WGHP to the trust were completed on April 3, 1995, while the New World purchase of the Argyle stations closed on April 14. New World&#x27;s purchase of the remaining three Argyle stations was finalized on April 18, 1995.

As a result of New World&#x27;s option to sell WBRC to Fox, WVTM retained its NBC affiliation (KNSD in San Diego was the only other New World station that remained with NBC, as Fox already had a VHF affiliate in San Diego at the time, XETV (which eventually became a CW affiliate but is now a Canal 5 station targeting Tijuana, Mexico), whereas KNSD broadcast on the UHF band; the group sold its only other station not affected by the Fox affiliation deal, WSBK-TV in Boston, to the Paramount Stations Group in November 1994); KTVI, KDFW and KTBC, meanwhile, all became Fox affiliates. Fox Television Stations operated WBRC as an ABC affiliate until August 31, 1996, as its contract with that network had one year left until its expiration when Fox formally purchased the station from the trust (WBRC&#x27;s conversion into a Fox owned-and-operated station on September 1, 1996, led to a six-station affiliation swap in Central Alabama in which WCFT-TV and WJSU-TV became satellite stations of ABC affiliate low-power W58CK (channel 58, now WBMA-LD); Fox affiliate WNAL-TV (channel 44, now Ion Television owned-and-operated station WPXH-TV) in Gadsden took over as eastern Alabama&#x27;s CBS affiliate and Fox affiliate WTTO (channel 21) and its Tuscaloosa satellite WDBB (channel 17) became independent stations).

On May 22, 1996, New World Communications announced that it would sell WVTM and KNSD to NBC&#x27;s owned-and-operated station group, NBC Television Stations, for $425 million. This deal came two months prior to then-Fox parent News Corporation&#x27;s acquisition of New World on July 17, in an all-stock transaction worth $2.48 billion, in which it would acquire New World&#x27;s remaining twelve Fox-affiliated stations (which would also become owned-and-operated stations of the network); The sale of WVTM and KNSD to NBC was finalized in July 1996. In November 1996, the station changed its on-air branding from &quot;Alabama&#x27;s 13&quot; (which it adopted in 1991) to &quot;NBC 13&quot;.

===Media General ownership===
On January 9, 2006, NBC Television Stations announced that it would place four of its smaller-market owned-and-operated stations—WVTM, WJAR-TV in Providence, Rhode Island, WCMH-TV in Columbus, and WNCN in Raleigh, North Carolina—up for sale. On April 6, 2006, NBC Universal and Media General announced that the latter would purchase WVTM-TV as part of a $600 million four-station deal between the two companies. Due to clauses in the FCC&#x27;s regulations for television duopolies that prohibits any broadcasting company from owning two of the four highest-rated television stations within the same media market, Media General subsequently announced that it would it seek a buyer for its existing station in the Birmingham–Tuscaloosa–Anniston market, WIAT (which it had owned since the group&#x27;s merger with Park Communications in 1997, and was instrumental in that station becoming more competitive with WVTM and WBRC), choosing to keep WVTM, which at the time was the higher-rated of the two stations in terms of total day viewership.

The FCC subsequently granted the company a temporary waiver of its ownership rules that allowed it to keep both WVTM and WIAT for six months after the purchase of the former was completed; Media General&#x27;s purchase of all four stations was finalized on June 26, 2006. On August 2, Media General announced that it had sold WIAT and fellow CBS affiliate KIMT in Mason City, Iowa, to New Vision Television for $35 million; that sale was finalized on October 12, 2006. Under Media General, WVTM retained its existing &quot;NBC 13&quot; branding until 2009, when it restored &quot;Alabama&#x27;s 13&quot; as its on-air branding.

===Hearst Television ownership===
On March 21, 2014, LIN Media entered into an agreement to merge with Media General in a $1.6 billion deal. Because LIN already owned CBS affiliate WIAT, due to the same FCC duopoly restrictions based on total day viewership that prompted Media General to sell WIAT to New Vision eight years earlier, the companies were required to sell either WVTM-TV or WIAT to another station owner in order to comply with the agency&#x27;s ownership rules; the sales that Media General and LIN voluntarily chose to conduct in that situation were also in response to planned changes to the FCC&#x27;s media ownership regulations, which would prohibit sharing agreements involving two or more television stations in the same market.

On August 20, 2014, Media General announced that it would reacquire WIAT and sell WVTM, along with WJCL in Savannah, Georgia, to Hearst Television. Media General completed its merger with LIN on December 19; Hearst closed on its purchase of WVTM and WJCL three days later on December 22. In March 2015, WVTM phased in Hearst&#x27;s standardized station imaging, and dropped the &quot;Alabama&#x27;s 13&quot; brand for the second time, in favor of branding by its call letters as &quot;WVTM 13&quot;, similar to other Hearst-owned stations.

==Programming==
WVTM-TV carries the entire NBC programming schedule, although it airs the network&#x27;s weekend overnight lineup on a one-hour tape delay due to paid and syndicated programming. Syndicated programming broadcast by WVTM-TV () includes &quot;Matter of Fact with Soledad O&#x27;Brien&quot; (which is produced by parent company Hearst Television), &quot;Tamron Hall&quot;, &quot;The Jennifer Hudson Show&quot; and &quot;The Kelly Clarkson Show&quot;.

While channel 13 tried to carry the most popular NBC and CBS shows, a lot of fairly popular programs aired by either network were never seen in the Birmingham market because of this arrangement (even though WAPI carried selected CBS and NBC network programs in a 4½-hour block preceding its late-evening newscast, which then aired at 11 p.m.), and the lack of a third station to carry the remaining programs. One of the more popular CBS shows that WAPI-TV did not air was &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, which resulted in Central Alabama viewers missing The Beatles&#x27; debut American performance on the variety series in February 1964, unless they were lucky enough to be able to get reception of CBS&#x27; affiliates in the adjacent markets of Atlanta (WAGA-TV, now a Fox owned-and-operated station), Huntsville (WHNT) or Montgomery (WCOV-TV, now a Fox affiliate). On a similar note, one of the NBC shows that channel 13 turned down was &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, which WBMG aired instead until WAPI began clearing the program in September 1969; even then, due to the expanded prime time scheduling under the dual-network arrangement with CBS and NBC, it delayed &quot;Tonight&quot; to 11:30 p.m.

WAPI-TV strongly favored NBC for national news programming; as a byproduct of this, when CBS and NBC expanded their early-evening news programs to 30 minutes in 1963, the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; with Walter Cronkite did not air in Birmingham for the next two years. This was due, of course, to the fact that both networks fed their newscasts to their affiliates at 5:30 p.m. Central Time (as they continue to do today). Channel 13 aired its local newscast at 6 p.m., and prior to the passage of the Prime Time Access Rule by the FCC in 1971, prime time network programming began at 6:30 p.m. Central Time. This left no available room on WAPI&#x27;s schedule to allow it to air the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;, even if station management had wanted to broadcast it, clearing only &quot;The Huntley–Brinkley Report&quot; in its normal time slot (&quot;Huntley–Brinkley&quot; was the only network evening newscast that was televised in Birmingham from 1963 to 1965, as WBRC-TV did not carry ABC&#x27;s evening newscasts during that period).

During the 1970s, WAPI ran a distant second to WBRC in local news and general viewership, but was far ahead of WBMG, which was one of the lowest-rated commercial television stations in the U.S. at the time. It was only in western and eastern Alabama that the CBS affiliates, WCFT and WHMA, were competitive against WBRC and WAPI, particularly in local newscasts designed specifically for those areas of the state. After it exclusively aligned with NBC, channel 13 chose to fill the now-vacated 10 p.m. hour with off-network syndicated reruns to serve as a lead-in to its late newscast, which itself would move to 10 p.m. in 1977; however, the station continued to delay &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; by one hour in favor of running syndicated programming until September 1993, when it moved the program to its network-standard 10:35 slot.

==News operation==
WVTM-TV presently broadcasts hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with seven hours each weekday, four hours on Saturdays and hours on Sundays).

===News department history===
Channel 13 launched the first full-scale television news department in Alabama in 1951. For most of the last half of the 20th century, channel 13&#x27;s newscasts were a solid, if usually distant, runner-up to long-dominant WBRC. This remained the case even during the second half of the 1980s, despite having the benefit of NBC&#x27;s powerful prime time programming lineup of that period (which included such series as &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;, &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; and &quot;The A-Team&quot;) as a lead-in to its 10 p.m. newscast.

However, after WBMA-LP replaced WBRC as the market&#x27;s ABC affiliate in September 1996, WVTM had to fend off a spirited challenge from the upstart station (to which it lost two of its well-known anchors, Pam Huff and Tracy Haynes, who were later hired to anchor that station&#x27;s morning newscasts). Since the start of the new millennium, it has also had to contend with a resurgent WIAT, whose news ratings prior to the February 1998 relaunch of its news department had generally languished at a very distant fourth place for much of its history up to that point. Indeed, since 2006, WIAT has consistently beaten WVTM in the late news ratings. In contrast to WIAT&#x27;s renewed performance under Media General ownership, ratings averages for WVTM&#x27;s newscasts slipped to fourth place among the market&#x27;s five major television news operations (ahead of WVUA-CD (channel 7) and behind WBMA-LD and WIAT) during the company&#x27;s ownership of channel 13, where it remains to this day.

In 2004, WVTM began utilizing a Doppler weather radar system originally branded as &quot;Skywatch Doppler One Million&quot; (which was later renamed &quot;WeatherPlus Doppler One Million&quot; and later named &quot;Alabama&#x27;s 13 Live Doppler&quot; which is located on Bald Rock Mountain in St. Clair County; the radar provided live Doppler radar data from the Bald Rock Mountain site at a radiated power of 1 million watts, but it is no longer in use by the station. The station also utilizes data from National Weather Service radar sites nationwide. In 2017, WVTM constructed a new dual pole Doppler radar in western Tuscaloosa County in Vance, Alabama, known as &quot;WVTM 13 Live Doppler Radar&quot;. On October 17, 2007, WVTM-TV became the first television station in the state of Alabama to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition.

After Hearst Television purchased the station in 2014, WVTM-TV has shifted its programming focus more heavily towards local news. First on August 18, 2014, the station expanded its weekday morning newscast to 4 a.m. and expanded its 11 a.m. newscast to one hour, canceling the Media General-mandated advertorial program &quot;Daytime Alabama&quot; in the latter part of the half-hour; Hearst generally has refused to produce advertorial lifestyle programming for any of their stations or advertisers. This was followed three weeks later on September 8 by the launch of an hour-long late afternoon newscast at 4 p.m. On April 27, 2015, the station expanded its 6 p.m. newscast to one hour, ending &quot;Alabama Tonight&quot;, another Media General-mandated program that had eventually taken on a sports focus after the failure of its original format which stunted the station&#x27;s ratings leading into prime time.

===Notable former on-air staff===
* Sophia Choi – weekend morning anchor (1991–1996; now at WSB-TV in Atlanta)
* Cliff Holman (&quot;Cousin Cliff&quot;) – children&#x27;s program host (1954–1969; later at WJSU-TV; deceased)
* James Spann – meteorologist (1979–1983; now at WBMA-LD)
* Rene Syler – weekend anchor (1990–1992; later at KTVT in Dallas–Fort Worth then at CBS as host of &quot;The Early Show&quot;)
* Charlie Van Dyke – station announcer (now announcer for rival WBRC)

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

In September 2004, WVTM-TV launched a digital subchannel on virtual channel 13.2, as a charter affiliate of NBC Weather Plus; after the network formally ceased operations on November 30, 2008, it was replaced by NBC Plus, a localized default feed of the network that replaced Weather Plus on most of its affiliates. In January 2008, Media General reached an agreement with Equity Media Holdings to affiliate WVTM with the Retro Television Network; the station began carrying the network on its second digital subchannel on May 1, 2009. WVTM replaced the Retro Television Network with MeTV on 13.2 on September 26, 2011, as part of a groupwide affiliation agreement with Media General and Weigel Broadcasting (under that deal, MeTV replaced RTV on some Media General-owned stations in other markets).

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
In November 2002, WVTM-TV signed on its digital television signal on UHF channel 52. The station shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 13, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 52, which was among the high band UHF channels (52–69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition, to its former analog-era VHF channel 13 for post-transition operations. WVTM was one of more than ten television stations around the country that requested for a power increase due to problems with the reception of VHF digital signals in areas within their markets of service following the transition. The station then moved back to channel 13 for its post-transition operations. The July 2, 2020, repack moved the station to RF channel 7.

<doc id="1172559" wikidata="Q4431834" url="?curid=1172559" title="List of UK Albums Chart number ones of the 2000s">
<text>The UK Albums Chart is a weekly record chart based on album sales from Sunday to Saturday in the United Kingdom; during the 2000s, a total of 274 different albums by 170 artists reached number one. The chart was compiled weekly by the Official Charts Company (OCC) on behalf of the British music industry—it listed only physical album sales until 2007, after which it also included albums sold digitally. The OCC defined an &quot;album&quot; to be any music release that featured more than four tracks or lasted longer than 25 minutes. Each week&#x27;s new number one was first announced on Sunday evenings by BBC Radio 1 on their weekly chart show.

The most successful albums during the 2000s were &quot;Life for Rent&quot; by Dido and &quot;Back to Bedlam&quot; by James Blunt. Released in 2003 and 2004 respectively, each spent ten weeks at number one—&quot;Back to Bedlam&quot; was also the biggest-selling album of the decade. Dido and Blunt also topped the chart with one other album each. Irish boy band Westlife reached number one with seven different releases, the most of any act. British singer Robbie Williams released six number one albums, which spent a total of 23 weeks on the top of the chart, longer than any other artist—by 2005, Williams had sold more albums during the 2000s than any other act.

The most successful record label during this period was Polydor Records—benefitting from strong sales from artists such as Ronan Keating, Scissor Sisters and Take That, Polydor topped the chart with 13 different albums which spent 33 weeks at number one, longer than any other company. Columbia Records released 17 albums that reached number one, the most of any label; its artists roster featured Barbra Streisand and Bruce Springsteen. In August 2003, &quot;Magic and Medicine&quot; by The Coral became the 700th album to top the UK chart—fewer than four years later, &quot;Not Too Late&quot; by Norah Jones became the 800th album to do so.

Following its significantly increased popularity in the early 21st century, reality television began to have a significant impact on the British music industry. Of the 274 albums that reached number one in the UK charts, 15 were by artists that had found fame through a reality TV programme. The first such act was Hear&#x27;Say, a British pop group formed by the television show &quot;Popstars&quot;. In March 2001, their debut album &quot;Popstars&quot; topped the chart and became the fastest-selling debut in UK chart history to that date. The only reality television stars to top the album chart with two different releases were Will Young, the 2002 winner of &quot;Pop Idol&quot;, Girls Aloud, the girl group formed by the TV series &quot;&quot;, and Leona Lewis, the 2006 winner of &quot;The X Factor&quot;. Like Hear&#x27;Say, Lewis&#x27;s first album &quot;Spirit&quot; broke the record for the fastest-selling debut in UK chart history.

==Number ones==

===By artist===
Eight artists spent 10 weeks or more at number one on the album chart during the 2000s.
===By record label===
Eight record labels spent 20 weeks or more at number one on the album chart during the 2000s.
==Christmas number ones==
In the UK, Christmas number one albums are those that are at the top of the UK Albums Chart on Christmas Day. Typically, this will refer to the album that was announced as number one on the Sunday before 25 December—when Christmas Day falls on a Sunday itself, the official number one is considered by the OCC to be the one announced on that day&#x27;s chart. During the 2000s, the following albums were Christmas number ones.

<doc id="1172561" wikidata="Q4973586" url="?curid=1172561" title="Bromborough Dock">
<text>Bromborough Dock was situated on the River Mersey at Bromborough, on the Wirral Peninsula, England. 
Owned by the manufacturer Lever Brothers (and its successor Unilever), it served the company&#x27;s factory at Port Sunlight. The facility was once the largest private dock in the world.

Consent for its construction was given by the Bromborough Dock Act 1923. Officially opened on 17 April 1931, it replaced a smaller dock and wharf built at Bromborough Pool in 1895. Located at the mouth of the Pool, the new dock allowed for larger ocean-going vessels to berth. The dock was provided with a link to the Birkenhead Railway as part of the Lever Brothers private railway network, which remained fully operational until 1969.

The dock handled a wide variety of cargoes during its lifetime, including: paper, timber, animal and plant oils and fats (resin, tallow, palm oil and copra). Lever Brothers used its own fleet of barges and coasters to transport goods to and from other docks on the River Mersey and to the company&#x27;s other factory site at Warrington via the Manchester Ship Canal. Other tenants on the Lever industrial estate also made use of the dock&#x27;s facilities.
During the Second World War, Bromborough Dock was utilised as an alternative shipping berth to Liverpool and Birkenhead Docks, which were very congested and often damaged by enemy action. It was also used for the construction of Maunsell army forts, offshore anti-aircraft towers which were placed in Liverpool Bay.

By the 1980s, a gradual decline in goods traffic precipitated the decision to close the dock. This occurred following the passing of the Bromborough Dock Act 1986 in September 1986. Most of the site was used for landfill between 1991 and 2006. Since the cessation of waste disposal operations, the area has been landscaped into a public park called Port Sunlight River Park which opened in August 2014.

<text>Turner is a small lunar impact crater that lies in the Mare Insularum, near the Moon&#x27;s equator. The crater was named after British astronomer Herbert Hall Turner. It is located to the southeast of the crater Gambart. Turner is a circular, cone-shaped crater with inner walls that slope down to the midpoint. A similar-sized ghost crater is attached to the western rim, its interior floor submerged by lava and the surviving rim broken in the southwest.
==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Turner.

<text>Ukert is a lunar impact crater that lies on a strip of rugged ground between Mare Vaporum to the north and Sinus Medii in the south. It was named after German historian Friedrich August Ukert. It is located to the north-northwest of the crater Triesnecker and northeast of the crater pair of Pallas and Murchison.

The outer rim of this crater is not quite circular, with outward bulges to the north and the east. The interior floor is irregular in places, with a central ridge running from crater midpoint down to the southern wall. There is a tiny craterlet along the northern rim, but otherwise the crater contains no impacts of note.

Ukert is a crater of Lower (Early) Imbrian age.

<doc id="1172577" wikidata="Q209630" url="?curid=1172577" title="Herschel Space Observatory">
<text>The Herschel Space Observatory was a space observatory built and operated by the European Space Agency (ESA). It was active from 2009 to 2013, and was the largest infrared telescope ever launched until the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope in 2021. Herschel carries a mirror and instruments sensitive to the far infrared and submillimetre wavebands (55–672 μm). Herschel was the fourth and final cornerstone mission in the Horizon 2000 programme, following &quot;SOHO&quot;/&quot;Cluster II&quot;, &quot;XMM-Newton&quot; and &quot;Rosetta&quot;.

The observatory was carried into orbit by an Ariane 5 in May 2009, reaching the second Lagrangian point (L2) of the Earth–Sun system, from Earth, about two months later. Herschel is named after Sir William Herschel, the discoverer of the infrared spectrum and planet Uranus, and his sister and collaborator Caroline Herschel.

The observatory was capable of seeing the coldest and dustiest objects in space; for example, cool cocoons where stars form and dusty galaxies just starting to bulk up with new stars. The observatory sifted through star-forming clouds—the &quot;slow cookers&quot; of star ingredients—to trace the path by which potentially life-forming molecules, such as water, form.

The telescope&#x27;s lifespan was governed by the amount of coolant available for its instruments; when that coolant ran out, the instruments would stop functioning correctly. At the time of its launch, operations were estimated to last 3.5 years (to around the end of 2012). It continued to operate until 29 April 2013 15:20 UTC, when &quot;Herschel&quot; ran out of coolant.

NASA was a partner in the Herschel mission, with US participants contributing to the mission; providing mission-enabling instrument technology and sponsoring the NASA Herschel Science Center (NHSC) at the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center and the Herschel Data Search at the Infrared Science Archive.

==Development==
In 1982 the Far Infrared and Sub-millimetre Telescope (FIRST) was proposed to ESA. The ESA long-term policy-plan &quot;Horizon 2000&quot;, produced in 1984, called for a &quot;High Throughput Heterodyne Spectroscopy&quot; mission as one of its cornerstone missions. In 1986, FIRST was adopted as this cornerstone mission. It was selected for implementation in 1993, following an industrial study in 1992–1993. The mission concept was redesigned from Earth-orbit to the Lagrangian point L2, in light of experience gained from the Infrared Space Observatory [(2.5–240 μm) 1995–1998]. In 2000, FIRST was renamed Herschel. After being put out to tender in 2000, industrial activities began in 2001. Herschel was launched in 2009.

The Herschel mission cost . This figure includes spacecraft and payload, launch and mission expenses, and science operations.

==Science==
Herschel specialised in collecting light from objects in the Solar System as well as the Milky Way and even extragalactic objects billions of light-years away, such as newborn galaxies, and was charged with four primary areas of investigation:
* Galaxy formation in the early universe and the evolution of galaxies;
* Star formation and its interaction with the interstellar medium;
* Chemical composition of atmospheres and surfaces of Solar System bodies, including planets, comets and moons;
* Molecular chemistry across the universe.

During the mission, Herschel &quot;made over 35,000 scientific observations&quot; and &quot;amass[ed] more than 25,000 hours&#x27; worth of science data from about 600 different observing programs&quot;.

==Instrumentation==
The mission involved the first space observatory to cover the full far infrared and submillimetre waveband. At , Herschel carried the largest optical telescope ever deployed in space. It was made not from glass but from sintered silicon carbide. The mirror&#x27;s blank was manufactured by Boostec in Tarbes, France; ground and polished by Opteon Ltd. in Tuorla Observatory, Finland; and coated by vacuum deposition at the Calar Alto Observatory in Spain.

The light reflected by the mirror was focused onto three instruments, whose detectors were kept at temperatures below . The instruments were cooled with over of liquid helium, boiling away in a near vacuum at a temperature of approximately . The supply of helium on board the spacecraft was a fundamental limit to the operational lifetime of the space observatory; it was originally expected to be operational for at least three years.

Herschel carried three detectors:

; PACS (Photodetecting Array Camera and Spectrometer): An imaging camera and low-resolution spectrometer covering wavelengths from 55 to 210 micrometres, which was designed and built by the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics. The spectrometer had a spectral resolution between R=1000 and R=5000 and was able to detect signals as weak as −63 dB. It operated as an integral field spectrograph, combining spatial and spectral resolution. The imaging camera was able to image simultaneously in two bands (either 60–85/85–130 micrometres and 130–210 micrometres) with a detection limit of a few millijanskys.


; SPIRE (Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver): An imaging camera and low-resolution spectrometer covering 194 to 672 micrometre wavelength. The spectrometer had a resolution between R=40 and R=1000 at a wavelength of 250 micrometres and was able to image point sources with brightnesses around 100 millijanskys (mJy) and extended sources with brightnesses of around 500 mJy. The imaging camera had three bands, centred at 250, 350 and 500 micrometres, each with 139, 88 and 43 pixels respectively. It was able to detect point sources with brightness above 2 mJy and between 4 and 9 mJy for extended sources. A prototype of the SPIRE imaging camera flew on the BLAST high-altitude balloon. NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., developed and built the &quot;spider web&quot; bolometers for this instrument, which is 40 times more sensitive than previous versions. The &quot;Herschel-SPIRE&quot; instrument was built by an international consortium comprising more than 18 institutes from eight countries, of which Cardiff University was the lead institute.

; HIFI (Heterodyne Instrument for the Far Infrared): A heterodyne detector able to electronically separate radiation of different wavelengths, giving a spectral resolution as high as R=107. The spectrometer was operated within two wavelength bands, from 157 to 212 micrometres and from 240 to 625 micrometres. SRON Netherlands Institute for Space Research led the entire process of designing, constructing and testing HIFI. The HIFI Instrument Control Center, also under the leadership of SRON, was responsible for obtaining and analysing the data.
NASA developed and built the mixers, local oscillator chains and power amplifiers for this instrument. The &quot;NASA Herschel Science Center&quot;, part of the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center at the California Institute of Technology, also in Pasadena, has contributed science planning and data analysis software.

==Service module==
A common service module (SVM) was designed and built by Thales Alenia Space in its Turin plant for the Herschel and &quot;Planck&quot; missions, as they were combined into one single program.

Structurally, the Herschel and &quot;Planck&quot; SVMs are very similar. Both SVMs are of octagonal shape and, for both, each panel is dedicated to accommodate a designated set of warm units, while taking into account the heat dissipation requirements of the different warm units, of the instruments, as well as the spacecraft.

Furthermore, on both spacecraft a common design has been achieved for the avionics systems, attitude control and measurement systems (ACMS), command and data management systems (CDMS), power subsystems and the tracking, telemetry, and command subsystem (TT&amp;C).

All spacecraft units on the SVM are redundant.

===Power subsystem===
On each spacecraft, the power subsystem consists of the solar array, employing triple-junction solar cells, a battery and the power control unit (PCU). It is designed to interface with the 30 sections of each solar array, provide a regulated 28 V bus, distribute this power via protected outputs and to handle the battery charging and discharging.

For Herschel, the solar array is fixed on the bottom part of the baffle designed to protect the cryostat from the Sun. The three-axis attitude control system maintains this baffle in direction of the Sun. The top part of this baffle is covered with optical solar reflector (OSR) mirrors reflecting 98% of the Sun&#x27;s energy, avoiding heating of the cryostat.

===Attitude and orbit control===
This function is performed by the attitude control computer (ACC) which is the platform for the ACMS. It is designed to fulfil the pointing and slewing requirements of the Herschel and &quot;Planck&quot; payload.

The Herschel spacecraft is three-axis stabilized. The absolute pointing error needs to be less than 3.7 arc seconds.

The main sensor of the line of sight in both spacecraft is the star tracker.

==Launch and orbit==

The spacecraft, built in the Cannes Mandelieu Space Center, under Thales Alenia Space Contractorship, was successfully launched from the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana at 13:12:02 UTC on 14 May 2009, aboard an Ariane 5 rocket, along with the Planck spacecraft, and placed on a very elliptical orbit on its way towards the second Lagrangian point. The orbit&#x27;s perigee was 270.0 km (intended ), apogee 1,197,080 km (intended ), inclination 5.99 deg (intended ).

On 14 June 2009, ESA successfully sent the command for the cryocover to open which allowed the PACS system to see the sky and transmit images in a few weeks. The lid had to remain closed until the telescope was well into space to prevent contamination.

Five days later the first set of test photos, depicting M51 Group, was published by ESA.

In mid-July 2009, approximately sixty days after launch, it entered a halo orbit of 800,000 km average radius around the second Lagrangian point (L2) of the Earth-Sun system, 1.5 million kilometres from the Earth.

==Discoveries==

On 21 July 2009, Herschel commissioning was declared successful, allowing the start of the operational phase. A formal handover of the overall responsibility of Herschel was declared from the programme manager Thomas Passvogel to the mission manager Johannes Riedinger.

Herschel was instrumental in the discovery of an unknown and unexpected step in the star forming process. The initial confirmation and later verification via help from ground-based telescopes of a vast hole of empty space, previously believed to be a dark nebula, in the area of NGC 1999 shed new light in the way newly forming star regions discard the material which surround them.

In July 2010 a special issue of &quot;Astronomy and Astrophysics&quot; was published with 152 papers on initial results from the observatory.

A second special issue of &quot;Astronomy and Astrophysics&quot; was published in October 2010 concerning the sole HIFI instrument, due its technical failure which took it down over 6 months between August 2009 and February 2010.

It was reported on 1 August 2011, that molecular oxygen had been definitively confirmed in space with the Herschel Space Telescope, the second time scientists have found the molecule in space. It had been previously reported by the Odin team.

An October 2011 report published in &quot;Nature&quot; states that Herschel measurements of deuterium levels in the comet Hartley 2 suggests that much of Earth&#x27;s water could have initially come from cometary impacts. On 20 October 2011, it was reported that oceans-worth of cold water vapor had been discovered in the accretion disc of a young star. Unlike warm water vapor, previously detected near forming stars, cold water vapor would be capable of forming comets which then could bring water to inner planets, as is theorized for the origin of water on Earth.

On 18 April 2013, the Herschel team announced in another &quot;Nature&quot; paper that it had located an exceptional starburst galaxy which produced over 2,000 solar masses of stars a year. The galaxy, termed HFLS3, is located at &quot;z =&quot; 6.34, originating only 880 million years after the Big Bang.

Just days before the end of its mission, ESA announced that Herschel observations had led to the conclusion that water on Jupiter had been delivered as a result of the collision of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 in 1994.

On 22 January 2014, ESA scientists using Herschel data reported the detection, for the first definitive time, of water vapor on the dwarf planet, Ceres, largest object in the asteroid belt. The finding is unexpected because comets, not asteroids, are typically considered to &quot;sprout jets and plumes&quot;. According to one of the scientists, &quot;The lines are becoming more and more blurred between comets and asteroids.&quot;

==End of mission==

On 29 April 2013, ESA announced that Herschel supply of liquid helium, used to cool the instruments and detectors on board, had been depleted, thus ending its mission. At the time of the announcement, Herschel was approximately 1.5 million km from Earth. Because Herschel orbit at the L2 point is unstable, ESA wanted to guide the craft on a known trajectory. ESA managers considered two options:

*Place Herschel into a heliocentric orbit where it would not encounter Earth for at least several hundred years.
*Guide Herschel on a course toward the Moon for a destructive high-speed collision that would help in the search for water at a lunar pole. Herschel would take about 100 days to reach the Moon.

The managers chose the first option because it was less costly.

On 17 June 2013, Herschel was fully deactivated, with its fuel tanks forcibly depleted and the onboard computer programmed to cease communications with Earth. The final command, which severed communications, was sent from European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) at 12:25 UTC.

The mission&#x27;s post-operations phase continued until 2017. The main tasks were consolidation and refinement of instrument calibration, to improve data quality, and data processing, to create a body of scientifically validated data.

=== After Herschel ===

Following Herschel demise, some European astronomers have pushed for the joint European-Japanese SPICA far-infrared observatory project, as well as ESA&#x27;s continued partnership in NASA&#x27;s James Webb Space Telescope. James Webb covers the near-infrared spectrum from 0.6 to 28.5 μm, and SPICA covers the mid-to-far-infrared spectral range between 12 and 230 μm. While Herschel dependence on liquid helium coolant limited the design life to around three years, SPICA would have used mechanical Joule-Thomson coolers to sustain cryogenic temperatures for a longer period of time. SPICA&#x27;s sensitivity was to be two orders of magnitude higher than Herschel.

NASA&#x27;s proposed Origins Space Telescope (OST) would also observe in the far-infrared band of light. Europe is leading the study for one of OST&#x27;s five instruments, the Heterodyne Receiver for OST (HERO).

<text>Whewell is a lunar impact crater that lies on a stretch of lava-resurfaced terrain to the west of Mare Tranquillitatis. Its diameter is 13 km. It was named after the 19th-century English philosopher and naturalist, William Whewell. It is located to the east of the disintegrated crater Tempel and north-northwest of D&#x27;Arrest. To the east is Cayley, a slightly larger but very similar formation. To the North lies the Rima Ariadaeus, which is a linear rille that is 300 kilometers long and was formed when a section of the Moon&#x27;s crust sank down between two parallel fault lines, producing a graben. Further north again, lies the 90 km wide crater Julius Caesar.

This is a circular, bowl-shaped crater with interior walls that slope down gently to a small interior floor. This crater has not been significantly eroded, and the rim is well-defined.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Whewell.

<text>Arthur Jermy Mounteney Jephson (1859–1908) was an English merchant seaman and army officer. He became an adventurer and African explorer, who accompanied H. M. Stanley on the Emin Pasha Relief Expedition, 1887–1889.

==Emin Pasha Relief Expedition==

Jephson&#x27;s diary from the expedition was published half a century after his death, and provides a record of the late Victorian African expeditions, of which this expedition was to be the last.

<doc id="1172592" wikidata="Q7304920" url="?curid=1172592" title="Red Rock Pass (Idaho)">
<text>Red Rock Pass is a low mountain pass in the western United States in southeastern Idaho, located in southern Bannock County, south of Downey. It is geologically significant as the spillway of ancient Lake Bonneville. It is traversed by U.S. Route 91 at an elevation of above sea level, bounded by two mountain ranges; the Portneuf to the east and the Bannock to the west.
The pass was cut through resistant Paleozoic shale, limestone, and dolomite, and forms a narrow gap in length.
At one time the pass was higher, where the shoreline of Pleistocene Lake Bonneville stood.

The pass takes its name from the red limestone cliffs which border it. Red Rock Pass has a surface deposit of calcareous silty alluvium with topsoil of dark grayish brown silt loam.

==Bonneville flood==

It is believed that during the last ice age lava flows in the vicinity of Pocatello began to divert the Bear River through Lake Thatcher and then into Lake Bonneville. This sudden influx caused Bonneville to overflow at Red Rock about 14,500 years ago. This overflow caused a sudden erosion of unconsolidated material on the northern shoreline near Red Rock Pass. As the material gave way, Marsh Creek Valley, immediately downstream, was flooded from wall to wall, and the rapid discharge eroded the pass to its present level. The flood then flowed into the Snake River Plain, generally following the path of the present-day Snake River to its outlet in the Pacific Northwest.

The Bonneville flood, as it is known, was a catastrophic event. The maximum discharge was about 15 million cubic feet per second (420,000 m³/s), or about three times the average flow of the Amazon River, the world&#x27;s largest river, and almost 180 times the average flow rate of Niagara Falls (85,000 cfs). The speed of flow was approximately , and though peak flow lasted only a few days, voluminous discharges may have continued for at least a year.

<text>The coat of arms of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] was originally adopted in 1815 and later modified in 1907. The arms are a composite of the arms of the former Dutch Republic and the arms of the House of Nassau, it features a checkered shield with a lion grasping a sword in one hand and a bundle of arrows in the other and is the heraldic symbol of the monarch (King Willem-Alexander) and the country. The monarch uses a version of the arms with a mantle () while the government of the Netherlands uses a smaller version without the mantle (cloak) or the pavilion, sometimes only the shield and crown are used (). The components of the coats of arms were regulated by Queen Wilhelmina in a royal decree of 10 July 1907, affirmed by Queen Juliana in a royal decree of 23 April 1980.

==Description==
The blazon is as follows:

&quot;Azure, billetty Or a lion with a coronet Or armed and langued Gules holding in his dexter paw a sword Argent hilted Or and in the sinister paw seven arrows Argent pointed and bound together Or. (The seven arrows stand for the seven provinces of the Union of Utrecht.) The shield is crowned with the (Dutch) royal crown and supported by two lions Or armed and langued gules. They stand on a scroll Azure with the text (Or) &quot;Je Maintiendrai&quot; (, French for &quot;I shall maintain&quot;.)&quot;

The monarch places this coat of arms on a mantle &quot;gules&quot; lined with ermine. Above the mantle is a pavilion &quot;gules&quot; again topped with the royal crown.

In the royal decree, it is stated that male successors may replace the crown on the shield with a helm with the crest of Nassau.

==History and origin of the coat of arms==

This version of the coat of arms has been in use since 1907 but differs only slightly from the version that was adopted in 1815. From 1815 until 1907 all the lions wore the royal crown and the supporting lions were facing.

The royal arms were adopted by the first king of The Kingdom of the Netherlands, William I, when he became king after the Congress of Vienna in 1815. As king, he adopted a coat of arms that combined elements of his family&#x27;s (Orange-Nassau) coat of arms and that of the former Dutch Republic that existed from 1581 until 1795.

From his family arms he used the &quot;azure, billetty or&quot; with &quot;a lion rampant or&quot; of Nassau (blue shield, lion, billets). The &quot;Je Maintiendrai&quot; motto represents the Orange family since it came into the family with the princedom of Orange as &quot;Je Maintiendrai Châlons&quot;. These elements are also found in the arms of king William III, who was also king of England, Scotland &amp; Ireland (1689–1702). From the arms of the former States General of the Republic of the United Provinces he took the lion with a coronet, sword and arrows. The arrows symbolize the seven provinces that made up the Republic, the sword the determination to defend their liberty, and the coronet their sovereignty. William replaced the coronet with a royal crown. In 1907, Queen Wilhelmina returned to an open coronet.

===Counts of Nassau===
The arms of Nassau has existed since about 1250. There are two versions of the Nassau arms, representing the two main branches. This is a result of two brothers, count Walram II and count Otto I, agreeing to divide their father&#x27;s (Henry II) lands between them in 1255. The line of Walram added a crown to the lion in the Nassau arms to make it different from the lion used by the line of Otto.

The kings and queens of the Netherlands are descendants of count Otto. The Grand Dukes of Luxemburg are descendants of count Walram. They also still use &quot;Nassau&quot; in their arms. Both lines are now extinct in the male line.

The helm and crest that can be used in the royal arms by the male successors to the throne (and is in fact being used by some male members of the royal family) is:
&quot;On a (ceremonial) helmet, with bars and decoration Or and mantling Azure and Or, issuing from a coronet Or, a pair of wings joined Sable each with an arched bend Argent charged with three leaves of the lime-tree stems upward Vert&quot;.

This crest is used by the descendants of Otto and differs from the crest used by the descendants of Walram. But in the royal decree of 1815 the crest issuing from a crown on the Dutch royal arms was the one used by the Walram line. Why this was done is not sure. Maybe due to the &quot;mistake&quot; this crest was hardly used.

The crest of the Walram-line is:
Between two trunks Azure billetty Or a sitting lion Or.
The trunks are probably a misinterpretation of two cow horns, a crest that is frequently used in German heraldry.
On the Grand Coat of Arms of the Grand Duke of Luxemburg the lion is crowned, armed and langued Gules.

===The Princedom of Orange===
The motto has been used by every &quot;ruling&quot; member of the Nassau family, who was also the prince of Orange since it came into the family with the Princedom of Orange in 1530. Count Henry III of Nassau-Breda, who was living in the Low Countries, was married to Claudia Orange-Châlon. Her brother, Philibert of Châlon, was the last Prince of Orange from the House of Châlon. When he died in 1530, Henry&#x27;s and Claudia&#x27;s son René of Nassau-Breda inherited the Princedom on condition that he used the name and coat of arms of the Châlon family. History knows him therefore as René of Châlon. With this inheritance came the &quot;Je Maintiendrai Châlons&quot; motto into the Nassau family. René died in 1544 without leaving a child. His cousin William of Nassau-Dillenburg inherited all of René&#x27;s lands. William became William of Orange (in English better known under his nickname William the Silent) and the founder of the House of Orange-Nassau. William first changed the motto to &quot;Je Maintiendrai Nassau&quot;. Later he (or his sons) dropped the family name from the motto.

===The Dutch Republic===

The sword and arrows originated from the Habsburg rulers.

The lion, as representing the Burgundian Netherlands, first appears as a crest on the tomb of Philip the Handsome. Later Charles V added the sword. The arrows were used, on coins etc., since the early 16th century to represent the Seventeen Provinces in the low countries under control of Charles V. In 1578, during the Eighty Years&#x27; War, the States General ordered a new great seal representing the lion, the sword and the 17 arrows combined. Although only seven provinces remained free from Spain, this seal stayed in use until 1795.

After the completion of its forming in 1584 the Republic of the Seven United Provinces used as its arms: Or a crowned lion Gules armed and langued Azure, holding in his dexter paw a sword and in the sinister paw seven arrows tight together Azure. The colours of this version where derived from the most important of the seven provinces, the county of Holland (its arms are still in use since being adopted by the counts of Holland ).

After the colours where reversed and the arms became &quot;Gules a crowned lion Or armed and langued Azure holding in his dexter paw a sword Argent hilted Or and in the sinister paw seven arrows Argent pointed and tight together Or.&quot;

The arrows symbolize the seven provinces that made up the Republic, the sword the determination to defend their liberty, and the coronet their sovereignty.

===1795–1815 Revolution, Napoleonic years and Restoration===
In 1795, with French help, the last Stadholder William V was forced to flee and the Batavian Republic (1795–1806) was proclaimed. At first this had no influence on the use of the arms of the former Republic. Then in the following year the lion, that had served for approximately 280 years, was replaced by an allegoric image of a &quot;Dutch maiden of Freedom&quot;. In 1802 the Batavian Republic reverted to the Republican lion, although it does not carry seven arrows.

With the replacement of the Batavian Republic with the Kingdom of Holland (1806–1810), the lion of the States General was again adopted. Louis Napoleon Bonaparte (brother of the French Emperor Napoleon) used as King Louis I a coat of arms that quartered the Dutch lion with the French Imperial Eagle. After the emperor Napoleon abolished the Kingdom of Holland in 1810 the lion again had to leave the stage and the Imperial Eagle was the only image in use.

In 1813 the French were forced out of the Netherlands and the son of the last Stadholder, William VI/I, was proclaimed &#x27;Sovereign Prince&#x27; (1813–1815). To symbolize his new status he assumed a new coat of arms. In it the old lion with the sword and arrows made his second reappearance, now with a royal crown upon his head. Again it was placed in the prime locations of a quartered shield (I and IV quarters). In the II and III quarters were the arms of Châlon-Orange-Geneve. The arms of Nassau (Otto) were placed on an escutcheon in the center of the shield.

The final retirement of the Republican lion came in 1815 with the establishment of the &quot;United Kingdom of the Netherlands&quot;. Because this new kingdom comprised not only the lands of the former Dutch Republic but also of the former Austrian or Southern Netherlands, it was also not appropriate to continue the use of the old arms. First a combination with the arms of Brabant (Sable a Lion Or, now the coat of arms of Belgium) was considered. In the end the attributes, the sword, arrows and crown, were placed in the care of his older &quot;colleague&quot; from Nassau to symbolize the union between the (now Royal) House of Nassau and the Netherlands. As seen above, this is still the basis of the current coat of arms.

==Versions and variants==

===Government===

Various versions of the Dutch royal arms are used by Government, the Parliament and courts. Government and its agencies generally use a simplified version of the royal arms without the mantle, the pavilion and the topped royal crown. This simplified royal arms also feature on the cover of passports, embassies and consulates. The versions used by the legislature and its chambers show the royal arms with the royal crown and a buckled dark-blue strap that bears the name of the parliament or each chamber &quot;Staten-Generaal&quot; (States General), &quot;Eerste Kamer der Staten-Generaal&quot; (Senate), &quot;Tweede Kamer der Staten-Generaal&quot; (House of Representatives) in gold letters surrounding the shield.


===Royal family===
Members of the Dutch royal family receive their own personalised arms which are based on the royal arms. For more details see Wapen van Nassau, Tak van Otto (in Dutch).

<text>Canoe camping, also known as touring, tripping or expedition canoeing, is a combination of canoeing and camping. Canoe campers typically carry enough supplies with them to travel and camp for several days via a canoe.

== Description ==
A canoeist can transport significantly heavier and bulkier loads than a backpacker or even a kayaker can. portaging by foot is sometimes necessary to pass between water bodies or around hazardous obstacles such as rapids or waterfalls, but most of the time canoe campers travel on water. Because they usually don&#x27;t continuously carry their gear on their backs, canoe campers can bring more food and gear and undertake longer trips. This is especially the case with food which, unlike gear where the weight is essentially fixed regardless of the trip duration, increases in weight for each additional day of provision. On rivers, high water levels after storms can make river travel hazardous, while on lakes, winds and thunderstorms can produce strong winds which create large waves and headwinds which work against paddlers to slow the canoe. Trips may need to have extra days built into the schedule in case of weather delays.

Although some experienced canoeists feel comfortable paddling straight through large bodies of water, most typically stay within a few hundred meters of shore. Since a fully loaded touring canoe only draws about , it can approach a rocky shore as close as arm&#x27;s-length. This proximity (and a canoe&#x27;s inherent quietness) lets the canoeist observe aquatic and near-shore plants and wildlife from a perspective that walking on solid ground does not allow. Many people engage in fishing while canoe camping.

The versatility of canoe tripping allows canoeists to go places and see things that they otherwise could not.

Many canoeists use specialized canoe packs designed for both easy portaging and loading into canoes. Waterproof dry bags are frequently used to keep important items dry in case of inclement weather or capsizing.

== History ==
Native Americans of many different tribes who used canoes for transportation, needed to &quot;canoe camp&quot; regularly. Before the construction of modern means of transportation and transportation routes, the most effective way to travel through the vast expanses of northern wilderness was to navigate the countless small waterways by canoe. Their canoe was perfect for this purpose, as it was relatively easy to carry, fast, able to traverse a wide variety of different water ways (small streams to huge lakes), and able to carry large loads.

It was for all these reasons that the early French explorers of North America, such as Louis Jolliet, quickly adopted the use of the Native American canoe. With them came Jesuit missionaries, coureurs des bois, and voyageurs. Once trading posts were established in the interior, the canoe continued to be the primary transportation method, supplying such posts with regular canoe brigades. In northern Quebec, this practice continued until the middle of the 20th century.

As the &quot;wilderness&quot; of the Americas was tamed by the construction of the railroad and later roads, the canoe as a means of primary transportation lost its practicality. It turned into a recreational sport, a way for Americans and others to experience the pre-European America, and have a glimpse of a formerly never-ending wilderness. While recreational canoe camping has been enjoyed since the late 19th century by sporting and boating enthusiasts, it was not until later in the 20th century that, with the advent of camping consumer goods, it gained mass appeal.

=== Notable proponents and expeditions ===
An early proponent and popularizer of canoe camping was George W. Sears, a sportswriter for Forest and Stream magazine in the 1880s, whose book &quot;Woodcraft&quot; (1884), told the story of his 1883, journey through the central Adirondacks in a , solo canoe named the &quot;Sairy Gamp&quot;. He was 64 years old and in frail health at the time.
John MacGregor during the 1860s built and sailed and paddled his &quot;Rob Roy&quot; canoes through Europe, and the Middle East documenting these in a series of books including;; (1886) A Thousand Miles in the Rob Roy Canoe; (1867) The Voyage Alone In The Yawl &#x27;Rob Roy&#x27;; (1867) The Rob Roy on the Baltic; and (1869) The Rob Roy on the Jordan, Nile, Red sea. Inspired by MacGregor, and using a version of his &quot;Rob Roy&quot; canoe Robert Louis Stevenson undertook, in 1876, a canoe journey through the waterways of France and Belgium and wrote this up in his An Inland Voyage.

Also in 1883, American Canoe Association Secretary Charles Neide and retired sea captain &quot;Barnacle&quot; Kendall paddled and sailed over in a sailing canoe from Lake George, New York to Pensacola, Florida.

The adventure memoir &quot;Canoeing with the Cree&quot; relates Eric Sevareid&#x27;s youthful journey with a companion from Minnesota to Hudson Bay in 1930.

In Canada, Bill Mason, who was an author, artist, filmmaker, and environmentalist, published several books and produced a number of films in the 1970s that greatly advanced the popularity of canoe camping.

Calvin Rutstrum was a wilderness canoeist and author, whom Bill Mason said &quot;totally influenced me&quot; and &quot;he became my hero&quot;.

Like Mason and Sevareid, a number of modern-day canoeists have retraced the historic routes of the fur-traders and voyageurs and published books about their experiences. Noteworthy examples from Canada include &quot;Coke Stop in Emo: Adventures of a Long-Distance Paddler&quot; by Alec Ross, &quot;Canoeing a Continent: On the Trail of Alexander MacKenzie&quot; by Max Finkelstein and &quot;Where Rivers Run&quot; by Joanie and Gary McGuffin.

Sigurd Olson, conservationist and north woods writer, traveled and camped by canoe extensively. These included long trips as he wrote about in his book &quot;The Lonely Land&quot; and well as frequent shorter trips covered in many of his books.

Eric W. Morse, author, historian and notable wilderness canoe tripper traveled with Sigurd Olson. He authored books on their wilderness trips and on historical fur trade canoe routes in Canada.

In the &quot;Source to Sea expedition&quot; of 2005, two students from North Carolina State University paddled down the Mississippi and Atchafalaya Rivers to support the Audubon Society&#x27;s Upper Mississippi River Campaign.

The book &quot;New York to Nome&quot; by Rick Steber details the story of Sheldon Taylor and Geoffrey Pope who paddled from New York City April 25, 1936, to Nome, Alaska, August 11, 1937. And from January 10, 1975 until November 12, 1977, Jerry Robert Pushcar canoed and portaged solo a distance of from New Orleans, Louisiana, to Nome, Alaska, via the Mississippi, Prescott, Minnesota, Grand Portage, Lake Superior, and Canada. This was the longest recorded canoe trip in history until 1980. The record was broken by Don Starkell and his sons Dana and Jeff, who paddled in an open canoe from Winnipeg in central Canada to Belém at the mouth of the Amazon River from June 1, 1980 to May 1, 1982, covering a distance of .

Henry David Thoreau, an American author and advocate of environmental conservation, provided a written account of a long distance canoeing expedition in his book &quot;The Maine Woods&quot;. Thoreau&#x27;s canoeing expedition in Maine covered remote areas that can still be experienced in Maine&#x27;s Hundred Mile Wilderness.

<text>Simon James Dawson (June 13, 1818 – October 30, 1902) was a Canadian civil engineer and politician.

== Career ==
Born in Redhaven, Banffshire, Scotland, Dawson emigrated to Canada as a young man and began his career as an engineer. In 1857, as a member of a Canadian government expedition, he surveyed a line of road from Prince Arthur’s Landing (later Port Arthur, now part of Thunder Bay, Ontario) to Fort Garry and further explored that area in 1858 and 1859. His report greatly stimulated Canadian interest in the West. In 1868, he was placed in charge of construction of a wagon and water route following his earlier survey by the newly formed federal Department of Public Works. The Dawson road was traversed in 1870 by the Wolseley Expedition under the command of Colonel Garnet Wolseley sent to preserve order during the first Riel uprising, the Red River Rebellion.

Dawson represented Algoma in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1875 to 1878 and Algoma in the House of Commons of Canada from 1878 to 1891. As a politician, he was a consistent advocate for native rights. In 1875, he proposed that the riding of Algoma, then the only riding in the region of northern Ontario, become a separate territory, until it had enough population for provincial status. As a Scottish Roman Catholic, he was an anomaly in Protestant Ontario where most Scots were Presbyterian.

His brother William McDonell Dawson served as Crown Lands agent at Ottawa and was superintendent of the woods and forests branch in the Crown Lands department from 1852 to 1857. In 1858, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada for Trois-Rivières; he was defeated there but elected for the County of Ottawa in the 1861 general election. Another brother was the Roman Catholic priest Aeneas McDonell Dawson.

He died in Ottawa in 1902, virtually forgotten.

==Early life and education==
Garza was born in Brownsville, Texas, the son of a gasoline station owner and the grandson of Mexican immigrants to the United States. Garza received his Bachelor of Business Administration from the University of Texas at Austin in 1980 and received his J.D. in 1983 from Southern Methodist University School of Law.

==Career==
After practicing as an attorney, Garza became a judge in Cameron County in 1988. He served as the Texas Secretary of State from January 1995 to November 1997 before later being elected as one of the three member board of the Texas Railroad Commission, where he served as chairman.

In 2002, he was appointed U.S. Ambassador to Mexico, a position he held until 2009. In 2009, the year he retired from the office, Garza received the Águila Azteca from Mexico in recognition of his work to strengthen the bonds between Mexico and the United States. This is the highest award that Mexico bestows on foreigners. Thereafter, he took a position as counsel with White &amp; Case LLP and also as chairman of management consultancy firm Vianovo Ventures.

==Personal life==
Garza married María Asunción Aramburuzabala, the president of Tresalia Capital who had a personal fortune valued at $1.8 billion, according to one source. The couple divorced in May 2010. He subsequently married Dr Liz Beightler.

<text>Rovsing&#x27;s sign, named after the Danish surgeon Niels Thorkild Rovsing (1862–1927), is a sign of appendicitis. If palpation of the left lower quadrant of a person&#x27;s abdomen increases the pain felt in the right lower quadrant, the patient is said to have a positive Rovsing&#x27;s sign and may have appendicitis. The phenomenon was first described by Swedish surgeon Emil Samuel Perman (1856–1945) writing in the journal &quot;Hygiea&quot; in 1904.

In acute appendicitis, palpation in the left iliac fossa may produce pain in the right iliac fossa.

== Referral of pain ==

This anomaly occurs because the pain nerves deep in the intestines do not localize well to an exact spot on the abdominal wall, unlike pain nerves in muscles. Pain from a stomach ulcer or gallstone can be interpreted by the brain as pain from the stomach, liver, gall bladder, duodenum, or first part of the small intestine. It will &quot;refer&quot; pain often to the mid upper abdomen, the epigastrum.

Because the appendix is a piece of intestine, it follows a similar referral pattern. An appendix with some early inflammation may give a non-specific irritation somewhere near the umbilicus (belly button). Should the inflammation become severe, it may actually irritate the inner lining of the abdominal cavity called the peritoneum. This thin layer of tissue lies deep to the abdominal wall muscles. Now the pain has become &quot;localized&quot;. If pressure is applied to the muscles of the right lower abdomen (or iliac fossa) near a very irritated appendix, then the muscle fibers in that area will be stretched and will hurt.

==Process==
Pathologic explanation: This maneuver elicits tenderness in the right lower abdomen, because contents of the left lower abdomen are shifted upon application of pressure, further irritating the inflamed peritoneum.

A Rovsing&#x27;s sign is elicited by pushing on the abdomen far away from the appendix in the left lower quadrant. The appendix, in a large majority of people, is located in the right lower quadrant. While this maneuver stretches the entire peritoneal lining, it only causes pain in any location where the peritoneum is irritating the muscle. In the case of appendicitis, the pain is felt in the right lower quadrant despite pressure being placed elsewhere.

Most practitioners push on the left lower quadrant to see where the patient complains of pain. If pain is felt in the right lower quadrant, then there may be an inflamed organ or piece of tissue in the right lower quadrant. The appendix is generally the prime suspect, although other pathology can also give a &quot;positive&quot; Rovsing&#x27;s sign. If left lower quadrant pressure by the examiner leads only to left-sided pain or pain on both the left and right sides, then there may be some other pathologic etiology. This may include causes relating to the bladder, uterus, ascending (right) colon, fallopian tubes, ovaries, or other structures.

The eponym Rovsing sign is also used in patients with horseshoe kidney, consisting of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting with hyperextension of the spine.

While Rovsing&#x27;s test is frequently performed in suspicion of appendicitis, its sensitivity and specificity have not been adequately evaluated, and is considered by some to be an antiquated examination test.

<doc id="1172619" wikidata="Q14980" url="?curid=1172619" title="Dmitry of Uglich">
<text>Dmitry Ivanovich (; – 15 May 1591) was the youngest son of Russian tsar Ivan the Terrible. He was the tsarevich (heir apparent) for close to seven years of his half-brother Feodor I&#x27;s reign (though his legitimacy as an heir could have been contested by the Russian Orthodox Church). After his death, he was impersonated by a number of imposters to the throne, during the Time of Troubles.

==Life==
Dmitry was the youngest son of Ivan the Terrible by his last wife Maria Nagaya, and their only child together. Ivan died in 1584, and was succeeded by Dmitry&#x27;s older brother, Feodor I. Feodor was sickly and weak, and the country was governed by a regency council. This was headed from 1586 by Boris Godunov, Feodor&#x27;s brother-in-law and Malyuta Skuratov&#x27;s son-in-law.

In 1584, Godunov sent Dmitry, and his mother and her brothers, into internal exile in the tsarevich&#x27;s appanage of Uglich. On 15 May 1591, Dmitry died there under mysterious circumstances.

As a result, when Feodor I died childless in 1598, Dmitry, the only other possible Rurikid heir, was also dead, and Godunov claimed the throne.

It was widely believed at the time that Godunov got rid of Dmitry to clear the way for his own eventual succession.

==Death theories==

Russian chroniclers and later historians offered two possible scenarios of what could have happened to Dmitry. The first theory is that Dmitry was killed by order of Boris Godunov, the assassins making it look like an accident (this version was supported by the prominent 19th-century historians Nikolai Karamzin, Sergei Soloviev, Vasily Klyuchevsky and others). Critics of this version point out that Dmitry was Ivan&#x27;s son from his last marriage, and thus illegitimate by Russian Orthodox canon law, which allows a maximum of three marriages. This would make any claim of Dmitry&#x27;s for the throne dubious at best. Modern scholarship tends to exonerate Boris of any role in the prince&#x27;s death.

The second theory is that Dmitry stabbed himself in the throat during an epileptic seizure, while playing with a knife (this version was supported by historians Mikhail Pogodin, Sergei Platonov, V. K. Klein, Ruslan Skrynnikov and others). The detractors of this scenario assert that, since during an epileptic seizure the palms are wide open, the self-infliction of a fatal wound becomes highly unlikely. However, the official investigation, done at that time, asserted that the tsarevich&#x27;s seizure came while he was playing a svaika game or with a knife (&quot;v tychku&quot;) and thus holding the knife by the blade, turned toward himself. With the knife in that position, the version of self-inflicted wound on the neck while falling forward during seizure appears more likely.

There is also a third version of Dmitry&#x27;s fate, which found support with some earlier historians, such as Konstantin Bestuzhev-Ryumin, Ivan Belyaev, and others. They considered it possible that Godunov&#x27;s people had tried to assassinate Dmitry, but killed somebody else instead and he managed to escape. This scenario explains the appearance of impostors, sponsored by the Polish nobility (see False Dmitry). However, most modern Russian historians consider the version of Dmitry&#x27;s survival improbable, since it is hardly possible that the boy&#x27;s appearance was unknown to his assassins. Also, it is well known that many Polish nobles who supported False Dmitry I did not believe his story themselves.

==Aftermath==
The death of the tsarevich roused a violent riot in Uglich, instigated by the loud claims of Dmitry&#x27;s mother Maria Nagaya and her brother Mikhail that Dmitry was murdered. Hearing this, enraged citizens lynched 15 of Dmitry&#x27;s supposed &quot;assassins&quot;, including the local representative of the Moscow government (&quot;dyak&quot;) and one of Dmitry&#x27;s playmates. The subsequent official investigation, led by Vasily Shuisky, after a thorough examination of witnesses, concluded that the tsarevich had died from a self-inflicted stab wound to the throat. Following the official investigation, Maria Nagaya was forcibly tonsured as a nun and exiled to a remote convent.

However, when the political circumstances changed, Shuisky retracted his earlier claim of accidental death and asserted that Dmitry was murdered on Boris Godunov&#x27;s orders. On 3 June 1606, Dmitry&#x27;s remains were transferred from Uglich to Moscow and his cult soon developed. In the calendar of the Russian Orthodox Church, he is venerated as a &quot;Saint Pious Tsarevitch&quot;, with feast days of 19 October, 15 May and 3 June. In the 20th century, some Russian and Soviet historians have given more credit to the conclusions of the first official investigation report under Shuisky, which ruled Dmitry&#x27;s death to be an accident.

==Cultural references==
The story of murder is presumed in Aleksandr Pushkin&#x27;s play &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;, made into an opera by Modest Mussorgsky.

<text>The Skylon Tower, in Niagara Falls, Ontario, is an observation tower that overlooks both the American Falls, New York, and the larger Horseshoe Falls, Ontario, from the Canadian side of the Niagara River.

==History==
Construction of the Skylon began in May 1964. The tower was opened on October 6, 1965, by New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller and Ontario Premier John Robarts. Costing $7 million at the time of its construction, the Skylon Tower was owned by a private partnership called Niagara International Centre, which was financed by Hershey Foods shareholdings of Charles Richard Reese, former co-owner of the H. B. Reese Candy Company of Hershey, Pennsylvania. Canadian Pacific Hotels (CPH) was hired to operate the tower restaurants and lounges.

On October 1, 1975, CPH purchased the tower from Mr. Reese and his partners for $11 million. The tower&#x27;s summit features a verdigris-green copper roof similar to CPH&#x27;s other properties, including the Château Frontenac in Quebec City and the Banff Springs Hotel in Banff, Alberta. CPH owned and operated the tower until 1986, when it was sold for $18 million to two local Niagara hotel owners, John Gruyich of Michael&#x27;s Inn and George Yerich of the Holiday Inn By The Falls Motel. In 1988, George Yerich bought out John Gruyich&#x27;s ownership share of the Skylon for $13 million, however Milicent Gruyich continues to own the land the tower is built on. Mr. Yerich&#x27;s Skylon land lease will expire in 2060, at which time the Skylon Tower will revert to total ownership by the heirs of Milicent Gruyich.
While much redevelopment has taken place in the surrounding city, the Skylon Tower complex still retains much of its look and feel from the 1970s and 1980s. However the property has recently been expanded to include a 3D/4D Theatre, a Starbucks franchise, other quick-service franchises and a bridge connecting the complex with the newly completed Fallsview Casino. In August and September 2008 the roof of Skylon was restored to its original bright copper colour.

In recent years, the lights that shine up the tower at night have gone from being the typical white lights to a selection of colours that interchange. This is done in a similar fashion to the lights that shine on the falls themselves.

==Features==

Standing at 160 metres (520 ft) from street level and 236 metres (775 ft) from the bottom of the falls, the tower required approval from both Canadian and United States air transport authorities, due to its proximity to the international boundary. It was the second tower to be built using the slipform method, in which concrete is continuously poured into a form moving slowly up the tower. It was built by Pigott Construction of Hamilton, Ontario. The same methods were also used to build the Inco Superstack in Sudbury, and the CN Tower in Toronto.

The tower features three outside-mounted &quot;Yellow Bug&quot; elevators. At the time of their construction, they were the first such elevators in Canada. They were designed, engineered and maintained by a division of the Otis Elevator Company from Hamilton, Ontario and can carry passengers to the top of the tower in 52 seconds. Unlike conventional elevators that are guided by side rails, the Skylon elevators operate with a guide rail on the backside only. Special equipment is employed to prevent the cables from becoming tangled in the wind or impeded by snow and ice in the winter. A curtain wall on the outside of the tower behind each elevator protects the counterweight and travelling cables from the elements.

The tower has two restaurants at its top, the Revolving Dining Room and the upper Summit Suite Buffet. The Revolving Dining Room seats 276 people and revolves once every hour by resting on a circular rail that is propelled by a motor. An observation deck sits at the tower&#x27;s summit. The base of the tower features a number of gift shops, fast food restaurants and a large amusement arcade. A floor for conventions is also available, but is seldom utilized.

<doc id="1172624" wikidata="Q1063425" url="?curid=1172624" title="Porcelain Tower of Nanjing">
<text>The Porcelain Tower of Nanjing, part of the former Great Bao&#x27;en Temple, is a historical site located on the south bank of external Qinhuai River in Nanjing, China. It was a pagoda constructed in the 15th century during the Ming dynasty, but was mostly destroyed in the 19th century during the course of the Taiping Rebellion. A modern, full-size replica of it now exists in Nanjing.

In 2010, Wang Jianlin, a Chinese businessman donated a billion yuan (US$156 million) to the city of Nanjing for its reconstruction. This is reported to be the largest single personal donation ever made in China. In December 2015, the modern replica and surrounding park were opened to the public.

== History ==
The Porcelain Tower of Nanjing, originally called the Great Bao&#x27;en Temple, was designed during the reign of the Yongle Emperor (r. 1402–1424); its construction began in the early 15th century. On 25 March 1428, the Xuande Emperor ordered Zheng He and others to supervise the rebuilding and repair of the temple. The construction of the temple was completed in 1431.

It was first discovered by the Western world when European travelers like Johan Nieuhof visited it, sometimes listing it as one of the Seven Wonders of the World. After this exposure to the outside world, the tower was seen as a national treasure by both locals and other cultures around the world.
In 1801, the tower was struck by lightning and the top four stories were knocked off, but it was soon restored. The 1843 book, &quot;The Closing Events of the Campaign in China&quot; by Granville Gower Loch, contains a detailed description of the tower as it existed in the early 1840s. In the 1850s, the area surrounding the tower erupted in civil war as the Taiping Rebellion reached Nanjing and the rebels took over the city. They smashed the Buddhist images and destroyed the inner staircase to deny the Qing enemy an observation platform. American sailors reached the city in May 1854 and visited the hollowed tower. In 1856, the Taiping razed the tower to the ground either in order to prevent a hostile faction from using it to observe and shell the city or from superstitious fear of its geomantic properties. After this, the tower&#x27;s remnants were salvaged for use in other buildings, while the site lay dormant until later rebuilding.

== Description ==
The tower was octagonal, with a base of about in diameter. When it was built, the tower was one of the largest buildings in China, rising up to a height of with nine stories and a staircase in the middle of the pagoda, which spiraled upwards for 184 steps. The top of the roof was marked by a golden pineapple. There were original plans to add more stories, according to an American missionary who in 1852 visited Nanjing. There are only a few Chinese pagodas that surpass its height, such as the still-existent , eleventh-century Liaodi Pagoda in Hebei or the no-longer-existent , seventh-century wooden pagoda of Chang&#x27;an.

The tower was built with white porcelain bricks that were said to reflect the sun&#x27;s rays during the day, and at night as many as 140 lamps were hung from the building to illuminate the tower. Glazes and stoneware were worked into the porcelain and created a mixture of green, yellow, brown and white designs on the sides of the tower, including animals, flowers and landscapes. The tower was also decorated with numerous Buddhist images.

Fragments of the original tower may exist in the Calcutta Museum, presented by the Geological Survey of India, 7 August 1877. A small fragment belongs to the Georgia Historical Society in Savannah, Georgia.

<doc id="1172629" wikidata="Q1790886" url="?curid=1172629" title="Cuban Americans">
<text>Cuban Americans ( or ) are Americans who immigrated from or are descended from immigrants from Cuba. As of 2023, Cuban Americans were the fourth largest Hispanic and Latino American group in the United States after Mexican Americans, Stateside Puerto Ricans and Salvadoran Americans.

Many metropolitan areas throughout the United States have significant Cuban American populations. Florida (2,000,000 in 2023) has the highest concentration of Cuban Americans in the United States. Over 1,200,000 Cuban-Americans reside in Miami-Dade County, where they are the largest single ethnic group and constitute a majority of the population in many municipalities.

Greater Miami has by far the highest concentration of Cuban Americans of any metropolitan area, with an estimate of 2,000,000 individuals identifying as such. Along with Greater Miami and its surroundings, Tampa (200,621) and Jacksonville (up to 7,000) compose another portion of the Cuban American population in the state of Florida.

As per 2024, the second state with the highest Cuban American population is Texas, counting a number up to 140,000 individuals identifying as such.

About 60,000 and more reside in the Greater Houston area, whereas some other 20,000 individuals can be found in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, San Antonio and Austin areas altogether.

A thousand Cuban Americans also happen to be spread out across West Texas.

California takes place as the third state with the highest Cuban American population in the country, home to more than 100,000 people, of whom 80,000 of these are in the Greater Los Angeles area; another 23,000 and more individuals are spread out over the Inland Empire region and its neighboring counties, going all the way down to San Diego and its surrounding areas.

Another 20,000 and more Cuban Americans are present in Northern California, mainly all over the San Francisco Bay Area. Some other thousands therefore are also spread out across Central Valley, California.

Following significant long standing numbers of Cuban Americans can be found in the Eastern United States, primarily in New Jersey and New York.

The states of Georgia, Kentucky, Illinois and Nevada also host following fastly growing amounts of Cuban Americans.

As of today, the three states with most Cuban Americans are Florida, Texas and California.

==Immigration==
===Early migrations===
Before the Louisiana Purchase and the Adams–Onís Treaty of 1819, Spanish Florida and other possessions of Spain on the Gulf Coast west of the Mississippi River were provinces of the Captaincy General of Cuba. Consequently, Cuban immigration to regions that would eventually form the United States have a long history, beginning in the Spanish colonial period in 1565 when the settlement of St. Augustine was established by Pedro Menéndez de Avilés and hundreds of Spanish soldiers and their families moved from Cuba to St. Augustine to establish new lives.

Thousands of Cuban settlers also immigrated to Louisiana between 1778 and 1802 and Texas during the period of Spanish rule. Since 1820, the Cuban presence was more than 1,000 people. In 1870 the number of Cuban immigrants increased to almost 12,000, of which about 4,500 resided in New York City, about 3,000 in New Orleans and 2,000 in Key West. The causes of these movements were both economic and political, which intensified after 1860, when political factors played the predominant role in emigration, as a result of deteriorating relations with the Spanish metropolis.

1869 marked the beginning of one of the most significant periods of emigration from Cuba to the United States, again centered on Key West. The exodus of hundreds of workers and businessmen was linked to the manufacture of tobacco. The reasons are many: the introduction of more modern techniques of elaboration of snuff, the most direct access to its main market, the United States, the uncertainty about the future of the island, which had suffered years of economic, political and social unrest during the beginning of the Ten Years&#x27; War against Spanish rule. It was an exodus of skilled workers, precisely the class in the island that had succeeded in establishing a free labor sector amid a slave economy.

Tampa was added to such efforts, with a strong migration of Cubans, which went from 720 inhabitants in 1880 to 5,532 in 1890. However, the second half of the 1890s marked the decline of the Cuban immigrant population, as an important part of it returned to the island to fight for independence. The War accentuated Cuban immigrant integration into American society, whose numbers were significant: more than 12,000 people.

The population of Cuban Americans has experienced a surge in growth once again with the arrival of the 2021–23 Cuban migration wave to the United States, where Cubans were intercepted at the Southern border over 300,000 times.

=== Key West and Tampa, Florida ===
In the mid- to late 19th century, several cigar manufacturers moved their operations to Key West to get away from growing laboral and political problems. Many Cuban cigar workers followed. The Cuban government had even established a grammar school in Key West to help preserve Cuban culture. There, children learned folk songs and patriotic hymns such as &quot;La Bayamesa&quot;, the Cuban national anthem.

In 1885, Vicente Martinez Ybor moved his cigar operations from Key West to the town of Tampa, Florida to escape labor strife. Ybor City was designed as a modified company town, and it quickly attracted thousands of Cuban workers from Key West and Cuba with Spanish and Italian immigrant workers. West Tampa, another new cigar manufacturing community, was founded nearby in 1892 and also grew quickly. Between these communities, the Tampa Bay area&#x27;s Cuban population grew from almost nothing to the largest in Florida in just over a decade, and the city as a whole grew from a village of approximately 1000 residents in 1885 to over 16,000 by 1900.

Both Ybor City and West Tampa were instrumental in Cuba&#x27;s eventual independence. Inspired by revolutionaries such as Jose Martí, who visited Florida several times, Tampa-area Cubans and their sympathetic neighbors donated money, equipment, and sometimes their lives to the cause of &quot;Cuba Libre&quot;. After the Spanish–American War, some Cubans returned to their native land, but many chose to stay in the U.S. due to the physical and economic devastation caused by years of fighting on the island.

=== Other early waves (1900–1959) ===
Several other small waves of Cuban emigration to the U.S. occurred in the early 20th century (1900–1959). Most settled in Florida and the northeast U.S. The majority of an estimated 100,000 Cubans arriving in that time period usually came for economic reasons (the Great Depression of 1929, volatile sugar prices and migrant farm labor contracts), but included anti-Batista refugees fleeing the military dictatorship, which had pro-U.S. diplomatic ties. During the &#x27;20s and &#x27;30s, emigration from Cuba to U.S. territory, basically comprised workers looking for jobs, mainly in New York and New Jersey. They were classified as labor migrants and workers, much like other immigrants in the area at that time. Thus migrated more than 40,149 in the first decade, encouraged by U.S. immigration facilities at the time and more than 43,400 by the end of the 30s.

The Cuban population officially registered in the United States for 1958 was around 125,000 people including descendants. Of these, more than 50,000 remained in the United States after the revolution of 1959.

=== Post-1959 revolution (since 1959) ===
After the Cuban revolution led by Fidel Castro in 1959, a Cuban exodus began as the new government allied itself with the Soviet Union and began to introduce communism. The first Cubans to come to America after the revolution were those affiliated with former dictator Fulgencio Batista, next were Cuba&#x27;s professionals. Most Cuban Americans that arrived in the United States initially came from Cuba&#x27;s educated upper and middle classes centered in Cuba&#x27;s capital Havana. This middle class arose in the period after the Platt Amendment when Cuba became one of the most successful countries in Latin America. Between December 1960 and October 1962 more than 14,000 Cuban children arrived alone in the U.S. Their parents were afraid that their children were going to be sent to some Soviet bloc countries to be educated and they decided to send them to the States as soon as possible.

This program was called Operation Peter Pan (Operacion Pedro Pan). When the children arrived in Miami they were met by representatives of Catholic Charities and they were sent to live with relatives if they had any or were sent to foster homes, orphanages or boarding schools until their parents could leave Cuba. From 1965 to 1973, there was another wave of immigration known as the Freedom Flights. In order to provide aid to recently arrived Cuban immigrants, the United States Congress passed the Cuban Adjustment Act in 1966. The Cuban Refugee Program provided more than $1.3 billion of direct financial assistance. They also were eligible for public assistance, Medicare, free English courses, scholarships and low-interest college loans.

Some banks pioneered loans for exiles who did not have collateral or credit but received help in getting a business loan. These loans enabled many Cuban Americans to secure funds and start up their own businesses. With their Cuban-owned businesses and low cost of living, Miami, Florida and Union City, New Jersey (dubbed &quot;Havana on the Hudson)&quot; were the preferred destinations for many immigrants and soon became the main centers for Cuban-American culture. According to author Lisandro Perez, Miami was not particularly attractive to Cubans prior to the 1960s.

It was not until the exodus of the Cuban exiles in 1959 that Miami started to become a preferred destination. Westchester within Miami-Dade County, was the area most densely populated by Cubans and Cuban Americans in the United States, followed by Hialeah in second.

Communities like Miami, Tampa and Union City, which Cuban Americans have made their home, have experienced a profound cultural impact as a result, as seen in such aspects of their local culture as cuisine, fashion, music, entertainment and cigar-making.

====1980s====

Another large wave (an estimated 125,000 people) of Cuban immigration occurred in the early 1980s with the Mariel boatlifts. Most of the &quot;Marielitos&quot; were people wanting to escape from economic stagnation.

Fidel Castro sent some 20,000 criminals directly from Cuban prisons, as well as mentally ill persons from Cuban mental institutions, with the alleged double purpose of cleaning up Cuban society and poisoning the USA. Those people were labeled &quot;inadmissible&quot; by the US government, and with time, through many negotiations, have been returned to Cuba.

====Mid-1990s to 2000s====

Since the mid-1990s, after the implementation of the &quot;Wet feet, dry feet&quot; policy immigration patterns changed. Many Cuban immigrants departed from the southern and western coasts of Cuba and arrived at the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico; many landed on Isla Mujeres. From there Cuban immigrants traveled to the Texas-Mexico border and found asylum. Many of the Cubans who did not have family in Miami settled in Houston; this has caused Houston&#x27;s Cuban-American community to increase in size. The term &quot;dusty foot&quot; refers to Cubans emigrating to the U.S. through Mexico. In 2005 the Department of Homeland Security had abandoned the approach of detaining every dry foot Cuban who crosses through Texas and began a policy allowing most Cubans to obtain immediate parole.

Jorge Ferragut, a Cuban immigrant who founded Casa Cuba, an agency that assists Cuban immigrants arriving in Texas, said in a 2008 article that many Cuban immigrants of the first decade of the 21st century left due to economic instead of political issues. By October 2008 Mexico and Cuba created an agreement to prevent immigration of Cubans through Mexico.

In recent years, Puerto Rico has become a major drop-off point for Cubans trying to reach the United States illegally. As a U.S. Commonwealth, Puerto Rico is seen as a stepping stone for Cubans trying to get to the continental U.S., though Puerto Rico itself is home to a number of Cubans.

==Immigration policy==
Before the 1980s, all refugees from Cuba were welcomed into the United States as political refugees. This changed in the 1990s so that only Cubans who reach U.S. soil are granted refuge under the &quot;wet foot, dry foot policy&quot;. While representing a tightening of U.S. immigration policy, the wet foot, dry foot policy still afforded Cubans a privileged position relative to other immigrants to the U.S. untill was removed by Democrat President Barack Obama during his second term. This privileged position is the source of a certain friction between Cuban Americans and other Latino citizens and residents in the United States, adding to the tension caused by the divergent foreign policy interests pursued by conservative Cuban Americans. Cuban immigration also continues with an allotted number of Cubans (20,000 per year) provided legal U.S. visas.

According to a U.S. Census 1970 report, Cuban Americans were present in all fifty states. But as later Census reports demonstrated, the majority of Cuban immigrants settled in Miami-Dade County. Emigration from Cuba began to slow down in the late 1990s. Meanwhile, second-generation Cuban Americans increasingly moved out of urban enclaves like Little Havana and settled in suburban areas like Westchester, while those urban areas came to be inhabited by immigrants from other Latin American nations.

In late 1999, U.S. news media focused on the case of Elián González, the six-year-old Cuban boy caught in a custody battle between his relatives in Miami and his father in Cuba. The boy&#x27;s mother died trying to bring him to the United States. On April 22, 2000, immigration enforcement agents took Elián González into custody. González was returned to Cuba to live with his father.

On January 12, 2017, President Barack Obama announced the immediate cessation of the wet feet, dry feet policy. The Cuban government agreed to accept the return of Cuban nationals. Beginning with the United States–Cuban Thaw in 2014, anticipation of the end of the policy had led to increased numbers of Cuban immigrants.

==Demographics==
In the census in 2022 there were 2,435,573 Cuban Americans, and in the 2010 census there were 1,785,547 (both native and foreign born), and represented 3.5% of all Latinos, and 0.58% of the US population. Of the 1,241,685 Cuban Americans, 983,147 were born abroad in Cuba and 628,331 were U.S. born. Of the 1.6 million, 415,212 were not U.S. citizens. In the 2013 ACS, there were 2,013,155 Cuban Americans. The 2010 US Census shows that 85% of Cuban Americans self-identified as being white. The most recent 2012 Cuban census has the island population at 64.12% white, 26.62% mulatto, 9.26% black, and 0.1% Asian.

===Ancestry===

The ancestry of Cuban Americans includes Spanish and African peoples, as well as the indigenous peoples of the Caribbean and those of Florida. During the 18th, 19th and early part of the 20th century, there were waves of Spanish immigration to Cuba (Castilians, Basques, Canarians, Catalans, Andalusians, Asturians and Galicians). Canarians immigrated to many countries along the Caribbean from Louisiana to Venezuela. But Cuba was the Latin American culture most influenced by the emigration of Canary Islanders (they developed the production of sugar in Cuba), and Cuban Spanish is closest to that of the Canary Islands. Canary Islanders were viewed by other Spanish-Cubans as superstitious but also hard-working. Some of Haiti&#x27;s white population (French) migrated to Cuba after the Haitian War of Independence in the early 19th century. Also, minor but significant ethnic influx is derived from diverse peoples from Middle East places such as Lebanon and Palestine.

There was also a significant influx of Jews, especially between the World Wars, from many countries, including Sephardi Jews from Turkey and Ashkenazi Jews from Poland, Germany and Russia. Other Europeans that have contributed include Britons, Italians, Germans, Swedes and Hungarians. Many Chinese also arrived in Cuba as indentured laborers and they formerly boasted the largest Chinatown in Western Hemisphere as most Chinese Cubans left for Florida.

==Culture==

=== Assimilation ===

Many Cuban Americans have assimilated themselves into the American culture, which includes Cuban influences.

More recently, there has been substantial growth of new Cuban American communities in places like Louisville, Kentucky, the Research Triangle area of North Carolina, Katy, Texas, and Downey, California; the latter city now has the second-highest percentage of Cubans and Cuban Americans in the Western United States at 1.96% of the population.

Cuban Americans have been very successful in establishing businesses and developing political clout in Miami. Cuban Americans have also contributed to and participated in many areas of American life including academia, business, acting, politics, and literature.
In the last 15 years, due to the growth of interest around the world for genealogy, Cuban genealogy has become a major interest for Cuban Americans and a growing segment in the family research industry. This has complemented assimilation by preserving Cuban and colonial roots, while also adopting American culture and values.

=== Religion ===
Cuban Americans are mostly Roman Catholic, but some Cubans practice syncretic religions (such as Santería or Ifá), which evolved from mixing the Catholic religion with the traditional African religion. There are also many Protestant (primarily Pentecostal) Cubans, with small numbers of syncretist, nonreligious or tiny communities of Jewish and Muslim Cuban Americans. The Protestant movement in Cuba started after the Spanish–American War when many Americans came to Cuba.

=== Language ===

Similar to the 67% of other Latinos, 69% of Cubans under 18 speak a language other than English at home. For Cubans over the age of 18, the percent speaking a language other than English at home climbs to 89%, which is higher than the 80% among other Latino groups.

Only 12% of Cubans under the age of 18 speak English less than very well, which is much lower than the 20% among other Latino groups. While roughly half of all Cuban-Americans indicate that they feel more proficient in Spanish, around 60% of all Cuban-Americans do speak English proficiently. 36% of all Cuban-Americans consider themselves bilingual. The choice of many Cuban-Americans to utilize Spanish in the home connects to the desire of Cuban-Americans to retain their ethnic heritage. While many Cuban-Americans are open to some assimilation into American culture, ultimately they still consider themselves a unique group of people who bear their own traditions and perspectives.

=== Food and drink ===
Cuban food is varied, though rice is a staple and commonly served at lunch and dinner. Other common dishes are &quot;arroz con pollo&quot; (chicken and rice), &quot;pan con bistec&quot; (steak sandwich), &quot;platanos maduros&quot; (sweet plantains), &quot;lechon asado&quot; (pork), &quot;yuca&quot; (cassava root), &quot;flan&quot;, &quot;batido de mamey&quot; (mamey milkshake), papayas and guava paste.

A common lunch staple is the Cuban sandwich (sometimes called a &quot;mixto&quot; sandwich), which is built on Cuban bread and was created and standardized among cigar workers who traveled between Cuba and Florida (especially Ybor City) around the turn of the 20th century.

Cuban versions of pizza contain bread, which is usually soft, and cheese, toppings, and sauce, which is made with spices such as Adobo and Goya onion. Picadillo, ground beef that has been sautéed with tomato, green peppers, green olives, and garlic is another popular Cuban dish. It can be served with black beans and rice, and a side of deep-fried, ripened plantains.

==== Beverages ====

Cuban coffee is popular in the Cuban-American community. Cubans often drink cafe cubano: a small cup of coffee called a cafecito (or a colada), which is traditional espresso coffee, sweetened with sugar, with a little foam on top called espumita. It is also popular to add milk, which is called a cortadito for a small cup or a cafe con leche for a larger cup. Also, a cortadito is 50% milk and 50% coffee, while a cafe con leche has more milk than coffee (about 75% to 25%)

A common soft drink is Materva, a Cuban soda made of yerba mate. Jupiña, Ironbeer and Cawy lemon-lime are soft drinks that originated in Cuba. Since the Castro era, they are also produced in Miami. Other famous Cuban drinks include guarapo de caña.

A popular drink of Cuban origin is the Cuba Libre, a mix of Cuban rum and cola, usually Coca-Cola and mojitos.

==Politics==

Cuban Americans have tended to be more Republican than Democratic, thanks to the anti-communist foreign policy platform of the Republican Party since the 1950s. The failed Bay of Pigs invasion left many Cubans distrustful of the Democratic Party, blaming John F. Kennedy for his handling of the 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion. Cuban exiles began an alliance with the Republican Party of Florida. In Florida, Cuban-American congressmen have tended to be Republican, beginning with Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (Joe Garcia, a Democrat, is an exception). The presence of Cubans in the Republican Party was highlighted by the 2016 presidential race, which featured U.S. Senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio as prominent candidates, both of whom are of Cuban descent. But in New Jersey, another state with many Cuban Americans, Cuban-American congressmen have tended to be Democrats, for example, Representative Albio Sires and Senator Bob Menendez. Ronald Reagan is particularly popular in the Cuban-American community for standing up to Soviet communism and Fidel Castro&#x27;s so-called &quot;exportation of revolution&quot; to Central America and Africa (there is a street in Miami named for Reagan), and George W. Bush received 75 and 78 percent (in 2000 and 2004 respectively) of the Cuban-American vote. The Cuban-American lobby has also lobbied both parties on causes important to Cuban Americans.

Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the death of Fidel Castro, the Cuban-American vote has become more contested between the parties. In the 2008 United States presidential election, Democrat Barack Obama received 47% of the Cuban-American vote in Florida. According to Bendixen&#x27;s exit polls, 84% of Miami-Dade Cuban-American voters 65 or older backed John McCain, while 55% of those 29 or younger backed Obama. In 2012, Barack Obama received 49 percent of the Cuban-American vote in Florida, compared to 47 percent for Mitt Romney according to Edison Research exits polls. By spring 2014, this trend increased among Cuban American voters having a preference for Democratic Party candidates increased particularly for younger voters aged 18–49, increasing to some 56% for the younger voter demographic, versus Cuban-American voters over 50 years of age having a 39% preference for Democratic candidates. As in the 2012 United States presidential election, Mitt Romney got more support than Barack Obama. The 2016 United States presidential election saw Donald Trump garner about the same level support within the community, garnering 50–54 percent of the Floridian Cuban-American vote, as opposed to 41–48 percent for Hillary Clinton, as some Cuban Americans were dissatisfied with Obama&#x27;s Cuba policy, which restored foreign relations with the Cuban government.

In regards to the 2020 United States presidential election in Florida, Trump increased his level of support with younger Cuban Americans. In the aftermath of Trump attempting to overturn the election and the subsequent storming of the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, a report by &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; alleged that Cuban Americans within Miami were among the most ardent believers of his conspiracy theories. Cuban-Americans were the 2nd largest ethnic minority group to have been arrested for the Jan 6, 2021 Capitol riot behind Filipino Americans.

==Socioeconomics==

The median household income for U.S.-born Cuban Americans is $57,000, higher than the overall U.S. median household income of $52,000.

However, the median annual personal earnings for foreign born Cuban Americans is $25,000, which is lower than that of US population at $30,000. Around 20% of Cuban-Americans live in poverty, compared to 25% of Latinos generally and 16% of non-Hispanic Americans. The ability of the average Cuban-American to out-earn the average Latino makes it easier for Cuban-Americans to avoid poverty. Historically, Cuban-Americans have also enjoyed greater benefits due to their &quot;refugee&quot; status within U.S. immigration policy. These benefits, such as those provided by the Cuban American Act of 1966, have allowed Cuban-Americans to enjoy an easier time of navigating economic obstacles.

===Education===
Among U.S.-born Cuban Americans, 36% have a college degree or higher, compared to 30% for the overall U.S. population. Of foreign-born Cuban Americans, 27% have a college degree. This is higher than the U.S. Latino population (14%) but lower than that of the overall U.S. population. According to the Pew Research Center, Cuban-Americans 25 or older who emigrated to the United States after 1990 have the highest graduation rate, at 26%. According to this same data, Cuban-Americans 25 or older who entered the United States before 1980 had a graduation rate of 24%, while those entering between 1980 and 1990 had a graduation rate of 13%. The decline in graduation rate from 1980 to 1990 can in part be attributed to the presence of Afro-Cubans among immigrants, who generally favor more poorly in multiple areas due to systemic inequalities in Cuba.

<text>Anguloa, commonly known as tulip orchids, is a small orchid genus closely related to &quot;Lycaste&quot;. Its abbreviation in horticulture is Ang. This genus was described by José Antonio Pavón and Hipólito Ruiz López in 1798. They named it in honor of Francisco de Angulo, Director-General of Mines of Spain.

This genus is found on the forest floor at high elevations from Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia and Peru. &quot;Anguloa&quot; is closely related to &quot;Lycaste&quot; and &quot;Ida&quot;, and can hybridize with &quot;Lycaste&quot;.

== Description ==

Tulip orchids are rather large terrestrial and sometimes epiphytic plants with fleshy pseudobulbs longer than 20 cm. The long, lanceolate and plicate leaves of a full-grown &quot;Anguloa&quot; can be more than 1 m long. Two to four leaves grow from the base of each pseudobulb. The leaves are deciduous, and are shed at the start of each new growth.

The flowers of these orchids have a strong scent of cinnamon. They are of waxy appearance and are (in wild species) either of two colors, depending on the species – greenish white, or yellow to red. A single flower per inflorescence arises from the base of each new pseudobulb. The white tulip orchids have six inflorescences per pseudobulb, the other can produce up to twelve inflorescences. The sepals have a bulbous shape, resembling a tulip; hence the common name. The lip is three-lobed. The column has four pollinia.

=== Pollination ===
When touched, the lip of the flower rocks back and forth inside the cup-shaped flower as if the lip was a child in a cradle. As a result, it is sometimes known as a cradle orchid. Similarly, it has been known in Columbia as &quot;cuna de Venus&quot; (cradle of Venus). When an orchid bee pollinator lands on the opening of the flower, its weight tips the flower forwards, and the lip moves down to allow the bee inside the flower. Having moved into the flower, the change in the centre of gravity tips the flower back, flipping the lip upwards, pressing the bee against the rostellum and sticky pollinia. On a return visit, the same maneuver presses the pollinia into the flower&#x27;s stigma.

== Species ==
The genus is split into two sections. Section &quot;Guoloanga&quot; includes the yellow and red anguloas such as &quot;A. clowesii&quot;, &quot;A. hohenlohii&quot;, &quot;A. brevilabris&quot;, &quot;A. dubia&quot;, while section &quot;Euanguloa&quot; includes the white anguloas such as &quot;A. uniflora&quot;, &quot;A. eburnea&quot;, &quot;A. virginalis&quot;, and &quot;A. tognettiae&quot;.

There are 13 species of tulip orchids, including 4 apparently of hybrid origin though established in the wild. Other hybrid tulip orchids are bred by horticulturalists, but do not occur in the wild. The following are currently accepted as of May 2014:

<text>Douglas Scott Harkness (29 March 1903 – 2 May 1999) was a Canadian politician.

==Early life and military service==
He was born in Toronto, Ontario, and moved to Calgary, Alberta in 1929. He graduated from the University of Alberta, then farmed and taught school in the vicinity of Red Deer. He taught at Crescent Heights High School until 1939.

He fought during the Second World War from 1940 to 1945, serving in the European theater of war. He was posted to Great Britain, Sicily, Italy and Northwest Europe. In 1943 was awarded the George Medal &quot;in recognition of conspicuous gallantry in carrying out hazardous work in a very brave manner&quot;. Harkness was aboard a troopship when it was torpedoed transiting from Sicily to England. Harkness was awarded the medal for his organization of the abandonment of the ship. In 1945, Harkness was the commanding officer of the 5th Anti-Tank Regiment of the 4th Armoured Division. After returning from the war, Harkness returned to farming, residing in De Winton, Alberta, south of Calgary.

==Member of Parliament==
In 1945, Harkness was elected to the House of Commons of Canada for the constituency of Calgary East and briefly held the Cabinet positions of Minister of Northern Affairs and Minister of National Revenue under the government of John Diefenbaker. He was sworn into the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada on August 7, 1957, as Minister of Agriculture.

Harkness was appointed Minister of National Defence, being sworn in on October 11, 1960. He precipitated a political crisis when he resigned from cabinet in February 1963 to protest Diefenbaker&#x27;s opposition to stationing American nuclear warheads in Canada. The resignation precipitated a split in the cabinet and contributed to the defeat of the government in the 1963 federal election. He continued to sit as a Member of Parliament until 1972.

==Post-political career==
He lived in Calgary until his death in 1999. In 1978 he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. The &quot;Douglas Harkness Community School&quot; in Calgary is named in his honour.

==Parliamentary functions==

* Minister of Agriculture (Acting), (June 21 – August 6, 1957)
* Minister of Northern Affairs and National Resources, (June 21 – August 18, 1957)
* Minister of Agriculture, (August 7, 1957 – October 10, 1960)
* Minister of National Defence, (October 11, 1960 – February 3, 1963)

<doc id="1172644" wikidata="Q251581" url="?curid=1172644" title="Pontiac Torrent">
<text>The Pontiac Torrent is a mid-size crossover SUV produced by General Motors for the 2006 to 2009 model years. A replacement for the Aztek, it was a mildly restyled version of the first-generation Chevrolet Equinox. The Torrent shared its basic body structure and mechanicals with the Equinox. However, the Torrent has a different front and rear end to distinguish it visually from the Equinox. The suspension was also modified to be firmer and sportier, and the electronic power steering was recalibrated to deliver a firmer, less artificial feel.

==Design==

The Torrent shared the Equinox&#x27;s 3.4 L V6 with the 5-Speed Aisin AF33 automatic transmission.

Like other Pontiac models in the lineup, trim levels of the Torrent were entry-level Base, mid-level GT, and performance-oriented GXP. The GXP featured a more powerful 3.6-liter DOHC SFI V6 engine and a six-speed automatic transmission, along with a unique body kit and other exterior styling cues.

==GXP==

The GXP trim came with a new 6 speed automatic transmission (with Manual Tap Up/Down shifting capability) paired to a 3.6 L DOHC SFI V6 with engine, (with a reported 0-60 mph time of 6.9 seconds). Other features include: 18 inch 5-spoke chrome wheels, twin hood scoops, and a unique front and rear body kit. The GXP edition Torrent is long overall, wide, and tall. The GXP Torrent sits lower to the ground and has of ground clearance. The lower stance is accented by the 18 inch wheels and the absent roof rack, giving the Torrent a smoother design flow compared to the standard Torrent. The GXP model also features a performance-tuned suspension, hydraulic power-assisted steering (as opposed to the electric power-assisted standard Torrent), improved interior trim (featuring piano black and chrome trim on the console and dash gauges), dual chrome-tipped exhaust, and GXP specific gauges and console trim. A navigation system is an option along with heated sport leather seats, DVD entertainment system, and Sunroof. The GXP became available for sale in the fall of 2007 as a 2008 model.

General Motors has repeatedly advertised the Torrent GXP on TV commercials claiming that the Torrent GXP had more of a horsepower advantage than the BMW X3 in an effort for GM to make Pontiac a low-cost rival to BMW.

==Podium Edition==

For the 2008 model year, the Torrent received the Podium Edition trim to coincide with the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympic Games. The Torrent Podium Edition was exclusive to the Canadian market.

==Discontinuation==
The Pontiac Torrent was discontinued after the 2009 model year. The last Torrent was manufactured on September 2, 2009 as a result of General Motors discontinuing the Pontiac division in 2010. Originally, a new Buick SUV built on the GM Theta platform was going to be introduced in 2010 to serve as a replacement for the Torrent, but General Motors decided to replace the Torrent with a new GMC SUV built on the GM Theta platform called the GMC Terrain, which went on sale in 2009 for the 2010 model year.

<doc id="1172655" wikidata="Q4294791" url="?curid=1172655" title="Ministry of Finance (Poland)">
<text>Poland&#x27;s Ministry of Finance ( ), headed by the Minister of Finance &quot;(Minister Finansów)&quot;, is part of the government of Poland. Among its powers and responsibilities it drafts the national budget, deals with taxes, financing of the local self-governments and issues related to public debt.

In the area of taxation, the ministry oversees a system of local and regional tax offices. A local tax office is called &quot;urząd skarbowy&quot; (&quot;tax office&quot;), while a higher-level office is called &quot;izba administracji skarbowej&quot; (&quot;revenue administration regional office&quot;). There are approximately 400 of the former throughout the country, and 16 of the latter, one in each voivodeship (province). In each voivodeship there is also one &quot;customs and tax control office&quot; &quot;(urząd celno-skarbowy)&quot;.

The Ministry of Finance existed alongside the Ministry of the Treasury, which was responsible mainly for the management of nationally owned assets, and the Ministry of the Economy.

==Headquarters==
The Ministry of Finance building is located in the quarter of Świętokrzyska, Czackiego, Traugutta and Krakowskie Przedmieście streets in Warsaw

It is an example of socialist realist architecture with elements of art-déco. In 2012, it was entered in the register of monuments.

The building was erected in 1953-1956 for the Ministry of Treasury. It was designed by Stanisław Bieńkuński and Stanisław Rychłowski.

The architecture combines the features of modernism with the canons of socialist realism style, while applying the palace assumptions of the Renaissance and Baroque period.

<text>Ryōan-ji (, , &quot;The Temple of the Dragon at Peace&quot;) is a Zen temple located in northwest Kyoto, Japan. It belongs to the Myōshin-ji school of the Rinzai branch of Zen Buddhism. The Ryōan-ji garden is considered one of the finest surviving examples of &quot;kare-sansui&quot; (&quot;dry landscape&quot;), a refined type of Japanese Zen temple garden design generally featuring distinctive larger rock formations arranged amidst a sweep of smooth pebbles (small, carefully selected polished river rocks) raked into linear patterns that facilitate meditation. The temple and its gardens are listed as one of the Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto, and as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

==History==

The site of the temple was an estate of the Fujiwara clan in the 11th century. The first temple, the &quot;Daiju-in&quot;, and the still existing large pond were built in that century by Fujiwara Saneyoshi. In 1450, Hosokawa Katsumoto, another powerful warlord, acquired the land where the temple stood. He built his residence there, and founded a Zen temple, Ryōan-ji. During the Ōnin War between the clans, the temple was destroyed. Hosokawa Katsumoto died in 1473, and in 1488 his son, Hosokawa Masamoto, rebuilt the temple.

The temple served as a mausoleum for several emperors. Their tombs are grouped together in what are today known as the &quot;Seven Imperial Tombs&quot; at Ryōan-ji. The burial places of these emperors—Uda, Kazan, Ichijō, Go-Suzaku, Go-Reizei, Go-Sanjō, and Horikawa—would have been comparatively humble in the period after their deaths. These tombs reached their present state as a result of the 19th century restoration of imperial sepulchers (&quot;misasagi&quot;) which were ordered by Emperor Meiji.

There is controversy over who built the garden and when. Most sources date it to the second half of the 15th century. According to some sources, it was built by Hosokawa Katsumoto, the creator of the first temple of Ryōan-ji, between 1450 and 1473. Other sources say it was built by his son, Hosokawa Masamoto, in or around 1488. Some say that the garden was built by the famous landscape painter and monk, Sōami (died 1525), but this is disputed by other authors. Some sources say the garden was built in the first half of the 16th century, others reckon later, during the Edo period, between 1618 and 1680. There is also controversy over whether the garden was built by monks, or by professional gardeners, called &quot;kawaramono&quot;, or a combination of the two. One stone in the garden has the name of two &quot;kawaramono&quot; carved into it, Hirokojirō and Kotarō.

The conclusive history, though, based on documentary sources, is as follows: Hosokawa Katsumoto (1430–1473), deputy to the &quot;shōgun&quot;, founded in 1450 the Ryōan-ji temple, but the complex was burnt down during the Ōnin War. His son Masamoto rebuilt the temple at the very end of the same century. It is not clear whether any garden was constructed at that time facing the main hall. First descriptions of a garden, clearly describing one in front of the main hall, date from 1680–1682. It is described as a composition of nine big stones laid out to represent Tiger Cubs Crossing the Water. As the garden has fifteen stones at present, it was clearly different from the garden that we see today. A great fire destroyed the buildings in 1779, and rubble of the burnt buildings was dumped in the garden. Garden writer and specialist Akisato Rito (died c. 1830) redid the garden completely on top of the rubble at the end of the eighteenth century and published a picture of his garden in his &quot;Celebrated Gardens and Sights of Kyoto&quot; (&quot;Miyako rinsen meisho zue&quot;) of 1799, showing the garden as it looks today. One big stone at the back was buried partly; it has two first names carved in it, probably names of untouchable stone workers, so called &quot;kawaramono&quot;. There is no evidence of Zen monks having worked on the garden, apart from the raking of the sand.

==Zen garden==
The temple&#x27;s name is synonymous with the temple&#x27;s famous Zen garden, the &quot;karesansui&quot; (dry landscape) rock garden, thought to have been built in the late 15th century.

The garden is a rectangle of , twenty-five meters by ten meters. Placed within it are fifteen stones of different sizes, carefully composed in five groups; one group of five stones, two groups of three, and two groups of two stones. The stones are surrounded by white gravel, which is carefully raked each day by the monks. The only vegetation in the garden is some moss around the stones.

The garden is meant to be viewed from a seated position on the veranda of the &quot;hōjō&quot;, the residence of the abbot of the monastery. The stones are placed so that the entire composition cannot be seen at once from the veranda.

The wall behind the garden is an important element of the garden. It is made of clay, which has been stained by age with subtle brown and orange tones. In 1977, the tile roof of the wall was restored with tree bark to its original appearance. When the garden was rebuilt in 1799, it came up higher than before and a view over the wall to the mountain scenery behind came about. At present this view is blocked by trees.

The garden had particular significance for the composer John Cage, who composed a series of works and made visual art works based on it.

===Meaning of the garden===

Like any work of art, the artistic garden of Ryōan-ji is also open to interpretation or research into possible meanings. Many different theories have been put forward inside and outside Japan about what the garden is supposed to represent, from islands in a stream, a tiger family crossing a river, mountain peaks, to theories about secrets of geometry or the rules of equilibrium of odd numbers. Garden historian Gunter Nitschke wrote: &quot;The garden at Ryōan-ji does not symbolize anything, or more precisely, to avoid any misunderstanding, the garden of Ryōan-ji does not symbolize, nor does it have the value of reproducing a natural beauty that one can find in the real or mythical world. I consider it to be an abstract composition of &#x27;natural&#x27; objects in space, a composition whose function is to incite meditation.&quot;

===Scientific analysis of the garden===

In an article published by the science journal &quot;Nature&quot;, Gert van Tonder and Michael Lyons analyze the rock garden by generating a model of shape analysis (medial axis) in early visual processing.

Using this model, they show that the empty space of the garden is implicitly structured, and is aligned with the temple&#x27;s architecture. According to the researchers, one critical axis of symmetry passes close to the centre of the main hall, which is the traditionally preferred viewing point. In essence, viewing the placement of the stones from a sightline along this point brings a shape from nature (a dichotomously branched tree with a mean branch length decreasing monotonically from the trunk to the tertiary level) in relief.

The researchers propose that the implicit structure of the garden is designed to appeal to the viewer&#x27;s unconscious visual sensitivity to axial-symmetry skeletons of stimulus shapes. In support of their findings, they found that imposing a random perturbation of the locations of individual rock features destroyed the special characteristics.

Centuries after its creation, the influences of the dry elements at Ryōan-ji continue to be reflected and re-examined in garden design—for example, in the &quot;Japangarten&quot; at the Kunstmuseum Wolfsburg in Germany.

===Other gardens===
While the rock garden is the best-known garden of Ryōan-ji, the temple also has a water garden; the Kyoyochi Pond, built in the 12th century as part of the Fujiwara estate. Cherry trees have recently been planted northwest of the pond.

Ryōan-ji also has a teahouse and tea garden, dating to the 17th century. Near the teahouse is a famous stone water basin, with water continually flowing for ritual purification. 
This is the Ryōan-ji &quot;tsukubai&quot;, which translates as &quot;crouch&quot;; because of the low height of the basin, the user must bend over to use it, in a sign of reverence and humility. The kanji written on the surface of the stone basin, 五, 隹, 止, 矢, are without significance when read alone. Though the water basin&#x27;s frame is circular, the opening in the circular face is itself a square (口). If each of the four kanji is read in combination with 口 (the square-shaped radical is pronounced &quot;kuchi&quot;, meaning &quot;mouth&quot; or &quot;aperture&quot;), which the square opening is meant to represent, then the characters become 吾, 唯, 足, 知. This is read as &quot;ware, tada taru (wo) shiru&quot;, which translates literally as &quot;I only sufficiency know&quot; (吾 = ware = I, 唯 = tada = merely, only, 足 = taru = be sufficient, suffice, be enough, be worth, deserve, 知 = shiru = know) or, more poetically, as &quot;I know only satisfaction&quot;. Intended to reinforce Buddhist teachings regarding humility and the abundance within one&#x27;s soul, the meaning is simple and clear: &quot;one already has all one needs&quot;. Meanwhile, the positioning of the &quot;tsukubai&quot;, lower than the veranda on which one stands to view it, compels one to bow respectfully (while listening to the endless trickle of replenishing water from the bamboo pipe) to fully appreciate its deeper philosophical significance. The &quot;tsukubai&quot; also embodies a subtle form of Zen teaching using ironic : while the &quot;shape&quot; mimics an ancient Chinese coin, the &quot;sentiment&quot; is the opposite of materialism. Thus, over many centuries, the &quot;tsukubai&quot; has also served as a humorous visual koan for countless monks residing at the temple, gently reminding them daily of their vow of poverty. Notwithstanding the exquisite &quot;kare sansui&quot; rock garden on the opposite side of the building, the less-photographed Ryōan-ji tea garden is another cultural treasure of the temple.

<text>Lambda is General Motors full-size or mid-size 3-row crossover SUV automobile platform. It is largely derived from the GM Epsilon platform, which underlies the Chevrolet Malibu sedan and similar models.

The Buick Enclave concept car was previewed at the 2006 North American International Auto Show, and the Saturn Outlook was shown at the 2006 New York Auto Show. The 2007 Outlook and GMC Acadia went into production in late 2006, followed by the 2008 Enclave in mid-2007, and the 2009 Chevrolet Traverse in mid-2008.

Lambda vehicles feature easily accessible three-row seating. They were supplied with the LY7 3.6-liter V6. Starting with the 2009 model year all Lambda vehicles have GM LLT 3.6-liter gasoline direct injection engine for improved fuel efficiency, horsepower and torque. With the cancellation of GM&#x27;s next-generation DOHC V8, there would be no V8 powertrain for the Lambda platform. The platform has been designed for front and all-wheel drive applications.

Lambda vehicles are produced in the new Lansing Delta Township Assembly plant near Lansing, Michigan. The Traverse began production in September 2008 at a retooled Spring Hill Assembly Plant in Tennessee, but production was later moved to Lansing. GM discontinued the Outlook after the 2010 model year along with the entire Saturn brand.

Meanwhile, GM announced a facelift of its GMC Acadia for the 2013 model year, taking the bodyshell of the discontinued Saturn Outlook, while at the same time, GM would refresh its Buick Enclave &amp; Chevrolet Traverse vehicles.

==Minivans==
GM was considering replacing the U-body minivans with new minivans using the Lambda platform for the 2009 model year, but due to the decline of minivan sales the plan was cancelled.

==Vehicles==
Vehicles based on this platform:
* 2007–2010 Saturn Outlook
* 2007–2016 GMC Acadia
* 2008–2017 Buick Enclave
* 2009–2017 Chevrolet Traverse

<doc id="1172681" wikidata="Q2151916" url="?curid=1172681" title="Riding the Bullet (film)">
<text>Riding the Bullet is a 2004 horror film written, co-produced and directed by Mick Garris. It is an adaptation of Stephen King&#x27;s 2000 novella of the same name. The film, which received a limited theatrical release, was not successful in theaters; it earned a domestic gross of $134,711.

==Plot==
Set in 1969, Alan Parker is a young artist, studying at the University of Maine, where his professor believes he is obsessed with death. On October 30, his birthday, he thinks his girlfriend, Jessica, is trying to break up with him. At home, Alan later gets high off of cannabis in his bathtub and begins to contemplate suicide by cutting his wrists.

The Grim Reaper then appears and tries to convince Alan to kill himself so that he can come to the other side. Murals of people painted on the wall also appear to be urging him to kill himself. Alan accidentally cuts himself when Jessica and a group of friends come in to surprise him for his birthday.

Later, Alan wakes up in the hospital. Jessica says that she is angry with him for the &quot;selfish&quot; act he attempted to commit, but also tells Alan that she loves him. She surprises him with concert tickets to see John Lennon in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

The next day, when Alan is released from the hospital, Jessica tells him that he has a wall around him, and Alan realizes that Jessica really was going to leave him. Alan gets a phone call that his mother, Jean, has had a stroke. He makes plans to go home that night, giving the concert tickets to his roommates.

As he tries to hitchhike home to Lewiston, Maine, Alan remembers the funeral of his father, Julian, when he was 6 years old. He envisions the death of his mother, and then himself, with a devastated Jessica weeping at his grave. He is picked up by a Volkswagen van that is driven by Ferris, an army deserter. They narrowly avoid a collision with an oncoming car, spinning out and landing in a ditch. Alan walks away from the incident shaken, but alive.

Alan begins to hallucinate and has multiple experiences with the living and the dead. He sees a billboard for &quot;Ride The Bullet,&quot; a rollercoaster at Thrill Village, which triggers a memory of him standing in line with his mother to ride it, where he ultimately chickened out. He walks through a cemetery and comes across the grave of George Staub, whose grave marker indicates that he died two years ago.

Alan sees an apparition of himself come up through the ground, and the apparition tells him that they are saving a place for him. He is then picked up by a man who he realizes is George Staub. His apparition accompanies him in the car and warns him to not give his real information because there is something wrong with George.

Alan’s apparition notices the smell of formaldehyde from George, which prompts Alan to remember a phrase that he had read in a book, &quot;The dead travel fast&quot;. Alan does not inform George that he knows that George is dead. George asks him about Thrill Village and asks if he rode &quot;The Bullet&quot; and Alan lies and said that he did go on the ride.

George knows that Alan is lying, and he calls Alan by his name. George explains that he was decapitated in a car crash when he tried to pass a truck on a two-lane road, and that he crashed into a produce truck when he swerved to avoid a collision with another car.

George tells Alan that he has to take one person with him, and that Alan has to choose whether it will be Alan&#x27;s mother or Alan. If he does not make a choice, George warns that he will have to take them both. In a moment of panic and fear, Alan chooses his mother to be taken. George throws Alan out of the car, and when he wakes up, Alan is back in the cemetery. He hitches the next ride and finally makes it to the hospital. He is about to go see his mother, when George appears and beats him to the elevator.

Alan, now in his forties, says his mother died of a heart attack while watching television. He married his girlfriend Jessica, but the marriage only lasted a little while. Alan never made a living as an artist, but he continues to paint as a hobby. He goes back to Thrill Village and rides &quot;The Bullet&quot;.

==Production==
Mick Garris wrote an adaptation of &quot;Riding the Bullet&quot;, a Stephen King short story, on spec and struggled to find a purchaser during the early 00s as it wasn&#x27;t an overt &quot;balls-to-the-wall horror movie&quot; compared to other King adaptations. In January 2003, Garris estimated that &quot;Riding the Bullet&quot; could possibly be released that year, followed by &quot;Stephen King&#x27;s Desperation&quot; in 2004. That same month, Garris referred to the film as a &quot;nostalgic drama&quot; and a ghost story. In November 2003, production began in Vancouver with Jonathan Jackson, David Arquette, Barbara Hershey, and Erika Christensen joining the cast and Garris set as director.

Unlike the novella, Garris&#x27; adaptation takes place in 1969, the era that the filmmaker grew up in. Garris wanted to use John Lennon&#x27;s Instant Karma! at the end of the film and was given permission by Yoko Ono. However, it would have cost $50,000 to license the song, which Garris claimed would have been more expensive than any other part of the film.

==Release==
&quot;Riding the Bullet&quot; was released on October 15, 2004, by Innovation Film Group. The film was initially slated to release on October 1, 2004.

===Home media===
The film was released on DVD on April 19, 2005, by Lions Gate Films Home Entertainment.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Riding the Bullet&quot; grossed $101,107 in its opening weekend and ranked 33rd. The film would take in a domestic total of $134,711 before leaving quickly theaters. The film would accumulate $264,505 worldwide.

===Critical reception===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Riding the Bullet&quot; holds an approval rating of 26% based on 23 reviews, with an average rating of 4.3/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads &quot;Stephen King adaptation veteran director Mick Garris has lofty storytelling goals which ultimately flail and undercut the story&#x27;s terror.&quot; On Metacritic, the film holds a weighted score of 37 out of 100 from 8 reviews, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;.

<doc id="1172686" wikidata="Q2782665" url="?curid=1172686" title="Tentmaking">
<text>Tentmaking, in general, refers to the activities of any Christian who, while dedicating herself or himself to the ministry of the Gospel, receives little or no pay for Church work, but performs other (&quot;tentmaking&quot;) jobs to provide support. Specifically, tentmaking can also refer to a method of international Christian evangelism in which missionaries support themselves by working full-time in the marketplace with their skills and education, instead of receiving financial support from a Church. The term comes from the fact that the apostle Paul supported himself by making tents while living and preaching in Corinth (Acts 18:3)

== History ==
Unlike Peter and other apostles in the early Christian Church, who devoted themselves entirely to their religious ministry and lived off the money donated by Church members (see Acts 4:34-37), Paul frequently performed outside work, not desiring to be a financial burden to the young Churches he founded. In Thessaloniki, Paul states that he and his companions &quot;worked night and day, laboring and toiling so that we would not be a burden to any of you&quot; (2 Thessalonians 3:8). Paul&#x27;s purpose in working was to set an example for the Christians, desiring that they did not become idle in their expectation of the return of Christ, but that they would work to support themselves. He also hoped that his refusal to accept financial support would build his credibility among non-Christians, thus giving him the chance to win over more of them (See 1 Corinthians 9, particularly verse 12). For additional glimpses into the Apostle Paul&#x27;s tentmaking ministry see Acts 18:1-3; 20:33-35; Philippians 4:14-16.

Financial support is not the only essence of tentmaking. Instead, the vocational identity coupled with excellence of work and lifestyle influences colleagues to follow Jesus Christ.

==Modern times==
More recently, William Carey (1761-1831), considered to be the father of modern evangelical Christian missions, was a tentmaker in India, working as a factory owner and university professor while fulfilling his mission duties. At the time, international mission work was a new and controversial idea in the Church, and tentmaking was the only way for Carey to support his ministry. His example has led thousands of Christian missionaries to support themselves while ministering overseas.

Furthermore, tentmaking sometimes provides Christians the chance to serve in countries normally closed to mission work. Governments hostile to Christianity often accept well-qualified teachers, doctors, computer technicians, and engineers into their countries to work, even if these men and women are Christians. These professionals are thus able to serve the country and support themselves while performing missions work.

In the Catholic and Orthodox Churches, the term &quot;working clergy&quot; is used to denote men who, whether assigned or not to a parish, must provide for themselves. More often than not, these are married priests who take positions in hospitals or other charitable institutions, although some can be solicitors or school teachers as well. A famous example of a working clergyman was the Orthodox Saint Luke (Voino-Yasenetsky), Bishop of Simferopol and Crimea, who continued to work as a surgeon and medical doctor even after his ordination.

==Digital times, blogging==
Currently more and more laypersons and ministry professionals are spending time online via their blogs and using them to earn an income, both passive and active, through direct advertising sales, affiliate marketing, or promoting other products and services related to their work outside of ministry proper.

They have been referred as &quot;Digital Tentmakers&quot; or &quot;TentBloggers&quot; (tentblogging), those that make money through their blogs.

<doc id="1172700" wikidata="Q247132" url="?curid=1172700" title="Oratory of Saint Philip Neri">
<text>The Confederation of Oratories of Saint Philip Neri (), abbreviated C.O. and commonly known as the Oratorians, is a Catholic society of apostolic life of pontifical right for men (priests and religious brothers) who live together in a community bound together by no formal vows but only with the bond of charity. 

Founded in Rome in 1575 by Philip Neri, today it has spread around the world, with over 70 Oratories and some 500 priests. The post-nominal initials commonly used to identify members of the society are &quot;CO&quot; (&quot;Congregatio Oratorii&quot;). The abbreviation &quot;Cong. Orat.&quot; is also used.

Unlike a religious institute (the members of which take vows and are answerable to a central authority) or a monastery (the monks of which are likewise bound by vows in a community that may itself be autonomous and answerable directly to the pope), the Oratorians commit themselves to membership in a particular, independent, self-governing local community (an Oratory, usually named for the place in which it is located: e.g., Birmingham Oratory, Oxford Oratory, Brooklyn Oratory) without actually taking vows, an unusual and innovative arrangement created by Philip. Normally an oratory must have a minimum of four members, two being ordained, in order to be founded. If a group of men seeks to establish an oratory, they may apply to do so, going through the proper diocesan channels; during the process of formation a member (or members) of a well-established oratory resides in the community to facilitate every aspect of the proposed foundation.

==History==
The Congregation of the Oratory was founded by Philip Neri (1515–1595) in the city of Rome. The first Oratory received papal recognition in 1575. The new community was to be a congregation of secular priests living under obedience but bound by no vows. Speaking of Neri, whom he called &quot;the saint of joy&quot;, Pope John Paul II said, &quot;As is well known, the saint used to put his teaching into short and wise maxims: &#x27;Be good, if you can...&#x27; He did not choose the life of solitude; but, in exercising his ministry among the common people, he also wished to be &quot;salt&quot; for all those who met him. Like Jesus, he was equally able to enter into the human misery present in the noble palaces and in the alleys of Renaissance Rome.&quot;

The core of Philip&#x27;s spirituality focused on an unpretentious return to the lifestyle of the first Disciples of Christ. The object of the institute is threefold: prayer, preaching, and the sacraments.

Up to 1800 the Oratory continued to spread through Italy, Sicily, Spain, Portugal, Poland, and other European countries; in South America, Brazil, India, and Ceylon. Under Napoleon I the Oratory was in various places despoiled and suppressed, but the congregation recovered and, after a second suppression in 1869, again revived. A few houses were founded in Munich and Vienna.

==Governance==
There are 86 Congregations of the Oratory throughout the world. Each Community is autonomous, but there is a Confederation which facilitates contact with the Holy See. As such, the Congregation of the Oratory functions more like a monastic federation than like a religious institute.

Three documents govern the Oratory. The first is the &quot;General Statutes&quot; of the Congregation, which are guidelines to be followed throughout the world; these may be changed or modified when representatives from each Oratory gather every six years in a meeting called a &quot;Congresso Generale&quot;. The second is the &quot;Particular Statutes&quot;, which outline how an individual Oratory is to be conducted; these must be approved by Rome. The third document is the &quot;Constitutions&quot;, which establish general norms, and outline the relationship between the Congregation and the Holy See. As the Oratory is a confederation, there is no central authority such as is found within the Dominicans, Franciscans, or Jesuits. The definitive foundation of an Oratorian Congregation is actually done by the Roman Pontiff directly, which makes a Congregation what is called a &quot;Pontifical Right&quot; foundation.

The Confederation elects one of its own to represent the interests of the Congregations to the Holy See; this is done through the Dicastery for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life. This person, known as the Procurator General, resides in Rome at the Procura General.

==Daily life==
Frederick William Faber described the Oratorian charism as &quot;a spirituality of everyday life&quot;. The Oratory founded by St Philip Neri is a society of priests and brothers who live together under a Rule without taking religious vows. Hence, Oratorians are free to resign their membership in the Congregation without canonical impediment or ecclesiastical dispensation. An Oratorian resides in an Oratory community of his choosing and is permanently stable, i.e., he is not subject to transfer to other Oratories or communities. Oratorians have what is called &#x27;stability,&#x27; which means they are committed as members of the community of a particular Oratory, though a member may move if there is a serious enough reason.

As there is no vow of poverty, Oratorians may keep their possessions, and those who can afford to do so are expected to contribute to the support of the house. It is possible for an ordained secular priest to join the Community if he feels called to a more recollected life in community than is possible in a diocesan presbytery, however the Constitutions do not permit anyone who has been a solemnly professed religious to join the Congregation. Neither is it customary to admit anyone over the age of 45.

Unlike the members of some religious institutes, Oratorians are not bound by a rule to pray in common, though this is something that Oratorians consider important, and they commit themselves to praying together at least twice each day, and having one communal meal which is usually dinner. Oratorians normally have a set time each day for praying together in silent meditation; this ends classically with the recitation of a litany.

Although some oratories may have a dominant mission (e.g., the London Oratory, which maintains a school), in general the members of the Oratory spend the day involved in various ministries: teaching, parish work, spiritual direction, campus ministry, hospital chaplaincies, administration or maintaining the fabric of the community house. Some oratories are specifically connected with parishes and thus its members serve as clergy of the parish.

==Habit==
As secular clergy, Oratorians wear a dress similar to that of diocesan priests. However, the black cassock is worn with a distinctive Oratorian clerical collar: a white cloth that folds over the collar all around the neck, with a number of folds inward, indicating the particular oratory from which the priest originates. The cassock is bound by a fascia. The habit is given at formal reception into the community which comes after a few months of living together to see if the candidate fits in well. Members often, but do not necessarily, wear the cassock whilst engaged in their respective ministries. When not wearing the cassock, members of the Oratory would wear the normal street clothes of a cleric, such as a clerical shirt, but with the Oratorian collar. In some countries such as Spain, Oratorians do not wear the distinctive Oratorian cassock and collar, making them indistinguishable from other secular priests.

==Oratories around the world==
As of 2014, the website of the oratory&#x27;s &quot;headquarters&quot; in Rome lists the following as some of the numerous congregations throughout the world:

===Europe===
There are oratories in: Vienna, Austria; Dijon, Hyères, and Nancy, France; Acireale, Biella, Bologna, Brescia, Florence, Genoa, Naples, Palermo, Rome, Verona, Prato and Vicenza, Italy; Germany (Aachen, Aufhausen, Dresden, Frankfurt, Hanover, Heidelberg, Leipzig, Celle and Munich); Lithuania (Vilnius); Netherlands (Maastricht); Poland (Gostyń, Studzianna, Tarnów, Radom, Bytów, Tomaszów Mazowiecki and Poznań); Portugal (Convento e Palácio de Nossa Senhora das Necessidades), Lisbon); Spain (Barcelona, Seville, Porreras, Albacete, Vic, Alcalá de Henares, Getafe, Tudela, Soller and Palma) and Switzerland (Zürich). There are also Oratories in formation in Bratislava, Slovakia; Mikulov in the Czech Republic; and Dublin, Ireland.

===United Kingdom===
Saint John Henry Newman founded the first Oratory in the English-speaking world when he established the Birmingham Oratory in the city of Birmingham on 2 February 1848. This was initially located at Old Oscott, which Newman renamed Maryvale (after the Oratory church in Rome, Santa Maria in Vallicella). After a couple of moves this community eventually settled in Edgbaston. Attached to the Birmingham Oratory was the Oratory School now at Woodcote, Berkshire, near Reading.

In 1849 a second congregation was founded in King William Street, Strand, London (the London Oratory), with Frederick William Faber as superior; in 1854 it was transferred to Brompton. The Fathers of the London Oratory founded the London Oratory School in 1863, which continues providing education in the Oratorian tradition to this day. Its church, the Church of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, was consecrated on 16 April 1884 and is the second largest Roman Catholic church in London.

A House also exists in Oxford (the Oxford Oratory).

As of October 2013, the church of St Wilfrid, York, was turned over to the Oxford Oratorians on the retirement of the incumbent parish priest and is now canonically established, known as the York Oratory.

In Manchester (St Chad&#x27;s) there is a community canonically established on the Feast of All Saints, 2019.

There are also Houses in Formation at St Alban-on-the-Moors Church, Cardiff, as of April 2016, and in Bournemouth, as of May 2017.

===Latin America and the Caribbean===
In Argentina: (Mercedes); Brazil: (São Paulo); Chile: (Villa Alemana); Colombia: (Bogotá, Ipiales and Pasto); Costa Rica: (San José); Mexico: (Guanajuato, Mexico City, Orizaba, Puebla, San Miguel de Allende, Tlalnepantla, Reynosa, Tamaulipas, La Paz, Leon, San Pablo Tepetlapa y Mérida.

As of 2012 there was an Oratory in Formation in Port Antonio, Jamaica (Archdiocese of Kingston). This community of priests had been constituted many years ago and upon completing the necessary requirements in the Archdiocese of Kingston in 2014 the community was erected as a Congregation of the Oratory of St. Philip Neri, the first in the history of the English speaking Caribbean.

===North America===
In Canada, the Oratorians have a house in Toronto, the Toronto Oratory, although the original foundation was in Montreal in 1975.

The first Oratory in the United States was founded in Rock Hill, South Carolina, in 1934. The ministry of the Rock Hill Oratorians has long included campus ministry at Winthrop University and prison visitation at the Moss detention center in York County.

The Pittsburgh Oratory was founded in 1961 by Cardinal John Wright, then-Bishop of Pittsburgh, in order to have Oratorian Fathers serving as Chaplains at Carnegie Mellon University, Chatham University, and the University of Pittsburgh. The Pittsburgh Oratory&#x27;s ministry has since expanded to adult ministry, confession ministry, and a ministry of Perpetual Eucharistic Adoration. The Pittsburgh Oratory maintains an 87-acre retreat house in the nearby Laurel Highlands, called &quot;Rednal&quot;.

The principal ministry of the Brooklyn Oratory, established in 1988, are the parishes of Saint Boniface, which it has cared for since 1990, and Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Brooklyn Heights which came under its pastoral care in 2016. In this year, the Brooklyn Oratory also began a pastoral outreach to students in the various secular colleges and universities in Downtown Brooklyn and Brooklyn Heights.

The Philadelphia Oratory was formed in 1990 at the Fairmount neighborhood parish of St. Francis Xavier. The oratory then gained responsibility for the parochial grade school: St. Francis Xavier School. It was formally established by Pope John Paul II in 2000.

The Raritan Congregation was formally established by Pope John Paul II, on 8 September 1998 as the New Brunswick Congregation. The members of the Congregation served in Catholic campus ministry at Rutgers University, at St. Peter the Apostle Parish and at St. Joseph Parish, New Brunswick, N.J. until 2018. The Oratory relocated to Raritan, N.J. at the request of Bishop James Checchio. The Raritan Oratory of St. Philip Neri serves five apostolates under its care: the Shrine Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament, St. Ann Church, St. Joseph Church, and St. Ann Classical Academy of Raritan, N.J. and Holy Trinity Church of Bridgewater, N.J.

On 26 May 1994 Cardinal Joseph Bernardin of the Archdiocese of Chicago decreed the formation of a diocesan right Oratory of St. Philip Neri which follow the &quot;Constitutions&quot; and &quot;General Statutes of the Congregration of the Oratory of St. Philip Neri&quot;. Its members continue in pastoral ministries.

The New York Oratory was founded on 28 June 2007, in Sparkill, New York.   On the Feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, 15 August 2007, the Procurator General P. Edoardo Cerrato consigned the Decree of the Foundation of New York Oratory to its members, during the celebration of the Eucharist, presided by Cardinal Egan, in the presence of Archbishop Alojz Tkac, Metropolitan of Košice, Slovakia, participating honorable guests, parishioners of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart Parish Tappan, NY, visitors from other parishes and friends.

In Washington, D.C., the Community of St. Philip Neri was established as a community-in-formation in July 2013 by canonical decree of the Archbishop of Washington, Donald Cardinal Wuerl. Washington&#x27;s Oratorians are responsible for the administration of the parish of St. Thomas Apostle in Woodley Park. They oversee a chapter of the Little Oratory of St. Philip Neri, a group of Catholic laymen. 

The Red Bank Oratory: On Divine Mercy Sunday, April 7th, 2024, His Holiness, Pope Francis established The Red Bank Oratory as a Congregation of Pontifical Right. The church of the Oratory was established as The Oratory Church of St. Anthony of Padua in perpetuity. The Red Bank Oratory had begun in September 2015, as an Oratory-in-formation and was established in Red Bank, New Jersey, with the permission of Bishop David M. O&#x27;Connell. Bishop O&#x27;Connell then issued a canonical decree on 29 May 2016 to govern the community, and established the permanent home of the community at the church of Saint Anthony of Padua. The members of the Oratory-in-Formation subsequently established a Secular Oratory, the Women of Vallicella, a Children&#x27;s Oratory, Jr. Oratory, a Youth Oratory, and the Friends of Saint Philip Neri which share in the spiritual and ministerial life of the Oratory. 

In 2017, Pope Francis issued a decree establishing the Congregation of the Oratory of St. Philip Neri in the Archdiocese of Cincinnati. The Oratory is based at Old St. Mary&#x27;s Church in the Over-the-Rhine neighborhood of Cincinnati. 

There are also congregations are in Monterey, California; Pharr, Texas and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania

A number of Oratories have associated with the congregation, a community of lay people called the Secular Oratory.

===South Africa===
The first Oratory in South Africa was founded in Oudtshoorn in 1997. The Port Elizabeth Oratory celebrated its inaugural Mass on 15 August 2008.

===Australia===
In 2011, work towards establishing the first Australian Congregation of the Oratory of St. Philip Neri was conceived. The community-in-formation was welcomed to Brisbane by Archbishop Mark Coleridge, and is supported by the Fathers of the London, Oxford and Toronto Oratories. The Brisbane Oratory in Formation is based at Mary Immaculate Church, Annerley, in the Annerley Ekibin parish.

<doc id="1172710" wikidata="Q696160" url="?curid=1172710" title="Psychedelic art">
<text>Psychedelic art (also known as psychedelia) is art, graphics or visual displays related to or inspired by psychedelic experiences and hallucinations known to follow the ingestion of psychedelic drugs such as LSD, psilocybin, and DMT. Coined by British psychologist Humphry Osmond, the term &quot;psychedelic&quot; means &quot;mind manifesting&quot;. By that definition, all artistic efforts to depict the inner world of the psyche may be considered &quot;psychedelic&quot;.

In common parlance &quot;psychedelic art&quot; refers above all to the art movement of the late 1960s counterculture and early 1970s counterculture. Featuring highly distorted or surreal visuals, bright colors and full spectrums and animation (including cartoons) to evoke, convey, or enhance psychedelic experiences. Psychedelic visual arts were a counterpart to psychedelic rock music. Concert posters, album covers, liquid light shows, liquid light art, murals, comic books, underground newspapers and more reflected not only the kaleidoscopically swirling colour patterns typical of psychedelic hallucinations, but also revolutionary political, social and spiritual sentiments inspired by insights derived from these psychedelic states of consciousness.

== Features ==
Psychedelic visual art is a broad, widely-represented term, though it is commonly identifiable by its use of one or more of the listed subject matters:
* Fantastic, metaphysical, and surrealistic subject matter
* Kaleidoscopic, fractal, or paisley patterns
* Bright and/or highly contrasting colors
* Extreme depth of detail or stylization of detail, also called Horror vacui style
* Morphing of objects, themes, and/or collages
* Phosphenes, spirals, concentric circles, diffraction patterns, and other entoptic motifs
* Repetition of motifs
* Innovative typography and hand-lettering, including warping and transposition of positive and negative spaces

==Origins==
Psychedelic art is informed by the notion that altered states of consciousness produced by psychedelic drugs are a source of artistic inspiration. The psychedelic art movement is similar to the surrealist movement in that it prescribes a mechanism for obtaining inspiration. Whereas the mechanism for surrealism is the observance of dreams, a psychedelic artist turns to drug induced hallucinations. Both movements have strong ties to important developments in science. Whereas the surrealist was fascinated by Freud&#x27;s theory of the unconscious, the psychedelic artist has been literally &quot;turned on&quot; by Albert Hofmann&#x27;s discovery of LSD.

Mikhail Bulgakov was the first writer to describe narcotic hallucinations.Art researchers Tim Lapetino and James Orok trace the connection of psychedelic art with Dadaism, Surrealism, Lettrism, and Situationism. Notable figures within the psychedelic art movement include Lautreamont, Louis-Ferdinand Celine, Stanislav Witkevich, Antonin Artaud, Georges Bataille, William Burroughs, De Quincey, Terence McKenna, and Carlos Castaneda.

Early examples of &quot;psychedelic art&quot; are literary rather than visual, although there are some examples in the Surrealist art movement, such as Remedios Varo and André Masson. Other early examples include Antonin Artaud who writes of his peyote experience in &quot;Voyage to the Land of the Tarahumara&quot; (1937) and Henri Michaux who wrote of his experiments with mescaline and hashish in his 1956 novel, &quot;Misérable Miracle.&quot; 

Aldous Huxley&#x27;s &quot;The Doors of Perception&quot; (1954) and &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; (1956) remain definitive statements on the psychedelic experience.

Albert Hofmann and his colleagues at Sandoz Laboratories were convinced immediately after its discovery in 1943 of the power and promise of LSD. For two decades following its discovery LSD was marketed by Sandoz as an important drug for psychological and neurological research. Hofmann saw the drug&#x27;s potential for poets and artists as well, and took great interest in the German writer Ernst Jünger&#x27;s psychedelic experiments.

Early artistic experimentation with LSD was conducted in a clinical context by Los Angeles–based psychiatrist Oscar Janiger. Janiger asked a group of 50 different artists to each do a painting from life of a subject of the artist&#x27;s choosing. They were subsequently asked to do the same painting while under the influence of LSD. The two paintings were compared by Janiger and also the artist. The artists almost unanimously reported LSD to be an enhancement to their creativity.

Ultimately it seems that psychedelics would be most warmly embraced by the American counterculture. Beatnik poets Allen Ginsberg and William S. Burroughs became fascinated by psychedelic drugs as early as the 1950s as evidenced by &quot;The Yage Letters&quot; (1963). The Beatniks recognized the role of psychedelics as sacred inebriants in Native American religious ritual, and also had an understanding of the philosophy of the surrealist and symbolist poets who called for a &quot;complete disorientation of the senses&quot; (to paraphrase Arthur Rimbaud). They knew that altered states of consciousness played a role in Eastern Mysticism. They were hip to psychedelics as psychiatric medicine. LSD was the perfect catalyst to electrify the eclectic mix of ideas assembled by the Beats into a cathartic, mass-distributed panacea for the soul of the succeeding generation.

==In 1960s counterculture==

Leading proponents of the 1960s psychedelic art movement were San Francisco poster artists such as: Rick Griffin, Victor Moscoso, Bonnie MacLean, Stanley Mouse &amp; Alton Kelley, Bob Masse, and Wes Wilson. Their psychedelic rock concert posters were inspired by Art Nouveau, Victoriana, Dada, and Pop Art. The &quot;Fillmore Posters&quot; were among the most notable of the time. Richly saturated colors in glaring contrast, elaborately ornate lettering, strongly symmetrical composition, collage elements, rubber-like distortions, and bizarre iconography are all hallmarks of the San Francisco psychedelic poster art style. The style flourished from about 1966 to 1972. Their work was immediately influential to vinyl record album cover art, and indeed all of the aforementioned artists also created album covers.

Although San Francisco remained the hub of psychedelic art into the early 1970s, the style also developed internationally: British artist Bridget Riley became famous for her Op art paintings of psychedelic patterns creating optical illusions. Mati Klarwein created psychedelic masterpieces for Miles Davis&#x27; Jazz-Rock fusion albums, and also for Carlos Santana&#x27;s Latin rock. Pink Floyd worked extensively with London-based designers, Hipgnosis to create graphics to support the concepts in their albums. Willem de Ridder created cover art for Van Morrison. Los Angeles area artists such as John Van Hamersveld, Warren Dayton and Art Bevacqua and New York artists Peter Max and Milton Glaser all produced posters for concerts or social commentary (such as the anti-war movement) that were highly collected during this time. Life Magazine&#x27;s cover and lead article for the September 1, 1967 issue at the height of the Summer of Love focused on the explosion of psychedelic art on posters and the artists as leaders in the hippie counterculture community.

Psychedelic light-shows were a new art-form developed for rock concerts. Using oil and dye in an emulsion that was set between large convex lenses upon overhead projectors the lightshow artists created bubbling liquid visuals that pulsed in rhythm to the music. This was mixed with slideshows and film loops to create an improvisational motion picture art form to give visual representation to the improvisational jams of the rock bands and create a completely &quot;trippy&quot; atmosphere for the audience. The Brotherhood of Light were responsible for many of the light-shows in San Francisco psychedelic rock concerts.

Out of the psychedelic counterculture also arose a new genre of comic books: underground comix. &quot;Zap Comix&quot; was among the original underground comics, and featured the work of Robert Crumb, S. Clay Wilson, Victor Moscoso, Rick Griffin, and Robert Williams among others. Underground Comix were ribald, intensely satirical, and seemed to pursue weirdness for the sake of weirdness. Gilbert Shelton created perhaps the most enduring of underground cartoon characters, &quot;The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers&quot;, whose drugged out exploits held a hilarious mirror up to the hippy lifestyle of the 1960s.

Psychedelic art was also applied to the LSD itself. LSD began to be put on blotter paper in the early 1970s and this gave rise to blotter art, a specialized art form of decorating the blotter paper. Often the blotter paper was decorated with tiny insignia on each perforated square tab, but by the 1990s this had progressed to complete four color designs often involving an entire page of 900 or more tabs. Mark McCloud is a recognized authority on the history of LSD blotter art.

==In corporate advertising==
By the late 1960s, the commercial potential of psychedelic art had become hard to ignore. General Electric, for instance, promoted clocks with designs by New York artist Peter Max. A caption explains that each of Max&#x27;s clocks &quot;transposes time into multi-fantasy colors.&quot; In this and many other corporate advertisements of the late 1960s featuring psychedelic themes, the psychedelic product was often kept at arm&#x27;s length from the corporate image: while advertisements may have reflected the swirls and colors of an LSD trip, the black-and-white company logo maintained a healthy visual distance. Several companies, however, more explicitly associated themselves with psychedelica: CBS, Neiman Marcus, and NBC all featured thoroughly psychedelic advertisements between 1968 and 1969. In 1968, Campbell&#x27;s soup ran a poster promotion that promised to &quot;Turn your wall souper-delic!&quot;
The early years of the 1970s saw advertisers using psychedelic art to sell a limitless array of consumer goods. Hair products, cars, cigarettes, and even pantyhose became colorful acts of pseudo-rebellion. The Chelsea National Bank commissioned a psychedelic landscape by Peter Max, and neon green, pink, and blue monkeys inhabited advertisements for a zoo. A fantasy land of colorful, swirling, psychedelic bubbles provided the perfect backdrop for a Clearasil ad. As Brian Wells explains, &quot;The psychedelic movement has, through the work of artists, designers, and writers, achieved an astonishing degree of cultural diffusion… but, though a great deal of diffusion has taken place, so, too, has a great deal of dilution and distortion.&quot; Even the term &quot;psychedelic&quot; itself underwent a semantic shift, and soon came to mean &quot;anything in youth culture which is colorful, or unusual, or fashionable.&quot; Puns using the concept of &quot;tripping&quot; abounded: as an advertisement for London Britches declared, their product was &quot;great on trips!&quot; By the mid-1970s, the psychedelic art movement had been largely co-opted by mainstream commercial forces, incorporated into the very system of capitalism that the hippies had struggled so hard to change.

==Other material==
Examples of other psychedelic art material are tapestry, blacklight posters printed with fluorescent ink against backgrounds of velvet black which are intended for display under an ultraviolet lamp which causes the colors to glow in the dark, paisley printed cloths, tie-dyed or batiked curtains and stickers with designs and slogans written in loopy, art nouveau-like fonts, clothing, canvas and other printed artefacts and furniture.

==Digital age==

Computer art has allowed for an even greater and more profuse expression of psychedelic vision. Fractal generating software gives an accurate depiction of psychedelic hallucinatory patterns, but even more importantly 2D and 3D graphics software allow for unparalleled freedom of image manipulation. Much of the graphics software seems to permit a direct translation of the psychedelic vision. The &quot;digital revolution&quot; was indeed heralded early on as the &quot;New LSD&quot; by none other than Timothy Leary.
The rave movement of the 1990s was a psychedelic renaissance fueled by the advent of newly available digital technologies. The rave movement developed a new graphic art style partially influenced by 1960s psychedelic poster art, but also strongly influenced by graffiti art, and by 1970s advertising art, yet clearly defined by what digital art and computer graphics software and home computers had to offer at the time of creation. Conversely, the convolutional neural network DeepDream finds and enhances patterns in images purely via algorithmic pareidolia.

Concurrent to the rave movement, and in key respects integral to it, are the development of new mind-altering drugs, most notably, MDMA (Ecstasy). Ecstasy, like LSD, has had a tangible influence on culture and aesthetics, particularly the aesthetics of rave culture. But MDMA is (arguably) not a real psychedelic, but is described by psychologists as an entactogen. Development of new psychedelics such as 2C-B and related compounds (developed primarily by chemist Alexander Shulgin) which are truly psychedelic has provided a fertile ground for artistic exploration since many of the new psychedelics possess their own unique properties that will affect the artist&#x27;s vision accordingly.

Even as fashions have changed, and art and culture movements have come and gone, certain artists have steadfastly devoted themselves to psychedelia. Well-known examples are Amanda Sage, Alex Grey, and Robert Venosa. These artists have developed unique and distinct styles that while containing elements that are &quot;psychedelic&quot;, are clearly artistic expressions that transcend simple categorization. While it is not necessary to use psychedelics to arrive at such a stage of artistic development, serious psychedelic artists are demonstrating that there is tangible technique to obtaining visions, and that technique is the creative use of psychedelic drugs.

<text>Samuel Butler (30 January 1774 – 4 December 1839) was an English classical scholar and schoolmaster of Shrewsbury School, and Bishop of Lichfield. His grandson was Samuel Butler, the author of the novel &quot;Erewhon&quot;.

==Life==
Butler was born at Kenilworth, Warwickshire. He was educated at Rugby School, and in 1791 was admitted to St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. He obtained three of Sir William Browne&#x27;s medals, for the Latin (1792) and Greek (1793, 1794) odes, the medal for the Greek ode in 1792 being won by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. In 1793 Butler was elected to the Craven scholarship, amongst the competitors being John Keate, afterwards headmaster of Eton, and Coleridge. In 1796 he was fourth senior optime and senior chancellor&#x27;s classical medallist. In 1797 and 1798 he obtained the members prize for Latin essay. He acquired the degrees of BA in 1796, MA in 1799, and DD in 1811. In 1797 he was elected a fellow of St John&#x27;s and ordained deacon in the Church of England, and in 1798 became headmaster of Shrewsbury School, the same year as his ordination as priest, at the age of 24.

As a clergyman, he was perpetual curate of Berwick Chapelry near Shrewsbury from 1801 to 1815 and in 1802 he was appointed as vicar of Kenilworth, in 1807 to a prebendal stall in Lichfield Cathedral, and in 1822 to the archdeaconry of Derby; all these appointments he had at the same time as his headmastership, but in 1836 he was promoted to the bishopric of Lichfield (and Coventry, which was separated from his diocese during the same year).

It is in association with Shrewsbury school that Butler is chiefly remembered. During his headmastership its reputation increased greatly, and in the standard of its scholarship was the equal of any other public school in England. He was considered to be &quot;in all essential respects, the originator&quot; of the Praepostor system of placing older boys in authority over younger at the school. He worked despite having for 37 years &quot;a state of permanently impossible relations&quot; with his second master (deputy), John Jeudwine, which, according to school historian J. B. Oldham, &quot;embittered both their lives to the detriment of the school, the scandal of the town and the embarrassment of Butler&#x27;s every action&quot;.

However, there were shortcomings in the welfare of pupils. Fights between boys were said to average seventy a week and were regarded by Dr Butler &quot;with a blind eye&quot;, comfort for boarders was minimal, and complaints about food were continuous, on one occasion leading to a riot. His initials &quot;S.B.&quot; over the gateway to the house he built himself next to the school were said to be a sign for &quot;stale bread, sour beer, salt butter, and stinking beef sold by Samuel Butler&quot;. He tried to suppress games at Shrewsbury, considering football (pre-FA) as &quot;only fit for butcher boys&quot; and &quot;more fit for farmboys and labourers than for young gentlemen&quot;.

Charles Darwin, who recalled loathing the rote learning, was among his notable pupils, as was Butler&#x27;s immediate successor as headmaster, Benjamin Hall Kennedy.

His edition of Aeschylus, with the text and notes of Stanley, was published during 1809–1816, and was somewhat severely criticised by the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;, but Butler was prevented by his appointment to the episcopate from revising it. He also wrote a &quot;Sketch of Modern and Ancient Geography&quot; (1813, reprinted frequently) for use by schools, and published atlases of ancient and modern geography. His large library included a fine collection of Aldine editions and Greek and Latin manuscripts.

When he became bishop his health was overshadowed by asthma and he died at Eccleshall Castle, Staffordshire (the episcopal country residence), in December 1839 aged 65. Bishop Butler is buried at the Collegiate Church of St Mary the Virgin Shrewsbury, the former parish church of Shrewsbury School. After his death the Aldines were sold by auction, the manuscripts purchased by the British Museum. In his will he left a mansion with land at Whitehall in Shrewsbury, which he had bought in 1834 as an intended retirement home, to his grandson Samuel. When the latter had the land redeveloped for housing after the death of his own father, he named one of the roads laid out, Bishop Street, in honour of the grandfather.

Butler&#x27;s life has been written by his grandson Samuel Butler, author of &quot;Erewhon&quot; (&quot;The Life and Letters of Dr. Samuel Butler&quot;, 1896); see also Baker&#x27;s &quot;History of St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge&quot; (ed. JEB Mayor, 1869); Sandys, &quot;Hist. Class. Schol.&quot; (ed. 1908), vol. iii. p. 398.

Butler collected some Greek manuscripts (e.g. Minuscule 202).

<doc id="1172724" wikidata="Q4838380" url="?curid=1172724" title="Baby Pac-Man">
<text>Baby Pac-Man is a hybrid maze and pinball game released in arcades by Bally Midway on October 11, 1982, nine months after the release of &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot;. The cabinet consists of a 13-inch video screen seated above a shortened, horizontal pinball table. The combination fits into roughly the same size space as an upright arcade machine. 7,000 units were produced.

== Gameplay ==
Play begins on the video screen, where the player controls Baby Pac-Man through a maze. Play mechanics are similar to &quot;Pac-Man&quot; in that the object is to navigate the maze while gobbling dots and avoiding ghosts. In contrast to earlier games in the series, &quot;Baby Pac-Man&quot;&#x27;s maze starts with no energizers, which allow Baby Pac-Man to eat the ghosts. Instead, there are two vertical chutes at the bottom edge of the screen, which suspend video play and transfer the game to the pinball table located just below the monitor when the player travels down either of them.

=== Pinball mode ===
The mechanical pinball section operates as a traditional, though smaller, pinball table. The player hits targets with a metal ball using two button-operated flippers. The player may earn energizers, gain new fruit bonuses, and increase tunnel speed, all of which are used in the video mode. After losing a ball, the game resumes on the video screen, but with the chutes closed. The player must clear the maze or lose a life to reopen the chutes. The game ends when the player runs out of lives.

<doc id="1172729" wikidata="Q7106419" url="?curid=1172729" title="Oscillator sync">
<text>Oscillator sync is a feature in some synthesizers with two or more VCOs, DCOs, or &quot;virtual&quot; oscillators. As one oscillator finishes a cycle, it resets the period of another oscillator, forcing the latter to have the same base frequency. This can produce a harmonically rich sound, the timbre of which can be altered by varying the synced oscillator&#x27;s frequency. A synced oscillator that resets other oscillator(s) is called the leader; the oscillators which it resets are called followers. There are two common forms of oscillator sync which appear on synthesizers: Hard Sync and Soft Sync. According to &quot;Sound on Sound&quot; journalist Gordon Reid, oscillator sync is &quot;one of the least understood facilities on any synthesizer&quot;.

==Hard Sync==
The leader oscillator&#x27;s pitch is generated by user input (typically the synthesizer&#x27;s keyboard), and is arbitrary. The follower oscillator&#x27;s pitch may be tuned to (or detuned from) this frequency, or may remain constant. Every time the leader oscillator&#x27;s cycle repeats, the follower is retriggered, regardless of its position. If the follower is tuned to a lower frequency than the leader it will be forced to repeat before it completes an entire cycle, and if it is tuned to a higher frequency it will be forced to repeat partway through a second or third cycle. This technique ensures that the oscillators are technically playing at the same frequency, but the irregular cycle of the follower oscillator often causes complex timbres and the impression of harmony. If the tuning of the follower oscillator is swept, one may discern a harmonic sequence.

This effect may be achieved by measuring the zero axis crossings of the leader oscillator and retriggering the follower oscillator after every other crossing.

This form of oscillator sync is more common than soft sync, but is prone to generating aliasing in naive digital implementations.

==Soft Sync==
There are several other kinds of sync which may also be called Soft Sync. In a Hard Sync setup, the follower oscillator is forced to reset to some level and phase (for example, zero) with every cycle of the leader regardless of position or direction of the follower waveform, which often generates asymmetrical shapes.

In some cases, Soft Sync refers to a process intended to nudge and lock the follower oscillator into the same or an integer or fractional multiple of the leader oscillator frequency when they both have similar phases, similar to a phase-locked loop.

===Reversing Sync===

This form of oscillator sync is less common. This form is very similar to Hard Sync, with one small difference. In Reversing Soft Sync, rather than resetting to zero, the wave is inverted; that is, its direction is reversed. Reversing Soft Sync is more associated with analog triangle core oscillators than analog sawtooth core oscillators.

===Threshold or Weak Sync===

Several kinds of Soft Sync use comparison thresholds:

* Hard Sync which is disabled when the frequency or amplitude of the follower crosses a user-defined threshold.
* Hard Sync which is disabled when the frequency of the follower extends too high above or too far below the frequency of the leader.
* Hard Sync which is disabled when the frequency of the follower is lower than the frequency of the leader.

Soft Sync may accurately refer to any of these, depending on the synthesizer or manufacturer in question.

===Phase Advance &#x27;Sync&#x27;===

The phase of the follower is advanced by some amount when the leader oscillator level crosses some threshold. Used for audio synthesis, this may give an audible effect similar to Soft Sync.

===Reset Inhibit Sync===

When the leader oscillator crosses some threshold, the normal reset of the follower is disabled: it will stick at its final level, positive or negative. When the leader crosses back over some threshold, the follower is reset.

===Overlap Sync===

In this method, the current wave completes but a new waveform is generated at the sync pulse. The tail of the old wave and the new wave are output summed if they overlap.

==Digital Implementation Aspects==

Naive approaches to sync in digital oscillators will result in aliasing. To prevent this, band-limited methods such as additive synthesis, BLIT (Band-Limited Impulse Train) or BLEP (Band-Limited Step) must be adopted to avoid aliasing.

In a digital oscillator, best practice is that the follower will not be reset to the identical phase each cycle, but to a phase advanced by an equivalent time to the phase of the leader at the reset. This prevents jitter in the follower frequency and provides truer synchronization.

For digital oscillators, Reversing Sync may less frequently generate aliasing. This effect may be naively implemented by measuring the zero axis crossings of the leader oscillator and reversing the slope of the follower oscillator after every other crossing.

For digital implementation, note that none of the Threshold or Weak Sync methods actually synthesize the waveform in a way different from Hard Sync (rather, they selectively deactivate it).

Overlap sync is primarily a digital technique with simple implementation, such as used in FOF; an analog implementation could be a highly damped sine oscillator excited by the reset pulse.

==Sync-based Architectures==

A variety of synthesis architectures are based on sync, often used in conjunction with amplitude, frequency, or phase modulation. Such architectures include VOSIM and physical modelling synthesis.

<text>The Robert Kingery Expressway, formerly called the Tri-State Highway, is a three-mile-long (5 km), eight-lane freeway in the northeastern part of the U.S. state of Illinois. It carries Interstate 80 (I-80) and I-94 from the Illinois–Indiana border at the Borman Expressway west to Illinois Route 394 (IL 394), I-294 (the Tri-State Tollway), and the southern end of the Bishop Ford Freeway (where I-94 turns north to downtown Chicago). It also carries U.S. Route 6 (US 6) west from the Indiana state line to the US 6 exit with IL 83 (Torrence Avenue).

==Route description==

The Kingery Expressway begins at an interchange with the Tri-State Tollway to the west, the Bishop Ford Freeway to the north, and IL 394 to the south. From here, the expressway heads east through Lansing. The highway then reaches its only exit, a junction with IL 83 and US 6; east of here, US 6 runs concurrently with the expressway. Past the exit, the highway continues east; it briefly curves east-southeast before crossing into Indiana and becoming the Borman Expressway.

==History==
The Tri-State Expressway opened to traffic on November 1, 1950. The highway was renamed the Kingery Expressway in 1953, two years after the death of Robert Kingery. He was a former director of the Illinois Public Works, a regional director for the Chicago Regional Planning Association, as well as a proponent of the current northeastern Illinois tollway configuration until his death in 1951. The expressway was rebuilt in 2005–2007 to add traffic lanes and better accommodate the large amount of truck traffic that travels between Chicago and all points east and southeast. Construction was completed in July 2007. Among the improvements is the separation of traffic heading to the Bishop Ford Freeway and Torrence Avenue, with the westbound split for the Bishop Ford east of Torrence near Burnham Avenue, and an eastbound collector-distributor lane allowing a right hand exit from either I-80 or I-94 eastbound to Torrence without having to cross expressway through lanes. The Southland Interchange with the Bishop Ford Freeway, IL 394, and the Tri-State Tollway was also rebuilt and reconfigured.

<text>The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) is the national urban planning authority of Singapore, and a statutory board under the Ministry of National Development of the Government of Singapore.

==Mission==
The authority was established on 1 April 1974, and is of critical importance to the city-state. Singapore is an extremely dense country where land usage is required to be efficient and maximized. The city state is trying to reduce land wastage in the face of land shortage in the area.

==URA&#x27;s responsibilities==

===Land use planning===
URA&#x27;s main responsibility is land-use planning. URA planners devise both long-term strategic plans, along with medium-term plans, which are reviewed every five to ten years. These plans designate the land use and urban density for the entirety of Singapore. These designations are divided by URA into 55 planning areas.

===Development control===
It is the responsibility of URA to evaluate and grant planning approval for development projects from the public and private sectors. In approving development applications, the URA states its goal is to foster orderly development conforming to the planning guidelines as stated in the statutory Master Plan and the existing control factors. URA tries to provide quality service when working in partnership with building industry professionals and the general public to foster development.

===Urban design===
URA is responsible for the urban design of the city. For areas of special interest, such as the Singapore River area, the Orchard Road shopping belt, and the Marina Bay, URA devises specific medium and short-term urban design and land use plans. It also works with other government agencies in enhancing the city&#x27;s urban design.

===Building conservation===
Building conservation in Singapore is the responsibility of URA, which issued a Conservation Master Plan in 1989. This plan laid down guidelines and processes for the conservation of culturally and historically significant buildings. More than 7,000 buildings in Singapore have been gazetted as conserved buildings.

===Land sales===
URA also sells land by tender on behalf of the Singapore government to meet demand from private developers. URA deals with tenders for government land and applications to buy reserved land.

===Car park management===
The URA plays an important role in managing all public car parks outside of Housing Development Board estates. It provides information and services to the public in regard to coupon parking, season parking, and heavy vehicle parking. URA also sets the bylaws to parking infringement and fines.
==The URA Centre==
In keeping with URA&#x27;s function as the authority for urban design in Singapore, the URA Centre was conceptualised by URA&#x27;s in-house architects. Kenzō Tange Associates and Kajima Design Asia Pte Ltd served as design consultants. The building consists of two blocks: a 16-floor tower block, and a 5-floor podium block.

==The Singapore City Gallery==

The URA maintains a regular and ever updated public urban planning exhibition on the first three floors of their headquarters. Highlights include three scale models of the island of Singapore, the central region, and the central area. Special exhibits and models on current projects and developments island-wide are regularly displayed as well.

<doc id="1172760" wikidata="Q7444157" url="?curid=1172760" title="Secret broadcast">
<text>A secret broadcast is, simply put, a broadcast that is not for the consumption of the general public. The invention of the wireless was initially greeted as a boon by armies and navies. Units could now be coordinated by nearly instant communications. An adversary could glean valuable and sometimes decisive intelligence from intercepted radio signals:

* messages that were not encrypted or poorly encrypted could be read
* order of battle and future intentions could be deduced by traffic analysis
* individual units could be located using direction finding

In the 1920s, the United States was able to track Japanese fleet exercises, even through fog banks by monitoring their radio transmissions.

A doctrine was developed of having units in the field, particularly ships at sea, maintain radio silence except for urgent situations, such as reporting contact with enemy forces. Ships in formation reverted to pre-wireless methods, including semaphore and signal flags, with signal lamps used at night. Communication from headquarters were sent by one-way radio broadcasts.

==&quot;Personal messages&quot; on propaganda stations==
During World War II, the BBC would include &quot;personal messages&quot; in its broadcasts of news and entertainment to occupied-Europe. Often they were coded messages intended for secret agents. Leo Marks attributes this idea to Georges Bégué, an agent for the Special Operations Executive who felt their use could eliminate a lot of the two-way radio traffic that often compromised agents. Such messages were also used to authenticate agents to sources of assistance in the field. The agent would arrange to have the BBC broadcast any short phrase the other person chose.

==Numbers stations==

In the mid-20th century, the High Frequency radio bands were used by numerous stations sending seemingly random Morse code, usually in five-letter groups. As more advanced communications methods, such as teleprinter and satellite, took over, the number of such stations diminished, but another type appeared that transmitted spoken and also seemingly random number and letter groups, the latter usually using words from a radio alphabet such as ICAO/NATO alphabet.

Though there has been no official confirmation (beyond a 1998 article in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; which quoted a spokesperson for the Department of Trade and Industry as saying, &quot;These [numbers stations] are what you suppose they are. People shouldn&#x27;t be mystified by them. They are not for, shall we say, public consumption.&quot;) there is little doubt that most of these numbers stations are primarily used to send messages to spies and other clandestine agents (additional possible uses include communication with embassies when a crisis might dictate destruction of cryptographic equipment and as a backup to normal command systems in wartime). Other intended recipients of secret broadcasts have faster and easier-to-use equipment at their disposal. But number stations are ideal for spies in that they require no special equipment, beyond a short-wave receiver. Morse code skills, once a staple of spy training, are no longer required.

==Problems with secret broadcast==
An issue in the past has been the limited bandwidth of the broadcast. Morse code was typically sent at 25 words per minute. Teleprinters could operate at or above 60 words per minute. The military uses a message precedence system to prioritize critical traffic, but all too often, senior commanders insisted on high precedence for lengthy messages lacking real urgency.

<text>Íþróttafélagið Fylkir (, ) is a multi-sport club in Árbær, in the eastern part of Reykjavík, the capital of Iceland. It features departments in football, handball, volleyball, gymnastics and karate.

== Kit ==
The Fylkir official home kit is combined of an orange jersey, black shorts and orange socks. The away kit is combined of a blue jersey and shorts and white socks. The original kit is combined of a white and blue shirt, white shorts and white socks (alternatively blue socks).

== History ==
Fylkir was founded in 1967 on May 28 in a newly established suburb of Reykjavik, Árbær, by young and enthusiastic footballers who wanted to train and play football in their own neighbourhood. From the start, the club has emphasized the importance of youth development and for the first years Fylkir did not field a senior team. The original name of the club was KSÁ (Knattspyrnufélag Seláss og Árbæjar), the name was considered inconvenient and thus after a member vote, it was changed to Fylkir.

The senior team took first part in a national competition in 1972 and became that year second in their heat in the Icelandic 3. division. That was not enough to for Fylkir to gain promotion and for five successive years the team played in Division Three. All these years Fylkir was on the edge of promotion but it was not until 1977 that the dream came true. Fylkir earned a promotion to the 2. division after a historical Third Division Final in which Fylkir had to field its B-team because the majority of the normally starting eleven had gone to Spain on a long before pre-paid holiday!

The next six years, Fylkir played in Division Two, only once being close to gaining promotion. From 1984 to 1988, Fylkir roller-coasted between the Second and the Third Division and it was not until 1989 that Fylkir played its first season in Division One – the top league in Iceland at that time. The season was no success, Fylkir became ninth and was relegated, but the season is nevertheless an interesting one as three players – Kristinn Tómasson, Þórhallur Dan Jóhannsson and Finnur Kolbeinsson – who are now legends at the club, played their first season at a top level.

The next time Fylkir earned a promotion to Division One was in 1993, but just as in 1989 the team became ninth and was relegated. In 1996, history reapeted itself for the third successive time, Fylkir occupied the club&#x27;s seemingly beloved ninth place and was once again relegated to Division Two.

In the year 1999, Fylkir was promoted to the top league – now called the Premier League – for the fourth time. The following year of 2000 Fylkir was only two points from winning the league, in its first year after promotion. The second place earned the club its first games in a European competition.

In 2001, Fylkir won the Icelandic Cup for the first time, but finished fifth in the Premier League after leading the competition for the first two-thirds of it. In the UEFA cup, Fylkir won Pogoń Szczecin from Poland 2–1 in the club&#x27;s first European game. In Poland, Fylkir equalized in the last minute of the game to the euphoria of its 200 dedicated supporters who had travelled to Poland to support their team. 3–2 in aggregate and Fylkir were through to the second Qualifying Round. The opponents, Roda JC Kerkrade from the Netherlands, proved to be stronger than the Poles. Roda won the first game in the Netherlands, 3–0, a game in which football played a side role as it took place September 11. In Iceland, Fylkir scored the first goal, but the Dutch side the next three, ending the European adventure for Fylkir.

The Cup victory in 2001 earned Fylkir a spot in the UEFA cup for the second successive year, the opponents this time being Royal Excelsior Mouscron from Belgium. The teams drew 1–1 in Iceland and Mouscron won the game in Belgium 3–1. In the Icelandic Premier League 2002, Fylkir became second after a last minute battle with KR. Fylkir repeated the Cup success and won the competition for the second year in a row.

Forty years after its establishment, Fylkir is still a club with strong roots in its neighbourhood and the majority of its players and staff are born and bred in Arbaer. The club is now one of the bigger clubs in Iceland and the senior side has established itself as a prominent Premier League team after years of constant travelling between divisions.

In the season of 2006, Fylkir was not a big success. They finished 8th, staying in the Premier League by only two points. Instead, Grindavík were relegated after getting a 1–1 draw against the Icelandic Champions, FH, when they needed to win.

2007 proved to be a good year for Fylkir, after sitting firmly at the middle of the table all season, Fylkir ended up in 4th place, earning a spot in the UEFA Intertoto Cup in 2008. Fylkir also reached the VISA-Cup semi-final but a shocking loss to 1st Division team Fjölnir ended their hopes for a third Cup win during the decade.

2007 was also a good year for Fylkir U20 team as they won the Icelandic division for U20 teams for the first time in the club&#x27;s history.

2008 proved to be a rather difficult season for Fylkir. They started the season with two defeats, but then followed three victories and things were starting to look good. But then the troubles really begun, a terrible run of games sent Fylkir into the relegation zone. On 28 August 2008 Fylkir sacked manager Leifur Garðarsson and Sverrir Sverrisson stepped in as caretaker manager for the rest of the season. Fylkir managed to stay out of relegation and ended up in 9th place with 22 points. The 2008 season in Iceland was the first one with 12 teams. Fylkir reached the VISA-Cup semi-final but lost to Fjölnir for a second time in a row. They lost 3–4 after a thrilling match which was very hard for the supporters to take.

In the first round of the 2008 Intertoto Cup, Fylkir managed a 2–1 first leg victory in Latvia against FK Rīga. However, the visiting club won the return leg 2–0, taking the tie 3–2 on aggregate.

At the start of October 2008 Fylkir announced Ólafur Þórðarson as their new manager. Ólafur had worked for the club before, he was a player/manager for two seasons 1998 and 1999. His first season in 2009 proved very successful as Fylkir finished 3rd in the league, only 8 points behind champions FH, which gave the club a spot in the Europa League. So there were good expectations before the season in 2010 but the team failed to repeat the success from the earlier season. Fylkir finished 9th and stayed out of relegation with two wins in the last two home games against two bottom half teams Grindavík and Haukar who eventually got relegated.

In the first round of the 2010 Europa League, Fylkir was drawn against Torpedo-BelAZ Zhodino from Belarus. The Eastern Europe team dominated the tie and won comfortably 6–1 on aggregate.

In 2011 Fylkir ended the season in 7th place in a season who had many ups and downs. The team managed to stay out of the relegation battle, which was a step up from the earlier season. But things got tougher as the club sold one of their key players when Andrés Már Jóhannesson signed for Norwegian club FK Haugesund in the beginning of August. Also many senior players had injuries in the second half of the season, which meant that the team average age was relatively low in the last games of the season. Club legend Gylfi Einarsson returned after 10 years as a professional footballer. Gylfi scored in the first match, but struggled with injuries and was forced to retire from football at the end of the season. Ólafur Þórðarson left his job as a manager after the season, and Ásmundur Arnarsson was appointed manager in October. Ásmundur had managed neighbour club Fjölnir for seven years before joining Fylkir, and as mentioned earlier had knocked Fylkir out of the cup semi-finals in 2007 and 2008.

The new manager had a difficult start with some bad results in pre-season. Some Icelandic football experts predicted that Fylkir would have a very difficult season, and named them as one of the favourites to get relegated. But the 2012 season turned out to be fine as the team finished 7th and where actually only few seconds away from reaching 6th, but Grindavik equaliser against Fylkir in the 95-minute of the last game prevented that from happening. Ingimundur Níels Óskarsson gave a big contribution with 10 league goals and the only foreigner in the team Irish center half David Elebert gave the team a much needed defensive stability.

2013 season started dreadfully as Fylkir had their worst start in the club&#x27;s history. After the first half of the season (11 matches) the team only had 4 points, with 7 losses, 4 draws and not a single win. But a remarkable second round saw the club slowly reaching out of the relegation spots and get into a more comfortable position. The big turnaround is largely thanks to the board&#x27;s decision to keep Ásmundur Arnarsson as a manager and some player changes made in the transfer window. Local hero Ásgeir Börkur Ásgeirsson returned after a loan spell at Norwegian club Sarpsborg 08 FF and made an instant impact with an explosive performance against Valur in his first game. That was Fylkir&#x27;s twelfth game and their long waited first win of the season. Andrés Már Jóhannesson who came on loan from FK Haugesund at the end of May, got back to his best form after being injured for a long period, and produced some brilliant performances in the following games, before heading back to Norway in the middle of August. But undoubtedly the best player of the season was striker Viðar Örn Kjartansson who finished one of the league top scorer with 13 goals. The team once again finished in 7th place, the third year in a row.

Fylkir had been a top division side for 16 consecutive years (since 2000) until relegation in 2016 and had the second longest run in the top division, with KR being the only team with a longer stay (since 1979).

== Sports played ==

Besides football, Fylkir participates in volleyball, handball, gymnastics, and karate.

== Stadium ==

The Fylkir stadium is called Fylkisvöllur meaning simply &quot;Fylkir Stadium.&quot; Up until Fylkir&#x27;s promotion to Premier League in 1999, Fylkir had no stadium seats but a comfortable grass hill was sufficient to the thousands of dedicated supporters who followed the team. After the promotion, concrete stands were put in, merely to make it a legal stadium for the Premier League. Since then the Icelandic Football Association has changed the rules, which left Fylkir with a stadium that met no requirements. Fylkir and Reykjavik City Council reached an agreement in January 2013 regarding the reconstruction of the stadium. In the 2014 season Fylkir&#x27;s supporters finally got a fully comprehensive stadium with a roof. The seated capacity also enlarged from 830 to 1854.

== Official supporters club ==

Fylkir&#x27;s official supporters club is called Kiddi Tomm, named after a former Fylkir player, Kristinn Tomasson, who was a leading striker for Fylkir all his career except playing for Fram one season. The club was formed before the 2007 season, following several previous supporters clubs of Fylkir. The club voted defender Kristjan Valdimarsson as their player of the year for the 2007 season. Their website is fylkismenn.is 

== Local pub ==
The local pub is called Blásteinn (e. Blue Stone). Fylkir supporters gather at Blásteinn before and after matches, sometimes being joined by Fylkir players and coaches.

<doc id="1172775" wikidata="Q594120" url="?curid=1172775" title="Chevrolet Monte Carlo">
<text>The Chevrolet Monte Carlo is a two-door coupe that was manufactured and marketed by the Chevrolet division of General Motors. Deriving its name from the city in Monaco, the Monte Carlo was marketed as the first personal luxury car of the Chevrolet brand. Introduced for the 1970 model year, the model line was produced across six generations through the 2007 model year, with a hiatus from 1989 until 1994. The Monte Carlo was a variant of the Pontiac Grand Prix throughout its production.

From 1970 until 1972, the Monte Carlo rode on the unique &quot;A-Special&quot; platform with the Grand Prix, shifting to the standard A-body intermediate chassis from the 1973 through 1977 model years. For 1978, the Monte Carlo line underwent downsizing, but was still considered a midsized coupe. The rear-wheel drive A-body platform of this generation of Monte Carlo was redesignated as the G-body when GM&#x27;s front-wheel drive A-body cars were introduced for the 1982 model year. After an abbreviated 1988 model year, the Monte Carlo was replaced by the two-door Chevrolet Lumina.

For the 1995 model year, the Monte Carlo was revived, replacing the two-door Lumina. It shared the front-wheel drive W-platform with the two-door Grand Prix, and was the largest coupe in the Chevrolet lineup. After the 2002 model year, the Grand Prix coupe was discontinued, the Monte Carlo became the largest two-door model produced by an American auto manufacturer.

In response to declining sales of the model line, Chevrolet discontinued the Monte Carlo after the 2008 model year. During much of its production, the Monte Carlo represented the Chevrolet brand in stock car racing. During the 1980s, the Monte Carlo SS was introduced, featuring aerodynamically-enhanced styling; as part of its revival, the Monte Carlo again represented Chevrolet in stock car racing from 1995 through its discontinuation.

==Development==
For the 1968 model year, GM instituted a split-wheelbase policy for its A-platform intermediate-sized cars. Two-door models would have a wheelbase, for sedans, and for station wagons. In 1969, GM introduced the Pontiac Grand Prix, a two-door that used the A-platform layout that was stretched ahead of the firewall to make it long. This gave the design an unusually long hood design, helping the new Grand Prix to outsell its larger B-body predecessor despite higher prices. The new layout was first known as the A-body Special, but would evolve into its own class known as the G-platform.

The Monte Carlo began as Chevrolet&#x27;s version of the Pontiac Grand Prix, as conceived by Elliot M. (Pete) Estes, general manager of Chevrolet, and Chevrolet&#x27;s chief stylist, David Holls, giving Chevrolet and Pontiac an alternative to the E-body Buick Riviera and Oldsmobile Toronado. They modeled the styling on the contemporary Cadillac Eldorado. However, much of the body and structure were shared with the Chevrolet Chevelle (firewall, windshield, decklid, and rear window were the same). New exterior &quot;coke bottle styling&quot; featured concealed windshield wipers. A fiber-optic exterior light monitoring system was optional.

A mid-1990s article in the magazine &quot;Chevrolet High Performance&quot; stated that the first generation Monte Carlo was known to Chevrolet management under the working name &quot;Concours&quot;. The usual practice at the time was that all Chevrolet model development names started with a &quot;C&quot;. At one point, the proposal called for a formal coupe, sedan, and convertible. It has been noted that the sedan resembled a full-size Oldsmobile 98 before the use of the GM G platform, with at least one photograph showing the pull-up door handles that would be introduced on the 1970 Camaro and then on 1971 Vegas and full-sized Chevys. Monte Carlos received this design on the 1973 second-generation model. The 1970 Monte Carlo was available only as a two-door hardtop.

The Monte Carlo was developed at Chevrolet under the leadership of Pete Estes, it was formally introduced in September 1969 by John Z. DeLorean, who succeeded Estes as Chevrolet&#x27;s general manager earlier in the year after previously heading the Pontiac division, where he led the development of the Series 276 Grand Prix.

==First generation (1970–1972)==
===1970===
The styling of the 1970 model-year Monte Carlo is distinguished by its chromed rectangular grille having a fine grid pattern of 720 small squares with two horizontal dividers and centered in it was a chrome and red crest emblem adorned by a Corinthian helmet (commonly referred to as the &quot;knight&#x27;s crest&quot;), a thin hood spear with no vertical hood ornament, round headlamps with rounded chrome bezels (which appeared on a prototype 1970 Chevelle front end proposal which was rejected for the four headlight design), circular parking lamps inset into the front bumper directly below the headlamps, and taillights with chrome trim around the perimeter of the lens, only.

The standard powertrain was the Chevrolet &quot;Turbo-Fire&quot; small-block V8 with a two-barrel carburetor, rated at (gross) at 4500 rpm and of torque at 2800 rpm, mated to a column-mounted 3-speed Synchro-Mesh manual transmission. Front disc brakes were standard equipment. The dashboard was identical to the Chevelle except for simulated wood veneer trim, which was according to the Chief Stylist a photographic reproduction of the elm trim used by Rolls-Royce, and higher grade nylon or vinyl upholstery and deep-twist carpeting were used. Base priced at US$3,123, the Monte Carlo cost $218 more than a comparable Chevelle Malibu, yet lower than a Chevrolet Caprice Sport Coupe.

Various options were available. A two-speed Powerglide automatic transmission (on engines only), three-speed Turbo-Hydramatic, or a four-speed manual; most Monte Carlos were built with the Turbo-Hydramatic. Variable-ratio power steering, power windows, air conditioning, power seats, &quot;rally&quot; wheels, bucket seats, center console, full instrumentation, rear wheel fender skirts, and other accessories were also available, bringing the price of a fully equipped Monte Carlo to more than $5,000.

Optional engines included the four-barrel carbureted &quot;Turbo-Fire&quot; small block V8, rated at at 4800 rpm and at 3200 rpm; the &quot;Turbo-Fire&quot; () with a two-barrel carburetor, rated at at 4800 rpm and at 3800 rpm; and the &quot;Turbo-Jet&quot; () with a four-barrel carburetor, rated at at 4800 rpm and at 3200 rpm.

The &quot;sporty&quot; and most powerful option was the Monte Carlo SS 454 package. Priced at $420, it included a standard Turbo-Jet () with a four-barrel carburetor, rated at at 4800 rpm. It also included heavy-duty suspension, wider wheels and tires, &quot;SS 454&quot; badging, and an automatic load-leveling rear suspension. The Turbo Hydra-Matic three-speed automatic was the only transmission available for this package. The rear axle came standard with a 3.06 ratio, with 2.56 and 3.31 available for $222 extra. Total SS 454s production was 3,823 for the year.

A labor strike at Chevrolet&#x27;s Flint, Michigan, assembly plant (where most Monte Carlo production was scheduled) during the early months of the 1970 model year immediately following the car&#x27;s introduction on September 18, 1969, limited overall model-year sales to 159,341; short of the projected 185,000. During those early months, Monte Carlos were in short supply, with full production not achieved until February 1970.

&quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; reported that 82% of readers who bought a Monte Carlo got one for the styling. However, 10.1% of readers disliked the amount of rear legroom.

===1971===
The 1971 model saw minor styling changes, mostly cosmetic. The headlamp bezels were more of a squircle shape with rectangular front parking lamps. The grille had no horizontal divider, and the openings were rectangular. The hood spear included a stand-up ornament with &quot;Chevrolet&quot; script lettering. The grill emblem featured the year, &quot;1971&quot; in Roman numerals. The trunk lock keyhole had the Monte Carlo crest surrounding it. The taillights now had two horizontal and one vertical chrome strip. The SS model featured new &quot;European&quot; symbol control knobs and a four-spoke steering wheel became optional. AM/FM stereo radios with 8-track tape players were also optional. Mechanically it was largely unchanged, although the small-block Turbo-Fire 400 two-barrel engine was dropped. Other engines had compression ratios lowered to allow the use of regular leaded, low-lead, or unleaded gasoline, per a GM corporate edict. Engine ratings fell to for the base Turbo-Fire two-barrel, for the Turbo-Fire 350-4V, and for the Turbo-Jet 400. The SS 454 engine was raised to a nominal rating despite the reduction in compression ratio. This increase in horsepower resulted from the 454 engine using the more aggressive camshaft compared to the previous 454 rating in the 1970 Chevrolet Corvette and full-sized sedans.

Chevrolet listed both gross and SAE net horsepower figures in 1971, with the impending change to SAE net ratings in 1972. The ratings compared as follows:

After this year, the SS 454 package would be discontinued after the production of 1,919 units, but the 454 CID V8 engine would remain optional in Monte Carlos through 1975. The reason for discontinuing the SS was that the Monte Carlo was marketed as a luxury vehicle instead of a muscle car.

The Monte Carlo was considered the best-suited Chevrolet model for stock car racing by most NASCAR teams due to its wheelbase (only one inch above NASCAR&#x27;s minimum requirements at that time, the Chevelle two-door body style had a shorter 112-inch wheelbase) and long-hood design which placed the engine further back in the chassis than most other vehicles for better weight distribution. Thus, the Monte Carlo became Chevy&#x27;s standard-bearer for NASCAR from 1971 until 1989.

Production of the 1971 Monte Carlo started slowly due to a 67-day corporate-wide walkout (labor strike) that coincided with the introduction of the 1971 models in September 1970. This left dealerships with only a small shipment of 1971 models (built before the strike) in stock until the strike was settled in mid-November 1970, and then slow-going in reaching normal production levels until around January 1, 1971. Model-year production ended at 128,600, including 1,919 SS models.

A total of twelve 1971 Monte Carlos were shipped to Australia in 1971 and converted to RH drive, four of these were SS models from the 1,919 produced.

===1972===
A Cadillac-like egg-crate grille similar to the 1971 Chevrolet Caprice, rectangular front parking lamps moved to the left and right edges of the grille, a wider hood spear without stand-up ornament, and a metal rear trim molding highlighted the changes to the 1972 Monte Carlo, the final year for the first-generation design. The SS was dropped, but a new Monte Carlo Custom option appeared as a one-year-only offering that included a unique suspension and other items previously included with the SS option. Unlike the departed SS package, it was available with any engine on the roster. The Monte Carlo Custom badging was similar to the Impala Custom.

The engines were essentially unchanged, but an industry-wide switch to SAE net hp numbers reduced the rated power of all Chevrolet engines. Chevrolet did not list gross horsepower figures for 1972. Compared to the 1971 model year output, only the 402 and 454 had a decrease in power. The new ratings for the Monte Carlo were:
In California, which had emissions standards more stringent than federal law, the 4-barrel carbureted 350 was the standard and only available engine. Also, the only transmission offered in California was the Turbo Hydramatic.

For 1972, the four-speed manual transmission was discontinued from the option list as a line in the Monte Carlo brochure describing its market position as a personal luxury car stated, &quot;Sorry, no four-on-the-floor.&quot; The standard three-speed manual and optional two-speed Powerglide automatic transmissions were offered only with the base 350 CID two-barrel engine, with the three-speed Turbo Hydramatic also available with this engine and a mandatory option with each of the optional engines.

Mechanically, the most significant change was that variable-ratio power steering became standard equipment for the first time.

Interior trim was relatively unchanged from 1971 other than the availability of all-vinyl upholstery with the standard bench seat and the optional Strato bucket seats. Cloth interiors were available with the bench or bucket seats. The 1972 model year&#x27;s production increased to 180,819 to set a new record in the final year for the first-generation A-body. Monte Carlo and other Chevrolet models were promoted as part of a new ad campaign. The cars in print and broadcast ads were pictured at domestic tourist attractions and sites with the tagline &quot;Chevrolet: Building a Better Way To See The USA.&quot;

==Second generation (1973–1977)==
===1973===
A redesigned Monte Carlo was introduced alongside other GM intermediates. Like other GM mid-size cars, the 1973 Monte Carlo was no longer a hardtop, but a pillared &quot;Colonnade&quot; coupe with rear side opera windows and frameless door glass. Prominent styling included an egg-crate grille, a Monte Carlo emblem, and vertical taillights above the bumper. The front bumper was a large federally mandated bumper that was among the required 1973 federal safety standards for all passenger cars sold in the U.S. with the requirement extended to rear bumpers on 1974 models. Also new was a double-shell roof for improved noise reduction and rollover protection, along with the flush-mounted pull-up exterior door handles first introduced on the 1970½ Camaro and 1971 full-sized Chevrolets and Vegas.
The separate body-on-frame construction carried over for 1973, along with the basic all-coil suspension. The standard Monte Carlo with manual transmission retained &quot;traditional&quot; steering and bias-ply tires, but the radial-tuned system was included when the automatic transmission was ordered, earning the Monte Carlo S label. Optional were radial-ply tires, &quot;Pliacell&quot; shock absorbers (internal plastic membranes that separate the hydraulic fluid from the gas), high-caster steering, and front and rear anti-roll bars (previously offered only with the SS package). 

A new model for 1973 was the Monte Carlo Landau, an &quot;S&quot; with a rear quarter Landau vinyl roof, Turbine II wheels, and driver and passenger-side sports mirrors. The interior of the 1973 Monte Carlo featured an all-new, wraparound cockpit-style instrument panel, similar to that found in some contemporary Pontiacs, Oldsmobiles, and Buicks, in which gauges and various instruments were centered within easy reach of the driver. The simulated burl elm trim was retained. A split bench seat was standard, but &quot;Strato Bucket&quot; seats of a new design were optional, along with a floor console featuring an equally new shifter with knob and button similar to Pontiac&#x27;s Rally Sports Shifter replacing the Buick-like horseshoe shifter of previous years, and storage compartment. The bucket seats were of a one-piece high-back design with built-in headrests and could swivel almost 90 degrees to permit the driver and front passenger easier entry and exit, a feature previously offered on the 1962 Chrysler 300H. Cloth and vinyl trims were offered for bench and bucket seats.

The standard engine was a &quot;Turbo-Fire&quot; V8. Optional engines included a with a four-barrel carburetor and a four-barrel carbureted &quot;Turbo-Jet&quot; V8 rated at .

The 1973 Monte Carlo was named &quot;Car of the Year&quot; by &quot;Motor Trend&quot; based on its new styling and emphasis on Euro-style ride and handling. The 1973 Monte Carlo set a new sales record for Chevrolet, with nearly 250,000 sold for the model year. The success of the Monte Carlo and Pontiac&#x27;s similar Grand Prix led to several new personal luxury cars from competitors, including a revised Mercury Cougar, the Ford Gran Torino Elite, the Chrysler Cordoba, and restyled Dodge Charger as well as high-line versions of the AMC Matador that introduced a new coupe design for 1974.

===1974===
The 1974 Monte Carlo received minor detail changes from its 1973 predecessor, most notably a revised egg-crate grille in the front, flush mount taillight, a relocated license plate and trunk lock mechanism. In 1973, the trunk lock was below the trunk deck and above the rear bumper in a space that no longer existed in the 1974 versions. A larger rear bumper was added. The driver and passenger door map pockets were no longer available.

The base Monte Carlo with a manual transmission, standard suspension, and bias-ply tires was discontinued, leaving only the &quot;S&quot; and &quot;Landau&quot; models equipped with radial-ply tires, upgraded suspensions, and standard power steering and front disc brakes.

A three-speed manual transmission was listed as standard equipment on 1974 &quot;S&quot; and &quot;Landau&quot; models equipped with the standard and an automatic transmission was a required option with the larger 400 and 454 CID V8s. However, some sources indicate that Chevrolet built almost all 1974 Monte Carlos with the Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission.

The standard &quot;Turbo-Fire&quot; V8 was again rated at with a two-barrel carburetor in 49 states. For Californians, the standard engine was a 350 &quot;Turbo-Fire&quot; V8 with a four-barrel carburetor rated at that was not offered in the other 49 states. Reappearing on the options list for the first time since 1970 was a &quot;Turbo-Fire&quot; small block V8 rated at with a two-barrel carburetor (not offered in California) or with a four-barrel carburetor. The top engine was again the &quot;Turbo-Jet&quot; big block V8 rated at .

Despite the Arab Oil Embargo of late 1973 and early 1974 that significantly cut into sales of standard and intermediate-sized cars in favor of smaller compacts and imported subcompacts, the Monte Carlo went the other way on the sales charts by setting a new sales record this year of over 300,000 units despite the long lines at gas stations and record-high gasoline prices. The Monte Carlo continued to lead in intermediate personal luxury car sales, with the Grand Prix placing second and the arrival of new competitors this year, including an upsized Mercury Cougar, Ford Gran Torino Elite, and AMC&#x27;s Matador coupe. Chrysler would introduce its entries in this field for 1975, including the Chrysler Cordoba and redesigned Dodge Charger.

Interior Dimensions
===1975===
The 1975 Monte Carlo received only minor styling changes from the 1974 model, including a new grille with the Monte Carlo emblem moved to the center section and new vertically shaped taillights with horizontal louvers. All models received catalytic converters to meet Federal and California emission requirements, including bonuses such as improved fuel economy and drivability, extended spark plug and muffler life, but required lower-octane unleaded gasoline.

Engines were a carryover from 1974, except for the addition of GM&#x27;s High Energy electronic ignition, which was made standard equipment. Power ratings for all engines were decreased due to the addition of the catalytic converter. The V8 was no longer offered on California cars, leaving the four-barrel the top engine in that market. The base two-barrel was rated at (standard in 49 states), the 350 CID 4-barrel was rated at (available only in California), the 400 CID 4-barrel , and the 454 CID 4-barrel (now equipped with single exhaust with dual exhaust as an option). A three-speed manual transmission was standard equipment with the base 350 CID V8 used in 49 states and California-only 350 four-barrel V8. The Turbo Hydra-Matic was optional and a required option for the 400 and 454 V8s. Company sources claim that all 1975 Monte Carlos were equipped with the Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission, which became standard equipment for 1976.

New for 1975 was a Custom interior option that included a plusher cloth 50/50 bench seat with recliner on the passenger side and lower door panel carpeting. The standard interior consisted of a bench seat with knit-cloth and vinyl or all-vinyl upholstery. The swiveling Strato bucket seats with a center console and floor shifter were still optional, along with a knit cloth or vinyl upholstery. Also, white all-vinyl interiors were available for the first time this year, with either bench or bucket seats and contrasting colors for carpeting and instrument panels, including black, red, blue, and green. A gauge that showed if one was using too much gas, a part of the &quot;Economider&quot; Gauge package, became optional.

Sales dropped from 1974&#x27;s record-setting pace due to higher list prices, a domestic economy with double-digit inflation, and new competition from Chrysler&#x27;s Cordoba and Dodge&#x27;s Charger SE. Monte Carlo production ended up at around 250,000 units.

===1976===
A new crosshatch grille, vertically mounted rectangular headlamps, and reshaped taillights identified the 1976 Monte Carlo (the reshaped taillight pattern was later incorporated into the fourth-generation Monte Carlo). Under the hood, a new 2-barrel V8 became the standard engine with the 2-barrel and V8s optional. California cars included a 4-barrel as the base engine (not available in 49 states), and could be equipped with the 4-barrel V8. The big-block V8 was discontinued. The Turbo Hydramatic transmission became standard equipment on all 1976 Monte Carlos.

Interior trims remained the same as in 1975, with both base and custom levels, but the instrument panel and steering wheel featured a new rosewood trim that replaced the burled elm of previous years. A new option was a two-toned &quot;Fashion Tone&quot; paint combination. Monte Carlo sales hit a record total with 353,272 units this year. Of these, 191,370 were &quot;S&quot; Coupes and 161,902 Landau Coupes, which was an extra $293.

===1977===
A revised grille with smaller segments with the Monte Carlo &quot;knight&#x27;s crest&quot; emblem moved to a stand-up hood ornament and revised taillight lenses marked the 1977 Monte Carlo, which was the last year for the 1973-vintage design before the introduction of a downsized 1978 Monte Carlo. Engine offerings were reduced to two engines for 1977. The base engine for 49 states was the 2-barrel V8 and the 4-barrel V8 was optional (standard in California). The 400-cubic-inch V8 was dropped as an engine option. The only transmission was the Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission.

Interior trim received only minor revisions this year with upholstery choices, including cloth, velour, and vinyl in base and Custom trims. Swivel-out front seats and an 8-track tape player were optional. This model year marks the only time in history when an intermediate model was bigger in every dimension than Chevrolet&#x27;s full-sized models. The B-body Chevrolet Caprice/Impala had been redesigned and downsized for 1977. The Monte Carlo also weighed more. In 1977, sales totaled 224,327 S coupes and 186,711 Landau coupes.

==Third generation (1978–1980)==
=== 1978 ===

All GM intermediate-sized cars, including the Monte Carlo, were downsized for the 1978 model year in response to the 1973 Arab Oil Embargo and CAFE requirements. The 1978 model was 700-800 lb lighter and 15 inches shorter than the 1977 model. The 1978 model also had more interior and trunk space than the 1977 model. The engines offered in previous years were dropped in favor of a standard V6 built by Buick or an optional Chevrolet V8. New one-piece wall-to-wall carpeting was standard. The three-speed manual transmission reappeared as standard equipment on the base model with the V6 engine with the automatic optional. The optional V8 and all Landau models came standard with the automatic. A four-speed manual transmission with floor shifter was optional with the V8, the first time a four-speed manual was offered on the Monte Carlo since 1971.

=== 1979 ===

Minor trim changes were made to the 1979 Monte Carlo, including a restyled grille, revised parking lamp detail, and new wrap-around taillamps. Mechanical changes included a new Chevrolet-built  V6 as the standard engine for the base Monte Carlo in 49 states while the Buick V6 remained standard on base models in California and all Landau models. A new V8 became optional and the V8 continued as an option but was joined by a 160 hp version with a four-barrel carburetor. The same transmissions were carried over from 1978, including a standard three-speed manual, an optional four-speed manual, or an optional three-speed Turbo Hydramatic automatic. This was the last year that Chevrolet offered manual transmissions on the Monte Carlo due to low buyer interest.

=== 1980 ===

For 1980, the car received a mild frontal restyle, with quad headlights and turn indicators mounted beneath. The metric 200 three-speed automatic transmission became standard on all models and a new Chevrolet-built  V6 with 2-barrel Rochester carburetor replaced both the V6 of 1979 and the Buick engine offered on all 1978 models and the 1979 Landau as the standard engine in 49 states (California cars continued to use the Buick engine). A new option for 1980 was Buick&#x27;s turbocharged version of the V6 rated at . Other optional engines included versions of the Chevrolet small-block V8 with up to . The front headroom was 37.6 inches, while the rear was 37.8 inches. A power trunk opener was still optional. There were 13,839 turbo Monte Carlos built in 1980. A new five-slot, 14-inch rally wheel option was introduced (the slots having squared ends and a pointed edge), this was later shared with subsequent Chevrolet/GMC A/G-bodies and the Chevrolet S10 light-duty truck.
Production Figures:


==Fourth generation (1981–1988)==
=== 1981 ===
The body was restyled with the other GM mid-size formal coupes (Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme, Pontiac Grand Prix, Buick Regal). It featured a smoother profile than the previous models and new vertical taillights similar to the 1973 through 1977 models. Engine offerings were carried over, including the standard  Chevrolet V6 ( Buick V6 in California) an optional V8 (not available in California), a V8 in the base and Landau models, and a turbocharged Buick V6 in the Monte Carlo Turbo. 

There were a total of 3,027 Monte Carlo Turbos for 1981. The Monte Carlo Turbo appeared slightly different from other Monte Carlos that year because, in addition to the turbo, it also was equipped with a small hood scoop on the left side of the hood. It also had &quot;Turbo 3.8&quot; badges with a Chevrolet bowtie on the sides of the hood scoop, the trunk lid, and the right side of the dash. Standard equipment included automatic transmission, power steering, and front disc brakes. 

While some considered this car much better looking (and appeared more aerodynamic) than its Buick Regal, Pontiac Grand Prix, and Olds Cutlass cousins, only one team attempted to use the Monte Carlo in NASCAR cup racing. While the big Monte Carlo was the dominant body style in the late 1970s, winning many races, the downsized 1981 body would only take two checkered flags during the 1981 and 1982 seasons.

=== 1982 ===
Few revisions were made on the 1982 Monte Carlo. All engines, except for the turbocharged V6, which was discontinued along with the Monte Carlo Turbo model, were carried over from 1981. New for 1982 were a V6 and an Oldsmobile V8, both of which were diesel engines. With the introduction of GM&#x27;s new mid-size platform that saw the introduction of the Buick Century, Chevrolet Celebrity, Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera, and Pontiac 6000, the chassis designations were changed. The new mid-size cars were designated as A-body cars, whereas the cars previously designated as A-bodies were now called G-bodies. A black exterior was not offered in 1982 and also not available in 1982 for the first time in Monte Carlo history was a sportier interior option with Strato bucket seats and console, as only the standard notchback bench or optional 55/45 bench were offered this year. Weight distribution was 57% in the front and 43% in the rear.

=== 1983 ===
Receiving only minor updates, the 1983 model year Monte Carlo gained a revised grille and interior trim patterns. The standard engine continued to be the V6, and the V8 was optional. The Monte Carlo SS was reintroduced in 1983 with the HO being standard, following twelve years of being discontinued. The Monte Carlo SS featured European body color-coding, a new front fascia, a rear spoiler, a performance axle ratio, the F41 suspension package, model-specific wheels and tires, as well as interior upgrades.

=== 1984 ===

The 1984 year model coupe production totaled 112,730 with an additional 24,050 had the SS option (with a 305 V8 that saw a boost from the previous year). The Monte Carlo SS was available with Strato bucket seats and floor console as extra-cost options for the first time in place of the standard split bench seat with armrest (the Strato buckets also returned as an option on the regular Monte after a two-year absence along with the T-top option.). The regular Monte Carlo came standard with a V6 ( V6 for California) and a V8 was optional. The diesel engine was available for the last year in a base Monte Carlo and were only 168 manufactured. 

All engines for 1984 included the three-speed automatic transmission except for three SSs at the end of the 1984 production run that received the Turbo Hydramatic 200-4R transmission with overdrive. In 1984, a limited number of Monte Carlo SSs were made in Mexico for Mexican sale. The differences are many compared to US/Canadian SSs. There was no rear spoiler. The wheels were 14-inch checker style, an option on the base Monte Carlos in the US. The side mirrors are in a different style and painted black. The interior is from the Grand Prix and is only in blue. The engine was a V8, and the transmission was a 4-speed manual with a Hurst shifter.

=== 1985 ===
For 1985, additional SS colors (black, maroon, and silver in addition to white), pinstriping, and options were made available. The (later to be highly sought after) medium blue (&quot;gunmetal&quot;) color for the SS was dropped. A four-speed automatic overdrive transmission, the Turbo Hydramatic 200-4R, with a revised sport rear axle ratio with a 3.73:1 gear, became standard on the SS. Discontinued were the V6 and V8 diesel engines. Introduced in place of the 229 V6 was a  V6 (RPO LB4) that was fuel-injected with throttle-body fuel injection. The small block V8s included computer-controlled 2-barrel Quadrajet carburetors with an automatic choke to improve starting. 

The 1985 Chevrolet Monte Carlo was no longer available with a diesel engine. The base model&#x27;s previously standard 3.8 L Chevy V6 was changed to a 4.3 L V6 with throttle-body fuel injection. This increased output to 130. The optional 5.0 L V8 gained horsepower via an increased compression ratio. Horsepower rating went from 150 to 165. The High Output 5.0 L V8 in the 1985 Chevrolet Monte Carlo SS remained at 180 horsepower. 10.5-inch front disc brakes were standard, with drum brakes on the rear. A/C was $730. The V6 and base V8 were available with either a three- or four-speed automatic transmission, but the H.O. V8 in the SS came only with a four-speed automatic this year. The base coupe was visually unchanged except for pin-striping, optional T-tops, or a vinyl-covered roof. The SS version was modified. Previously offered only in white or dark blue metallic, color choices were expanded to include silver, maroon, and black. &quot;Removable glass roof panels&quot; (T-tops) came on board as a midyear option. Nearly 120,000 Monte Carlos were sold in 1985. Though the total was down from 1984, the SS model saw sales climb from 24,050 to 35,484. The 1985 Monte Carlo SS also came with a 35-millimeter sway bar.

=== 1986 ===
For 1986, there were four distinct body styles available. The base model Sport Coupe was still available with the same general body panels that it had since 1981, but featured new &quot;aero&quot; side mirrors similar to those on Camaros and Chevrolet Corvette of the 1980s. New for the 1986 model year was a Luxury Sport model with a revised front fascia, new &quot;aero&quot; side mirrors, and an updated sleek-looking rear fascia. The LS front fascia included &quot;Euro&quot; headlights with removable bulbs in a glass composite headlamp housing, versus the smaller sealed beam glass headlights of previous years. The rear bumper of the LS no longer had a &quot;notch&quot; between the bumper and trunk, and the taillights wrapped around so that they were visible from the sides of the car. The 1986 Super Sport model incorporated &quot;aero&quot; mirrors yet utilized the previous year&#x27;s styling for the rear bumper. 

New for 1986 was the Aerocoupe model. Modifications to the Super Sport body included a more deeply sloped rear window and a shorter trunk lid with a lower spoiler than the previous Super Sports version. A total of 200 Aerocoupes were sold, which was the number NASCAR required for road model features to be incorporated into the racing cars. All 200 were built in Arlington, Texas, finished in white with burgundy interior and sent to Cars &amp; Concepts in Michigan for the conversion.

=== 1987 ===

In 1987, Chevrolet eliminated the Sport Coupe version of the Monte Carlo, leaving the LS, SS, and Aerocoupe. The Super Sport incorporated the &quot;smoothed&quot; rear bumper and tail lamps first introduced on the 1986 Luxury Sport; the &quot;lay-down&quot; spoiler was introduced midway through the production year. The Aerocoupe made up 6,052 of the 39,251 Super Sports produced that year. A total of 39,794 Luxury Sports were produced in 1987.

=== 1988 ===
The Monte Carlo returned for a shortened 1988 model year, largely carryover from 1987. The Monte Carlo SS now only offered a lay-down style spoiler (dropping the stand-up spoiler), with the LS seeing no visible changes. 

The Aerocoupe did not return, as Chevrolet had unveiled its intention to enter the Chevrolet Lumina coupe into NASCAR racing for 1989 – before the production vehicle was released to dealers as an early 1990 model. The design was more aerodynamic compared to the Monte Carlo SS. 

The final G-platform Monte Carlo – a silver SS — was produced by Arlington Assembly on December 12, 1987; production in the shortened model year fell to 30,174 units (16,204 Monte Carlo SS).

Production Figures:

==Fifth generation (1995–1999)==


The two-door Lumina was renamed as Monte Carlo for the 1995 model year. Deriving its design from a namesake 1992 concept car, the fifth-generation Monte Carlo was again a counterpart of the Buick Regal, Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme, and Pontiac Grand Prix coupes (and sedans). Shifting to the GM W-body chassis meant the Monte Carlo became front-wheel drive for the first time and no V8 engine was available. The Monte Carlo was assembled alongside the Lumina in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada. 

In its revival, the Monte Carlo was exclusively a coupe (in contrast to its divisional counterparts). Alongside the second-generation Lumina, the Monte Carlo was fitted with dual airbags and ABS (adding daytime running lights in 1997). 

The Monte Carlo shared its trim with the second-generation Lumina, including a base LS and a sport-oriented Z34. The two versions were externally similar, with the Z34 featuring red-colored badging, a lower front air dam, and blacked-out trim (instead of chrome). Z34s were equipped with 16-inch 5-spoke alloy wheels, which were an option for the LS (in place of 15-inch wheelcovers). For 1998, the Z34 received redesigned alloy wheels, with the previous style remaining optional on the LS. 

The LS was powered by a 160hp 3.1L V6; the Z34 used a 215hp 3.4L V6; for 1998, the Z34 received a 200hp 3.8L V6 (increasing torque output). All three V6 engines were paired to a 4-speed automatic transmission. 

In LS trim, the fifth-generation Monte Carlo was the final mass-produced six-passenger, two-door sedan offered for sale. As with nearly all coupes (and many four-doors), the Z34 was offered with bucket seats and a floor-mounted shifter. 

=== Special editions ===
A run of four hundred 1995 Z34s were made called the &quot;Monte Carlo Brickyard 400 Pace Car&quot;. The $2195 option included interior ornamentation, embroidered leather 45/55 seating with a full floor console, an aero wing spoiler, and an accent stripe package.

For 1997, Chevrolet made a limited production run of Monte Carlo Brickyard 400 pace cars, though none were available for consumers.

===Models===


==Sixth generation (2000–2007)==
===2000–2005===
For 2000, Chevrolet not only again called upon GM Motorsports for design inspiration. The Super Sport moniker returned, replacing the Z34 designation of the fifth generation, which was a Lumina Coupe. Chevrolet also retired the Lumina name, bringing back the Impala nameplate for the Monte Carlo&#x27;s sedan counterpart. At the request of racing teams, Chevrolet stylists added a slight &quot;hump&quot; on the rear trunk. From the NASCAR circuit came the aerodynamic styling and ducktail spoiler. The 6th generation Monte Carlo is based on the Monte Carlo &quot;Intimidator&quot; concept car, presented in 1997. Trim levels initially were the LS and SS, the latter being the first front-drive SS in the Chevrolet lineup. The LS used a 3.4 L OHV V6, while the SS used the 3.8 L V6. A Supercharged &quot;SS&quot; model was added for 2004 and 2005; the naturally aspirated &quot;SS&quot; continued as well, but was relabeled as &quot;LT&quot; for MY 2005.
===2006–2007===

The facelifted 2006 Monte Carlo and the companion Impala sedan were introduced at the 2005 Los Angeles Auto Show. The base engine was a 3.5 L V6 producing 211 hp (156 kW). Trim series for this generation include the entry-level LS, the mid-level LT, the upper-level LTZ and, the top-of-the-line SS. Only 14,829 SS models were produced over the two years, 8,794 in 2006 and 6,035 in 2007. The &quot;SS&quot; models used the generation IV small-block V8 — the first V8 since 1988. The 5.3 L V8 produced 303 hp (226 kW). The interior for 2006 was mildly redesigned.

The revised model also added an improved interior with expanded Driver Information Center (DIC), enhanced ABS and traction control, as well as optional, seat-mounted side airbags for the front driver and passenger.

The LT and LTZ models were available with the 3.9 L engine in 2006. For 2007 the LTZ model was dropped along with the engine in favor of the Flex Fuel 3.5 L as the exclusive engine for non-SS models.

===Specialty nameplates===
Chevrolet released several models inspired by contemporary NASCAR drivers:
The first model released was the 2002 Dale Earnhardt Signature Edition, also called Intimidator Edition. This car had two color schemes: a black body with galaxy silver rocker panels, front and rear air dams, and an all-black body with black ground effects. A thin red stripe above the silver ground effects was also included. Just behind the rear side windows, the Dale Number 3 logo was placed with Earnhardt&#x27;s signature below the Number 3 logo. The car also featured silver &quot;Intimidator&quot; SS badges on the right side of the trunk, and standard Monte Carlo SS badges on the bottom of the vehicle, just in front of the rear tires. An Intimidator badge with the number 3 also appeared on the dash, and Earnhardt&#x27;s signature appeared on the gauge cluster. The interior is all black (&quot;charcoal&quot;) leather. This edition also came with 5-spoke, diamond-cut wheels and received a GM L36 3800 V6 engine.

In 2003, the Jeff Gordon edition was released. The vehicle came with a superior blue body and silver ground effects, just like the Intimidator Edition; however, the Jeff Gordon edition also received lighter blue ghost flames on the body. It featured the number 24 behind the rear side windows. A Jeff Gordon signature was placed on the right side of the trunk, and inside the car received a Jeff Gordon badge on the dashboard and a two-tone gray and black leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob. It featured 5-spoke, diamond-cut wheels and a GM L36 3800 V6 engine.

In 2004, the Dale Jr. Edition came out; it was red with a black high sport kit. The number 8, with an &quot;E&quot; stripe design went from the doors to the rear bumper. The 5-spoke diamond cut wheels featured a black stripe through each spoke, and Dale Jr.&#x27;s signature appeared on the right side of the trunk lid. On the sides, the vehicle received Supercharged SS badges. Inside, a #8 badge appeared on the dash, and Dale Jr.&#x27;s signature was on the cluster. This edition also featured the #8 on floor mats and headrests. This was also the first nameplate car to receive a GM L67 Supercharged 3800 V6 engine. The fan speed for heat and air conditioning was changed from the previous year&#x27;s five settings to 10.

The Intimidator Edition was re-released in 2004. However, the vehicle featured &quot;Intimidator&quot; badges on the trunk lid and both side panels. The car was all black, received the five-spoke, diamond cut wheels, and included the GM L67 Supercharged 3800 V6 engine.

The 2005 featured the final commemorative edition, the Tony Stewart version. It was all black but featured a white/orange line that thickened as it reached the back of the vehicle and contained the number 20 just before the rear tires. Tony Stewart&#x27;s signature also appeared behind the rear windows on both sides. The Chevy bowtie on the trunk was white in this edition, and another was painted on the front of the hood. The Monte Carlo badge was removed and replaced with the black Tony Stewart grille. The wheels were the same design as the Dale Jr. Edition, except the bowtie on the center cap was white this time. This edition also received a GM L67 Supercharged 3800 V6 engine.

===Production totals===

Production of the 2006–2007 SS totaled 14,829 units.

==Discontinuation==
The Monte Carlo ceased production at Oshawa Car Assembly Plant #1 following an announcement in February 2007 of its demise. On June 19, 2007, the last two 2007 Chevrolet Monte Carlo models rolled off the line at the Oshawa Assembly Plant. The last two models were identical &quot;SS&quot; models with Precision Red exterior paint, silver rally stripes, and Ebony Nuance leather interior. The vehicle was discontinued due to declining sales in coupes in general and the company&#x27;s plans to revive the Chevrolet Camaro, which would cannibalize sales of the Monte Carlo.

General Motors retained the final Monte Carlo off the production line for the Heritage Center collection. The second-to-last Monte off the line was auctioned on August 15, at Manheim&#x27;s Statesville Auto Auction in Statesville, North Carolina. The winning bid went to Fred Simon, owner of Simon Chevrolet in Woonsocket, RI, where it is displayed at the dealership. This car was at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway over the weekend of July 27–29 for the 2007 Allstate 400 at the Brickyard. While there, it was signed by all the current Team Chevrolet drivers who were active in the NASCAR Nextel Cup Series.

==NASCAR==

From 1971 until the car&#x27;s end of production in 1988, the Monte Carlo campaigned in NASCAR racing. The 1973–1977 cars were the dominant body style through the years until 1980, when NASCAR mandated a move to the shorter wheelbase cars being built by Detroit. The 1981 and 1982 (referred to as the &quot;flat-nose&quot;) Monte Carlo was raced by few teams and only won two races in those years. In 1983, the addition of the &quot;SS&quot; nose became the Monte Carlo body style used in NASCAR until the car went out of production.

The Monte Carlo returned for the 1995 season with the fifth-generation body, but NASCAR allowed the car to have wider rear quarter panels, and this deviated from &quot;factory&quot; sheet metal, which the race-spec cars had to use until that time. The 1995 body style was also a favorite on the NASCAR circuit and enjoyed considerable success at the track. The car captured several NASCAR Manufacturers Cup awards until it again was discontinued from production in 2007, and replaced by the Impala for racing.

<text>Carro Armato (armored vehicle) was the Italian Army&#x27;s designation for tanks from 1938. This would be followed by a letter and a series of numbers. The letter would be either L, M or P meaning light, medium, and heavy tank respectively. The official Italian military tank classification differed from contemporary classifications in other countries. The numbers would follow the pattern of X/Y where X would be the weight in tonnes and Y the year of adoption (i.e. the L6/40 weighs 6 tonnes and was adopted in the year 1940). The following are some Carro Armatos that entered service:
* Carro Armato L5/21: Fiat L5/21 light tank
* Carro Armato L5/30: Fiat L5/30 light tank
* Carro Armato L6/40: Fiat L6/40 light tank
* Carro Armato M11/39: Fiat M11/39 medium tank
* Carro Armato M13/40: Fiat M13/40 medium tank
* Carro Armato M14/41: Fiat M14/41 medium tank
* Carro Armato M15/42: Fiat M15/42 medium tank
* Carro Armato P40: Fiat P26/40 heavy tank

NOTE: The L3/33 and the L3/35 tankettes were designated &quot;Fast Tank&quot; (&quot;Carro Veloce&quot;) and were initially known as the CV-33 and the CV-35.

<doc id="1172795" wikidata="Q979015" url="?curid=1172795" title="The Way of All Flesh (1927 film)">
<text>The Way of All Flesh is a 1927 American silent drama film directed by Victor Fleming, written by Lajos Bíró, Jules Furthman, and Julian Johnson from a story by Perley Poore Sheehan. Star Emil Jannings won the first Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role at the 1929 ceremony for his performances in this film and &quot;The Last Command,&quot; the only year that multiple roles were considered.

It is now considered a lost film with only two fragments of the film having been found.

==Plot==
In the story, which opens in the early 1900s, Jannings plays August Schiller, a bank clerk in Milwaukee who is happy with both his job and his family. But when bank officials ask him to transport $1,000 in securities to Chicago, he meets a blond seductress on the train, who sees what he is carrying. She flirts with him, convinces him to buy her a bottle of champagne, and takes him to a saloon run by a crook. The next morning he awakes alone in a dilapidated bedroom, without the securities. He finds the woman, and at first pleads with her, then intimidates her to return the stolen securities. He is knocked unconscious by the saloon owner and dragged to a nearby railroad track.

As the crook strips him of everything that might lead to his identification, Schiller recovers consciousness, and in a struggle the crook is thrown into the path of an oncoming train and killed. Schiller flees, and in despair is about to take his own life, when he sees in a newspaper that he is supposedly dead, the crook&#x27;s mangled body having been identified as Schiller&#x27;s. The time passes to twenty years later. Schiller is aged and unkempt, employed to pick up trash in a park. He sees his own family go to a cemetery and place a wreath on his grave. Following other scenes in a Christmas snowstorm, Schiller makes his way to his former home, where he sees that the son whom he had taught to play violin is now a successful musician. He walks away, carrying in his pocket a dollar that his son has given him, not recognizing that the old tramp is his father.

The film is unrelated to Samuel Butler&#x27;s novel &quot;The Way of All Flesh&quot;.

==Cast==
*Emil Jannings as August Schiller
*Belle Bennett as Mrs. Schiller
*Phyllis Haver as The Temptress
*Donald Keith as August Schiller, junior
*Fred Kohler as The Tough
*Philippe De Lacy as August Schiller, jr., as a child
*Mickey McBan as Evald
*Betsy Ann Hisle as Charlotte
*Carmencita Johnson as Elizabeth
*Gordon Thorpe as Karl
*Jackie Combs as Heinrich
*Dean Harrell as Evald
*Anne Sheridan
*Nancy Drexel
*Philip Sleeman (uncredited)

==Production==
The film is a melodrama starring Emil Jannings, Belle Bennett, and Phyllis Haver. Jannings won the first Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance in this film and his performance in &quot;The Last Command&quot; (the only year that acting Oscars were awarded for multiple performances).

==Preservation status==
Only two fragments survive, both from the ending, making Jannings&#x27; the only Academy Award-winning performance with no known complete copy of the film preserved. This is one of Victor Fleming&#x27;s many lost silent films of the 1920s.

==Disputed provenance==
In her 1999 autobiography, Frederica Maas claimed that the idea for the movie had been stolen from her and her husband Ernest Maas. She said the story was based on the life of her husband&#x27;s father, who similarly had abandoned his family after making horrible mistakes in his personal life. They named the script &quot;Beefsteak Joe&quot; and presented it to Emil Jannings. As a fellow German-American, Ernest had thought Jannings would help them get the script made into a movie. Instead they were shocked to learn that it had been stolen and produced without any credit or remuneration. The fact that it became an award-winning film only aggravated the situation.

==Remake==
The movie was remade in 1940 by Paramount Pictures and starred Akim Tamiroff, Gladys George, and William Henry.

<doc id="1172797" wikidata="Q222686" url="?curid=1172797" title="Brno Circuit">
<text>The Masaryk circuit () or Masarykring, also referred to as the Brno Circuit, refers to two motorsport race tracks located in Brno, Czech Republic.
The original street circuit was made up of public roads, and at its longest measured . The track is named after the first president of Czechoslovakia, Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk. In 1949, events such as the Czechoslovakian Grand Prix attracted top teams and drivers. In 1987, the new (current) circuit was opened. The Brno Circuit is historically one of the oldest circuits, on the place were also held the most motorcycle championships in history after the TT Circuit Assen.

==Original circuits==
The original layout ran anti-clockwise on approximately of public roads in the outskirts of Brno, where the start/finish was located in Bosonohy. The circuit went east past Kamenny and then went north past the Bohunice University Campus in Kejbaly, and went through the villages of Libusino, Kohouvotice and Žebětín, out to Ostrovacice, through Veselka and back through a series of fast straights and kinks. From 1930 to 1937, the Masaryk circuit races attracted some of the top drivers and teams.

On September 25, 1949, the race was held for the first and the last time in Czechoslovakia as part of the Grand Prix motor racing (later evolved into Formula One). The Czechoslovakian Grand Prix in 1949 was run clockwise on a shorter layout, which turned right at Veselka, bypassed Ostrovacice and entered Žebětín from the south rather than the west. In spite of a crowd in excess of 400,000 people, this would be the last Grand Prix for cars on the old circuit.

Beginning in 1950, the circuit played host to the Czechoslovakian motorcycle Grand Prix, which became a world championship event from 1965. The circuit had been again reduced in length to in 1964, completely bypassing Žebětín and using a new through-road that went to Kohoutovice quicker. The European Touring Car series visited in the 1980s, by which time the circuit had been finally reduced to in 1975, which exited Kohoutovice from the south and bypassed Libusino and Kejbaly and went right through Kamenny and rejoined the main road back to Bosonohy.

==Modern circuit==
The current permanent road racing circuit was opened on 18 July 1987. It lies north of Kyvalka, within the bounds of the circuit used in the 1930s, but not incorporating any of the public roads. The motorcycle race moved to the new circuit and regained its status as a round of the world championship. A World Sports Car Championship race was held in 1988, and a round of the A1 Grand Prix series in 2006. It was also the location of the 24H Epilog of Brno (previously 6 Hours of Brno).

The annual Motorcycle Grand Prix of the Czech Republic was the circuit&#x27;s most important event. It had been held here since 1950 and was the most famous motor race in the Czech Republic. The race was part of the World Grand Prix in the years of 1965–1982, 1987–1991, 1993–2020.

The FIA World Touring Car Championship, FIA GT1 World Championship, Formula Two and the Superbike World Championship also raced at the circuit.

The Czech Republic Motorcycle Grand Prix was more of a promoter event than a profit-raiser itself. Since tobacco advertising has been banned in 2007, it is common among the other MotoGP events. Since August 2023, the circuit is owned by the Czech company Shakai.

<doc id="1172802" wikidata="Q2853822" url="?curid=1172802" title="Sigmund (comics)">
<text>Doctor Sigmund is a Dutch gag-a-day comic strip, created by Peter de Wit. It centers around a short-sized psychiatrist who constantly fails to provide his patients with proper help.

==History==

&quot;Sigmund&quot; made his first appearance in an educational TV documentary series for Teleac about the art of drawing comics, presented by Dutch comics artists Hanco Kolk and Peter de Wit. The episode aired on Dutch television in 1992 and dealt with gag-a-day comics. De Wit explained he came up with an idea for a gag-a-day starring a dwarf-like, one-eyed psychiatrist whose cynical attitude towards his patient causes them to hate him. The series was originally called &quot;Mensch, durf te leeven&quot; (after a 1919 song of the same name), but was later changed to the character&#x27;s name &quot;Sigmund&quot;, a nod to Sigmund Freud. Only two years later did the comic strip actually get published. It runs in the Dutch newspaper &quot;De Volkskrant&quot; and has also been published in &quot;Het Parool&quot;, &quot;Het Laatste Nieuws&quot; and &quot;Gazet van Antwerpen&quot; In &quot;Het Laatste Nieuws&quot; it was published as &quot;Meneerke Psy&quot;, but only ran for three months because readers felt the strip was too cynical. As of 2015, 25 albums have been published, special editions not included.

==The comic==

Many gags feature black comedy, such as suicidal patients, serial killers or people with mental issues. Sigmund is the only recurring character, though sometimes cameo&#x27;s from Dutch celebrities, like Queen Maxíma can be seen.

==Spin-offs==

&quot;Sigmund&quot; also has a spin-off called &quot;Burka Babes&quot;, featuring women in burka discussing matters.

In 2011 De Wit made a special graphic novel about Sigmund called &quot;Het Lege Nest&quot; (&quot;The Empty Nest&quot;).

==Stage adaptation==

De Wit also adapted &quot;Sigmund&quot; into a theatrical sketch format. During the &quot;Cartoonference&quot; tour in December 2004 he, Hanco Kolk, and played stage shows based on the comic strip.

==Awards==

In 1995 De Wit received the VSV-Publieksprijs for the first &quot;Sigmund&quot; album. According to the author the comics are very popular with actual psychiatrists who put them on display in their waiting room for their clients to enjoy.

<doc id="1172809" wikidata="Q874188" url="?curid=1172809" title="Defrosting (refrigeration)">
<text>In refrigerators, defrosting (or thawing) is the removal of frost and ice.

A defrosting procedure is generally performed periodically on refrigerators and freezers to maintain their operating efficiency. Over time, as the door is opened and closed, letting in new air, water vapour from the air condenses on the cooling elements within the cabinet.

Types of frost (in various environments) include crystalline frost (hoar frost or radiation frost) from deposition of water vapor from air of low humidity, white frost in humid conditions, window frost on glass surfaces, advection frost from cold wind over cold surfaces, black frost without visible ice at low temperatures and very low humidity, and rime under supercooled wet conditions.

The resulting ice inhibits heat transfer out of the cabinet increasing running costs. Furthermore, as the ice builds up it takes increasing space from within the cabinet - reducing the space available for food storage.

Many newer units employ automatic defrosting (often called &quot;frost-free&quot; or &quot;no frost&quot;) and do not require manual defrosting in normal use. Although, in some cases, users of Frost Free fridge/freezers have noted ice blocking the vent that allows air into the refrigerator compartment.

<doc id="1172821" wikidata="Q58441" url="?curid=1172821" title="Robinho">
<text>Robson de Souza (; born 25 January 1984), known as Robinho (), is a Brazilian former professional footballer who played as a forward.

In 1997, at 12 years of age, Robinho was picked by Brazil legend Pelé as his heir apparent and, in 2002, went on to lead Santos to their first Campeonato Brasileiro title since Pelé himself played for the club. Afterwards he went on to win a second title with Santos, two more with Spanish club Real Madrid, and the Italian Serie A title in his first season at Milan. At international level, Robinho has won one Copa América title and two FIFA Confederations Cups with the Brazil national team, and played at two FIFA World Cups.

In 2017, an Italian court convicted Robinho of sexual assault in the 2013 gang rape of a woman at a Milan nightclub. This conviction was upheld by the Milan Court of Appeals, and subsequently upheld by Italy&#x27;s top court in January 2022. Italy&#x27;s request for extradition has been rejected by Brazil, because the Constitution of Brazil does not allow extradition of Brazilian nationals. In March 2024, Robinho began serving his nine-year prison term for the conviction in Brazil.

==Club career==
===Santos===
Robinho was born in São Vicente, São Paulo State. In his early years, Robinho played a lot of futsal which was responsible for developing his dribbling and acceleration skills. He signed his first professional contract with Santos in 2002 at the age of 18. He made 24 appearances in his debut season and scored one goal as Santos won the 2002 Campeonato Brasileiro. He reached the final of the 2003 Copa Libertadores with Santos, but lost in the final to Boca Juniors. In 2004, Robinho finished with 21 goals in 37 games and led Santos to win another Campeonato Brasileiro.

His form had brought him to the attention of many European clubs in the summer of 2004, but Robinho remained with Santos after the Brazilian club rejected all offers. His form suffered in the 2005 season, however, after his mother, Marina da Silva Souza, was kidnapped by gunmen at her Praia Grande home on 6 November; she was released unharmed six weeks later after a ransom was paid.

Robinho scored nine goals in 12 league games, and his value continued to increase as his talent became more and more apparent to the powers of European football. Santos began to realise it would become increasingly difficult to hold on to their star player. In July 2005, Spanish giants Real Madrid signed Robinho by agreeing to pay a fee equal to 60% of the buyout clause in his contract belonging to Santos (€24 million).

===Real Madrid===
Robinho was given the number 10 shirt for Real Madrid, previously worn by Luís Figo. Robinho made 37 appearances and scored 14 goals in his first season. At the start of the 2006–07 season, Robinho spent much of the first few months of the season selected as a substitute by manager Fabio Capello, even after being Man of the Match in the first &quot;Clásico&quot; against Barcelona that year. Only after the winter break did Robinho find himself in the starting XI, later playing a crucial role as Real Madrid won their 30th La Liga title that year. The title was the third league championship of his career.

Capello was subsequently fired, however, and Bernd Schuster was appointed as head coach of Real Madrid. Robinho finished with 11 league goals and eight assists for Madrid in the 2007–08 La Liga season, as well as four goals during Real Madrid&#x27;s Champions League campaign. Robinho then got injured at the beginning of the second half of the season. He did not recover fully enough to help Madrid against Roma in the Champions League. The week before, however, Robinho saved Real Madrid&#x27;s La Liga title hopes with a two-goal performance on 3 March 2008 as Madrid defeated Recreativo de Huelva away from home. That game kept a resurgent Barcelona at bay and ultimately secured Real Madrid&#x27;s 31st league title and Robinho&#x27;s fourth.

Robinho was Real Madrid&#x27;s third-highest scorer during his Madrid years, behind strikers Raúl and Ruud van Nistelrooy. He was also the player with the second-most assists, behind Guti, and the only Madrid player, along with goalkeeper Iker Casillas, to finish in the top ten of the Ballon d&#x27;Or and FIFA World Player of the Year nominations for 2007–08.

Real Madrid president Ramón Calderón had promised to negotiate a new contract with Robinho at the midpoint of the 2007–08 season, which never materialised. Calderón, however, insisted talks would occur in the summer; again Calderón went back on his word. Robinho subsequently revealed talks never began because Madrid hoped to use him as part of the deal to bring Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid in the summer of 2008. After the failed move for Ronaldo, Madrid finally attempted to negotiate a new contract with Robinho, which he rejected and led to him pursuing a transfer to Chelsea.

===Manchester City===
On 1 September 2008, the final day of the Premier League summer transfer window, Robinho completed a €41–42 million (£32.5M) move to Manchester City on a four-year deal. This occurred on the same day the club was bought out by the Arab investment company Abu Dhabi United Group.

Robinho had previously been linked with a transfer to Chelsea, and he had emphasised his desire to play for the London club up to the eve of the transfer. On 27 August, Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon said that the club were &quot;confident&quot; that the transaction would go through, and Madrid had also given their consent for the player to leave. Robinho&#x27;s expectancy to move to Chelsea was such that upon signing for Manchester City he accidentally stated, &quot;On the last day, Chelsea made a great proposal and I accepted.&quot; To this comment, a reporter then replied, &quot;You mean Manchester, right?&quot; &quot;Yeah, Manchester, sorry!&quot; answered Robinho.

In an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Robinho stated that Manchester City being a big club and the presence of Brazilian friends Jô and Elano were incentives for him to join the team. He made his team debut and scored his first Premier League goal on 13 September 2008, coincidentally in a 3–1 home defeat to Chelsea.
On 26 October, he scored his first Premier League hat-trick against Stoke City, and he scored his first European goal for Manchester City in a 3–2 UEFA Cup group stage win over Twente on 6 November. He was given the captain&#x27;s armband for the match against Hull City, due to Richard Dunne&#x27;s suspension, which ended in a 2–2 draw.

On 19 April, Robinho scored his 13th league goal for Manchester City in the 2–1 win away at Everton on 25 April, City&#x27;s first away win since 31 August 2008. The following week, he scored his third consecutive goal in three games, against Blackburn Rovers, to help Manchester City to a 3–1 win. Robinho finished the season as City&#x27;s top goalscorer with 14 and the fourth top scorer in the league.

His second season at Manchester City did not go as well. He missed three months of the season due to injury and only played 12 games in total (ten in the Premier League), and scored one goal (against lower league club Scunthorpe United in the FA Cup). Due to this, he fell down the pecking order and sought a move away from the club in the January transfer window.

====Return to Santos (loan)====
On 28 January 2010, Robinho returned to his home club Santos due to moving down the pecking order at Manchester City, joining them on a six-month loan deal. He had publicly stated that at Manchester City he would play every other game, and because of the upcoming World Cup, he wanted to play every game, and so returned to Brazil with Santos after declining a move to São Paulo. On his return to Santos, Robinho scored a backheel against aforementioned admirers São Paulo with five minutes to spare to complete a 2–1 victory for the &quot;Peixe&quot;. In the final match of his loan deal on 4 August, Robinho helped Santos win the Copa do Brasil. Although Santos lost 2–1 to Vitória, they won the tie 3–2 on aggregate to win the competition for the first time in their history. Shortly afterwards, Robinho stated that he wanted to remain with Santos rather than return to England. Manchester City, however, refused to extend the loan deal and Santos failed to make a transfer bid.

Robinho returned to training with Manchester City in August 2010, but stated that he was seeking a move away from the club before the end of the summer transfer window on 31 August. Turkish clubs Fenerbahçe and Beşiktaş opened transfer negotiations with City, but Robinho rejected a move to Turkey, declaring that he would rather move to a club in Spain or Italy.

===AC Milan===
====2010–11 season====
On 31 August 2010, Robinho moved to AC Milan from Manchester City for a fee of £15 million (€18M), signing a four-year contract. He made his debut as a substitute in a 2–0 defeat to newly promoted Cesena. He started his first game with Milan in their 1–0 win over Genoa. He scored his first goal in injury time against Chievo to make the score 3–1 on 16 October 2010. He continued his goalscoring form with a goal the following week in a Serie A match against Napoli on 25 October 2010. He then scored the first goal for Milan against Sampdoria, but Giampaolo Pazzini equalised on the hour mark to end as a draw.

On 4 December 2010, Robinho scored the second goal for Milan against Brescia in their 3–0 win at the San Siro. Eight days later, on 12 December, he again scored the second goal in a 3–0 victory for Milan against Bologna. He scored his first goal of 2011 against Bari to give Milan another 3–0 victory. On 29 January, he scored against Catania following a deflection from a Zlatan Ibrahimović free-kick to give Milan a 1–0 lead, then assisted Ibrahimović to give Milan a 2–0 win. On 12 February 2011, he scored his first brace for Milan against Parma to help Milan to a 4–0 win. Against Cagliari, Robinho scored a brace in the 37th week of Serie-A on 14 May 2011, leading to celebrations of the &quot;Scudetto&quot; winners after the match.

====2011–12 season====
He started the 2011–12 Serie A season well, taking part in Milan&#x27;s win over Inter Milan in the Supercoppa Italiana. Scoring 11 goals in all competitions, Robinho helped Milan to a second-place finish in the Serie A.

====2012–13 season====
After Alexandre Pato took the number 9 jersey at Milan following the departure of club legend Filippo Inzaghi, Robinho was handed the number 7 jersey that previously belonged to Pato. Robinho started in Milan&#x27;s first game of the 2012–13 Serie A against Sampdoria, but was replaced by Urby Emanuelson due to an injury. Robinho made his comeback as a substitute against Cagliari, where Milan won 2–0. Four days later, Milan drew against Parma in an away match where Robinho came on as a substitute. Robinho came on as a substitute again against Inter, but Milan eventually lost 1–0. Robinho was then injured in training and was sidelined for the next five games. He made his comeback against Málaga as a substitute in the 80th minute; the game ended as a draw. He scored his first goal of the season against Juventus, which was the winner in a 1–0 victory on 25 November 2012.

Robinho was close to signing with old club Santos in both January 2013 and July 2013, but the move fell through on both occasions due to the player&#x27;s wage demands. On both occasions, Santos managed to reach an agreement with Milan over the transfer fee.

On 18 July 2013, Robinho signed a new contract with Milan on a reduced wage, keeping him with the &quot;Rossoneri&quot; until 2016. His previous deal was set to expire on 30 June 2014.

====2013–14 season====
Robinho suffered a groin strain early in the pre-season against Valencia on 27 July 2013, which disrupted his preparation for the upcoming season. Before he suffered the injury in the match, he missed a penalty, but scored a goal from open play less than a minute later.

On 22 October, Robinho scored the opening goal in the 2013–14 Champions League match against Group H favourites Barcelona, from a pass by his compatriot Kaká. After Lionel Messi&#x27;s equaliser, however, he missed an excellent opportunity to score another goal in the second half, after which the match ended in a 1–1 draw. In November, he was sidelined again, this time due to a dislocated shoulder, an injury he picked up during the match against Celtic in the Champions League.

Robinho scored his only goal in Milan&#x27;s Coppa Italia campaign at the San Siro in the quarter-finals against Spezia on 15 January 2014. He opened the scoring with a close-range header in a 3–1 victory against the Serie B club. In February, an injury of his left thigh prevented him from playing in the first leg of the Champions League first knockout round against Atlético Madrid. He made a substitute appearance during the second leg in Spain, but was unable to prevent a 5–1 aggregate defeat against the &quot;Rojiblancos&quot;.

====Second return to Santos (loan)====
On 6 August 2014, Robinho arrived in São Paulo–Guarulhos International Airport and subsequently returned to Santos in a one-year loan deal. Despite being out of new coach Filippo Inzaghi&#x27;s plans, the Italian side still will pay Robinho&#x27;s wages—while &quot;Peixe&quot; pays R$600,000 per month, Milan will pay another R$400,000.

Robinho was presented on the following day, stating a desire to play in the following match against fierce rivals Corinthians. He made his re-debut for &quot;Peixe&quot; on 10 August, starting in a 0–1 eventual home loss.

Robinho scored his first goal after his return four days later, netting the first and assisting Rildo in a 2–0 home success over Londrina in the Copa do Brasil championship. His second goal came on the 29th, in a 2–0 away win over Grêmio in the same tournament.

On 13 September, Robinho scored his first Brasileirão goal, netting his side&#x27;s second in a 2–1 home win over Coritiba. He scored again on 21 September with a left-footed strike in a 3–1 victory over Figueirense. On 30 June 2015, after already rescinding his link with Milan in May, he left &quot;Peixe&quot; after his contract expired.

===Guangzhou Evergrande===
On 16 July 2015, Robinho signed a six-month contract with Chinese Super League side Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao, managed by compatriot Luiz Felipe Scolari and linking up with his international teammate Paulinho. On 23 July 2015, he made his unofficial debut for Guangzhou in an international friendly against Bayern Munich. He won the Chinese Super League in the 2015 season.

On 1 February 2016, Robinho became a free agent after his contract expired with Guangzhou.

===Atlético Mineiro===
On 11 February 2016, after 10 days being released Robinho signed a two-year contract with Atlético Mineiro.

Robinho was the highest goal scorer in Brazil in 2016, with 25 goals. He was selected for the Campeonato Brasileiro team of the year, in both the Craque do Brasileirão and the Bola de Prata awards.

Robinho scored a goal in the 2017 Campeonato Mineiro final over rivals Cruzeiro, which secured Atlético the title.

He left the club at the expiry of his contract in December 2017, having scored a total of 38 goals in 109 matches.

===Sivasspor and İstanbul Başakşehir===
On 23 January 2018, Robinho signed for Turkish Süper Lig club Sivasspor. On 1 January 2019, he signed for İstanbul Başakşehir in the same league for a fee of $2.78m. He was a member of the 2019–20 Süper Lig winning squad, the first top flight title in the club&#x27;s history.

===Third return to Santos===
On 10 October 2020, Robinho rejoined Santos on a deal running until February 2021, with the option for an extension until December 2022. The announcement was met with criticism due to Robinho&#x27;s trial court conviction of sexual assault in Italy. One of Santos&#x27; sponsors ended their deal with the club, stating that the signing was &#x27;disrespectful to women&#x27;, while others also pressed against it. On 16 October, Santos announced the suspension of his contract, stating that he would focus exclusively on his defence.

==International career==
In July 2003, Robinho was called up for the 2003 CONCACAF Gold Cup, along with his Santos teammates Alex and Diego. Although Brazil chose to send their under-23 team, the CONCACAF Gold Cup matches are considered as full international matches by FIFA. He earned his first cap in the opening match on 13 July, which Brazil lost 1–0 to Mexico, and played four further matches including the golden goal defeat to the same team in the final.

Robinho&#x27;s first cap with the full Brazil team came on 4 September 2004, as a 74th-minute substitute for Edu in a 3–1 home win over Bolivia in 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification. The following 9 February, he scored his first international goal in a 7–1 win away to Hong Kong. He went to the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup in Germany, which Brazil went on to win. During the tournament, he partnered Adriano in attack and scored in group matches against Greece and Japan.

Robinho was named in Brazil&#x27;s squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany. During the tournament, he was mainly used as a substitute, with the established forwards Ronaldo, Ronaldinho, Adriano and Kaká starting in attack. However, he was named in the starting line-up for Brazil&#x27;s third group match; a 4–1 defeat of Japan. He made a third substitute appearance of the tournament in Brazil&#x27;s 1–0 quarter-final defeat by France.

In the absence of Brazil&#x27;s World Cup forwards, Robinho was a regular starter for the team at the 2007 Copa América a year later. For the tournament, he wore the number 11 shirt, the same number that his childhood hero Romário wore. He scored all four of Brazil&#x27;s group stage goals via a hat-trick in the 3–0 win against Chile, and a penalty in a 1–0 win over Ecuador. He then scored two goals in a 6–1 quarter-final win over Chile. Brazil went on to win the tournament, beating Argentina 3–0 in the final. Robinho finished as the Golden Boot winner in addition to being named the best player of the tournament.

In 2009, he was a member of the Brazil team that won the 2009 Confederations Cup in South Africa. He played in every game in the competition, as Brazil defeated the United States 3–2 in the final to win the tournament.

Robinho was named in Brazil&#x27;s squad for the 2010 World Cup, where he played alongside Luís Fabiano in attack. He scored in the second round match against Chile as Brazil won 3–0 to advance to the quarter-finals. He then scored the opener in the quarter-final match against the Netherlands, but Brazil eventually lost 2–1 and was eliminated. A poor performance at the 2011 Copa América saw Robinho dropped and replaced by Jádson in the Brazilian line-up.

On 31 October 2013, after a hiatus of two years, Robinho was recalled to the &quot;Seleção&quot; by coach Luiz Felipe Scolari. He took part in two games against Honduras and Chile on 16 and 19 November respectively. During the game against Chile, he scored his first international goal since 2011. However, he was not included in Scolari&#x27;s squad for the 2014 World Cup.

After the World Cup, returning coach Dunga recalled Robinho to the Brazil national squad. On 6 September 2014, he played 13 minutes as a substitute in Brazil&#x27;s 1–0 win against Colombia in Miami. In May 2015, Robinho was included in Brazil&#x27;s 23-man squad for the 2015 Copa América held in Chile. He started their final group game against Venezuela after Neymar was suspended for the entire tournament. In the ninth minute, Robinho sent in the corner from which Thiago Silva volleyed Brazil into the lead in an eventual 2–1 victory which sent them into the quarter-finals as group winners. On 27 June, Robinho scored the opening goal of the quarter-final with Paraguay, which Brazil eventually lost 4–3 in a penalty shootout.

Eighteen months after his 99th game, Robinho won his 100th international cap on 25 January 2017 in a 1–0 win against Colombia at the Olympic Stadium in Rio de Janeiro. An entirely home-based squad was chosen in tribute to the Chapecoense squad killed in LaMia Flight 2933 in Colombia weeks earlier, and Robinho lined up alongside his former Santos partner Diego.

==Style of play==
A quick, creative, agile and technically gifted player, Robinho is mainly known for his flair, ball control, attacking instinct and dribbling skills, as well as his use of tricks and feints, such as the step over and the flip flap, due to his quick feet; his precocious performances and ability on the ball drew comparisons with compatriot Pelé in his youth. Usually deployed in a free role, he was capable of playing in several offensive positions, and often played as a winger, although he has also been used as a supporting forward, as a main striker, and even as an attacking midfielder on occasion, due to his tendency to be involved in the buildup of his teams&#x27; attacking plays, as well as his capacity to both score and create goals. Robinho has been criticised for his poor work-rate, lack of tactical discipline, and for his slender physique, which often leads him to go to ground easily. Despite the talent he demonstrated in his youth, his career has also been marked by inconsistency, and he has been accused by some in the sport of failing to live up to his potential.

==Personal life==
In November 2004, Robinho&#x27;s mother was kidnapped at gunpoint. She was released unharmed the following month.

In 2009, Robinho married Vivian Guglielminetti. The couple have two sons, born in 2007 and 2011, and a daughter born in 2015.

His son, Robson Junior, also became a professional footballer, and also started his career with Santos FC.

==Sexual crime and conviction==
On 23 November 2017, an Italian court sentenced Robinho to nine years in prison after he and five other males were convicted of sexual assault in the January 2013 gang rape of a 22-year-old Albanian woman at a Milan nightclub. As part of the judgment, transcripts of Robinho&#x27;s messages intercepted by police were released, including one from Robinho to a friend in January 2013 that said: &quot;I&#x27;m laughing because I couldn&#x27;t care less, the woman was completely drunk, she has no idea what happened.&quot; In a different chat, a friend of Robinho sent the message &quot;I saw you when you put your penis inside her mouth&quot;, to which Robinho replied: &quot;That doesn&#x27;t mean having sex.&quot; Under Italian law, his sentencing would not be enforced until after the completion of the appeal process. At the time of the sentencing, Robinho was in Brazil, and under Brazilian law, a Brazilian citizen cannot be extradited to a foreign country.

On 10 December 2020, Robinho&#x27;s nine-year prison sentence was upheld by the Italian courts after appeal. The Milan Court of Appeals found that Robinho had &quot;belittled&quot; and &quot;brutally humiliated&quot; the victim, while he also tried to mislead investigators from the onset by providing a false version of events he had agreed upon with his friend.

Italy&#x27;s highest court, the Supreme Court of Cassation, upheld the conviction again in January 2022. In February 2022, an arrest warrant was given internationally against Robinho by the Ministry of Justice of Italy. On 4 October 2022, Italy formally requested Brazil to extradite him and his Brazilian friend Ricardo Falco, who was also convicted in the same gang rape case, which was denied by Brazilian courts a month later.

However, on 18 February 2023, the Italian government requested Brazil to order Robinho and his friend Falco to serve their sentences in Brazil, which is theoretically possible since a new Brazilian migration law allowing people convicted abroad (Brazilians included) to serve prison time in the country under certain requirements came into effect in 2017. On 24 February 2023, Brazil&#x27;s Superior Court of Justice (STJ) subpoenaed Robinho and Falco and on 27 March Brazilian prosecutors agreed with the Italian government request. The court also ordered Robinho&#x27;s passport to be confiscated and prohibited him from leaving Brazil. In August 2023, STJ denied a preliminary request by Robinho to get the Italian sentence through he was convicted translated. In February 2024, the Court scheduled for 20 March the ruling on Italy&#x27;s government appeal to have the original sentence execute in Brazil. The Brazilian court upheld the Italian courts conviction; Robinho will serve his nine-year sentence in Brazil.

<text>Maurice Abravanel (January 6, 1903 – September 22, 1993) was an American classical music conductor. He is remembered as the conductor of the Utah Symphony for over 30 years.

==Life==
Abravanel was born in Salonika, Rumelia Eyalet, Ottoman Empire (modern Thessaloniki, Greece). He came from an illustrious Sephardic Jewish family, which was expelled from Spain in 1492 (see Isaac Abrabanel). Abravanel&#x27;s ancestors settled in Salonika in 1517, and his parents were both born there. In 1909, the Abravanel family moved to Lausanne, Switzerland, where his father, Edouard de Abravanel, was a successful pharmacist.

For several years, the Abravanels lived in the same house as Ernest Ansermet, the conductor of the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande. The young Abravanel played four-hand piano arrangements with Ansermet, began to compose, and met composers such as Darius Milhaud and Igor Stravinsky. He was passionate about music and knew he wanted a career as a musician. He became the pianist for the municipal theatre and music critic for the city&#x27;s daily newspaper.

Maurice&#x27;s father, however, insisted on a career in medicine and sent him to the University of Zürich, where he was miserable at having to dissect corpses. He wrote to his father that he would rather be second percussionist in an orchestra than a doctor, and his father finally relented.

Abravanel lived in Germany from 1922 to 1933, heavily involving himself in the music scene there. He lived in Paris from 1933 to 1936, serving as music director of Balanchine&#x27;s Paris Ballet, then conducting for two years in Australia. In 1936 Abravanel accepted a post at New York&#x27;s Metropolitan Opera, becoming at age 33 the youngest conductor the Met had ever hired. He became a U.S. citizen in 1943. In 1947 he was hired as music director of the Utah Symphony, and over the next 30 years raised the ensemble to international prominence, leading the symphony in live radio broadcasts and releasing more than 100 commercial recordings.

Abravanel was known as &quot;Maurice de Abravanel&quot; until 1938. He married singer Friedel Schako in 1933 and the couple moved to Paris that year when the Nazis came to power. The marriage ended in divorce in 1940, after Schako eloped with the conductor Otto Klemperer: the pair &quot;went careering around the country...leaving a trail of unpaid bills.&quot; In 1947, Abravanel married Lucy Menasse Carasso; they remained married until her death. He married his third wife, Carolyn Firmage, in 1987. He died in 1993 in Salt Lake City, Utah, at the age of 90.

==Music career==
In 1922, during the depression of the Weimar Republic, Abravanel, then age 19, moved to Berlin. Despite the difficult economic situation, Berlin supported three opera houses, which staged performances every night of the year. Wilhelm Furtwängler, Bruno Walter, Richard Strauss and Otto Klemperer were all conducting opera in Berlin at that time.

Abravanel became a student of the composer Kurt Weill (three years his senior), who had to accept up to 46 students to make ends meet. Abravanel later commented that Weill was &quot;a lousy teacher&quot;, but became his close friend and enthusiastic supporter. After a year of study, Abravanel landed a job as an accompanist at the opera in Neustrelitz, just north of Berlin. At the time, this was a good career path towards becoming a conductor because the accompanist rehearsed and coached the singers and would sometimes be called on to substitute when the conductor was unable to conduct at short notice.

In 1924, the theatre in Neustrelitz burned down, and the four conductors found work elsewhere. The members of the orchestra asked Abravanel if he would conduct performances at the castle. He conducted orchestra concerts twice a week at the castle with no rehearsal. He even received some pay.

In 1925, Abravanel received a position as choral director in Zwickau, in Saxony. He spent two years there, conducting the operetta repertoire. Because of his success in Zwickau, he was given a position as regular conductor at a better theatre in Altenburg.

After two years in Altenburg, Abravanel was appointed conductor at his first major opera house in Kassel. In 1931, the director of the Berlin State Opera saw him conduct a performance of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;La forza del destino&quot;. He asked him to come to Berlin and conduct a performance at the Berlin State Opera. The orchestra was impressed and applauded Abravanel. This was important because at that time the orchestra decided whether a guest conductor would be asked to return. Abravanel became a regular guest conductor.

Because of the rise of Adolf Hitler, prominent Jewish musicians were being forced to leave Germany. Feeling this danger, Abravanel chose to relocate to Paris along with Kurt Weill in 1933.

In Paris, he worked with Bruno Walter. Walter was a friend of and authority on the music of Gustav Mahler. Walter recommended Abravanel as a guest conductor at the Paris Opera, and he was able to cast, rehearse, and conduct Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; there. He also had the opportunity to conduct the Orchestre Symphonique de Paris, the regular conductor of which was Pierre Monteux. He also met George Balanchine in Paris and conducted his ballets, as well as conducting the works of his old teacher and friend, Kurt Weill. Weill and Balanchine collaborated on a ballet, &quot;The Seven Deadly Sins&quot;, which had its premiere in Paris. Abravanel was the conductor.

Weill left Paris for London, and then New York (1935), and the Abravanels left Paris for Australia (1934). Maurice had been offered a chance to direct both the Melbourne and the Sydney opera. After a six-week journey through the Suez Canal and across the Indian Ocean, he arrived to be acclaimed as the &quot;eminent continental conductor.&quot;

He conducted a 13-week season in Melbourne and a two-month season in Sydney with Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aida&quot; as the opener in both cities and a balanced selection of the standard repertoire, including Puccini, Wagner and Bizet.

In mid-spring of 1936, he received an offer from the Metropolitan Opera in New York to come and conduct the German and French repertoire. At age 33, Abravanel became the youngest contracted conductor in the history of the Met. He was offered a three-year contract, only two years of which were fulfilled, due to internal politics at the Met. For the next several years, Abravanel filled several temporary conducting stints on and around Broadway, and tried to emphasize Weill&#x27;s music wherever possible.

In 1946 the community orchestra known as the Utah Symphony began advertising for a conductor, and Abravanel applied, stating that he wanted to build a permanent orchestra of his own. He was selected from a field of 40 applicants for the position, receiving a one-year contract. In accepting the Utah offer he had to reject a lucrative contract from Radio City Music Hall, and he ended up working without pay several times during the orchestra&#x27;s darkest days. The one-year contract became a 32-year career. During that time Abravanel built the orchestra from a part-time community orchestra into a well-respected, professional ensemble with recording contracts with Vanguard, Vox, Angel, and CBS. He lobbied for years for a permanent home for the orchestra, and realized this dream when Salt Lake&#x27;s Symphony Hall opened in September 1979, shortly after he retired for health reasons.

In addition to becoming known as a major interpreter of classical composers, Abravanel championed contemporary music, recording the music of Crawford Gates and Leroy Robertson among others.

From 1954 to 1980, Abravanel also directed the Music Academy of the West in Montecito, California, where young musicians gathered for summer music camps. He taught conducting at Tanglewood, where he was appointed artist-in-residence for life. In his later years he received various honors: The American Symphony Orchestra League gave him its Gold Baton in 1981; President Bush presented him with the National Medal of Arts in 1991; and in 1993 Salt Lake City renamed its Symphony Hall Abravanel Hall.

Abravanel is remembered for making several classic recordings with the Utah Symphony for the US Vanguard label, including the Berlioz Requiem, orchestral works by Arthur Honegger, Erik Satie, Edgar Varèse and Ralph Vaughan Williams, as well as the first complete recording of Gustav Mahler&#x27;s nine symphonies by an American orchestra.

<text>Message precedence is an indicator attached to a message indicating its level of urgency, and used in the exchange of radiograms in radiotelegraph and radiotelephony procedures. Email header fields can also provide a precedence flag.

== Early telegraphic procedures ==
In the early days of telegraphy and radiotelegraphy, individual countries, and sometimes individual states, sometimes set their own regulations. For example, in the period around 1909, California required that &quot;messages must, if practicable, be transmitted immediately on and in order of receipt; if not practicable, then in the following order:&quot;
# Messages from public agents of the State or of the United States on public business.
# Messages for immediate publication in newspapers, and not for any secret use.
# Message relating to sickness or death.
# Other messages in the order of filing.

== International regulation ==
Later in the development of telegraphy and radiotelegraphy, message precedence was nominally set by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). Various ITU Regulations provide for the following priorities:

The U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, Title 47, has included the following priorities:
* ETAT PRIORITE
* FLASH EMERGENCY
* IMMEDIATE EMERGENCY
* PRIORITY EMERGENCY
* URGENT
The current U.S. Title 47 specifies these precedence designators for radiograms:

== CCEB military precedence ==
The Combined Communications Electronics Board (CCEB), a five-nation joint military communications-electronics organization (consisting of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States), uses the following message precedence designators, in descending order of importance:

* FLASH (Z) is reserved for initial enemy contact messages or operational combat messages of extreme urgency. Brevity is mandatory. FLASH messages are to be handled as fast as humanly possible, ahead of all other messages, with in-station handling time not to exceed 10 minutes. Messages of lower precedence are interrupted on all circuits involved until the handling of the FLASH message is completed.
* IMMEDIATE (O) is reserved for messages relating to situations gravely affecting the security of the nation. It requires immediate delivery. Examples include reports of widespread civil disturbance, reports or warning of grave natural disaster, and requests for or directions concerning search and rescue operations. IMMEDIATE messages are processed, transmitted, and delivered in the order received and ahead of all messages of lower precedence. They are to be handled as quickly as possible, with in-station handling time not to exceed 30 minutes. Messages of lower precedence should be interrupted on all circuits involved until the handling of the IMMEDIATE message is completed. The use of the letter &quot;O&quot; comes from the original name for this level, &quot;operational immediate&quot;.
* PRIORITY (P) is reserved for all traffic requiring expeditious action by the addressee or for conducting operations in progress when ROUTINE precedence will not suffice. PRIORITY precedence messages are processed, transmitted, and delivered in the order received and ahead of all messages of ROUTINE precedence. Examples include requests for supplies or equipment during the conduct of an operation, time-critical items requiring quick response, and situation reports. They are to be handled as quickly as possible, with in-station handling time not to exceed 3 hours.
* ROUTINE (R) is used for all types of message traffic justifying transmission by rapid means, but not of sufficient urgency to require higher precedence. ROUTINE precedence messages are delivered in the order received and after all messages of higher precedence. Examples include any message that requires the documentation of its transmission or delivery; messages concerning normal operations, programs, or projects; and periodic or consolidated reports. They should be handled as soon as traffic flow allows, but no later than the beginning of the next duty day.
* Flash Override (Y): The National Command Authority (usually the President of the United States) has access to a FLASH OVERRIDE (FO) capability. FO is not a precedence, but instead represents the authority and means to override all other traffic, including FLASH precedence messages. In written message traffic, the proword &#x27;Y&#x27; is used to indicate a message having the authority to override all other traffic and is usually assigned to Emergency Action Messages (EAM).

== Amateur radio message precedence ==
The American Amateur radio community uses EMERGENCY, PRIORITY, WELFARE and ROUTINE precedence levels for ARRL Radiograms sent through National Traffic System nets.

<doc id="1172839" wikidata="Q699538" url="?curid=1172839" title="SS-Ehrenring">
<text>The SS-Ehrenring (German for &quot;SS honour ring&quot;), unofficially called Totenkopfring (&quot;Death&#x27;s Head ring&quot; or &quot;skull ring&quot;), was an award of the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS). The ring was not a state decoration but rather a personal gift bestowed by Heinrich Himmler to SS members of distinction. It became a highly sought-after award, one which could not be bought or sold, and counterfeit replicas were produced. The SS Honour Sword and SS Honour Dagger were similar awards.

== Award ==

The &quot;SS-Ehrenring&quot; was initially presented to senior officers of the &quot;Alter Kämpfer&quot; (Old Guard) within the SS, of whom there were fewer than 5,000. This was later expanded to all SS members who graduated from the SS-Junker Schools and other SS training facilities. Each ring had the recipient&#x27;s name, the award date, and Himmler&#x27;s signature engraved on the interior. The ring came with a standard letter from Himmler and citation. It was to be worn only on the left hand, on the &quot;ring finger&quot;. The name of the recipient and the conferment date was added on the letter. In the letter, according to Himmler, the ring was a &quot;reminder at all times to be willing to risk the life of ourselves for the life of the whole&quot;. Some SS and police members had local jewellers make unofficial versions to wear.

If an SS member was dismissed or retired from the service, his ring had to be returned. In 1938, Himmler ordered the return of all rings of dead SS men and officers to be stored in a chest at Wewelsburg Castle. This was to be a memorial to symbolise the ongoing membership of the deceased in the SS order. In October 1944, Himmler ordered that further manufacture and awards of the ring were to be halted. Himmler then ordered that all the remaining rings, approximately 11,500, be blast-sealed inside a hill near Wewelsburg. By January 1945, 64% of the 14,500 rings made had been returned to Himmler after the deaths of the &quot;holders&quot;. In addition, 10% had been lost on the battlefield and 26% were either kept by the holder or their whereabouts were unknown.

== Design ==

The symbolism of the ring reflects Himmler&#x27;s interest in Germanic mysticism and includes the &quot;Totenkopf&quot; symbol and Armanen runes. The ring was designed by Karl Maria Wiligut, an Austrian occultist and SS-&quot;Brigadeführer&quot; with manufacturing provided by the Otto and Karolina Gahr Family Jewelry from Munich. Rings were manufactured following roughly two major types, the one defined in the 1930s and that of the 1940s. The ring models dating back to the 1930s were thinner while the later ones were thickened and the design of the skull changed. Rings were made of 90% silver cast in two halves with the recipient&#x27;s name inside, the date of presentation, and a facsimile of Himmler&#x27;s signature, plus the abbreviations S Lb. for &quot;Seinem Lieben&quot; or &quot;His Beloved.&quot;

* One Sig rune left and right of the skull framed by a triangle represents the power of the sun and conquering energy.
* A Hagal rune (framed by a hexagon) which represents the faith and camaraderie that was idealised by the leaders of the organisation. The esoteric meaning of the Hagal rune was, according to Guido von List, to: &quot;...enclose the universe in you and you control the universe.&quot;
* A swastika (standing on the vertex) framed by a square. The SS liked to portray the swastika as another influential symbol of the power of the Aryan race.
* The double runes on the rear of the ring framed by a circle were to be &quot;Heilszeichen&quot; (literally: signs of salvation) of the past. They were a creation of the SS designers rather than historical runes. They are Wiligut&#x27;s variation of the Gibor rune plus a bind rune for &quot;o&quot; (Os) and &quot;t&quot; (Tyr). The bind rune was designed by Wiligut and spells &quot;Gott&quot;, the German word for &quot;God.&quot;

The ring is wreathed with oak leaves.

<text>Jules Eugène Goux (6 April 1885 – 6 March 1965) was a French racing driver and Grand Prix motor racing champion. He was notable for being the first European driver to win the Indianapolis 500.

== Biography ==

Influenced by the Gordon Bennett Cup in auto racing, Goux began racing cars in his early twenties. Success came in 1909 on a circuit set up on roads around Sitges, near Barcelona, Spain, when he won the Catalan Cup, a victory he repeated the following year. Because of his racing success, along with Georges Boillot, he was invited by Peugeot Automobile to race for their factory team. As part of a four-man design team led by Paul Zuccarelli and Ernest Henry, Goux helped develop a racecar powered by a radically new Straight-4 engine using a twin overhead cam.

Goux won the 1912 Sarthe Cup at Le Mans driving a Peugeot, and in 1913 he traveled with the team to the United States to compete in the Indianapolis 500. Goux won the race, becoming the first non-American Indianapolis 500 winner in history. Goux reportedly consumed four bottles of champagne while driving in the Indianapolis 500 (then known as the International 500-Mile Sweepstakes Race) and was later quoted as saying, &quot;Without the good wine, I would have not been able to win.&quot;

The following year, World War I broke out in Europe and Goux&#x27;s racing career had to be put aside for service in the French military. At war&#x27;s end, he returned to European Grand Prix motor racing. In 1921, driving for Ballot Automobile, he finished third in the French Grand Prix then won the inaugural Italian Grand Prix at Brescia, Italy. For the next few years his racing career was marked by repeated problems and he did not return to the winner&#x27;s circle until 1926. That year, driving for Bugatti in a T39A model, he won both the French Grand Prix at Miramas and the European Grand Prix at the Circuito Lasarte, Spain.

<doc id="1172846" wikidata="Q288174" url="?curid=1172846" title="European Union energy label">
<text>EU Directive 92/75/EC (1992) established an energy consumption labelling scheme. The directive was implemented by several other directives thus most white goods, light bulb packaging and cars must have an EU Energy Label clearly displayed when offered for sale or rent. The energy efficiency of the appliance is rated in terms of a set of energy efficiency classes from A to G on the label, A being the most energy efficient, G the least efficient. The labels also give other useful information to the customer as they choose between various models. The information should also be given in catalogues and included by internet retailers on their websites.

In an attempt to keep up with advances in energy efficiency, A+, A++, and A+++ grades were later introduced for various products; since 2010, a new type of label exists that makes use of pictograms rather than words, to allow manufacturers to use a single label for products sold in different countries.

Directive 92/75/EC was replaced by Directive 2010/30/EU, and was again replaced by Regulation 2017/1369/EU from 1 August 2017. Updated labelling requirements entered into force in 2021, the exact date depended on the relevant delegated regulation (e.g. dishwasher&#x27;s labels changed on 1 March 2021).

It reintroduced a simpler classification, using only the letters from A to G. The rescaling led to better differentiation among products that, under the previous label classification, all appeared in the same top categories. It meant, for example, that a fridge that previously had an A+++ label could now be a C category, even though the fridge is just as energy efficient as before. The main principle was that the A category would be empty at first, and B and C categories scarcely populated, to pave way for new, more energy efficient products to be invented and developed.

==Major appliances==

===Labelling===
The energy labels are separated into at least four categories:
*The appliance&#x27;s details: according to each appliance, specific details, of the model and its materials.
*Energy class: a colour code associated with a letter (from A to G) that gives an idea of the appliance&#x27;s electrical consumption relative to what is available on the market
*Consumption, efficiency, capacity, etc.: this section gives information according to appliance type.
*Noise: the noise emitted by the appliance is described in decibels.

===Refrigerating appliances===
For refrigerating appliances, such as refrigerators, freezers, wine-storage appliances, and combined appliances, the labelling is specified in terms of an energy efficiency index EEI, which is an indication of the annual power consumption relative to a reference consumption that is based on the storage volume and the type of appliance (refrigerator or freezer). 
The label also contains:
*the annual energy consumption in kW·h
*the capacity of fresh foods in litres for refrigerators and combined appliances
*the capacity of frozen foods in litres for freezers and combined appliances
*the noise in dB(A)

====Pre-2021====
For cold appliances (and this product alone), for models that are more economical than those of category A, categories A+, A++, and A+++ were previously assigned. According to the 2010 regulations, the boundary between the A+ and A classes was 44 up to 1 July 2014, and 42 after that date.
===Washing machines and tumble dryers===
Up to 2010, the energy efficiency scale for washing machines is calculated based on a cotton cycle at 60 °C (140 °F) with a maximum declared load. This load is typically 6 kg. The energy efficiency index is in kW·h per kilogram of washing, assuming a cold-water supply at 15 °C.

The energy label also contains information on:
*total consumption per cycle
*washing performance – with a class from A to G
*spin drying performance – with a class from A to G
*maximum spin speed
*the total cotton capacity in kg
*water consumption per cycle in litres
*noise in the washing and spinning cycles dB(A)

The washing performance is measured according to European harmonised standard EN 60456 and is based on a 60 °C cycle on fabric samples with stains of oil, blood, chocolate, sebum, and red wine, using a standardised detergent and compared against a reference washing machine. The amount of stain removal is then translated into a washing performance index.

The spin-drying efficiency class is based on the remaining moisture content (RMC), which is the mass of water divided by the dry mass of cotton fabrics. It is based on a weighted average of full-load and partial-load cycles.
A new energy label, introduced in 2010, is based on the energy efficiency index (EEI), and has energy classes in the range A+++ to D. The EEI is a measure of the annual electricity consumption, and includes energy consumed during power-off and standby modes, and the energy consumed in 220 washing cycles. For the washing cycles, a weighted mix consisting of 42% full-load cycles at 60 °C, 29% partial-load cycles at 60 °C, and 29% partial-load cycles at 40 °C. The washing performance is not mentioned anymore, since all washing machines must reach class A anyway. For a 6-kg machine, an EEI of 100 is equivalent to 334 kWh per year, or 1.52 kWh per cycle.
For tumble dryers the energy efficiency scale is calculated using the cotton drying cycle with a maximum declared load. The energy efficiency index is in kW·h per kilogram of load. Different scales apply for condenser and vented dryers.

For condenser dryers, a weighted condensation efficiency class is calculated using the average condensation efficiency for the standard cotton cycle at both full and partial load.
The label also contains:
*the energy consumption per cycle
*the total cotton capacity
*whether the unit is vented or condensing
*cycle time corresponding to the standard cotton programme at full load in minutes
*noise in dB(A)

For combined washer dryers the energy efficiency scale is calculated using the cotton drying cycle with a maximum declared load. The energy efficiency index is in kW·h per kilogram of load. Different scales apply for condenser and vented dryers.
The label also contains:
*the energy consumption per cycle (washing and drying)
*the energy consumption per cycle – washing only
*washing performance – with a class from A to G
*the maximum spin speed
*the total cotton capacity (washing and drying separately)
*water consumption for a full load washed and dried – note that condenser dryers may use significant amounts of water on the drying cycle
*noise in dB (A) (separately for washing, spinning, and drying)

===Dishwashers===

The energy efficiency of a dishwasher is calculated according to the number of place settings. For the most common size of appliance, the 12 place setting machine the following classes apply up to 2010. 

After 2010, a new system is used, based on an energy efficiency index (EEI), which is based on the annual power usage, based on stand-by power consumption and 280 cleaning cycles, relative to the standard power usage for that type of dishwasher. For a 12-place-setting dishwasher, an EEI of 100 corresponds to 462 kWh per year (approximately 52.7 watts, on average).
After 2021, the energy efficiency index (EEI) thresholds were updated.&lt;ref name=&quot;EU energy labelling of household dishwashers, Regulation 2019/2017&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The label also contains:
*the energy consumption in kW·h /cycle
*the efficiency of the washing cycle with a class from A to G
*the efficiency of the drying cycle with a class from A to G
*the capacity as a number of place settings
*the water consumption in litres per cycle
*noise in dB(A)

===Ovens===
For ovens, the label also contains:
*the efficiency with a class from A to G
*the energy consumption in kW·h
*the volume in litres
*the type (small/medium/large)

==Air conditioners==
For air conditioners, the directive applies only to units under 12 kW. Every label contains the following information:
*the model,
*the energy efficiency category from A+++ to G,
*the annual energy consumption (full load at 500 hours per year)
*the cooling output at full load in kW
*the energy efficiency ratio in cooling mode at full load
*the appliance type (cooling only, cooling/heating)
*the cooling mode (air- or water-cooled)
*the noise rating in dB (where applicable)
Labels for air conditioners with heating capability also contain:
*the heat output at full load in kW
*the heating mode energy efficiency category

==Light bulbs==

Every label of light sources, including light bulbs (halogen, compact fluorescent, etc.) or LED modules/lamps, contains the following information:
*the energy efficiency category from A to G
*the electricity consumption of the lamp in kWh per 1000 hours

Where the energy efficiency category is given by this table:&lt;ref name=&quot;EU energy labelling of light sources, Regulation 2019/2015&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Where, formula_1, is defined as the total mains efficacy, calculated as:
formula_2

Where formula_3 is the declared useful luminous flux (in lm), formula_4 is the declared on-mode power consumption (in watts), and formula_5 is a factor between 0.926 and 1.176 depending on the light source being or not directional and being or not powered from mains. Non-directional operating on mains: 1,000 and not operating on mains: 0,926; directional on mains: 1,176 and not on mains: 1,089.

===Until 31 August 2021===
Every label of light bulbs and tubes (including incandescent light bulbs, fluorescent lamps, LED lamps) contains the following information:
*the energy efficiency category from A to G
*the luminous flux of the bulb in lumens
*the electricity consumption of the lamp in watts
*the average life length in hours

According to the light bulb&#x27;s electrical consumption relative to a standard (GLS or incandescent), the lightbulb is in one of the following classes:

Class A is defined in a different way; hence, the variable percentage.

Since 2012 A+ and A++ classes are added and are introduced different classes for directional lamps and non-directional lamps.

Directional lamps are defined as &quot;having at least 80% light output within a solid angle of π sr (corresponding to a cone with angle of 120°)&quot;.
These lamp classes correspond roughly to the following lamp types:

Since September 2009, household light bulbs must be class A, with the exception of clear (transparent) lamps. For the latter category, lamps must be class C or better, with a transition period up to September 2012, and class B after September 2016.

====Calculation====

Incandescent and fluorescent lamps with and without an integrated ballast can be divided into energy efficiency classes. The division of lamps into such classes was made in EU Directive 98/11/EC on 27 January 1998, and includes lamps that are not marketed for use in the home. Light sources with an output of more than 6,500 lm and those that are not operated on line voltage are excluded. The energy efficiency class is determined as follows (Φ is the luminous flux in lm and &quot;P&quot; is the power consumption of the lamp in W):

Lamps are classified into class A if:
:formula_6
Fluorescent lamps without integrated ballast, are classified into class A if:
:formula_7

The classification in the energy efficiency class B-G is based on the percentage (Energy Efficiency Index) at the reference power
:formula_8
about the power consumption of a standard light bulb with the same luminous flux.

==Television==
The current regulation on energy labels for televisions (and other electronic displays) was introduced in 2019, replacing the previous 2010 version.

The energy class is based on the Energy Efficiency Index (EEI), which is the power consumption relative to a reference power consumption. The index of a normal television with screen area &quot;A&quot; (in dm2) is
:formula_9

Where formula_10 is the measured power in on mode in Watts in the normal configuration, and formula_11 is a correction factor used for digital signage.

For example, a television with a diagonal length of 82 cm has a screen area of &quot;A&quot; = 28.7 dm2 and a reference power consumption of 38W. The energy classes are as in the table below.
In televisions with automatic brightness control (ABC), the on-mode power consumption is reduced by 10 % if the following conditions are fulfilled:

* ABC is enabled in the normal configuration of the electronic display and persists in any other standard dynamic range configuration available to the end user
* the value of formula_10, in the normal configuration, is measured, with ABC disabled or if ABC cannot be disabled, in an ambient light condition of 100 lux measured at the ABC sensor
* if applicable, the value of formula_10 with ABC disabled shall be equal to or greater than the on mode power measured with ABC enabled in an ambient light condition of 100 lux measured at the ABC sensor
* with ABC enabled, the measured value of the on mode power must decrease by 20 % or more when the ambient light condition, measured at the ABC sensor, is reduced from 100 lux to 12 lux
* the ABC control of the display screen luminance meets all of the following characteristics when the ambient light condition measured at the ABC sensor changes:
** the measured screen luminance at 60 lux is between 65 % and 95 % of the screen luminance measured at 100 lux
** the measured screen luminance at 35 lux is between 50 % and 80 % of the screen luminance measured at 100 lux
** the measured screen luminance at 12 lux is between 35 % and 70 % of the screen luminance measured at 100 lux

==Cars==

For vehicles possessing internal combustion engines, carbon dioxide emissions in grams per kilometre travelled are considered (instead of electrical efficiency).
Other information that is indexed for the energy label is:
*its brand
*its model
*its version
*its fuel
*its transmission type
*its weight
*the different consumptions of fuel
**mixed consumption
**urban consumption
**extra-urban consumption
*the CO2 emissions in grammes per kilometre

==Tyres==
European tyre labels came into force in November 2012. The tyre labelling will show three tyre performance attributes; rolling resistance, wet grip and external rolling noise. The tyre label apply to: 
*Car and SUV tyres
*Van tyres
*Truck tyres

with the exception of: 
*Tyres for cars made before 1 October 1990
*Re-treaded tyres
*Motorcycle tyres
*Racing/sports car tyres
*Studded tyres
*Spare tyres
*Vintage car tyres
*Professional off-road tyres.

=== Impacts on purchasing decisions ===
A trial of estimated financial energy cost of refrigerators alongside EU energy-efficiency class (EEEC) labels online found that the approach of labels involves a trade-off between financial considerations and higher cost requirements in effort or time for the product-selection from the many available options – which are often unlabelled and don&#x27;t have any EEEC-requirement for being bought, used or sold within the EU. Moreover, in this one trial the labeling was ineffective in shifting purchases towards more sustainable options.

<text>Achille Varzi (8 August 1904 – 1 July 1948) was an Italian racing driver. He is remembered as the chief rival of Tazio Nuvolari, and was the winner of the 1933 Monaco Grand Prix.

== Career ==

Born in Galliate, province of Novara (Piedmont), Achille Varzi was the son of a textile manufacturer. As a young man, he was a successful motorcycle racer of Garelli, DOT, Moto Guzzi and Sunbeam, and rode seven times in the Isle of Man TT from 1924 before switching to auto racing in 1928 where, for the next ten years, he would rival Tazio Nuvolari, Rudolf Caracciola and Bernd Rosemeyer.

Varzi&#x27;s first race car was a Type 35 Bugatti but he shortly changed to driving an Alfa Romeo, a brand with which he would score many victories during the 1929 Italian racing season. In 1930 Varzi acquired a vehicle from the relatively new Maserati company. He drove it as well as an Alfa Romeo earning his country&#x27;s racing championship, a feat he would repeat in 1934. One of his big victories came at the prestigious Targa Florio where he upset the favored Louis Chiron. Following his win at the 1933 Tripoli Grand Prix, a race at the time associated with a lottery, Varzi was at the forefront of allegations that the race had been fixed.

Varzi won six Grand Prix in 1934 driving the Alfa Romeo P3, at Alessandria, Tripoli, Targa Florio, Penya Rhin at Barcelona, Coppa Ciano and Nice. He also became the first driver in history to hold both the Targa Florio and Mille Miglia title in one season

Although the Alfa Romeo team had proved to be competitive under the management of Enzo Ferrari, Varzi decided to join the Auto Union team, racing for them between 1935 and 1937. This move coincided with Varzi having serious personal problems, including an addiction to morphine and a difficult affair with Ilse Pietsch (Engel/Hubitsch/Feininger), the wife of fellow driver Paul Pietsch. Quickly overshadowed by teammate Bernd Rosemeyer, his trips to the winners circle dropped to only four, but he did win his third Tripoli Grand Prix in his third different vehicle. By 1938 he had dropped out of sight and the advent of World War II ended racing in Europe. During the war, Varzi overcame his drug addiction and settled down with his new wife, Norma Colombo. At the end of the War, Varzi made a remarkable comeback at the age of 42. In 1946 he attempted to race a Maserati for the Indianapolis 500 but failed to qualify. In 1947, he won three minor Grand Prix races and traveled to Argentina to race in the Buenos Aires Grand Prix.

== Death ==

During practice runs for the 1948 Swiss Grand Prix a light rain fell on the Bremgarten track in Berne, Switzerland. Varzi&#x27;s Alfa Romeo 158 skidded on the wet surface, flipping over and crushing him to death. He was buried in his hometown.

== Legacy ==

Varzi&#x27;s death resulted in the FIA mandating the wearing of crash helmets for racing, which had been optional previously.
In 1950 Varzi&#x27;s chief mechanic, Amedeo Bignami, co-established the &quot;Scuderia Achille Varzi&quot; in Argentina. The team entered some Formula One races in equipped with Maseratis 4CL and 4CLT and featured drivers José Froilán González, Antonio Branca, Alfredo Pián and Nello Pagani.

On 5 June 2004 Poste Italiane issued a stamp commemorating Achille Varzi.

== In popular culture ==

Varzi was mentioned more than once in the 2023 movie, Ferrari (2023 film). In the film, at least twice, Enzo Ferrari said that the newest addition to his racing team, Alfonso de Portago, &quot;drives like Varzi.&quot;

== Motorsports career results ==

=== Notable victories ===

In 1991, motorsport journalist Giorgio Terruzzi recounted Varzi&#x27;s story in a book titled &quot;Una curva cieca – Vita di Achille Varzi&quot;. During his career, Achille Varzi competed in 139 races, winning 33. Some of his major victories include:

*Avusrennen: 1933
*Coppa Acerbo: 1930, 1935
*Coppa Ciano: 1929, 1934
*French Grand Prix: 1931
*Monza Grand Prix: 1929, 1930
*Nice Grand Prix: 1934
*Gran Premio del Valentino: 1946
*Mille Miglia: 1934
*Monaco Grand Prix: 1933
*Penya Rhin Grand Prix: 1934
*Targa Florio: 1930, 1934
*San Remo Grand Prix: 1937
*Spanish Grand Prix: 1930
*Tripoli Grand Prix: 1933, 1934, 1936

<text>Christian Friedrich Lautenschlager (13 April 1877 – 3 January 1954) was a German racing driver.

== Biography ==

Born in the village of Magstadt, Kingdom of Württemberg, Germany near Stuttgart, Christian Lautenschlager was 14 years old when he began training for a career as a machinist at a company in Stuttgart. After a few jobs, he spent time traveling around Europe, returning to Stuttgart in 1899 at the age 22 where he found work at the Daimler factory. There, he worked his way up to the positions of mechanic and then of test driver for the company&#x27;s race cars.

In 1908, Lautenschlager was given the opportunity to drive one of three Mercedes race vehicles, and he drove it to victory in the French Grand Prix at Dieppe, France. He returned to his factory job rather than joining the racing circuit as a permanent driver. In 1914, driving a Mercedes 37/95, he won the Elgin Trophy in Elgin, Illinois. He raced only a few more times until he achieved great fame at Lyon, France, on 4 July 1914, by winning the 1914 French Grand Prix. As the assassination in Sarajevo had happened days earlier, international tensions were high, and this was the last Grand Prix before World War I started.

Considered one of the great Grand Prix events in motor-racing history, 37 cars from 13 manufacturers in 6 different countries competed in the French Grand Prix race that for the first time had a limit on the size of the engine allowed, set at 4.5 litres. Against a top field led by Frenchman Georges Boillot, who had won the race the past two years, after seven gruelling hours, Lautenschlager took victory in the prestigious event for the second time. The onset of World War I ended Grand Prix motor racing in Europe.

In the early 1920s, when Lautenschlager was in his 40s, he raced on a semi-regular basis but without much success. He competed in the 1922 Targa Florio, finishing in tenth place. In 1923, he traveled to the United States to compete in the Indianapolis 500 as part of a three-car Mercedes team. Driving vehicles equipped with the first supercharged engine in the race&#x27;s history, their effort proved less than successful and Lautenschlager finished 23rd. The following year brought no victories, and he retired from racing.

Christian Lautenschlager worked for Daimler until his retirement. He died at the age of 76 in Untertürkheim, a suburb of Stuttgart.

<doc id="1172861" wikidata="Q850205" url="?curid=1172861" title="L6/40 tank">
<text>The L6/40 was a light tank used by the Italian army from 1940 through World War II. It was designed by Ansaldo as an export product, and was adopted by the Italian Army when officials learned of the design and expressed interest. It was the main tank employed by the Italian forces fighting on the Eastern Front alongside the L6/40-based Semovente 47/32 self-propelled gun. L6/40s were also used in the North African campaign.

The official Italian designation was Carro Armato (&quot;armored vehicle&quot;, i.e. &quot;tank&quot;) L6/40. This designation means: &quot;L&quot; for &quot;Leggero&quot; (&quot;light&quot;), followed by the weight in tons (6) and the year of adoption (1940).

== Design and development ==
The L6/40 was a conventional light tank design of riveted construction. A one-man turret in the centre mounted a single Breda Modello 35 20 mm main gun and a Breda 38 8 mm coaxial machine gun. The driver sat in the front right of the hull. The riveted armour was six to 40 mm in thickness, which was roughly equivalent to existing Allied light tanks.

Compared to early 1930s Italian attempts at light tanks, the Carro D&#x27;Assalto 1936 and Carro Cannone Modello 1936 which were derived from the L3/33 tankettes, the L6/40 was a completely new design, the L6 went through a number of prototypes during the late 1930s. The first version had only twin 8 mm machine guns. Ultimately, the production configuration, named Carro Armato L6/40, was put into production in 1939, with 419 finally produced.

=== Variants ===
The L6 Lf (Lancia fiamme) flame tank variant was developed in which the main gun was replaced by a flamethrower with 200 litres of fuel. A command-tank variant carried extra radio gear and had an open-topped turret.

The most successful of the L6 variants was the Semovente 47/32, which eliminated the turret and substituted a 47 mm antitank gun in the open-topped hull.

A final version late in the war was an ammunition carrier armed only with a single 8 mm Breda machine gun. It was used alongside the Semovente 90/53, carrying 26 extra 90 mm rounds, as the Semovente 90/53 itself could only carry eight rounds.

== Combat use ==
L6/40 light tanks were used by the Italians in the Balkans Campaign, in the war against the Soviet Union, in the latter stages of the North African campaign, and in the defence of Sicily and Italy.

The L6/40 was the main tank employed by the Italian forces fighting on the Eastern Front. The L6 fought alongside the L6/40-based Semovente 47/32 self-propelled gun.

Although a good light tank for its size and an improvement over the tankettes that were common within the Italian army, it was already obsolete by the time of its introduction. The low silhouette of the vehicle (somewhat taller than the average man) made it useful for reconnaissance, and its armament was effective against any light vehicles it might encounter. However, due to a lack of a suitable medium tank, it was often employed in a combat role for which it was unsuited.

The L6 was also used by the German Army. In 1943, 26 Italian L6s were captured and used by the Hrvatsko domobranstvo of the Independent State of Croatia.
The L6/40 was used postwar by the Polizia di Stato until it was phased out during the early 1950s.

== Surviving examples ==
Three L6/40s survive: one is kept in Legnano near the &quot;Cadorna&quot; barracks, one is in the inventory of the Kubinka Tank Museum, and another is preserved in the Arms Museum in the castle of Gjirokastër in Albania.

The hull of an L/40 used in Operation Rösselsprung, is displayed as a war memorial in Drvar Bosnia Herzegovina.

<text>Stand! is the fourth album by soul/funk band Sly and the Family Stone, released in May 3, 1969. Written and produced by lead singer and multi-instrumentalist Sly Stone, &quot;Stand!&quot; is considered an artistic high-point of the band&#x27;s career. Released by Epic Records, just before the group&#x27;s celebrated performance at the Woodstock festival, it became the band&#x27;s most commercially successful album to date. It includes several well-known songs, among them hit singles, such as &quot;Sing a Simple Song&quot;, &quot;I Want to Take You Higher&quot;, &quot;Stand!&quot;, and &quot;Everyday People&quot;. The album was reissued in 1990 on compact disc and vinyl, and again in 2007 as a remastered numbered edition digipack CD with bonus tracks and, in the UK, as only a CD with bonus tracks.

The album sold 500,000 copies in 1969 and was certified gold in sales by the RIAA on December 4 of that year. It peaked at number 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and stayed on the chart for nearly two years. By 1986 it had sold well over 1 million copies and was certified platinum in sales by the RIAA on November 21 of that same year. It then went on to sell over three million copies, becoming one of the most successful albums of the 1960s. In 2003, the album was ranked number 118 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, 121 in a 2012 revised list, and number 119 in a 2020 reboot of the list. In 2015, the album was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the Library of Congress and selected for inclusion in the National Recording Registry. In 2015, &quot;Stand!&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

==Production==
&quot;Stand!&quot; was recorded after &quot;Life&quot;, a commercially unsuccessful album. Although the Family Stone&#x27;s single &quot;Dance to the Music&quot; was a top ten hit in early 1968, none of the band&#x27;s first three albums reached above 100 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;Stand!&quot; reached number thirteen and launched Sly Stone and his bandmates Freddie Stone, Larry Graham, Rose Stone, Cynthia Robinson, Jerry Martini, and Greg Errico into the pop music mainstream.

Much of the album was recorded at Pacific High Recording Studios in San Francisco. The band&#x27;s A&amp;R director and photographer Stephen Paley recalled how &quot;together&quot; Sly Stone was while working on &quot;Stand!&quot;, constantly referring to Walter Piston&#x27;s &quot;Orchestration&quot; textbook, unlike his erratic behavior and work after he became dependent upon cocaine within a year of the album&#x27;s success.

==Songs==
&quot;Stand!&quot; begins with the title track on which Sly sings lead, a mid-tempo number launching into a gospel break for its final forty-nine seconds. Most of the Family Stone was unavailable for the session at which this coda was recorded: Sly, drummer Gregg Errico and horn players Cynthia Robinson and Jerry Martini were augmented by session players instead. Errico recalls that many liked the gospel extension more than they did the song proper, and that; &quot;People would always ask, &#x27;why didn&#x27;t you go there and let that be the song?&#x27;&quot; The second track, titled &quot;Don&#x27;t Call Me Nigger, Whitey&quot;, has few lyrics save for the chorus &quot;Don&#x27;t call me &quot;nigger&quot;, whitey/Don&#x27;t call me &quot;whitey&quot;, nigger&quot; and a single verse sung by Rose Stone. On &quot;I Want to Take You Higher&quot; Freddie Stone, Larry Graham, Rose Stone, and Sly Stone take turns delivering the lead vocal and all seven band-members deliver the shouted backing vocals. Sly Stone, Robinson, Freddie Stone, Graham, and Martini all play instrumental solos.

On &quot;Somebody&#x27;s Watching You&quot; Sly Stone, Graham, Freddie Stone, and Rose Stone deliver the vocal in unison. The song&#x27;s slightly pessimistic tone would be expanded upon later in the band&#x27;s career with &quot;Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)&quot; and the &quot;There&#x27;s a Riot Goin&#x27; On&quot; LP, and would be a hit for the Family Stone&#x27;s vocal group Little Sister, the first Top 40 single to use a drum machine. &quot;Sing a Simple Song&quot; urges the audience to &quot;try a little do re mi fa so la ti do&quot;. Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes, The Temptations and The Jackson 5 all recorded cover versions of the song. The track&#x27;s guitar riff is heard on Ike &amp; Tina Turner&#x27;s &quot;Bold Soul Sister&quot; (from &quot;The Hunter&quot;, 1969), Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s &quot;Band of Gypsys&quot; (1970) and Miles Davis&#x27; &quot;A Tribute to Jack Johnson&quot; (1971).

&quot;Everyday People&quot;, already a number-one hit single in the United States by the time of the album&#x27;s release, opens Side B. The most familiar song on the album, &quot;Everyday People&quot; popularized the expression &quot;different strokes for different folks&quot;. Sly Stone, Rose Stone and Cynthia Robinson sing lead and Larry Graham introduces the slap-pop style of bass he expanded on &quot;Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)&quot;. &quot;Sex Machine&quot; is a thirteen-minute jam that features Sly scatting through amplified distortion and allows each band member a solo. Gregg Errico&#x27;s drum solo closes the song and the band members are heard bursting into laughter during the final seconds. &quot;Stand!&quot; concludes with &quot;You Can Make It If You Try&quot;, sung by Sly Stone, Freddie Stone, and Larry Graham. Sly Stone instead of Larry Graham played the bass. It was, at one point, planned for a single release in mid-1969, following up &quot;Stand!&quot;, but this was dropped in favor of the non-album track &quot;Hot Fun in the Summertime&quot;. The unused mono single mix was later included on the 2007 CD reissue.

==Critical reception and legacy==

Reviewing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in July 1969, Alec Dubro observed a &quot;very evident sense of moral purpose&quot; in the content and a rawness in its brand of soul music, which he said &quot;depends on sheer energy more than anything else&quot;. Overall, he found the album provocative and &quot;effective&quot;, recommended &quot;for anyone who can groove on a bunch of very raucous kids charging through a record, telling you exactly what they think whether you want to hear it that way or not.&quot; In the same magazine, covering Epic/Legacy&#x27;s 2007 reissue of the band&#x27;s catalogue, Robert Christgau said that &quot;&quot;Stand!&quot; revealed the magnificence of which this band would all too briefly be capable. &#x27;Sex Machine,&#x27; which precipitated James Brown&#x27;s, wah-wahs on a bit, but everything else is etched in Stone, from the equally precipitous &#x27;Don&#x27;t Call Me Nigger, Whitey&#x27; to the Chaka Khan fave &#x27;Somebody&#x27;s Watching You&#x27; to, yes you can, &#x27;You Can Make It If You Try.&#x27;&quot; Also appraising the reissue campaign, Peter Shapiro wrote in &quot;Uncut&quot; that &quot;Stand!&quot; was &quot;the group’s true breakthrough&quot; as its &quot;seamless blend of rock, funk and soul, and the soaring mix of black and white voices, made crossover seem like Utopia.&quot; Commenting on the music&#x27;s historical context, Shapiro added:

The Jackson 5 covered both &quot;Stand!&quot; and &quot;Want to Take You Higher&quot; on their album &quot;Goin&#x27; Back to Indiana&quot;.

Primal Scream sampled &quot;Sex Machine&quot; on their cover of The 13th Floor Elevators&#x27; &quot;Slip Inside This House&quot; from their Screamadelica album

Rapper Ice-T, Body Count, and Jane&#x27;s Addiction performed &quot;Don&#x27;t Call Me Nigger, Whitey&quot; during the 1991 Lollapalooza tour and in the 1993 Perry Farrell film &quot;Gift&quot;.

<text>Antonio Ascari (15 September 1888 – 26 July 1925) was an Italian Grand Prix motor racing champion. He won four Grands Prix before his premature death at the 1925 French Grand Prix. He was the father of two-time World Champion Alberto Ascari.

==Early life==
Ascari was born at Bonferraro Di Sorgà, near Mantua but in the Veneto region of Italy, as the son of a wheat salesman. He left school early and worked for some time in a blacksmith&#x27;s forge. After moving to Milan with his family, he worked as a mechanic with car manufacturers ; while there he was given his first drive at a touring car event in Modena in 1911. he spent the First World War servicing aircraft. When the war ended he set up an Alfa Romeo dealership in Milan.

==Career==
He began racing cars at the top level in 1919. When Fiat withdrew from the that year, he bought one of their cars, a Fiat Grand Prix 4500, entered the competition (which was also the debut race for Enzo Ferrari), and won. He followed it up with a win in the Consuma hillclimb. He drove the same car in the 1919 Targa Florio, and was performing well until he skidded off the racetrack into a deep ravine; despite this, his bosses took note of his talent and recruited him into the Alfa Romeo team. The company also granted him the concession for the whole of Lombardy. As well as sales, he had a role in development, and was involved in the production of the Alfa Romeo ES Sport. He raced for Alfa Romeo in the 1920 and 1921 Targa Florio, without great success, but in 1922 he finished fourth. He was leading the 1923 race when his car broke down just short of the finish line. He got it going again, but his teammate, Ugo Sivocci, passed him to win the race, with Ascari finishing second. A month later, at the Cremona Circuit, he drove to his first major Grand Prix victory, driving an Alfa Romeo RL TF. He entered the 1923 Italian Grand Prix, where he was to drive the new P1 car, but the team withdrew from the race after Sivocci was killed during practice.

In 1924, Ascari was again the winner at Cremona, in the first race of the new P2, designed by Vittorio Jano. He suffered frustration again in the 1924 Targa Florio when his car failed within a few hundred yards of victory; Ascari, his mechanic, Giulio Ramponi, and some spectators pushed the car over the line but he was disqualified for receiving outside assistance. He suffered a similar fate in the French Grand Prix, then went on to Monza where he won the Italian Grand Prix, leading the race from start to finish.

In 1925, the AIACR introduced the World Manufacturers&#x27; Championship. Alfa Romeo did not contest the first race, the Indianapolis 500, but instead headed to Spa-Francorchamps for the Belgian Grand Prix. Twelve drivers from four teams entered the race, but only seven turned up, from two teams: Alfa Romeo and Delage. By half way, four of the seven had retired, and by two-thirds way, only Ascari and his team-mate Giuseppe Campari remained. Ascari won the race by 21 minutes 58 seconds, with Campari having to drive twice around the circuit on his own to complete his race.

==Death and legacy==
On 26 July 1925, Ascari took part in the French Grand Prix at the Autodrome de Montlhéry, south of Paris. He was leading the race when, on lap 23, he swerved at a left handed corner and got caught in some wooden fencing, which caused his car to overturn. One of his legs was almost severed, and he was bleeding heavily from several wounds, including a head wound; medical help was slow in coming, and Ascari died in the ambulance on his way to hospital. He was 36 years old. Alfa withdrew their other cars from the race, and race winners Robert Benoist and Albert Divo drove to the scene of the crash and laid their winners&#x27; garlands there.

Ascari&#x27;s death led to an outpouring of grief, both in France and in Italy. His body was put on display in Montlhéry, where locals filed past it. During its journey to Milan by train, flowers were laid at each stop on the carriage containing his coffin. In Milan, the coffin was displayed in the Alfa Romeo building, where throngs of people filed past. Thousands lined the route of the funeral procession to the Cimitero Monumentale, where he was buried.

Ascari&#x27;s son, Alberto, who was seven at the time of Antonio&#x27;s death, also became a racing driver, and was two-time Formula One champion in 1952–53. He also died behind the wheel at age 36, and on the 26th of the month.

<text>Delage is a French luxury automobile and racecar company founded in 1905 by Louis Delâge in Levallois-Perret near Paris; it was acquired by Delahaye in 1935 and ceased operation in 1953.

On 7 November 2019, the association &quot;Les Amis de Delage&quot; created in 1956 and owner of the Delage brand, announced the re-founding of the company Delage Automobiles with the Delage D12.

==Early history==
The company was founded in 1905 by Louis Delâge, who borrowed Fr 35,000, giving up a salary of F 600 a month to do so.

Its first location was on the Rue Cormeilles in Levallois-Perret. The company at first had just two lathes and three employees, one of them Peugeot&#x27;s former chief designer. Delage initially produced parts for Helbé, with the De Dion-Bouton engine and chassis assembled by Helbé; Delage added only the body.

The first model was the Type A, a &quot;voiturette&quot; which appeared in 1906. It was powered by a one-cylinder De Dion-Bouton of . Like other early carmakers, Delage participated in motor racing, entering the &quot;Coupe de Voiturettes&quot; held at Rambouillet in November 1906 with a racer. Seven days of regularity trials decided the entrants, and one of the two Delage specials was wrecked in the rain on the fifth; nevertheless, Ménard, the other works driver, came second in the event, behind a Sizaire-Naudin.

In 1907, the factory moved to the Rue Baudin Levallois, where a workshop allowed it to grow. The two-cylinder Delages were no match for the competition this year at the &quot;Coupe des Voiturettes&quot;.

In 1908, the success enabled the development of the factory and entry into more Grand Prix races. That year, racing success returned: Delage won the &quot;Grand Prix des Voiturettes&quot; held 6 July. This event, six laps of the Dieppe Grand Prix circuit, saw 47 starters. Delage fielded three cars: a pair with () De Dion-Bouton twins, driven by Thomas and Lucas-Bonnard, and a radical () one-cylinder (built by Nemorin Causan) in the hands of Delage dealer Albert Guyot. Guyot won at an average , not needing to stop for fuel. All three Delages finished this time, Thomas the quickest of the two-cylinder cars, while the team also took home the regularity prize. These good results contributed to total sales exceeding 300 cars for the year.

Delage converted to four-cylinder engines in 1909, at first provided by De Dion and Edouard Ballot; shortly, the company were producing their own sidevalve fours, too.

After an increase in sales, the existing facilities were too small, so in 1910 the factory moved to a new facility at 138 &quot;Boulevard de Verdun&quot;, Courbevoie. The following year saw the creation of advanced bodywork. By 1912, 350 workers were producing over 1000 cars annually, and offered four- and six-cylinder sidevalve engines.

During the First World War, Delage produced munitions. Production of passenger cars virtually stopped, with the exception of some fabrication for the Army. But the Delage factories were running full support for the war effort.

When the war concluded, Delage moved away from small cars and made its reputation with larger cars. First up was the CO, with a () fixed-head sidevalve six producing 20 hp. The CO plans had been drawn up during the conflict; this was the first passenger car with front brakes. It was joined by the DO with a 3-liter four.

The 1920s were really the first &quot;Golden Age&quot; of Delage. The most famous were the DE and DI: 4 cylinders of about 2 liters and 11 hp. Delage also attempted to compete with Hispano-Suiza, with the GL of 30 hp and 5954 cc, with some success. After that came a new generation of six-cylinder cars, like the MD (3174 cc) and DR (2516 cc), the best-selling vehicle in the history of the brand, designed by engineer Gaultier.

Both the CO and DO were replaced in 1922. The CO became the CO2, which changed to an overhead valve twin-plug head, producing , while the DO was supplanted by the DE with a () sidevalve four and, unusual in a production car even in this era, four-wheel brakes. The CO2 completed the Paris-Nice run in 16 hours, an average of .

The next year, the new DI also switched to OHV with a () four, fitted with magneto ignition and thermosyphon cooling; all had four-speed gearboxes and Zenith carburettors. At the other end of the scale, the GL (&quot;Grand Luxe&quot;), also known as the 40/50, replaced the CO2, being fitted with a magneto-fired () overhead cam six.

In 1923, a hillclimb car with DI chassis, larger wheels and tires, and () CO block (with three Zenith carburetors) was produced. Delage scored successes at La Turbie and Mont Ventoux. This car was joined by a () V12, which broke the course record at the Gaillon hillclimb, with Thomas at the wheel. Thomas would set the land speed record at Arpajon in this car, at a speed of , in 1924. A 1925 car had a () six, again using the GL block, with four valves per cylinder and twin overhead cams. Driven by Divo, it broke the Mont Ventoux course record in its debut. The car was destroyed by fire at the Phoenix Park meet in 1934.

The 1924 and 1925 DIS, with a wheelbase, switched from Rolls-Royce-type locking wheel hubs to Rudge knock-ons, better cam, and bigger valves, while the 1925 and 1926 DISS on the same wheelbase. Some of the DISes were bodied by Kelsch. The DIS became the Series 6 in 1927, switching to coil ignition and water pump.

In 1926, Delage introduced the DM, with a () six, which made it emblematic of the era for the marque. The high-performance DMS had hotter cam, twin valve springs, and other improvements. A DR, with a choice of 2.2- and 2.5-liter sidevalve engines, also briefly appeared.

==Competition==

Delage entered the 1911 &quot;Coupe de l&#x27;Auto&quot; at Boulogne with a () four with two -diameter bellcrank-operated valves per cylinder controlled by camshafts in the crankcase. The five-speed gearbox gave a top speed of , and the four &quot;voiturette&quot;s each carried , as the factory planned for a no-stop race. Works driver Paul Bablot won, at an average , with a 1m 11s over Boillot&#x27;s Peugeot, followed home by Thomas in a second Delage; Delage also took the team prize.

Delage moved up to &quot;Grand Prix&quot; racing in 1912, with a Léon Michelat-designed car powered by a four-valve () four-cylinder of , coupled again to a five-speed gearbox and fitted this time with . Three cars were built for the Amiens Grand Prix, though only two, Bablot&#x27;s and Guyot&#x27;s, actually entered. On the day, Bablot&#x27;s Delage proved the fastest car in the field, turning in a lap at , but Guyot fell out of the lead with a puncture, and the race went to Peugeot, while the Delages were fourth and fifth. At the French &quot;Grand Prix&quot;, Delage put Bablot first, Guyot second, ahead of Pilette&#x27;s 1908 Mercedes GP car, Salzer in a Mercedes, with Duray coming in fifth in the third Delage.
In 1913, the new type Y set the fastest lap time at the French Grand Prix at Le Mans, and in 1914, this same car won the 1914 Indianapolis 500 with René Thomas at the wheel. Thomas, Guyot, and Duray returned to the French &quot;Grand Prix&quot; with 4½-liter twin-cam desmodromic valved racers featuring twin carburettors, five-speed gearbox, and four-wheel brakes. While quick, they proved unreliable; only one finished, Duray&#x27;s, in eighth.

In 1914, Delage emphasized its focus on competition by creating the type O Lyon Grand Prix, while at the same time moving towards the luxury car market with 6 cylinders of a large class. However, racing was severely curtailed during World War One.

In 1923, Louis Delage returned to competition with the innovative 12-cylinder 2-liter type 2 LCV. This car won the 1924 European Grand Prix in Lyon and the 1925 Grand Prix of ACF Montlhéry. The 12-cylinder DH (10.5 liters) of 1924 beat the world speed record on the highway, at . A Delage 155 B won the first Grand Prix of Great-Britain in 1926, driven by Louis Wagner and Robert Senechal. The production of cars continued with the DI and the DI S SS. The DM evolved into the DMS and DML, equipped with a 6-cylinder 3-liter engine designed by Maurice Gaultier.

Delage&#x27;s Grand Prix effort saw a Plancton-designed () four overhead cam V12. The car, driven by Thomas, fell out of the French Grand Prix in 1923, but went on to perform well for the bulk of the 1923 and 1924 season. With supercharger added in 1925, bringing output to , it won at Montlhéry and Lasarte, proving as fast as the Alfa Romeo P2, but rarely racing it directly.
 This car was supplanted in 1926 by a Lory-designed supercharged 1.5-liter twincam straight eight of ; capable of , it was the company&#x27;s last Grand Prix entrant.

Always passionate about racing, Louis Delage designed an 8-cylinder 1500 cc, the type 15 S 8. This car won four European Grands Prix races in 1927, and won Delage the title &quot;World Champion of Car Builders&quot; that same year.

A -powered D6 won the 1938 Tourist Trophy at Donington Park and came second at Le Mans. A single V12-powered car, intended for Le Mans, caught fire at the 1938 International Trophy at Brooklands.

Postwar, the best results Delage had were seconds at the 1949 Le Mans and 1950 Paris &quot;Grand Prix&quot;.

==The D6 and the D8: The Classic Era==
1930 saw the launch of the 6-cylinder Delage D6 which would form the mainstay of the manufacturer&#x27;s passenger car range until 1954.
For 1930 Maurice Gaultier designed an 8-cylinder in-line 4,061 cc, evolving the type D8 into the type D8 S (S for Sport).

The D8 was the pinnacle of the marque. It was offered in three wheelbases, &quot;S&quot; or &quot;C&quot; at , &quot;N&quot; at , and &quot;L&quot; at , all powered by a () straight eight, making it capable of . Delage followed in 1932 with the Grand Sport, on a in 1934) wheelbase, capable of .

But the backlash of the economic crisis of 1929 arrived and manufacturers of luxury cars all over the world suffered from poor sales. The commercial and financial situation of the firm was badly shaken. In 1932 Delage introduced the type D6-11 (6-cylinder 2101 cc), and two years later the new eight-cylinder Delage, type D8-15 (2768 cc). These two models, equipped with independent front wheel suspension did not increase sale figures. The transverse leaf and wishbone independent front suspension was licensed by Studebaker for their cars. Delage also produced a very limited number of higher-performance D6-11S models during 1933 and 1934. These &quot;S&quot; models (&quot;S&quot; being an abbreviation for Surbaisse, which means &quot;lowered&quot; in French) were built on a lowered and shorter chassis. 

The junior D6s shared Delahaye front suspension design, but had hydraulic rather than Delahaye cable-actuated brakes, also shared the Cotal gearbox with the D8. The D6/70 of 1936 was powered by a () six, the 1938 D6/75 a 2.8-liter six, and the postwar D8/3L Olympic a 3-liter six. At the bottom of the range was a 1.5-liter four that lasted until 1936.

Financial pressures never disappeared, however, and during the spring of 1932 Louis Delage was obliged to take out a 25 Million franc loan in order to finance the tooling needed to put the D6 into production. It was at this time that he also entered into negotiations with Peugeot about using their dealership and service network. These negotiations went nowhere, and discussions with other possible partners/rescuers also came to nothing. There were also personal problems involving his marriage which necessitated a rearrangement of Delage&#x27;s personal finances, although in the event it was the sale of his expensive home in the Champs-Élysées that reduced the pressure on his finances if only in the short term.

The last models to emerge from the factory in Courbevoie were the types D6-65, D8-85 and D8-105, designed by engineer Michelat. On 20 April 1935 the factory in Courbevoie went into voluntary liquidation.

But Louis Delage would not admit defeat, and with the help of a businessman called Walter Watney created the Société Nouvelle des Automobiles Delage (SAFAD), to market Delage cars, assembled from production Delahayes. This union created the 4-cylinder DI 12 and the D8 120, and also the 6-cylinder D6 70. Watney had taken control as president of SAFAD, but he was a British national and in June 1940 he was obliged to leave Paris as the German Army arrived. Watney stayed in France, at his villa in Beaulieu, until the end of 1942 after the Germans had completed their occupation, but already in December 1940 the presidency of the SAFAD business had passed directly into the control of Delahaye. In any event, since the outbreak of the war Delage had been largely inactive, although they did undertake work on a project to replace the six-cylinder engine of the Hotchkiss H39 tank with the more powerful 8-cylinder unit from the Delage D8 120.

==Racing aero-engines==
Delage produced at least two types of racing aero-engine during the early 1930s. The Delage 12 CED was fitted to the Kellner-Béchereau 28VD racing aircraft, intended to compete in the 1933 Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe air race. Unfortunately the aircraft crashed during qualification trials for the race on 12 May 1933. The second engine type, the Delage 12 GV, remains a mystery, with very little information available.

==After the Second World War==
A large prototype Delage D-180 limousine appeared at the 1946 Paris Motor Show, but there were evidently no further developments on this project, and by the next year the big prototype had quietly disappeared. At the 1947 Paris Motor Show only a single model was exhibited as the business focused on its six-cylinder 3-litre Delage D6 which in most respects will have been familiar to anyone who had known the 3-litre Delages of the 1930s. The car was offered with bodies by firms such as Chapron, Letourner &amp; Marchand and Guilloré. A variety of coupe and cabriolet bodied D6s were produced. In addition, both Guilloré and Chapron produced a large saloon/sedan body. The two were remarkably similar, both being six-light four-door cars with conservative 1930s style shapes. Something else the two had in common was unexpectedly narrow rear doors, enforced by the combination of a long body, a long rear overhang and a relatively short wheelbase provided by the D6 chassis. A longer wheelbase 1952 special version, bodied by Guilloré, was owned by National Assembly president Édouard Herriot.

Nevertheless, these were difficult times for luxury auto-makers in France and by now the company&#x27;s registered head office was the same as that for Delahaye: production statistics from the period group Delage and Delahaye together. Louis Delâge himself, who had lived in poverty and quasi-monastic isolation since bankruptcy in 1935 had enforced the transfer of his company to Delahaye, died in December 1947, and during the next few years any residual autonomy that the business had enjoyed disappeared. Increases in motoring taxes, most notably in 1948 and most savagely targeting cars with engines of above 2 litres, combined with the depressed economic conditions of post-war France to create a difficult market for luxury car manufacturers. In 1950 Delahaye produced 235 cars which will have included a significant number of Delages. In 1951 the combined production figure for the two brands slumped to 77: in 1952 it was down to 41. In 1953 Delage production ended.

Delage was absorbed into Hotchkiss along with Delahaye in 1954, and car manufacturing ended.

=== Refoundation ===

On 7 November 2019, at the Lyon Époqu&#x27;auto show, Les Amis de Delage and entrepreneur Laurent Tapie, son of Bernard Tapie, announced that they had signed an agreement for relaunch the Delage Automobiles brand. Tapie becomes president of Delage Automobiles. The new Delage planned for this project is called the Delage D12. It is a hybrid street-legal Hypercar powered by a normally aspirated V12 engine of , coupled to an electric motor of , for a cumulative power of . It will be produced in France like all Delages. Delage Automobiles has joined forces with racing driver Jacques Villeneuve as the development driver for the future production model. The car was presented at private events in Los Angeles and Orange County in California in December 2019, then in Monaco in September 2020, Geneva in November 2020 and Dubai in December 2020.

Voted &quot;most beautiful car in the world&quot; (best Design) by the jury of the Automobile Awards 2020/2021, only 30 units of the Delage D12 will be produced and sold at a price tag of 2 million Euros per car.

==Production volumes==
During their years of independence, Delage made almost 40,000 cars at their workshops in Levallois and Courbevoie. After Delage production was subsumed into the Delahaye operation, approximately another 2,000 Delage badged cars were manufactured between 1935 and 1940. With the post-war resumption of passenger car production, 330 Delage cars appear to have been produced by Delahaye between 1946 and 1953.

<text>The Tripoli Grand Prix (Italian: &quot;Gran Premio di Tripoli&quot;) was a motor racing event first held in 1925 on a racing circuit outside Tripoli, the capital of what was then Italian Tripolitania, now Libya. It lasted until 1940.

==Background==

Motor racing was an extremely popular sport in Italy and the colony was seeking methods to raise capital and promote tourism—tourists who, it was hoped, would then decide to settle in Tripolitania. But despite the support of the colony&#x27;s extremely enthusiastic governor, General Emilio de Bono, and some initial success, the events failed financially. Only personal intervention by General de Bono kept the 1929 event from being cancelled, and 1930 was marred by a spartan field, little public interest, and the death of Gastone Brilli-Peri in an accident. Initial enthusiasm and sponsorship had retreated, the fallout from Brilli-Peri&#x27;s accident meant a 1931 running was impossible, and the dream of a successful Tripoli Grand Prix might have ended there and then.

But the president of Tripoli&#x27;s auto club, Egidio Sforzini, was resilient. He decided to organize another Grand Prix, this time on a purpose built European style racing circuit. Sufficient capital was raised from the Italian government&#x27;s funding of a fair promoting the colony so as to make the venture possible, and upon the circuit&#x27;s completion the Grand Prix was scheduled for the spring of 1933.

This new Mellaha Lake track was a 13.140 kilometer (8.165 mi) long affair situated in a salt basin between Tripoli, Suq al Jum&#x27;ah (also known as Suk el Giuma or Sugh el Giumaa (سوق الجمعة)) and Tajura and around the Mellaha Air Base. The track&#x27;s most distinctive landmark was a brilliant white concrete tower situated across from a large frontstretch grandstand that could hold up to ten thousand people. Mellaha Lake was equipped with starting lights, an innovation, and the additional amenities rivaled the best that continental European circuits had to offer.
With Italy exerting further control over its North African holdings, including the appointment of Marshal of the Air Force Italo Balbo as Governor-General and the joining of Italian Cyrenaica and Italian Tripolitania into a single colony, Libya, the event gained even more spectacle. The participants were treated like royalty, staying in luxury at the Hotel Uaddan with its casino and dinner theater and being entertained by Marshal Balbo at his palace. All this led driver Dick Seaman to describe Mellaha Lake as the &quot;Ascot of motor racing circuits&quot;, and coupled with its substantial total prize, it is easy to see why the Tripoli Grand Prix became such a popular date on the calendar.

From 1933 to 1938, the Grand Prix was run to the &quot;Formula Libre&quot; standard, meaning that no weight or engine restrictions were enforced on what was then the fastest track in the world. In 1939 the Italians, tired of Germany&#x27;s dominance, turned it into a &quot;Voiturette&quot; race for smaller, 1500cc cars, but even so a specially-built Mercedes driven by Hermann Lang won. In 1940, with only the factory Alfa Romeo and Maserati teams plus some independents in attendance, Giuseppe Farina took his only major pre-war victory. It was a last and pyrrhic result for the Italians, because the Tripoli Grand Prix was never held again with the onset of World War II.

===1933 – Accusation of corruption ===
The Grand Prix was held in conjunction with the Libyan state lottery and, in the case of the inaugural Mellaha Lake event, there have long been accusations of result fixing. From October 1932 to 16 April 1933, the government sold 12 lire lottery tickets and, after taking their cut, they put up the rest as the prize for a special lottery based on the outcome of the race. Thirty attendance tickets were drawn at random eight days before the event and assigned to a corresponding race entry. The holder of the winner&#x27;s entry would receive three million lire, second place two million, and third one million. The story, first publicized in Alfred Neubauer&#x27;s 1958 book &quot;Speed Was My Life (Männer, Frauen und Motoren: Die Erinnerungen des Mercedes-Rennleiters)&quot;, alleged that Tazio Nuvolari, Achille Varzi and Baconin Borzacchini, along with their respective ticket holders, conspired to decide the outcome of the race in order to split some seven and a half million lire together. Research suggests that the story is a popular myth.
