<text>The story of Dhu al-Qarnayn (in Arabic ذو القرنين, literally &quot;The Two-Horned One&quot;; also transliterated as Zul-Qarnain or Zulqarnain), is mentioned in Surah al-Kahf of the Quran.

It has long been recognised in modern scholarship that the story of Dhu al-Qarnayn has strong similarities with the Syriac Legend of Alexander the Great. According to this legend, Alexander travelled to the ends of the world then built a wall in the Caucasus mountains to keep Gog and Magog out of civilized lands (the latter element is found several centuries earlier in the works of Flavius Josephus). Several argue that the form of this narrative in the Syriac &quot;Alexander Legend&quot; (known as the Neṣḥānā) dates to between 629 and 636 CE and so is not the source for the Quranic narrative based on the view held by many Western and Muslim scholars that Surah 18 belongs to the second Meccan Period (615–619). The Syriac Legend of Alexander has however received a range of dates by different scholars, from a latest date of 630 (close to Muhammad&#x27;s death) to an earlier version inferred to have existed in the 6th century CE. Sidney H. Griffith argues that the simple storyline found in the Syriac &quot;Alexander Legend&quot; (and the slightly later &quot;metrical homily&quot; or Alexander poem) &quot;would most likely have been current orally well before the composition of either of the Syriac texts in writing&quot; and it is possible that it was this orally circulating version of the account which was recollected in the Islamic milieu. The majority of modern researchers of the Quran as well as Islamic commentators identify Dhu al-Qarnayn as Alexander the Great.

==The legendary Alexander==
===Alexander in legend and romance===
Alexander the Great was an immensely popular figure in the classical and post-classical cultures of the Mediterranean and Middle East. Almost immediately after his death in 323 BC a body of legend began to accumulate about his exploits and life which, over the centuries, became increasingly fantastic as well as allegorical. Collectively this tradition is called the &quot;Alexander romance&quot; and some recensions feature such vivid episodes as Alexander ascending through the air to Paradise, journeying to the bottom of the sea in a glass bubble, and journeying through the Land of Darkness in search of the Water of Life (Fountain of Youth).

The earliest Greek manuscripts of the &quot;Alexander romance&quot;, as they have survived, indicate that it was composed at Alexandria in the 3rd century. The original text was lost but was the source of some eighty different versions written in twenty-four different languages. As the &quot;Alexander romance&quot; persisted in popularity over the centuries, it was assumed by various neighbouring people. Of particular significance was its incorporation into Jewish and later Christian legendary traditions. In the Jewish tradition Alexander was initially a figure of satire, representing the vain or covetous ruler who is ignorant of larger spiritual truths. Yet their belief in a just, all-powerful God forced Jewish interpreters of the Alexander tradition to come to terms with Alexander&#x27;s undeniable temporal success. Why would a just, all-powerful God show such favour to an unrighteous ruler? This theological need, plus acculturation to Hellenism, led to a more positive Jewish interpretation of the Alexander legacy. In its most neutral form this was typified by having Alexander show deference to either the Jewish people or the symbols of their faith. In having the great conqueror thus acknowledge the essential truth of the Jews&#x27; religious, intellectual, or ethical traditions, the prestige of Alexander was harnessed to the cause of Jewish ethnocentrism. Eventually Jewish writers would almost completely co-opt Alexander, depicting him as a righteous gentile or even a believing monotheist.

The Christianized peoples of the Near East, inheritors of both the Hellenic as well as Judaic strands of the &quot;Alexander romance&quot;, further theologized Alexander until in some stories he was depicted as a saint. The Christian legends turned the ancient Greek conqueror Alexander III into Alexander &quot;the Believing King&quot;, implying that he was a believer in monotheism. Eventually elements of the &quot;Alexander romance&quot; were combined with Biblical legends such as Gog and Magog.

During the period of history during which the &quot;Alexander romance&quot; was written, little was known about the true historical Alexander the Great as most of the history of his conquests had been preserved in the form of folklore and legends. It was not until the Renaissance (1300–1600 AD) that the true history of Alexander III was rediscovered:

Since the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC there has been no age in history, whether in the West or in the East, in which his name and exploits have not been familiar. And yet not only have all contemporary records been lost but even the work based on those records though written some four and a half centuries after his death, the &quot;Anabasis&quot; of Arrian, was totally unknown to the writers of the Middle Ages and became available to Western scholarship only with the Revival of Learning [the Renaissance]. The perpetuation of Alexander&#x27;s fame through so many ages and amongst so many peoples is due in the main to the innumerable recensions and transmogrifications of a work known as the &quot;Alexander Romance&quot; or &quot;Pseudo-Callisthenes&quot;.

===Dating and origins of the Alexander legends===

The legendary Alexander material originated as early as the time of the Ptolemaic dynasty (305 BC to 30 BC) and its unknown authors are sometimes referred to as the &quot;Pseudo-Callisthenes&quot; (not to be confused with Callisthenes of Olynthus, who was Alexander&#x27;s official historian). The earliest surviving manuscript of the &quot;Alexander romance&quot;, called the α (alpha) recension, can be dated to the 3rd century AD and was written in Greek in Alexandria:

There have been many theories regarding the date and sources of this curious work [the &quot;Alexander romance&quot;]. According to the most recent authority, ... it was compiled by a Greco-Egyptian writing in Alexandria about A.D. 300. The sources on which the anonymous author drew were twofold. On the one hand he made use of a `romanticized history of Alexander of a highly rhetorical type depending on the Cleitarchus tradition, and with this he amalgamated a collection of imaginary letters derived from an &quot;Epistolary Romance of Alexander&quot; written in the first century B.C. He also included two long letters from Alexander to his mother Olympias and his tutor Aristotle describing his marvellous adventures in India and at the end of the World. These are the literary expression of a living popular tradition and as such are the most remarkable and interesting part of the work

The Greek variants of the &quot;Alexander romance&quot; continued to evolve until, in the 4th century, the Greek legend was translated into Latin by Julius Valerius Alexander Polemius (where it is called the &quot;Res gestae Alexandri Magni&quot;) and from Latin it spread to all major vernacular languages of Europe in the Middle Ages. Around the same as its translation into Latin, the Greek text was also translated into the Syriac language and from Syriac it spread to eastern cultures and languages as far afield as China and Southeast Asia. The Syriac legend was the source of an Arabic variant called the &quot;Qisas Dhul-Qarnayn&quot; (&quot;Tales of Dhul-Qarnayn&quot;) and a Persian variant called the (&quot;Book of Alexander&quot;), as well as Armenian and Ethiopic translations.

The Syriac manuscripts of the &quot;Alexander Romance&quot; contain evidence of lost texts. For example, there is some evidence of a lost pre-Islamic Arabic version of the translation that is thought to have been an intermediary between the Syriac Christian and the Ethiopic Christian translations. There is also evidence that the Syriac translation was not directly based on the Greek recensions but was based on a lost Middle Persian or (Neo-Persian) intermediary.

====The Syriac Legend====
The version recorded in Syriac is of particular importance because it was current in the Middle East during the time of the Quran&#x27;s writing and is regarded as being closely related to the literary and linguistic origins of the story of Dhul-Qarnayn in the Quran. The Syriac version of the &quot;Alexander Romance&quot; (or &quot;Pseudo-Callisthenes&quot;), as it has survived, consists of six distinct manuscripts, each including separately a Syriac Christian religious legend concerning Alexander in prose text called the Neṣḥānā d-Aleksandrōs or &quot;Exploits of Alexander&quot;, often referred to simply as the &quot;Syriac Legend&quot; or &quot;Syriac Christian Legend&quot;, and based on it, a sermon known as the metrical homily (mēmrā), or Alexander song or poem ascribed to the Syriac poet-theologian Jacob of Serugh (451–521 AD, also called Mar Jacob), which according to Reinink was actually composed around 629–636. The &quot;Syriac Legend&quot; appears in each of the six manuscripts containing the Syriac version of the &quot;Alexander Romance&quot; A key manuscript witness is British Library Add. 25875 (copied 1708–1709), which is the oldest and one of the five used by E.A.W. Budge, who used it as the base text for his critical edition of the Syriac text and English translation of the &quot;Legend&quot;. The slightly later &quot;Metrical Homily&quot; (mēmrā) survives in five manuscripts, the oldest of which was copied in the 9th century CE. The Syriac Legend concentrates on Alexander&#x27;s journey to the end of the World, where he constructs the &quot;Gates of Alexander&quot; to enclose the evil nations of &quot;Gog and Magog&quot;, while the Metrical Homily describes his journey to the &quot;Land of Darkness&quot; to discover the &quot;Water of Life&quot; (Fountain of Youth), as well as his enclosure of Gog and Magog. These legends concerning Alexander are remarkably similar to the story of Dhul-Qarnayn found in the Quran.

The Syriac Legend has been generally dated to between 629 AD and 636 AD. There is evidence in the legend of &quot;&quot;ex eventu&quot; knowledge of the Khazar invasion of Armenia in A.D. 629,&quot; which suggests that the legend must have been burdened with additions by a redactor sometime around 629 AD. The legend appears to have been composed as propaganda in support of Emperor Heraclius (575–641 AD) shortly after he defeated the Persians in the Byzantine-Sassanid War of 602–628. It is notable that this manuscript fails to mention the Islamic conquest of Jerusalem in 636 AD by Muhammad&#x27;s (570–632 AD) successor, Caliph Umar (590–644 AD). This fact means that the legend might have been recorded before the &quot;cataclysmic event&quot;` that was the Muslim conquest of Syria and the resulting surrender of Jerusalem in November 636 AD. That the Byzantine–Arab Wars would have been referenced in the legend, had it been written after 636 AD, is supported by the fact that in 692 AD a Syriac Christian adaption of the &quot;Alexander romance&quot; called the &quot;Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius&quot; was indeed written as a response to the Muslim invasions and was falsely attributed to St Methodius (?–311 AD); this &quot;Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius&quot; equated the evil nations of &quot;Gog and Magog&quot; with the Muslim invaders and shaped the eschatological imagination of Christendom for centuries. The Syriac Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius shows obvious borrowing from the Syriac Legend for its account concerning the barrier against Gog and Magog (especially its description of the Huns as chiefs of thirty escatalogical nations), while the Syriac Apocalypse of Pseudo-Ephrem (dated between 642 and 683 CE) shows borrowing from both the Syriac Legend and the Alexander Poem (i.e. the Metrical Homily).

One scholar (Kevin van Bladel) who finds striking similarities between the Quranic verses 18:83-102 and the Syriac legend in support of Emperor Heraclius, dates the work to 629-630 AD or before Muhammad&#x27;s death, not 629-636 AD. The Syriac legend matches many details in the five parts of the verses (Alexander being the two horned one, journey to edge of the world, punishment of evil doers, Gog and Magog, etc.) and also &quot;makes some sense of the cryptic Qur&#x27;anic story&quot; being 21 pages (in one edition) not 20 verses. (The sun sets in a fetid poisonous ocean—not spring—surrounding the earth, Gog and Magog are Huns, etc.) Van Bladel finds it more plausible that the Syriac legend is the source of the Quranic verses than vice versa, both for linguistic reasons as well as because the Syriac legend was written before the Arab conquests when the Hijazi Muslim community was still remote from and little known to the Mesopotamian site of the legend&#x27;s creation, whereas Arabs worked as troops and scouts for during the Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628 and could have been exposed to the legend.

Stephen Shoemaker, commenting on the views of Reinink, van Bladel, and Tesei, argues it more likely that most of the text of the current version of the legend existed in a sixth century version, given the stringent timings otherwise required for the legend to influence the Syriac metrical homily and Quranic versions, and the difficulty of otherwise explaining the presence of the first ex-eventu prophecy about the Sabir Hun invasion of 515 CE in the legend, which was already circulating as an apocalyptic revelation in John of Ephesus&#x27;s &quot;Lives of the Eastern Saints&quot; in the sixth century CE.

====Search for the water of life====
Besides the Dhul Qarnayn episode, Surah al-Kahf contains another story which has been connected with legends in the Alexander romance tradition. Tommaso Tesei notes that the story of Alexander&#x27;s search at the ends of the world for the water of life, featuring his cook and a fish, which appears in various forms in the Syriac metrical homily about Alexander mentioned above, recension β of the Alexander romance (4th/5th century) and in the Babylonian Talmud (Tamid 32a-32b), is &quot;almost unanimously&quot; considered by western scholars to be behind the story of Moses journeying to the junction of the two seas, his servant and the escaped fish earlier in Surah al-Kahf, verses 18:60–65. Besides the full English translation by E.A.W. Budge of both the Metrical Homily and the Syriac Legend, an English translation of the relevant part of the Metrical Homily is available in Gabriel Said Reynolds&#x27; commentary on the Quran.

==Philological evidence==
===The two-horned one===
The literal translation of the Arabic phrase &quot;Dhu al-Qarnayn,&quot; as written in the Quran, is &quot;the Two-Horned man.&quot; Alexander the Great was portrayed in his own time with horns following the iconography of the Egyptian god Ammon-Ra, who held the position of transcendental, self-created creator deity &quot;par excellence&quot;. Rams were a symbol of virility due to their rutting behaviour; the horns of Ammon may have also represented the East and West of the Earth, and one of the titles of Ammon was &quot;the two-horned.&quot; Alexander was depicted with the horns of Ammon as a result of his conquest of ancient Egypt in 332 BC, where the priesthood received him as the son of the god Ammon, who was identified by the ancient Greeks with Zeus, the King of the Gods. The combined deity Zeus-Ammon was a distinct figure in ancient Greek mythology. According to five historians of antiquity (Arrian, Curtius, Diodorus, Justin, and Plutarch), Alexander visited the Oracle of Ammon at Siwa in the Libyan desert and rumours spread that the Oracle had revealed Alexander&#x27;s father to be the deity Ammon, rather than Philip. Alexander is said by some to have been convinced of his own divinity:

He seems to have become convinced of the reality of his own divinity and to have required its acceptance by others ... The cities perforce complied, but often ironically: the Spartan decree read, &quot; &#x27;Since Alexander wishes to be a god, let him be a god.&#x27; &quot;

Ancient Greek coins, such as the coins minted by Alexander&#x27;s successor Lysimachus (360–281 BC), depict the ruler with the distinctive horns of Ammon on his head. Archaeologists have found a large number of different types of ancients coins depicting Alexander the Great with two horns. The 4th century BC silver &quot;tetradrachmon&quot; (&quot;four &quot;drachma&quot;&quot;) coin, depicting a deified Alexander with two horns, replaced the 5th century BC Athenian silver &quot;tetradrachmon&quot; (which depicted the goddess Athena) as the most widely used coin in the Greek world. After Alexander&#x27;s conquests, the &quot;drachma&quot; was used in many of the Hellenistic kingdoms in the Middle East, including the Ptolemaic kingdom in Alexandria. The Arabic unit of currency known as the &quot;dirham&quot;, known from pre-Islamic times up to the present day, inherited its name from the &quot;drachma&quot;. In the late 2nd century BC, silver coins depicting Alexander with ram horns were used as a principal coinage in Arabia and were issued by an Arab ruler by the name of Abi&#x27;el who ruled in the south-eastern region of the Arabian Peninsula.

In 2018, excavations led by Dr. Eleni Procopiou at Katalymata ton Plakoton, an Early Byzantine site within the Akrotiri Peninsula on Cyprus, discovered a 7th Century CE depiction of Alexander the Great with horns. Known as the &quot;Alexander-Heraclius Stele&quot;. Professor Sean Anthony regards it as significant, providing &quot;seventh-century Byzantine iconography of Alexander with two horns that is contemporary with the Qurʾan&quot;

In 1971, Ukrainian archeologist B.M. Mozolevskii discovered an ancient Scythian kurgan (burial mound) containing many treasures. The burial site was constructed in the 4th century BC near the city of Pokrov and is given the name &quot;Tovsta Mohyla&quot; (another name is &quot;Babyna Mogila&quot;). Amongst the artifacts excavated at this site were four silver gilded phalera (ancient Roman military medals). Two of the four medals are identical and depict the head of a bearded man with two horns, while the other two medals are also identical and depict the head of a clean-shaven man with two horns. According to a recent theory, the bearded figure with horns is actually Zeus-Ammon and the clean-shaved figure is none other than Alexander the Great.

Alexander has also been identified, since ancient times, with the horned figure in the Old Testament in the prophecy of Daniel 8 who overthrows the kings of Media and Persia. In the prophecy, Daniel has a vision of a ram with two long horns and verse 20 explains that &quot;The ram which thou sawest having two horns is the kings of Media and Persia&quot;:

Josephus [37–100 AD], in his &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; xi, 8, 5 tells of a visit that Alexander is purported to have made to Jerusalem, where he met the high priest Jaddua and the assembled Jews, and was shown the book of Daniel in which it was prophesied that some one of the Greeks would overthrow the empire of Persia. Alexander believed himself to be the one indicated, and was pleased. The pertinent passage in Daniel would seem to be VIII. 3–8 which tells of the overthrow of the two-horned ram by the one-horned goat, the one horn of the goat being broken in the encounter ...The interpretation of this is given further ... &quot;The ram which thou sawest that had the two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia. And the rough he-goat is the king of Greece.&quot; This identification is accepted by the church fathers ...

The Christian Syriac version of the &quot;Alexander romance,&quot; in the sermon by Jacob of Serugh, describes Alexander as having been given horns of iron by God. The legend describes Alexander (as a Christian king) bowing himself in prayer, saying:

O God ... I know in my mind that thou hast exalted me above all kings, and &quot;thou hast made me horns upon my head, wherewith I might thrust down the kingdoms of the world&quot;...I will magnify thy name, O Lord, forever ... And if the Messiah, who is the Son of God [Jesus], comes in my days, I and my troops will worship Him...

While the &quot;Syriac Legend&quot; references the horns of Alexander, it consistently refers to the hero by his Greek name, not using a variant epithet. The use of the Islamic epithet &quot;Dhu al-Qarnayn&quot;, the &quot;two-horned&quot;, first occurred in the Quran.

In Christian Alexander legends written in Ethiopic (an ancient South Semitic language) between the 14th and the 16th century, Alexander the Great is always explicitly referred to using the epithet the &quot;Two Horned.&quot; A passage from the Ethiopic Christian legend describes the Angel of the Lord calling Alexander by this name:

Then God, may He be blessed and exalted! put it into the heart of the Angel to call &quot;Alexander &#x27;Two-horned,&#x27; &quot; ... And Alexander said unto him, &#x27; &quot;Thou didst call me by the name Two-horned,&quot; but my name is Alexander ... and I thought that thou hadst cursed me by calling me by this name.&#x27; The angel spake unto him, saying, &#x27;O man, I did not curse thee by &quot;the name by which thou and the works that thou doest are known.&quot; Thou hast come unto me, and I praise thee because, from the east to the west, the whole earth hath been given unto thee ...&#x27;

References to Alexander&#x27;s supposed horns are found in literature ranging many different languages, regions and centuries:

The horns of Alexander ... have had a varied symbolism. They represent him as a god, as a son of a god, as a prophet and propagandist of the Most High, as something approaching the role of a messiah, and also as the champion of Allah. They represent him as a world conqueror, who subjugated the two horns or ends of the world, the lands of the rising and of the setting sun ...

For these reasons, among others, the Quran&#x27;s Arabic epithet &quot;Dhul-Qarnayn,&quot; literally meaning &quot;the two-horned one,&quot; is interpreted as a reference to Alexander the Great.

===Alexander&#x27;s Wall===
====Early accounts of Alexander&#x27;s Wall====
The building of gates in the Caucasus Mountains by Alexander to repel the barbarian peoples identified with Gog and Magog has ancient provenance and the wall is known as the Gates of Alexander or the Caspian Gates. The name Caspian Gates originally applied to the narrow region at the southeast corner of the Caspian Sea, through which Alexander actually marched in the pursuit of Bessus in 329 BC, although he did not stop to fortify it. It was transferred to the passes through the Caucasus, on the other side of the Caspian, by the more fanciful historians of Alexander. The Jewish historian Flavius Josephus (37–100 AD) mentions that:

...a nation of the Alans, whom we have previously mentioned elsewhere as being Scythians ... travelled through a passage which King Alexander [the Great] shut up with iron gates.

Josephus also records that the people of Magog, the Magogites, were synonymous with the Scythians. According to Andrew Runni Anderson, this merely indicates that the main elements of the story were already in place six centuries before the Quran&#x27;s revelation, not that the story itself was known in the cohesive form apparent in the Quranic account. Similarly, St. Jerome (347–420 AD), in his &quot;Letter 77&quot;, mentions that,

The hordes of the Huns had poured forth all the way from Maeotis (they had their haunts between the icy Tanais and the rude Massagetae, &quot;where the gates of Alexander keep back the wild peoples behind the Caucasus&quot;).

In his Commentary on Ezekiel (38:2), Jerome identifies the nations located beyond the Caucasus mountains and near Lake Maeotis as Gog and Magog. Thus the Gates of Alexander legend was combined with the legend of Gog and Magog from the Book of Revelation. It has been suggested that the incorporation of the Gog and Magog legend into the &quot;Alexander romance&quot; was prompted by the invasion of the Huns across the Caucasus mountains in 395 AD into Armenia and Syria.

====Alexander&#x27;s Wall in Christian legends====

Christian legends speak of the Caspian Gates (Gates of Alexander), also known as Alexander&#x27;s wall, built by Alexander the Great in the Caucasus mountains. Several variations of the legend can be found. In the story, Alexander the Great built a gate of iron between two mountains, at the end of the Earth, to prevent the armies of Gog and Magog from ravaging the plains. The Christian legend was written in Syria shortly before the Quran&#x27;s writing and closely parallels the story of Dhul-Qarnayn. The legend describes an apocryphal letter from Alexander to his mother, wherein he writes:

I petitioned the exalted Deity, and he heard my prayer. And the exalted Deity commanded the two mountains and they moved and approached each other to a distance of twelve ells, and there I made ... copper gates 12 ells broad, and 60 ells high, and smeared them over within and without with copper ... so that neither fire nor iron, nor any other means should be able to loosen the copper; ... Within these gates, I made another construction of stones ... And having done this I finished the construction by putting mixed tin and lead over the stones, and smearing ... over the whole, so that no one might be able to do anything against the gates. I called them the Caspian Gates. Twenty and two Kings did I shut up therein.

These pseudepigraphic letters from Alexander to his mother Olympias and his tutor Aristotle, describing his marvellous adventures at the end of the World, date back to the original Greek recension α written in the 4th century in Alexandria. The letters are &quot;the literary expression of a living popular tradition&quot; that had been evolving for at least three centuries before the Quran was written.

====Medieval accounts of Alexander&#x27;s Wall====
Several historical figures, both Muslim and Christian, searched for Alexander&#x27;s Gate and several different identifications were made with actual walls. During the Middle Ages, the Gates of Alexander story was included in travel literature such as the &quot;Travels of Marco Polo&quot; (1254–1324 AD) and the &quot;Travels of Sir John Mandeville&quot;. The &quot;Alexander romance&quot; identified the Gates of Alexander, variously, with the Pass of Dariel, the Pass of Derbent, the Great Wall of Gorgan and even the Great Wall of China. In the legend&#x27;s original form, Alexander&#x27;s Gates are located at the Pass of Dariel. In later versions of the Christian legends, dated to around the time of Emperor Heraclius (575–641 AD), the Gates are instead located in Derbent, a city situated on a narrow strip of land between the Caspian Sea and the Caucasus mountains, where an ancient Sassanid fortification was mistakenly identified with the wall built by Alexander. In the &quot;Travels of Marco Polo&quot;, the wall in Derbent is identified with the Gates of Alexander. The Gates of Alexander are most commonly identified with the Caspian Gates of Derbent whose thirty north-looking towers used to stretch for forty kilometres between the Caspian Sea and the Caucasus Mountains, effectively blocking the passage across the Caucasus. Later historians would regard these legends as false:

The gate itself had wandered from the Caspian Gates to the pass of Dariel, from the pass of Dariel to the pass of Derbend [Derbent], as well as to the far north; nay, it had travelled even as far as remote eastern or north-eastern Asia, gathering in strength and increasing in size as it went, and actually carrying the mountains of Caspia with it. Then, as the full light of modern day come on, the &quot;Alexander Romance&quot; ceased to be regarded as history, and with it Alexander&#x27;s Gate passed into the realm of fairyland.

In the Muslim world, several expeditions were undertaken to try to find and study Alexanders&#x27;s wall, specifically the Caspian Gates of Derbent. An early expedition to Derbent was ordered by the Caliph Umar (586–644 AD) himself, during the Arab conquest of Armenia where they heard about Alexander&#x27;s Wall in Derbent from the conquered Christian Armenians. Umar&#x27;s expedition was recorded by the renowned exegetes of the Quran, Al-Tabarani (873–970 AD) and Ibn Kathir (1301–1373 AD), and by the Muslim geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi (1179–1229 AD):

... Umar sent ... in 22 A.H. [643 AD] ... an expedition to Derbent [Russia] ... `Abdur Rahman bin Rabi`ah [was appointed] as the chief of his vanguard. When &#x27;Abdur Rehman entered Armenia, the ruler Shehrbaz surrendered without fighting. Then when `Abdur Rehman wanted to advance towards Derbent, Shehrbaz [ruler of Armenia] informed him that he had already gathered full information about the wall built by Dhul-Qarnain, through a man, who could supply all the necessary details ...

Two hundred years later, the Abbasid Caliph Al-Wathiq (?–847 AD) dispatched an expedition to study the wall of Dhul-Qarnain in Derbent, Russia. The expedition was led by Sallam-ul-Tarjuman, whose observations were recorded by Yaqut al-Hamawi and by Ibn Kathir:

...this expedition reached ... the Caspian territory. From there they arrived at Derbent and saw the wall [of Dhul-Qarnayn]. 

The Muslim geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi further confirmed the same view in a number of places in his book on geography; for instance under the heading &quot;Khazar&quot; (Caspian) he writes:

This territory adjoins the Wall of Dhul-Qarnain just behind Bab-ul-Abwab, which is also called Derbent.

The Caliph Harun al-Rashid (763 – 809 AD) even spent some time living in Derbent. Not all Muslim travellers and scholars, however, associated Dhul-Qarnayn&#x27;s wall with the Caspian Gates of Derbent. For example, the Muslim explorer Ibn Battuta (1304–1369 AD) travelled to China on order of the Sultan of Delhi, Muhammad bin Tughluq and he comments in his travel log that &quot;Between it [the city of Zaitun in Fujian] and the rampart of Yajuj and Majuj [Gog and Magog] is sixty days&#x27; travel.&quot; The translator of the travel log notes that Ibn Battuta confused the Great Wall of China with that supposedly built by Dhul-Qarnayn.

===Gog and Magog===
In the Quran, it is none other than the Gog and Magog people whom Dhul-Qarnayn has enclosed behind a wall, preventing them from invading the Earth. In Islamic eschatology, before the Day of Judgement Gog and Magog will destroy this gate, allowing them to ravage the Earth, as it is described in the Quran:

:Until, when Gog and Magog are let loose [from their barrier], and they swiftly swarm from every mound. And the true promise [Day of Resurrection] shall draw near [of fulfilment]. Then [when mankind is resurrected from their graves], you shall see the eyes of the disbelievers fixedly stare in horror. [They will say,] ‘Woe to us! We were indeed heedless of this; nay, but we were wrongdoers.’ (Quran 21:96–97. Note that the phrases in square brackets are not in the Arabic original.)

====Gog and Magog in Christian legends====
In the Syriac Christian legends, Alexander the Great encloses the Gog and Magog horde behind a mighty gate between two mountains, preventing Gog and Magog from invading the Earth. In addition, it is written in the Christian legend that in the end times God will cause the Gate of Gog and Magog to be destroyed, allowing the Gog and Magog horde to ravage the Earth;

The Lord spake by the hand of the angel, [saying] ...The gate of the north shall be opened on the day of the end of the world, and on that day shall evil go forth on the wicked ... The earth shall quake and this door [gate] which thou [Alexander] hast made be opened ... and anger with fierce wrath shall rise up on mankind and the earth ... shall be laid waste ... And the nations that is within this gate shall be roused up, and also the host of Agog and the peoples of Magog [Gog and Magog] shall be gathered together. These peoples, the fiercest of all creatures.

The Christian Syriac legend describes a flat Earth orbited by the sun and surrounded by the Paropamisadae (Hindu Kush) mountains. The Paropamisadae mountains are in turn surrounded by a narrow tract of land which is followed by a treacherous Ocean sea called Okeyanos. It is within this tract of land between the Paropamisadae mountains and Okeyanos that Alexander encloses Gog and Magog, so that they could not cross the mountains and invade the Earth. The legend describes &quot;the old wise men&quot; explaining this geography and cosmology of the Earth to Alexander, and then Alexander setting out to enclose Gog and Magog behind a mighty gate between a narrow passage at the end of the flat Earth:

The old men say, &quot;Look, my lord the king, and see a wonder, this mountain which God has set as a great boundary.&quot; King Alexander the son of Philip said, &quot;How far is the extent of this mountain?&quot; The old men say, &quot;Beyond India it extends in its appearance.&quot; The king said, &quot;How far does this side come?&quot; The old men say, &quot;Unto all the end of the earth.&quot; And wonder seized the great king at the council of the old men ... And he had it in his mind to make there a great gate. His mind was full of spiritual thoughts, while taking advice from the old men, the dwellers in the land. He looked at the mountain which encircled the whole world ... The king said, &quot;Where have the hosts [of Gog and Magog] come forth to plunder the land and all the world from of old?&quot; They show him a place in the middle of the mountains, a narrow pass which had been constructed by God ...

Flat Earth beliefs in the Early Christian Church varied and the Fathers of the Church shared different approaches. Those of them who were more close to Aristotle and Plato&#x27;s visions, like Origen, shared peacefully the belief in a spherical Earth. A second tradition, including St Basil and St Augustine, accepted the idea of the round Earth and the radial gravity, but in a critical way. In particular they pointed out a number of doubts about the antipodes and the physical reasons of the radial gravity. However, a flat Earth approach was more or less shared by all the Fathers coming from the Syriac area, who were more inclined to follow the letter of the Old Testament. Diodore of Tarsus (?–390 AD), Cosmas Indicopleustes (6th century), and Chrysostom (347–407 AD) belonged to this flat Earth tradition.

====Prophecy about the Sabir Huns invasion (514 CE)====

The first ex-eventu prophecy about Gog and Magog in the Syriac Christian Legend relates to the invasion of the Sabir Huns in 514-15 CE (immediately before the second ex-eventu prophecy about the Khazars discussed below). In a paper supporting van Bladel&#x27;s thesis on the direct dependency of the Dhu&#x27;l Qarnayn story on the Syriac Legend, Tommaso Tesei nevertheless highlights Károly Czeglédy&#x27;s identification that this first prophecy already had a 6th-century CE existence as an apocalytic revelation involving the arrival of the Huns in a passage of the Lives of the Eastern Saints by John of Ephesus (d. 586 ca.).

====Prophecy about the Khazars invasion (627 CE)====

In the Christian &quot;Alexander romance&quot; literature, Gog and Magog were sometimes associated with the Khazars, a Turkic people who lived near the Caspian Sea. The invasion of the Khazars around 627 CE appears in the Syriac Christian Legend as an ex-eventu prophecy involving the Huns (including Gog and Magog) passing through the gate and destroying the land, which gives the terminus post quem of 628 CE for its final redaction. In his 9th century work &quot;Expositio in Matthaeum Evangelistam&quot;, the Benedictine monk Christian of Stavelot refers to the Khazars as Hunnic descendants of Gog and Magog, and says they are &quot;circumcised and observing all [the laws of] Judaism&quot;; the Khazars were a Central Asian people with a long association with Judaism. A Georgian tradition, echoed in a chronicle, also identifies the Khazars with Gog and Magog, stating they are &quot;wild men with hideous faces and the manners of wild beasts, eaters of blood.&quot;

Early Muslim scholars writing about Dhul-Qarnayn also associated Gog and Magog with the Khazars. Ibn Kathir (1301–1373 CE), the famous commentator of the Quran, identified Gog and Magog with the Khazars who lived between the Black and Caspian Sea in his work &quot;Al-Bidayah wa al-Nihayah&quot; (&quot;The Beginning and the End&quot;). The Muslim explorer Ahmad ibn Fadlan, in his travelogue regarding his diplomatic mission in 921 AD to Volga Bulgars (a vassal of the Khazarian Empire), noted the beliefs about Gog and Magog being the ancestors of the Khazars.

Thus Muslim scholars associated the Khazars with Dhul-Qarnayn just as the Christian legends associated the Khazars with Alexander the Great.

===The rising place of the Sun===

A peculiar aspect of the story of Dhul-Qarnayn, in the Quran, is that it describes Dhul-Qarnayn travelling to &quot;the rising place of the Sun&quot; and the &quot;setting place of the Sun,&quot; where he saw the Sun sets into a murky (or boiling) spring of water (or mud). Dhul-Qarnayn also finds a people living by the &quot;rising place of the Sun,&quot; and finds that these people somehow have &quot;no shelter.&quot;

In his commentary of the Quran, Ibn Kathir (1301–1373 CE) explains that verse 18:89 is referring to the furthest point that could be travelled west:

(Until, when he reached the setting place of the sun,) means, he followed a route until &quot;he reached the furthest point that could be reached in the direction of the sun&#x27;s setting, which is the west of the earth.&quot; As for the idea of his reaching the place in the sky where the sun sets, this is something impossible, and the tales told by storytellers that he traveled so far to the west that the sun set behind him are not true at all. Most of these stories come from the myths of the People of the Book [Jews and Christians] and the fabrications and lies of their heretics.

In this commentary Ibn Kathir differentiates between the end of the Earth and the supposed &quot;place in the sky&quot; where the sun sets (the &quot;resting place&quot; of the sun). Ibn Kathir contends that Dhul-Qarnayn did reach the farthest place that could be travelled west but not the &quot;resting place&quot; of the sun and he goes on to mention that the People of the Book (Jews and Christians) tell myths about Dhul-Qarnayn travelling so far beyond the end of the Earth that the sun was &quot;behind him.&quot; This shows that Ibn Kathir was aware of the Christian legends and it suggests that Ibn Kathir considered Christian myths about Alexander to be referring to the same figure as the Dhul-Qarnayn mentioned in the Qu&#x27;an.

A similar theme is elaborated upon in several places in the Islamic hadith literature, in Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim:

It is narrated ... that the Messenger of God one day said: Do you know where the sun goes? They replied: God and His Apostle know best. He (the Holy Prophet) observed: Verily it (the sun) glides till it reaches its resting place under the Throne [of God]. Then it falls prostrate and remains there until it is asked: Rise up and go to the place whence you came, and it goes back and continues emerging out from its rising place...

The setting place of the sun is also commented on by Al-Tabari (838-923 AD) and Al-Qurtubi (1214–1273 AD) and, like Ibn Kathir, they showed some reservations towards the literal idea of the sun setting in a muddy spring but held to the basic theme of Dhul-Qarnayn reaching the ends of the Earth.

That the Earth must be spherical was known since at least the time of Pythagoras (570–495 BC), but this knowledge did not reach ancient folklore such as the &quot;Alexander romance&quot; where Alexander travels to the ends of a flat Earth. It is notable that, unlike the Babylonians, Greeks, and Indians, the pre-Islamic Arabs had no scientific astronomy. Their knowledge of astronomy was limited to measuring time based on empirical observations of the &quot;rising and setting&quot; of the sun, moon, and particular stars. This area of astronomical study was known as &quot;anwa&quot; and continued to be developed after Islamization by the Arabs. Astronomy in medieval Islam began in the 8th century and the first major Muslim work of astronomy was &quot;Zij al-Sindh&quot; written in 830 by al-Khwarizmi. The work is significant as it introduced the Ptolemaic system into Islamic sciences (the Ptolemaic system was ultimately replaced by the Copernican system during the Scientific Revolution in Europe).

====The rising place of the Sun in the Alexander legends====

So the whole camp mounted, and Alexander and his troops went up between the fetid sea and the bright sea to the place where the Sun enters the window of heaven; for the Sun is the servant of the Lord, and neither by night nor by day does he cease from his travelling. The place of his rising is over the sea, and the people who dwell there, when he is about to rise, flee away and hide themselves in the sea, that they be not burnt by his rays; and he passes through the midst of the heavens to the place where he enters the window of heaven; and wherever he passes there are terrible mountains, and those who dwell there have caves hollowed out in the rocks, and as soon as they see the Sun passing [over them], men and birds flee away from before him and hide in the caves, for rocks are rent by his blazing heat and fall down, and whether they be men or beasts, as soon as the stones touch them they are consumed. And when the Sun enters the window of heaven, he straight away bows down and makes obeisance before God his Creator; and he travels and descends the whole night through the heavens, until at length he finds himself where he rises.

The Christian legend is much more detailed than the Quran&#x27;s version and elaborates at length about the cosmology of the Earth that is implied by the story:

He [Alexander] said to them [the nobles]: &quot;This thought has arisen in my mind, and I am wondering what is the extent of the earth, and how high the heavens are ... and upon what the heavens are fixed ... Now this I desire to go and see, upon what the heavens rest, and what surrounds all creation.&quot; The nobles answered and said to the king, ... &quot;As to the thing, my lord, which thy majesty desires to go and see, namely, upon what the heaveans rest, and what surrounds the earth, the terrible seas which surround the world will not give thee a passage; because there are eleven bright seas, on which the ships of men sail, and beyond these there is about ten miles of dry land, and beyond these ten miles there is the foetid sea, Okeyanos (the Ocean), which surrounds all creation. Men are not able to come near to this foetid sea ... Its waters are like poison and if men swim therein, they die at once.&quot;

This ancient motif of a legendary figure travelling to the end of Earth is also found in the Epic of Gilgamesh, which can be dated to c. 2000 BC, making it one of the earliest known works of literary writing. In the epic poem, in tablet nine, Gilgamesh sets out on a quest for the Water of Life to seek immortality. Gilgamesh travels far to the east, to the mountain passes at the ends of the earth where he grapples and slays monstrous mountain lions, bears and others. Eventually he comes to the twin peaks of Mount Mashu at the end of the earth, from where the sun rises from the other world, the gate of which is guarded by two terrible scorpion-beings. They allow him to proceed through the gate after Gilgamesh convinces them to let him pass, stating his divinity and desperation, and he travels through the dark tunnel where the sun travels every night. Just before the sun is about to catch up with him, and with the North Wind and ice lashing him, he reaches the end. The world at the end of the tunnel is a bright wonderland full of trees with leaves of jewels. The 17th chapter of the apocryphal Book of Enoch describes a journey to the far west where the fire of the west receives every setting of the sun and a river of fire empties into the great western sea. Chapters 72–80 describe the risings and settings of the sun through 12 portals of heaven in the east and west. The myth of a flat Earth surrounded by an Ocean into which the sun sets is also found in the Iliad, the famous epic poem written by Homer and dated to c. 900 BC. The story of creation in the Hebrew Bible, in Genesis 1:10, (dated c. 900–550 BC) is also considered by scholars to be describing a flat Earth surrounded by a sea.

The ancient Greek historian Herodotus (484–425 BC) also gave an account of the eastern &quot;end of the Earth,&quot; in his descriptions of India. He reported that in India the sun&#x27;s heat is extremely intense in the morning, instead of noon being the hottest time of day. It has been argued that he based this on his belief that since India is located at the extreme east of a flat Earth, it would only be logical if the morning were unbearably hot due to the sun&#x27;s proximity.

===Alexander&#x27;s travels===
The Quran and the &quot;Alexander romance&quot; both have it that Dhul-Qarnayn (or Alexander) travelled a great deal. In the Quran&#x27;s story of Dhul-Qarnayn, &quot;God gave him unto every thing a road&quot; (or more literally, &quot;We gave him the means of everything&quot; 18:84) He travels as far as the ends of the Earth, to the place on the Earth where the Sun sets (the west) and the place on the Earth where the Sun rises (the east). The Quran portrays him travelling to the &quot;setting of the sun.&quot; Muslim interpretations of these verses are varied, but classical Muslim scholars seemed to have been of the opinion that Dhul-Qarnayn&#x27;s journey was real, not allegorical, and that Dhul-Qarnayn&#x27;s wall is also a real, physical wall somewhere on Earth.

In the Christian legends, Alexander travels to the places of the setting and rising of the Sun and this is meant to say that he travelled to the ends of the flat Earth and thus he had traversed the entire world. This legendary account served to convey the theme of Alexander&#x27;s exploits as a great conqueror. Alexander was indeed a great conqueror, having ruled the largest empire in ancient history by the time he was 25 years old. However, the true historical extent of Alexander&#x27;s travels are known to be greatly exaggerated in legends. For example, legend has it that upon reaching India,

... said Alexander &#x27;Truly, then, all the inhabited world is mine. West, north, east, south, there is nothing more for me to conquer.&#x27; Then he sat down and wept because there were not other worlds for him to conquer.

In reality, while Alexander did travel a great deal, he did not travel further west than ancient Libya and did not travel further east than the fringes of India. According to historians, Alexander invaded India following his desire to reach the &quot;ends of the world and the Great Outer Sea.&quot; However, when he reached the Hyphasis River in the Punjab in 326 BC, his army nearly mutinied and refused to march further east, exhausted by years of campaigning. Alexander&#x27;s desire to reach &quot;the ends of the Earth&quot; was instilled by his tutor Aristotle:

Alexander derived his concept of `Asia&#x27; from the teaching of Aristotle, for whom `the inhabited earth&#x27; was surrounded by `the Great sea&#x27; Ocean, and was divided into three areas – `Europe, Libya and Asia.&#x27; Thus the earth was not round but flat, and `Asia&#x27; was limited on the west by the Tanais (Don), the inland sea and the Nile, and on the east by `India&#x27; and `the Great Sea&#x27; ... he was mistaken in supposing that from the ridge of the Paropamisadae (Hindu Kush) one would see `the outer sea&#x27; and that `India&#x27; was a small peninsula running east into that sea.

This view of the world taught by Aristotle and followed by Alexander is apparent in Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Meteorologica&quot;, a treatise on earth sciences where he discusses the &quot;length&quot; and &quot;width&quot; of &quot;the inhabited earth.&quot; However, Aristotle knew that the Earth is spherical and even provided observational proof of this fact. Aristotle&#x27;s cosmological view was that the Earth is round but he prescribed to the notion of an &quot;inhabited Earth,&quot; surrounded by the Ocean, and an &quot;uninhabited Earth&quot; (though exactly how much of this was understood by his student Alexander the Great is not known).

==Arabic and Islamic depictions of Alexander the Great==

===Arabic traditions===
Alexander the Great features prominently in early Arabic literature. There are many surviving versions of the &quot;Alexander romance&quot; in Arabic that were written after the conquest of Islam. It is also thought that pre-Islamic Arabic versions of the &quot;Alexander romance&quot; may have existed.

Excavations in Eastern Arabia show that the ancient Arab dynasty &#x27;Abiel&#x27; minted coins portraying Alexander the Great with horns.

The earliest surviving Arabic narrative of the Alexander romance was composed by Umara ibn Zayd (767–815 AD). In the tale, Alexander the Great travels a great deal, builds the Wall against Gog and Magog, searches for the Water of Life (Fountain of Youth), and encounters angels who give him a &quot;wonder-stone&quot; that both weighs more than any other stone but is also as light as dust. This wonder-stone is meant to admonish Alexander for his ambitions and indicate that his lust for conquest and eternal life will not end until his death. The story of the wonder-stone is not found in the Syriac Christian legend, but is found in Jewish Talmudic traditions about Alexander as well as in Persian traditions.

A South Arabian Alexander legend was written by the Yemenite traditionist Wahb ibn Munabbih (?–732 AD) and this legend was later incorporated in a book by Ibn Hisham (?–833 AD) regarding the history of the Himyarite Kingdom in ancient Yemen. In the Yemenite variation, Dhul-Qarnayn is identified with an ancient king of Yemen named Tubba&#x27;, rather than Alexander the Great, but the Arabic story still describes the story of Alexander&#x27;s Wall against Gog and Magog and his quest for the Water of Life. The story also mentions that Dhul-Qarnayn (Tubba&#x27;) visited a castle with glass walls and visited the Brahmins of India. The South Arabian legend was composed within the context of the division between the South Arabs and North Arabs that began with the Battle of Marj Rahit in 684 AD and consolidated over two centuries.

The &quot;Alexander romance&quot; also had an important influence on Arabic wisdom literature. In &quot;Secretum Secretorum&quot; (&quot;Secret of Secrets&quot;, in Arabic &quot;Kitab sirr al-asrar&quot;), an encyclopedic Arabic treatise on a wide range of topics such as statecraft, ethics, physiognomy, alchemy, astrology, magic and medicine, Alexander appears as a speaker and subject of wise sayings and as a correspondent with figures such as Aristotle. The origins of the treatise are uncertain. No Greek original exists, though there are claims in the Arabic treatise that it was translated from the Greek into Syriac and from Syriac into Arabic by a well-known 9th century translator, Yahya ibn al-Bitriq (?–815 AD). It appears, however, that the treatise was actually composed originally in Arabic.

In another example of Arabic wisdom literature relating to Alexander, Ibn al-Nadim (?–997 AD) refers to a work on divination titled &quot;The Drawing of Lots by Dhul-Qarnain&quot; and to a second work on divination by arrows titled &quot;The gift of Alexander&quot;, but only the titles of these works have survived.

Notably, the Abbasid Caliph Al-Mu&#x27;tasim (794–842 AD) had ordered the translation of the &quot;Thesaurus Alexandri&quot;, a work on elixirs and amulets, from Greek and Latin into Arabic. The Greek work &quot;Thesaurus Alexandri&quot; was attributed to Hermes (the great messenger of the gods in Greek mythology) and similarly contained supposed letters from Aristotle addressed to Alexander.

A more direct Arabic translation of the &quot;Alexander romance,&quot; called &quot;Sirat Al-Iskandar&quot;, was discovered in Constantinople, at the Hagia Sophia, and is dated to the 13th century. In this version, Alexander the Great has a divine mission to convert the whole world to monotheism, and constructs the famous wall confining Gog and Magog before setting out for the Land of Darkness to find the Water of Life. This version also includes the letter from Alexander to his mother about his travels in India and at the end of the World. It also includes features which occur exclusively in the Syriac version. The Arabic legend also retains certain pagan elements of the story, which are sometimes modified to suit the Islamic message:

It is quite remarkable that some characteristics belonging to a pre-Islamic &#x27;pagan&#x27; entourage, have survived in the text ... For example, Alexander orders an offering of sacrificial animals at the temple of Hercules. In the Arabic letter the name of the deity has been replaced by &quot;Allah&quot; ... Another passage in the account of the palace of Shoshan or Sus, gives a description of the large silver jars, which were alleged to have capacity of three hundred and sixty measures of wine. Alexander puts this assertion to the test, having one of the jars filled with wine and poured out for his soldiers during a banquet. This exact specification has been maintained, heedless of the Islamic ban on the use of wine ... These retouched borrowings are highly significant in this text, because the Arabic Alexander figure is portrayed as a propagator of Islamic monotheism.
Another piece of Arabic Alexander literature is the &quot;Laments (or Sayings) of the Philosophers&quot;. These are a collection of remarks supposedly made by some philosophers gathered at the tomb of Alexander after his death. This legend was originally written in the 6th century in Syriac and was later translated into Arabic and expanded upon. The &quot;Laments of the Philosophers&quot; eventually gained enormous popularity in Europe:

[The &#x27;Sayings of the Philosophers&#x27; are] remarks of the philosophers gathered at the tomb of Alexander, who utter a series of apophthegms on the theme of the brevity of life and the transience of human achievement ... a work entitled &#x27;Sayings of the Philosophers&#x27; was first composed in Syriac in the sixth century; a longer Arabic version was composed by Hunayan Ibn Ishaq (809-973) the distinguished scholar-translator, and a still longer one by al-Mubashshir ibn Fatiq (who also wrote a book about Alexander) around 1053. Hunayan&#x27;s version was translated into Spanish ... in the late thirteenth century.

The Arabic &quot;Alexander romance&quot; also had an influence on a wider range of Arabic literature. It has been noted that some features of the Arabic Alexander legends found their way into &quot;The Seven Voyages of Sinbad the Sailor&quot;, a medieval story-cycle of Arabic origin. Sinbad, the hero of the epic, is a fictional sailor from Basrah, living during the Abbasid Caliphate. During his voyages throughout the seas east of Africa and south of Asia, he has fantastic adventures going to magical places, meeting monsters, and encountering supernatural phenomena. As a separate example of this influence on Arabic literature, the legend of Alexander&#x27;s search for the Water of Life is found in &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;, a collection of Middle Eastern and South Asian stories and folktales compiled in Arabic during the Islamic Golden Age.

===Andalusian traditions===
After the Umayyad Muslim conquest of Al-Andalus (Spain) in 711 AD, Muslim literature flourished under the Caliphate of Córdoba (929 to 1031 AD). An Arabic derivative of the &quot;Alexander romance&quot; was produced, called &quot;Qisas Dhul-Qarnayn&quot; (&quot;Tales of Dhul-Qarnayn&quot;). The material was later incorporated into &quot;Qisas Al-Anbiya&quot; (&quot;Tales of the Prophets&quot;):

By the turn of the first millennium C.E., the romance of Alexander in Arabic had a core centered on the Greek legendary material ... Interwoven later into this narrative in the &quot;Tales of the Prophets&quot; literature were episodes of an apparent Arab-Islamic elaboration: the construction of a great barrier to keep the people of Gog and Magog from harassing the people of the civilized world until Judgement Day, the voyage to the end of the Earth to witness the sun set in a pool of boiling mud, and Dhu al-Qarnayn&#x27;s expedition into the Land of Darkness in search of the Fountain of Life accompanied by his companion Khidir (&quot;the Green-One&quot;).

By 1236 AD, the Reconquista was essentially completed and Europeans had retaken the Iberian peninsula from the Muslims, but the Emirate of Granada, a small Muslim vassal of the Christian Kingdom of Castile, remained in Spain until 1492 AD. During the Reconquista, Muslims were forced to either convert to Catholicism or leave the peninsula. The descendants of Muslims who converted to Christianity were called the Moriscos (meaning &quot;Moor-like&quot;) and were suspecting of secretly practicing Islam. The Moriscos used a language called Aljamiado, which was a dialect of the Spanish language (Mozarabic) but was written using the Arabic alphabet. Aljamiado played a very important role in preserving Islam and the Arabic language in the life of the Moriscos; prayers and the sayings of Muhammad were translated into Aljamiado transcriptions of the Spanish language, while keeping all Quranic verses in the original Arabic. During this period, a version of the Alexander legend was written in the Aljamaido language, building on the Arabic &quot;Qisas Dhul-Qarnayn&quot; legends as well as Romance language versions of the &quot;Alexander romance&quot;.

===New Persian traditions===
With the Muslim conquest of Persia in 644 AD, the &quot;Alexander romance&quot; found its way into Persian literature—an ironic outcome considering pre-Islamic Persia&#x27;s hostility towards the national enemy who conquered the Achaemenid Empire and was directly responsible for Persian domination by Hellenistic foreign rulers. However, he is not depicted as a warrior and conqueror, but as a seeker of truth who eventually finds the &quot;Ab-i Hayat&quot; (Water of Life). Islamic Persian accounts of the Alexander legend, known as the &quot;Iskandarnamah&quot;, combined the &quot;Pseudo-Callisthenes&quot; material about Alexander, some of which is found in the Quran, with indigenous Sassanid Middle Persian ideas about Alexander. For example, Pseudo-Callisthenes is the source of many incidents in the &quot;Shahnama&quot; written by Ferdowsi (935–1020 AD) in New Persian. Persian sources on the Alexander legend devised a mythical genealogy for him whereby his mother was a concubine of Darius II, making him the half-brother of the last Achaemenid shah, Darius. By the 12th century such important Persian writers as Nizami Ganjavi (from Ganja in modern-day Republic of Azerbaijan) were making him the subject of their epic poems. The Muslim traditions also elaborated the legend that Alexander the Great had been the companion of Aristotle and the direct student of Plato.

There is also evidence that the Syriac translation of the &quot;Alexander romance&quot;, dating to the 6th century, was not directly based on the Greek recensions but was based on a lost Pahlavi (pre-Islamic Persian) manuscript.

===Central Asian traditions===

Certain Muslim people of Central Asia, specifically Bulgar, Tatar and Bashkir peoples of the Volga-Ural region (within what is today Tatarstan in the Russian Federation), carried on a rich tradition of the Alexander legend well into the 19th century. The region was conquered by the Abbasid Caliphate in the early 10th century. In these legends, Alexander is referred to as &quot;Iskandar Dhul-Qarnayn&quot; (Alexander the Two Horned), and is &quot;depicted as founder of local cities and an ancestor of local figures.&quot; The local folklore about &quot;Iskandar Dhul-Qarnayn&quot; played in an important role in communal identity:

The conversion of the Volga Bulghars to Islam is commonly dated to the first decades of the 10th century, and by the middle of the 12th century, it is apparent that Islamic historical figures and Islamic forms of communal validation had become important factors for Bulghar communal and political cohesion. The Andalusian traveler Abū Hamid al-Gharnāti who visited Bulghar in the 1150s, noted that Iskandar Dhūl-Qarnayn passed through Bulghar, that is, the Volga-Kama region, on his way to build the iron walls that contained Yā&#x27;jūj and Mā&#x27;jūj [Gog and Magog] within the land of darkness ... while Najib al-Hamadāni reports that the rulers of Bulghar claimed descent from Iskandar Dhūl-Qarnayn.

The &quot;Iskandar Dhul-Qanryan&quot; legends played an important role in the conversion narrative of the Volga Bulgar Muslims:

There are numerous digressions dealing with the founding of the Bulghar conversion narrative, and legends concerning Iskandar Dhūl-Qarnayn [Alexander Dhul-Qarnayn] and Socrates. According to the account, Socrates was born a Christian in Samarqand and went to Greece to serve Iskandar Dhūl-Qarnayn (Iskandar Rūmi). Together, they went to the Land of Darkness (diyār-i zulmat) to seek the Fountain of Youth (āb-i hayāt). In the northern lands they built a city and called it Bulghar. 

In 1577 AD the Tsardom of Russia annexed control of the region and Bulgar Muslim writings concerning Dhul-Qarnayn do not appear again until the 18th and 19th centuries, which saw a resurgence of local &quot;Iskandar Dhul-Qarnayn&quot; legends as a source of Muslim and ethnic identity:

It was only at the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries that we begin to see historical legends concerning Iskandar Dhūl-Qarnayn reemerge among Volga-Kama Muslims, at least in written form, and it was not until the 19th century that such legends were recorded from local Muslim oral tradition. In one of his earliest historical works, entitled Ghilālat al-Zamān and written in 1877 the Tatar theologian, Shihāb al-Dīn Marjānī wrote that according to Arabic and other Muslim writings, as well as according to popular legends, the city of Bulghar was founded by Alexander the Great. 

===Southeast Asian traditions===

The Malay world has had numerous stories of Alexander the Great, in which he is known as “Iskandar Zulkarnain”. His task was to conquer the world and propagate the faith of Abraham, who is considered a prophet in Islam. Various Malay sultans claimed to be descendants of Alexander the Great and were named after him.

== Orientalist and western views ==

In the 19th century, Orientalists studying the Quran began researching the identity of Dhul-Qarnayn. Theodor Nöldeke, believed that Dhul-Qarnayn was none other than Alexander the Great as mentioned in versions of the &quot;Alexander romance&quot; and related literature in Syriac (a dialect of Middle Aramaic). The Syriac manuscripts were translated into English in 1889 by E. A. Wallis Budge.

In the early 20th century Andrew Runni Anderson wrote a series of articles on the question in the &quot;Transactions of the American Philological Association&quot;. The findings of the philologists imply that the source of the Quran&#x27;s story of Dhul-Qarnayn is the &quot;Alexander romance&quot;, a thoroughly embellished compilation of Alexander&#x27;s exploits from Hellenistic and early Christian sources, which underwent numerous expansions and revisions for two-thousand years, throughout Antiquity and the Middle Ages.

As can be seen in the following quotation from Edwards, secular philologists studying ancient Syriac Christian legends about Alexander the Great also came to the conclusion that Dhul-Qarnayn is an ancient epithet for Alexander the Great. Edwards says, Alexander&#x27;s association with two horns and with the building of the gate against Gog and Magog occurs much earlier than the Quran and persists in the beliefs of all three of these religions [Judaism, Christianity and Islam]. The denial of Alexander&#x27;s identity as Dhul-Qarnain is the denial of a common heritage shared by the cultures which shape the modern world—both in the east and the west. The popularity of the legend of Alexander the Great proves that these cultures share a history which suggests that perhaps they are not so different after all.Although modern academics have found that the oldest Alexander romance does not contain the episode where Alexander build the gates against Gog and Magog,The Syriac tradition is one of the most interesting versions of the many existing oriental redactions of the Romance. It dates from the 7th century and goes back on a quite similar Vorlage of the Greek recensio vetusta (n).4 The Syrian redactor, probably an East Syrian Christian, added a certain number of until then unknown episodes to the text. The episode of Alexander&#x27;s building a wall against Gog and Magog, however, is not found in the oldest Greek, Latin, Armenian and Syriac versions of the Romance.

<doc id="1188636" wikidata="Q244894" url="?curid=1188636" title="Lucho González">
<text>Luis Óscar&quot;Lucho&quot;González (; born 19 January 1981) is an Argentine former professional footballer, currently a manager. A versatile midfielder who was able to play in different positions but mainly in the centre, he was well known for his fierce shot, passing and work rate, being affectionately known as &quot;El Comandante&quot; (the commander) due to his leadership skills.

After starting with Huracán and River Plate, he signed for Porto in 2005, where he played 241 games and scored 61 goals across two spells, winning ten major titles. He also played in France with Marseille, Al-Rayyan in Qatar and Athletico Paranaense in Brazil; his 29 honours were surpassed only by Lionel Messi among his countrymen.

An Argentina international on 45 occasions, González represented his country in the 2006 World Cup and two Copa América tournaments.

==Club career==
===Early years===
González was born in Buenos Aires to a mother from Chile and a father from Uruguay. He began his career at Huracán at the age of 14, making his Primera División debut on 29 April 1999 in a 1–2 home loss against Racing Club.

Three years later, González transferred to another side in his hometown, River Plate, where he won consecutive &quot;Clausura&quot; tournaments in 2003 and 2004, contributing 23 goals in 120 games across all competitions.

===Porto===
González&#x27;s performances at River earned him a deal with Portugal&#x27;s Porto in 2005, signing a five-year contract. In his first season he scored ten goals in 30 matches, including braces against Académica de Coimbra (5–1), Penafiel (3–1) and Vitória de Guimarães (3–1), helping the northerners to the first of their four consecutive Primeira Liga titles.

González eventually became team captain at Porto. In November 2006, he agreed to an improved five-year deal and, in August of the following year, the club paid €6.65 million to Global Soccer Agencies (later renamed Rio Football Services) to achieve full ownership of the player, activating the clause by rejecting an offer from Everton.

On 22 March 2009, González netted against Estrela da Amadora in the first leg of the semi-finals of the Taça de Portugal (2–0 home win, 3–2 on aggregate). During the league campaign, he scored nine times in only 23 appearances to help the team to the fourth title in a row; the season ended with the double conquest.

===Marseille===

In June 2009, González was sold to Marseille in France for a fee of €18 million, with the possibility of an increase to €24 million depending on the player&#x27;s performance; the four-year transfer was the most expensive in the club&#x27;s history. He scored his first official goal for his new side on 19 September, opening a 4–2 home victory over Montpellier, and also found the net on 26 November in the 1–1 draw with AC Milan in the group stage of the UEFA Champions League, at the San Siro. He scored against Real Madrid in an ensuing fixture on 8 December, but later missed a penalty kick in the 1–3 home loss, with the subsequent relegation to the UEFA Europa League.

After the winter break, González also helped Marseille to reach the final of the Coupe de la Ligue, scoring against Lille in the quarter-finals (2–1) in late January. On 28 February, he scored in a 3–0 away defeat of Paris Saint-Germain which left &quot;L&#x27;OM&quot; in fourth place. He finished his first season with 32 matches and five goals, winning a league/league cup double.

González scored his first goal of the 2010–11 campaign on 29 August 2010, in a 1–1 draw at Bordeaux. On 3 November, he grabbed a brace in the 7–0 away rout of Žilina in the Champions League group phase.

González started in the 2011 Coupe de la Ligue final, won 1–0 against Montpellier. He was linked with a transfer to England&#x27;s Arsenal in early May 2011 because of his solid performances, to which he responded that &quot;I don&#x27;t know why there are so many things said about this at the moment. It annoys me a bit. At no time has it left my mouth that I wanted to leave or that I didn&#x27;t feel good here. I have a contract with OM until 2013 and the people at the club seem happy with me.&quot; On 8 May, Marseille faced title challengers Lyon at the Stade de Gerland, and he scored in an eventual 3–2 defeat, with his team eventually finishing second to Lille. After the season ended, chairman Jean-Claude Dassier confirmed that he was seeking an exit from the club.

Despite the constant speculation, González remained at the Stade Vélodrome for 2011–12. On the first fixture, he opened the score in the 38th minute of a 2–2 home draw against Sochaux. On 13 September, he netted the game&#x27;s only goal at Olympiacos in the Champions League group stage, where he also earned Player of the match accolades.

===Return to Porto===

On 30 January 2012, after 124 competitive appearances for Marseille, González returned to Porto, signing until June 2014. He scored in his first match in his second spell, a 2–0 win against Vitória de Setúbal in the Taça da Liga on 5 February. He opened a 2–0 home victory over Olhanense on 31 March, his first league goal since returning.

In 2012–13, Porto won a third consecutive league title after an unbeaten season with González as captain; he opened a decisive 2–0 win at Paços de Ferreira on the final day. In the Champions League, he netted in away and home group wins over Dinamo Zagreb with the former coming on the day of his father&#x27;s death; the goals gave him the record figure of 16 in that phase of the competition, while he never scored any later on. He added two more the following season, as the Dragons came third at that stage and fell into the Europa League.

===Later career===
On 27 January 2014, González signed with Qatari club Al-Rayyan, initially until June. Eighteen months later, he returned to his country&#x27;s league and River Plate for the first time in a decade, signing until 2017. He played as a substitute in their Copa Libertadores finals win over Tigres and the victory against Gamba Osaka in the 2015 Suruga Bank Championship in his first year back.

At the age of 35 on 16 September 2016, González joined Brazil&#x27;s Athletico Paranaense. He played 160 times and scored ten goals for the side, winning five trophies including the Copa Sudamericana in 2018.

González announced his retirement on 27 May 2021, at the age of 40.

==International career==
Under the guidance of Marcelo Bielsa, González earned his first cap for the Argentina national team on 31 January 2003 against Honduras. He went on to represent the nation in the 2004 Copa América, scoring two goals during the tournament as the country lost the final on penalties to Brazil.

González also played with the side that won the gold medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics. In 2006, he was selected for the 2006 FIFA World Cup in which Argentina, managed by José Pekerman, lost to hosts Germany in the quarter-finals on penalties.

Subsequently, González was part of the Alfio Basile–led squad at 2007 Copa América, where the &quot;Albiceleste&quot; was again defeated by Brazil in the decisive match, now 3–0.

==Coaching career==
González returned to his final club Athletico in January 2022, as assistant to manager Alberto Valentim. In April, he was named as the latter&#x27;s interim replacement, but chose to leave within 24 hours.

On 24 August 2022, González signed his first coaching contract for fellow Campeonato Brasileiro Série A team Ceará, until the end of the season. He drew 1–1 at Flamengo on his debut on 4 September, and was dismissed on 28 October after only one win in ten matches.

González joined Internacional in July 2023 as assistant to manager Eduardo Coudet, taking part in their run to the Copa Libertadores semi-finals and climbing up the Brazilian League standings. In December, the entire staff was renewed until December 2024.

González departed following Coudet&#x27;s dismissal in July 2024, and returned to Athletico Paranaense on 24 September, now as head coach. He was himself sacked on 10 December, after suffering relegation in the year of the club&#x27;s 100th birthday.

<doc id="1188638" wikidata="Q369346" url="?curid=1188638" title="Ecstasy (film)">
<text>Ecstasy (; ; ) is a 1933 Czech erotic romantic drama film directed by Gustav Machatý and starring Hedy Lamarr (then Hedy Kiesler), Aribert Mog, and Zvonimir Rogoz. Machatý won the award for Best Director for this film at the 1934 Venice Film Festival.

The film is about a young woman who marries a wealthy but much older man. After abandoning her brief passionless marriage, she meets a young virile engineer who becomes her lover. &quot;Ecstasy&quot; was filmed in three language versions – German, Czech, and French. It is perhaps the first non-pornographic movie to portray sexual intercourse and the female orgasm, although never showing more than the actors&#x27; faces.

==Plot==
Emil, a fastidious and orderly older man, carries his happy new bride, Eva, over the threshold of their home. He has great difficulty opening the lock on the front door, trying key after key. She is greatly disappointed on their wedding night because he does not even come to bed. He has pinched his finger in the clasp of Eva&#x27;s pearls when he attempts to remove them. He is unable to consummate their marriage due to the minor injury on his finger. Emil continues to ignore Eva for many days often retreating behind his newspaper. Eva refuses to live in a loveless marriage. She can no longer bear to be Emil&#x27;s wife in name only and returns to the estate of her father, a wealthy horse breeder. Eva seeks and is granted a divorce from Emil.

One day, Eva goes horseback riding in the countryside surrounding her father&#x27;s estate. She has a swim in the nude, leaving her clothes on her horse, which wanders off to find a stallion locked in a nearby corral. Eva, still completely naked, chases after her horse. Adam, a virile, young engineer working in road construction in that area, happens to look up and see Eva trying to catch her horse. Finally, Adam is able to catch the runaway horse. Eva is so embarrassed that she hides in the bushes when Adam approaches her. At first, Eva is ashamed of her nudity, but then she glares up at him in defiance. He hands Eva her clothes. When she tries to leave, she hurts her ankle. At first, she resists Adam&#x27;s efforts to help, then acquiesces.

That night, Eva is restless and cannot stop thinking about Adam. Finally, she goes to his isolated residence, which is located near the field where they met. After some hesitation, they embrace and spend the night together. In the throes of passion, Eva&#x27;s pearl necklace is broken and falls to the floor. She forgets to take it with her the next morning but the young lovers promise to meet in town at the local hotel the following evening.

When Eva returns home the next morning, she finds an unwelcome visitor. Her ex-husband, Emil, has been waiting for her all night. He wants to reconcile with her, but she tells him that it is too late. Brokenhearted, he leaves.

By chance, while driving away, Emil encounters Adam on the road and Adam asks for a ride into town. Emil agrees. They stop at Adam&#x27;s residence in order to pack his suitcase. While packing, Adam notices Eva&#x27;s pearls on the floor. He takes them along intending to return them to her. While traveling to town, Emil notices Adam admiring the pearl necklace and instantly recognizes it as that belonging to his ex-wife. Emil becomes jealous and enraged. Adam has no idea that Emil had been married to Eva. In his anger, Emil considers driving into an approaching train at a crossing, but at the last moment thinks better of it.

That night, Emil sits alone in a hotel room while a fly tries futilely to get out through a closed window and several others are shown trapped in flypaper. Meanwhile, downstairs, Adam is arranging flowers as he waits in the hotel restaurant for his lover, Eva, to arrive. The young lovers are very happy to be reunited. While they are drinking champagne and dancing, they suddenly hear a gunshot. Emil has shot himself. Everyone in the hotel runs to the door of Emil&#x27;s room. Adam still does not know of the connection between Emil and Eva. She is deeply saddened by the suicide of Emil. However, she does not divulge her relationship with Emil to anyone, including Adam.

The young couple were to take the train to Berlin later that evening and begin their new life together. While waiting at the train station, Adam falls asleep. A distraught Eva slips quietly away while Adam sleeps and leaves on a different train. Later, he returns to his work in construction and daydreams of Eva, imagining her happily holding his baby.

==Production==
&quot;Ecstasy&quot; was filmed in the summer of 1932, with a German language script that contained only five pages. The original prepared script (two previous versions were cancelled) was in Czech, so Lamarr was useful in translating from German to French. After the shooting at Barrandov Terraces in Prague and a pond in Jevany, the crew moved to Dobšiná, Slovakia on 5 July 1932, to shoot the rest of the outdoor scenes.

It was not until August that shooting really started, mostly because of disputes about the French version and French actors. From Dobšiná, short shooting trips of one or two days were made to other places: Topoľčianky (scenes with horses), Khust, Carpathian Ruthenia, and railroad construction Červená skala – Margecany. The film was not finished in time, and &quot;A-B ateliery&quot; in Prague was already booked out in September, so some indoor scenes were filmed over six days in the Atelier Schönbrunn studios in Vienna, Austria, which was commercially useful because the producer did not have to pay the import (contingency) fee when showing the film in Austria. By that time the distribution rights had already been sold in Germany, Austria, Hungary, Switzerland, Belgium, France, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and other countries.

==Release==
The world premiere of the film took place on 20 January 1933 in Prague, Czechoslovakia. In Austria, the film was released on 14 February 1933. Due to censorship problems, German cinemas did not show it until 8 January 1935, with the title &quot;Symphonie der Liebe&quot; (&quot;Symphony of Love&quot;).

===Controversy===
&quot;Ecstasy&quot; was controversial in some countries because of the film&#x27;s nudity and the orgasm scene. Lamarr later claimed in interviews she was tricked into the nude scenes by the director and there was no mention of the nude scenes in the script.
 However, other people involved in the movie disputed this. Lupita Tovar was offered the role of Eva, but after her husband Paul Kohner saw the script, which made it clear that nudity was expected, he insisted she not take the role. A similar story was told by Adina Mandlová, who was forbidden to accept the role by her then-boyfriend Hugo Haas. Cinematographer Jan Stallich said of Lamarr: &quot;As the star of the picture she knew she would have to appear naked in some scenes. She never made any fuss about it during the production.&quot;
After a Vatican journalist attended screening at Venice Film Festival, Pope Pius XI denounced the film in the Vatican newspaper. As a result, none of the Italian distributors bought the rights for distribution. In Germany, the film was banned and only released in 1935 with edited scenes. In the United States, the Catholic Legion of Decency found the film morally objectionable. It condemned the film in 1933, making &quot;Ecstasy&quot; one of the first foreign films condemned by the Legion.

Beginning in 1936, the US distributor of &quot;Ecstasy&quot; lobbied the Hays office for ten months to get the film the Hays Code seal of approval which would allow it a wide American release. Joseph Breen called the picture &quot;highlyeven dangerouslyindecent&quot; in an inter-office memo to Will H. Hays, and told the producers:
 Breen later hired Machatý at RKO in 1940.

&quot;Ecstasy&quot; was not released in the United States until 1935. It went on to limited run in America without the Hays seal, where it played in mostly independent art houses. Some state censor boards such as New York approved the film but most others either only allowed it with restrictions, demanded substantial cuts, or in the case of Pennsylvania, banned it altogether.

Lamarr&#x27;s first husband, the wealthy arms dealer Friedrich Mandl, reportedly spent $280,000 ($ in dollars) in an unsuccessful attempt to suppress the film by purchasing every existing print.

==Versions==
Austrian and Czech versions of the film were very similar. Only the scenes with supporting actors differed. The roles of Eva, Adam and Eva&#x27;s father were overdubbed by Czech actors for the Czech version. Zvonimir Rogoz replayed all of his dialog in Czech. The French version featured actors André Nox as Eva&#x27;s father and Pierre Nay as Adam.

Machatý anticipated problems with censors, so he shot alternative scenes, that could be edited in the movie. The original versions were screened in Czechoslovakia, Austria and Venice Film Festival. In Germany censors allowed the film only after some of the nude shots were removed and two additional scenes were added: one scene making it clear Eva was already divorced when she met Adam, and a more traditional ending where Eva and Adam stay together. This version was the basis for the US distribution version. The US version also added songs by Denes Agay and Emery H. Helm with lyrics by Henry Gershwin and William Colligan.

<text>The Matterhorn Gotthard Bahn is a narrow gauge railway line and a railway company (Matterhorn Gotthard Bahn AG, MGB) in Switzerland. The track width is . It was created in 2003 through an amalgamation of Furka Oberalp Bahn (FO) and BVZ Zermatt-Bahn (BVZ). The name comes from the Matterhorn and St. Gotthard Pass.

Its network is long and stretches from Disentis in the canton of Graubünden to Zermatt in the canton of Wallis, by way of the Oberalp Pass and Andermatt in the canton of Uri, the Furka Base Tunnel, Brig, and Visp. From Andermatt, a branch line (the formerly independent Schöllenenbahn) extends to Göschenen, at the northern end of the Gotthard Rail Tunnel.

The network is an adhesion railway but using Abt rack assistance on the steeper inclines.

Between Realp and Oberwald the line formerly crossed the Furka Pass, at a crest elevation of above sea level with a tunnel passing beneath the pass. This compares to a crest elevation of just above sea level in today&#x27;s Furka Base Tunnel, which is long. The old line, the scenic route, which is very attractive to tourists, is operated by the Dampfbahn Furka-Bergstrecke (DFB) (&quot;Furka Heritage Railway&quot;) using veteran steam engines.

There is a connection to the Rhaetian Railway in Disentis and the Glacier Express runs from Zermatt to St. Moritz, using stock from both companies.

==Operation==
Apart from the Glacier Express, the current schedule sees passenger trains commuting between Brig and Zermatt, Brig and Göschenen, as well as Andermatt and Disentis. MGB also operates two car shuttle trains: between Realp and Oberwald through Furka Base Tunnel, and between Andermatt and Sedrun.

Large-scale freight traffic only takes place between Visp and Zermatt and between Disentis and the NRLA construction site near Sedrun.

==Accidents and incidents==
*11 September 2017, the locomotive of a train collided with its own coaches during a manoeuvre at station. About 30 people were injured.
*3 July 2020, a shuttle train hit the side of the passenger train, which was carrying 30 passengers. A few minor injuries were reported. The wreck occurred in the small town of Oberwald in south Switzerland, near the Italian border. The Matterhorn Gotthard Bahn train line, which passes through the Alps, was halted on account of the crash.

==Corporate structure==
The MGB is composed of three companies: the &quot;Matterhorn Gotthard AG (MGB)&quot; emerged from a rebranding of BVZ, the &quot;Matterhorn Gotthard infrastructure AG (MGI)&quot; is the former FO, and a new stock company &quot;Matterhorn Gotthard railway (MGM)&quot; has been established as a management umbrella. The MGB has taken over FO&#x27;s operations and has turned over BVZ&#x27;s infrastructure to MGI in exchange. The MGB is majority owned by the &quot;BVZ Holding AG&quot; (which also owns the Gornergratbahn AG (GGB)), whereas the MGI shares are held by the Swiss federal government and the cantons, MGM is owned by BVZ Holding and the public sector in equal shares.

<doc id="1188648" wikidata="Q4912412" url="?curid=1188648" title="Billy Cranston">
<text>Billy Cranston is a fictional character in the Power Rangers universe. He is the Blue Ranger (triceratops) in the series &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,&quot; and was portrayed by actor David Yost. Billy is the only original Power Ranger to remain for the entire &quot;MMPR&quot; series, and is the second longest-serving Ranger overall behind Tommy Oliver. Until his departure, he is considered the brains of the Power Rangers team, creating many gadgets with which to solve problems that not even Zordon foresees, and he even invents the first team&#x27;s wrist-worn communication devices. A reimagined version of Billy appears in 2017 reboot film, played by actor RJ Cyler.

==Character history==
===Television===
====&quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot;====
Billy is one of the five &quot;teenagers with attitude&quot; selected by Zordon to become the original Power Rangers, along with Jason Lee Scott, Zack Taylor, Trini Kwan and Kimberly Hart. Billy becomes the Blue Power Ranger and is given both the Triceratops Power Coin and the Triceratops Dinozord.

Billy begins the series as the stereotypical &quot;nerd&quot;. The other Rangers, especially Trini, defend him loyally, but Billy later evolves to become a stronger individual. He is one of the top members of Angel Grove High&#x27;s science club and often helps its younger members with their experiments. One such example is with Willy, a young boy he helps to create a virtual reality simulator for a Science Fair. In the episode &quot;High Five&quot;, Billy creates not only the wrist communicators the Power Rangers use, but also the interface that allows the devices a remote access to the Command Center&#x27;s teleportation unit.

It is revealed that, due to an experience in his youth when he was bitten by a fish during an experiment involving whirlpools, Billy developed icthyophobia: fear of fish. This fear affects him well into his teens, when Rita uses a spell to exacerbate this fear. When he is the last Ranger left able to contend with the Goo Fish monster, Billy overcomes the spell and then, after helping to free his friends and defeat the monster, completely overcomes the fear itself on a fishing trip with Ernie, the owner of the Youth Center.

Each of Billy&#x27;s teammates have a unique skill to offer the team and, in Billy&#x27;s case, it is his vast intelligence. He seeks out to improve himself physically, and the audience sees him transition over time from the suspenders-wearing &quot;brain&quot; to a confident, hyper-intelligent athlete with fighting skills, thanks in great part to Trini&#x27;s Uncle Howard. Jason and later Tommy help graduate Billy to the red belt level in karate.

Billy&#x27;s intelligence helps the Rangers save the world on many occasions. When the Command Center is damaged, Zordon lost and Alpha incapacitated, it is his invention, a car called the RADBUG, that allows the Rangers to travel to the Command Center. He performs an array of tasks, ranging from creating the method for which the Rangers use initially to infiltrate Rita&#x27;s Dark Dimension, to disarming the lock-out mechanism for Alpha&#x27;s activated self-destruct, and many other achievements. Though Billy does manage to attract girls earlier in his &quot;nerd-like&quot; persona, it is after he begins his journey toward self-improvement that he garners more attention from romantic interests, even more so than the other members of the team.

Billy is accepted into the Young Scientists of America program. In Season 2, he befriends Zack&#x27;s cousin Curtis when he becomes the newest student at Angel Grove High. Curtis&#x27; musical interests, particularly in playing the trumpet, sparks Billy&#x27;s interest into the rhythmic patterns of jazz music.

Later in Season 2, a time-traveling Kimberly recruits Billy&#x27;s ancestor, also named &quot;William Cranston,&quot; in the 1880s to become the first Blue Ranger when she assembles and takes command of the Wild West Ranger team in a battle against Goldar and other time traveling foes. Also in Season 2, Billy commands the Unicorn Thunderzord.

In season 3, Billy gains new powers from Ninjor, who gives him the Wolf Power Coin, and becomes the Blue Ninja Ranger.

====&quot;Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers&quot;====
The Rangers are de-aged by a time reversal spell performed by Rita Repulsa&#x27;s father, Master Vile. Billy devises a plan to restore the Rangers&#x27; ages using a machine that ran off the power coins. Billy restores himself, but Rita and Goldar steal the machine, and Lord Zedd and Rita Repulsa destroy all six Ninja Power Coins. With his Wolf Ninja Coin destroyed and his Triceratops Power Coin damaged beyond use, Billy&#x27;s role changes. He no longer fights as a Power Ranger, but rather acts solely in an advisory and supporting role. Indeed, Billy is the only Ranger in this period still to be acted out by his regular actor – the others had been replaced temporarily by child actors after Master Vile had used the Orb of Doom to revert time by approximately ten years. Billy acts in this period as a liaison between the Aquitian Rangers and Earth. It is the cure for Billy&#x27;s reverse-aging that eventually serves as the plot device by which he is removed from the show.

====&quot;Power Rangers Zeo&quot;====
When &quot;Power Rangers Zeo&quot; begins, Billy officially retires from active Ranger service as the six-man team now only have the five segments of the Zeo Crystal as a power source for each member. Based on his recent experience basically working as a technical advisor for the active Rangers, Billy allows new member Tanya to take his place while he continus his supporting role by creating and maintaining most of the weaponry, gadgets and Zords the Zeo Rangers use.

The writers left the choice open as to whether or not Billy would become a Zeo Ranger, with him musing at the start of &quot;Zeo&quot; that he could always assume the Zeo power in an emergency. He graduates earlier than the rest of the team in &quot;Graduation Blues&quot;, and then leaves Earth to address problems on the planet Aquitar. In &quot;Mr. Billy&#x27;s Wild Ride&quot;, he returns to Earth, but is attacked by the machine empire along the way and nearly captured.

Before the Gold Ranger&#x27;s identity is revealed as Trey of Triforia, the writers left red herrings to mislead the viewers into believing that the Gold Ranger is Billy, since he is never around when the Gold Ranger is active. When Trey of Triforia is injured and unable to continue acting as the Gold Ranger, Billy is selected to assume the Gold Ranger&#x27;s powers while Trey returned to Triforia on sabbatical to try to unify his three selves. However, the negative proton energy that his body absorbed in the Command Center&#x27;s explosion prevents Billy from taking the powers. Instead Jason Lee Scott, the former Red Ranger, receives the powers.

In &quot;Mondo&#x27;s Last Stand&quot;, it is shown that Billy has worked his way up to a black belt in karate.

Billy is last seen in the two-part crossover episode, suffering from accelerated aging, a side effect from the regenerator he used to restore his proper age. To counter this, he travels to Aquitar for a cure from their Eternal Falls (analogous to the Fountain of Youth), which restores his real age; after that he opts to remain there with Cestria, a female Aquitian with whom he had fallen in love.

====&quot;Power Rangers Super Megaforce&quot;====
During the final episode of &quot;Power Rangers Super Megaforce&quot; - &quot;Legendary Battle&quot; - Billy participates in the eponymous battle as the Blue Mighty Morphin Power Ranger alongside other past and present Power Rangers. Yost does not reprise the role for this morphed appearance.

====&quot;Power Rangers Beast Morphers&quot;====
Billy makes another morphed appearance as the Blue Mighty Morphin Power Ranger for a second season episode of &quot;Power Rangers Beast Morphers&quot; - &quot;Grid Connection&quot;. The episode saw Austin St. John reprise the role of Jason Lee Scott, the Red Mighty Morphin Power Ranger. Jason summons the other four core Mighty Morphin Power Rangers and the original three Dino Thunder rangers to join him and the Dino Charge rangers in battling a resurrected Goldar Maximus. Again, Yost did not return; Billy has no dialogue and remains morphed throughout the appearance.

====&quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Once &amp; Always&quot;====
For Hasbro PulseCon 2022, David Yost announced he would reprise the role of Billy to mark the 30th anniversary of the &quot;Power Rangers&quot; franchise. &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Once and Always&quot; was released on Netflix on April 19, 2023.

In the special, set 30 years after Zordon recruited the original Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, Billy is now the founder and CEO of &quot;Cranston Technologies&quot;, which operates a secret Power Rangers command center under its headquarters. While attempting to re-establish contact with Zordon, Billy accidentally restores the evil spirit of Rita Repulsa, which takes over the body of Alpha 8 and becomes Robo-Rita. In the ensuing battle, Rita fires an energy blast at Billy which is intercepted by Trini, killing the Yellow Ranger in the process.

When Trini&#x27;s daughter Minh blames him for her mother&#x27;s death, Billy works to correct his mistakes until, a year later, Rita reappears and captures Tommy, Jason, and Kimberly. She plans to drain their energy to power a time machine that will allow her to contact her past self and alter the timeline in her favor.

Billy leads the remaining Mighty Morphin&#x27; Power Rangers - a team consisting of himself, Zack, Kat and Rocky - to thwart Rita&#x27;s plan. Meanwhile, Minh steals Trini&#x27;s morpher to join the fight but finds herself unable to use it and gets captured. Billy attempts to rescue her and Minh sacrifices herself to prevent him suffering the same fate as Trini. This action bonds her to the Sabre-Toothed Tiger Power Coin, which saves her and allows her to morph into the Yellow Mighty Morphin&#x27; Power Ranger. Billy instructs her on piloting the Megazord to defeat Rita&#x27;s minions and the pair reconcile. It is then revealed that Billy and Cestria are still together and he decides, once he&#x27;s dealt with some business matters on Earth, to resume his intergalactic travels.

====&quot;Power Rangers Cosmic Fury&quot;====
Billy is a mentor to and member of the Cosmic Fury team, using his Mighty Morphin powers and piloting a zord.

===Film===
====Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie (1995)====
Yost reprises the role of Billy for &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie&quot;, released in 1995, which sees the Power Rangers losing their powers after an encounter with the new villain Ivan Ooze (Paul Freeman). The Rangers go on a quest to restore their powers and save Zordon&#x27;s life in the process. The events of the movie are non-canon to the television series, where a similar scenario plays out (minus Ivan Ooze) in the &quot;Ninja Quest&quot; saga near the start of the third season.

====Power Rangers (2017)====
William &quot;Billy&quot; Cranston appears in the 2017 reboot, played by actor RJ Cyler. In this version, he is autistic unlike in the TV series.

===Comics===
====&quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Pink&quot;====
Kimberly is the main character in this comic book mini series published by Boom! Studios. The series is a modern remake but also serves as a continuation from Kimberly&#x27;s exit in the third season of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.

====&quot;Power Rangers (Boom! Studios)&quot;====
The Boom! Studios comics feature Billy as a major character back in the original era, the series starting shortly after the battle with the Green Ranger.

===Other appearances===
==== &quot;Power/Rangers&quot; (2015 short film) ====
In &quot;Power/Rangers&quot; Billy Cranston (played by Yves Bright), is trillionaire who buys Lockheed Martin and was found dead of an apparent suicide.

==Behind the scenes==

David Yost has stated he had walked off the show a few episodes prior to his character&#x27;s departure, due to repeated and ongoing homophobic slurs by the creators, producers, directors, and writers of the series, which is why he does not appear in them. However, producer Scott Page-Pagter has denied these statements, claiming Yost left over a salary dispute and had conflicts with members of the crew. As a result, stock footage of Yost was used for his departure and the character was voiced by someone else (In broadcasting Billy&#x27;s departing message to his friends, it was mentioned they were having trouble with the signal). He was also the last of the original Power Ranger team to leave the show, although his former teammate Jason had returned as the Gold Ranger at that time.

It was widely believed that Billy&#x27;s surname came from Bryan Cranston, who did voice work for &quot;Mighty Morphin&#x27; Power Rangers&quot;, and would later portray Zordon in the 2017 film. Bryan Cranston was told this and it was later confirmed to him from an unknown source. However, in recent years, promotional material for an attempted Bioman adaptation by Haim Saban, from 1984, revealed that the surname was decided on long before Cranston became involved with the series.

<doc id="1188649" wikidata="Q1720575" url="?curid=1188649" title="Nicolás Medina">
<text>Nicolás Rubén Medina (born 17 February 1982) is an Argentine former professional footballer who primarily played as a central midfielder. He accomplished more in his international career, especially in his early years as a world champion at the 2001 FIFA U20 Youth Championship as well as a gold medal at the 2004 Olympics, than he has in his club career. His journeyman club career was chronicled by Futbol Futbol Futbol, the South American football website.

==Club career==

===Argentinos Juniors===
Born in Buenos Aires, Medina started his career as a heralded player at the youth level for Argentinos Juniors which also saw him capped at the national team youth level. He made his senior team debut on 3 September 1999 against Boca Juniors. He finished the 1999 Apertura with 11 games. He played 16 games in the 2000 Clausura. In the 2000 Apertura, he played 8 games and he played 13 games and scored his first goal in the 2001 Clausura on 11 February 2001 at home in a 2–2 tie against Boca Juniors.

===Sunderland===
In 2001, Medina signed for English Premier League team Sunderland A.F.C. for £3.5 million, joining up with Argentine youth team colleague Julio Arca. At his signing, manager Peter Reid hailed him as &quot;a complete midfield player&quot;. While Arca had become an instant hit at the Stadium of Light, Medina failed to make it into the first team and spent most of his time at Sunderland in the reserve team. Both fans and the media began to speculate as to why such an expensive signing was not given a chance. This led to popular theories that he was suffering a serious illness, or that he had fallen out with Reid. Neither rumour was proven. Medina briefly courted controversy early in his Sunderland career, after being quoted in an Argentine newspaper that he was planning to live in Newcastle (home to Newcastle United, Sunderland&#x27;s fiercest rivals) rather than in the City of Sunderland. When new Sunderland manager Howard Wilkinson took over at Sunderland, he did what Peter Reid had failed to do and publicly explain why Medina was not being picked for Sunderland, despite playing for the Argentina national football team. In an interview he stated that: &quot;The evidence suggests that Nicolas hasn&#x27;t got it because the previous manager didn&#x27;t pick him.&quot; Medina eventually left Sunderland having only played once for the first team; in an FA Cup tie against Bolton Wanderers (he was substituted in this game but the BBC described it as &quot;an impressive debut&quot;). He remains the most expensive Sunderland player to never play a first-team league game. Given that fact, he is recognized as one of Sunderland&#x27;s worst transfers.

===Spain===
Due to the issues getting playing time at Sunderland A.F.C., Medina went on loan to CD Leganés in the Spain Segunda División for the 2003–2004 season which he played 32 games. For the 2004–2005 season, Sunderland let Medina leave the club on a loan which then turned into a free transfer and he returned to the Segunda División with Real Murcia. He played 20 games and scored 2 goals, both in a game against Málaga Club de Fútbol B on 16 October 2004.

===Return to Argentina===
He has returned to Argentina and played for Rosario Central in the 2005 Apertura playing 3 games. For the 2006 Clausura, he joined Gimnasia y Esgrima de La Plata which promptly loaned him to Club Atlético Nueva Chicago playing 1 game in the 2006 Apertura. Midway through the 2007 Clausura, he went on loan to Talleres de Córdoba in Primera B Nacional where he became a starter and played 9 games and scored 1 goal (12 April – in a 2–1 loss to Club Atlético Huracán). For the 2007 Apertura, he returned to Gimnasia y Esgrima de La Plata playing 7 games. In February of the 2008 Clausura, Medina ruptured an achilles tendon, which sidelined him for the entire year.

===Chile===
Medina joined O&#x27;Higgins on 28 December 2008. He was a regular starter in the team&#x27;s midfield in the 2009 Clausura playing 11 games and then playing 12 games in the 2009 Apertura.

===Back to Argentina===
Medina returned once again to Argentina in 2010 for the Clausura and joined Tiro Federal in Primera B Nacional. He played 9 games that season.

===Mexico===
Prior to the 2011 Clausura, Medina joined C.F. La Piedad in Ascenso MX and made an auspicious start to his short-lived career in Mexico on 20 March 2011 when he was red carded in his debut. He finished with just two games for C.F. La Piedad.

===Return to Argentina===
After a hiatus from playing after his time with C.F. La Piedad, Medina wanted to resume his career so he returned home and in August 2012 he joined El Porvenir in Primera C. He was bringing experience to a youthful team while he worked his way back into the game. He played 12 games in the 2012 Apertura before leaving the team in December 2012 to trial with the Philadelphia Union in Major League Soccer.

===United States===
In January 2013, Medina joined the pre-season camp of the Philadelphia Union in Major League Soccer as a trialist. He was the first player recruited into pre-season camp by the Union&#x27;s Director of International Player Development, Ricardo Ansaldi, who has strong ties to one of Medina&#x27;s former clubs, Tiro Federal.

==International career==
Medina was part of the Argentine U17 team in the South American qualifiers hosted by Uruguay for the 1999 FIFA U17 World Cup; however, Argentina finished in 4th place and did not qualify. His performances saw him called up to train in Amsterdam with the full national team for a friendly in March 1999 against Netherlands.

He started all 7 games for the U20 team in the 2001 FIFA U20 World Cup in Argentina, including going 90 minutes in the final against Ghana. (in addition to 1st-round games against Finland, Egypt and Jamaica – round of 16 game against China, quarter-final against France and semi-final game against Paraguay). As part of that U20 World Championship team, Medina&#x27;s performance was cited by FIFA in the tournament&#x27;s Technical Report as follows – &quot;Central midfielder Medina was a key player in the Argentine squad. He regularly won back possession and created balance when the team attacked. He moved around the pitch smoothly and when he got the ball, automatically increased the pace of the game. He delivered one-two passes with great ease and precision&quot; . Unlike many of his teammates, he would not be able to replicate that success at the national team level.

Medina was a starting member for Argentina in the 2004 South America Olympic qualification tournament held in Chile, where he played 5 games (1st-round games against Bolivia, Ecuador and Colombia as well as Final Stage games against Paraguay and Brazil). Medina was then part of the gold medal winning Argentine team at the 2004 Summer Olympics At the Olympics, he made 3 appearances as a substitute (1st-round game against Serbia and Montenegro, quarter-final game against Costa Rica as well as the semi-final game against Italy and was an unused substitute in the other 3 games, including the final against Paraguay.

He was called into the 2003 winter training camp in advance of three friendlies against CONCACAF opponents although he did not play. Given Medina&#x27;s positional versatility, he was brought in as a defender for this camp. In the Summer of 2004, he was part of the 2004 Copa América team but did not play in that tournament. On 4 September 2004, he made his only appearance for the Argentina national football team in a 2006 World Cup qualifier at Peru in which he made a late appearance (7 minutes) as a substitute in Argentina&#x27;s 3–1 victory.

==Style of play==
Medina has been deployed mostly as a central midfielder but has shown &quot;adaptability to function in almost all positions in midfield&quot; and has played as a defender at times in his career.

==Personal life==
Medina also holds Italian nationality.

<text>Chadian Action for Unity and Socialism () is a communist party in Chad, led by Fidèle Moungar. The party was founded in 1981.

Moungar was chosen as Prime Minister in April 1993 by the Sovereign National Conference, but subsequently lost an October 1993 vote of no-confidence and resigned. ACTUS joined the 13-member Coordination of Armed Movements and Political Parties of the Opposition (CMAP) coalition in December 1999.

In the parliamentary election held on April 21, 2002, the party won 1 out of 155 seats. Its sole deputy in the National Assembly, Nderbé Kemnade, joined the Federation Parliamentary Group, which is primarily composed of the Federation, Action for the Republic (FAR) party.

ACTUS publishes the magazine &quot;Perspectives&quot;.

There is a break-away faction of ACTUS led by Ley-Ngardigal Djimadoum.

<doc id="1188654" wikidata="Q1757689" url="?curid=1188654" title="Cypriot syllabary">
<text>The Cypriot or Cypriote syllabary (also Classical Cypriot Syllabary) is a syllabic script used in Iron Age Cyprus, from about the 11th to the 4th centuries BCE, when it was replaced by the Greek alphabet. It has been suggested that the script remained in use as late as the 1st century BC. A pioneer of that change was King Evagoras of Salamis. It is thought to be descended from the Cypro-Minoan syllabary, itself a variant or derivative of Linear A. Most texts using the script are in the Arcadocypriot dialect of Greek, but also one bilingual (Greek and Eteocypriot) inscription was found in Amathus.

== Origin ==
It is thought that the Cypriot syllabary is derived from the Cypro-Minoan syllabary; the latter is thought to be derived from the Linear A script, and certainly belongs to the circle of Aegean scripts. The most obvious change is the disappearance of ideograms, which were frequent and represented a significant part of Linear A. The earliest inscriptions are found on clay tablets. Parallel to the evolution of cuneiform, the signs soon became simple patterns of lines. There is no evidence of a Semitic influence due to trade, but this pattern seemed to have evolved as the result of habitual use.

== Structure ==
The structure of the Cypriot syllabary is very similar to that of Linear B. This is due to their common origin and underlying language (albeit different dialects). The Cypriot script contains 56 signs. Each sign generally stands for a syllable in the spoken language: e.g. ka, ke, ki, ko, ku. Hence, it is classified as a syllabic writing system. Because each sign stands for an open syllable (CV) rather than a closed one (CVC), the Cypriot syllabary is also an &#x27;open&#x27; syllabary.

To see the glyphs above, you must have a compatible font installed, and your web browser must support Unicode characters in the U+10800–U+1083F range.

=== Differences between Cypriot syllabary and Linear B ===

The main difference between the two lies not in the structure of the syllabary but the use of the symbols. Final consonants in the Cypriot syllabary are marked by a final, silent e. For example, final consonants, n, s, and r are noted by using ne, re, and se. Groups of consonants are created using extra vowels. Diphthongs such as ae, au, eu, and ei are spelled out completely. However, nasal consonants that occur before another consonant are omitted completely.

Compare Linear B (, reconstructed as *) to Cypriot (, read right-to-left), both forms related to () &quot;human&quot;.

One other minor difference involves the representation of the manner of articulation. In the Linear B script, liquid sounds /l/ and /r/ are covered by one series, while there are separate series for the dentals /d/ and /t/. In the Cypriot syllabary, /d/ and /t/ are combined, whereas /l/ and /r/ are distinct.

=== Paleography ===
There are minor differences in the forms of the signs used in different sites. However, the syllabary can be subdivided into two different subtypes based on area: the &quot;Common&quot; and the South-Western or &quot;Paphian&quot;.

== Decipherment ==
The script was deciphered in the 19th century by George Smith due to the Idalion bilingual. Egyptologist Samuel Birch (1872), the numismatist Johannes Brandis (1873), the philologists Moritz Schmidt, Wilhelm Deecke, Justus Siegismund (1874) and the dialectologist H. L. Ahrens (1876) also contributed to decipherment.

==Corpus==
About 1,000 inscriptions in the Cypriot syllabary have been found throughout many different regions. However, these inscriptions vary greatly in length and credibility. Most inscriptions found are dated to be around the 6th century. There are no inscriptions known to be before the 8th century. Most of the tablets found are from funerary monuments and contained merely names of the deceased. A few dedicatory inscriptions were also found but of very little contribution to decipherment. The most important tablets are mainly found in Enkomi and Paphos.

Efforts to collect and publish the known corpus began in the 1800s. In the 1900s the work was taken up by T. B. Mitford and Olivier Masson. Over the years a number of inaccuracies and duplications crept into the collects corpus. In 2015, Massimo Perna published a consolidated and corrected corpus totaling 1,397 inscriptions.

=== Enkomi ===
The earliest dated inscription from Cyprus was discovered at Enkomi in 1955. It was a part of a thick clay tablet with only three lines of writing. Epigraphers immediately saw a resemblance. Because the date of the fragment was found to be around 1500 BCE, considerably earlier than Linear B, linguists determined that the Cypriot syllabary was derived from Linear A and not Linear B. Several other fragments of clay tablets were also found in Enkomi. They date to a later period, around the late 13th or 12th century BCE. The script found on these tablets has considerably evolved and the signs have become simple patterns of lines. Linguists named this new script as Cypro-Minoan syllabary.

=== Idalium ===

Idalium was an ancient city in Cyprus, in modern Dali, Nicosia District. The city was founded on the copper trade in the 3rd millennium BCE. Its name in the 8th century BCE was &quot;Ed-di-al&quot; as it appears on the Sargon Stele of 707 BCE. From this area, archeologists found many of the later Cypriot syllabic scripts. In fact, Idalium held the most significant contribution to the decipherment of Cypriot syllabary – the Tablet of Idalium. It is a large bronze tablet with long inscriptions on both sides. The Tablet of Idalium is dated to about 480–470 BCE. Excluding a few features in morphology and vocabulary, the text is a complete and well-understood document. It details a contract made by the king Stasicyprus and the city of Idalium with the physician Onasilus and his brothers. As payment for the physicians&#x27; care for wounded warriors during a Persian siege of the city, the king promises them certain plots of land. This agreement is put under the protection of the goddess Athena.

=== Recent discoveries ===
Recent discoveries include a small vase dating back to the beginning of the 5th century BCE and a broken marble fragment in the Paphian (Paphos) script. The vase is inscribed on two sides, providing two lists of personal names with Greek formations. The broken marble fragment describes a fragment of an oath. This inscription often mentions King Nicocles, the last king of Paphos and includes some important words and expressions. Four inscribed objects were found in the British Museum stores, a silver cup from Kourion, a White Ware jug, and two limestone tablet fragments.

The number of discoveries of new inscriptions has increased. However, most of the new discoveries have been short, or bear only a few signs. One example is a small clay ball.

== Unicode ==

The Cypriot syllabary was added to the Unicode Standard in April 2003 with the release of version 4.0.

The Unicode block for Cypriot is U+10800–U+1083F.
The Unicode block for the related Aegean Numbers is U+10100–U+1013F.

<doc id="1188656" wikidata="Q133005" url="?curid=1188656" title="Myxophaga">
<text>Myxophaga is the second-smallest suborder of the Coleoptera after Archostemata, consisting of roughly 65 species of small to minute beetles in four families. The members of this suborder are aquatic and semiaquatic, and feed on algae.

==Description==
Myxophaga have several diagnostic features: the antennae are more or less distinctly clubbed with usually fewer than nine segments, mesocoxal cavities are open laterally and bordered by a mesepimeron and metanepisternum, the hind wings are rolled apically in the resting positions. Internally, they are characterised by the presence of six malpighian tubules and the testes are tube-like and coiled.

Beetles of this suborder are adapted to feed on algae. Their mouthparts are characteristic in lacking galeae and having a mobile tooth on their left mandible.

==Taxonomy==
There are four extant families in the suborder Myxophaga divided between two superfamilies, containing about 65 described species, and at least one extinct family.

*Family Lepiceridae 
**&quot;Lepicerus&quot;

**†&quot;Crowsonaerius&quot; 
*Family Torridincolidae 
** &quot;Claudiella&quot; 
** &quot;Delevea&quot; 
** &quot;Iapir&quot; 
** &quot;Incoltorrida&quot; 
** &quot;Satonius&quot; 
** &quot;Torridincola&quot; 
** &quot;Ytu&quot; 
Family †Triamyxidae 
*†&quot;Triamyxa&quot; 
Unplaced in family
*†&quot;Leehermania&quot; 

==Distribution==
Living members of Lepiceridae are confined to northern South America and Central America. Members of Sphaeriusidae occur on all continents except Antarctica, while Hydroscaphidae occurs on all continents except Australia and Antarctica. Torridincolidae occurs in Africa, Asia, and South America.

== Fossil record ==
The fossil record of myxophagan beetles is sparse, likely due to their small size limiting preservation potential. The currently oldest myxophagan is &quot;Triamyxa,&quot; described in 2021 from numerous specimens of found in a coprolite found in Late Triassic (Carnian) aged sediments in Poland. It was placed in its own monotypic family Triamyxidae, and was resolved as either the most basal myxophagan or sister to Hydroscaphidae. The next oldest is &quot;Leehermania&quot; from the Late Triassic (Norian) Cow Branch Formation of North Carolina, which had previously been interpreted as the oldest known rove beetle but in 2019 was reinterpreted as an early diverging relative of the family Hydroscaphidae. A fossil impression assigned to the living genus &quot;Hydroscapha&quot; in Hydroscaphidae is known from the Yixian Formation in the Jehol Biota, dating from the Early Cretaceous (Aptian). Fossils from the early Late Cretaceous (Cenomanian) aged Burmese amber from Myanmar, have been assigned to the extant genus &quot;Lepicerus&quot; and extinct genus &quot;Lepiceratus&quot; within Lepiceridae, as well as the extant &quot;Sphaerius&quot; and &quot;Bezesporum&quot; and the extinct &quot;Burmasporum&quot; and &quot;Crowsonaerius&quot;, belonging to Sphaerusidae.

<text>Punya Thitimajshima (9 November 1955 – 9 May 2006), a Thai professor in the department of telecommunications engineering at King Mongkut&#x27;s Institute of Technology at Ladkrabang, was the co-inventor with Claude Berrou and Alain Glavieux of a groundbreaking coding scheme called turbo codes.

Thitimajshima was educated at King Mongkut&#x27;s Institute of Technology at Ladkrabang, where he earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in control engineering and master&#x27;s degree in electrical engineering. Later he went to École Nationale Supérieure des Télécommunications de Bretagne and Universite de Bretagne Occidentale in France, where he studied telecommunications engineering and received a doctoral degree in 1993 for a dissertation titled &quot;Systematic recursive convolutional codes and their application to parallel concatenation.&quot; Thitimajshima joined the faculty of KMITL in 1995 as a lecturer, and became associate professor.

He was the recipient of the 1998 Golden Jubilee Award for Technological Innovation from the IEEE Information Theory Society together with Berrou and Glavieux. In 2003 he received the Outstanding Technologist Award presented by the Foundation for Promotion of Science and Technology under the Patronage of His Majesty the King of Thailand. He died on 9 May 2006 at the age of 51 from illness.

<text>The Rally for Democracy and Progress (, ) is a political party in Chad, led by Lol Mahamat Choua.

The party was founded by Choua in December 1991 and was among the first batch of political parties to be legalized in March 1992. 

In the parliamentary election held on 21 April 2002, the party, allied to the ruling Patriotic Salvation Movement, won 12 out of 155 seats.

However, since the 2005 Chad constitutional referendum, which would allow President Idriss Déby to eliminate presidential terms, the RDP has been part of the opposition.

<text>Miracles is a book written by C. S. Lewis, originally published in 1947 and revised in 1960. Lewis argues that before one can learn from the study of history whether or not any miracles have ever occurred, one must first settle the philosophical question of whether it is logically possible that miracles can occur in principle. He accuses modern historians and scientific thinkers, particularly secular biblical scholars, of begging the question against miracles, insisting that modern disbelief in miracles is a cultural bias thrust upon the historical record and is not derivable from it.

In a chapter on &quot;The Naturalist and the Supernaturalist&quot; Lewis gives technical definitions to the two terms. Naturalists, under his definition, believe that the Universe is a vast process in which all events which ever happen find their causes solely in the events that happened before them within the system. Supernaturalists believe that interruptions or interferences can take place in this system of our Universe from some other system outside it. In particular, a supernaturalist believes that the natural world was created or derived from a supernatural entity. A supernatural event would be one that is not traceable, even in principle, solely to materially determined causes within our Universe. Libertarian free will, if it exists, would have to be supernatural under this view.

In a chapter on &quot;Natural Laws&quot;, Lewis addresses the issue of whether miracles are incompatible with natural law or science. He argues that rather than being mutually exclusive, miracles are definite interventions that go beyond natural laws. Miracles are consistent with nature, but beyond natural law.

Lewis makes a case for the reality of miracles by presenting the position that something more than nature, a supernatural world, may exist, including a benevolent creator likely to intervene in reality after creation.

All of the major miracles of the New Testament are addressed, with the incarnation playing the central role. Also included are two appendices which deal with matters of free will and the value of prayer.

== Argument from reason ==
Philosophers and scientists including Victor Reppert, William Hasker, and Alvin Plantinga have expanded on the &quot;Argument from reason&quot; and credit Lewis with first bringing the argument to light in &quot;Miracles&quot;.

The argument holds that if, as thoroughgoing naturalism entails, all of our thoughts are the effect of a physical cause, then there is no reason for assuming that they are also the consequent of a reasonable ground. Knowledge, however, is apprehended by reasoning from ground to consequent. Therefore, if naturalism were true, there would be no way of knowing it, or anything else not the direct result of a physical cause.

Lewis asserts that by this logic, the statement &quot;I have reason to believe naturalism is valid&quot; is self-referentially incoherent in the same manner as the sentence &quot;One of the words of this sentence does not have the meaning that it appears to have&quot;, or the statement &quot;I never tell the truth&quot;. In each case, to assume the veracity of the conclusion would eliminate the possibility of valid grounds from which to reach it. To summarize the argument in the book, Lewis quotes J. B. S. Haldane who appeals to a similar line of reasoning. Haldane states &quot;If my mental processes are determined wholly by the motions of atoms in my brain, I have no reason to suppose that my beliefs are true ... and hence I have no reason for supposing my brain to be composed of atoms.&quot;

==Revisions==
The original version of &quot;Miracles&quot; contained a different version of chapter 3 entitled &quot;The Self-Contradiction of the Naturalist&quot;. In it, Lewis made the same argument but referred to atomic motions in the brain as &quot;irrational&quot;. In a Socratic Club debate, Catholic analytical Thomist G. E. M. Anscombe criticized this, prompting Lewis to revise the chapter. The revised chapter presents a more detailed elucidation of the argument and distinguishes between &quot;non-rational&quot; and &quot;irrational&quot; processes. Anscombe commented on the process after Lewis&#x27;s death that the rewrite showed &quot;honesty and seriousness&quot; on the part of Lewis.

<text>Joel Elias Spingarn (May 17, 1875 – July 26, 1939) was an American educator, literary critic, civil rights activist, military intelligence officer, and horticulturalist.

==Biography==
Spingarn was born in New York City to an upper middle-class Jewish family. His younger brother was Arthur B. Spingarn. He graduated from Columbia College in 1895. He grew committed to the importance of the study of comparative literature as a discipline distinct from the study of English or any other language-based literary studies.

Politics was one of his lifetime passions. In 1908, as a Republican he ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. In 1912 and 1916, he was a delegate to the national convention of the Progressive Party. At the first of those conventions, he failed in his attempts to add a statement condemning racial discrimination to the party platform.

He served as professor of comparative literature at Columbia University from 1899 to 1911. His academic publishing established him as one of America&#x27;s foremost comparativists. It included two editions of &quot;A History of Literary Criticism in the Renaissance&quot; in 1899 and 1908 as well as edited works like &quot;Critical Essays of the Seventeenth-Century&quot; in 3 volumes. He summarized his philosophy in &quot;The New Criticism: A Lecture Delivered at Columbia University, March 9, 1910&quot;. There he argued against the constraints of such traditional categories as genre, theme, and historical setting in favor of viewing each work of art afresh and on its own terms. Spingarn&#x27;s criticism and aesthetical thought was deeply influenced by the Italian philosopher Benedetto Croce, with whom he was in correspondence since 1899. Croce had Spingarn&#x27;s masterwork translated in Italian (&quot;La critica letteraria nel Rinascimento. Saggio sulle origini dello spirito classico nella letteratura moderna&quot;, trad. di Antonio Fusco, pref. di B. Croce, Laterza, Bari 1905). Their correspondence was published in Naples in 2001 (&quot;Carteggio Croce-Spingarn&quot;, a cura di Emanuele Cutinelli-Rendina, Istituto italiano per gli studi storici, Napoli, 2001).

From 1904, his role in academic politics marked him as an independent spirit—too independent for the university&#x27;s autocratic president Nicholas Murray Butler. His differences with the administration ranged from personality conflicts to educational philosophy. Things came to a head in 1910, when he offered a resolution at a university faculty meeting in support of Harry Thurston Peck, a Columbia professor who had been summarily dismissed by Butler because of a public scandal involving a breach-of-promise suit. That precipitated Spingarn&#x27;s dismissal just five weeks later. He became part of a distinguished series of prominent academics who resigned or were dismissed during Butler&#x27;s tenure as president, including George Edward Woodberry, Charles Beard, and James Harvey Robinson—all of them, like Peck and Spingarn, notable progressive scholars.

Without an academic appointment but of independent means, Spingarn continued to publish in his field much as he had before, writing, editing, and contributing to collections of essays. He was commissioned in the U.S. Army and served as a major during World War I. In 1919 he was a co-founder of the publishing firm of Harcourt, Brace and Company.

He also took up the other cause of his life, racial justice. An influential liberal Republican, he helped realize the concept of a unified black movement by joining the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) shortly after its founding and was one of the first Jewish leaders of that organization, serving as chairman of its board from 1913 to 1919, its treasurer from 1919 to 1930, its second president from 1930 until his death in 1939. 

In 1914 he established the Spingarn Medal, awarded annually by the NAACP for outstanding achievement by an African American.

During World War I, according to an NAACP publication, he was instrumental in seeing that &quot;a training camp for Negro officers at Des Moines was established and about 1,000 Negro officers commissioned.&quot; Spingarn also served as an intelligence officer on the Military Intelligence Board (MIB), and provided information to the government about the NAACP&#x27;s membership, which had been accused of having Communist influences.

W. E. B. Du Bois (who had been unsuccessfully recommended by Spingarn for the MIB) dedicated his 1940 autobiography &quot;Dusk of Dawn&quot; to Spingarn&#x27;s memory, calling him &quot;scholar and knight.&quot;

==Personal life and death==
Always interested in gardening, in the years following 1920 he amassed the world&#x27;s largest collection of clematis—250 species—and published the results of his research on the early history of landscape gardening and horticulture in Dutchess County, New York. He served as a member of the Board of Managers for the New York Botanical Garden.

He lived with his wife, Amy Einstein Spingarn, in Manhattan and at their country estate which later became the Troutbeck Inn and Conference Center in Amenia, New York. They had two sons, including Stephen J. Spingarn, and two daughters.

He died after a long illness on July 26, 1939. His will included a bequest to fund the Spingarn Medal in perpetuity.

<text>The Massachusett are a Native American tribe from the region in and around present-day Greater Boston in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The name comes from the Massachusett language term for &quot;At the Great Hill,&quot; referring to the Blue Hills overlooking Boston Harbor from the south.

As some of the first people to make contact with European explorers in New England, the Massachusett and fellow coastal peoples were severely decimated from an outbreak of leptospirosis circa 1619, which had mortality rates as high as 90 percent in these areas. This was followed by devastating impacts of virgin soil epidemics such as smallpox, influenza, scarlet fever and others to which the indigenous people lacked natural immunity. Their territories, on the more fertile and flat coastlines, with access to coastal resources, were mostly taken over by English colonists, as the Massachusett were too few in number to put up any effective resistance.

Missionary John Eliot converted the majority of the Massachusett to Christianity and founded praying towns, where the converted Native Americans were expected to submit to the colonial laws and assimilate to European culture, yet they were allowed to use their language. Through intermediaries, Eliot learned the Massachusett language and even published a translation of the Bible. The language, related to other Eastern Algonquian languages of southern New England, slowly faded, ceasing to serve as the primary language of the Massachusett communities by the 1750s. The language likely went extinct by the dawn of the 19th century.

The last of Massachusett common lands were sold in the early 19th century, loosening the community and social bonds that held the Massachusett families together, and most of the Massachusett were forced to settle amongst neighboring European Americans, but mainly settled the poorer sections of towns where they were segregated with Black Americans, recent immigrants and other Native Americans. Surviving Massachusett assimilated and integrated into the surrounding communities.

== Name ==
=== Endonyms ===

The native name is written () —singular (). It translates as &quot;at the great hill,&quot; referring to the Great Blue Hill, located in Ponkapoag.

=== Exonyms ===
English settlers adopted the term for the name for the people, language, and ultimately as the name of their colony which became the American state of Massachusetts. John Smith first published the term &quot;Massachusett&quot; in 1616. Narragansett people called the tribe Massachêuck.

== Territory ==

The historic territory of the Massachusett people consisted mainly of the hilly, heavily forested and comparatively fertile coastal plain along the southern side of Massachusetts Bay in what is now eastern Massachusetts. Major watersheds in Massachusett territory included the Charles River and the Neponset River.

The Pennacook and Pawtucket lived north of the Massachusett tribe, the Nipmuc to the west, Narragansett and Pequot to the southwest in Rhode Island and Connecticut, and Pokanoket, now known as Wampanoag to the south. Anthropologist John R. Swanton wrote that their territory extended as far north as what is now Salem, Massachusetts, and south to Marshfield and Brockton. He wrote later they claimed lands in the Great Cedar Swamp (near present-day Lakeville), previously controlled by Wampanoag. In contrast, contemporary source Daniel Gookin lumps present day Salem (Naumkeag) with the Pawtucket, but extends the authority of the Massachusett sachem as far north as Lancaster, Massachusetts (Nashaway) and as far west as present day Deerfield, Massachusetts (Pocumtuc).

By the 1660s the Massachusett moved into praying towns, such as Natick and Ponkapoag (Canton).

Swanton lists the following: Massachusett settlements.
== Divisions ==
Massachusett people settled in villages; however, these were organized into larger bands.

Swanton writes about six major bands named for their &quot;sachems&quot; or leaders.
* Chickatawbut, later led by his son Wompatuck and subsequent heirs, additional region/band led by Obtakiest; Massachusett territory south of the Charles River and west of Ponkapoag Pond
* Nanepashemet, north of the Charles River. His territory was divided between his three sons:
::* Winnepurkit, Deer Island and Boston Harbor
::* Wonohaquaham, Winnisimmet and Saugus
::* Montowampate, Massebequash and Lynn
* Manatahqua, around Nahant and Swampscott
* Cato, east of the Concord River
* Nahaton, around the area of Natick
* Cutshamekin, around Dorchester, Sudbury, and Milton.

The appointment of guardians to administer the assets of the Praying Indians and represent them before the colony in 1743 ended the authority of local chiefs and the last vestiges of traditional tribal organization.

== Language ==
The Massachusett language, () ), was an important language of New England as it was also the native language of the Wampanoag, Nauset, Cowesset, and Pawtucket people. Due to its similarity with other closely related languages of the region, a simplified pidgin of it was also used as a regional language of trade and intertribal communication. By the 1750s, Massachusett was no longer the predominant language of the community, and by 1798 only one Massachusett elder of advanced age spoke the language at Natick. Factors that led to the decline of the spoken language include the rapid rates of intermarriage with non-Indian spouses outside the speech community in the mid-18th century, the need for English for employment and participation in general society, the lack of prestige regarding the Indian language, and the dissolution of Indian communities and outmigration of people leading to greater isolation of speakers. The Wampanoag on Noepe, with its more secure land base and larger population, held onto Massachusett as the communal language into the 1770s and went extinct with the death of the last Wampanoag dialect — and last speakers of any Massachusett dialect — in the 1890s.

Efforts to revitalize the language include the Wopanaak Language Reclamation Project led by Jessie Little Doe Baird (Mashpee Wampanoag).

== Early subsistence ==
The Massachusett occupied fertile flatlands. Men and women cleared fields first by burning trees, then by removing stumps. Women grew food crops, but men were involved in tobacco cultivation. Women used clamshell hoes. Women cultivated crops such as northern flint corn, called &quot;weachimineash&quot; in Massachusett, a variety of brands, squashes, and pumpkins. They planted corn in mounds, then planted beans that grew up the cornstalks, and finally the cucurbits, which protected roots and discouraged weeds. This companion planting method is called the Three Sisters.

Other regional plant foods included grapes, strawberries, blackberries, currants, cherries, plums, raspberries, acorns, hickory nuts, chestnuts, butternuts, and leafy greens and pseudocereals such as chenopods. Some of the most well known foods eaten were Nasaump which was a cornmeal porridge. 

Massachusett people lived in conditional sedentary villages built along rivers. Families lived in domed houses, called &quot;wétu&quot; in Massachusett. The base structure of curved wooden support beams was covered with woven mats in the winter or chestnut bark in the summer. Inside, possessions were stored in hemp dogbane bags and baskets of all sizes. Men carved wooden bowls and spoons as dining utensils.

Water transport was by both either carved dugout canoes and birchbark canoes.

== History ==
===European exploration of the 16th century===
The first known European encounter may have been in 1605 when French explorer Samuel de Champlain arrived in Boston Harbor. Champlain met with Massachusett leaders on several of the Boston Harbor Islands and anchored off Shawmut to conduct trade. Champlain was accompanied by an Algonquin guide and his &quot;Massachusett-speaking&quot;—wife who helped translate. Despite mapping the region to promote French interest, colonization support was deterred by the dense population and resistance to contact by some of the Massachusett leaders The region was later mapped as &quot;New England&quot; by John Smith who followed in many of Champlain&#x27;s footsteps, but also made landfall at Wessagusset and Conohasset where he conducted trade and met with the chiefs, and helped promote further English colonial settlement in the region.

===17th-century epidemics===

With increasing levels of contact with European fishermen and explorers, the Massachusett and neighboring tribes were increasingly affected by infectious diseases. With minimal livestock, Indigenous peoples of the Americas lacked immunity to many zoonotic diseases carried by Europeans and the animals they brought. These introduced diseases quickly became a series of virgin soil epidemics that devastated populations. Up to an estimated 90 percent of the Native population of the Massachusetts Bay Colony may have been killed by infectious diseases, known as the &quot;Great Dying,&quot; in the early 17th century.

The deadly epidemic of 1616 through 1619 may have been caused by leptospirosis, a lethal blood infection, likely spread by invasive black rats. This epidemic killed between 33 and 90 percent of the Native American population of New England.

The Massachusetts smallpox epidemic of 1633 further decimated Native populations, as did subsequent smallpox outbreaks, occurring almost every decade.

Devastation by disease and European encroachment upset political balances among New England tribes.

===Relations with the Plymouth Colony (1620–1626)===

English settlers established their first permanent foothold in New England with the founding of the Plymouth Colony by Pilgrims in 1620 near the site of the former Wampanoag village of Patuxet, just a short distance south of the historic boundary with the Massachusett. In 1621, the Pilgrims, led by Myles Standish, met Obbatinewat (Wampanoag), a local sachem loyal to Massasoit. The colonists signed a peace treaty with Obbatinewat, who in turn, introduced the Pilgrims to the Squaw Sachem of Mistick (Massachusett, c. 1590–1650), another leader.

The Wampanoag chief Massasoit (c. 1581–1661) decided to ally with the Pilgrims. The Pilgrims also met with Chickatawbut (Massachusett, d. 1633), the most powerful Massachusett leader of the time. Unlike Massasoit, who favored increasing ties with the new English settlers to help assist against increasing power struggles with the Pequot and the Narragansett, Chickatawbut and other Massachusett leaders were wary of the Pilgrims and their intentions.

Chickatawbut&#x27;s fears were confirmed when the Plymouth Colony expanded to Wessagusset, in Massachusett territory, with the arrival of a new ship of colonists. The new settlers were ill-prepared, even more so than the first Pilgrims, and quickly resorted to trading supplies with the Massachusett. As their situation worsened, the Pilgrims began raiding Massachusett villages for food and supplies. To prevent an attack, Standish ordered a preemptive strike in 1624, which led to the deaths of Pecksuot, Wituwamat, and other Massachusett warriors who were lured under the pretense of peace and negotiation to meet with the colonists. Standish further angered the Massachusett when he led his men deep into their territory to suppress the nascent colony of Merrymount, which had been established by Thomas Morton and which had friendly relations with neighboring Indian tribes. These activities caused the Massachusett to halt trade with the Pilgrims for many years.

===Relations with the Massachusett Bay Colony (1629-1676)===
The Massachusett were unable to isolate themselves from the English settlers. Despite unfriendly relations, Pilgrim settlers continued to arrive. These were mostly English Puritans who wanted to reform rather than leave the Church of England. They wanted the Church to conform to their view of the Protestant Reformation. They settled in Wonnisquam in 1623 and later expanded to Naumkeag in Pawtucket territory. In 1628, the Massachusetts Bay Colony was legally established, with a claim over the lands north of the Plymouth Colony. The boundary between the two colonies mirrored the traditional boundary between the Massachusett and Wampanoag, although many Massachusett, such as those at Titicut and Mattakeesett, were under the claim of the Plymouth Colony.

The Massachusett sachems gave many land deeds to the Pilgrims since they served to rebuff attacks from other tribes. In most cases, it was because the land had already been opened to English colonial settlement, often because the Indians living there had already died off from disease. The sachems began selling land at a price, often with stipulations allowing the Indians to collect, gather, fish or forage, but these arrangements were seldom honored by the Pilgrims. The colonists also did not understand the Indian concept of leasing land from the sachem, and instead thought of their arrangements as permanent land sales. As a result of the rapid loss of land, the Massachusett and other local tribes sent their leaders to Boston for the 1644 Acts of Submission, bringing the Indians under the control of the colonial government and subject to both its laws and conversion attempts from Christian missionaries. By the time of the submission, the Massachusett, a coastal people, had lost access to the sea and their shellfish collection sites.

====Demographic changes====
The Native peoples of New England faced increasing pressures with the increasing levels of colonists in New England. In 1630, the Massachusetts Bay Colony greatly expanded with the arrival of the Winthrop Fleet of 11 ships and almost one thousand colonists beginning the &quot;Great Migration.&quot; By the end of 1640, the colonial population, more than doubled to almost twenty thousand due to the continued arrival of ships bearing Puritan settlers fleeing the increasing levels of religious persecution during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms and natural increase, as settlers often arrived as family units and raised large numbers of children.

The Pilgrims feared the Native presence, as they were a numerical majority when all the different groups of New England were taken together and were dependent on them for survival and trade and the colonists were unable to expand. The Native populations continued to fall, with diseases such as scarlet fever, typhus, measles, mumps, influenza, tuberculosis, whooping cough taking large tolls. However, a smallpox epidemic in 1633 and 1634 also took a very heavy toll, afflicting not only peoples of the coast still recovering from the losses of 1617-1619 but far inland. The Massachusett population dwindled to fewer than two thousand individuals. Other epidemics occurred in 1648 and 1666, although not as devastating, outbreaks of disease continued to inflict heavy tolls well into the 19th century. With so many areas depopulated, the Pilgrims believed that God had cleared New England for their colonization efforts. By the 1630s, the Indians of New England were already a minority in their own lands.

The Massachusett put up little armed resistance to colonial settlement, but other Native peoples of New England who did were subjugated during and after Pequot War in 1638. The colonists aided local Indian tribes in subduing the Pequot, resulting in massacres of Pequot non-combatants, such as in the Mystic Massacre, and the selling of many of the Indians into slavery in Bermuda. The war resulted in the complete destruction of the Pequot as a tribal entity, opening up further land in New England to colonial settlement.

==== Adoption of Christianity ====
As stated in the royal charter of the Massachusetts Bay Colony of 1628, &quot;according to the Courſe of other Corporations in this our Realme of England ... whereby our ſaid People, Inhabitants thee ... maie wynn and incite the Natives of Country, to the Knowledg and Obedience of the onlie true God and Savior of Mankinde, and the Chriſtian Fayth, which ... is the principall Ende of this Plantation.&quot; The colonists were more occupied with their survival and propagation of a Puritan refuge. Although not the first to attempt to Christianize the Natives, it was not until the missionary John Eliot, &quot;Apostle to the Indians&quot;, arrived in the colony and attained considerable success before colonial authorities truly began to invest in the project. Eliot began to learn the language, employing the help of two Indian indentured servants fluent in English, including Cockenoe, a Montaukett originally from Long Island that also spoke Massachusett, and John Sassamon from a Neponset family. Once confident in his abilities, Eliot tried to preach to the Neponset tribe led by Cutshamekin in 1646 but was rebuffed. Later, after resuming more language studies, Eliot preached to the Nonantum tribe led by Waban and had better success, bringing Waban and most of the tribe into Christianity.

The reaction to Christianity was mixed, with many Native leaders continuing to be wary of the Pilgrims and urging their people to remain traditionalists whereas many wholeheartedly embraced it. Those that did embrace the new religion often did so because the traditional medicines and rituals conducted by healers known as &quot;powwow&quot; () failed to protect them from settler encroachment of their lands or the novel pathogens to which they lacked resistance. These Indians hoped that the new God of the settlers would protect them the way that it had protected the settlers and often bought into the belief that they were punished for their wickedness. Other Indians likely joined because they thought they had to. The colonial government had forced the tribal leaders of Indians as far west as Quabaug (Brookfield, Massachusetts) to sign the 1644 Acts of Submission which forced upon the Indians acceptance of the authority of the colonial government and its protection as well opening their people to missionary activity, with many Indian leaders likely still fearful of the settlers due memories of the Pequot War and the fate of the Pequot. Others converted in hopes of removing the stigma of heathenism to improve relations with the settlers, but due to synchretism and cryto-traditional practices conducted in secret by some, the Puritans continued to mistreat the Indians and cast suspicions on the sincerity of the new believers who came to be referred to as &quot;Praying Indians&quot; or () .

==== Praying towns (1651–1675) ====

Eliot urged Waban and the other newly converted Massachusett to settle along a bend of the Quinobequin River but were immediately sued as squatters by the residents of Dorchester. By the time Eliot began to establish the Indian mission, the Massachusett had lost access to the shellfishing beds along the coast and were soon to lose most of their remaining hunting and foraging lands due to the opening of all unfenced, &quot;unimproved&quot; lands. Eliot petitioned the General Court to set aside grants of lands for the Indians &quot;in perpetuity.&quot; Natick was established in 1651, with Ponkapoag following shortly thereafter in 1654. An additional 13 settlements were created, mostly in Nipmuc areas. These communities, settled by Praying Indians, came to be known as &quot;Praying towns&quot; or in Massachusett, () . Ponkapoag, also spelled Punkapog, had 60 residents including Massachusett people in 1674.

The establishment of the Praying towns accomplished several goals. It helped facilitate the goals of Christianization and acculturation as it allowed for easier distribution of the Massachusett-language translations of Eliot&#x27;s Bible and other works. The inhabitants were forced to observe the eight tenements of the &quot;Leaf of Rules&quot; distributed in the Bibles which forbid Indian cultural norms such as consenting pre-marital sex, cracking lice between teeth, avoidance of agriculture by men and re-enforced adoption of Puritan-style modesty and hairstyles. For the colonial government, it brought the Indians fully under the control of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, with the Praying towns occupying a status similar to autonomous English colonial settlements. The traditional power structures remained somewhat intact, as Native peoples recognized both the traditional power systems, but the chiefs and the tribal élite maintained it by adopting the roles of administrators, clerks, translators, teachers, constables, jurors and tax collectors. The confinement benefitted both the desires of Eliot and the colony, and Eliot was often accompanied by Daniel Gookin, the Superintendent to the Indians appointed to ensure cordial relations with the Indians and their adherence to the colonial laws, during his tours of the Praying towns. Similar settlements were established in the Plymouth Colony, such as the Massachusett Praying towns of Titicut and Mattakeeset.

The Massachusett benefited from clear titles of common land where they could plant, hunt and forage, and this likely attracted even more converts since the Praying towns established safe zones away from the constant encroachment, requests for sales of land and harassment. The Massachusett also were able to revive their prestige, which they long held prior to English colonial settlement. Many of the Praying towns were established by Native missionaries drawn from Natick&#x27;s old powerful families, affording them much respect in their adopted communities. The Massachusett began to replace the language of the Nipmuc and greatly leveled dialectal differences across the Massachusett-speaking area, due to the spread of Indian missionaries, but also because Massachusett became the language of literacy, prayer and administration, likely facilitated by its historic use as a regional second language and backed by its use in the translation of the Bible. The Massachusett leaders were also closer to the colonial authorities and thus often chosen to spread official messages, restoring the old power dynamic &quot;vis-à-vis&quot; other tribes.

Life in the Praying towns became a mix of European and Indian customs. The Indians were forced to adopt Puritan habits of modesty, hairstyle, dress, and other cultural norms. They were encouraged to learn European methods of woodworking, carpentry, animal husbandry, and agriculture and Eliot arranged for many Indians to apprentice under settlers to learn these skills. Natick had an independent congregation with a Christian-style church, but the services were conducted in Massachusett with Indian preachers and the parishioners were called by Native drumming. The Praying Indians maintained many aspects of Indigenous culture, such their customary cuisine and foraging and hunting, but melded them with the European culture and Christian religion they were forced to adopt. The mix of religious, cultural, and political control over the Indians was in many ways a precursor to the Indian Reservations that later developed.

====Humiliation of the Indians====

The truce that had existed between the English colonists of the Massachusetts Bay and Plymouth colonies and the local Native peoples was tested. The submission of the local chiefs to the respective colonial governments and adoption of Christianity allowed the Indians to seek redress in the colonial legal system and removed one of the prejudices against them. The Praying Indians of Natick were brought to court several times by colonists living in settlement of Dedham who claimed some of the surrounding land, but with Eliot&#x27;s assistance, most of these attempts failed. Most of the time, however, the Indians failed, as some of the Indian interpreters and chiefs ceded lands to curry favor from the settlers to maintain special privileges, such as the Nipmuc John Wampas, who betrayed the Nipmuc and Massachusett people by selling land to the settlers to which he had no claim, but these sales were upheld in later court challenges. The Pawtucket sachem Wenepoykin, son of Nanepashemet and Squaw Sachem of Mistick, through kinship and family ties laid claim to much of Massachusett territory, and tried several times to petition the courts for lands lost in the turbulence of the 1633 epidemic that took both of his brothers to no avail, with most cases simply dismissed.

===King Philip&#x27;s War (1675-1676)===

The outbreak of King Philip&#x27;s War from 1675 until 1676 was disastrous for both the Indians and colonists of New England. By the early 1670s, Waban and Cutshamekin had begun to address Daniel Gookin and warn of the increasing discontent of the interior Indians such as the Nipmuc people. However, the rebellion was started by the Wampanoag () Metacomet, son of Massasoit who had welcomed and befriended Edward Winslow and the Pilgrims. Metacomet maintained the peace of his father but turned after the never-ending requests for land, but especially the execution of his brother Wamsutta for selling land to Roger Williams, seen by the Wampanoag as a very harsh measure for something outside the Plymouth Colony&#x27;s jurisdiction. In defiance, Metacomet murdered his interpreter to the colonial government, the Massachusett John Sassamon, before fleeing and seeking the support of the disgruntled tribes, culminating in the raid of Swansea in June 1675. Metacomet was able to bring the Narragansett, Nipmuc, Pocomtuc, Podunk, Tunxi peoples into his forces, organizing attacks on numerous outposts such as Sudbury, Lancaster, Turner&#x27;s Falls and other colonial settlements, leading many settlers to flee their lands for fortified towns. The settlers quickly responded by organizing units to attack the Indians loyal to Metacomet, leading to further conflict.

The Massachusett, all of whom had become Praying Indians confined to praying towns, remained neutral during the war but suffered heavy casualties. The Praying Indians were attacked in their fields and harassed by neighboring colonists who had become overwhelmed with panic, hysteria, and anti-Indian sentiment. The Praying towns were also targets of Metacomet&#x27;s forces, raided for supplies, and persuaded or forced to join the fighting. To appease the settlers, the Praying Indians accepted confinement to the Praying towns, curfews, increased supervision, and voluntarily surrendered their weapons.

As the war progressed, the settlers decided to recruit some of the Praying Indians as scouts, guides and to fill the ranks of the colonial militia, with a regiment of Praying Indians, including many Massachusett, recruited by Daniel Gookin sent to face Metacomet&#x27;s warriors at Swansea, but it is known that other Massachusett aided the colonial militias in Lancaster, Brookfield and Mount Hope battles of the war. Metacomet was ultimately killed.

=== Guardianship of the Indians ===
Instead of being absorbed into the general affairs of the now predominantly European region, the colony appointed a commissioner to oversee the Natick in 1743, but commissioners were later appointed for all the extant tribes in the colony. Originally, the commissioner was charged to manage the timber resources, as most of the forests of New England had been felled to make way for farm and pasture, making the timber on Indian lands a valuable commodity. Very quickly, the guardian of Natick came to control the exchange of land, once the domain of the &quot;sachems&quot;, and any funds set up by the sale of Indian products, but mainly land. As the guardians assumed more power and were rarely supervised, many instances of questionable land sales by the guardians and embezzlement of funds have been recorded. The appointment of the guardians reduced the Indians to colonial wards, as they were no longer able to directly address the courts, vote in town elections and removed the power of the Indian chiefs.

Loss of land continued. As forest lands were lost, the Indians could no longer resort to seasonal movements on their land or eke out a living, forcing many into poverty. Land was their only commodity and was often sold by the guardians to pay for treatments for the sick, care of orphans, and debts incurred by Indians, but Indians were also the victims of unfair credit schemes that often forced the land out of their hands. Without land to farm or forage, Indians were forced to seek employment and settle in the &quot;de facto&quot; segregated sections of cities.

=== 19th century ===
Most of the remaining lands set aside &quot;in perpetuity&quot; for the Native peoples had been alienated, leaving a messy patchwork of a few remaining common lands, individual allotments, leased lands, and numerous colonial proprietors in between Indian households.

The end of tribal land did not remove the restrictions of the guardians even if it was the original purpose to have stewards of the land on the Native peoples&#x27; &quot;behalf.&quot; As wards of the colonial and later state government, the Indians were restricted from voting in local elections or seeking redress through the courts on their own. Some of the Indians were supported by annuities established from the funds generated by land sales or initiated by the guardians for their support. The guardians, however, no longer had to maintain the rigorous lists of people associated with the land, which long had been used to segregate the Indians from the non-Indians especially as rates of intermarriage had increased.

The Commonwealth of Massachusetts ordered reports on the condition of the Indians, including the Briggs Report (1849), also known as the Bird Report. These did not mention the Massachusett or the Praying Town of Natick, where Massachusett people had joined in the 17th century.

John Milton Earle launched a far more detailed report in 1859 and published in 1861.

Earle writes, &quot;Of all the tribes which held reservations, and were placed under guardianship by the States, the Natick Tribe is nearest extinct. ... [O]nly two families remain, and one of these is descended equally from the Naticks and the Hassanamiscoes. Their whole number is twelve. ...&quot; He continues, &quot;This tribe has no common lands,&quot; and recommends their remain funds be divided equally among the two surviving families. Earle observes that a few Natick descendants merged into the Nipmuc people and also writes, &quot;There are some others, who claim to be of the Natick Tribe, but the claim appears to have no foundation other than that one of their ancestors formerly resided in Natick, but it is believed that he never was supposed to belong to the tribe.&quot;

=== 20th and 21st centuries ===
In the 105 years between the Massachusetts Enfranchisement Act of 1869 and the creation of the Massachusetts Commission on Indian Affairs by legislative act in 1974, records on the Massachusett people are very few. In 1928, anthropologist Frank G. Speck published &quot;Territorial subdivisions and boundaries of the Wampanoag, Massachusett, and Nauset Indians&quot; which included 17th-century Massachusett history. At Ponkapoag, Speck met Mrs. Chapelle (died 1919) who identified as a Massachusett Indian and whose husband was Mi&#x27;kmaq. Speck estimated that in 1921 a dozen Massachusett and Narragansett descendants of the Ponkapoag praying town lived in what is now Canton.

Several organizations claim descent from historical Massachusett peoples; however, these are unrecognized, meaning they are neither federally recognized tribes nor state-recognized tribes.

As of 2008, the URD is a member of the Coordination of Political Parties for the Defence of the Constitution (CPDC) opposition coalition.

After Kamougué died in 2011 while campaigning, Sande Ngaryimbé took over as the leader of the URD.

<text>Kelp forests are underwater areas with a high density of kelp, which covers a large part of the world&#x27;s coastlines. Smaller areas of anchored kelp are called kelp beds. They are recognized as one of the most productive and dynamic ecosystems on Earth. Although algal kelp forest combined with coral reefs only cover 0.1% of Earth&#x27;s total surface, they account for 0.9% of global primary productivity. Kelp forests occur worldwide throughout temperate and polar coastal oceans. In 2007, kelp forests were also discovered in tropical waters near Ecuador.

Physically formed by brown macroalgae, kelp forests provide a unique habitat for marine organisms and are a source for understanding many ecological processes. Over the last century, they have been the focus of extensive research, particularly in trophic ecology, and continue to provoke important ideas that are relevant beyond this unique ecosystem. For example, kelp forests can influence coastal oceanographic patterns and provide many ecosystem services.

However, the influence of humans has often contributed to kelp forest degradation. Of particular concern are the effects of overfishing nearshore ecosystems, which can release herbivores from their normal population regulation and result in the overgrazing of kelp and other algae. This can rapidly result in transitions to barren landscapes where relatively few species persist. Already due to the combined effects of overfishing and climate change, kelp forests have all but disappeared in many especially vulnerable places, such as Tasmania&#x27;s east coast and the coast of Northern California. The implementation of marine protected areas is one management strategy useful for addressing such issues, since it may limit the impacts of fishing and buffer the ecosystem from additive effects of other environmental stressors.

== Kelp ==
The term kelp refers to marine algae belonging to the order Laminariales (phylum: Ochrophyta). Though not considered a taxonomically diverse order, kelps are highly diverse structurally and functionally. The most widely recognized species are the giant kelps (&quot;Macrocystis&quot; spp.), although numerous other genera such as &quot;Laminaria&quot;, &quot;Ecklonia&quot;, &quot;Lessonia&quot;, &quot;Nereocystis&quot;, &quot;Alaria&quot;, and &quot;Eisenia&quot; are described.

A wide range of sea life uses kelp forests for protection or food, including fish. In the North Pacific kelp forests, particularly rockfish, and many invertebrates, such as amphipods, shrimp, marine snails, bristle worms, and brittle stars. Many marine mammals and birds are also found, including seals, sea lions, whales, sea otters, gulls, terns, snowy egrets, great blue herons, and cormorants, as well as some shore birds.

Frequently considered an ecosystem engineer, kelp provides a physical substrate and habitat for kelp forest communities. In algae (kingdom Protista), the body of an individual organism is known as a thallus rather than as a plant (kingdom Plantae). The morphological structure of a kelp thallus is defined by three basic structural units:
* The holdfast is a root-like mass that anchors the thallus to the sea floor, though unlike true roots it is not responsible for absorbing and delivering nutrients to the rest of the thallus.
* The stipe is analogous to a plant stalk, extending vertically from the holdfast and providing a support framework for other morphological features.
* The fronds are leaf- or blade-like attachments extending from the stipe, sometimes along its full length, and are the sites of nutrient uptake and photosynthetic activity.
In addition, many kelp species have pneumatocysts, or gas-filled bladders, usually located at the base of fronds near the stipe. These structures provide the necessary buoyancy for kelp to maintain an upright position in the water column.

The environmental factors necessary for kelp to survive include hard substrate (usually rock or sand), high nutrients (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus), and light (minimum annual irradiance dose &gt; 50 E m−2). Especially productive kelp forests tend to be associated with areas of significant oceanographic upwelling, a process that delivers cool, nutrient-rich water from depth to the ocean&#x27;s mixed surface layer. Water flow and turbulence facilitate nutrient assimilation across kelp fronds throughout the water column. Water clarity affects the depth to which sufficient light can be transmitted. In ideal conditions, giant kelp (&quot;Macrocystis&quot; spp.) can grow as much as 30–60 cm vertically per day. Some species, such as &quot;Nereocystis&quot;, are annuals, while others such as &quot;Eisenia&quot; are perennials, living for more than 20 years. In perennial kelp forests, maximum growth rates occur during upwelling months (typically spring and summer) and die-backs correspond to reduced nutrient availability, shorter photoperiods, and increased storm frequency.

Kelps are primarily associated with temperate and arctic waters worldwide. Of the more dominant genera, &quot;Laminaria&quot; is mainly associated with both sides of the Atlantic Ocean and the coasts of China and Japan; &quot;Ecklonia&quot; is found in Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa; and &quot;Macrocystis&quot; occurs throughout the northeastern and southeastern Pacific Ocean, Southern Ocean archipelagos, and in patches around Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. The region with the greatest diversity of kelps (&gt;20 species) is the northeastern Pacific, from north of San Francisco, California, to the Aleutian Islands, Alaska.

Although kelp forests are unknown in tropical surface waters, a few species of &quot;Laminaria&quot; have been known to occur exclusively in tropical deep waters. This general absence of kelp from the tropics is believed to be mostly due to insufficient nutrient levels associated with warm, oligotrophic waters. One recent study spatially overlaid the requisite physical parameters for kelp with mean oceanographic conditions and produced a model predicting the existence of subsurface kelps throughout the tropics worldwide to depths of . For a hotspot in the Galapagos Islands, the local model was improved with fine-scale data and tested; the research team found thriving kelp forests in all eight of their sampled sites, all of which had been predicted by the model, thus validating their approach. This suggests that their global model might actually be fairly accurate, and if so, kelp forests would be prolific in tropical subsurface waters worldwide. The importance of this contribution has been rapidly acknowledged within the scientific community and has prompted an entirely new trajectory of kelp forest research, highlighting the potential for kelp forests to provide marine organisms spatial refuge under climate change and providing possible explanations for evolutionary patterns of kelps worldwide.

== Ecosystem architecture ==

The architecture of a kelp forest ecosystem is based on its physical structure, which influences the associated species that define its community structure. Structurally, the ecosystem includes three guilds of kelp and two guilds occupied by other algae:
*Canopy kelps include the largest species and often constitute floating canopies that extend to the ocean surface (e.g., &quot;Macrocystis&quot; and &quot;Alaria&quot;).
*Stipitate kelps generally extend a few meters above the sea floor and can grow in dense aggregations (e.g., &quot;Eisenia&quot; and &quot;Ecklonia&quot;).
*Prostrate kelps lie near and along the sea floor (e.g., &quot;Laminaria&quot;).
*The benthic assemblage is composed of other algal species (e.g., filamentous and foliose functional groups, articulated corallines) and sessile organisms along the ocean bottom.
*Encrusting coralline algae directly and often extensively cover geologic substrate.

Multiple kelp species often co-exist within a forest; the term understory canopy refers to the stipitate and prostrate kelps. For example, a &quot;Macrocystis&quot; canopy may extend many meters above the seafloor towards the ocean surface, while an understory of the kelps &quot;Eisenia&quot; and &quot;Pterygophora&quot; reaches upward only a few meters. Beneath these kelps, a benthic assemblage of foliose red algae may occur. The dense vertical infrastructure with overlying canopy forms a system of microenvironments similar to those observed in a terrestrial forest, with a sunny canopy region, a partially shaded middle, and darkened seafloor. Each guild has associated organisms, which vary in their levels of dependence on the habitat, and the assemblage of these organisms can vary with kelp morphologies. For example, in California, &quot;Macrocystis pyrifera&quot; forests, the nudibranch &quot;Melibe leonina&quot;, and skeleton shrimp &quot;Caprella californica&quot; are closely associated with surface canopies; the kelp perch &quot;Brachyistius frenatus&quot;, rockfish &quot;Sebastes&quot; spp., and many other fishes are found within the stipitate understory; brittle stars and turban snails &quot;Tegula&quot; spp. are closely associated with the kelp holdfast, while various herbivores, such as sea urchins and abalone, live under the prostrate canopy; many seastars, hydroids, and benthic fishes live among the benthic assemblages; solitary corals, various gastropods, and echinoderms live over the encrusting coralline algae. In addition, pelagic fishes and marine mammals are loosely associated with kelp forests, usually interacting near the edges as they visit to feed on resident organisms.

== Trophic ecology ==

Classic studies in kelp forest ecology have largely focused on trophic interactions (the relationships between organisms and their food webs), particularly the understanding and top-down trophic processes. Bottom-up processes are generally driven by the abiotic conditions required for primary producers to grow, such as availability of light and nutrients, and the subsequent transfer of energy to consumers at higher trophic levels. For example, the occurrence of kelp is frequently correlated with oceanographic upwelling zones, which provide unusually high concentrations of nutrients to the local environment. This allows kelp to grow and subsequently support herbivores, which in turn support consumers at higher trophic levels. By contrast, in top-down processes, predators limit the biomass of species at lower trophic levels through consumption. In the absence of predation, these lower-level species flourish because resources that support their energetic requirements are not limiting. In a well-studied example from Alaskan kelp forests, sea otters (&quot;Enhydra lutris&quot;) control populations of herbivorous sea urchins through predation. When sea otters are removed from the ecosystem (for example, by human exploitation), urchin populations are released from predatory control and grow dramatically. This leads to increased herbivore pressure on local kelp stands. Deterioration of the kelp itself results in the loss of physical ecosystem structure and subsequently, the loss of other species associated with this habitat. In Alaskan kelp forest ecosystems, sea otters are the keystone species that mediates this trophic cascade. In Southern California, kelp forests persist without sea otters and the control of herbivorous urchins is instead mediated by a suite of predators including lobsters and large fishes, such as the California sheephead. The effect of removing one predatory species in this system differs from Alaska because redundancy exists in the trophic levels and other predatory species can continue to regulate urchins. However, the removal of multiple predators can effectively release urchins from predator pressure and allow the system to follow trajectories towards kelp forest degradation. Similar examples exist in Nova Scotia, South Africa, Australia, and Chile. The relative importance of top-down versus bottom-up control in kelp forest ecosystems and the strengths of trophic interactions continue to be the subject of considerable scientific investigation.

The transition from macroalgal (i.e. kelp forest) to denuded landscapes dominated by sea urchins (or ‘urchin barrens’) is a widespread phenomenon, often resulting from trophic cascades like those described above; the two phases are regarded as alternative stable states of the ecosystem. The recovery of kelp forests from barren states has been documented following dramatic perturbations, such as urchin disease or large shifts in thermal conditions. Recovery from intermediate states of deterioration is less predictable and depends on a combination of abiotic factors and biotic interactions in each case.

Though urchins are usually the dominant herbivores, others with significant interaction strengths include seastars, isopods, kelp crabs, and herbivorous fishes. In many cases, these organisms feed on kelp that has been dislodged from substrate and drifts near the ocean floor rather than expend energy searching for intact thalli on which to feed. When sufficient drift kelp is available, herbivorous grazers do not exert pressure on attached thalli; when drift subsidies are unavailable, grazers directly impact the physical structure of the ecosystem. Many studies in Southern California have demonstrated that the availability of drift kelp specifically influences the foraging behavior of sea urchins. Drift kelp and kelp-derived particulate matter have also been important in subsidizing adjacent habitats, such as sandy beaches and the rocky intertidal.

== Patch dynamics ==
Another major area of kelp forest research has been directed at understanding the spatial-temporal patterns of kelp patches. Not only do such dynamics affect the physical landscape, but they also affect species that associate with kelp for refuge or foraging activities. Large-scale environmental disturbances have offered important insights concerning mechanisms and ecosystem resilience. Examples of environmental disturbances include:
*Acute and chronic pollution events have been shown to impact southern California kelp forests, though the intensity of the impact seems to depend on both the nature of the contaminants and duration of exposure. Pollution can include sediment deposition and eutrophication from sewage, industrial byproducts and contaminants like PCBs and heavy metals (for example, copper, zinc), runoff of organophosphates from agricultural areas, anti-fouling chemicals used in harbors and marinas (for example, TBT and creosote) and land-based pathogens like fecal coliform bacteria.
*Catastrophic storms can remove surface kelp canopies through wave activity, but usually leave understory kelps intact; they can also remove urchins when little spatial refuge is available. Interspersed canopy clearings create a seascape mosaic where sunlight penetrates deeper into the kelp forest and species that are normally light-limited in the understory can flourish. Similarly, substrate cleared of kelp holdfasts can provide space for other sessile species to establish themselves and occupy the seafloor, sometimes directly competing with juvenile kelp and even inhibiting their settlement.
* El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events involve the depression of oceanographic thermoclines, severe reductions of nutrient input, and changes in storm patterns. Stress due to warm water and nutrient depletion can increase the susceptibility of kelp to storm damage and herbivorous grazing, sometimes even prompting phase shifts to urchin-dominated landscapes. In general, oceanographic conditions (that is, water temperature, currents) influence the recruitment success of kelp and its competitors, which clearly affect subsequent species interactions and kelp forest dynamics.
*Overfishing higher trophic levels that naturally regulate herbivore populations is also recognized as an important stressor in kelp forests. As described in the previous section, the drivers and outcomes of trophic cascades are important for understanding spatial-temporal patterns of kelp forests.

In addition to ecological monitoring of kelp forests before, during, and after such disturbances, scientists try to tease apart the intricacies of kelp forest dynamics using experimental manipulations. By working on smaller spatial-temporal scales, they can control for the presence or absence of specific biotic and abiotic factors to discover the operative mechanisms. For example, in southern Australia, manipulations of kelp canopy types demonstrated that the relative amount of &quot;Ecklonia radiata&quot; in a canopy could be used to predict understory species assemblages; consequently, the proportion of &quot;E. radiata&quot; can be used as an indicator of other species occurring in the environment.

== Human use ==

Kelp forests have been important to human existence for thousands of years. Indeed, many now theorise that the first colonisation of the Americas was due to fishing communities following the Pacific kelp forests during the last ice age. One theory contends that the kelp forests that would have stretched from northeast Asia to the American Pacific coast would have provided many benefits to ancient boaters The kelp forests would have provided many sustenance opportunities, as well as acting as a type of buffer from rough water. Besides these benefits, researchers believe that the kelp forests might have helped early boaters navigate, acting as a type of &quot;kelp highway&quot;. Theorists also suggest that the kelp forests would have helped these ancient colonists by providing a stable way of life and preventing them from having to adapt to new ecosystems and develop new survival methods even as they traveled thousands of miles.

Modern economies are based on fisheries of kelp-associated species such as lobster and rockfish. Humans can also harvest kelp directly to feed aquaculture species such as abalone and to extract the compound alginic acid, which is used in products like toothpaste and antacids. Kelp forests are valued for recreational activities such as SCUBA diving and kayaking; the industries that support these sports represent one benefit related to the ecosystem and the enjoyment derived from these activities represents another. All of these are examples of ecosystem services provided specifically by kelp forests. The Monterey Bay aquarium was the first aquarium to exhibit an alive kelp forest.

=== As carbon sequesters ===
Kelp forests grow in rocky places along the shore that are constantly eroding carrying material out to the deep sea. The kelp then sinks to the ocean floor and store the carbon where is it unlikely to be disturbed by human activity. Researchers from the University of Western Australia estimated kelp forest around Australia sequestered 1.3-2.8 teragrams of carbon per year which is 27–34% of the total annual blue carbon sequestered in the Australian continent by tidal marshes, mangrove forests and seagrass beds. Every year 200 million tons of carbon dioxide are being sequestered by macroalgae such as kelp.

== Threats and management ==

Given the complexity of kelp forests – their variable structure, geography, and interactions – they pose a considerable challenge to environmental managers. Extrapolating even well-studied trends to the future is difficult because interactions within the ecosystem will change under variable conditions, not all relationships in the ecosystem are understood, and the nonlinear thresholds to transitions are not yet recognized.

Major issues of concern include marine pollution and water quality, kelp harvesting and fisheries, invasive species, and climate change. The most pressing threat to kelp forest preservation may be the overfishing of coastal ecosystems, which by removing higher trophic levels facilitates their shift to depauperate urchin barrens. The maintenance of biodiversity is recognized as a way of generally stabilizing ecosystems and their services through mechanisms such as functional compensation and reduced susceptibility to foreign species invasions. More recently, the 2022 IPCC report states that kelp and other seaweeds in most regions are undergoing mass mortalities from high temperature extremes and range shifts from warming, as they are stationary and cannot adapt quick enough to deal with the rapidly increasing temperature of the Earth and thus, the ocean.

In many places, managers have opted to regulate the harvest of kelp and/or the taking of kelp forest species by fisheries. While these may be effective in one sense, they do not necessarily protect the entirety of the ecosystem. Marine protected areas (MPAs) offer a unique solution that encompasses not only target species for harvesting, but also the interactions surrounding them and the local environment as a whole. Direct benefits of MPAs to fisheries (for example, spillover effects) have been well documented around the world. Indirect benefits have also been shown for several cases among species such as abalone and fishes in Central California. Most importantly, MPAs can be effective at protecting existing kelp forest ecosystems and may also allow for the regeneration of those that have been affected.

=== Kelp forest restoration in California ===
In the 2010s, Northern California lost 95% of its kelp ecosystems due to marine heatwaves.

Kelp bed recovery efforts in California are primarily focusing on sea urchin removal, both by scuba divers, and by sea otters, which are natural predators.

A brown alga, &quot;Sargassum horneri&quot;, an invasive species first spotted in 2003, has also been a concern.

The Sunflower sea star is an important keystone species which helps control sea urchin abundance, but an outbreak of Sea star wasting disease and a vulnerability to climate change has led to its critical endangerment.

Researchers at the Bodega Marine Laboratory of UC Davis are developing replanting strategies, and volunteers of the Orange County Coastkeeper group are replanting giant kelp. Humboldt State University began cultivating bull kelp in its research farm in 2021.

Research efforts at the state level to prevent kelp forest collapse in California were announced in July 2020.

At the federal level, H.R. 4458, the Keeping Ecosystems Living and Productive (KELP) Act, introduced July 29, 2021, seeks to establish a new grant program within NOAA for kelp forest restoration.

Ocean Rainforest, a Faroe Islands-based company, secured $4.5 million in U.S. government funding to grow giant kelp on an 86-acre farm off the coast of Santa Barbara, California.

== Global conservation efforts ==
The United Nations Environment Programme Norwegian Blue Forests Network 2023 report titled &#x27;Into the Blue: Securing a Sustainable Future for Kelp Forests&#x27; documents a global decline in kelp forests, with an annual reduction rate of 1.8%. Over the past 50 years, 40–60% of these ecosystems have degraded due to factors such as climate change, poor water quality, and overfishing. The report underscores the urgency of implementing global conservation efforts and emphasizes the need for international cooperation to adopt area-based management strategies. These strategies aim to mitigate the aforementioned impacts and enhance the resilience and sustainability of kelp forests.

Kelp forest restoration, practiced in 16 countries over 300 years, has gained momentum, particularly from 2009 to 2019, involving diverse societal sectors such as academia, governments, and businesses. Large-scale restoration successes demonstrate its feasibility, with the best outcomes often near existing kelp forests, emphasizing the importance of preventing their decline. However, challenges persist, including the need for cost-effective methods, funding mechanisms, and adaptations to climate change. This restoration work not only supports ecological recovery but also offers significant social and economic benefits, aligning with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and underscores the importance of multi-sector collaboration.

<text>Élie-Abel Carrière (4 June 1818 – 17 August 1896) was a French botanist, based in Paris. He was a leading authority on conifers in the period 1850–1870, describing many new species, and the new genera &quot;Tsuga&quot;, &quot;Keteleeria&quot; and &quot;Pseudotsuga&quot;. His most important work was the &quot;Traité Général des Conifères&quot;, published in 1855, with a second, extensively revised edition in 1867.

There is a brief biography of Carrière, in English, in the journal &quot;Brittonia&quot;.

In addition to his studies of conifers, he published a number of works in the field of horticulture:
* &quot;Guide pratique du jardinier multiplicateur: ou art de propager les végétaux par semis, boutures, greffes, etc&quot;. (1856)-- book on propagation of plants by seeds, cuttings, grafts.
* &quot;Flore des jardins de l&#x27;Europe: manuel général des plantes, arbres et arbustes, comprenant leur origine, description, culture : leur application aux jardins d&#x27;agrément, à l&#x27;agriculture, aux forêts, aux usages domestiques, aux arts et à l&#x27;industrie. Et classés selon la méthode de Decandolle par Jacques et Hérincq&quot;, (Flora of the gardens of Europe: general handbook of plants, trees and shrubs, including their origin, description, culture: their application to ornamental gardens, to agriculture, forests, domestic, arts and industry. And classified according to the method by Augustin Pyramus de Candolle with Henri Antoine Jacques and François Hérincq) / Paris: Librairie agricole de la Maison rustique, (1857)
* &quot;Entretiens familiers sur l&#x27;horticulture&quot; (1860)

* &quot;Semis et mise à fruit des arbres fruitiers&quot; (1881).

In 1880, he described Iris orchioides.

<text>Louis de Noailles, 4th Duke of Noailles (21 April 1713 in Versailles22 August 1793 in Saint-Germain-en-Laye) was a French peer and Marshal of France. 

==Early life==
He was the son of Françoise Charlotte d&#x27;Aubigné, niece of Madame de Maintenon, and a nephew of Marie Victoire de Noailles, daughter-in-law of Louis XIV of France.

==Career==
Louis bore the title of Duke of Ayen until his father&#x27;s death in 1766 when he became Duke of Noailles. 

He served in most of the wars of the eighteenth century without particular distinction but was nevertheless made a Marshal of France in 1775. He refused to emigrate during the Revolution but escaped the guillotine by dying in August 1793.

The duke&#x27;s widow, granddaughter, and daughter-in-law were guillotined on 22 July 1794, twenty-five days after his brother and sister, sister-in-law, their daughter-in-law, and niece had met the same fate. Another granddaughter, Adrienne, wife of Gilbert du Motier, marquis de La Fayette, was saved due to the efforts of James Monroe, then America&#x27;s Minister to France. Adrienne and her husband are buried with the Noailles and the other nobles who fell to the guillotine at Picpus Cemetery.

==Personal life==

On 25 February 1737 he married Catherine Françoise Charlotte de Cossé-Brissac, with whom he had four children, two sons and two daughters:

* &quot;Jean&quot;-Louis-Paul-François de Noailles (1739–1824), who married Henriette Anne Louise d&#x27;Aguesseau in 1755. After her death in 1794, he married Baroness Wilhelmine Justine von Mosheim in 1796.
* Adrienne Catherine de Noailles (1741–1813), who married René de Froulay, Count of Tessé, Marquis de Lavardin, a grandson of René de Froulay de Tessé in 1755.
* &quot;Emmanuel&quot;-Marie-Louis de Noailles (1743–1822), who married Charlotte Françoise de Hallencourt de Dromesnil.
* Philippine Louise de Noailles.

Louis de Noailles was succeeded by his eldest son, Jean de Noailles. The titles remain among the 4th Duke&#x27;s descendants in the 21st century.

<text>The Pan-African Union for Social Democracy (, UPADS) is a political party in the Republic of the Congo headed by Pascal Lissouba, who was President from 1992 to 1997. It has been the country&#x27;s main opposition party since Lissouba&#x27;s ouster in 1997. Pascal Tsaty-Mabiala has been Secretary-General of UPADS since 2006.

== History ==
In the 1991–1992 transition to multiparty elections, UPADS was part of the National Alliance for Democracy (AND), which also included the Congolese Labour Party (PCT). In the parliamentary election held in June–July 1992, UPADS won 39 out of the 125 seats and, together with its AND allies (mainly the PCT), gained a slight majority of 64 seats in the National Assembly. UPADS leader Pascal Lissouba was victorious over Bernard Kolélas, the leader of the Congolese Movement for Democracy and Integral Development (MCDDI), in the second round of the August 1992 presidential election, winning 61.32% of the vote.

A UPADS-led government, with Stéphane Maurice Bongho-Nouarra as prime minister, was appointed after Lissouba took office, but the PCT withdrew from the pro-Lissouba alliance and joined the opposition after it received only three positions in the government, causing the alliance to lose its parliamentary majority. The Union for Democratic Renewal (URD) opposition coalition and the PCT were therefore successful in defeating Bongho-Nouarra&#x27;s government in a no-confidence vote on 31 October 1992. Lissouba consequently dissolved the National Assembly and called a new election; facing protests about this, he accepted the formation of a national unity government dominated by the URD and PCT in the lead-up to the election. In the 1993 parliamentary election, the Presidential Tendency, of which UPADS was the main component, won a majority of the seats decided in the first round, 62 out of 114; UPADS itself won 49 out of the 62. The URD and PCT opposition denounced this election as fraudulent and refused to participate in the second round, in which the Presidential Tendency won an additional seven seats; however, these results were cancelled and a second round revote was held in October 1993, in which the Presidential Tendency won only three of the 11 available seats.

Lissouba was ousted at the end of a civil war in 1997 and fled into exile, while Denis Sassou Nguesso of the PCT became president. A faction of UPADS, led by Martin Mberi, recognized the legitimacy of Sassou Nguesso, and Mberi was included in the government from 1997 to June 2001 as Minister of Construction.

Joseph Kignoumbi Kia Mboungou was the UPADS presidential candidate in the presidential election held on 10 March 2002; he took second place but received only 2.76% of the vote, with Sassou Nguesso winning by an overwhelming margin according to official results. In the parliamentary election held on 26 May and 23 June 2002, UPADS won two out of 137 seats.

The party&#x27;s first extraordinary congress was held on 27–28 December 2006, with 954 delegates. On this occasion Pascal Tsaty-Mabiala was elected as the Secretary-General of the party, succeeding Christophe Moukouéké. Also elected at the congress were a 601-member National Council, a 135-member Political Bureau, and 25 Vice-Presidents; the Vice-Presidents included major figures in the party such as Joseph Kignoumbi Kia Mboungou, Alphonse Poaty-Souchlaty, Ange Edouard Poungui, Clément Mouamba, Jean Itadi, and Mireille Lissouba.

Despite being in the opposition, UPADS chose to participate in the June 2007 parliamentary election, which was boycotted by many other opposition groups. The party put forward about 50 candidates. The party received three seats out the 46 declared in the first round. Tsaty-Mabiala said that the party would only participate in the second round of the election in July if the electoral rolls were improved, voter registration cards were properly distributed, and the composition of the electoral commissions was changed. He also said that the second round should be delayed to allow time for these things to be done. The election was delayed by two weeks.

In results announced after the second round, the party had a total of 10 seats in the National Assembly. Tsaty-Mabiala denounced the results as fraudulent on 11 August and said that the election was neither transparent nor fair. He alleged that five UPADS candidates, in Mossendjo, Moutamba, Nkayi, Mabombo and Dolisie electoral districts, had won but were deprived of victory in the results. The party appealed to the Constitutional Court. Ibovi subsequently announced a correction in the results for one of the electoral districts UPADS claimed to have won, Mabombo (in Bouenza Region), which had gone to Marcel Kalla in the previous results, but which Ibovi said was actually won by the UPADS candidate, Christophe Moukouéké. This raised the number of UPADS seats to 11.

In early October 2007, Tsaty-Mabiala said that UPADS would not participate in any national unity government because there had not been an agreement on resolving the country&#x27;s problems.

At a meeting on 24–25 August 2008, the UPADS Political Bureau expelled nine executive members from the party; these included Christophe Moukouéké and Victor Tamba-Tamba, both founding members of UPADS. This decision was said to have been taken in order to restore harmony and discipline within the party.

Along with the Union for Democracy and the Republic (UDR-Mwinda) and the Rally for Democracy and Development (RDD), UPADS formed the Alliance for the New Republic opposition coalition on 11 May 2007. Complaining that the 2007 parliamentary election and the 2008 local elections were &quot;masquerades&quot;, this coalition withdrew from participation in national and local electoral commissions in August 2008. It wanted a new and independent electoral commission, in addition to an &quot;all-inclusive national dialogue&quot; prior to the 2009 presidential election.

Former Prime Minister Ange Edouard Poungui was chosen as the UPADS candidate for the 2009 presidential election by the UPADS National Council in a primary election on 30 November 2008. His sole rival for the nomination, Joseph Kignoumbi Kia Mboungou, withdrew from the vote, complaining of &quot;lack of transparency in the process&quot;, and Poungui, as the only candidate, received about 85% of the vote. However its candidacy was later rejected by the Contitutional Court on the ground that he had failed to establish his continuous residency in Congo-Brazzaville for at least two years.

In the three following parliamentary elections, always under the leadership of Pascal Tsaty Mabiala, UPADS never managed to weaken PCT&#x27;s absolute majority, remaining the main opposition force (tied with UDH-Yuki in 2017 and 2022) but always obtaining between 7 and 8 seats. Tsaty Mabiala was also the party&#x27;s presidential candidate for the 2016 presidential election, finishing fourth with 4.67% of the votes, while the party did not contest the following presidential election in 2021.

<text>Andréia Suntaque (born 14 September 1977), often referred to as simply Andréia, is a Brazilian former footballer who played as a goalkeeper.

Andréia was in Brazil&#x27;s squad at the 1999 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, when she was playing for São Paulo FC. She was a member of the Brazilian team that won the silver medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics and the 2008 Summer Olympics.

Andréia was a member of the Brazil Women&#x27;s Squad at the 2003 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup. The next year Brazil were the runner-up at the 2004 Summer Olympics. In 2007 Brazil were the runner-up in the 2007 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup after losing 2–0 in the final to Germany. The next year in the 2008 Summer Olympics Andréia lost her starting spot to Barbara, because Barbara &quot;Would give Brazil a better chance to claim &quot;Their First Ever Major Title&quot;. But Brazil failed to capitalize, they lost the final 1–0 against the United States in Extra Time. After the Game Andréia and Barbara were seen hugging each other and lying on the ground crying. In 2011 the Brazil squad were ready to get in level terms on the world stage. They walked through their group winning all the games. They once again meet the USA squad in the Quarter Finals. In the second minute of the game a cross was sent in on the ground from Shannon Boxx, and then kicked into the Brazilian goal by a Brazilian defender Daiane. Marta went on to score twice to give Brazil the lead. Brazil thought they had a time management plan, but in the 122&#x27; minute USA midfielder Megan Rapinoe sent a ball into the Brazilian box. Andréia came way off her line missing the ball allowing US striker Abby Wambach to score the game tying header with just seconds left. The two teams went into a PK shoot out. On the first kick by Shannon Boxx, Andréia appeared to save the PK, but actually was many yards off her line. Boxx took another PK and slipped it right past Andréia. Then Carli Lloyd, Abby Wambach, Megan Rapinoe, and Ali Krieger scored their PK&#x27;s to beat the Brazilian and send them out of the World Cup. In 2015 Andréia wasn&#x27;t selected for the 2015 Women&#x27;s World Cup Brazilian squad.

<text>The Union for Democratic Renewal (&quot;Union pour la Renouveau Démocratique&quot;) was a coalition of political parties in the Republic of the Congo. The coalition was led by Bernard Kolélas, who was also the leader of the coalition&#x27;s largest party, the Congolese Movement for Democracy and Integral Development (MCDDI). The URD parties supported the transitional government of Prime Minister André Milongo (1991–1992) and opposed the National Alliance for Democracy (AND), which included the Pan-African Union for Social Democracy (UPADS) and the Congolese Labour Party (PCT). In the parliamentary election held in June–July 1992, the AND parties won a slight majority of seats in the National Assembly and UPADS leader Pascal Lissouba was victorious over Kolélas in the August 1992 presidential election.

Following the 1992 parliamentary election, the seven URD parties held 40 out of 125 seats in the National Assembly. After Lissouba took office, he gave the PCT only a small portion of positions in the government, causing the PCT to break with Lissouba and ally with URD instead; therefore, the URD and PCT together gained a parliamentary majority, enabling it to force out the government appointed by Lissouba. Lissouba consequently dissolved the National Assembly and called for a new parliamentary election, and after protests occurred, Lissouba accepted the formation of a national unity government in the lead-up to the election, with most of its positions going to the URD and PCT. In the new election, however, the pro-Lissouba alliance was victorious, and the URD and PCT alleged fraud.

Four members of the URD were included in the government of Prime Minister Joachim Yhombi-Opango that was named on January 23, 1995. These included Col. Philippe Bikinkita as Minister of the Interior in charge of Security and Urban Development, along with three Minister-Delegates.

The Rally for Democracy and Social Progress (RDPS) was part of the URD, as was the National Party (PANA), the Patriotic Union for Democracy and Progress (UPDP), and the Congolese Social Democratic Party (PSDC).

<text>William &quot;Bill&quot; Chornopyski (May 27, 1922 – September 11, 2002) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was associated with the New Democratic Party of Manitoba for many years, but was elected to the provincial legislature in 1988 as a member of the Manitoba Liberal Party.

The son of George and Verna Chornopyski, he was born in Sundown, Manitoba, and served in the Canadian Forces during World War II. He was employed by the Canadian Pacific Railway from 1944 to 1966, and worked as a sales executive at General Motors from 1966 to 1971. From 1971 to 1973, he was the owner and operator of the Arlington Athletic Club. Chornopyski also served as president of the Burrows Constituency NDP (provincial), and as secretary of the Winnipeg North federal NDP organization. He was married to Elsie Wagner and had four children.

In 1974, Chornopyski was elected as a councillor in the city of Winnipeg. He served in this capacity until 1986, and also became deputy mayor of the city in 1982. He was a founder of Winnipeg&#x27;s &quot;Block Parent Program&quot; in this period and served on several community boards, as well as being on the executive of the Ukrainian Legion Branch #141.

In the 1980s, Chornopyski was an opponent of NDP Premier Howard Pawley&#x27;s plans to legally entrench French-language services in the province. He appears to have left the NDP over this issue around 1984, at roughly the same time as longtime party MLA and Edward Schreyer-era cabinet minister Russell Doern. In the provincial election of 1986, Chornopyski contested the riding of Burrows as an independent candidate, and lost to incumbent New Democrat Conrad Santos by 2110 votes. Later in the year, he lost his seat on city council to Terry Wachniak by 46 votes.

In the provincial election of 1988, Chornopyski ran as a Liberal in Burrows and defeated NDP candidate Doug Martindale by 109 votes.

The Liberals increased their parliamentary representation from one seat to twenty in the 1988 election, and Chornopyski sat with the official opposition in parliament. His time in the provincial legislature proved to be short-lived, however — in the provincial election of 1990, he lost to Martindale by over 2000 votes amid a general decline in Liberal fortunes. He did not seek a return to public office, instead going back to farming, and died at the Morris General Hospital in 2002.

<text>Daniel Mark Epstein (born October 25, 1948) is an American poet, dramatist, and biographer. His poetry has been noted for its erotic and spiritual lyricism, as well as its power—in several dramatic monologues—in capturing crucial moments of American history. While he has continued to publish poetry he is more widely known for his biographies of Nat King Cole, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Bob Dylan and Abraham Lincoln, and his radio plays, &quot;Star of Wonder,&quot; and &quot;The Two Menorahs,&quot; which have become holiday mainstays on National Public Radio.

==Early life==

Daniel Mark Epstein was born in Washington D.C., the son of businessman Donald David Epstein, and Louise Tillman, a homemaker. His younger sister is the journalist Linda Stevens. Epstein grew up in West Hyattsville, Maryland, suburban Washington, and his mother&#x27;s home town of Vienna on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. Many of his poems, plays, and short stories are inspired by life in Dorchester County and Vienna in the mid-twentieth century. He began writing poetry when he was in grade school. Some poems he wrote in his early teens came to the attention of Elliot Coleman, the legendary founder of the Writing Seminars at Johns Hopkins University. Coleman invited him to Baltimore, and offered advice and encouragement. Epstein was educated in the public schools of Prince George&#x27;s County and at Kenyon College where he worked with poet John Crowe Ransom, graduating with Highest Honors in English in 1970. He briefly attended graduate school at the University of Virginia with the support of a Woodrow Wilson and Danforth Foundation grant, but left after a semester to pursue a career as a writer.

==1970s==

Epstein quickly established his reputation as a poet in the early 1970s by publishing poems in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;The Nation&quot;, &quot;The Kenyon Review&quot;, and other prominent journals. These were collected in the volume &quot;No Vacancies in Hell&quot;, published by Liveright in 1973. The success of this first book, a second book of poems titled &quot;The Follies&quot;, and his verse drama &quot;Jenny and the Phoenix&quot;, produced at the Baltimore Theatre Project in 1977, drew the attention of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. They awarded Epstein the Prix de Rome (Rome Prize) that year. 
During his fellowship at the American Academy in Rome he wrote more verse drama as well as many of the poems that would be included in &quot;The Book of Fortune&quot;, published in 1982. While Epstein was still in Italy his third book, &quot;Young Men&#x27;s Gold&quot;, was published to wide acclaim, one critic calling the title poem &quot;quite possibly the best long poem since Ginsberg&#x27;s &#x27;Howl&#x27; &quot; and the reviewer from &quot;The New Republic&quot; comparing the love poems to those of John Donne. He returned to America in 1979 as one of the most widely read poets of his generation. He was soon under contract to the Keedick agency for a speaking tour, with Oxford University Press to translate Euripides, and accepted a position as visiting Assistant Professor at Johns Hopkins University. &quot;Jenny and the Phoenix&quot; was optioned by Joseph Papp for production at The Public Theatre in New York. In Baltimore he became active in a vibrant poetry scene that included such poets as Lucille Clifton, Anselm Hollo, Andrei Codrescu, and David Franks.

==1980s==

Epstein taught poetry and playwriting at the Johns Hopkins Seminars until 1982. While he continued teaching part time, at Randolph Macon, Towson State University, and The Maryland College Institute of Art, his ongoing work in the theatre and a contract to write a textbook for D.C. Heath made an academic career impractical. The failure of Epstein&#x27;s Off-Broadway play &quot;The Midnight Visitor&quot; in 1981 darkened his prospects as a playwright. In the mid-eighties he began publishing prose essays and short stories that were popularly syndicated and anthologized. The first of these, &quot;&quot;Star of Wonder&quot;, about a boy whose parents insist upon celebrating both Hanukah and Christmas inspired hundreds of passionate letters in a dozen city newspapers when it first appeared in syndication. Later broadcast yearly on NPR&#x27;s &quot;All Things Considered&quot;, it became one of the best known holiday stories since &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;&quot;. 
&quot;Star of Wonder&quot; is the title story of a collection of holiday tales published in 1986. On the strength of that book the author secured a two-book contract with &quot;Addison and Wesley: To Write an Autobiography&quot;, &quot;Love&#x27;s Compass&quot;, and a biography of the evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson, &quot;Sister Aimee&quot;. The publication of these books, the first in 1990 and the second in 1993, offered the poet a chance at a second career, as a biographer and historian.

==1990s==

While much of Epstein&#x27;s best poetry was published in the 1980s and 1990s (&quot;Spirits&quot;, &quot;The Boy in the Well&quot;) his poetry has been eclipsed by the success of the biographies of Sister Aimee, Nat King Cole, and Edna St. Vincent Millay. Epstein was welcomed as a sympathetic and fair biographer, with an instinct for the fine detail and historical milieu; his biographies are considered in some cases definitive, but in all cases important contributions to American studies. Critics sometimes challenge the biographer&#x27;s premises. Eric Foner, in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, praised &quot;Lincoln and Whitman&quot; for its &quot;revealing character study of Whitman and a penetrating analysis of his wartime poetry,&quot; but questioned the poet&#x27;s influence on Lincoln&#x27;s prose. All of these books were reviewed in the major media—the Nat King Cole biography on the cover of &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; section—and have remained in print through multiple editions. During this decade, as in the 1980s, Epstein contributed a number of book reviews to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;, and other newspapers. He also published translations of Plautus&#x27;s &quot;Trinummus&quot; from the Latin, and Euripides&#x27; The &quot;Bacchae&quot; from the Greek.

==2000–2010==

Most of this period was devoted to the writing of a trilogy of books about Abraham Lincoln. &quot;Lincoln and Whitman&quot; (2004), a dual biography of the poet and the president was praised by &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; for its &quot;natural sense of detail and period&quot; and its &quot;passionate vividness.&quot; &quot;The Lincolns: Portrait of a Marriage&quot; (2008) was named one of the ten best books of the year by the &quot;Chicago Sun Times&quot; and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, whose reviewer remarked it &quot;may be the best Lincoln book in a generation.&quot; Epstein&#x27;s short book on Lincoln&#x27;s private secretaries, &quot;Lincoln&#x27;s Men&quot;, was published the following year.

==2011–present==

An amateur musician, the writer returned to the subject of music, and his life-long passion for folk music in particular, to write the biography of Bob Dylan on the occasion of the folk rock idol&#x27;s seventieth birthday. Published in 2011 it was the first of Epstein&#x27;s books to reach an extensive international audience, in editions published in English, French, Italian, Portuguese, and other languages. 

For many years Epstein was researching and writing a book about Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s relationship with his son William, the last royal governor of New Jersey. &quot;The Loyal Son: The War in Ben Franklin&#x27;s House&quot; (Ballantine/Random House) was finally published in 2018. The reviewer in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; wrote that “The history of loyalist William Franklin and his famous father has been told before but not as fully or as well as it is by Daniel Mark Epstein in &quot;The Loyal Son&quot;. Mr. Epstein, a biographer and poet, has done a lot of fresh research and invests his narrative with literary grace and judicious sympathy for both father and son. . . . &quot; In a starred review in &quot;Kirkus&quot;, the critic said: “A gripping history of a family torn apart by political upheaval . . . Drawing on much unpublished correspondence as well as published works, the author constructs a fast-paced, vivid narrative with a host of characters whose appearance and personality he etches with deft concision. . . . A perceptive, gritty portrayal of the frenzy of war and a father and son caught at its tumultuous center.”

&quot;Dawn to Twilight: New and Selected Poems 1967-2014&quot; was published by Louisiana State University Press in 2015. The book achieved international acclaim when it was published in Italy as &quot;Dall&#x27;alba al crepuscolo&quot; (Raffaelli Editore, Rimini, 2020) translated by Simone Dubrovic. The critic in Italy&#x27;s most prominent newspaper &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot;, Daniele Piccini wrote: &quot;The art of American poet Daniel Mark Epstein was born mature... The crystalline voice of things that arises out of his verses--always chiselled and metrically refined--becomes one with the poet&#x27;s reflection on the fate of human beings.&quot; The Italian translation of “Water Lillies,” from Epstein&#x27;s sequence “Homage to Mallarme,”  inspired the harp sonata “Le Ninfee,” by Harpist Emanuela Battigelli. The new work was recorded on Battigelli’s CD &quot;Le Ninfee&quot; (Artesuono, 2020).

In April of 2020 Epstein composed a cycle of sonnets &quot;written in ten days from April 5-15, during the first shelter-in-place orders of the coronavirus pandemic...that explore the themes of isolation, danger, and the strangeness of our new reality,&quot; in his own words. The poems became the text for a film titled &quot;Cruel April: Poems from the Pandemic&quot;, directed by Douglas Trapp and starring actors Tyne Daly, Jennifer Van Dyck, Paul Hecht, and Harris Yulin. The actors recite the poems over a montage of art and photography from the Tivoli Gallery, New York. The short film may be viewed online.

In March of 2022 Yale University Press published &quot;Rapture and Melancholy&quot;, Epstein&#x27;s edition of Edna St. Vincent Millay&#x27;s diaries with an introduction and extensive commentary. &quot;Seven decades after Millay&#x27;s death,&quot; said the &quot;New York Times&quot;, &quot;Rapture and Melancholy&quot; paints a picture of artistic triumph, romantic tumult, and a daily life that descended into addiction.&quot;  Abigail Deutch, writing in the Wall Street Journal, wrote: “Rapture and Melancholy... provides an occasion to revisit not just Millay&#x27;s improbable life but also her sometimes revelatory work. . . . While the diary entries vary widely in interest level, Epstein’s biographical summations are reliably fascinating and informative. . . . &quot;

In an interview with Mara Meisel of the &quot;Pittsburgh Press&quot; in 1984 Epstein said: &quot;I always had confidence that poetry was the most important thing in my life…No great poet has not had an extraordinary command of the language, all of history and the manners and morals of his age. How are you going to say something that&#x27;s going to be significant to people if you aren&#x27;t well-grounded in history and in a broad sense of human nature?&quot;
In April of 2022 the poet received an Honorary Doctorate of Letters degree from Kenyon College.

<text>Illinois Route 5 (IL 5) is a four to six lane state highway in Rock Island County, Illinois, United States, that runs from U.S. Route 67 (US 67) in Rock Island to the interchange of Interstate 80 (I-80) and the toll-free portion of I-88, a distance of . IL 92 also continues eastbound on I-88.

==Route description==
IL 5 is the main road on the north bank of the Rock River, serving the cities of Rock Island, Moline, Silvis, and Carbon Cliff.

IL 5 begins from US 67 (11th Street) in Rock Island, traveling eastward towards the Milan Beltway. At this point, it travels along the limited-access road and becomes John Deere Road. Continuing eastward in Moline, it then meets I-74/US 6 at a cloverleaf interchange. After leaving Moline, it serves the Black Hawk College and the John Deere World Headquarters. After this, the route begins to curve northward, and is known as John Deere Expressway for the rest of the route (although most signage along the rest of the route reads Illinois 5). In Carbon Cliff, the route meets IL 84 and IL 92 at a parclo. At this point, IL 92 follows along the rest of IL 5. Also, the road curves northeastward, and then eastward. Continuing east, they then meet I-80/IL 110 at a cloverleaf interchange. At this point, IL 5 transitions into I-88, effectively ending IL 5, while IL 92/IL 110 travels along I-88.

==History==
SBI Route 5 originally ran from East Dubuque to Chicago, mostly along the current US 20. The portion that ran from Belvidere through Rockford is now known as Charles Street in Rockford, and was superseded by what is now the expressway extension of the US 20 Rockford Bypass to Belvidere.

In 1972, IL 5 was applied on former IL 190 (part of US 30 Toll before 1965). By 1975, IL 5 was extended to Rock Falls. By 1977, it extended towards IL 2 in Hillsdale. By 1979, IL 5 was extended all the way to US 67 in Rock Island, replacing part of IL 2 west of Sterling in the process. By 1989, the freeway/tollway portion of IL 5 was changed to I-88, while the rest of IL 5 in the Quad Cities remained.

<text>The Ivorian Popular Front (; abbr. FPI) is a centre-left, democratic socialist and social democratic political party in Ivory Coast.

== History ==
FPI was founded in exile in 1982 by history professor Laurent Gbagbo, Aboudramane Sangaré, and other allies during the one-party rule of President Félix Houphouët-Boigny. Politically inspired by the French Socialist Party, the FPI was until 2011 a full member of the Socialist International (SI). The expulsion of the FPI from the SI occurred as a result of the 2010–2011 Ivorian crisis.

Gbagbo was sworn in as President after the heavily disputed presidential election of October 22, 2000. In the parliamentary election held on 10 December 2000 and 14 January 2001, the party won 96 out of 225 seats.

The party president is Pascal Affi N&#x27;Guessan, a former prime minister. Following Gbagbo&#x27;s election as President, he was required to step down as party leader, and N&#x27;Guessan was elected to head the party at its Third Extraordinary Congress in July 2001.

The Ivorian Popular Front boycotted the 2011 parliamentary election, accusing the electoral commission of bias in favour of Alassane Ouattara and accusing the army of intimidating FPI supporters during the campaign. The party also complained of having been limited in informing the electorate, with the pro-FPI newspaper having been banned by the government and many of its journalists arrested or jailed.

On 8 August 2015, N&#x27;Guessan was designated as the FPI&#x27;s presidential candidate for the October 2015 presidential election. He denounced the incarceration of Gbagbo by the International Criminal Court and political conditions under Ouattara: &quot;Peace isn&#x27;t only the silence of weapons. Can we say that Ivory Coast is in peace when President Gbagbo is in The Hague? With hundreds of political prisoners in jail, Ivory Coast is not in peace.&quot; Some hardliners in the FPI did not want to participate in elections as long as Gbagbo remained imprisoned, but others felt the party needed to remain engaged in the electoral process.

In the December 2016 parliamentary election, only three FPI candidates, including N&#x27;Guessan, were elected to the National Assembly.

On December 23, 2020, the FPI said it would participate in the 2021 Ivorian parliamentary election.

<text>Wendy MacLeod (born August 6, 1959) is an American playwright.

==Life and career==
MacLeod received a BA from Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, where she now teaches and is a playwright-in-residence. She earned a MFA from the Yale School of Drama.

Her works include the plays &quot;Sin&quot; and &quot;Schoolgirl Figure&quot;, both of which premiered at Chicago&#x27;s Goodman Theatre and were directed by David Petrarca. &quot;Schoolgirl Figure&quot; was then optioned for film by HBO and Anvil Entertainment. MacLeod&#x27;s &quot;The House of Yes&quot; premiered in San Francisco at the Magic Theatre and was the theatre&#x27;s second-longest running show. It became an award-winning film by the same name in 1997, starring Parker Posey, which earned a Special Jury Award at the Sundance Film Festival. Other works by MacLeod include &quot;The Water Children&quot;, &quot;Things Being What They Are&quot;, &quot;Juvenilia&quot;, and &quot;Apocalyptic Butterflies&quot;. &quot;Apocalyptic Butterflies&quot; was filmed by the BBC as &quot;Nativity Blues&quot; in 1988, starring Alfred Molina.

Her play &quot;Juvenilia&quot;, a comic drama about college students &quot;attempting to find love&quot;, premiered off-Broadway at Playwrights Horizons, as did her play &quot;The Water Children&quot;, both directed by longtime collaborator Petrarca, which has also been seen at Los Angeles’ Matrix Theater where it was cited as &quot;the most challenging political play of 1998&quot; by the &quot;L.A. Weekly&quot; and earned six L.A. Drama Critics Circle nominations. &quot;Things Being What They Are&quot; premiered at the Seattle Repertory Theatre and was then seen at Steppenwolf in Chicago in 2003 where its sold-out run was extended twice. &quot;The House of Yes&quot; has been performed at Soho Repertory Theatre, at the Maxim Gorki Theater in Berlin and at The Gate Theater in London, where it was published in &quot;Plays International&quot;. MacLeod&#x27;s play, &quot;Find and Sign&quot;, premiered at Pioneer Theatre Company in Salt Lake City, Utah in 2012. Set in the New York City music industry (with a slight nod to &quot;Othello&quot;), &quot;Find and Sign&quot; is about a bumpy romance between an on-the-rise young record executive and an idealistic public school teacher.

Her critically acclaimed comedy &quot;Women in Jeopardy!&quot; premiered at Geva Theater in 2015, directed by Sean Daniels, and her play, &quot;Slow Food&quot;, was invited to the 2015 National Playwrights Conference. The play will be premiering at Merrimack Repertory Theater in January 2019. She has been a guest professor at Northwestern University’s film and theater departments. MacLeod&#x27;s essay &quot;Name Brand Nostalgia&quot; was featured in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and her essay/talk &quot;The Daily Struggle&quot; was given as part of the &quot;Kenyon Review&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Writers-on-Writing&quot; series in October 2016. Her prose and humor pieces have appeared in &quot;Poetry&quot; magazine, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Salon&quot;, &quot;The Rumpus&quot;, &quot;McSweeney&#x27;s Internet Tendency&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and &quot;All Things Considered&quot;.

MacLeod worked as the Executive Story Editor for &quot;Popular&quot; for the WB and wrote the pilot &quot;Ivory Tower&quot;, commissioned by CBS, produced by Brillstein-Grey (&quot;The Sopranos&quot;) and Diane Keaton, with actress Jeanne Tripplehorn. She served as the artistic director of the Kenyon Playwrights Conference which supported new work though its commissioning program and offered an intensive playwriting workshop taught by the artistic staff of partner companies including Playwrights Horizons, Steppenwolf Theater, Roundabout Theatre, The Old Vic, Royal Court Theater, La Jolla Playhouse, and ACT Theatre in Seattle.

==Family==
She is married to Read Baldwin and has two sons: Foss and Avery Baldwin.

<text>The Fighting Seabees is a 1944 American war film directed by Edward Ludwig and starring John Wayne and Susan Hayward. The supporting cast includes Dennis O&#x27;Keefe, William Frawley, Leonid Kinsky, Addison Richards and Grant Withers. &quot;The Fighting Seabees&quot; portrays a heavily fictionalized account of the dilemma that led to the creation of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s &quot;Seabees&quot; in World War II. At the 17th Academy Awards, the film received a nomination for Best Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture for Walter Scharf and Roy Webb but the award went to Max Steiner for &quot;Since You Went Away&quot;.
==Plot==
&quot;Wedge&quot; Donovan is a tough construction boss, building airstrips in the Pacific for the US Navy during World War II. He clashes with his liaison officer, Lieutenant Commander Robert Yarrow, over the fact that his men are not allowed to arm themselves against the Japanese.

When the enemy lands in force on the island, Donovan&#x27;s men want to help fight. Donovan initially tries to dissuade them, but after a Japanese fighter kills or wounds several workers, he changes his mind and leads his men into the fray. This prevents Yarrow from springing a carefully devised trap that would have wiped out the invaders in a murderous machine gun crossfire, with minimal American losses. Instead, many of Donovan&#x27;s men are killed unnecessarily.

As a result of this tragedy, Yarrow finally convinces the Navy to form Construction Battalions (CBs, or the more familiar &quot;Seabees&quot;) with Donovan&#x27;s assistance, despite their mutual romantic interest in war correspondent Constance Chesley. Donovan and many of his men enlist and receive formal military training.

The two men are teamed together on another island. The Japanese launch a major attack, which the Seabees barely manage to hold off, sometimes using heavy construction machinery such as bulldozers and a clamshell bucket.

When word reaches Donovan of another approaching enemy column, there are no sailors left to counter this new threat. In desperation, he rigs a bulldozer with explosives on its blade, intending to ram it into a petroleum storage tank. The plan works, sending a cascade of burning liquid into the path of the Japanese, who retreat in panic, right into the sights of waiting machine guns. However, Donovan is shot in the process and dies in the explosion.

==Cast==

* John Wayne as Lt. Cmdr. &quot;Wedge&quot; Donovan
* Susan Hayward as Constance Chesley
* Dennis O&#x27;Keefe as Lt. Cmdr. Robert Yarrow
* William Frawley as Eddie Powers
* Leonid Kinskey as Johnny Novasky
* J.M. Kerrigan as Sawyer Collins
* Grant Withers as Whanger Spreckles
* Paul Fix as Ding Jacobs
* Ben Welden as Yump Lumkin
* William Forrest as Lt. Tom Kerrick
* Addison Richards as Capt. Joyce

==Production==
&quot;The Fighting Seabees&quot; had the biggest budget in Republic&#x27;s history, $1.5 million. The film was completed in collaboration with the US Navy and the US Marine Corps, and took place on several bases in California (Camp Hueneme and Camp Pendleton), Virginia (Camp Peary) and Rhode Island (Camp Endicott). Principal photography took place from September 20 to early December 1943.

The bulk of the outdoor locations for &quot;The Fighting Seabees&quot; was filmed on the Iverson Movie Ranch in Chatsworth, Calif., widely considered to be the most heavily filmed outdoor filming location in the history of film and television. The production took over virtually the entire 500-acre location ranch for a period of time in 1943, constructing extensive sets on both the Upper Iverson and the Lower Iverson. Palm trees were brought in to transform Iverson&#x27;s rocky Western landscape into a version of the Pacific islands where the film&#x27;s action was set.

A massive landing strip was constructed on the Upper Iverson to simulate the takeoffs and landings of combat aircraft, as well as enemy bombing raids on the U.S.-built installation. On other parts of the ranch, Quonset huts, observation towers, large fuel tanks and other props were built, with the construction process in many cases filmed and featured as part of the film. Graphic scenes depicting tank battles, sniper attacks and hand-to-hand combat were filmed in the Iverson Gorge, Garden of the Gods and other sections of the movie ranch, in one of the largest productions in the ranch&#x27;s history.

The aircraft in &quot;The Fighting Seabees&quot; were:
* Brewster F2A-3 Buffalo
* Douglas TBD Devastator
* Douglas SBD Dauntless
* Mitsubishi Ki-21
* Grumman F4F-3 Wildcat

==Propaganda==
During World War Two, the enemy in Europe was Nazism, while the enemy in the Pacific was the entire race of Japanese people, according to Dower. Japanese atrocities including the Rape of Nanking, the Bataan Death March, and the kamikaze pilots were partly to blame for these attitudes, but other aspects such as the Attack on Pearl Harbor were also at work. As a result of these attitudes, anti-Japanese attitudes were common, including in films of the time. In &#x27;The Fighting Seabees&#x27;, Dennis O&#x27;Keefe informs John Wayne &quot;We&#x27;re not fighting men anymore, we&#x27;re fighting animals.&quot; The films climactic scene shows Wayne as he punctures and ignites a large fuel tank, flooding the advancing enemy with burning oil. &#x27;&quot;That&#x27;ll scorch those Nips back six generations,&quot; he exults.&#x27; 

==Reception==
Film historian Leonard Maltin in &quot;Leonard Maltin&#x27;s 2013 Movie Guide&quot; (2012) considered &quot;The Fighting Seabees&quot;, &quot;action-packed&quot; and &quot;spirited&quot;. Film historian Alun Edwards in &quot;Brassey&#x27;s Guide to War Films&quot; (2000) was more effusive in his evaluation: &quot;With oodles of eulogies and even a Seabees song to sing, you can&#x27;t fail to leave the Roxy dewey-eyed and with Stars and Stripes fluttering.&quot;

A positive review in the &quot;Rushville Republican&quot; included as highlights expertly scened battle sequences, tense dramatic interludes, moments of comedy contrasting with moments of suspense; concluding that this film is &#x27;among the most spectacular ever filmed in Hollywood.&#x27; This review also drew attention to the fact that the &#x27;Seabees&#x27; are less known to the public than most other branches of service, despite providing invaluable service: &#x27;They are, quite literally, the &quot;men in front of the man behind the gun.&quot; They land in combat zones ahead of the troops, and prepare docks, landing fields, barracks, everything that the invading troops require.&#x27;

<doc id="1188724" wikidata="Q2828285" url="?curid=1188724" title="Mer Bleue Bog">
<text>Mer Bleue Bog is a protected area in Gloucester, Ontario, an eastern suburb of Ottawa in Eastern Ontario, Canada. Its main feature is a sphagnum bog that is situated in an ancient channel of the Ottawa River and is a remarkable boreal-like ecosystem normally not found this far south. Stunted black spruce, tamarack, bog rosemary, blueberry, and cottongrass are some of the unusual species that have adapted to the acidic waters of the bog.

The area provides habitat for many species, including beaver, muskrat, waterfowl, and the rare spotted turtle (&quot;Clemmys guttata&quot;). A 1.2 km (¾ mile) boardwalk allows visitors to explore a section of the bog. There are hiking trails that follow raised areas along the edges of the bog and cross-country skiing trails for use in winter. The conservation area is managed by the National Capital Commission.

The value of this unique wetland was not always recognized. During World War II, the Royal Canadian Air Force used this area for bombing practice. Now, this area has been designated as a Ramsar site, a Wetland of International Significance under the Ramsar Convention since October 1995, and an Area of Natural and Scientific Interest since 2011.

The name &quot;Mer Bleue&quot; (French, meaning &quot;blue sea&quot;) is thought to describe the bog&#x27;s appearance when it is covered in morning fog.

==History==
Europeans began farming in the area surrounding the bog in the 1830s. Active exploitation of the bog itself occurred from the 1870 to the early 20th century and included activities such as logging, hunting, blueberry picking, farming, peat extraction, development for transportation/utility corridors, recreation, and scientific investigations.

In the mid-1950s, the federal government of Canada expropriated the farmland, making it part of Ottawa&#x27;s Greenbelt. Today, the bog is reserved mainly for recreational and scientific purposes.

==Physical features==
Mer Bleue is located in the western end of the southern melt water channel of the post-glacial Ottawa River (whereas the Alfred Bog formed at the eastern end of this channel). This channel was eroded into the floor of the Champlain Sea, which invaded the Ottawa Valley some 12 000 years ago. Bedrock topography consists of two north north-east/south south-west trending ridges. Surficial material consists of some glacial till, thick marine clay, and freshwater and deltaic deposits grading from coarse sand to clay. Peat deposits in the bog proper are up to thick.

There are two sand ridges that extend from the west towards the center of the conservation area. These two parallel ridges divide the bog in three sections. The northern ridge (Dolman Ridge) used to have farms, which were expropriated in 1958 and subsequently removed, while the southern ridge (Borthwick Ridge) continues to have a few farms on it and provides access to the visitor boardwalk.

The hydrological features at this site are most unusual. Being a domed bog, water enters the bog mainly from natural precipitation creating oligotrophic conditions. The periphery of the bog is encircled by a mineral-enriched lagg that maintains a base water level for the bog. Drainage is poor due to underlying clay deposits as well as numerous beaver dams. Water eventually drains slowly both westward into Greens Creek and eastward into Bear Brook. However, water levels remain at or near the surface of the bog for most of the year. Saline ground-water sources are found under the organic overburden. A number of artificial ditches were dug in the bog for land reclamation or drainage of adjacent lands, however, most are no longer functioning efficiently due to the many beaver impoundments and gradual sedimentation that has occurred along their lengths.

==Ecological features==

Mer Bleue is a boreal peatland, a type of ecosystem that is usually found in the boreal forest to the north. The sphagnum bog contains two main types of vegetation—the black spruce forest and the open heath vegetation. The black spruce (&quot;Picea mariana&quot;) forest is dominated by black spruce with some growth of larch (&quot;Larix laricina&quot;), trembling white aspen (&quot;Populus tremuloides&quot;) and grey or white birch (&quot;Betula&quot; spp.).

Sphagnum mosses are the dominant low lying form of vegetation in the bog. About 12 species of heaths (members of the family Ericaceae) thrive in the bog. The most common are Labrador tea (&quot;Rhododendron groenlandicum&quot;), leatherleaf (&quot;Chamaedaphne&quot; spp.), small cranberry (&quot;Vaccinium oxycoccos&quot;), bog-laurel (&quot;Kalmia polifolia&quot;), and sheep-laurel (&quot;Kalmia angustifolia&quot;). At least nine species of orchids (family Orchidaceae) are found in Mer Bleue along with a variety of cottongrasses (&quot;Eriophorum&quot; spp.) and sedges (&quot;Carex&quot; spp.) in the family Cyperaceae.

The marsh areas around Mer Bleue are characterized by plants such as cattails (&quot;Typha latifolia&quot;), alders (&quot;Alnus rugosa&quot;), willows (&quot;Salix&quot; spp.), and a variety of sedges (&quot;Carex&quot; spp.). There are several aspen islands in the centre of Mer Bleue consisting of an overstory of aspen and an understory dominated by bracken fern (&quot;Pteridium&quot; spp.). The edges of the islands are surrounded by small bands of cattail and some alder growth.

The ridges of the site extend from the center of the conservation area westwards. There is a wide mixture in the vegetation from early succession poplars and shrubs to some very large mature specimens of white pine, maple, and ash. A section of this area includes a variety of hard and softwood plantations established by the Canadian Forest Service.

==Hydrological values==
Mer Bleue drains both westward into Green&#x27;s Creek and eastward into Bear Brook. Drainage was formerly through small creeks, which now have been modified through a series of ditches dug in the late 19th century. These ditches are no longer functioning efficiently due to the many beaver ponds, which started up in the late 1950s. As in a typical bog, the water level is at or near the surface for most of the year. Much of the bog is surrounded by the &quot;lagg&quot; that is basically a moat of standing or slow flowing water found between the outer perimeter of the bog and the land. Flooding is controlled naturally through beaver dams and the ability of sphagnum to absorb large amounts of water.

The bog receives most of its water in the form of atmospheric precipitation. Flow velocities of ground and surface waters are very low given the impermeability of the underlying clay soils, the absorption qualities of sphagnum and the presence of numerous beaver dams. Shoreline stabilization is not a significant concern as the impact of water on the ridges is minimal and most of the land is relatively flat.

==Fauna==
The bog has a number of significant fauna because of its relatively undisturbed natural habitat and its uniqueness in representing a boreal habitat which is normally found much farther north.

Here is a list of mammal species that are present in or around Mer Bleue. Aquatic furbearers such as beaver (&quot;Castor canadensis&quot;), muskrat (&quot;Ondatra zibethicus&quot;), and mink (&quot;Neogale vison&quot;) live in the surrounding marshes. It is also home to: woodchuck (marmot), raccoon, skunk, porcupine, vole, mole, squirrel (red, grey/black), chipmunk, weasel, cottontail hare, snowshoe hare, moose, white-tailed deer, red fox, coyote, black bear, and possibly Canada lynx and eastern wolf in the remote woodland areas alongside the bog (their presence is yet to be determined). Rare species include the spotfin shiner (&quot;Cyprinella spiloptera&quot;), the beetles &quot;Stenolophus magnacephalus&quot; and &quot;Agonum darlingtoni&quot;, and the spotted turtle (&quot;Clemmys guttata&quot;).

Mer Bleue is the easternmost breeding location of the eastern subspecies of Palm warbler, sometimes called the Yellow Palm Warbler.

<text>&quot;Music Box Dancer&quot; is an instrumental piece by Canadian musician Frank Mills that was an international hit in the late 1970s. It features an arpeggiated piano theme in C-sharp major (enharmonic to D-flat major) designed to resemble a music box, accompanied by other instruments playing a counterpoint melody as well as a wordless chorus. Most modern piano music sheets have the song in the key of C major.

Mills wrote and recorded &quot;Music Box Dancer&quot; in 1974, but it did not become a single until December 1978. By Christmas of that year, it was in the top ten of many European and Asian pop music charts. Released as a single in the United States in January 1979, it reached #3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart on the week ending May 5, and also reached #3 on the Canadian Adult Contemporary chart and #47 on the Canadian pop chart. The single also did well in Australia, reaching #14 on the Australian Singles Chart (Kent Music Report).

A few notes are missing in the third repeated introduction to the main melody, which could not be corrected, as Mills did not have the funds to record another take.

==History ==
In 1974, Mills released an album that featured &quot;Music Box Dancer&quot;, but it was not initially a hit. When he re-signed with Polydor Records Canada in 1978, the label released a new song as a single, with &quot;Music Box Dancer&quot; on the B-side. The single was sent to easy-listening stations in Canada, and one copy was mistakenly sent to CFRA, an Ottawa pop station. The program director played the A-side and could not figure out why it had been sent to his station, so he played the B-side to see if the record label had been mistakenly marked. He liked &quot;Music Box Dancer&quot; and added it to his station&#x27;s playlist.

The song&#x27;s success at CFRA was swift. &quot;Music Box Dancer&quot; premiered on CFRA&#x27;s top 30 chart on May 5, 1978; by June 30, it was the #1 song on the station&#x27;s playlist. &quot;Music Box Dancer&quot; also began picking up play on other Canadian stations around this time, becoming a nationwide hit. Mills&#x27;s album went gold in Canada, which, after several months, prompted Polydor in the US to release the album and single with the B-side &quot;The Poet and I&quot;.

The million-selling Gold-certified single reached #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the spring of 1979 as well as #4 on the Billboard Easy Listening chart, while the album reached #21 on the Billboard Top Album chart and also went gold. Around that time, Nashville, Tennessee television station WNGE used &quot;Music Box Dancer&quot; as its news theme; it became so popular among Middle Tennessee viewers that Polydor awarded a gold record to WNGE for breaking the single in the U.S.

It was Mills&#x27;s only U.S. Top 40 pop hit; the follow-up, another piano instrumental titled &quot;Peter Piper&quot;, peaked at #48 on the Billboard Hot 100, although it was a popular Top 10 hit on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart. Mills managed one final Adult Contemporary chart entry, &quot;Happy Song&quot;, which peaked at #41 at the beginning of 1981.

Mills also released a version of Ricky Nelson&#x27;s &quot;Poor Little Fool&quot; with substantial airplay in Ontario during the 1970s and 1980s.

&quot;Music Box Dancer&quot; has been recorded by such pianists as Floyd Cramer, Richard Clayderman, Roger Williams and Eric Robertson, and by orchestral artists such as James Last and 101 Strings. Bandleader Ray Conniff added lyrics and titled the song on his album &quot;I Will Survive&quot; in 1979. Germany&#x27;s Roberto Delgado recorded a calypso version, and an accordion version was released in Sweden. The band PePe produced a techno version. It was also recorded by Enormous Richard for the Pravda Records compilation &quot;20 More Explosive Fantastic Rockin&#x27; Mega Smash Hit Explosions!&quot;. German singer Marion Maerz made a German vocal version of the song, and The Wiggles covered it on the video/album &quot;Racing to the Rainbow&quot;. In 1980, famous Hong Kong singer Paula Tsui (Tsui Siu Fung) released a version of this song with the same melody and added Cantonese lyrics inspired by Frank Mills&#x27; Official music video, it was arranged by Paulino Chris Babida and with lyrics by Cheng Kwok Kong (Zheng Guojiang).
The Ventures released a guitar-led cover version in their 1981 album &quot;Pops in Japan &#x27;81&quot;.
A cover version by session musicians was also used by the BBC in one of its trade-test transmission tapes in the late 1970s, most often accompanied by Test Card F in vision. The song is also often played by ice cream trucks in the U.S.

<text>The National Association of Colored Women&#x27;s Clubs (NACWC) is an American organization that was formed in July 1896 at the First Annual Convention of the National Federation of Afro-American Women in Washington, D.C., United States, by a merger of the National Federation of Afro-American Women, the Woman&#x27;s Era Club of Boston, and the Colored Women&#x27;s League of Washington, DC, at the call of Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin. From 1896 to 1904 it was known as the National Association of Colored Women (NACW). It adopted the motto &quot;Lifting as we climb&quot;, to demonstrate to &quot;an ignorant and suspicious world that our aims and interests are identical with those of all good aspiring women.&quot; When incorporated in 1904, NACW became known as the National Association of Colored Women&#x27;s Clubs (NACWC).

==History==

The National Association of Colored Women (later National Association of Colored Women&#x27;s Clubs) was established in Washington, D.C., on July 21, 1896. This first of what would later become biennial convention meetings of the association was held at the Nineteenth Street Baptist Church. The organizations attending this convention included the National Federation of Afro-American Women, the Woman&#x27;s Era Club of Boston, and the National League of Colored Women of Washington, DC, the Women&#x27;s Loyal Union as well as smaller organizations that had arisen from the African-American women&#x27;s club movement. These organizations and later others across the country merged to form the National Association of Colored Women. The organization helped all African-Americans through its work on issues of civil rights and injustice, such as women’s suffrage, lynching, and Jim Crow laws.

=== Foundation ===
Two of NACWC&#x27;s leading members were Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin and Mary Church Terrell, who organized their regional women&#x27;s clubs at the July 1896 convention to resist negative representations of Black Women. To defend their respectability, they refuted a letter written by James Jacks, then president of the Missouri Press Association because Jacks&#x27; letter referred to them as thieves and prostitutes. Mrs. Booker T. Washington, Margaret Murray Washington, convened the meeting. 

Founders of the NACWC included Harriet Tubman, Margaret Murray Washington, Frances E. W. Harper, Ida Bell Wells-Barnett, Victoria Earle Matthews, Josephine Silone Yates, and Mary Church Terrell.

=== Mission ===
The organization defined its first year agenda through multiple issues inhibiting the social mobility of black people. These included: &quot;Chain Gang System of the South, the Separate Car Law of the South, the Plantation Mother and Child, Rescue Work in the Alleys and Slums of our Great Cities, the Founding of Homes for our Working Classes, and a Greater Interest in our Fallen and Wayward.&quot;

During the next ten years, the NACWC became involved in campaigns in favor of women&#x27;s suffrage and against lynching and Jim Crow laws. They also led efforts to improve education, and care for both children and the elderly. Membership grew from 5,000 members in 1897 to 100,000 by 1924 before a decline during the Great Depression.

=== Notable leadership ===
Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin and Mary Church Terrell made major contributions to the National Association of Colored Women. Their efforts led the NACWC to become the most prominent organization formed during the African-American Woman Suffrage Movement.

Both women were educated and had economically successful parents. Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin used part of her estate to fund &quot;Woman’s Era&quot;, the first journal published by and for African-American women. This publication established black women as a public audience and a community for both NACWC members and prospective members. Mary Church Terrell was a formidable organizer. She led the struggle in Washington, DC against segregation in restaurants and succeeded in winning a court decision for integration there.

<text>Dr. Laurie Edward Evans (October 14, 1933 – June 19, 2016) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. Between 1988 and 1990, he served as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba, representing the riding of Fort Garry for the Manitoba Liberal Party.

Born in Unity, Saskatchewan, Evans had a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Saskatchewan, and Master of Science and PhD degrees from the University of Manitoba. He worked as an agriculturalist before entering public life, and joined the Academic Staff of the University of Manitoba in 1958. From 1968 to 1969, he was a technical advisor to the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) in Kenya. He was married to Mary Ellen Evans. He had three daughters from a previous marriage, Laura, Norma and Nancy, and two stepsons Joseph and John.

==Political career==
Evans first ran for the provincial legislature in the provincial election of 1986, in the rural riding of Springfield (located just outside Winnipeg). He received 1,376 votes, finishing well behind incumbent New Democrat Andy Anstett and the winner, Progressive Conservative Gilles Roch.

Two years later, he was elected in the south-central Winnipeg riding of Fort Garry (which included the University of Manitoba&#x27;s main campus at the time), defeating incumbent Progressive Conservative Charlie Birt by almost 1,000 votes. The Liberals increased their parliamentary representation from one to twenty in this election, and Evans sat with the official opposition for the next two years. In the provincial election of 1990, he lost to Progressive Conservative Rosemary Vodrey amid a general loss of support for the Liberal Party.

In 2002 Evans was elected Councillor for Ward 6 in the Rural Municipality of Ste. Anne, Manitoba, serving in this position until he resigned in 2015 to move back to Winnipeg.

<text> (&quot;OLt zS&quot; or &quot;OLZS&quot; in the German Navy, &quot;Oblt.z.S.&quot; in the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;) is traditionally the highest rank of Lieutenant in the German Navy. It is grouped as OF-1 in NATO.

The rank was introduced in the Imperial German Navy by renaming the former rank of &quot;Premier Lieutenant&quot; in 1890. Within the navy, officers of this rank were simply addressed as &quot;Herr Oberleutnant&quot;. To distinguish naval officers from those of the army, the suffix &quot;zur See&quot; (at sea) was added in official communications, sometimes shortened to &quot;z.S.&quot; (&quot;Oblt.z.S.&quot;). The rank has since been used by the &quot;Reichsmarine&quot;, &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;, and &quot;Bundesmarine&quot;. In the &quot;Volksmarine&quot;, the rank was originally used in the same way until the suffix &quot;zur See&quot; was dropped. In the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;, engineers (&quot;Ingenieur – Ing.&quot;) of the same rank were distinguished as &quot;Oberleutnant (Ing.)&quot;.

<doc id="1188790" wikidata="Q664588" url="?curid=1188790" title="Uganda Scheme">
<text>The Uganda Scheme was a proposal by British colonial secretary Joseph Chamberlain to create a Jewish homeland in a portion of British East Africa. It was presented at the Sixth World Zionist Congress in Basel in 1903 by Theodor Herzl, the founder of the modern Zionist movement. He presented it as a temporary refuge for Jews to escape rising antisemitism in Europe. The proposal faced opposition from both within the Zionist movement and from the British Colony.

== Background ==

=== East Africa protectorate and the British interests ===
The British were involved in the scramble for (East) Africa to safeguard a range of British interests, such as commercial superiority, the crusade against the East African Slave trade, apprehension over the control of territory that served as a route to India, and rivalry with the German and French governments. They opted to exercise indirect control over East Africa by establishing the Imperial British East Africa Company (IBEA) led by William Mackinnon in 1888.

Despite significant investments, the Imperial British East Africa Company (IBEA) began to fail by mid-1895. Poor infrastructure, financial instability, huge debts, and inadequate management led to this downfall. As a result, the British government proclaimed the protectorate, and its administration was transferred to the Foreign Office. With the aim of exploiting the commercial potential of the interior regions, the British built the Uganda Railway, which ended up costing taxpayers a total of £5,244,000. Unfortunately, the return on investment from the railway was not as substantial as anticipated. This shortfall, combined with the Anglo-Boer War in South Africa, sparked growing unease within the Foreign Office. Immigration to the protectorate was viewed as a potential solution to the mounting debt.

In summary, the British had the following motive in offering the protectorate to the Zionists:

# There was a desire to control the influx of Jewish refugees to the United Kingdom after the pogroms in Eastern Europe to protect British workers.
# The Uganda Railway constructed with British taxpayer money needed to generate a return on investment and reduce the deficit, and the Zionists could bring money and people into the protectorate.
# Gaining Jewish support was considered crucial for post-Boer War policies in South Africa.
# There was genuine concern for the welfare of Jews in Eastern Europe after the Kishinev pogrom.

==History==

=== &quot;Just the country for Dr. Herzl&quot; ===
Joseph Chamberlain and Theodor Herzl were acquainted through the Rothschild brothers. Initially, Herzl proposed a plan to the Colonial Secretary for Jewish settlement in Cyprus, the Sinai peninsula, or El Arish. However, Chamberlain deemed Herzl&#x27;s proposal impractical since these territories were either inhabited or not under British control. Nevertheless, he agreed to discuss the El Arish plan with Lord Lansdowne, the Foreign Secretary, believing it could gain the support of world Jewry for Britain. Chamberlain left London in December 1902 to tour South Africa and stopped in Mombasa before continuing to South Africa.

After a warm welcome, White British settlers in the region presented their grievances to the Colonial Secretary about the Foreign Office&#x27;s failure to attract a significant number of hardworking settlers to the area, hindering the profitability of the railway. Additionally, during a journey on the Uganda Railway through what was described as &quot;the white man country&quot; in East Africa (modern Kenya), Chamberlain&#x27;s opinion on the suitability of the tropical climate for Europeans changed. While on the trip, Chamberlain thought that this &quot;would be just the country for Dr. Herzl&quot; and even proposed the idea of a Jewish homeland in East Africa to Dr. Herzl but did not pursue it further, assuming Herzl&#x27;s interest would lie only in Palestine or nearby.

=== Initial negotiations ===
Initially, Herzl was not interested in the offer of a Jewish homeland in East Africa, as his focus was primarily on Palestine and its surrounding area. However, everything changed after the Kishnev Pogrom after which he redoubled his efforts to secure a Jewish homeland. Leopold Greenberg acted as Herzl&#x27;s main representative in the negotiations, and together they hoped to gain de facto diplomatic recognition from Great Britain, making the proposal&#x27;s political value immense. Despite East Africa&#x27;s lack of moral and historical significance to Jews, the East Africa plan held the most promise compared to the other plans. Greenberg successfully obtained a letter from the Foreign Office expressing the British government&#x27;s willingness to establish a Jewish colony with considerable land, local autonomy, and religious and domestic freedom under its general control. In the Sixth Zionist Congress, which took place in 1903 in Basel, Herzl presented the proposal and the Congress voted in favor of sending a fact-finding group to East Africa with 295 delegates in favor and 178 against.

=== Reaction to the offer ===
Herzl&#x27;s announcement sparked a heated debate that challenged fundamental beliefs and sparked passionate reactions. Some delegates viewed it as a betrayal of the Basel Program and a conflict between Palestine and Uganda. The discord threatened to divide the organization, with some Eastern European delegates dramatically walking out of the meeting and others expressing their loss of trust in Herzl and the steering committee. The emotional tension remained high, with some delegates falling on each other&#x27;s necks, weeping, and a young student fainting. However, Herzl reassured delegates that Palestine would remain Zion and threatened to resign, preventing the organization&#x27;s division. Though he believed the attachment to Palestine was remarkable, he thought the reaction was unreasonable.  &quot;These people have a rope around their necks, but they still refuse,&quot; Herzl commented. Despite concerns about the East Africa scheme, the Jewish World was willing to take the risk, particularly in light of the Kishinev incident. However, some members, such as Reverend Dr. Moses Gaster and Lucien Wolf, strongly opposed the plan, believing it went against the principles of Zionism and was an unwise experiment with Jewish self-government.

The Zionists&#x27; proposal was met with equal controversy in the British colony. The white British settlers were openly hostile toward the offer and formed the &quot;Anti-Zionist Immigration Committee,&quot; which rejected the proposal through the African Standard. They believed that British poor people deserved the land more than the Jews and expressed concerns about how the black natives would react to the Jewish immigrants. Furthermore, there were worries about granting a special territory to an alien community after the troubles in Canada with the Doukhobors, and doubts about Jews&#x27; ability to engage in profitable farming. The British media also joined in the objection, amplifying these concerns. The response of the native population to the offer is unknown, and the Indians who came to build the Uganda Railway did not entirely reject the proposal.

=== The Zionist expedition to East Africa ===
In December 1904, the Zionist Organization dispatched a special commission to Uasin Gishu to assess if the conditions were suitable for Jewish settlement. The commission was composed of Major Alfred St Hill Gibbons, a British veteran of the Boer War and a well-known explorer; Alfred Kaiser, a Swiss orientalist and advisor for the Northwest Cameroon Company; and Nachum Wilbush, a Zionist engineer. Although there were disparities in their final reports, with the climate used to argue for and against the Jewish settlement, the main reason for the rejection of the Plan in 1905 was partly due to the opposition by the former high commissioner of East Africa and the white settlers in the area. This led the British to withdraw the offer.

=== Implications of the offer ===
The East Africa plan was a significant turning point in Zionist history. Despite its rejection in 1905, the plan paved the way for the emergence of the territorialist ideology and the establishment of the Jewish Territorial Organisation (ITO). The ITO emphasized the pressing need to find a solution to the Jewish problem, even if it meant giving up the return to the Land of Israel.

==In fiction==

* In 1890, Theodor Hertzka published &quot;Freeland: A Social Anticipation&quot; - a novel which predated the Uganda Scheme by twelve years but built on many similar themes. In the book, Jewish adventurers work alongside Kenyans to build an egalitarian society in the Kenyan Highlands.
* The story of the 1904 expedition, as well as an imagined vision of a Jewish state in Uasin Gishu, is told in Lavie Tidhar&#x27;s novelette &quot;Uganda&quot;, in his 2007 collection &quot;HebrewPunk&quot;. This is also a theme in Tidhar&#x27;s 2018 novel &quot;Unholy Land&quot;, in which a Jewish state called Palestina is established in Africa after the 1904 expedition returns a positive report. &quot;Unholy Land&quot; was shortlisted for several awards, including the Sidewise Award for Alternate History.
* Adam Rovner&#x27;s &quot;What If the Jewish State Had Been Established in East Africa&quot;, a travel guide for the fictional Jewish homeland of New Judea, located in present-day Uganda, won the 2016 Sidewise Award for Alternate History award for short form alternate history. According to Adam Rovner the plan was appealing to early Zionists as it &quot;twinned the adventures of [Henry Morton] Stanley with the adventurism of the Age of Empire, stagecraft with statecraft.&quot;
* Another alternate history treatment is Yoav Avni&#x27;s novel &quot;Herzl Amar&quot;, הרצל אמר (Herzl Said it) in which the Jewish state in East Africa is called Israel and has many features similar to the actual Israel - it has a big city called Tel Aviv, its army is called the Israeli Defence Forces, its Prime Minister in the 2010s is Ariel Sharon and the opposition leader is Shimon Peres; at its south, near the border with Tanzania, is an impoverished strip similar to the Gaza Strip, dotted with refugee camps of Masai tribesman who were earlier displaced from the more central parts of the country and who like Palestinians are seething with rebellion against Israeli rule. But a highly significant difference from actual history is that, though there had been an antisemitic German leader named Adolf Hitler, WWII ended in an Allied victory much sooner than in actual history and European Jews were spared the Holocaust.

<text>Vichitravirya () is a figure in the Mahabharata, where he is featured as a Kuru king.

According to the Hindu epic, he is the youngest son of Queen Satyavati and King Shantanu, and the de jure grandfather of the Pandavas and the Kauravas. He is also the half-brother of Krishna Dvaipayana Vyasa and Bhishma.

==Literature==

=== Mahabharata ===
Vichitravirya has an elder brother named Chitrāngada, whom his half-brother Bhishma placed on the throne of the kingdom of the Kurus after Shantanu&#x27;s death; he is a mighty warrior, but the king of the Gandharvas defeats and kills him at the end of a long battle. Thereafter, Bhishma consecrates Vichitravirya, who is still a child, as the new king.

When he had reached manhood, Bhishma marries him to Ambika and Ambalika, the beautiful daughters of the king of Kashi. Vichitravirya loves his wives very much, and is adored by them. But after seven years, he falls ill of consumption, and could not be healed despite the efforts of his friends and physicians. Like his brother Chitrangada, he dies childless. Subsequently, through a niyoga relationship with his half-brother sage Vyasa, his wives and a maid give birth to three children, namely Dhritarashtra, Pandu, and Vidura.

Different texts share different stories surrounding the death of Vichitravirya. According to the Bhagavata Purana, he dies of a heart attack because of his attachment to his wives, Ambika and Ambalika. Vichitravirya was succeeded by Pandu and later Dhritrashtra.

== Historicity ==
A historical Kuru King named Dhritarashtra, son of Vichitravirya, is mentioned in the Kathaka Samhita of the Yajurveda ( 1200–900 BCE) as a descendant of the Rigvedic-era King Sudas of the Bharatas.

<text>Black Jack is an aniseed-flavored chewing gum manufactured by the American company, Gerrit J. Verburg Co.

In 1869, exiled former Mexican president and general Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna (famous for losing the Texas War of Independence) was living in New Jersey. He brought Mexican chicle with him in hopes of selling it to raise funds to help him return to power in his home country. He persuaded Thomas Adams of Staten Island, New York, to buy it. Adams, a photographer and inventor, intended to vulcanize the chicle for use as a rubber substitute. Adams&#x27; efforts at vulcanization failed, but he noticed that Santa Anna liked to chew the chicle, which the ancient Mayans had done. Disappointed with the rubber experiments, Adams boiled a small batch of chicle in his kitchen to create a chewing gum. He gave some to a local store to see if people would buy it; they did and he began production.

In 1871, Adams received a patent on a gum-making machine and began mass-producing chicle-based gum. His first product (&quot;Snapping and Stretching&quot;) was pure chicle with no flavoring, but sold well enough to encourage Adams in his plans. He began to experiment with flavorings, beginning with sarsaparilla. In 1884, he began adding licorice flavoring and called his invention Adams&#x27; Black Jack, the first flavored gum in the U.S. It was also the first gum to be offered in sticks.

Black Jack Gum was sold well into the 1970s, when production ceased due to slow sales. It was re-introduced in 1986 and again in 2019.

== Ownership ==
Warner–Lambert acquired the American Chicle Company, including the Adams brand, in 1962. The American Chicle Company was renamed to Adams in 1997. Pfizer, which had bought Warner-Lambert in 2000, sold Adams and all of Pfizer&#x27;s other candy brands to Cadbury in 2003. This unit became Cadbury Adams.

In 2019, Gerrit J. Verburg acquired the Black Jack gum brand among several others from Mondelez International, the parent company of Cadbury.

== In popular culture ==

In the &quot;Seinfeld&quot; episode &quot;The Library&quot;, Jerry remembers his high school girlfriend Sherry Becker as an avid chewer of Black Jack, but upon meeting her again she states her distaste for it and insists that she preferred Dentyne.

In the 1990 movie &quot;Pump Up The Volume&quot;, Christian Slater&#x27;s character chews Black Jack gum.

In the television series &quot;Homeland&quot;, the character of acting CIA director Saul Berenson is revealed as chewing a large amount of Black Jack gum during important operations for good luck.

In Season 3 Episode 15 &quot;Three Amigos&quot; of the television series &quot;Northern Exposure&quot;, Maurice J. Minnifield (Barry Corbin) is given a pack of Black Jack gum by Ruth-Ann (Peg Phillips) the general store owner, to be buried with his newly deceased friend.

<text>Marin Bikes (legally incorporated as Marin Mountain Bikes Inc., stylised as MARIN) is a bicycle manufacturer in Sonoma County, California, established in 1986. It specializes in mountain bikes but also makes other types. Many of its bicycle models are named after locations in and around Marin County, where it was originally headquartered.

==Bicycle range==
Marin offers mountain bikes (full suspension &amp; hardtail), road, street/urban, comfort and specific designs for women &amp; children as well as ebikes. They are generally placed in the mid-high end bracket of each respective market.

Since the late 1990s Marin has manufactured full suspension mountain bikes. Working with Jon Whyte, a British engineer who worked with Benetton Formula One racing cars in gearbox design, Marin developed a single-pivot rear suspension. Subsequent innovations including the TARA (Travel And Ride Adjustable) and quad link suspensions have lost the purity of the original concept but have maintained their popularity.

In February 2012, Marin Bikes agreed to be sold to a European Investment firm.

==Timeline==
* 1986 Marin is founded by Bob Buckley, whose first order of business is to hire Marin County notable (and Mountain Bike hall-of-famer) Joe Murray to help with product design. Marin’s first product is the Madrone Trail, a $199 mountain bike.
* 1996 Marin is the first company to win an XC National Championship aboard a full suspension bike with Paul Lasenby winning the UK national title.
* 2003 Bob steps back in as acting president after a three-year hiatus with the desire to refocus the brand’s product offerings. Marin’s first Quad Link suspension bike is launched.
* 2004 Marin Bikes moves to the old Grateful Dead building in Novato, taking over its 32,000sq ft office and warehouse space. The actual Dead recording studio remains operational until late 2007, with surviving band members and other area musicians rolling though the facilities.
* 2008 construction of a second building is completed with addition of a 1,600sq ft office dedicated to product and design.
* 2012, at age 66 Buckley sells Marin Bikes to a private holding group. The business remains headquartered in Marin County and is operated as an independent group, managed by Tom Herington, Marin’s former CEO/CIO. Herington had worked with Buckley and Marin Bikes for 25 years as a contract consultant before being appointed CEO in 2011.
* July 2012, Matt VanEnkevort joined the company as CEO. Herington moved to the COO role. VanEnkevort had worked at Full Speed Ahead, Inc. in Washington State.

<doc id="1188812" wikidata="Q1620698" url="?curid=1188812" title="Hispano-Suiza HS.404">
<text>The HS.404 is an autocannon originally designed by and produced by the Swiss arm of the Spanish/Swiss company Hispano-Suiza in the mid-1930s. Production was later moved to the French arm of Hispano-Suiza.

It was widely used as an aircraft, naval and land-based weapon by French, British, American and other military services, particularly during World War II. The cannon is also referred to as Birkigt type 404, after its designer Marc Birkigt and later versions based on British development are known as 20 mm Hispano.

Firing a 20 mm calibre projectile, it delivered a significant load of explosive from a relatively light weapon. This made it an ideal anti-aircraft weapon for mounting on light vehicles, as well as a fighter aircraft gun, supplementing or replacing the 7.62 mm (.30 calibre) and .303 inch (7.7 mm) machine guns commonly used in military aircraft of the 1930s. The HS.404 was produced by the French subsidiary of Hispano-Suiza, and under license by a variety of companies in other countries.

==Development==
===From Oerlikon to Hispano===
The first widely used 20 mm aircraft cannon was the Becker model, introduced into German service in World War I. The Becker introduced the advanced primer ignition blowback (API) design for autocannons, a concept that was quickly taken up by other companies. Notable among the resulting designs was the Swiss Oerlikon FF S, which was based on the Becker but introduced a number of improvements. In the 1930s, Hispano-Suiza was asked to develop a 20 mm cannon to fire through the propeller shaft (as a &quot;moteur-canon&quot; SS) of a gear-reduction inline aviation engine like the Hispano-Suiza 8BeC. They took out a license on the Oerlikon FF S and made minor modifications to produce the Hispano-Suiza Automatic Cannon Type HS.7 and HS.9. Shortly after production began, the Hispano-Suiza and Oerlikon companies disagreed over patent rights and their business connection came to an end.

In 1933, the chief engineer of Hispano-Suiza, Marc Birkigt, began work on the design of a new weapon to replace the Oerlikon contract, based on a locking mechanism patented in 1919 by the Swedish-American machine-gun designer . The result was the Type 404 or HS.404. While the HS.404 resembled the parent Oerlikon FF S in many respects, its repeating mechanism was a gas-operated locking bolt.

On firing the 404, when the projectile passes a hole cut in the barrel, about halfway along its length, high-pressure gas behind the projectile is siphoned off and operates a piston that drives a rod, running along the top of the barrel, back against a cam on the bolt, unlocking it and allowing the remaining high pressure gases in the barrel to propel it and the spent cartridge backwards in a delayed sequence that allows the bolt to remain closed until the projectile has exited from the barrel. This maximizes muzzle velocity and since the bolt was locked during firing, it could be lighter than that of the Oerlikon, thus facilitating an increase in rate of fire to 700 rounds per minute (rpm), a gain of about 200 rpm. In 1938, Birkigt patented it and started production in their Geneva factory.

===Anti-aircraft gun===
The HS.404&#x27;s predecessor, the Oerlikon type S auto-cannon, was rather heavy, and the movement of the heavy bolt made it best suited in static and maritime anti-aircraft defence. The lighter bolt of the HS.404 made it well suited to mounting on vehicles. The M16, an anti-aircraft version of the M3 Half-track, could be equipped with single or double American made copies of the Hispano-Suiza auto-cannon. This variant of the M3 Half-track was used by US and Commonwealth forces late in the Second World War, in the Korean War and was further developed by Israel in the post-war era.

===Aircraft gun===
In 1938, an aircraft based version of the HS.404 was produced at the request of the French government. It was installed on a wide range of pre-war French fighter aircraft, notably in installations firing through the propeller shaft of the Hispano-Suiza 12Y engine, a system referred to as a &quot;moteur-canon&quot; (engine cannon). Due to the closed-bolt design the cannon was also suitable for synchronisation gear. The HS.404 was fed by drum magazines that could accommodate 60 (or in a fixed mount 160) rounds. Since in most installations the latter was more popular, the small ammunition capacity was a weakness. In 1940, Hispano-Suiza was developing a belt-feeding system, as well as derivatives of the HS.404 in heavier calibres such as 23 mm but these projects were halted with the German occupation of France.

===British production===
Before the Second World War, the United Kingdom had embarked on a programme to develop cannon-armed fighters. They acquired a licence to build the HS.404, which entered production as the &quot;Hispano Mk.I&quot; intended as aeroplane armament. Its first use was in the Westland Whirlwind of 1940 and later in the more powerful Bristol Beaufighter, providing the Royal Air Force (RAF) with powerful cannon-armed interceptors. The experience of the Battle of Britain had shown the batteries of eight rifle-calibre M1919 Browning machine guns to be inadequate and prompted the adoption of autocannon armament for the primary portion of RAF fighters. The Beaufighter highlighted the need for a belt feed mechanism; as a night fighter the 60-round drums needed to be replaced in the dark by the Radar/Wireless Operator, often while the aircraft was manoeuvring. The early trial installations in the Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire had shown a tendency for the gun to jam during combat manoeuvres, leading to some official doubt as to the suitability of cannon as the sole main armament. This led to the Air Ministry for a brief period specifying 12-machine gun armament for new fighters.

A suitable belt-feeding system was developed by Martin-Baker and the new design was adopted by the RAF and Fleet Air Arm in 1941 in a slightly modified form as the &quot;Hispano Mk.II&quot;. Four cannons replaced the eight Browning machine guns in the Hurricane and in some tropical versions of the Spitfire, becoming standard armament in later fighters. Most other Spitfires had only two cannons because the outboard cannon tended to freeze at high altitudes. These were complemented with four 0.303 calibre (7.7 mm) or two 0.50 calibre (12.7 mm) machine guns.

The British were concerned their production would be inadequate and licensed production of the Hispano to the US but this production never became satisfactory and the British eventually gave up on the US versions. British production was eventually increased to the point where this was no longer necessary. The ultimate version of the British wartime Hispanos was the &quot;Hispano Mk. V&quot;, which had a shorter barrel, and lacked the cocking cylinder thus requiring manual cocking before flight. It was lighter and had a higher rate of fire (desirable in aircraft armament), although at the expense of some muzzle velocity. The shorter barrel meant that the weapon could be housed within the wing of a fighter plane, reducing drag and making the gun less vulnerable to freezing and mechanical stress. One of the main British fighters to use the &quot;Mk. V&quot; was the Hawker Tempest Mk. V Series II, which mounted two cannons in each wing. Ammunition types available included semi-armour piercing, incendiary (SAPI) and high explosive, incendiary (HEI). Around 42,500 Hispano cannons of various marks were manufactured by Birmingham Small Arms (BSA).

===U.S. production===

The British version was also licensed for use in the United States as the &quot;M1&quot;, with the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) and U.S. Navy, which concluded that a single HS404 is analogous to three .50 machine guns in firepower while weighing less than twice as much, planning to switch to the 20 mm calibre as soon as the gun could be produced in sufficient numbers. In 1941 a very large building program was established, along with the production of ammunition. When delivered, the guns proved to be extremely unreliable and suffered a considerable number of misfires due to the round being lightly struck by the firing pin. The British were interested in using this weapon to ease the demand on production in England but after receiving the M1 they were disappointed. British wing-mounted fighter weapons by this period were cocked on the ground by the aircraft armourers before flight, the pneumatic cocking mechanism used previously being regarded as unnecessary weight and detrimental to aircraft performance; any stoppage in flight made the gun unusable until it could be cleared on the ground. The misfires also had the tendency to cause aircraft with wing-mounted guns to yaw away from the wing with the failed gun when the guns were fired, due to the unequal recoil, throwing off the pilot&#x27;s aim.
In April 1942 a copy of the British Mk.II was sent to the U.S. for comparison. The British version used a slightly shorter chamber and did not have the same problems as the U.S. version of the cannon. The U.S. declined to modify the chamber of their version but nonetheless made other modifications to create the unreliable M2. By late 1942 the USAAF had 40 million rounds of ammunition stored but the guns remained unsuitable. The U.S. Navy had been trying to switch to using cannon on all its combat aircraft throughout the war but the conversion never occurred. As late as December 1945 the U. S. Army Chief of Ordnance was still attempting to complete additional changes to the design to allow it to enter service. Some variations of the 20 mm guns used on the Lockheed P-38 Lightning aircraft were produced by International Harvester. The P-38&#x27;s nose-mounted M2 featured a built-in cocking system and could simply be re-cocked in flight after a misfire, which made the misfires less of a problem than with other aircraft.

The U.S. followed the British development closely and when the Mk.V was designed, the Americans followed suit with the &quot;A/N M3&quot; but unreliability continued. After the war the United States Air Force (USAF) adopted a version of the M3 cannon as the &quot;M24&quot;, similar in most respects except for the use of the addition of electrical cocking, allowing the gun to re-cock over a lightly struck round. The problems of the American weapons led to most U.S. fighters being equipped with the AN/M2 .50 cal Browning light-barrel machine gun throughout the war.

===Post-war development===
After the war, the Hispano variants disappeared fairly quickly as fighter armament due to the introduction of revolver cannon, based on the prototype versions of the un-built German wartime Mauser MG 213 design. The British introduced the powerful revolving 30 mm ADEN cannon in most of their post-war aircraft, while the French used the similar DEFA cannon, firing similar ammunition. The USAF introduced the 20 mm M39 cannon to replace the M24, while the Navy combined the original Hispano design with a lighter round for better muzzle velocity in the Colt Mk 12 cannon. As a ground vehicle-mounted gun, either anti-aircraft or as a general-purpose autocannon, the HS.404 lasted into the 1960s. A powered turret variant is still in production in Honduras and is used as a light anti-aircraft gun by the army and navy in several nations. The AN/M3 was developed into the Mk12 Colt 20 mm automatic cannon, one of the main weapons on boats of the Mobile Riverine Force in the Vietnam War and also used on some larger amphibious ships.

===Properties===
The Hispano fired a 20 mm diameter projectile from a long casing, the whole round weighing . Lengths of the projectiles varied with type but were set to variable depth in the casing to produce a total full round length of regardless of projectile type. The gun had a muzzle velocity between , depending on barrel length. Rate of fire was between 600 and 850 rounds per minute. The gun was long, weighing between . The British Mk V and American M3/M24 weapons were lighter and had higher rates of fire than the early HS.404 guns.

<text>Illinois Route 83 (IL 83) is a major north–south state highway in northeast Illinois. It stretches from U.S. Route 30 (US 30, Lincoln Highway) by Lynwood and Dyer, Indiana, north to the Wisconsin border by Antioch at Wisconsin Highway 83 (WIS 83).

== Route description ==
IL 83 passes through Cook County, DuPage County, and Lake County. It begins as part of Glenwood–Dyer Road in Lynwood, and then follows Torrence Avenue though Lansing, 147th Street/Sibley Boulevard though Calumet City, Dolton, Harvey, Dixmoor, then north on Cicero, and then northwest on Cal Sag Road through Cook County. It then becomes known as the Kingery Highway through DuPage County, and then follows Busse Road, Oakton Street and Elmhurst Road in northern Cook County. In Lake County it is named McHenry Road in Buffalo Grove, Ivanhoe Road north of Mundelein, Barron Boulevard in Grayslake and Milwaukee Avenue in Lake Villa.
IL 83 ranges from a width of two thru lanes at either terminus to six lanes through DuPage County. It is the main north–south arterial route falling between Interstate 355 (I-355) and I-294 for the central portion of its routing.

== History ==

SBI Route 83 was modern Illinois Route 17 from New Boston to Galva. In 1941 it was changed to the Lynwood-to-Antioch routing, replacing Illinois Route 52 and IL 54. In 1998, IL 83 was routed slightly north onto 127th Street, from Cal Sag Road. The renumbering was part of a major reconstruction project of the IL 50 intersection with I-294 (Tri-State Tollway). 

As part of sign replacement accompanying the renumbering, IL 83 was added to the northbound IL 50 exit from southbound I-294, as the new northbound IL 50 ramp leads directly to IL 83 first. However, IL 83 overlaps IL 50 southbound at the center of the interchange, so southbound IL 50 traffic also joins IL 83 at the end of the ramp. This is not reflected in the current signage on the tollway.

A $13.4 million construction project was completed in northern Lake County on a section of IL 83 from Petite Lake Road to the Wisconsin state line. Changes included adding a center turn lane and intersection reconfigurations at Grass Lake Road, IL 173, and North Avenue. The project was completed in fall 2010.

<text>Allerton is a working-class neighborhood geographically located in the East Bronx section of the Bronx, New York City. It is named in honor of Daniel Allerton, an early Bronx settler who purchased and farmed this area with his wife Hustace. It consists of two subsections called Bronxwood and Laconia. Its boundaries, starting from the north and moving clockwise, are Adee Avenue, Boston Road, and Gun Hill Road to the northeast; the IRT Dyre Avenue Line () to the east; Waring Avenue to the south; and Bronx River Parkway to the west. White Plains Road and Boston Road are the primary thoroughfares through Allerton.

==History==
Allerton Avenue was ethnically divided in the 1950s through the 1980s by a distinct separation of Jewish and Italian residents. Primarily a commercial avenue west of Laconia Avenue, the geographic boundary between the Jewish and Italians was Bronxwood Avenue and Boston Post Road. Bordering the largely Jewish Pelham Parkway to the southern extreme of Williamsbridge, the area east of Boston Post Road was predominantly post-war immigrant Italian and to the west an older Jewish community. Mixed in were residents representing earlier 19th and 20th century migrations from Manhattan, largely of Irish and English-Irish extraction. The arrival of West Indians in the 1980s marked the transition, north of Allerton Avenue, from a distinctly Italian area to a West Indian one. West of Bronxwood Avenue, the arrival of Dominicans concurrently marked the end of the Jewish community north of Allerton Avenue (Laconia). Today, the area south of Allerton Avenue and east of Bronxwood Avenue has a large population of Italian-Americans and Albanian-Americans, as well as Asians, Hispanics, West-Indians, and other groups.

Throughout its history, the area called Allerton has also been known by various names. The New York City Department of City Planning had classified the southern part of the neighborhood as &quot;Laconia&quot; and the northern part as &quot;Bronxdale&quot;, while Google Maps called the area &quot;Bronxwood&quot; (a historical name also used for a nearby street) and Hagstrom Map called the area &quot;Allerton&quot;. However, neighborhood names and boundaries in New York City are not official, and the names of the Allerton area are highly disputed.

<text>Fred Waitzkin (born 1943 in Massachusetts) is an American novelist and writer for &quot;The New York Times&quot; &quot;Sunday Magazine&quot;, &quot;New York&quot;, and &quot;Esquire&quot;. He graduated from Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio in 1965, and lives in New York City and Martha&#x27;s Vineyard.

Waitzkin is the father of chess prodigy Joshua Waitzkin and wrote a book about his son called &quot;Searching for Bobby Fischer&quot;; he felt that Joshua could be a successor to Bobby Fischer. The book was praised by Grandmaster Nigel Short, as well as chess journalist Edward Winter, who called it &quot;a delightful book&quot; in which &quot;the topics [are] treated with an acuity and grace that offer the reviewer something quotable on almost every page.&quot; Screenwriter and playwright Tom Stoppard called the book &quot;well written&quot; and &quot;captivating&quot;. The book was made into the Academy Award-nominated namesake film (but released in the U.K. as &quot;Innocent Moves&quot;), with Joe Mantegna playing Joshua Waitzkin&#x27;s father.

<text>Baron Povel Karl Henric Ramel (; 1 June 1922 – 5 June 2007) was a Swedish entertainer. Ramel was a singer, pianist, vaudeville artist, author and a novelty song composer. His style was characterized by imaginative wit, both verbal and musical. He took inspiration from US and UK &#x27;crazy&#x27; style humor and created his own personal Swedish version, unusual combinations of lyrics and music, word play, pastiche and general unexpectedness. He wrote approximately 1700 songs, skits and monologues, and he is regarded as a legend and an institution in Swedish entertainment.

==Early life==

Povel Ramel was born in Östermalm, Stockholm into an affluent noble family. His father, Karl Ramel, was a lawyer. At a young age, Ramel found a loving audience for his talents in the family nurses, maids and cooks, and also his parents. His family often went on extensive holidays, and on such an occasion, on a beach in Belgium, when Povel was two years old he stepped on a nail. With the wound infected Povel was not expected to survive, although he recovered, with a slight permanent injury.

Ramel&#x27;s school-life was troubled. He cut classes, often going to Skansen, an open-air museum and zoo, favouring their monkey house. To avoid getting into trouble, Ramel told his teachers that he had lost his attendance book, thereby getting a new one, while showing his parents the old one, free from absence remarks. However, one day his father spotted Ramel visiting the monkey house. Subsequently, his father tried sending Ramel to various schools, but with little success.

At the age of 15, Ramel accompanied his parents on a car trip. There was a collision and Ramel&#x27;s mother, Märta Tesch, died the following day in hospital. His father died a few months later.

==Career==

After his parents&#x27; death, Ramel was raised by his paternal aunt, who recognised his artistic potential. He went to art school, but his infatuation with painting did not last. However, he developed a love for playing the piano and for words, as he became inspired by musicians such as Bing Crosby, Fats Waller, British trumpeter Nat Gonella, Spike Jones and British dance band leader Harry Roy. Entering &quot;Aftonbladet&quot;&#x27;s talent hunt, Vi som vill opp in 1939, Ramel sang and &quot;yawned&quot; his own composition, &quot;En sömnig serenad&quot; (&quot;A Sleepy Serenade&quot;). By this time Ramel was already a prolific songwriter. His aunt wrote the lyrics to one of his songs, &quot;En vår utan dig&quot; (&quot;A Spring Without You&quot;), which he recorded. Ramel&#x27;s lyrics are noted for their humor and dramatic wordplay. Musically he was able to adopt styles from most types of music for his own purposes.

Later, when called to do his military service, his foot condition kept him out of active duty, and he was given an administrative role. When studying the military code, he learned that most everything was forbidden. But, with no rules to be found against Boogie Woogie Waltzes, he dutifully wrote &quot;Johanssons boogie-woogie-vals&quot;, the song that was later to become his first hit.

STIM (a musical copyright agency) required the record have a label banning its airplay. As a result, the sales were minimal. Then a friend at the record company sent a copy with the label pulled off to Radiotjänst (The Swedish Broadcasting Corporation), and the sales jumped. Ramel was hired by Radiotjänst in 1945, which ushered in a new era of radio entertainment. With several series of innovative radio shows featuring the crazy style of humor, he became a household name in Sweden.

===Knäppupp===

In 1952, Ramel and Felix Alvo started the Knäppupp AB (Unbutton Inc.) company. The Knäppupp vaudeville shows were popular with Swedish audiences. His first vaudeville show was &quot;Akta Huvet&quot; (&quot;Mind Your Head&quot;) and Ramel made his entrance hanging from a cable over the auditorium. The show opened at the &quot;Cirkus&quot; theatre in Gothenburg in 1952. Knäppupp AB also produced a number of movies, such as &quot;Ratataa&quot; in 1956. Ramel had several pub shows such as, &quot;Karamelodier&quot;. &quot;Karamelodier&quot; is one of Ramel&#x27;s typical puns, as the word &quot;karamelodier&quot; is a combination of the words &quot;karamell&quot; (bon-bon), &quot;Ramel&quot; and &quot;melodier&quot; (melodies).

===Some of his most famous songs===

* Johanssons boogie woogie vals (Johansson&#x27;s Boogie Woogie Waltz)
* Måste vägen till Curaçao gynga så (Why must the Boat to Curaçao sway like this)

* Jag diggar dig (I dig you)
:Anticipating rap music.
* Köp inte en zebra! (Don&#x27;t buy a zebra!)
* While he almost exclusively worked in Swedish, he has written at least one song in English, &quot;The Sukiyaki Syndrome&quot;, about a visit to a Japanese restaurant, and others with a brief English introduction such as &quot;Birth of the Gammeldans&quot;.

==Karamelodiktstipendiet==

In 1982, in connection with his 60th birthday, Ramel founded &quot;Karamelodiktstipendiet&quot;, an award given annually to a Swedish entertainer or group of entertainers, known for inventiveness and renewal in their use of Swedish, or for important musical contributions. Ramel personally selected the recipient each year; after his death, a jury led by his daughter Lotta makes the selection. The name of the prize is a pun on &quot;karamell&quot; (piece of candy) and &quot;Ramel&quot;, &quot;melodi&quot; (melody), and &quot;dikt&quot; (poem or inventive story). The award itself consists of a paper cone filled with sweets, which alludes to one of Ramel&#x27;s songs, a diploma, and a sum of money which is &quot;sufficient to make the recipient financially independent, at least for the rest of the day&quot;. As of 2014, the prize sum was 20,000 SEK.

The prize ceremony is held at the beginning of June each year, and it was led by Povel Ramel until 2007, when he was unable to attend due to his failing health; he died on the following day from a heart disease. From 2007 onwards, it has been hosted by Ramel&#x27;s children Mikael and Lotta. The awardee is led onto the scene of the venue covered by a sheet striped in red and white (an allusion to a &quot;polkagris&quot;, a form of peppermint rock), which is removed as the identity of the recipient is revealed through a poem written for the occasion.

==Bibliography==

Povel Ramel wrote a number of books, his first in 1945, though his main focus was always on his music.
Here is a list of his books (not including the many book of lyrics that he published):

===&quot;Från Asar till Wasar&quot;===

* (From Asar to the House of Vasa), 1945.
In this book, Ramel presents himself as an &#x27;eternity-human&#x27;, born in the ice age.
He describes the history of Sweden &quot;as it was&quot; from the old Norse &quot;Asar&quot;-gods to Gustav Vasa.
He also has some &#x27;eternity-friends&#x27; and an &#x27;eternity-dog&#x27; called Missräkningen (The miscalculation).

===Min galna hage===

* (My Looney Pasture), 1957.
Ramel&#x27;s pasture is said to have corners. 5 of them. It is a crazy pasture.

This book has sections, called corners. These are:
* Poetiska hörnet (The poetry corner)
* * Poems written by a fictional lady called Ewa Sophi Drömmington
* De smås hörn (The tiny ones&#x27; corner)
* * Some stories about Little Huno and his 36 siblings, for example Lille Päron (Little Pear) whom all the siblings used to hit &quot;because he liked it&quot;
* Blandade Hörnet (The mixed corner)
* * Includes a part from Från Asar till Wasar and some other mixed writings.
* Makabra Hörnet (The macabre corner)
* * Among others, a story about a girl who loved the colours black and red, and therefore bit her own family to see red blood.
* * * Povel wrote here: &#x27;Don&#x27;t read this if you already doubt my mental sanity!&#x27;
* Helraspiga hörnet (Completely crazy corner)
* * Stories &quot;Den trasiga middagen&quot; (The broken dinner), about Det Lilla Polki (The Little Polki) Far och Pappa (Father and Dad) and some other strange characters such as Onkel Zebraton från Afrika (Uncle Zebraton from Africa), Farbror Flicka (Uncle Girl) and Bästekock Lortig (Best-cook Dirty), whom after the third time slipped on a ratshell and became lying and stopping potatoes.
* * * This corner also includes a dictionary with strange definitions of words

===Knäppupplevelser===

* (Knäppupp experiences, the upp is used both for Knäppupp and Upplevelser), 1976

This book is about the time of Knäppupp. It came with a vinyl album with the same name, and is really hard to find today.

===Lingonben===

* (Lingonberry legs), 1978.
This is a lyric book with some famous songs (like Naturnbarn, and Johansson&#x27;s boogie woogie vals) and some less well known songs by Ramel (As Balladen Om Kung Styggfrid {The Ballad about King Wickedfrid})

===Tänk dej en strut karameller===

* (Imagine a cone of bon-bons), 1981
With sheet music to many of Ramel&#x27;s most popular songs.
The title is also the title of one of Ramel&#x27;s songs.

This includes some random poems and writings of Ramel, as &quot;How to Convince an American Businessman&quot;

===Vanliga palsternackan för gottegrisar===

* (The ordinary parsnip for sweet teeth)

&quot;Vanliga palsternackan&quot; is a play on the famous Swedish almanac, Vanliga Almanackan (The ordinary almanac)

This book was co-written with Hans Alfredson

===Följ mej bakåt vägen, Povels Livs-stycken del 1===

* (Walk with me back along the road, Ramel&#x27;s &quot;life-parts&quot; part 1), 1992.
This begins with Ramel&#x27;s youth and ends when he married his wife in 1949.
He describes many things of his life, such as when he, as a child, cut big holes in his clothes, to find out what it was like to be poor!
Ramel choose to not call the book his &#x27;memoarer&#x27; (memoirs), as that would sound too boring!
&quot;Följ mej bakåt vägen&quot; is also a title of one of Ramel&#x27;s songs.

===Förflerade Lingonben===

* Increased Lingonberry legs), 1992
This is a longer edition of Lingonben with some well-known and less well known unknown songs.

It has been reprinted many times, most recently in 1997.

<doc id="1188824" wikidata="Q1591605" url="?curid=1188824" title="The Big Bounce (2004 film)">
<text>The Big Bounce is a 2004 American comedy heist film starring Owen Wilson, Charlie Sheen, Sara Foster and Morgan Freeman. It was directed by George Armitage in his final directing role. It is based on the 1969 novel of the same name by Elmore Leonard. Leonard&#x27;s novel had previously been adapted for the big screen in a 1969 film of the same name directed by Alex March and starring Ryan O&#x27;Neal.

==Plot==
Jack Ryan, a surfer and small-time thief, has a fight with the intimidating Lou Harris, involving a baseball bat. Harris is a foreman on a Hawaii construction site run by duplicitous millionaire Ray Ritchie. When Jack is released from jail, both the police and Ritchie&#x27;s business partner, Bob Rogers Jr., tell Jack to leave the island.

However, Judge Walter Crewes takes a liking to Jack and offers him a place to stay and a job as a handyman at a small resort of beach-front bungalows that he owns. Jack has treacherous encounters with Harris and Rogers Jr., on numerous occasions.

Ritchie has all his (substantial) property registered in the name of his wife, Alison. He is also cheating on her with a much younger woman, Nancy Hayes. When Nancy takes an interest in Jack, the Judge warns him that she likes &quot;the criminal type&quot; and cannot be trusted. Jack is falling for Nancy, and they break into houses for fun and profit.

Nancy suggests to Jack a scheme to steal $200,000 that Ritchie is keeping for bribes and mob business. She arranges for him to sneak into Ritchie&#x27;s house to steal the money from his safe. Jack arrives to find Ritchie face down motionless and his friend Frank shot and lifeless (although he does jump up and run off moments after he&#x27;s hit the ground, only wounded superficially).

In a conspiracy with Alison, Nancy has set up Jack to be Ritchie&#x27;s &quot;killer&quot;, with Alison to shoot him dead as an intruder. Alison blundered by overdosing Ritchie with poison, and shot the wrong man, Frank.

It is revealed that Judge Crewes tried to make Jack the patsy as he is Alison&#x27;s lover and has been part of the conspiracy, with the two promising to give Nancy the $200,000 for her part. Jack manages to steal the money from the safe before Nancy can, narrowly escaping and leaving Alison and Crewes to frame Nancy as Ritchie&#x27;s killer.

Alison and Crewes are seen sailing Ritchie&#x27;s yacht, disposing of his body in the ocean. Nancy is in disguise, trying to escape the island before she is arrested for Ritchie&#x27;s disappearance and murder. Jack spots Nancy as he&#x27;s driving past her in a limousine, stopping to wish her well but refusing to help her after her attempt to frame him. He departs with the money and the beautiful vacationer from bungalow number 9 that he met while working at Judge Crewe&#x27;s resort.

==Cast==
==Production==
George Armitage was given a copy of Sebastian Gutirrez&#x27;s script by Steve Bing, who became a producer on the film.
&quot;The Big Bounce&quot;, the book, when you break it down, is basically an act and a half. It&#x27;s not a real three acts. So you&#x27;re going to have to add half of the picture. So right away you&#x27;re in trouble with somebody like Elmore, who I considered to be an absolutely brilliant writer. So he worked on the script with me, he gave me notes, and the notes are classic, they&#x27;re great. —George Armitage

The setting for the film was moved from the Thumb area of Michigan, where the novel was set, to the North Shore of Oahu. The film was shot on location in Hawaii.

On the first day of pre-production, Armitage was hit in the eye with a piece of lava rock and contracted a virus. The director came down with an infection with two weeks left to shoot and had to go to the hospital, shutting down production, with Armitage commenting that, &quot;Fortunately it was right at Christmas, so it turned into a Christmas break that we hadn&#x27;t planned on, and I completed the picture afterwards.&quot;

Armitage says that despite this the film was very pleasant. &quot;Now, being in Hawaii was probably a great deal of that. But it was just an extraordinary experience, and I credit the producer, Steve Bing, with that. He put up his own money, and I think he had $250,000 in bar bills, just picking up drinks for the crew and cast for all that time. So he couldn&#x27;t have been more wonderful.&quot;

===Post-production===
According to Armitage, the film encountered troubles in post-production when Steve Bing suffered a crisis of conscience:
He was getting advice from people who&#x27;re in the money business, and he felt that to have a chance to get his money back, he should go PG-13. The first time we showed the film, it came in at an NC-17 instead of an R. And it was unreleasable in that form. So I said: &quot;We&#x27;ll make it an R&quot;. But they said: &quot;You can&#x27;t make an R-rated comedy, they don&#x27;t make money&quot;. That&#x27;s what they were saying in 2004. Since then, of course, a lot of R-rated comedies have done beautifully. So I said: “Look, I&#x27;m not going to oversee the destruction of my own movie, there&#x27;s no way. If you go to a PG-13, you&#x27;re going to eliminate Elmore Leonard from this movie&quot;. But the decision was made—they felt that they had to do that, so I said: &quot;Goodbye&quot;. I left the picture after my second cut... when people ask to see my last movie, I show them my cut of The Big Bounce, I don&#x27;t show them what&#x27;s out there. It isn&#x27;t absolutely complete, but I think it could have been a far, far better film.

=== Reception ===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;The Big Bounce&quot; has an approval rating of 16% based on 135 reviews, with an average score of 4.20/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Lazily crafted and light on substance, &quot;The Big Bounce&quot; takes few chances and strands its promising cast in a subpar adaptation that fails to do its source material justice.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 42 out of a 100 based on 36 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;D&quot; on scale of A to F.

Joe Leydon of &quot;Variety&quot; called it a &quot;Modestly engaging, albeit instantly forgettable shaggy-dog story only gradually reveals itself as a seriocomic take on standard-issue noir.&quot;
Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave it 2 out of 4 stars. Although he enjoyed the characters, he was critical of the lack of focus and wrote, &quot;The movie doesn&#x27;t work. It meanders and drifts and riffs.&quot;
Author Elmore Leonard called the 1969 film version of his story, &quot;The Big Bounce&quot;, filmed in California with Ryan O&#x27;Neal and Leigh Taylor-Young, &quot;the second-worst movie ever made&quot; and reserved first place for the 2004 remake.

===Box office===
This film flopped at the American box office, grossing $6,808,550 against its $50 million budget.

<text>Cape May Point State Park is a state park located in Lower Township, New Jersey, with a Cape May Point postal address. The park offers walking, hiking and nature trails as well as beaches, an exhibit gallery, a ranger office and is the site of the Cape May Light. The park is operated and maintained by the New Jersey Division of Parks and Forestry.

==Birding==
Cape May Point State Park is considered to be one of the best places in North America to view the Fall bird migration to the south. The location attracts migratory birds of the eastern seaboard looking for cover and food as they await favorable winds to cross the Delaware Bay. Because of this, birding is one of the most prominent activities conducted at the park.

In 1935, the National Audubon Society leased 25 acres of land in what is now the state park, for the creation of a wild life sanctuary named the Witmer Stone Wild Life Sanctuary after the noted ornithologist. The sanctuary expanded to 1,000 acres, however in 1941, a magnesite factory for the production of fire brick needed to produce steel for the war effort was located in the middle of the sanctuary. The emissions from the factory damaged the flora and fauna of the sanctuary and the lease and sanctuary were abandoned in 1959.

Every fall, visitors converge from across the country to witness the migration of most types of North American migratory birds in great numbers. Every year the a hawk watch is also held, in which the numbers of various types of migratory birds of prey are counted during a several month period.

Birds can be seen in the Park at three areas. These are the hawk watching platform (for hawks), the nature and hiking trails (for songbirds) and the beach (shorebirds). For the most part, birds of many varieties can be seen at all of these areas year round.

==Trails==

The park has three hiking trails, each designated by a color. All three start and end at the parking lot. The Red trail, a boardwalk trail which is wheelchair accessible, is long. It has several observation platforms. The Yellow trail is long and is part boardwalk and part dirt. It begins from the red trail and has one additional birding platform. The Blue trail, closed for a long time due to hurricane damage in the 1960s, reopened again in the 1990s. It is long, part of which is on the beach.

The park&#x27;s trails and beach connect to the adjacent 200-acre South Cape May Meadows owned by The Nature Conservancy.

==Gun emplacements==
During World War I and World War II the park was the Cape May Military Reservation. Remnants of a gun battery, part of the Harbor Defenses of the Delaware, can be seen today. 

A 6-inch gun was mounted near the former Coast Guard station in World War I, but the emplacement has been demolished. Three batteries were in the park area in World War II. These were Battery 223 with two 6-inch guns on shielded mounts, with an ammunition and fire control bunker between them, Battery 25 with four towed 155 mm guns on concrete Panama mounts, and Anti-Motor Torpedo Boat battery (AMTB) 7, with four 90 mm guns, two on fixed mounts and two on towed mounts. Only the bunker for Battery 223 remains visible, stripped of its original earth cover. A beach restoration project in 2005 covered the remains of the other emplacements.

===Meanings===

Have you (O Muhammad (Peace be upon him)) not seen how your Lord dealt with the Owners of the Elephant? [The elephant army which came from Yemen under the command of Abrahah Al-Ashram intending to destroy the Kaaba at Mecca].
Did He not make their plot go astray?
And sent against them birds, in flocks,
Striking them with stones of Sijjil.
And made them like an empty field of stalks (of which the corn has been eaten up by cattle).

Have you not considered, [O Muhammad], how your Lord dealt with the companions of the elephant?
Did He not make their plan into misguidance?
And He sent against them birds in flocks,
Striking them with stones of hard clay,
And He made them like eaten straw.

Seest thou not how thy Lord dealt with the Companions of the Elephant?
Did He not make their treacherous plan go astray?
And He sent against them Flights of Birds,
Striking them with stones of baked clay.
Then did He make them like an empty field of stalks and straw, (of which the corn) has been eaten up.

Hast thou not seen how thy Lord dealt with the owners of the Elephant?
Did He not bring their stratagem to naught,
And send against them swarms of flying creatures,
Which pelted them with stones of baked clay,
And made them like green crops devoured (by cattle)?

==Asbab al-nuzul==
Taking its name from the mention of the &quot;Army of the Elephant&quot; in the first verse, this surah alludes to the Abyssinian campaign against Mecca possibly in the year 570 CE. Abrahah, the Christian viceroy of the Yemen (which at that time was ruled by the Abyssinians), erected a great cathedral at Sana&#x27;a, hoping thus to divert the annual Arabian pilgrimage from the Meccan sanctuary, the Kabah, to the new church. When this hope remained unfulfilled, he was determined to destroy the Kabah; and so he set out against Mecca at the head of a large army, which included several war elephants as well, and thus represented something hitherto unknown and utterly astounding to the Arabs: hence the designation of that year, by contemporaries as well as historians of later generations, as &quot;the Year of the Elephant&quot;. Abrahah&#x27;s army was destroyed on its march - by an extremely huge flock of martin swallow birds (ababil) that dropped tiny stones onto them and turned them to ashes. - and Abrahah himself died on his return to Sana.

The Arabs describe the year in which this event took place as the Year of the Elephant, and in the same year, Muhammad was born. The traditionists and historians almost unanimously state that the event of the people of the elephant had occurred in Muharram and Muhammad was born in Rabi&#x27; al-awwal. A majority of them states that he took birth 50 days after the event of the elephant.

==Period of revelation==
Surahs in the Qur&#x27;an are not arranged in the chronological order of revelation. Muhammad told his followers the placement in Quranic order of every Wahy revealed along with the original text of the Quran. Wm Theodore de Bary, an East Asian studies expert, describes that &quot;The final process of collection and codification of the Quran text was guided by one over-arching principle: God&#x27;s words must not in any way be distorted or sullied by human intervention. For this reason, no serious attempt, apparently, was made to edit the numerous revelations, organize them into thematic units, or present them in chronological order ...&quot;. &quot;Al-Fil&quot; is a Meccan sura and Meccan suras are chronologically earlier suras that were revealed to Muhammad at Mecca before the hijrah to Medina in 622 CE. They are typically shorter, with relatively short &quot;ayat&quot;, and mostly come near the end of the Qur&#x27;an&#x27;s 114 surahs. Most of the surahs containing &quot;muqatta&#x27;at&quot; are Meccan. Henceforth apart from traditions, this surah qualifies to be Meccan typically. Most of the &quot;mufassirun&quot; say that this is unanimously a Meccan sura; and if it is studied against its historical background it appears that it must have been sent down in the very earliest stage at Makkah.

==Principal subject==
The principal subject of the surah is a specific historic event. The year of Muhammad&#x27;s birth is identified as &#x27;the Year of the Elephant&#x27;, when Mecca was attacked by Abraha accompanied by an elephant. Quranic exegetes interpreted that God saved the Meccans from this force by sending a swarm of birds that pelted the invaders with clay stones and destroyed them. The army of Abraha destroyed for attacking the Kaabah is a reminder and an example that Allah can save His house (Al-Ka&#x27;bah) by destroying an army of 60,000 with elephants, through a flock of birds. The origin of the word &quot;sijjīl&quot; (i.e. Lava stone from Volcanic eruption) in verse 4 has the etymology proposed as Persian &quot;sang&quot; and &quot;gil&quot; (&#x27;stone&#x27; and &#x27;clay&#x27;), or Aramaic &quot;sgyl&quot; (&#x27;smooth altar stone&#x27;). In the Quran &#x27;sijjīl&#x27; occurs in two other verses: 11:82 and 15:74.

==Theme of the surah==
There are almost 7 divisions in the entire Qur&#x27;an according to Themes. The final of these 7 sections starts from surah Al-Mulk [surah number 67] to surah Al-Nas [surah number 114]. This final part [last 7th of the Quran] focuses on; sources of Reflection, People, their final scenes they will face on Judgment Day and Hellfire and Paradise in general and Admonition to the Quraysh about their fate in the Herein and the Hereafter if they deny Muhammad, specifically. 
In this Surah, God&#x27;s punishment which was inflicted on the people of the elephant is referred to and described very briefly because it was an event of recent occurrence, and everyone in Makkah and Arabia was fully aware of it. That is why the Arabs believed that the Ka&#x27;bah was protected in this invasion, not by any god or goddess, but by God Almighty Himself. Then God alone was invoked by the Quraysh chiefs for help, and for quite a few years the people of Quraysh, having been impressed by this event, had worshiped none but God. Therefore, there was no need to mention the details in Surah Al-Feel, but only a reference to it was enough. Javed Ahmad Ghamidi (b. 1951), a well-known Pakistani Muslim theologian, Quran scholar and exegete, and educationist, explains the theme of Surah Al-Fil is to inform the Quraysh that the God – Who routed His enemies in this manner before them – will also not spare them now that they too have shown enmity to Him. They will also be devastated in a similar manner.

==Coherence with adjacent surahs==
The idea of textual relation between the verses of a chapter has been discussed under various titles such as &quot;nazm&quot; and &quot;munasabah&quot; in non-English literature and &quot;coherence&quot;, &quot;text relations&quot;, &quot;intertextuality&quot;, and &quot;unity&quot; in English literature. Hamiduddin Farahi, an Islamic scholar of the Indian subcontinent, is known for his work on the concept of nazm, or coherence, in the Quran. Fakhruddin al-Razi (died 1209 CE), Zarkashi (died 1392) and several other classical as well as contemporary Quranic scholars have contributed to the studies.

===Connection with previous surahs===
In surahs Al-Qaria (No. 101) to Al-Humaza (No. 104), it is pointed to the Quraysh that they have remained so possessed with the love of wealth and children that they have grossly failed to fulfill the rights of God as well as their fellow beings. Despite this, they still claim to be the heirs of Abraham and Ishmael and the custodians of the Baytullah (House of God) built by them.

===Connection with next surah===
This Surah Al-Fil and the next one, Quraysh, form a pair in subject matter according to most Quranic scholars. The former of the pair warns the Quraysh about the Incident of the Elephant to inspire fear in God, while the latter surah urges them to keep in mind the favors they enjoy, because of the Baytullah and consequently to give up rebelliousness against God and worship Him alone. They are cautioned that they have been blessed with peace and sustenance, not because of their efforts or because they were entitled to them, but because of the Prophet Abraham&#x27;s invocation and the blessings of the House which he built. Therefore, instead of showing vanity, it is their obligation to worship the Lord of this House, who fed them in hunger and secured them against every kind of danger.

==Hadith about Surah Al-Fil==
* Narrated Al-Muttalib bin &#x27;Abdullah bin Qais bin Makhramah: from his father, from his grandfather, that he said: &quot;I and the Messenger of God, were born in the Year of the Elephant&quot; - he said: &quot;And Uthman ibn Affan asked Qubath bin Ashyam, the brother of Banu Ya&#x27;mar bin Laith - &#x27;Are you greater (in age) or the Messenger of God?&#x27;&quot; He said: &quot;The Messenger of God is greater than me, but I have an earlier birthday.&quot; He said: &quot;And I saw the defecation of the elephant turning green.&quot;
* The event took place at Muhassir by the Muhassab valley, between Muzdalifah and Mina. According to the Sahih Muslim and Abu Dawood, in the description of Muhammad&#x27;s The Farewell Pilgrimage that Imam Ja&#x27;far as-Sadiq has related from his father, Imam Muhammad al-Baqir, and he from Jabir ibn Abd-Allah, he says that when Muhammed proceeded from Muzdalifah to Mina, he increased his speed in the valley of Muhassir. Imam Al-Nawawi has explained it saying that the incident of the people of the elephant had occurred there; therefore, the pilgrims have been enjoined to pass by quickly, for Muhassir is a tormented place. Imam Malik in Mu&#x27;atta has related that Muhammad said that &quot;the whole of Muzdalifah is a fit place for staying but one should not stay in the valley of Muhassir&quot;.
* Narrated by Miswar bin Makhrama and Marwan I (whose narrations attest each other) that: God&#x27;s Messenger set out at the time of Treaty of Hudaybiyyah ... (at a place) The she-camel of the Prophet (ﷺ) sat down. The people tried their best to cause the she-camel to get up but in vain, so they said, &quot;Al-Qaswa&#x27; (i.e. the she-camel&#x27;s name) has become stubborn! Al-Qaswa&#x27; has become stubborn!&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Al-Qaswa&#x27; has not become stubborn, for stubbornness is not her habit, but she was stopped by Him Who stopped the elephant.&quot; Then he said, &quot;By the Name of Him in Whose Hands my soul is, if they (i.e. the Quraish infidels) ask me anything which will respect the ordinances of God, I will grant it to them.&quot; The Prophet then rebuked the she-camel and she got up. ...
* Narrated Abu Hureyrah that: &quot;When God, the Exalted and Majestic, granted God&#x27;s Messenger victory over Mecca (Conquest of Mecca), he stood before people and praised and extolled God and then said: Verily God held back the elephants from Mecca and gave the domination of it to His Messenger and believers, and it (this territory) was not violable to anyone before me and it was made violable to me for an hour of a day, and it shall not be violable to anyone after me. So neither molest the game nor weed out thorns from it. And it is not lawful for anyone to pick up a thing dropped but one who makes a public announcement of it. And it a relative of anyone is killed he is entitled to opt for one of two things. Either he should be paid blood-money or he can take life as (a just retribution). ...

<doc id="1188832" wikidata="Q1733969" url="?curid=1188832" title="Ring 2">
<text>is a 1999 Japanese supernatural horror film, directed by Hideo Nakata and serves as a sequel to &quot;Ring&quot;.

&quot;Ring&quot; was originally a novel written by Koji Suzuki; its sequel, &quot;Rasen&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Spiral&quot;), was also adapted into a film as the sequel to &quot;Ring&quot;. Due to the terrible response to &quot;Rasen&quot;, &quot;Ring 2&quot; was made as a new sequel to &quot;Ring&quot;. However it was not based on Suzuki&#x27;s works, thus it ultimately ignores the story of &quot;Rasen&quot;.

&quot;Ring 2&quot; takes place four weeks after the first film, directly continuing the story which of course features most of the cast from &quot;Ringu &quot; reprising their roles.

==Plot==
After retrieving Sadako Yamamura&#x27;s body from a well, the police summon her uncle Takashi to identify her. Detective Omuta informs Takashi that, according to forensics, Sadako survived in the well for 30 years. The remains are returned to Takashi, who gives them a burial at sea, hoping to be free from the guilt he has carried since her mother, Shizuko, committed suicide because of his actions. 

Following the sudden deaths of Reiko Asakawa&#x27;s ex-husband Ryuji Takayama and her father Koichi, the police look for her and her son Yoichi. Ryuji&#x27;s assistant, Mai Takano, and Reiko&#x27;s colleague, Okazaki, search for answers together. After they find a burned videotape in Reiko&#x27;s apartment, Mai senses Reiko&#x27;s father died the same way as Ryuji.

Investigating the urban legend of the cursed videotape, Okazaki meets a high school student, Kanae Sawaguchi. She gives him a copy of the tape but admits she watched it herself. She begs Okazaki to watch the tape before the week is up, but he hides his copy in his desk drawer at work.

Trying to contact Masami Kurahashi, a friend of Reiko&#x27;s niece Tomoko, Mai, and Okazaki learn she is now mute and has a phobia of televisions after witnessing Tomoko&#x27;s death. Dr. Oisho Kawajiri, Masami&#x27;s doctor and a paranormal researcher, tries to expel the psychic energy within Masami through experimentation. Mai steps out for some air, encountering Masami, whose presence causes Sadako to materialize on television and terrify the patients. Masami tries to channel her fear into psychic vessel Mai, who realizes Yoichi has been trying to do the same thing.

Mai finds Yoichi and Reiko in a shopping mall. Yoichi has been mute since his father and grandfather&#x27;s deaths and his psychic abilities intensified. Reiko asks if Kawajiri can help. Returning to the hospital, Mai discovers that Okazaki has accidentally led the police to Kawajiri, who has informed them of Mai&#x27;s contact with Reiko. Mai, Okazaki, and Detective Omuta observe Kawajiri&#x27;s experiment to exorcise the psychic energy from Masami by projecting her mental imagery onto a blank tape. However, it causes the cursed videotape&#x27;s imagery to appear. Mai destroys the recording. Omuta tortures Mai into revealing Reiko and Yoichi&#x27;s location, forcing Mai to view Kanae&#x27;s fear-contorted corpse. Overcome with guilt, Mai telepathically tells Yoichi to flee the police station. Yoichi psychically attacks the cops and escapes with Reiko, who is consequentially hit and crushed underneath a truck. Yoichi begins to psychically kill Omuta, but Mai stops him, and the two run off together. Okazaki attempts to delete his interview with Kanae, only for her ghost to materialize and haunt him.

Mai and Yoichi travel to Oshima Island and stay in the Yamamura Inn. Yoichi has a nightmare, causing Shizuko&#x27;s and a young Sadako&#x27;s ghosts to appear before Mai wards them away. Dr. Kawajiri arrives in the night, offering to exorcise Yoichi as he tried with Masami, with Mai volunteering to act as a conduit to expel Sadako&#x27;s hatred into a swimming pool, water being able to neutralize the energy. The attempt goes awry, and Sadako&#x27;s coffin appears in the pool. Takashi jumps in demanding to be taken by Sadako, while Kawajiri dives into the pool carrying electrical equipment, killing themselves alongside their assistant.

Mai and Yoichi fall into the water, appearing inside the well. Ryuji&#x27;s ghost appears, absorbing Yoichi&#x27;s fear, and summons a rope that will guide Mai to safety as long as she doesn&#x27;t look down. Sadako&#x27;s ghost appears, scaling the well only to cryptically ask, &quot;Why is it only you were saved?&quot;. Mai and Yoichi emerge in the pool, tentatively free of their fear. While Okazaki is institutionalized, a nurse takes a picture of him. As she leaves the room she notices something in the photo, seemingly shocked; behind Okazaki is Kanae&#x27;s laughing spirit looking for revenge.

==Release==
&quot;Ring 2&quot; was released in Japan on January 23, 1999 where it was distributed by Toho. It was released on a double bill with the film &quot;Shikoku&quot;. In the Philippines, the film was released as &quot;Ring 2: Call of Evil&quot; on March 5, 2003. The film was released directly to video in the United States on August 23, 2005 by DreamWorks.

===Box office===
It was the second highest-grossing Japanese film of 1999 (after &quot;Pokémon: The Movie 2000&quot;), earning a distribution income (rentals) of upon its theatrical release. &quot;Ring 2&quot; grossed a total Japanese box office revenue of ().

In South Korea, the film sold 128,521 tickets. In France, the film sold 22,263 tickets, bringing the film&#x27;s total overseas box office to 150,784 ticket sales.

===Home media===
In the United Kingdom, it was watched by 360,000 viewers on television during the first half of 2005, making it the seventh most-watched foreign-language film on UK television during that period. The original &quot;Ring&quot; also drew 390,000 viewers on UK television during the same period, adding up to a combined 750,000 UK television viewership for both &quot;Ring&quot; films during the first half of 2005.

==Reception==

&quot;Variety&quot; referred to the film as a &quot;very different beast&quot; than the &quot;Ring&quot;, with &quot;less atmosphere and more genre shocks&quot;. The review stated that the film &quot;notably fails to build on the first movie&#x27;s wonderfully nasty final scene&quot; and is &quot;progressively more conventional with no special visual style or under-the-skins frissons&quot;.

As a result of the film&#x27;s popularity, one of the film&#x27;s cast members, Kyoko Fukada (role of Kanae Sawaguchi), was offered a recording contract with Pony Canyon (the label that handled the releases of the film&#x27;s soundtrack and its accompanying single), and her debut single was released by Pony Canyon on May 19, 1999.

&quot;Ring 2&quot; holds a 7% percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on fourteen reviews.

==Legacy==
A prequel film was released the following year, &quot;Ring 0: Birthday&quot; (2000), based on the &quot;Lemon Heart&quot; segment of the Suzuki anthology novel &quot;Birthday&quot; in the &quot;Ring&quot; novel series. 13 years after this film’s release, the soft reboot &quot;Sadako 3D&quot; (2012) was released, loosely based on the Suzuki novel &quot;S&quot;, from the aforementioned &quot;Ring&quot; novel series. It ignores the continuity of this film and instead acknowledges the film &quot;Rasen&quot;, the original forgotten sequel that this film was meant to replace.

In 2019, a follow-up to this film was released called &quot;Sadako&quot; (2019), a direct sequel to &quot;Ring 2&quot; that follows its own continuity separate from the &quot;Rasen&quot; continuity.

<text>Soundview is a neighborhood on the Clason Point peninsula, on the southern section of the borough of the Bronx in New York City. Its boundaries, starting from the north and moving clockwise, are the Cross-Bronx Expressway to the north, White Plains Road to the east, Lacombe Avenue to the south, and the Bronx River to the west. The Bruckner Expressway bisects the neighborhood horizontally along the center and the Bronx River Parkway runs north to south. Soundview Avenue is the primary thoroughfare through Soundview.

==History==

Most development initially concentrated near the IRT Pelham Line on Westchester Avenue and in close proximity to Soundview Avenue (once served by a streetcar). Prior to the late 20th century, large parcels across the neighborhood remained undeveloped. Some land in the neighborhood was used in 1947 for a temporary New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) housing project made up of 947 apartments in 473 Quonset huts. One remaining Quonset hut is still visible on the south side of Seward Avenue at Croes Avenue. In 1941 Clason Point Gardens was the first development constructed by the NYCHA in the Bronx. It was followed by many other NYCHA developments across the neighborhood from the 1950s until the 1970s, which boosted the population significantly. During the 1950s, two controlled-access highways, the Bronx River Parkway and Bruckner Expressway, were constructed. Later in the 1970s, large high-rise rental and co-op apartment complexes were constructed across the neighborhood following the establishment of the Mitchell Lama program.

Like neighboring Hunts Point, Soundview began to fall into rapid decay in the 1970s due to white flight, growing poverty rates, and a citywide fiscal crisis. Abandonment was a problem as the exodus picked up pace but much of the White non-Hispanic population was replaced by poor and working class Latin Americans and African Americans. As a result, abandonment was much less extensive than in neighborhoods to the west including Morrisania. The neighborhood was gravely affected by the crack epidemic throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, setting yearly murder totals among the highest in the city. During that time, the Weed and Seed program was put into place by the federal government to improve the situation in Soundview, nearby Mott Haven, and East New York, Brooklyn and later Operation Impact. Policing methods include NYPD monitored CCTV along known high drug trafficking areas, increased foot presence, and improved statistical mapping.

In 1999, an unarmed man, Amadou Diallo, was shot and killed by four plainclothes officers near the corner of Wheeler and Westchester Avenues.

Starting in the 2000s, a citywide housing crisis spurred construction of modern multi-unit row houses and apartment buildings. Many are multi zoned for retail and have mixed-income qualifications. There are also plans to develop this type of housing on vacant land within the confines of NYCHA property along with significant renovations and improvements to existing grounds and buildings. Soundview Park, built on a former landfill and the largest in the South Bronx, has undergone a complete transformation including enhanced pedestrian access and completely renovated and redesigned recreational areas. Future plans in accordance with PlaNYC initiatives will create an urban oasis in this dense community; complete with recreation nodes, Greenway connections, bike/hike trails, designated fishing areas, a boat launch, and esplanades with skyline views. The neighborhood has become increasingly more diverse with a rise in varied Latin American and Asian immigration in recent years. Crime has also seen a significant decline as a result of a number of factors including enhanced policing techniques and changing economic demographics.

<text>The One New Zealand Party was a small political party in New Zealand. It was partly modelled on the Australian One Nation party, founded by Pauline Hanson. Its primary focus was on matters such as the Treaty of Waitangi, but its wider platform was broadly paleoconservative or producerist. It strongly opposed the policies of the government at the time, accusing it of giving special privileges to Māori and of undermining the concept of &quot;one law for all&quot;. It claimed that the policies amount to a form of apartheid.

People involved with the party included Richard Fisher, John Porter, and Alan McCulloch, a former mayor of East Coast Bays.

One New Zealand was founded in 1999, and in the 1999 election, it won 0.06% of the vote. It had the shortest party list of any party in that election, with only one person, Walter Boyd. In the 2002 election, it won 0.09% of the vote. In the 2005 election, it won 0.02% of the vote.

In 2006, the party went into recess pending a decision as to whether the party would continue. In September, it was deregistered at its own request.

<doc id="1188863" wikidata="Q752789" url="?curid=1188863" title="Melodic motion">
<text>Melodic motion is the quality of movement of a melody, including nearness or farness of successive pitches or notes in a melody. This may be described as conjunct or disjunct, stepwise, skipwise or no movement, respectively. See also contrapuntal motion. In a conjunct melodic motion, the melodic phrase moves in a stepwise fashion; that is the subsequent notes move up or down a semitone or tone, but no greater. In a disjunct melodic motion, the melodic phrase leaps upwards or downwards; this movement is greater than a whole tone. 
In popular Western music, a melodic leap of disjunct motion is often present in the chorus of a song, to distinguish it from the verses and captivate the audience.

== In traditional culture music ==
Ethnomusicologist Bruno Nettl describes various types of melodic movement or contour to categorise a song&#x27;s melody.

There are three general categories, &quot;ascending&quot;, &quot;descending&quot;, and &quot;undulating&quot;:
*&quot;Ascending&quot;: Upwards melodic movement (only found in remote regions).
*&quot;Descending&quot;: Downwards melodic movement (prevalent in the New World and Australian music).
*&quot;Undulating&quot;: Equal movement in both directions, using approximately the same intervals for ascent and descent (prevalent in Old World culture music). Usually concludes with a descending progression.
**&quot;Pendulum&quot;: Extreme form of undulating movement that covers a large range and uses large intervals is called pendulum-type melodic movement. Like undulating melodies, usually concludes with a descending progression.
According to Nettl, undulating and descending melodies are far more common than ascending ones.

He also identifies additional specialized types which characterise musical styles with exceptionally homogenous contours, named after the melody contour&#x27;s trace.
*&quot;Tile&quot;, &quot;terrace&quot;, or &quot;cascading&quot;: a number of descending phrases in which each phrase begins on a higher pitch than the last ended (prevalent in the North American Plain Indians music).
*&quot;Arc&quot;: The melody rises and falls in roughly equal amounts, the curve ascending gradually to a climax and then dropping off (prevalent among Navajo and North American Indian music)

In addition to this, &quot;rise&quot;, which may be considered a musical form, is a contrasting section of higher pitch, a &quot;musical plateau&quot;.

Other examples include:
*Double tonic: smaller pendular motion in one direction

These all may be modal frames or parts of modal frames.

<text>Operation Auxin was an Australian Federal Police operation in September 2004, leading to the arrest of almost 200 people on charges of child pornography. These people were all accused of purchasing child pornography over the Internet, using their credit cards, from Belarusian crime syndicates; the credit card payments had been processed by a company named Landslide.com in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Among the accused were people holding positions of trust in the community, such as police officers (including one officer assigned to investigate child pornography), members of the military, teachers, and ministers of religion. Several of the suspects committed suicide. It was the follow-up to the U.S. FBI operation Operation Avalanche. And has been associated with Operation FALCON.

==US investigation==

Between 1999 and 2001, after a tip, a US investigation was conducted into Landslide Productions Inc., a Texas-based online pornography portal operated by Thomas and Janice Reedy. The portal was found to have provided access to child pornography, and the Reedys were both convicted of trafficking child pornography in August 2001.

Following the investigation and conviction, &quot;Operation Avalanche&quot; was launched in the US to trace and prosecute child pornography users identified in the Landslide database. In addition, the website was run for a short time as part of a sting operation by the FBI to capture new suspects. The FBI also passed identities from the Landslide database to the police organisations of other countries, including 7,272 names to the UK.

==Legality==
===Legal challenges===
The initial credit card evidence used in the investigation has since been widely debunked due to the fact that there was no established link between a credit card being used and actual pornography being downloaded. Additionally, multiple cases of credit card fraud involving organised crime syndicates have also raised the possibility that credit card numbers retrieved from Landslide.com may have been used by a third party and not their owners at all.

Similarly, Operation Ore in the United Kingdom has come under intense fire, both from those wrongfully convicted and from civil rights groups.

<text>Marcellino Pipite is a Vanuatuan politician and former school administration, who was first elected to Parliament in 2004. He was the foreign minister of Vanuatu from November 2004 until December 2004, in the government of Serge Vohor. He was previously the minister for comprehensive reform. He lost his position in the cabinet in December 2004 when the Vohor government fell.

He was elected as the Speaker of the Parliament of Vanuatu on 16 June 2015, and served until October 2015.

On October 10, 2015, while serving as acting President, he pardoned himself and 13 other MPs who the Supreme Court had found guilty of bribery. President Baldwin Lonsdale, returning to Vanuatu hours after Pipite&#x27;s pardon has been issued, declared that nobody is above the law and revoked the pardon, a decision upheld by the Supreme Court of Vanuatu. Pipite and 10 of the other MPs faced charges of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. Sentencing on the bribery charges went ahead and Pipite was jailed for 3 years, together with most of the other convicted MPs.

<text>Herold Leonhard Driedger (March 28, 1942 – October 1, 2024) was a politician in the Canadian province of Manitoba. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1988 to 1990, representing the Winnipeg riding of Niakwa for the Manitoba Liberal Party.

Driedger worked as a teacher before entering public life. He first sought election to the Manitoba legislature in the 1986 provincial election, running for Sidney Green&#x27;s Progressive Party in the riding of Radisson. He received only 240 votes, as against 4810 for the winning candidate, New Democrat Gerard Lecuyer.

In the 1988 provincial election, he ran as a Liberal in Niakwa and defeated incumbent Progressive Conservative Abe Kovnats by 1354 votes. The Liberals increased their parliamentary representation from one to twenty in this election, and Driedger sat in the official opposition benches for the next two years. In the 1990 election, he was defeated by Progressive Conservative candidate Louise Dacquay in the redistributed riding of Seine River by 47 votes, amid a general loss of support for the Liberal Party. He has not sought a return to political life since then.

In 1989-90, Driedger served as the first vice-president of the Canadian Council of Public Accountants (the president was Loyola Hearn, who was later a Conservative MP in the House of Commons of Canada). He is also a member of the Canadian Prostate Cancer Network.

<text>The Brig–Zermatt railway line is a metre gauge railway line in the canton of Valais in Switzerland. Its line links the communities of Brig and Visp in the Rhone Valley with Täsch and the car free holiday resort of Zermatt in the Mattertal. The line also forms part of the much travelled and admired route of the Glacier Express between St. Moritz and Zermatt. The Gornergratbahn (which was opened in 1898) is connected with the line at Zermatt.

The line was originally built by the Visp-Zermatt-Bahn (VZ), and opened between Visp and Zermatt in 1890–1891. The extension to Brig opened in 1930. The company was renamed the Brig-Visp-Zermatt-Bahn (BVZ) in 1961, and was later branded as BVZ Zermatt-Bahn. It merged with the Furka Oberalp Bahn (FO) in 2003 to form the Matterhorn Gotthard Bahn (MGB).

==History==
===Planning, construction and commencement of traffic===

The mountain village of Zermatt first gained major recognition in Europe in light of the inaugural ascent of the Matterhorn by Edward Whymper in 1865. From then onwards, the number of overnight visitors rose steadily, even though the village itself was only reachable by a lengthy march on foot through the barren valley of Zermatt. Even the simple mule ride as far as St. Niklaus took a long time. Nevertheless, by the 1880s there were already as many as 12,000 tourist visits to Zermatt each year. To promote tourism in the valley, and especially in Zermatt itself, plans soon emerged to build a railway line intended to connect the emerging spa with the Rhone Valley.

On 21 September 1886, the Swiss Federal Council granted the banking house &quot;Masson, Chavannes &amp; Co.&quot; in Lausanne and the &quot;Basler Handelsbank&quot; an initial concession. The original request was for a narrow gauge railway from Visp to Zermatt, using a mixture of adhesion and rack railway line. At the insistence of the Bundesrat, the gauge was finally altered to metre gauge. The railway was at the outset to be operated from the start of June to the end of September, as the promoters did not wish to take on the risks of operating the line in an alpine winter. Additionally, it was only in summer that there were prospects of significant numbers of passengers, as in those days winter tourism was still of no great importance. Nevertheless, the Bundesrat reserved the right to extend the operating season, and similarly stipulated that concessionary fares be offered to locals.

Planning and construction of the line was entrusted by the participating banks to the railway company &quot;Suisse Occidentale-Simplon&quot; (SOS), which, in the summer of 1887, conducted extensive survey work in the Mattertal. On 10 October 1888, the &quot;Compagnie du Chemin de Fer de Viège à Zermatt SA&quot; emerged as the operating company.

The exact route and mode of operation was initially the subject of intense debate. The Suisse Occidentale-Simplon proposed a pure adhesion line, with a maximum gradient of 4.5%, while the engineer Ernest von Stockalper, who was working on the construction of the Gotthardbahn, proposed a combined adhesion and rack railway, as originally planned. A Special Commission established to investigate the ideal mode of operation visited, for the purpose of its investigations, numerous rack railways in Switzerland and Germany, including the Brünigbahn and the Rübelandbahn in the Harz, which was equipped with the Abt rack rail system. These visits led to a decision to equip the line with the system used on the Rübelandbahn, and using a maximum gradient of 12.5%. A total of six sections of track were to be laid out with a total of 7450 m of rack railway.
Construction began on 27 November 1888 in Visp. The work was entrusted to the western Swiss contractors Julius Chappuis, while the SOS undertook the purchase of land and the procurement of rolling stock. Acquisition of the necessary land turned out to be difficult, particularly in the municipalities of Stalden and St. Niklaus, as the local population was not interested in selling. Tedious expropriation procedures therefore became necessary. Also, land in the entire valley was divided into a myriad of tiny plots, and usually the actual owners of the plots were not recorded in official documents. The absence of a road made it necessary to transport the building materials almost exclusively over the already completed parts of the railway tracks to the construction sites.

On 3 July 1890, rail traffic on the first part of the line, between Visp and Stalden, could finally be introduced. By 26 August of the same year, the first trains reached St. Niklaus. In the following months, however, an unusually severe winter delayed the completion of the remaining sections. Only on 18 July 1891 could the entire line as far as Zermatt be handed over to traffic.

===The first years of operations===

The Visp-Zermatt-Bahn (VZ) transferred the management of the line to the Suisse Occidentale-Simplon, as under that arrangement there was the possibility of using its staff elsewhere during the annual winter service interruption. This management agreement was approved by the SOS&#x27;s successor company, the Jura-Simplon-Bahn (JS) and retained finally also by the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) until 1920.

From the opening of the line onwards, passenger numbers continually increased, and after a short while were already significantly exceeding the predictions established at the time of the line&#x27;s construction. Yet at the same time, the railway had to fight countless storms that again and again paralysed operations for days. The opening of the Gornergratbahn in 1898, the Simplon Tunnel in 1906 and the Lötschbergbahn in 1913 brought the Visp-Zermatt-Bahn further passengers. However, the upward trend met with an abrupt end at the outbreak of World War I. Foreign tourists stayed away from Switzerland, while coal prices massively increased. Passenger numbers fell back to the level of 1891. The timetable had to be substantially reduced, and fares strongly increased, but a cost covering operation was no longer possible. In the summer timetable for 1914, there were still six train pairs per day between Visp and Zermatt. After the outbreak of war there were only three, and from 1918 just two train pairs. In 1918, the total loss amounted to around 971,000 francs.

After the war, passenger numbers initially increased again only slowly. In the midst of the emerging boom, a flood on 24 September 1920 destroyed about 300 metres of the formation between Visp and Ackersand. Even this event came after the Vispa had already been diverted during the winter of 1919/20 by avalanches and landslides onto the formation at Kin, causing serious damage. The resulting deficit, which to this day is the most recent in the history of the railway, gave the SBB a reason not to renew the expiring management contracts, and to return the management of the railway to the VZ from 1 January 1921. The railway&#x27;s management was then allocated to a collective directorate also responsible for managing the Gornergratbahn. At the same time, in collaboration with Zermatt hoteliers, an office was set up to run the first international promotions for the Zermatt tourist resort. In 1927, passenger numbers once again reached pre war levels. In 1931, with 227,845 passengers, the line set a new record that was not surpassed until after World War II.

===Closing the gap, electrification and year-round operations===

==== The rescue of the Furka Oberalp Bahn ====
The Visp-Zermatt-Bahn survived World War 1 unscathed. Totally different was the situation of the Brig-Furka-Disentis-Bahn (BFD), which was not yet completed as at the outbreak of the war. The BFD was able, by 1915, only to complete the section between Brig and Gletsch, and in 1923 had to file for bankruptcy. VZ Director Auguste Marguerat then took the initiative to preserve the line as a whole, including the section not yet built. A syndicate was formed, with the support of the Swiss Federation and the Cantons of Valais, Uri, Grisons and Vaud. On 4 April 1925, the railway facilities and rolling stock of the bankrupt line were purchased for 1.75 million francs. On 17 April 1925 came the founding of the &quot;Furka Oberalp Bahn AG&quot; (FO), with share capital of 3.3 million francs. As early as 4 July 1926, operations could commence on the whole FO line as far as Disentis. The FO was initially operated by the VZ, and only on 1 January 1961 spun off as a separate operation.

====Closing the gap Brig–Visp====
The entry into operation of the Furka Oberalp Bahn revealed a disadvantage, namely the gap between the end point of the VZ in Visp, and that of the FO in Brig. Additionally, since the opening of the Lötschbergbahn in 1913 passengers arriving from the direction of Bern had had to change trains in Brig as well as in Visp; a circumstance that was perceived as cumbersome.

Even as at the start of the 20th century, numerous projects for a metre gauge railway line from Visp to Brig had already been proposed. Most of them also envisaged a continuation in the direction of Furka or Grimsel, but in the end the only continuation to be realised was the later Furka Oberalp Bahn, with its starting point in Brig.

In 1919, the hotelier Alexander Seiler applied for a concession for a metre gauge tramway from Visp to Brig, which, if built, would serve to open up the small settlements between the two towns. That project was terminated after the SBB stated that it would insert two halting points into its standard gauge line. As the SBB did not follow up this announcement, the concession application was resubmitted in 1925. Shortly afterwards, a committee comprising the VZ, the FO and the Lonza Group works at Visp took over the project. Under the leadership of the VZ, it was transformed into a connecting narrow gauge railway running parallel to the SBB line, was no longer equipped with any halting points, and was to serve only to link the VZ and the FO. In 1928, the committee presented a correspondingly modified concession application, which was approved on 28 September 1928, subject to a condition that one intermediate halting point be included. Following the completion of that project as approved, continuous operations from Brig to Zermatt were finally able to begin on 5 June 1930. Curiously, the opening of the new link did not lead directly to a name change for the Visp-Zermatt-Bahn. Only on 1 June 1962 was the name changed to &quot;Compagnie du Chemin de Fer de Brigue-Viège-Zermatt&quot; (Brig-Visp-Zermatt-Bahn).

The three narrow gauge lines now bound by rail - the Visp-Zermatt-Bahn, the Furka Oberalp Bahn and the Rhätische Bahn - took advantage of the opening of the new connection to introduce a through express train from St. Moritz to Zermatt. On 25 June 1930, the now world-famous Glacier Express departed from Zermatt station for the first time.

====Electrification====

Under pressure from the enormous increase in coal prices during World War I, there were discussions soon after the end of the war about electrification of the railway, to make it independent of expensive imported coal. A study commissioned in 1919 recommended the use of direct current, with a voltage of between 1500 and 3000 volts. To save costs, parts from steam locomotives would be used for the construction of electric locos, and at times consideration was given to purchasing railcars. As prices of copper and the necessary electrical systems were still extremely high in the immediate aftermath of the war, the electrification plan had to be abandoned in view of the still ailing financial resources of the VZ.

Not until 1927 were there once again plans for conversion to electric operations. Now, however, high tension alternating current, at a frequency of 16 Hz, was to be used. This offered, amongst other things, the advantage of requiring only one electrical insertion point, near Visp, which would drastically reduce the costs of electrical systems in comparison with the original plans. Consideration was also given to adopting completely the SBB system of 15 kV AC railway electrification without alteration, but that idea quickly had to be abandoned. In particular, the Rhätische Bahn, which since 1913 had been operating electric traffic at 11,000 volts AC on the Engadine Line, stressed the benefits of using lower voltage than the SBB voltage. Whereas light weight air cooled transformers could be used on the Engadine Line, a heavy oil cooling system would be necessary for 15,000 volt operations, and that would greatly have increased the weight of the VZ locomotives. Additionally, the use of a single phase current system would make problem free through traffic possible in the event of electrification of the Furka Oberalp Bahn. These advantages led to the decision to use a voltage of 11,000 volts also on the Visp-Zermatt-Bahn.

For the electrification of the railway facilities and the procurement of electric locomotives, a budget of 1.7 million francs was established. Responsibility for the supply of energy was transferred to the SBB, which was contractually obliged to make alternating current available in Visp, at a voltage of 15,000 volts. This energy supply was then transformed down to the required voltage. For the haulage of trains, five electric locomotives of Type HGe 4/4 were procured from SLM, SIG and MFO. As from 1 October 1929, all scheduled VZ trains could finally be operated by electricity. Of the total of eight existing steam locos of Type HG 2/3, the five oldest examples could be withdrawn. The rest remained further in service as reserves, and for snow removal.

====Introduction of winter operations====
As early as 1907, there were calls from the valley population and Zermatt hoteliers for the Visp-Zermatt-Bahn to operate also in winter. The SBB and the VZ refused to conduct such operations, however, due to the high costs that would result, and the consequent lack of profitability. Also, the danger of accidents due to avalanches and flooding was regarded as an incalculable risk. In addition, for a long time there was, on the part of the VZ, a stance that in any event Zermatt was not suited to being a winter resort. The Valais Council of State, which viewed the prospect of winter traffic positively, therefore considered the possibility of extending the obligation to operate the VZ to the winter months, at least for the section from Visp to St. Niklaus. As the concession text was limited to stipulating running times, and as, in the absence of any precedent, an amendment to the concession against the wishes of the concession holder would not be feasible, further efforts were abandoned until 1914. With the outbreak of World War I, the demand for continuous operations became obsolete for the time being.

Further efforts towards continuous operation gathered force only in the mid-1920s. Zermatt hotels remained open for the first time continuously for the winter in 1927/28. Meanwhile, the VZ had recognised the importance of Zermatt for winter sports, and became more co-operative. On 30 October 1928, the VZ operated timetabled winter traffic for the first time as far as St. Niklaus. In the following winter, a single train pair ran each day as far as Zermatt, weather permitting. This mode of operation could be maintained until the end of 1930. In January and February 1931, however, numerous avalanches made regular operations impossible. It became clear that a regulated winter traffic without shelters was really not feasible. In 1932, the Canton of Valais and the VZ therefore entered into a contract relating to winter traffic. The contract provided, on the one hand, for continuous winter traffic on the VZ, and, on the other hand, obliged the Canton to subsidise the erection of shelters to the extent of 50%. The shelters were completed on time in the autumn of 1933. Thus, in the following winter continuous winter operations could be offered for the first time along the entire route.

===World War II, the postwar period and recovery===
The outbreak of war in 1939 had a much less dramatic impact on rail traffic than had been the case in 1914. Although this time once again foreign tourists stayed away from the Mattertal, there were nevertheless Swiss excursioners who, thanks to the previously introduced income compensation, could afford to travel even during the war, along with military transport to secure the full utilisation of capacity. Thanks to electrification, the once again strongly increasing coal prices also had no further effect on rail traffic. During the war years, passenger numbers increased continuously, and in 1945, with 265,473 people transported, reached a new high point.

After the war, passenger numbers continued to rise strongly. In 1961, they surpassed the million mark for the first time, but took a short term hit in 1963, due to a typhoid epidemic in Zermatt. Also goods traffic increased, especially to serve the construction of power stations in the Saas Valley massive rises in demand in Zermatt. The VZ took advantage of the upturn to modernise rail operations gradually: between 1958 and 1989 all major bridges (apart from the Kipfenbrücke, which, after its destruction by an avalanche in 1947 was reerected as a steel bridge) were replaced by reinforced concrete structures, which enabled an increase in axle loadings.
Rolling stock was also renewed. The passenger cars, mainly still dating from the steam era, and equipped with open platform ends, were replaced between 1955 and 1963 by passenger cars of modern light steel construction with centre entrances. The locomotives from the time of electrification were supplemented between 1960 and 1965 by five passenger railcars. To increase safety, a remote controlled block signalling system was installed along the complete line from Brig between 1965 and 1966.

The avalanche shelters along the whole line were similarly continuously extended. The devastation of Zermatt station on 4 January 1966 presented the opportunity for a complete rebuild of the whole station, and the installation of avalanche proof roofing. The same year, an avalanche gallery was erected on the northern part of the station. Construction of avalanche proof roofing began in 1982 and ended in 1989.

The opening of the valley road as far as Täsch in 1971 resulted in a new focus of passenger volumes. Since then, many tourists have driven with their own cars to Täsch, where they have to change to the trains of the BVZ, as the road to Zermatt remains closed to car traffic to this day, and can only be used with special permission. To cope with the additional passenger numbers from Täsch, a commuter service was introduced in May 1972 between Täsch and Zermatt. This service has since transported around two thirds of all passengers arriving in Zermatt.

With the commissioning of four baggage railcars Deh 4/4 in 1975 and 1976, and their matching driving cars, it was possible, for the first time, to introduce shuttle trains on this important connection. Since then, trains on the entire line from Brig to Zermatt have been operated in increasing numbers as shuttle trains.

===Further modernisation and merger with the FO===

The 1980s were marked by ever increasing numbers of passengers. In particular, there was the continuing success of the Glacier Express. Running from 1982 all year round, its passenger numbers increased from about 20,000 in 1982 to 269,830 in 2005, and contributed to the utilisation of the railway and the reputation of Zermatt.

To cope with the increase in traffic, the station at Zermatt was completely rebuilt between 1982 and 1989. All of the platform tracks were given an avalanche proof canopy, and the west side of the track layout has since been bordered by a massive 300 metre long avalanche wall. The Zermatt station building, which had been in place ever since the opening of the line, was demolished and replaced by a larger new building.

A second major construction project followed between 1983 and 1984, with the erection of the Glisergrund Depot near Brig. This depot partially replaced the space-constrained depot facility at Visp station. By 1998, the Furka Oberalp Bahn had extended the Glisergrund site, by adding a further workshop hall. The complete depot site now occupies an area of around .

====The Randa landslide====
The biggest disaster in the history of the BVZ occurred in its jubilee year of 1991. On 18 April at 6.45 am, approximately 15 million cubic metres of rock broke away from the &quot;Wartfluh&quot; northwest of Randa and buried the Vispa and parts of the hamlet Lerc, along with 100 metres of railway track. No people were injured, as the hamlet Lerch was uninhabited and at the time of the landslide there was no train in the affected section of track. However, a goods train heading for Zermatt was left standing a few hundred metres north of the incident site, after its traction failed due to damage to the overhead line and the resulting short circuit. Passenger and goods traffic was temporarily moved to the road, which was left undamaged. Between Herbriggen and Randa, omnibuses operated bustitution services, and between Randa and Zermatt the trains ran in a shuttle service. As from 22 April, it was again possible to operate through goods trains, for which a diesel locomotive of type HGm 4/4 was hired from the Furka Oberalp Bahn. Passenger traffic initially remained suspended, as further landslides could not be ruled out.
On 9 May, large rocks fell into the valley once again, burying the railway tracks for 250 metres and also making the road along the valley impassable. Moreover, the alluvial fan dammed up the Vispa, causing the lower part of the hamlet slowly to become flooded. After heavy rains on 18 Juny 1991, the station was similarly left under water. Planning immediately began for a new route for rail and road that would by pass the disaster area. The new rail alignment, totalling 2860 m, was ready to be opened on 1 August 1991. However, a heavy thunderstorm on 8 August led to a blockage of the newly excavated river channel of the Vispa by washed up glacial rubble, which meant a second flooding of the station. After the water had flowed away to a sufficient extent, the rail traffic could once again be resumed on 10 August.

The total damage to the railway was valued at 16.5 Million francs, of which 13.59 Million could be alleviated by natural disaster relief under the Swiss Federal Railway Law. Due to the break in the track, which was closed for 105 days, the Jubilee festivities originally scheduled for July 1991 had to be postponed until October. During the Jubilee, the Brig-Visp-Zermatt-Bahn was renamed as the &quot;BVZ Zermatt-Bahn&quot;, to highlight more strongly the most important town on the line.

====Transformation to the Matterhorn Gotthard Bahn====

On 1 January 2003, the BVZ merged with the neighbouring Furka Oberalp Bahn to form the Matterhorn Gotthard Bahn. At the same time, the business of the two railways was split into the group companies &quot;Matterhorn Gotthard Verkehrs AG&quot; (passenger concession, rolling stock, maintenance, road traffic), &quot;Matterhorn Gotthard Infrastruktur AG&quot; (infrastructure concession, formations, buildings) and the &quot;Matterhorn Gotthard Bahn AG&quot; responsible for management of personnel and group management. All group companies belong to BVZ Holding, which has its origins in the BVZ, and ultimately to the Swiss federation and the Cantons of Valais, Uri and Grisons.

The merger of the two railways made possible the implementation of numerous development measures. By the end of 2006, the shuttle train terminal in Täsch had been fundamentally transformed, and the number of covered parking spaces increased to 1700. In connection with the opening of the Lötschberg Base Tunnel, the Visp railway station was completely rebuilt. Beginning in 2005, the MGB lines were moved from the station forecourt to points adjacent to the existing standard gauge tracks so as to minimise the walking distances for transferring passengers.

==Description of the line==

=== Brig–Visp ===

Since 1930, the starting point for the line to Zermatt has been Brig station. Until the merger of the two railways, the metre gauge part of this station was owned by the FO, and the BVZ therefore had to pay a fee for using it. Erected in 1915 by the then Brig-Furka-Disentis-Bahn, Brig&#x27;s metre gauge station extends over three platform tracks and is located at the forecourt of Brig&#x27;s standard gauge station, where there are connections with BLS and SBB trains heading towards the Lötschberg, Lake Geneva and Simplon Tunnel. With the opening of the Lötschberg base tunnel, a large portion of the travellers changing for Zermatt now make the change at Visp. Brig&#x27;s metre gauge station is now a through station. Its previous configuration as a terminal station came to an end with the opening of new tracks leading from the metre gauge station directly to the east towards Goms. The new track formation, which was first used on 1 December 2007, replaced a section through Naters that was equipped with many level crossings. Currently, the town of Brig is seeking the complete removal of the narrow gauge system from the station forecourt, and its incorporation into the standard gauge station.

Along the line to Visp there were, in earlier times, an FO depot and a train shed also used by the BVZ. These facilities were closed down in 2001. Nearby, the line crosses the Saltina on an iron bridge dating from 1930. Thereafter, the metre gauge line runs largely parallel to the SBB&#x27;s standard gauge Rhonetalstrecke, along the southern bank of the Rhone. West of the Brig suburb of Glis there is the (ex BVZ) Glisergrund Depot, erected between 1984 and 1998, and Glisergrund Workshops (ex FO), which together now accommodate a large portion of the MGB&#x27;s rolling stock. Approximately four kilometres west of Brig is the Gamsensand passing loop, which also has freight sidings for the loading of tank wagons. The former &quot;Gamsen&quot; station was about 300 metres east of the passing loop. This station was abandoned at the beginning of the 1990s, after the cable car to Mund, which started from there, was shut down.

The next stop, &quot;Eyholz&quot;, is already in the municipal area of Visp. This stop was created in 1999 and serves primarily to connect the line with a nearby shopping centre. Soon after Eyholz, the line enters Visp, passes the sprawling industrial premises of the Lonza Group and after about nine kilometres reaches Visp station. The length of line just traversed passes through a shallow gap, and between Brig and Visp climbs about 21 metres in altitude.

===Visp–Stalden===
The metre gauge station at Visp was originally located, as at Brig, in the forecourt of the SBB station building. South of the two metre gauge platform tracks there used to be a connection to the extensive depot and workshop facilities of the BVZ. For passenger traffic, the VZ had already erected a wooden shelter by the start of operations in 1890, and, even at that point, all of the other necessary facilities, such as toilets or a waiting hall, were provided within the standard gauge station building of the Jura-Simplon (until 1889, the Suisse Occidentale-Simplon).

A fundamental renovation of the station complex began in 2006. As it had been foreseen that, following the completion of the Lötschberg Base Tunnel, the majority of the passengers would change in Visp for trains to Zermatt, the narrow gauge and standard gauge tracks were relocated closer together. Ever since then, three platforms have been available to MGB trains. Narrow gauge track 3 is located immediately adjacent to the new standard gauge track 4. The station building and the entire BVZ depot area were demolished in parallel. All subsequent maintenance of railway vehicles has been carried out exclusively in the Glisergrund workshop. The ceremonial opening of the new junction station took place on 16 and 17 May 2008.

The track exits Visp station in a tight left hand curve, and the formation also passes into a steep decline, to pass under main road no 9. The underpass, erected between 1972 and 1975, also represents the lowest point of the entire line. The track then soon leaves the Rhone valley, and enters the Mattertal, leading through to the terminus at Zermatt. Here, the formation rises only slightly, in parallel to the valley road on the eastern side of the valley, as far as the village of Ackersand. The local stop there no longer serves the public, but is still required for rail traffic as a passing point. For a long time, a neighbouring hydroelectric station was served by a siding from this local stop.

Immediately afterwards, the railway crosses the Vispa by means of a concrete bridge erected in 1974. Shortly thereafter, the first rack section begins. This soon leads the formation along the western flank of the valley at the maximum gradient of 12.5 percent, and the line quickly reaches the station at Stalden-Saas.

===Stalden–St. Niklaus===

The station at Stalden, at around 799 metres above sea level, extends in an s-shape along the southwestern edge of the village. For a long time, the station itself was of great importance, as the departure point of the Postbus line into the Saastal. It was therefore equipped with a generously sized station building, the second largest on the line after the one in Zermatt. At the start of the 20th century, there were plans to build another railway line to Saas-Fee that would branch off here from the existing line; World War I, however, thwarted these plans. The importance of the station (which, since 1931, has had the official name &quot;Stalden-Saas&quot;) has decreased since the 1950s, as the departure point since then for the Postbus line has been Brig, not Stalden. Nevertheless, the buses still stop also at Stalden station, and form a connection there with the trains to Zermatt. Immediately adjacent to the railway tracks there is also the base station of the cable car to Staldenried. Since 1986, the two tracks at Stalden have been equipped with continuous rack rails, as there are inclines immediately before and after the station. In addition to the two platform tracks there is also a loading track for goods traffic.

The rack section, which begins at Ackersand, extends for a few hundred metres past Stalden. The line continues from there over a relatively flat section, along the right side of the increasingly narrowing valley, while the Vispa flows about 150 metres lower down, through a narrow gorge. The following section displays the first still relatively short tunnels, as well as the largest bridge on the line. The 67-metre-long &quot;Mühlebachviadukt&quot; spans its eponymous waters at a height of 43 metres. Its original steel truss structure was replaced in 1959 by a reinforced concrete arch bridge.

At 19.8 kilometres, the station at Kalpetran is finally reached. The actual site has only a few buildings, the main function of the station being to allow connections with the cable car linking the station to the mountain village of Embd. Behind the station, the railway line meets the Mattervispa again, and switches to the left side of the valley. The &quot;Kipfenbrücke&quot; located here has had to be rebuilt several times: the original 30 metre long steel truss structure was destroyed in 1945 by an avalanche. A subsequent temporary measure was replaced in 1947 by a steel fish belly girder bridge, which, in turn, was itself destroyed by an avalanche in 1999. A steel girder bridge erected as a replacement was replaced in autumn 2007 by a 146-metre-long concrete bridge further downstream. The latest bridge also serves the road to Kalpetran. With the opening of a new rail section here totalling 1.2 km, the last 80 metre radius curves remaining on the open line were eliminated.

A few metres behind the Kipfenbrücke the second rack section begins. The next part of the route, through the &quot;Kipfenschlucht&quot;, is considered to be the most scenic portion of the entire line. The railway and the Vispa run here in a most confined space, adjacent to each other. This whole section has been repeatedly damaged by flooding and avalanches, sometimes severely. To avoid further damage, the Vispa has therefore been increasingly regulated since the end of the 19th century, and the line formation protected by solid masonry. In the middle of the gorge, the fully automatic crossing point at Kipferwald was set up in 1999. The upper end of the Kipfenschlucht is marked by the &quot;Sellibrücke&quot;, on which the Vispa is crossed for the third time. Shortly thereafter, the racks and the formation travel along the right side of the widening valley to St. Niklaus, at 1126 metres above sea level. Since Stalden, a total of 327 m in altitude have been climbed.

===St. Niklaus–Randa===

The St. Niklaus station extends along the western edge of the town, and has two platform tracks and a siding with a loading dock. The station building represents a standard type, which can also be found in similar form in Täsch. St Niklaus station is the terminus of the post bus line to the holiday resort of Grächen, which extends on a plateau along the left side of the valley, and is connected with the valley by meandering road.

Shortly after St Niklaus station, the next rack section starts. This leads up to the &quot;Blattbachtunnel&quot;, a 130-metre-long avalanche protection structure erected in 1931. The original uncovered stretch of line at this point had to be abandoned, as the railway bridge over the Blattbach had been destroyed many times by avalanches and flooding since it was first constructed. To circumvent the problem area, a tunnel vault was created in open cut form, and then covered with earth. At the same time, and by the same means, the exit of the third rack rail section could be protected from bad weather.

In connection with that tunnel, the line moves once again into the valley, and passes the balancing reservoir of a hydroelectric power station at Herbriggen. In close proximity is the crossing station Mattsand, which was built in 1956 for the construction of the power station, and has been used since 1964 for train crossings. The nearby Herbriggen station has, apart from two platform tracks, a connecting track for a substation associated with the power station. The original station building no longer exists; it was replaced in 1966 by a new structure.

The next section of line to Randa is shaped primarily by the landslide of 1991, which buried 250 metres of the then existing line and necessitated extensive new line construction. Behind Herbriggen, the line initially follows the course of the Vispa in the middle of the valley. Shortly before the alluvial fan, however, the line curves sharply to the left and runs together with the valley road at the extreme edge of the valley floor, in order to avoid the area of land threatened by possible further landslides. South of the alluvial fan, the formation descends at a gradient of 120% and returns to the original route along the Vispa. The entire bypass section is equipped with racks. Since 1991, this has also been the only location where a rack is required for trains heading towards Zermatt.

===Randa–Zermatt===

At Randa, the railway line runs along the western edge of the town. The station has two platform tracks and a goods track. The station building dates from the line&#x27;s opening in 1891, and to this day has been rebuilt only slightly. South of Randa, the line passes the hamlet &quot;Wildi&quot;, where from 1960 to 1966 there was a loading track for the construction of the Grande Dixence power station. The line then meets up with the Mattervispa once again, and runs further on the route to Täsch directly parallel with the river along the valley floor.

The station at Täsch has been particularly important since the 1970s, as the end point of the part of the valley road available for use by motor vehicles. Originally a simple two track crossing station, the Täsch station site was expanded in 1975 by the addition of a separate platform track for shuttle trains to Zermatt. At the same time, the 1891 station building received a modern extension housing a ticket office, while the fields surrounding the station were transformed into parking spaces.

Beginning in 2005, the whole Täsch station complex was later comprehensively reconstructed. Under the name &quot;Matterhorn Terminal Täsch&quot;, there arose a three-storey parking garage with 2,000 parking spaces, and a ticket counter. Meanwhile, the original station building and the shuttle train platform were demolished. The new station facility consists of two tracks for through traffic, and a two track platform area for the shuttle trains. To the east, there is now also an attached covered parking place for coaches.
Behind Täsch the railway line initially continues to follow the course of the Mattervispa. Immediately prior to the &quot;Täschsandbrücke&quot;, newly erected in concrete in 1964, and over which the line switches for the last time to the right side of the valley, is the Täschsand crossing point, which was introduced in the summer of 2007 to increase the line&#x27;s capacity. At that point, the fifth and last rack section begins, and starts to address the final few metres to be climbed to Zermatt. While the river increasingly disappears into a gorge, the railway line runs along the right valley slope. Between Täsch and Zermatt, most of the line is protected by avalanche galleries: of 5,612 metres of track, 2,221 metres are covered by structures or tunnel roofs.

At about the halfway point between Täsch and Zermatt, there is the &quot;Kalter Boden&quot; crossing point, opened in 1972 simultaneously with the introduction of shuttle services. Here the last rack section ends. Due to the heavy usage of this section of the line, almost all trains must wait there, to cross with a train operating in the opposite direction.

After about two kilometres, the track finally reaches the northern border of Zermatt. Here there is a loading track for concrete and other building materials, devoted to the supply of Zermatt&#x27;s builders. The nearby short &quot;Spissfluhtunnel&quot; passes below the Air Zermatt heliport, and shortly after, the line reaches Zermatt station.

====Zermatt railway station====


The appearance of Zermatt railway station is characterised by 1980s era alterations. To protect passengers and rolling stock from avalanches, a massive concrete canopy was erected by 1989, and the canopy spans a total of six tracks. Track 1, which is located on the western side of the station, is equipped with an inspection pit, and is not open to the public. Here, the main task is the maintenance of the shuttle trains to and from Täsch. Track 2 has been set up for the shuttle traffic to Täsch, and is used according to the Spanish solution, with both sides equipped with platforms to allow a rapid exchange of passengers. Tracks 3 to 5 serve the regular traffic to Brig, and each has its own platform. Track 6 serves mainly cargo traffic, and ends at the baggage hall of the station building. It is shorter than the other tracks, but is also provided with a common platform with track 6.

The present day station building was erected at the start of the 1990s, in the regional timber built style. In its proportions, it resembles the former station building from 1891, and is divided into three areas. The southern part includes, amongst other things, the station restaurant, while in the central part of the building can be found the ticket office and baggage claim. The north side is located next to the baggage hall, which is a concrete structure. The Gornergratbahn station is on the opposite side of the road. It is connected to the MGB station by rail link, over which goods traffic and rolling stock transfers are handled.

North of the MGB station is an extensive layout of tracks, which are utilised primarily for goods traffic and the storage of vehicles. Since soon after the 1966 avalanche, the station throat has been covered by a massive avalanche gallery. This so-called &quot;Schafgrabengalerie&quot; (sheep&#x27;s grave gallery) is laid out with two tracks, and also allows avalanche-safe storage of vehicles. To the east of this gallery are open sidings, which can be used only to a limited extent in winter due to the risk of avalanches.

==Timetable==
The timetable for 2007 provided 15 train pairs daily between Brig and Zermatt. Apart from the trains in the early morning and late evening, a service at hourly intervals was offered, and trains stopped at all stations. 
In the 2009 timetable, services were operated at times at half-hourly intervals, occasionally only on winter Saturdays.
The total travelling time from Brig to Zermatt is 79 minutes, in the opposite direction 81 minutes. During the high season from May to October, in addition to the normal train offerings, four Glacier Express trains were operated in each direction. These stopped only in Zermatt, Visp, Brig, and in some cases also in St. Niklaus.

Additional shuttle trains operated between Täsch and Zermatt from 5:50 hours to 2:20 hours at 20-minute intervals.

==Goods traffic==

Unusually for a narrow gauge railway, the BVZ still has very intensive goods traffic. However, this is exclusively for the supply of Zermatt, which, now as before, can be served by trucks only to a limited extent.

As the remaining municipalities in the Mattertal can be supplied by trucks using the valley road, rail transport of goods generally plays no role for them. The only exception is the transport of so-called &quot;Embder Steinplatten&quot;, which are used in the region as traditional material for roofing. These stone slabs are moved by goods cable cars from the stone quarries at Embd to two loading tracks in the Kipfenschlucht, from where they are transported further by train to Visp.

The most important goods transported to Zermatt are foodstuffs, building materials and heating oil. Some other consumer goods are similarly transported by rail, and also tourist baggage. Transhipment facilities are provided at Visp station, where containers from trucks and standard gauge goods wagons are loaded onto narrow gauge wagons. To the east of Visp, there are facilities for filling tank wagons. At Zermatt, the station has been equipped since 1983 with partially underground facilities for transshipment of oil products.

The majority of the goods volume to Zermatt is transported in standard containers, for which bogie and four wheel carrying wagons are available. Freight not transported in containers is loaded at Visp into sliding wall box cars, and later delivered to recipients in Zermatt by electric road vehicles. For non moisture sensitive goods, many open wagons of various types can be used. Oil transport is undertaken in tank cars with either four wheels or bogies. Classic covered wagons play no role in normal traffic any more. During the high season, up to three purely goods trains operate daily in each direction, and goods wagons are also attached to some passenger trains.

Some of the goods wagons are suitable for use on the Gornergratbahn. By means of special railcars of type Bhe 4/4, goods can also be transported all the way to the Gornergrat without being transhipped at Zermatt.

==Rolling stock==

=== Locomotives and railcars ===

The VZ was initially operated by four steam locomotives of type HG 2/3, which entered traffic in 1890. Between 1893 and 1908, four more locomotives were added to the fleet. With the electrification of the line in 1929, the five oldest steam locos could be withdrawn from service, while the other three were initially retained as reserves. After 1941, only Loco No 7 remained on the books, as a reserve that could be operated independently of the electric wires. Today, this loco serves as a museum locomotive.

In 1929 and 1930, a total of five eight-wheeled electric locomotives HGe 4/4 I were procured for electric operations. In 1939, a sixth locomotive was added, with a new bodywork design. These six vehicles were supplemented in 1960 and 1965 by a total of five two-car railcars of types ABDeh 6/6 and ABDeh 8/8. In 1975 and 1976, four heavy baggage railcars of type Deh 4/4 arrived in the Mattertal.

The commissioning in 1990 of five modern electric locomotives of type HGe 4/4 II allowed the gradual phasing out of the aged HGe 4/4 I locomotives. Only locos no 15 and 16 remain as museum vehicles and reserves. Further modernisation has taken place since 2003, with the purchase of low floored articulated railcars manufactured by Stadler. From the time of their delivery in either 2003 or 2005, the first four BDSeh 4/8 railcars operated shuttle trains between Täsch and Zermatt. Five further examples of the ABDeh 4/8 and ABDeh 4/10 classes were to have entered traffic by 2008.

===Passenger cars===

Right from the beginning, the Visp-Zermatt-Bahn procured only eight wheeled bogie passenger cars of all three classes, manufactured by the Schweizerische Industrie-Gesellschaft (SIG). Modernisation began even before World War I, with the construction of new car bodies. In 1931, the VZ purchased its first two-passenger cars with enclosed platforms, for use in the Glacier Express.

After World War II, a comprehensive modernisation process began. A total of 26 centre entrance cars of light alloy construction were placed into service between 1955 and 1963. They represented a shortened variant of a type originally used on the Brünigbahn. In 1990, they were supplemented with some of the original length type, purchased second hand from the Brünigbahn.

Between 1968 and 1975, a further increase in capacity resulted from the purchase of so-called Einheitswagen. Once again, the BVZ chose a car type previously used by the Brünigbahn. By combining these cars with the four baggage railcars acquired between 1975 and 1976, and their matching driving cars, the BVZ could offer shuttle trains for the first time.

The latest innovation is the panorama cars acquired in 1993 in conjunction with the Furka-Oberalp-Bahn, and used mainly in the Glacier-Express. After the merger of the two companies into the Matterhorn-Gotthard-Bahn, the concept was further developed. For the 2006 season, in co-operation with the Rhätische Bahn, a total of 24 additional panorama cars of a new design were purchased.

===Liveries===
The steam locomotives were originally painted black. Since the end of the 1980s, the museum locomotive HG 2/3 No. 7 has carried a green-black colour scheme. Passenger cars, electric locomotives and railcars were painted at first in one colour, a dark tone of red that gradually lightened over time. From 1982 onwards there was, additionally, a small silver stripe running the length of these vehicles below the window line.

In the Jubilee year 1991, the company bestowed upon itself a new logo that was gradually affixed, to the coaches within about five years, but to the HGe 4/4&quot; only in 1999/2000. After the transition to the Matterhorn Gotthard Bahn, the side walls of the passenger cars and passenger railcars were covered with white. The locomotives and baggage railcars have since been painted a uniform red colour. During repaints of vehicles, the same colour scheme has been used, apart from the slightly lighter MGB red.

There is no uniform colour scheme for the goods wagons. Wooden parts of vehicles are usually painted dark brown, while components made of stainless light alloys usually remain unpainted. Tank wagons receive a dark green paint job on the tanks. The smooth sidewalls of modern boxcars are often used for advertising slogans.

<text>Story Time is a satirical young adult novel by Edward Bloor about the state of education in the United States, published in 2001.

==Plot summary==

When the school district of Whittaker Magnet School expands to cover Kate and George&#x27;s duplex, they are forced to go to the frightening school, which is suspected to house a demon. But when the First Lady comes to visit the school, the vengeful demon causes more deaths and accidents. It&#x27;s up to Kate and George to stop them. The cast of characters includes the spoiled Swiss milkmaid incarnation Heidi, her doting mother Cornelia, her brother Whit, Kate&#x27;s not-so-secret unwanted admirer, who touches Kate inappropriately, and Pogo, a librarian who can only speak in nursery rhymes.

==Reviews==
Carlie Webber of Teenreads.com gave the book a positive review, saying that &quot;Fans of Edward Bloor&#x27;s quirky settings, self-sufficient characters and strange-but-nearly-possible conspiracies will find this story enjoyable and thought provoking.&quot;

<doc id="1188899" wikidata="Q6288450" url="?curid=1188899" title="Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin">
<text>Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin (; August 31, 1842 – March 13, 1924) was a publisher, journalist, civil rights leader, suffragist, abolitionist, and editor of the &quot;Woman&#x27;s Era&quot;, the first national newspaper published by and for African American women.

==Early years and education==
Ruffin was born in Boston, Massachusetts, to John St. Pierre, of French and African descent from Martinique, and Elizabeth Matilda Menhenick from Cornwall, England. Her father was a successful clothier and founder of a Boston Zion Church. She attended public schools in Charlestown and Salem, and a private school in New York City because of her parents&#x27; objections to the segregated schools in Boston. She completed her studies at the Bowdoin School (not to be confused with Bowdoin College), after segregation in Boston schools ended.

At 16 years old, she married George Lewis Ruffin (1834–1886), who later became the first African American graduate from Harvard Law School, the first African American elected to the Boston City Council, and the first African American municipal judge. The couple moved to Liverpool but returned to Boston soon afterwards and bought a house in the West End.

== Activism ==
Working with her husband, Ruffin became active in the abolitionist movement. During the American Civil War, they helped recruit black soldiers for the Union Army, specifically the 54th and 55th Massachusetts regiments. They also worked for the Sanitation Commission, which provided aid for the care of soldiers in the field. After the war ended, Ruffin turned her attention to organizing for the Kansas Freedmen&#x27;s Relief Association, collecting money and clothes to send to aid southern blacks resettling in Kansas, known as Exodusters.

Ruffin supported women&#x27;s suffrage and, in 1869, joined with Julia Ward Howe and Lucy Stone to form the American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA) in Boston. A group of these women, Howe and Stone also founded the New England Women&#x27;s Club in 1868. Josephine Ruffin became its first black member when she joined in the mid-1890s.

Ruffin founded the first black woman&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;The Woman&#x27;s Era&quot;. She also wrote for the black weekly paper, &quot;The Courant&quot;, and became a member of the New England Woman&#x27;s Press Association.

In 1910, Ruffin helped form the Boston chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). She also wrote a special suffrage edition of &quot;The Crisis&quot; in 1915.

=== &quot;The Woman&#x27;s Era&quot; ===
 When her husband George died at the age of 52 in 1886, Ruffin used her financial security and organizational abilities to start the &quot;Woman&#x27;s Era&quot;, the country&#x27;s first newspaper published by and for African American women. She served as the editor and publisher from 1890 to 1897. While promoting interracial activities, the &quot;Woman&#x27;s Era&quot; called on black women to demand increased rights for people of their race.

=== Club work ===
In 1891, Ruffin served as the first president of Boston&#x27;s Co-Worker&#x27;s Club. In 1894, Ruffin organized the Woman&#x27;s Era Club, an advocacy group for black women, with the help of her daughter Florida Ridley and Maria Baldwin, a Boston school principal.

In 1895, Ruffin organized the National Federation of Afro-American Women with Julia O. Henson. She convened the First National Conference of the Colored Women of America in Boston, which was attended by women from 42 black women&#x27;s clubs from 14 states. The following year, the organization merged with the Colored Women&#x27;s League to form the National Association of Colored Women&#x27;s Clubs (NACWC). Mary Church Terrell was elected president and Ruffin served as one of the organization&#x27;s vice-presidents.

Just as the NACWC was forming, Ruffin was integrating the New England Woman&#x27;s Club. When the General Federation of Women&#x27;s Clubs met in Milwaukee in 1900, she planned to attend as a representative of three organizations: the Woman&#x27;s Era Club, the New England Woman&#x27;s Club and the New England Woman&#x27;s Press Club. Southern women were in positions of power in the General Federation and, when the executive committee discovered that all of the New Era&#x27;s club members were black, they would not accept Ruffin&#x27;s credentials. Ruffin was told that she could be seated as a representative of the two white clubs but not the black one. She refused on principle and was excluded from the proceedings. These events became known as &quot;The Ruffin Incident&quot; and were widely covered in newspapers around the country, most of whom supported Ruffin. Afterwards, the Woman&#x27;s Era Club made an official statement &quot;that colored women should confine themselves to their clubs and the large field of work open to them there.&quot;

The New Era Club was disbanded in 1903, but Ruffin remained active in the struggle for equal rights. Along with other women who had belonged to the New Era Club, she co-founded the League of Women for Community Service, which still exists today.

Ruffin and her husband had five children: Hubert, an attorney; Florida Ridley, a school principal and co-founder of &quot;Woman&#x27;s Era&quot;; Stanley, an inventor; George, a musician; and Robert, who died before his first birthday.

She died of nephritis at her home on St. Botolph Street, Boston, in 1924, and was buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery, Cambridge.

==Legacy==

In 1995, Ruffin was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

In 1999 a series of six tall marble panels with a bronze bust in each was added to the Massachusetts State House; the busts are of Ruffin, Florence Luscomb, Mary Kenney O&#x27;Sullivan, Dorothea Dix, Sarah Parker Remond, and Lucy Stone. Two quotations from each of those women (including Ruffin) are etched on their own marble panel, and the wall behind all the panels has wallpaper made of six government documents repeated over and over, with each document being related to a cause of one or more of the women.

Her home on Charles Street is a site on the Boston Women&#x27;s Heritage Trail.

<doc id="1188933" wikidata="Q7697663" url="?curid=1188933" title="Telluride Association">
<text>The Telluride Association is a non-profit organization in the United States founded in 1910 by Lucien Lucius Nunn and named for his hometown, Telluride, Colorado. The organization states its mission as providing young people with free educational programs emphasizing intellectual curiosity, democratic self-governance, and social responsibility.

The Association&#x27;s principal programs are summer seminars for high school students and the operation of scholarship &quot;branches&quot; for college students. These residential programs are extremely selective and are offered at no cost to the students. The Association is governed largely by those elected to membership from its recent alumni, Deep Springs College alumni, and current Branch students.

==History==
Lucien Lucius Nunn founded this association in 1910 after building the first Telluride House at Cornell University. The first President of the Telluride Association was Charles Doolittle Walcott, a paleontologist and fourth Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. The house originally provided room and board for young men who had worked for Nunn and were studying engineering at Cornell. It has since expanded to encompass a variety of co-educational summer programs, scholarships, and additional houses. The Association is non-denominational and tied to no particular political viewpoint.

===Telluride Houses===

 Telluride Houses, or Branches, have operated at Cornell University since 1910 and at the University of Michigan since 1999. Students participate in a year-round public speaking program and plan academic seminars. The houses are largely self-governed, with somewhat different focuses: residents of Cornell Branch take on such responsibilities as hiring employees and maintaining and renovating the house, while residents of Michigan Branch plan and execute an annual project linking practical work in the community with theoretical and academic inquiry. Distinguished alumni include Steven Weinberg, Barber Conable, Eve Sedgwick, Francis Fukuyama, Paul Wolfowitz, Jan Švejnar, Dominick LaCapra, William vanden Heuvel, William T. Vollman and Gayatri Spivak. Faculty guests also live at the houses for limited terms. Distinguished faculty guests have included Michel Foucault, Richard Feynman, Frances Perkins, Linus Pauling, and Allan Bloom.

Telluride Houses formerly existed in Pasadena, California, the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Chicago.

===Summer Programs===

The Association previously offered two summer programs: Telluride Association Summer Programs (TASPs) and Telluride Association Sophomore Seminars (TASSes). Both were six-week, free educational experiences for rising high school seniors and juniors, respectively, hosted at Cornell University, the University of Michigan, Indiana University and the University of Maryland at College Park. Participants attended an intensive seminar led by college and university faculty members and participated in educational and social activities outside the classroom. Like the houses, each seminar received a discretionary budget, whose use is democratically distributed via weekly house meetings. TASPs focused on a variety of interdisciplinary themes, while TASSes focused on African American studies and related fields.

In 2022, the Telluride Association restructured the TASP and TASS programs, changing them to two new ones: the Telluride Association Summer Seminar in Critical Black Studies (TASS-CBS) and the Telluride Association Summer Seminar in Anti-Oppressive Studies (TASS-AOS).

==Awards==

Telluride Association Awards are awarded to members of the Telluride community by the Association.

The Mansfield-Wefald Senior Thesis Prize is awarded annually for the best scholarly thesis written by a Telluride associate who will have completed his or her final year of undergraduate education that year.

The Mike Yarrow Adventurous Education Award is given annually to a returning member of a Branch of Telluride Association, or a Deep Springs student who will be entering a Branch the following year. The award funds non-paying public service activity during the summer that is outside of an academic institution.

The Nunn Archive Fellowship is awarded to help associates study and preserve the legacy of Lucien Lucius Nunn.

Beginning in the late 1950s, the Telluride House at Cornell operated a two-year postgraduate exchange scholarship program with Lincoln College of Oxford University, welcoming a Sedgwick Scholar to stay at Telluride House and to study at Cornell, usually for a master&#x27;s degree, and sending a Housemember to study for an Oxford M.Phil. while resident at Lincoln College. Despite efforts of both sides, the program was ended in 2002.

The Reese Miller Exchange Scholarship is available to students at Cornell University, University of Michigan, Central European University in Budapest, Hungary, and the University of Cape Town, South Africa. The scholarship operates as an exchange for one semester or one year between recent undergraduates and graduate students at Cornell and CEU and between students at University of Michigan and UCT.

The Atkinson-Tetreault Fellowship is available to Masters in Regional Planning students at Cornell University. The award is offered once every two years and includes room and board at the Telluride House, a stipend, and a partial tuition award.

==Membership==
Telluride Association consists of about 100 volunteer members who serve as the Association&#x27;s trustees. Members are elected to membership, usually while in their twenties, on the basis of demonstrated leadership and commitment to Telluride&#x27;s educational goals. The Association&#x27;s membership is mainly current and former participants of its programs and alumni of Deep Springs College, a separate two-year college founded by Nunn in 1917.

<text>Reginald Allan Patterson (July 12, 1919 in Ottawa, Ontario - July 23, 2009 in Winnipeg, Manitoba) was a politician in the Canadian province of Manitoba. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1988 to 1990, representing the northeast Winnipeg riding of Radisson for the Manitoba Liberal Party.

The son of Harold Allan Patterson and Emma Lucille Denny, he was educated in Capreol, in Barrie, at the Ontario Agricultural College, the University of Western Ontario and the University of Minnesota. He was a lecturer at the University of Western Ontario&#x27;s School of Business Administration from 1967 to 1969, and a professor in the Faculty of Management at the University of Manitoba from 1974 to 1988. Before teaching, Patterson was employed with the Dominion Rubber Company Limited Tire Division in Kitchener and Winnipeg and the T. Eaton Co. Limited in Winnipeg. He was also a National Executive Member of the Canadian Industrial Relations Association, and served as the Manitoba Liberal Party&#x27;s Chief Financial Officer.

Patterson married Edith Charlotte Freed.

Patterson first ran for the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1986, finishing third in Radisson with 1,239 votes (incumbent New Democrat Gerard Lecuyer was re-elected with 4,810 votes). Two years later, in the provincial election of 1988, Patterson defeated Lecuyer by 1,805 votes. This was a period of increased support for the Liberals, who increased their parliamentary representation from one to twenty in the 1988 election.

This rise in Liberal support proved to be transient, and Patterson was defeated in the provincial election of 1990, finishing in third place with 1,925 votes. New Democrat Marianne Cerilli recaptured the riding for her party with 4,055 votes. Patterson did not seek a return to political life after this time.

Patterson later served as a board member on the Winnipeg Public Library.

He died in the St. Boniface Hospital at the age of 90.

<doc id="1188952" wikidata="Q225114" url="?curid=1188952" title="Furka Oberalp Railway">
<text>The Furka Oberalp Railway () is a narrow gauge mountain railway in Switzerland with a gauge of . It runs in the Graubünden, Uri and Canton of Valais. Since January 1, 2003, it is part of the Matterhorn Gotthard Bahn when it merged with the BVZ Zermatt-Bahn.

The line begins in Disentis in the canton of Graubünden, where there is a connection to the Rhätische Bahn (RhB). It then runs over the Oberalp Pass to Andermatt in the canton of Uri. Through the Furka Base Tunnel it reaches the Goms District area and Brig in the canton of Valais. In Brig, it connects to the BVZ Zermattbahn since 1930.

The first half of the line was opened by the French company &quot;Brig-Furka-Disentis Bahn&quot; (BFD) in 1914. Trains could go as far as Gletsch, starting from Brig. Construction of the second part over the Furka Pass and Oberalp Pass was well under way when the war situation in France halted all works by 1915. The company lingered on, but was finally bankrupt in 1923. Two years later the railway had a new owner, called &quot;Furka Oberalp Bahn&quot;, founded by the cantons and the neighbouring railway companies. Construction work resumed, now with important federal funds, and on July 4, 1926 regular through services between Brig and Disentis could start. RhB trains reached Disentis under electric traction in 1922.

In 1930 the tracks of the newly electrified BVZ reached Brig, which gave birth to the famous Glacier Express. The oncoming crisis and the war limited the number of tourists. Nevertheless the FO line was considered to be of strategic importance. This finally made funds available to electrify the line and purchase the necessary motive power. At the same time the Andermatt–Disentis line was protected against avalanches to allow winter services.

==Schöllenenbahn==

The Schöllenenbahn (SchB) was opened in 1917 from Göschenen up to Andermatt. It has a station connecting with the Gotthard railway line of the Swiss Federal Railways. Initially it was electrified with 1,200 V DC. In 1941, when electrification of FO started, SchB was converted to 11,000 V AC. In 1961, it merged with the Furka Oberalp Bahn.

==Furka Bergstrecke==
There are many avalanches between Realp and Oberwald. The section over the Furka Pass used to be closed during winters. The mountain section was closed in the winter of 1981 and was replaced by a tunnel (length: ) in 1982. The association called &quot;Verein Furka-Bergstrecke&quot; and the company Dampfbahn Furka-Bergstrecke now run a heritage railway with steam locomotives on the old route.

== Rolling stock ==
When FO was founded in 1925, it came in possession of the BFD rolling stock, introduced in 1914 and consisting of
* 10 steam locomotives HG 3/4 1–10, built by SLM
* 40 wooden coaches, of which 30 with bogies, including 10 luggage and mail vans, all built by SIG, Neuhausen
* 30 goods wagons, including 10 covered wagons, 10 open wagons and 10 flat cars, all built by Chantiers de la Buire at Lyon, France
* 17 goods wagons, purchased from RhB for the construction work on the line, originally built in 1888/89 by SIG and S.A. Nicaise &amp; Delcuve, La Louvière, Belgium
For a long time, FO couldn&#x27;t afford to buy new coaches and wagons and rebuilt many of these vehicles. Some of the large luggage and mail vans were rebuilt as passenger coaches, some became covered goods wagons. Two axle coaches got luggage compartments to provide for a well adapted transport capacity. When some coaches got new bogies from SWS, Schlieren in 1947, the old bogies were reused to build 4 covered wagons. During the Second World War, three flat wagons had been built using underframes from coaches. 1949 these coaches came back to service with new underframes and bogies from SIG. FO always suffered from not having really enough vehicles but was lucky having two neighbouring companies where additional rolling stock could be leased for peak traffic.

Electrification during the Second World War necessarily brought new rolling stock. SLM delivered together with
* MFO 5 locomotives HGe 4/4 31–35 and
* BBC 4 motor coaches BCFeh 2/4 42–43 and CFeh 2/4 44–45; number 41 had been delivered to Schöllenenbahn
* MFO and SIG 3 electric rotary snow ploughs Xrot e 1021–23 (later 4931–33)
Six of the steam locomotives were after the War sold to France (two) and Vietnam (four) while four locomotives remained. In 1946 a small electric shunter Te 2/2 1041 (later 4926) was built by SLM and SAAS for Brig station. Later, two more locomotives were delivered by SLM and MFO
* HGe 4/4 36 1948
* HGe 4/4 37 1956

The 1961 merger with Schöllenenbahn enlarged stock by
* 4 two-axle electric locomotives HGe 2/2 21–24
* 1 motor coach 41 (see above)
* 7 wooden coaches with bogies, all built in 1917 by SWS, Schlieren
* 6 goods wagons from 1917 (SWS)
* 5 goods wagons from 1943/44 (SWS)

Finally, after the merger, FO could begin with the modernisation of its rolling stock and took delivery of
* 3 luggage vans F4 (later D) 4341–43 by FFA/SIG 1961 which also served for a military rescue train
* 12 covered goods wagons K3s (later Gb-v) 4433–4444 by J. Meyer, Rheinfelden, 1964
* 10 cement silo wagons OB1 (later Uce) 4861–70 by J. Meyer, Rheinfelden, 1964/65
* 10 FFA1-type second class coaches B 4263–72 1965/68
* 2 flat cars O7s (later R-w) 4791–92 by J. Meyer, Rheinfelden, 1967
* 2 diesel locomotives HGm 4/4 61–62 to finally replace the last steam locomotives, delivered 1968 by SLM, BBC and MFO with Cummins diesels.

1971/72 FO took delivery of 4 push-pull consists with motor luggage vans, one additional motor to compensate for the loss of locomotive 35, destroyed in a head-on collision, and four additional driving trailers to form small push-pull consists with the existing motor coaches 41–45. The coaches were of SIG1-type, also introduced on BVZ, SBB-Brünigbahn, BOB and MOB.
* motor luggage van Deh 4/4 51–55, built by SIG and BBC
* second-class coaches B 4251–58
* composite driving trailers ABt 4151–54
* composite driving trailers ABt 4191–94

All this rolling stock was, for motive power and coaches, all red with a simple FO inscription. With the opening of the new Furka tunnel approaching, the wooden coaches had to be replaced and the number of vehicles extended. The number of push-pull consists was extended to 9 long and 5 short ones. The coaches were of SIG2 type, also delivered to MOB. But now, the all-red-status should be left. A new livery in red with a white stripe was introduced and within a few years extended to existing modern rolling stock.
* 4 motor luggage vans Deh 4/4 91–94 built by SLM and BBC
* 16 second-class coaches B 4273–88
* 5 composite driving trailers ABt 4155–59
* 1 composite driving trailer ABt 4195
* 4 first-class coaches A 4063–66
For the Furka tunnel car shuttle trains, FO took delivery of
* 2 electric adhesion locomotives Ge 4/4 81–82
* 2 driving trailers with passenger and cycle compartment BDt 4361–62
* 5 end wagons Skl-tv 4801–05
* 12 car transporters with roof Skl-tv 4811–22

A little addition could be made some years later, but the coaches now came from ACMV Vevey
* 2 motor luggage vans Deh 4/4 95–96, delivered 1984 by SLM and BBC
* 7 car transporters Skl-tv 4806–07 and 4823–27, delivered 1984
* 1 car shuttle driving trailer BDt 4363, delivered 1985
* 2 composite coaches AB 4171–72, delivered 1987
* 2 composite driving trailers ABt 4181–82, delivered 1987

Finally FO got panoramic coaches as developed by MOB
* 4 Ramseier+Jenzer coaches on preused underframes PS 4011–14
* 10 Breda-built As 4021–30 on SIG bogies

There was no departmental stock for a long time except for one snow plough, introduced 1917. 1943 and 55 some tram wagons were bought and added to service stock. With modern stock arriving, many coaches and wagons were reused in departmental stock.

<doc id="1188966" wikidata="Q118875309" url="?curid=1188966" title="Overlinking">
<text>Overlinking in a webpage or other hyperlinked text is having too many hyperlinks (links).

It is characterized by:

* A large proportion of the words in each sentence are rendered as links.
* Links that have little information content, such as linking on specific years like 1995, or unnecessary linking of common words used in the common way, for which the reader can be expected to understand the word&#x27;s full meaning in , without any hyperlink help.
* A Hyperlink for any single term is excessively repeated in the same article. &quot;Excessive&quot; is usually more than one link for the same term in a line or a paragraph, since in this case, one or more duplicate hyperlinks will almost certainly then appear needlessly on the viewer&#x27;s screen. The purpose of links is to direct the reader to a new spot at the point(s) where the reader is most likely to take a temporary detour due to needing more information. Providing more hyperlink samples for the same word in a short space (as in the example of this paragraph) doesn&#x27;t help much.

== Related concepts ==
The opposites of overlinking are &quot;null linking&quot; and &quot;underlinking&quot;, which are phenomena in which hyperlinks are reduced to such a degree as to remove all pointers to a likely-needed context of an unusual term, in the text-area where the term occurs. This results in reader frustration. Underlinking results whenever a reader encounters an odd term in an article (perhaps not even for the first time) and wants to briefly browse more deeply at that point, but finds they cannot, but rather is required to conduct an extensive search far up near the beginning of the article, in order to locate the only instance of the word or term being linked— or perhaps even to find that it hasn&#x27;t been linked at all.

<text>Gordon Bulloch (born 26 March 1975) is a former Scotland international rugby union player.

==Rugby Union career==

===Amateur career===

He made his debut for West of Scotland in November 1995 against a touring side, South African provincial team Griqualand West. He went on to captain West of Scotland from 1996 to 1997 and took West to promotion to the Scottish Premiership.

===Professional career===

The game turned professional in 1996 and he played for and captained Glasgow Rugby district team – now Glasgow Warriors. He is Glasgow Warrior No. 2 after his professional debut against Newbridge on 12 October 1996. He captained Glasgow through to 1999. In November he led the team to the quarter final play-off in the 1997–98 European Cup. In May 2002, he signed a further three-year contract with Glasgow. In December he made his 100th senior appearance for Glasgow.

Bulloch signed for Leeds Tykes in May 2005. He had joined on a two-year contract, although the following year Leeds Tykes were relegated from the Guinness Premiership in England and subsequently freed several players including Bulloch.

===International career===

He played for Scotland at U19 and U21 level and has been in four tours in South Africa. In 1996, he was an important player in helping the Scots to fourth place in the 1996 Students&#x27; World Cup.

In 1997, he was part of the squad for the Scotland XV tour and played in the three victories on the tour. He won his first A cap in 1997 for Scotland&#x27;s victory over Emerging Wales, and went on to play against all of Scotland&#x27;s Five Nations opponents at that level.

In December 1997 Bulloch made his full Scotland debut in an Autumn international against South Africa at the Murrayfield Stadium. Bulloch went on the 1998 tour of Oceania but in the first five minute of Scotland&#x27;s first test against Australia he left the field with a dislocated shoulder. In 1999 his performances in Scotland&#x27;s Five Nations success saw him force his way into the World XV. He played in the 1999 Rugby World Cup.

In June 2001 he was called into the British &amp; Irish Lions squad to cover for an injury to Phil Greening on the tour of Australia. He made five appearances, including a replacement appearance in the first Test in Brisbane. His only start came against New South Wales County when the Lions won 46–3.

In November 2002, he was named man of the match for his outstanding performance in Scotland&#x27;s win over South Africa at Murrayfield. He was included in the Zurich World XV for 2002, a notional team list that was compiled based on ratings from detailed video analysis of performances during the past year. In August 2003 he played against Wales and in gaining his 53rd cap he became Scotland&#x27;s most-capped hooker. He was named captain for the following match against the Irish.

He played in the 2003 Rugby World Cup.

In 2005, Bulloch captained Scotland in the Six Nations

He was selected for the 2005 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to New Zealand and was picked as captain for the fifth tour match. He captained three of the Lions mid week games. He made his Test debut in the final Test game of the tour – becoming the only Scot to do so on the tour. Bulloch required stitches after an injury was sustained in a training ground incident involving himself and John Hayes. He retired from international rugby union shortly after his return from Lions duty.

In June 2014 he lost the accolade of Scotland&#x27;s most capped hooker to Ross Ford.

===Administrative career===

In August 2008 he was appointed a non-executive director on the board of Scottish Rugby.

==Business career==

Bulloch moved back to Scotland and took up employment with Colliers CRE, and returned to play rugby with then third-division West of Scotland.

Bulloch now works for Highland Galvanisers in Elgin, as a technical consultant.

<text>Waves Audio Ltd. is an Israeli developer and supplier of professional digital audio signal processing technologies and audio effects, used in recording, mixing, mastering, post production, broadcast, and live sound. The company&#x27;s corporate headquarters and main development facilities are located in Tel Aviv, with additional offices in the United States, China, and Taiwan, and development centers in India and Ukraine. In 2011, Waves won a Technical Grammy Award.

==History==
Waves Audio was founded in October 1992 by Gilad Keren and Meir Sha&#x27;ashua in Tel Aviv, Israel.

Later that year, Waves released its first product, the Q10 Paragraphic Equalizer. The Q10 was the audio industry&#x27;s first commercially available audio plugin.

Waves&#x27; L1 Ultramaximizer, released in 1994, became a prominent plugin, with some publications pointing to it as contributing to the &quot;loudness war&quot; behind modern music mastering. Record producer Tony Maserati said of early Waves software, &quot;[they] were the only plugins [that were] quality and they were creative.&quot; Waves later launched a signature line of Maserati inspired plugins.

Waves launched the Waves Signature Series working with music producers and engineers to explore their unique sounds. In 2009, as part of the Signature Series, Waves released the Eddie Kramer Signature Series of five plug-ins focusing on classic rock. The Chris Lord-Alge Signature Series followed in 2010. The Waves Signature Series continued in 2013 with the Manny Marroquin Signature Series. In 2015, Waves worked with music producer Butch Vig to release the Butch Vig Vocals plug-in as part of the Waves Signature Series.

In 2011, the company was honored with a Technical Grammy Award for &quot;contributions of outstanding technical significance to the recording field.&quot;

In 2018, Waves released the Abbey Road TG Mastering Chain as part of their Abbey Road collection. The chain is modeled after the EMI TG12345 consoles used in the Abbey Road Studios mastering suites.

On March 26, 2023, in a controversial move, Waves introduced their subscription service, Waves Creative Access, while removing the Waves Update Plan as well as the sale of perpetual licenses. They re-introduced Waves Update Plan three days later, as well as perpetual licenses.

==Products==
Waves Audio sells over 200 software products dedicated to music production, engineering, mixing, and mastering, in addition to a variety of virtual instruments and effects. Notable software includes:

Waves has launched plug-ins in collaboration with Abbey Road Studios, such as the King&#x27;s Microphones plug-in released in 2011, the REDD Console plug-ins released in 2012, the J37 tape saturation plug-in, the Abbey Road Reverb Plates plugin, the RS56 Passive EQ plug-in released in 2013, and the EMI TG12345 plug-in released in 2014. Other software includes the Torque drum tone shifter plug-in.

==Technology==

In 2010, Waves announced the release of its SoundGrid technology at the Winter NAMM show. SoundGrid was created to make Waves audio processors available on a low-latency platform. The SoundGrid system consists of a Linux-based server that runs the SoundGrid environment, compatible plug-ins, a Mac or Windows control computer, and a digital-analog interface for input/output (I/O). It is used for live sound, broadcast, and post production—s a low latency environment for audio processing on certain hardware audio mixing consoles, e.g., DiGiCo, Allen &amp; Heath, and Yamaha.

Under its Maxx brand, Waves offers its technologies as licensable algorithms for consumer electronics. Technologies from the Maxx brand have been used in products including computers, laptops, smartphones, VoIP and portable loudspeaker systems from companies such as Dell, Toshiba, Sony, Oppo, OnePlus, Sanyo, JVC, and Altec Lansing.

Waves launched a Kickstarter campaign in 2016 to help fund the production of Waves Nx, a technology that transmits 3D audio on headphones in stereo or 5.1/7.1 surround sound. The technology generates a three-dimensional virtual audioscape that allows users to &quot;detect which direction sounds are coming from.&quot;

Along with the Waves Nx, Waves has also developed the Waves B360 Ambisonics Encoder to assist engineers mixing 360-degree and VR audio projects. Audeze Mobius headphones are operated with Waves&#x27; Nx technology.

Currently, Waves Maxx technology is available on IoT, mobile, smart assistance, and communication devices. Waves Maxx partnerships include Google, Dell, LG, Acer, Fitbit, Qualcomm, and Intel. Additionally, Waves Nx technology for 3D audio is available in gaming headphones and other devices by Acer, and Audeze. Film score mixer Alan Meyerson said of Waves&#x27; technology, &quot;[it has] changed the sound of film scores.&quot;

==Copyright and trademark lawsuits==
In 2010, Waves Audio was involved in two lawsuits regarding intellectual property infringements and illegal use of its software. In one lawsuit, with the defendant Skyline Recording Studios NYC, Waves won, and in the other, with the defendant Quad Recording Studios, the defendant admitted liability.

In 2013, Waves Audio sued Motorola Mobility for allegedly infringing on its Maxx trademark with the Droid Razr Maxx and Droid Razr Maxx HD phones.

<text>The Battle on the Marchfeld (&quot;i.e. Morava Field&quot;; ; ; ); at Dürnkrut and Jedenspeigen took place on 26 August 1278 and was a decisive event for the history of Central Europe for the following centuries. The opponents were a Bohemian (Czech) army led by the Přemyslid king Ottokar II of Bohemia and the German army under the German king Rudolph I of Habsburg in alliance with King Ladislaus IV of Hungary. With 15,300 mounted troops, it was one of the largest cavalry battles in Central Europe during the Middle Ages. The Hungarian cavalry played a significant role in the outcome of the battle.

King Ottokar II of Bohemia expanded his territories considerably from 1250 to 1273, but suffered a devastating defeat in November 1276, when the newly elected German king Rudolph I of Habsburg imposed the Imperial ban on Ottokar, declaring him an outlaw and took over Ottokar&#x27;s holdings in Austria, Carinthia, Carniola, and Styria. Ottokar was reduced to his possessions in Bohemia and Moravia, but was determined to regain his dominions, power, and influence. In 1278 he invaded Austria, where parts of the local population, especially in Vienna, resented Habsburg rule. Rudolf allied himself with King Ladislaus IV of Hungary and mustered forces for a decisive confrontation.

Ottokar abandoned his siege of Laa an der Thaya and advanced to meet the allies near Dürnkrut, north of Vienna. Both armies were composed purely of cavalry and were divided into three divisions that attacked the enemy piecemeal. In the first phase of the battle, the Cuman horse archers in the Hungarian army outflanked and distracted the Bohemian left flank by launching arrows while the Hungarian light cavalry crashed into the Bohemians, driving them from the field. In the second phase, a great collision of knights and heavy cavalry took place in the center, with Rudolf&#x27;s forces being driven back. Rudolf&#x27;s third division, led by the king personally, attacked and halted Ottokar&#x27;s charge. Rudolf was unhorsed in the melee and nearly killed. At a decisive moment, a German cavalry force of 200 riders, commanded by Ulrich von Kapellen, ambushed and attacked the Bohemian right flank from the rear. Assailed from two directions at once, Ottokar&#x27;s army disintegrated into a rout, and Ottokar himself was killed in the confusion and slaughter. The Cumans pursued and killed the fleeing Bohemians with impunity.

The battle marked the beginning of the ascendancy of the House of Habsburg in Austria and Central Europe. The influence of the Přemyslid kings of Bohemia was diminished and restricted to their inheritance in Bohemia and Moravia.

==Background==

The death of Emperor Frederick II of Hohenstaufen in 1250 and subsequently his son Conrad IV of Germany, created a grave crisis for the Holy Roman Empire, as in the following decades several nobles were elected as &quot;Rex Romanorum&quot; and Emperor-to-be, none of whom were able to gain actual governing power upon the Emperor&#x27;s death in 1250. That same year, Ottokar II, son of King Wenceslaus I of Bohemia, moved into the princeless Duchies of Austria and Styria. The last Babenberg duke Frederick II of Austria had been killed at the 1246 Battle of the Leitha River, in a border conflict he had picked with King Béla IV of Hungary. Ottokar II gained the support of the local nobility and was proclaimed Austrian and Styrian duke by the estates one year later.

In 1253, Ottokar II became Bohemian king upon the death of his father; the concentration of power on the western Hungarian border was viewed with suspicion by King Béla IV, who campaigned against Austria and Styria but was finally defeated at the 1260 Battle of Kressenbrunn. In 1268 Ottokar signed a contract of inheritance with Ulrich III, the last Carinthian duke of the House of Sponheim, and thus acquired Carinthia including the March of Carniola and the Windic March one year later. At the height of his power he aimed at the Imperial crown, but the Princes-Electors (&quot;Kurfürsten&quot;), distrustful of his steep rise, elected the &quot;poor Swabian count&quot; Rudolph of Habsburg King of the Romans on 29 September 1273.

==Prelude==
As the election had taken place in his absence, Ottokar did not acknowledge Rudolph as King. Rudolph himself had promised to regain the &quot;alienated&quot; territories which had to be conferred by the Imperial power with consent of the Prince-electors. He claimed the Austrian and Carinthian territories for the Empire and summoned Ottokar to the 1275 &quot;Reichstag&quot; at Würzburg. By not appearing before the Diet, Ottokar set the events of his demise in motion. He was placed under the Imperial ban and had all his territorial rights revoked, including even his Bohemian inheritance.
Meanwhile, Rudolph was gathering allies and preparing for battle. He achieved two of these alliances through the classic Habsburg style – marriage. First, he married his son Albert to Elisabeth of Gorizia-Tyrol. In return, her father Count Meinhard II of Gorizia-Tyrol received the Duchy of Carinthia as a fief. Second, he established an — unstable — alliance with Duke Henry I of Lower Bavaria by offering Rudolph&#x27;s daughter Katharina as wife for the Duke&#x27;s son, Otto, in addition to the region of present-day Upper Austria as a pledge for her dowry. He also concluded an alliance with King Ladislaus IV of Hungary, who intended to settle old scores with Ottokar.

Rudolph, so strengthened, besieged Ottokar at the Austrian capital Vienna in 1276. Ottokar was forced to surrender and to renounce all his acquisitions, receiving only Bohemia and Moravia as a fief from King Rudolph. Heavily deprived by this, he was determined to regain his territories and contracted an alliance with the Ascanian Margraves of Brandenburg and the Polish princes. In 1278 he campaigned against Austria, supported by Duke Henry I of Lower Bavaria, who had switched sides. Ottokar first laid siege to the towns of Drosendorf and Laa an der Thaya near the Austrian border, while Rudolph decided to leave Vienna and to face the Bohemian army in open battle in the Morava basin north of the capital, where the Cuman cavalry of King Ladislaus could easily join his forces.

==Opposing forces==
Ottakar fielded 6,000 cavalry, of which 1,000 were heavily armed and armored and 5,000 lightly equipped riders. Ottokar&#x27;s heavy cavalry rode armored horses. About one third of Ottakar’s knights were Poles from Silesia, Greater Poland and Lesser Poland. Rudolf had 300 heavy cavalry and 4,000 light cavalry, of which an indeterminate number were Hungarians. Rudolf&#x27;s force included a force of 5,000 Cuman horse archers.

==Battle==
Surprised by Rudolph&#x27;s maneuver, Ottokar quickly abandoned the siege at Laa, marched southwards, and on August 26 met the united German and Hungarian forces near Dürnkrut. When he arrived his enemies had already taken the opportunity to explore the topography of the future battleground. From the early morning, the left wing of the advancing Bohemian troops were embroiled in impetuous attacks by the Cuman forces, which the heavily armed knights could not ward off. Nevertheless, as the main armies collided and the battle wore on, Ottokar&#x27;s outnumbering cavalry seemed to gain the upper hand, when even Rudolph&#x27;s horse was stabbed under him and the 60-year-old narrowly escaped with his life, rescued by his liensmen.

After three hours of continuous fighting on a hot summer day, Ottokar&#x27;s knights in their heavy armour were suffering from heat exhaustion and were not able to move. At noon Rudolph ordered a fresh heavy cavalry regiment he had concealed behind nearby hills and woods to attack the right flank of Ottokar&#x27;s troops. Such ambushes were commonly regarded as dishonourable in medieval warfare and Rudolph&#x27;s commander Ulrich von Kapellen apologized to his own men in advance. Nevertheless, the attack prevailed in splitting and stampeding the Bohemian troops. Ottokar became aware of the surprise attack and tried to lead a remaining reserve contingent in the rear of von Kapellen&#x27;s troops, a maneuver that was misinterpreted as a rout by the Bohemian forces. The resulting collapse led to a complete victory for Rudolph and his allies. Ottokar&#x27;s camp was plundered, and he himself was found slain on the battlefield.

==Aftermath==

Rudolph, to demonstrate his victory, had Ottokar&#x27;s body displayed in Vienna. The &quot;poor count&quot; from Swabian Habsburg Castle assured his possession of the Duchies of Austria and Styria, the heartland and foundation of the rise of the House of Habsburg. At the 1282 Diet of Augsburg, he installed his sons Albert and Rudolf II as Austrian dukes; their descendants held the ducal dignity until 1918. However, in Bohemia, Rudolph acted cautiously and reached an agreement with the nobility and Ottokar&#x27;s widow Kunigunda of Slavonia on the succession of her son Wenceslaus II to the throne. On the same occasion he reconciled with the Brandenburg margraves, ceding them the guardianship over the minor heir apparent. King Ladislaus IV exerted himself in the christianization of the Cuman warriors, before he was assassinated in 1290.

Ottokar&#x27;s son, the young king Wenceslaus II of Bohemia, turned out to be a capable ruler. In 1291 he acquired the Polish Seniorate Province at Kraków and was crowned King of Poland in 1300. He was even able to secure the Hungarian crown for his son Wenceslaus III, still a minor, who nevertheless was murdered in 1306, one year after his father&#x27;s death, whereby the Přemyslid dynasty became extinct.

===Casualties===
No exact data on casualties is available, but Ottokar&#x27;s losses were considerably higher than Rudolf&#x27;s.

==In art and popular culture==

The battle was depicted in art especially during the rise of nationalism in the 19th century, when it was viewed as the example of a traditional co-operation between the Habsburg dynasty (Austria) and the Kingdom of Hungary, from one side, and the traditional tension between the Habsburg dynasty and Bohemia, from the Czech side.

The tragedy &quot;König Ottokars Glück und Ende&quot; written by Franz Grillparzer in 1823 is based on the rise and fall of king Ottokar II. The drama was originally inspired by the life of Napoleon, but Grillparzer, fearing Metternich&#x27;s censorship, chose to write the play about Ottokar, in whose story he found many parallels. It nevertheless was immediately forbidden and could not be performed until 1825. Grillparzer perpetuated the legend of Ottokar&#x27;s wife, Margaret of Babenberg, unsuccessfully trying to reconcile the opponents on the eve of the battle. In fact, Margaret had died in 1266.

The opera &quot;The Brandenburgers in Bohemia&quot;, by the Czech composer Bedřich Smetana in 1863, was inspired by the battle and the following events.

<text>Predecessor culture is a sociological phrase originating in Alasdair MacIntyre&#x27;s book, &quot;After Virtue&quot;, in which he considers society before the Enlightenment&#x27;s project of rationalizing all things as having an internal consistency and meaning which has been lost to us. It can be considered as having to do with the set of heroes and stories that were re-iterated in former cultures; these are called &quot;commonplaces&quot; in English literature. 

Another use of the phrase is to refer to society before the 1960s. Not only is this considered in opposition to the sexual revolution, and various political movements and the manner in which power is expressed, such as the ways in which society is intended to accommodate feminism, but with the philosophical changes such as structuralism and post-structuralism.

<doc id="1188982" wikidata="Q1853998" url="?curid=1188982" title="Robin Hood's Bay">
<text>Robin Hood&#x27;s Bay is a village in North Yorkshire, England. It is south of Whitby and north of Scarborough on the Yorkshire Coast.

It is an ancient chapelry of Fylingdales in the wapentake of Whitby Strand. It is on the Cleveland Way national trail and also the end point of Wainwright&#x27;s Coast to Coast route.

== History ==
=== Toponymy ===
The origin of the name is uncertain, and it is doubtful that Robin Hood was ever in the vicinity of the village (if indeed he ever existed). The place is attested in the early sixteenth century as &quot;Robyn Hoodis Baye&quot; in 1544. The English ballad &quot;The Noble Fisherman&quot; tells a story of Robin Hood visiting Scarborough, taking a job as a fisherman, defeating French pirates with his archery skills, and using half the looted treasure to build a home for the poor. However, the ballad is only attested to in the 17th century at the earliest. It is considered more likely to be a work original to the 17th century rather than an older medieval popular legend passed down, and very unlikely to be based on any historical incident. However, it is possible the author knew of Robin Hood&#x27;s Bay, and sought to tie the story he wrote to the Scarborough area to explain and justify the name.

=== Early history ===
By about 1000 the neighbouring hamlet of Raw and the village of Thorpe (Fylingthorpe) in Fylingdales had been settled by Norwegians and Danes. After the Norman conquest in 1069 much land in Northern England, including Fylingdales, was laid waste. William the Conqueror gave Fylingdales to Tancred the Fleming who later sold it to the Abbot of Whitby.

In the period 1324–1346 there was an early reference to Robin Hood&#x27;s Bay. Louis I, Count of Flanders, wrote a letter to King Edward III in which he complained that Flemish fishermen together with their boats and catches were taken by force to Robyn Oeds Bay. The settlements were about a mile inland at Raw but by about 1500 a settlement had grown up on the coast. &quot;Robin Hoode Baye&quot; was mentioned by Leland in 1536 who described it as,

After the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1540, Whitby Abbey and its lands became the property of King Henry VIII with King Street and King&#x27;s Beck dating from this time.

In the 16th century, Robin Hood&#x27;s Bay was a more important port than Whitby, it is described by a tiny picture of tall houses and an anchor on old North Sea charts published by Waghenaer in 1586 and now in Rotterdam&#x27;s Maritime Museum.

=== Smuggling ===
The village, which consists of a maze of tiny streets, has a tradition of smuggling, and there is reputed to be a network of subterranean passageways linking the houses. During the late 18th century smuggling was rife on the Yorkshire coast. Vessels from the continent brought contraband which was distributed by contacts on land and the operations were financed by syndicates who made profits without the risks taken by the seamen and the villagers. Tea, gin, rum, brandy and tobacco were among the contraband smuggled into Yorkshire from the Netherlands and France to avoid the duty.

In 1773 two excise cutters, the &quot;Mermaid&quot; and the &quot;Eagle&quot;, were outgunned and chased out of the bay by three smuggling vessels, a schooner and two shallops.
A pitched battle between smugglers and excise men took place in the dock over 200 casks of brandy and geneva (gin) and 15 bags of tea in 1779.

=== Fishing, farming and lifeboats ===

Fishing and farming were the original occupations followed by generations of Bay folk. Many houses in the village were built between 1650 and 1750 and whole families were involved in the fishing industry. Many families owned or part-owned cobles. Later some owned ocean-going craft. Fishing reached its peak in the mid 19th century, fishermen used the coble for line fishing in winter and a larger boat for herring fishing. Fish was loaded into panniers and men and women walked or rode over the moorland tracks to Pickering or York.

A plaque in the village records that a brig named &quot;Visiter&quot; ran aground in Robin Hood&#x27;s Bay on 18 January 1881 during a violent storm. In order to save the crew, the lifeboat from Whitby was pulled overland by 18 horses, with the deep snowdrifts present at the time cleared by 200 men. The road down to the sea through Robin Hood&#x27;s Bay village was narrow and had awkward bends, and men had to go ahead demolishing garden walls and uprooting bushes to make a way for the lifeboat carriage. It was launched two hours after leaving Whitby, with the crew of the &quot;Visiter&quot; rescued on the second attempt.

The main legitimate activity had always been fishing, but this started to decline in the late 19th century. These days most of its income comes from tourism.

Robin Hood&#x27;s Bay is also known for the large number of fossils which may be found on its beach. The foreshore rocks on the north side of the bay, in particular, are a well known location for finding ammonites, especially after winter storms.

In 1912, Professor Walter Garstang of Leeds University, in cooperation with Professor Alfred Denny of the University of Sheffield, established the Robin Hood&#x27;s Bay Marine Laboratory, which continued on the site for the next 71 years, closing in 1983.

== Governance ==
Robin Hood&#x27;s Bay was part of the chapelry of Fylingdales in the Liberty of Whitby Strand which was a wapentake in the North Riding of Yorkshire. From 1974 to 2023 it was part of the Borough of Scarborough.

== Geography ==

Robin Hood&#x27;s Bay is built in a fissure between two steep cliffs. The village houses were built mostly of sandstone with red-tiled roofs. The main street is New Road, which descends from the cliff-top where the manor house, the newer houses and St Stephen&#x27;s Church, Fylingdales stand. It passes through the village crossing the King&#x27;s Beck and reaches the beach by a cobbled slipway known as Wayfoot where the beck discharges onto the beach.

The cliffs are composed of Upper Lias shale, capped by Dogger and False Bedded Sandstones and shales of the Lower Oolite.

The &quot;Wine Haven Profile&quot; near Robin Hood&#x27;s Bay is the Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) of the Pliensbachian Epoch (183,0–189,6 mya), one of four chronographic substages of the Early Jurassic Epoch.

The headlands at each end of the beach are known as Ness Point or North Cheek (north) and Old Peak or South Cheek (south).

== Transport ==
The village was once served by Robin Hood&#x27;s Bay railway station on the Scarborough and Whitby Railway line which opened in 1885 and closed in 1965. The track of the old railway is now a footpath and cycleway. The nearest railway station is in Whitby.

The village connects to the A171 allowing access to Whitby and Scarborough. The X93 Arriva bus service between Scarborough and Middlesbrough passes through Robin Hood&#x27;s Bay every hour, increasing to every 30 minutes or every 20 minutes during the summer. Robin Hood&#x27;s Bay is the eastern terminus of Wainwright&#x27;s Coast to Coast Walk. Robin Hood&#x27;s Bay is also on the coastal section of the Cleveland Way, a long-distance footpath.

== Religion ==

Robin Hood&#x27;s Bay is in the parish of Fylingdales which contains two churches both dedicated to St Stephen. The Old St Stephen&#x27;s Church, Fylingdales, on the hill side at Raw, above the village, replaced an ancient church which had Saxon origins and was demolished in about 1821 and was a dependent chapel of Whitby Abbey. A new church, also St Stephen&#x27;s, designed by George Edmund Street, was built in 1870.
== Culture ==

The novel &quot;Dracula&quot; by Bram Stoker, written in 1897, has scenes set in Robin Hood&#x27;s Bay. Abraham visited the area recreating the steep steps and the sightings of the red eyes, the ship that ran aground with the immense dog, the dog being none other than Dracula.

Robin Hood&#x27;s Bay is the setting for the &quot;Bramblewick&quot; novels (&quot;Three Fevers&quot;, &quot;Phantom Lobster&quot;, &quot;Foreigners,&quot; &quot;Sally Lunn, Master Mariner&quot; and &quot;Sound of the Sea&quot;) by Leo Walmsley (1892–1966), who was educated in the schoolroom of the old Wesleyan Chapel, in the lower village. The 1935 film &quot;Turn of the Tide&quot;, based on Walmsley&#x27;s &quot;Three Fevers&quot;, was filmed in the village.

In 1925, the Fylingdales Group of Artists was founded at Denton Hawley&#x27;s studio in Robin Hood&#x27;s Bay.

In 1948, &quot;LIFE&quot; magazine ran a story of an unknown Poison Penman who had been writing spiteful anonymous letters to the inhabitants of Robin Hood&#x27;s Bay since 1928.

The 2008 film &quot;Wild Child&quot; contains several scenes filmed at Robin Hood&#x27;s Bay. The 2017 film &quot;Phantom Thread&quot; starring Daniel Day-Lewis features a number of Robin Hood&#x27;s Bay locations, including the classic interior of the Victoria Hotel and the clifftops above the village.

&quot;Missing in Time&quot;, a novel by Catherine Harriott, is set in Robin Hood&#x27;s Bay and contains references and descriptions of local history, geography and culture. &quot;Robin Hood&#x27;s Bay&quot; is a poem by children&#x27;s poet Michael Rosen.

The &quot;Bayfair&quot; newspaper contains news and local information on the village. Wireless Internet access is provided for visitors all around the village by the Bay Broadband Co-operative.

== Media ==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North East and Cumbria and ITV Tyne Tees. Television signals are received from the local relay transmitter which transmitted via the Bilsdale TV transmitter, the relay transmitter is situated near Ravenscar.

<doc id="1188986" wikidata="Q4053272" url="?curid=1188986" title="X-COM (email games)">
<text>X-COM (also X-COM: First Alien Invasion) was part of a budget range video game series released in 1999 by Hasbro Interactive for Microsoft Windows that relied solely on the &quot;play-by-mail&quot; concept.

==Overview==
X-COM has 50 maps (10 for each setting - Urban, UFO, Ice, X-COM Base and Alien Base). On each map there are a number of crates containing powerups (such as doubling the action points, damage or range of a unit for a turn, reveal the complete map for the same turn, instantly heal the unit, or provide a shield, landmine or grenades), but also hazards such as mines and traps or teleports. Like the older games, there are also explosive barrels; shooting a barrel and managing to explode it will damage and potentially kill all units nearby.

Unit and weapon design is based on the first game of the series, &quot;UFO-Enemy Unknown&quot;, except the human flame-thrower and sniper&#x27;s rifle and the alien helium thrower (the manual states the game has &quot;a wide variety of weapons all from the year 2001&quot;, while &quot;UFO-EU&quot; starts in 1999). Each unit is tied to a weapon; it isn&#x27;t possible, for instance, to equip a Commander with a rocket launcher instead of the sniper&#x27;s rifle.

The game is played in a simplified logic of the older games: each unit &quot;life&quot; is measured by hit points and can only move a certain number of squares depending on their action points. They can either shoot, move, or move but losing an action point for an opportunity shot—the unit will fire at any enemy unit that crosses its sights (this is only available for lighter weapons). Each weapon also has its own damage rating and range.

After all enemy units were killed, the winner would have their final score calculated from movements, stealth, firepower and bravery displayed in combat—one could win, but if in a clumsy and lucky way, a &quot;Terrible&quot; score was possible.

When Hasbro Interactive ceased operations, so did the e-mail servers.

<doc id="1188987" wikidata="Q1146510" url="?curid=1188987" title="Scott Murray (rugby union)">
<text>Scott Murray (born 15 January 1976) is a former rugby union player who played lock for Scotland. He was at one time the record caps holder for Scotland having represented them on 87 occasions, five of which as captain and playing at three World Cups. He also toured with the British &amp; Irish Lions and won Scotland player of the season three times. He is currently the head coach for the San Diego Legion of Major League Rugby (MLR).

==Club career==
Murray is a former Scottish school basketball international who attended Morgan Academy and Preston Lodge High School.
He represented Scotland at every youth level and has played for Preston Lodge RFC and Edinburgh Academicals before moving to England to help Bedford win the Allied Dunbar Premiership Division Two (now the RFU Championship) in 1998 and gain entrance to the English Premiership.

Murray went on to play for Saracens and Edinburgh before joining French team US Montauban following the 2007 Rugby World Cup. In July 2010 he joined Castres after Montauban were liquidated due to financial problems.

Murray left Castres in June 2012 to join newly promoted Mont-de-Marsan based side Stade Montois. In December, with two years still left on his playing contract, he was appointed as forwards coach following a reshuffle at the club that saw previous coach Marc Dantin moved to other duties. Mont-de-Marsan were relegated from the Top 14 at the end of the season finishing bottom of the table having only managed to win two games.

==National honours==
Murray&#x27;s debut for Scotland came against Australia on 22 November 1997 and he won the 1998–99 Scotland player of the season in the year when Scotland won the final Five Nations Championship.
Since then he has won this honour a further two times in 2001–02 and 2002–03 and gained selection for the British &amp; Irish Lions on their tour of Australia in 2001, although he did not feature in any of the full tests.

In the 2003 Rugby World Cup Countdown Test against Italy he captained the side from the start for the first time when he won his 50th cap.

Murray started all three Autumn Tests in November 2005 and became Scotland&#x27;s most capped player of all time, when on 10 March 2007, he collected his 83rd Test cap, surpassing Gregor Townsend&#x27;s previous record of 82 caps. He has collected another four caps since (the last being against the All Blacks in the 2007 Rugby World Cup) and held the national record until 14 June 2008, when Chris Paterson won his 88th cap.

Murray failed to make the initial 2008 Six Nations Championship squad, though he was later added but did not feature in any games.

==Low point==
During the Six Nations Scotland v Wales game at the Millennium Stadium on 12 February 2006 Murray was sent off by referee Steve Walsh after he perceived that Murray retaliated by lashing out with his boot following a late tackle by Ian Gough. His sending off was seen as a decisive point in the game that Wales won 28–18.

Murray became only the second Scotland player ever to be sent off (the other being second row colleague Nathan Hines) and was subsequently banned for three weeks, after an unsuccessful appeal, meaning he would miss the upcoming Calcutta Cup game.

==Coaching career==
In 2018 Murray took up a coaching role at San Diego Legion in the US Major League Rugby.

<text>Großhennersdorf () is a village and a former municipality in Görlitz district, Saxony, Germany. Since 1 January 2011, it is part of the town Herrnhut. The Bundesstraße 178 connects Großhennersdorf with Löbau and Zittau.

The town was founded in 1296. The town is best known perhaps as the home of Henriette Catharina von Gersdorff m.n. von Friesen, the widow of the Governor of Upper Lusatia, Nicolaus Baron von Gersdorf. The Katharinenhof school is named for her. She raised her grandson, Nicolaus Ludwig, Imperial Count von Zinzendorf und Pottendorf (1700–1760), the Renewer of the Unitas Fratrum i.e. Moravian Church, in the Castle (now in ruins) in Großhennersdorf. She was an extremely talented, well educated woman, conversant in several languages, an author and poet, with connections all over Europe.

The municipality subdivisions include Großhennersdorf, Neundorf, Schönbrunn, Euldorf and Heuscheune.

The aboriginal population was 12.7%.

Rossmere is relatively affluent, and most of its residents are in the middle-income range. There is still a significant working-class presence in the riding, however: 13.8% of the riding&#x27;s industry is in Health Care &amp; Social Assistance, with a further 10.1% work in the retail trade.

Although Rossmere&#x27;s first MLA was New Democratic Party premier Edward Schreyer, it was historically a swing seat between the NDP and the Progressive Conservatives. After Schreyer&#x27;s resignation in 1979, he was succeeded by the NDP&#x27;s Vic Schroeder, who was re-elected in the elections of 1981 and 1986 over his Conservative opposition. Schroeder was a senior cabinet minister in the government of Howard Pawley, but was defeated in the 1988 election that swept the NDP from office. Progressive Conservative Harold Neufeld held the seat from 1988 to 1993, while future MP and federal cabinet minister Vic Toews was the MLA from 1995 to 1999. Both served in the cabinets of Gary Filmon.

For much of the early part of the new millennium, however, the Conservatives were not competitive in the seat. New Democrat Harry Schellenberg, who first won the seat in a 1993 by-election before narrowly losing to Toews in the 1995 provincial election, regained the seat in the 1999 election by narrowly defeating Toews in a rematch. Schellenberg went on to win re-election in the 2003 provincial election with nearly two-thirds of the vote. Schellenberg was succeeded by fellow NDP member Erna Braun, who won the seat in 2007 provincial election with 60% of the vote. Notably, the Conservatives did not nominate a candidate until after the election was called. The Tories took back the seat amid the massive Tory wave that swept through the province in 2016, with Andrew Micklefield defeating Braun by a nearly 2-to-1 margin.

Rossmere has voted for the party that has won every general election since its creation, except 1977.

<text>New Liberalism () is a political party in Colombia. Originally founded by Luis Carlos Galán in 1979 as a dissident force of the Colombian Liberal Party and dissolved in the 1990s, the party was refounded in 2021 by two of his sons, Juan Manuel Galán Pachón and Carlos Fernando Galán.

== History ==

=== Original party ===
Running against both the conservatives and the mainstream Liberal Party, Galán lost the elections in 1982. He and his movement officially returned to the Liberal Party in 1987, but several of the members still considered themselves as part of a somewhat distinct entity. Back in the Liberal fold, Luis Carlos Galán appeared as the leading candidate in polls and hoped to be able to win the next presidential elections, which would be held in 1990.

After Galán&#x27;s assassination in 1989, any remnants of the original party had dissolved by the 1990s. 

=== Modern electoral history ===
At the legislative elections on 10 March 2002, the party won as one of the many small parties parliamentary representation. 

In 2021, the party was revived following a ruling by the Constitutional Court of Colombia.

In the 2022 Colombian parliamentary election, the newly revived party managed to elect two candidates for congress, Julia Miranda and Juan Sebastián Gómez.

In the 2023 Colombian regional and municipal elections, the party won 2 governorships and 40 mayorships. Carlos Fernando Galán won the election for Superior Mayor of Bogotá. He was officially inaugurated as Mayor on 1 January 2024. His priorities as mayor included security, embracing new technologies, gender equality, education, and job creation.

<text>James Marie-Antoine Monjaret de Kerjégu (27 February 1846 – 23 December 1908), French diplomat and politician, was born in Trévarez-Saint-Goazec (Finistère) to an ancient Breton family; his father, François-Marie Jacques de Kerjégu, was a member of the Chamber of Deputies and later a senator; two of his uncles had also been members of parliament.

After a stint in the diplomatic service of the Second Empire from 1867 until 1870, he saw service during the siege of Paris in the Franco-Prussian War. He then returned to the diplomatic service, occupying posts in Germany, Serbia, Russia, and Switzerland.

Kerjégu stood in the election of 1889 as a republican candidate, winning election with some 94% of the votes cast in his constituency in the Finistère. A committed republican, he was dedicated to law and order and governmental stability. He concerned himself particularly with economic and agricultural issues, and supported progressive causes, including welfare and public disability insurance. On the other hand, he opposed the progressive income tax and the separation of church and state, and he favoured a strong military.

He died in Paris during his fifth term in the Chamber.

<doc id="1189022" wikidata="Q21492957" url="?curid=1189022" title="Conlon">
<text>The Conlon family is an Irish noble family, the original Gaelic spelling being Ó Connalláin. In the tenth and eleventh centuries, the O&#x27;Conalláin were Princes of Ui Laeghari, an extensive territory in the counties of Meath and Westmeath, where the High King of Ireland historically derived his seat at the Hill of Tara. The O&#x27;Conlons were chiefs of Crioch Tullach, in County Tyrone and branches of this family in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries settled in the counties of Roscommon, Galway and Mayo. As a sept of the Northern Uí Néill, they claim descent from Niall of the Nine Hostages and his son Conall Gulban, both High Kings of Ireland.

== Name ==
O&#x27;Conlon is a variation of the anglicised version of Ó Connalláin. The name may be derived from two Irish Gaelic words &quot;Con&quot; (the genitive case of Cú, meaning &quot;hound&quot;) and &quot;Lón&quot; meaning lion - thereby implying a person who has the characteristics of a lion born of a hound - strength and speed. It is sometimes spelt Conlan, Conlen and Conlin. Like most surnames, it is occasionally used as a first name.

== Origins ==
The O&#x27;Conlons are a sept of the Cenél Conaill, or &quot;kindred of Conall&quot;, specifically descended as part of &quot;Cenél Aedha&quot;, through Aedha mac Ainmirech great-great grandson of Conall Gulban. His father, Ainmirech mac Sétnai is brother of Lugaid mac Sétnai, founder of the Cenél Luighdech. The Cenél Aedha are said to have given their name to the barony of Tirhugh (Tír Aedha) in County Donegal.

Their kingdom was known as Tír Conaill, with their powerbase at Mag Ithe in the Finn valley, however they gradually expanded to cover what is now counties Donegal and Fermanagh. The Cenél Conaill clashed regularly with their kin the Cenél nEogain, eventually capturing the latter&#x27;s original power-base of Ailech in the Inishowen peninsula—in modern-day County Donegal—by the 12th century. Related dynasties descended through Conall Cremthainne and Diarmait mac Cerbaill included the Síl nÁedo Sláine, the kings of Brega, descended from Colmán Már&#x27;s youngest brother Áed Sláine and the Kings of Uisnech, among others, belonging to Clann Cholmáin.

Through the common ancestry of Lóegaire mac Néill, the O&#x27;Conlons are also related to the O&#x27;Connell family, including Count Daniel Charles O&#x27;Connell, Eibhlín Dubh Ní Chonaill and the O&#x27;Connell Baronets.

Several prominent figures originating from the Tir Conail kingdom included Maximilian, Count von Tyrconnell.

<doc id="1189024" wikidata="Q954066" url="?curid=1189024" title="Robert C. Weaver">
<text>Robert Clifton Weaver (December 29, 1907 – July 17, 1997) was an American economist, academic, and political administrator who served as the first United States secretary of housing and urban development (HUD) from 1966 to 1968, when the department was newly established by President Lyndon B. Johnson. Weaver was the first African American to be appointed to a US Cabinet-level position.

Prior to his appointment as cabinet officer, Weaver had served in the administration of President John F. Kennedy. In addition, he had served in New York State government, and in high-level positions in New York City. During the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration, he was one of 45 prominent African Americans appointed to positions and helped make up the Black Cabinet, an informal group of African American public policy advisers. Weaver directed federal programs during the administration of the New Deal, at the same time completing his doctorate in economics in 1934 at Harvard University.

==Background==
Robert Clifton Weaver was born on December 29, 1907, into a middle-class family in Washington, D.C. His parents were Mortimer Grover Weaver, a postal worker, and Florence (Freeman) Weaver. They encouraged him in his academic studies. His maternal grandfather was Dr. Robert Tanner Freeman, the first African American to graduate from Harvard in dentistry.

The young Weaver attended the M Street High School, now known as the Dunbar High School. The high school for Blacks at a time of racial segregation had a national reputation for academic excellence. Weaver went on to Harvard University, where he earned a Bachelor of Science and Master of Arts degree. He also earned a Doctor of Philosophy degree in Economics, completing his doctorate in 1934.

==Career==

===Government===
====Washington====
In 1934, Weaver was appointed as an aide to United States Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes. In 1938, he became special assistant to the US Housing Authority. In 1942, he became administrative assistant to the National Defense Advisory Commission, the War Manpower Commission (1942), and director of Negro Manpower Service.

With a reputation for knowledge about housing issues, in 1934 the young Weaver was invited to join President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s Black Cabinet. Roosevelt appointed a total of 45 prominent blacks to positions in executive agencies, and called on them as informal advisers on public policy issues related to African Americans, the Great Depression and the New Deal.

Weaver drafted the US Housing Program under Roosevelt, which was established in 1937. The program was intended to provide financial support to local housing departments, as a subsidy toward lowering the rent poor African Americans had to pay. The program decreased the average rent from $19.47 per month to $16.80 per month. Weaver claimed the scope of this program was insufficient, as there were still many African Americans who made less than the average income. They could not afford to pay for both food and housing. In addition, generally restricted to segregated housing, African Americans could not necessarily take advantage of other subsidized housing.

====Chicago====
In 1944, Weaver became director of the Commission on Race Relations in the Office of the Mayor of Chicago. In 1945, he became director of community services for the Chicago-based American Council on Race Relations through 1948.

====New York====
In 1949, Weaver become director of fellowship opportunities for the John Hay Whitney Foundation. In 1955, Weaver the first Black State Cabinet member in New York when he became New York State Rent Commissioner under Governor W. Averell Harriman. In 1960, he became vice chairman of the New York City Housing and Redevelopment Board.

====Washington: HUD====
In 1961, Weaver became administrator of the United States Housing and Home Financing Agency (HHFA).

After election, Kennedy tried to establish a new cabinet department to deal with urban issues. It was to be called the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Postwar suburban development, following the construction of highways, and economic restructuring had drawn population and jobs from the cities. The nation was faced with a stock of substandard, aged housing in many cities, and problems of unemployment.

In 1961, while trying to create HUD, Kennedy had done everything short of promising the new position to Weaver. He appointed him Administrator of the Housing and Home Finance Agency (HHFA), a group of agencies which Kennedy wanted to raise to cabinet status.

Some Republicans and southern Democrats opposed the legislation to create the new department. The following year, Kennedy unsuccessfully tried to use his reorganization authority to create the department. As a result, Congress passed legislation prohibiting presidents from using that authority to create a new cabinet department, although the previous Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower administration had created the cabinet-level US Department of Health, Education, and Welfare under that authority.

He contributed the compilation housing bill in 1961. He took part in lobbying for the Senior Citizens Housing Act of 1962.

In 1965, Congress approved the department. At the time, Weaver was still Administrator of the HHFA. In public, President Lyndon B. Johnson reiterated Weaver&#x27;s status as a potential nominee but would not promise him the position. In private, Johnson had strong reservations. He often held pro-and-con discussions with Roy Wilkins, executive director of the NAACP.

Johnson wanted a strong proponent for the new department. Johnson worried about Weaver&#x27;s political sense. Johnson seriously considered other candidates, none of whom was black. He wanted a top administrator, but also someone who was exciting. Johnson was worried about how the new Secretary would interact with congressional representatives from the Solid South; they were overwhelmingly Democrat as most African Americans were still disenfranchised and excluded from the political system. This was expected to change as the federal government enforced civil rights and the provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. As candidates, Johnson considered the politician Richard Daley, mayor of Chicago; and the philanthropist Laurance Rockefeller.

Ultimately, Johnson believed that Weaver was the best-qualified administrator. His assistant Bill Moyers had rated Weaver highly on potential effectiveness as the new secretary. Moyers noted Weaver&#x27;s strong accomplishments and ability to create teams. Ten days after receiving the report, the president put forward the nomination, and Weaver was successfully confirmed by the United States Senate.

Weaver served as Secretary of United States Department of Housing and Urban Development from 1966 to 1968.

Weaver had expressed his concerns about African Americans&#x27; housing issue before 1930 in his article, &quot;Negroes Need Housing&quot;, published by the magazine &quot;The Crisis&quot; of the NAACP after the Stock Market Crash.&lt;ref name=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=-VoEAAAAMBAJ&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He noted there was a great difference between the income of most African Americans and the cost of living; African Americans did not have enough housing supply because of many social factors, including the long economic decline of rural areas in the South. He suggested a government housing program to enable all the African Americans the chance to buy or rent their house.

===Academia===
In 1945, Weaver began teaching at Columbia University.

In 1969, after serving under President Johnson, Weaver became president of Baruch College.

In 1970, Weaver became a distinguished professor of Urban Affairs at Hunter College in New York and taught there until 1978.

==Personal life and death==
In 1935, Robert C. Weaver married Ella V. Haith. They adopted a son, who died in 1962.

Weaver served on the boards of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (1969–1978) and Bowery Savings Bank (1969–1980). He served in advisory capacities to the United States Controller General (1973–1997), the New City Conciliation and Appeals Board (1973–1984), Harvard University School of Design (1978–1983), the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) Legal Defense Fund and NAACP executive board committee (1978–1997).

Robert C. Weaver died at age 89 on July 17, 1997, in Manhattan, New York.

<text>Thomas Orde Lawder Wilkinson VC (29 June 1894 – 5 July 1916), was an English-born Canadian and British Army officer who was a recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. A soldier with the Loyal North Lancashire Regiment during the First World War, he was ly awarded the VC for his actions on 10 July 1916, during the Battle of the Somme.

==Early life==
Wilkinson was born on 29 June 1894, the second son of Charles Orde Wilkinson and his wife, Edith, at Lodge Farm on Dudmaston estate near Bridgnorth in Shropshire, England. He attended Parkside School in Surrey and then Wellington College where he showed both academic and athletic prowess. He graduated in November 1912 by which time the Wilkinson family had emigrated to Vancouver in British Columbia, Canada, where his father had been working at the time of his birth.

==First World War==
Shortly after the outbreak of the First World War, Wilkinson joined the 16th Battalion (Canadian Scottish) at Vancouver. He had been working as a surveyor at the time of his enlistment. He was soon commissioned as a lieutenant. After the regiment arrived in England he transferred to the 7th Battalion, Loyal North Lancashire Regiment and by the start of 1916 was serving on the Western Front as a gunnery officer.

Wilkson&#x27;s battalion was part of the 56th Infantry Brigade, 19th Division, which was involved in the opening stages of the Battle of the Somme. During the battle, on 4 July 1916, his battalion was attacking the village of La Boisselle. A neighbouring unit had conceded ground and Wilkinson&#x27;s battalion was ordered to retake the position. A machine-gun had been left behind, which Wilkinson put into operation on reaching the position. He was able to hold off an attacking party of Germans until reinforcements arrived. He was killed shortly afterwards trying to bring a wounded soldier into cover. For his actions, he was ly awarded the Victoria Cross (VC). The VC, instituted in 1856, was the highest award for valour that could be bestowed on a soldier of the British Empire. The citation for Wilkinson&#x27;s VC read: 
As his body was never recovered, Wilkinson is commemorated with thousands of other British and Commonwealth soldiers on the British Memorial to the Missing at Thiepval. His name is also on the Sandwick War Memorial, in British Columbia. In 2004 a plaque to his memory was unveiled at the church in Quatt, near his place of birth. The plaque was commissioned by the Shropshire War Memorials Association after unsuccessful attempts to locate relatives of Wilkinson.

==Victoria Cross==
King George V presented Wilkinson&#x27;s VC to his father on 26 November 1916, in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace. He was also entitled to the 1914–15 Star, the British War Medal, and the Victory Medal. His VC and other medals are displayed at the Imperial War Museum in London.
