<doc id="1150820" wikidata="Q4801513" url="?curid=1150820" title="Culture of Los Angeles">
<text>The culture of Los Angeles is rich with arts and ethnically diverse. The greater Los Angeles metro area has several notable art museums including the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), the J. Paul Getty Museum on the Santa Monica Mountains overlooking the Pacific, the Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA), and the Hammer Museum. In the 1920s and 1930s Will Durant and Ariel Durant, Arnold Schoenberg and other intellectuals were the representatives of culture, in addition to the movie writers and directors. As the city flourished financially in the middle of the 20th century, culture followed. Boosters such as Dorothy Buffum Chandler and other philanthropists raised funds for the establishment of art museums, music centers and theaters. Today, the Southland cultural scene is as complex, sophisticated and varied as any in the world. Los Angeles is strongly influenced by Mexican American culture due to California formerly being part of Mexico and, previously, the Spanish Empire.

== History ==
The history of Los Angeles began in 1781 when 44 settlers from New Spain established a permanent settlement in what is now Downtown Los Angeles, as instructed by Spanish Governor of Las Californias, Felipe de Neve, and authorized by Viceroy Antonio María de Bucareli. This piece of history has been marked by a monument named &quot;El Pueblo&quot;. After sovereignty changed from Mexico to the United States in 1848, great changes came from the completion of the Santa Fe railroad line from Chicago to Los Angeles in 1885. &quot;Overlanders&quot; flooded in, mostly white Protestants from the Lower Midwest and South. Los Angeles began to grow as the built their first firehouse station in 1884 and the first home was built by Francisco Avila in 1818.

Los Angeles had a strong economic base in farming, oil, tourism, real estate and movies. It grew rapidly with many suburban areas inside and outside the city limits. Its motion picture industry made the city world-famous, and World War II brought new industry, especially high-tech aircraft construction. Politically the city was moderately conservative, with a weak labor union sector.

Since the 1960s, growth has slowed—and traffic delays have become infamous. Los Angeles was a pioneer in freeway development as the public transit system deteriorated. New arrivals, especially from Mexico and Asia, have transformed the demographic base since the 1960s. Old industries have declined, including farming, oil, military and aircraft, but tourism, entertainment and high-tech remain strong. Over time, droughts and wildfires have increased in frequency and become less seasonal and more year-round, further straining the city&#x27;s water security.

== The arts ==

=== Architecture ===

Los Angeles has many different types of architectural styles scattered throughout the city and nearby satellite cities. Los Angeles has a rich and diverse history of architectural works, having been known throughout professional architectural circles as a testbed for architecture. The case study houses in particular revolutionized residential architecture. Architects such as Richard Neutra, Jack Charney, Pierre Koenig, John Lautner and Frank Lloyd Wright all have important works in the city. Some of the different types of architectural styles throughout the city and metropolitan area are Mission Revival, Spanish colonial revival, craftsman, Norman French Provincial, French chateau, English Tudor, beaux arts, art deco, and streamline moderne.

In downtown Los Angeles, there are several buildings constructed in the Art Deco style. In recognition of this heritage, the recently built Metropolitan Transit Authority building incorporates subtle Art Deco characteristics.

Modern architecture in the city ranges from the works of pioneering African-American architect Paul Williams, to the iconoclastic deconstructivist forms of Frank Gehry, a long-time resident of the city. Charles Eames and his wife Ray Eames designed famous chairs and other domestic goods.

=== Visual arts in Los Angeles ===

The &quot;plein air&quot; movement of impressionistic landscape painting found early adherents in the Los Angeles area. Instrumental in the development of the genre was the California Art Club (est. 1909) that provided numerous exhibitions and lectures. The art form continues to be recognized as a signature style of California art. Much of the energy in the city&#x27;s art scene in the 1945 to 1980 stretch came from private collectors, artists&#x27; collectives, print shops, art schools and especially from commercial galleries.

In the 1960s, Corita Kent, then known as Sister Mary Corita of Immaculate Heart College, created bright, bold serigraphs carrying the messages of love and peace.

=== Public art in Los Angeles ===
&quot;See List of public art in Los Angeles&quot;

The oldest known public artwork in Los Angeles is the 1900 sculpture of a United States soldier by architects S. M. Goddard and Kilpatrick (no known sculptor), part of the , located in Pershing Square. The 1926 Central Library designed by Bertram Goodhue was an architectural masterpiece incorporating murals and sculptures throughout, notably four rotunda murals by Dean Cornwell depicting California history.
 Los Angeles is known for its murals, and many outdoor public art murals have been painted throughout the 20th century by early Mexican muralists Diego Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros and José Clemente Orozco.

During the 1960s and 1970s, the Chicano art movement took a strong hold in Los Angeles. Much of the work produced followed the Mexican muralist tradition of sending potent social messages. Works produced in this era included East Los Streetscapers, Judy Baca and others. Chicano arts in Los Angeles also gave rise to the internationally renowned Self Help Graphics &amp; Art, known for its Corita Kent-influenced serigraphs and its annual Día de los Muertos festival.

Public Art in the downtown area of Los Angeles during the 1970s was characterized by large abstract sculptures such as Herbert Bayer&#x27;s &quot;Double Ascension&quot; (1973), and Alexander Calder&#x27;s &quot;Four Arches&quot; (1973) installed with the commercial redevelopment of Bunker Hill. In 1989 the City passed an ordinance requiring developers to contribute one percent of the cost of construction of new buildings to a public art fund. The resulting funds for public art and public art programs in the 1990s, coupled with substantial subway and light rail transit in the 1990s, created public art installations in new rail stations and public spaces throughout the city and beyond.

Chris Burden&#x27;s &quot;Urban Light&quot; (2008) in front of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art on Wilshire Boulevard attracts hundreds of visitors daily, has been featured in several films as an iconic image of Los Angeles, and has become a tourist destination and popular public space.

=== Art museums and galleries ===
&quot;See List of museums in Los Angeles&quot;

There are 841 museums and art galleries in Los Angeles County. In fact, Los Angeles has more museums per capita than any other city in the world. Some of the notable museums are the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (the largest art museum in the Western United States), the Getty Center (part of the larger J. Paul Getty Trust, the world&#x27;s wealthiest art institution), the Battleship Iowa, and the Museum of Contemporary Art. A significant number of art galleries are located on Gallery Row, and tens of thousands attend the monthly Downtown Art Walk there.

In 1943, a community-run arts association in Pasadena merged with the better funded Pasadena Art Institute and moved into what is now the home of the Pacific Asia Museum. Renamed the Pasadena Art Museum, it organized some of the most adventurous and cutting edge shows of contemporary art in the region, notably, an early Pop art show in 1962, and a Marcel Duchamp retrospective in 1963. Although the city had a long tradition of visual arts supported by private collectors and galleries, Los Angeles did not have a comprehensive museum of art until 1965, when LACMA opened its doors. At about the same time, La Cienega Boulevard became home to many art galleries, most notably Ferus, featuring works by artists who lived in the area, Dwan Gallery, and Riko Mizuno Gallery. Although Andy Warhol was based in New York, the famous &quot;soup cans&quot; were first exhibited at Ferus. A local exponent of pop art was Ed Ruscha, some of whose work was representational, others consisted of simple slogans or mottoes which were usually humorous, being so far out of the context where such statements would normally appear. An example of this is &quot;Nice Hot Vegetables&quot; Larry Bell, for example, explored the interaction of a sculpture to its environment, demonstrating that the boundaries are usually not entirely clear. David Hockney, an English immigrant, produced figurative paintings set in idyllic Southern California locales, such as swimming pools in the bright sunlight, belonging to modernist houses. Although these paintings are representational, they seem to be composed of small color patches, somewhat like collages. Finish Fetish—a style that emphasized gleaming surfaces—and Light and Space—art about perception—were other Ferus-bred styles that allowed L.A. to distinguish itself from the rest of the art world. It was during this period that the contemporary arts scene in Los Angeles began to command the attention of collectors and museum directors internationally.

Some of the most respected art museums in the world can be found in Los Angeles. They include the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Broad, the J. Paul Getty Museum, the Norton Simon Museum, the Huntington Library art collection and botanical gardens, and the Hammer Museum at the University of California, Los Angeles. Los Angeles is known for its expansive collections of contemporary art- the Museum of Contemporary Art has three separate incarnations: the Geffen Contemporary, for larger installation pieces by more renowned artists, the MOCA Downtown, its standard collection, and the Pacific Palisades, a large, multi-purpose building in modernist style that houses offices as well as stores and showrooms for contemporary graphic design, architecture, and interior design. Other smaller art museums in the city include the Craft Contemporary, the California African American Museum, and many sculpture gardens throughout the city, including those at the American Jewish University and the Franklin D. Murphy Sculpture Garden. Private art collections that are open to the public are the ones by Eli Broad and the Frederick R. Weisman Art Foundation. The growth of Los Angeles as an art capital was first comprehensively documented in a series of exhibitions partially funded and spearheaded by the Getty, but held at all major museums during the Fall of 2011. &quot;The exhibitions, and the events that accompanied them as part of &quot;Pacific Standard Time&quot; demonstrated the pivotal role played by Southern California in national and international artistic movements since the middle of the 20th century. LA Plaza de Cultura y Artes (The culture square and arts museum) a Mexican-American museum and cultural center opened in April 2011. The museum contains interactive exhibits designed by experience design expert Tali Krakowsky such as a reconstruction of a 1920s Main Street. The museum shares the stories of the history, cultures, values, and traditions of Mexicans, Mexican Americans, and all Latinos in Los Angeles and Southern California. Art institutions from Santa Barbara to San Diego are joining together to create programs that highlighted the region&#x27;s vibrant artistic scene.&quot; Culver City&#x27;s La Cienega Boulevard features one of the highest concentrations of fine art galleries and studios in Southern California. The trendy bohemian neighborhoods of Silver Lake and Los Feliz are home to numerous smaller galleries, showcasing local or underground art. Gallery Row downtown is known for its small DIY galleries, such as The Smell, which doubles as a punk and noise music venue.

==== Art schools and colleges ====
Los Angeles County is home to three professional art colleges, Art Center College of Design, founded on 1930 in downtown Los Angeles as the Art Center School, Otis College of Art and Design, which was founded in 1917 as Otis Art Institute, and California Institute of the Arts, founded in 1961 as successor of the Chouinard Art Institute.

== Cuisine ==

Los Angeles is the home of the Cobb Salad, invented in the Brown Derby restaurant in Hollywood, the French-Dip sandwich, originated early in the 20th century by either Cole&#x27;s Pacific Electric Buffet or Phillippe&#x27;s—both of which still exist downtown, the ice blended coffee drink by Coffee Bean &amp; Tea Leaf and Original Tommy&#x27;s Hamburger. In 2018, PETA declared Los Angeles to be the &quot;most vegan-friendly city&quot; in the world.

The strength of the city&#x27;s scene is in &quot;ethnic&quot; dining and it is considered to be one of the most dynamic scenes in the world in terms of range and depth. The DineLA Restaurant Week offers twice a year a sample of the enormous variety of restaurants in Los Angeles. In its predominantly African American neighborhoods are soul food restaurants such as Roscoe&#x27;s House of Chicken and Waffles. According to &quot;Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America&quot;, Los Angeles &quot;remains the United States&#x27;s preeminent city to eat regional Mexican food.&quot; The city of Glendale has among the highest concentration of Armenian restaurants in the country.

Given its close proximity to Asia and constant flow of Asian immigrants, Asian food has a large foothold in Los Angeles. Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean and Thai restaurants are extremely common place. Japanese food in particular is a staple of Los Angeles&#x27; haute cuisine scene with places like Urasawa in Beverly Hills, Nobu in Malibu and Koi in Hollywood. California-styled cuisine is considered to be highly influenced by Asian seafood, as well as by Mediterranean cooking. The popularity of Asian food inspired food festivals such as 626 Night Market in Arcadia, where vendors sell traditional night market foods such as stinky tofu and skewers as well as modern fusion food such as ramen burgers and pho tacos.

== Cinema ==
The greater Los Angeles area is the most important site in the United States for movie and television production. This has drawn not only actors, but also writers, composers, artists, and other creative individuals to the area.

The area is home to many institutes that give awards annually for movie and television production such as the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences. There are many Film festivals, like the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Film Festival conducted by Outfest and Dances with Films held at the TCL Chinese Theatre. Specialty theatres like Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s New Beverly Cinema and art houses like the Nuart Theatre screen eclectic mixes of new and historic movies.

=== Hollywood ===
Hollywood is a neighborhood in the central region of Los Angeles, California. This ethnically diverse, densely populated neighborhood is notable as the home of the U.S. film industry, including several of its historic studios, and its name has come to be a shorthand reference for the industry and the people in it.

Although film production in Los Angeles remains the most important center for the medium, Hollywood has become more international, thus it faces increasing competition, however, from other parts of the United States and from the Canadian cities of Vancouver, British Columbia and Toronto, Ontario as well as numerous other countries around the world such as Romania and Australasia that provide Hollywood with lower production costs. The phenomenon of entertainment companies running away to other locales in search of lower labor and production costs is known as &quot;runaway production&quot; although the trend shows signs of reversing due to the state&#x27;s current Film &amp; Television Tax Credit Program administered by the California Film Commission.

The motion picture and TV industries have helped create the image that defines Los Angeles across the world. Many tourists flock to see Hollywood-related landmarks such as the Walk of Fame and the Hollywood Sign.

== Literature ==
Los Angeles&#x27;s literary history includes acclaimed authors such as Raymond Chandler, whose hard-boiled detective stories were set in pre-war and immediate post-war L.A. Ross Macdonald carried on the Chandler tradition into the 1950s, and in the 1960s and 1970s blended it with themes of classical tragedy. Walter Mosley, James Ellroy and Joseph Hansen are among the local successors to Chandler. Nathanael West&#x27;s book, &quot;The Day of the Locust&quot;, depicted a raw side to the Hollywood dream. Ray Bradbury wrote science fiction after moving to the city in 1934. In the 1960s, Joan Didion became one of Los Angeles&#x27;s most famous and acclaimed writers. Her essay collections &quot;Slouching Towards Bethlehem&quot; (1968) and &quot;The White Album&quot; (1979) as well as her novel &quot;Play It as It Lays&quot; (1970) established her as one of the preeminent chroniclers of the city. Actress Carrie Fisher found success as a novelist. The best known local poet was Charles Bukowski, who mostly lived in Hollywood but in the later part of his life lived in San Pedro. Tens of thousands of screenplays have been written by L.A. city residents, and the movie business has attracted many authors, including F. Scott Fitzgerald, Aldous Huxley, Tennessee Williams, Evelyn Waugh, William Faulkner and Joan Didion.

Los Angeles County boasts a plethora of independent bookstores such as Book Soup and Skylight Books, as well as a number of literary magazine, including the &quot;Los Angeles Review of Books&quot;, &quot;Slake&quot;, &quot;The Santa Monica Review&quot;, and &quot;Black Clock&quot;. Los Angeles has many public library branches, including the architecturally renowned Public Library. This city is also home to The Last Bookstore, which is the largest in California and second largest on the West Coast after Powell&#x27;s Books in Portland, Oregon.

=== Fiction ===
Los Angeles has provided fertile territory for writers of fiction with crime fiction being a common genre for stories about the city. During the 20th century, fiction portraying the city has highlighted the complexity of the city and the discontinuities between its public image and the reality of living there. The size and scale of the city have also provided crime writers with a suitably complex city against which to set their stories. Works that explore life in the city include:
* Eve Babitz, &quot;Eve&#x27;s Hollywood&quot;, 1974; &quot;Slow Days, Fast Company&quot;, 1977.
* James Robert Baker, &quot;Fuel-Injected Dreams&quot;, 1986; &quot;Boy Wonder&quot;, 1988.

* Héctor Tobar, &quot;The Barbarian Nurseries&quot;, 2011.
* Evelyn Waugh, &quot;The Loved One&quot;, 1947.
* Nathanael West, &quot;The Day of the Locust&quot;, 1939.

== Music ==
Los Angeles is also one of the most important cities in the world for the recorded music industry. The landmark Capitol Records building, which resembles a stack of albums, is representative of this. A&amp;M Records long occupied a studio off Sunset Boulevard built by Charlie Chaplin (who wrote the music for his own films). The Warner Brothers built a major recording business in addition to their film business. At the other end of the business, local Rhino Records began a reissue boom by digging through archives of old recordings and repackaging them for modern audiences.

Los Angeles had a vibrant African-American musical community even when it was relatively small: a number of musical artists congregated around Central Avenue, and the community produced a number of great talents, including Charles Mingus, Buddy Collette, Gerald Wilson, and others in the 1930s and 1940s before disappearing in the 1950s.

In the 1960s, the Sunset Strip became a breeding ground for bands like The Byrds, Buffalo Springfield, and The Doors. Randy Newman also started his career during this time, and the Beach Boys were founded in nearby Hawthorne during this same decade as well. Much hard rock has come out of Los Angeles, including legendary hard rockers Van Halen from nearby Pasadena, &quot;hair bands&quot; like Mötley Crüe, Ratt, W.A.S.P., and Guns N&#x27; Roses, thrash metal acts like Megadeth, Metallica (who later relocated to San Francisco) and Slayer (from Huntington Park), and also 1990s rock bands such as Jane&#x27;s Addiction, Korn, The Offspring, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Softer rock acts also flourished, as evidenced by the Eagles and Linda Ronstadt during the 1970s. There was a sizeable punk rock movement which spawned the hardcore punk movement featuring bands like X, Black Flag and Wasted Youth. In the 1980s, the Paisley Underground movement was native to Los Angeles. In the 1990s and early 21st century, Los Angeles&#x27; contribution to rock music continued with acclaimed artists such as Beck, Sublime of Long Beach, Tool, System of a Down, Rage Against the Machine, Crazy Town, No Doubt, Linkin Park, The Calling, Incubus, Hoobastank, Lifehouse, Eve 6, Sugar Ray, Deftones, Papa Roach, Alien Ant Farm, In This Moment, Avenged Sevenfold, AFI, Saosin, and Thirty Seconds to Mars. In addition, the gangsta rap of N.W.A, and later the solo careers of Dr. Dre, Eazy-E, Ice Cube, 2Pac and Snoop Dogg, among related acts, reestablished Los Angeles (particularly the communities of Long Beach and Compton) as a center of African-American musical development and G-funk as one of hip-hop&#x27;s major living styles. The 2000s saw a further flourishing of the Los Angeles rock scene with acclaimed acts such as Maroon 5 and a resurgence in West Coast hip hop in the form of rappers such as The Game. The Black Eyed Peas gained even greater popularity during this decade. The pop singers such as Belinda Carlisle, Paula Abdul, Justin Timberlake, Gwen Stefani, Fergie, Hilary Duff, Ashlee Simpson, Jesse McCartney, Aly &amp; AJ, Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Tisdale, Miley Cyrus, Selena Gomez, Demi Lovato, Colbie Caillat, Sara Bareilles, Katy Perry, Kesha, and Ariana Grande also anchored their singing careers in Los Angeles area as well.

In the heart of downtown Los Angeles is the Music Center of Los Angeles County. The Music Center consists of the new Walt Disney Concert Hall, the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, the Ahmanson Theatre, and the Mark Taper Forum. The courtyard, fountain, and public art make it a beautiful location. Adding to its cultural importance, on the same street are the Los Angeles Central Library, the Museum of Contemporary Art, the Colburn School of Performing Arts, and the Cathedral of our Lady of the Angels. The Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra now performs at Walt Disney Concert Hall after having spent many years in residence at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, and performs summer concerts at the Hollywood Bowl. The Los Angeles Master Chorale also calls the Walt Disney Concert Hall home. The Dorothy Chandler Pavilion is also the residence of the Los Angeles Opera and Dance at the Music Center. The Ahmanson Theatre, Mark Taper Forum, and the Kirk Douglas Theatre in Culver City, are home to the Center Theatre Group, directed by Michael Ritchie. Contemporary Opera Los Angeles presents performances that are sung in English and set in a contemporary style and their proceeds benefit local children&#x27;s education charities and animal rescue charities.

The demands of scoring thousands of hours of soundtracks for TV and movies also provides work for composers and classically trained musicians, bands, orchestras, and symphonies.

<text>Alta Lake State Park is a public recreation area located southwest of Pateros, Washington, at the northern end of Alta Lake, in the mountainous northwest interior of the state. The state park and adjacent lake lie beneath towering stone cliffs, formed by glaciation, that rise 1000 feet (304 m) above the valley floor, and carry on up to the top of Old Goat Mountain which sits 4200 ft (1280 m) above the park. A two-mile-long (3 km) road leading to the park, Alta Lake Road, intersects State Route 153, which runs along the Methow River. The park is managed by the Washington State Parks and Recreation Commission.

==History==
A jeweler and miner from Wilbur named the lake in 1900 after his daughter, Alta Heinz. In 1951, the city of Pateros gave the property to the state for the establishment of a state park. In 2014, the park was severely damaged during the Carlton Complex Fire, which forced the park to close for five weeks. Recovery efforts are on-going.

==Activities and amenities==
The park offers swimming, boating, fishing and sailboarding on Alta Lake, which measures about long and wide. The park has camping and picnicking facilities and of hiking trails. Golf is offered at the nearby Alta Lake Golf Course.

<doc id="1150827" wikidata="Q6126016" url="?curid=1150827" title="Bolivarian National Intelligence Service">
<text>The Bolivarian National Intelligence Service (, SEBIN) is the premier intelligence agency in Venezuela. SEBIN is an internal security force subordinate to the Vice President of Venezuela since 2012 and is dependent on Vice President Delcy Rodríguez. SEBIN has been described as the political police force of the Bolivarian government.

==History==
The Venezuelan intelligence agency has an extensive record of human rights violations, including recent allegations of torture and murder of political opponents. 

===Predecessors===

The predecessor of SEBIN was established in March 1969 with the name of DISIP, (&quot;National Directorate of Intelligence and Prevention Services&quot;), by then-president Rafael Caldera, replacing the Dirección General de Policía (DIGEPOL). 

Human Rights Watch wrote in 1993 that DISIP was involved in targeting political dissenters within Venezuela and was involved in abusive tactics. In their 1997 and 1998 reports, Amnesty International also detailed human rights violations by DISIP, including unlawful detention of Venezuelan human rights activists.

===Bolivarian Revolution===

In 1999, President Hugo Chávez began the restructuring of DISIP, with commanders and analysts being selected for their political attributes and rumors of some armed civilian groups gaining credentials from such actions. A retired SEBIN commissioner explained that there began to be &quot;biased and incomplete reports, tailored to the new ears, that began to proliferate and ultimately affects the ability of the institution to process information and know what happens&quot;. On December 4, 2009, President Chávez, during a swearing-in ceremony for the high command of the recently created Bolivarian National Police (Policía Nacional Bolivariana), announced the change of name of DISIP, with immediate effect, to Bolivarian Intelligence Service (Servicio Bolivariano de Inteligencia, or SEBIN).

The restructuring of SEBIN was completed in 2013 with one of its goals to guarantee the &quot;continuity and consolidation of the Bolivarian Revolution in power&quot;. In the beginning of the 2014 Venezuelan protests, SEBIN agents opened fire on protesters which resulted in the deaths of two and the dismissal of Brigadier General Manuel Gregorio Bernal Martinez days later.

Under the Nicolás Maduro presidency, a building that was originally intended to be a subway station and offices in Plaza Venezuela was converted into the headquarters for SEBIN.

==Domestic actions==

===Media===
SEBIN had raided facilities of reporters and human rights defenders several times. It was also stated that SEBIN occasionally intimidated reporters by following them in unmarked vehicles where SEBIN personnel would &quot;watch their homes and offices, the public places like bakeries and restaurants, and would send them text messages to their cell phones&quot;.

Following the Narcosobrinos incident which saw President Maduro&#x27;s nephews arrested in the United States for drug trafficking, Associated Press reporter Hannah Dreier, who had been awarded for her reporting on Venezuela, was detained by SEBIN agents in Sabaneta, Barinas. SEBIN agents threatened her during an interrogation, saying they would behead her like ISIL did to James Foley and said that they would let her go for a kiss. Finally, agents said that they wanted to coerce the United States to exchange Maduro&#x27;s nephews for Dreier, accusing her of being a spy and sabotaging the Venezuelan economy.

===Public surveillance===

In an &quot;El Nuevo Herald&quot;, former SEBIN officials and security experts state that the Venezuelan government has allegedly spent millions of dollars to spy on Venezuelans; using Italian and Russian technology to monitor emails, keywords and telephone conversations of its citizens; especially those who use the dominant, state-controlled telecommunications provider CANTV. Acquired information is used to create a &quot;person of interest&quot; for Venezuelan authorities, where only selected individuals could have been fully spied on and where a database had been created to monitor those who publicly disagreed with the Bolivarian Revolution.

In 2014, multiple Twitter users were arrested and faced prosecution due to the tweets they made. Alfredo Romero, executive director of the Venezuelan Penal Forum (FPV), stated that the arrests of Twitter users in Venezuela was a measure to instill fear among those using social media that were critical against the government. In October 2014, eight Venezuelans were arrested shortly after the death of PSUV official Robert Serra. Though the eight Venezuelans were arrested in October 2014, the Venezuelan government had been monitoring them since June 2014 according to leaked documents, with the state telecommunications agency Conatel providing IP addresses and other details to the Venezuelan intelligence agency SEBIN in order to arrest Twitter users.

====Surveillance of Jewish community====
In January 2013, 50 documents were leaked by &quot;Analisis24&quot; showing that SEBIN had been collecting &quot;private information on prominent Venezuelan Jews, local Jewish organizations and Israeli diplomats in Latin America&quot;. Some info that was gathered by SEBIN operations included office photos, home addresses, passport numbers and travel itineraries. The leaked documents were believed to be authentic according to multiple sources which included the Anti-Defamation League, that stated, &quot;It is chilling to read reports that the SEBIN received instructions to carry out clandestine surveillance operations against members of the Jewish community&quot;.

===Protest suppression===

====2004 Venezuela recall protests====
In March 2004, Amnesty International stated in a report following 2004 Venezuela recall protests that SEBIN (then DISIP) &quot;allegedly used excessive force to control the situation on a number of 
occasions&quot;.

====2014 Venezuelan protests====

Seven SEBIN members caused the first deaths of the 2014 Venezuelan protests on 12 February 2014 after shooting at unarmed and fleeing protesters several times, in violation of protocol, which resulted in the deaths of Bassil Da Costa and Juan Montoya. Days later, on February 17, armed SEBIN agents raided the headquarters of Popular Will in Caracas and held individuals who were inside at gunpoint.

Following human rights violations by SEBIN during the protests, U.S. President Barack Obama used powers granted from the Venezuela Defense of Human Rights and Civil Society Act of 2014 and ordered the United States Department of the Treasury to freeze assets and property of the Director General of SEBIN, Gustavo Enrique González López and the former Director General, Manuel Gregorio Bernal Martínez.

=== Torture ===

Dubbed &quot;La Tumba&quot;, or &quot;The Tomb&quot;, by Venezuelan officials, political prisoners are held five stories underground of the SEBIN headquarters in inhumane conditions at freezing temperatures and with no ventilation, sanitation, or daylight. The cells are two by three meters that have a cement bed, security cameras and barred doors, with each cell aligned next to one another so there are no interactions between prisoners. Such conditions have caused prisoners to become very ill though they are denied medical treatment. Denounces of torture in &quot;The Tomb&quot;, specifically white torture, are also common, with some prisoners attempting to commit suicide. Such conditions are to force prisoners to plead guilty to crimes they are accused of.

The torture of political prisoners has included the capture, mistreatment and in some cases killing of their pets.

A SEBIN former official told the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Venezuela that its director, , was directly involved in torture within the agency during the protests. Among other ill-treatment, he placed plastic bags on protesters, or poured water on them, and beat them to extract information.

==International actions==
===United States===

In 2012, Livia Acosta Noguera and at least 10 other SEBIN agents that were allegedly operating under the guise of diplomatic missions left the United States following a controversy involving Acosta. In a Univision documentary, while Acosta was a cultural attaché in Mexico, she allegedly met with Mexican students posing as hackers that were supposedly planning to launch cyberattacks on the White House, the FBI, The Pentagon and several nuclear plants. After an FBI investigation and reactions from members of the United States congress, the United States Department of State declared Acosta &quot;persona non grata&quot;.

Despite the withdrawal of SEBIN agents, the government of Nicolás Maduro allegedly &quot;maintains a network of spies in the United States, formed by supporters of the Bolivarian Revolution who are paid handsomely,&quot; according to former SEBIN officials. The former officials also stated that the contributions of &quot;spies&quot; is maintained by members of the &quot;Patriotas Cooperantes&quot; and from open source contributions, such as from press reports or information posted on websites. The Venezuelan government has used such tactics to reportedly observe government opposition organizations in the United States and has allegedly spied on United States government officials such as Cuban-American senator and representative Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL), respectively.

On 15 February 2019, General Director Manuel Cristopher Figuera was sanctioned by the United States for suspected human rights violations and torture. Following the Venezuelan uprising on 30 April 2019, the U.S. removed sanctions against Manuel Cristopher Figuera, who broke ranks with Maduro.

=== Chile ===

On February 21, 2024, SEBIN allegedly kidnapped the Venezuelan dissident and former army member Ronald Ojeda from his apartment in Santiago de Chile. Ojeda had received political asylum in Chile in 2023.

==Operations==

SEBIN operates from two headquarters; El Helicoide the original headquarters of the agency. Its second and more updated facility at Plaza Venezuela, where &quot;La Tumba&quot; (The Tomb) is located.

This federal entity could be considered the only security agency in Venezuela that never participates in any direct involvement with the general public. SEBIN doesn&#x27;t patrol the public roads, arrest civilians, or do regular law enforcement work like police departments and doesn&#x27;t participate in any police raids, joint task forces, or operations not related to the ministry of interior and justice. It is an agency that combines their counterparts of the FBI, CIA, Secret Service, and US Marshal core work, such as counterterrorism, intelligence, counterintelligence, government investigations, and background investigations and provides protection/escort for high-ranking government officials, among other federally mandated duties. Officers of this agency are rarely seen in public wearing their full black uniforms; they can be seen providing protection within a few federal buildings throughout the country.

<doc id="1150833" wikidata="Q2266743" url="?curid=1150833" title="Areal velocity">
<text>In classical mechanics, areal velocity (also called sector velocity or sectorial velocity) is a pseudovector whose length equals the rate of change at which area is swept out by a particle as it moves along a curve. It has SI units of square meters per second (m2/s) and dimension of square length per time L2 T−1.

In the adjoining figure, suppose that a particle moves along the blue curve. At a certain time &quot;t&quot;, the particle is located at point &quot;B&quot;, and a short while later, at time &quot;t&quot; + Δ&quot;t&quot;, the particle has moved to point &quot;C&quot;. The region swept out by the particle is shaded in green in the figure, bounded by the line segments &quot;AB&quot; and &quot;AC&quot; and the curve along which the particle moves. The areal velocity magnitude (i.e., the &quot;areal speed&quot;) is this region&#x27;s area divided by the time interval Δ&quot;t&quot; in the limit that Δ&quot;t&quot; becomes vanishingly small. The vector direction is postulated to be normal to the plane containing the position and velocity vectors of the particle, following a convention known as the right hand rule.

Conservation of areal velocity is a general property of central force motion, and, within the context of classical mechanics, is equivalent to the conservation of angular momentum.

==Relationship with angular momentum==
Areal velocity is closely related to angular momentum. Any object has an orbital angular momentum about an origin, and this turns out to be, up to a multiplicative scalar constant, equal to the areal velocity of the object about the same origin. A crucial property of angular momentum is that it is conserved under the action of central forces (i.e. forces acting radially toward or away from the origin). Historically, the law of conservation of angular momentum was stated entirely in terms of areal velocity.

A special case of this is Kepler&#x27;s second law, which states that the areal velocity of a planet, with the sun taken as origin, is constant with time. Because the gravitational force acting on a planet is approximately a central force (since the mass of the planet is small in comparison to that of the sun), the angular momentum of the planet (and hence the areal velocity) must remain (approximately) constant. Isaac Newton was the first scientist to recognize the dynamical significance of Kepler&#x27;s second law. With the aid of his laws of motion, he proved in 1684 that any planet that is attracted to a fixed center sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time. For this reason, the law of conservation of angular momentum was historically called the &quot;principle of equal areas&quot;. The law of conservation of angular momentum was later expanded and generalized to more complicated situations not easily describable via the concept of areal velocity. Since the modern form of the law of conservation of angular momentum includes much more than just Kepler&#x27;s second law, the designation &quot;principle of equal areas&quot; has been dropped in modern works.

=== Derivation of the connection with angular momentum ===

In the situation of the first figure, the area swept out during time period Δ&quot;t&quot; by the particle is approximately equal to the area of triangle &quot;ABC&quot;. As Δ&quot;t&quot; approaches zero this near-equality becomes exact as a limit.

Let the point &quot;D&quot; be the fourth corner of parallelogram &quot;ABDC&quot; shown in the figure, so that the vectors &quot;AB&quot; and &quot;AC&quot; add up by the parallelogram rule to vector &quot;AD&quot;. Then the area of triangle &quot;ABC&quot; is half the area of parallelogram &quot;ABDC&quot;, and the area of &quot;ABDC&quot; is equal to the magnitude of the cross product of vectors &quot;AB&quot; and &quot;AC&quot;. This area can also be viewed as a (pseudo)vector with this magnitude, and pointing in a direction perpendicular to the parallelogram (following the right hand rule); this vector is the cross product itself:
formula_1

Hence
formula_2

The areal velocity is this vector area divided by Δ&quot;t&quot; in the limit that Δ&quot;t&quot; becomes vanishingly small:
formula_3

But, formula_4 is the velocity vector formula_5 of the moving particle, so that
formula_6

On the other hand, the angular momentum of the particle is
formula_7

and hence the angular momentum equals 2&quot;m&quot; times the areal velocity.

==Relationship with magnetic dipoles==
Areal velocity is also closely related to the concept of magnetic dipoles in classical electrodynamics. Every electric current possesses a (pseudo)vectorial quantity called a &quot;magnetic dipole moment&quot; about a given origin. In the special case that the current consists of a single moving point charge, the magnetic dipole moment about any given origin turns out to be, up to a scalar factor, equal to the areal velocity of the charge about the same origin. In the more general case where the current consists of a large but finite number of moving point charges, the magnetic dipole moment is the sum of the dipole moments of each of the charges, and hence, is proportional to the sum of the areal velocities of all the charges. In the continuity limit where the number of charges in the current becomes infinite, the sum becomes an integral; i.e., the magnetic dipole moment of a continuous current about a given origin is, up to a scalar factor, equal to the integral of the areal velocity along the current path. If the current path happens to be a closed loop and if the current is the same at all points in the loop, this integral turns out to be independent of the chosen origin, so that the magnetic dipole moment becomes a fundamental constant associated with the current loop.

<doc id="1150840" wikidata="Q158203" url="?curid=1150840" title="Soldanella">
<text>The genus Soldanella, commonly known in English as snowbell, includes about 15 species of flowering plants native to European mountains, from the Pyrenees, the Apennines, the Alps, the Carpathians and the Balkans. They grow in woods, damp pastures and rocky landscapes from 500-3,000 m above sea level, often in hollows which hold snow into late spring and early summer. The name &quot;Soldanella&quot; means &quot;little coins&quot; in Italian.

==Appearance==
The plant typically has a basal rosette of simple, orbicular leaves 1–5 cm wide, with the flower stalks arising from the centre of the rosette, each stalk bearing 1-6 white to violet flowers.

The species are similar to each other and it is nearly impossible to identify images. Subtle differences are observable using a magnifying glass.

The species can be lumped in groups of similar appearance.

Large-sized plants

1. &quot;S. villosa&quot; occurring in Basque Lands at low elevations has large papery leaves and about 1 mm glandular hairs on petioles.

Medium-sized plants

2. &quot;S. alpina&quot; including &quot;S. occidentalis&quot; and &quot;S. pyrolaefolia&quot; occurring in the Alps and Southern European mountains has sitting glands on petioles, scapes and pedicels.

3. &quot;S. carpatica&quot; occurring in the Western Carpathians in Slovakia and Poland has sitting glands on petioles but short glandular hairs on pedicels.

4. &quot;S. marmarossiensis&quot; including &quot;S. rugosa&quot; occurring in the North-Eastern Carpatians in Ukraine and Romania has short glandular hairs on petioles and pedicels and narrowly crateriform corolla.

5. &quot;S. angusta&quot;, &quot;S. calabrella&quot;, &quot;S. chrysosticta&quot; including &quot;S. cyanaster&quot;, &quot;S. hungarica&quot;, &quot;S. major&quot;, &quot;S. montana&quot;, &quot;S. oreodoxa&quot;, &quot;S. pindicola&quot; including &quot;S. dimoniei&quot; and &quot;S. macedonica&quot;, &quot;S. pseudomontana&quot;, &quot;S. rhodopaea&quot;, &quot;S. tatricola&quot; all having broadly crateriform corolla mutually differ in the length and shape of cells forming short glandular hairs on petioles and pedicels.

Small-sized plants

6. &quot;S. alpicola&quot; occurring in the Alps, &quot;S. pusilla&quot; occurring in the Southern Carpathians and &quot;S. pirinica&quot; occurring in Bulgaria are characterized by the top position of the bract and sitting glands. Often encountered hybrid &quot;S. alpina&quot; × &quot;S. alpicola&quot; has laterally positioned bract.

7. &quot;S. austriaca&quot; and &quot;S. minima&quot; occurring in the Alps and Apennines are characterized by short glandular hairs and laterally positioned bract.

<doc id="1150844" wikidata="Q292668" url="?curid=1150844" title="AGS-17">
<text>The AGS-17 Plamya (Russian: Пламя; &quot;Flame&quot;) is a Soviet-designed automatic grenade launcher in service worldwide.

==Description==
The AGS-17 is a heavy infantry support weapon designed to operate from a tripod or mounted on an installation or vehicle. The AGS-17 fires 30 mm grenades in either direct or indirect fire to provide suppressive and lethal fire support against soft-skinned or fortified targets.

The weapon uses a blowback mechanism to sustain operation. Rounds are fired through a removable (to reduce barrel stress) rifled barrel.

The standard metal ammunition drum contains 29 linked rounds.

The tripod is equipped with fine levelling gear for indirect fire trajectories.

==Development==
Development of the AGS-17 (&quot;Avtomaticheskiy Granatomyot Stankovyi&quot;—Automatic Grenade launcher, Mounted) started in the USSR in 1965 by the OKB-16 design bureau (now known as the KB Tochmash), under the leadership of Alexander F. Kornyakov.

This lightweight weapon was to provide infantry with close to medium range fire support against enemy personnel and unarmored targets, like trucks, half-tracks, jeeps and sandbag-protected machine-gun nests. The first prototypes of the new weapon entered trials in 1969, with mass production commencing in 1971. The AGS-17 was widely operated and well-liked by Soviet troops in Afghanistan as a ground support weapon or as a vehicle weapon on improvised mounts installed on armoured personnel carriers and trucks.

A special airborne version of the AGS-17, the AG-17A, was developed for installation on helicopters, including the Mi-24 Hind in gun pods and the Mil Mi-8 on door mounts. This weapon had a thick aluminium jacket on the barrel and used a special mount and an electric remotely controlled trigger.

It is still in use with the Russian army as a direct fire support weapon for infantry troops; it is also installed in several vehicle mounts and turrets along with machine guns, guided rocket launchers and sighting equipment. It is being replaced by the AGS-30 launcher, which fires the same ammunition, but weighs only 16 kg unloaded on the tripod and has an upgraded blowback action.

==Variants==
*AG-17A - remotely controlled aircraft-mounted version with an electric trigger mechanism.
*AGS-17D - remotely controlled vehicle-mounted version with an electric trigger mechanism.

==RGSh-30==
Ukrainian company Precision Systems developed a miniaturized handheld version of AGS-17 called RGSh-30 &quot;in order to create a grenade launcher that could respond to the needs of Ukrainian units and special forces operating in the Donbas&quot;. RGSh-30 is designed to disable armored vehicles. that can be carried like an assault rifle. RGSh-30 uses magazines with five 30mm VOG-17 grenades.

Precision Systems plans to develop versions using 20mm, 25mm, and 40mm grenades.

==Ammunition==
The AGS-17 fires belted cartridges with a steel cartridge case. Two types of ammunition are commonly fired from the AGS-17. The VOG-17M is the version of the original 30 mm grenade ammunition, which is currently available and has a basic high explosive fragmentation warhead. The VOG-30 is similar, but contains a better explosive filling and an enhanced fragmentation design that greatly increases the effective blast radius. New improved VOG-30D grenade was taken into service in 2013 for use with AGS-17 and AGS-30 grenade launchers. It was ordered by the Russian Defense Ministry in August 2023. The same month, the Russian troops fighting in Ukraine begun to receive VOG-17 grenades, factory modified for use by commercial drones.

The Bulgarian weapons manufacturer Arcus produces AR-ROG hand grenades based on VOG-17 cartridges and (Russian: УЗРГМ), which is also a Soviet design of fuse. Similar improvised grenades are known as &quot;khattabkas&quot;.

<text>The Milk-Eyed Mender is the debut studio album by American singer-songwriter Joanna Newsom, released on March 23, 2004, by Drag City.

==Background==
Newsom wrote all the songs on the album except for &quot;Three Little Babes&quot;, a traditional Appalachian song by Texas Gladden. According to the liner notes, Newsom plays &quot;a Lyon &amp; Healy style 15 harp, a wurlitzer electric piano, a harpsichord, and piano.&quot;

A bandmate in San Francisco band The Pleased, Noah Georgeson, produced and recorded the album, as well as contributing guitar to two tracks and backing vocals to one. Cover art embroidery is by Emily Prince and photographs are by Alissa Anderson. Newsom thanks former touring partners Will Oldham, Devendra Banhart, and Vetiver, along with many others.

The song &quot;Swansea&quot; was covered by the band Bombay Bicycle Club and featured on their sophomore album &quot;Flaws&quot; in 2010. 
The song &quot;The Book of Right-On&quot; was both sampled from and reprised by Newsom on The Roots&#x27; 2010 release &quot;How I Got Over&quot;, the refrain forming the backbone of &#x27;Right On&#x27;, the album&#x27;s ninth track, and covered by bluegrass musician Sarah Jarosz on her 2013&#x27;s album &quot;Build Me Up from Bones.&quot;

==Critical reception==
&quot;The Milk-Eyed Mender&quot; received widespread critical acclaim from contemporary music critics, earning Newsom several accolades that same year and by the end of the decade.

MacKenzie Wilson of AllMusic gave the album a favorable review, stating, &quot;Newsom&#x27;s childlike voice brings an unstudied grace to an innocent setting of songs, and such quirkiness is hard to find among most guitar-driven indie acts. Delicate harp arrangements are nicely sprinkled among specks of pianos, organs, and a harpsichord, only adding to the fascination that is &quot;Milk-Eyed Mender&quot;. Newsom exists in several musical spheres, one being a member of The Pleased, while not forgetting how wonderful it is to live in a warm place that leaves you bright-eyed and hopeful for only what is good in life.&quot;

&quot;The Sunday Times&quot; ranked it at #28 on its best albums of the decade list, and in 2009, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; named &quot;The Milk-Eyed Mender&quot; the 47th greatest album of the 2000s. The website also named &quot;Peach, Plum, Pear&quot; the 197th Greatest Song of the 2000s (decade) and &quot;Sprout &amp; The Bean&quot; the 229th. &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; named the album the 83rd best album of its decade. &quot;The Milk-Eyed Mender&quot; was also ranked number 76 inside &quot;Tiny Mix Tapes&#x27;s&quot; greatest records of the 2000s (decade) list.

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Milk-Eyed Mender&quot; has sold more than 200,000 copies in the U.S., despite not charting.

<text>The New York Connecting Railroad or NYCR is a rail line in the borough of Queens in New York City. It links New York City and Long Island by rail directly to the North American mainland. Amtrak, CSX, Canadian Pacific Kansas City, Providence and Worcester Railroad and New York and Atlantic Railway (NYAR) currently use the line. It runs from the Hell Gate Bridge over the East River to Fresh Pond Junction yard in Glendale in Queens. It was completed in 1917. Amtrak uses the northernmost section of the line from Sunnyside Junction (Bowery Bay) in the Woodside section of Queens to the Hell Gate Bridge into the Bronx from which it follows the line north to Boston.

Amtrak owns the line north of Sunnyside Junction, which forms part of the Northeast Corridor. From this point to Fresh Pond Junction CSX is the owner, with the line known as the Fremont Secondary. South of Fresh Pond, the line leads into the Bay Ridge Branch, a freight-only branch owned by the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) and operated by the New York and Atlantic Railway.

==Route description==
The line begins at the Hell Gate Bridge over the East River. This is a massive bridge, with a main span of and a total length of over . Continuing south, the line is on a high-level elevated viaduct over Astoria and Interstate 278 (Grand Central Parkway). The line is then on an embankment until Sunnyside Junction, where Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor line branches off. The line heads south and parallels Interstate 278 (Brooklyn-Queens Expressway) for a distance. This portion of the line was completely rebuilt in 2002. Now in the section of Elmhurst, the NYCR passes under several streets in a cut. An arched concrete viaduct over Queens Boulevard is followed by cuts and overpasses over streets in Maspeth, Queens.

After crossing under the Long Island Expressway (Interstate 495) and passing a few cemeteries, the line reaches Fresh Pond Junction. This is the main facility for shipping freight by rail in and out of New York City and Long Island. The New York and Atlantic Railway, which operates freights on the Long Island Rail Road under a privatized concession, has its main offices at Fresh Pond. CSX and PW also interchange freight with NYAR here.

South of Fresh Pond Junction, the line continues south as the LIRR&#x27;s Bay Ridge Branch to the 65th Street Yard.

The line has three tracks to the north of Sunnyside Junction and one track to the south of this point (with two-track sections in some areas).

There is a proposal to connect to the Spuyten Duyvil and Port Morris Railroad spur between the Northeast Corridor at 141st Street to the Harlem Line at 163rd Street and Melrose Avenue, as part of a New York City Subway circumferential line called Triboro RX.

==Operation==
CSX serves the line with one to three daily round trips, with trains based out of Oak Point Yard. The CSX trains bring general freight to the interchange with the New York and Atlantic Railway at Fresh Pond Junction, in Queens, and return with empties and container loads of solid waste. Providence and Worcester runs three trains per week carrying gravel from Cedar Hill Yard in New Haven, CT, to Fresh Pond.

== Origins ==
The New York Connecting Railroad was incorporated on April 21, 1892, and was jointly owned by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad (the &quot;New Haven&quot;) and the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR). The line opened in 1917 as a connection between the New Haven&#x27;s Harlem River and Port Chester Railroad and the PRR East River Tunnels to Penn Station and the North River Tunnels under the Hudson River.

The line was dedicated on March 9, 1917 by PRR President Samuel Rea and engineer Gustav Lindenthal. A special train took the directors of the New Haven over the line on March 25, 1917, and at that time it was turned over to the New Haven for operation, though the Southern Division (freight-only) was not yet complete. Passenger service began on April 1, 1917, with the return of the &quot;Federal Express&quot; and the rerouting of two local trains. The &quot;Colonial&quot; began using it April 30, resulting in the first accident on the NYCR on August 20, 1917. Through freights to Bay Ridge began January 17, 1918, and the final work was completed August 7, 1918.

== Electrification ==
The New York Connecting Railroad was electrified around 1917 and last extension completed in 1927 as an extension of the New Haven&#x27;s system. The NYCR system encompassed 20 route miles (32 km) of track, and was electrified, like the New Haven, using overhead catenary at 11 kV, 25 Hz. The system received power from the New Haven Cos Cob Power Station and Consolidated Edison 201st generating station via the West Farms substation. Additional power was supplied from a 5 MW, 7 kVA, 11 kV, three-phase to single-phase converter installed at East New York. This unit was also operated in synchronous condenser mode for reactive power support. (&quot;See&quot; Amtrak&#x27;s 25 Hz traction power system.)

Like the New Haven, the NYCR traction power was distributed using the 2 x 11 kV autotransformer topology. Two wires, the feeder and the catenary (often called the trolley wire), carried voltage of 11 kV to ground, but of opposite phase such that the feeder and catenary were 22 kV phase-to-phase. Six autotransformer stations, spaced an average of 3.8 miles apart along the line, converted power. Each station contained oil circuit breakers for both feeder and trolley buses, bus sectioning switches, and one 3 MVA outdoor autotransformer.

The LIRR portion of the system (essentially everything to the south of Bowery Bay), along with the freight catenary from West Farms over Hell Gate to Bowery Bay, was removed in 1969-1970. By 1986 Amtrak, which had inherited the Connecting Railroad, changed the traction power system over to 60 Hz operation coincident with the Metro-North Railroad re-powering of the New Haven Line at 60 Hz and de-activation of the Cos Cob Power Station. The autotransformer architecture was retained, but the source of power changed from the Metro-North New Haven Line system to the Con Edison-supplied Van Nest Substation ().

<doc id="1150863" wikidata="Q1742272" url="?curid=1150863" title="Theatre organ">
<text>A theatre organ (also known as a theater organ, or, especially in the United Kingdom, a cinema organ) is a type of pipe organ developed to accompany silent films from the 1900s to the 1920s.
Theatre organs have horseshoe-shaped arrangements of stop tabs (tongue-shaped switches) above and around the instrument&#x27;s keyboards on their consoles. Theatre organ consoles were typically decorated with brightly colored stop tabs, with built-in console lighting. Organs in the UK had a common feature: large translucent surrounds extending from both sides of the console, with internal colored lighting. Theatre organs began to be installed in other venues, such as civic auditoriums, sports arenas, private residences, and churches.

Though there are few original instruments, hundreds of theatre pipe organs are installed in public venues throughout the world today, while many more exist in private residences.

==History==
Originally, films were accompanied by pit orchestras in larger houses, and pit pianists in small venues. The first organs installed in theatres were church organs. These organs were ill-suited to accompanying the film and the performance. 

The earliest concepts of the theatre organ were modified pianos with a few ranks of pipes and various sound effects, housed in one cabinet, and typically located in the pit area. These were photoplayers.

Robert Hope-Jones&#x27;s concept, which he called a &quot;unit orchestra&quot;, was developed and promoted, initially by the Rudolph Wurlitzer Company of North Tonawanda, New York. A new type of instrument, the Wurlitzer Hope Jones Unit-Orchestra, or simply theatre organ, was born. Soon, hundreds of instruments were being ordered from Wurlitzer and other manufacturers who copied the design for their own theatre organs.

The Rudolph Wurlitzer company, to whom Robert Hope-Jones licensed his name and patents, was the most well-known manufacturer of theatre organs, and the phrase &quot;Mighty Wurlitzer&quot; became an almost generic term for the theatre organ. After some major disagreements with the Wurlitzer management, Robert Hope-Jones committed suicide in 1914.

In Europe, the theatre organ appeared in cinemas after World War I. Some came from Wurlitzer, but there were European organ builders like &quot;M. Welte &amp; Söhne&quot; and &quot;Walcker&quot; in Germany, and &quot;Standaart&quot; in the Netherlands.

After the development of sound movies, theatre organs remained installed in many theatres to provide live music between features. After the &quot;golden years&quot; of the 1920s and 1930s, many were scrapped or sold to churches, private homes, museums, ice rinks, rollatoriums, and restaurants. 

The British Broadcasting Corporation bought and installed its first organ in 1933 in Broadcasting House, London. The first full-scale BBC Theatre Organ was used for broadcasts in 1936 from across the road at St George&#x27;s Hall.

In the 1950s, the development of high-fidelity recording and the LP phonograph record created new interest in the theatre organ. This period also saw the formation of the American Theatre Organ Society (ATOS), originally the American Theatre Organ Enthusiasts (ATOE).

===Manufacturers and production totals===

These were the major builders of theatre organs, listed in order of production. The numbers listed here are for theatre organs only.

==Technical aspects==

As in a traditional pipe organ, a theatre organ uses pressurized air to produce musical tones. Unification and extension give the theatre organ its unique flexibility. A rank is extended by adding pipes above and below the original pitch, allowing the organist to play that rank at various pitches by selecting separate stop tabs.
The electro-pneumatic action was invented by Robert Hope-Jones. Up to the turn of the 20th century, all pipe organs were operated by a &quot;tracker&quot;, &quot;tubular pneumatic&quot;, or &quot;pneumatic Barker-lever&quot; action, where the keys and pedals were physically connected to the pipe valves via wooden trackers, except in the case of tubular pneumatic, where all actions were operated by air pressure. Hope-Jones&#x27; electro-pneumatic action used electric solenoids to operate the pipe valves, and solenoids and pistons to control and operate the various stop tabs, controls, keys and pedals on the console. This action allowed the console to be physically detached from the organ. All signals from the console were transmitted by an electric cable to an electro-pneumatic relay, and from there to the pipes and effects in the organ chambers.

Another feature of theatre organs is the addition of chromatic, or tuned percussions. Hope-Jones added pneumatically and electrically operated instruments such as xylophones, wood harps, chimes, sleigh bells, chrysoglotts and glockenspiels to reproduce the orchestral versions of these instruments.

Wurlitzer added other effects, such as drums, cymbals, wood blocks and other non-chromatic percussions and effects to allow the theatre organ to accompany silent movies. Examples of sound effects included car horns and flings. 

A traditional organ console was not adequate to control a theatre organ, as the large number of draw knobs required made the console so huge an organist could not possibly reach all of them while playing. Thus, the horseshoe console was born. Based on a curved French console design and using stop tabs instead of drawknobs, the horseshoe console now allowed the organist to reach any stop or control while playing any piece of music, eliminating the need to move around awkwardly on the bench. The smaller stop tabs also permitted the addition of many more stops on the console than could be added on a traditional console.

== New and old organs ==
So-called &quot;new&quot; organs have been recently built, mainly from parts of other theatre organs, with construction of new pipework, windchests and consoles.

Some of these refurbished organs have had their original electro-pneumatic relays replaced with electronic or computerized relays and modern, electronic consoles.

<text>Kenneth Anderson Kitchen (1932 – 6 February 2025) was a British biblical scholar, Ancient Near Eastern historian, and Personal and Brunner Professor Emeritus of Egyptology and honorary research fellow at the School of Archaeology, Classics and Egyptology, University of Liverpool, England. He specialised in the ancient Egyptian Ramesside Period (i.e., Dynasties 19-20), and the Third Intermediate Period of Egypt, as well as ancient Egyptian chronology, having written over 250 books and journal articles on these and other subjects since the mid-1950s. He has been described by &quot;The Times&quot; as &quot;the very architect of Egyptian chronology&quot;.

==Background==
Kitchen was born in Aberdeen, Scotland in 1932. He died on 6 February 2025 as an unmarried bachelor.

==Third Intermediate Period==
His 1972 book is &quot;The Third Intermediate Period in Egypt (1100–650 BC)&quot;. It noted a hitherto unknown period of coregency between Psusennes I with Amenemope and Osorkon III with Takelot III, and established that Shebitku of the 25th Dynasty was already king of Egypt by 702 BC, among other revelations. It stated that Takelot II succeeded Osorkon II at Tanis, whereas most Egyptologists today accept it was Shoshenq III. Secondly, the book presented King Shoshenq II as the High Priest of Amun Shoshenq C, a son of Osorkon I who predeceased his father. However, this interpretation is weakened by the fact that no objects from Shoshenq II&#x27;s intact burial at Tanis bears Osorkon I&#x27;s name. Finally, contra Kitchen, most Egyptologists today such as Rolf Krauss, Aidan Dodson and Jürgen von Beckerath accept David Aston&#x27;s argument that the Crown Prince Osorkon B, Takelot II&#x27;s son, assumed power as Osorkon III, a king of the &#x27;Theban Twenty-Third Dynasty&#x27; in Upper Egypt.

==Ramesside period==
Kitchen was regarded as one of the foremost scholars on the Ramesside period (1196–1070 a.C., Dynasty XIX and XX) of the New Kingdom; he published a well-respected book on Ramesses II in 1982 titled &quot;Pharaoh Triumphant: The Life and Times of Ramesses II, King of Egypt&quot;. Kitchen was a scholar who advocated a high view of the Old Testament and its inherent historicity. His 2003 book &quot;On the Reliability of the Old Testament&quot; documents several clear or indirect allusions to King David&#x27;s status as the founder of Ancient Israel, based on passages in the Tel Dan (&#x27;House of David&#x27;) and Mesha stelas as well as in Shoshenq I&#x27;s Karnak list.

Kitchen strongly criticized the new chronology views of David Rohl, who posits that the Biblical Shishak who invaded the Kingdom of Judah in 925 BC was actually Ramesses II rather than Shoshenq I and argues that the 21st and 22nd Dynasties of Egypt were contemporary with one another due to the absence of Dynasty 21 Apis Bull stele in the Serapeum. Kitchen observed that the word Shishak is closer philologically to Shoshenq I and that this Pharaoh records in his monuments at Thebes that he campaigned actively against Ancient Israel and Judah.

==Biblical scholarship==
Kitchen was a biblical maximalist and has published frequently defending the historicity of the Old Testament. He was an outspoken critic of the documentary hypothesis, publishing various articles and books upholding his viewpoint, arguing that the Bible is historically reliable. Kitchen has also published articles for the &quot;Biblical Archaeology Review&quot; including, &#x27;Where Did Solomon&#x27;s Gold Go?&#x27; (1989), &#x27;Shishak&#x27;s Military Campaign in Israel Confirmed&#x27; (1989), &#x27;The Patriarchal Age: Myth or History?&#x27; (1995) and &#x27;How we know when Solomon ruled&#x27; (2001).

<text>Edward Aylesworth Perry (March 15, 1831October 15, 1889) was a general under Robert E. Lee during the American Civil War and the 14th Governor of Florida.

==Early life==
He was a descendant of Arthur Perry, one of the earliest settlers of New England. His parents were farmers, Asa and Philura Perry, and he was the fourth of five children.

Born in Richmond, Massachusetts, Perry briefly attended Yale University before moving to Greenville, Alabama in 1853. In Alabama, he taught and studied law with Hilary Herbert, who later served as a colonel in the Confederate States Army, a U.S. congressman from Alabama, and Secretary of the Navy under President Grover Cleveland. Perry soon moved to Pensacola, Florida, and passed the bar exam. He served as a judge for Escambia County, Florida, from 1857 through 1861. He married Wathen Virginia Taylor of Greenville, Alabama, on February 1, 1859, the daughter of Hubbard Bonner Taylor and Marjorie Catherine Herbert Taylor, and a granddaughter of Dr. Hilary Herbert, one of the earliest settlers of Butler County, Alabama. Mrs. Perry was also a cousin of the Hilary A. Herbert, with whom he studied law in Alabama.

==American Civil War==
During the Civil War, Perry fought with distinction for the Confederacy, rising from the rank of private to brigadier general. In May 1861, he enlisted in the &quot;Pensacola Rifle Rangers&quot;, which was later designated Company A of the 2nd Florida Infantry, and was elected as its captain. A year later, he was elected colonel of the regiment.

In June 1862, he was wounded during the fight at Glendale during the Peninsula Campaign and furloughed. On August 28, 1862, Perry was appointed as a brigadier general in the Provisional Army of the Confederacy and returned to active duty the following year. He led an all-Florida brigade in the Army of Northern Virginia at the Battle of Chancellorsville, but was stricken with typhoid fever and missed the Gettysburg Campaign, where Col. David Lang commanded Perry&#x27;s Brigade.

Perry returned to the Army of Northern Virginia to command his brigade for the Bristoe Campaign in the fall of 1863. He was severely wounded in the fighting at the Wilderness on May 6, 1864. He briefly returned to the trenches during the Siege of Petersburg, but had not recovered sufficiently for active duty. Hence, he was sent to Alabama for the duration of the war, serving on reserve duty in the Confederate Invalid Corps.

==Aftermath; Governor==
He returned to Florida and became a prominent lawyer and Democratic state politician. Elected governor in 1884, he assumed office on January 7, 1885. During his administration, Florida adopted a new constitution and established the state board of education. He was an outspoken opponent of &quot;carpetbaggers&quot;.

Perry was active in the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry. His antebellum home became the Scottish Rite Temple in downtown Pensacola.

The Confederate Monument on Palafox Street bears a plaque honoring his wife, Wathen Virginia Taylor Perry, who raised the funds for its erection. After leaving office on January 8, 1889, he returned home to Pensacola. In later years, the property was sold for $2.53 million to the adjacent First United Methodist Church, and fund raising for renovations are in place.

He died suddenly of a stroke while visiting Kerrville, Texas, in 1889, aged 58. He and his wife are buried in St. John&#x27;s Cemetery in Pensacola, Florida.

<text>HMS &quot;Lion&quot; was a 64-gun third-rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy, of the , launched on 3 September 1777 at Portsmouth Dockyard.

==Career==
===American Revolutionary War===
She fought at the Battle of Grenada under Captain William Cornwallis on 6 July 1779, where she was badly damaged and forced to run downwind to Jamaica. She remained on the Jamaica station for the next year.

On 20 March 1780, &quot;Lion&quot; fought an action in company with two other ships against a French convoy off Monte Cristi, Dominican Republic, protected by Toussaint-Guillaume Picquet de la Motte&#x27;s squadron. The &quot;Lion&quot; and Cornwallis, then returned Nelson to England. On 20 June, a second action by Cornwallis, took place near Bermuda, when Cornwallis&#x27; &quot;Lion&quot;, accompanied by five other ships of the line, met another French convoy carrying six thousand troops for Rhode Island, and protected by Charles-Henri-Louis d&#x27;Arsac de Ternay. The French were too strong for Cornwallis&#x27;s squadron, but were content to continue with their mission instead of attacking the smaller British force.

===French Revolutionary Wars===
In late July 1793, under the command of Captain Sir Erasmus Gower, &quot;Lion&quot; escorted the East Indiaman , which carried the British ambassador Lord Macartney on his way to visit the Qianlong Emperor of China (the Macartney embassy).
On their way they stopped at New Amsterdam Island or Île Amsterdam. There they found a gang of seal fur hunters under the command of Pierre François Péron. Later, &quot;Lion&quot; captured the French ship &quot;Emélie&quot;, the vessel that had landed the sealers. Deprived of the ship that had landed them, Péron and his men spent some 40 months marooned on the island until Captain Thomas Hadley, in , rescued them in late 1795 and took them to Port Jackson.

Between 1792 and 1794 she carried Lord George Macartney on a special embassy to China. The embassy proceeded to the Bohai Gulf, off the Hai River. The ambassador and his party were conveyed up river by light craft to Tianjin before proceeding by land to Beijing On reaching Tianjin, Macartney sent orders to &quot;Lion&quot; to proceed to Japan, but because of sickness among the crew she was unable to do so. The embassy rejoined &quot;Lion&quot; at Canton in December 1793. The ship&#x27;s journal from this voyage is in the library of Cornell University.
In 1796, she visited Cape Town; in 1797, her crew were among those who joined the Mutiny at the Nore. In 1798, now under the command of Sir Manley Dixon, &quot;Lion&quot; fought a squadron of Spanish frigates at the action of 15 July 1798 and captured .

She then took part in the siege of Malta, and with and captured the French 80-gun ship &quot;Guillaume Tell&quot; as she tried to escape from the blockade (&quot;Guillaume Tell&quot; was subsequently bought into the Royal Navy as ).

In July 1807 in the Malacca Strait she successfully protected from the French frigate , without an engagement, a convoy homeward bound from China.

On 27 December 1807 &quot;Lion&quot; captured the French privateer lugger &quot;Reciprocité&quot; off Beachy Head. She was from Dieppe, had a crew of 45 men, and was armed with 14 guns. &quot;Lion&quot; sent her into the Downs.

In 1811, under the command of Captain Henry Heathcote, &quot;Lion&quot; was one of a large fleet of ships involved in the capture of Java from Dutch forces.

On 26 January 1812 Commander Henderson Bain of became acting captain of &quot;Lion&quot;. Bain returned to command of &quot;Harpy&quot; a few weeks before he received promotion to post captain 6 April 1813.

&quot;Lion&quot; was converted to a sheer hulk in September 1816, following the end of the Napoleonic wars.

==Fate==
&quot;Lion&quot; was sold to be broken up at Chatham on 30 November 1837.

<doc id="1150894" wikidata="Q1716206" url="?curid=1150894" title="Victim blaming">
<text>Victim blaming occurs when the victim of a crime or any wrongful act is held entirely or partially at fault for the harm that befell them. There is historical and current prejudice against the victims of domestic violence and sex crimes, such as the greater tendency to blame victims of rape than victims of robbery if victims and perpetrators knew each other prior to the commission of the crime. The Gay Panic Defense has been characterized as a form of victim blaming. 

==Coining of the phrase==
Psychologist William Ryan coined the phrase &quot;blaming the victim&quot; in his 1971 book of that title. In the book, Ryan described victim blaming as an ideology used to justify racism and social injustice against black people in the United States. Ryan wrote the book to refute Daniel Patrick Moynihan&#x27;s 1965 work &quot;The Negro Family: The Case for National Action&quot; (usually simply referred to as the Moynihan Report).

Moynihan had concluded that three centuries of oppression of black people, and in particular with what he calls the uniquely cruel structure of American slavery as opposed to its Latin American counterparts, had created a long series of chaotic disruptions within the black family structure which, at the time of the report, manifested itself in high rates of unwed births, absent fathers, and single mother households in black families. Moynihan then correlated these familial outcomes, which he considered undesirable, to the relatively poorer rates of employment, educational achievement, and financial success found among the black population. The black family structure is also being affected by media through the children. The Black family is usually portrayed as gang affiliated, single-parent or very violent. Aggression and violent behavior in children has been linked to television programming. Moynihan advocated the implementation of government programs designed to strengthen the black nuclear family.

Ryan objected that Moynihan then located the proximate cause of the plight of black Americans in the prevalence of a family structure in which the father was often sporadically, if at all, present, and the mother was often dependent on government aid to feed, clothe, and provide medical care for her children. Ryan&#x27;s critique cast the Moynihan theories as attempts to divert responsibility for poverty from social structural factors to the behaviors and cultural patterns of the poor.

==History==
Although Ryan popularized the phrase, other scholars had identified the phenomenon of victim blaming.
In 1947 Theodor W. Adorno defined what would be later called &quot;blaming the victim,&quot; as &quot;one of the most sinister features of the Fascist character&quot;.

Shortly thereafter Adorno and three other professors at the University of California, Berkeley formulated their influential and highly debated &quot;F-scale&quot; (F for fascist), published in &quot;The Authoritarian Personality&quot; (1950), which included among the fascist traits of the scale the &quot;contempt for everything discriminated against or weak.&quot; A typical expression of victim blaming is the &quot;asking for it&quot; idiom, e.g. &quot;she was asking for it&quot; said of a victim of violence or sexual assault.

The just-world fallacy is proposed as one explanation for why people blame victims: rejecting the uncomfortable idea that bad things happen to people randomly and undeservedly results in a false belief that victims must have done something to deserve what happened to them. This also implies that people can avoid being victims by behaving correctly. Though an ancient idea, it became the subject of modern social psychology in the 1960s beginning with Melvin J. Lerner.

==Secondary victimization of sexual and other assault victims==

Secondary victimization is the re-traumatization of a victim through the responses of individuals and institutions. Types of secondary victimization include victim blaming, disbelieving the victim&#x27;s story, minimizing the severity of the attack, and inappropriate post-assault treatment by medical personnel or other organizations. Secondary victimization is especially common in cases of drug-facilitated, acquaintance, military sexual trauma and statutory rape.

Sexual assault victims may experience stigmatization based on rape myths. A female rape victim is especially stigmatized in patrilineal cultures with strong customs and taboos regarding sex and sexuality. For example, a society may view a female rape victim (especially one who was previously a virgin) as &quot;damaged&quot;. Victims in these cultures may suffer isolation, physical and psychological abuse, slut-shaming, public humiliation rituals, be disowned by friends and family, be prohibited from marrying, be divorced if already married, or even be killed. Even in many developed countries, including some sectors of United States society, misogyny remains culturally ingrained. A 2009 study in the Journal of Interpersonal Violence of male victims of sexual assault concludes that male rape victim blaming is usually done so because of social constructs of masculinity. Some effects of these kind of rape cases include a loss of masculinity, confusion about their sexual orientation, and a sense of failure in behaving as men should. Victims of an unwanted sexual encounter usually develop psychological problems such as depression or sexual violence specific PTSD known as rape trauma syndrome.

One example of an allegation against female victims of sexual assault is that they were wearing provocative clothing and thus actively trying to seduce a sexual partner. Such accusations against victims stem from the assumption that sexually revealing clothing conveys consent for sexual actions, irrespective of willful verbal consent. Research has yet to prove that attire is a significant causal factor in determining who is assaulted.

Victim blaming is also exemplified when a victim of sexual assault is found at fault for &quot;performing actions which reduce their ability to resist or refuse consent&quot;, such as consuming alcohol. Victim advocacy groups and medical professionals are educating young adults on the definition of consent, and the importance of refraining from victim blaming. Most institutions have adopted the concept of affirmative consent and that refraining from sexual activity while under the influence is the safest choice.

In efforts to discredit alleged sexual assault victims in court, a defense attorney may &quot;delve into an accuser&#x27;s personal history&quot;, a common practice that also has the purposeful effect of making the victim so uncomfortable they choose not to proceed. This attack on character, especially one pointing out promiscuity, makes the argument that women who lead &quot;high risk&quot; lifestyles (promiscuity, drug use) are not real victims of rape. Research on the acceptance of rape myths has shown that sexism is a significant factor in the blaming of female rape victims.

===Ideal victim===

An ideal victim is one who is afforded the status of victimhood due to unavoidable circumstances that put the individual at a disadvantage. One can apply this theory to any crime including and especially sexual assault. Nils Christie, a Norwegian criminology professor, has been theorizing about the concept of the ideal victim since the 1980s. In his research he gives two examples, one of an old woman who is attacked on her way home from visiting her family and the other of a man who is attacked at a bar by someone he knew. He describes the old woman as an ideal victim because she could not avoid being in the location that she was, she did not know her attacker, and she could not fight off her attacker. The man, however, could have avoided being at a bar, knew his attacker, and should have been able to fight off his attacker, being younger and a man.

When applying the ideal victim theory to sexual assault victims, often judicial proceedings define an ideal victim as one who resists their attacker and exercises caution in risky situations, despite law reforms to extinguish these fallacious requirements. When victims are not ideal they are at risk for being blamed for their attack because they are not considered real victims of rape.

A victim who is not considered an ideal, or real victim, is one who leads a &quot;high risk&quot; lifestyle, partaking in drugs or alcohol, or is perceived as promiscuous. A victim who intimately knows their attacker is also not considered an ideal victim. An example of a sexual assault victim who is not ideal is a prostitute because they lead a high risk lifestyle. The perception is that these behaviors discount the credibility of a sexual assault victim&#x27;s claim or that the behaviors and associations create the mistaken assumption of consent. Some of or all of the blame of the assault is then placed on these victims, and so they are not worthy of having their case presented in court. These perceptions persist in court rulings despite a shift in laws favoring affirmative consent – meaning that the participants in a sexual activity give a verbal affirmation rather than one participant who neither answers negatively nor positively. In other words, affirmative consent is yes means yes, no means no and no verbal answer also means no.

In addition to an ideal victim, there must be an ideal perpetrator for a crime to be considered ideal. The ideal attacker does not know their victim and is a completely non-sympathetic figure- one who is considered sub-human, an individual lacking morals. An attacker that knows their victim is not considered an ideal attacker, nor is someone who seems morally ordinary. Cases of intimate partner violence are not considered ideal because the victim knows their attacker. Husbands and wives are not ideal victims or perpetrators because they are intimately familiar with each other.

==Global situation==
Many different cultures across the globe have formulated different degrees of victim blaming for different scenarios such as rape, hate crimes, and domestic abuse. Victim blaming is common around the world, especially in cultures where it is socially acceptable and advised to treat certain groups of people as lesser. For example, in Somalia victims of sexual abuse consistently endure social ostracization and harassment. One specific example is the kidnapping and rape of 14-year old Fatima: when the police arrived, both Fatima and her rapist were arrested. While they did not detain the offender for long, the officers held Fatima captive for a month and a prison guard continually raped her during that time.

In February 2016, the organisations International Alert and UNICEF published a study revealing that girls and women released from captivity by Nigeria&#x27;s insurgency group Boko Haram often face rejection by their communities and families. Their children born of sexual violence faced even more discrimination.

Acid attacks on South Asian women, when people throw acid on women in an attempt to punish them for their perceived wrongdoings, are another example of victim-blaming. For instance, in New Delhi in 2005, a group of men threw acid on a 16-year-old girl because they believed she provoked the advances of a man. In Chinese culture, victim blaming is often associated with the crime of rape, as women are expected to resist rape using physical force. Thus, if rape occurs, it is considered to be at least partly the woman&#x27;s fault and her virtue is inevitably called into question. Religious norms can be part of victim blaming.
In Western culture victim blaming has been largely recognized as a problematic way to view a situation, however this does not exempt Westerners from being guilty of the action. A recent example of Western victim blaming would be a civil trial held in 2013 where the Los Angeles School District blamed a 14-year-old girl for the sexual abuse she endured from her middle school teacher. The District&#x27;s lawyer argued that the minor was responsible for the prevention of the abuse, putting the entire fault on the victim and exempting the perpetrator of any responsibility. Despite his efforts to convince the court that the victim must be blamed, the ruling stated that no minor student that has been sexually assaulted by his or her teacher is responsible for the prevention of that sexual assault.

==Opposing views==
Roy Baumeister, a social and personality psychologist, argued that blaming the victim is not necessarily always fallacious. He argued that showing the victim&#x27;s possible role in an altercation may be contrary to typical explanations of violence and cruelty, which incorporate the trope of the innocent victim. According to Baumeister, in the classic telling of &quot;the myth of pure evil,&quot; the innocent, well-meaning victims are going about their business when they are suddenly assaulted by wicked, malicious evildoers. Baumeister describes the situation as a possible distortion by both the perpetrator and the victim; the perpetrator may minimize the offense while the victim maximizes it, and so accounts of the incident should not be immediately taken as objective truths.

In context, Baumeister refers to the common behavior of the aggressor seeing themselves as more of the &quot;victim&quot; than the abused, justifying a horrific act by way of their &quot;moral complexity&quot;. This usually stems from an &quot;excessive sensitivity&quot; to insults, which he finds as a consistent pattern in abusive husbands. Essentially, the abuse the perpetrator administers is generally excessive, in comparison to the act/acts that they claim as to have provoked them.

==Scientific studies on victim blaming==
A 2017 review by Lennon et al. found that women who wear immodest or sexual clothing self-objectify themselves, which causes anxiety, unhappiness, body-dissatisfaction, and body shame. They found that &quot;[o]bservers link wearing sexy dress to violence including sexual coercion, sexual harassment, sexual assault, and unwelcome groping, touching, and grabbing.&quot; However, only two studies under their review directly investigated dress and real experience of sexual assault; neither study found a connection. Lennon et al. noted that few researchers had studied the influence of actual sexual behavior on potential relationships between sexual violence and dress. One exception was a 2007 study of flashing at college homecoming events, in which Annette Lynch found that &quot;a dress style which might be considered not provocative becomes provocative when the behavior of the woman wearing it becomes suggestive (i.e., when she flashes)&quot; and women who attended homecoming matches were often groped and coerced into exposing themselves.

==Horseshoe theory and nonpolarized views==
Some scholars make the argument that some of the attitudes that are described as victim blaming and the victimologies that are said to counteract them are both extreme and similar to each other, an example of the horseshoe theory. For instance, they argue that the claim that &quot;women wearing provocative clothing cause rape&quot; is as demeaning to men as it is to women as depicting men as incapable of controlling their sexual desire is misandrist and denies men full agency, while also arguing that the generalization that women do not lie about rape (or any generalization about women not doing some things because of their gender) is misogynist by its implicit assumption that women act by simple default action modes which is incompatible with full agency. These scholars argue that it is important to impartially assess the evidence in each criminal trial individually and that any generalization based on statistics would change the situation from one where the control of evidence makes false reporting difficult to one where lack of individual control of the alleged crime makes it easier to file false reports and that statistics collected in the former situation would not be possible to apply to the latter situation. While the scholars make a distinction between actual victim blaming and rule by law that they consider to be falsely lumped with victim blaming in radical feminist rhetorics, they also advocate more protection from ad hominem questions to alleged victims about past life history and that the questions should focus on what is relevant for the specific alleged crime. They also cite examples that they consider to be cases of the horseshoe theory applied to the question of victim blaming. This includes cases in which psychologists who have testified on behalf of the prosecution in trials in which breast size have been used as a measure of female age when classifying pornographic cartoons as child pornography and been praised by feminists for it, and later the same psychologists have used the same psychological arguments when testifying on behalf of the defense in statutory rape cases and getting the defendant acquitted by claiming that the victim&#x27;s breasts looked like those of an adult woman (considered by these scholars to be victim blaming based on appearance) and been praised by men&#x27;s rights groups for it. It also includes the possibility that biopsychiatric models that consider sexual criminality hereditary and that are advocated by some feminists may blame victims of incest abuse for being genetically related to their abusers and thereby dissuading them from reporting abuse.

Other analysts of victim blaming discourse who neither support most of the phenomena that are described as victim blaming nor most of the measures that are marketed as countermeasures against such point at the existence of other ways of discovering and punishing crimes with victims besides the victim reporting the crime. Not only are there police patrols and possible eyewitnesses, but these analysts also argue that neighbors can overhear and report crimes that take place within the house such as domestic violence. For that reason along with the possibility of many witnesses turning up over time if the crime is ongoing long term as domestic abuse is generally said to be which would make some of the witnesses likely to be considered believable, analysts of this camp of thought argue that the main problem that prevent crimes from being successfully prosecuted is offender profiling that disbelieve the capacity and/or probability of many criminals to commit the crime, rather than disbelief or blaming of victim reports. These analysts cite international comparisons that show that the percentage of male on female cases in the statistics of successfully prosecuted domestic violence is not higher in countries that apply gender feminist theories about patriarchal structures than in countries that apply supposedly antifeminist evolutionary psychology profiling of sex differences in aggressiveness, impulse control and empathy, arguing that the criminal justice system prioritizing cases in which they believe the suspect most likely to be guilty makes evolutionary psychology at least as responsible as gender feminism for leaving domestic violence cases with female offenders undiscovered no matter if the victim is male or female. The analysts argue that many problems that are often attributed to victim blaming are instead due to offender profiling, and suggest randomized investigations instead of psychological profiling of suspected offenders.

==Examples==
A myth holds that Jews went passively &quot;like sheep to the slaughter&quot; during The Holocaust, which is considered by many writers, including Emil Fackenheim, to be a form of victim blaming. Secondary antisemitism is a type of antisemitism caused by non-Jewish Europeans&#x27; attempts to shift blame for the Holocaust onto the Jews, often summed up by the claim that &quot;The Germans will never forgive the Jews for Auschwitz.&quot;

In recent years, the issue of victim blaming has gained notoriety and become widely recognized in the media, particularly in the context of feminism, as women have often been blamed for behaving in ways that are claimed to encourage harassment.

===Australia===
Leigh Leigh, born Leigh Rennea Mears, was a 14-year-old girl from Fern Bay, New South Wales, Australia, who was murdered on 3 November 1989. While attending a 16-year-old boy&#x27;s birthday party at Stockton Beach, Leigh was assaulted by a group of boys after she returned distressed from a sexual encounter on the beach that a reviewing judge later called non-consensual. After being kicked and spat on by the group, Leigh left the party. Her naked body was found in the sand dunes nearby the following morning, with severe genital damage and a crushed skull. Leigh&#x27;s murder received considerable attention in the media. Initially focusing on her sexual assault and murder, media attention later concentrated more on the lack of parental supervision and the drugs and alcohol at the party, and on Leigh&#x27;s sexuality. The media coverage of the murder has been cited as an example of victim blaming.

In 1997, the Sydney Daily Telegraph, a conservative tabloid opposition to the Sydney Morning Herald and The Australian, interviewed anti-LGBT+ school bullies who claimed their gay student victims &#x27;were asking for it&#x27; with their camp behaviour, insinuating that they were bringing upon themselves mistreatment at the hands of students and staff at their schools. The Telegraph devoted its entire front page to the Christopher Tsakalos lawsuit, with the imperative headline &quot;Walk Like a Man&quot;. Reporters from the Daily Telegraph also pursued the Tsakalos story in an article titled &quot;Gay boy asked for it — students&quot; (Trute &amp; Angelo, 1997).

Former Australian Senator Fraser Anning was sharply criticised for his comments about the Christchurch mosque shootings in New Zealand, in which 51 Muslim worshippers were killed. He claimed that immigration of &quot;Muslim fanatics&quot; led to the attacks, and that &quot;while Muslims may have been victims today, usually they are the perpetrators&quot;. Anning also stated that the massacre &quot;highlights...the growing fear within our community...of the increasing Muslim presence&quot;. The comments received international attention and were overwhelmingly criticised as being insensitive and racist, and sympathetic to the views of the perpetrator.

In some Common Law jurisdictions such as the UK, Canada, and several Australian states, the defense of provocation is only available against a charge of murder and only acts to reduce the conviction to manslaughter. Until recently criminal courts have regarded sexual infidelity such as adultery and fornication as sufficiently grave provocation as to provide a warrant, indeed a &#x27;moral warrant&#x27;, for reducing murder to manslaughter. While the warrant has spilled over into diminished responsibility defences, wounding, grievous bodily harm and attempted murder cases, it is provocation cases that have provided the precedents enshrining a defendant&#x27;s impassioned homicidal sexual infidelity tale as excusatory. Periodically, judges and law reformers attempt to rein in provocation defences, most recently in England and Wales where provocation has been replaced by a loss of control defence that, most controversially, specifically excludes sexual infidelity as a trigger for loss of control.

===Germany===
The New Year&#x27;s Eve sexual assaults in Germany took place in 2016 where large groups of men assaulted multiple women, mayor of Cologne Henriette Reker came under heavy criticism, as her response appeared to blame the victims. She called for women to follow a &quot;code of conduct,&quot; including staying at an &quot;arm&#x27;s length&quot; from strangers. By the evening of 5 January, &quot;#einearmlänge&quot; (&quot;an arm&#x27;s length&quot;) became one of Germany&#x27;s top-trending hashtags on Twitter. Reker called a crisis meeting with the police in response to the incidents. Reker called it &quot;completely improper&quot; to link the perpetrators to refugees.

===Italy===
Coverage of the 2016 Murder of Ashley Ann Olsen, an American murdered in Italy during a sexual encounter with a Senegalese immigrant, focused on the victim blaming in cross-cultural encounters.

===India===
In a case that attracted worldwide coverage, when a woman was raped and killed in Delhi in December 2012, some Indian government officials and political leaders blamed the victim for various things, mostly based on conjecture. Many of the people involved later apologized.

In August 2017, the hashtag #AintNoCinderella trended on social media India, in response to a high-profile instance of victim-blaming. After Varnika Kundu was stalked and harassed by two men on her way home late at night, Bharatiya Janata Party Vice President Ramveer Bhatti addressed the incident with a claim that Kundu was somehow at fault for being out late by herself. Social media users took to Twitter and Instagram to challenge the claim that women should not be out late at night, and if they are, they are somehow &quot;asking for it&quot;. Hundreds of women shared photos of themselves staying out past midnight, dressing boldly, and behaving in (harmless) ways that tend to be condemned in old-fashioned, anti-feminist ideology.

===Jordan===
Women in Jordan have been victim-blamed for sexual harassment for not wearing a hijab.

===United States===
In 1938 the Madera Tribune ran the front-page headline &quot;Mother Blames her Daughter Equally with Man for Murder&quot; in describing the stabbing death of 19-year-old Leona Vlught in Oakland. The victim&#x27;s mother&#x27;s &quot;resentment against the boy who killed her&quot; was said to be softened upon learning that her daughter drank alcohol and &quot;went on a petting party when she was supposed to be spending the night with girl friends&quot;. The perpetrator Rodney Greig was later convicted of the crime and executed in the San Quentin gas chamber.

In a 2010 case, an 11-year-old female rape victim who suffered repeated gang rapes in Cleveland, Texas, was accused by a defense attorney of being a seductress who lured men to their doom. &quot;Like the spider and the fly. Wasn&#x27;t she saying, &#x27;Come into my parlor&#x27;, said the spider to the fly?&quot;, he asked a witness. The &quot;New York Times&quot; ran an article uncritically reporting on the way many in the community blamed the victim, for which the newspaper later apologized.

== Urban planning and road safety ==
Cars not only are responsible for the majority of accidents but also cause more severe ones. However, urban design often continues to favor car circulation, impeding pedestrian and cyclist mobility and placing blame on the victims for those accidents.

As the majority of traffic accident victims are pedestrians and cyclists, measures to calm traffic and protect and facilitate the mobility of the most vulnerable should be implemented to avoid shifting responsibility.

<text>A radioimmunoassay (RIA) is an immunoassay that uses radiolabeled molecules in a stepwise formation of immune complexes. A RIA is a very sensitive in vitro assay technique used to measure concentrations of substances, usually measuring antigen concentrations (for example, hormone levels in blood) by use of antibodies.

The RIA technique is extremely sensitive and extremely specific, and although it requires specialized equipment, it remains among the least expensive methods to perform such measurements. It requires special precautions and licensing, since radioactive substances are used.

In contrast, an immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) is an immunoassay that uses radiolabeled molecules but in an immediate rather than stepwise way.

A radioallergosorbent test (RAST) is an example of radioimmunoassay. It is used to detect the causative allergen for an allergy.

==Method==
Classically, to perform a radioimmunoassay, a known quantity of an antigen is made radioactive, frequently by labeling it with gamma-radioactive isotopes of iodine, such as 125-I, or tritium attached to tyrosine. This radiolabeled antigen is then mixed with a known amount of antibody for that antigen, and as a result, the two specifically bind to one another. Then, a sample of serum from a patient containing an unknown quantity of that same antigen is added. This causes the unlabeled (or &quot;cold&quot;) antigen from the serum to compete with the radiolabeled antigen (&quot;hot&quot;) for antibody binding sites. As the concentration of &quot;cold&quot; antigen is increased, more of it binds to the antibody, displacing the radiolabeled variant, and reducing the ratio of antibody-bound radiolabeled antigen to free radiolabeled antigen. The bound antigens are then separated and the radioactivity of the free(unbound) antigen remaining in the supernatant is measured using a gamma counter. This value is then compared to a standardised calibration curve to work out the concentration of the unlabelled antigen in the patient serum sample. RIAs can detect a few picograms of analyte in an experimental tubes if using antibodies of high affinity.

This method can be used for any biological molecule in principle and is not restricted to serum antigens, nor is it required to use the indirect method of measuring the free antigen instead of directly measuring the captured antigen. For example, if it is undesirable or not possible to radiolabel the antigen or target molecule of interest, a RIA can be done if two different antibodies that recognize the target are available and the target is large enough (e.g., a protein) to present multiple epitopes to the antibodies. One antibody would be radiolabeled as above while the other would remain unmodified. The RIA would begin with the &quot;cold&quot; unlabeled antibody being allowed to interact and bind to the target molecule in solution. Preferably, this unlabeled antibody is immobilized in some way, such as coupled to an agarose bead, coated to a surface, etc. Next, the &quot;hot&quot; radiolabeled antibody is allowed to interact with the first antibody-target molecule complex. After extensive washing, the direct amount of radioactive antibody bound is measured and the amount of target molecule quantified by comparing it to a reference amount assayed at the same time. This method is similar in principle to the non-radioactive sandwich ELISA method.

==History==

This method was developed by Solomon Berson and Rosalyn Sussman Yalow at the Veterans Administration Hospital in the Bronx, New York. This revolutionary development earned Dr. Yalow the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1977, the second woman ever to win it. In her acceptance speech, Dr. Yalow said, &quot;The world cannot afford the loss of the talents of half its people if we are to solve the many problems which beset us.&quot; Yalow shared the Nobel Prize with Roger Guillemin, and Andrew Schally who earned the prize based on their research into &quot;the peptide hormone production of the brain&quot;.

<text>Eclipse (1 April 1764 – 26 February 1789) was an undefeated 18th-century British Thoroughbred racehorse who won 18 races, including 11 King&#x27;s Plates. He raced before the introduction of the British Classic Races, at a time when four-mile heat racing was the norm. He was considered the greatest racehorse of his time and the expression, &quot;Eclipse first, the rest nowhere&quot; entered the English vernacular as an expression of dominance.

After retiring from racing, he became a very successful sire, whose offspring included three Epsom Derby winners: Young Eclipse, Saltram and Serjeant. He was also a successful sire of sires, and his sire line has become dominant in the modern Thoroughbred worldwide through descendants such as Northern Dancer, Mr. Prospector and Sunday Silence.

==Breeding==
Eclipse was foaled during and named after the solar eclipse of 1764, at Keats Gore, near East Ilsley in Berkshire, not at the Cranbourne Lodge stud of his breeder, Prince William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, as many believe. This commonly recorded error is because of the prestige of Cranbourne Lodge. It was at Cranborne that his sire, the Jockey Club Plate winner Marske (by Squirt from The Ruby Mare) stood. His dam, Spilletta (foaled 1749), was by Regulus, who was by the Godolphin Arabian. Eclipse&#x27;s male-line great-grandsire was Bartlett&#x27;s Childers, and his male-line great-great-grandsire was Darley Arabian. Eclipse was a brother to the successful broodmare Proserpine. They were inbred to Snake in the fourth generation of their pedigree. After the death of Prince William in 1765, Eclipse was sold for 75 guineas to a sheep dealer from Smithfield, William Wildman.

Eclipse was a bright chestnut with a narrow blaze running down his face. He had a white stocking on his right hind leg. Eclipse was a big horse for his time, just over , and was an inch higher at the rump than at the withers. He was strong, sound and fast. He was sometimes criticized for having a large, unattractive head. His difficult temperament was well documented, and might have led to him being gelded. Instead he was turned over to a rough-rider, who worked him hard all day, and at night as well on poaching expeditions if the stories are to be believed. This treatment, rather than souring his disposition, settled Eclipse enough to allow him to be raced, although his jockeys never attempted to hold him.

==Racing career==
Before Eclipse&#x27;s first start at the age of five, a trial was arranged at Epsom (although the location has also been given as Mickleham). Bookmakers, trying to verify whether rumours about the horse were true, showed up but were too late — the trial had already been run. On their way home, though, they encountered an old woman who told them she had seen a horse with a white leg being chased by another, who she did not think would catch the horse with the white leg, even if he pursued him to the end of the world. Accordingly, when Eclipse started in his first race on 1769, a £50 Plate for horses who had never won, he was 4/1 on favourite. The race consisted of three heats of four miles each. Eclipse won easily.

After his second victory in a race in May 1769, Dennis O&#x27;Kelly purchased Eclipse in two stages. in June 1769 for 650 guineas, 50 percent in April 1770 for 1,100 guineas). Supposedly, at this time O&#x27;Kelly used the famous phrase &quot;Eclipse first and the rest nowhere&quot;, before making his bets for this race, although some sources have him saying this for the second heat of the horse&#x27;s debut. At that time, a horse that was more than 240 yards behind the lead was said to be &quot;nowhere&quot;. His jockey was John Oakley, supposedly the only jockey who could handle Eclipse&#x27;s temperamental manner and running style of holding his nose very close to the ground. Eclipse won the race and covered O&#x27;Kelly&#x27;s bet.

His toughest challenge was a match race versus the highly regarded Bucephalus in April 1770. Bucephalus was game, but Eclipse was the easy winner. In August, he took on top class horses Tortoise and Bellario in the Great Subscription Purse at York, but at odds of 20/1 on, routed both of them, being over a furlong in front after two miles, and winning in a canter.

Eclipse won 18 races, including 11 King&#x27;s Plates, supposedly without ever being fully extended and proving far superior to all competition. During his racing career, Eclipse ran over and walked 1,400 miles to race meetings across England.

Eclipse is still remembered in the phrase &quot;Eclipse first and the rest nowhere&quot;, snowcloned as &quot;[name of competitor] first and the rest nowhere&quot;, referring to any dominating victory. This phrase is occasionally seen in American print media (most often in newspaper sport sections) but is more common in Britain.

He is attested to have covered 83 feet per second at top speed, and covered 25 feet in a single stride.

==Race record==

In ten of the King&#x27;s Plates, Eclipse carried 12 st, or 168 pounds, the highest weight (by one pound) that was carried by a winner in England up to 1840.

==Stud record==
In 1771, Eclipse was retired to stud after a racing career of about 17 months due to lack of competition as nobody was betting on rival horses. Initially he stood at O&#x27;Kelly&#x27;s Clay Hill Stud, near Epsom (Surrey), for a fee of 10 guineas which rose rapidly to 25 and then to 50 guineas a mare. During 1788, he was relocated to Cannons Stud, Edgware (Middlesex).

Overall, Eclipse sired 344 winners of more than £158,000 (although the number varies with different reports, ranging from 325 to 400).

===Notable progeny===

&quot;s = stallion, m = mare&quot;

Eclipse&#x27;s daughters include Horatia, one of only twelve mares to produce two Derby winners: Archduke and Paris. She also produced two-time Doncaster Cup winner Stamford. Other daughters of Eclipse produced Derby winners John Bull and Skyscraper, and St. Leger winners Tartar, Remembrancer and Phoenomenon. Chanticleer, Haphazard, and Weasel are also noted as important runners out of Eclipse mares.

Eclipse was never the leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland, although he finished in second place 11 times, usually behind Herod. A book published in 1970 stated that the Royal Veterinary College had determined that nearly 80% of Thoroughbred racehorses had Eclipse in their pedigree. That percentage has naturally increased with time and the inevitable inbreeding in the Thoroughbred population. More recently it has been estimated that Eclipse is not only &quot;somewhere&quot; in the pedigree, but a ancestor of &quot;95pc of contemporary thoroughbreds&quot; or of &quot;nearly every living thoroughbred.&quot;

This modern dominance comes mainly through a sire line established by Potoooooooo, although King Fergus would also found another successful branch leading to Ribot. Potoooooooo&#x27;s grandson Waxy would lead the sire list in 1811, and Waxy&#x27;s grandson Birdcatcher in turn led the sire list in 1852 and 1856. Birdcatcher&#x27;s grandson Stockwell outdid them both, becoming leading sire seven times. Stockwell&#x27;s grandson Bend Or founded a line that led four generations later to Phalaris The Phalaris line has several branches, notably through Nearco and Native Dancer.

In Great Britain and Ireland, the Eclipse sire line includes modern leading sires such as Sadler&#x27;s Wells, Danehill and Galileo. In North America, leading sires in his line include Bold Ruler (sire of Secretariat), Mr. Prospector (ancestor of American Pharoah), Danzig, Storm Cat, A.P. Indy, Giant&#x27;s Causeway and Tapit. In Japan, Eclipse&#x27;s sire line includes leading sires Sunday Silence, King Kamehameha and Deep Impact, while in Australia leading sires from his line include Redoute&#x27;s Choice, Encosta De Lago and Fastnet Rock.

==Death==

Eclipse died due to an attack of colic on 1789, at the age . His skeleton is now housed at the Royal Veterinary College, Hertfordshire, in the Learning Resource Centre named after him, although it cannot be said for certain whether all the bones displayed are really from Eclipse. His hooves were made into inkstands, although the fact that there are at least five Eclipse-hoof inkstands casts some doubt on the authenticity of some. Hairs from his tail have also been used for decorations.

A necropsy on Eclipse by Charles Vial de Sainbel found that he had an abnormally large heart, weighing . This trait has been referred to in the context of thoroughbreds as the &quot;X Factor&quot; Theory. While the theory has yet to be proven, it has gained popularity due to the large hearts seen occasionally in his descendants, including Secretariat and Phar Lap.

==Honors and analysis==
The Eclipse Awards are American Thoroughbred horse-racing awards named after Eclipse. They honour the champions of the sport, and are sponsored by the National Thoroughbred Racing Association (NTRA), &quot;Daily Racing Form&quot; and the National Turf Writers Association, who select all finalists at the end of the year. The most prestigious of these Awards is the Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year title.

The Eclipse Stakes is a Group 1 flat race in the United Kingdom for three-year-olds and older run over a distance of 1¼ miles and 7 yards (2,018 metres) at Sandown Park.

Eclipse Press is the book-publishing division of Blood-Horse Publications, an international publishing house for top Thoroughbred and general equine magazines, books, videos, CD-ROMs and annual references.

Sheffield-based &quot;Eclipse&quot; tools, now part of Spear &amp; Jackson, took their name and their &quot;Eclipse first...&quot; slogan in 1909 from the horse.

The life story of Eclipse inspired the novel &quot;O&#x27;Kelly&#x27;s Eclipse&quot; by screenwriter Arthur Weiss.

Nicholas Clee&#x27;s &quot;Eclipse: The Story of the Rogue, the Madam and the Horse That Changed Racing&quot; is a biography of Eclipse and of the people connected to him, among them the gambler Dennis O&#x27;Kelly and the brothel madam Charlotte Hayes. Other biographies of Eclipse include Michael Church&#x27;s &quot;Eclipse: The Horse, The Race, The Awards&quot; (2000), and Theodore Cook&#x27;s 1907 book &quot;Eclipse and O&#x27;Kelly&quot;.

Contrary to popular belief, the Mitsubishi Eclipse was named for the racehorse, and not for the natural phenomenon.

==Pedigree==
At the time of Eclipse&#x27;s birth, stud records were maintained by the individual breeder with no central authority. Record-keeping was somewhat haphazard, compounded by spelling and transcription errors, and the fact that the names of mares were often not recorded. In 1791, James Weatherby and William Sydney Towers pieced together the General Stud Book, which is the source of the pedigree shown below. However, there are still several debated entries of interest to pedigree experts. Details of the issues can be found in Appendix 2 of Nicholas Clee&#x27;s book on Eclipse. The most notable issues are summarized below.

According to all official records, Eclipse&#x27;s sire was Marske (written as &#x27;Mask&#x27; in a 1764 entry in the Royal Stud Book). Marske was a moderately successful racehorse who had little early success in the breeding shed. His stud fee at the time of Eclipse&#x27;s conception was only half a guinea, though it subsequently grew to 30 guineas. During Eclipse&#x27;s lifetime, however, it was rumoured that his real sire was Shakespeare, who was a somewhat better racehorse than Marske and was said to resemble Eclipse more closely. According to a contemporary source, Eclipse&#x27;s dam was covered in 1763 first by Shakespeare and later by Marske, and paternity was based on Eclipse&#x27;s foaling date corresponding to the date of the second breeding session. Since both Marske and Shakespeare were great-grandsons of the Darley Arabian, Eclipse would still descend from that stallion.

Eclipse&#x27;s dam was Spilletta, who is shown as a bay in the General Stud Book but recorded as a chestnut in the personal records of her second owner, the Duke of Ancaster. There is again confusion over her breeding: The General Stud Book shows her sire as the undefeated Regulus (by the Godolphin Arabian) but a 1754 racing calendar shows her sire as Sedbury (by the Byerley Turk). Spilletta&#x27;s dam was Mother Western, whose paternity is subject to similar confusion between Scarborough Colt and Easby Snake. Spilletta raced only once, finishing last in a field of three. In her first eight years as a broodmare, Spilletta produced only one live foal. In 1760, she was bred to Markse for the first time with no issue. Three years later, they were mated again: Eclipse was the result.
&quot;Note: b. = Bay, ch. = Chestnut, br. = Brown&quot;

* Eclipse is inbred 3S x 4D to the mare &quot;Old Country Wench&quot;, meaning that she appears third generation on the sire side of his pedigree and fourth generation on the dam side of his pedigree.

*^ Eclipse is inbred 4S x 5D x 4D to the stallion Snake, meaning that he appears fourth generation on the sire side of his pedigree and fifth generation (via &quot;Old Country Wench)^ and fourth generation on the dam side of his pedigree.

<text>The Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA) is a private art and design college in Baltimore, Maryland. Founded in 1826 as the Maryland Institute for the Promotion of the Mechanic Arts, it is regarded as one of the oldest art colleges in the United States.

MICA is a member of the Association of Independent Colleges of Art and Design (AICAD), a consortium of US art schools. The college hosts pre-college, post-baccalaureate, continuing studies, Master of Fine Arts, and Bachelor of Fine Arts programs, as well as young peoples&#x27; studio art classes.

==History==
=== Maryland Institute for the Promotion of the Mechanic Arts ===

The Maryland Institute for the Promotion of the Mechanic Arts was established by prominent citizens of Baltimore, such as Fielding Lucas Jr. (founder of Lucas Brothers - office supply company), John H. B. Latrobe (lawyer, artist, author, civic leader), Hezekiah Niles (founder of national newspaper &quot;Niles Weekly Register&quot;) and Thomas Kelso.

Other leaders and officers in that first decade were William Stewart (president), George Warner, and Fielding Lucas Jr. (vice presidents), John Mowton (recording secretary), Dr. William Howard (corresponding secretary), as well as James H. Clarke and D.P. McCoy (managers), Solomon Etting (local merchant/political leader), Benjamin C. Howard, William Hubbard, William Meeter, William Roney, William F. Small, S.D. Walker, John D. Craig, Jacob Deems, William H. Freeman, Moses Hand, William Krebs, Robert Cary Long, Jr. (architect), Peter Leary, James Mosher, Henry Payson (founder of First Unitarian Church), P. K. Stapleton, James Sykes and P. B. Williams. The General Assembly of Maryland incorporated the institute in 1826, and starting in November of that year (Tuesday, November 7, 1826), exhibitions of articles of American manufacture were held in the &quot;Concert Hall&quot; on South Charles Street. A course of lectures on subjects connected with the mechanic arts was inaugurated, and a library of works on mechanics and the sciences was begun.

The school operated for a decade at &quot;The Athenaeum&quot; (the first of two structures to bear that name, a landmark for educational, social, cultural, civic and political affairs) at the southwest corner of East Lexington and St. Paul Streets facing the second Baltimore City/County Courthouse between North Calvert and St. Paul Streets. This first Athenaeum was destroyed by fire on February 7, 1835, along with all of its property and records. The fire was caused by a bank riot due to the financial panic following the collapse of several Baltimore banks.

In November 1847, Benjamin S. Benson and sixty-nine others (including many of the original founders of the former institute), issued a call for a meeting of those favorable to the formation of a mechanics&#x27; institute, which resulted in the reopening of the institute on January 12, 1848.

The first annual exhibition was held at &quot;Washington Hall&quot; in October 1848, followed by two more. The 1848 officers were John A. Rodgers – president, Adam Denmead – first vice president, James Milholland – second vice president, John B. Easter – recording secretary, and Samuel Boyd – treasurer. The institute was reincorporated by the state legislature at their December session in 1849 and was endowed by an annual appropriation from the State of Maryland of five hundred dollars. In 1849, the Board of Managers extended the usefulness and broadened the appeal of its programs to ordinary citizens by opening a School of Design and an additional Night School of Design was extended two years later in the new hall and building, under William Minifie (from the Faculty of the old Central High School of Baltimore) as principal of the reorganized institute. Classes resumed in rented space over the downtown Baltimore branch of the U.S. Post Office Department in the &quot;Merchants Exchange&quot;.

The City Council in 1850 passed an ordinance granting the institute permission to erect a new building over a reconstructed &quot;Centre Market&quot;, laying the cornerstone on March 13, 1851, with John H. B. Latrobe, and son of national architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe, (1764–1820).

In 1851, the institute moved to its own building, built above the old Centre Market on Market Place (formerly Harrison Street) between East Baltimore Street (to the north) and Water Street (to the south) alongside the western shore of the Jones Falls. Centre Market continued to be known in the city as &quot;Marsh Market&quot; after the former Harrison&#x27;s Marsh from colonial times. The building covered an entire block and had two stories built on a series of brick arches above the market, with two clock towers at each end. The second floor with the institute, housed classrooms, offices, shops and studios and one of the largest assembly halls/auditorium in the state.

During this period the institute added a School of Chemistry, thanks in part to a bequest from philanthropist George Peabody, (1795–1869), (for which the Peabody Institute and George Peabody Library is named) and B.&amp; O. Railroad president Thomas Swann, along with a School of Music. Night classes for Design are added for men who work during the day, but would like training in Architecture and Engineering at night. In 1854, a Day School of Design opened for women—one of the first US arts programs for women. In 1860, the Day School for men opened, and in 1870, the Day school became co-ed.
For 79 years the institute remained in the location above the Centre Market, and its &quot;Great Hall&quot;, large enough to accommodate 6,000, attracted many famous speakers and lecturers. It hosted events and shows related to the arts, and as one of Baltimore&#x27;s largest halls, it hosted important events to the city and the region. In 1852, it hosted both of the national political conventions to nominate presidential candidates Winfield Scott and his opponent Franklin Pierce (who was later elected 14th president of the United States).

During the American Civil War, the institute was briefly an armory for the Union and a hospital for soldiers wounded at the Battle of Antietam. On April 18, 1864, President Abraham Lincoln gave his famous speech known as the &quot;Baltimore Address&quot; (or &quot;Liberty Speech&quot;) during a Sanitary Fair held in the Great Hall to benefit Union soldiers and families.

On February 7–8, 1904, the Centre Market and the Maryland Institute burned down along with 1,500 other buildings in downtown Baltimore during the Great Baltimore Fire. Temporarily, classes moved to spaces above other covered municipal markets in the city, while construction was ongoing in two locations. Michael Jenkins donated the future site of the &quot;Main Building&quot; on Mount Royal Avenue near the new Bolton Hill neighborhood in the northwest, which opened in 1908. It was to house the School of Art and Design, and the City of Baltimore offered the old site and funding to rebuild the Centre Market as a location for the Drafting school and &quot;mechanical arts&quot;.

Upon opening, the Main building had spaces for pottery, metal working, wood carving, free-hand drafting and textile design, as well as a library, galleries and exhibition rooms. The galleries and exhibition rooms were important, because at the time of construction, Baltimore had no public art museum (institutions such as the Walters Art Gallery were not founded and opened for regular public viewing until 1909 and acquired by the city in 1934, and the Baltimore Museum of Art, in 1914).

In 1923, the institute&#x27;s galleries hosted the first known public showing of Henri Matisse&#x27;s work in the United States, brought from Europe by sisters Claribel and Etta Cone. In 1928, the new Centre Market building, now known as &quot;The Market Place&quot; building, offered a course in Aeronautics theory and drafting following the great excitement and increase in interest in the industry following Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s flight over the Atlantic Ocean to Paris.

=== Maryland Institute, College of Art ===

The institute legally changed its name to the &quot;Maryland Institute, College of Art&quot; in 1959, and the &quot;Market Place Building&quot; was razed to make room for the extension south of the Jones Falls Expressway (Interstate 83). The consolidation of MICA to the Mount Royal campus was furthered by the purchase of the Mount Royal Station, a former Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O) train station, in 1964. In 1968, MICA was forced to close due to the Baltimore riot of 1968, which broke out two days after the April 4 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in Memphis, Tennessee.

From 1972 to 1975, MICA was graced with the presence of artists and critics of the period, including composer John Cage, poet Allen Ginsberg, photographer Walker Evans, master printer Kenneth E. Tyler, painter Elaine de Kooning and art critic Clement Greenberg.

In the following years, MICA expanded along Mount Royal Avenue, adding the &quot;Fox Building&quot; in 1978, the &quot;College Center&quot; (now the &quot;Art Tech Center&quot;) in 1986, a renovation of the &quot;Main Building&quot; in 1990, &quot;The Commons&quot; (added 1992), &quot;Bunting Center&quot; (1998), the &quot;Meyerhoff House&quot; (2002), the &quot;Brown Center&quot; (2003), the &quot;Studio Center&quot; (2007) and &quot;The Gateway&quot; (2008). During that time, the college focused on increased interaction with the international art world—offering study abroad programs and residences in numerous countries around the world.

The school&#x27;s logo was redesigned in 2007 by Abbott Miller of Pentagram and is said to be a &quot;visual reference to the architecture&quot; found at the 1907 Main Building and 2003 Brown Center.

==Academics==
MICA offers various undergraduate degree, graduate degrees and certificates including B.F.A., M.A., M.A.T., M.B.A., M.F.A., M.P.S. Some of the degree programs are partially online or fully online. The school has accreditation from Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE) since 1967, and National Association of Schools of Art and Design (NASAD) since 1948.

In the Fall 2017 term, there were 433 part-time faculty and 178 full-time faculty, with an 8 to 1 student-to-faculty ratio.

==Students and alumni==

In Fall 2017, the total student enrollment was 2,128, with 1,824 undergraduate students and 379 graduate students hailing from across the US and foreign countries. The student body in Fall 2017 was 75% female and 25% male. MICA has an acceptance rate of 62% in 2017.

86% of B.F.A. graduates who take jobs immediately after graduation are working in art related fields; 23% of MICA&#x27;s B.F.A. graduates pursue graduate study immediately after graduation.

From 2009 to 2017, 14 MICA graduates received Fulbright awards for study abroad and five students earned the Jacob Javits Fellowship for graduate study. Since 2003, two alumni have received the national Jack Kent Cooke Foundation Graduate Scholarship and three Jack Kent Cooke Foundation scholars chose to study at MICA. Additionally, four alumni were awarded Elizabeth Greenshields Foundation Grants.

==Facilities==
MICA&#x27;s campus is a mixture of buildings from different periods of Baltimore&#x27;s development.

===Main building===

The Main Building houses painting and drawing studios, undergraduate photography department, foundation department, two departmental galleries, undergraduate admissions and the President&#x27;s Office.

Construction began on a new campus in Bolton Hill when its Centre Market building was destroyed. Construction was completed in 1908. The State of Maryland, the Carnegie Foundation, and local benefactors contributed funds to build it. Michael Jenkins donated the land, stipulating that the new building not clash with the nearby Gothic Revival Corpus Christi Church. The Main Building was the first to be designed by New York-based architects Pell &amp; Corbett, who were awarded the contract when they won a $500 design contest sponsored by the New York Association of Independent Architects. Otto Fuchs designed the interior studio plans. The architecture was intended to evoke a feeling of the Grand Canal of Venice, c. 1400. The exterior marble is carved from &quot;Beaver Dam&quot; marble, excavated from the Baltimore County quarry near Cockeysville, Maryland. It is the same marble used to build the Washington Monument in Baltimore designed by Robert Mills, and part of the Washington Monument in Washington, D.C.
Architectural features include the main entrance, offering a large marble staircase, stained-glass skylight and the names of Renaissance masters surrounding the entrance to the second floor. The exterior of the northeast façade features four stone memorial medallions: one for the city, one for the state and two others honoring institute benefactors Andrew Carnegie and Michael Jenkins. Throughout the Main Building plaster replicas of Greek and Roman statues offer students study targets for their Foundation year.

In 1908, the New York Association of Independent Architects awarded the building a gold key, the highest award in architecture at the time.

From 1990 to 1992, the building underwent a $5.1 million renovation under the direction of the Grieves, Worrell, Wright &amp; O&#x27;Hatnick, Inc (GWWO) architectural firm. The renovation upgraded the building&#x27;s facilities and created additional academic and office space while retaining much of the original design and décor.

===Mount Royal Station===

The Mount Royal Station houses the undergraduate departments of fiber and interdisciplinary sculpture, 3D classrooms, and the Rinehart School of Sculpture, as well as senior studios. The railroad tracks underneath the train shed remain active as CSX Transportation&#x27;s freight mainline to New York City.

Built in 1896, the Mount Royal Station (now known as The Station Building) was the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad&#x27;s showcase passenger station until it ceased operations in 1961. MICA purchased the building in 1964 and renovated it in 1966 under the direction of architect Richard Donkervoet, retaining as much of the building&#x27;s exterior and interior as possible, including vaulted ceilings, columns and mosaic floor. Margaret Mead, in a lecture given at the Station, commented that the renovation &quot;is perhaps the most magnificent example in the Western World of something being made into something else&quot;.

On December 8, 1976, the Station was added to the register of National Historic Landmarks, granting it full protection as an historic site. The Mount Royal Station&#x27;s gable-roofed train shed, one of the country&#x27;s last remaining such structures, was renovated in 1985. Between 2005 and 2007, MICA accomplished a two-phased, $6.3 million renovation by the architectural firm Grieves, Worrall, Wright &amp; O&#x27;Hatnick, Inc. (GWWO).

It had of working space divided into three floors. In 2016, MICA demolished the Dolphin Building in preparation of a five story/25,000 square feet structure, designed by Baltimore architectural firm GWWO. The building reopened in September 2017, and is now home to the Interactive Arts, Game Design, Product Design, and Architectural Design departments.

Students are allowed to view any Special Collections item by requesting it from library staff. The library also includes an oversized Folio section and a wide collection of video and film materials, including DVD and Blu-ray. It hosts display cases for monthly exhibits, a private Screening Room for viewing films and holding meetings, and a classroom for instruction. Bunting Center contains the Pinkard Gallery and Student Space Gallery.

The acquisition and renovation of Bunting Center increased MICA&#x27;s academic space by 20% when it opened in 1998. It was named for trustee George Bunting, who was also instrumental in the development of the Fox Building, among other projects.

The Bunting Center received the Grand Design Award and Honor Award from AIA Baltimore in 1998. In 2007, architect Steve Ziger headed the building&#x27;s $5.5 million renovation, seeking to create &quot;a real sense of neighborhood&quot; for the college.

===Firehouse===

MICA purchased a historic Firehouse along North Avenue in 2001 and renovated the building in 2003. As part of the redevelopment agreement, MICA maintained the station&#x27;s front façade in accordance with Commission for Historical and Architectural Preservation standards. The renovation architect was Cho Benn Holback + Associates, Inc. Kajima Construction Services was the contractor. The Firehouse won an award from the Baltimore Heritage Foundation for preservation in 2004.

Built in 1915 as the Cannon Shoe Factory, the Fox Building was purchased in 1976. After two years of planning by architects Ayers/Saint/Gross, work began in 1979 and the newly renovated building opened in 1980. This renovation retained most of the warehouse character of the building, including exposed ductwork and framing and the original exterior—The renovations cost $2.5 million, and the building was named for architect Charles J. Fox, a 1965 graduate of MICA whose family contributed over $1.5 million of the renovation cost. After the conversion, the Mount Royal Improvement Association granted MICA an Award of Merit for its contribution to the community.

In 2005, a second renovation added another gallery and cafe.

===Bank Building (Studio Center)===
The building houses the post-baccalaureate certificate program, Hoffberger School of Painting, The Mount Royal School of Art, the Graduate Photographic and Electronic Media program, and Senior student studios. Although the official name is &quot;The Studio Center&quot;, many students know it as &quot;The Bank Building&quot;.

MICA purchased the former Jos. A. Bank sewing plant on North Avenue in August 2000. The all-brick building dates to the early 20th century and was home to Morgan Millwork for most of the century. 


===Brown Center===
The Brown Center houses MICA&#x27;s digital art and design programs, as well as the 525-seat Falvey Hall, which, in addition to hosting school-related functions, has also played host to events like the Maryland Film Festival and National Portfolio Day. It houses the Video, Animation, and BFA and MFA Graphic Design departments. It also has an art gallery, a secondary hall for lectures (&quot;Brown 320&quot;), and a &quot;Black-Box&quot; area for Interactive Media installations.

The first newly constructed academic building for the college in nearly a hundred years, Brown Center was dedicated on October 17, 2003, and became fully operational in January 2004. It was bolstered by a $6 million gift from Eddie and Sylvia Brown, the largest gift ever received by the institute. The building was designed by architect Charles Brickbauer and Ziger/Snead.

The , five-story contemporary structure garnered acclaim as an architectural landmark. Awards have included the AIABaltimore 2004 Grand Design Award, AIA Maryland 2004 Honor Award of Excellence, regional award of merit in 2004 in the International Illumination Design Award competition, and several awards for excellence in construction. In addition, MICA president Fred Lazarus traveled to Italy in June 2006 to receive the Dedalo Minosse International Prize for Brown Center. Brown Center was the only American project among the finalists.

===Additional facilities===
Additional buildings making up MICA&#x27;s campus include the Maryland Institute College of Art shop (known simply as &quot;The MICA Store&quot;) at 1501 W. Mount Royal Ave. selling art supplies and books, and official MICA merchandise.

==Student housing==
=== Founder’s Green ===
Founder&#x27;s Green is a three-building, four-story student apartment complex. Among the first student residences to be constructed on the apartment-living model, it houses approximately 500 students. When MICA proposed purchasing a lot on McMechen Street that had been vacant for more than 30 years, to build student housing, and the Bolton Hill neighborhood approved the purchase and donated $50,000. Built in 1991, and previously named &quot;The Commons&quot;. In 2012, the building was renamed and renovated into the apartment-style by architecture firm, Ayers Saint Gross.

===Meyerhoff House===
Meyerhoff House is a residence for Sophomore, Junior and Senior students. The building includes the college&#x27;s main dining facility, student life center and recreational amenities. Originally built as the Hospital for the Women of Maryland, the building was used as nursing home for some time until it closed in 1994. The building was vacant for seven years until MICA purchased it in January 2001.

===The Gateway===
The Gateway includes apartments to accommodate 217 student residents, a translucent studio tower, a multi-use performance space, the college&#x27;s largest student exhibition gallery, and a new home for the Joseph Meyerhoff Center for Career Development. The Gateway is located at the intersection of Mount Royal and North avenues, alongside the Jones Falls Expressway (I-83). Construction began on The Gateway in October 2006 and completed in August 2008. It was designed by RTKL Associates Inc. In August 2008, the first students moved into the Gateway.

<text>The Peugeot 404 is a large family car produced by French automobile manufacturer Peugeot from 1960 to 1975. A truck body style variant was marketed until 1988. Styled by Pininfarina, the 404 was offered initially as a saloon, estate, and pickup. A convertible was added in 1962, and a coupé in 1963. The 404 was fitted with a 1.6 litre petrol engine, with either a Solex carburetor or Kugelfischer mechanical fuel injection or a 1.9 litre diesel engine available as options. Introduced at the Paris Motor Show as an option was the inclusion of a 3-speed ZF automatic transmission, similar to the unit already offered on certain BMW models, as an alternative to the standard column-mounted manual unit.

Popular as a taxicab, the 404 enjoyed a reputation for durability and value. The 404 was manufactured under licence in various African countries until 1991 (in Kenya) and was manufactured in Argentina by Safrar/Sevel in El Palomar; in Québec, Canada at the St-Bruno-de-Montarville Sociéte de Montage Automobile (SoMA) Ltd. plant (1965-1968); in New Zealand by Campbell Industries; in Australia by Renault Australia Pty. Ltd.; and in Chile by Automotores Franco Chilena S.A. in Los Andes. Peugeot&#x27;s French production run of 1,847,568 404s ended in 1975. A total of 2,885,374 units had been produced worldwide at the end of production.

==Production history==

===1960===
Saloon introduced with petrol engine and column-shift four-speed gearbox with gate &quot;reversed&quot; (first down, up for second, and towards the wheel for third down and fourth up) – identical to the 203 and 403 (except that fourth gear is direct drive). The Grand Touring model has square air vents on the dashboard and body-coloured wheels.
===1961===
Introduction of the Super Luxe model: Superstructure painted silver, chromed headlight rims, large diameter hubcaps, tan leather interior trim, front armrest. The body coloured wheels on the Grand Touring model were replaced with metallic silver ones.

===1962===
A new suspension with increased travel and flexibility was added. The dashboard was modified and the square air vents were replaced by circular directional vents. New reinforced drum brake linings were installed. Anti-reflective paint was used for the dashboard.

Introduction of Commerciale, Break and seven-seat Family estate versions, with tandem coil spring rear suspension in the place of the sedan&#x27;s single spring arrangement. These versions have a balanced spring system to assist in opening the tailgate, different rear light clusters, rear bumper arrangement and the fuel filler cap is no longer hidden behind the rear number plate, but behind a flap in the rear wing. These variants are also longer ( compared to ) and heavier ( compared to ) than their saloon equivalents. The Commerciale (U6) is fitted with a 1468 cc engine (XB2), producing at 5000 rpm.

===Convertible launch===

The Peugeot 404 cabriolet/convertible made its first appearance at the Paris Motor Show in October 1961 and the accompanying coupé version was launched six months later. The convertible and coupé bodyshells were made by the Pinin Farina workshops in Turin and only the floorpan and mechanical elements were shared with the saloon. These models were initially powered by the same single carburetter engine as the saloon and the option of a fuel injected engine (XCKF1) with a Kugelfischer injection system was added to the range at the Geneva Motor Show in March 1962. The US$3,899 price in 1965 put the convertible in the same price bracket as the Jaguar E-Type in the American market.

===1963===
The 404 Super Luxe sedan has the fuel injection engine (XCKF) and has door cappings trimmed with leather. The 404 Grand Touring sedan adopts painted side window trims instead of chrome. The steering wheel and horn ring are changed. In March the 404 Diesel with Indenor engine (XD85) is launched, although this is only built for seven months before being updated for the next model year. Between July and September, the carburetted engines of the sedan adopts five bearings (XC5), as do the fuel injected models (XCKF1).

The Family estate gains a split middle row of seats to improve access to the rear row The 404 coupé is introduced with the same body as the cabriolet but with a fixed roof.

===1964===
The 404 Diesel&#x27;s XD85 engine is replaced by the XD88, which has a more powerful and reliable Bosch pump. Rubber over-riders were now fitted on the bumpers, and bi-colour oval front indicator clusters were equipped on coupés and convertibles (a similar design was used later on sedans and derivatives).

===Year 1965===
Injection engine XCKF1 () replaced by XCKF2, with power increased to . For the new model year, XC5 carburettor engine power is increased to in September 1964. Thermostable brakes servo-assisted by a mechanical vacuum manufactured by Bendix. The Super Luxe, coupé and convertible get eight-hole wheel covers cells instead of six-hole ones. New seat pads for Grand Touring, with cloth quilted to form longitudinal ridges similar to the 404 Super Luxe. All models are given reclining front seats.

In October 1964 the 404 A8 was introduced, using an updated version of the 403&#x27;s 1.5-liter engine called the XB2 and with stripped down equipment. &quot;A8&quot; signifies &quot;Administration&quot; and 8 tax horsepower; this model was only available to French government agencies. This version was built until September 1967 (when the 404/8 replaced it) but only 525 examples left the lines.

===Year 1966===
The Grand Touring saloon is available with the XCKF2 injection engine. It was also available with a ZF automatic gearbox. The front indicator light clusters are now orange / white on all models. Two tone door linings (black top and bottom) on all models. Cigarette lighter fitted on Super Luxe only. Brake compensator fitted on petrol models. In June 1966, the millionth Peugeot 404 left the band at Peugeot&#x27;s Sochaux plant.

===Year 1967===
The new XC6 carburetor engine fitted with increased power of net (80 bhp SAE). The engine bearings benefitted from improved shells. Rear anti roll bar fitted. New dashboard with three round dials. The spare wheel is relocated from inside the boot to under rear of the car. The rear valance is amended (Saloon only) and the capacity of the petrol tank is increased from (saloon). Cigarette lighter fitted on all models, Super Luxe has automatic light on lockable glovebox. The front of coupés and convertibles is redesigned, incorporating a new grille with integral driving lamps and rectangular indicator clusters. The convertible hood now has a &quot;Panoramic&quot; rear window and the seat mechanism is improved for better accessibility.

In March, unveiling of the &quot;Camionnette bâchée&quot; / &quot;Canvas Top Van&quot; (pick-up).

===Year 1968===

In October 1967, at the Paris Salon, the 404/8 Confort model (8 CV) was added to the range. Called the XB5, this is a development of the XB2 engine used in the 403 since 1960 and also in the 404 A8. It is an economy model, fitting into a lower French &quot;puissance fiscale&quot; (road tax) class than the 9 CV version, but unlike the earlier 404 A8 this version was generally available to the public. It used the earlier dashboard design and bumpers without over riders, along with painted rather than chromed headlight surrounds. This was also the first 404 model to benefit from front disc brakes. 8 CV cars were not imported into the UK, but some RHD models are produced for other markets. Unlike the left-hand drive version, right-hand drive 404/8 models received drum brakes all around. Despite a price about ten percent lower than the 9CV model, the step-up in taxes between an 8 and a 9CV was minimal at this time and the 404/8 was not a strong seller, apart from with government agencies.

The last 404 Coupé and Cabriolet models were produced in October 1968, after a production run of 17,223 units.

For model year 1968, reversing lamps were fitted to Super Luxe while a new gearbox with European grid (BA7) was fitted on all models in place of the &quot;C3&quot; box. New steering wheel, dashboard modified.

===Year 1969===
Peugeot launches the 504. 404 Injection no longer offered, new door interior panels introduced. Front disc brakes fitted on all petrol models. The 404/8 is modified for the new year, only to be discontinued in October 1969 so as to not compete internally with the new 7CV Peugeot 304.

===Year 1970–1972===
For 1970, the 404 Super Luxe was discontinued, while the 404 (8 CV) Confort was discontinued in the domestic French market, leaving the Grand Touring, Break and Familiale models to continue in petrol and diesel forms. The 404/8 Confort continued to be produced for export markets until February 1972. The Grand Touring receives chrome headlight rims and reversing lights as standard. Wing-mounted indicator repeaters are no longer fitted. New XC7 engine fitted (de-tuned to ), but with torque equivalent to XC6.

New front indicator clusters from 1971, which was also the last year that the Break and Familiale models were sold in France. Two-speed windscreen wipers introduced on the sedan 1972, with an optional rear screen demister.

===Year 1973–1975===

The water temperature gauge was replaced by a warning lamp on the dashboard, grille shield is replaced by lion. The optional automatic transmission (which is now six positions: PRN 3 2 1) remained available until the end of 1974. In May 1975, production of European passenger models ceased. By this time Peugeot customers in Europe strongly favoured the newer 304 and 504 models, and French 404 production was much reduced, with only 15,780 – all berlines/saloons/sedans – produced during the first five months of 1975.

==Foreign assembly==

The 404 was assembled in a number of countries besides France. It was manufactured by Safrar in Argentina (later Sevel) (162,583 cars built), and assembly took place in Australia (by the local Renault subsidiary – 8600 cars built), Belgium, Canada (about 3100 404 sedans were built at the SoMA plant shared with Renault), Chile (14,892 cars built), Ireland, Kenya, Madagascar, Malaysia, New Zealand (2800 cars built), Nigeria, Portugal, Peru (by Braillard starting in 1967), Rhodesia, South Africa (79,045 cars built), and Uruguay.

In South Africa, where the 404 saloon continued in production until the end of 1978, the GL and Automatique versions received the more powerful XM7 engine also used in the 504. The GL also received front seats similar to those of the 504, as well as the 504&#x27;s floor-mounted shifter with its characteristic bend. Late cars also have 504 steering wheels, as 404 parts were becoming scarce. The 404 Wagon was assembled until early 1976, when the supply of French CKD kits dried up.

The 404, especially in pickup form, is still a common sight in North and West Africa. The Argentinian-built 404 was available with both the 1.6 petrol and the diesel engine, in Standard or Luxe equipment levels. The Luxe featured sporty alloy wheels and a special grille with integrated extra lamps.

==Road tests and press reviews==

===404 coupé injection===
The 404 coupé with the desirable &quot;KF2&quot; fuel injected engine was tested by Motor magazine on December 4, 1965. The title of the article is &quot;A First Class Job&quot; and the rest of the article follows suit in praising the model, highlighting the car&#x27;s remarkable performance and beauty. Even with of driver and test equipment on board, the car posted a acceleration time of 12.2 seconds, 18.8 seconds in the standing start and a top speed of . Fuel economy (over a shorter test distance than usual) was , which the author suggests would have improved had the usual test distance been completed. The punitive British taxes of the 1960s made this a very expensive car indeed, equivalent in cost to a Jaguar Mark X. Overall the conclusions of the review were that it was an excellent car.

===404 saloon===

&quot;Autocar&quot; magazine tested the fuel injected KF2 version of the 404 saloon/sedan in the spring of 1965. The testers summarized the car as follows: &quot;100 MPH maximum and high cruising speeds; very well developed fuel injection giving easy starting and moderate fuel consumption; powerful fade-free drum brakes; accurate steering and good compromise suspension; comfortable seating with leather trim; sun-roof a standard fitting; priced rather high in the U.K.&quot; Mean maximum speed was measured at with a best leg of ; the standing start was measured at 18.8 seconds. Overall fuel consumption was .

&quot;Canada Track &amp; Traffic Magazine&quot; also tested the Peugeot 404 with fuel injection in their May 1965 issue. The testers measured a time of 12.1 seconds, with a top speed of . A good cruising speed is , according to the article. &quot;It is difficult to single out any one aspect of the Peugeot as being outstanding, for in truth the whole car is outstanding.&quot; The writer concludes with: &quot;To summarize, we can only say that the Peugeot 404 is a car that we find almost impossible to criticize, from any standpoint. It is a car that ideally combines comfort, quality and economy. In short, it is the kind of car one can buy with absolute confidence and drive and drive and drive, for longevity comes with quality in the case of Peugeot.&quot;

The 404 saloon was tested by &quot;Motor&quot; magazine in 1968. The styling was criticised as square cut, perpendicular and appearing rather dated, while the interior was considered &quot;austere&quot; compared to British cars of the time (the article includes a performance comparison with the Triumph 2000, Ford Corsair 2000E and Humber Sceptre). However, great praise is given for build quality, with the article stating that the car is suitable for African safaris and Arctic gales alike.

===404 Familiale===
The 404 was tested (in Family estate form) by &quot;Motor&quot; magazine in 1965. The car&#x27;s quirks (the unusual original column-shift gearbox gate and awkward body roll at low speed) are listed. Build quality was praised and the interior described as &quot;quietly tasteful&quot;, although the authors felt that the appeal of the car was limited.

The car was tested again by Motor magazine five years later. The article is critical of the car&#x27;s styling, calling it &quot;square cut&quot; and &quot;hardly avant garde&quot;, but then relents and opts for &quot;mature rather than dated&quot; as its final comment. The ride is reported to improve as loading and speed increase. Of some concern to the testers was the driver&#x27;s difficulty in reaching the handbrake when wearing a fixed seat-belt – inertia reel type belts would not have this problem. Alternative cars were listed as the Citroen Safari and Volvo 145. The car is described as having been used by one reader to transport the driver and 12 children.

An article in &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper on French-made cars includes a comparison of the outgoing 404 with the 504. The performance of both cars (given their engine size) is praised.

===404 Diesel===
During the 1960s Peugeot, along with Mercedes-Benz, were pioneering large scale production of diesel engined passenger cars. The British &quot;Autocar&quot; magazine tested a Peugeot 404 Diesel in November 1965. The car had a top speed of and accelerated from in 25.5 seconds. An &quot;overall&quot; fuel consumption of was recorded. This compared with a top speed of , a time of 20 seconds and an overall fuel consumption of for the petrol version of the car which had recently been tested by the same journal and which (albeit without the diesel car&#x27;s rev limiter) had exactly the same gear ratios. In terms of performance the Peugeot comfortably outperformed the diesel Austin Cambridge and the Mercedes Benz 190D also included in the comparison. The slower Austin nonetheless won on fuel economy. In terms of price, the 404 diesel was offered in the UK at £1,396 as against £1,093 for its petrol fuelled sibling. The manufacturer&#x27;s recommended price for the Austin was just £875. The slower heavier Mercedes was not really pitched at the same market segment, being priced in the UK at £2,050. The testers described the Peugeot 404 Diesel as &#x27;the fastest diesel yet&#x27;. They reported the characteristic diesel rattle when idling and the &#x27;roar at high revs&#x27;, but found the performance &#x27;very reasonable&#x27;. They commended the sure-footed road holding, good steering, powerful fade-free brakes, the comfortable seats, the very good fuel economy and the prospect for a &#x27;long attention-free life&#x27;.

The 404 Diesel was tested again (in Family estate form) by Autocar magazine six years later. Top speed was improved on the previous test, , but acceleration to was poorer at 26.8 seconds. Notable features in the report were that the test car had broken two speedometer cables during testing. They mention its size twice: &quot;wonderfully roomy&quot; and &quot;a big car for big men&quot;. The cars &quot;oddities&quot; are listed as the reverse-acting gearbox gate, window-sill door locks and windscreen wiper controls. 404 Diesels were widely used as taxis, and appeared as such in contemporary films.

In June 1965, a 1962 model 404 convertible - in fact the 34th 404C built by Pininfarina - equipped with the Indénor 88 Diesel engine, displacing just under 2 litres and rated at 68 BHP (SAE), and streamlined with a single seat and a fighter aircraft style canopy over the driving seat was brought to Monthléry racetrack near Paris and run for 103 hours at a 161 Km/h (just over 100 MPH ) average on the banked oval track of Montlhéry, covering 16,627 Kilometres. A team of five pilots took two hours shifts and had to stick to a tight average (not just full speed pedal-to-the-floor run) helped by a clever device , an adjustable &quot;snail&quot; shaped stopper on the throttle linkage. As per record regulations, the car had to carry a very comprehensive toolkit and a massive amount of spares, including transmission axles and spare drum brakes and weighed a hefty 1135 Kgs in record trim.

==Motorsport==
Peugeot 404s won the Safari Rally in 1963, 1966, 1967 and 1968, the latter three in Kugelfischer fuel-injected variants. In 2014, a 1963 Peugeot 404 was entered in a 24 Hours of LeMons race at Thunderhill Raceway Park, ran reliably through the 2-day event, and won the event&#x27;s Index of Effluency award.

<doc id="1150937" wikidata="Q1370953" url="?curid=1150937" title="Kei Yasuda">
<text>is a Japanese singer, musician and actress under the Hello! Project. She was a member and co-leader of the Japanese girl group Morning Musume. Yasuda, along with Mari Yaguchi and Sayaka Ichii, were the second generation of singers to be recruited into Morning Musume. Morning Musume had only released one official single, Morning Coffee, prior to their joining.
Yasuda was also a member of Japanese pop group Dream Morning Musume.

== Biography ==
Yasuda was born in Futtsu, Chiba, and attended Kimitsu Shogyo (Commercial) High School in Futtsu City, Chiba Prefecture, but dropped out to pursue her dreams in the entertainment industry. She worked in a McDonald&#x27;s restaurant in her hometown, until 1998.

She was chosen to be in the second generation of Morning Musume. After they joined, Morning Musume went on to produce one album and three more singles until Asuka Fukuda decided to leave to pursue her studies. Yasuda was given almost all of Fukuda&#x27;s lines in future performances of these early songs. She had also collaborated with other Morning Musume members in special projects during these early days. One of the more notable ones was when she co-wrote and co-sang with Natsumi Abe the song &quot;Sanpo&quot; for a radio contest. It became wildly popular and a petition was circulated to make it an official single, though that never happened.

Yasuda and Ichii sang a particularly catchy duet known as &quot;Otome no Shinrigaku&quot; (Girl&#x27;s Psychology) on Morning Musume&#x27;s second album. In response to the popularity, Tsunku decided to group them together with the third generation member, Maki Goto to create the Morning Musume subgroup Petitmoni (also known as Pucchimoni) in 1999. Their first single, &quot;Chokotto Love,&quot; sold over a million copies.

After Ichii left Morning Musume and Petitmoni, fourth generation member Hitomi Yoshizawa joined the subgroup. Yasuda had taken on the role of leader for Petitmoni and the group continued to produce three singles and an album.

After Morning Musume&#x27;s then-leader Yuko Nakazawa left in 2001, Yasuda (who was the oldest member of the group at the time) became a co-leader along with Kaori Iida.

Yasuda left in mid-2003 at the same time when Morning Musume&#x27;s 6th generation became full-fledged members. Tsunku commented that this one-time sixteen-member formation will be the largest Morning Musume. During her good-bye concert, Yasuda sang a remixed rock version of &quot;Never Forget,&quot; which was also Fukuda&#x27;s good-bye song. Additionally, as a special gift, Tsunku gave Yasuda a CD of her own solo version of &quot;As for One Day,&quot; her last single with Morning Musume.

Following Yasuda&#x27;s leaving, Iida became the leader of Morning Musume and Yaguchi became sub-leader. The Petitmoni leadership was handed over to Yoshizawa, and two members were added (fifth generation Morning Musume member Makoto Ogawa and Coconuts Musume&#x27;s Ayaka Kimura) and Goto left. This new line up of Petitmoni never had another release, but a few of their songs were featured on compilation albums.

Yasuda was still in the Hello! Project after leaving the group, and acted in dramas outside of H!P. Within H!P, she has collaborated with Nakazawa and other H!P artists on two Folk Songs albums, performed and MC&#x27;d Abe&#x27;s first solo concert, sang backup on Goto&#x27;s single &quot;Daite Yo! Please Go On,&quot; and hosted Morning Musume&#x27;s weekly TV show &quot;Hello! Morning&quot; until Rika Ishikawa took that position. Yasuda participated in the H.P. All Stars single &quot;All for One &amp; One For All&quot; and the Puripuri Pink shuffle unit. Puripuri Pink was a new type of shuffle unit, since it was the first unit to feature former Morning Musume members, who were usually not included in the shuffles.

During a promotional appearance on Utaban in 2004, Yasuda revealed that she has been learning how to play the flute.

Yasuda graduated from Hello! Project on March 31, 2009, along with the rest of the H!P Elder Club.

In 2010, it was announced that Kei Yasuda would be joining other former-Morning Musume members for the new group &quot;Dream Morning Musume.&quot;

== Personal life ==
On May 29, 2013, Yasuda announced that she had married chef Kozaki Yoichi. On July 27, 2017, she has announced that she is pregnant with her first baby. Their little boy was born in January 2018.

<doc id="1150939" wikidata="Q260118" url="?curid=1150939" title="List of neighbourhoods in Toronto">
<text>The strength and vitality of the many neighbourhoods that make up Toronto, Ontario, Canada has earned the city its unofficial nickname of &quot;the city of neighbourhoods.&quot; There are 158 neighbourhoods officially recognized by the City of Toronto (in 2022, 34 neighbourhoods were created from 16 of the previous 140) and upwards of 240 official and unofficial neighbourhoods within city limits.

The current City of Toronto is the amalgamation of the former Metropolitan Toronto municipalities. Along with the original City of Toronto, these are East York, Etobicoke, North York, Scarborough, and York. The names of these municipalities are still often used by Toronto residents, sometimes for disambiguation purposes as amalgamation resulted in duplicated street names. The area known as Toronto before the 1998 amalgamation is sometimes called the &quot;Old Toronto&quot;, and &quot;the core&quot;. For administrative purposes, Toronto is divided into four districts: Etobicoke-York, North York, Scarborough and Toronto-East York.

The Old Toronto district is, by far, the most populous and densest part of the city. It is also the business and administrative centre of the city. The uniquely Torontonian bay-and-gable housing style is common throughout the former city. The &quot;inner ring&quot; suburbs of York and East York are older, predominantly middle-income areas, and ethnically diverse. Much of the housing stock in these areas consists of pre-World War II single-family houses and some post-war high-rises. Many of the neighbourhoods in these areas were built up as streetcar suburbs and contain many dense and mixed-use streets, some of which are one-way. They share many characteristics with sections of the &quot;old&quot; city outside the downtown core. The &quot;outer ring&quot; suburbs of Etobicoke, Scarborough, and North York are much more suburban in nature, although even these districts have some old-city characteristics (in particular southern Etobicoke along the shore of Lake Ontario) in areas bordering Old Toronto, and have developed modern urban centres of their own, such as North York City Centre around Mel Lastman Square.

The following is a list of the more notable neighbourhoods, organized by former municipality.

==Neighbourhoods by former municipality==
===Toronto===

Old Toronto refers to the City of Toronto and its limits from 1967 to 1997. It is sometimes referred to as the &quot;South&quot; or &quot;Central&quot; district, and includes the downtown core. Some of these names such as &quot;The Fashion District&quot; are (or were) used as marketing for the areas or by BIAs; this area is actually called &quot;King-Spadina&quot; by locals. Another example is the &quot;Old Town of York&quot;, also known as &quot;King and Parliament&quot; (although that intersection is one block east of the original ten blocks that formed the old town). Some people in the area also consider it to be a suburb of the main city of Toronto, as many choose to move there in pursuit of a more relaxed and &quot;backwoods&quot; vibe.

Since the early 21st century, Old Toronto is having a boom in condominium construction.

Many were recreated or named to reconnect the areas with their past history, early beginnings, or even recent use and prominence. Some historical city &quot;wards&quot; used in the 19th century are no longer used: St. David&#x27;s, St. John&#x27;s, St. Paul&#x27;s, St. George&#x27;s, St. Andrew&#x27;s, and St. Patrick&#x27;s wards. There was a ward named for the patron saint of each of the three British nationalities: English (St. George), Scottish (St. Andrew), Welsh (St. David) and Irish (St. Patrick). , and still survive as subway stations, though St. George station is not named after the ward, but after St. George Street instead, itself named after Quetton St. George, a local military officer and landowner. St. Lawrence&#x27;s Ward (named after the patron saint of Canada and the river, itself also named after the saint) remains, known today as &quot;St. Lawrence&quot;. St. Paul&#x27;s (named after the saint) remains as the name of an electoral district for each of the three levels of government, although the electoral district has very little to no overlap with the historic St. Paul&#x27;s Ward and beginning in the 2015 Canadian federal election, the electoral district was renamed Toronto—St. Paul&#x27;s. This meant that the St. Paul&#x27;s electoral district is a misnomer for much of the history of the electoral district.

===East York===
An autonomous urban borough until 1997, East York is primarily located north of Danforth Avenue between the Don River to the west and Victoria Park Avenue to the east, though the Shoppers World Danforth shopping plaza/mall hybrid, on the south side of Danforth Avenue west of Victoria Park Avenue, is located in East York. East York was an exclave of York from 1922 to 1924 and became a separate municipality to simplify governance. East York developed contemporaneously with the West End of old Toronto, and it is similar in form and character. In 1967, East York was expanded to include the Town of Leaside. Since the 1998 amalgamation, it is administered together with old Toronto, and separate from Scarborough, North York, and Etobicoke-York, by the &quot;Toronto and East York Neighbourhood Council&quot;.
East York itself is commonly divided into two zones with mainly Edwardian urban neighbourhoods situated south of Taylor-Massey Creek and referred to as Old East York.
Old East York
* Broadview North
* Crescent Town
* East Danforth
* Pape Village
* Woodbine Heights
Suburban East York

===Etobicoke===

The former township and city of Etobicoke is on the west side of the Humber River. Several of its neighbourhoods, such as Long Branch, New Toronto, and Mimico, were villages independent of Etobicoke. Others, such as Claireville, Islington and Thistletown were former postal villages established when Etobicoke was still a rural township. Others are residential subdivisions built after World War II as the former Metro Toronto developed.

Etobicoke is often divided into three zones: north, central, and south, roughly approximate to that of the electoral districts of all three levels of government.
* Alderwood

North York is split by Yonge Street into an east section and a west section. Several of North York&#x27;s neighbourhoods (such as Lansing, Newtonbrook and Willowdale) developed from postal villages when North York Township was primarily agrarian. Others are residential subdivisions developed after World War II. North York City Centre is a commercial district developed to be the &#x27;downtown&#x27; of the city.

===York===
The former city of York is situated between Old Toronto and North York, west of Bathurst Street (aside from the neighbourhood of Tichester at the southeasternmost corner of the former city, which extends as far east as Walmer Road and includes much of St. Clair West station, including its northern unstaffed entrance on Heath Street West, as well as St. Michael&#x27;s College School). The community of Weston, to the northwest, was itself an independent village until 1967. Several neighbourhoods are former residential subdivisions built on the limits with Toronto before and after World War II.

York is often divided into two sections: a western section and an eastern section, on either side of GO Transit&#x27;s Barrie rail line.

* Briar Hill–Belgravia
* Fairbank (Caledonia–Fairbank)
* Humewood–Cedarvale (includes Upper Village (also part of Forest Hill))

==History==
Toronto amalgamated twice: first in 1967 and second in 1998.

==Lists of city-designated neighbourhoods==
For administrative purposes, the City of Toronto divides the city into 158 neighbourhoods. These divisions are used for internal planning purposes. The boundaries and names often do not conform to the usage of the general population or designated business improvement areas. A number of neighbourhood maps of Toronto do exist, some produced by real estate firms and some by Internet portals. A project to map the neighbourhoods according to the common usage of the residents was done by the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; newspaper. Based on feedback from &quot;Toronto Star&quot; readers, it has produced the most comprehensive, albeit informal, neighbourhood map. 31 of these neighbourhoods are Neighbourhood Improvement Areas with the strategy to strengthen the social, economic and physical conditions and delivers local impact for city-wide change in these areas.

===Table===
==Business improvement areas==
There are also several dozen city designated business improvement areas, covering almost all of Toronto&#x27;s commercial areas. Some of these serve a particular ethnic group or several similar ethnic groups as part of an ethnic enclave.

==Multiple listing service districts and neighbourhoods==
After the update of Toronto Multiple listing service (MLS) on July 5, 2011, the Toronto Real Estate Board (TREB) introduced a new search feature for the Toronto MLS, used by real estate agents operating in the region. MLS searches can be refined at three levels and MLS users can search houses by area, then by municipality, and then by neighbourhood or community. As with the other MLS services for other jurisdictions, it used Microsoft&#x27;s Bing Maps for its web mapping features until 2018, when it switched to Google Maps. These feature changes were the first change of this magnitude in about 50 years of Toronto MLS history since its establishment.

The change was designed to eliminate the obsolete coding systems whereby Greater Toronto was divided into 86 artificial districts denominated by alphanumeric codes. Due to the growing population in the city and the increasing difficulty of browsing the code-based system, the TREB made a radical change, which is intended to simplify the use of MLS for real estate agents and homebuyers.

Because Toronto is a populous municipality of its own, the core city area will continue to be split into coded districts, although each of the districts will in turn contain neighbourhoods. Hence, the city will be easily searchable as well.

The following table contains a complete list of Toronto districts with a possibly incomplete list of Toronto neighbourhoods within each district:

<doc id="1150954" wikidata="Q387779" url="?curid=1150954" title="Mega Man Battle Network">
<text>is a tactical role-playing video game series created by Masahiro Yasuma and developed and published by Capcom as a spin-off of the &quot;Mega Man&quot; series; it premiered in 2001 on the Game Boy Advance and takes place in an alternate continuity where computers and networking technology was the main focus on scientific advancement, rather than robotics. There are a total of six mainline games, alongside several spin-offs.

Created amidst the success of Nintendo&#x27;s and Game Freak&#x27;s &quot;Pokémon&quot; series, alongside the rise of collectable card games, &quot;Mega Man Battle Network&quot; has players control MegaMan.EXE, a NetNavi operated by Lan Hikari as they attempt to stop the schemes of a net-crime organization called WWW (called &quot;World Three&quot;), headed by the universe&#x27;s interpretation of Dr. Wily. Players battle enemies on a 6x3 grid, selecting &quot;Battle Chips&quot; which allow for more powerful attacks.

The series has been met with positive reviews from critics, although later games, particularly &quot;5&quot; and &quot;6&quot;, have been criticized for a perceived lack of innovation; the series was followed-up by a sequel series titled &quot;Mega Man Star Force&quot;, which is set 200 years after &quot;Battle Network&quot; and focuses on radio waves. A compilation of all six mainline entries, &quot;Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection&quot;, was released in April 2023 for PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch and PC.

==Plot==
&quot;Mega Man Battle Network&quot; is set in an ambiguous year in the 21st century (&quot;20XX AD&quot;) in an alternate reality to the original &quot;Mega Man&quot; series. Within the world of &quot;Battle Network&quot;, the Net has become humanity&#x27;s primary means of communication, commerce, and even crime. Users are able to &quot;jack in&quot; to the Net and other computerized devices, and explore their various aspects using Digital people called &quot;NetNavis (Network Navigators)&quot; as if they were physical locations. The Net and the inner workings of computers are displayed as a virtual world with which computer programs of all varieties, as personified in a humanoid form, can interact. Users often do so by accessing their NetNavis via a &quot;PET (PErsonal information Terminal)&quot; device.

The plot of &quot;Mega Man Battle Network&quot; follows one such pair, Lan Hikari and his NetNavi MegaMan.EXE. Lan is a fifth grader in the town of ACDC. His father, Dr. Yuichiro Hikari, is one of the world&#x27;s top scientists and NetNavi researchers. Most of the series (barring spin-offs) involve Lan Hikari and MegaMan.EXE stopping an evil crime syndicate from taking over the world; &quot;WWW&quot; (said out loud as &quot;World Three&quot;) in the first, third, and sixth games, Gospel in the second game, and Nebula in the fourth and fifth games.

==Gameplay ==
&quot;Mega Man Battle Network&quot; is a real-time tactical RPG series. To progress through the games, the player must alternately navigate the outside world as Lan Hikari and the Net as MegaMan.EXE, each containing certain tasks that must be completed to allow advancement in the other. Controlling Lan, the player may travel around the world map, interact with non-player characters, check email, purchase items, initiate Net missions, or speak with MegaMan.EXE through his PET. In contrast with traditional &quot;Mega Man&quot; entries in which battle and movement through the levels happen in the same setting, &quot;Battle Network&quot;&#x27;s combat occurs only through by battling computer viruses within the Net. This cyber world is represented by a series of branching pathways and nodes, where MegaMan.EXE can travel to both new and previously visited locations, find and purchase items, and fight viruses. Battles do not generally appear on the field screen of the Net but are usually set as random encounters.

The battlefield itself is made up of 18 tiles divided into two groups of nine, one group being space in which MegaMan.EXE may freely move and the other group being space inhabited by enemies. Akin to other &quot;Mega Man&quot; games, MegaMan.EXE possesses an arm cannon called the &quot;Mega Buster&quot;. The player can transition among the nine provided tiles and fire the Mega Buster at enemies from across the screen. The objective of each battle is to delete all the viruses by reducing their hit points (HP) to zero. If MegaMan.EXE&#x27;s own health depletes, a game over occurs. In order to attack without the Mega Buster, the player must utilize Battle Chips, which are placed into a &quot;folder&quot; before the battle starts, and are drawn at random. Starting with the third game, Battle Chips are organized into three primary categories which limits how many of the same chip can be used in the same folder: Standard (4 of the same, 30 in the folder), Mega (1 of the same, 5 in the folder), and Giga (only 1 per folder). Excluding the asterisk code, which was introduced in &quot;2&quot;, the player can only use Battle Chips that have either the same, or share the letter. Selecting a specific combination of Battle Chips results in Program Advances, which give the player either a strong attack, or continual use of the Battle Chip used for several seconds. Each Battle Chip also has an element assigned to it, and hitting an enemy with its weakness will result in them taking double damage.

The series also has multiplayer functionality where two players can either fight, or trade chips with each other using the Game Link Cable; trading the opposite version&#x27;s Mega Chips in &quot;4&quot;–&quot;6&quot; will result in them appearing as &quot;Secret Chips&quot; in the Chip Library, however Giga Chips cannot be traded .

==Development==

Resulting from a cancelled horror game, the original &quot;Mega Man Battle Network&quot; was developed by Capcom Production Studio 2 for the Game Boy Advance handheld video game console.

&quot;Battle Network 3&quot; was intended as the finale of the series, however development on the fourth game started a short while after its release. Writer Masakazu Eguchi wrote that for the last three mainline entries, the developers primarily focused on evolving the battle system from the third game. Later entries in the series also suffered from space limitations, as they still used the same ROM sizes as earlier entries, which lead to the overworld sprites being redrawn to be smaller and more cartoonish. The final game in the series, &quot;Battle Network 6&quot;, redid several of the sprites again and changed the environment due to wanting to make the game feel fresh.
Starting with &quot;Battle Network 4&quot;, the series began including content from Hideo Kojima&#x27;s series &quot;Boktai&quot;, which was developed and published by Konami; the crossover content mainly included battle chips, bosses, and entire areas themed around &quot;Boktai&quot; and vampires. However, content related to the third &quot;Boktai&quot; game would be removed in international versions of &quot;5: Double Team DS&quot; and &quot;6&quot; since it was not released outside of Japan, as would &quot;Lunar Knights&quot; content in &quot;Star Force&quot;.

===Music===
The music of &quot;Mega Man Battle Network&quot; was primarily composed by Akari Kaida, Yoshino Aoki, and Toshihiko Horiyama. The soundtracks for &quot;1&quot; through &quot;6&quot;, alongside &quot;Battle Chip Challenge&quot; and the Japanese-only &quot;4.5: Real Operation&quot; was released in 2021 on Spotify to celebrate the series&#x27; 20th anniversary.

==Games==
===Mainline games===

====&quot;Mega Man Battle Network&quot;====
A terrorist organization called WWW (World Three) attempted to destroy the world with the use of a super virus known as the Life Virus. Despite interference by Lan and MegaMan, the members stole the four element programs they needed in order to make it and succeeded in its creation. The virus was as strong as predicted, but was destroyed by MegaMan. Its defeat forced WWW to retreat. This game received an averaged score of 80% score on GameRankings and 79% on Metacritic.

&quot;Mega Man Battle Network&quot; was later re-released for the Nintendo DS as &quot;Rockman.EXE: Operate Shooting Star&quot;, which serves both as an enhanced port of the original, as well as a crossover with the &quot;Star Force&quot; series. The NetNavi exclusive to &quot;Operate Shooting Star&quot;, ClockMan.EXE, was a winner from a CoroCoro Comics contest. Despite initial strong sales, it would only sell 60000 copies by the end of 2009, which contributed to the cancellation of &quot;Star Force 4&quot;. Capcom&#x27;s then Vice President of Strategic Planning &amp; Business Development, Christian Svennson, stated the company had no plans to release the game for Western territories, however an English fan translation released in 2018.

====&quot;Mega Man Battle Network 2&quot;====

The following summer after WWW&#x27;s defeat, a new terrorist group called Gospel emerges. Their tactics differed considerably compared to WWW, as they appeared to have no set goal. Gospel&#x27;s plan had seemingly consisted of only causing random destruction with their navis. Lan and MegaMan battled every member and prevented the worst possible situations. However, Gospel&#x27;s hidden plan was to re-create the ultimate net navi, Bass. Using bug fragments, they planned to make a large army of Bass navis to take over the world. Unknown to Gospel, their method of creating Bass was imperfect, and his abilities were vastly below predictions. In an attempt to make copies of Bass to create an army, the leader of Gospel overloaded energy to the bug fragments; but something went wrong and the concoction transformed into a giant wolf-like multi-bug organism. Although the bug beast was stronger than before, Lan and MegaMan managed to eliminate it. This game received an averaged score of 82% score on GameRankings and 81% on MetaCritic.

====&quot;Mega Man Battle Network 3&quot;====
&quot;Mega Man Battle Network 3&quot; was released in late-2002 in Japan, and mid-2003 internationally; the game follows a revived WWW seeking to release Alpha, the original prototype of the internet. New to the game is the ability to customize Mega Man by placing blocks in a grid, however placing blocks incorrectly will cause a bug to occur. &quot;Battle Network 3&quot; was the first game to get two distinct versions, although this wasn&#x27;t the case in Japan initially, which didn&#x27;t get &quot;Blue&quot; until a few months after &quot;White&quot;&#x27;s release.

Like with the previous two games, reception to &quot;Battle Network 3&quot; was positive, although some thought the game had innovated too little. The game also topped sales charts, with both versions selling a total of 768,000 units in Japan at the end of 2003.

====&quot;Mega Man Battle Network 4&quot;====
Released in December 2003 in Japan, and June 2004 in North America, &quot;Mega Man Battle Network 4&quot; involves a meteor on trajectory towards Earth, and a new crime syndicate &quot;Nebula&quot; corrupting Navis with Dark Chips. Style Changes are removed in this installment, instead being replaced with Double Souls (Soul Unisons), which can be activated by sacrificing a certain chip. During the game, players will have several scenarios they encounter which are different depending on the version.

Reception to &quot;Battle Network 4&quot; was mixed-to-positive, although it too received lower review scores than the first three, which much criticism going to the lack of any real story outside of tournament scenarios. In addition, &quot;Blue Moon&quot; received criticism due to a bug on the Nintendo DS that would cause the game to slow down significantly when exiting from battle during the WoodMan scenario, which was acknowledged by Nintendo and fixed in time for the DS Lite. Despite this, &quot;Battle Network 4&quot; is the best-selling entry in the series, selling 1.35 million copies worldwide as of 2009.

====&quot;Mega Man Battle Network 5&quot;====
Nebula attacks again, this time with an all-out invasion. They kidnap Lan&#x27;s father and use SciLab&#x27;s computers to take over the internet. In response, either Chaud or Baryl (depending on the version) create a team of elite net navis and operators. Lan and MegaMan are the first members. As the story progresses, more team members are gained, and more areas of the net are liberated. When all of the net is won back, the team locates Nebula&#x27;s headquarters and attempt to defeat the organization. The GBA versions received an average score of 68% on GameRankings and 67% on MetaCritic, whereas the NDS version received 70% on GameRankings and 68% on MetaCritic.

====&quot;Mega Man Battle Network 6&quot;====
&quot;Mega Man Battle Network 6&quot; is the final game in the series, in which Lan&#x27;s father gets a new job and the family moves to Cyber City, leaving behind Lan&#x27;s classmates and friends from ACDC Town. WWW attacks once again, aiming to revive the legendary Cybeasts, Gregar and Falzar. The Double Soul system is replaced with the similar Cross System, this time allowing the player to activate at any time, although it will be disabled if hit by its elemental weakness; players are also able to &quot;Beast Out&quot; MegaMan for a limited time, allowing him to tap into the power of the Cybeasts. Like the previous games, the Crosses and Beast Out differs depending on the version.

The developers have stated the decision to end the series with the sixth game was only made part-way through due to wanting a new &quot;Mega Man&quot; series for the Nintendo DS; the English version also removed a significant amount of content, mainly the removal of the &quot;Boktai&quot; crossover. Reviewers generally showed little enthusiasm for &quot;Battle Network 6&quot;, with it being near-universally highlighted for its lack of changes from previous installments in terms of graphics and gameplay, although some praised its story.

===Spin-offs===
====&quot;Mega Man Network Transmission&quot;====

Released as part of &quot;Mega Man&quot;&#x27;s fifteenth anniversary, &quot;Mega Man Network Transmission&quot; is a platform game developed by Arika and released for the GameCube in mid-2003. The game was first announced in September 2002 at the Tokyo Game Show. The game acts is set between &quot;1&quot; and &quot;2&quot;, and involves a new &quot;Zero Virus&quot; that makes Navis go berserk. The game mixes the gameplay of the &quot;Classic&quot; series 2D platforming and &quot;Battle Network&quot; series tactical RPG elements, with Keiji Inafune stating the decision was made by Arika to &quot;preserve the core of &quot;Rockman&quot;&quot;.

Reception to &quot;Network Transmission&quot; was divisive; a major point of contempt was the game&#x27;s high difficulty, while the overall presentation drew mixed reactions. On Metacritic, the game averaged a 65/100 indicating &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews.

====&quot;Rockman.EXE WS&quot;====

Lan Hikari and MegaMan.EXE face off against the WWW. The story adapts aspects of both the first Mega Man Battle Network game as well as the anime series, MegaMan NT Warrior. The gameplay is similar to that of Mega Man Network Transmission.

====&quot;Mega Man Battle Chip Challenge&quot;====

Developed with help from Inti Creates, who also developed the &quot;Mega Man Zero&quot; and &quot;ZX&quot; series, &quot;Mega Man Battle Chip Challenge&quot; utilizes a different battle system where players setup 12 Battle Chips on a grid called a &quot;Program Deck&quot;, three of which are randomly selected. Aside from the Game Boy Advance version, the game also saw a release on the WonderSwan Color under the title &quot;Rockman.EXE: N1 Battle&quot;, being among the last games released for the console.

Unlike other games, contemporary reception to &quot;Battle Chip Challenge&quot; was mostly negative, with many critics disliking the lack of audience participation and aging presentation, although the audio was praised. The game currently has a 54/100 on Metacritic.

====&quot;Rockman.EXE 4.5: Real Operation&quot;====

&quot;Rockman.EXE 4.5: Real Operation&quot; was released in Japan-only on August 6, 2004. The &quot;Real Operation&quot; part of the title refers to how the Game Boy Advance functions as its own PET; during battles, players don&#x27;t control the Navi directly, instead giving it instructions to follow. Reportedly, the game&#x27;s development was &quot;hell&quot; due to it being completed in less than a year, in-between &quot;Battle Network 4&quot; and &quot;5&quot;. The game was re-released for the Wii U Virtual Console in 2016.

====Other games====

&quot;Rockman.EXE: The Medal Operation&quot;, and &quot;Rockman.EXE: Battle Chip Stadium&quot; are a pair of arcade games released in 2005 and 2006; &quot;The Medal Operation&quot; is a medal game based on &quot;Battle Network 5&quot; where players could win chocolate, and &quot;Battle Chip Stadium&quot; uses the familiar battle system and is based upon &quot;Battle Network 6&quot;. Service for &quot;Battle Chip Stadium&quot; ended in April 2014.

Two mobile games were released in Japan, &quot;Rockman.EXE: Phantom of Network&quot; in 2004, and &quot;Rockman.EXE: Legend of Network&quot; in 2006; both games feature the same gameplay as the mainline entries and include exclusive characters. As of January 1, 2018, both games are no longer available for purchase. Despite their obscurity, many people have wished for them to see a re-release of them onto modern platforms. Both mobile games were eventually preserved in 2023, and received a fan translation in 2024, allowing the games to be played in English. 

A compilation, &quot;Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection&quot;, was released in April 2023, bringing the series to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Windows. The compilation includes all six of the numbered games, including both versions of &quot;Battle Network 3&quot;–&quot;6&quot;. Physical versions of the collection are sold as one game, while digital versions split the games between two volumes.

==Other media==
===Anime===

The games were adapted into an anime series titled &quot;MegaMan NT Warrior&quot;, which premiered in Japan on March 4, 2002, and concluded on September 30, 2006, lasting 209 episodes; the English dub of the series was handled by Viz Media, who outsourced the voice acting to the Ocean Group. It lasted for five series, subtitled &quot;EXE&quot;, &quot;Axess&quot;, &quot;Stream&quot;, &quot;Beast&quot; and &quot;Beast+&quot;, although only &quot;EXE&quot; and &quot;Axess&quot; would be dubbed into English. An alternate English dub by Voiceovers Unlimited would air in South-East Asian countries, which followed the Japanese script more closely, and lacked the censorship &quot;NT Warrior&quot; had.

A film set during the events of &quot;Stream&quot;, &quot;Rockman.EXE the Movie: Program of Light and Darkness&quot;, premiered in Japanese theatres on March 12, 2005, as a double-billing with the &quot;Duel Masters&quot; film &quot;Duel Masters: Curse of the Deathphoenix&quot;. The film grossed a total of US$6,178,840 within three weeks of its release.

===Manga===

Two separate manga series were created by Shogakukan and published in their monthly magazine CoroCoro Comics; &quot;MegaMan NT Warrior&quot; by Ryo Takamisaki which lasted for 13 volumes, and &quot;Battle Story MegaMan NT Warrior&quot; by Keijima Jun and Miho Asada which consisted of 4 volumes. Viz Media would release &quot;MegaMan NT Warrior&quot; in North America between 2004 and 2008, while &quot;Battle Story&quot; only saw a release in Japan, Indonesia and certain European countries.

===Board game===
In 2004, Capcom released &quot;Rockman.EXE: Catan&quot;, a licensed version of &quot;The Settlers of Catan&quot; with the &quot;Battle Network&quot; motif. The game came in standard and portable types, with the portable version being magnetic.

<text>The Dyson Perrins Laboratory is in the science area of the University of Oxford and was the main centre for research into organic chemistry of the University from its foundation in 1916 until its closure as a research laboratory in 2003. Until 2018, parts of the building were used as teaching laboratories in which undergraduate students were trained in practical organic chemistry.

It was founded with an endowment from Charles Dyson Perrins, heir to the Lea &amp; Perrins Worcestershire sauce company, and stands on the north side of South Parks Road in Oxford.

==Notable chemists==
The heads of the laboratory were the four consecutive Waynflete Professors of Chemistry:

# William Henry Perkin, Jr., from 1912 to 1929;
# Sir Robert Robinson, from 1930 to 1954. Nobel Prize winner, 1947;
# Sir Ewart Jones, from 1954 to 1978;
# Sir Jack Baldwin, from 1978 to 2003.

During its 87-year working life, the laboratory had an extremely distinguished career; it can claim a stake in shaping the scientific careers of two Nobel Laureates, namely Lord Todd (1957) and Sir John W. Cornforth (1975) who passed their formative years as young chemists in the laboratories.

==History and present use==

The building of the laboratory began in 1913 and was finished in 1916 to the designs of Paul Waterhouse, the contractors being Armitage and Hodgson of Leeds. Funding came in part from C. W. Dyson Perrins of Queen&#x27;s College. In 1920–22 an eastern wing was added as contemplated in the original design, this was followed in 1934 by an extension for medical students and in 1940–41 a new brick wing to the north was built.

Research in organic chemistry at Oxford is now conducted across South Parks Road at the University&#x27;s state-of-the-art Chemistry Research Laboratory. The majority of the building has been handed over to the Oxford University Geography Department for the establishment of the Oxford University Centre for the Environment (OUCE).

<doc id="1150960" wikidata="Q7530733" url="?curid=1150960" title="Sis Cunningham">
<text>Agnes &quot;Sis&quot; Cunningham (February 19, 1909 – June 27, 2004) was an American musician, best known for her involvement as a performer and publicist of folk music and protest songs. She was the founding editor of &quot;Broadside&quot; magazine, which she published with her husband Gordon Friesen and their daughters.

==Early life==
Agnes Cunningham was born in Blaine County, Oklahoma, United States, the daughter of Ada Boyce and William Cunningham, a small holding farmer and fiddler. Her father was a socialist and follower of Eugene Debs, the socialist leader. As a child, she learned piano, accordion, and musical arrangement. In 1929, she attended the Weatherford (Oklahoma) Teachers&#x27; College where she studied music. After graduating from Weatherford Teachers&#x27; College, Agnes Cunningham worked in the public school system teaching music. In 1932, Cunningham went on to the Commonwealth Labor College near Mena, Arkansas, where she studied labor organizing and Marxism. During her time there, Agnes Cunningham also studied labor journalism and labor-farmer union development as well as learned about social theatre. During this time, she started to write labor songs. Completing her coursework and moving back to Oklahoma, Agnes Cunningham began recruiting for the Southern Tenant Farmers&#x27; Union.

==Career==
In 1937, she became a music teacher at the Southern Labor School for Women in North Carolina. She taught politically oriented music, including labor-union standards, political songs such as those written by Bertholt Brecht and Hanns Eisler, and topical songs, including some of her own original compositions.

In late 1939, she was a founding member of the Red Dust Players, an agit-prop group in Oklahoma, that promoted propaganda and political agitation through short plays. Performing throughout the countryside in Oklahoma at union meetings, the Red Dust Players sought to educate tenant-farmers, sharecroppers, and farm workers on how the union could benefit them. Fleeing harassment, she and fellow Communist Party member Gordon Friesen married on July 23, 1941, in the course of fleeing to New York City.

In New York, they moved into the Greenwich Village household known as Almanac House: housemates included Pete Seeger and Woody Guthrie, and Cunningham was briefly a member of the Almanac Singers, appearing on the 1942 album &quot;Dear Mr. President&quot; for Keynote Records. After attempting unsuccessfully to start a Detroit, Michigan, equivalent of the Almanacs, she took a job in a defense plant, while Friesen went to work as a reporter for the &quot;Detroit Times&quot;.

In 1945, Agnes Cunningham was on the founding committee of People&#x27;s Songs, an organization founded on December 31, 1945 in New York City by Pete Seeger, Alan Lomax, Lee Hays and many others. People&#x27;s Songs went bankrupt in 1948, but the People&#x27;s Songs Bulletin served as a template for Broadside Magazine that was later co-founded by Agnes Cunningham.

Sis Cunningham was also a songwriter: her &quot;How Can You Keep on Movin&#x27; (Unless You Migrate Too)?&quot; found its way into the New Lost City Ramblers&#x27; 1959 album &quot;Songs of the Depression&quot;, and following them, Ry Cooder also recorded it, as a strident march, on his album &quot;Into the Purple Valley&quot;; Cooder was unaware of its authorship and attributed it as &quot;Traditional&quot; until the omission was pointed out to him; he and the label corrected the attribution on later pressings.

Her Dust Bowl tale, &quot;My Oklahoma Home&quot;, written with her brother Bill Cunningham, was performed by Seeger in 1961, fell into oblivion, and then was revived by Bruce Springsteen in 2006 for his &quot;We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions&quot; album and subsequent Seeger Sessions Band Tour.

A lasting contribution of Sis Cunningham and Gordon Friesen was to publish a little magazine for 26 years: &quot;Broadside&quot;, which printed the words and music to newly written folk and topical songs by Bob Dylan, Malvina Reynolds, Phil Ochs, Janis Ian, Tom Paxton, Buffy Sainte-Marie, and many others. Recordings of songs that had been published in their magazine were collected in 2000 in a five-CD set, &quot;The Best of Broadside&quot;, on Smithsonian Folkways, which received two Grammy Award nominations.

Despite Agnes Cunningham being out of the music scene for years, she and her husband were able to start &quot;Broadside&quot; when Seeger provided them with a subsidy for the endeavor in 1962. Agnes and her husband started &quot;Broadside&quot;, mimeographing it on a machine inherited from the American Labour Party. The couple had to smuggle out copies of &quot;Broadside&quot; because the housing project that they lived in did not allow domestic commercial ventures. Many young musicians, including Dylan, Phil Ochs, Gil Turner, and many more, recorded tunes inside Agnes Cunningham&#x27;s family apartment. She would transcribe the songs, both lyrics and musical notation, while Gordon Friesen wrote the commentary. Even though &quot;Broadside&quot;&#x27;s circulation did not surpass four figures, it became influential across the country.

Cunningham continued to be politically active, taking part in events such as hootenannies, despite her advancing age. She and &quot;Broadside&quot; continued to influence and inspire topical music, with &quot;Broadside&quot; reaching its apex around 1970.

==1945 to 1962==
After World War II, Cunningham and Friesen were among the first victims of the anti-communist blacklist. She secured a few bookings as part of the roster of Pete Seeger&#x27;s booking agency, People&#x27;s Songs, but between ill health, trying to raise a family in poverty, and personal depression, she largely fell out of the music world for over a decade.

In 1962, Cunningham reemerged into the public eye as the founding editor of &quot;Broadside&quot; magazine. This magazine published the songs of many of the 1960s&#x27; most influential topical songwriters, including Bob Dylan, Phil Ochs, Janis Ian, Tom Paxton, The Freedom Singers, Buffy Sainte Marie, Len Chandler, and Malvina Reynolds. Although the magazine, in John Pietaro&#x27;s words &quot;a vital part of the folk revival&quot;, survived until 1988, it was always a shoestring operation — several times, subsidies from Pete Seeger and his wife Toshi Seeger kept it afloat. Among its legacies was a five-CD box set called &quot;The Best of Broadside, 1962–1988&quot;.

In 1976, Folkways Records released &quot;Broadside Ballads, Vol. 9: Sundown&quot;, Cunningham&#x27;s only solo album on the label (though she had been featured on several other albums, including Seeger&#x27;s &quot;Broadside Ballads, Vol.&quot; and Phil Ochs&#x27; &quot;Broadside Tapes 1&quot;).

==Later years==
During most of their later lives, Cunningham and Friesen lived on West 98th Street in Manhattan, with their daughter Jane Friesen, grand daughter Ellie Thomas, and great grandson Nicholas Toth. Toward the end of their lives they wrote a &quot;joint autobiography&quot;, &quot;Red Dust and Broadsides&quot;. Friesen died in 1996, and Cunningham followed in June 2004.

<doc id="1150961" wikidata="Q229762" url="?curid=1150961" title="3GP and 3G2">
<text>3GP (3GPP file format) is a multimedia container format defined by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) for 3G UMTS multimedia services.

3G2 (3GPP2 file format) is a multimedia container format defined by the 3GPP2 for 3G CDMA2000 multimedia services. It is very similar to the 3GP file format but consumes less space &amp; bandwidth, and has some extensions and limitations in comparison to 3GP.

==Specifications==

3GP is defined in the ETSI 3GPP technical specification. 3GP is a required file format for video and associated speech/audio media types and timed text in ETSI 3GPP technical specifications for IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS), Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS) and Transparent end-to-end Packet-switched Streaming Service (PSS).

3G2 is defined in the 3GPP2 technical specification.

==Technical details==
The 3GP and 3G2 file formats are both structurally based on the ISO base media file format defined in ISO/IEC 14496-12 – MPEG-4 Part 12, but older versions of the 3GP file format did not use some of its features. 3GP and 3G2 are container formats similar to MPEG-4 Part 14 (MP4), which is also based on MPEG-4 Part 12. The 3GP and 3G2 file format were designed to decrease storage and bandwidth requirements to accommodate mobile phones. They are good for lower end smartphones for faster streaming &amp; download.

3GP and 3G2 are similar standards, but with some differences:
* 3GPP file format was designed for GSM-based phones and may have the filename extension .3gp
* 3GPP2 file format was designed for CDMA-based phones and may have the filename extension .3g2

Some cell phones use the .mp4 extension for 3GP video.

===3GP===
The 3GP file format stores video streams as MPEG-4 Part 2, H.263, or MPEG-4 Part 10 (AVC/H.264), and audio streams as AMR-NB, AMR-WB, AMR-WB+, AAC-LC, HE-AAC v1 or Enhanced aacPlus (HE-AAC v2). 3GPP allowed use of AMR and H.263 codecs in the ISO base media file format (MPEG-4 Part 12), because 3GPP specified the usage of the Sample Entry and template fields in the ISO base media file format as well as defining new boxes to which codecs refer. These extensions were registered by the registration authority for code-points in ISO base media file format (&quot;MP4 Family&quot; files). 

For the storage of MPEG-4 media specific information in 3GP files, the 3GP specification refers to MP4 and the AVC file format, which are also based on the ISO base media file format. The MP4 and the AVC file format specifications described usage of MPEG-4 content in the ISO base media file format.

A 3GP file is always big-endian, storing and transferring the most significant bytes first. 

===3G2===
The 3G2 file format can store the same video streams and most of the audio streams used in the 2007 3GP file format. In addition, 3G2 stores audio streams as EVRC, EVRC-B, EVRC-WB, 13K (QCELP), SMV or VMR-WB, which was specified by 3GPP2 for use in ISO base media file format. The 3G2 specification also defined some enhancements to 3GPP Timed Text. 3G2 file format does not store Enhanced aacPlus (HE-AAC v2) and AMR-WB+ audio streams. For the storage of MPEG-4 media (AAC audio, MPEG-4 Part 2 video, MPEG-4 Part 10 – H.264/AVC) in 3G2 files, the 3G2 specification refers to the MP4 file format and the AVC file format specification, which described usage of this content in the ISO base media file format. For the storage of H.263 and AMR content 3G2 specification refers to the 3GP file format specification.

==Device support==
*Most 3G capable mobile phones support the playback and recording of video in 3GP format (memory, maximum filesize for playback and recording, and resolution limits exist and vary).
*Some newer/higher-end phones without 3G capabilities may also playback and record in this format (again, with said limitations).
*Audio imported from CD onto a PlayStation 3 when it is set to encode to the MPEG-4 AAC format copies onto USB devices in the 3GP format. 
*The Nintendo 3DS used 3GP technology to play YouTube videos.
*Apple iDevices used to support files for playback only as passthrough files, hence no editing ability, but since iOS 9 this has been deprecated meaning files of this format have to be manually converted to H.264.

==Software support==
When transferred to a computer, 3GP movies can be viewed on Microsoft Windows, Apple macOS, and the various Linux-based operating systems; on the former two with Windows Media Player and Apple QuickTime respectively (their built-in media players), and on all three with VLC media player. Programs such as Media Player Classic, K-Multimedia Player, Totem, RealPlayer, MPlayer, and GOM Player can also be used.

3GP and 3G2 files can be encoded and decoded with open source software FFmpeg. Media tags can be read and written on Linux, macOS and Windows using the open source AtomicParsley command-line utility.

<text>William Francis &quot;Bo&quot; Ryan Jr. (born December 20, 1947) is an American former college basketball coach. He was the head coach of the Wisconsin Badgers men&#x27;s basketball team of the University of Wisconsin–Madison from 2001 to December 2015. Ryan served as the head men&#x27;s basketball coach at the University of Wisconsin–Platteville from 1984 to 1999 and at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee from 1999 to 2001. His overall collegiate coaching record was 747–233. Ryan was inducted into the College Basketball Hall of Fame in 2017 and the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2024.

==Playing career==
Ryan began playing basketball at a very young age. His father, Butch Ryan was already a legend in the area, coaching youth sports including basketball to under-privileged children in Chester, Pennsylvania. Butch taught him the skills to be a successful point guard, generally the position of the on-court team leader. He became a star basketball player, leading his high school team to a 25–1 record in his senior year. In addition to basketball, Ryan was a high school quarterback. The center snapping him the ball was Ted Cottrell, who later served as a defensive coach and coordinator for a number of teams in the NFL. Ryan lettered in football, basketball and baseball, and was president of his class. After high school, Ryan starred as a point guard at Wilkes College in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. His love for the game drove him to remain involved with the sport, choosing to delve into the coaching profession.

==Coaching career==

===Early years===
After a playing career at Wilkes University, Ryan graduated in 1969, and began graduate work, attending Villanova University in Villanova, Pennsylvania.

Ryan&#x27;s coaching career began in 1972 at Brookhaven Junior High School in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, where for one year he worked as a history teacher and basketball head coach.

In 1973, Ryan began his collegiate coaching career at Dominican College of Racine in Racine, Wisconsin. He won a Coach of the Year award as head baseball coach at Dominican while serving as an assistant basketball coach under Bill Cofield. In 1974, Dominican College closed down. Ryan then became head basketball coach at Sun Valley High School in Aston, Pennsylvania in 1974, where he was named conference coach of the year in 1976.

His success at Dominic College and Sun Valley led to a job as assistant head coach at the University of Wisconsin–Madison under head coaches Bill Cofield and Steve Yoder from 1976 to 1984.

===Wisconsin–Platteville (1984–1999)===
After his stint as an assistant, Ryan accepted the head coaching position at the University of Wisconsin–Platteville. From 1984 until 1999, Ryan&#x27;s Platteville team posted a 352–76 overall record, an .820 winning percentage. Ryan guided the UW–Platteville Pioneers to four national championships (1991, 1995, 1998 and 1999). He also won eight Wisconsin Intercollegiate Athletic Conference championships and set a Division III scoring defense record in 1997, with his team only allowing 47.5 points per game.

During Ryan&#x27;s tenure, UW-Platteville was the winningest NCAA men&#x27;s basketball team of the 1990s (all divisions) with a 266–26 (.908) record.

On January 27, 2007, UW-Platteville officially honored Ryan&#x27;s 15-year tenure by naming the playing surface at Williams Fieldhouse &quot;Bo Ryan Court&quot;. Ryan, along with the 2007 Wisconsin Badgers team, attended the event.

===Wisconsin–Milwaukee (1999–2001)===
On the strength of his success at Platteville, Ryan was hired as head coach at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee for the 1999–2000 season. In his two seasons as coach, the team had its first back-to-back winning seasons in nearly a decade. Ryan also brought a 161 percent increase in home attendance at UWM, giving the program a new energy that continued into the tenure of his successor Bruce Pearl.

=== Wisconsin–Madison (2001–2015) ===
Following the Badgers&#x27; 2000 Final Four run, head coach Dick Bennett retired two games into the 2000–01 season. Assistant coach Brad Soderberg finished the season as interim head coach, but was not considered for the full-time job. The coaching search began to concentrate on Rick Majerus of the University of Utah (who was a Milwaukee native) and Bo Ryan. After Majerus pulled his name out of consideration, UW athletic director Pat Richter made the decision to hire Ryan as Wisconsin&#x27;s 13th head coach.

Ryan&#x27;s first season was much more successful than anticipated. The team was predicted to finish as low as ninth in the Big Ten in pre-season polls. The team, led by Kirk Penney, surprisingly finished in a four-way tie for the Big Ten regular-season title and received an invitation to the NCAA tournament. In the 2002–03 season, the Badgers won their first outright Big Ten regular season title in 56 years and advanced to the &quot;Sweet Sixteen&quot; in the NCAA Tournament. The Badgers won the Big Ten tournament Championship in 2004, led by Devin Harris, and once again received an NCAA Tournament invitation. In the 2004–05 season, Wisconsin advanced to the &quot;Elite Eight&quot; in the NCAA Tournament, losing to the eventual national champion North Carolina Tar Heels. On December 10, 2005, Ryan recorded his 100th victory as Wisconsin head coach by defeating in-state rival Marquette.

In the 2006–07 season, Ryan led the Badgers to the pinnacle of college basketball, helping them achieve their first top-five ranking and #1 ranking in the AP poll in the school&#x27;s history. However, the Badgers&#x27; time atop the poll was short-lived as they lost their next game, against Michigan State before losing to Ohio State in a #1 vs. #2 matchup. The Wisconsin–Ohio State game on February 25, 2007, featured two teams ranked #1 in that week&#x27;s national polls, with Ohio State securing the top ranking in the Coaches&#x27; Poll and clinching the regular season Big Ten title. The following week they rebounded with a 52–50 win at home over Michigan State and again defeated Michigan State in the Big Ten tournament, before losing the Big Ten tournament championship game to Ohio State. In 2007, Ryan was named the winner of the Clair Bee Coach of the Year Award. A year later, the Badgers notched their most wins ever in Big Ten play (16) en route to a school-record 31 wins.

On December 12, 2009, Ryan recorded his 200th victory as Wisconsin head coach by defeating in-state rival Marquette, 72–63 at the Kohl Center.

On January 24, 2010, Ryan recorded his 100th Big Ten Conference victory by defeating Penn State, 79–71 at the Kohl Center. With that victory, Ryan became the 2nd fastest coach to reach that milestone, tying Ryan with Branch McCracken who both needed 140 games to reach the 100th conference victory. The only coach to reach the 100th conference win faster was Bob Knight, who only needed 131 games.

On March 9, 2012, in the 2012 Big Ten Conference men&#x27;s basketball tournament quarterfinals the Badgers defeated the Hoosiers, giving Ryan his 266th win at Wisconsin and vaulting him past Bud Foster to become the winningest coach in school history.

On December 4, 2013, Ryan won his 300th game at Wisconsin during a 48–38 victory over Virginia becoming only the ninth Big Ten head coach to win 300 games.

On March 14, 2014, Ryan got his 700th victory during an 83–57 win over Minnesota in the 2014 Big Ten tournament. On March 29, 2014, during the 2014 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament, Ryan reached his first Division I Final Four with a 64–63 overtime win over Arizona.

On January 8, 2015, the Badgers defeated Purdue 62–55 giving Ryan his 159th Big Ten victory, passing Walter Meanwell for most Big Ten conference victories in UW history.

On February 14, 2015, Ryan was named a finalist to be considered for election in the Class of 2015 for the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.

On April 6, 2015, after losing the 2015 NCAA Championship game to Duke 68–63, Ryan&#x27;s immediate post game interview with CBS&#x27; Tracy Wolfson implied that the officiating was the reason for his team&#x27;s loss. For the game, Duke was called for 13 fouls while the Badgers were called for 15.

On December 15, 2015, Ryan announced his retirement as head coach of the Badgers.

Ryan has written three books: &quot;Bo Ryan: Another Hill to Climb&quot;, &quot;The Swing Offense&quot;, and &quot;Passing and Catching: the Lost Art&quot;. He led the Badgers to the NCAA Tournament in each of his 14 full seasons at Wisconsin; the team had only been to a total of seven NCAA Tournaments before Ryan&#x27;s arrival (three of them under Bennett). He also owns all four of Wisconsin&#x27;s 30-win seasons.

He coached the Badgers to the NCAA Final Four two years in a row, falling to Kentucky, 74–73, in the 2014 semifinals in Arlington, Texas, and to Duke, 68–63, in the championship game on April 6, 2015, in Indianapolis.

On June 29, 2015, Ryan announced that he would retire after the 2015–16 season, naming associate head coach Greg Gard, who had been on Ryan&#x27;s staff at both UW-Platteville and Milwaukee, as his preferred successor. A month and a half later, Ryan announced he was &quot;not totally sure&quot; whether or not he would retire. On December 15, 2015, Ryan announced his retirement after a win against Texas A&amp;M–Corpus Christi, effective immediately, and Gard took over for the rest of the season.

==Personal life==
Ryan and his wife, Kelly, have five children: Megan, Will, Matt, Brenna and Mairin. Ryan also has 10 grandchildren: Aoife, Imogen, Maeve, Owen, Liam, Callen, Roen, Remi, Finn and Ryan.

Shortly after the Badgers&#x27; loss in the 2015 NCAA title game, there was speculation Ryan would retire when he and his wife put their home in Madison up for sale. At a charity fundraiser, he explained that they had chosen to downsize now that their children were all adults and out of the house, and had bought a condo near the Badgers&#x27; home of the Kohl Center. The house was ultimately purchased by new Wisconsin football head coach Paul Chryst.

In 2016, Ryan admitted to having an affair with a massage therapist. An investigation ensued concerning whether Ryan improperly used school resources during the course of the tryst. He was eventually cleared.

<doc id="1150982" wikidata="Q6639436" url="?curid=1150982" title="List of shopping malls in Toronto">
<text>Toronto has several shopping malls across the city, including five major destination malls that are among the largest and most profitable in Canada. The first enclosed shopping mall in Toronto was the Toronto Arcade in the downtown core. The first shopping mall of the enclosed, automobile-centred design type was Yorkdale Shopping Centre, which opened in 1964.

==Major shopping centres==
Toronto&#x27;s five major shopping centres each have over one hundred stores and are anchored by multiple department stores, international brands and luxury retailers. They are also the five largest malls in Toronto by floor space. Each provides thousands of automobile parking spaces. With the exceptions of Sherway Gardens and Scarborough Town Centre, all of these malls have direct pedestrian connections with the Toronto subway system, though Sherway Gardens has a bus terminal connecting Toronto Transit Commission and MiWay bus routes and Scarborough Town Centre was connected to Scarborough Centre station of Line 3 Scarborough until the line&#x27;s permanent closure in July 2023, though the former station still has an active bus terminal. Yorkdale Shopping Centre is Toronto&#x27;s first of its kind and was the world&#x27;s largest shopping mall at the time of opening, while Toronto Eaton Centre is the most visited shopping mall in North America. These five malls were completed within a 13-year span in the 1960s and 1970s. The five malls are owned by either Cadillac Fairview or Oxford Properties, two of Canada&#x27;s largest commercial real estate investment companies. A sixth major mall is planned by Cadillac Fairview in Toronto&#x27;s planned East Harbour neighbourhood by the intersection of Don Valley Parkway and Gardiner Expressway / Lake Shore Boulevard and be also served by the planned East Harbour Transit Hub on the Ontario Line and GO Transit&#x27;s Lakeshore East line.

==District or neighbourhood shopping centres==
The district or neighbourhood level of shopping centres in Toronto are typically built around one or a few department stores or grocery supermarkets and are enclosed. These shopping centres typically provide a surrounding free parking lot. Most of these are located in the suburbs of Toronto, where land was available for parking. There are only two shopping malls of this type within Toronto&#x27;s pre-1998 city limits: Dufferin Mall (on Dufferin Street south of Bloor Street and north of College Street) and Gerrard Square (on Gerrard Street East east of Pape Avenue and west of Jones Avenue). The third shopping mall in Old Toronto, Galleria Shopping Centre (at Dufferin Street and Dupont Street), was demolished in January 2020 and is being replaced with condo developments. There are a few ethnic malls of this type as well. Woodbine Centre has Fantasy Fair, a small year-round indoor amusement park.

==Malls located within major office buildings and condominium towers==
One configuration of shopping mall in Toronto is the self-contained type located within a commercial office building, sometimes around a central atrium. This type typically does not provide a surrounding parking lot. These malls typically house from a dozen to several dozen stores. Most of these are connected to a station of the Toronto subway system. In the case of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Centre, the mall connects the department store to the Toronto subway system at Bloor–Yonge station. Some of these malls can be located in the taller condominium towers. These malls are located in the core (Old Toronto), unless marked otherwise:

Originally a strip plaza, it was enclosed in 1978 and expanded from 400,000 to 462,000 square feet (37,000 to 43,000 m2). Closed and demolished in 2006, it was replaced by Shops at Don Mills in 2009. CF operated a shuttle bus service to Fairview Mall until it opened. Former Dominion (now Metro) and the Royal Bank Building are the only remaining buildings that were once part of the old mall.

* Golden Mile Plaza (1954–1986) at Eglinton Avenue East and Victoria Park Avenue, demolished after the 1986 fire and later replaced with a power centre named Golden Mile Mall.
* Honeydale Mall (1973–2013): Located in Eatonville neighbourhood of Toronto; officially closed on 28 June 2013.
* Morningside Mall (1979–2007) at Morningside Avenue and Kingston Road, Scarborough; the indoor mall was demolished to make way for an outdoor big box plaza called Morningside Crossing

Most stores closed by 2003 and demolition of south end in 2004 with north end of mall retained (with an Asian supermarket and a few small stores). Since 2004, its south end was redeveloped as an outdoor mall with Wal-Mart Supercentre as a stand-alone big box store.
* Warden Woods Mall or Warden Power Centre (1981–2005) at Warden Avenue north of St. Clair Avenue East near Warden station, Scarborough was a full mall with three anchor stores (The Bay, Simpson&#x27;s and a Knob Hill Farms grocery store) and later as clearance centre. It has since been demolished and replaced with townhouses.
* Weston-Finch Mall (1960s–2006), Weston Road and Finch Avenue West, North York — former strip mall (with Zellers, Canadian Tire and McDonald&#x27;s as tenants) and later as outlet facility; demolished 2006 and vacant lot awaiting redevelopment for rental apartments.

* The original Yonge Street Arcade (1884–1954) at 137 Yonge Street and consisting of 52 stores was considered Canada&#x27;s first indoor mall. It was demolished in 1954 following two fires and was replaced in 1960 by the Arcade Building, which had a similar arcade-style concourse on its main floor until 2008 when the floor was redeveloped with the arcade being replaced with a fitness centre and offices.

<doc id="1150990" wikidata="Q16251931" url="?curid=1150990" title="Toronto External Contracts Inquiry">
<text>The Toronto External Contracts Inquiry is a judicial inquiry into allegations of conflict of interest around contracts entered into by Toronto, Ontario&#x27;s municipal government in 1998 and 1999.

It is a follow-up to the city&#x27;s earlier Computer Leasing Inquiry, and is investigating three other questionable contracts. However, as with the earlier inquiry, the External Contracts Inquiry is commissioned by Madam Justice Denise Bellamy of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice.

The External Contracts Inquiry was established by Toronto City Council on October 1, 2002, as an expansion of the Computer Leasing Inquiry. It began hearings on October 18, 2004, after the Computer Leasing Inquiry ended.

==TMACS==
The first contract investigated by the External Contracts Inquiry involved the city&#x27;s tax and billing management system.

On January 1, 1998, the city of Toronto and its five suburban cities (Scarborough, North York, Etobicoke, East York and York) were amalgamated into the single &quot;megacity&quot; of Toronto.

During the amalgamation process, the six municipal governments had to merge their computer systems. Five of the municipalities used a system called TXM, while North York used a system called TMACS. North York&#x27;s treasurer, Wanda Liczyk, was the sole voice in favour of adopting TMACS for the amalgamated city, and when she subsequently became treasurer of the &quot;megacity&quot;, she implemented TMACS without consulting city council.

TMACS was developed for North York&#x27;s city government by two American software consultants, David Maxson and Michael Saunders. Testimony before the inquiry has confirmed that from 1989 to 1991, Saunders and Liczyk had a personal romantic relationship.

Although their relationship ended before Saunders was contracted by the city of Toronto, city staff have testified that Liczyk and Saunders still had a close friendship. In her testimony to the inquiry, Liczyk has acknowledged that her relationship with Saunders may have created the appearance of favouritism in her decisions involving Saunders. However, in response to suggestions that she should have declared a conflict of interest and recused herself from such decisions, Liczyk has testified that she is able to separate personal and business matters.

It has also been testified that Saunders was often rude and abrasive to city staff.

==Other Contracts==
Two other city contracts will be investigated by the Inquiry. Testimony around these contracts has not yet been presented.

<text>Nicolaus II Bernoulli (also spelled as Niklaus or Nikolaus; 6 February 1695 in Basel – 31 July 1726 in Saint Petersburg) was a Swiss mathematician as were his father Johann Bernoulli and one of his brothers, Daniel Bernoulli. He was one of the many prominent mathematicians in the Bernoulli family.

==Work==
Nicolaus worked mostly on curves, differential equations, and probability. He was a friend and contemporary of Leonhard Euler, who studied under Nicolaus&#x27; father. He also contributed to fluid dynamics.

He was older brother of Daniel Bernoulli, to whom he also taught mathematics. Even in his youth he had learned several languages. From the age of 13, he studied mathematics and law at the University of Basel. In 1711 he received his Master&#x27;s of Philosophy; in 1715 he received a Doctorate in Law. In 1716-17 he was a private tutor in Venice. From 1719 he had the Chair in Mathematics at the University of Padua, as the successor of Giovanni Poleni. He served as an assistant to his father, among other areas, in the correspondence over the priority dispute between Isaac Newton and Leibniz, and also in the priority dispute between his father and the English mathematician Brook Taylor. In 1720 he posed the problem of reciprocal orthogonal trajectories, which was intended as a challenge for the English Newtonians. From 1723 he was a law professor at the Berner Oberen Schule. In 1725 he together with his brother Daniel, with whom he was touring Italy and France at this time, was invited by Peter the Great to the newly founded St. Petersburg Academy. Eight months after his appointment he came down with a fever and died. His professorship was succeeded in 1727 by Leonhard Euler, whom the Bernoulli brothers had recommended. His early death cut short a promising career.

<doc id="1151000" wikidata="Q5110409" url="?curid=1151000" title="Christian worldview">
<text>Christian worldview (also called biblical worldview) refers to the framework of ideas and beliefs through which a Christian individual, group or culture interprets the world and interacts with it. Various denominations of Christianity have differing worldviews on some issues based on biblical interpretation, but many thematic elements are commonly agreed-upon within the Christian worldview. 

==Definition==
According to Leo Apostel, a worldview is an ontology, or a descriptive model of the world. It should comprise these six elements:
# An explanation of the world 
# An eschatology, answering the question &quot;where are we heading?&quot; 
# Values, answers to ethical questions: &quot;What should we do?&quot; In this context, &quot;What would Jesus do?&quot;
# A praxeology, or methodology, or theory of action.: &quot;How should we attain our goals?&quot;
# An epistemology, or theory of knowledge. &quot;What is true and false?&quot; (See, for example John 18:38)
# An etiology. A constructed world-view should contain an account of its own &quot;building blocks,&quot; its origins and construction.

==Differing Christian worldviews==
Different denominations of Christianity have varying worldviews. There are varieties of particulars within the Christian worldview, and disputes of the meaning of concepts in a Christian worldview. Certain thematic elements are common within the Christian worldview. For instance, Northrop Frye indicated as the central clusters of the system of metaphors in the Bible – mountain, garden, and cave. A similar thematic representation of Christian worldview in the Reformed tradition has been formulated as Creation, Fall, Redemption and Consummation.

The symbolic term &quot;Christian worldview&quot; has been called a &quot;defining marker of American evangelical culture.&quot;

==Worldview vs. doctrine==
The U.S. use of the term &quot;worldview&quot; in Christian rhetoric can be traced to the evangelical Reformed philosopher H. Evan Runner of Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Runner used the term in his evangelical Reformed community in North America, promoting the worldview concept from a philosophical concept to a synonym for &quot;doctrine&quot;.

<doc id="1151005" wikidata="Q894874" url="?curid=1151005" title="Bottega Veneta">
<text>Bottega Veneta () is an Italian luxury fashion house based in Milan, Italy. Its product lines include ready-to-wear, handbags, shoes, accessories, jewellery and fragrances.

Bottega Veneta is headquartered in Milan, Italy, with its main atelier located in Montebello, Vicenza. It is part of the luxury group Kering. In 2023, Bottega Veneta&#x27;s revenue reached 1.6 billion euros.

== History ==

=== Foundation (1966–2001) ===
Bottega Veneta was established in 1966 in Vicenza, Italy by Michele Taddei and Renzo Zengiaro. Specialized in artisanal leather goods, the brand developed a distinctive leather weaving technique, the &quot;Intrecciato&quot;, which became Bottega Veneta&#x27;s signature look. This intricate method involves weaving strips of leather through slits in another piece of leather to create a durable and flexible textile. The technique enhances the strength of the leather and adds a unique aesthetic appeal to their products. This weaving technique has become synonymous with the brand. In 1972, Bottega Veneta opened its first store in the USA, in New York City. In the mid-1970s, the company started to make shoes.

Renzo Zengiaro left the company at the end of the 1970s. Soon after, Michele Taddei handed over the company to his ex-wife Laura Braggion, who headed the company with her second husband Vittorio Moltedo from then on. A 1978 two-page ad for Bottega Veneta - created by Andy Warhol Studio and published in the magazine &quot;Interview&quot; - introduced the brand&#x27;s tagline &quot;When your own initials are enough&quot;. In 1980, the actress Lauren Hutton carried a Bottega Veneta &quot;Intrecciato&quot; bag in the movie &quot;American Gigolo&quot;. In 1985, Andy Warhol made the short film &quot;Bottega Veneta Industrial Videotape&quot;.

During the 1990s, Bottega Veneta launched its first ready-to-wear collection. From 1995 to 2001 the head designer of Bottega Veneta was Edward Buchanan. He designed the first ready-to-wear collection and the first show was held in Milan in 1998.

=== Modernization (2001–2018) ===
In February 2001, Gucci a subsidiary of Kering, acquired Bottega Veneta for $156 million. Patrizio di Marco was appointed CEO and Tomas Maier creative director. In 2002, the brand launched a fashion jewelry line, followed by a fine jewelry line in 2006. By 2005, the company was profitable again. Bottega Veneta launched a women&#x27;s ready-to-wear collection in February 2005 and a menswear collection in June 2006. In January 2009, Marco Bizzarri succeeded to Patrizio di Marco as CEO of Bottega Veneta. In June 2011, Bottega Veneta launched its first women&#x27;s fragrance &quot;Eau de Parfum&quot;. From 2001 to 2010, Bottega Veneta&#x27;s sales grew 15-fold and reached the $1 billion mark in 2012. Vogue coined the term &quot;stealth wealth&quot; to describe the brand&#x27;s new style.

In 2013, Bottega Veneta moved its atelier from Vicenza to a historic 18th-century villa surrounded by a 590,000-square-foot park near Montebello Vicentino. The renovation of the property underwent a strict environmental process. Bottega Veneta also opened its first flagship store, a 11,448 square-foot boutique in a historical building on Via Sant&#x27;Andrea in Milan. In April 2014, Marco Bizzarri stepped down as CEO of Bottega Veneta and Carlo Alberto Beretta became the company&#x27;s new CEO in January 2015. In 2016, the brand&#x27;s second flagship store opened on North Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. The company announced it would unify its men and women&#x27;s shows. During the company&#x27;s 50th anniversary show at the Accademia di Brera, the Bottega Veneta clutch bag carried by Lauren Hutton in the 1980 movie &quot;American Gigolo&quot; was revived (and renamed &quot;The Lauren 1980&quot;). In October 2016, Claus-Dietrich Lahrs was appointed CEO of Bottega Veneta. In 2018, Bottega Veneta opened a 6-floor flagship store in Ginza, Tokyo, in a building designed as a tribute to the capital&#x27;s architectural modernism. In January 2018, Bottega Veneta opened a 15,000-square-foot store—its third flagship store—on the corner of Madison and 64th Street in New York City. In June 2018, Tomas Maier stepped down as creative director of Bottega Veneta.

=== Renewal (since 2018) ===

Kering appointed Daniel Lee as creative director of Bottega Veneta in June 2018 and Bartolomeo Rongone as CEO in June 2019. In November 2019, the company opened its first store in Miami. In 2019, Bottega Veneta won four awards during the British Fashion Awards. On 2021, Bottega Veneta shut down its social media accounts and created the digital journal &quot;Issued by Bottega&quot; to communicate with clients, influencers, collaborators, and fans. Monthly fashion shows were replaced by private staged trunk shows called &quot;Salons&quot; with industrial setups and guest performers. In April 2021, the Berlin police investigated Bottega Veneta&#x27;s Salon afterparty following the show held at Berghain pursuant to social distancing and masking laws during the COVID-19 pandemic. On 10 November 2021, Daniel Lee left his post as creative director.

In late 2021, Kering appointed Matthieu Blazy, former design director at Bottega Veneta, as the new creative director of the company. Under Blazy, Bottega Veneta returned to the Milan Fashion Show. Blazy brought an inclusive management style, shrank the design team, and got the craftspeople involved in the creative process. He introduced the trompe-l&#x27;œil denim leather pants (2021), the &quot;intrecciato&quot;-woven handbags Kalimero (2022) and Andiamo (2023), and the knitted leather sock-slippers (2023). He was dubbed the &quot;Magician of Milan&quot; by Vanessa Friedman. In September 2023, the brand opened its flagship store in Paris on avenue Montaigne, the first designed by Blazy. In February 2024, the brand opened its third store in Milan, in the historic Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II. Later in June, Bottega opened a new store at the Rosewood Miramar Beach.

In December 2024, Bottega Veneta announced Matthieu Blazy&#x27;s departure and the hiring of Louise Trotter as the next creative director of the company. Previously, Trotter was creative director at French label Carven. Prior to her time at Carven, she was the first female creative director of Lacoste.

<text>, or simply or , is the moon kami in Japanese mythology and the Shinto religion. The name &quot;Tsukuyomi&quot; is a compound of the Old Japanese words and . The &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; mentions this name spelled as , but this &quot;yumi&quot; is likely a variation in pronunciation of &quot;yomi&quot;. An alternative interpretation is that his name is a combination of and . &quot;-no-Mikoto&quot; is a common honorific appended to the names of Kami; it may be understood as similar to the English honorific &#x27;the Great&#x27;.

There is so little known about Tsukuyomi that even their sex is unknown. Still, in &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot;, Tsukuyomi&#x27;s name is sometimes rendered as , implying that he is male.

==Myth==
Tsukuyomi was the second of the born when Izanagi-no-Mikoto, the kami who created the first land of Onogoroshima, was cleansing himself of his kegare while bathing after escaping the underworld and the clutches of his enraged dead sister, Izanami-no-Mikoto. Tsukuyomi was born when he washed out of Izanagi&#x27;s right eye. However, in an alternative story, Tsukuyomi was born from a mirror made of white copper in Izanagi&#x27;s right hand.

Tsukuyomi angered Amaterasu (who in some sources was his wife) when he killed Ukemochi, the megami of food. Amaterasu once sent Tsukuyomi to represent her at a feast presented by Ukemochi. The megami created the food by turning to the ocean and spitting out a fish, then facing a forest and spitting out game, and finally turning to a rice paddy and coughing up a bowl of rice. Tsukuyomi was utterly disgusted by the manner of which the exquisite-looking meal was made in, so he killed her.

Amaterasu learned what happened and she was so angry that she refused to ever look at Tsukuyomi again, forever moving to another part of the sky. This is the reason that day and night are never together. This is according to one of the accounts in the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;. Tsukuyomi does not have such significance in the &quot;Kojiki&quot;, in which there is a similar tale about Susanoo-no-Mikoto killing a similar food megami named Ōgetsuhime, who is often conflated with Ukemochi.

<doc id="1151011" wikidata="Q494913" url="?curid=1151011" title="Dalian Atkinson">
<text>Dalian Robert Atkinson (21 March 1968 – 15 August 2016) was an English professional footballer who played as a striker.

During his club football career, he played in England for Ipswich Town, Sheffield Wednesday, Aston Villa and Manchester City, winning the Football League Cup at Villa in 1994 where he also played in the Premier League. He also played in Spain for Real Sociedad, in France for Metz, in Turkey for Fenerbahçe, in Saudi Arabia for Al-Ittihad, and in South Korea for Daejeon Hana Citizen and Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors. He was capped once at England B level, scoring a goal in that single appearance.

Atkinson died on 15 August 2016. He was near his father&#x27;s house in Trench, Telford, where he had grown up. Officers of West Mercia Police, who had responded to a call, fired a taser at him and one officer kicked him in the head. Atkinson went into cardiac arrest. The police officer who killed him was later found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to eight years in prison.

==Club career==

===Early career===
Atkinson first came to prominence at Ipswich Town as a teenager, impressing seasoned experts with his speed and daring, which included a hat-trick against a Middlesbrough side containing Gary Pallister and future Ipswich captain Tony Mowbray at the heart of their defence, in the 1987–88 season.

In 1989, manager Ron Atkinson (no relation) brought him to Sheffield Wednesday for £450,000 where he formed a fine front partnership with David Hirst for a single season. He was an ever-present in the league for Sheffield Wednesday in his only season there, scoring 10 goals but being unable to prevent them from being relegated.

After relegation he was sold to Real Sociedad for £1.7 million. The San Sebastián-based team had recently broken a tradition of only signing local players in order to bring British player Kevin Richardson and Ireland international John Aldridge to the club, making Atkinson their third foreigner and also the first black player in their history. He was nicknamed &quot;El txipiron&quot; (The squid) by Sociedad fans during the 1990–91 season. His team did not have a good year, although Atkinson made a good contribution over the season, scoring 12 goals in La Liga. Atkinson was racially abused by opposition fans during his time in Spain.

===Aston Villa===
Atkinson joined Aston Villa for £1.6 million in July 1991, and became one half of another impressive partnership alongside Dean Saunders, when Saunders arrived from Liverpool a year after Atkinson arrived there from Real Sociedad. The partnership was broken up in 1995 when both players were sold to Turkish clubs – Saunders to Galatasaray and Atkinson to Fenerbahçe for £1.7 million.

On 15 August 1992, Atkinson scored Villa&#x27;s first ever Premier League goal, a 84-minute equaliser in a 1–1 away draw against Ipswich Town. He is probably most often remembered for his magnificent solo goal against Wimbledon in a 3–2 away win on 3 October 1992, which won &quot;Match of the Day&quot;&#x27;s Goal of the Season award for the 1992–93 season, the first season of the new FA Premier League, when Villa finished runners-up. Starting deep in the Aston Villa half of the pitch with a one-touch trap from a lofted ball that immediately took him away from a defending player, Atkinson then skipped past two more Wimbledon players and, pausing briefly as he reached the edge of the opposition penalty area, produced a delicately arched chip-shot that floated over the rushing goalkeeper. That goal&#x27;s celebration is still to this day well remembered by Aston Villa fans, on that rainy day fan Martin Pritchard had the impulse to jump from his seat, walk onto the field, and hold his umbrella up over the players.
Atkinson also had the distinction of scoring Villa&#x27;s first Premier League goal, when he scored their late equaliser in a 1–1 draw at Ipswich on the opening day of the season.

Atkinson is remembered by Aston Villa fans for his goal in the 1994 League Cup final win against Manchester United, and that he scored twice in the semi-finals against Tranmere Rovers (once in the first leg and once in the second).

===Later career===
Atkinson missed Villa&#x27;s departure for a 1994 pre-season tour of South Africa because of what was described as &quot;personal problems.&quot; When Ron Atkinson left and was replaced as manager by Brian Little, he fell out of favour. In July 1995, Atkinson arrived in Istanbul to agree a deal with Fenerbahçe S.K. Atkinson failed to settle in Turkey and had loan spells with Metz and Manchester City. Atkinson left the club in 1997 and ended his career with stints in Saudi Arabia and South Korea, finally retiring as a player in 2001.

==International career==

Atkinson represented the England B side in a friendly 4–1 loss against Republic of Ireland B on 27 March 1990. He scored England&#x27;s only goal in the game.

==Personal life==
Following the end of his professional football career, Atkinson returned to Telford where he ultimately lived at Little Dawley. Atkinson formed a sports consultancy for clubs, players and agents called &quot;Players Come First&quot; however the business was dissolved in November 2015.

===Death===
In his last years his health suffered with heart and kidney problems. Atkinson died on 15 August 2016 after being tasered by police near his father&#x27;s house in Trench, Telford. Police had responded to a call as Atkinson threatened to kill his father, Ernest. Atkinson&#x27;s older brother Kenroy said &quot;My brother had lost it. He was in a manic state and depressed – out of his mind and ranting. He had a tube in his shoulder for the dialysis and he had ripped it out and was covered in blood. He got dad by the throat and said he was going to kill him. He told dad he had already killed me, our brother Paul and sister Elaine and he had come for him.&quot; Officers deployed a taser three times, the first two being ineffective; after being successfully tasered and kicked in the head by a police officer, Atkinson sustained cardiac arrest on the way to the Princess Royal Hospital, Telford, where he was pronounced dead at about 03:00. He was 48. The incident was referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.

His former manager at Wednesday and Villa, Ron Atkinson, called the incident an &quot;out-and-out tragedy&quot; and noted that Dalian &quot;had terrific ability&quot;. Dalian Atkinson&#x27;s Humanist funeral took place at Telford Crematorium on 19 November 2016, followed by interment of his ashes at Hadley Cemetery.

===Aftermath===
In November 2019, one police officer was charged with murder in connection with Atkinson&#x27;s death; another was charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm.
Both officers were due to stand trial in September 2020 but because of delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the trial was delayed until April 2021.

On 26 April 2021, PC Benjamin Monk, who was charged with murder, pleaded not guilty. On 4 May, prosecutors said that Monk pressed the trigger of the taser for 33 seconds, exceeding the protocol of five seconds, before kicking Atkinson twice in the head after he fell to the ground. The defence barrister of his co-defendant said that the actions were &quot;necessary and reasonable as part of [their] continuing efforts to restrain and detain an unpredictable and threateningly violent man as she perceived him to be&quot;.

Monk was found not guilty of murder, but guilty of manslaughter on 23 June 2021. The jury failed to reach a verdict on the other police officer, Mary Ellen Bettley-Smith&#x27;s, assault charge. On 29 June, Monk was given an eight-year prison sentence. This was the first time in over 30 years that a serving police officer had been convicted of manslaughter in the course of duties. It was later disclosed that Monk had been found guilty of gross misconduct by West Mercia Police in 2011 for not declaring two police cautions in his application to join the police; he had stolen from his previous employer in 1997 and been found drunk in 1999. On 2 July, prosecutors announced that they would seek a retrial in the case of the other officer&#x27;s assault charge.

On 28 September 2022, Bettley-Smith was cleared of the assault charge. Bettley-Smith was accused of gross misconduct and faced a disciplinary panel held by West Mercia Police in March 2023. After Atkinson had been tasered, he was lying on the ground, and Bettley-Smith hit Atkinson three times with her baton. Bettley-Smith&#x27;s lawyer said that Bettley-Smith behaved &quot;as she was trained to do&quot;, and that &quot;she showed bravery under extreme pressure and was in no way responsible for the tragic outcome.&quot;

On 17 March 2023, Bettley-Smith was found guilty of gross misconduct for using excessive force. The tribunal found three initial strikes before Monk kicked Mr Atkinson were &quot;lawful&quot; but it found PC Bettley-Smith decision to then hit him a further three times, after police back-up had arrived was &quot;unnecessary disproportionate and unreasonable&quot;. Despite being found guilty of gross misconduct, Bettley-Smith was allowed to keep her job as a police officer.

<doc id="1151012" wikidata="Q7983932" url="?curid=1151012" title="Wesley Heights">
<text>Wesley Heights is a small affluent neighborhood of Washington, D.C. situated south of Spring Valley. Wesley Heights was founded in 1890 by a land speculation group led by John Waggaman and funded primarily by Charles C. Glover; Wesley Heights was further developed by the brothers William C. and Allison N. Miller during the 1920s. Modern-day Wesley Heights is bordered by Massachusetts Avenue (on the east), Nebraska Avenue (on the north), Battery-Kemble Park (on the west) and Glover Parkway (on the south). Foxhall Road and New Mexico Avenue are the main roadways passing through Wesley Heights. To protect the character of the original historic housing design of Wesley Heights, the Wesley Heights Zoning Overlay was developed and approved by District of Columbia Zoning Commission on July 13, 1992, at the urging of the Wesley Heights Historical Society. Current homeowners and new housing development within the Wesley Heights overlay must meet specific building codes. The Wesley overlay covers areas west of New Mexico Avenue (on the East), Nebraska Avenue (on the North), Battery-Kemble Park (on the West) and Glover Parkway (on the South). The overlay restriction does not cover development on housing located on the former Charles C. Glover country estate. Modern day Wesley Heights is located in Ward 3 Advisory Neighborhood Commission under 3D01.

==History==

The area which became Wesley Heights was part of a tract of land owned by John Threlkeld (a resident of Georgetown). The tract of land was called Alliance. In 1890, a group of investors fronted by John Waggaman (a real estate broker) and bankrolled by Charles. C. Glover bought all the land between Chain Bridge Road to the east, Newark Street to the North, 43rd Street (which then ran parallel to 44th street past Newark Street), and Fulton Street to the south. Tunlaw Street (Now New Mexico Avenue) ran perpendicular between 44th street and 43rd street. The group named the new development Wesley Heights to appeal to Methodist buyers. John Waggaman and Charles C. Glover played instrumental roles in the selection and purchase of the site of the soon to be Methodist-affiliated American University just north of Newark Street.

The newly named Wesley Height development was divided into plots and some of the plots were sold to prospective home buyers and investors. In 1892, Charles C. Glover acquired all the Wesley Heights plots (block 29, 22 and 21) between New Mexico Street and the then 43rd Street, and built his country mansion named Westover. By 1908, John Waggaman estate had filed for bankruptcy and Charles Glover was summoned to court to give testimony; the vast majority of Wesley Heights had been mortgaged to the hilt and there was suspicion that John Waggaman and Charles Glover had benefited from nefarious activities pertaining to the financing and acquisition of Wesley Heights and other large land developments in Washington, D.C. For years after the bankruptcy, Wesley Heights was neglected, and was mostly occupied by Charles Glover&#x27;s grand estate, Westover, and a few homes that were developed by John Waggaman.

In 1897, led by Charles Glover, the owners of Wesley Heights offered to sell a large section of Wesley Height (land adjunct to Nebraska Avenue and Loughboro Road) to American University. The university declined the offer. 
During the 1920s, a revitalization effort was initiated by real estate developers W.C. and A.N. Miller with the purchasing of plots (80 acres) in Wesley Heights. W.C. and A.N. Miller began constructing homes in Wesley Heights, and also in the neighboring communities of Spring Valley and American University Park. W.C. and A.N. Miller planned development in Wesley Heights was one of the first master-planned communities in the United States and featured such services as a shuttle to the Wisconsin Avenue streetcar and a community club house.

Prior to the passage of the 1968 Fair Housing Act, religious and racial covenants were enforced for property deeds for houses in Wesley Heights that excluded African-Americans, Jews, and members other minority groups. One deed from December 1928 stated that properties in Wesley Heights &quot;shall not be sold to any person of the Semitic race, blood or origin which racial description can be deemed to include Jews, Hebrews, Armenians, Persians and Syrians.&quot;

==Wesley Heights&#x27; Geography before the 1920 revitalization==
Not much is known about the geography of Wesley Heights before W.C. and A.N. Miller began building houses on Wesley Heights. Nevertheless, in 1894 Kate Field, the renowned American journalist, notes in her published periodical journal (&quot;Kate Field&#x27;s Washington&quot;), a vivid description of Wesley Heights from a viewpoint on Charles Glover&#x27;s estate. According to Kate Field:

&quot;&quot;Whoever stands on the broad piazza of Mr. and Mrs. C.C Glover&#x27;s country home, &quot;Westover&quot;, on Wesley Heights, has a view that vividly recalls the neighborhood of Richmond, England. Never was the scene more attractive than one day last week when Mr. Glover received several hundred friends. Four hundred feet above sea level, &quot;Westover&quot; commands the Blue Ridge on one side and the winding Potomac on the other. The tip of the monument is visible from the ground, while the Capitol may be seen from the top of the house. Truly a beautiful situation with a perennial breeze untainted by malaria&quot;.

<doc id="1151016" wikidata="Q7715755" url="?curid=1151016" title="The Basic Eight">
<text>The Basic Eight is the debut novel by author Daniel Handler, published in 1999. The book is a version of the diary of high-schooler Flannery Culp. It contains a number of sarcastic plot devices that ridicule high school English classes, standardized testing, satanic panic and talk-show analysts. The book is a classic example of an unreliable narrator. Consistent with Handler&#x27;s farcical treatment of high school English, he includes vocabulary words and study questions at the end of some of Culp&#x27;s diary entries.

==Plot==
Flannery &quot;Flan&quot; Culp is a senior at Roewer High School in San Francisco. Over the course of the year, Flan records the events of her life in a diary—which, with some heavy editing by Flannery herself years after the fact, becomes the narrative. She and her seven close friends refer to themselves as &quot;The Basic Eight&quot;. They are an exclusive clique, hosting the Grand Opera Breakfast Club, and regular dinner and garden parties. The story chronicles Flannery and her friends as they cope with the stresses of their final year of high school and Flannery&#x27;s complicated love life. The story reaches a dark conclusion in which lives of the members of the Basic Eight are turned upside down by revealed secrets, horrifying self-discoveries, and murder.

==Characters==
&quot;The Basic Eight&quot; consists of:
* Flannery Culp, the protagonist.
* Kate Gordon, the Queen Bee.
* Lily Chandly, a classical musician.
* Douglas Wilde, Flan&#x27;s ex-boyfriend.
* V__, whose rich parents have had her name expunged from the story.
* Jennifer Rose Milton, a name so beautiful that Flan must always write it out in full.
* Gabriel Gallon, the kindest boy in the world.
* Natasha Hyatt, Flan&#x27;s exuberant and beautiful best friend.

Additional characters include:

* Adam State, the object of Flannery&#x27;s affections. 
* Ron Piper, the high school drama club director. 
* Steve Nervo, the most popular boy in school.

== Connections ==
In Handler&#x27;s third novel, &quot;Adverbs&quot;, Kate is mentioned as the girlfriend of a minor character, Garth, in the chapter &quot;Soundly&quot;. In &quot;The Basic Eight&quot;, Kate frequently gives relationship advice from her two-week relationship with Garth, much to Flannery&#x27;s annoyance.

In the &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; video game for the Game Boy Advance, an item needed in several quests is &quot;&quot;The Basic Nine&quot; by Danny Handy&quot;.

== Publication history ==
&quot;The Basic Eight&quot; was the first novel published by author Daniel Handler. Handler has stated in several interviews that it was very difficult for him to get the novel published—it was rejected 37 times before publication by Thomas Dunne Books. Handler&#x27;s pen name, Lemony Snicket, was created while he was researching for &quot;The Basic Eight&quot; and needed a fake name to write down while signing up for organizations&#x27; mailing lists.

== Reception ==
&quot;The New Yorker&quot; featured the novel in its First Novels section, writing: &quot;This shrewdly funny novel is the diary of Flannery Culp, the alleged ringleader of eight high-school seniors who are accused of ritualistic murder, and instantly become the patients of countless armchair therapists and favorites with the What&#x27;s Wrong with Our Youth crowd. Handler is a charming writer with a lovely mastery of voice, but the book is weakened by his attempt to turn a clever idea into social satire&quot;.

<text>Sir Robert Robinson (13 September 1886 – 8 February 1975) was a British organic chemist and Nobel laureate recognised in 1947 for his research on plant dyestuffs (anthocyanins) and alkaloids. In 1947, he also received the Medal of Freedom with Silver Palm.
==Biography==

===Early life===
He was born at Rufford House Farm, near Chesterfield, Derbyshire the son of James Bradbury Robinson, a maker of surgical dressings, and his wife, Jane Davenport.

Robinson went to school at the Chesterfield Grammar School and the private Fulneck School. He then studied chemistry at the University of Manchester, graduating BSc in 1905. In 1907 he was awarded an 1851 Research Fellowship from the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851 to continue his research at the University of Manchester.

He was appointed as the first Professor of Pure and Applied Organic Chemistry in the School of Chemistry at the University of Sydney in 1912. He was briefly at St Andrews University (1920–22) and then was offered the Chair of Organic Chemistry at Manchester University. In 1928 he moved from there to be a professor at University College London where he stayed only two years. He was the Waynflete Professor of Chemistry at Oxford University from 1930 and a Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford.

Robinson was elected an International Member of the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1934, an International Member of the American Philosophical Society in 1944, and an International Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1948.

&quot;Robinson Close&quot;, in the Science Area at Oxford, is named after him, as is the Robert Robinson Laboratory at the University of Liverpool, the Sir Robert Robinson Laboratory of Organic Chemistry at the University of Manchester and the Robinson and Cornforth Laboratories at the University of Sydney.

Robinson was a strong amateur chess player. He represented Oxford University in a friendly match with a team from Bletchley Park in December 1944; in which he lost his game to pioneering computer scientist I. J. Good. He was president of the British Chess Federation from 1950 to 1953, and with Raymond Edwards he co-authored the book &quot;The Art and Science of Chess&quot; (Batsford, 1972).

===Research===
His synthesis of tropinone (a precursor for atropine &amp; benztropine) in 1917 was not only a big step in alkaloid chemistry but also showed that tandem reactions in a one-pot synthesis are capable of forming bicyclic molecules.

He invented the symbol for benzene having a circle in the middle whilst working at St Andrews University in 1923. He is known for inventing the use of the curly arrow to represent electron movement, and he is also known for discovering the molecular structures of morphine and penicillin.
Robinson annulation has had application in the total synthesis of steroids.

Alongside Edward Charles Dodds, Robinson had also been involved in the original synthesis of diethylstilboestrol.

In 1946 he determined the structure of strychnine.

In 1957 Robinson founded the journal &quot;Tetrahedron&quot; with fifty other editors for Pergamon Press.

<text>The St. Mark&#x27;s School of Texas is a private, nonsectarian, college-preparatory day school in Dallas, Texas. Established in 1906, St. Mark&#x27;s educates roughly 900 boys in grades 1-12.

St. Mark&#x27;s is one of the wealthiest day schools in the United States. The school&#x27;s financial endowment stands at nearly $181 million as of June 30, 2024. 14.7% of students are on financial aid, and students with family incomes under $140,000 receive scholarships worth, on average, 90% of tuition.

==History==

=== Terrill School for Boys ===
In 1906, Menter B. Terrill started the Terrill School for Boys in Dallas. The former president of North Texas Normal College (now the University of North Texas), Terrill had found himself out of a job in 1901 when the State of Texas acquired the formerly private institution. The thirty-year-old Terrill elected to get his second bachelor&#x27;s degree from Yale, and graduated in just two years as the class valedictorian. After a year teaching at Pennsylvania&#x27;s Hill School, Terrill moved back to Texas to start his own private school. The six original teachers included Terrill, his wife Ada (one of the first female graduate students at Yale), and his father, James, a former college president.

Terrill sought to build his school &quot;in the manner of the great eastern prep schools.&quot; He heavily prioritized academics. By 1915, Terrill School sent 14 of its 33 graduates to Ivy League colleges. The school also fielded an excellent football program, which went 144-23-8 from 1910 to 1932. 19 of Terrill&#x27;s 23 losses were to college freshman squads.

In 1916, Terrill sold his school to a new headmaster, citing health problems. The school began to decline, in part due to competition from the Texas Country Day School (see below). In 1946, it transferred its assets to the Episcopal Diocese of Dallas and re-emerged as the Cathedral School for Boys.

Terrill also foresaw a need for a strong girls&#x27; school in Dallas. He encouraged Ela Hockaday to open a girls&#x27; school in Dallas in 1913, and put her in contact with prominent Dallas businessmen who wanted their daughters to get a high-quality education. Schools descended from Terrill have had some affiliation with the Hockaday School for over a century, with shared social events, artistic performances, and some classes.

=== Texas Country Day School ===
In the late 1920s, several Terrill School parents worried that Menter Terrill&#x27;s successors were focusing too much on football and not enough on academics. They recruited the semi-retired Terrill to tutor their sons. Following Terrill&#x27;s death in 1931, these parents started the Texas Country Day School (TCD) in 1933. Within two years of its creation, TCD was advertising that its faculty included a &quot;Rhodes Scholar and Harvard, Dartmouth, and Amherst men.&quot;

Under the leadership of board chairmen Wirt Davis (the head of Republic Bank) and Eugene McDermott (the founder of Texas Instruments), TCD heavily prioritized academics in the same manner as the early Terrill School. To bankroll his aspirations, McDermott recruited his Texas Instruments co-founder Cecil Green as another key donor. However, a devastating campus fire pushed the school to consider a merger with another school.

=== Merger ===
In 1950, Texas Country Day School merged with the Cathedral School for Boys to form St. Mark&#x27;s School of Texas. TCD headmaster Robert Iglehart headed the merged institution, but representatives of both schools sat on the board of trustees.

The new St. Mark&#x27;s was and still is a nonsectarian institution, but the religious name reflected Cathedral&#x27;s influence, and the school continued to employ an Episcopal chaplain. Several St. Mark&#x27;s headmasters have gone on to run leading Episcopal schools, such as Christopher Berrisford (who took over Los Angeles&#x27; Harvard School and New York&#x27;s Trinity School after the St. Mark&#x27;s board fired him in 1969) and David Hicks (who became rector of New Hampshire&#x27;s St. Paul&#x27;s School in 1983). 

In 1964, St. Mark&#x27;s integrated by admitting the African-American Lee Smith, who graduated in 1965 and became &quot;one of the approximately 30 Black Harvard students in the graduating class of 1969.&quot; In 2024, the school reported that 52% of the student body were nonwhite.

==== Academics ====
The school has continued to emphasize academics following the merger. In 1982, Stanford&#x27;s admissions dean praised St. Mark&#x27;s as &quot;among the top handful of schools in the country.&quot; In 1995, 19 of St. Mark&#x27;s 67 seniors were National Merit Scholarship semifinalists. In 2024, 25 of St. Mark&#x27;s 96 seniors received that distinction. The Class of 2025 had a middle 50% SAT range of 1400-1570. Five SM seniors have been named U.S. Presidential Scholars between 2020 and 2024, including two in 2024.

&quot;Niche&quot; ranked St. Mark&#x27;s as the nation&#x27;s best private K-12 school in 2020, 2021, and 2022, as well as #2 in 2019 and 2023 (although St. Mark&#x27;s is not actually a K-12 school). The school is said to downplay these rankings, as no one school is the best fit for every boy and it is difficult to compare schools in different areas and with different goals.

Since the merger, St. Mark&#x27;s has heavily emphasized science. Headmaster Ted Whatley called St. Mark&#x27;s &quot;a &quot;Sputnik&quot; school founded by industrialists to improve science and math education in Dallas.&quot; Green and McDermott donated extensive math and science facilities in the 1960s and 1970s. At least one alumnus, Alan Stern, traces his NASA research to his participation in the St. Mark&#x27;s planetarium, observatory, and astronomy club. The school redeveloped its science facilities in 2019, when it unveiled the Robert A.M. Stern-designed Winn Science Center. The new facilities also expand an ongoing project with the University of Texas at Austin which allows students to have direct internet access to observatories in Alpine, Texas and rural Peru.

In 2016, a senior was a finalist in the Intel Science Talent Search; he was one of forty finalists nationwide and the only Texan. In 2020, a St. Mark&#x27;s student finished 5th out of 16,000 participants in the U.S. National Chemistry Olympiad. In 2019, he finished in the top 20. In 2014, a SM student won his second straight Indian national championship in the International Mathematical Olympiad. 

==== Donors and base ====
In contrast to the Terrill School, which was spearheaded by its founder and failed after he died, St. Mark&#x27;s has been driven by donors, most of whom have actively served on its board of trustees. This was necessitated by both predecessors&#x27; precarious financial position; donor Ralph B. Rogers joked that &quot;two broke schools merged to form one broke school.&quot; As &quot;D Magazine&quot; asserted in 1982, &quot;St. Mark&#x27;s has its roots in its board of directors, which in turn is rooted in the city&#x27;s most-established establishment – oil, high technology and, in the old days, cotton.&quot; McDermott and Green donated nearly $50 million to TCD and St. Mark&#x27;s over five decades. In addition to McDermott and Green, notable donors include the families of Harlan Crow, Kenneth Hersh, Lamar Hunt, Tom Hicks, and Elliott Roosevelt.

The school continues to raise large amounts of money from deep-pocketed donors, completing a $112 million fundraising campaign in 2013. In the 2020–21 school year, St. Mark&#x27;s had a financial endowment of $167.8 million, larger than the investment portfolios of every day school in New York City. 

In 2018, &quot;Architectural Digest&quot; named St. Mark&#x27;s the most beautiful private high school campus in Texas. In October 2019, an EF-3 tornado damaged multiple buildings on campus. Classes quickly resumed, and certain buildings were repaired or rebuilt. However, the school&#x27;s athletic facilities were badly damaged, prompting the school to redevelop its athletic campus.

St. Mark&#x27;s&#x27; financial endowment stands at $181.0 million as of June 30, 2024. The school reports an operating budget of $43 million and total assets of $367 million.

The 2022-23 annual fund yielded over $5 million for the 2nd consecutive year. Over 3000 individuals donate each year. This number includes about 85% of current parents and, for the 15th consecutive year, over half of all living alumni.

==Athletics==

=== History ===
During the decade of the 1910s, Terrill began to recruit enough athletes (including boarders in a postgraduate year) to successfully compete against much larger high schools as well as teams of college freshmen from Rice, SMU, and TCU. The football team&#x27;s record during that decade was 67 wins, 2 ties, and one loss (in 1915 to the freshman team from the University of Texas at Austin). Five games between 1912 and 1918 ended with Terrill&#x27;s football team shutting out their opponents while scoring over 100 points. These undefeated seasons continued through the 1920s, with the teams often being led by well-known coaches. For example, one head coach of that era, Eugene Neely, had starred in football at Dartmouth, despite having lost an arm in a hunting accident at age 14. Another coach, Monroe Sweeney, left Terrill for Major League Baseball, where he umpired 412 games. Another, Pete Cawthon, left Terrill to coach at Austin College, bringing with him 7 of his Terrill players; Cawthon went on to become head football coach for Texas Tech and the Brooklyn Dodgers of the National Football League as well as the athletic director for the University of Alabama. In 1930, the football team was undefeated and unscored upon, and the basketball team won a prep school national championship.

=== Athletic program ===
St. Marks fields 45 Upper School teams in 16 sports. Varsity teams primarily compete with the sixteen other private schools in Texas and Oklahoma comprising the Southwest Preparatory Conference (SPC).

For the 2022-23 school year, St. Mark&#x27;s won the SPC Directors Cup, an overall measure of conference success. This was the school&#x27;s 13th Directors Cup in the last 16 years (the school finished 2nd those other 3 years). 

Some individual teams have had lengthy periods of success. Lacrosse won 9 conference championships between 2004 and 2013. The swim team won 20 conference championships between 1995 and 2016. The tennis team won 13 conference championships between 1975 and 1990. Water polo won 15 regional championships between 2001 and 2016. Wrestling won 37 conference championships between 1973 and 2015, as well as 13 state championships. The water polo team won 7 Texas state championships between 2014 and 2022. 

=== Notable recent athletes ===
Thirteen of the 100 members of the class of 2023 signed to play intercollegiate sports after graduation; since 2018, a total of 68 SM seniors have signed to play college sports. In the 3 years between 2021 and 2023, SM seniors signed letters of intent to play intercollegiate college sports in all of the sports offered at the school, as well as in one sport (squash) that isn&#x27;t available on campus. 

Some well-known alumni were athletes while at St. Mark&#x27;s. Luke Wilson ‘90 was part of a 1989 record-setting 4x400 relay team (3:21.38); that time was the conference record for over 20 years and a school record until April 2022. Before taking up acting professionally, Tommy Lee Jones ‘65 was an all-conference offensive lineman for Harvard&#x27;s football team. Boz Scaggs ‘62 was a track and soccer star while at St. Mark&#x27;s.

Four St. Mark&#x27;s alumni have played (or are playing) in the 21st century National Football League: Ty Montgomery &#x27;11, Sam Acho &#x27;07, Emmanuel Acho (&#x27;08), and Kalen Thornton (&#x27;00). At least 5 Terrill alumni from the 1920s played in the NFL during its first decade: J. B. Andrews (1926), Deck Shelley (1926), Lou Jennings (1923), Charley Malone (1929) and Bill Vaughn (1920).

Multiple alumni have leadership roles in professional sports. Taylor Jenkins &#x27;03, is head basketball coach of the NBA&#x27;s Memphis Grizzlies. For MLB&#x27;s Tampa Bay Rays, Matthew Silverman &#x27;94 is President of Baseball Operations, Brian Auld &#x27;95 is President, and Barry Newell &#x27;05 is vice president for business operations and analytics. David Christoff &#x27;10 began studying football data on his own after graduating from MIT and is now Director of Football Analytics for the NFL&#x27;s Las Vegas Raiders. Clark Hunt &#x27;83 is CEO and co-owner of the NFL&#x27;s Kansas City Chiefs and MLS&#x27;s FC Dallas, while Ross Perot, Jr. &#x27;77 previously owned the NBA&#x27;s Dallas Mavericks. Of these seven, none played the varsity college sport for which they are known, though Newell played varsity football at Princeton for 3 years, Auld captained Stanford&#x27;s varsity lacrosse team, and Hunt captained SMU&#x27;s varsity soccer team. Aside from Jenkins, who interned for the San Antonio Spurs after college, all of these alumni entered sports management from the business world.

As of 2024, Harrison Ingram &#x27;21 is the starting forward for college basketball&#x27;s North Carolina Tar Heels. Earlier, he played two years for Stanford, where he was voted the Pac 12 freshman of the year after leading conference freshmen in scoring, rebounds, assists, and steals. While at St. Mark&#x27;s, Ingram was evaluated to be the best basketball player in the state and was named to the 24-player McDonald&#x27;s All-American team. The summer after graduating from SM, Ingram was a member of the United States team that won the 2021 FIBA Under-19 World Cup in Latvia.

The following St. Mark&#x27;s teams have won Texas state championships.
==Extracurricular activities==

As of 2018, St. Mark&#x27;s recognized 90 extra-curricular clubs and offered 24 fine arts courses.

=== Academic tournaments ===
The debate team has won four national policy debate titles. In addition, the team won the &quot;world championship&quot; at the 2015 International Public Policy Forum.

The 4-student Upper School Quiz Bowl team won the Small School National Academic Quiz Tournaments&#x27;s National Championship in 2024. The school’s “B” team finished 3rd in that competition, while the “C” team finished in a tie for 17th. Teams from St Mark’s had earlier won that competition in 2017, 2021, and 2022. In 2023, competing against public and private high schools of any size, the 5-student St. Mark&#x27;s team finished 5th at the PACE National Scholastic Championship in Chicago and 8th at the High School National Championship Tournament in Atlanta. 

For the 4th consecutive year, the 2023-24 SM 4th grade class finished 1st nationally in the most competitive division of the WordMasters Challenge, a series of 3 tests taken annually by 125,000 4th graders around the country. The tests focus on vocabulary, analogies, word usage, and critical thinking. In both 2023 and 2024, an SM 4th grader finished first nationally and a total of 7 other students finished within the top 15 in those 2 years. In addition to the current streak, SM 4th grade classes had also finished 1st nationally in the 4 years between 2015 and 2018.

In 2003 and 2019, respectively, an St. Mark&#x27;s middle schooler won the Scripps National Spelling Bee. In the more recent competition, a 7th grader tied for first after having also won the 2018 national spelling bee for students of South Asian descent and after having placed in the top 40 in the Scripps competition in both 2017 and 2018.

=== School publications ===
All five 2022-23 St. Mark&#x27;s publications earned Gold Crowns from the Columbia Scholastic Press Association, an honor that goes to six to sixteen publications per category in the country. It was the 20th consecutive for &quot;The ReMarker&quot;, the newspaper, extending the school&#x27;s national record for winning this award, which is given to only 6 high school newspapers each year. &quot;The Marque&quot;, the school&#x27;s literary magazine, won its 9th Gold Crown in 10 years. In the category of &quot;Special Interest Magazines&quot;, St. Mark&#x27;s publications won two of the six Gold Crowns awarded in 2021-22; these awards were the 4th straight for &quot;Focus&quot; and the 3rd straight for &quot;Scientific Marksman&quot;. The &quot;Marksmen&quot;, the St. Mark&#x27;s yearbook, won its 8th Gold Crown, overall, but its first since 2013. In 2019, the middle school magazine won its 3rd consecutive Gold Crown, an award given to only 1 or 2 publications in the country.

In 2023, &quot;The ReMarker&quot; won a National Pacemaker Award, the top award from the National Scholastic Press Association; as of 2023, the newspaper had won this award 15 of the prior 19 years. SM&#x27;s &quot;Scientific Marksman&quot; was one of 6 specialty magazines in the country to win a 2023 Pacemaker, while &quot;The Marque&quot;, was one of 6 literary magazine winners. In 2022, SM&#x27;s &quot;The Focus&quot; was one of 2 specialty magazine to win the NSPA&#x27;s top award, its 4th consecutive Pacemaker. 

St. Mark&#x27;s seniors were named journalist of the year in the state of Texas for eight consecutive years (2013–2020) by the NSPA. In 2019, a senior was named NSPA&#x27;s national journalist of the year; he became the fourth St. Mark&#x27;s student in 7 years to rank among the country&#x27;s top three high school journalists.

For the 15th time in 16 years, 2022 St. Mark&#x27;s Photography was named &quot;Top Program&quot; in the annual contest sponsored by the Association of Texas Photography Instructors. The contest annually draws about 7000 entries from about 90 schools.

=== Arts ===
In 2021, the Texas Commission on the Arts named a SM student the state poetry champion through its Poetry Out Loud recitation competition. In 2016, the President&#x27;s Committee on the Arts and Humanities named an St. Mark&#x27;s senior one of the 5 National Student Poets, selected from over 20,000 applicants.

Between 2015 and 2017, four St. Mark&#x27;s students won top awards for design from the nationwide YoungArts competition. In addition, seventeen St. Mark&#x27;s students were finalists in that YoungArts competition between 2009 and 2018.

In 2024, a SM senior won the Princeton Prize in Race Relations, an award that goes to 29 high school students in the country each year.

<text>Nicolaus Bernoulli (also spelled Nicolas or Nikolas; in Basel – 29 November 1759 in Basel) was a Swiss mathematician and was one of the many prominent mathematicians in the Bernoulli family.

==Biography==
Nicolaus Bernoulli was born on in Basel. He was the son of Nicolaus Bernoulli, painter and Alderman of Basel. In 1704 he graduated from the University of Basel under Jakob Bernoulli and obtained his PhD five years later (in 1709) with a work on probability theory in law. His thesis was titled &quot;Dissertatio Inauguralis Mathematico-Juridica de Usu Artis Conjectandi in Jure&quot;.

In 1716 he obtained the Galileo-chair at the University of Padua, where he worked on differential equations and geometry. In 1722 he returned to Switzerland and obtained a chair in Logics at the University of Basel.

Nicolaus I Bernoulli was deeply influenced by his family, particularly his uncle Jacob Bernoulli and his cousin Daniel Bernoulli, both of whom were prominent mathematicians. Jacob Bernoulli, one of the early developers of calculus and a pioneer in the field of probability, had a significant impact on Nicolaus’s academic direction. Jacob’s work on the Bernoulli numbers and the Bernoulli theorem provided a strong foundation for Nicolaus’s own research in probability theory.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1714.

Nicolaus I Bernoulli had a rich array of personal interests that extended beyond his mathematical pursuits. Influenced by his father, who was a painter, Nicolaus developed a keen appreciation for the arts. This artistic inclination was reflected in his meticulous and creative approach to problem-solving in mathematics. He enjoyed engaging in intellectual discussions and debates, often with his family members, which helped him refine his analytical skills. Additionally, Nicolaus had a passion for teaching and mentoring, finding great satisfaction in guiding his students and witnessing their academic growth. His diverse interests and talents made him a well-rounded individual, contributing to his legacy as a distinguished mathematician and educator.

His most important contributions can be found in his letters, in particular to Pierre Rémond de Montmort. In these letters, he introduced in particular the St. Petersburg Paradox. He also communicated with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and Leonhard Euler.

Nicolaus I Bernoulli died on November 29, 1759, in Basel, Switzerland. The exact cause of his death is not well-documented, but it is generally believed that he suffered from a prolonged illness, possibly tuberculosis.

<doc id="1151032" wikidata="Q5585149" url="?curid=1151032" title="Gordon Friesen">
<text>Gordon Friesen (1909 - 1996) was a novelist and co-founder, along with his wife Agnes Sis Cunningham, of &quot;Broadside&quot;, the political song magazine that first published many of the most popular songs of the folk revival, including compositions by Bob Dylan and Phil Ochs.

Friesen was born March 3, 1909, in Weatherford, Oklahoma. He grew up in a Russian Mennonite family in Oklahoma, and was also an important early contributor to Mennonite literature. His novel &quot;Flamethrowers&quot;, which was critical of Mennonite traditions, is regarded as one of the earliest novels by an American Mennonite author about Mennonites.

Friesen and his wife Cunningham were also members of the Almanac Singers during the 1940s, a Greenwich Village urban folk music revival group with a shifting membership.

&quot;At its peak, &quot;Broadside&quot; appeared monthly, but as the folk revival lost momentum, its publication dwindled to bimonthly and ultimately semi-annually by the end of the 1960s. Although its circulation never exceeded four figures, the Friesens kept Broadside afloat until 1988, publishing 187 issues in all.&quot;

In 1999, Cunningham published their collaborative memoir, &quot;Red Dust and Broadsides: A Joint Autobiography&quot;:

In 2000, Smithsonian Folkways Records collected the magazine’s most notable songs on the five-CD box set The Best of Broadside 1962-1988 .

He died October 15, 1996.

<doc id="1151041" wikidata="Q2280323" url="?curid=1151041" title="Ukemochi">
<text>, commonly known as , the daughter of the Shinto deities Izanagi and Izanami, is a goddess of food in the Shinto religion of Japan. In some differing interpretations, Ukemochi is referred to as both male and female. When shown in other forms, Ukemochi takes the shape of a fox. Ōgetsu-hime is married to Hayamato (羽山戸神, Hayamato-no-kami), who is the son of Toshigami through his wife Amechikarumizu-hime (天知迦流美豆比売) in the &quot;Kojiki,&quot; making Hayamato her great-grandnephew through her brother Ōyamatsumi. In some legends, Ukemochi is also married to Inari and in others, she is Inari.

According to the &quot;Kojiki,&quot; after Susanoo was banished from heaven, he asked Ōgetsu-hime to give him food, and she did so by producing various food items from her nose, mouth and rectum. Thinking that she had poisoned the food by doing this, Susanoo killed her. After she died, silkworms grew from her head, rice seeds grew from her eyes, millet grew from her ear, red beans grew from her nose, wheat grew from her genitals, and soy beans grew from her rectum. After her death, Kamimusubi took seeds from her body and planted them in the ground.

Another version of the myth features Ōgetsu-hime by her more common name, Ukemochi, and in this version, the moon god Tsukuyomi visits her on behalf of his sister-wife, the sun goddess Amaterasu. Ukemochi sought to entertain him and prepared a feast. First, she faced the land and opened her mouth, and boiled rice came out. Next, she faced the ocean and spit out fish and seaweed, then she faced the forest and bountiful game spewed out of her mouth. She prepared the food and served it to Tsukuyomi, but he was so disgusted by how she had produced the food and thought she had disrespected him and made the food impure. Feeling offended by the slight from the lesser deity, he killed her and returned to heaven. Her dead body produced both food and animals: cows and horses came from her head, silkworms came from her eyebrows, millet came from her forehead and a rice plant sprouted from her stomach. While different sources mention similar items that came from Ukemochi&#x27;s body, from which part of her body these items came from is less agreed upon.

It is believed that this version of Ukemochi&#x27;s death explained why the sun and the moon are not seen together as the sun goddess, Amaterasu, who heard of Ukemochi&#x27;s passing, never wanted to meet her killer, the moon god, Tsukuyomi, again, or that Tsukuyomi hid during the day out of fear of Amaterasu&#x27;s wrath.

In addition, in a legend passed down in Iwami district (石見地方) in Shimane Prefecture (島根県), her daughter and deity Otogosa-hime (乙子狭姫) rode on a red goose and descended to transmit the seeds of the crops to the ground. Otogosa-hime was able to get food from anywhere on her body.

Ukemochi, Inari, and Toyouke are all said to be connected to each other. For example, Ukemochi is also called Wakaukanome and thought to be somewhat connected to or identical with Toyouke-hime. She is also thought to be linked to or identical with Inari.

<text>USS &quot;Chivo&quot; (SS-341), a submarine, was a ship of the United States Navy named for the &quot;chivo&quot; or big-scaled goatfish &quot;Pseudopenaeus grandisquamis&quot;, a fish inhabiting the Pacific Ocean between Panama and Mexico.

&quot;Chivo&quot; was launched 14 January 1945 by Electric Boat Company, Groton, Conn.; sponsored by Mrs. Edith Lindholm Baldwin, wife of Raymond E. Baldwin, the governor of Connecticut; and commissioned 28 April 1945.

== 1945–1950 ==

&quot;Chivo&quot; departed New London 7 June 1945 for Key West where she trained and exercised briefly at the sound school and experimental torpedo range, before sailing on to Pearl Harbor in company with and . While the submarine was preparing for her first war patrol, hostilities ended; &quot;Chivo&quot; then remained at Pearl Harbor, operating locally with other ships of the Pacific Fleet. Assigned to Submarine Squadron Seven (SubRon 7), she returned to the States in October, basing out of San Diego, California for local operations which continued until January 1946, when &quot;Chivo&quot; sailed for a short tour of duty operating out of Subic Bay in the Philippines. Returning to San Diego in May, the submarine exercised along the west coast for the next 15 months, a period culminating in an overhaul at Mare Island Naval Shipyard.

Growing tensions in Asia, provoked in part by French conflict with the Vietminh in Indochina and disagreements over the future of Korea, encouraged the Navy to conduct more realistic training for submariners. As part of this general approach, &quot;Chivo&quot; began a three-month simulated war patrol in August 1947 which took her to Suva, Fiji Islands; Guam; and Japan; before she arrived back at San Diego in November. West coast duty continued for her until mid-1949 when she was transferred to the Atlantic Fleet, arriving at her new home port of Naval Station Key West and Submarine Squadron Four (SubRon 4) on 4 July 1949. During her transit there the boat&#x27;s movement reports describe one of the hazards of sailing in the warm waters in the West Indies when &quot;Chivo&quot; &quot;struck unidentified submerged object, possibly turtle.&quot; The submarine provided training and services for Atlantic Fleet ships in intertype exercises until 30 October 1950 when she arrived at New London to begin an extensive Greater Underwater Propulsion Program (GUPPY 1-A) overhaul and modernization. The modifications included streamlining the hull and superstructure, adding a snorkel to allow diesel engine operation while at periscope depth and increasing overall battery power.

== 1951–1960 ==

With increased power and a new streamlined shape, &quot;Chivo&quot; returned to duty with the Atlantic Fleet in July 1951, resuming anti-submarine warfare (ASW) training operations with surface ships as well as maintaining proficiency in anti-shipping and mine warfare. These drills and exercises took place mainly off Key West and Guantanamo Bay. This regular training continued until 19 April 1952 when &quot;Chivo&quot; sailed for a short cruise with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean, visiting Augusta, Sicily; Cannes and Marseille, France; and Naples, Italy; before returning home via the Azores in June.
Assigned to Submarine Squadron Twelve (SubRon 12) upon her return to Key West, the submarine resumed her familiar training routine with the Fleet Sonar School interspersed with port visits to Havana, Cuba; Montego Bay, Jamaica; and Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Aside from a three-month overhaul at Philadelphia between January and May 1953, &quot;Chivo&quot; remained in the West Indies until October when the submarine transited the Panama Canal for a month of operations off the Pacific coast of Colombia. This training period continued until May 1954 when the boat began a four-month regular overhaul at Charleston Naval Shipyard. She again returned to Fleet Sonar School duty in September, with such employment put on hold in March 1955 for a ten-week battery renewal restricted availability. In a change to her normal schedule, the submarine visited Gulfport, Mississippi, in March 1956 and New York City in August of that same year. After another visit to Gulfport in January 1957 to train reservists, and Santiago de Cuba in February, &quot;Chivo&quot; commenced an overhaul at Charleston Naval Shipyard in March. Returning to normal duty out of Key West in September, the boat remained there save for the occasional port visit to Gulf Ports until transferred to Charleston and Submarine Squadron Four in July 1959, a shift completed after a short cruise north to Boston, and Quebec City, Canada the previous month. &quot;Chivo&quot; resumed her familiar ASW services out of Charleston shortly thereafter, a duty she continued in January 1960 with ASW services to patrol aircraft off Bermuda. She followed that with another overhaul at Charleston Naval Shipyard between March and September, with repairs and modifications that included a new sonar system.

On 4 October 1960 &quot;Chivo&quot; began her first out-of-area cruise in eight years, though she first sailed south to St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, for a two-week amphibious exercise with the 2d Reconnaissance Company, Fleet Marine Force. The submarine then sailed to South Africa, via Trinidad, British West Indies, for Operation CAPEX-60, a joint ASW exercise with British, French, Portuguese and South African ships and aircraft. While en route, the boat held the traditional crossing-the-line ceremonies at the equator. As put by the &quot;Navy Times&quot;, &quot;Although greatly outnumbered, the fifteen &#x27;shellbacks&#x27; kept complete control as they initiated the &#x27;polywogs&#x27; into the Ancient Order of the Deep.&quot; The exercise, which included port visits to Simonstown, Port Elizabeth and Cape Town, lasted through November and &quot;Chivo&quot; did not return home to Charleston, via San Juan, Puerto Rico, until 21 December.

== 1961–1971 ==

Over the next few years, &quot;Chivo&quot; continued to specialize in her role as an &quot;opposition force&quot; (i.e. Soviet) submarine during ASW training exercises. These included pretending to launch a ballistic missile at the United States, disrupting &quot;blue force&quot; amphibious convoys or attempting submerged transits against reconnaissance aircraft patrols. In the latter case during Operation DeltEx XV in October 1962, &quot;Chivo&quot; managed to stay undetected during a three-day submerged transit opposed by aircraft from Norfolk and Bermuda. In addition to conducting similar exercises in 1963, the submarine also received a plastic fairwater to help with underwater speed during a regular overhaul at Charleston between February and June 1964.

On 4 January 1965 the submarine got underway for her second Mediterranean deployment, stopping at Lisbon, Portugal; and Rota, Spain; before beginning a series of exercises with North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) forces off Italy and Turkey. The boat sailed for home from Athens, Greece, on 14 April and arrived, via Rota, on 2 May. &quot;Chivo&quot; spent the rest of the year conducting her usual local training operations, including a specialized mine planting exercise. A regularly scheduled five-month overhaul took place at Charleston in early 1966, followed by type training and the usual ASW services to various Atlantic Fleet units. During this period &quot;Chivo&quot; also participated in the final weapons range acceptance tests for the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center (AUTEC) in the Bahama Islands.

Local operations continued into 1967, with &quot;Chivo&quot; servicing warships and submarines out of Guantanamo Bay and conducting prospective commanding officer training in nearby operating areas. This routine was only broken in January 1968 when the submarine participated in destroyer-submarine Exercise Springboard I, a six-week exercise that allowed &quot;Chivo&quot; to conduct forty-eight torpedo firings at surface and sub-surface targets, greatly improving the skill of the fire control team. Following upkeep alongside submarine tender , the submarine then sailed north on 26 May to assist in Search and Rescue operations for , with &quot;Chivo&quot; assisting in tracing the intended track of the wrecked submarine. During November, &quot;Chivo&quot; provided services for the AUTEC range at Bermuda before ending the year at Charleston. After another overhaul between January and August 1969, the submarine conducted refresher and type training in preparation for Exercise Springboard II in January 1970. After a port visit to San Juan, Puerto Rico, in mid-January, the boat sailed north to Portsmouth, Virginia, for repairs. She then conducted two months of training services out of Guantanamo Bay before returning to Charleston on 28 April.

At this time, the Navy — needing money and qualified manpower elsewhere — reduced &quot;Chivo&#x27;s&quot; manning level to 43 sailors and placed the boat in cadre or &quot;non-operational&quot; status. A service inspection completed on 16 February 1971 determined the boat was unfit for further service, as &quot;Chivo&quot; was &quot;far below the standards of a Guppy III submarine considered the minimum required to meet the increasing demands of present and future submarine warfare requirements.&quot; Although temporarily returned to active duty on 26 February 1971, the status change was in preparation for her transfer to a foreign navy that summer. There was still time for providing training and services, however, and the submarine conducted operational readiness exercises with in March; mainly conducting trailing, approach and torpedo firing exercises with the newer nuclear-powered submarine. &quot;Chivo&quot; provided the same &quot;opposition force&quot; training for in April and in May. These services ended when Argentine Naval personnel arrived at Charleston on 15 June to receive two weeks of underway training with &quot;Chivo&quot;&#x27;s crew, focusing on diving, surfacing and snorkeling evolutions.

&quot;Chivo&quot; decommissioned at Charleston Navy Yard on 1 July 1971 and was struck from the Navy List that same day.

== Argentine service ==


The submarine was transferred (sold) to Argentina, under terms of the Security Assistance Program on 1 July 1971. She served in the Argentine Navy (&quot;Armada de la República Argentina&quot;) as ARA &quot;Santiago del Estero&quot; (S-22), the third submarine to be named in honor of Santiago del Estero Province. This submarine played a minor role in the Falklands War. She had not participated in exercises since 1980, her sonar had been removed in 1981, and she had been decommissioned in September 1981.

By the start of the Falkalnds War on 2 April 1982, &quot;Santiago del Estero&quot; could not submerge, but she could still move on the surface. The British had no satellite technology at the time and eventually got the aid of the United States, which had available three satellites. One was of the HEXAGON/KH-9 type, launched on 11 May 1982, which had the problem that the film had to be ejected towards the Earth and picked up near Hawaii, and then transported by air towards the continent. The other were two KENNAN/KH-11, the most modern in the world, and could pass the encrypted information directly to a station in the US and from there it would be transmitted to the headquarters in Northwood, UK. In April, the United States had the KH-11/4 moved away from its orbit above the USSR and this satellite was observing Argentine bases both in the continent and the islands. Once received, he information was passed from Northwood to both Task Forces in the South Atlantic: TF 317 (Surface fleet) and TF 324 (submarine fleet); the latter commanded by Admiral Peter Herbert. The British had put the emphasis on the four Argentine submarines, as well as on Argentina&#x27;s sole aircraft carrier ARA &quot;Veinticinco de Mayo&quot; (V-2); the latter was detected navigating south of Gulf San Jorge. However, &quot;Santiago del Estero&quot; (S-22), which was believed to be non-operational at the time, could not be seen since 21 April. The Argentine Navy knew about the satellite technology monitoring the mainland, and the submarine, which was not capable of submerging, had been towed by night toward Puerto Belgrano Naval Base, and there she was successfully camouflaged between two transports. The information was very important for the British; since after the capture of &quot;Santiago del Estero&quot;′s sister ship ARA &quot;Santa Fe&quot; (S-21) at South Georgia, during Operation Paraquet, there were only three Argentine submarines, and it was necessary to find where the Argentine submarines were, as to prevent attacks on British submarines by mistake. It took until 28 May for the American-British satellital technology to find &quot;Santiago del Estero&quot;. She was seen in the base together with two old World War II American destroyers, one modern Type 42, and the only aircraft carrier, in a day in which weather conditions made possible for the satellite to effectively distinguish them.

The other Argentine submarines had different performances in the war. ARA &quot;San Luis&quot; (S-32), a German Type 209/1200, had returned to Puerto Belgrano Naval Base on 19 May, after a 39-day patrol north of the Falklands, in which she spent 864 hours submerged. &quot;San Luis&quot;′s sister ship ARA &quot;Salta&quot; (S-31) had many problems at the time with her torpedo tubes and was conducting several tests of them, navigating in continental waters from 21 May. She finally arrived at her base on 29 May.

&quot;Santiago del Estero&quot; was disposed of in 1983.

<doc id="1151047" wikidata="Q694243" url="?curid=1151047" title="The Biggest Loser (American TV series)">
<text>The Biggest Loser is an American competition reality show that initially ran on NBC for 17 seasons from 2004 to 2016 before moving to USA Network in 2020. The show features obese or overweight contestants competing to win a cash prize by losing the highest percentage of weight relative to their initial weight.

==Premise==
Each season of &quot;The Biggest Loser&quot; starts the 30-week competition with a weigh-in to determine the contestants&#x27; starting weights, which serve as the baseline for determining the overall winner.

The contestants are grouped into teams of three, each wearing separate colored T-shirts. Depending on the season a team may work with a specific trainer or all trainers may work with all contestants. The trainers are responsible (in conjunction with medical personnel retained by the show) for designing comprehensive workout and nutrition plans and teaching them to the contestants. However, the contestants are individually responsible for implementing the principles taught.

During an episode, various challenges and temptations (see below) are featured. Those who win a particular challenge are given special privileges, such as a weight advantage for the next weigh-in or even full immunity from being voted off the show.

Each week culminates in another weigh-in to determine which team has lost the most weight for that week, in percentage of total weight lost. The team that has lost the least percentage during that week (known as &quot;falling below the yellow line&quot;, which refers to a line featured on a video screen showing the cutoff between safety and being at-risk) will have one member voted off (unless the team consists of only one remaining member, in which case there is no vote). The vote is usually made by the other teams, though some episodes feature one team making the decision alone. Some episodes feature a second, &quot;red line&quot;; if a contestant falls below the red line the contestant is automatically off the show with no vote. Other episodes allow for the contestants, if successfully meeting a goal at the weigh-in, to all receive immunity for the week.

When the number of contestants has shrunk to a predetermined smaller number (unknown to the contestants), the teams are dissolved and the contestants compete one-on-one against each other.

The season finale reunited the final contestants remaining on the show and those eliminated. The eliminated contestants compete for a smaller prize while those remaining on the show compete for a larger prize and the title of &quot;The Biggest Loser&quot;.

==Episode format==
Episodes are typically two hours long. Some episodes have been aired in a shortened one-hour format to accommodate adjacent network programming such as &quot;The Voice&quot; and the State of the Union address. Each episode features some, but not all, of the following activities (some contestants may not participate in an activity with physical requirements if placed on medical restrictions):

# Temptation:Contestants prepare for the first day of the week only to find a situation that involves temptation. The temptation usually requires contestants to gamble by eating or drinking delicious but high-calorie foods in exchange for what may seem to be a beneficial trade-off. The benefits may or may not be known to the contestants in advance. Examples include eating sweet foods for a chance to call their loved ones, eating a big slice of cake to win an unknown prize (which, in one episode, turned out to be an exercise bike) or giving up time with a trainer for a chance to win money. Contestants are given a set period of time before the offer passes.
# Reward Challenge:Contestants compete to win a prize, first as teams and then as individuals after the teams are dissolved. After the challenge, viewers are shown the winning team enjoying their reward while the losing team accepts their loss. Prizes range from immunity- which is exemption from elimination—to exercise equipment, phone calls home or weight prizes, which allow winners of a challenge to have a greater weight loss at the Weigh-In, or losers of a challenge to have a lower weight loss at the Weigh-In (e.g. a 6 lb weight loss would result in a 7 lb weight loss if a contestant were to win a &quot;1 pound advantage&quot; whereas it would result in a 5 lb weight loss if a contestant were to win a &quot;1 pound disadvantage&quot;). If there is an unequal number of players on each team, then the team(s) with more players must pick an individual or individuals who will sit out until there is an equal number of players on each team. Occasionally, players have to be cleared by the show&#x27;s doctors in order to participate in physical challenges.
# Initial Workout:Contestants work out with the trainers. During this segment, the trainers will often speak with certain contestants, especially those who are doing poorly. Usually, underlying emotional issues are revealed at this time (such as a loss of a family member or a physical calamity), often the triggering events that led to the weight gain in the first place.
# Last Chance Workout:Last chance workouts are often shown as grueling, final preparations for the weigh in. This is a real test of strength and trainers push contestants to their limits.
# Last Chance Challenge:Introduced in season seventeen, the last chance challenge is a variant between a reward challenge and a last chance workout. As with the last chance workout, the last chance challenge will usually take place inside the gym. The winning team will win a prize that benefits the team just before the upcoming weigh-in (for example, a two-pound weight advantage for the team).
# Weigh-In:Although the show depicts the weigh-in in an evening setting, the actual weight measurement occurs off-camera in a morning session and the contestants are not told of the results at that time. All contestants are weighed to determine the amount they have lost relative to their total body weight. During team-based competition, the team that loses the highest percentage wins and the losing team must send one person home. When the teams are dissolved and the show becomes an individual competition, the two contestants who lose the lowest percentage of weight are below the yellow line and eligible for elimination. A similar setup to individual-based weigh-ins happens when the two initial teams are broken up into four teams of two or three, as happened in the second and fourth seasons. In season ten, the rules changed. The contestants are now expected to weigh in before challenges. The yellow line now increases up to half of the slots depending on how many contestants there are at the ranch. Contestants below the yellow line face an elimination challenge before the vote. In addition, the Biggest Loser of the week is allowed to save a person below the yellow line from elimination. Some episodes have featured both a yellow line and a red line; a contestant who falls below the red line is eliminated outright from the competition without a vote of the other contestants.
# Elimination Challenge:Introduced in season nine, the elimination challenge was for the two people below the yellow line. In the only elimination challenge of that season, the longest one standing stayed while the other went home. In season ten, the elimination challenge was re-introduced. Those below the yellow line participate in a challenge to escape from the vote. The two least successful contestants face the vote.
# The Vote:The final segment of the show takes place in a dining room that has refrigerators labeled with each contestant&#x27;s name (active contestants have their name illuminated) and filled with that contestant&#x27;s favorite tempting foods. Prior to the vote, contestants facing elimination plead their case as to why they should remain on the Ranch (several episodes feature contestants making a &quot;sacrificial&quot; request to be sent home, generally a team agreeing as to which member should stay and which one should go, or one contestant feeling that they can make progress at home while another needs the Ranch setting to continue his/her progress). The other contestants are not required to honor any requests to be sent home, though generally such requests are honored. The contestants facing elimination arrive at the dining room first; the other contestants each carry a covered plate containing the name of the person they wish to vote out. In the event of a tie, the contestant or team who lost the least percentage of weight is eliminated, except if both of the contestants or teams lost the least percentage of weight. As people are voted out, the light for their name is extinguished. After the vote, the eliminated contestant is shown at home and discusses the progress they made in their weight loss.

==Weight loss regimen: risks and criticism==


According to LiveScience.com, &quot;physicians and nutritionists worry the show&#x27;s focus on competitive weight loss is, at best, counterproductive and, at worst, dangerous&quot;. Contestants on the show lose upwards of 10 pounds per week (in the very first week, some contestants have lost 20–30+ pounds in that one week alone), whereas the established medical guidelines for safe weight loss are between 1 and 2 pounds per week.

Other health writers take it even further, suggesting that everything from the show&#x27;s dietary guidelines to workout routines are completely flawed.

Nutritionist Dr. Barry Sears sums up the wellness paradox: &quot;First, eating less can cause stress to the system causing more hunger. Second, the more people exercise, the hungrier they become.&quot; Dr. Sears continues by claiming that &quot;even with the most intense training, people are unlikely to add more than five pounds of muscle in 12 weeks of weight training. The reason viewers see their muscles emerging as the show goes on is because as the layer of fat surrounding the muscles is lost, muscles become more visible. Those muscles were always there but covered by a mass of fat tissue.

At the end of every telecast, the following disclaimer is shown:

Despite this claim of supervision, however, all contestants are required to sign a waiver that states: &quot;no warranty, representation or guarantee has been made as to the qualifications or credentials of the medical professionals who examine me or perform any procedures on me in connection with my participation in the series, or their ability to diagnose medical conditions that may affect my fitness to participate in the series&quot;.

The weight-loss regimen used in the show—severe caloric restriction combined with up to six hours a day of strenuous exercise—involves risks including a weakening of the heart muscle, irregular heartbeat and dangerous reductions in potassium and electrolytes. Contestants, regardless of their weight, are required to certify that they believe they are &quot;in excellent physical, emotional, psychological and mental health&quot;.

&quot;The Biggest Loser: Second Chances&quot; included a one-mile foot race in its first week, an event that led to the hospitalization of two of its contestants; Rob Huizenga, the show&#x27;s medical consultant, when asked about the foot race said that &quot;If we had it to do over, we wouldn&#x27;t [have done] it&quot; and noted that in response, the show&#x27;s producers have &quot;changed a lot of the way [they] do things&quot; (including the close monitoring of contestants&#x27; body temperatures during exercise).

One attempt to create a more healthy environment after Season 8&#x27;s dangerous foot race was to include a pool for low-impact cardio. This helped contestants to lose weight in a healthier and safer way than some previous exercise routines on earlier seasons.

Because the show is a contest that involves eliminations from it, some contestants are encouraged to take risks that endanger their health. Ryan C. Benson, the winner of the program&#x27;s first season, publicly admitted that &quot;he dropped some of the weight by fasting and dehydrating himself to the point that he was urinating blood&quot;. Also since the show Benson has regained all of his weight, but 10–12 lbs. In 2009, Kai Hibbard (runner-up from the third season) told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that &quot;she and other contestants would drink as little water as possible in the 24 hours before a weigh-in&quot; and would &quot;work out in as much clothing as possible&quot; when the cameras were off. She further stated that two weeks after the show ended, she had regained about 31 pounds, mostly from staying hydrated. In a June 2010 interview, Hibbard said, &quot;I do still struggle [with disordered eating]. I do. My husband says I&#x27;m still afraid of food... I&#x27;m still pretty messed up from the show.&quot;

According to a report by &quot;The New York Post&quot;, California authorities inquired the show due to allegations of doping contestants. The show dismissed these allegations as false and without merit. The show is under internal investigation as of July 2018.

===Longitudinal study===
In 2016, the results of a long-term study by the US National Institute of Health (NIH) were released that documented the weight gain and loss of contestants in Season 8, which aired in 2009. The study found that most of the 16 contestants regained their weight, and in some case gained more than before they entered the contest. Their metabolisms had slowed to the point where they were burning hundreds of calories a day less than other people of their new, reduced size. The &quot;New York Times&quot; reported: &quot;What shocked the researchers was what happened next: As the years went by and the numbers on the scale climbed, the contestants&#x27; metabolisms did not recover... It was as if their bodies were intensifying their effort to pull the contestants back to their original weight.&quot; The article quoted Dr. Michael Rosenbaum who said, &quot;The difficulty in keeping weight off reflects biology, not a pathological lack of willpower.&quot;

After the study results were revealed, former contestants demanded NBC to cancel the show.

==Location==
Seasons two and three of &quot;The Biggest Loser&quot; have been filmed at the Hummingbird Nest Ranch. The ranch is an equestrian estate in Simi Valley, California, northwest of Los Angeles. Recent seasons have been filmed at King Gillette Ranch on Mulholland Highway near Malibu Creek State Park.

<text>In computational complexity theory, the complexity class FL is the set of function problems which can be solved by a deterministic Turing machine in a logarithmic amount of memory space. As in the definition of L, the machine reads its input from a read-only tape and writes its output to a write-only tape; the logarithmic space restriction applies only to the read/write working tape.

Loosely speaking, a function problem takes a complicated input and produces a (perhaps equally) complicated output. Function problems are distinguished from decision problems, which produce only Yes or No answers and corresponds to the set [[L (complexity)|L]] of decision problems which can be solved in deterministic logspace. FL is a subset of [[FP (complexity)|FP]], the set of function problems which can be solved in deterministic polynomial time.

FL is known to contain several natural problems, including arithmetic on numbers. Addition, subtraction and multiplication of two numbers are fairly simple, but achieving division is a far deeper problem which was open for decades.

Similarly one may define FNL, which has the same relation with NL as FNP has with NP.

<text>Marjorie Flack (October 22, 1897 - August 29, 1958) was an American artist and writer of children&#x27;s picture books. She was born in Greenport, Long Island, New York in 1897. She was best known for &quot;The Story about Ping&quot; (1933), illustrated by Kurt Wiese, popularized by Captain Kangaroo, and for her stories of an insatiably curious Scottish terrier named Angus, who was actually her dog. Her first marriage was to artist Karl Larsson; she later married poet William Rose Benét. 

Her book &quot;Angus Lost&quot; was featured prominently in the film &quot;Ask the Dust&quot; (2006), starring Colin Farrell and Salma Hayek, in which Farrell&#x27;s character teaches Hayek&#x27;s character, a Mexican, to read English using Flack&#x27;s book.

Flack&#x27;s grandson, Tim Barnum, and his wife, Darlene Enix-Barnum, currently sponsor an annual creative writing award at Anne Arundel Community College. The Marjorie Flack Award for Fiction consists of a $250 prize for the best short story or children&#x27;s storybook written by a current AACC student.

<text>Marianne Weber (born Marianne Schnitger; 2 August 1870 – 12 March 1954) was a German sociologist, women&#x27;s rights activist and the wife of Max Weber.

==Life==

===Childhood, 1870–1893===
Marianne Schnitger was born on 2 August 1870 in Oerlinghausen to medical doctor Eduard Schnitger and his wife, Anna Weber, daughter of a prominent Oerlinghausen businessman Karl Weber. Much of Marianne&#x27;s childhood was characterized by poverty and hardship. After the death of her mother in 1873, she moved to Lemgo and was raised for the next fourteen years by her grandmother and aunt, as her father worked outside of the home. During this time, both her father and his two brothers went mad and were institutionalized. Marianne attained her primary education both at home and at the local village school. When Marianne turned 16, Karl Weber sent her off to fashionable finishing schools in Lemgo and Hanover, from which she graduated when she was 19. After the death of her grandmother in 1889, she lived several years with her mother&#x27;s sister, Alwine, in Oerlinghausen.
In 1891, Marianne began to spend time with the Charlottenburg Webers, Max Jr., and his mother, Helene, in particular. She became very close to Helene, who she would refer to as being &quot;unaware of her own inner beauty&quot;. Marianne formed a strong attachment to Helene and thought of her as the mother that she never had. Helene opened up to Marianne about the domestic abuse she endured during her marriage which later inspired many of Marianne&#x27;s works. During her time with the Webers, she and her cousin Max Weber started courting. In 1893, she and Max Weber married in Oerlinghausen and moved into their apartment in Berlin to pursue their academic careers.

===Marriage, 1893–1920===

During the first few years of their marriage, Max taught in Berlin, then, in 1894, at the University of Heidelberg. During this time, Marianne pursued her own studies. After moving to Freiburg in 1894, she studied with a leading neo-Kantian philosopher, Heinrich Rickert. She also began to engage herself in the women&#x27;s movement after hearing prominent feminist speakers at a political congress in 1895. In 1896, in Heidelberg, she co-founded a society for the circulation of feminist thought. She also worked with Max to raise the level of women students attending the university.

In 1898, Max suffered a psychological collapse, possibly brought on after his father&#x27;s death, which happened shortly after Max confronted him regarding abuse of Helene. Between 1898 and 1904, Max withdrew from public life, moving in and out of mental institutions, traveling compulsively and resigning from his prominent position at University of Heidelberg. During this time, their roles reversed somewhat; as Max worked toward recovery and rested at home, Marianne cared for Max as well as attended political meetings on Max&#x27;s behalf; sometimes until late at night, and published her first book in 1900: &quot;Fichtes Sozialismus und sein Verhältnis zur Marxschen Doktrin&quot; (&quot;Fichte&#x27;s Socialism and its Relation to Marxist Doctrine&quot;).

In 1904, the Webers toured America. In America, Marianne met both Jane Addams and Florence Kelley, both staunch feminists and active political reformers Also during that year, Max re-entered the public sphere, publishing, among other things, &quot;The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism&quot;. Marianne also continued her own scholarship, publishing in 1907 her landmark work &quot;Ehefrau und Mutter in der Rechtsentwicklung&quot; (&quot;Wife and Mother in the Development of Law&quot;).

In 1907, Karl Weber died, and left enough money to his granddaughter Marianne for the Webers to live comfortably. During this time, Marianne first established her intellectual salon. Between 1907 and the start of World War I, Marianne enjoyed a rise in her status as an intellectual and a scholar as she published &quot;The Question of Divorce&quot; (1909), &quot;Authority and Autonomy in Marriage&quot; (1912) and &quot;On the Valuation of Housework&quot; (1912), and &quot;Women and Objective Culture&quot; (1913). While the Webers presented a united front in public life, as Max defended his wife from her scholarly detractors, Max carried on an affair with Else Jaffe, a mutual friend.

In 1914, World War I broke out. While Max busied himself publishing his multi-volume study of religion, lecturing, organizing military hospitals, serving as an adviser in peace negotiations and running for office in the new Weimar Republic, Marianne published many works, among which were: &quot;The New Woman&quot; (1914), &quot;The Ideal of Marriage&quot; (1914), &quot;War as an Ethical Problem&quot; (1916), &quot;Changing Types of University Women&quot; (1917), &quot;The Forces Shaping Sexual Life&quot; (1919) and &quot;Women&#x27;s Special Cultural Tasks&quot; (1919).

In 1918, Marianne Weber became a member of the German Democratic Party and, shortly thereafter, the first woman elected as a delegate in the federal state parliament of Baden. In 1919, she assumed the role of chairwoman of the Bund Deutscher Frauenvereine (League of German Women&#x27;s Associations), an office she would hold until 1923. In 1920, Max&#x27;s sister Lili suddenly committed suicide, and Max and Marianne adopted her four children. This provided Marianne some solace from Max&#x27;s affair. Shortly thereafter, Max Weber contracted pneumonia and died suddenly on 14 June 1920, leaving Marianne a widow with four children to raise. 

===Widowhood, 1920–1954===

Following Max&#x27;s unexpected death, Marianne withdrew from public and social life, funneling her physical and psychological resources into preparing ten volumes of her husband&#x27;s writing for publication. In 1924, she received an honorary doctoral degree from the University of Heidelberg, both for her work in editing and publishing Max&#x27;s work as well as for her own scholarship. Between 1923 and 1926, Weber worked on &quot;Max Weber: Ein Lebensbild&quot; (&quot;Max Weber: A Biography&quot;), which was published in 1926. Also in 1926, she re-established her weekly salon, and entered into a phase of public speaking in which she spoke to audiences of up to 5,000. During this phase, she continued to raise Lili&#x27;s children with the help of a close-knit circle of friends.

====Marianne Weber in Nazi Germany====
Weber&#x27;s career as a feminist public speaker ended abruptly in 1935 when Hitler dissolved the League of German Women&#x27;s Associations. During the time of the Nazi regime up until the Allied Occupation of Germany in 1945, she held a weekly salon. While criticisms of Nazi atrocities were sometimes subtly implied, she told interviewer Howard Becker in 1945 that &quot;we restricted ourselves to philosophical, religious and aesthetic topics, making our criticism of the Nazi system between the lines, as it were. None of us were the stuff of which martyrs were made.&quot; Weber claimed, however, to know people who had been involved in the July Plot.

Weber continued to write during this time, however, and published &quot;Frauen und Liebe&quot; (&quot;Women and Love&quot;) in 1935 and &quot;Erfülltes Leben&quot; (&quot;The Fulfilled Life&quot;) in 1942.

====Later life====
After World War II had ended, Marianne began writing her own memoirs. On 12 March 1954, Weber died in Heidelberg.

==Work==

===Themes===
The basis of Weber&#x27;s sociology was that of a woman in a patriarchal society. She wrote about the experiences of German women of her time, many of whom were entering the workforce for the very first time. This new exposure of women to the outside world led to shifting gender-based power dynamics within the household. The male-created and male-dominated institutions of law, religion, history and the economy provide a framework for the lives of women, whose autonomy suffers as a result. Weber also felt that the framework and structures of marriage could be used as a case study for the larger society, as marriage, and the destiny of women to be married, is central to the lives of women and could be seen across the spectrum of law, religion, history, and economy. She acknowledged that while marriage could restrict the lives of women, it could also serve as a form of protection for women, serving to undermine &quot;the brutal power of men by contract&quot;. Weber&#x27;s work, especially the 1907 &quot;Wife and Mother in the Development of Law&quot;, was devoted to the analysis of the institution of marriage. Her conclusion was that marriage is &quot;a complex and ongoing negotiation over power and intimacy, in which money, women&#x27;s work, and sexuality are key issues&quot;.

Another theme in her work was that women&#x27;s work could be used to &quot;map and explain the construction and reproduction of the social person and the social world&quot;. Human work creates cultural products ranging from small, daily values such as cleanliness and honesty to larger, more abstract phenomena like philosophy and language. Between the two extremes lies a vast, unexplored middle territory called &quot;the middle ground of immediate daily life&quot;, in which women, being the caretakers, child-rearers, and everyday economic actors of the family, have a large part. This middle ground is where the self is created, for the most part, Weber argued, and that self then affects other people in its daily actions in the world. She also felt that the continual struggle between the spiritual and the animal is what makes people human and that rather than being a crisis to be resolved, the conflict between the natural and the moral forms the basis of human dignity. This &quot;millennial struggle of human beings for the subordination of instinctual life under the dominion of morally free human will&quot; is a cultural product, for the production of which women are largely responsible. Finally, Weber also felt that differences such as class, education, age, and base ideologies, had an enormous effect on the day-to-day existence of women. She saw that there are profound differences not just between rural and urban women, but also among different types of rural women and different types of urban women. Urban women, of whom Weber was one, were distinguished not just by their husbands&#x27; occupations but also by their own. Within the class of working women, women&#x27;s occupations (traditional women&#x27;s work versus the elite: academics, artists, writers, etc) have an everyday effect on patterns of daily life and lead to differences in needs, lifestyle, and overall ideologies.

===Georg Simmel and Marianne Weber===
There has been discussion of Max Weber&#x27;s scholarly connection to Georg Simmel, particularly in terms of their influence on the Frankfurt School, but Marianne Weber too was a colleague of Simmel. In addition to a more than 20-year friendship, in which Max and Simmel conversed and wrote letters often, Weber wrote a critical response to Simmel&#x27;s 1911 essay &quot;The Relative and the Absolute in the Problem of the Sexes&quot;, in which she criticized his concept of &quot;gender relations&quot;. Both sociologists dealt with the &quot;woman question&quot; and, more broadly, &quot;the interrelation between gendered modes of individuation, social differentiation, and gender difference&quot;.

<text>Olympic Gold is the official video game of the Games of the XXV Olympiad, hosted by Barcelona, Spain in 1992 and released in May 1992 for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis. An 8-bit version was released for the portable Game Gear and the Master System console.

Developed internally by Tiertex, the game was sponsored by Coca-Cola (only the European version) and the game featured both the company logo on a zeppelin above the scoreboard, as well as the company jingle.

The game uses button mashing as the main part of gameplay, but in three events it isn&#x27;t used (archery, diving) or is slow-paced (swimming).

Each computer athlete has a fictional name and nationality (choosing from UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, United States, Japan and the Unified Team, everyone with its own anthem snippet) and actual strengths and weaknesses: &quot;J. Balen&quot;, for instance, is a frequent 100 m and 110 m hurdles record breaker but only an average hammer thrower. Also, each computer-controlled player seems better in a particular event depending on his country: Germans usually take the top spots in archery, Italians on swimming, Russians on pole vault, Americans on sprinting and so on.

==Events==

*100 m
*Hammer throw
*Archery
*110 m hurdles
*Pole vault
*200 m freestyle swimming
*3 m springboard diving

==Competition==
The game allows the player to practice, play mini-Olympics (where some events can be turned off) or full Olympics. There are three difficulty levels (&quot;club&quot;, &quot;national&quot; and &quot;Olympic&quot;) with noticeable differences from each other: computer-controlled athletes are actually capable of breaking world and Olympic records at the higher levels, while achieving only mediocre results on lower levels.

Scoring in the Olympic modes follow the results table by position, the gold medal giving 24 points, and then reducing one point for each competitor behind until the 12th and last receives 13 points. The game is easy for experienced players, except for the sprinting and hurdles events and the hammer, as the computer is able to break records quite easily in &quot;Olympic&quot;, and they also rely on a fair share or luck and random.

Diving, unlike more recent titles where the player simply has to &quot;click-a-long&quot; a predefined sequence of buttons actually gives the player to control their own jumps. This means that one could indicate a jump and make one completely different, resulting in 0.0 notes. However, with practice it&#x27;s perfectly possible to reach marks above 9.0 even for jumps rated 3.5. The same happens with pole vault, as an experienced player is able to clear 6.35 m easily.

==Playable nations==
There is a total of 8 playable countries in the game. They are:
* 
* 
* 
* 

==Development==
The game was showcased at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 1992.

<doc id="1151075" wikidata="Q5632545" url="?curid=1151075" title="HMS Ganges (1821)">
<text>HMS &quot;Ganges&quot; was an 84-gun second-rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy, launched on 10 November 1821 at Bombay Dockyard, constructed from teak. She was the last sailing ship of the Navy to serve as a flagship, and was the second ship to bear the name.

Admiralty orders of 4 June 1816 directed her to be built as a facsimile of HMS &quot;Canopus&quot; (the ex-French ship &quot;Franklin&quot;, which had fought at the Battle of the Nile). Building began in May 1819, under the direction of master shipbuilder Jamsetjee Bomanjee Wadia.

When was paid off at Bombay in January 1822, &quot;Liverpool″&quot;s captain, Francis Augustus Collier, and his officers and crew transferred to the newly built &quot;Ganges&quot; and sailed her back to Spithead, arriving on 6 October 1822.

&quot;Ganges&quot; was commissioned at Portsmouth in 1823, and served in several locations over the following decades. Notable events included a period as flagship of the South America Station for three years, during which she landed Royal Marines in Rio de Janeiro after a mutiny by Brazilian soldiers. She also saw action in the Mediterranean from 1838 to 1840, bombarding Beirut and blockading Alexandria. She was paid off during the Crimean War, and saw no action.

From 1857 to 1861, she was the flagship of the Pacific Station, based at Valparaíso, Chile under the command of Rear admiral Robert Lambert Baynes. She spent considerable time addressing the San Juan Boundary Dispute from the Esquimalt Royal Navy Dockyard at the Colony of Vancouver Island after which she returned to England to be converted into a training ship; she began service as the training ship HMS &quot;Ganges&quot; in 1865 at Mylor Harbour, near Falmouth; in 1899, she was moved to Harwich.

In 1905, she became part of RNTE (Royal Naval Training Establishment) Shotley, which also included the ships HMS &quot;Caroline&quot; and HMS &quot;Boscawen III&quot;.

She was renamed &quot;Tenedos III&quot; in 1906, then moved to Devonport to become part of the training establishment HMS &quot;Indus&quot;; on 13 August 1910, she was renamed &quot;Indus V&quot;. In October 1922, she was renamed &quot;Impregnable III&quot; and transferred to the training establishment HMS &quot;Impregnable&quot;, also at Devonport. She was finally taken out of service in 1923, and transferred to the dockyard; in 1929, she was sold for breaking up. The following year, after over a century in service, she was finally broken up at Plymouth.
Upon breaking, some of the timber was used to make souvenirs, usually having a small brass plaque with some of the ship&#x27;s history attached. 

The panelling in the captain&#x27;s cabin was purchased by Thomas Nelson, 4th Earl Nelson, who installed it in the principal top-floor room at Trafalgar Park in Wiltshire. The captain&#x27;s cabin in the stern was used in the construction of the Burgh Island Hotel in Devon, where it remains to this day. In 1933, timbers from the ship were also used to construct the cross that stands outside the eastern end of Guildford Cathedral in Surrey.

The town of Ganges, British Columbia, on Salt Spring Island, and the adjacent waters of Ganges Harbour are named after HMS &quot;Ganges&quot;. In addition, the transom board of one of HMS &quot;Ganges&quot;″ ship&#x27;s boats has pride of place in Centennial Park in the town of Ganges. The community of Vesuvius Bay, also on Saltspring Island, was named after , which, with &quot;Ganges&quot;, was also assigned to the Pacific Station.

The ship&#x27;s badge has been adopted by the Saltspring Island Sailing Club, and the badge&#x27;s distinctive elephant is the key symbol in the club&#x27;s burgee.

<doc id="1151078" wikidata="Q1373484" url="?curid=1151078" title="Gerry Cheevers">
<text>Gerald Michael Cheevers (born December 7, 1940) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey goaltender who played in the National Hockey League (NHL) and World Hockey Association (WHA) between 1961 and 1980. Cheevers is best known for his two stints with the Boston Bruins, whom he helped win the Stanley Cup in 1970 and 1972. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1985.

He was the first to decorate his goaltender mask with stitch markings where a puck had struck, leading to the contemporary tradition of goaltenders decorating their masks with distinctive stitches.

==Playing career==
Cheevers&#x27;s hockey career began in 1956 at the age of 16 when he played for the St. Michael&#x27;s Majors of the Ontario Hockey Association.

The right to sign him to an NHL contract was held by the Toronto Maple Leafs (with whom he played two games) until the Boston Bruins drafted him in 1965, despite Toronto general manager Punch Imlach trying to slip Cheevers through unselected by listing him as a forward. In the 1964–65 season he won 48 games in leading the Rochester Americans to their first Calder Cup championship, becoming the final goaltender in league history to play every game (coincidentally, he did this one season after his future Bruins teammate Eddie Johnston was the final goaltender to do so in the NHL). Cheevers still holds the AHL record for most victories in a season by a goaltender.

He was claimed that offseason by the Boston Bruins in the Intra-League Draft and saw his first action with the Bruins in the 1966 season, although he spent the bulk of the next two years with the Bruins&#x27; farm club, the Oklahoma City Blazers of the Central Professional Hockey League.

With the six-team expansion in 1967, and the Bruins losing goaltenders Bernie Parent and Doug Favell to the expansion Philadelphia Flyers, Cheevers became the number one goaltender in Boston for the next five seasons.

He was a member of both the 1970 and 1972 Stanley Cup winning teams, gaining a reputation as a driven, &quot;money&quot; goaltender. Cheevers held the Boston Bruins&#x27; record for most playoff wins by a goaltender (with 53) until it was surpassed by Tuukka Rask in 2021. Cheevers had held the record since 1977 when he surpassed Frank Brimsek&#x27;s mark of 32.

In 1972, he went undefeated in 32 consecutive games, an NHL record that still stands.

In the fall of 1972, he jumped to the fledgling World Hockey Association, where he played three and a half seasons for the Cleveland Crusaders. He made the First All-Star Team in 1973 and Second All-Star Team in 1974 and 1975. In 1974, he played seven of the eight games for Team Canada in the 1974 Summit Series. Cheevers sat out the third game since his father was gravely ill in hospital.

Cheevers returned to the Bruins during the 1975–76 season after a financial dispute with the Crusaders&#x27; management. In the 1979–80 season Cheevers and Gilles Gilbert were runners-up for the Vezina Trophy, which was won by Don Edwards and Bob Sauvé of the Buffalo Sabres. He retired at the end of that season.

Cheevers had a career NHL goals against average of 2.89, recorded 230 NHL wins, played in 419 NHL games, and registered 26 NHL shutouts. He is second in the WHA&#x27;s history in career GAA and shutouts, even though he played during only half the league&#x27;s existence. If one combines both their NHL and WHA statistics, Gerry Cheevers (329), Mike Liut (325), and Bernie Parent (304) all would have at least 300 wins. Cheevers was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1985, and is one of the few goaltenders in the Hall to have never been named to the All-Star Team or won the Vezina Trophy.

===Style===
Cheevers was not afraid to stray from the crease to cut down the shooter&#x27;s angle or to act as a &quot;third defenseman&quot;. He was very aggressive with opposing players who strayed into or near the crease and was not afraid to hit opposing players with his goalie stick if they got too close to the crease.

Not a &quot;stand-up&quot; goalie, Cheevers could often be found on his knees or even his side. He perfected this &quot;flopping&quot; style while playing for Rochester during the 1962–63 season. Americans&#x27; coach Rudy Migay had Cheevers practice without his stick, thus requiring him to rely more on using his body and his pads.

===Mask===
Cheevers was inspired to create his distinctive stitch pattern mask when a puck hit him in the face during practice. Cheevers, never one to miss an opportunity to skip out of practice, went to the dressing room. Bruins coach Harry Sinden followed him to the dressing room, where he found Cheevers enjoying a beer and smoking a cigarette. Annoyed, Sinden ordered Cheevers, who wasn&#x27;t injured, to get back on the ice. In jest, John &quot;Frosty&quot; Forristall, the Bruins&#x27; assistant trainer, drew a stitch mark on his mask, which amused the team. After that, any time he was similarly struck, he had a new stitch-mark drawn on his mask. Cheevers later claimed that the mask spared him from over 150 medical stitches over his career and was the first to be custom decorated in the sport. The mask became one of the most recognized of the era, and the original is now on the wall of his grandson&#x27;s bedroom.

Years later, goalie Steve Shields paid tribute to Cheevers when he played for the Bruins in 2002 and 2003, sporting a modern airbrushed version of the stitch-covered mask. In 2008, &quot;The Hockey News&quot; rated his mask the greatest ever by a wide margin. It received 221 of a possible 300 points; Gilles Gratton&#x27;s mask was rated second with 66.

Cheevers&#x27;s mask design has appeared in rock-n-roll culture. Black Veil Brides&#x27; lead singer Andy Biersack cited it as the reason he got interested in hockey and played goalie when he was younger. In homage to Cheevers, Biersack painted stitches on his face for live shows.

===Publications===
In 1971, Cheevers published the book &quot;Goaltender&quot;, detailing his experiences during the 1970–71 season, through to the unexpected loss in the first round to the underdog Montreal Canadiens.

==Coaching career==
Cheevers&#x27;s final season as a player came in 1980 when popular coach Don Cherry was replaced by Fred Creighton. After winning their division in seven of the previous nine seasons, the Bruins were in third place late in the year, and general manager Harry Sinden fired Creighton and took over as coach for the remainder of the season. For the 1980–81 season, Cheevers was named coach. In that year&#x27;s playoffs, the Bruins suffered a shocking sweep by the Minnesota North Stars, who had never before won a game in Boston Garden. Even so, Sinden stuck with Cheevers, who led the Bruins to two first-place and two second-place finishes in their division over the next three years. He led the team to the league&#x27;s best record in the 1982–83 season; in the playoffs, the team fell to the eventual Stanley Cup champions, the New York Islanders, in the semifinals.

Cheevers was replaced by Sinden in the middle of the 1984–85 season. With a record of 204–126–46, he ranks seventh in career winning percentage (.604) among NHL coaches with more than 250 games experience.

==Retirement==
After his departure as Bruins&#x27; coach, Cheevers served as a color commentator for the Hartford Whalers from 1986 to 1995 and the Boston Bruins from 1999 to 2002. From 1995 to 2006 he was a member of the Bruins&#x27; scouting staff. Cheevers has also devoted time to Thoroughbred racing. His most successful runner was the Grade 1 winner Royal Ski. Cheevers frequently made allusions to horse racing during interviews. After playing a particularly good game in the 1972 Stanley Cup playoffs, Cheevers told reporters he &quot;felt like Riva Ridge&quot;—the horse that had recently won the 1972 Kentucky Derby.

Cheevers lives in Everett, Massachusetts.

===Popular culture===
In 1996, Canadian pop-punk band Chixdiggit released their self-titled album on SubPop, and included the song &quot;I Feel Like Gerry Cheevers (Stitchmarks On My Heart).&quot; The lyrics include references to Cheevers&#x27;s undefeated streak, the stitch marks drawn for every shot that hit his cheek, and his number 30 jersey. The chorus includes the lyrics &quot;he wore a mask just like my heart, it had stitch marks on every part.&quot;

<doc id="1151084" wikidata="Q905270" url="?curid=1151084" title="ANSI.SYS">
<text>ANSI.SYS is a device driver in the DOS family of operating systems that provides extra console functions through ANSI escape sequences. It is partially based upon a subset of the text terminal control standard proposed by the ANSI X3L2 Technical Committee on Codes and Character Sets (the &quot;X3 Committee&quot;).

As it was not installed by default, and was notoriously slow, little software took advantage of it and instead resorted to directly manipulating the IBM PC hardware. A number of third-party alternatives that ran at reasonable speed were created, such as , and to attempt to change this.

==Usage==
To use under DOS, a line is added to the (or under Windows NT based versions of Windows) file that reads:

:DEVICE=&quot;drive:&quot;\&quot;path&quot;\ANSI.SYS &quot;options&quot;

where &quot;drive:&quot; and &quot;path&quot; are the drive letter and path to the directory in which the file is found, and &quot;options&quot; can be a number of optional switches to control the behaviour. may also be loaded into upper memory via /.

* use extended keyboard BIOS functions (INT 16h) rather than standard ones This made the F11 and F12 keys work.
* force number of lines
* adjust line scrolling to support screen readers
* or set screensize
* support redefinition of extended key codes independent of standard codes

==Functionality==
Using this driver, programs that write to the standard output can write escape sequences to make use of the 16 text foreground colors and 8 background colors available in VGA-compatible text mode, make text blink, change the location of the cursor on the screen, and blank the screen. They could also change the video mode from standard 80×25 text mode to a number of different graphics modes (for example, 320×200 graphics mode with text drawn as pixels, though ANSI.SYS is not able to turn individual pixels on and off).

The standard is very slow as it maps escape sequences to BIOS calls (which managed to be designed so that &quot;two&quot; calls were needed to put a character on the screen and move the cursor right). Several companies made third-party replacements such as that interface directly with the video memory, in a similar way to most DOS programs that have a full-screen user interface.

 checked if this driver was in use, and changed the command to use an escape sequence instead of a BIOS call.

===Keyboard remapping===
An interesting (mis)feature of is the ability to remap any key on the keyboard in order to perform shortcuts or macros for complex instructions. Using special escape sequences, the user can define any keystroke that has a character-code mapping to simulate an arbitrary sequence of such keystrokes. This was used to create simple trojans out of text files laced with nefarious keyboard remaps, known as &quot;ANSI bombs&quot;. A number of products were released to protect users against this:
* Many replacements for support a command line switch to disable the key remapping feature, f.e. the option (Secure) in Datalight ROM-DOS or NANSI.SYS of FreeDOS. Other ANSI drivers like ANSIPLUS can be configured to disable the redefinition of keys as well.
* Some replacements were deliberately designed never to support the keyboard remapping functions.
* PKWARE produced a terminate-and-stay-resident program, PKSFANSI (PK Safe ANSI), which filters out keyboard remapping escape codes as they are written to the standard output. This has the advantage that the user can load some useful remappings from a text file and then run PKSFANSI to prevent further, possibly malicious remappings.

==Occurrence==
 appeared in MS-DOS 2.0, the first version of the operating system supporting device drivers. It was supported by all following versions of MS-DOS. It is also present in many non-Microsoft DOS systems, e.g. IBM PC DOS and DR-DOS.

 was required to run some software that used its cursor and color control functions. It could also be used to enable elaborate color codes in the prompt. These uses were overshadowed by the use of in BBSes; ANSI escape sequences were used to enable BBSes to send text graphics more elaborate than ASCII art, and to control the cursor in ways that were used in a number of online games and similar features.

Most versions of Windows did not support ANSI escape codes in any useful way (it could be used by MSDOS emulation in some versions). In Windows 10 support for similar escape sequences was built into the Win32 console (the text terminal window), but must be activated using the Windows API function by setting the flag.

==Features==
CSI (Control Sequence Introducer) is a placeholder for the common two-byte escape lead-in sequence &quot;&quot; (that is, ). The ANSI standard also defines an alternative single-byte CSI code , which is not supported by ANSI.SYS (this code instead drew a cent sign from CP437).

Standard DOS drivers support only the following sub-set of ANSI escape sequences:

There are also some escape sequences specific to the implementation of . They are not generally supported by ANSI consoles in other operating systems.


In some DOS implementations, video modes above 7 are not documented. Under Multiuser DOS, the only valid argument in conjunction with PCTERM is 7.

<doc id="1151087" wikidata="Q699327" url="?curid=1151087" title="Wang Ming">
<text>Wang Ming (; May 23, 1904 – March 27, 1974) was a senior leader of the early Chinese Communist Party (CCP). He led the CCP delegation to the Communist International (Comintern) from 1931 to 1937. After returning to China, he came into conflict with Mao Zedong.

From 1925 to 1929, Wang studied in Moscow at the Sun Yat-sen University, where he was a supporter of Joseph Stalin&#x27;s during the Soviet Union&#x27;s leadership struggles. After returning to China, he was briefly purged by Li Lisan&#x27;s faction before being fully reinstated in late 1930. In January 1931, he was promoted to the Politburo and rose rapidly in importance during a time of high attrition in the CCP&#x27;s top leadership due to purges, arrests, and flights into hiding. Wang became the CCP&#x27;s leading representative to the Comintern and left for Moscow in October 1931. In that role, he helped promote the idea of an alliance between the CCP and the Kuomintang (KMT) to resist Japanese imperialism, which would eventually come to fruition as the Second United Front. After he returned to China in 1937, Wang vocally opposed what he saw as Mao&#x27;s &quot;nationalist deviation&quot; from orthodox Marxism–Leninism. According to Mao, Wang epitomized the intellectualism and foreign dogmatism Mao criticized in his essays &quot;On Practice&quot; and &quot;On Contradiction&quot;.

==Early life==
On May 23, 1904, Wang Ming was born in Jinzhai, Anhui, as Chen Shaoyu () to a poor peasant family. In 1920, he entered the Zhicheng Elementary School in Gushi County. Wang then entered the Third Agricultural School of the Anhui Province, which was founded by the revolutionary Zhu Yunshan. Zhu had a strong influence on the school&#x27;s students, introducing many progressive journals and books such as &quot;New Youth&quot; and &quot;Communism ABC&quot;. In the school, Wang would encounter another strong influential figure in his life, A Ying, his teacher. A Ying would teach Wang about Vladimir Lenin and Chen Duxiu.

During his school years, Wang was also active in the political movement. He led boycotts of Japanese products and corrupt elections. After his graduation in 1924, Wang enrolled in the Wuchang Business School, where he studied for a year. There he published several articles on revolution and communism. That same year he joined the May 30 Movement, which involved strikes and protests against imperialism during the Northern Expedition in Wuchang. In the summer of 1924, Wang joined the CCP.

==From Moscow to Shanghai==
In November 1925, the CCP sent Wang to Moscow Sun Yat-sen University in Russia. During this time, Wang mastered both the Russian language and Marxist–Leninist theory, becoming known by the Russian name Ivan Andreevich Golubev () or simply Golubev. It was also during this time that Wang encountered his first major political adversary, Ren Zhuoxuan. Ren was appointed as the secretary of the university&#x27;s student CCP branch. Eventually Wang&#x27;s eloquence won over Ren&#x27;s authoritarian style in various debates. Consequently, in April 1926, Wang was elected as chairman of the university&#x27;s CCP branch. After the election, Pavel Mif, the university&#x27;s vice president, became fond of Wang. In January 1927, when Mif came to China as the head of a Soviet delegation, Wang was his interpreter.

After the CCP&#x27;s split with the Kuomintang (KMT) in 1927, Wang and Mif attended the CCP&#x27;s 5th National Congress in Wuhan, after which Wang became Secretary for the CCP&#x27;s Propaganda Department for two months. Wang was also a part-time editor of the &quot;Guidance&quot; journal where he published a few articles. After the July 15 coup in Wuhan, Wang returned to Moscow with Mif.

After the purge of Karl Radek by Joseph Stalin, Mif was appointed as president of Moscow Sun Yat-sen University, and then Vice Minister of the Eastern Department of Comintern. For his service and loyalty, Wang became Mif&#x27;s protégé. The circle of Chinese students centered around Mif, which included Wang as well as Zhang Wentian, Bo Gu and Wang Jiaxiang, became known as the &quot;28 Bolsheviks&quot; because of their strict adherence to the official party line. There was an ongoing struggle between Trotskyists and Stalinists among the Chinese students, and Wang was involved in suppressing the Trotskyists.

In early 1929, Wang left Sun Yat-sen University to return to China. Wang began dating Meng Qingshu, who later became his wife. Wang was then transferred to the Propaganda Department of CCP, where Li Lisan was the incumbent minister. During a half year from 1929 to 1930, Wang published many articles in the party newspaper &quot;Red Flag&quot; and magazine &quot;Bolshevik&quot;, which supported the leftism embraced by Li. In 1930, when Wang attended a secret meeting in Shanghai, he was promptly arrested. But Wang was lucky enough to be ignored by the KMT secret police, who had no idea what value this young man might be to them. Wang was soon released after bribing the guard. Wang was transferred to CCP&#x27;s Central Labor Union after his release. Although Wang was a leftist and abided by Communist dogma strictly in essence, his beliefs were different from those of Li. Wang was more strict about adhering to the policies of the Comintern. He quickly found a temporary alliance with old CCP members, labor activists such as He Mengxiong (), Lin Yunan (, a relative of Lin Biao) against Li. In a meeting, Wang argued with Li and offended him. As a price for his being impulsive and immature, Wang was discharged from his position and demoted to the Jiangsu division of CCP.

In August 1930, the Comintern sent Zhou Enlai and Qu Qiubai back to China to reign in Li Lisan&#x27;s aggressive policy. However, the CCP did not adopt any meaningful policy changes at the 3rd Plenum of the Sixth Central Committee in September. This led the Comintern to order Li Lisan himself to come to Moscow, and Pavel Mif was sent to China ensure a new policy was implemented. Mif arrived in December. The CCP issued a resolution renouncing Li Lisan&#x27;s extremist policies from the previous year, and on December 16, they reversed Wang Ming&#x27;s punishment.

At the Fourth Plenum of the Sixth Central Committee in January 1931, Wang&#x27;s was promoted to a position on the CCP&#x27;s Politburo, although he was not given a seat on the Standing Committee. He was not a Commissioner of the Central Committee of CCP yet, this being a prerequisite for being a politburo member under the system proposed by Wang himself.

The first half of 1931 saw a number of senior Communists in Shanghai expelled from the party for supporting Li Lisan&#x27;s policies or captured by the Kuomintang thanks to the defection of Gu Shunzhang. According to Ben Macintyre, Wang Ming may also have been responsible for some of the arrests. On January 17, 36 Communists, including five leaders of the League of Left-Wing Writers, were arrested by the KMT. Macintyre writes that Wang &quot;regarded the League as a cover for &#x27;dissenting comrades&#x27; and wanted them killed. 23 were executed the next month. By April, part of party leadership left the cities for security. These arrests, expulsions, and departures left the Politburo members who remained in Shanghai in a position to dominate the party. On June 22, the General Secretary himself, Xiang Zhongfa, was arrested and quickly executed by the KMT. After Xiang&#x27;s death, Wang Ming, Zhou Enlai, and became the most important CCP leaders left in the city. However, they would not remain their long. In October, Wang Ming left Shanghai for Moscow as the CCP&#x27;s representative to the Comintern, a position he would retain for the next six years.

==CCP&#x27;s representative to the Comintern==
From November 1931 to November 1937, Wang worked and lived in Moscow as director of the CCP&#x27;s delegation to the Comintern. During that period, he was elected as Executive Commissioner, member of the Presidium, and Alternate General of the Comintern. This indicated his prominence and popularity in the Comintern.

During this period, the CCP suffered major defeats in both urban and rural areas against the KMT and made a strategic retreat in the Long March. At the Zunyi Conference, Wang and the 28 Bolsheviks lost the support of key party and Red Army leaders; Bo Gu, Zhou Enlai and Otto Braun were criticized for their poor strategy. Zhang Wentian succeeded Bo Gu as provisional party leader. Mao emerged from Zunyi as the politburo&#x27;s dominant member with the support of the army and his opponents discredited.

The Japanese invasion of Manchuria in November 1931 posed a clear threat to both sides of the Chinese Civil War (as well as to the Soviet Union), but it did not lead to an immediate cessation of hostilities. The failure of the First United Front four years previously had created deep, lasting distrust. Chiang Kai-shek articulated his policy as &quot;first internal pacification, then external resistance.&quot; The CCP called for simultaneously &quot;Resisting Japan and Opposing Chiang&quot;. 

But by 1935, the Comintern had decided that the threat posed by Japan in Asia and the rise of Adolf Hitler in Europe called for a less dogmatic response. The 7th World Congress of the Comintern called for Communist parties to participate in &quot;anti-fascist united fronts&quot; across the globe. In July 1935, Wang had begun work on a document that explained how the new policy would apply to China. This was published in October, but was dated August 1, and subsequently became know as the &quot;1 August Declaration&quot;. It called on all parties in China to form a united front against Japanese Imperialism and proposed creating a united government of national defense. Importantly, though, the offer did not extend to Chiang himself; Wang and the rest of the CCP delegation still considered him and his central government the &quot;running dog&quot; of the Japanese.

However, the attitude of Wang Ming and the Comintern towards Chiang began to shift when the full details of the Long March and the CCP&#x27;s devastating defeats in south China reached Moscow. Wang Ming even published a series of articles where he called for Chiang to either join an anti-Japanese united front or be overthrown by KMT patriots. But historians disagree on how seriously to take this change in tone: Michael Sheng dismisses the articles as propaganda intended to encourage anti-Chiang dissent in the KMT, whereas Gao Hua argues that Wang sincerely believed that Chiang could and should be brought into a united front. In either case, this propaganda line was abandoned after Chiang suppressed the December 9th Movement.

The CCP itself (cut off from radio communication with Moscow) learned of the 1 August Declaration in November 1935. Party leaders held a conference at Wayaobu in December to discuss the implications of this new policy. Their Wayaobu Manifesto marked an important retreat from the hardline positions they had held during the early civil war. It called for &quot;the most broad national united front&quot; to resist Japan, and announced that the CCP would suspend class conflict in the interests of cross-class collaboration. However, it also made clear that they did not want to give up their military strength. As a basis from which to resist the Japanese, the Manifesto called for the Red Army to be expanded to 1 million men and for the Chinese Soviet to dramatically increase its land area.

Over the course of the year, the Comintern became more convinced that the united front should include Chiang. Wang Ming was reluctant to accept this idea. In March, when the Comintern abandoned the slogan &quot;resist Japan and oppose Chiang&quot;, he suggested replacing it with &quot;resist Japan and oppose the villain&quot;. In June, when the Liangguang Incident took place, Wang Ming supported the uprising against Chiang even after &quot;Pravda&quot; condemned it. In late June, the CCP re-established radio communications with Moscow. They transmitted the Wayaobu Manifesto and informed the Comintern of their alliance with Zhang. They asked for assistance in carrying out their plan to form an anti-Japan, anti-Chiang base. The Comintern responded with a telegram on August 15 admonishing the CCP for continuing to oppose Chiang. The Comintern did approve the other provisions of the Wayaobu Manifesto, agreeing that neither soviet power nor the independence of the Red Army should be sacrificed. But they absolutely vetoed the CCP&#x27;s plan to form a base in the northwest, knowing that such a move would scuttle any chance for a united front with the KMT. The CCP accepted the new directive from the Comintern. They adopted the new slogan &quot;compelling Chiang to resist Japan,&quot; and Pan Hannian was sent to Nanjing to begin negotiating a truce with Chen Lifu. 

When the Soviets sharply criticized the CCP for failing to include Chiang in their plans for a united front, Wang joined in their criticisms. However, head of the Comintern Georgi Dimitrov pointed out that many of the criticisms Wang was making against the CCP could just as easily be made against Wang&#x27;s attitude for the past few months. The Soviets asked the CCP to send a replacement for Wang, although he remained on for almost a year until his replacement arrived.

With the occurrence of the Xi&#x27;an Incident in 1936, the Marco Polo Bridge Incident and the Shanghai Hongqiao Airport Incident in 1937, a general war between China and Japan was unavoidable. Wang&#x27;s blueprint for a united front against Japan was under construction, with the Red Army of the CCP transferred into the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army fighting against Japan.

Wang was sent back to Yan&#x27;an in July 1937 when Wang Jiaxiang arrived to take up his place. After the return of Wang, Mao expressed his respect for Wang as an envoy of the Comintern and for his great influence for putting forward the concept of United Front against Japan. Possibly Mao wanted to appeal to the Comintern and Soviet Union behind Wang, from whom Mao desperately needed support both in money and weaponry. So when Wang brought forward a new list of leaders of CCP, Mao showed his humility by putting Wang in the first place. Wang demoted his former ally Zhang Wentian from the number 1 place to the number 7 place, which weakened his own camp and created new opponents by driving Zhang to Mao&#x27;s group.

Wang, Kang and Chen were elected into the new politburo, with Wang as secretariat for the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the CCP which was in charge of the daily operation of CCP headquarters. Chen was in charge of organization and Kang in charge of security, but oddly enough, Chen and Kang turned to Mao&#x27;s camp, and as a result, Wang lost two important potential supporters. Moreover, when Wang passed by Xinjiang during his trip to China, he ordered Deng Fa, the notorious security boss for CCP, to arrest senior leaders of CCP Yu Xiusong, Huang Cao, Li Te and two others, who were his former opponents now working for the warlord Sheng Shicai under the direction of CCP. Five of them were tortured and executed in the prison of Sheng, accused of being Trotskyists. When Wang boasted about his dirty work to Zhang Guotao, Zhang, who was regarded as dissident himself, was greatly irritated, for he had known these old CCP members quite well and worried about being persecuted himself. After this incident, Zhang despised Wang and would never support him.

When Wang returned to Yan&#x27;an, he was admired by most of the CCP members as a talent of Marxism for his erudition and deep insights into Marxism and Leninism. Some senior CCP leaders, including Zhou Enlai and Peng Dehuai, showed their respect for Wang, which reportedly made Mao jealous and irritated.

Furthermore, Wang began to disagree with Mao over major issues on the United Front. Wang believed all CCP work should be carried out within the framework of the United Front; Mao insisted CCP should maintain its independence from the United Front instead. In order to enforce his policy, Wang made the mistake of leaving the position of Secretariat of the CCP in charge of the daily operations of the CCP headquarters, and went for the position of General Secretary of the Yangtze Division of CCP to handle United Front issues with the KMT in Wuhan, which meant Wang had left the power base in Yan&#x27;an, with Mao now able to use all means to strengthen his power grip without any interference.

==Decline==
In its battle against Imperial Japan, the KMT suffered great losses due to internal corruption, incompetence in military command, outdated military supplies and logistics, and the general strength of the Japanese military. As a strong advocate of the United Front, Wang was damaged as well by the KMT&#x27;s failure in the battlefield as the KMT forces bore the brunt of the fighting; under Mao&#x27;s urging the Communists rarely engaged the Japanese army in significant battles. After the KMT lost the battles of Xuzhou and Wuhan, in 1938, Wang suffered a heavy blow as the Yangtze Division was abolished and he himself was dismissed back to Yan&#x27;an. Yan&#x27;an was divided into the Southern China and Central Plain Divisions, led by Zhou Enlai and Liu Shaoqi respectively; this was part of Mao&#x27;s plot to break up the alliance of Wang and Zhou, and to promote his associate Liu. Wang was called back to Yan&#x27;an to await his fate.

Wang was reassigned to several insignificant ceremonial jobs. Moreover, Mao deprived Wang of authority by use of propaganda, preventing Wang from publishing his opinions and articles. With the dissolution of the Comintern in 1943, Wang lost all hope for saving his political life. In 1942 Mao launched the Yan&#x27;an Rectification Movement against dogmatism and empiricism. Wang became Mao&#x27;s main target as representative of dogmatism and Zhou as representative of empiricism. Although Wang experienced great humiliation, he was still fortunate to escape from tortures similar to those inflicted by Kang Sheng&#x27;s secret police on other CCP members. Nonetheless, in his later book &quot;50 Years of the CPC&quot;, and in &quot;Yan&#x27;an Diary&quot;, written by a reporter from the Soviet Union, Wang accused Mao of plotting to murder him by poison. Although there are still disagreements over this accusation, Wang&#x27;s health was certainly greatly damaged under this stress.

In the later stages of the Rectification Campaign, Wang was forced to make a confession and apology in a public meeting. It was only after Mao received a telegram from Georgi Dimitrov that he stopped the persecution. As a show of leniency and a sign of appeasement to Dimitrov (and the Soviet Union standing behind him), Mao placed Wang on the CCP&#x27;s Central Committee in the 7th National Congress (It is noteworthy that back in 1931, Dimitrov and his wife Roza Yulievna Fleishmann had adopted Fani, Wang&#x27;s daughter.) Eventually, as Wang&#x27;s credibility and influence waned, Moscow&#x27;s leaders began to acknowledge Mao&#x27;s leadership.

During the period of the Chinese Civil War, Wang was appointed as director of policy research of the CCP and responsible for some insignificant legislative work.

==From Beijing to Moscow==

It was only after the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949, that Wang reappeared from the shadows on to the political stage. He was elected as director of the Central Legal Committee of the CCP and the Central People&#x27;s Government. Before he was elected as commissioner of the Central Committee of CCP in the 8th National Congress of CCP in 1956, Wang went to Moscow for medical treatment and would never return.

Wang wrote many articles denouncing the CCP during the conflict between the CCP and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in the 1960s and 1970s. His memoirs did provide some useful information about CCP history. Above all, Wang was lucky to escape the persecution of the Cultural Revolution, and lived in peace until his death in 1974 in Moscow.

<doc id="1151093" wikidata="Q617714" url="?curid=1151093" title="David Busst">
<text>David John Busst ( ; born 30 June 1967) is an English football manager and former professional player who played as a centre-back from 1992 until 1996. 

Having started his career with non-League Moor Green, he moved to Premier League side Coventry City in 1992. Having made over 50 appearances for the Sky Blues, he suffered a broken leg during a match with Manchester United in 1996 which ended his career. His injury is often considered the worst in the history of the Premier League. 

He moved into management following his retirement with Solihull Borough in 2001, and later took charge of Evesham United. He came out of retirement in 2008 as defensive cover for Highgate United.

==Early life==
Busst was born in Birmingham, West Midlands.

==Club career==
Busst played as a defender, and started his career at non-League side Moor Green in Birmingham, before moving to Premier League side Coventry City in 1992. He made his professional debut in an FA Cup match against Norwich City on 13 January 1993, and his Premier League debut three days later against the same side. He made ten league appearances in his first professional season, and went on to make 50 league appearances in total for the club, scoring four goals.

===Injury===
Busst&#x27;s professional playing career came to an end on 8 April 1996, while playing for Coventry against Manchester United. Two minutes into the match, having ventured forward after his team won a corner, he collided with United players Denis Irwin and Brian McClair, resulting in extensive compound fractures to both the tibia and fibula of his right leg. The match was delayed for nine minutes while Busst was treated and removed from the field on a stretcher, and blood was cleaned off the grass with water and sand. Manchester United&#x27;s goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel vomited on the pitch upon seeing the injury. Schmeichel later said that the injury preyed on his mind until two years later, when he and Busst met and discussed the accident. The injury is often described as one of the worst in the history of football.

Busst&#x27;s injuries were so bad that at one point he ran the risk of having his leg amputated. While in hospital, he contracted methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which caused further damage to the tissue and muscle in the injured part of his leg. Despite having 22 operations, Busst remained a member of the official Coventry squad for a further seven months, but never played professionally again, and he retired from the game on 6 November 1996 on medical advice, as his doctors had warned him that he would never regain sufficient fitness to play professional football. It was not the break itself that ended his career, but the following infections. Just weeks before his retirement, Busst had been hoping to return to training the following spring and be ready for first team action by the start of the 1997–98 season.

His testimonial match, played on 16 May 1997 against Manchester United, was a sell-out. England internationals Paul Gascoigne and Les Ferdinand guested for Coventry in the game, which was also the last game that United captain Eric Cantona played before he announced his retirement as a player two days later.

==Post-retirement career==
Since his retirement, Busst has worked for Coventry&#x27;s backroom staff, working for their Football in the Community programme, of which he became director.

Busst also trained as a coach, earning UEFA coaching badges. He went on to manage the non-League sides Solihull Borough (from 2000 until 2003) and Evesham United (from 2003 to 2006.)

<text>Teresa Daly (born February 22, 1956, in Minneapolis, Minnesota) is an American politician. She is a city councilwoman, and former candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives.

She graduated from Bloomington Jefferson High School and Macalester College, and then went on to receive her Master&#x27;s Degree in Industrial Relations from the University of Minnesota. For 12 years, she served as Senior Vice President for Right Management Consultants. She is currently the President of the Association of Career Professionals International.

In 2002, she was elected to the Burnsville, Minnesota City Council, and in 2004, she was the DFL candidate for the United States House of Representatives for Minnesota&#x27;s 2nd congressional district, as a challenger against Republican incumbent John Kline. She lost the election by 57% to 40% (with 3% for independent Doug Williams), a smaller-than-average margin for challengers to House incumbents in the 2004 election, although a slightly larger margin than that by which the same 2nd district voters voted for President Bush over John Kerry. After the election, she announced her intention not to run for Congress again and abandoned her campaign website.

<doc id="1151101" wikidata="Q5117037" url="?curid=1151101" title="St Francis Xavier Church, Liverpool">
<text>St Francis Xavier&#x27;s Church is a Roman Catholic church in Salisbury Street, Everton, Liverpool, Merseyside, England. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. It is an active parish church in the Archdiocese of Liverpool and the Pastoral Area of Liverpool North. 

==History==

The Jesuits (members of the Society of Jesus) staffed St Francis Xavier&#x27;s church from its foundation until Easter 2023.

In 1840 the laymen who formed the Society of St Francis Xavier decided at a meeting in the Rose and Crown pub, Cheapside, that, as the number of Roman Catholics in Liverpool was growing rapidly, a new church was needed. The foundation stone was laid in 1842 and Joseph John Scoles was appointed as architect. Scoles went on to design the Church of the Immaculate Conception, Farm Street in London, St Ignatius Church in Preston, and was the father of Ignatius Scoles, SJ, who designed St Wilfrid&#x27;s Church also in Preston. The church opened on 4 December 1848. The spire was added in 1883. The church had been designed to hold 1,000 people but this proved to be insufficient for the congregation and in 1888 an additional chapel, the Sodality Chapel designed by Edmund Kirby, was opened. In 1898 the wall dividing the Sodality Chapel from the main part of the church was demolished.

The church contains outstanding examples of Victorian statuary and many fittings, including work by Conrad Dressler. It has a collection of Victorian and early 20th century vestments, which are complemented by the addition of modern banners and vestments designed by Sr Anthony, SND, and made by David Pegler of the Metropolitan Cathedral&#x27;s embroidery studios. In 2007 a shrine to St Mary del Quay – named after the first (1207) chapel in Liverpool – was unveiled at the rear of the Lady Chapel to commemorate the 750th anniversary of the granting of Liverpool&#x27;s charter by King John.

By the time of the Second World War, St Francis Xavier&#x27;s was the largest Roman Catholic parish in England, containing over 13,000 Catholics. During the war the church was damaged, particularly the roof, and most of the windows were blown out. From the 1960s the church went into decline, mainly due to the demolition of housing in the parish and the relocation of the majority of the parishioners to other parts of the city. At that time several high-rise blocks of flats were erected in the neighbourhood, but soon vandalised and ultimately demolished. For many years the area around the church was left empty and neglected. Slowly low density housing was built in Everton, mainly occupied by non-church attenders.

In 1981 plans were afoot to demolish the nave, however it was saved following a popular, national campaign. The archdiocese only agreed to support the maintenance of the Sodality chapel, the nave being looked after by the parish. Subsequently, the archdiocese erected a glass screen between the Sodality Chapel and the nave – renovating the chapel, though doing nothing to the nave – which slowly deteriorated. With a change of Jesuit staff a new energy amongst the remaining and former parishioners ensured that by 1997, the 150th anniversary of the opening of the church would be celebrated. A flower festival, celebratory dinner for 600 people in St George&#x27;s Hall, and an anniversary mass – with the church full to overflowing – helped to overcome the period of decline. In 2001 the parish was combined with the parishes of St Joseph and St Mary of the Angels and the Sodality Chapel was renamed The Chapel of St Mary of the Angels and St Joseph.

The former schools (Infants, Junior, Senior, and Jesuit College) which had been left derelict from the early 1980s were taken over by Liverpool Hope University in the late 1990s. They now form their Creative Campus, accommodating their arts and drama departments.

Alumni of the SFX schools include: John Gregson, Charlie Chaplin, Bishops Vincent Malone and Paul Gallagher, and the playwright Jimmy McGovern. Archbishop Thomas Roberts SJ, a local man, was consecrated archbishop of Bombay in SFX. Jesuit poet Fr Gerard Manley Hopkins, ministered at the parish for two years and is commemorated by a plaque near to the Langsdale St entrance.

==Architecture==
===Exterior===
The church is built in stone with Welsh slate roofs. Its plan consists of an eight-bay nave with north and south aisles under separate gabled roofs, and a short one-bay chancel with chapels to the north and south. To the southwest is a tower with a spire and to the southeast is the Sodality Chapel. This chapel is polygonal in plan with apse at the west and an ambulatory at the east end.

In 2000 the roof was replaced and since then the building was rewired and a new heating system installed. Heritage Lottery grants paid for the exterior stonework being renovated and &#x27;The Friends of SFX&#x27; association paid for several small-scale improvements, including the renovation of a stained glass window of St Ignatius which was blown out during the blitz and discovered in a box in the church attic.

===Interior===
The high altar and reredos are in white Caen limestone and include arcades and pinnacles; they were designed by S. J. Nicholl. In the side chapels – dedicated to the Sacred Heart and to Our Lady of the Rosary – are similar altars and reredoses. The side wall of Sacred Heart chapel also contains a fine, life-size carving of Christus Consolator – a copy of the famous painting by Ari Schaffer. The pulpit is made of Caen stone and an elaborate font is situated at the west end of the nave below the organ loft. Stained glass windows in the church are by Hardman and Powell; those behind the high altar and on the altars either side were blown out by the explosion of a nearby incendiary bomb during the Second World War and replaced in 1945. The window in the organ loft is dated 1935 and the windows above the pieta statue (the Window of the Hidden Saints) and under the organ loft are by Linda Walton, dated 1997 and 2000 respectively. There are also two 1950s Hardma&#x27;s studios windows of St Nicholas and St George near the Langsdale Street entrance. The stained glass in the Sodality Chapel was designed by Edmund Kirby and made by Burlison and Grylls. There is a ring of eight bells cast in 1920 by John Taylor &amp; Co. which were re-hung in 2002–03. The four-manual organ was built in 1849 by Gray &amp; Davison and rebuilt and enlarged in 1907 by William Hill &amp; Son.
==Present day==

The church is open on most mornings of the week (but closed on Wednesdays). Services are at 10:15 on Sundays and at midday on weekdays. The bells are maintained and rung regularly by the Liverpool Universities Society of Change Ringers.

To celebrate Liverpool being the European Capital of Culture during 2008, an exhibition was held in the church entitled &quot;Held in Trust: 2008 Years of Sacred Culture&quot;. This consisted of artefacts from Stonyhurst College, embroideries and church plate from the church&#x27;s own collection, and vestments from the chapel in the Portuguese Embassy in London. Items on display included a book of homilies of Pope Gregory from 1170, Thomas More&#x27;s hat, Katherine of Aragon&#x27;s chasuble, and Cardinal Wolsey&#x27;s &quot;Book of Hours&quot;.

In 2010 the former community chapel above the sacristies was renovated to provide a presbytery for the Jesuits who serve the parish.

<text>Johannes von Tepl (c. 1350 – c. 1415), also known as Johannes von Saaz (), was a Bohemian writer of the German language, one of the earliest known writers of prose in Early New High German (or late Middle German—depending on the criteria). He was literate in Czech, German and Latin.

Not much is known about him; historians presume that he probably studied at universities in Prague, Bologna and Padua. In 1383, he became a solicitor in Žatec (Saaz) and in 1386 a rector of the town&#x27;s Latin school. He lived in Prague from 1411. He spent almost all of his life in the Kingdom of Bohemia, during the reign of kings Charles and Wenceslaus.

Johannes von Tepl is best known for his early humanist poem &quot;Der Ackermann aus Böhmen&quot; (&quot;Ploughman of Bohemia&quot;), sometimes also called &quot;Der Ackermann und der Tod&quot; (&quot;Ploughman and Death&quot;), written around 1401 and first printed in 1460. It is a dialogue of Death and the ploughman, who accuses Death because his wife Margaretha recently died. Central themes of the book are their opposing views on life, mankind, and morality. (In the history of Bohemia, the ploughman is an important symbol of Bohemian kings—Přemysl, the legendary founder of the Přemyslid dynasty, was originally a ploughman.) The poem is regarded as one of the most important German poems in the late Middle Ages.

<text>Kenneth Atchley is an American composer, noise and drone musician, video artist, and member of the San Francisco Bay Area electronic music community.

== Career ==
Atchley uses temporary water fountains as sound-sources and uses analogue electronic instruments and laptops to create his works. Other important factors in his art include sculptures, and environmental and metaphorical elements. Atchley&#x27;s music and live performances have been featured at various venues and festivals including The Kitchen, Bang on a Can, and the San Francisco Electronic Music Festival.

In September 1982, Atchley took part in a joint concert called the &quot;Rota-League Concert&quot; when the League of Automated Music Composers joined forces with an electronic-music band called The Rotary Club.

Atchley worked with choreographer Roseanne Spradlin in 2003 to create &quot;Rearrangement (or a Spell for Mortals)&quot; as a duet for Walter Dundervill and Athena Malloy. According to the New York Times, the piece &quot;sounds like running water&quot; and &quot;the dancers explore issues of mortality in an appropriately enigmatic setting&quot;.

In winter 2006–2007, he composed a set of works for strings. The pieces, collectively titled &quot;7 stillnesses,&quot; exploit a range of avant-garde harmonic progressions with emphasis on passages in which a chord is held long enough that its value within the harmonic progression disappears. The title refers not to a determinable number of &quot;stillnesses&quot;; more to the mythic use of number to refer to subjective experiences of stillness and quietude. The writing extends techniques that Atchley developed in his electronic work. In this composition the combined harmonics of an ensemble of string instruments create pared down, absorbing, tonal sound-planes.

In 2009, Atchley performed concert versions of &quot;turtle&quot;. The primary sound of this work is generated by six sine wave tones in the frequency range from 261.63 Hz and 440.00 Hz. Attending video landscapes are generated by defining and displaying sets of points within a single, germinal image.

Atchley has released several CDs of solo, electro-acoustic-noise works including &quot;fountains&quot; (published by Auscultare Research). He has also worked closely with other artists to create joint projects such as &quot;Sealed Cantus&quot; with John Bischoff (released on Bischoff&#x27;s 23Five CD Aperture). He has also written an opera called &quot;Edison&#x27;s Last Project(ION)&quot; and choral works including &quot;Lumiere de Main&quot;. The libretto and lyrics of these were published in the book &quot;Guests go in to Supper&quot;.

<doc id="1151112" wikidata="Q1077977" url="?curid=1151112" title="Christ Church Cathedral, Christchurch">
<text>Christ Church Cathedral, also called ChristChurch Cathedral and (rarely) Cathedral Church of Christ, is a deconsecrated Anglican cathedral in the central city of Christchurch, New Zealand. It was built between 1864 and 1904 in the centre of the city, surrounded by Cathedral Square. It became the cathedral seat of the Bishop of Christchurch, who is in the New Zealand &quot;tikanga&quot; of the Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia.

Earthquakes have repeatedly damaged the building (mostly the spire): in 1881, 1888, 1901, 1922, and 2010. The February 2011 Christchurch earthquake destroyed the spire and the upper portion of the tower, and severely damaged the rest of the building. A lower portion of the tower was demolished immediately following the 2011 earthquake to facilitate search and rescue operations. The remainder of the tower was demolished in March 2012. The badly damaged west wall, which contained the rose window, partially collapsed in the June 2011 earthquake and suffered further damage in the December 2011 earthquakes. The Anglican Church decided to demolish the building and replace it with a new structure, but various groups opposed the church&#x27;s intentions, with actions including taking a case to court. While the judgements were mostly in favour of the church, no further demolition occurred after the removal of the tower in early 2012. Government expressed its concern over the stalemate and appointed an independent negotiator and in September 2017, the Christchurch Diocesan Synod announced that ChristChurch Cathedral will be reinstated after promises of extra grants and loans from local and central government. By mid-2019 early design and stabilisation work had begun.

Since 15 August 2013 the cathedral community has worshipped at the Cardboard Cathedral.

==History==
===Construction===

Construction of the cathedral took 40 years, with construction paused at times due to a lack of funding.

The origins of the cathedral date back to the plans of the Canterbury Association, which aimed to build a city around a central cathedral and college in the Canterbury region, based on the English model of Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford. In the original survey of central Christchurch (known as the Black Map), undertaken in 1850, it was envisaged for the college and cathedral to be built in Cathedral Square. The area set aside for the college was found to be insufficient, and Henry Sewell suggested in June 1853 to move it to land reserved for the Christchurch Botanic Gardens. This transaction was formalised through &quot;The Cathedral Square Ordinance 1858&quot; passed by the Canterbury Provincial Council in October 1858. The ordinance allowed for Colombo Street to go through the middle of Cathedral Square at a legal width of with the cathedral to the west.

Henry Harper, the first Bishop of Christchurch, arrived in 1856 and began to drive the cathedral project. Most Christian churches are oriented towards the east, and to comply with this convention, Harper lobbied to have the eastern side of Cathedral Square to be used. That way, the main entrance would face Colombo Street, resulting in praying towards the east in line with custom. &quot;The Cathedral Square Amendment Ordinance 1859&quot;, formalised this change.

In 1858 the project was approved by the diocese and a preliminary design was commissioned from George Gilbert Scott, a prolific British architect known for his Gothic Revival churches and public buildings. Scott never visited Christchurch, but handed over the oversight of the project to Robert Speechly. Scott had earlier designed a timber church, the plans for which arrived with the Reverend Thomas Jackson in 1851, but were never used.
Just before work on the foundations began, the alignment of Colombo Street through Cathedral Square was changed by introducing a curve towards the west, with the western side of the legal road having a radius of 3 chains 75 links (), to place the cathedral slightly further west, making its tower visible along Colombo Street from a distance.

Scott&#x27;s original design was for a Gothic-style cathedral, primarily constructed in oak timber to make it resistant to earthquakes. Bishop Harper and the Cathedral Commission, however, argued that the cathedral should be built from stone. Scott&#x27;s revised plans received in 1862, showed an internal timber frame with a stone exterior. Superintendent James FitzGerald suggested an iron or steel frame to reduce cost, but Harper rejected this as he believed some bishops refused to consecrate iron-framed churches. Continuing pressure for an all-stone church, and concerns over the lack of timber in Canterbury, led to Scott supplying alternative plans for a stone arcade and clerestory. These plans arrived in New Zealand in 1864.

The cornerstone was laid on 16 December 1864, and by April 1865 the foundations had largely been completed, but work stopped soon after due to a lack of funds. The square was essentially abandoned for the next 8 years, becoming overgrown with grass. Speechly&#x27;s contract expired in 1868, and he left for Melbourne. Commentators of the time voiced their disappointment at the lack of progress. The novelist Anthony Trollope visited in 1872 and referred to the &quot;vain foundations&quot; as a &quot;huge record of failure&quot;, describing the square as a &quot;large waste space&quot; with &quot;not a single brick or single stone above the level of the ground&quot;.

In 1873 a new resident architect, New Zealander Benjamin Mountfort, took over and construction began again. Mountfort had been passed over to manage the project when it was first mooted 10 years previously. The reasons at the time had been that the bishop wanted an English architect, with Harper describing Mountfort&#x27;s other buildings as lacking &quot;taste and strength of composition&quot;. During the intervening decade, however, Mountfort had proven himself quite capable with projects including the Canterbury Provincial Council Buildings and Canterbury Museum. Mountfort adapted Scott&#x27;s design, including: adding balconies and pinnacles to the tower; adding porches to the north and west; increasing the height of the south porch; extending the run of interior columns; and decorative details such as the font, pulpit and stained glass. He also rearranged the pattern of the roof slates. Banks Peninsula totara and matai timber were used for the roof supports. By the end of 1875 the walls were high, and the first service was held within them.

The nave, long, and tower were consecrated on 1 November 1881. In 1894, Elizabeth, the widow of Alfred Richard Creyke, arranged for the western porch to be built in his memory. When Mountfort died in 1898, his son, Cyril Mountfort (1852–1920), took over as supervising architect. He oversaw the completion of the chancel, transept and apse, construction of which began in 1900 and was finished by 1904. The Christchurch Beautifying Society planted two plane trees to the south in 1898.

The Rhodes family, who arrived in Canterbury before the First Four Ships, provided funds for the tower and spire. Robert Heaton Rhodes sponsored the tower in memory of his brother George and the spire was added by George&#x27;s children. The steps of the wooden lectern were sponsored by George&#x27;s children. The family donated eight bells and a memorial window, and paid for renovations as required. 

The spire reached to above Cathedral Square, and public access provided for a good viewpoint over the centre of the city. The spire was damaged by earthquakes on four occasions. The tower originally contained a peal of ten bells, cast by John Taylor &amp; Co of Loughborough, and hung in 1881. The original bells were replaced in 1978 by 13 new bells, also cast at Taylors.

In 1999 the cathedral underwent significant earthquake strengthening, which reinforced the roof and the walls. This was credited with keeping the building fabirc intact during the major earthquakes of the 2010s, and saving the lives of people within the building during aftershocks.

===Heritage listing===

On 7 April 1983, the church was registered by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust as a Category I historic place, registration number 46. It is the only church designed by Scott in New Zealand. Its design was significantly influenced by Mountfort. It is a major landmark and tourist attraction, and for many it symbolises the ideals of the early settlers. There are numerous memorial tablets and memorial windows, acting as a reminder of the early people and the region&#x27;s history. For example, a list of the 84 members of the Canterbury Association was first compiled for volume one of &quot;A History of Canterbury&quot;. Even before the history was published in 1957, a memorial tablet of the members was installed in the western porch in 1955.

===Visitor centre===

During the 1990s, largely under the guidance of dean John Bluck, the cathedral underwent redevelopment and renovation. The operation and maintenance of the cathedral was costing close to a year, and it was decided that money from visiting tourists could be captured to meet the shortfall. The decision to add a visitor centre was controversial; some objected to the idea of operating a trade business in a church on religious grounds. The design of the new building was also a point of contention, with the Historic Places Trust threatening to block any alteration of the cathedral.

The final design was a two-storey building on the north side of the cathedral, partially buried underground to minimise the impact on the profile of the cathedral. The profile of the building was designed to complement that of the neo-Gothic cathedral. The centre was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth on 4 November 1994.

==Interior==

The high altar&#x27;s reredos was made from kauri planks from an old bridge over the Hurunui River and includes six carved figures: Samuel Marsden, Archdeacon Henry Williams, Tāmihana Te Rauparaha, Bishop George Selwyn, Bishop Henry Harper and Bishop John Patteson.

The pulpit, designed by Mountfort, commemorates George Selwyn, the first and only Bishop of New Zealand. Mountfort also designed the font, which was donated by Arthur Penrhyn Stanley, Dean of Westminster in memory of his brother, Captain Owen Stanley of HMS &quot;Britomart&quot;, who arrived in Akaroa in 1840.

The cathedral contains the throne and memorial to Bishop Harper, the first Bishop of Christchurch and the second Primate of New Zealand, who laid the foundation stone in 1864 and preached at the consecration service in 1881. In the west porch are stones from Canterbury Cathedral, Christchurch Priory, Tintern Abbey, Glastonbury Abbey, Herod&#x27;s Temple, St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral and Christ Church, Oxford.

The north wall includes a mural dado of inlaid marble and encaustic tiles, donated by the Cathedral Guild in 1885, which includes fylfot motifs. A memorial window above the mural was donated in memory of Sir Thomas Tancred, Bt (1808–1880).

On the south side of the nave there is a Watts-Russell Memorial Window in memory of her first husband.

The Chapel of St Michael and St George was opened by Lieutenant-General Sir Bernard Freyberg, VC, the Governor-General, on Remembrance Day (6 November 1949) and dedicated to Archbishop Campbell West-Watson.

===Rose window===

The rose window was designed by Mountfort, and was presented by Leonard Harper and his wife Joanna. The window featured 31 sections and 4000 pieces of stained-glass, made in London in 1881 by glass artisans Clayton and Bell. The window was installed at the western end of the nave, above the main door. The window had a diameter of . The artwork depicts the hierarchy of angels orbiting around the Lamb of God.

During an earthquake in June 2011, the rose window collapsed onto a roof below, and was destroyed. The fragments were carefully recovered, and in 2022 they were sent to a local stained-glass artisan, Graham Stewart, for restoration. Less than 10% of the original window could be salvaged, leaving Stewart to recreate much of the lost artwork. In June 2024, the restoration was completed.

==Earthquake damage==
The Canterbury region has experienced many earthquakes and, like many buildings in Christchurch, the cathedral has suffered earthquake damage.

===Early earthquakes===
;1881: A stone was dislodged from the finial cap of the spire, immediately below the terminal cross, within a month of the cathedral&#x27;s consecration.

;1888:Approximately 8 metres of stonework fell from the top of the spire as a result of 1 September 1888 North Canterbury earthquake. The stone spire was replaced. The repair was completed in August 1891, with Bishop Julius hoisted to the top of the spire to place the last stone.

;1901:The top of the spire fell again as a result of 16 November 1901 Cheviot earthquake. In 1902 it was replaced with a more resilient structure of Australian hardwood sheathed with weathered copper sheeting, with an internal mass damper. The repairs were funded by the Rhodes family.

;1922:One of the stone crosses fell during 25 December 1922 Motunau earthquake.

===Modern earthquakes===
;2010:4 September 2010 Canterbury earthquake caused some superficial damage and the cathedral was closed for engineering inspections until 22 September 2010, when it was deemed safe to reopen. Further damage was sustained in the Boxing Day aftershock on 26 December.

;2011 February
:The 6.3-magnitude earthquake on 22 February 2011 left the cathedral damaged and several surrounding buildings in ruins. The spire was completely destroyed, leaving only the lower half of the tower standing. While the walls and roof remained mostly intact, the gable of the west front sustained damage and the roof over the western section of the north aisle, nearest the tower, collapsed from falling tower debris. Inspection showed that the pillars supporting the building were severely damaged; further investigation of damage to the foundations was anticipated, to determine whether the cathedral could be rebuilt on the site.

:Preliminary reports suggested that as many as 20 people had been in the tower at the time of its collapse, but a thorough examination by Urban Search and Rescue teams found no bodies.

;2011 June
:The cathedral suffered further damage on 13 June 2011 from the 6.4-magnitude June 2011 Christchurch earthquake with the rose window in the west wall falling in and raised the question of &quot;... whether the cathedral needed to be deconsecrated and demolished&quot;.

;2011 December
:The cathedral suffered further damage from the swarm of earthquakes on 23 December, the largest measuring 6.0 on the Richter magnitude scale, during which what remained of the rose window collapsed.

==Proposed demolition==

The major aftershocks of 23 June 2011 caused such significant damage to the cathedral that demolition began to look certain. In October 2011 Bishop Victoria Matthews announced that the structure would be deconsecrated and at least partially demolished. The cathedral was deconsecrated on 9 November 2011 at a restricted ceremony in front of the ruined building.

The relationship between bishop Matthews and dean Peter Beck became strained through this period, and Beck resigned as dean in December 2011. He subsequently ran for the Christchurch City Council, winning the seat for Burwood-Pegasus ward. Beck was replaced by Lynda Patterson.

On 2 March 2012, Matthews announced that the building would be demolished. She questioned the safety of the building and stated that rebuilding could cost more than insurance would cover and that a new cathedral would be built in its place. The decision was supported by 70 local Christchurch churches and Christian groups. In late March 2012, demolition began and the scope involved removing the windows and demolishing the tower. By 23 April 2012, the stained glass of nine windows had been removed and work had begun to pull down masonry from the tower to give safe access to further stained glass windows.

In September 2012, Bishop Matthews suggested sharing a new church with the Roman Catholic community, as their place of worship was also damaged in the quakes. The Roman Catholic diocese was not receptive to the idea.

===Opposition===
Strong opposition to the proposed demolition quickly formed, with heritage groups including the UNESCO World Heritage Centre opposing the action. Those opposed to the demolition included mayor Bob Parker, former mayor Garry Moore, future mayor Lianne Dalziel, Ruth Dyson, Philip Burdon, Jim Anderton, David Carter, broadcaster Mike Yardley, actor David McPhail, and businessmen including Humphry Rolleston and Mike Pero. A local character, the Wizard of New Zealand, made protests calling for the cathedral to be saved. Two opposition groups were set up: Mark Belton organised the Restore Christchurch Cathedral group, and the Great Christchurch Buildings Trust was led by Anderton and Burdon. Burdon pledged to the restoration, and British businessman Hamish Ogston pledged .

Kit Miyamoto, an American-based structural engineer and expert in earthquake rebuilding, inspected the cathedral after the September 2010 quake. He cited his experience in stating that restoring and strengthening of the building was both &quot;feasible and affordable&quot;.

In April 2012, a group of engineers from the New Zealand Society for Earthquake Engineering launched a petition seeking the support of 100 colleagues to stop the demolition. They claimed that legal action was also a possibility. In the same month the Restore Christchurch Cathedral Group sought signatures for a petition to save the cathedral.

Many locals perceived that the church and government were pressing ahead with demolition, without consultation and against the will of the public. Earthquake recovery minister Gerry Brownlee claimed that nearby property owners wanted the cathedral demolished, but when contacted, they in fact unanimously supported restoration. Support for restoration was not as unanimous in the wider city, however; a Colmar-Brunton poll, organised in 2014 by restoration advocates, showed that 51% of the population wanted the cathedral restored, and only 43% wanted it demolished. Matthew maintained that the future of the cathedral was not a question for all of Christchurch; rather, it was an issue for the church and the people in her diocese. She compared efforts from public interest groups getting involved in the process to &quot;other people designing a person&#x27;s damaged home&quot;.

===Legal challenges===
On 15 November 2012 the High Court issued an interim judgement granting an application for judicial review made by the Great Christchurch Buildings Trust, challenging the lawfulness of the decision to demolish. This effectively paused demolition, though it did not rule that the demolition was illegal.

In early December 2013, the Supreme Court rejected a further bid to preserve the cathedral. The issue again went to court in May 2014. The court ruled that while there were inconsistencies in the decision-making for the demolition, there was nothing that justified blocking the demolition, and the stay of demolition was lifted. This effectively ended the legal attempts to block the demolition.

In July 2015, Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee wrote to church leaders stating concerns that the lack of progress was holding up the earthquake recovery of the central city. In September, Bishop Matthews announced that the church had agreed to a proposal to an independent government-appointed negotiator between Church Property Trustees and the Great Christchurch Building Trust. No official announcement was made with regards to the appointment due to confidentiality agreements, but it was later revealed that Miriam Dean QC ad been appointed at the independent facilitator. Dean met engineers from all of the interested groups in order to draw a conclusion on the feasibility of restoring the cathedral. Her report concluded that the estimated cost of reinstatement was around , and that a proposed contemporary Warren and Mahoney replacement design was likely to cost . On 23 December, Bishop Matthews and Gerry Brownlee announced that the church had agreed to Dean&#x27;s report that stated that &quot;the building could be reinstated [...] to be &#x27;indistinguishable&#x27; from the pre-earthquake building&quot;, signalling the end of the impasse. A Cathedral Working Group was set up to consult with all parties about their preferred plan, and in November 2016 they reported their findings. They recommended broad reinstatement of the original building, with some alterations to add new church offices, choir practice rooms, visitor&#x27;s centre, museum and cafe. On 9 September 2017, the Anglican synod voted with a 55% majority to reinstate the cathedral, ending a long and acrimonious dispute about the future of the building. Bishop Matthews resigned in March 2018, shortly after reinstatement work began.

== Reinstatement work and abandonment==

On 22 August 2018, an agreement was signed that established a company, Christ Church Cathedral Reinstatement Limited, to reinstate the cathedral. Physical works include a combination of repair, restoration and seismic strengthening. The strengthening includes the removal of internal walls so that the rubble fill can be removed and replaced with structural steel or concrete. Base isolation will also be retrofitted. Holmes Consulting has been appointed for structural engineering design, with Warren and Mahoney providing architectural services.
In 2017, the cost of reconstruction was originally estimated at , but by October 2020, when the plans for the reconstruction were released, it had increased nearly 50 percent to .
The new plans include a museum and visitor centre, with a cafe, to the north, and an office building with parish hall to the south.
The plans required the Citizens&#x27; War Memorial to be removed to the site of the old police kiosk; for this to happen the kiosk was demolished. The memorial minus the bronze figures was completed by end of November 2022.

===Mothballing===
In 2024 the reconstruction cost was revalued to after a project review. After access was gained to go inside the cathedral the year prior, it was discovered that assumptions about the foundations were wrong. After the review the board decided to &quot;reduce the scope, cost and risk of the project by removing the deep foundation for the tower and the lower courtyard, thus mitigating [the original project&#x27;s risk]&quot;. To reduce the funding gap of over $100 million, in June 2024 the synod decided that it would reduce the cathedral&#x27;s seismic strengthening. This reduced the total estimate down to , which still represented an shortfall. In August the government decided that it would not continue to fund the rebuild, and it was decided that restoration would be paused indefinitely. The indefinite pause in restoration was referred to as &quot;&quot;, and involved making the worksite safe, adding a temporary 4-tonne weathertight roof, removing all scaffolding and construction equipment, and pushing the perimeter fence back closer to the building. The site closure work was completed in December 2024, and small visitor tour groups were allowed inside throughout the month. Restoration project leader Mark Stewart stated that the term &quot;mothballing&quot; implied the project had been abandoned, but he disputed that it had been abandoned.

==Transitional cathedral==

Construction of a transitional cathedral started on 24 July 2012. The site, on the corner of Hereford and Madras Streets, several blocks from the permanent location, was blessed in April 2012. Designed by architect Shigeru Ban and seating around 700 people, it was expected to be completed by Christmas 2012, but the completion date was put back to July and then August 2013 with the dedication service held on 15 August. The materials used in its construction include cardboard tubes, timber and steel.

In November 2012 the diocese began fund raising to pay for the NZ$5 million project, following a High Court judge indicating it may not be legal to build a temporary cathedral using its insurance payout.

==Deans==

In late 2011, Dean Peter Beck resigned from his position. Disagreement with Bishop Matthews about the fate of the cathedral was cited as his reason for leaving. Beck was succeeded by Lynda Patterson, who served for the first 20 months in an acting position, officially becoming dean on 1 November 2013, the first woman to serve in that role. Because ChristChurch Cathedral was inaccessible, Patterson originally worked at St Michael and All Angels and then at the Cardboard Cathedral. Patterson died of natural causes on 20 July 2014.

<text>Paul Falknor Iams (; August 11, 1915 – October 26, 2004) was the founder of the Iams Company which is known for its line of pet foods.

==Life==
Iams was born in Dayton, Ohio, on August 11, 1915. He was a talented high school athlete who won the Ohio State Tennis Championship in 1933. In 1937, he graduated from Ohio State University and became interested in the pet food business while working with his father, Harry, a grain broker. He joined Procter &amp; Gamble in 1938 and was a soap salesman before joining the Navy in World War II.

Iams graduated from the Ohio State University in 1937, and sold dog food during the Great Depression. He learned that not even severe economic hardship would stop owners from buying food to feed their pets. This was a revelation to Iams, as most owners fed their pets leftovers or their own concoctions. A self-taught animal nutritionist, Iams founded his company in 1946, and, by 1950, was creating his own recipes in his own plant in Dayton.

When he retired in 1982, Iams sold his stake in the company to his business partner, who sold the company to Procter &amp; Gamble in 1999.
After completing his service, Iams decided to create high quality pet food, based on his original nutritional theories and research. He was convinced that there was a strong specialty market for a nutritionally complete dog food. His original customer base was composed of Midwestern veterinarians and dog breeders.

In 1950, he opened his first manufacturing plant in Dayton, Ohio with five employees. He named his first dog food, &quot;Iams 999&quot; to imply that it was nearly perfect.

In 1982, Iams sold the business to Clay Mathile, who had joined Iams in 1970 and was Paul&#x27;s business partner and friend. In 1999, the Mathiles sold The Iams Company to Procter and Gamble.

In 1987, the Paul F. Iams Technical Center in Lewisburg, Ohio, was opened as a research facility dedicated to researching the emotional and physical needs of companion animals.

Paul Iams died at the age of 89, on Tuesday, October 26, 2004, in Chappaqua, New York. Until a month earlier, he had lived in Sun City West, Arizona, where he retired in 1982 with his wife, the former Jane Landrum, who died in 1996.

<text>Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), also known as dimethylpolysiloxane or dimethicone, is a silicone polymer with a wide variety of uses, from cosmetics to industrial lubrication and passive daytime radiative cooling.

PDMS is particularly known for its unusual rheological (or flow) properties. It is optically clear and, in general, inert, non-toxic, and non-flammable. It is one of several types of silicone oil (polymerized siloxane). The applications of PDMS range from contact lenses and medical devices to elastomers; it is also present in shampoos (as it makes hair shiny and slippery), food (antifoaming agent), caulk, lubricants and heat-resistant tiles.

==Structure==
The chemical formula of PDMS is , where &quot;n&quot; is the number of repeating monomer units. Industrial synthesis can begin from dimethyldichlorosilane and water by the following net reaction:

: + (&quot;n&quot;+1) 

The polymerization reaction evolves hydrochloric acid. For medical and domestic applications, a process was developed in which the chlorine atoms in the silane precursor were replaced with acetate groups. In this case, the polymerization produces acetic acid, which is less chemically aggressive than HCl. As a side-effect, the curing process is also much slower in this case. The acetate is used in consumer applications, such as silicone caulk and adhesives.

===Branching and capping===
Hydrolysis of generates a polymer that is terminated with silanol groups (). These reactive centers are typically &quot;capped&quot; by reaction with trimethylsilyl chloride:

Silane precursors with more acid-forming groups and fewer methyl groups, such as methyltrichlorosilane, can be used to introduce branches or cross-links in the polymer chain. Under ideal conditions, each molecule of such a compound becomes a branch point. This can be used to produce hard silicone resins. In a similar manner, precursors with three methyl groups can be used to limit molecular weight, since each such molecule has only one reactive site and so forms the end of a siloxane chain.

Well-defined PDMS with a low polydispersity index and high homogeneity is produced by controlled anionic ring-opening polymerization of hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane. Using this methodology it is possible to synthesize linear block copolymers, heteroarm star-shaped block copolymers and many other macromolecular architectures.

The polymer is manufactured in multiple viscosities, from a thin pourable liquid (when &quot;n&quot; is very low), to a thick rubbery semi-solid (when &quot;n&quot; is very high). PDMS molecules have quite flexible polymer backbones (or chains) due to their siloxane linkages, which are analogous to the ether linkages used to impart rubberiness to polyurethanes. Such flexible chains become loosely entangled when molecular weight is high, which results in PDMS&#x27; unusually high level of viscoelasticity.

==Mechanical properties==
PDMS is viscoelastic, meaning that at long flow times (or high temperatures), it acts like a viscous liquid, similar to honey. However, at short flow times (or low temperatures), it acts like an elastic solid, similar to rubber. Viscoelasticity is a form of nonlinear elasticity that is common amongst noncrystalline polymers. The loading and unloading of a stress-strain curve for PDMS do not coincide; rather, the amount of stress will vary based on the degree of strain, and the general rule is that increasing strain will result in greater stiffness. When the load itself is removed, the strain is slowly recovered (rather than instantaneously). This time-dependent elastic deformation results from the long-chains of the polymer. But the process that is described above is only relevant when cross-linking is present; when it is not, the polymer PDMS cannot shift back to the original state even when the load is removed, resulting in a permanent deformation. However, permanent deformation is rarely seen in PDMS, since it is almost always cured with a cross-linking agent.

If some PDMS is left on a surface overnight (long flow time), it will flow to cover the surface and mold to any surface imperfections. However, if the same PDMS is poured into a spherical mold and allowed to cure (short flow time), it will bounce like a rubber ball. The mechanical properties of PDMS enable this polymer to conform to a diverse variety of surfaces. Since these properties are affected by a variety of factors, this unique polymer is relatively easy to tune. This enables PDMS to become a good substrate that can easily be integrated into a variety of microfluidic and microelectromechanical systems. Specifically, the determination of mechanical properties can be decided before PDMS is cured; the uncured version allows the user to capitalize on myriad opportunities for achieving a desirable elastomer. Generally, the cross-linked cured version of PDMS resembles rubber in a solidified form. It is widely known to be easily stretched, bent, compressed in all directions. Depending on the application and field, the user is able to tune the properties based on what is demanded. 

Overall PDMS has a low elastic modulus which enables it to be easily deformed and results in the behavior of a rubber. Viscoelastic properties of PDMS can be more precisely measured using dynamic mechanical analysis. This method requires determination of the material&#x27;s flow characteristics over a wide range of temperatures, flow rates, and deformations. Because of PDMS&#x27;s chemical stability, it is often used as a calibration fluid for this type of experiment.

The shear modulus of PDMS varies with preparation conditions, and consequently dramatically varies in the range of 100 kPa to 3 MPa. The loss tangent is very low .

==Chemical compatibility==
PDMS is hydrophobic. Plasma oxidation can be used to alter the surface chemistry, adding silanol (SiOH) groups to the surface. Atmospheric air plasma and argon plasma will work for this application. This treatment renders the PDMS surface hydrophilic, allowing water to wet it. The oxidized surface can be further functionalized by reaction with trichlorosilanes. After a certain amount of time, recovery of the surface&#x27;s hydrophobicity is inevitable, regardless of whether the surrounding medium is vacuum, air, or water; the oxidized surface is stable in air for about 30 minutes. Alternatively, for applications where long-term hydrophilicity is a requirement, techniques such as hydrophilic polymer grafting, surface nanostructuring, and dynamic surface modification with embedded surfactants can be of use.

Solid PDMS samples (whether surface-oxidized or not) will not allow aqueous solvents to infiltrate and swell the material. Thus PDMS structures can be used in combination with water and alcohol solvents without material deformation. However most organic solvents will diffuse into the material and cause it to swell. Despite this, some organic solvents lead to sufficiently small swelling that they can be used with PDMS, for instance within the channels of PDMS microfluidic devices. The swelling ratio is roughly inversely related to the solubility parameter of the solvent. Diisopropylamine swells PDMS to the greatest extent; solvents such as chloroform, ether, and THF swell the material to a large extent. Solvents such as acetone, 1-propanol, and pyridine swell the material to a small extent. Alcohols and polar solvents such as methanol, glycerol and water do not swell the material appreciably.

==Applications==
===Surfactants and antifoaming agents===
PDMS derivatives are common surfactants and are a component of defoamers. PDMS, in a modified form, is used as an herbicide penetrant and is a critical ingredient in water-repelling coatings, such as .

===Hydraulic fluids and related applications===
Dimethicone is used in the active silicone fluid in automotive viscous limited slip differentials and couplings.

=== Daytime radiative cooling ===
PDMS is a common surface material used in passive daytime radiative cooling as a broadband emitter that is high in solar reflectivity and heat emissivity. Many tested surfaces use PDMS because of its potential scalability as a low-cost polymer. As a daytime radiative cooling surface, PDMS has also been tested to improve solar cell efficiency.

===Soft lithography===

PDMS is commonly used as a stamp resin in the procedure of soft lithography, making it one of the most common materials used for flow delivery in microfluidics chips. The process of soft lithography consists of creating an elastic stamp, which enables the transfer of patterns of only a few nanometers in size onto glass, silicon or polymer surfaces. With this type of technique, it is possible to produce devices that can be used in the areas of optic telecommunications or biomedical research. The stamp is produced from the normal techniques of photolithography or electron-beam lithography. The resolution depends on the mask used and can reach 6 nm.

The popularity of PDMS in microfluidics area is due to its excellent mechanical properties. Moreover, compared to other materials, it possesses superior optical properties, allowing for minimal background and autofluorescence during fluorescent imaging.

In biomedical (or biological) microelectromechanical systems (bio-MEMS), soft lithography is used extensively for microfluidics in both organic and inorganic contexts. Silicon wafers are used to design channels, and PDMS is then poured over these wafers and left to harden. When removed, even the smallest of details is left imprinted in the PDMS. With this particular PDMS block, hydrophilic surface modification is conducted using plasma etching techniques. Plasma treatment disrupts surface silicon-oxygen bonds, and a plasma-treated glass slide is usually placed on the activated side of the PDMS (the plasma-treated, now hydrophilic side with imprints). Once activation wears off and bonds begin to reform, silicon-oxygen bonds are formed between the surface atoms of the glass and the surface atoms of the PDMS, and the slide becomes permanently sealed to the PDMS, thus creating a waterproof channel. With these devices, researchers can utilize various surface chemistry techniques for different functions creating unique lab-on-a-chip devices for rapid parallel testing.
PDMS can be cross-linked into networks and is a commonly used system for studying the elasticity of polymer networks. PDMS can be directly patterned by surface-charge lithography.

PDMS is being used in the making of synthetic gecko adhesion dry adhesive materials, to date only in laboratory test quantities.

Some flexible electronics researchers use PDMS because of its low cost, easy fabrication, flexibility, and optical transparency. Yet, for fluorescence imaging at different wavelengths, PDMS shows least autofluorescence and is comparable to BoroFloat glass.

===Stereo lithography===

In stereo lithography (SLA) 3D printing, light is projected onto photocuring resin to selectively cure it. Some types of SLA printer are cured from the bottom of the tank of resin and therefore require the growing model to be peeled away from the base in order for each printed layer to be supplied with a fresh film of uncured resin. A PDMS layer at the bottom of the tank assists this process by absorbing oxygen : the presence of oxygen adjacent to the resin prevents it adhering to the PDMS, and the optically clear PDMS permits the projected image to pass through to the resin undistorted.

===Medicine and cosmetics===
Activated dimethicone, a mixture of polydimethylsiloxanes and silicon dioxide (sometimes called simethicone), is often used in over-the-counter drugs as an antifoaming agent and carminative. PDMS also works as a moisturizer that is lighter and more breathable than typical oils.

Silicone breast implants are made out of a PDMS elastomer shell, to which fumed amorphous silica is added, encasing PDMS gel or saline solution. 

====Skin====
PDMS is used variously in the cosmetic and consumer product industry as well. For example, dimethicone is used widely in skin-moisturizing lotions where it is listed as an active ingredient whose purpose is &quot;skin protection.&quot; Some cosmetic formulations use dimethicone and related siloxane polymers in concentrations of use up to 15%. The Cosmetic Ingredient Review&#x27;s (CIR) Expert Panel, has concluded that dimethicone and related polymers are &quot;safe as used in cosmetic formulations.&quot;

====Hair====
PDMS compounds such as amodimethicone, are effective conditioners when formulated to consist of small particles and be soluble in water or alcohol/act as surfactants (especially for damaged hair), and are even more conditioning to the hair than common dimethicone and/or dimethicone copolyols.

====Contact lenses====
A proposed use of PDMS is contact lens cleaning. Its physical properties of low elastic modulus and hydrophobicity have been used to clean micro and nano pollutants from contact lens surfaces more effectively than multipurpose solution and finger rubbing; the researchers involved call the technique PoPPR (polymer on polymer pollution removal) and note that it is highly effective at removing nanoplastic that has adhered to lenses. The use of PDMS in the manufacture of contact lenses was patented (later abandoned).

====As anti-parasitic====
PDMS is effective for treating lice in humans. This is thought to be due not to suffocation (or poisoning), but to its blocking water excretion, which causes insects to die from physiological stress either through prolonged immobilisation or disruption of internal organs such as the gut.

Dimethicone is the active ingredient in an anti-flea preparation sprayed on a cat, found to be equally effective to a widely used more toxic pyriproxifen/permethrin spray. The parasite becomes trapped and immobilised in the substance, inhibiting adult flea emergence for over three weeks.

===Foods===
PDMS is added to many cooking oils (as an anti-foaming agent) to prevent oil splatter during the cooking process. As a result of this, PDMS can be found in trace quantities in many fast food items such as McDonald&#x27;s Chicken McNuggets, french fries, hash browns, milkshakes and smoothies and Wendy&#x27;s french fries.

Under European food additive regulations, it is listed as E900.

=== Condom lubricant ===
PDMS is widely used as a condom lubricant.

=== Domestic and niche uses ===
Many people are indirectly familiar with PDMS because it is an important component in Silly Putty, to which PDMS imparts its characteristic viscoelastic properties. Another toy PDMS is used in is Kinetic Sand. The rubbery, vinegary-smelling silicone caulks, adhesives, and aquarium sealants are also well-known. PDMS is also used as a component in silicone grease and other silicone based lubricants, as well as in defoaming agents, mold release agents, damping fluids, heat transfer fluids, polishes, cosmetics, hair conditioners and other applications.

It can be used as a sorbent for the analysis of headspace (dissolved gas analysis) of food.

==Safety and environmental considerations==
According to &quot;Ullmann&#x27;s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry&quot;, no &quot;marked harmful effects on organisms in the environment&quot; have been noted for siloxanes. PDMS is nonbiodegradable, but is absorbed in waste water treatment facilities. Its degradation is catalyzed by various clays.

<doc id="1151130" wikidata="Q919492" url="?curid=1151130" title="Jake Roberts">
<text>Aurelian Smith Jr. (born May 30, 1955) better known by the ring name Jake &quot;the Snake&quot; Roberts, is an American retired professional wrestler and actor. He is signed to All Elite Wrestling (AEW), where he performs as the on-screen manager to &quot;La Facción Ingobernable&quot;, and he also serves as a special advisor for AEW&#x27;s community outreach program, &quot;AEW Together&quot;. He is also signed to WWE under a legends contract. He is best known for his two stints in the World Wrestling Federation (later called WWE); the first between 1978,1986 and 1992, and the second between 1996 and 1997. He wrestled in the National Wrestling Alliance in 1983, World Championship Wrestling in 1992, and the Mexico-based Asistencia Asesoría y Administración between 1993 and 1994 and again in 1997. He appeared in Extreme Championship Wrestling during the summer of 1997 and made appearances for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling from 2006 through 2008.

Throughout his career, Roberts, often considered one of professional wrestling&#x27;s most iconic figures, was known for his intense and cerebral promos, dark charisma, extensive use of psychology in his matches, and innovative use of the DDT finishing move (which was later named the &quot;coolest&quot; maneuver of all time by WWE). He often brought snakes into the ring, most famously a python. He was one of the subjects of the 1999 documentary film &quot;Beyond the Mat&quot;. In 2012, he moved in with fellow wrestler Diamond Dallas Page to seek help in getting his life back on track following years of alcohol and drug addiction, a period covered in the 2015 documentary &quot;The Resurrection of Jake the Snake&quot;. He was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame on April 5, 2014, and the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum in 2020.

==Early life==
Aurelian Smith Jr. was born in Gainesville, Texas. His father, Aurelian &quot;Grizzly&quot; Smith (1932–2010), also a wrestler, left his mother when she was 17 by which time she had given birth to another child. Roberts lived with his grandmother until she died in 1966, forcing him to move back to live with his father and his new wife. Roberts had a strained relationship with his pedophilic father, and was sexually and physically abused by his stepmother during his childhood, which included vaginal penetration - his father was doing the same thing to his daughters (Aurelian Jr.&#x27;s sisters) too. He has a half-brother, Michael Smith, and a half-sister, Robin Smith, both of whom also became wrestlers. During the late 1980s, all three wrestled at the same time for the WWF (now WWE).

==Professional wrestling career==
===Early career (1974–1986)===

Roberts started his career in 1974 in the Louisiana area, as a referee and a year later, made his debut as a wrestler, making his name in Mid-South Wrestling, Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling and Georgia Championship Wrestling. Roberts had trouble developing his character, so in the late 1970s he traveled to Canada to wrestle. While in Stampede Wrestling, Roberts feuded with the Junkyard Dog.

It was in Georgia Championship Wrestling during 1983 that Roberts became part of Paul Ellering&#x27;s stable, the Legion of Doom, and began a feud with Ron Garvin over the NWA World Television Championship that lasted into 1984. In 1984, Roberts entered World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW) joining up with &quot;Gentleman&quot; Chris Adams and Gino Hernandez in their feud against the Von Erichs, winning the WCCW Television title and 6-Man Tag Team title (with Adams and Hernandez). Roberts returned to Mid-South Wrestling for 1985, ending his run there in February 1986 with a feud with Dick Slater after being told by management that he was not considered a top talent even though he was getting the biggest crowd reactions.

===World Wrestling Federation (1986–1992)===
====Debut and championship pursuits (1986–1990)====
Roberts debuted in the World Wrestling Federation on March 8, 1986, at the Boston Garden defeating Jose Luis Rivera. A month later, he made his pay-per-view debut, defeating George Wells at WrestleMania 2. During the match, Roberts made Wells foam from the mouth when he wrapped his snake Damien around Wells&#x27; head.
Roberts&#x27; first major feud was against Ricky &quot;the Dragon&quot; Steamboat, beginning on a nationally televised episode of &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event VI&quot; in May 1986. Roberts executed the DDT on Steamboat on the exposed concrete floor right in front of his wife Bonnie and then proceeded to rest his snake Damien on top of a prone Steamboat. While Vince McMahon and booker George Scott were adamant about wanting the DDT to take place on the floor, Roberts initially refused until Steamboat told him that he would be able to adequately protect himself from injury. Unfortunately, Steamboat was unable to stop his head from hitting the concrete and was rendered unconscious, sustaining a concussion. After Steamboat&#x27;s recovery, Steamboat introduced a &quot;Komodo dragon&quot; as his pet to combat the psychological effects of Roberts&#x27; snake. The feud continued with Steamboat winning most of the matches (losing only one because he threw Roberts back in the ring before the 10 count, while not beating the count himself), most notably a Snake Pit Match (ostensibly a no-DQ match) at &quot;The Big Event&quot; in Toronto, and the rematch on the October 1986 edition of &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event VII&quot;.

Recognizing his microphone skills, Roberts was given his own talk segment called &quot;The Snake Pit&quot;, which debuted on the first episode of &quot;WWF Wrestling Challenge&quot; in late 1986. &quot;The Snake Pit&quot; was patterned after &quot;Piper&#x27;s Pit&quot;, wherein Roberts would conduct interviews with wrestlers or managers to help push wrestlers and get feuds over with the crowd. The segment was eventually moved to &quot;WWF Superstars of Wrestling&quot; (to replace &quot;Piper&#x27;s Pit&quot; after Roddy Piper&#x27;s retirement following WrestleMania III) until the final segment aired in July 1987.In late 1986, Roberts began to enjoy an upsurge in fan popularity, despite the WWF&#x27;s attempts to cast him as an unpopular villain. In November 1986, Roberts challenged Randy Savage for the Intercontinental Championship. Before the match, announcer Vince McMahon said the fans would probably support Savage against the disliked Roberts. However, to the surprise of both McMahon and fellow broadcaster Jesse &quot;The Body&quot; Ventura, the fans cheered loudly for Roberts throughout the bout. The match ended in a double disqualification. Around the same time, the WWF had also tried to set Roberts up as a nemesis to then fan-favorite WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan, and challenging him for the title. However, after Roberts hit Hogan with a DDT during an episode of &quot;The Snake Pit&quot;, fans responded positively to the attack by chanting &quot;DDT&quot; rather than for Hogan, and McMahon abandoned his plans for a feud between them. Years later in a 2015 shoot interview, Roberts jokingly thanked the fans for ruining what would have been the biggest (and most profitable) run of his career as at the time Hogan was the biggest and most popular babyface and a run against Hogan would have meant main event television and pay-per-view matches.

He officially turned face when he feuded with The Honky Tonk Man, an Elvis impersonator, who attacked Robertswith a guitar during his interview segment &quot;The Snake Pit&quot;. The Honky Tonk Man&#x27;s guitar shot actually injured Roberts&#x27; neck, as at the time guitars were not prepared to break easily. The Honky Tonk Man denies that he purposefully injured Roberts, although Honky&#x27;s manager Jimmy Hart, as well as a video of the incident (seen on the &quot;Pick Your Poison&quot; DVD) suggests otherwise with Roberts later claiming that he was picking pieces of wood out of his back for weeks after. The attack led to their match at WrestleMania III in which Roberts had Detroit native Alice Cooper (a known lover of snakes) in his corner. After Honky Tonk won the Intercontinental Championship from Ricky Steamboat, Roberts unsuccessfully challenged him for the Championship several times throughout the rest of 1987. The initial plan was for Roberts to win the Intercontinental Championship shortly after The Honky Tonk Man&#x27;s win over Steamboat and begin an angle with &quot;the Million Dollar Man&quot; Ted DiBiase, but because of the injuries from the guitar shot, the decision was made to keep the belt with The Honky Tonk Man.

He then had a feud with &quot;Ravishing&quot; Rick Rude and his manager Bobby &quot;the Brain&quot; Heenan, who began a gimmick of selecting a woman from the crowd to kiss after each match. On the April 23, 1988 edition of &quot;WWF Superstars of Wrestling&quot;, Rude chose Roberts&#x27; real-life wife Cheryl, who refused the kiss and revealed that she was in fact the wife of Jake &quot;the Snake&quot;. After Rude began insulting Roberts, Cheryl slapped him, angering Rude before Roberts ran out for the save. This began a heated feud throughout the summer of 1988, which escalated after Rude began wearing a pair of tights emblazoned with a visage of Mrs. Roberts, which an irate Roberts tore off.
Roberts moved from the feud with Rude into a feud with André the Giant who was also managed by Bobby Heenan. On the March 11, 1989, episode of &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XX&quot;, André got involved in a match between Rick Rude and Brutus &quot;the Barber&quot; Beefcake, siding with fellow Heenan Family member Rude. Roberts came to the ring to help Beefcake, who eventually won by disqualification. Roberts used his snake Damien to scare Andre into an eventual &quot;heart attack&quot;. Although the subsequent feud on the house show circuit saw André victorious after most of those matches, Roberts can claim a victory via disqualification over André after The Giant attacked special guest referee and former foe Big John Studd at WrestleMania V.
Shortly after his feud with André had ended, Roberts entered into a feud with Ted DiBiase. Instead of fighting for the Intercontinental Championship, the prize of the feud was DiBiase&#x27;s own Million Dollar Championship. It was at this time that Roberts&#x27; problems with the discs in his back were publicly acknowledged, as DiBiase attacked Roberts after a victory over his bodyguard Virgil on &quot;WWF Superstars of Wrestling&quot;. In the attack, Roberts was (storyline) injured by DiBiase and needed time off to have surgery to repair the damage. Roberts returned and feuded with DiBiase throughout the end of 1989 into 1990, including a point where Roberts stole DiBiase&#x27;s Million Dollar Belt, daring him or Virgil to reach into the canvas sack where Damien was to retrieve it. The culmination of their feud took place at WrestleMania VI at the Skydome in Toronto, wherein a match where the Million Dollar Belt was on the line, DiBiase gained a count-out victory over Roberts, thus regaining his non-sanctioned title. After the match, Roberts mounted an offensive against DiBiase and Virgil and then began giving away DiBiase&#x27;s &quot;money&quot; including giving some money to actress Mary Tyler Moore who was seated at ringside.

Following a brief feud with Bad News Brown in the summer of 1990, Roberts also feuded with Rick &quot;the Model&quot; Martel throughout late 1990 into early 1991, after Martel (kayfabe) blinded Roberts by spraying his cologne &quot;Arrogance&quot; into his eyes. Roberts went so far as to wear white contact lenses to &quot;prove&quot; his blindness. After several months, the feud culminated in a match at WrestleMania VII, in which both contestants were blindfolded (though both Roberts and Martel did later confess to having some limited vision due to mesh holes in the masks - these were briefly visible due to Jake putting his hand inside the mask after donning it shortly before the start of the match). The bout ended after Roberts was able to &quot;locate&quot; Martel and deliver a DDT.

====Final feuds and departure (1991–1992)====
In early to mid-1991, Roberts engaged in a feud with Earthquake who &quot;squashed&quot; Damien with a pair of Earthquake splashes during their match on the April 27 (taped March 26) edition of &quot;WWF Superstars of Wrestling&quot;. In reality, Roberts&#x27; bag contained hamburger meat intended to look like a snake and a small mechanical device to depict movement, Roberts said in several shoot interviews that he wanted to be tied up in the ring ropes while Earthquake squashed Damien, because the original plan was for Roberts to be knocked out of the ring and not let him see it. The feud was advanced when, several weeks later, Earthquake appeared on &quot;WWF Prime Time Wrestling&quot; and served &quot;Quakeburgers&quot; to co-host Lord Alfred Hayes and Vince McMahon, later claiming that the meat was ground from Damien&#x27;s carcass, which prompted McMahon to angrily knock the burger tray out of Earthquake&#x27;s hands. Roberts later introduced a new snake, Damien&#x27;s &quot;big brother&quot; Lucifer. Roberts and Earthquake feuded throughout most of late-spring and into the summer. Roberts defeated Earthquake on July 1, at Madison Square Garden with a DDT. The match featured featured André the Giant in Roberts&#x27; corner.

In the summer of 1991, there were a series of televised vignettes featuring the Ultimate Warrior turning to Roberts for help in his feud with The Undertaker. In the set-up, Roberts explained to Warrior that, after passing three tests, he would have the &quot;knowledge of the dark side&quot; to defeat Undertaker. The segments included Warrior being locked inside a coffin (a reprise of an incident that occurred on &quot;The Funeral Parlor&quot;, hosted by the Undertaker&#x27;s manager, Paul Bearer; earlier in the year); the Warrior being &quot;buried alive&quot; in dirt before being abandoned; and Warrior walking through a room full of live snakes to reach a chest containing &quot;the answer&quot;. During the latter segment, the Warrior opened the chest, only to be immediately bitten by a king cobra (actually a rubber prop). As Warrior &quot;weakened&quot; from the effects of the cobra&#x27;s strike, Roberts was joined by The Undertaker and Paul Bearer, revealing the three were working together all along; Roberts closed the final segment by proclaiming, &quot;I&#x27;m a snake. Never trust a snake.&quot;, turning Roberts heel for the first time since 1987. A series of matches were planned, but the feud was canceled after the Ultimate Warrior was fired by the WWF the night of SummerSlam.

After SummerSlam, Roberts was placed in a feud with Randy Savage. During the post-SummerSlam wedding reception of Savage and Miss Elizabeth (in reality they had been married since 1984), Elizabeth opened a gift package containing a live cobra. Roberts and the Undertaker attacked Savage, until Sid Justice ran them off. A short feud with Sid ensued when Sid was scheduled to wrestle &quot;El Diablo&quot; and the Undertaker came out and accepted the challenge to face Sid. Paul Bearer offered &quot;El Diablo&quot; what appeared to be a bribe to walk away. As the match began, &quot;El Diablo&quot; came back to the ring and hit Sid. Then &quot;El Diablo&quot; unmasked revealing himself as Jake. Roberts proceeded to unleash a king cobra on Sid, until Hacksaw Jim Duggan intervened. Sid and Jake wrestled on &quot;Superstars&quot; a week later. But soon, Sid injured his biceps, which forced the feud to end.

Roberts immediately began berating Randy Savage in a series of promos, aware that Savage – who had lost a retirement match to the Ultimate Warrior at Wrestlemania VII – was unable to exact revenge. On the November 23 (taped October 21) edition of &quot;WWF Superstars of Wrestling&quot;, Roberts goaded Savage into the ring and brutally attacked him, eventually tying Savage into the ropes and got the king cobra to bite his arm; the snake was devenomized and, according to Roberts&#x27; DVD &quot;Pick Your Poison&quot;, he had trouble getting the cobra to release his bite. According to Roberts, on the day the angle was shot, he had to let the cobra bite him on his leg at Savage&#x27;s request to convince him that the snake had been devenomized and Savage would regularly check on Roberts to make sure he had no side effects from the bite. The segment went on longer than planned, and Savage&#x27;s blood was clearly visible as it dripped from the puncture wounds. Savage stated in a shoot interview that his arm swelled and he developed a high fever afterward and had to be checked at a hospital. He also stated that the cobra died a week after the angle and he joked that the cobra must have got the venom from him.

WWF president Jack Tunney reinstated Savage as an active wrestler to get revenge for the attack. To explain the absence of the cobra, Tunney &quot;banned&quot; Roberts from ever bringing a snake to the ring again. Savage and Roberts feuded for the next few months. Their first match was at This Tuesday in Texas pay-per-view on December 3 in San Antonio, Texas, which saw Savage earn a victory over Roberts. Despite this, Roberts would perform the DDT on Savage 3 times after the match and things came to a head when Roberts slapped Miss Elizabeth. The feud continued through the early part of 1992 and included Savage eliminating Roberts from that year&#x27;s Royal Rumble match for the vacant WWF World Heavyweight Championship. The feud ended on &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XXX&quot;, with Savage getting the win. Roberts, livid at having lost to him and having received two of Savage&#x27;s flying elbow drops (one of which after the match), was helped backstage. Enraged, he grabbed a steel chair and said that he was going to hit whoever came backstage first, whether it was Savage or Elizabeth. Just as Roberts was about to swing the chair, he was stopped by the Undertaker; Roberts was distracted long enough for Savage to hit him with the chair instead. That incident helped set up Roberts&#x27; feud with the Undertaker. Roberts stated in a shoot interview with Jim Ross that the feud with Savage had to end early because Elizabeth&#x27;s parents were upset with Savage for not protecting Elizabeth when Roberts kayfabe slapped her.

Roberts appeared on &quot;The Funeral Parlor&quot; to demand answers from the Undertaker about why he stopped him from attacking Elizabeth. When Roberts was dissatisfied with the answers, he hit Bearer with a DDT and, after jamming Undertaker&#x27;s hand in a coffin, began hitting him with a steel chair; however, Undertaker got up after each chair shot and eventually chased Roberts backstage dragging the coffin behind him. At WrestleMania VIII, Roberts lost the match, becoming the second man to lose to The Undertaker at WrestleMania.

The WrestleMania VIII match turned out to be Roberts&#x27; last for the WWF for nearly four years. His departure came after he was upset that WWF chairman Vince McMahon did not offer him a position on the writing staff, despite being promised such previously. After Pat Patterson stepped down from his post on the writing staff stemming from the recent sexual harassment scandal, McMahon decided that, out of respect for Patterson, the spot would be left vacant. Roberts felt he was not only being lied to, but also being betrayed. In response, he threatened to no-show WrestleMania if he was not given a release from his contract. On his &quot;Pick Your Poison&quot; DVD, Roberts expressed his regret for his actions to get a release from his contract.

===World Championship Wrestling (1992)===
Roberts went on to work for World Championship Wrestling (WCW) alongside his father, Grizzly Smith, where he aligned himself with The Barbarian and Cactus Jack to feud against Sting and Nikita Koloff. However, before he could officially join WCW, he had to wait 90 days. According to the &quot;Pick Your Poison&quot; DVD, Roberts had initially signed a lucrative contract under Kip Allen Frey, who was running WCW at the time. On the 87th day, Frey stepped down and was replaced by Bill Watts, for whom Roberts had legit heat with back in his days at Mid-South Wrestling. Ultimately, Roberts estimates that he went from making about $3.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ) a year to approximately $200,000 () a year.

Roberts made his first television appearance on August 2, 1992, at a &quot;Main Event&quot; taping in Baltimore, Maryland after coming through the crowd to attack Sting. His first WCW match came six days later when he defeated Marcus Alexander Bagwell on a house show in Chicago, Illinois. He would quickly ally with Cactus Jack and The Barbarian. His first major TV wrestling appearance for WCW was at &quot;Clash of the Champions XX&quot;, where his team won a 4-man elimination tag match. Roberts scored a pinfall victory over Sting, which built their feud further. His single WCW pay-per-view match was against Sting at Halloween Havoc in 1992. Their match was determined via the Spin the Wheel, Make the Deal gimmick. When the wheel stopped, it had landed on what many observers believed was the worst option — the Coal Miner&#x27;s Glove match. While Halloween Havoc was the company&#x27;s top-selling pay-per-view for several years, Roberts soon left WCW.

Following the loss to Sting he continued his feud, facing him on several house shows immediately after the event. On the November 2 episode of &quot;Saturday Night&quot;, Tony Schiavone conducted a sit-down interview with Roberts regarding the decision of Bill Watts to ban his bringing of the snake to ringside, and his impending first-round match against Dustin Rhodes in the first round of the King of Cable tournament. He was replaced in the tournament by The Barbarian.

=== Various promotions (1993–1994)===
After leaving WCW, Roberts spent his next couple of years wrestling around the world. In February 1993, he took part in a tour in Australia. He won the American Wrestling Federation Heavyweight Title defeating Don Muraco on March 4. Then in April 1993, he toured Europe, particularly Austria and Germany. In September 1993, he took part wrestling a tour for New Japan Pro-Wrestling.

Roberts debuted in the Mexican promotion Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (AAA) in April 1993, causing the defeat of Konnan in the career vs. career match at Triplemanía I. Roberts&#x27; run-in started a feud that lasted until 1994 at Triplemanía II-C, in which Konnan defeated Roberts in a hair vs. hair match which Roberts got his long hair cut off and shaved bald.

In the spring of 1994, Roberts returned to the United States to wrestle for Smoky Mountain Wrestling (SMW). On May 2, he defeated Tony Anthony to win the SMW Heavyweight Championship; the title change aired on May 14. Roberts no-showed several defenses, forcing SMW to give the title back to Anthony on July 5. By the end of 1994, Roberts took a hiatus.

===Return to WWF (1996–1997)===

After spending over a year in hiatus, Roberts returned to WWF at the Royal Rumble in 1996, as a Bible-preacher. To go along with his new gimmick, his new albino Burmese python was named &quot;Revelations&quot;. His gimmick also mirrored his real life, as Roberts had recently become a born-again Christian and had been preaching around the country.
During his second tenure with the company, Roberts was pushed as a &quot;Cinderella story&quot; and faced Stone Cold Steve Austin in the final match of the 1996 King of the Ring tournament. Changes had to be made to the match&#x27;s scripting as legitimate injuries sustained earlier in the evening in a match with Vader left Roberts unable to engage in the longer, more evenly matched bout originally intended between the men. To prevent Roberts from sustaining a further injury, he was quickly defeated by Austin; in a post-match interview, Austin mocked his recital of the biblical passage John 3:16 by saying, &quot;You sit there and you thump your Bible, and you say your prayers, and it didn&#x27;t get you anywhere! Talk about your Psalms, talk about John 3:16... Austin 3:16 says I just whipped your ass!&quot; The catchphrase helped propel Austin to the top of the WWF, and is one of the moments that is often cited as the beginning of &quot;The Attitude Era&quot;. Roberts next feuded with Jerry &quot;The King&quot; Lawler, who went to great lengths to ridicule Roberts&#x27; past alcoholism.

In early 1997, the WWF wanted Roberts to wind down his in-ring career and join the company&#x27;s backstage side. Since he still loved to wrestle, he did not make this transition well. This led to a relapse with drugs and alcohol. He appeared at the 1997 Royal Rumble where he entered at no. 7 and was eliminated by Stone Cold Steve Austin. His last match with WWF was at &quot;Shotgun Saturday Night&quot; on January 25, 1997, against Salvatore Sincere in a winning effort. He was released in March 1997 after not only for being deemed too out of shape for WrestleMania, but also for being frustrated by the behavior of Shawn Michaels and Bret Hart backstage, and was a part of a creative team that had to mediate their real-life backstage bickering.

===Extreme Championship Wrestling (1997–1998)===
During the summer of 1997, Roberts debuted in ECW. His introduction came towards the end of a match between Lawler and Tommy Dreamer, which was the main event of the show. As the match went on, the arena lights were turned off. Moments later when the lights came back on, Roberts was already in the ring, and proceeded to give Tommy Dreamer a clothesline. He then went to the camera man and screamed; &quot;&quot;Your God... he giveth, and he can taketh away. My God, he giveth... but he ain&#x27;t got the balls to do nothin&#x27; else&quot;.&quot; He promptly clotheslined Lawler, who fell onto Dreamer for a two count before exiting the ring.

Roberts also teamed with Tommy Dreamer at the 1998 November to Remember as his mystery partner defeating Justin Credible and Jack Victory.

===Independent circuit (1999–2018)===
In October 1999, Roberts was one of several former NWA, WWF, and ECW wrestlers brought in to compete in the first &quot;Heroes of Wrestling&quot; event in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. He was booked to face Jim Neidhart in one half of the card&#x27;s double main event in what was billed as a &quot;special grudge match&quot; between the two. Roberts was so intoxicated that during the course of the night, he slurred his way through a promo before the match and staggered to, from, and around the ring during his entrance. After doing such things as pretending his snake was a penis and stroking it like he was masturbating and attempting to kiss the snake with his tongue, the show&#x27;s promoter sent King Kong Bundy and Yokozuna, who were supposed to compete in the other main event match, to the ring and made the main event a tag team match with Roberts teaming with Yokozuna against Bundy and Neidhart. Roberts, who was so drunk that he could not stand up, took the fall in the match after Bundy splashed and pinned him.

In 2001, Roberts moved to Great Britain, where he began competing for Brian Dixon&#x27;s All Star Wrestling. In December, he made his debut for Ricky Knight&#x27;s World Association of Wrestling in Lowestoft. On October 20, 2002, Roberts became the NWA UK Hammerlock Heavyweight Champion in Maidstone, Kent, England by defeating &quot;Vigilante&quot; Johnny Moss. Moss regained the title the next night in Ashford, Kent, though. In November 2002, Roberts started his own wrestling promotion in the UK, called &quot;Real Stars of Wrestling&quot;. RSOW ran three events, each headlined by Roberts vs. The Honky Tonk Man.

Roberts made his final British appearance at WAW&#x27;s &quot;October Outrage&quot; show in Canvey Island, Essex, once again teaming with Steve Quintain against the UK Pitbulls. However, Roberts turned up at the show &quot;in no fit state to compete&quot;, but went ahead with his match. Roberts cut a drunken promo paying tribute to Ray Traylor, who had died a few days before, and almost got into a scuffle with several WAW wrestlers who were sent out to defuse the situation.

Roberts made an appearance at Booker T&#x27;s Houston-based Pro Wrestling Alliance (PWA) promotion, in which he cut a promo urging those who want to enter the wrestling business to not follow along his path. At one point, he said he loved the wrestling business more than anything else in the world. PWA wrestler &quot;Rockstar&quot; Robbie Gillmore then interrupted Roberts and attempted to make an alliance based upon the fact that Robbie wears an 80s style shirt featuring a cobra. Roberts had just said all he ever wanted was a little respect, and the Rockstar&#x27;s interruption irritated him. Roberts then attacked Gillmore.

On October 6, 2007, he lost to Scott Hall at Juggalo Championship Wrestling.

In May 2009, Roberts joined the Jim Rose Circus for the &quot;Jim Rose Circus vs. Jake &quot;The Snake&quot; Roberts: The Legends Collide Tour&quot;. Advertised as &quot;a grueling 40 city campaign&quot; containing pretty girls, wrestling, amazing circus stunts, and a fist fight, the tour features Jim Rose and wrestler Sinn Bodhi as &quot;Team Jake&quot;.

On January 29, 2011, Roberts wrestled what was billed as his retirement match, when he defeated Sinn Bodhi at the Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (PWG) show during the WrestleReunion 5 weekend.

On May 18, 2013, Roberts returned to the ring for First State Championship Wrestling, a Delaware-based wrestling promotion, as part of an eight-man tag team main event. He teamed with Eric Chapel and CraziiWolf (Crazii Shea and Greywolf), defeating the team of Salvatore Sincere, Steve C Wrestling and Pretty Ugly (Jimmy Dream and Adam Ugly). On March 15, 2014, Roberts debuted in Regional Championship Wrestling&#x27;s Rumblemania 9 in Reading, Pennsylvania as a surprise partner for Cliff Serenyi against Russian Mafia with Rich Rogers. This match ended in a DQ. Rogers was knocked out when Roberts stuck the snake in Roger&#x27;s pants.

On June 14, 2014, Roberts participated in a six-man tag match in the main event for Reborn Wrestling (a Christian wrestling organization in Johnson City, Tennessee), teaming with The Stallion and Alex Cage to defeat E. Z. Money, Reborn Champion Cody Ices and Anthony Brody. On June 15, 2014, Roberts was an entrant in the CWF Hollywood Red Carpet Rumble which was won by Willie Mack. He wrestled his last ever match against IamThePROVIDER at BBOW No Limits Wrestling promotion on September 2, 2018.
===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2006, 2008)===
Roberts made an appearance on the October 19, 2006 episode of &quot;TNA Impact!&quot;. He announced he would referee the Monster&#x27;s Ball match between Brother Runt, Abyss, Raven, and Samoa Joe at Bound for Glory. Roberts then gave a &quot;mumbling&quot; promo. After Roberts took his snake out of a bag, Brother Runt told him to put it away. Roberts performed a DDT on Runt instead. At Bound for Glory, he performed a DDT on Raven, which helped Samoa Joe win the match. After the match, Roberts placed his snake on Raven.

Roberts made a one-night return to TNA in 2008 as a guest of &quot;Black Machismo&quot; Jay Lethal and SoCal Val&#x27;s storyline wedding at Slammiversary.

===Second return to WWE (2005, 2014)===
Roberts made an appearance on March 14, 2005, on &quot;Raw&quot;, where he confronted Randy Orton, who was preparing to challenge The Undertaker at WrestleMania 21. Roberts warned Orton that facing The Undertaker, particularly at WrestleMania, could be a soul-altering experience; he then fell victim to Orton&#x27;s &quot;RKO,&quot; helping to fuel Orton&#x27;s &quot;Legend Killer&quot; gimmick. He worked with the company to create a DVD retrospective of his career (the aforementioned &quot;Pick Your Poison&quot; DVD), which was released later that year.

In 2013, Roberts announced his desire to return to WWE as a participant in the 2014 Royal Rumble.

On January 6, 2014, Roberts made an appearance on the &quot;Old School&quot; episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, laying a python over the face of an unconscious Dean Ambrose. Roberts was announced as part of the 2014 Class of the WWE Hall of Fame. He was inducted by Diamond Dallas Page on April 5, 2014. Regarding his Hall of Fame induction, he later said, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t at all what I expected... it was more about healing between a man and his family.&quot; After his induction, he would continue to make sporadic appearances, and would also be a regular on WWE Story Time, even making an appearance on the show after his AEW debut.

===All Elite Wrestling (2019–present)===

==== Managing Lance Archer (2019–2024) ====

In 2019 during &quot;The Road to All Out&quot;, Roberts appeared as a dealer at a blackjack table dealing cards to Women&#x27;s Casino Battle Royale participants, referring to his infamous &quot;you wanna play 21?&quot; promo from 1999. On March 4, 2020, he made a surprise appearance on &quot;AEW Dynamite&quot;, interrupting Cody. In his promo, Roberts claimed that he had a &quot;client&quot; incoming to AEW to bring him down, hinting that he would be a manager for a new talent. On March 11, 2020, Roberts revealed Lance Archer as his new client. Archer was announced as a participant for the tournament for the AEW TNT Championship; he defeated Colt Cabana in the quarter finals, and Dustin Rhodes in the semi-finals. At Double or Nothing on May 23, 2020, Archer lost the final to Cody Rhodes after Mike Tyson prevented Roberts from interfering on Archer&#x27;s behalf in the finals match for the new AEW TNT Championship. In July 2021, Roberts announced he had signed a 2-year contract extension with AEW. In 2022, Roberts would reunite with Archer, who at the time also aligned himself with American Top Team leader Dan Lambert, during Archer&#x27;s feud with Adam Page for the AEW World Heavyweight Championship. Roberts would accompany Archer to the ring during Archer&#x27;s match with Wardlow on the April 27, 2022 episode of &quot;Dynamite&quot;.

On February 1, 2023, it was announced that Roberts, along with Mark Henry, Paul Wight, and Shawn Dean was named a special advisor in AEW&#x27;s community outreach program, titled &quot;AEW Together&quot;. In a press release, their roles were explained as &quot;they will bring their experience and passion for community relations to help identify partner organizations across the country, assist in incorporating talent participation and provide counsel on enhancing activations.&quot;

==== &quot;La Facción Ingobernable&quot; (2024–present) ====

On the October 8, 2024 episode of &quot;Dynamite&quot;, Roberts acquired &quot;La Facción Ingobernable&quot; (Rush, Dralístico, and The Beast Mortos) from Don Callis in exchange for Lance Archer.

==Persona==
Roberts derived his nickname for seeming snake-like and untrustworthy. On the &quot;Pick Your Poison&quot; DVD, he says he got his nickname by copying Oakland Raiders quarterback Ken &quot;The Snake&quot; Stabler (of whom he was a fan). To accentuate this, he often slid (&quot;slithered&quot;) into and out of the ring on his belly under the bottom rope. His ring name &quot;Jake Roberts&quot; was extrapolated from the initials of J. R. Ewing, the similarly backhanded character from the TV series &quot;Dallas&quot;. Once he reached the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in March 1986, he would bring a Burmese python (most were named &quot;Damien&quot;) to ringside in a canvas bag. Other types used were a reticulated python named Lucifer, an unnamed devenomized cobra, and an albino Burmese python named Revelations (during Roberts&#x27;s Christian conversion gimmick in 1996). After executing a DDT for the pin, he would place a python on the opponent, to various reactions.

Roberts has been praised for his ring psychology. Jim Ross said he also stands out for his promo work. Ted DiBiase said he enjoyed working with Roberts, and Bad News Brown called him his second-best opponent. Randy Savage said he enjoyed his run with Roberts, whose work was impressive.

==Spoken word career==
In 2018, Roberts embarked on his a series of spoken word shows dubbed The Dirty Details Tour, subtitled &quot;Tales From The Pit&quot;. According to social media the tour was to feature &quot;an uncensored night of comedy, stories from the road, Q&amp;A and more&quot;. The tour kicked off on November 6, 2018, at the Lookout Lounge in Omaha, Nebraska.

==Other media==
In the late 1980s, Roberts made a guest appearance on the DJ Kat Show on Fox, challenging DJ to a match after the Kat had badmouthed the profession.

In 1996, Roberts, Vader, and Brother Love appeared on the ABC sitcom &quot;Boy Meets World&quot; for one episode.

In 1999, Roberts was unflatteringly featured in the wrestling documentary &quot;Beyond the Mat&quot;. Throughout the film, he made confessions about his tragic past, including the murder of his sister by her husband&#x27;s ex-wife and the collapse of his marriage. He was also shown enjoying the taste of a post match cigarette. Amongst the more disturbing moments was Roberts reportedly smoking crack in a hotel room after a reunion with his daughter Brandy, though the act is not shown on camera. In 2005, Roberts, along with others, heavily criticized the film for showing him in a negative light, complaining that the depiction of him was &quot;not the real Jake Roberts.&quot; Roberts also stated that director Barry Blaustein and Terry Funk lied to him about the aims of the film, telling him it was a television special on the effects of drug and alcohol abuse.

Roberts was featured in another wrestling documentary in 2015 entitled &quot;The Resurrection of Jake the Snake&quot;, which chronicled his time living with Diamond Dallas Page beginning in October 2012.

Roberts appeared as Mr. Lucas, the owner of a gourmet condom company, in the comedy film, &quot;The Bet&quot; which also featured Dallas Page and Roddy Piper.

Roberts also made an appearance in &quot;An Almost True Story: TOXIC TUTU&quot; in 2015, as himself, in a scene with Jonny Fairplay from &quot;Survivor&quot;.

Roberts has a role in the 2019 film &quot;The Peanut Butter Falcon&quot;.

Beginning on January 4, 2022, Roberts will take part in a podcast with Diamond Dallas Page and Conrad Thompson titled &quot;DDP Snakepit&quot;.

On February 26, 2023, Roberts was the subject of the .

In July 2024 Roberts played Vance in The Skies Are Watching, an audio sci-fi thriller for BBC Radio 4 and Tribeca Audio.

==Health issues==
Roberts is known for his raspy, whispery voice. He revealed in 2023 that it was the product of an accident in the ring involving a fight with former Olympian Bob Roop, in which he dropped a knee on Roberts&#x27; throat and accidentally crushed his voice box. From that moment on, Roberts was forced to speak in a lower register.

In 2007, WWE started a policy of paying all expenses for its former performers who wanted to start drug rehabilitation programs. Roberts was placed in a 14-week voluntary rehab program by WWE in December 2007. In May 2008, Jim Ross reported that Roberts &quot;has been doing well the past few weeks, after completing a treatment program&quot;.

In October 2012, while financially distressed and having resumed abusing alcohol and drugs, Roberts moved in with former wrestler Diamond Dallas Page in Atlanta, Georgia, a time which was chronicled in the documentary &quot;The Resurrection of Jake the Snake&quot;. His weight had ballooned to over 300 lb (136 kg) and he was having trouble doing simple tasks such as walking without becoming short of breath. During filming, Roberts had shoulder surgery which was paid for through crowdfunding. After 18 months, he had lost over 50 lb (22 kg) and regained mobility.

In February 2014, TMZ reported that Roberts had muscular cancer below his knee and was scheduled to go into surgery. In a response to the article, Roberts was quoted as saying, &quot;If the devil can&#x27;t defeat me, cancer doesn&#x27;t stand a chance in hell! Pray for sick children who face this horrible disease &#x27;cause The Snake will be just fine.&quot; In July 2014, he announced that he was cancer-free after various surgeries.

In August 2014, Roberts fell ill during a flight from Atlanta to Las Vegas, where he was scheduled to attend a birthday event for fellow wrestler Nick Cvjetkovich. First reports indicated that Roberts had fallen unconscious, but his manager/lawyer, Kyle P. Magee, confirmed that Roberts was alert and awake during the flight and notified the flight attendant of his pain and shortness of breath. Magee said that Roberts was induced to a &quot;coma-like&quot; state in order to treat pneumonia. He was diagnosed with the flu two weeks earlier and ignored doctors&#x27; advice of rest and continued to travel to events. Upon arrival at the ICU in Las Vegas, he was diagnosed with double pneumonia. Doctors also found an abnormality on his brain which they felt could be a result of all the bumps Roberts took over his long career.

Jim Ross, in one of the episodes of his &quot;&#x27;Grilling JR&quot; podcast, revealed that Roberts still remains in poor health with breathing issues and pending surgeries.

In November 2020, Roberts was taken to the hospital after feeling breathless during a long period of persistent coughing. After several days, he was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He missed AEW tapings on December 16 and 17, citing this illness.
