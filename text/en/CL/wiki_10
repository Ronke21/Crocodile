<text>Hans Jack Berliner (January 27, 1929 – January 13, 2017) was an American chess player, and was the World Correspondence Chess Champion, from 1965–1968. He was a Grandmaster of Correspondence Chess. Berliner was a Professor of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. He directed the construction of the chess computer HiTech, and was also a published chess writer.

==Early life==
Berliner was born January 27, 1929, in Berlin to a Jewish family. One of his classmates at school was future Estonian President Lennart Meri, whose father was serving as Estonia&#x27;s ambassador to Germany.
In 1937, Berliner&#x27;s family moved to the United States to escape Nazi persecution, taking up residence in Washington, D.C. He learned chess at age 13, and &quot;it quickly became his main preoccupation.&quot;

Berliner is mentioned in &quot;How I Started To Write&quot;, an essay by Carlos Fuentes, where he is described as &quot;an extremely brilliant boy&quot;, with &quot;a brilliant mathematical mind&quot;. &quot;I shall always remember his face, dark and trembling, his aquiline nose and deep-set, bright eyes with their great sadness, the sensitivity of his hands...&quot;

==Chess career==
In 1949, he became a master, won the District of Columbia Championship (the first of five wins of that tournament) and the Southern States Championship, and tied for second place with Larry Evans at the New York State Championship. He also won the 1953 New York State Championship (the first win by a non-New Yorker), the 1956 Eastern States Open directed by Norman Tweed Whitaker in Washington, D.C., ahead of William Lombardy, Nicolas Rossolimo, Bobby Fischer (at age 13) and Arthur Feuerstein, and the 1957 Champion of Champions tournament.
Berliner played for his country&#x27;s Olympiad team at Helsinki 1952, drawing his only game on the second reserve board. Berliner played four times in the US Chess Championship. In 1954 at New York, he scored 6½/13 to tie 8–9th places; Arthur Bisguier won. The last three times Berliner played in the U.S. Championship, Fischer won the tournament. In 1957–58 at New York, Berliner had his best result, 5th place with 7/13. In 1960–61 at New York, he scored 4½/11, tying for 8th–10th place. Finally in 1962–63 at New York, he scored 5/11 for a tied 7th–8th place.

===Correspondence chess===
Berliner is remembered most for his feats in correspondence play, in which games played by mail can take months or even years to complete. He won the 5th World Correspondence Chess Championship, beginning the final game on April 1, 1965, and finishing three years later. He won with the score of 14/16 (twelve wins, four draws), a margin of victory of three points, thrice that of any other winner in these championships.

Berliner played the Two Knights Defense to defeat Yakov Estrin in that tournament. Berliner&#x27;s opening novelty in that variation is still considered critical.

As of March 31, 2005, Berliner still had by far the highest International Correspondence Chess Federation (ICCF) rating of any player in the United States, at 2726, 84 points above the second-highest rated player. Berliner&#x27;s 2726 rating placed him third on the ICCF&#x27;s world list, behind Joop van Oosterom (2777) and Ulf Andersson (2737).

==Computer chess research==
Berliner started a new career in 1969, enrolling in the doctoral program at Carnegie Mellon University to study computer science, under the supervision of Allen Newell. His 1974 thesis was titled: &quot;Chess as Problem Solving: The Development of a Tactics Analyzer&quot;.

His subsequent research at Carnegie Mellon eventually led to the creation of HiTech. At first it performed well, but only until it ran into transitions, that is, points in the game when the balance between the players changed. This led Berliner to conclude that HiTech was weak in board evaluation. He decided that to explore the problem, he should write an evaluation function for another game: backgammon. The result was BKG, written in the late 1970s on a DEC PDP-10. Early versions of BKG played badly even against poor players, but Berliner noticed that its critical mistakes were always at transitions. He applied principles of fuzzy logic to smooth out the transition between phases, and by July 1979, BKG 9.8 was strong enough to play against the ruling world champion Luigi Villa. It won the match 7–1, becoming the first computer program to defeat a world champion in any game. Berliner states that the victory was largely a matter of luck, as the computer received more favorable dice rolls.
He also developed the B* search algorithm for game tree searching.

HiTech was the first computer chess system to reach the 2400 (senior master) USCF rating level. It won the Pennsylvania State Chess Championship several times. Students who worked with Berliner on the project included Carl Ebeling and Murray Campbell.

Berliner was elected a Founding Fellow of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence in 1990.

==Writing and retirement==
Berliner retired from Carnegie Mellon in 1998.

In 1998 he self-published a booklet, &quot;From the Deathbed of 4. Ng5 in the Two Knights Defense&quot;, analyzing the opening of his game with Estrin, as well as attempted improvements upon it by subsequent commentators.

In 1999 he published a book explaining his opening repertoire, &quot;The System&quot;. He claimed that the move gives White a large, and possibly decisive, advantage.

He died on January 13, 2017, in Riviera Beach, Florida, fourteen days away from his 88th birthday.

<text>Anil Dash (; born September 5, 1975) is an American technology executive, entrepreneur, Prince scholar and writer. He is the Head of Glitch and VP of Developer Experience at Fastly.

==Career==
In 1999, Dash launched his personal weblog, dashes.com (now anildash.com), while working as an independent technology consultant. From 2001 to 2003, he worked as a new media developer for the &quot;Village Voice&quot; before becoming the first employee of Six Apart, the makers of Movable Type, TypePad, and Vox, where he served as a vice president until 2009.

From 2009 to 2012 he served as the director of Expert Labs, a Gov 2.0 project to facilitate political participation. After this work, he became an advisor to the White House Office of Digital Strategy under the Obama administration.

He was also previously a partner with Michael J. Wolf in Activate Consulting, a media and technology management consulting firm, and a co-founder (with Gina Trapani) and CEO of ThinkUp, a social media aggregation and analysis tool. The company was shuttered in June 2016. Dash was appointed CEO of Fog Creek Software in December 2016. On September 25, 2018, the company was renamed Glitch after its flagship product. In March 2020, Glitch and its union signed a collective bargaining agreement, the first in the tech industry.

Dash was host of &quot;Function with Anil Dash&quot;, a podcast about technology&#x27;s effects on culture, co-produced by Glitch and Vox Media The podcast ran for two seasons from 2018 to 2020.

Dash is also a scholar of the musician Prince. 

==NFTs==
In 2014, as part of a collaboration with Kevin McCoy, Dash co-created Monegraph, a blockchain-based system for verifying original digital artworks initially called &quot;monetized graphics&quot;, which has since been called the first implementation of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

Dash has been critical of present day usage of the NFT concept, stating &quot;The only thing we’d wanted to do was ensure that artists could make some money and have control over their work,&quot; and that co-creator &quot;McCoy still believes that blockchain technologies can help artists sustain their work.&quot;

==Recognition==

In 2004, he won an SEO contest which required contestants to get the top Google ranking for the made-up phrase &quot;nigritude ultramarine&quot;.

In 2010, Dash&#x27;s weblog was an honoree in the Personal Blog/Website category of the 2010 Webby Awards. In 2022 Dash and McCoy won the Webby lifetime achievement award for the development of NFTs.

==Personal life==
Dash was born to Odia parents from India and grew up near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. He lives in New York City with his wife Alaina Browne and one child.

<doc id="1156271" wikidata="Q2404292" url="?curid=1156271" title="Teradyne">
<text>Teradyne, Inc. is an American automatic test equipment (ATE) designer and manufacturer based in North Reading, Massachusetts. Its high-profile customers include Samsung, Qualcomm, Intel, Analog Devices, Texas Instruments and IBM.

==History==

Teradyne was founded by Alex d&#x27;Arbeloff and Nick DeWolf, who were classmates at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the late 1940s. The men founded Teradyne in 1960, and set up shop in rented space above Joe and Nemo&#x27;s hotdog stand in downtown Boston. The name, Teradyne, was intended to represent a very forceful presence. 1,000,000,000,000 dynes = 10 meganewtons (2,248,089 pounds-force or 1,019,716 kilograms-force).

d&#x27;Arbeloff and DeWolf knew that testing electronic components in high-volume production would reach a bottleneck, unless the tasks performed by technicians and laboratory instruments could be automated. Their business plan involved a new breed of &quot;industrial-grade&quot; electronic test equipment, known for its technical performance, reliability and economic payback.

In 1961, d&#x27;Arbeloff and DeWolf sold their first product, a logic-controlled go/no-go diode tester, to Raytheon.

In the 1980s, Teradyne expanded its sub-assembly test business by acquiring Zehntel, a leading manufacturer of in-circuit board test systems. In 1987, the company introduced the first analog VLSI test system, the A500, which led the market in testing integrated devices that provided the interface between analog and digital data.

The 1990s brought more diversification. The company acquired Megatest Corporation, which expanded its Semiconductor Test group to include smaller and less expensive testers than had been currently available. Teradyne also became a market leader in high-end System-on-a-Chip (SoC) test with its Catalyst and Tiger test systems.

In 2000, Teradyne Connection Systems acquired Herco Technologies and Synthane-Taylor, and a year later they acquired circuit-board test and inspection leader, GenRad, and merged it into the Assembly Test Division. GenRad&#x27;s Diagnostic Solutions, which made test equipment for the automotive manufacturing and service industries, became a separate product group for Teradyne.

In 2006, Teradyne sold its two Boston buildings and consolidated all of its Boston-area staff to its current site in North Reading, Massachusetts.

Teradyne grew its semiconductor test business with the addition of Nextest and Eagle Test Systems in 2008, serving the flash memory test market and high-volume analog test market, respectively. That same year, Teradyne entered the disk-drive test market with the internally developed Neptune product, which serves the data-intensive internet and computing storage markets.

In 2010, Teradyne celebrated its 50th anniversary. The following year, it acquired LitePoint Corporation, a leading provider of test instruments for use with wireless products, such as laptops PCs, tablets, home networking and cell phones. With the addition of LitePoint, Teradyne&#x27;s product portfolio stretched from wafer test of semiconductor chips to system-level circuit boards to products ready for store shelves.

Upon d&#x27;Arbeloff&#x27;s retirement, George Chamillard assumed the post of President and CEO. He was replaced at his retirement by former CFO Mike Bradley. Bradley retired in January 2014, and was in turn replaced by Semiconductor Test Division president Mark Jagiela.

Teradyne operates major facilities around the world, with headquarters in North Reading, Massachusetts.

<text>Give It Up is the second studio album by American musician Bonnie Raitt. Released in 1972 by Warner Bros. Records, &quot;Give It Up&quot; is an amalgamation of various genres, including folk, blues, R&amp;B, and soft rock. Seven of the ten tracks on the album are covers, and the tracks range from soft sentimental ballads to fast-paced folk rock pieces. Lyrically, &quot;Give It Up&quot; revolves around Raitt&#x27;s femininity, relationships, and being comfortable with herself. Raitt recorded the album at Bearsville Studios with producer Michael Cuscuna.

&quot;Give It Up&quot; was Raitt&#x27;s first album to reach the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tapes chart, where it peaked at number 138. The initial reception was positive, as critics liked the vocals and the musicianship throughout the album. Contemporary reviews are also positive, with some critics calling &quot;Give It Up&quot; a stand-out album within Raitt&#x27;s discography. In 2012, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Give It Up&quot; at number 495 on its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

==Composition==
&quot;Give It Up&quot; was recorded in June 1972 at Bearsville Studios in New York, with producer Michael Cuscuna. It is an amalgamation of several music genres, including folk, blues, R&amp;B, and soft rock. The ten tracks on the album are a mix of soft sentimental ballads and fast-paced folk rock pieces. Some of the faster tracks are accompanied by brass instrumentation, which is played in the style of a New Orleans brass band. This sound is demonstrated on the opening track &quot;Give It Up or Let Me Go&quot;. It begins with an acoustic guitar, but then transitions into an explosive sound of a brass band, reminiscent of Dixieland music. &quot;Give It Up&quot; features many guest musicians, most of which were from the area around Woodstock, New York. Among these are future politician John Hall, multi-instrumentalist Freebo, and blues singer Paul Butterfield. Overall, &quot;Give It Up&quot; has a smoother, more polished sound than its predecessor &quot;Bonnie Raitt&quot;.

Raitt wrote three songs for the album. The other seven songs are covers of songs by musicians like Chris Smither, Jackson Browne, and Joel Zoss. Lyrically, &quot;Give It Up&quot; revolves around Raitt&#x27;s femininity, relationships, and being comfortable with herself. According to biographer Mark Bego, Raitt sounds more confident while singing on this album when compared to her vocal performance on &quot;Bonnie Raitt&quot;. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote: &quot;Raitt can be earthy and sexy, but she balances it with an inviting sensuality that makes the record glow&quot;. Raitt herself would later criticize the vocals, stating: &quot;I sound like Mickey Mouse!&quot;

==Release and reception==

&quot;Give It Up&quot; was released in September 1972 by Warner Bros. Records. It sold moderately well, and was Raitt&#x27;s first album to reach the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tapes chart, where it peaked at number 138. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in 1985, denoting shipments of 500,000 copies. The song &quot;Too Long at the Fair&quot; was released as a promotional single to radio stations, although it did not reach any music charts.

&quot;Give It Up&quot; received positive reviews upon release. A critic for &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine wrote: &quot;Bonnie Raitt is presented in her second album for the label and it should be a big one. Her unique vocal treatments and guitar style on &#x27;Stayed [&quot;sic&quot;] Too Long at the Fair&#x27; and the title song should do a lot to sell the album.&quot; &quot;Record World&quot; described &quot;Give It Up&quot; as &quot;an exceptional effort. The choice of material, from the self-penned numbers to a stunning Jackson Browne tune, is excellent and the musicianship and production could hardly be better.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Jon Landau also praised the album, writing that &quot;the best thing about Bonnie Raitt is her singing, and the best thing about &quot;Give It Up&quot; is that she sings great from beginning to end; in doing so, she successfully handles a far greater range of styles and material than on her first album and has produced a more interesting and satisfying record in the process.&quot; Landau highlighted the three original songs, and called &quot;Love Has No Pride&quot; the perfect summation of Raitt&#x27;s musical abilities.

Retrospective appraisals have also been positive. In &quot;The New Rolling Stone Record Guide&quot;, critic Bart Testa wrote: &quot;&quot;Give It Up&quot; [comes] closest to perfecting her approach: she [mingles] her blues resources with a variety of contemporary and folk-oriented songs, coming up with classics in &#x27;Been Too Long at the Fair&#x27; and Eric Kaz&#x27;s &#x27;Love Has No Pride&#x27;.&quot; Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic noted how singers like Sheryl Crow and Shelby Lynne were likely inspired by &quot;Give It Up&quot;, and ultimately described it as &quot;one of the great Southern California records.&quot; In a review published for &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Robert Christgau commended Raitt&#x27;s maturity and intelligence in both her style of play as well as her lyrics. Christgau later ranked &quot;Give It Up&quot; at number 31 on his decade-end list of the best albums of the 1970s.

In 2012, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Give It Up&quot; at number 495 on its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, calling it &quot;gorgeous folksy blues&quot;.

<text>Segismundo Casado López (10 October 1893 – 18 December 1968) was a Spanish Army officer; he served during the late Restoration, the Primo de Rivera dictatorship and the Second Spanish Republic. Following outbreak of the Spanish Civil War he sided with the Republicans, gradually rising to commander of the Army of the Centre. He is best known as leader of the coup against the government of Juan Negrín; its objectives were preventing a Communist takeover and terminating fratricidal bloodshed during the war, considered already lost. The rebels seized control of the Republican zone; in their quasi-government Casado served as the minister of defense. Negotiations with the Nationalists failed; Casado went on exile, first to Britain and from 1947 to Latin America, returning to Spain in 1961.

==Military career==

There is little clarity as to Casado&#x27;s parents. Himself he claimed - and this information is reproduced by the Spanish Real Academia de la Historia - that his parents, Tomás Casado Arribas and Tomasa López Quinsano, were farmers, and that his father worked as &quot;bracero&quot;. According to his own account during childhood and youth he suffered misery and it was thanks to extraordinary efforts of his parents that he managed to complete education in a local primary school. However, numerous other sources claim that his father was a military officer and served as an infantry captain.

===Junior officer===

As an adolescent in 1907 Casado entered the Cavalry Academy in Valladolid. Having completed the curriculum as 15th among 44 graduates, in 1911 he was promoted to &quot;segundo teniente&quot;. Initially he was posted to Regimento Cazadores de Almansa, but was soon transferred to 4. Regimento de Caballería in Burgos; within this unit he was posted to 1. Deposito de Caballos Sementales in Jérez de la Frontera. In 1912 he was again transferred to Regimento de Lanceros del Príncipe. In 1913 he was promoted to &quot;teniente primero&quot;. In 1912-1916 he followed various courses, e.g. at Curso de Escuela de Equitación Militar, Escuela Central de Tiro and Secciones de Obreros y Explosivos en lor Regimientos del Arma. In 1917 he was deployed with his regiment on public order duties during a general strike. In 1918 Casado entered Escuela Superior de Guerra; in 1919 he was promoted to captain.

In 1921 Casado was transferred to Larache in Spanish Morocco and assigned to a machine-gun company, deployed mostly as protection of various logistics operations. He was appreciated by superiors, who in reports noted Casado&#x27;s distinguished role in combat and in the rear. However, following less than half a year in Morocco in 1922 he was withdrawn from the line, and assigned to the Regimento Mixto de Artillería and then to the Comandancia General de Ceuta. In 1923 Casado received the General Staff diploma.

In 1924 Casado was recorded within the Alcalá de Henares garrison. He assumed command of a squadron in the Regimento de Lanceros de la Reina in Madrid the following year. In 1928 he entered another military course intended for candidates to higher officer ranks, and in 1929 he was promoted to &quot;comandante&quot;. A year later he was posted to the Escuela de Estudios Superiores (later Escuela Superior de Guerra), but this time as auxiliary professor at Curso de Táctica y Servicio de Estado Mayor. According to his own account, from the onset Casado opposed the Primo de Rivera dictatorship; documents confirm that in 1927 he defended in military court some individuals involved in the so-called Sanjuanada, and in 1929 he represented in court the officers deemed engaged in rebellious activities in Ciudad Real.

===Senior officer===

The advent of the Republic produced military reform and revision of some promotions; in 1931 Casado&#x27;s ascension to commandant was reversed. Casado continued to work in Escuela Superior; in 1931 he published a study, &quot;Organización del Ejército Francés&quot;, and in 1933 &quot;Empleo de la División de Caballería en el Servicio de Exploración estratégica&quot; followed. According to some sources, at the time Casado became one of key advocates of armored units, up to total replacement of cavalry with &quot;arma blindada&quot;. In late 1934 he was (again) nominated to comandante. In early 1935 Casado was nominated commander of personal detachment of the president (escolta del presidente), Niceto Alcalá-Zamora; from May 1936 he performed the same role serving the new president, Manuel Azaña.

According to some sources, during the coup of July 1936, Casado personally decided that Azaña be relocated from his residence in El Pardo to the centre of Madrid; the move which might have prevented Azaña&#x27;s captivity, as the presidential communications unit rebelled. He than served in Sierra de Guadarrama, according to some in general staff of “columna Bernal”, and according to others as “jefe de la columna Galán”. In October 1936 he was recalled to Madrid and assumed the role of head of the operations department at the General Staff, reportedly because he was considered an “excellent planner”; he was also promoted to teniente coronel. Other sources claim he was dismissed as head of operations shortly after.

In late 1936 Casado remained engaged in organisation, planning and teaching. Following the decision to build mixed brigades he was active raising those units, though instead of the original concept of autonomous operations, he preferred them to be part of divisions. He kept lecturing at Escuela Popular de Estado Mayor, soon relocated to Valencia; at one point he became the head of the institution. In May 1937 Casado was nominated general inspector of the cavalry. During the summer of 1937 he assumed command of XVIII Army Corps, which at the time mounted an offensive in Aragon; following an initial advance, the corps failed to reach its objectives. In September 1937 Casado was nominated commander of the newly formed XXI Army Corps, also deployed in Aragon. In March 1938 he assumed command of the Army of Andalusia, but in May he returned to Madrid to head the Army of the Centre. Also in May he was promoted to coronel. In February 1939 Casado was promoted to general.

===Casado&#x27;s coup===

Throughout 1938 Casado developed doubts about the prime minister Negrín&#x27;s strategy to keep on fighting. He was increasingly convinced that the war was already lost, and that further resistance would only produce unnecessary deaths, suffering and destruction. He blamed the Communists for prolonging the war in the interest of the Soviet Union. In late 1938 Casado engaged in talks with some politicians about forming an anti-Negrín opposition, and in early 1939 he entered into secret peace talks with the Nationalists. In February the conspiracy was already well developed; Casado was its undisputed leader, supported by most of the military command layer, the Anarchists and the Socialists.

On March 5, 1939, the plotters declared the constitution of the Consejo Nacional de Defensa (CND), which claimed all power in the Republican zone; it was presented as a pre-emptive strike against an imminent dictatorial Communist takeover. Casado was the key man behind CND; during a phone talk with Negrín he refused to budge. He temporarily acted as the CND president, but ceded the post to general Miaja the following day and within the body he assumed office as counselor of defence. It is not clear to what extent Casado was commanding CND-loyal troops during fighting against the Communist-loyal units, fighting that went on in Madrid until March 11. Once CND assumed full control over the Republic, Casado took part in some juridical proceedings, resulting in death sentences and execution of some Communist leaders, including Luis Barceló.

Casado and the CND continued talks with the Nationalists. He intended to negotiate a staged surrender, evacuation of all those willing to leave Spain, with the added proviso of no political repression afterwards; he might have even hoped for re-integration of professional Republican officers into the post-war army. The Nationalists demanded immediate and unconditional surrender; and with no such document signed, Casado eventually realised that further negotiations were pointless. On March 26 CND ordered the end of resistance to the Nationalist advance, which commenced the next day. On March 28 Casado flew out of Madrid to Valencia. According to some sources he tried to arrange ships for mass evacuation and in his last radio broadcast he claimed they would be available in Alicante; according to others he did close to nothing in terms of enabling evacuation. On March 29, in Gandia, Casado boarded a British warship, which set sail in the early hours of March 30.

==Exile and life as a retiree==

Casado was transported to Marseille on a British hospital ship. He then travelled to the United Kingdom, most likely with approval of the London government. He received a stipend from the British Committee for Refugees from Spain; following intervention of the Foreign Office, his allowances were set at a higher rate than normally. In late 1939 he was given a job in the Spanish section of the BBC; he commented on military issues using the pseudonym of &quot;Coronel Juan de Padilla&quot;. According to some scholars, BBC World Service served as a sort of a repository for individuals that British Intelligence thought potentially useful in the future. He wrote &quot;The Last Days of Madrid&quot;, the book translated and published in record time; one author suspects MI6 was involved. It is not clear when his job at the BBC was terminated and what he was doing for a living in the mid-1940s.

At some time Casado got professionally involved with the Swiss multi-national food conglomerate Nestlé. In 1947 he left Britain for Colombia as an employee of its Colombian subsidiary, Cicolac. He might have hoped for some role in politics, as he speculated that following the end of World War Two and in the atmosphere of international anti-Franco ostracism, the British were likely to enforce the fall of the Franco regime, an outcome that might see a role for him back in Spain. In 1949 he moved to Indulac, the Nestlé subsidiary for Venezuela. He spent 12 years there, touring the country as a commercial representative. As he turned 60 he developed various health problems, finding from the mid-1950s his work was getting increasingly challenging.

In 1961 Casado returned to Spain; it is not clear whether before doing so he had any contacts with the Francoist administration. He settled in Madrid at calle Cea Bermúdez and initially was not subject to any juridical or administrative harassment, this despite the fact that in 1943 he had been tried by Tribunal Especial para la Represión de la Masonería y el Comunismo and in 1944 had been sentenced to 12 years in prison for rebellion. 

In Spain, finding his Nestlé pension was hardly sufficient, in 1962 he applied for a military pension. This triggered an investigation by the authorities, including focus on his role in the Republican armed forces. Eventually charges of military rebellion were dropped, though he was briefly placed under house arrest. In 1966 he suffered a minor heart attack. To address ongoing financial problems, in 1967 he re-published &quot;The Last Days&quot;, in Spanish titled &quot;Así cayó Madrid&quot;; first serialised in a Falange periodical &quot;El Pueblo&quot;, it was then issued as a book. It was re-edited to be even more damning to Negrín.

==Private life==

In 1920 Casado married María de las Mercedes de la Calle Condado; none of the sources consulted provides any information either on her or on her family, except that she survived the civil war. The marriage did not last and produced no offspring. It is not clear whether the couple divorced or the marriage was annulled. At unspecified time, either in the early or in the mid-1930s, Casado married María del Carmen Santodomingo de Vega (1911-1976). They had 2 children: Carmen and Segismundo Casado Santodomingo, born in the mid-1930s. In unclear circumstances the family got separated upon Casado leaving Spain in 1939; his wife and children remained in the country and initially sought refuge in the diplomatic legation of Panama. As the premises were stormed by the Francoists she was imprisoned and initially held in a cell with prostitutes. Later the family were denied passports. Casado&#x27;s efforts to secure their exit, aided informally by British diplomacy in the early 1940s, proved fruitless.

In the early 1940s Casado entered into an intimate relationship with an Englishwoman, Norah Purcell, just divorced from a colonial administrator and sinologist Victor Purcell; she later gained some recognition as a translator from French. They lived together for six years and had a daughter, María Cristina (surname unclear), who died in 1946. For reasons which remain unknown, the union ended with Casado&#x27;s departure for Latin America, though apparently Casado was still in love and tried to maintain amorous correspondence at least until the early 1950s. In 1951 he was re-joined by his wife and both children in Venezuela. However, he soon concluded that they were “totally incompatible” and suggested she go back to Spain; details and background of their differences are not known. Nevertheless, the family lived together. Carmen accompanied Casado when he returned to Spain; the children remained in Venezuela.

Casado had at least one brother, César; it is not clear who of the siblings was older. Like Segismundo, he also became a professional cavalry officer and both brothers progressed almost simultaneously through the military promotion ladder, e.g. in 1913 both were segundos tenientes, in 1923-1924 both were capitanes, and in 1936 both were comandantes. He was recorded as related to the Madrid branch of the Anarchist trade union CNT. During the civil war he sided with the Republicans and in July 1938 as mayor de caballería was assigned “a las ordénes de la Subsecretaria de Tierra” in the Ministry of Defense. The position he took during the coup of March 1939 is not clear. It is known, however, that the brothers had a falling out and after the war Segismundo explicitly forbade his children to accept any financial help from César.

==Outlook and political views==

Casado&#x27;s political views are not entirely clear, though he was without doubt a man of the Left. In his publications and in his private correspondence he used to refer to his childhood, spent in the misery and poverty of the rural working class, which reportedly made him sensitive to social injustice. This might not seem compatible with his entry into professional military service, as at the time the army along the monarchy and the Church were considered pillars of the regime, though on the other hand he was only 15 when applying to the military academy. There is no trace of his political engagements until he was in his early 30s. He did not welcome the Primo de Rivera dictatorship; in his own papers Casado refers to himself as a rebel, though there is no evidence of any rebellious activity recorded. However, at least twice he appeared in military courts defending fellow officers charged with conspiracy against the regime.

Despite reversion of his promotion to &quot;comandante&quot; Casado did not seem to harbor any grievances against the Republic. Though he did not engage in open politics, he must have been considered a loyal republican officer as, in 1935, he was nominated to the position of commander of the personal guard of the president, even though at the time the Right was in power. There is no doubt as to his loyalty to the Republic following the coup d&#x27;état of July 1936, which was far more than simple “lealtad geográfica” of many professional officers trapped in the Republican zone. Some scholars claim that in late 1936 he developed a particular knack against the Communists, as he blamed them for his sidetracking from General Staff operations towards other organisational work; he is presented as a man “eaten up with resentment”, though on personal rather than political grounds. His brother seemed related to the Anarchist CNT, but there is no evidence that Segismundo was close to Anarchism; neither is there any data which points to his relation to Socialism. Some authors claim that &quot;he broadly shared Azaña&#x27;s view of politics&quot;, which points to radical left-wing republicanism.

In his own papers and in some historiographic literature, Casado is pictured as a man of decisively progressive outlook, determined to fight for democracy, liberty and social justice against any sort of dictatorship – be it a Communist or a Francoist one. It is not clear whether Casado was a Catholic; it is known that some time in the 1920s he joined the freemasonry, which was not necessarily incompatible with some sort of unorthodox, liberal Catholicism. 

Either from childhood or from some point in his adult life he embraced anti-Semitism. In his papers from the 1950s he refers abusively to Franco as the “Jewish dwarf”; at the same time, when engaged in fruitless discussions on changing his travelling work pattern in Venezuela, he blamed his managers from Indulac for “Jewish mentality”. However, he remained reasonably tractable and for decades he was engaged in at least correct epistolographic exchange with correspondents as distant as Indalecio Prieto, Salvador de Madariaga, Cipriano Mera and the Alfonsist pretender Juan de Borbón.

==In public discourse==

In popular discourse of Francoist Spain, Casado was rather absent; if mentioned, he was noted as the one who mounted a pre-emptive anti-Communist strike. This was the thesis repeated also in academic historiography. In his monumental work on the Spanish Civil War, written in the 1960s, Hugh Thomas presented Casado as a man much less far-sighted than Negrín and perhaps guilty of some political naivete; however, from the narrative he still emerged as a well-intended person, even if somewhat guided by personal grievances against PCE. Casado&#x27;s &quot;Asi cayo Madrid&quot; was rather well received by critics; reviewers presented the book as defense against absurd Communist charges of surrendering the Republic “cuando el pueblo quería continuar la lucha”. Following his death newspapers adhered to a very matter-of-fact tone, at times again presenting him as a man who prevented a Communist coup. In the early 1970s historian Ricardo de la Cierva referred to him as “destacado teórico y técnico militar”.

Since the 1980s most scholars concluded there was no Communist coup d&#x27;état planned, which dismantled part of the rationale behind the 1939 coup. Instead of pointing to a coup against “Communist-dominated government”, some authors started to note a coup “against the legal government”. Casado&#x27;s personal motivations were increasingly focused on, with emphasis on excessive ambition. The advent of social and digital media produced an array of opinions, from those lambasting Casado as traitor to these counting him among the heroes and great patriots, as well as other voices in-between. In historiography the coup was increasingly viewed, not as an act to stop further killing, but as an avoidable error which facilitated the triumph of a Francoist dictatorship. 

A major onslaught on Casado was launched by Paul Preston; his 2016 work presented Casado as a man obsessed with his own ambition who precipitated a massive humanitarian disaster. In 2018 author Pedro López Ortega published a book that advanced the opposite view: Casado “represented realism and humanitarian sensitivity against folly and fanaticism of the others”.

In his native town of Nava de la Asunción, until recently there was a minor street named after Casado, but it was renamed and currently in Spain there is none. In 1976 José María Rodríguez Méndez wrote &quot;Ultima batalla en El Pardo&quot;, a theatrical drama centred on the 1939 coup; its protagonists were Franco and Casado. The work deals with the question of an individual facing great events and does not appear to take sides; it was not published until the 1990s and in the 21st century made it to stage. Casado featured as a protagonist in a few Spanish novels, set in the Madrid of early 1939. In Spanish public discourse it is at times claimed that the iconic actor known as Fernando Rey (Fernando Casado) was the son of Segismundo Casado; in fact, he was son to another Republican military official.

<text>The Brown University Standard Corpus of Present-Day American English, better known as simply the Brown Corpus, is an electronic collection of text samples of American English, the first major structured corpus of varied genres. This corpus first set the bar for the scientific study of the frequency and distribution of word categories in everyday language use. Compiled by Henry Kučera and W. Nelson Francis at Brown University, in Rhode Island, it is a general language corpus containing 500 samples of English, totaling roughly one million words, compiled from works published in the United States in 1961. 

==History==
In 1967, Kučera and Francis published their classic work, entitled &quot;Computational Analysis of Present-Day American English&quot;, which provided basic statistics on what is known today simply as the &quot;Brown Corpus&quot;.

The Brown Corpus was a carefully compiled selection of current American English, totalling about a million words drawn from a wide variety of sources. Kučera and Francis subjected it to a variety of computational analyses, from which they compiled a rich and variegated opus, combining elements of linguistics, psychology, statistics, and sociology. It has been very widely used in computational linguistics, and was for many years among the most-cited resources in the field.

Shortly after publication of the first lexicostatistical analysis, Boston publisher Houghton-Mifflin approached Kučera to supply a million word, three-line citation base for its new &quot;American Heritage Dictionary&quot;. This ground-breaking new dictionary, which first appeared in 1969, was the first dictionary to be compiled using corpus linguistics for word frequency and other information.

The initial Brown Corpus had only the words themselves, plus a location identifier for each. Over the following several years part-of-speech tags were applied. The Greene and Rubin tagging program (see under part of speech tagging) helped considerably in this, but the high error rate meant that extensive manual proofreading was required.

The tagged Brown Corpus used a selection of about 80 parts of speech, as well as special indicators for compound forms, contractions, foreign words and a few other phenomena, and formed the model for many later corpora such as the Lancaster-Oslo-Bergen Corpus (British English from the early 1990s) and the Freiburg-Brown Corpus of American English (FROWN) (American English from the early 1990s). Tagging the corpus enabled far more sophisticated statistical analysis, such as the work programmed by Andrew Mackie, and documented in books on English grammar.

One interesting result is that even for quite large samples, graphing words in order of decreasing frequency of occurrence shows a hyperbola: the frequency of the &quot;n&quot;-th most frequent word is roughly proportional to 1/&quot;n&quot;. Thus &quot;the&quot; constitutes nearly 7% of the Brown Corpus, &quot;to&quot; and &quot;of&quot; more than another 3% each; while about half the total vocabulary of about 50,000 words are &quot;hapax legomena&quot;: words that occur only once in the corpus. This simple rank-vs.-frequency relationship was noted for an extraordinary variety of phenomena by George Kingsley Zipf (for example, see his &quot;The Psychobiology of Language&quot;), and is known as Zipf&#x27;s law.

Although the Brown Corpus pioneered the field of corpus linguistics, by now typical corpora (such as the Corpus of Contemporary American English, the British National Corpus or the International Corpus of English) tend to be much larger, on the order of 100 million words.

== Sample distribution ==

The Corpus consists of 500 samples, distributed across 15 genres in rough proportion to the amount published in 1961 in each of those genres. All works sampled were published in 1961; as far as could be determined they were &quot;first&quot; published then, and were written by native speakers of American English.

Each sample began at a random sentence-boundary in the article or other unit chosen, and continued up to the first sentence boundary after 2,000 words. In a very few cases miscounts led to samples being just under 2,000 words.

The original data entry was done on upper-case only keypunch machines; capitals were indicated by a preceding asterisk, and various special items such as formulae also had special codes.

The corpus originally (1961) contained 1,014,312 words sampled from 15 text categories:

<text>Estaire is an unincorporated community in the Unorganized North Part of Sudbury District in Northeastern Ontario, Canada. It is located in geographic Burwash Township, approximately south of the southern city limits of Greater Sudbury.

Estaire was formerly located directly along the route of Highway 69, but has been bypassed by a freeway, part of the extension of Ontario Highway 400, since November 13, 2009. The former alignment of Highway 69 extending southerly from Sudbury now has the street name Estaire Road, and the community&#x27;s access to the freeway is by way of an interchange at Nelson Road. The opening of the new freeway reduced the number of highway travellers passing through the village, resulting in the closure of various local gas stations and restaurants due to decreased business.

The community has a modest residential population, but is primarily a recreational cottage country community. The nearby Lake Nepewassi is one of the region&#x27;s most popular recreational lakes.

<text>John O&#x27;Toole (born ) is a retired politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1995 to 2014, representing the riding of Durham for the Progressive Conservative Party.

==Background==
O&#x27;Toole is the son of Ruth Annabel (Driscoll) and Claire Michael O&#x27;Toole. His ancestors arrived in Canada in 1845, fleeing the Great Famine of Ireland. He was born in Peterborough, Ontario, and has a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Toronto. After graduation he worked in upper management for General Motors of Canada in Ontario and Quebec. With his English-born late wife, Molly (Hall), his son is politician Erin O&#x27;Toole, former leader of the Conservative Party, who was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in a by-election on November 26, 2012, to represent the federal riding of Durham.

==Politics==
O&#x27;Toole was elected as a school trustee in the Peterborough-Victoria-Northumberland district in 1982, and in the Newcastle district in 1988. In 1991, O&#x27;Toole was elected as a municipal councillor in Bowmanville, Ontario, and in 1994, he was elected as councillor for Durham Region.

O&#x27;Toole scored a significant victory over incumbent New Democrat Gord Mills in the provincial election of 1995, scoring 62 per cent of the popular vote. He was re-elected in the 1999 election, again without difficulty. He was appointed as parliamentary assistant to several ministers including Consumer and Commercial Relations, Finance, and Health and Long-Term Care.

The Progressive Conservatives were defeated in the 2003 provincial election, although O&#x27;Toole managed to retain his own riding. In 2004, O&#x27;Toole endorsed John Tory&#x27;s successful bid to lead the Progressive Conservative party (even though his riding is adjacent to that of Tory&#x27;s main rival, Jim Flaherty).

In February 2014, O&#x27;Toole announced that he would not run for re-election.

In September 2014, O&#x27;Toole announced his intentions to run for mayor of Clarington in the 2014 municipal election. He officially filed his papers just before the deadline on September 2, 2014. On October 27, he was defeated by incumbent mayor Adrian Foster by 1,362 votes.

===Middle-finger incident===
On May 12, 2003, O&#x27;Toole was caught on camera in the Ontario Legislature making a middle-finger gesture at NDP House Leader Peter Kormos. He initially denied what he did to media, only to apologize minutes later after he learned it was caught on the legislature video broadcast feed.

<doc id="1156289" wikidata="Q311935" url="?curid=1156289" title="Artificial turf">
<text>Artificial turf is a surface of synthetic fibers made to look like natural grass, used in sports arenas, residential lawns and commercial applications that traditionally use grass. It is much more durable than grass and easily maintained without irrigation or trimming, although periodic cleaning is required. Stadiums that are substantially covered and/or at high latitudes often use artificial turf, as they typically lack enough sunlight for photosynthesis and substitutes for solar radiation are prohibitively expensive and energy-intensive. Disadvantages include increased risk of injury especially when used in athletic competition, as well as health and environmental concerns about the petroleum and toxic chemicals used in its manufacture.

Artificial turf first gained substantial attention in 1966, when ChemGrass was installed in the year-old Astrodome, developed by Monsanto and rebranded as AstroTurf, now a generic trademark (registered to a new owner) for any artificial turf.

The first-generation system of shortpile fibers without infill of the 1960s has largely been replaced by two more. The second features longer fibers and sand infill and the third adds recycled crumb rubber to the sand. Compared to earlier systems, modern artificial turf more closely resembles grass in appearance and is also considered safer for athletic competition. However, it is still not widely considered to be equal to grass. Sports clubs, leagues, unions and individual athletes have frequently spoken out and campaigned against it, while local governments have enacted and enforced laws restricting and/or banning its use.

==History==
David Chaney, who moved to Raleigh, North Carolina, in 1960 and later served as Dean of the North Carolina State University College of Textiles, headed the team of Research Triangle Park researchers who created the first notable artificial turf. That accomplishment led &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; to declare Chaney as the man &quot;responsible for indoor major league baseball and millions of welcome mats.&quot;

Artificial turf was first installed in 1964 on a recreation area at the Moses Brown School in Providence, Rhode Island. The material came to public prominence in 1966, when AstroTurf was installed in the Astrodome in Houston, Texas. The state-of-the-art indoor stadium had attempted to use natural grass during its initial season in 1965, but this failed miserably and the field conditions were grossly inadequate during the second half of the season, with the dead grass painted green. Due to a limited supply of the new artificial grass, only the infield was installed before the Houston Astros&#x27; home opener in April 1966; the outfield was installed in early summer during an extended Astros road trip and first used after the All-Star Break in July.

The use of AstroTurf and similar surfaces became widespread in the U.S. and Canada in the early 1970s, installed in both indoor and outdoor stadiums used for baseball and football. More than 11,000 artificial turf playing fields have been installed nationally. More than 1,200 were installed in the U.S. in 2013 alone, according to the industry group the Synthetic Turf Council.

==Sports applications==

===Baseball===
Artificial turf was first used in Major League Baseball in the Houston Astrodome in 1966, replacing the grass field used when the stadium opened a year earlier. Even though the grass was specifically bred for indoor use, the dome&#x27;s semi-transparent Lucite ceiling panels, which had been painted white to cut down on glare that bothered the players, did not pass enough sunlight to support the grass. For most of the 1965 season, the Astros played on green-painted dirt and dead grass.

The solution was to install a new type of artificial grass on the field, ChemGrass, which became known as AstroTurf. Given its early use, the term &quot;astroturf&quot; has since been genericized as a term for any artificial turf. Because the supply of AstroTurf was still low, only a limited amount was available for the first home game. There was not enough for the entire outfield, but there was enough to cover the traditional grass portion of the infield. The outfield remained painted dirt until after the All-Star Break. The team was sent on an extended road trip before the break, and on 19 July 1966, the installation of the outfield portion of AstroTurf was completed.

The Chicago White Sox became the first team to install artificial turf in an outdoor stadium, as they used it only in the infield and adjacent foul territory at Comiskey Park from 1969 through 1975. Artificial turf was later installed in other new multi-purpose stadiums such as Pittsburgh&#x27;s Three Rivers Stadium, Philadelphia&#x27;s Veterans Stadium, and Cincinnati&#x27;s Riverfront Stadium. Early AstroTurf baseball fields used the traditional all-dirt path, but starting in 1970 with Cincinnati&#x27;s Riverfront Stadium, teams began using the &quot;base cutout&quot; layout on the diamond, with the only dirt being on the pitcher&#x27;s mound, batter&#x27;s circle, and in a five-sided diamond-shaped &quot;sliding box&quot; around each base. With this layout, a painted arc would indicate where the edge of the outfield grass would normally be, to assist fielders in positioning themselves properly. The last stadium in MLB to use this configuration was Rogers Centre in Toronto, when they switched to an all-dirt infield (but keeping the artificial turf) for the 2016 season.
The biggest difference in play on artificial turf was that the ball bounced higher than on real grass and also traveled faster, causing infielders to play farther back than they would normally so that they would have sufficient time to react. The ball also had a truer bounce than on grass so that on long throws fielders could deliberately bounce the ball in front of the player they were throwing to, with the certainty that it would travel in a straight line and not be deflected to the right or left. The biggest impact on the game of &quot;turf&quot;, as it came to be called, was on the bodies of the players. The artificial surface, which was generally placed over a concrete base, had much less give to it than a traditional dirt and grass field did, which caused more wear-and-tear on knees, ankles, feet, and the lower back, possibly even shortening the careers of those players who played a significant portion of their games on artificial surfaces. Players also complained that the turf was much hotter than grass, sometimes causing the metal spikes to burn their feet or plastic ones to melt. These factors eventually provoked a number of stadiums, such as the Kansas City Royals&#x27; Kauffman Stadium, to switch from artificial turf back to natural grass.

In 2000, St. Petersburg&#x27;s Tropicana Field became the first MLB field to use a third-generation artificial surface, FieldTurf. All other remaining artificial turf stadiums were either converted to third-generation surfaces or were replaced entirely by new natural grass stadiums. In a span of 13 years, between 1992 and 2005, the National League went from having half of its teams using artificial turf to all of them playing on natural grass. With the replacement of Minneapolis&#x27;s Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome by Target Field in 2010, only two MLB stadiums used artificial turf from 2010 through 2018: Tropicana Field and Toronto&#x27;s Rogers Centre. This number grew to three when the Arizona Diamondbacks switched Chase Field to artificial turf for the 2019 season; the stadium had grass from its opening in 1998 until 2018, but the difficulty of maintaining the grass in the stadium, which has a retractable roof and is located in a desert city, was cited as the reason for the switch. In 2020, Miami&#x27;s Marlins Park (now loanDepot Park) also switched to artificial turf for similar reasons, while the Texas Rangers&#x27; new Globe Life Field was opened with an artificial surface, as it is also a retractable roof ballpark in a hot weather city; this puts the number of teams using synthetic turf in MLB at five as of 2023.

===American football===
The first professional American football team to play on artificial turf was the Houston Oilers, then part of the American Football League, who moved into the Astrodome in 1968, which had installed AstroTurf two years prior. In 1969, the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Franklin Field in Philadelphia, at the time also home field of the Philadelphia Eagles, switched from grass to AstroTurf, making it the first National Football League stadium to use artificial turf.

In 2002, CenturyLink Field, originally planned to have a natural grass field, was instead surfaced with FieldTurf upon positive reaction from the Seattle Seahawks when they played on the surface at their temporary home of Husky Stadium during the 2000 and 2001 seasons. This would be the first of a leaguewide trend taking place over the next several seasons that would not only result in teams already using artificial surfaces for their fields switching to the new FieldTurf or other similar surfaces but would also see several teams playing on grass adopt a new surface. (The Indianapolis Colts&#x27; RCA Dome and the St. Louis Rams&#x27; Edward Jones Dome were the last two stadiums in the NFL to replace their first-generation AstroTurf surfaces for next-generation ones after the 2004 season). For example, after a three-year experiment with a natural surface, Giants Stadium went to FieldTurf for 2003, while M&amp;T Bank Stadium added its own artificial surface the same year (it has since been removed and replaced with a natural surface, which the stadium had before installing the turf). Later examples include Paul Brown Stadium (now Paycor Stadium), which went from grass to turf in 2004; Gillette Stadium, which made the switch in 2006; and NRG Stadium, which did so in 2015. As of 2021, 14 NFL fields out of 30 are artificial.
NFL players overwhelmingly prefer natural grass over synthetic surfaces, according to a league survey conducted in 2010. When asked, &quot;Which surface do you think is more likely to shorten your career?&quot;, 90% responded artificial turf. When players were asked &quot;Is the Turf versus Grass debate overblown or a real concern&quot; in an anonymous player survey, 83% believe it is a real concern while 12.3% believe it is overblown.

Following receiver Odell Beckham Jr.&#x27;s injury during Super Bowl LVI, other NFL players started calling for turf to be banned since the site of the game, SoFi Stadium, was a turf field.

Arena football is played indoors on the older short-pile artificial turf.

===Canadian football===
The first professional Canadian football stadium to use artificial turf was Empire Stadium in Vancouver, British Columbia, then home of the Canadian Football League&#x27;s BC Lions, which installed 3M TartanTurf in 1970. Today, eight of the nine stadiums in the CFL currently use artificial turf, largely because of the harsh weather conditions in the latter-half of the season. The only one that does not is BMO Field in Toronto, which initially had an artificial pitch and has been shared by the CFL&#x27;s Toronto Argonauts since 2016 (part of the endzones at that stadium are covered with artificial turf). The first stadium to use the next-generation surface was Ottawa&#x27;s Frank Clair Stadium (now TD Place Stadium), which the Ottawa Renegades used when they began play in 2002. The Saskatchewan Roughriders&#x27; Taylor Field was the only major professional sports venue in North America to use a second-generation artificial playing surface, Omniturf, which was used from 1988 to 2000, followed by AstroTurf from 2000 to 2007 and FieldTurf from 2007 to its 2016 closure.

===Cricket===
Some cricket pitches are made of synthetic grass or of a hybrid of mostly natural and some artificial grass, with these &quot;hybrid pitches&quot; having been implemented across several parts of the United Kingdom and Australia. The first synthetic turf cricket field in the USA was opened in Fremont, California in 2016.

===Field hockey===
The introduction of synthetic surfaces has significantly changed the sport of field hockey. Since being introduced in the 1970s, competitions in western countries are now mostly played on artificial surfaces. This has increased the speed of the game considerably and changed the shape of hockey sticks to allow for different techniques, such as reverse stick trapping and hitting.

Field hockey artificial turf differs from artificial turf for other sports, in that it does not try to reproduce a grass feel, being made of shorter fibers. This allows the improvement in speed brought by earlier artificial turfs to be retained. This development is problematic for areas which cannot afford to build an extra artificial field for hockey alone. The International Hockey Federation and manufacturers are driving research in order to produce new fields that will be suitable for a variety of sports.

The use of artificial turf in conjunction with changes in the game&#x27;s rules (e.g., the removal of offside, introduction of rolling substitutes and the self-pass, and to the interpretation of obstruction) have contributed significantly to change the nature of the game, greatly increasing the speed and intensity of play as well as placing far greater demands on the conditioning of the players.

===Association football===
Some association football clubs in Europe installed synthetic surfaces in the 1980s, which were called &quot;plastic pitches&quot; (often derisively) in countries such as England. There, four professional club venues had adopted them; Queens Park Rangers&#x27;s Loftus Road (1981–1988), Luton Town&#x27;s Kenilworth Road (1985–1991), Oldham Athletic&#x27;s Boundary Park (1986–1991) and Preston North End&#x27;s Deepdale (1986–1994). QPR had been the first team to install an artificial pitch at their stadium in 1981, but were the first to remove it when they did so in 1988. Artificial pitches were banned from top-flight (then First Division) football in 1991, forcing Oldham Athletic to remove their artificial pitch after their promotion to the First Division in 1991, while then top-flight Luton Town also removed their artificial pitch at the same time. The last Football League team to have an artificial pitch in England was Preston North End, who removed their pitch in 1994 after eight years in use. Artificial pitches were banned from the top four divisions from 1995.

Artificial turf gained a bad reputation globally, with fans and especially with players. The first-generation artificial turf surfaces were carpet-like in their look and feel, and thus, a far harder surface than grass and soon became known as an unforgiving playing surface that was prone to cause more injuries, and in particular, more serious joint injuries, than would comparatively be suffered on a grass surface. This turf was also regarded as aesthetically unappealing to many fans.

In 1981, London football club Queens Park Rangers dug up its grass pitch and installed an artificial one. Others followed, and by the mid-1980s there were four artificial surfaces in operation in the English league. They soon became a national joke: the ball pinged round like it was made of rubber, the players kept losing their footing, and anyone who fell over risked carpet burns. Unsurprisingly, fans complained that the football was awful to watch and, one by one, the clubs returned to natural grass.

In the 1990s, many North American soccer clubs also removed their artificial surfaces and re-installed grass, while others moved to new stadiums with state-of-the-art grass surfaces that were designed to withstand cold temperatures where the climate demanded it. The use of artificial turf was later banned by FIFA, UEFA and by many domestic football associations, though, in recent years, both governing bodies have expressed resurrected interest in the use of artificial surfaces in competition, provided that they are FIFA Recommended. UEFA has now been heavily involved in programs to test artificial turf, with tests made in several grounds meeting with FIFA approval. A team of UEFA, FIFA and German company Polytan conducted tests in the Stadion Salzburg Wals-Siezenheim in Salzburg, Austria which had matches played on it in UEFA Euro 2008. It is the second FIFA 2 Star approved artificial turf in a European domestic top flight, after Dutch club Heracles Almelo received the FIFA certificate in August 2005. The tests were approved.

FIFA originally launched its FIFA Quality Concept in February 2001. UEFA announced that starting from the 2005–06 season, approved artificial surfaces were to be permitted in their competitions.

A full international fixture for the 2008 European Championships was played on 17 October 2007 between England and Russia on an artificial surface, which was installed to counteract adverse weather conditions, at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow. It was one of the first full international games to be played on such a surface approved by FIFA and UEFA. The latter ordered the 2008 European Champions League final hosted in the same stadium in May 2008 to place on grass, so a temporary natural grass field was installed just for the final.

UEFA stressed that artificial turf should only be considered an option where climatic conditions necessitate. One Desso &quot;hybrid grass&quot; product incorporates both natural grass and artificial elements.

In June 2009, following a match played at Estadio Ricardo Saprissa in Costa Rica, American national team manager Bob Bradley called on FIFA to &quot;have some courage&quot; and ban artificial surfaces.
FIFA designated a star system for artificial turf fields that have undergone a series of tests that examine quality and performance based on a two star system. Recommended two-star fields may be used for FIFA Final Round Competitions as well as for UEFA Europa League and Champions League matches. There are currently 130 FIFA Recommended 2-Star installations in the world.

In 2009, FIFA launched the Preferred Producer Initiative to improve the quality of artificial football turf at each stage of the life cycle (manufacturing, installation and maintenance). Currently, there are five manufacturers that were selected by FIFA: Act Global, Limonta, Desso, GreenFields, and Edel Grass. These firms have made quality guarantees directly to FIFA and have agreed to increased research and development.

In 2010, Estadio Omnilife with an artificial turf opened in Guadalajara to be the new home of Chivas, one of the most popular teams in Mexico. The owner of Chivas, Jorge Vergara, defended the reasoning behind using artificial turf because the stadium was designed to be &quot;environment friendly and as such, having grass would result [in] using too much water.&quot; Some players criticized the field, saying its harder surface caused many injuries. When Johan Cruyff became the adviser of the team, he recommended the switch to natural grass, which the team did in 2012.

In November 2011, it was reported that a number of English football clubs were interested in using artificial pitches again on economic grounds. As of January 2020, artificial pitches are not permitted in the Premier League or Football League but are permitted in the National League and lower divisions. Bromley are an example of an English football club who currently use a third-generation artificial pitch. In 2018, Sutton United were close to achieving promotion to the Football League and the debate in England about artificial pitches resurfaced again. It was reported that, if Sutton won promotion, they would subsequently be demoted two leagues if they refused to replace their pitch with natural grass. After Harrogate Town&#x27;s promotion to the Football League in 2020, the club was obliged to install a natural grass pitch at Wetherby Road; and after winning promotion in 2021 Sutton Utd were also obliged to tear up their artificial pitch and replace it with grass, at a cost of more than £500,000. Artificial pitches are permitted in all rounds of the FA Cup competition.

The 2015 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup took place entirely on artificial surfaces, as the event was played in Canada, where almost all of the country&#x27;s stadiums use artificial turf due to climate issues. This plan garnered criticism from players and fans, some believing the artificial surfaces make players more susceptible to injuries. Over fifty of the female athletes protested against the use of artificial turf on the basis of gender discrimination. Australia winger Caitlin Foord said that after playing 90 minutes there was no difference to her post-match recovery – a view shared by the rest of the squad. The squad spent much time preparing on the surface and had no problems with its use in Winnipeg. &quot;We&#x27;ve been training on [artificial] turf pretty much all year so I think we&#x27;re kind of used to it in that way ... I think grass or turf you can still pull up sore after a game so it&#x27;s definitely about getting the recovery in and getting it right&quot;, Foord said. A lawsuit was filed on 1 October 2014 in an Ontario tribunal court by a group of women&#x27;s international soccer players against FIFA and the Canadian Soccer Association and specifically points out that in 1994 FIFA spent $2 million to plant natural grass over artificial turf in New Jersey and Detroit. Various celebrities showed their support for the women soccer players in defense of their lawsuit, including actor Tom Hanks, NBA player Kobe Bryant and U.S. men&#x27;s soccer team keeper Tim Howard. Even with the possibility of boycotts, FIFA&#x27;s head of women&#x27;s competitions, Tatjana Haenni, made it clear that &quot;we play on artificial turf and there&#x27;s no Plan B.&quot;

The first stadium to use artificial turf in Brazil was Atlético Paranaense&#x27;s Arena da Baixada in 2016. In 2020, the administration of Allianz Parque, home of Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras, started the implementation of the second artificial pitch in the country.

===Rugby union===
Rugby union also uses artificial surfaces at a professional level. Infill fields are used by English Premiership Rugby teams Gloucester, Newcastle Falcons, Saracens F.C. and the now defunct Worcester Warriors, as well as United Rugby Championship teams Cardiff, Edinburgh and Glasgow Warriors. Some fields, including Twickenham Stadium, have incorporated a hybrid field, with grass and synthetic fibers used on the surface. This allows for the field to be much more hard wearing, making it less susceptible to weather conditions and frequent use.

===Tennis===
Carpet has been used as a surface for indoor tennis courts for decades, though the first carpets used were more similar to home carpets than a synthetic grass. After the introduction of AstroTurf, it came to be used for tennis courts, both indoor and outdoor, though only a small minority of courts use the surface. Both infill and non-infill versions are used, and are typically considered medium-fast to fast surfaces under the International Tennis Federation&#x27;s classification scheme. A distinct form found in tennis is an &quot;artificial clay&quot; surface, which seeks to simulate a clay court by using a very short pile carpet with an infill of the same loose aggregate used for clay courts that rises above the carpet fibers.

Tennis courts such as Wimbledon are considering using an artificial hybrid grass to replace their natural lawn courts. Such systems incorporate synthetic fibers into natural grass to create a more durable surface on which to play. Such hybrid surfaces are currently used for some association football stadiums, including Wembley Stadium.

===Golf===

Synthetic turf can also be used in the golf industry, such as on driving ranges, putting greens and even in some circumstances tee boxes. For low budget courses, particularly those catering to casual golfers, synthetic putting greens offer the advantage of being a relatively cheap alternative to installing and maintaining grass greens, but are much more similar to real grass in appearance and feel compared to sand greens which are the traditional alternative surface. Because of the vast areas of golf courses and the damage from clubs during shots, it is not feasible to surface fairways with artificial turf.

===Motor racing===
Artificial grass is used to line the perimeter of some sections of some motor circuits, and offers less grip than some other surfaces. It can pose an obstacle to drivers if it gets caught on their car.

==Other applications==

===Landscaping===

Since the early 1990s, the use of synthetic grass in the more arid western states of the United States has moved beyond athletic fields to residential and commercial landscaping. New water saving programs, as of 2019, which grant rebates for turf removal, do not accept artificial turf as replacement and require a minimum of plants.

The use of artificial grass for convenience sometimes faces opposition: Legislation frequently seeks to preserve natural gardens and fully water permeable surfaces, therefore restricting the use of hardscape and plantless areas, including artificial turf. In several locations in different countries, homeowners have been fined, ordered to remove artificial turf and/or had to defend themselves in courts. Many of these restrictions can be found in local bylaws and ordinances. These not always applied in a consistent manner, especially in municipalities that utilize a complaint-based model for enforcing local laws.

Sunlight reflections from nearby windows can cause artificial turf to melt. This can be avoided by adding perforated vinyl privacy window film adhesive to the outside of the window causing the reflection.

===Airports===
Artificial turf has been used at airports. Here it provides several advantages over natural turf – it does not support wildlife, it has high visual contrast with runways in all seasons, it reduces foreign object damage (FOD) since the surface has no rocks or clumps, and it drains well.

Some artificial turf systems allow for the integration of fiber-optic fibers into the turf. This would allow for runway lighting to be embedded in artificial landing surfaces for aircraft (or lighting or advertisements to be directly embedded in a playing surface).

===Tanks for octopuses===
Artificial turf is commonly used for tanks containing octopusses, in particular the Giant Pacific octopus since it is a reliable way to prevent the octopusses from escaping their tank, as they prevent the suction cups on the tentacles from getting a tight seal.

==Environmental and safety concerns==

=== Environmental footprint ===
The first major academic review of the environmental and health risks and benefits of artificial turf was published in 2014; it was followed by extensive research on possible risks to human health, but holistic analyses of the environmental footprint of artificial turf compared with natural turf only began to emerge in the 2020s, and frameworks to support informed policymaking were still lacking. Evaluating the relative environmental footprints of natural and artificial turf is complex, with outcomes depending on a wide range of factors, including (to give the example of a sports field):

* what ecosystem services are lost by converting a site to a sports pitch
* how resource-intensive is the landscaping work and transport of materials to create a pitch
* whether input materials are recycled and whether these are recycled again at the end of the pitch&#x27;s life
* how resource-intensive and damaging maintenance is (whether through water, fertiliser, weed-killer, reapplication of rubber crumb, snow-clearing, etc.)
* how intensively the facility is used, for how long, and whether surface type can reduce the overall number of pitches required

Artificial turf has been shown to contribute to global warming by absorbing significantly more radiation than living turf and, to a lesser extent, by displacing living plants that could sequester carbon dioxide through photosynthesis; a study at New Mexico State University found that in that environment, water-cooling of artificial turf can demand as much water as natural turf. However, a 2022 study that used real-world data to model a ten-year-life-cycle environmental footprint for a new natural-turf soccer field compared with an artificial-turf field found that the natural-turf field contributed twice as much to global warming as the artificial one (largely due to a more resource-intensive construction phase), while finding that the artificial turf would likely cause more pollution of other kinds. It promoted improvements to usual practice such as the substitution of cork for rubber in artificial pitches and more drought-resistant grasses and electric mowing in natural ones. In 2021, a Zurich University of Applied Sciences study for the city of Zurich, using local data on extant pitches, found that, per hour of use, natural turf had the lowest environmental footprint, followed by artificial turf with no infill, and then artificial turf using an infill (e.g. granulated rubber). However, because it could tolerate more hours of use, unfilled artificial turf often had the lowest environmental footprint in practice, by reducing the total number of pitches required. The study recommended optimising the use of existing pitches before building new ones, and choosing the best surface for the likely intensity of use. Another suggestion is the introduction of green roofs to offset the conversion of grassland to artificial turf.

=== Maintenance ===
Contrary to popular belief, artificial turf is not maintenance free. It requires regular maintenance, such as raking and patching, to keep it functional and safe.

===Pollution and associated health risks===

Some artificial turf uses infill such as silicon sand, but most uses granulated rubber, referred to as &quot;crumb rubber&quot;. Granulated rubber can be made from recycled car tires and may carry heavy metals, PFAS chemicals, and other chemicals of environmental concern. The synthetic fibers of artificial turf are also subject to degradation. Thus chemicals from artificial turfs leach into the environment, and artificial turf is a source of microplastics pollution and rubber pollution in air, fresh-water, sea and soil environments. In Norway, Sweden, and at least some other places, the rubber granulate from artificial turf infill constitutes the second largest source of microplastics in the environment after the tire and road wear particles that make up a large portion of the fine road debris. As early as 2007, Environment and Human Health, Inc., a lobby-group, proposed a moratorium on the use of ground-up rubber tires in fields and playgrounds based on health concerns; in September 2022, the European Commission made a draft proposal to restrict the use of microplastic granules as infill in sports fields.

What is less clear is how likely this pollution is in practice to harm humans or other organisms and whether these environmental costs outweigh the benefits of artificial turf, with many scientific papers and government agencies (such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency) calling for more research. A 2018 study published in &quot;Water, Air, &amp; Soil Pollution&quot; analyzed the chemicals found in samples of tire crumbs, some used to install school athletic fields, and identified 92 chemicals only about half of which had ever been studied for their health effects and some of which are known to be carcinogenic or irritants. It stated &quot;caution would argue against use of these materials where human exposure is likely, and this is especially true for playgrounds and athletic playing fields where young people may be affected&quot;. Conversely, a 2017 study in &quot;Sports Medicine&quot; argued that &quot;regular physical activity during adolescence and early adulthood helps prevent cancer later in life. Restricting the use or availability of all-weather year-round synthetic fields and thereby potentially reducing exercise could, in the long run, actually increase cancer incidence, as well as cardiovascular disease and other chronic illnesses.&quot;

The possibility that carcinogenic substances in artificial turf could increase risks of human cancer (the artificial turf–cancer hypothesis) gained a particularly high profile in the first decades of the twenty-first century and attracted extensive study, with scientific reports around 2020 finding cancer-risks in modern artificial turf negligible. But concerns have extended to other human-health risks, such as endocrine disruption that might affect early puberty, obesity, and children&#x27;s attention spans. Potential harm to fish and earthworm populations has also been shown.

A study for the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection analyzed lead and other metals in dust kicked into the air by physical activity on five artificial turf fields. The results suggest that even low levels of activity on the field can cause particulate matter containing these chemicals to get into the air where it can be inhaled and be harmful. The authors state that since no level of lead exposure is considered safe for children, &quot;only a comprehensive mandated testing of fields can provide assurance that no health hazard on these fields exists from lead or other metals used in their construction and maintenance.&quot;

===Kinesiological health risks===
A number of health and safety concerns have been raised about artificial turf. Friction between skin and older generations of artificial turf can cause abrasions and/or burns to a much greater extent than natural grass. Artificial turf tends to retain heat from the sun and can be much hotter than natural grass with prolonged exposure to the sun.

There is some evidence that periodic disinfection of artificial turf is required as pathogens are not broken down by natural processes in the same manner as natural grass. Despite this, a 2006 study suggests certain microbial life is less active in artificial turf.

There is evidence showing higher rates of player injury on artificial turf. By November 1971, the injury toll on first-generation artificial turf had reached a threshold that resulted in congressional hearings by the House subcommittee on commerce and finance. In a study performed by the National Football League Injury and Safety Panel, published in the October 2012 issue of the &quot;American Journal of Sports Medicine&quot;, Elliott B. Hershman et al. reviewed injury data from NFL games played between 2000 and 2009, finding that &quot;the injury rate of knee sprains as a whole was 22% higher on FieldTurf than on natural grass. While MCL sprains did not occur at a rate significantly higher than on grass, rates of ACL sprains were 67% higher on FieldTurf.&quot; Metatarsophalangeal joint sprain, known as &quot;turf toe&quot; when the big toe is involved, is named from the injury being associated with playing sports on rigid surfaces such as artificial turf and is a fairly common injury among professional American football players. Artificial turf is a harder surface than grass and does not have much &quot;give&quot; when forces are placed on it.

<text>Bradley William Butterworth (born 1959) is a New Zealand yachtsman known for the role he played as tactician and skipper in the America&#x27;s Cup for Team New Zealand and the Alinghi team of Switzerland.

Butterworth was born in Te Awamutu, New Zealand, in 1959. He has been sailing since age six.

Butterworth has sailed and been successful in many international sailing competitions, including the Admiral&#x27;s Cup, the Kenwood Cup, the Sydney to Hobart Race, the Fastnet Race, the Whitbread Round The World Race and the America&#x27;s Cup.

1987 was a busy year as he was the skipper of the top-ranked Admiral&#x27;s Cup boat Propaganda when New Zealand won the Admiral&#x27;s Cup in England.

He was also a watch captain on &quot;Steinlager II&quot; with Peter Blake when she won the 1989–90 Whitbread Round The World Race and skipper of a Whitbread 60 (later Volvo Ocean 60) class boat in the 1993/1994 race where he was associated with Dennis Conner and Tom Whidden.

In the 1995 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Butterworth was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for services to yachting.

After the successful defense of the America&#x27;s Cup in Auckland in 2000 the then skipper, Russell Coutts, tactician Butterworth and several other members of the New Zealand team moved to the Alinghi team. They then won the America&#x27;s Cup in 2003, beating Team New Zealand 5–0 in waters near Auckland. He was inducted into the America&#x27;s Cup Hall of Fame in 2004. After Russell Coutts left Alinghi in March 2005, Butterworth became skipper himself and went on to win the 2007 America&#x27;s Cup in Valencia, again beating Team New Zealand, this time 5–2.

In October 2009, Butterworth published an open letter commenting on the extensive litigation concerning the 33rd America&#x27;s Cup. According to him, winning the America&#x27;s Cup is akin to climbing the K2 mountain: something that only the top sportsmen in their field can achieve. He says: &quot;Great sportsmen seek victory on the field of play, or in our sport; on the high seas. A sportsman seeking to win through the courts or through what Dennis called the &#x27;backdoor&#x27; only demeans themselves as sportsmen and taints any victory, as well as the sport. Having challenged for and defended the America’s Cup successfully, I have always found it has been won by designing and building the fastest boat and sailing with the best team. It is hard to win, as it should be for such a trophy. Reducing the challenge might make the conquest easier, but gone is the attraction and achievement.&quot;

Butterworth was the skipper for the defending team Alinghi in the 2010 America&#x27;s Cup. His yacht Alinghi 5 lost to the challenging yacht USA 17 by a considerable margin. Most observers stated that USA 17&#x27;s rigid wing sail had given it a decisive advantage.

Butterworth led a campaign on NUMBERS, a 66-foot race boat designed by Alinghi Head of Design Team, Rolf Vrolijk and owned by American Daniel Meyers in 2007 and 2008 that resulted in winning; the maxi boat world championship in Sardinia, Cork Race Week in Ireland, and in the US, the New York Yacht Club annual regatta, the Palm Beach Race, the Lambert Ocean Race and the Palm Beach Race, Key West Race Week.

<text>The Warburg Institute is a research institution associated with the University of London in central London, England. A member of the School of Advanced Study, its focus is the study of cultural history and the role of images in culture – cross-disciplinary and global. It is concerned with the histories of art and science, and their relationship with superstition, magic, and popular beliefs.

The researches of the Warburg Institute are historical, philological and anthropological. It is dedicated to the study of the survival and transmission of cultural forms – whether in literature, art, music or science – across borders and from the earliest times to the present including especially the study of the influence of classical antiquity on all aspects of European civilisation.

Based originally in Hamburg, Germany, in 1933 the collection was moved to London, where it became incorporated into the University of London in 1944. Following a major renovation from 2022 to 2024 the institute became open to public access.

==History==

===Hamburg===
The institute was formed in Hamburg, Germany, from the library of Aby Warburg (1866–1929), a student of Renaissance art and culture, and a scion of the wealthy Jewish Warburg family.

As an art historian, Warburg had become dissatisfied with an aestheticising approach to art history and was interested in a more philosophical and interdisciplinary approach. While studying the culture of Renaissance Florence, he grew interested in the influence of antiquity on modern culture, and the study of this second life of the Classical World became his life work.

In 1900, he decided to establish the Warburg-Bibliothek für Kulturwissenschaft (Warburg Library of the Science of Culture), but, although he had begun collecting books in 1886, he didn&#x27;t actually establish his library until 1909.

Warburg was joined in 1913 by the Vienna art historian Fritz Saxl (1890–1948). They discussed the possibility of converting the library into a research institute in 1914, but World War I and illness interfered. After Warburg returned to Hamburg in 1924, he and Saxl initiated the process of conversion, and the Warburg-Bibliothek officially opened its doors as a research institute in 1926.

Eventually, the privately funded library, built around the interdisciplinary approach, became extensive. Warburg &quot;famously forfeited his right to a share of his fortune on condition that his younger brother Max would buy him any books he required&quot;.

The institute was later affiliated with the University of Hamburg. Neo-Kantian philosopher and professor at the newly founded University Ernst Cassirer used it, and his students Erwin Panofsky and Edgar Wind worked there.

The original Warburg Library building in Hamburg is now a research institute, Warburg-Haus Hamburg.

===London===
In 1933, under the shadow of Nazism, the institute was relocated to London, where, with the aid of Lord Lee of Fareham, Samuel Courtauld, and the Warburg family, it was installed in Thames House in 1934. The institute moved to the Imperial Institute Buildings in 1937. In 1944 it became associated with the University of London.

Henri Frankfort succeeded Saxl as director in 1949, and in 1955 was succeeded by Gertrud Bing, who had joined the organisation in 1922. During her term as director, the institute moved to its current home at the university in 1958. Bing was succeeded by Ernst Gombrich in 1959. From 1976 to 1990, J. B. Trapp was director, and from 1991 to 2001, Nicholas Mann. In 1994 the Warburg became a founding institute of the University of London&#x27;s School of Advanced Study.

Recent directors have been Charles Hope (2001 to 2010), Peter Mack (2010 to 2014) and David Freedberg (from July 2015 to April 2017).

In 2011, legal action was started by the University of London together with the institute&#x27;s advisory council about their disagreement regarding the meaning of the 1944 deed of trust that granted the university the collection; the pledge &quot;to maintain and preserve the collection &#x27;in perpetuity&#x27; as &#x27;an independent unit&#x27;&quot; is problematised by the institute&#x27;s annual deficit, estimated at half a million pounds. Several students and scholars who had used the Warburg resources or studied there protested against this planned merge. A petition on Change.org to save the Warburg&#x27;s independence was started by Brooke Palmieri, a student of University College London after working on their PhD thesis at the Warburg. In only two months, the petition had almost twenty five thousand signatures. In recent years the university has charged a proportion of its total estate expenditure to the Warburg Institute; as a result, the finances of the once solvent Institute have been strongly affected. In November 2014, a High Court judgement established that the university&#x27;s conduct in this regard was not lawful.

==Building==

The institute occupies a large building on Woburn Square, in the University of London&#x27;s Bloomsbury campus in the central London Borough of Camden. Designed by Charles Holden and built in 1957, the building is adjacent to the University of London Student Union, Birkbeck College, School of Oriental and African Studies, and Christ the King Church. It is also the home of the studio of the Slade School of Fine Art, University College, London.

The Warburg Institute maintains a research library of more than 350,000 volumes. These volumes, except for a relatively small proportion of rare and valuable books, are kept on open shelves and are accessible to all. The library is notable for its unusual and unique reference system: the books are arranged by subject according to Warburg&#x27;s division of human history into the categories of Action, Orientation, Word, and Image. The institute also holds a large photographic collection of 450,000 photographs of paintings, sculptures, prints and drawings, arranged according to an iconographic system initiated by Rudolf Wittkower and Edgar Wind. The photographic collection also holds the valuable archive of the Image of the Black in Western Art. The institute&#x27;s archive contains the personal and working papers of Aby Warburg, together with the archives of Henri Frankfort, Ernst Gombrich and other Warburgian scholars.

In 2022 work began on a major renovation and redevelopment of the existing buildings, branded &quot;Warburg Renaissance&quot;. The project includes the creation of a new structure in the former courtyard, incorporating a lecture theatre and storage and study spaces for archives and special collections. The renovated building, which previously had restricted access, opened to the wider public in September 2024, featuring an exhibition focused on the history of the institute along with Edmund de Waal’s &quot;Library of Exile&quot;.

==Organisation==

In addition to its primary purpose as an academic reference library, the institute accepts a small number of graduate students each year. The institute awards the degrees of Master of Arts in Cultural and Intellectual History (1300–1650) and Master of Arts in Art History, Curatorship and Renaissance culture, Master of Philosophy and Doctor of Philosophy; the first and the second are one-year degrees with taught and research components, the MPhil is a two-year research degree which would usually be expected to lead onto a PhD with further study, and the last is a three-year research degree.

The emphasis of these programmes is on developing interpretative skills in a number of different academic subjects, which follows from the institute&#x27;s interdisciplinary mission. Considerable attention is devoted to improving language skills and knowledge of primary sources.

==Students and faculty==

Scholars associated with the Warburg Institute include Ernst Cassirer, Rudolf Wittkower, Otto Kurz, Henri Frankfort, Arnaldo Momigliano, Ernst Gombrich, Erwin Panofsky, Edgar Wind, Frances Yates, Enriqueta Harris, D. P. Walker, Michael Baxandall, Jennifer Montagu, Anthony Grafton, and Elizabeth McGrath. The current group of scholars continues the institute&#x27;s tradition of interdisciplinary research into history, philosophy, religion, and art. The permanent staff includes a number of academics and graduate students who hold short and long-term fellowships.

==&quot;Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes&quot;==

Together with the Courtauld Institute of Art, the Warburg Institute publishes &quot;The Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes&quot;, an annual publication of about 300 pages. It was originally established as the &quot;Journal of the Warburg Institute&quot; in 1937, but changed to its current name in 1939.

<text>The American Council on Science and Health (ACSH) is a pro-industry advocacy organization founded in 1978 by Elizabeth Whelan with support from the Scaife Foundation and John M. Olin Foundation. ACSH&#x27;s publications focus on industry advocacy related to food, nutrition, health, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, biology, biotechnology, infectious disease, and the environment. Its critics have accused it of being a front group for anti-science denialism.

==History==
The American Council on Science and Health (ACSH) was founded in 1978 by Elizabeth Whelan. In the 1970s, ACSH scientists, saying they were concerned with what they described as the lack of sound scientific basis, common sense, reason, and balance in public forums and public policy regarding such issues as health and the environment, began to produce their own policy statements. In 1981, ACSH decided to start taking some corporate funding, but not for specific projects or programs, only for general support. Over the years, their articles have included such topics as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), obesity, chemophobia, phthalates, DDT, fracking, e-cigarettes, GMOs, atrazine, and bisphenol A.

Whelan says she was motivated to found the American Council on Science and Health after doing research for the pharmaceutical company Pfizer about a section of the Food Additives Amendment of 1958 to ban certain chemicals from foods. With further research, she says she found that public discourse and public policy were chemophobic. Her first book, &quot;Panic in the Pantry&quot; (1976), challenged the notion, popular in the 1970s, that &quot;natural&quot; was better and that &quot;chemicals&quot; were dangerous.

In 1978, along with Frederick J. Stare, founder of the Harvard Nutrition Department, Whelan invited 50 other scientists to &quot;bring the message of sound science to consumers, via the media&quot; in a &quot;consumer education consortium&quot;. Their first financial support came from the Scaife Foundation and the John M. Olin Foundation. By 2003, almost 400 scientists had joined ACSH.

In September 2014, Whelan died. She was replaced by Hank Campbell in July 2015. Thom Golab became president in August 2019.

==Issue advocacy==
===Chemicals in the environment===
ACSH frequently advocates against &quot;regulating chemicals without scientific proof of harm.&quot; A 2009 editorial by board member Henry I. Miller in &quot;Investor&#x27;s Business Daily&quot; criticized the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)&#x27;s employment of the precautionary principle to regulate chemicals such as bisphenol-A, phthalates, flame retardants, the herbicide atrazine and fluorinated chemicals used to make Teflon, all of which he described as &quot;important&quot; and &quot;demonstrably safe.&quot;

In February 2009, the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act imposed regulations of several substances and banned the manufacture for sale, distribution in commerce, or import any children&#x27;s toy or childcare article that contains concentrations of more than 0.1 percent of di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), or benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP). Michael Kamrin, who was on ACSH&#x27;s Board of Scientific and Policy Advisors, published a critical review in 2009 in the &quot;Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health&quot;, saying that phthalates were &quot;safe.&quot; ACSH&#x27;s advocacy on the issue extends back to 1999, when it worked with former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop to advocate for the ingredient used in many soft plastics.

===Food safety and nutrition===
ACSH has advocated against taxation of foods known to contribute to weight gain as a means to combat obesity. The group opposed New York State&#x27;s move to require food chains to post calorie information on their products. ACSH has also called for better regulation and testing of dietary supplements.

In a 2009 interview by &quot;The Daily Show&quot; correspondent Samantha Bee, an ACSH spokesperson criticized the Obama&#x27;s family&#x27;s White House Vegetable Garden, calling the Obamas &quot;organic limousine liberals&quot; and calling their promotion of organic food a &quot;public health concern&quot; since not everyone could afford it and also claimed that organic farming would &quot;lead to famine&quot; and said Michelle Obama &quot;should use pesticides in the garden.&quot;

===Diseases and pharmaceuticals===
ACSH criticized Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz&#x27;s Breast Cancer Education and Awareness Requires Learning Young Act as focusing on detection methods that were &quot;not scientifically supported but distracting from more effective measures.&quot; The group worked to &quot;clarify&quot; &quot;unclear&quot; messages and dispel &quot;myths&quot; surrounding the swine flu outbreak in 2009. In 2008, ACSH applauded the American Academy of Pediatrics for demanding for an episode of &quot;Eli Stone&quot; to carry a disclaimer since the show depicted a jury awarding damages based on the claim that a vaccine caused autism. ACSH has long been critical of groups that falsely claim a link between the two.

Following the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001, ACSH opposed the appointment of a federal official to oversee and administer aid to those injured during the attacks and subsequent rescue; it argued that such a move would &quot;create another layer of bureaucracy between victims and aid.&quot; Also, the group criticized rescue workers who attempted to &quot;fraudulently receive financial compensation but did not suffer injuries.&quot;

===Tobacco===
In 2008, then associate director Jeff Stier addressed the negative long-term effects of smoking by using the example of Barack Obama during his 2008 campaign. It opposed a New York State law that outlawed certain types of smokeless tobacco because, it argued, that would make it &quot;harder for adult smokers to quit cigarettes.&quot; ACSH also criticized Apple Inc. workers who refused to enter homes where smoking had taken place to make technical repairs out of concern over second-hand smoke. ACSH does not support government efforts to ban the sale of e-cigarettes.

In 1980, ACSH co-founder Frederick J. Stare was chairman of ACSH&#x27;s Board of Directors and sought funding from US tobacco giant Philip Morris USA for ACSH&#x27;s activities. He stated that he believed financially supporting ACSH would be to Phillip Morris&#x27; benefit.

==Funding==
The Scaife Foundation and John M. Olin Foundation provided ACSH&#x27;s first financial support in the 1970s. In her address on the 25th anniversary of ACSH, Whelan noted that their critics such as Phil Donahue and Barbara Walters accused them of being a &quot;surrogate&quot; of the petrochemical industry and a &quot;shill&quot; for the food industry. To appease their critics, ACSH only accepted funding from private foundations for two years. However, as the media continued to indicate that ACSH was industry-supported, the Board decided on a fundraising policy through which &quot;about 40% of ACSH [funding] comes from private foundations, about 40% from corporations, and the rest of the sale of ACSH publications&quot;.

As of 2005, they had received $90,000 from ExxonMobil. Whelan told John Tierney of &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2007 that &quot;ACSH has a diverse funding base - we receive donations from private foundations and individuals and unrestricted (usually very small) grants from corporations. The fastest-growing segment of our funding base is individual consumers who are sick and tired of the almost daily baseless scares - and they write us checks to help support our work.&quot; In 2010, Whelan told &quot;The New Yorker&quot; that about a third of the organization&#x27;s $2 million annual budget came from industry.

In 2013, leaked internal financial documents revealed that 58% of the ACSH&#x27;s donations in the period from July 1, 2012, to December 20, 2012, came from corporations and large private foundations, many of which themselves had ties to industries. Donors included Chevron, Coca-Cola, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Bayer Cropscience, Procter &amp; Gamble, Syngenta, 3M, McDonald&#x27;s and Altria. In addition, the documents revealed that the organization had on numerous occasions directly solicited donations from industry sources on the basis of projected reports on the specific issues in which those companies and industry organizations had such a stake.

== Industry influence ==

ACSH is well known for being a pro-industry group, and the organization&#x27;s critics have accused it of being biased in favor of industry. In response to such accusations, ACSH claims that &quot;evidence-based science and medicine, sensible health advice, technological progress, and consumer freedom need protection from the nonstop assault of unscientific activist groups&quot;.

In 1979, the information director of the FDA said, &quot;Whelan just makes blanket endorsements of food additives. Her organization is a sham, an industry front.&quot; In 1980, ACSH co-founder Frederick J. Stare was chairman of ACSH&#x27;s Board of Directors and sought funding from US tobacco company Philip Morris USA for ACSH&#x27;s activities, stating that he believed financially supporting ACSH would be to Phillip Morris&#x27; benefit. In the early 1990s, ACSH decided to stop reporting its funding. Their 1991 report shows that many corporations contributed funds. In 1982, the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), a consumer advocacy group, published a report on ACSH&#x27;s practices that stated, &quot;ACSH seems to arrive at conclusions before conducting studies. Through voodoo or alchemy, bodies of scientific knowledge are transmogrified into industry-oriented position statements.&quot; CSPI director Michael F. Jacobson said of ACSH, &quot;This organization promotes confusion among consumers about what is safe and what isn&#x27;t. ... ACSH is using a slick scientific veneer to obscure and deny truths that virtually everyone else agrees with.&quot;

In a 1992 internal memo by Whelan disclosed by &quot;Consumer Reports&quot;, Whelan directed her staff to ask McNeil Specialty for $10,000 toward a white paper on sweeteners, and she disclosed that her staff would seek &quot;more CCC [Calorie Control Council] money... to help us get new sweetener booklet out&quot;. McNeil Specialty Products (now McNeil Nutritionals) owns the US marketing rights to Splenda, the branded name of the artificial sweetener sucralose; the Calorie Control Council is an industry trade association for producers of artificial sweeteners, fat substitutes, and low-calorie foods. The same memo instructs that staffers give &quot;special attention&quot; to &quot;Mr. McDermott at Searle about meat money&quot;.

One notable critic was Ralph Nader who stated that &quot;ACSH is a consumer front organization for its business backers. It has seized the language and style of the existing consumer organizations, but its real purpose, you might say, is to glove the hand that feeds it.&quot;

Environmental scientist Haydn Washington and cognitive scientist John Cook have described ACSH in &quot;Climate Change Denial: Heads in the Sand&quot; as a greenscamming organization, i.e. as one of many groups that are formed to &quot;masquerade as groups concerned about the environment, but actually work against the interests implied in their names&quot;.

==Gilbert Ross controversy==

Gilbert Ross, ACSH&#x27;s former medical director, served time in federal prison and had his medical license revoked for Medicaid fraud before being hired by ACSH. When news of Ross&#x27;s misconduct was made public in 2005, ACSH responded by stating on its website that Ross was remorseful for the role he played in the scam, it had occurred during a period of personal and financial hardship, and he had resigned from the fraudulent clinic after seven weeks of employment. His medical license was reinstated in 2001. ACSH identifies Ross as an emeritus advisor.

<doc id="1156296" wikidata="Q5301972" url="?curid=1156296" title="Douglas Sheffield, Baroness Sheffield">
<text>Douglas, Lady Sheffield ( Howard; 1542/1543 – 1608), was an English noblewoman, the lover of Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester and mother by him of explorer-cartographer Sir Robert Dudley, an illegitimate son. 

Seventeen years after Leicester&#x27;s death she claimed in litigation that she had secretly been his wife, although she had herself remarried while Leicester was still alive.

==Family and first marriage==
Douglas Howard was the eldest daughter of William Howard, 1st Baron Howard of Effingham, by his second wife, Margaret Gamage. Douglas Howard was probably named in honour of her godmother Margaret Douglas, Countess of Lennox. One of her brothers was Lord High Admiral Charles Howard of Effingham.

Douglas Howard was at court by about 1559, probably as a maid of honour. In 1560 she married a rich peer, John Sheffield, 2nd Baron Sheffield. They had a son and a daughter: Edmund Sheffield, 1st Earl of Mulgrave, who was born in 1565, and Elizabeth Sheffield, who later married Thomas Butler, 10th Earl of Ormonde, and died in November 1600.

== Love affair ==

Not long after the death of John, Lord Sheffield, in December 1568, his widow began an affair with Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s favourite. At some point in the following years, Leicester wrote her a remarkable letter, pondering on the history of their love and explaining to her the reasons why he could not marry, not even to beget a legitimate heir; it would result in his &quot;utter overthrow&quot;: You must think it is some marvellous cause, and toucheth my present state very near, that forceth me thus to be cause almost of the ruin of mine own house ... my brother you see long married and not like to have children, it resteth so now in myself; and yet such occasions is there ... as if I should marry I am sure never to have [the queen&#x27;s] favour. He continues, proposing that she accept one of the suitors for her hand, who she had so far declined for his sake: &quot;The choice falls not oft, and yet I know you may have now of the best; and it is not my part to bid you take them ... so it were not mine honesty to bid you refuse them.&quot; He would help her, in case she wanted to marry elsewhere for reasons of respectability: &quot;for when you have made your election you shall find me a most willing and ready friend to perform all good offices toward you&quot;.

On 11 May 1573, the court correspondent Gilbert Talbot observed that the Earl of Leicester was pursued by Lady Douglas and her sister:There are two sisters now in the court that are very far in love with him, as they have long been; my Lady Sheffield and Frances Howard. They (of like striving who shall love him better) are at great wars together and the queen thinketh not well of them, and not the better of him. 
In August 1574, Douglas&#x27;s son Robert Dudley was born. Leicester acknowledged the paternity of his &quot;base son&quot; and was very fond of him, caring much for his well-being and education.

It is unclear how long Leicester&#x27;s affair with Lady Sheffield continued, but nearly thirty years later her version of events was that Leicester had wanted to end their relationship around 1578, before his marriage to Lettice Knollys, the widowed Countess of Essex. She claimed they had met at Greenwich in the garden, where Leicester wanted her to &quot;disavow the marriage&quot;, offering her seven hundred pounds a year, but she had passionately rejected the offer. Leicester became furious, saying he could as well part from her, leaving her penniless. Upon some reflection, she accepted the offer at last.

In 1604 Lady Sheffield claimed that she had refused to surrender the custody of their son, Robert, for fear that his father, Leicester, would have him killed. However, there is no trace of any disagreement over young Robert&#x27;s upbringing and whereabouts. He grew up in Leicester&#x27;s and his friends&#x27; houses, having &quot;leave to see&quot; his mother whenever she wished.

== Second marriage and Star Chamber trial ==
On 29 November 1579 Douglas Sheffield married Sir Edward Stafford, whose mother, Dorothy Stafford, was very influential with the Queen. From 1583 until 1591 Edward Stafford served as English ambassador to the court of Henry III of France; his wife accompanied him to Paris. There Lady Sheffield became a prominent figure in society and a special friend of Catherine de&#x27; Medici, whom she advised about a reform of the French royal household. By Stafford she had two child, who both died young. The ambassador honoured his wife greatly, but had to cope with the fact that she was still emotionally agitated by remembrances of the Earl of Leicester. Stafford was politically opposed to Leicester, and the personal tensions aggravated this rivalry.

After the death of Queen Elizabeth in May 1603, Lady Sheffield&#x27;s son, Sir Robert Dudley, began trying to claim his father&#x27;s and his uncle&#x27;s extinct titles of Earl of Leicester and Earl of Warwick. He said he had been told by a shadowy adventurer called Thomas Drury that his parents had been secretly married. The case ended up in the Star Chamber and aroused great public interest between 1604 and 1605. The court heard ninety witnesses for Dudley and fifty-seven for Leicester&#x27;s widow, Lettice Knollys. Lady Sheffield did not attend the trial in person, but she declared in writing that Leicester had solemnly contracted to marry her in Cannon Row, Westminster, in 1571, and that they were married at Esher, Surrey, &quot;in wintertime&quot; in 1573. Yet all of the ten putative witnesses (&quot;besides others&quot;) to the ceremony were long dead since. Neither could she remember who the clergyman was, nor the exact date of the marriage. As an explanation for marrying Edward Stafford, she asserted that Leicester had tried to poison her and, &quot;life being sweet&quot;, she had determined to marry &quot;for safeguard of her life&quot;. The Star Chamber rejected the evidence and fined several of the witnesses. It was concluded that Sir Robert Dudley had been duped by Thomas Drury, who in his turn had sought &quot;his own private gains&quot;.

Sir Edward Stafford died while the proceedings in the Star Chamber were in progress. Required to answer questions for the case, he maintained that Sir Robert Dudley had &quot;terrified&quot; his mother into supporting him against her deep reservations. Stafford wrote that he had asked his wife in December 1579, on the Queen&#x27;s command, if she had been contracted to Leicester, to which &quot;she answered with great vows, grief and passion that she had trusted the said earl too much to have anything to show to constrain him to marry her.&quot;

Douglas Sheffield died in early December 1608 at Westminster. In her will she left a black velvet bed among other things to her &quot;honourable and beloved son Sir Robert Dudley&quot;.

<doc id="1156307" wikidata="Q1025849" url="?curid=1156307" title="Alternative Airplay">
<text>Alternative Airplay (formerly known as Modern Rock Tracks between 1988 and 2009, and Alternative Songs between 2009 and 2020) is a music chart published in the American magazine &quot;Billboard&quot; since September 10, 1988. It ranks the 40 most-played songs on alternative and modern rock radio stations. Introduced as Modern Rock Tracks, the chart served as a companion to the Mainstream Rock chart (then called Album Rock Tracks), and its creation was prompted by the explosion of alternative music on American radio in the late 1980s. During the first several years of the chart, it regularly featured music that did not receive commercial radio airplay anywhere but on a few modern rock and college rock radio stations. This included many electronic and post-punk artists. Gradually, as alternative rock became more mainstream (spearheaded by the grunge explosion in the early 1990s), alternative and mainstream rock radio stations began playing many of the same songs. By the late 2000s, the genres became more fully differentiated with only limited crossover. The Alternative Airplay chart features more alternative rock, indie pop, and pop punk artists while the Mainstream Rock chart leans towards more guitar-tinged blues rock, hard rock, and heavy metal.

The chart is based solely on radio airplay ranked by a calculation of the total number of spins each song receives per week. As of 2012, approximately 80 alternative radio stations across the United States are electronically monitored 24 hours a day, seven days a week by Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems. The chart had 30 positions when it was introduced in September 1988 and expanded to 40 positions on September 10, 1994.

The chart was renamed to Alternative Songs beginning with the June 20, 2009, issue after &quot;Billboard&quot; fully absorbed &quot;Radio &amp; Records&quot;, whose similar chart was called &quot;Alternative&quot; and to reflect the music industry&#x27;s more common use of the term. In June 2020, &quot;Billboard&quot; introduced the separate Hot Alternative Songs chart, which uses similar methodology as the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 by measuring the popularity of songs classified as alternative across all radio formats, streaming services, and sales within the United States. To avoid confusion, Alternative Songs was renamed Alternative Airplay.

== History ==
The first alternative chart, called Modern Rock Tracks, appeared in the September 10, 1988, edition of &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine. The first number-one song of the chart was Siouxsie and the Banshees&#x27; &quot;Peek-a-Boo&quot;, which topped the charts for two weeks. In the chart&#x27;s early years, the chart was closely associated with college rock, new wave, post-punk and electronic genres with a large presence of British, Irish and Australian artists, as only 24 of the chart&#x27;s first 82 number-one hits were by American acts. Bands including Depeche Mode, Pixies, the Cure, New Order and R.E.M. were amongst the most popular acts on Alternative radio in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

In 1991, with the release of &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; by Nirvana (which reached No. 1 on November 23, 1991), grunge became a new form of alternative rock to chart. However, grunge did not have a dominating presence on the chart in its heyday; over time, grunge would grow into popularity as a representation of alternative rock in the mainstream. Iconic grunge songs fared decently on the Alternative Songs chart but better on the Mainstream Rock Songs. For example, &quot;Black&quot; by Pearl Jam peaked only at No. 20 on the former but No. 3 on the latter. This was because the college rock and new wave of the 1980s remained the dominant styles of the format, while grunge became an alternative rock style that was popular on the Mainstream Rock format.

In the mid-1990s, alternative rock songs began to crossover to Pop radio, with acts such as Green Day, the Offspring and Alanis Morissette being played on Pop stations after establishing hits on the Alternative chart. Dominant genres included pop punk and softer alternative rock, as grunge acts such as Soundgarden and Stone Temple Pilots did not reach No. 1, while Britpop, a form of alternative rock from the UK, was represented only by Oasis. By the late 1990s, the Alternative Songs chart was ruled by relatively lighter alternative rock bands such as Third Eye Blind, Matchbox Twenty and Sugar Ray and a plethora of one-hit wonders.

At the turn of the century, alternative radio embraced nu-metal/rap rock with bands including Korn, Limp Bizkit and most famously, Linkin Park. Chris Molanphy of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; stated that &quot;possibly the most loathed period for music of the last half-century, the rap-rock years—when looked through the prism of the Modern Rock chart&#x27;s evolution—are a logical endpoint to a decade when alt-culture steadily de-wussified itself.&quot; Garage rock from the likes of the White Stripes and the Strokes also became hits in the early 2000s as a counter to the over-aggression of rap rock.

In the mid-2000s, the Alternative charts were ruled at the top by its most dominant members. From 2003 to 2008, the No. 1 song was by either Foo Fighters, Green Day, Incubus, Linkin Park or Red Hot Chili Peppers 49% of the time – 152 out of 313 weeks. During this time, 1990s alternative groups such as Nine Inch Nails and Weezer enjoyed their biggest success, while emo (Jimmy Eat World), indie rock (Modest Mouse) and pop punk (Fall Out Boy) also were popular. In 2007, &quot;The Kill&quot; by Thirty Seconds to Mars set a record for the longest-running hit in the history of the US alternative chart when it remained on the national chart for 52 weeks. Rise Against&#x27;s &quot;Savior&quot; later broke the record by spending 65 weeks, followed around the same time by &quot;1901&quot; from Phoenix at 57. In 2009, &quot;Billboard&quot; renamed the chart to &quot;Alternative Songs&quot;.

In the 2010s, the Alternative charts were led by softer indie pop and folk, and crossed over new acts to pop radio for the first time since the late 1990s, such as Foster the People, Imagine Dragons, Fun, and Gotye. The chart also began to diverge from the Mainstream Rock chart, as only 10 of 40 songs were shared between the two in November 2012, compared to 23 of 40 in November 2002. For the chart&#x27;s 25th anniversary in 2013, &quot;Billboard&quot; published a list of the 100 biggest hits in the history of the Alternative chart. &quot;Uprising&quot; by Muse was listed at No. 1, having spent 17 weeks on the top of the chart and 53 weeks in total. &quot;Savior&quot; by Rise Against was listed at No. 2, peaking at #3 but staying on the chart for a record-breaking 65 weeks.

On October 11, 2018, &quot;Billboard&quot; released its Greatest of All Time Alternative Songs 30th-anniversary recap. Foo Fighters continued its reign as the chart&#x27;s No. 1 act over the list&#x27;s first 30 years, after leading the 25th-anniversary recap. Muse&#x27;s &quot;Uprising&quot; retained its standing as the all-time No. 1 song. Rise Against&#x27;s &quot;Savior&quot; again ranked at No. 2, while Portugal. The Man&#x27;s &quot;Feel It Still&quot; entered at No. 3, the highest debut on the 30th anniversary songs list, following its record 20-week reign in 2017. Six bands charted at least once in the first four decades of the chart&#x27;s existence – Nine Inch Nails, Depeche Mode, Jane&#x27;s Addiction, Red Hot Chili Peppers, U2 and Beastie Boys. As of 2023, only Depeche Mode, Red Hot Chili Peppers and U2 have extended that streak to five decades. Although the Alternative Songs chart &quot;tends to be heavily male-dominated&quot;, &quot;Billboard&quot; released a list of the top-performing women in the chart&#x27;s archives as part of the 30th anniversary of the Alternative Songs chart, with Dolores O&#x27;Riordan of the Cranberries taking the lead spot.
The current number-one song on the chart is &quot;The Line&quot; by Twenty One Pilots.

==Other chart achievements==

*Blink-182&#x27;s album &quot;One More Time...&quot; has generated songs with the highest total number of weeks spent at number one, with thirty-three weeks total. Red Hot Chili Peppers&#x27; album &quot;Californication&quot; and Linkin Park&#x27;s album &quot;Meteora&quot; come next with thirty weeks each. 

*Sum 41 have had the longest time between number-ones (22 years, 5 months and 3 weeks), with &quot;Fat Lip&quot; (2001) and &quot;Landmines&quot; (2023). The record was previously held by The Killers, who waited 13 years and 6 months, between &quot;When You Were Young&quot; (2006) and &quot;Caution&quot; (2020) for their next number one.

* Fifteen songs released on an independent record label have reached number one on the chart. The first three were &quot;Come Out and Play&quot; by The Offspring, &quot;What It&#x27;s Like&quot; by Everlast and &quot;Panic Switch&quot; by Silversun Pickups. These were followed by &quot;1901&quot; by Phoenix, &quot;Lay Me Down&quot; by The Dirty Heads featuring Rome Ramirez, &quot;Do I Wanna Know?&quot; by Arctic Monkeys, &quot;Hollow Moon (Bad Wolf)&quot; by Awolnation, &quot;The Sound of Winter&quot; by Bush, &quot;First&quot; by Cold War Kids, &quot;Bored to Death&quot; by Blink-182, &quot;Take It All Back&quot; by Judah &amp; the Lion, &quot;No Roots&quot; by Alice Merton, &quot;Sober Up&quot; by AJR featuring Rivers Cuomo, &quot;Trampoline&quot; by Shaed and &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; by Meg Myers.
*Although Soundgarden&#x27;s &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot; did not hit number one on the chart, peaking at number two on July 2, 1994, it became the Modern Rock Tracks year-end number one single of 1994, the only song to do so without ever being number one on the weekly chart.
*In August 2013, Lorde became the first woman to top the chart since Tracy Bonham in 1996 when her song &quot;Royals&quot; reached number one in August 2013; the next woman to top the chart was Elle King with her song &quot;Ex&#x27;s &amp; Oh&#x27;s&quot; which hit the top spot in September 2015. In September 2013, Lorde surpassed Alanis Morissette to become the woman with the longest-running single at number one when &quot;Royals&quot; spent its sixth week at number one. Since then, four other women have also topped the chart, Alice Merton (2018), Lana Del Rey (2019), Billie Eilish (2019), and Meg Myers (2020), as have female-fronted bands Shaed (2019), Cannons (2021), and Paramore (2023).
*Lorde is the youngest solo artist to reach number one, achieving this feat at the age of 16 with &quot;Royals&quot;.
*Billie Eilish holds the records for most number ones on the chart for a soloist and most number ones for a female artist or band with female vocals, having topped the chart four times.
*Fall Out Boy hold the record for the longest wait between their first entry and their first number one single on the chart, when &quot;Love from the Other Side&quot; reached the top in March 2023, 17 years and 9 months after they debuted on the chart with &quot;Sugar, We&#x27;re Goin Down&quot; in June 2005.
* Debbie Harry holds the record for the longest gap between entries on the chart: &quot;Kiss It Better&quot; last appeared on the chart in January 1990 and she did not reappear again until a featured credit on &quot;Soul Train&quot; by Just Loud in December 2018, 29 years later. Kate Bush has the longest gap between entries for a lead artist: &quot;Rubberband Girl&quot; last appeared on the chart in January 1994, and she did not chart again until a re-release of her 1985 single &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot;, which debuted on the chart 28 years later in June 2022. Blur has the longest gap between entries for a band: &quot;Crazy Beat&quot; last appeared on the chart in May 2003, and they did not chart again until &quot;The Narcissist&quot; debuted on the chart 20 years later in June 2023.

<text>The Delaware Blue Hen or Blue Hen of Delaware is a blue strain of American gamecock. Under the name Blue Hen Chicken it is the official bird of the State of Delaware. It is the emblem or mascot of several institutions in the state, among them the sports teams of the University of Delaware.

==History==
The Blue Hen is not a recognized chicken breed. There are a number of different accounts of the origins of the Blue Hen name, which dates from 1775. According to one story, during the Revolutionary War, the men of the 2nd company of the First Delaware Regiment under Captain Jonathan Caldwell, recruited mostly in Kent County, took with them blue game chickens which acquired such a reputation for their fighting ability that the men also came to be known as &quot;Blue Hen&#x27;s Chickens&quot;; another tale is that Caldwell had two gamecocks hatched from a certain blue hen, and that the men called themselves the &quot;Sons of the Blue Hen&quot;. It is also possible that the men of the company acquired a nickname of this sort because their uniforms were reminiscent of the plumage of a fighting cock.

The Blue Hen Chicken was adopted as the official bird of the State of Delaware on April 14, 1939.

The sports teams of the University of Delaware are called the Blue Hens, and their mascot, YoUDee, derives from the bird. In the 1960s, S. Hallock duPont, who bred Blue Hens (though not derived from the original Kent County stock), gave twelve birds to the University, which keeps a small flock at its College of Agriculture &amp; Natural Resources; in 2007 this numbered approximately forty birds.

The Blue Hen is also the emblem of the 166th Airlift Wing and its 142nd Airlift Squadron, stationed in Delaware.

== Characteristics ==
The birds kept by the University of Delaware have been cross-bred with birds of the Blue Andalusian breed from Spain, and have acquired many of its characteristics. They are Mediterranean in appearance, and no longer resemble the original fighting birds. The body is different in both shape and size, there is less gold coloration on the neck hackles, and the earlobes are white rather than the original red.

<doc id="1156329" wikidata="Q4046604" url="?curid=1156329" title="Pentax Auto 110">
<text>The Pentax Auto 110 and Pentax Auto 110 Super were fully automatic single-lens reflex cameras manufactured by Asahi Pentax for use with Kodak 110 film cartridges. The Auto 110 was introduced with three interchangeable, fixed focal length lenses in 1978. A further three lenses (including one zoom lens) were added in 1981 to coincide with the release of the Auto 110 Super the following year. The camera system was sold until 1985. The complete system is sometimes known as the Pentax System 10, apparently for its official Pentax name, although most Pentax advertising only uses the camera name or Pentax-110. This model represented the only complete ultraminiature SLR system manufactured for the 110 film format, although several fixed-lens 110 SLRs were sold. The camera system also claims to be the smallest interchangeable-lens SLR system ever created.

The cameras and lenses were very small (the camera fits in the palm of a hand easily).

== Auto 110 ==
The Pentax Auto 110 features fully automatic exposure, with no user-settable exposure compensation or adjustments. Metering is TTL (through-the-lens) and center-weighted. Unlike 35 mm SLRs, the system&#x27;s lenses do not have a built-in iris to control the aperture. Instead, an iris is mounted inside the camera body, and functions as both an aperture control and a shutter. This mechanism is capable of programmed exposures between 1/750 s at f/13.5; and 1 s at f/2.8. To ensure that light travelling past the diaphragm blades could not get through to the film over time, the camera&#x27;s mirror system also functions as a light-tight seal when in the viewing and focusing position. Since the iris is part of the camera, all of the system&#x27;s lenses had to be constructed with an f/2.8 aperture. The lens&#x27; designs, based upon the film dimensions, result in the 24 mm lens being the &#x27;normal&#x27; focal length (i.e. equivalent angle of view to a 50 mm lens on a 135 format camera), while lenses of wider angles or longer focal lengths were larger.

===Film speed detection===
The camera detects the film speed by the presence or absence of a ridge on the cartridge, as specified in the Kodak 110 film standard. Since there is no official specification of what the film speeds should actually be—they were just &quot;low&quot; and &quot;high&quot;—film and camera manufacturers had to decide for themselves the meaning. Pentax chose ISO 80 and 320 as their settings, but commercially available films at ISO 100 and 400 are close enough to work in practice. A film with an ISO 200 speed would result in either under- or over-exposure. The exposure latitude of color print films is about 2 f/stops (meaning that a photographer could expose either 2 f/stops under or 2 f/stops over the exposure set by the camera). Unfortunately, some recently produced 110 film is rated at ISO 400, but is packaged with the ridge indicating &quot;low&quot;. If this is the case, the ridge must be removed (by filing or cutting with a sharp blade) for the camera to expose correctly. Since only a few 110 cameras ever supported the ISO auto-selection, this does not affect the majority of cameras using the format but does affect the Pentax Auto 110. In 2012/2013 ISO 100 film has been produced and marketed under the Lomography label, and gives excellent results, without the need to modify the cartridge casing.

The camera was offered in a special edition &quot;Safari&quot; model, identical to the Auto 110 except for the brown-and-tan color scheme.

== Auto 110 Super ==

Introduced in late 1982, the Super is nearly identical in basic shape and size to the previous model and accepts the same lenses. Many improvements and changes were included to make this model arguably a better camera than the previous Auto 110. Film winding is improved with a single-stroke film advance lever that advances the film and cocks the shutter in one winding (the Auto 110 takes two strokes to advance the film). A switch around the shutter release button enables a new ten-second self-timer mode and a shutter lock; the self-timer activates a red light on the pentaprism housing, which flashes during the 10-second shutter release count-down. A button on the front on the user&#x27;s left hand side gives a +1.5 EV (exposure value) backlit scene exposure compensation.

The optional winder offers an improved battery cover, a well-known weak component in the Auto 110. The shutter button is protected from accidental tripping by an altered casing around the button. The flash synchronization socket cover on the Super is permanently attached to the camera in an attempt to prevent loss, though many still get lost when the plastic tether breaks.

The viewfinder screen has a split image rangefinder center, surrounded by a microprism collar, whereas the Auto 110 has the split image rangefinder center only. The low light warning activates at 1/45 s (the Auto 110 activates at 1/30 s).

== Lenses ==

The line of lenses consisted of these three at launch:

* 18 mm f/2.8 wide-angle lens (equivalent angle of view to a 35 mm lens on a 135 format camera), (Filter diameter: 30.5 mm).
* 24 mm f/2.8 normal lens (equiv. 50 mm). The optical design meant that this was the smallest lens on the system. (Filter diameter: 25.5 mm)
* 50 mm f/2.8 telephoto lens (equiv. 100 mm), (Filter diameter: 37.5 mm)

In 1981, three more lenses were included:

* 18 mm &quot;Pan Focus&quot; lens was a compact lens of fixed focus set to the hyperfocal distance; the short focal length and wide aperture meant that its depth of field stretched from 1.75 m (5.7 ft) to infinity. The camera aperture needed to be set at f/6.3 for this lens to work as intended,(Filter diameter: 30.5 mm) 
* 70 mm f/2.8 telephoto lens (equiv. 140 mm),(Filter diameter: 49 mm)
* 20–40 mm f/2.8 zoom lens (equiv. 40–80 mm). This lens extended for wider focal lengths and shortened towards the telephoto end, (Filter diameter: 49 mm)

The three later lenses are much rarer.

Soligor also made a 1.7x teleconverter.

Lens hoods were available for all of the lenses, and Pentax sold add-on close-up lenses for macro photography and a range of filters.

The 110 lenses have found a new life with the Pentax Q system, which will accept them with an adapter, albeit with a 5.6x crop factor (effective increase in focal length). The lenses can also be mounted on Panasonic/Olympus Micro Four Thirds cameras with an adapter, and the crop factor is only 2x, the same as on the original Pentax 110 body. Wherever adapted, the lenses still require manual focusing.
The 110 lenses can be adapted to APS-C mirrorless cameras, with little vignetting on 24mm, less on 18mm, and no vignetting on 50mm.

== Winders ==

Two models of motor winder were produced. The original &quot;110 Winder&quot; took 2 AA batteries and could wind through 100 cartridges of 110 film with one set of batteries. It works only in single-shot mode. It takes about 1.5 s to wind a frame. The &quot;110 Winder II&quot;, introduced in 1982, adds a continuous shooting mode and improves the battery cover door, which was fragile on the original.

== Flash ==

A custom electronic flash unit, the AF130P, was part of the original Auto 110 system, and was produced until the camera ceased being manufactured. Pentax responded to criticism that this electronic flash unit was too large by introducing the smaller AF100P electronic flash unit in 1980. This unit, however, was never part of the Pentax camera kits and became rare.

== Other accessories ==

Pentax produced a range of various camera-carrying cases and also a belt-clip for the cameras.

<text>The Učka (, ) is a mountain range in western Croatia. It rises behind the Opatija riviera, on the eastern side of the Istrian peninsula.

It forms a single morphological unit together with the Ćićarija range which stretches from the Bay of Trieste to Rijeka. Učka is a limestone massif with numerous areas of karst, stretching for 20 km from the Poklon Pass (920 m) to Plomin Bay, and is between 4 and 9 km wide.

It differs from all the other coastal mountains in Croatia because of its abundant vegetation on the seaward side. Best known are the forests of sweet chestnuts in the area around Lovran.

Učka&#x27;s highest peaks are considered nature reserves and memorial areas. The highest peak, Vojak, is located at 1,396 meters above sea level. It offers views over Istria, the Bay of Trieste, the Julian Alps and the Adriatic islands, right down to Dugi Otok.

The subject of a degree of local folklore, Učka is visible from much of the peninsula and is snow-capped some months of the year. The town of Opatija () is said to have derived its popularity as a resort in Imperial Austria because it is located &quot;in the shade&quot; of Mt. Učka, which by legend shields it from the fierce Mediterranean heat in summertime.

The area of Učka is designated as a nature park (&quot;park prirode&quot;) in Croatia.

Historically, the Istro-Romanians, a Romance ethnic group of Istria, have been separated by the mountain range, forming two areas of concentration: one in the village of Žejane and one in the village of Šušnjevica and the surrounding settlements. Although these areas are 50 kilometers away from each other, there is a road around the Učka that connects them.

<doc id="1156333" wikidata="Q7678314" url="?curid=1156333" title="Takin' My Time">
<text>Takin&#x27; My Time is the third studio album by American musician Bonnie Raitt. It was released in 1973 by Warner Bros. Records. The album is an amalgamation of several different genres, including blues, folk, jazz, New Orleans rhythm and blues, and calypso. The 10 tracks on the album are covers, ranging from soft sentimental ballads to , rhythmic-heavy tracks. Lowell George was originally hired to handle the production, but was ultimately replaced by John Hall when Raitt became unhappy with his production.

&quot;Takin&#x27; My Time&quot; received positive reviews from music critics, and reached number 87 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tapes chart. Retrospective reviews have also been positive, with critics praising the eclecticism, as well as Raitt&#x27;s attempts to broaden her musical horizon. Raitt went on an accompanying tour of the United States.

==Background and composition==
In 1973, Raitt moved to Los Angeles, and became friends with members of American rock band Little Feat. After the release of their album &quot;Dixie Chicken&quot; (1973), Raitt hired frontman and guitarist Lowell George to produce her upcoming album. Raitt was unhappy with George&#x27;s production, which she said was due to a lack of objectivity. According to Raitt: &quot;It became too emotional. It&#x27;s hard having a strong woman telling the man her ideas when, in fact, the man wants to take over the situation.&quot; American musician John Hall was then brought in for production to replace George. Under the direction of Hall, &quot;Takin&#x27; My Time&quot; was recorded from June to July 1973 at Sunset Sound Recorders in Los Angeles.

&quot;Takin&#x27; My Time&quot; combines many different music genres, including blues, folk, jazz, New Orleans rhythm and blues, and calypso. &quot;Takin&#x27; My Time&quot; is similar to Raitt&#x27;s previous studio album &quot;Give It Up&quot; (1972), as both albums feature a mix of soft sentimental ballads and , rhythmic-heavy tracks. The sentimental ballads focus on romance and heartache, and possess a &quot;late night, bluesy intimacy,&quot; according to &quot;No Depression&quot;. The upbeat tracks vary in genre; &quot;Wah She Go Do&quot; is a calypso and reggae-inspired track, while &quot;Let Me In&quot; is a dance track, inspired by polka and ragtime. All 10 tracks on the album are covers of songs from musicians like Jackson Browne, Randy Newman and Calypso Rose.

==Release and reception==
&quot;Takin&#x27; My Time&quot; was released in October 1973, through Warner Bros. Records. It reached number 87 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tapes chart, and number 91 on the &quot;Record World&quot; album chart. Raitt supported the album with an incessant touring schedule across the United States; biographer Mark Bego described Raitt&#x27;s approach to touring as a &quot;perform-pack-unpack-perform lifestyle.&quot;

&quot;Takin&#x27; My Time&quot; was met with positive reviews from music critics. The staff of &quot;Billboard&quot; described the album as &quot;a top mix of blues and ballads such as &#x27;I Gave My Love a Candle&#x27; from one of po[p]&#x27;s most underrated female vocalists.&quot; A critic for &quot;Record World&quot; highlighted Hall&#x27;s production, and wrote: &quot;Bonnie&#x27;s beautiful voice and super blues guitar playing grace a collection of wonderful songs.&quot; Tony Glover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; felt that despite the large amount of musical variety, &quot;Takin&#x27; My Time&quot; was Raitt&#x27;s most cohesive album. Glover commended the musicianship between Raitt and the backup musicians, with him writing that &quot;it&#x27;s evident a lot of her soul went into this one, and that makes it worth hearing.&quot;

Retrospective reviews of &quot;Takin&#x27; My Time&quot; from critics have also been positive. In his book &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot;, Robert Christgau commended Raitt&#x27;s attempt to broaden her musical scope with more eclectic tracks such as &quot;You&#x27;ve Been in Love Too Long&quot; and &quot;Wah She Go Do&quot;. Christgau wrote more negatively towards some of the folk-inspired tracks, which he called &quot;too pretty, too ordinary.&quot; Robert Gordon of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; praised the wide musical variety on &quot;Takin&#x27; My Time&quot;, with him saying: &quot;Raitt sounds comfortable singing rhythmic rockers, slow songs, and a swinging New Orleans tune, &#x27;Let Me In.&#x27; The lighthearted calypso &#x27;Wah She Go Do&#x27; may be just a lark, but it&#x27;s definitely fun.&quot; Vik Iyengar of AllMusic felt Raitt had done a good job at choosing and interpreting the 10 cover tracks, and called &quot;Takin&#x27; My Time&quot; an &quot;underrated gem.&quot; Iyengar believed &quot;Takin&#x27; My Time&quot; was Raitt&#x27;s last consistent album until her comeback in the 1980s.

<doc id="1156346" wikidata="Q4910291" url="?curid=1156346" title="Bill Murdoch">
<text>Bill Murdoch (January 10, 1945 – August 16, 2022) was a former politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1990 to 2011, representing the riding of Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound.

==Background==
Murdoch was educated at the Owen Sound Collegiate and Vocational Institute, and worked as a farmer, electrical draftsman, film stripper and salesman. He was also a Freemason and a member of the Royal Canadian Legion. He served as chair of the Grey Sauble Conservation Authority for five years.

==Politics==

===Municipal===
Murdoch began his political career at the municipal level by serving in for four years as a councillor in Sydenham Township and as reeve for a further eight years. He was elected as warden of Grey County in 1987. Murdoch served as vice-president of the Association of Municipalities of Ontario for two years and was a member of the board of directors for five years.

===Provincial===
Murdoch&#x27;s first bid to enter the Ontario legislature was unsuccessful. He ran as a Progressive Conservative for the riding of Grey in the 1987 Ontario election, in which the Liberals under David Peterson won a landslide majority. Murdoch lost to the Liberal Ron Lipsett, candidate, by about 2000 votes. The Liberals saw their support base decline during the 1990 election, however, and Murdoch was able to win the seat on his second attempt, defeating the New Democrat, candidate Peggy Hutchinson, by about 2500 votes (Lipsett finished third).

Murdoch was easily re-elected in the provincial elections of 1995 and 1999, both of which were won by the Progressive Conservatives under Mike Harris. He developed a reputation as a party maverick, and was never seriously considered for a cabinet appointment.

Murdoch&#x27;s political philosophy was somewhat eccentric and defies easy summarization. He has never been afraid to criticize his own party, whether in government or opposition. He opposed the Harris government&#x27;s decision to cancel the province&#x27;s spring bear hunt and claims that he was fired from a parliamentary assistant position after calling for more free votes in the house. He once demanded a recorded vote on a same-sex benefits bill brought forward by the McGuinty government. Only 3 of the required 5 members stood to request a recorded vote and the Bill passed on an unrecorded voice vote.

Murdoch&#x27;s riding included the town of Walkerton (since the provincial riding re-organization, it is in Huron-Bruce), which suffered from a deadly outbreak of E. coli in 2000 as a result of polluted water. Some criticized Murdoch for rejecting the possibility that his government&#x27;s cutbacks were partly responsible for the outbreak.

The Progressive Conservatives lost the 2003 election though Murdoch was re-elected in his own riding. After the election, he considered sitting as a member of the New Democratic Party; not for ideological reasons, but in order to give the NDP official party status in the legislature after it fell one short of the required eight seats. Though Murdoch&#x27;s beliefs are far removed from NDP policy, he claimed he was willing to cross the floor because the party deserved a voice in the legislature. The plan was seriously considered by NDP leader Howard Hampton, but came to nothing. The NDP subsequently won a by-election, and regained party status on their own.

During the 2007 Ontario election, Murdoch sparked controversy by being the first PC caucus member to publicly oppose the party leader John Tory&#x27;s proposal for public funding of all private religious schools in the province. Murdoch stated that although he initially supported the plan, the widespread opposition by his constituents convinced him to reconsider his position. He has stated that if the issue came before the legislature, he would vote against it. Tory, commenting on Murdoch&#x27;s position, stated, &quot;When you look up maverick in the dictionary you find his picture there — in colour...&quot;

On September 12, 2008, he was suspended from the Progressive Conservative caucus for openly calling for Tory&#x27;s resignation. On September 18, 2008, he was permanently expelled from the Progressive Conservative caucus and sat as an Independent member of the legislature.

On April 23, 2009, Progressive Conservative interim leader Bob Runciman announced Murdoch would be returning to the PC caucus effective immediately.

On July 5, 2010, Murdoch announced that he would retire after the 2011 provincial election, which saw the Progressive Conservatives maintain their hold on the Bruce-Grey-Owen Sound riding under first-time MPP Bill Walker.

==After politics==
After retiring from politics, Murdoch hosted an open-line radio talk show on CFOS 560 AM (Owen Sound, Ontario) on Monday, Wednesday and Friday mornings (9-10 AM Eastern Time) which, dependent upon the day of the week, was identified on air as &quot;Murdoch Mondays&quot;, &quot;Mid-week with Murdoch&quot; and/or &quot;Rock and Talk with Murdoch&quot;. In addition to talk, the program also showcased the music of local (mainly Grey and Bruce counties) recording artists. In July 2022 he was admitted to the Chapman house hospice at 77 years old for cancer. He was awarded a Platinum Jubilee medal by MP Alex Ruff for his community service. He died on August 16, 2022. A funeral was held for Murdoch in Owen Sound and was interred in the McLean&#x27;s Cemetery in Bognor, Ontario.

<doc id="1156363" wikidata="Q3853199" url="?curid=1156363" title="Mayhem in Monsterland">
<text>Mayhem in Monsterland is a 1993 platform game for the Commodore 64. Its titular hero, &quot;Mayhem&quot;, is a yellow triceratops blessed with the gift of speed. His goal is to return his world from sad to happy, ridding the world of monsters along the way.

== Plot ==
An apprentice magician dinosaur living in Monsterland, Theo Saurus, made a mistake while practising a spell one day. He turned the lands Jellyland, Pipeland, Spottyland, Cherryland, and Rockland into sad places, void of color or life. Theo began living in a hidden cave to avoid the wrath of the other monsters until discovered one day by the hero of the story, Mayhem. Mayhem promised to bring Theo the necessary magic dust to transform Monsterland to its previous happy state.

== Gameplay ==
At the beginning of each stage the goals are displayed to the player. There are two types of quota to be met. The first is magic dust quota where enemies must be defeated to gain magic dust. Enemies may be killed in two ways. Enemies may be bounced on. Mayhem bounces upwards a small amount when destroying an enemy like this. Once the lightning power up has been obtained, enemies may also be charged at with speed in a special attack. Monsters are not always simple to dispatch as some have spikes and others shells. Soft spots on such enemies have to be found by the player in order to defeat them.

Happier music plays once all the enemies are defeated. It is then a race against the clock to collect the quota of stars and to get to the exit to complete the stage. The faster a star is rotating, the more points it is worth. If all stars are collected on a stage, then the player can receive a Super-Star bonus, but only on the first and last stage of the game on the cassette and disk versions of the game.

== Development ==

&quot;Mayhem in Monsterland&quot; was produced by Apex Computer Productions, who had previously made &quot;Creatures&quot; and &quot;Creatures 2&quot;, which featured Clyde Radcliffe as the main character. &quot;Mayhem&quot; was far lighter in tone than &quot;Creatures&quot;, which featured end-of-level action puzzles that, if not successfully accomplished, meant death by various gruesome means.

The developers used special techniques to allow the then 12 year old C64 to process gameplay at speeds unseen in C64 before.

== Reception and legacy ==

The game received a 97% in &quot;Commodore Force&quot; and a 100% in &quot;Commodore Format&quot;, which had chronicled the game&#x27;s development.

*&quot;Play Time&quot;

==Legacy==
The game was released on the European Virtual Console online store for the Nintendo Wii system on 17 October 2008.

In 2009, a 15th Anniversary Edition of the game was released on cassette and disk by British retro publisher Psytronik Software. The same publisher later released a 25th Anniversary Edition in 2019.

A new game for mobile phones starring Mayhem, &quot;Mayhem&#x27;s Magic Dust&quot;, was released in 2004. It was developed by Infinite Lives.

<text>Tim Regan (born June 27, 1981) is a former American soccer defender, and coach who currently is the head coach for the Bradley Braves men&#x27;s soccer program.

==College==
Regan played college soccer at Bradley University from 1999 to 2002, where he established himself as one of the best players in the program&#x27;s history. After starting 20 games as a freshman, Regan was named second-team All-Missouri Valley Conference as a sophomore, after registering two goals and two assists from a defensive midfield position. Regan was moved to defense as a junior, and proved more than up to the task - he finished the year as a first-team All-MVC winner, and the team&#x27;s co-MVP with Gavin Glinton. Regan remained at defense as a senior and performed even better, winning MVC Defensive Player of the Year while being instrumental in the team posting a 0.81 goals against average.

==Professional==
Upon graduating, Regan was selected 17th overall in the 2003 MLS SuperDraft by MetroStars of Major League Soccer. Regan was versatile, but not overly impressive in MLS. As a rookie, he appeared in 15 games, starting seven, at numerous positions in the defense and midfield. Regan received less playing time in 2004, playing in just 12 games. His hard work was rewarded with an expanded role in 2005, as he started 18 out of 20 matches. However, on March 1, 2006, Regan was released by MetroStars. One month later he was signed by his former Metro coach Bob Bradley at Chivas USA where he became a surprise starter.

After the 2006 season, Regan was picked up by Toronto FC in the 2006 MLS Expansion Draft, but later traded to New York Red Bulls (the former MetroStars) for forward Edson Buddle. He was waived by New York during the 2007 season.

In the spring of 2008, Regan trained with Chicago Fire and appeared in a preseason games for his hometown club, but was not offered a contract. Later that season, he would, however, sign a &#x27;one-day contract&#x27; with Toronto FC — who were missing nine players to international duty — in order to play in a game against his former club, Chivas USA. Regan eventually signed a deal with Toronto that kept him at the club until the end of the season. He retired following the 2008 season to become Toronto&#x27;s head of scouting.

He is also a &quot;Soccer Operations &amp; Scouting&quot; instructor for the online sports career training school, Sports Management Worldwide, in Portland, OR.

==Coaching career==
On November 11, 2013, Regan was named as assistant coach for Indy Eleven of the NASL. On June 2, 2015, Regan was named Indy&#x27;s interim head coach, following the dismissal of Juergen Sommer.

Regan served as is an assistant coach for his alma mater, Bradley, under the Braves&#x27; head coach, Jim DeRose from 2018 until 2023. He also became the head coach of USL League Two expansion club Peoria City in 2020. In 2023, Regan became the head coach at Bradley replacing the retiring DeRose.

<doc id="1156381" wikidata="Q375347" url="?curid=1156381" title="Thomas McKean Thompson McKennan">
<text>Thomas McKean Thompson McKennan (March 31, 1794 – July 9, 1852) was a 19th-century politician and lawyer who served briefly as United States Secretary of the Interior under President Millard Fillmore.

== Early life ==
McKennan was born in New Castle, Delaware on March 31, 1794, the son of Col. William and Elizabeth Thompson McKennan. He later moved with his family to Washington, Pennsylvania. He graduated from Washington College in 1810 and was admitted to the bar in 1814, commencing practice in Washington.

==Career==
===Early career===
He was a member of the Union Literary Society at Washington College. In a January 1811 speech to the Union Society, McKennan outlined the seven areas of study (Latin and Greek; Mathematics; Rhetoric; Logic; Geography and History; Natural Philosophy; and Moral Philosophy) that comprised the college&#x27;s curriculum at the time.

He worked as a tutor at Washington College in 1813, as he was studying law. Later, he was a Trustee of the College and was often asked to be President of Washington College, but he refused every time.

===Pennsylvania politics===
He was deputy attorney general of Pennsylvania from 1815 to 1816, and served on the Town Council in Washington, Pennsylvania, from 1818 to 1830, and was elected to the twenty-second congress in 1830. He served in the United States House of Representatives from 1831 to 1839, where he made a protective tariff his top priority. McKennan refused to stand as a candidate again in the 1838 elections, and retired from Congress. He served again from 1842 to 1843 as both an Anti-Masonic and Whig to complete the term of his late successor Joseph Lawrence. (The special election was set for May 20, 1842.) He was the chairman of the Committee on Roads and Canals in the twenty-seventh congress.

Despite immense pressure from associates, friends, and the Washington County Whig Party, McKennan again refused to run for another term in Congress, declaring that he had done his duty by serving in public office, and it was time to return to Washington, Pennsylvania, and focus on his law practice. In 1844, his supporters in his hometown of Washington, Pennsylvania, unsuccessfully tried to stir up interest in McKennan as a running mate for Henry Clay, and there is no indication that McKennan himself approved of the idea. McKennan also resisted efforts to entice him to run for governor of Pennsylvania in the 1840s, but in 1848, he served as president of the Pennsylvania electoral college.

===Secretary of the Interior===
Upon Millard Fillmore becoming the President of the United States, McKennan was offered the position of the United States Secretary of the Interior, but was reluctant to accept; only after intense pressure from friends and associates did he relent. Almost immediately, he regretted his decision, and resigned after a tenure of only 11 days. McKennan cited his &quot;peculiar nervous temperament&quot; which responded to excitement and depression for his reason to resign. Contemporary accounts also cite disagreements with President Fillmore and Secretary of State Daniel Webster regarding the appointment and removal of attorneys, marshals, clerks, and heads of bureaus. During his brief time as Secretary, McKennan was the head of the 1850 Census, which was being conducted that summer, and he issued a remarkably foresighted statement on the importance of protecting individual privacy:

Information has been received at this office that in some cases unnecessary exposure has been made by the assistant marshals with reference to the business and pursuits, and other facts relating to individuals, merely to gratify curiosity, or the facts applied to the private use or pecuniary advantage of the assistant, to the injury of others. Such a use of the returns was neither contemplated by the act itself nor justified by the intentions and designs of those who enacted the law. No individual employed under sanction of the Government to obtain these facts has a right to promulgate or expose them without authority.

...all marshals and assistants are expected to consider the facts intrusted to them as if obtained exclusively for the use of the Government, and not to be used in any way to the gratification of curiosity, the exposure of any man&#x27;s business or pursuits, or for the private emolument of the marshals or assistants, who, while employed in this service, act as the agents of the Government in the most confidential capacity.

===Later career===
Following his resignation, McKennan took on a less stressful job as the president of the Hempfield Railroad, which was then under construction between Wheeling, Virginia, and Greensburg, Pennsylvania, through his own town of Washington (in 1871, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad purchased the financially hobbled Hempfield).

==Personal life==
On December 6, 1815, McKennan married Matilda Lourie Bowman. They had eight children together:
*William McKennan
*Thomas McKennan
*Isabella McKennan
*Jacob Bowman McKennan
*Thomas McKean Thompson McKennan, Jr.
*Anne Elizabeth McKennan
*John Thompson McKennan
*Matilda Bowman McKennan

McKennan died on July 9, 1852, in Reading, Pennsylvania, while on Hempfield Railroad business, and was interred at the Washington Cemetery in his long-time home of Washington, Pennsylvania.

<doc id="1156383" wikidata="Q5342093" url="?curid=1156383" title="Edward Burrough">
<text>Edward Burrough (1634–1663) was an early English Quaker leader and controversialist. He is regarded as one of the Valiant Sixty, who were early Quaker preachers and missionaries.

==Convincement==
Burrough was born in Underbarrow, Westmorland, and educated in the Church of England, but became a Presbyterian before becoming convinced (a Quaker term referring to conversion). During his late teens, he heard George Fox preach in 1652 and was convinced of the truth as understood by the Religious Society of Friends. He was consequently rejected by his parents. Burrough began itinerant preaching throughout England, travelling with another Friend, Francis Howgill. Among those converted by them was Hester Biddle, probably in 1654.

==Debate==
During the years 1656–1657 Burrough and John Bunyan were engaged in a pamphlet debate, begun by Bunyan, who published &quot;Some Gospel Truths Opened&quot;, in which he attacked Quaker beliefs. Burrough responded with &quot;The True Faith of the Gospel of Peace&quot;. Bunyan countered with &quot;A Vindication of Some Gospel Truths Opened&quot;, which Burrough answered with &quot;Truth (the Strongest of All) Witnessed Forth&quot;. Later the Quaker leader George Fox entered the fray by publishing a refutation of Bunyan&#x27;s essay in &quot;The Great Mystery of the Great Whore Unfolded&quot;.

==Intervention with the king==
Upon the Restoration in 1660, Burrough approached King Charles II requesting protection and relief of Quakers in New England, who were being persecuted by Puritans there. Charles granted him an audience in 1661, and was persuaded to issue a writ stopping (temporarily) the corporal and capital punishments of the Quakers in Massachusetts.

Burrough arranged for the writ to be delivered by Samuel Shattuck, himself a Quaker under a ban from Massachusetts. Charles&#x27;s writ commanded the Massachusetts authorities to send the imprisoned Quakers to England for trial, but they chose instead to release them. The king&#x27;s order effectively stopped the hangings, but imprisonments and floggings were resumed the next year.

==Imprisonment and death==
In 1662, Burrough was arrested for holding a meeting, which was illegal under the terms of the Quaker Act. He was sent to Newgate Prison, London.

An order for his release signed by Charles II was ignored by the local authorities, and Burrough remained in Newgate until his death on February 14, 1663, aged just 29 (&quot;twelfth month 1662&quot; in the Old Style and Quaker terminologies). He was buried in the Quaker Burying Ground, Bunhill Fields.

After his death, his collected works were published by E. Hookes in 1671 as &quot;The Memorable Works of a Son of Thunder and Consolation: Namely, that True Prophet, and Faithful Servant of God, and Sufferer for the Testimony of Jesus, Edward Burroughs, who Dyed a Prisoner for the Word of God, in the City of London, the Fourteenth of the Twelfth Moneth, 1662&quot;.

==In popular culture==
*New Model Army&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Thunder and Consolation&quot;, was named as a reference to his collected works, &quot;The Memorable Works of a Son of Thunder and Consolation&quot;.

<doc id="1156384" wikidata="Q5767266" url="?curid=1156384" title="Hinkley Locomotive Works">
<text>Hinkley Locomotive Works was a steam locomotive manufacturer based in Boston, Massachusetts in the 19th century.

==History==

The company that was to become known as Hinkley Locomotive Works got its start in Boston in 1831. Holmes Hinkley and his partner Daniel F. Child founded the Boston Machine Works and soon built the third stationary steam engine that was constructed in Massachusetts. The company&#x27;s first locomotive was a 4-2-0 built in 1840 that followed the roughly standard designs of the 1830s. Hinkley&#x27;s early locomotives closely resembled those designed by John Souther.

The company gained a reputation as a reliable and respectable locomotive builder and grew to become the largest manufacturer in New England within a decade. In 1848 the company reorganized as the Boston Locomotive Works and operated under that name until foreclosure due to the financial panic in 1859.

After reorganization under Jarvis Williams, the company became Hinkley, Williams and Company. Hinkley, who had been forced out in the foreclosure, returned to the company in another reorganization in 1864 as the Hinkley and Williams Locomotive Works. The company produced locomotives for the railroads of the American Civil War and regained some of the earlier profitability that they had enjoyed earlier in the century. Also during the Civil War, as Hinckley, Williams and Co, fifty large cannon were forged for the US Government.

In 1872 the company was renamed Hinkley Locomotive Works but fell into bankruptcy again by the end of the decade. This bankruptcy led to the 1880 reorganization as the Hinkley Locomotive Company. Orders fell off and the company was permanently closed in 1889. In 1890, the Portland Company acquired the patterns used by the Hinkley Locomotive Works for its two-foot gauge locomotives.

== Locomotives ==
A 9-ton built in 1846 as the &quot;Lion&quot; for the Machiasport Railroad of eastern Maine is preserved at the Maine State Museum in Augusta, Maine.

Another Hinkley engine still exists but not in its original form. In 1879, the Hinkley Locomotive Works built a named &quot;H. C. Hardon&quot;, and numbered 73, for the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe. This engine was converted to a and re-numbered 643, by the Santa Fe shops in 1897 and it served the Santa Fe until its retirement c1953. This engine, not currently in operating condition, is now located in the Oklahoma Railway Museum, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

A Hinkley locomotive was used to transport Abraham Lincoln from Springfield, Illinois, to Washington D.C. for his inauguration.

<doc id="1156386" wikidata="Q7835828" url="?curid=1156386" title="Traumatic cardiac arrest">
<text>Traumatic cardiac arrest (TCA) is a condition in which the heart has ceased to beat due to blunt or penetrating trauma, such as a stab wound to the thoracic area. It is a medical emergency which will always result in death without prompt advanced medical care. Even with prompt medical intervention, survival without neurological complications is rare. In recent years, protocols have been proposed to improve survival rate in patients with traumatic cardiac arrest, though the variable causes of this condition as well as many coexisting injuries can make these protocols difficult to standardize. Traumatic cardiac arrest is a complex form of cardiac arrest often derailing from advanced cardiac life support in the sense that the emergency team must first establish the cause of the traumatic arrest and reverse these effects, for example hypovolemia and haemorrhagic shock due to a penetrating injury.

== Mechanism ==
Traumatic cardiac arrest can occur in patients following any severe blunt or penetrating injury to the chest. Following the traumatic event, the heart ceases to pump blood through the body. Unlike medical cardiac arrest, there are several potentially reversible causes that may result in cardiac arrest in the setting of trauma. Clinicians will rapidly assess for these causes, and interventions will be directed to the specific cause.

In both blunt and penetrating trauma, massive internal or external bleeding may decrease the volume of blood is available to be pumped by the heart to the body. This is considered preload dependent arrest.

=== Tension pneumothorax ===
Tension pneumothorax is caused when air is able to enter the space between the lung and the chest wall, but is not able to escape. The increasing pressure within the chest cavity prevents blood from returning from the body to fill the heart.

=== Hemothorax ===
Hemothorax occurs when injury to the chest results in bleeding into the thoracic cavity. Similar to tension pneumothorax, increasing pressure prevents the return of blood from circulation to the heart.

=== Cardiac tamponade ===
In the setting of trauma, cardiac tamponade results from an acute pericardial effusion, the accumulation of blood within the sac that surrounds the heart. As this sac is filled with fluid, the pressure on the heart is increased, and the chambers of the heart are unable to fill with blood.

=== Hypoxia ===
Inability to maintain oxygenation in trauma patients may be a result of airway compromise due to mechanical injury or obstruction or due to loss of the respiratory drive from cervical spine or peripheral nerve injury. These conditions result in the hypoxia that may lead to cardiac arrest.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Patients will present following a traumatic event most often with pulseless electrical activity (PEA). Patients will exhibit low blood pressure with pulses that cannot be palpated. Patients will progress into asystole if the underlying condition is not reversed. Other non-specific signs and symptoms associated with impending traumatic cardiac arrest may include sweating, altered mental status, rapid or slow breathing, and signs of trauma (bruising, laceration, fractures, etc.).

== Diagnosis ==

Diagnosis of traumatic cardiac arrest is initially made with electrocardiogram with EMS or in the emergency department. Clinicians will also order diagnostic testing that may include chest x-ray, bedside ultrasound and echocardiogram, and blood gas levels. A type and cross will be ordered to match the patient to receive blood transfusion if necessary.

Other work-up involved in diagnosis of a trauma patient may include e-FAST, RUSH exam, CBC, pelvic X-ray, and CT of the head, neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis.

== Treatment ==
Treatment of traumatic cardiac arrest is guided by advanced trauma life support guidelines. Standard advanced cardiac life support guidelines are inappropriate for use in traumatic cardiac arrest, as they are directed primarily at treating pathology originating within the heart itself. As clinicians begin to intervene, they will simultaneously seek reversible causes of the arrest. Management begins by establishing multiple points of IV access and evaluating the patient&#x27;s airway and breathing. Other interventions may include thoracostomy and thoracotomy, as well as treatment of the underlying cause of arrest.

=== Basic life support ===
Basic life support is commonly initiated by bystanders and first responders, but the role of basic life support in traumatic cardiac arrest is unclear. Basic life support is targeted to maintain oxygenation and circulation throughout the body, which can be lifesaving in cases of medical cardiac arrest, but does not address the frequent large volume blood loss encounters in many cases of traumatic cardiac arrest.

=== Chest compressions ===
Chest compressions are considered the most important initial intervention in cases of medical cardiac arrest, however studies evaluating their efficacy have excluded patients with traumatic cardiac arrest. Chest compressions work to replace the cardiac function of pumping blood throughout the body, however cases where the heart is either unable to fill with blood or the total blood volume is depleted, this intervention may be ineffective. Additionally, as many of the interventions targeted at specific causes of arrest are centered around procedures performed around the patient&#x27;s chest, head, and neck, compressions may interfere with definitive management.

=== Management of reversible causes ===
=== Future directions ===
Current guidelines tailored to treatment of specific causes of traumatic cardiac arrest have improved outcomes for patients, however these guidelines may be difficult to apply in a standardized manner due to differences in pre-hospital care and the wide variety of causes of traumatic cardiac arrest compared to medical cardiac arrest. Evolving algorithms are directed at quickly identifying incidences of cardiac arrest with a traumatic source and rapidly intervening to address reversible causes.

==Prognosis==
Historically, traumatic cardiac arrest was thought to lead invariably to death. More recently, evolutions of advanced trauma life support guidelines and improved understanding of the underlying causes of traumatic cardiac arrest have improved outcomes for patients. Recent studies suggest that the survival rate for traumatic cardiac arrest is similar to that of all-cause cardiac arrest. There is wide variability in the estimated survival rate based on factors that include initiation of pre-hospital care and nature of injury.

Many patients who survive traumatic cardiac arrest may develop long-term neurological damage resulting from lack of circulation to the nervous system during the arrest. This damage may range from moderate disability to a persistent vegetative state. A 2012 review suggests that while survival rates of traumatic cardiac arrest are higher in children, so is the incidence of neurological complication.

<text>Sergio Alejandro Galván Rey (born 9 June 1973) is an Argentine former footballer who played as a forward. He is the second top goalscorer of the Colombian Categoría Primera A with 224 goals.

==Club career==
Galván Rey&#x27;s first club was Boca Juniors of his native Argentina, where he did not achieve much success. Galván Rey joined Colombian club Once Caldas in 1996, and proceeded to become one of the most dangerous forwards in Colombia. He scored 171 goals in his career with Once Caldas, 160 in the Colombian league, and 11 in 15 Copa Libertadores matches. In 2003, Galván Rey helped Once Caldas to win the Colombian championship, their first in 53 years; additionally, he led the team to achieve Copa Libertadores qualification in 1999, 2002, and 2004.

For the 2004 MLS season, Once Caldas sold Galván Rey to the MetroStars for a transfer fee in the range of half a million dollars. Although he played in 20 games, starting 10, Galván Rey finished the year with only two goals and one assist. Galván Rey&#x27;s previous club, Once Caldas, went on to win the Copa Libertadores in his absence.

In 2005 Galván Rey played better than the previous year, scoring two goals against the Kansas City Wizards to bring the MetroStars back from a 2–0 deficit. By the end of the season, he tallied eight goals in all competitions, which had him tied for the team&#x27;s third leading scorer. However, his salary demands were overwhelming, and the MetroStars decided not to bring Galván Rey back for 2006. He then signed with Atlético Nacional.

In the first half of the 2006 season at Atlético Nacional, Sergio Galván Rey tallied 11 goals. He put his renewed form on display against América de Cali on 21 May scoring five goals in a single match. Galván Rey finished the 2006 campaign with a total of 19 goals. His last goal of the season came on 2 December 2006 against Boyacá Chicó F.C. in a 2–1 win for Nacional.

The 2007 season started well for Galván Rey when he netted a goal in Nacional&#x27;s first match against La Equidad. He managed to tally a total of 13 goals in the first half of the season with his last goal coming during a tournament match against Boyacá Chicó on 10 June 2007. He tallied six more goals through December 2007. He scored two against Cucuta Deportivo on 8 December 2007.

In 2008, Galván Rey started the season with four goals through July. Entering November 2008, he added seven more goals to his season total.

In 2010, Galván Rey joined América de Cali. He started the season only five goals away from becoming the all time scorer in Colombian League history. On 25 April, he became the highest scorer in the Colombian League, surpassing Iván Valenciano as the all time scorer.

In 2011, he joined Independiente Santa Fe and played one season with them, scoring three goals in 23 appearances. He announced his retirement after the season ended.

<doc id="1156396" wikidata="Q451390" url="?curid=1156396" title="Autolycus of Pitane">
<text>Autolycus of Pitane (; c. 360 – c. 290 BC) was a Greek astronomer, mathematician, and geographer. He is known today for his two surviving works &quot;On the Moving Sphere&quot; and &quot;On Risings and Settings&quot;, both about spherical geometry.

== Life ==
Autolycus was born in Pitane, a town of Aeolis within Ionia, Asia Minor. Of his personal life nothing is known, although he was a contemporary of Aristotle and his works seem to have been completed in Athens between 335–300 BC. Euclid references some of Autolycus&#x27; work, and Autolycus is known to have taught Arcesilaus.

The lunar crater Autolycus was named in his honour.

== Work ==

Autolycus&#x27; two surviving works are about spherical geometry with application to astronomy: &quot;On the Moving Sphere&quot; and &quot;On Risings and Settings&quot; (of stars). In late antiquity, both were part of the &quot;Little Astronomy&quot;, a collection of miscellaneous short works about geometry and astronomy which were commonly transmitted together. They were translated into Arabic in the 9th century, and with the addition of a few additional works became known as the &quot;Middle Books&quot; (sitting between Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; and Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot;). Both were preserved both in Greek and in Arabic, but were unknown in medieval Western Europe. They were translated from Arabic into Latin in the 12th century. Later, remaining Greek copies were also translated into Latin.

=== &quot;On the Moving Sphere&quot; ===

&quot;On the Moving Sphere&quot; ( ) concerns the movements of points and arcs on the sphere as it rotates on an axis. While the obvious application is the diurnal motion of the stars as the celestial sphere appears to rotate about an immobile Earth (as modeled at the time), Autolycus&#x27; treatise never explicitly discusses this application: its content consists entirely of elementary theorems about the arcs of great circles and parallel small circles on an abstract sphere. The work is simple and probably derivative of older works, but each theorem includes a clearly enunciated statement, a figure of the construction alongside its proof, and finally a concluding remark.

&quot;On the Moving Sphere&quot; is believed to be the oldest mathematical treatise from ancient Greece that is completely preserved: All prior Greek mathematical works are taken from later summaries, commentaries, or descriptions of the works. It shows that by Autolycus&#x27; day there was a thoroughly established textbook tradition in geometry that is today regarded as typical of classical Greek geometry. Moreover, it gives indications of what theorems were well known in his day (around 320 BC).

Two hundred years later Theodosius wrote the &quot;Spherics&quot;, a treatise establishing the fundamental definitions and constructions in spherical geometry whose content is believed to have a common origin with &quot;On the Moving Sphere&quot; in some pre-Euclidean textbook, possibly written by Eudoxus. In contrast to later astronomical analyses by Hipparchus (2nd century BC) and Ptolemy (2nd century AD), but similarly to the planar geometry of Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;, both Autolycus&#x27;s work and Theodosius&#x27; does not involve concrete quantification or trigonometry: spherical arcs are compared in size, but not given any numerical measure.

=== &quot;On Risings and Settings&quot; ===

In the two-book treatise &quot;On Risings and Settings&quot; ( ), Autolycus studied the relationship between the rising and the setting of the stars throughout the year. The second book is an expansion of the first and of higher quality. He wrote that &quot;any star which rises and sets always rises and sets at the same point in the horizon.&quot; Autolycus relied heavily on Eudoxus&#x27; astronomy and was a strong supporter of Eudoxus&#x27; theory of homocentric spheres.

<text>USS &quot;Corporal&quot; (SS-346), a submarine, was a ship of the United States Navy named for the corporal, an alternate name for the fallfish, found in streams of the eastern United States.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Corporal&quot; was launched 10 June 1945 by Electric Boat Co., Groton, Connecticut, sponsored by Mrs. H. C. Wick; commissioned 9 November 1945, Commander Edward E. Shelby in command; and reported to the Atlantic Fleet.

==Service history==
&quot;Corporal&quot; cleared New London 8 January 1946 for her base at Key West, arriving 25 February. She took part in antisubmarine warfare projects and fleet exercises off Florida and Bermuda and in the Caribbean until returning to Groton 26 February 1947. After extensive modernization, she returned to Key West 2 March 1948.

She continued to conduct training and join in exercises off Florida and in the Caribbean until her first tour of duty in the Mediterranean with the 6th Fleet from 16 July 1952 to 15 October. Returning to local operations off Key West, she also participated in large-scale fleet exercises in the Atlantic and Caribbean. She cruised to the British Isles from 11 March to 16 May 1957, and upon her return to Key West, continued training and services to the Fleet Sonar School. Through 1958 and 1959, she operated frequently in ordnance tests, and from August 1959, when Charleston, South Carolina, became her home port, cruised widely along the east coast. In December 1960 &quot;Corporal&quot; sailed to visit Germany and then join the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean.

USS &quot;Corporal&quot; was converted to a Guppy III configuration and continued to operate throughout the 1960s and early 1970s in various capacities during the Cold War. She made regular &quot;Northern&quot; runs across the Arctic Circle above the North Sea, regular &quot;Mediterranean Cruises&quot;, frequently operated in the Caribbean and trained submarine sailors in conjunction with the Submarine School in New London, Connecticut.

In 1967 USS &quot;Corporal&quot; collided in Rhode Island&#x27;s Block Island Sound with the 30-foot sloop &quot;Medea IV&quot;, whose owner afterward claimed &quot;they never offered us assistance or asked us if we were damaged.&quot;

===Helicopter landing===

During naval exercises off Key West in April 1956, a US Navy Sikorsky H-34 helicopter, serial number 51, made an emergency landing on the &quot;Corporal&quot;″s deck because it experienced serious mechanical problems during an anti-submarine warfare exercise in which the Corporal had been serving as the opposing force. After close cooperation by radio and hasty preparations by the submariners, the distressed helicopter managed to touch down safely aft of the submarine&#x27;s sail. The incident marked &quot;the first time a helicopter made an emergency landing on a submarine.&quot; At the time of that emergency landing, the submarine was under the command of Lieutenant Commander E. O. Proctor, and those aboard the helicopter were Commander W. F. Culley and Lieutenant J. K. Johnson.
== TCG &quot;Ikinci İnönü&quot; (S333) ==

She was decommissioned, struck from the US Naval Register, and transferred (sold) to Turkey, under terms of the Security Assistance Program, 28 November 1973. On 12 February 1974 she was commissioned TCG &quot;Ikinci İnönü&quot; (S333) (&quot;Second İnönü&quot;), the second of three submarines named in honor of the Second Battle of İnönü in the Turkish Independence War.

She was dropped from the Turkish Naval rolls on 2 September 1996, and scrapped. Today, a section of hull containing the stern torpedo tubes is preserved at the Naval Museum at Istanbul.

<text>Jacob Thompson (May 15, 1810 – March 24, 1885) was the United States Secretary of the Interior, who resigned on the outbreak of the American Civil War and became the Inspector General of the Confederate States Army.

In 1864, Jefferson Davis asked Thompson to lead a delegation to Canada, where he appears to have been leader of the Confederate Secret Service. From here, he is known to have organised many anti-Union plots and was suspected of many more, including a possible meeting with Lincoln&#x27;s assassin, John Wilkes Booth.

Union troops burned down his mansion in Oxford, Mississippi, the hometown of William Faulkner, who based some of his fictional characters on Thompson.

==Early life==

Born in Leasburg, North Carolina in 1810 to Nicolas Thompson and Lucretia (van Hook) Thompson, Thompson attended Bingham Academy in Orange County, North Carolina and later went on to graduate from the University of North Carolina in 1831, where he was a member of the Philanthropic Society. Afterwards, he served on the university faculty for a short time until he left to study law in 1832. He was admitted to the bar in 1834 and established a law practice in Pontotoc, Mississippi in 1837, and made an unsuccessful bid to become the state attorney general.
=== Congressional years ===
Thompson&#x27;s involvement in politics began in earnest as he was elected to the 26th Congress, serving through to the 31st Congress (1849–1851).

He was appointed to the United States Senate in 1845 but never received the commission, and the seat went to Joseph W. Chalmers. Thompson was the chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs in the 29th Congress. He lost reelection to the 32nd Congress and went back to practicing law in Mississippi. In 1853, when President Franklin Pierce offered him to become a U.S Consul to Havana he refused it. Thompson lost the 1855 senate election to Jefferson Davis, but in 1857, newly elected President James Buchanan appointed Thompson United States Secretary of the Interior from 1857 to 1861.

In the later years of the Buchanan administration, the cabinet members argued with one another on issues of slavery and secession. In an 1859 speech, Thompson advanced a moderate unionist position. He denounced Republicans in the North who spoke of the slavery issue as an &quot;irrepressible conflict&quot; and Southern extremists who favored reopening the Atlantic slave trade.

===Alignment with Confederacy===
While still serving as Interior Secretary, Thompson was appointed by the state of Mississippi as a &quot;secession commissioner&quot; to North Carolina and tasked to convince that state to secede from the Union in the wake of the 1860 presidential election. On December 17, he passed through Baltimore on the way to North Carolina. &quot;Secretary Thompson has entered openly into the secession service, while professing still to serve the Federal authority,&quot; the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported on December 20. The next day, Thompson met with Governor John W. Ellis in Raleigh. He wrote an open letter to Ellis which was published in the &quot;Raileigh State Journal&quot; on December 20. Thompson wrote that the South faced &quot;common humiliation and ruin&quot; if it remained in the Union. He warned that a Northern &quot;majority trained from infancy to hate our people and their institutions&quot; would overthrow slavery. The result would be &quot;the subjugation of our people.&quot;

Thompson resigned as Interior Secretary in January 1861. When he resigned, Horace Greeley&#x27;s &quot;New-York Daily Tribune&quot; denounced him as &quot;a traitor&quot;, remarking, &quot;Undertaking to overthrow the Government of which you are a sworn minister may be in accordance with the ideas of cotton-growing chivalry, but to common men cannot be made to appear creditable.&quot;

Thompson became Inspector General of the Confederate States Army. Though not a military man, Thompson later joined the army as an officer and served as an aide to General P.G.T. Beauregard at the Battle of Shiloh.

He attained the rank of lieutenant colonel and was present at several other battles in the Western Theater of the war, including Corinth, Vicksburg, and Tupelo.

===Commissioner in Canada===

In March 1864, Jefferson Davis asked Thompson to lead a secret delegation in Canada. He accepted and arrived in Montreal in May of that year. Thompson appears to have been the leader of Confederate Secret Service operations in Canada.

From there, he directed a failed plot to free Confederate prisoners of war on Johnson&#x27;s Island, off Sandusky, Ohio, in September. He also arranged the purchase of a steamer, with the intention of arming it to harass shipping in the Great Lakes. Regarded in the North as a schemer and conspirator, many devious plots were associated with his name, though much of this may have been public hysteria.

On June 13, 1864, Thompson met with former New York Governor Washington Hunt at Niagara Falls. According to the testimony of the Peace Democrat Clement Vallandigham, Hunt met Thompson, talked to him about creating a Northwestern Confederacy, and obtained money for arms, which was routed to a subordinate. Thompson gave Benjamin Wood, the owner of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, money to purchase arms.

One plot was a planned burning of New York City on November 25, 1864 in retaliation for Union Generals Philip Sheridan and William Tecumseh Sherman&#x27;s scorched-earth tactics in the South.

Some speculate that John Wilkes Booth, who assassinated Abraham Lincoln, met Thompson, but that has not been proved. (In the years after the war, Thompson worked hard to clear his name of involvement in the assassination.) His manor, called &quot;Home Place,&quot; in Oxford, Mississippi was burned down by Union troops in 1864.

In the spring of 1865, Canadian customs raided a house in Toronto that had been rented by Thompson. They found coal torpedoes and other incendiary devices hidden beneath the floorboards.

==Postwar==
After the Civil War, Thompson fled to England and later returned to Canada as he waited for passions to cool in the United States. He eventually came home and settled in Memphis, Tennessee, to manage his extensive holdings. Thompson was later appointed to the board of the University of the South at Sewanee and was a great benefactor of it.

==Death==
Jacob Thompson died in Memphis, Tennessee and was interred in Elmwood Cemetery. Republicans and Union veterans condemned the Grover Cleveland administration&#x27;s lowering of flags to half-mast in Washington and Secretary of Interior Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar II&#x27;s closure of the Department of Interior to honor Thompson after his death.

<doc id="1156406" wikidata="Q2642862" url="?curid=1156406" title="Streetlights (Bonnie Raitt album)">
<text>Streetlights is the fourth album by Bonnie Raitt, released in 1974.

==Recording and music==
Bonnie Raitt was allotted $10,000 by Warner Bros. Records to record &quot;Streetlights&quot;, which was the least amount of money she had received to record an album. Warner Bros. was unhappy with the lengthy production surrounding her previous album, &quot;Takin&#x27; My Time&quot;, and the company limited her expenses. The two parties eventually agreed on an advance of more money, on the condition Raitt would choose a producer with a history of commercial success. Raitt chose Jerry Ragovoy, who had worked with musicians such as Janis Joplin and Dionne Warwick. Ragovoy felt Raitt&#x27;s music was bogged down by blues music, and wanted to produce an album with a more slick and polished pop sound. Raitt did not like Ragovoy&#x27;s decision, but acquiesced, and &quot;Streetlights&quot; was recorded during mid-1974.

Critics have described &quot;Streetlights&quot; as Raitt&#x27;s first attempt to record music for a mainstream audience. In contrast to the eclectic and laid-back sound of her first three albums, &quot;Streetlights&quot; features simpler arrangements with more string instrumentation, influenced by pop and R&amp;B music. It is Raitt&#x27;s only album in which she does not play the slide guitar. Session musician Freebo said Raitt was negatively affected by the more professional production of &quot;Streetlights&quot;. &quot;The environment changed her singing. She was in a professional world with &quot;Streetlights&quot;, and had to act like one&quot; said Freebo. Nine of the ten tracks on the album are covers of songs by musicians such as Joni Mitchell, James Taylor, and John Prine. The one original track, &quot;Ain&#x27;t Nobody Home&quot;, was written by Ragovoy.

==Release and reception==

&quot;Streetlights&quot; was released in September 1974, by Warner Bros. &quot;Streetlights&quot; reached number eighty on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tapes chart and number 129 on the &quot;Cashbox&quot; Top 100 Albums chart. To support the album, Raitt went on a North American tour with Jackson Browne, from September 13 to November 24. On two stops in Boston and Washington, D.C., Raitt was accompanied by blues musicians Roosevelt Sykes and Sippie Wallace.

<text>Zachary Stephen Wells (born February 26, 1981, in Costa Mesa, California) is an American former professional soccer player who played as a goalkeeper.

==College==
Wells played college soccer at UCLA from 1999 to 2003, where he helped the school to the NCAA Championship as a junior, and was named first-team All-Pac-10 as a senior.

==MLS==
Upon graduating, Wells was selected 21st overall in the 2004 MLS SuperDraft by the MetroStars. He spent much of the season backing up national teamer Jonny Walker, but played two games in mid-season. In 2005, with Walker recovering from surgery, Wells took over the starting role, and played well, leading to Walker&#x27;s trade to Columbus. But the return of Tony Meola to the club left Wells being a backup again. He was traded to Houston for a 4th round pick in the 2006 MLS SuperDraft. He was acquired along with a conditional draft pick by D.C. United for Bobby Boswell on December 12, 2007. 

Wells announced his retirement from professional soccer on February 17, 2009, just a month before the start of the 2009 MLS season.

==National team==
Wells earned his only cap for the U.S. national team on February 19, 2006, in a 4–0 victory over Guatemala at Pizza Hut Park in Frisco, Texas.

==Honors==

<doc id="1156420" wikidata="Q347334" url="?curid=1156420" title="William McMaster Murdoch">
<text>William McMaster Murdoch, RNR (28 February 1873 – 15 April 1912) was a British sailor who served as a Lieutenant in the Royal Navy Reserve and was the first officer on the . He was the officer in charge on the bridge when the &quot;Titanic&quot; collided with an iceberg, and was amongst the 1,500 people who died when the ship sank. The circumstances of his death have been the subject of controversy.

==Early life==
Murdoch was born in Dalbeattie in Kirkcudbrightshire (now Dumfries and Galloway), Scotland, the fourth son of Captain Samuel Murdoch, a master mariner, and Jane Muirhead, six of whose children survived infancy. The Murdochs were a long and notable line of Scottish seafarers; his father and grandfather were both sea captains as were four of his grandfather&#x27;s brothers.

Murdoch was educated first at the old Primary School in High Street, and then at the Dalbeattie High School in Alpine Street until he gained his diploma in 1887. Finishing schooling, he followed in the family seafaring tradition and was apprenticed for five years to &quot;William Joyce &amp; Coy&quot;, Liverpool, but after four years (and four voyages) he was so competent that he passed his second mate&#x27;s Certificate on his first attempt.

==Career==
===Beginnings===
He served his apprenticeship aboard the &quot;Charles Cosworth&quot; of Liverpool, trading to the west coast of South America. From May 1895, he was First Mate on the &quot;St. Cuthbert&quot;, which sank in a hurricane off Uruguay in 1897. Murdoch gained his Extra Master&#x27;s Certificate at Liverpool in 1896, at age 23.

An officer of the Royal Naval Reserve, he was employed by the White Star Line in 1900. From 1900 to 1912, Murdoch gradually progressed from Second Officer to First Officer, serving on a succession of White Star Line vessels, &quot;Medic&quot; (1900, along with Charles Lightoller, &quot;Titanic&quot;″s second officer), &quot;Runic&quot; (1901–1903), &quot;Arabic&quot; (1903), &quot;Celtic&quot; (1904), &quot;Germanic&quot; (1904), &quot;Oceanic&quot; (1905), &quot;Cedric&quot; (1906), &quot;Adriatic&quot; (1907–1911) and &quot;Olympic&quot; (1911–1912).

During 1903, Murdoch finally reached the stormy and glamorous North Atlantic run as Second Officer of the new liner &quot;Arabic&quot;. His cool head, quick thinking and professional judgement averted a disaster when a ship was spotted bearing down on the &quot;Arabic&quot; at night. His superior, Officer Fox, had ordered for the ship to steer &quot;hard-a-port,&quot; but Murdoch rushed into the wheelhouse, brushed aside the quartermaster, and held the ship on course. The two ships barely missed each other by inches.

===&quot;RMS Olympic&quot;===

The final stage of Murdoch&#x27;s career began in May 1911, when he joined the new , at . Not long before, he had shaved his moustache, apparently at his wife&#x27;s prodding. Intended to outclass the Cunard Line ships in luxury and size, it needed the most experienced large-liner crew that the White Star Line could find. Captain Edward J. Smith assembled a crew that included Henry Wilde as Chief Officer, Murdoch as First Officer, and Chief Purser Hugh McElroy. On 14 June 1911 &quot;Olympic&quot; departed on her maiden voyage to New York, with a planned arrival on 21 June.

On 20 September 1911, the &quot;Olympic&quot; collided with the Royal Navy cruiser HMS &quot;Hawke&quot;, badly damaging her hull. Since Murdoch was at his docking-station at the stern - a highly responsible position – he appeared at the incident inquiry and gave evidence. The collision was a major financial loss for the White Star Line as the voyage to New York was abandoned and the ship returned to Belfast for repairs, which took six weeks.

Murdoch returned to the &quot;Olympic&quot; on 11 December 1911, serving in that capacity until March 1912. During that time, there were two further, though lesser, incidents, striking a sunken wreck and needing to have a broken propeller replaced, and nearly running aground while leaving Belfast. Upon arriving in Southampton, Murdoch learned that his next assignment would be the Chief Officer of the &quot;Titanic&quot;, the &quot;Olympic&quot; sister ship, serving under Captain Edward J. Smith. Charles Lightoller later wrote that &quot;three very contented chaps&quot; headed north to Belfast, for he had been appointed First Officer, and their friend David Blair was set to be Second Officer. Awaiting them would be Joseph Groves Boxhall, as Fourth Officer, who had worked with Murdoch on the &quot;Adriatic&quot;.

===&quot;RMS Titanic&quot;===

Murdoch, with an &quot;ordinary master&#x27;s certificate&quot; and a reputation as a &quot;canny and dependable man&quot;, had climbed through the ranks of the White Star Line to become one of its foremost senior officers. Murdoch was originally given the title Chief Officer for &#x27;s maiden voyage. On March 27, 1912, the ship&#x27;s four junior officers came aboard and reported to Murdoch. Murdoch ordered Fifth Officer Lowe and Sixth Officer Moody to inspect the starboard-side lifeboats and to make sure their equipment was complete; he ordered Third Officer Pitman and Fourth Officer Boxhall to do likewise with the port-side lifeboats. However, almost as soon as the ship had tied up in Southampton, the captain, Edward Smith, brought Henry Wilde in as his Chief Officer (from a prior assignment), so Murdoch became the First Officer. Charles Lightoller was in turn reduced to Second Officer, and the original Second Officer, David Blair, would not sail with &quot;Titanic&quot; at all. When the ship began her maiden voyage on 10 April, Murdoch was on the Poop Deck, in charge of the mooring lines, being assisted by Third Officer Pitman. As the ship went out into the Atlantic, Murdoch took the 10:00-2:00 watches every mid-day and night. It was his responsibility to draw up the list of boat assignments, and he followed through on this promptly after departing Southampton. 

On 14 April 1912, Murdoch had the10:00 a.m. to 2:00p.m. watch on the bridge. However, the officers&#x27; lunch was served at 12:30. Lightoller returned to the bridge at that time to relieve Murdoch and let him grab a quick bite to eat. Murdoch did not return until 1:00–1:05p.m.. When Murdoch returned from his lunch, Lightoller mentioned that Captain Smith had given him a message regarding ice. Murdoch showed no overt surprise, but Lightoller was under the impression that the subject was new to the First Officer, just as it had been to him. Dinner for the officers was served at 6:30p.m. in the Officers&#x27; Mess. Murdoch, then off duty, had taken the opportunity to have his meal. Then he headed up to the bridge, arriving at 7:05p.m.. Upon arrival, he took the watch for a half-hour so that Lightoller could have his own dinner. At about 7:15, Lamp Trimmer Samuel Hemming arrived on the bridge and reported to Murdoch that all the lights had been set for the evening. Murdoch told him to get &quot;the fore-scuttle hatch closed, there is a glow left from that, as we are in the vicinity of ice, and I want everything dark before the bridge.&quot; Murdoch was keenly aware that ice was near, and he was being particularly careful to ensure that nothing interfered with the night vision of the lookouts and officers. Lightoller returned from dinner to resume his watch. Murdoch remarked to him that the temperature had dropped another four degrees. Murdoch departed the bridge, and later relieved Lightoller at 10:00p.m.. Lightoller conveyed to Murdoch the ship&#x27;s course and the ice field that they were approaching, and that they expected to be in the vicinity of the ice somewhere around 11:00. Lightoller wished Murdoch &quot;joy of his Watch&quot; and departed the bridge. 

At approximately 11:39pm on 14 April 1912, First Officer Murdoch was in charge when a large iceberg was sighted directly in the &quot;Titanic&quot;″s path. Lookout Fredrick Fleet rang the warning bell three times. It is likely that Murdoch had already seen the iceberg, and as soon as Officer Moody relayed Fleet&#x27;s warning, &quot;Iceberg right ahead!&quot;, Murdoch &quot;rushed&quot; from the bridge wing to the bridge. Quartermaster Robert Hichens, who was at the helm, and Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall, who had heard the warning bell and had come from the officers&#x27; quarters behind the bridge, heard Murdoch&#x27;s order to turn the helm &quot;Hard-a-starboard&quot;, a tiller command which would turn the ship to port (left) by moving the tiller to starboard (right). At the time, steering instructions on British ships generally followed the way tillers on sailing vessels are operated, with turns in the opposite direction from the commands. As Walter Lord noted in &quot;The Night Lives On&quot;, this did not fully change to the &quot;steering wheel&quot; system of commands in the same directions as turns until 1924. This has led to rumours that Murdoch&#x27;s orders were misinterpreted by the helmsman, resulting in a turn the wrong way.

Fourth Officer Boxhall testified that Murdoch set the ship&#x27;s telegraph to &quot;Full Astern&quot;, but Greaser Frederick Scott and Leading Stoker Frederick Barrett testified that the stoking indicators went from &quot;Full&quot; to &quot;Stop&quot;. During or immediately before the collision, Quartermaster Alfred Olliver (who was walking on to the bridge during the collision) testified that he heard Murdoch give the order &quot;Hard a&#x27;port&quot; (moving the tiller all the way to the port (left) side turning the ship to starboard (right)) in what may have been an attempt to swing the aft section of the ship away from the iceberg in a manoeuvre called a &quot;port around&quot; (this could explain his comment to the captain &quot;I intended to port around it&quot;). The fact that this manoeuvre was executed was supported by other crew members who testified that the stern of the ship never hit the iceberg. The orders that Murdoch gave to avoid the iceberg are debated. According to Oliver, Murdoch ordered the helm &quot;hard to port&quot; to ward off the stern of the iceberg. Hichens and Boxhall made no mention of the order. However, since the stern avoided the iceberg, it is likely that the order was given and carried out.

Despite these efforts, the ship made its fatal collision about 37 seconds after the iceberg had been sighted, opening the first six compartments. After the collision, Murdoch raced towards the watertight door controls, in the open bridge, and signalled the alarm below. Murdoch then told quartermaster Olliver to &quot;take the time, and told one of the junior officers to make a note&quot; in the logbook. Captain Smith came on to the bridge, asking Murdoch &quot;What have we struck?&quot; Murdoch told what happened and affirmed that the watertight doors were shut and the warning bell had rung. Smith, Murdoch and Boxhall walked out on to the starboard bridge wing, trying to spot the iceberg. 

Murdoch was put in charge of the starboard evacuation, during which he launched ten lifeboats. Seaman Buley remembered an order from Murdoch for the &quot;seamen to get together and uncover the boats and turn them out as quietly as though nothing had happened&quot;. Pitman joined Murdoch in helping and was ordered to start working on Boat No. 5. Murdoch was hard at work on Boat No. 7; when lookout George Hogg worked with him, Murdoch told him to step into the boat. Murdoch ordered Steward Etches to get into Boat No. 5 and assist the men with the forward fall. Murdoch told Pitman to take charge of the boat. He shook his hand and said, &quot;Goodbye, good luck to you.&quot; Pitman, who at that time did not expect the ship to sink, later felt that Murdoch had not expected to see him again. Lightoller later recalled that Wilde had apparently talked to Murdoch about where the firearms were, but Murdoch had no clue where they were, due to the re-shuffling of senior officers at Southampton. Lightoller led Wilde, Smith and Murdoch to the cabin, where he brought out the box of revolvers. Murdoch placed able-bodied seaman George Moore in charge of Boat. No. 3. He then began working at Lifeboat #1, where he allowed Sir Cosmo Duff-Gordon; his wife Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon; her secretary, Mabel Francatelli; Abraham Salomon; and C. E. Henry Stengel to get in. As Stengel climbed in, he rolled over the teak top-rail and into the boat. Murdoch laughed heartily, saying, &quot;That is the funniest sight I have seen to-night.&quot; At Boat No. 9, Murdoch, a number of stewards and other members of the victualling department were passing women and children over from the port side to fill up the boat. He fired warning shots at Collapsible C during the loading process in order to prevent a group of men swarming the Collapsible. Murdoch perished in the disaster and his body was never recovered.

==Personal life==
===Family and marriage===

In 1903, Murdoch met a 29-year-old New Zealand school teacher named Ada Florence Banks en route to England on either the &quot;Runic&quot; or the &quot;Medic&quot;. They began to correspond regularly. On 2 September 1907 they were wed in Southampton at St Denys Church. The marriage register entry was witnessed by Captain William James Hannah and his wife, and the addresses given by the bride and groom suggest they were lodging with the Hannahs. Captain Hannah came from a family of seafarers with roots in Kircudbrightshire like Murdoch, and was Assistant Marine Superintendent for the White Star Line at Southampton. Hannah would see Murdoch for the last time when he witnessed the testing of lifeboats before &quot;Titanic&quot; departed from Southampton on 10 April 1912.

===Death===
Several eyewitnesses, including Third Class Passenger Eugene Daly and First Class passenger George Rheims, claimed to have seen an officer shoot one or two men during a rush for a lifeboat, then shoot himself. It was rumoured that Murdoch was the officer. 
In a letter to Murdoch&#x27;s widow, Second Officer Lightoller denied the rumours, writing that he saw Murdoch working on the falls to Collapsible A when he was swept overboard when the ship began her final plunge. However, Lightoller&#x27;s testimony at the U.S. inquiry suggests that he was not in a position to witness Murdoch being swept overboard. It is also possible that Lightoller may have wanted to conceal the suicide, if it occurred, from Murdoch&#x27;s widow. Later in life, according to a family friend, Lightoller reportedly admitted that someone did die by suicide in the disaster. Additionally, James O. McGiffin, son of Captain James McGiffin (a close personal friend of Murdoch), said that Lightoller had told his father that Murdoch had shot a man.

An officer&#x27;s suicide was portrayed in the 1996 miniseries &quot;Titanic&quot; and the 1997 film &quot;Titanic&quot; each portraying Murdoch as the participant. When Murdoch&#x27;s nephew Scott saw the 1997 film, he objected to the portrayal as damaging to Murdoch&#x27;s heroic reputation. Film executives later flew to Murdoch&#x27;s hometown to apologize. The film&#x27;s director, James Cameron, said that the depiction was not meant to be negative, and added, &quot;I&#x27;m not sure you&#x27;d find that same sense of responsibility and total devotion to duty today. This guy had half of his lifeboats launched before his counterpart on the port side had even launched one. That says something about character and heroism.&quot;

Author Tim Maltin writes that, although the evidence is circumstantial, &quot;it does seem that an officer did shoot himself and Murdoch seems the most likely candidate. As Titanic experts Bill Wormstedt and Tad Fitch point out, Murdoch was the man directly in charge of the ship in the hours leading up to the collision with the iceberg and he was therefore responsible for the ship and all its passengers during that time. His career at sea was effectively over, even if he survived the disaster&quot;.

==Legacy==

Shortly after the sinking of the &quot;Titanic&quot;, the &quot;New York Herald&quot; published a story about Rigel, a dog reportedly owned by Murdoch who saved some of the survivors from the sinking. While the story was widely reproduced, contemporary analyses cast doubt on whether the dog actually existed.

In Murdoch&#x27;s hometown of Dalbeattie, a memorial fund was created for the High School. Residents of the town objected to the depiction of Murdoch in the 1997 film &quot;Titanic&quot; and requested an apology. In April 1998, representatives from the film studio Twentieth Century Fox presented a £5,000 cheque for the memorial fund, but did not offer a formal apology. The film&#x27;s director, James Cameron, said that his depiction of Murdoch was not meant to be negative. In 2004, he tentatively said that &quot;it was probably a mistake&quot; to portray a specific person and could understand the family&#x27;s objections.

In April 2012, Premier Exhibitions announced that it had identified Murdoch&#x27;s belongings from a prior expedition to the wreck of the &quot;Titanic&quot; in 2000. There was a toiletry kit with Murdoch&#x27;s initials embossed on it, a spare White Star Line officer&#x27;s button, a straight razor, a shoe brush, a smoking pipe, and a pair of long johns. The items were recovered by David Concannon, Ralph White and Anatoly Sagalevitch diving in the Russian submersible &quot;Mir 1&quot; in July 2000.

<text>The New York University Tisch School of the Arts (commonly referred to as Tisch) is the performing, cinematic, and media arts school of New York University.

Founded on August 17, 1965, as the School of the Arts at New York University, Tisch is a training ground for artists, scholars of the arts, and filmmakers. The school is divided into three Institutes: Performing Arts, Emerging Media, and Film &amp; Television. Many undergraduate and graduate disciplines are available for students, including acting, dance, drama, performance studies, design for stage and film, musical theatre writing, photography, record producing, game design and development, and film and television studies.

The school also offers an inter-disciplinary &quot;collaborative arts&quot; program, high school programs, continuing education in the arts for the general public, as well as the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music, which teaches entrepreneurial strategies in the music recording industry. A dual MFA/MBA graduate program is also offered, allowing students to take coursework at both Tisch and NYU&#x27;s Stern School of Business. It is located at 721 Broadway (the intersection of Broadway and Waverly Place), adjacent to the university&#x27;s Department of Philosophy building and the Gallatin School of Individualized Study, in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Lower Manhattan, New York City. In 2013, NYU opened a new technology hub on its Brooklyn campus called the Media and Games Network (MAGNET). Located at 2 MetroTech Center and, beginning in 2019, 370 Jay Street, MAGNET houses three Tisch programs: the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music, the Interactive Telecommunications/Interactive Media Arts programs (ITP &amp; IMA), and the Game Center; these programs work in collaboration with departments in media technology from NYU&#x27;s Tandon School of Engineering and Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development.

As of 2019, 22 Academy Award winners, 17 Emmy Award winners, 12 Tony Award winners, and 4 Grammy Award winners have been affiliated with Tisch alumni and faculty. , the school had more than 25,000 alumni working in the arts and related professions, and the school has more alumni in Broadway theatre than any other school for theater in the United States.

==History==
The School of the Arts at New York University was founded on August 17, 1965, to provide conservatory training in theater and film in the context of a research university. The school created additional departments such as dance, theatre design, and cinema studies within a few years. Following the creation of the undergraduate Department of Drama in 1974, the school expanded to include the Interactive Telecommunications Program, Department of Dramatic Writing, Department of Performance Studies, Graduate Musical Theatre Writing Program, Department of Photography and Imaging, and The Department of Art and Public Policy.

In 1982, the school&#x27;s second dean, David Oppenheim, solicited a donation from Laurence A. and Preston Robert Tisch that made possible the acquisition and renovation of the location at 721 Broadway where most of the school&#x27;s programs are housed. In recognition of the generosity of the Tisch family, the school was renamed Tisch School of the Arts in 1982.

==Departments and programs==

Tisch School of the Arts has three institutes and 16 programs and offers the Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA), Bachelor of Arts (BA), Master of Fine Arts (MFA), Master of Arts (MA), Master of Professional Studies (MPS), and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degrees. Tisch also offers a selection of classes to NYU students not enrolled in any of its programs through the Open Arts curriculum.

The three institutes are:
* The Institute of Performing Arts, including the Art &amp; Public Policy, Dance, Design for Stage &amp; Film, Drama, Graduate Acting, Graduate Musical Theatre Writing, Open Arts, and Performance Studies.
* The Maurice Kanbar Institute of Film &amp; Television, including Cinema Studies and its flagship Moving Image Archiving and Preservation (MIAP) program founded by Howard Besser, the Goldberg Department of Dramatic Writing, Graduate Film, and Undergraduate Film &amp; Television.
* The Institute of Emerging Media, including the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music, ITP/IMA, Photography &amp; Imaging, and NYU Game Center.

The school also offers an inter-disciplinary &quot;collaborative arts&quot; program, as well as the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music (founded by Arista Records CEO Clive Davis), one of the few programs in the US to combine musical arts and business strategies in the recording industry. A dual MFA/MBA graduate program is also offered, allowing students to take coursework at both Tisch and NYU&#x27;s Stern School of Business. It also offers high school programs (the &quot;Tisch Summer High School Program&quot; and &quot;Spring Future Artists Programs&quot;) as an outgrowth of the undergraduate classes, and professional courses for the general public as part of a commitment to continuing education in the arts.

==Tisch School of the Arts, Asia==
NYU&#x27;s first branch campus abroad was the result of a partnership with Singapore Government agencies under Singapore&#x27;s &quot;Global Schoolhouse&quot; program. Tisch Asia was also Singapore&#x27;s first graduate arts school and offered Master of Fine Arts degrees in animation and digital arts, dramatic writing, film, and international media producing. Summer programs included professional workshops and non-credit certificate courses. The campus opened in fall 2007 on the former Ministry of Education &amp; Republic Polytechnic grounds at 3 Kay Siang Road, Singapore, with the intention to enroll approximately 250 students.

The anticipated enrollment figures were not achieved, financial losses and embezzlement were alleged and Tisch Asia President Pari Sara Shirazi was dismissed from her post by NYU in November 2011. She subsequently lost a lawsuit claiming defamation and breach of contract. The Tisch Asia campus closed in 2014, with polarised recollections, ranging from positive endorsement, to allegations that it had been &quot;an educational scam&quot; in a failed lawsuit brought by three former students.

== COVID-19 ==
During the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, which forced NYU to move academic instruction online, many Tisch students demanded a tuition refund, believing that virtual classes did not adequately meet their academic needs as a school for performing, cinematic, and media arts. In one of many pandemic-related emails, the school&#x27;s dean sent students a video of herself dancing to R.E.M.&#x27;s &quot;Losing My Religion&quot;, intended to raise community spirit. After hearing from students, the dean further clarified that individual schools have no control over tuition and that it was &quot;challenging&quot; for the university to give students their money back at the time.

<text>C. J. Brown (born June 15, 1975) is an American soccer coach and former player.

==Early life==
Brown was born Charles James Brown in Eugene, Oregon. He is of African American descent.

==College career==
Brown played college soccer at San Jose State University for four years. He finished with 11 points (5 goals and 1 assist) and was named a two-time All-Conference Player in 1995 and 1996. Out of college, Brown was ignored by MLS, and instead joined the USISL&#x27;s San Francisco Bay Seals between 1995 and 1997.

For the first two years, Brown played as an amateur while the Bay Seals played in USISL Premier League and he was still playing at San Jose. In 1997, the Bay Seals played in the USISL D-3 Pro League and made an improbable run to the U.S. Open Cup semifinals in 1997. His performances made Major League Soccer clubs take notice.

==Club career==
Brown was drafted first overall in the 1998 MLS Supplemental Draft by Chicago. He immediately stepped into the Fire&#x27;s starting lineup and continued there until his retirement at the end of the 2010 season.

In his ten years and beyond in the league, Brown has played in 249 regular season games, first in team history. He has also appeared in 32 playoff games, helping the Fire to the MLS Cup in 1998. Brown has scored four MLS goals in his career (three in the regular season and one in the playoffs). He won the U.S. Open Cup in 1998, 2000, 2003, and 2006.

On October 21, 2010, Brown announced he would retire following the Fire&#x27;s season finale two days later at Chivas USA which the team went on to win 4–1. Brown retired as the club&#x27;s last remaining &quot;Fire Original&quot;, and the all-time leader in competitive appearances (372), starts (364) and minutes (32,538). Brown sits behind only Jaime Moreno (415) and Cobi Jones (392) for most competitive appearances for one MLS team.

He also won the Chicago Fire/USSF Humanitarian of the Year from 2001 through 2003 for his efforts in his community.

On May 9, 2012, Brown was inducted into the Chicago Fire&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

==International career==
After emerging from soccer obscurity, Brown amassed 15 caps with the United States national team, his first coming on November 6, 1998, against Australia. He played in the US&#x27;s third-place finish at the 1999 FIFA Confederations Cup, when he was involved in one of the biggest surprises for the U.S. during the tournament, playing 90 min. on July 2 vs. Germany, in the U.S.&#x27;s 2–0 win. He also appeared in two games for the U.S. in the 2000 Gold Cup, playing 18 min. as a second-half sub on February 16 vs. Peru – a 1–0 win – and on February 2, as the Americans downed Haiti 3–0, he also participated in the Olympic Festival in 1994 and 1995.

==Coaching career==
On January 18, 2010, Brown was hired as an assistant head coach for Real Salt Lake. He would assume the vacancy left by Robin Fraser, who left the club to coach Chivas USA. On December 11, 2013, Brown was named assistant coach of the Chicago Fire, where he won an MLS Cup as a player in 1998. After almost a year he moved to expansion club New York City FC on December 1, 2014, rejoining Jason Kreis, who he had worked under at Real Salt Lake.

On November 2, 2015, New York City FC, disappointed with not making the 2015 MLS Cup Playoffs, announced they had parted ways with Head Coach Jason Kreis as well as Brown and assistant Miles Joseph after just one year of management and would be looking for a new head coach for the following season.

On July 10, 2018, the New York Red Bulls announced that Brown would be joining newly appointed head coach Chris Armas&#x27; staff as an assistant.

On February 2, 2021, Brown was announced as the first technical director and head coach for Chicago House AC, a new professional soccer team in the National Independent Soccer Association. Later that year on March 11, Brown was announced as an assist coach for the United States men&#x27;s national under-23 soccer team ahead of the 2020 CONCACAF Men&#x27;s Olympic Qualifying Championship.

Brown rejoined the Fire on December 20, 2021, as a member of head coach Ezra Hendrickson&#x27;s coaching staff. In January 2024 Brown left the Fire coaching staff for a new grassroots role with the club.

==Personal life==
Brown married wife Kim on October 22, 2000, the day after winning the 2000 U.S. Open Cup Championship. The couple welcomed their first daughter, Canessa Brown on February 24, 2004. Their second daughter, Kali Brown was born exactly one year later, on February 24, 2005.

<doc id="1156427" wikidata="Q1371733" url="?curid=1156427" title="Keiji Fujiwara">
<text>was a Japanese actor and voice actor.

His best known works are voicing Shinnosuke&#x27;s father Hiroshi Nohara in the long-running anime series &quot;Crayon Shin-chan&quot;, Maes Hughes in &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist&quot;, Holland Novak in &quot;Eureka Seven&quot;, Axel in &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;, Leorio in &quot;Hunter × Hunter&quot;, Shiro Fujimoto in &quot;Blue Exorcist&quot;, Shingo Shoji in Initial D, Zenzo Hattori in Gintama, and Esidisi in &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure: Battle Tendency&quot;.

In the live-action field, he was most known for dubbing actor Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man/Tony Stark.

Fujiwara founded his own talent management and production company, Air Agency, in 2006.

== Biography ==
Fujiwara was born in Tokyo. He spent the majority of his childhood in Iwate Prefecture. In high school, he handled vocals in a band he formed with his friend Kotaro Furuichi, future guitarist of rock band The Collectors.

Around 18, he moved back to Tokyo on his own and joined the Bungakuza acting school. He spent the 1980s performing in several theater troupes while working odd jobs. Fujiwara was introduced to his first voice acting agency, Ken Production, in the early 1990s. The first TV anime in which he appeared as a regular was &quot;Yokoyama Mitsuteru Sangokushi&quot;, but his breakout role was Hiroshi Nohara in &quot;Crayon Shin-chan&quot;.

In November 2006, he left Ken Production and founded his own agency, Air Agency. Aside from talent management, the company went on to release original drama and situation CDs through its child company Air Label, as well as produce live events. In 2010, Fujiwara made his own sound directorial debut in &quot;Kakkokawaii Sengen!&quot;

Fujiwara was a regular lecturer at the Japan Newart College since 2008.

== Illness and death ==
In August 2016, Fujiwara was diagnosed with an unspecified illness, even though he continued to work for Air Agency and various dubbing for long as he was able to undergo medical treatment. He officially resumed work in June 2017. Fujiwara died at the Tokyo Medical Hospital from cancer on April 12, 2020, aged 55 years old.

<text>Worcestershire County Cricket Club is one of eighteen first-class county clubs within the domestic cricket structure of England and Wales. It represents the historic county of Worcestershire. Its Vitality Blast T20 team has been rebranded the Worcestershire Rapids, but the county is known by most fans as &#x27;the Pears&#x27;. The club is based at New Road, Worcester. Founded in 1865, Worcestershire held minor status at first and was a prominent member of the early Minor Counties Championship in the 1890s, winning the competition three times. In 1899, the club joined the County Championship and the team was elevated to first-class status. Since then, Worcestershire have played in every top-level domestic cricket competition in England except the 1919 County Championship.

==History==
===Earliest cricket===
Cricket may have been played in Worcestershire during the 18th century, however the earliest reference to cricket in the county is 1829 and the county cricket club was not formed until 1865.

A match on 28 August 1844 at Hartlebury Common between Worcestershire and Shropshire is the earliest known instance of a county team in Worcestershire. Two years later, XXII of Worcestershire played William Clarke&#x27;s All-England Eleven at Powick Hams.

===Origin of the club===
Worcestershire CCC was formed on 4 March 1865 at the &quot;Star Hotel&quot; (now the Whitehouse) in Worcester.

The club owes much to Paul Foley who was from a family of iron masters in Stourbridge. He also owned an agricultural estate at Stoke Edith in Herefordshire. He became involved with the club in the 1880s and helped to establish the Minor Counties Championship which began in 1895. Worcestershire shared the inaugural title with Durham and Norfolk before winning outright in 1896, 1897 and 1898.

With this success behind it, the club applied for first-class status and entered the County Championship in 1899. Worcestershire CCC played its initial first-class match &quot;versus&quot; Yorkshire CCC on 4, 5 &amp; 6 May 1899.

===The first-class county===
The inclusion of Worcestershire increased the County Championship to 15 teams. At first they performed moderately despite the superb batting of Tip Foster, who could rarely play after 1901. Weak bowling on perfect New Road pitches was responsible for this, but in 1907 when Tip Foster played regularly for three months their batting, considering the difficulty of the pitches, was among the finest of any county team. Their best performance that year was an innings of 567 on a somewhat difficult pitch against Fielder and Blythe of Kent CCC. After that year, however, the batting was never strong enough to make up for woefully weak bowling.

Worcestershire were so weak the club could not compete in the Championship in 1919, and their form in 1920 – when they lost &quot;three successive games by an innings and over 200 runs&quot; – was probably the worst of any county side. Their form, with one remarkable exception, was woeful up to the early thirties. Fred Root, one of the first exponents of leg theory bowling, took over 1,500 wickets for the county and was a Test standard player in an otherwise fourth-rate team. In Cyril Walters and the Nawab of Pataudi the team acquired its first class batsmen since the Fosters, but both had to give up the game after playing brilliantly in 1933 – when the bowling was briefly very weak.

The emergence of Dick Howorth and Reg Perks in the 1930s, however, was built up so well that by 1947 Worcestershire were sufficiently strong in bowling to be competitive at county level even if their batting was not adequate for high honours. Roly Jenkins, with 183 wickets in 1949, gave them briefly the best attack in county cricket, but they soon declined again and their form in the 1950s was indifferent at best.

Their first period of great success came in the 1960s under the Presidency of Sir George Dowty and the captaincy of Don Kenyon, when the county won two County Championships thanks to the achievements of such players as Norman Gifford, Tom Graveney, Jack Flavell, Len Coldwell and Basil D&#x27;Oliveira. They were also losing finalist in the first ever Gillette Cup Final in 1963 – the inaugural limited overs knockout competition in England. 

In 1971 Worcestershire won their first, and only, Sunday League title thanks largely to the bowling of Vanburn Holder. Along with the runs of New Zealander Glenn Turner, the Barbadian’s 87 wickets was also instrumental in winning Worcestershire&#x27;s third championship win in 1974. In the 1980s, the prodigious batting feats of Graeme Hick and the arrival of Ian Botham paved the way for two more county titles in 1988 and 1989 – the same year in which they beat the touring Australians inside two days. Worcestershire also won the Sunday League in 1987 and 1988.

Worcestershire&#x27;s success continued into the 1990s, with a first ever success in the Benson and Hedges Cup in 1991, following final defeats in 1973, 1976 and 1990. Captained by Phil Neale, the Pears beat Lancashire by 65 runs in the final at Lord&#x27;s, gaining revenge for defeat against Lancashire in the previous year&#x27;s competition. Worcestershire&#x27;s next title came in 1994 when they won the Natwest Trophy, beating arch-rivals Warwickshire in the final. Not only did they avenge their defeat at the hands of Warwickshire in the B&amp;H Cup Final earlier that summer but it was also their first success in the competition after three previous final defeats. Worcestershire&#x27;s best showing in the County Championship came in 1993 when they finished second to Middlesex. Worcestershire finished 15th in 1999, the final year of single division County Championship cricket, meaning they would start the new millennium in Division Two.

===The modern day (2000–present)===
Worcestershire failed to gain promotion in 2000, despite overseas signing Glenn McGrath taking 76 Championship wickets at an average of 13.77. In 2003, Worcestershire were promoted to County Championship Division One for the first time after winning the Division Two title. Worcestershire also reached the final of the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester trophy, beating Lancashire in a memorable semi-final at New Road on 9 August 2003. There was disappointment in the Lord&#x27;s final, though, as Worcestershire lost by seven wickets and the Pears were also relegated from Division One of the National League. 2004 was a yo-yo year with Worcestershire relegated in the County Championship, promoted back to Division One in the rebranded totesport League and losing finalists again in the C&amp;G Trophy. Vikram Solanki scored centuries in both the semi-final win against Warwickshire and the final against Gloucestershire, but the &#x27;Gladiators&#x27; won by eight wickets at Lord&#x27;s.

In 2006, Worcestershire won promotion to the first division of the Championship on the last day of the season by beating Northamptonshire while their rivals for second promotion spot, Essex, lost to Leicestershire. However, their 2007 season began badly, including an innings-and-260-run loss to Yorkshire, Worcestershire&#x27;s worst innings defeat since 1934.
A flood-hit season inflicted serious financial damage, and on-field results in the Championship gave little cheer as Worcestershire were relegated. However, in the Pro40 First Division things were very different, and victory over Gloucestershire in mid-September brought the title to New Road, the county&#x27;s first trophy since 1994. The feat was all the more remarkable for the fact that every one of Worcestershire&#x27;s games was played away from their New Road home, due to the floods, with &#x27;home&#x27; games played at Edgbaston, Taunton and Kidderminster.

2008 saw Worcestershire promoted back to Division One, despite losing their final game of the season. 2008 was also Graeme Hick&#x27;s last season at Worcestershire, having scored 136 first-class centuries in 25 seasons at New Road. 2009 proved disastrous in first-class cricket, with Worcestershire finishing bottom of the First Division without a single victory, the first time the county had failed to win a Championship match since 1928.

Following a win on the last day of the season against Sussex, Worcestershire were promoted back to Division One in 2010. The following season they avoided relegation for the first time ever, giving them consecutive seasons in Division One. However, at the end of the 2012 season they were relegated back to Division Two. Worcestershire had a mixed campaign in 2013, finished fifth out of nine in Division Two but a bright start to the 2014 saw them second in the table after seven games, following a draw with Surrey in June. Worcestershire returned to Division One for the 2015 season, however their return only lasted one season as they were relegated after picking up only two wins. Worcestershire spent two years back in the second tier, before achieving promotion on 27 September 2017.

Figures show the number of &quot;Worcestershire matches only&quot; played at the grounds listed, and do not include abandoned games. Note that the locations given are current; in some cases grounds now in other counties lie within the traditional boundaries of Worcestershire.

Haden Hill Park in Old Hill, West Midlands, was due to host a Benson &amp; Hedges Cup match in 1988. However, this was abandoned without a ball being bowled and no other senior cricket has been played at the ground, so it is not included in the table.

==Fostershire==

&#x27;Fostershire&#x27; was a name jocularly applied to Worcestershire County Cricket Club in the early part of the 20th century, shortly after the county had achieved first-class status and admission into the English County Championship (in 1899). The name came from the fact that seven brothers from this one family played for Worcestershire during the period 1899–1934, three of whom captained the club at some point. Six of the brothers appeared during the seasons 1908–11.

<text>Julia Ann Louise Munro (née Campbell; June 30, 1942 – June 12, 2019) was a Canadian politician based in Ontario, Canada. She was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1995 until 2018. She represented the riding of York—Simcoe.

==Background==
Julia Ann Louise Campbell was born in Hamilton, Ontario and raised in Toronto, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Toronto. She taught history in secondary school in Markham and Newmarket for 24 years. She served as a department head in one of the high schools of the York Region Board of Education. She and her husband lived on a farm near Sutton where they bred poodles, borzois and pointers.

From 1992 to 1994, she was the president of the Durham—York Progressive Conservative Association.

==Politics==
Munro was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1995 provincial election, defeating incumbent New Democrat Larry O&#x27;Connor in the former Durham—York riding. She was re-elected in the redistributed riding of York North in the 1999 election. The Tories lost the 2003 general election, but Munro was able to retain her seat by a reduced margin. She was re-elected in 2007, 2011 and again in 2014, albeit by her narrowest margin, in the riding of York-Simcoe.

Munro was parliamentary assistant to the premier from 1995 to 1998 in charge of promoting volunteerism and government whip from 1999 to 2001.

In 2002, Munro introduced a private member&#x27;s bill to clamp down on puppy mills. Earlier, the government defeated a similar bill introduced by Liberal Mike Colle that would have licensed dog breeders and given SPCA officials the right to inspect breeding operations. Munro&#x27;s bill introduced standards of care for dog breeding operations but did not call for licences or inspection rights. Critics alleged that Munro was in a conflict of interest when she introduced weaker legislation since she was a dog breeder herself. Colle said, &quot;you don&#x27;t need a licence to be a breeder, you don&#x27;t get inspected. Anyone can claim to be a breeder and you don&#x27;t need any qualifications.&quot; The bill was eventually passed.

She was the party&#x27;s critic for the new Ontario Pension Plan, and in 2014 she was Deputy Opposition House Leader.

In January 2017, she became the longest-serving female MPP in Ontario&#x27;s history.

On March 21, 2017, Munro announced she would not run for her seat again in the 2018 Ontario provincial election after 22 years in the Legislature.

==Personal life==

Munro was married to John and lived in Georgina with their daughter. She taught Barenaked Ladies drummer Tyler Stewart at Huron Heights Secondary School. She died on June 12, 2019, at the age of 76.

<text>Julius Albert Krug (November 23, 1907March 26, 1970) was a politician who served as the United States Secretary of the Interior for the administration of President Harry S. Truman from 1946 until 1949.

==Early life and education==
Krug was born November 23, 1907, in Madison, Wisconsin, to son of Julius J. Krug (1877–1971) and the former Emma M. Korfmacher (1877–1949). Krug graduated from what is now the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1929. 

== Career ==
His first notable jobs were with the Tennessee Valley Authority, where he started working as chief power engineer in 1938, and then manager of power in 1940. In 1941, Krug was promoted to chief of the power branch of the Office of Production Management. After the beginning of World War II, this office became the War Production Board. Krug was promoted to director of the Office of War Utilities in 1943. In April 1944, Krug enlisted in the United States Navy. He was recalled that August to serve as chairman of the War Production Board, where he served until the board&#x27;s dissolution in November 1945.

===Secretary of the Interior===

President Truman nominated Krug for the position of Secretary of the Interior on February 26, and he assumed office on March 18, 1946. As Secretary, Krug opposed lumber companies&#x27; efforts to gain logging rights to huge forests in Washington state, and opposed the building of unnecessary dams. As the administrator of coal mines in the United States, he led failed negotiations between John L. Lewis and mine owners in an attempt to end a nationwide strike by the United Mine Workers of America. 

In 1948, Krug signed a contract whereby the tribe living at the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in North Dakota was forced to sell 155,000 acres of its land for the Garrison Dam and reservoir project in New Town, North Dakota. The reservoir flooded one-quarter of the reservation, destroying the tribal headquarters, the hospital, and 154,000 acres of fertile farm land. George Gillette, chairman of the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nation, commented in 1948:

In August 1949, Krug chaired the 19-member United States Citizens Committee that participated in the United Nations Scientific Conference on Conservation and Utilization of Resources, held at Lake Success, New York. Other members of the committee included Herbert Hoover, Thomas Watson, Howard E. Babcock, and Randolph Greene Pack.

==Later career==
Krug resigned from the cabinet effective on December 1, 1949, and he moved on to the private industry as a utilities consultant in Washington. He also served as the chairman of the board of Brookside Mills, and a cofounded the Volunteer Asphalt Company in the Knoxville, Tennessee.

== Personal life ==
Krug died in Knoxville, Tennessee on March 26, 1970, at the age of 62, and is interred at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia. He and his wife, Margaret Catherine Dean, had two children; a daughter, Marilyn Krug Grether, and a son, James Allen Krug.

== Popular culture ==
Krug&#x27;s affair with Edith Bouvier Beale of Grey Gardens fame is portrayed in the 2009 HBO original film Grey Gardens, where he is portrayed by Daniel Baldwin.

==Media==
Krug is portrayed by actor Daniel Baldwin in the HBO original film &quot;Grey Gardens&quot; (2009).

<doc id="1156447" wikidata="Q9283372" url="?curid=1156447" title="Murder of Bobby Kent">
<text>Bobby Kent (né Khayam; May 12, 1973 – July 14, 1993) was a 20-year-old American man who was murdered by seven people, including his best friend, Martin Joseph &quot;Marty&quot; Puccio Jr (born March 21, 1973) in Weston, Florida. The murder was adapted into the 2001 film &quot;Bully&quot;.

==Events before the murder==
Bobby Kent, the son of Iranian immigrants Fred and Farah Kent (originally surnamed Khayam), attended South Broward High School in the South Florida suburb of Hollywood, Florida. According to Tim Donnelly, who prosecuted all the conspirators for this murder, one attorney described Kent as &quot;like Eddie Haskell. All the parents loved him in the neighborhood, but the kids looked at him a different way.&quot;

Marty Puccio is an Italian-American, and was raised Catholic. Kent and Puccio had known each other since third grade, had lived on the same block in Hollywood, Florida, since that time, and were good friends as teenagers. Bad blood, however, existed between the two. Puccio felt &quot;ill-will and hatred&quot; towards Kent, who would bully and pummel him.

Both sets of parents were wary of the friendship as well. Puccio&#x27;s parents, Martin Sr. and Veronica, were concerned because Marty often returned from being with Kent bleeding or covered in bruises. Fred Kent thought of Puccio as a wayward slacker who had no future (Puccio was a high school dropout) and felt the friendship with his son would destroy the future he was helping him build. Frequent gym-goers, both boys were rumored to use steroids, which, in Kent&#x27;s case, according to testimonial accounts, significantly contributed to his erratic, aggressive behavior.

Kent and Puccio had experimented with making gay porn movies, hoping to distribute them to local shops. Neither Kent nor Puccio actually participated in these movies, but, rather, allegedly directed them and coaxed a Florida man in his 40s to perform on camera. Kent tried to peddle a movie, titled &quot;Rough Boys&quot;, to porn shops across South Florida. None took him up on the offer, due to the poor audio and video quality as well as the lack of any sexual activities in the film beyond the man dancing nude and playing with a dildo.

==Murder==
Toward the beginning of 1993, Puccio (aged 20) began dating Lisa Connelly (aged 18). Frustrated by how much time Puccio spent with Kent (aged 20) as well as Kent&#x27;s treatment of Puccio, Connelly tried to distract Kent from Puccio by setting up her friend Alice &quot;Ali&quot; Willis (aged 17) with Kent. Kent and Willis dated for a few weeks, but she ultimately ended the relationship because he was abusive. In June, Puccio confided to Connelly that Kent had been abusive to him quite often over the years. Connelly tried to convince him to end the friendship, but Puccio seemed hesitant. By this time, Connelly knew she was pregnant with Puccio&#x27;s child (refusing to believe it might be Kent&#x27;s, whom she also had sex with), and was determined to pursue a permanent relationship with Puccio, who to her was &quot;the Impossible Dream, the God of the Beach&quot;.

Allegedly, Connelly decided that Kent needed to be eliminated permanently, and began talking to Puccio and other friends about murdering him. On July 13, 1993, Connelly called Willis and told her that &quot;Bobby Kent was planning to come to Palm Bay, Florida, where Willis was living, to murder her and smother her baby [by a previous relationship], unless she returned to Broward County to date him again.&quot; Willis claimed Connelly asked her to come to Connelly&#x27;s house to discuss murdering Bobby Kent. Willis went to Connelly&#x27;s house and brought two friends, her current boyfriend, Donald Semenec (aged 17), and Heather Swallers (aged 18).

On the night of July 13, 1993, Puccio, Semenec, Swallers, Connelly and Willis met with Kent. Puccio, Semenec, and Swallers became uncomfortable and left. Connelly and Willis decided to lure Kent to a new development under construction, in nearby Weston, with the promise that he would be able to drive Willis&#x27; Mustang 5.0 and have sex with her. Connelly had brought along her mother&#x27;s pistol, intending to kill Kent while he was distracted by sexual activity with Willis, but was unable to go through with shooting him.

Despite the failed attempt, Connelly still wanted Kent dead. Seeking assistance, she contacted a self-proclaimed hitman named Derek Kaufman (aged 20), who had been recommended by a friend of Willis. The group met Kaufman at his home in Rolling Oaks. They wanted him to get a gun so they could kill Kent that night, but Kaufman told them he could not procure a weapon that quickly. Willis, Connelly, Semenec and Swallers then went back to Connelly&#x27;s house and were joined by her cousin, Derek Dzvirko (aged 19). The group continued to discuss their plans, and ultimately decided to go ahead with murdering Kent the next night, with Kaufman&#x27;s assistance.

Late on the night of July 14, 1993, the seven met at Puccio&#x27;s house and finalized their plans. Puccio contacted Kent and convinced him to come out with the group that night, with the promise that they would race their cars and that Willis wanted to have sex with him again. The group assembled their weapons: between them, they had two knives, a lead pipe, and a baseball bat. Around 11:30 p.m., they picked Kent up from his home and headed out to a construction site.

When they arrived at the site, Willis, in accordance with the plan, took Kent off to a secluded spot where they were talking. Swallers joined them there. While she and Willis distracted Kent, Semenec came up and stabbed Kent in the back of the neck with a knife. When Kent asked for Puccio&#x27;s help, Puccio stuck a knife in Kent&#x27;s stomach. Kent yelled out an apology, but Puccio continued to stab him. When Kent tried to flee, Puccio, Semenec, and Derek Kaufman followed him and continued wounding him. Puccio then slit Kent&#x27;s throat and hit his head against the ground. Kaufman then approached and hit Kent in the head with the baseball bat, which was the final blow. After this, Dzvirko, Semenec, Puccio, and Kaufman helped dump Kent&#x27;s body on the edge of the shore of the marsh, in the belief that alligators would eat the decaying body.

== Aftermath ==
In the days following the crime, many of the conspirators confessed to various other people. Connelly confessed to her mother, who contacted her sister, Dzvirko&#x27;s mother. Together, the two mothers called in their brother, Joe Scrima (uncle to the young Connelly and Dzvirko), who had friends in the police department and who they thought would know what to do. Scrima&#x27;s friends put them in touch with Detective Frank Ilarraza of the Broward County Sheriff&#x27;s Office, and a cooperative Dzvirko confessed everything. As proof, he led Ilarraza to Kent&#x27;s body.

==Adjudications==
Of the seven perpetrators, three will be in Florida prisons for life:
*Martin Puccio was found guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder; in August 1995, he was sentenced to death by electrocution, plus a concurrent 30-year sentence for conspiracy. In 1997, the Supreme Court of Florida ruled that Puccio should not be executed due to mitigating factors, so his death sentence was vacated and he was resentenced to life in prison, concurrent with his existing 30-year sentence for conspiracy, with parole eligibility occurring in 25 years. , he remains in custody at the Everglades Correctional Institution, inland from Miami, Florida.
*Donald Semenec was found guilty of second-degree murder, but at his May 1995 sentencing, the judge chose to give him the equivalent of a first-degree murder sentence of life in prison. , he remains in custody at the Okeechobee Correctional Institution, north of Okeechobee, Florida.
*Derek Kaufman was found guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder; in June 1995, he was sentenced to life in prison without parole for 25 years, plus a consecutive 30-year sentence for conspiracy. , he remains in custody at the Marion Correctional Institution, north of Ocala, Florida.

The remaining four perpetrators had all been released from Florida prisons by February 2004:
*Lisa Connelly, who with Alice Willis was the driving force behind the murder conspiracy, provided evidence and was found guilty of second-degree murder and conspiracy to commit aggravated battery with a deadly weapon (a lesser charge than conspiracy to commit murder), but at her July 1995 sentencing, the judge chose to give her the equivalent of a first-degree murder sentence of life in prison, plus a concurrent 5-year sentence for conspiracy. Her sentence was overturned on appeal as unduly harsh, and was reduced in 1998 to 22 years. After having served less than 9 years, she was released in February 2004. As of 2013, she was a certified optician living in Pennsylvania, was married and had a then-6-year-old child, in addition to her then-19-year-old daughter with Puccio, who was born while Connelly and Puccio were both in jail pending their murder and conspiracy trials.
*Alice Willis, who with Lisa Connelly was the driving force behind the murder conspiracy, was found guilty of second-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder; in May 1995, she was sentenced to 40 years in prison, plus a concurrent 15-year sentence for conspiracy. The murder sentence was reduced on appeal to 17 years, to be followed by 40 years of probation. After having served less than 7 years, she was released in September 2001. As of 2013, she was a homemaker and parent living in Florida.
*Derek Dzvirko, who led police to Kent&#x27;s body and provided other evidence, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder; in May 1995, he was sentenced to concurrent terms of 11 years in prison. After having served less than 5 years, he was released in October 1999. As of 2013, he was a former long-haul truck driver who had settled in Missouri in 2009 as a single parent to raise his daughter.
*Heather Swallers, who cooperated with police and provided evidence, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder; in May 1995, she was sentenced to concurrent terms of 7 years in prison. After having served less than 3 years, she was released in February 1998. As of 2013, she was living in Georgia.

==In popular culture==
Jim Schutze, a reporter with the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot;, wrote the 1997 best-selling true crime book &quot;Bully: A True Story of High School Revenge&quot;.

The book was adapted by David McKenna (credited under the pseudonym &quot;Zachary Long&quot;, after he demanded his name be removed from the film) and Roger Pullis into the 2001 film &quot;Bully&quot;, directed by Larry Clark. In the film, Kent was portrayed by Nick Stahl, Puccio was portrayed by Brad Renfro, Willis was portrayed by Bijou Phillips, Connelly was portrayed by Rachel Miner, Semenec was portrayed by Michael Pitt, Swallers was portrayed by Kelli Garner, Dzvirko was portrayed by Daniel Franzese, and Kaufman was portrayed by Leo Fitzpatrick.

The story was covered on &quot;American Justice&quot;, &quot;Forensic Files&quot;, and &quot;Murder Among Friends&quot;. The 2001 &quot;Forensic Files&quot; episode, &quot;Payback&quot;, includes an interview with Derek Dzvirko about the murder.

<text>The American Miscellaneous Society (AMSOC – 1952 to 1964) was an informal group made up of members of the US scientific community. It was formed by Gordon Lill, of the Office of Naval Research, as an organization designed to collect various Earth science research ideas that were submitted by scientists to the U.S. Navy and did not fit into any particular category. Membership in AMSOC was open to everyone and so there was no official membership list. Prospective members could join whenever two or more members were together. The most famous project to come out of AMSOC was the Project Mohole, whose goal was to drill into the Earth&#x27;s mantle. Hollis Hedberg of Gulf Oil Corporation chaired the AMSOC Mohole subcommittee from 1962 to 1963. The society dissolved itself in 1964.

<doc id="1156468" wikidata="Q7824291" url="?curid=1156468" title="Toothpaste for Dinner">
<text>Toothpaste for Dinner is a webcomic created by Drew Fairweather. The comic was launched on January 1, 2002.

While strips were previously posted daily or several times a week, new strips are currently posted each Monday at 12:01 AM, EST. Each comic features small, simple drawings, paired with short captions or dialogue. The style of humor on &quot;Toothpaste for Dinner&quot; encompasses surrealism, irony, social commentary, cynicism, and schadenfreude, among other types of humor. Each cartoon is entirely self-contained (except in certain cases of a series, such as the horoscope series.)

==Art==
The art for &quot;Toothpaste for Dinner&quot; is drawn with ink on paper (Uni-Ball Micro pens and 300 lb. wt. Bristol board illustration paper). Although the art is primarily black and white, a color comic is occasionally posted. The art style, although minimalist, stands out due to its disjointed style. The artist often draws people with misaligned eyes, and only three, flipper-like fingers. The comic has been illustrated by contractors since 2010, so that Fairweather can focus on his other projects: &quot;The Worst Things for Sale&quot; and his rap career as Crudbump.

==Reception==
Sam Anderson of &quot;Slate&quot; described &quot;Toothpaste for Dinner&quot; as &quot;the most addictive comic on the Web.&quot; Whitney Reynolds, producer of &quot;PC Magazine&quot;, said that the webcomic showed &quot;beauty in simplicity,&quot; and supported Anderson&#x27;s claim of the &quot;Toothpaste for Dinner&quot;″s addictive nature.

<doc id="1156470" wikidata="Q6178645" url="?curid=1156470" title="Jennifer Mossop">
<text>Jennifer F. Mossop (born ) is a former politician and journalist in Ontario, Canada. She was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 2003 to 2007 who represented the Hamilton, Ontario riding of Stoney Creek.

==Background==
Prior to her election, Mossop was a well-known television news anchor and reporter in Hamilton, Ontario. She joined Hamilton television station CHCH-TV in 1981, and remained a member of the station&#x27;s reporting team for more than twenty years. She also served as a news anchor for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and wrote articles for the &quot;Hamilton Spectator&quot;. Mossop is married to Dave Betts, a musician, currently with the Canadian rock band Honeymoon Suite.

==Politics==
Mossop&#x27;s election to the Ontario legislature in the 2003 election took place under unusual circumstances. The original Liberal candidate for Stoney Creek was Tony Magnini, who was not generally regarded as a credible match for the Progressive Conservative incumbent, Brad Clark. Magnini was forced to resign after serious fraud allegations emerged in mid-campaign, however, and Mossop&#x27;s last-minute candidacy reinvigorated the Liberal Party&#x27;s organization in the riding. On election day, Mossop was able to defeat Clark by about 5,000 votes.

She was appointed parliamentary assistant to Madeleine Meilleur, the Minister of Culture, on October 23, 2003. She later served as parliamentary assistant to the new Minister of Culture Caroline Di Cocco.

In June 2007, Mossop announced she would not seek re-election in the 2007 provincial election. The Liberal Party chose another journalist, Nerene Virgin, as its candidate, but Virgin was defeated by New Democrat candidate Paul Miller in the redistributed riding of Hamilton East—Stoney Creek.

==After politics==
She now runs her own public relations and media consulting firm, Mossop Media.

<doc id="1156489" wikidata="Q2590234" url="?curid=1156489" title="Sweet Forgiveness">
<text>Sweet Forgiveness is the sixth album by Bonnie Raitt, released in 1977. The single &quot;Two Lives&quot; was written by Mark T. Jordan of the Edison Electric Band.

Raitt&#x27;s cover of the Del Shannon hit &quot;Runaway&quot; was issued as a single, reaching No. 57 on the U.S. singles chart.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that Raitt has &quot;abandoned her flowing naturalness for a plodding roughness which, unfortunately, matches producer Paul Rothchild’s singular lack of imagination.&quot;

<doc id="1156490" wikidata="Q1138716" url="?curid=1156490" title="Craig Ziadie">
<text>Craig Ziadie (born 20 September 1978) is a Jamaican-American soccer player, who last played right back for the MetroStars of Major League Soccer.

== Youth and college ==

Although he was born in Florida, Ziadie grew up in Kingston, Jamaica. He came back to America first to attend high school, and then to play college soccer at the University of Richmond. While at Richmond, Ziadie was a three-time All-Colonial Athletic Association selection, and was named the CAA Player of the Year in his 2000 senior year. He also played for the Palm Beach Pumas of the Premier Development League during his college years.

== Professional career ==

Upon graduating, Ziadie was selected 28th overall by D.C. United in the 2001 MLS SuperDraft. Ziadie surprised many by earning a starting spot in the D.C. lineup, and finished the year with three assists in 18 appearances, 13 of which were starts. Shortly into the 2002 season, however, Ziadie was traded to the MetroStars along with Mark Lisi in exchange for Petter Villegas and Orlando Perez. He quickly earned a starting position with the MetroStars, though, and finished the season with 18 starts. Ziadie has maintained his starting position at right back through most of 2003 and 2004, adding a goal and four assists over 42 games. He was taken by Chivas USA in the 2004 MLS Expansion Draft, but did not sign with the team. Ziadie had an unsuccessful trial with Scottish side Livingston in 2004.

== International career ==

Ziadie also plays for the Jamaica national team; he made his debut for the team 16 October 2002 against Japan, opting not to wait for the United States to call him in. He has since made more than 20 appearances for the team, and has been a fixture at right back during World Cup 2006 Qualifying.

== Personal ==

Ziadie&#x27;s father, Dennis Ziadie, played in the NASL with the Boston Beacons as well as for the Jamaica national team. Ziadie is a cousin of the American soccer player Mark Chung.

<doc id="1156492" wikidata="Q5104955" url="?curid=1156492" title="Chorale setting">
<text>Chorale settings refer to a wide variety of musical compositions, almost entirely of Protestant origin, which use a chorale as their basis. A chorale is a simple melody, often based on Gregorian chant, written for congregations to sing hymns. Chorale settings can be vocal, instrumental, or both.

Although the bulk of them are German in origin, and predominantly baroque in style, chorale settings span many countries and musical periods. At their simplest and most common, chorale settings are plain chordal harmonisations with little or no localised ornamentation—typically one chord for each note of the chorale, although quicker passing and neighbour notes are almost never harmonised with a separate chord.

The Protestant Reformation resulted in a significant change in musical practice in northern Europe. Plainchant, associated with the Catholic Church, was largely replaced with choral music sung in the vernacular language—usually German—and the corresponding musical forms from Catholic countries, such as the motet, were replaced with forms that used as their basis the chorales instead of the plainsong from which much of the motet repertory was derived.

Not only the musical forms, but the individual tunes of the Catholic Church were replaced by reformers, although there was often a close relation between the original and the replacement. Composers, including Martin Luther himself, both composed new tunes for the German chorale texts and adapted specific plainchant melodies. These chorales were set musically in an extraordinary number of ways, from the time of the Protestant Reformation to the present day.

Chorale settings are of the following principal types:

* Chorale cantata
* Chorale canzona (usually called a chorale ricercare)
* Chorale concerto
* Chorale fantasia
* Chorale fugue
* Chorale mass
* Chorale monody
* Chorale motet
* Chorale partita (usually interchangeable with chorale variations)
* Chorale prelude
* Chorale ricercare
* Chorale variations (usually interchangeable with chorale partita)

Boundaries between different items on this list can be vague, especially in the early Baroque. Some of these forms are exclusively instrumental (such as the chorale prelude, chorale fugue, chorale fantasia, chorale partita or variations, and chorale ricercare/canzona) while the others are a cappella vocal (some chorale motets) or for voices and instruments (chorale cantata, chorale concerto, chorale mass, chorale monody, some chorale motets). Many of the instrumental forms are almost exclusively for organ, the single most important liturgical instrument in Protestant church music from the Reformation until recent times. These organ settings can be called &#x27;organ chorales&#x27;.

Some of these forms continue to be used by composers up to the present day, particularly the chorale prelude and the chorale mass.

<doc id="1156503" wikidata="Q7514732" url="?curid=1156503" title="Silent comedy">
<text>Silent comedy is a style of film, related to but distinct from mime, developed to bring comedy into the medium of film during the silent film era (1900s–1920s), before synchronized soundtracks that could include dialogue were technologically available for the majority of films. While silent comedy is still practiced today, albeit much less frequently, it has significantly influenced modern comedic media.

Many techniques used in silent comedy were borrowed from vaudeville traditions, with many silent comedy stars, such as Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin, getting their start in vaudeville. Silent comedies often place a strong emphasis on visual and physical humor, frequently utilizing &quot;sight gags&quot; to convey stories and entertain audiences. These gags often involved exaggerated forms of violence, a style that became known as &quot;slapstick&quot;. Classic examples of slapstick comedy devices include the &quot;pratfall,&quot; slipping on a banana peel, getting soaked with water, and having a pie thrown in one&#x27;s face.

==Silent film era==

===Beginnings–1913===
The first silent comedy film is generally regarded as &quot;L&#x27;Arroseur Arrosé&quot;, directed and produced by Louis Lumière. Shown to the public on June 10, 1895, the film ran for 49 seconds and featured a gardener being sprayed in the face with a hose. Most likely based on a popular comic strip of the time, &quot;L&#x27;Arroseur Arrosé&quot; created a new genre and inspired its audiences.

As film transitioned from a novelty medium, initially focused on capturing exotic locations and everyday actions, into an established industry in the early 1900s, filmmakers began to tell fictional stories, written and shot in studios. Before 1902, these films typically ran no longer than a couple of minutes and consisted of a single shot. By 1902, filmmakers such as Georges Méliès began producing films closer to one reel in length (about 10 minutes of runtime), utilizing multiple shots. During this period, comedy emerged as a genre of its own.

The first international silent comedy star was Max Linder, a French comedian who worked for the Pathé Film Company.[4] His character, a mustachioed, top hat-wearing, high-class gentleman, excelled in taking simple scenarios and everyday tasks and turning them into chaotic events. His style of comedy was widely imitated by the silent comedians who followed in his footsteps.

Intertitles in silent films almost always served the purpose of introducing characters and setting. They also frequently conveyed dialogue. Occasionally, these intertitles included illustrations, though they were most often black with white text. Conversation could also be depicted through body language and mouthing, allowing actors to convey meaning without spoken words.

Color silent films are quite rare, as affordable color film was not invented until the late 1930s. As a result, the vast majority of silent comedies are in black and white. One notable exception is &quot;Seven Chances&quot;, which features opening scenes filmed in early Technicolor.

===1913–1927===
Hal Roach and Mack Sennett were two of the most renowned producers of silent comedies. Famous actors and comedic teams from this era have since become legendary figures: Ben Turpin, Keystone Cops, Mabel Normand, Edna Purviance, Roscoe &quot;Fatty&quot; Arbuckle, Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, Larry Semon, Harry Langdon, Charley Chase, Laurel and Hardy (who successfully transitioned into talking pictures), among many others. These actors and producers helped shape the golden age of silent comedy, leaving a lasting impact on the genre.

==Modern era==
In the early years of &quot;talkie&quot; films (beginning in 1927, with &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;), a few actors continued to perform silently for comedic effect. Most famously, Charlie Chaplin maintained his silent style in the sound era, with his last great &quot;silent&quot; comedies, &quot;City Lights&quot; (1931) and &quot;Modern Times&quot; (1936), both made after sound films had become the standard. Another notable example was Harpo Marx, who always portrayed a mute in the Marx Brothers&#x27; films. An early television series that featured exaggerated visual humor was &quot;The Ernie Kovacs Show&quot;.

An important legacy of silent film comedy can be seen in the humor of animated cartoons. While live-action comedy moved toward a focus on verbal humor, such as the witty exchanges of Abbott and Costello and Groucho Marx, animated cartoons embraced the full range of slapstick gags, frenetic chase scenes, visual puns, and exaggerated facial expressions characteristic of silent comedies. These elements were especially prominent in the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons from Warner Bros., directed by Bob Clampett, Chuck Jones and Friz Freleng, as well as in the MGM Cartoons of Tex Avery, the Tom and Jerry cartoons by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, and of Harman and Ising.

During the 1960s and 1970s, several films paid homage to or referenced the silent era of film comedy. &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; featured performers and gags from the era, while Blake Edwards&#x27; &quot;The Great Race&quot; and Mel Brooks&#x27; &quot;Silent Movie&quot; were full-length tributes. Peter Bogdanovich&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s Up, Doc?&quot; also included slapstick gags and Keystone-style chase scenes, ideas that prefigured much of the humor later seen in films like &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; and &quot;Airplane!&quot;.

An episode of &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; featured the family creating a silent comedy filled with pie-throwing antics.

Few feature films today fully exploit the genre of silent comedy. However, some comedy teams still use a silent character for comedic effect, with the most consistent—and most famous—being Teller from Penn &amp; Teller.

Rowan Atkinson achieved huge success in the 1990s with his mostly silent character Mr. Bean.

In a 1999 episode of &quot;Frasier&quot;, &quot;Three Valentines&quot;, David Hyde Pierce, who portrayed Niles Crane, performed a five-minute silent sketch at the start of the episode.

The British stop motion animated children&#x27;s series &quot;Shaun the Sheep&quot; also utilizes silent comedy.

Although fewer feature films directly employ silent comedy, its techniques continue to influence modern comedies, mainly through the development of slapstick and artistic references to the iconic gags of famous silent comedians. In 2010, India’s first silent comedy series, &quot;Gutur Gu&quot;, premiered on Sony SAB and became a hit.

<text>Henry Haywood Bell (13 April 1808 – 11 January 1868) was an American admiral in the United States Navy. In the American Civil War, he took part in the liberation of New Orleans and the lower Mississippi. Later he was sent to the Far East to command the East India Squadron. In summer 1867, he led a punitive expedition to avenge the Rover incident.

==Biography==
Bell was born in Orange County, North Carolina. Appointed a midshipman on 4 August 1823, during the next two decades he served afloat in U.S. Atlantic waters, the Mediterranean Sea and the West Indies as an officer of the frigates and ; the sloops of war , , and ; and the schooner . In March 1831, while in &quot;Vincennes&quot;, Bell was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant. He was assigned to special service on a vessel named &quot;Hunter&quot; (apparently not part of the U.S. Navy) during the mid-1840s, then was off Africa and in the Mediterranean as an officer of the frigate &quot;United States&quot; and as commanding officer of the schooner . Between early 1849 and mid-1855, Bell served ashore at the Philadelphia, Norfolk and New York Navy Yards.

Promoted to the rank of commander in August 1854, Bell went to the East Indies in 1855–1858 as commanding officer of the steamer . He spent the late 1850s and early 1860s as a member of the Board of Examiners at the U.S. Naval Academy and on ordnance duty at both Cold Spring, New York and the Washington Navy Yard.

During the Civil War he served as fleet captain of the West Gulf Blockading Squadron under Admiral David Farragut. He served in the series of campaigns that captured New Orleans and gradually opened the Mississippi River for exploitation by Federal forces. In July 1862, while so-engaged, he attained the rank of commodore. After completing his Gulf assignment in 1864, he was assigned to the New York Navy Yard as inspector of ordnance.

With the Civil War at an end, in July 1865 Commodore Bell was sent to the Far East to command the East India (later Asiatic) Squadron. He was advanced to rear admiral a year later and placed on the retired list in April 1867, but remained active as the Asiatic Squadron&#x27;s commander.

==Death==
In summer 1867, Rear Admiral Bell led the Formosan Expedition, a punitive operation in response to the &quot;Rover&quot; incident, where American sailors had been killed by Taiwanese aborigines. His squadron including screw sloops of war, (flagship), , and , with warships of other western countries, anchored in Osaka Bay to increase pressure on the Japanese government to open Hyōgo Port on 1 January 1868 as committed by various unequal treaties. On 11 January 1868, having passed Tempōzan en route upriver, his boat overturned in heavy seas; Bell and all but three of the craft&#x27;s other occupants perished in this accident.

==Namesakes==
Two ships, , have been named for him.

<doc id="1156511" wikidata="Q414162" url="?curid=1156511" title="Phthalocyanine">
<text>Phthalocyanine () is a large, aromatic, macrocyclic, organic compound with the formula and is of theoretical or specialized interest in chemical dyes and photoelectricity.

It is composed of four isoindole units linked by a ring of nitrogen atoms. = has a two-dimensional geometry and a ring system consisting of 18 π-electrons. The extensive delocalization of the π-electrons affords the molecule useful properties, lending itself to applications in dyes and pigments. Metal complexes derived from , the conjugate base of , are valuable in catalysis, organic solar cells, and photodynamic therapy.

==Properties==

Phthalocyanine and derived metal complexes (MPc) tend to aggregate and, thus, have low solubility in common solvents. Benzene at 40 °C dissolves less than a milligram of or CuPc per litre. and CuPc dissolve easily in sulfuric acid due to the protonation of the nitrogen atoms bridging the pyrrole rings. Many phthalocyanine compounds are, thermally, very stable and do not melt but can be sublimed. CuPc sublimes at above 500 °C under inert gases (nitrogen, ). Substituted phthalocyanine complexes often have much higher solubility. They are less thermally stable and often can not be sublimed. Unsubstituted phthalocyanines strongly absorb light between 600 and 700 nm, thus these materials are blue or green. Substitution can shift the absorption towards longer wavelengths, changing color from pure blue to green to colorless (when the absorption is in the near infrared).

There are many derivatives of the parent phthalocyanine, where either carbon atoms of the macrocycle are exchanged for nitrogen atoms, such as tetrapyrazinoporphyrazine, or the peripheral hydrogen atoms are substituted by functional groups like halogens, hydroxyl, amine, alkyl, aryl, thiol, alkoxy and nitrosyl groups. These modifications allow for the tuning of the electrochemical properties of the molecule such as absorption and emission wavelengths and conductance. 
==History==
In 1907, an unidentified blue compound, now known to be phthalocyanine, was reported. In 1927, Swiss researchers serendipitously discovered copper phthalocyanine, copper naphthalocyanine, and copper octamethylphthalocyanine in an attempted conversion of &quot;o&quot;-dibromobenzene into phthalonitrile. They remarked on the enormous stability of these complexes but did not further characterize them. In the same year, iron phthalocyanine was discovered at Scottish Dyes of Grangemouth, Scotland (later ICI). It was not until 1934 that Sir Patrick Linstead characterized the chemical and structural properties of iron phthalocyanine.

==Synthesis==
Phthalocyanine is formed through the cyclotetramerization of various phthalic acid derivatives including phthalonitrile, diiminoisoindole, phthalic anhydride, and phthalimides. Alternatively, heating phthalic anhydride in the presence of urea yields . Using such methods, approximately 57,000 tonnes (63,000 Imperial tons) of various phthalocyanines were produced in 1985. More often, MPc is synthesized rather than due to the greater research interest in the former. To prepare these complexes, the phthalocyanine synthesis is conducted in the presence of metal salts. Two copper phthalocyanines are shown in the figure below.

Halogenated and sulfonated derivatives of copper phthalocyanines are commercially important as dyes. Such compounds are prepared by treating CuPc with chlorine, bromine or oleum.

==Applications==
At the initial discovery of Pc, its uses were primarily limited to dyes and pigments. Modification of the substituents attached to the peripheral rings allows for the tuning of the absorption and emission properties of Pc to yield differently colored dyes and pigments. There has since been significant research on H2Pc and MPc resulting in a wide range of applications in areas including photovoltaics, photodynamic therapy, nanoparticle construction, and catalysis. The electrochemical properties of MPc make them effective electron-donors and -acceptors. As a result, MPc-based organic solar cells with power conversion efficiencies at or below 5% have been developed. Furthermore, MPcs have been used as catalysts for the oxidation of methane, phenols, alcohols, polysaccharides, and olefins; MPcs can also be used to catalyze C–C bond formation and various reduction reactions. Silicon and zinc phthalocyanines have been developed as photosensitizers for non-invasive cancer treatment. 

Various MPcs have also shown the ability to form nanostructures which have potential applications in electronics and biosensing. Phthalocyanine is also used on some recordable DVDs.

==Related compounds==

Phthalocyanines are structurally related to other tetrapyrrole macrocyles including porphyrins and porphyrazines. They feature four pyrrole-like subunits linked to form a 16 membered inner ring composed of alternating carbon and nitrogen atoms. Structurally larger analogues include naphthalocyanines. The pyrrole-like rings within are closely related to isoindole. Both porphyrins and phthalocyanines function as planar tetradentate dianionic ligands that bind metals through four inwardly projecting nitrogen centers. Such complexes are formally derivatives of , the conjugate base of .

==Soluble phthalocyanines==
Of fundamental but little practical value, soluble phthalocyanines have been prepared. Long alkyl chains can be added to improve their solubility in organic solvents. Soluble derivatives can be used for spin-coating or drop-casting. Alternatively, introducing ionic or hydrophilic groups into the structure can confer water solubility.

Solubilization can also be achieved through axial coordination. For instance, the axial ligand functionalization of silicon phthalocyanine has been extensively studied. 

==Toxicity and hazards==
No evidence has been reported for acute toxicity or carcinogenicity of phthalocyanine compounds. The (rats, oral) is 10 g/kg.

<text>Albin Julius (born Albin Julius Martinek, 16 October 1967 – 4 May 2022) was an Austrian martial music and industrial artist; his primary musical project was called Der Blutharsch. His ancestors came to Austria from Bohemia, where they came from the city of Jihlava.

Julius founded the history-themed, folk-based ensemble, The Moon Lay Hidden Beneath a Cloud. His first release as Der Blutharsch was a self-titled picture disc, limited to 250 copies.

Julius released all Der Blutharsch music on his own record label, Wir Kapitulieren Niemals (WKN, which translates: &quot;We Never Surrender&quot;). Julius founded the HauRuck! music label, which releases albums by several Neofolk and industrial groups.

<text>Ho-Pin Tung (; born December 4, 1982) is a Dutch-born racing driver who races with a Chinese license.

==Career==
Tung was born in Velp, Gelderland, Netherlands, to Chinese parents with ancestry tracing to Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province. Tung started kart racing in the Netherlands in 1997 before graduating to single-seaters. In 2001 he raced in the Dutch Formula Ford championship with Van Amersfoort Racing. After winning the 2003 Formula BMW Asia series, he was rewarded with a test drive with the Williams F1 team.

In 2004, he joined the ATS Formel 3 Cup. Although he scored race wins and podium finishes, he finished 7th in his rookie year.

Tung stayed in the ATS F3 Cup in 2005, finishing the series in third place, before taking the title in 2006, winning 9 races, 4 pole positions and 5 fastest laps.

At the 2007 Chinese Grand Prix, he was announced as a test driver for the BMW Sauber F1 Team the rest of the year.

On 4 April 2007, BCN Competición announced that it had signed Tung as its second driver alongside Japanese driver Sakon Yamamoto for the 2007 GP2 Series.

Tung drove for Trident Racing team in the 2008 GP2 Asia Series and GP2 Series, scoring his first podium finish in the latter.

In 2009, he raced in the Superleague Formula series. He raced in the first three rounds for Galatasaray S.K. and the latter three rounds for Atlético Madrid. He had his first win in the series at the Jarama round for Galatasaray.

In December 2009, Tung tested for the Renault F1 Team. In January he was announced as the team&#x27;s third driver. As part of the deal, he returned to the GP2 Series with the DAMS team for the 2010 season.

On 23 June 2010, the FIA granted Tung a four-race probationary super license, allowing him to compete in Formula One.

At the Hungaroring round of the GP2 season, Tung sustained a minor fracture of one of his lumbar vertebrae as a result of a first-lap collision with Jules Bianchi, who spun in front of him and suffered a more serious break of the same bone. Tung was replaced by Romain Grosjean while he recovered. However, Grosjean kept the seat for the remainder of the season, leaving Tung without a drive until he was called up to replace Christian Vietoris at Racing Engineering for the final round, Vietoris suffering from appendicitis.

===IndyCar===
On 22 November 2010, Tung made sporting history as he officially became the first Chinese licensed driver to take the wheel of an IndyCar by testing with the FAZZT Race Team at Sebring International Raceway.

Tung attempted to qualify for the 2011 Indianapolis 500 with Dragon Racing, but was unsuccessful due to a crash on Pole Day that resulted in a mild concussion. He made his IndyCar debut later that season in August at Infineon Raceway driving for the same team.

===Sportscars===

In 2016, Tung joined Baxi DC Racing to partner team owner David Cheng and French driver Nelson Panciatici (replaced mid-year by Paul-Loup Chatin) in the team&#x27;s Alpine A460 entry for the LMP2 class of the 2016 FIA World Endurance Championship. The team took a string of minor points placings during the year, and Tung finished the season in 13th position in the drivers&#x27; championship standings.

Tung remained with DC, now renamed Jackie Chan DC Racing, for the 2017 FIA World Endurance Championship. At the 2017 24 Hours of Le Mans, Tung became the first driver in the event&#x27;s history to lead the race in an LMP2 car, after all the top class LMP1 entries either retired or faded away in the race. Ultimately, his Oreca 07 car finished second overall, and first in the LMP2 class, after it was overtaken by the number 2 Porsche 919 Hybrid car. The Jackie Chan DC crew were also the first Chinese-entered car to win a class in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. During the remainder of the season, Tung and his co-drivers Oliver Jarvis and Thomas Laurent took further class wins at Silverstone and the Nürburgring, and two other podium finishes, and finished the season in second place in the LMP2 championship.

Tung remained with Jackie Chan DC Racing for a third season in 2018, to contest the 2018-19 FIA World Endurance Championship &#x27;superseason&#x27;.

<text>Mark Lisi (born October 11, 1977) is an American former soccer player who played midfielder for New York Red Bulls of Major League Soccer until his retirement due to debilitating injuries at the finish of the 2006 season. Lisi Court in Franklin Township, NJ is named after him.

==Career==

Lisi, who was born in Englewood, Colorado, played college soccer at Clemson University from 1997 to 2000. As a freshman, Lisi recorded three goals and six assists, despite starting only four games for the Tigers. As a sophomore, he was named second-team All-American and first-team All-ACC, after scoring 10 goals and 17 assists for the team. His junior season was not as impressive, as he finished with only 5 goals and 6 assists, but he was named first-team All-ACC nevertheless. In his senior season, he scored 14 goals and 8 assists, and was named a first-team All-American. He finished his career at Clemson with 33 goals and 37 assists.

Upon graduating, Lisi was selected third overall in the 2001 MLS SuperDraft by D.C. United. He immediately earned a starting role with a mediocre D.C. team, and finished the year with four goals and five assists in 25 games. However, shortly into the 2002 season, Lisi was traded along with Craig Ziadie to the MetroStars in exchange for Petter Villegas and Orlando Perez. Lisi played mostly as a reserve for the Metros, and finished the year with two goals and an assist in a combined 23 games played. The next year, Lisi saw an enlarged role with the Metros, starting 20 games and finished the year second in the league with 11 assists, along with one goal. However, Lisi lost his starting role in 2004, as Eddie Gaven emerged as a certain starter, and the team acquired Joselito Vaca. He only started eight games, missed a lot of time due to various injuries, yet finished the season with four assists. In 2005, Lisi played in 28 league games, and totalled five assists. In 2006, Lisi saw only nine games for the team, missing almost the entire season due to knee injury, and retired at the end of the season. At the time of his retirement, he was the team&#x27;s longest-serving player.

<text>Cornelius Kinchiloe Stribling (22 September 1796 – 17 January 1880) was a rear admiral in the United States Navy who served during the War of 1812, the Second Barbary War, the Mexican–American War, and the American Civil War.

==Biography==
Stribling was born at Pendleton, South Carolina, and left home at the age of 15. He was appointed midshipman on 18 June 1812, the day the United States declared war on Great Britain. During the War of 1812, he served in from 1 January 1813 to April 1814 and in from then until April 1815. While assigned to &quot;Mohawk&quot; on Lake Ontario, Stribling participated in the blockade of Kingston in the summer and fall of 1814.

Soon after the end of the war, he returned to &quot;Macedonian&quot; and, in 1815, participated in the capture of two Algerine ships, a frigate and a brig, by Commodore Stephen Decatur&#x27;s squadron. In October 1815, Stribling was transferred to and returned home in that frigate at the end of 1817. On 1 April 1818, he was promoted to lieutenant and served successively in , , and , and again in &quot;Constellation&quot;, during the campaigns against pirates in the West Indies. In 1823, he was given command of two barges along the coast of Cuba and with them captured buccaneer schooner &quot;Pilot&quot; after a running fight.

In 1835, he commanded the re-commissioned &quot;Peacock&quot; (1828) on her second diplomatic mission conveying diplomatist Edmund Roberts, accompanied by Lieutenant Commanding A. S. Campbell the U. S. Schooner &quot;Enterprise&quot;, both under the command of Commodore Edmund P. Kennedy, on the Commodore&#x27;s way to establish the East India Squadron.

During the Mexican War, Stribling was attached to the ship-of-the-line and took part in operations against the coastal towns of Lower California and western Mexico. From 1850 to 1853, he served as Superintendent of the United States Naval Academy. On 1 August 1853, he was promoted to the rank of captain. From 1854 to 1855, he commanded and, between 1857 and 1859, he was Commandant at the Pensacola Navy Yard.

After two years as Commander of the East India Squadron, Stribling returned home in 1861 to find the Union rent asunder by the Civil War. He supported the Union cause. Under the provisions of the Act of Congress, effective 21 December 1861, his long service required that he be placed upon the retired list. That action and a promotion to the rank of commodore took place on 2 August 1862.

The exigencies of war soon brought him back to active duty. He commanded the Philadelphia Navy Yard until 23 September 1864, when he was ordered to assume command of the East Gulf Blockading Squadron. He held this post for the duration of the war. On 6 August 1866, he was appointed to the Lighthouse Board and remained with that organization until 18 September 1871, having served as president of the board from 15 March 1869.

Rear Admiral Stribling died at Martinsburg, West Virginia, on 17 January 1880. He was buried at Oak Hill Cemetery in Washington, D.C.

==Namesakes and honors==
*Two ships have been named in his honor.

<text>Detection theory or signal detection theory is a means to measure the ability to differentiate between information-bearing patterns (called stimulus in living organisms, signal in machines) and random patterns that distract from the information (called noise, consisting of background stimuli and random activity of the detection machine and of the nervous system of the operator).

In the field of electronics, signal recovery is the separation of such patterns from a disguising background.

According to the theory, there are a number of determiners of how a detecting system will detect a signal, and where its threshold levels will be. The theory can explain how changing the threshold will affect the ability to discern, often exposing how adapted the system is to the task, purpose or goal at which it is aimed. When the detecting system is a human being, characteristics such as experience, expectations, physiological state (e.g. 
fatigue) and other factors can affect the threshold applied. For instance, a sentry in wartime might be likely to detect fainter stimuli than the same sentry in peacetime due to a lower criterion, however they might also be more likely to treat innocuous stimuli as a threat.

Much of the early work in detection theory was done by radar researchers. By 1954, the theory was fully developed on the theoretical side as described by Peterson, Birdsall and Fox and the foundation for the psychological theory was made by Wilson P. Tanner, David M. Green, and John A. Swets, also in 1954.
Detection theory was used in 1966 by John A. Swets and David M. Green for psychophysics. Green and Swets criticized the traditional methods of psychophysics for their inability to discriminate between the real sensitivity of subjects and their (potential) response biases.

Detection theory has applications in many fields such as diagnostics of any kind, quality control, telecommunications, and psychology. The concept is similar to the signal-to-noise ratio used in the sciences and confusion matrices used in artificial intelligence. It is also usable in alarm management, where it is important to separate important events from background noise.

==Psychology==
Signal detection theory (SDT) is used when psychologists want to measure the way we make decisions under conditions of uncertainty, such as how we would perceive distances in foggy conditions or during eyewitness identification. SDT assumes that the decision maker is not a passive receiver of information, but an active decision-maker who makes difficult perceptual judgments under conditions of uncertainty. In foggy circumstances, we are forced to decide how far away from us an object is, based solely upon visual stimulus which is impaired by the fog. Since the brightness of the object, such as a traffic light, is used by the brain to discriminate the distance of an object, and the fog reduces the brightness of objects, we perceive the object to be much farther away than it actually is (see also decision theory). According to SDT, during eyewitness identifications, witnesses base their decision as to whether a suspect is the culprit or not based on their perceived level of familiarity with the suspect.

To apply signal detection theory to a data set where stimuli were either present or absent, and the observer categorized each trial as having the stimulus present or absent, the trials are sorted into one of four categories:

Based on the proportions of these types of trials, numerical estimates of sensitivity can be obtained with statistics like the sensitivity index &quot;d&quot;&#x27; and A&#x27;, and response bias can be estimated with statistics like c and β. β is the measure of response bias.

Signal detection theory can also be applied to memory experiments, where items are presented on a study list for later testing. A test list is created by combining these &#x27;old&#x27; items with novel, &#x27;new&#x27; items that did not appear on the study list. On each test trial the subject will respond &#x27;yes, this was on the study list&#x27; or &#x27;no, this was not on the study list&#x27;. Items presented on the study list are called Targets, and new items are called Distractors. Saying &#x27;Yes&#x27; to a target constitutes a Hit, while saying &#x27;Yes&#x27; to a distractor constitutes a False Alarm.

== Applications ==

Signal Detection Theory has wide application, both in humans and animals. Topics include memory, stimulus characteristics of schedules of reinforcement, etc.

=== Sensitivity or discriminability ===

Conceptually, sensitivity refers to how hard or easy it is to detect that a target stimulus is present from background events. For example, in a recognition memory paradigm, having longer to study to-be-remembered words makes it easier to recognize previously seen or heard words. In contrast, having to remember 30 words rather than 5 makes the discrimination harder. One of the most commonly used statistics for computing sensitivity is the so-called sensitivity index or &quot;d&quot;&#x27;. There are also non-parametric measures, such as the area under the ROC-curve.

=== Bias ===

Bias is the extent to which one response is more probable than another, averaging across stimulus-present and stimulus-absent cases. That is, a receiver may be more likely overall to respond that a stimulus is present or more likely overall to respond that a stimulus is not present. Bias is independent of sensitivity. Bias can be desirable if false alarms and misses lead to different costs. For example, if the stimulus is a bomber, then a miss (failing to detect the bomber) may be more costly than a false alarm (reporting a bomber when there is not one), making a liberal response bias desirable. In contrast, giving false alarms too often (crying wolf) may make people less likely to respond, a problem that can be reduced by a conservative response bias.

=== Compressed sensing ===
Another field which is closely related to signal detection theory is called compressed sensing (or compressive sensing). The objective of compressed sensing is to recover high dimensional but with low complexity entities from only a few measurements. Thus, one of the most important applications of compressed sensing is in the recovery of high dimensional signals which are known to be sparse (or nearly sparse) with only a few linear measurements. The number of measurements needed in the recovery of signals is by far smaller than what Nyquist sampling theorem requires provided that the signal is sparse, meaning that it only contains a few non-zero elements. There are different methods of signal recovery in compressed sensing including basis pursuit, expander recovery algorithm, CoSaMP and also fast non-iterative algorithm. In all of the recovery methods mentioned above, choosing an appropriate measurement matrix using probabilistic constructions or deterministic constructions, is of great importance. In other words, measurement matrices must satisfy certain specific conditions such as RIP (Restricted Isometry Property) or Null-Space property in order to achieve robust sparse recovery.

==Mathematics==

=== P(H1|y) &gt; P(H2|y) / MAP testing ===
In the case of making a decision between two hypotheses, &quot;H1&quot;, absent, and &quot;H2&quot;, present, in the event of a particular observation, &quot;y&quot;, a classical approach is to choose &quot;H1&quot; when &quot;p(H1|y) &gt; p(H2|y)&quot; and &quot;H2&quot; in the reverse case. In the event that the two &quot;a posteriori&quot; probabilities are equal, one might choose to default to a single choice (either always choose &quot;H1&quot; or always choose &quot;H2&quot;), or might randomly select either &quot;H1&quot; or &quot;H2&quot;. The &quot;a priori&quot; probabilities of &quot;H1&quot; and &quot;H2&quot; can guide this choice, e.g. by always choosing the hypothesis with the higher &quot;a priori&quot; probability.

When taking this approach, usually what one knows are the conditional probabilities, &quot;p(y|H1)&quot; and &quot;p(y|H2)&quot;, and the &quot;a priori&quot; probabilities formula_1 and formula_2. In this case,

formula_3,

formula_4

where &quot;p(y)&quot; is the total probability of event &quot;y&quot;,

formula_5.

&quot;H2&quot; is chosen in case

formula_6

formula_7

and &quot;H1&quot; otherwise.

Often, the ratio formula_8 is called formula_9 and formula_10 is called formula_11, the &quot;likelihood ratio&quot;.

Using this terminology, &quot;H2&quot; is chosen in case formula_12. This is called MAP testing, where MAP stands for &quot;maximum &quot;a posteriori&quot;&quot;).

Taking this approach minimizes the expected number of errors one will make.

===Bayes criterion===

In some cases, it is far more important to respond appropriately to &quot;H1&quot; than it is to respond appropriately to &quot;H2&quot;. For example, if an alarm goes off, indicating H1 (an incoming bomber is carrying a nuclear weapon), it is much more important to shoot down the bomber if H1 = TRUE, than it is to avoid sending a fighter squadron to inspect a false alarm (i.e., H1 = FALSE, H2 = TRUE) (assuming a large supply of fighter squadrons). The Bayes criterion is an approach suitable for such cases.

Here a utility is associated with each of four situations:
* formula_13: One responds with behavior appropriate to H1 and H1 is true: fighters destroy bomber, incurring fuel, maintenance, and weapons costs, take risk of some being shot down;
* formula_14: One responds with behavior appropriate to H1 and H2 is true: fighters sent out, incurring fuel and maintenance costs, bomber location remains unknown;
* formula_15: One responds with behavior appropriate to H2 and H1 is true: city destroyed;
* formula_16: One responds with behavior appropriate to H2 and H2 is true: fighters stay home, bomber location remains unknown;

As is shown below, what is important are the differences, formula_17 and formula_18.

Similarly, there are four probabilities, formula_19, formula_20, etc., for each of the cases (which are dependent on one&#x27;s decision strategy).

The Bayes criterion approach is to maximize the expected utility:

formula_21

formula_22

formula_23

Effectively, one may maximize the sum,

formula_24,

and make the following substitutions:

formula_25

formula_26

where formula_27 and formula_28 are the &quot;a priori&quot; probabilities, formula_29 and formula_30, and formula_31 is the region of observation events, &quot;y&quot;, that are responded to as though &quot;H1&quot; is true.

formula_32

formula_33 and thus formula_34 are maximized by extending formula_31 over the region where

formula_36

This is accomplished by deciding H2 in case

formula_37

formula_38

and H1 otherwise, where &quot;L(y)&quot; is the so-defined &quot;likelihood ratio&quot;.

===Normal distribution models===

Das and Geisler extended the results of signal detection theory for normally distributed stimuli, and derived methods of computing the error rate and confusion matrix for ideal observers and non-ideal observers for detecting and categorizing univariate and multivariate normal signals from two or more categories.

He played college soccer at Cal State Fullerton- where he was coached by Al Mistri in 1994 and 1995, and was named to Soccer America&#x27;s All-Freshman team. After his sophomore year, Franchino transferred to the University of Washington, where he played in 1996 and 1997.

==Career==

===Professional===
Franchino was selected 30th overall in the 1998 MLS College Draft by the Los Angeles Galaxy. After appearing in 16 games and recording four assists as a rookie, Franchino became a consistent starter for the Galaxy in 1999. He played in 25 games in 1999, 16 of them starts, and recorded three assists. 

====New England Revolution====

In the middle of the 2000 season, however, the Galaxy were forced by the league to give Franchino to the New England Revolution, along with Clint Mathis to the MetroStars, in exchange for the marquee acquisition of Luis Hernández.

While Hernandez was a colossal failure, Franchino became an important and consistent part of the Revolution&#x27;s lineup. He was a fixture for the Revolution in the backline and midfield during his first six seasons with the club, never playing in fewer than 20 games per season. After a MLS &quot;Special Draft&quot; sent Franchino to the Revolution on May 17, 2000, he started all 22 games he appeared in for New England in 2000 and played a semi-regular starting role for the next six years, during some of which he was team captain, including the 2002 season, in which he led the Revolution to MLS Cup 2002 final. Franchino made his Revolution debut on May 20, 2000, in a 1-0 victory over Chicago Fire FC. Four days later he made his home debut, in a 2-1 win over his former club, the LA Galaxy. He scored his first Revolution goal (part of a brace) in the final match of the season, a 4-3 win over the MetroStars, on September 9, 2000. Franchino was second in matches-started for the Revolution during the 2001 New England Revolution season with 23, and recorded 23 more starts in 2002. As a result, he received the Revolution Defender of the Year Award. He was also a finalist for the 2003 MLS Goal of the Year Award. Franchino became the first player in Revolution history to ever win MLS Goal of the Week, earning the honors for his week 5 goal against the LA Galaxy on May 1.

====Return to LA====

On April 18, 2008, the Revolution traded Franchino to the Los Angeles Galaxy in exchange for a second-round pick in the 2009 MLS SuperDraft. On November 26, 2008, the Galaxy waived Franchino.

===International===
Franchino played one game with the U.S. national team, earning a cap in a friendly against Mexico on October 25, 2000.

<text>The Glow is the seventh album by the American musician Bonnie Raitt, released in 1979. It was one of the first albums to be recorded and mixed digitally.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that Asher &quot;doesn’t overproduce in the usual sense by filling tracks with unnecessary sweetening, but rather by turning out gleamingly spare, &#x27;official&#x27; Los Angeles rock that’s as spiritually hollow as it is technically immaculate.&quot; &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; noted that, &quot;as always, she could use a little shake-up in her sound and in the now typecast way she approaches each song.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; concluded that the album &quot;includes the finest vocal performances of her career.&quot;

<doc id="1156555" wikidata="Q6146207" url="?curid=1156555" title="University of Jamestown">
<text>The University of Jamestown is a private Christian university in Jamestown, North Dakota, United States. Founded in 1883 by the Presbyterian Church, it has about 1,300 students enrolled and has been co-educational from its founding. Until August 2013, the school was known as Jamestown College.

==History==
The University of Jamestown was founded as Jamestown College in 1883, but closed during the depression of 1893. The school reopened in 1909 and has remained in operation ever since.

In 1979, Jamestown College&#x27;s football team went to the NAIA National Championships.

Two graduates of the institution have become Rhodes Scholars.

In 2013, in light of a new master&#x27;s program and applied doctorate degree program, Jamestown College changed its name to the University of Jamestown.

In 2018, Dr. Robert Badal retired from his position as university president after serving in the role for nearly 16 years. He was succeeded by Dr. Polly Peterson.

==Athletics==
The Jamestown athletic teams are called the Jimmies. The university is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA). For the 2024–25 academic year, the Jimmies are primarily competing in the North Star Athletic Association (NSAA), which they were members from 2013–14 to 2017–18. The Jimmies previously competed in the Great Plains Athletic Conference (GPAC) from 2018–19 to 2023–24, and in the defunct Dakota Athletic Conference (DAC) from 2000–01 to 2011–12, as well as an NAIA Independent within the Association of Independent Institutions (AII) during the 2012–13 school year.

Jamestown competes in 24 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, ice hockey (Division 1 and Division II), soccer, track and field (indoor and outdoor), volleyball and wrestling; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, golf, ice hockey, soccer, softball, swimming &amp; diving, track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor), volleyball and wrestling; and co-ed sports include eSports and shotgun sports.

In 2023, the first sanctioned NAIA women&#x27;s wrestling championship was held at the Harold Newman Arena, on the Jamestown campus.

Jamestown began the reclassification process from the NAIA to NCAA Division II in the 2024–25 season. The Jimmies will join the Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference (NSIC) upon gaining full membership into the NCAA starting in the 2025–26 season.

<text>The Station Agent is a 2003 American comedy-drama film written and directed by Tom McCarthy in his directorial debut. It stars Peter Dinklage as a man who seeks solitude in an abandoned train station in the Newfoundland section of Jefferson Township, New Jersey. It also stars Patricia Clarkson, Michelle Williams, Bobby Cannavale and John Slattery. For his writing achievement, McCarthy won the BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay, the Independent Spirit Award for Best First Screenplay and the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award. The film itself also won the John Cassavetes Award.

==Plot==
Finbar McBride, a quiet, unmarried man with dwarfism, deeply loves railroads and leads a solitary existence. He works in a Hoboken, New Jersey, model train hobby shop owned by his elderly and similarly taciturn friend Henry. He keeps to himself and is uncomfortable when people react to his size.

When Henry dies, Fin learns that the hobby shop is to be closed and that Henry has bequeathed him a rural property with an abandoned train depot on it. He moves into the old building hoping for a life of solitude but becomes reluctantly enmeshed in the lives of his neighbors. Cuban American Joe Oramas operates his father&#x27;s roadside snack truck while the elder man recovers from an illness, and artist Olivia Harris is trying to cope with the sudden death of her young son two years earlier and its ramifications on her marriage to David, from whom she is separated. Olivia&#x27;s initial and second meetings with Fin involve her dangerously distracted driving. Cleo is a young girl who shares Fin&#x27;s interest in trains and wants him to lecture her class about them. Emily, the local librarian, is a young woman dismayed to discover she is pregnant by her ne&#x27;er-do-well boyfriend.
Joe, relentlessly upbeat and talkative, cracks Fin&#x27;s reserve. The two take daily walks along the tracks, and after Olivia gives Fin a movie camera, Joe drives alongside a passing train so that Fin can film it. Joe and Fin sleep at Olivia&#x27;s house after watching the footage and the next morning, meet a flustered, unannounced David. The trio&#x27;s tentative friendship is threatened when Olivia descends into a deep depression and disappears. Emily seeks solace in Fin, who realizes human interaction may not be wholly unpleasant. When Fin tries to protect Emily from her boyfriend at a bar he pushes Fin aside, causing Fin to lapse back into his asocial behavior. He gets frustrated with Joe and tells him he just wants to be left alone, which hurts Joe&#x27;s feelings. Emily comes to apologize for the trouble earlier, and after she and Fin share a kiss, she spends the night with Fin after asking if she can &quot;just sleep&quot; there. Cleo asks Fin if Olivia is coming back; he replies that he doesn&#x27;t know. Keeping an eye on Olivia&#x27;s house, he sees her arguing on the phone with David and goes onto her porch. Olivia angrily tells him to leave. Fin spends the night drinking and, collapsing on the track is passed over by a train, unharmed but for his pocket watch. Fin walks to Olivia&#x27;s home only to find she has attempted suicide. Olivia reveals that David is having another baby with a different woman. Fin takes care of Olivia&#x27;s home while she recuperates in the hospital. Fin finds the courage to talk to the schoolchildren about trains.

Olivia, Joe, and Fin share a meal at Olivia&#x27;s house, their conversation filled with some small talk and reconciliation. Olivia and Joe tease Fin about Emily, suggesting he seek her again.

==Production==
&quot;The Station Agent&quot; was shot on 16 mm film in 20 days with a budget of half a million dollars.

According to writer-director Tom McCarthy&#x27;s commentary on the DVD release, the film was shot on a shoestring budget in a limited amount of time. Locations used included Lake Hopatcong, Dover, Hibernia, Rockaway Township, Rockaway Borough, Hoboken, Newfoundland and Oak Ridge, New Jersey, as well as Bucks County, Pennsylvania. The Newfoundland station, originally built by the New Jersey Midland Railway in 1872, is located in Newfoundland, New Jersey, on the active New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway.

==Reception==
The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and was shown at the Toronto International Film Festival and the San Sebastián Film Festival before going into limited release in the US on October 3, 2003. Playing in three theaters, it grossed $57,785 on its opening weekend, with an average of $19,261 per theater and ranking 55th at the box office. Its widest release was in 198 theaters where it earned $5,739,376 domestically and $2,940,438 internationally, for a total of $8,679,814, well above its estimated $500,000 production budget.

The film received a very positive response from critics. It has a rating of 94% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 160 reviews with an average rating of 8.00/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states, &quot;A sweet and quirky film about a dwarf, a refreshment stand operator, and a reclusive artist connecting with one another.&quot; It also has a score of 81 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 36 reviews.

Elvis Mitchell of &quot;The New York Times&quot; observed, &quot;Tom McCarthy has such an appreciation for quiet that it occupies the same space as a character in this film, a delicate, thoughtful and often hilarious take on loneliness . . . It&#x27;s the kind of appetizing movie you want to share with others.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; said, &quot;[T]his is a comedy, but it&#x27;s also sad, and finally, it&#x27;s simply a story about trying to figure out what you love to do and then trying to figure out how to do it . . . It is a great relief . . . that &quot;The Station Agent&quot; is not one of those movies in which the problem is that the characters have not slept with each other and the solution is that they do. It&#x27;s more about the enormous unrealized fears and angers that throb beneath the surfaces of their lives.&quot;

Ruthe Stein of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; called it &quot;as touching and original a movie as you&#x27;re likely to see this year&quot; and &quot;a remarkably assured first film.&quot;

Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said, &quot;Tom McCarthy has a gift for funny and touching nuances . . . The three actors could not be better. Huge feelings are packed into this small, fragile movie. It&#x27;s something special.&quot;

James Christopher of &quot;The Times&quot; stated, &quot;The brilliance of Peter Dinklage&#x27;s performance as the ironclad loner is that he doesn’t much care. Yet there’s something deeply affecting about his stoicism and suspicion that has nothing to do with artificial sweeteners, Disney sentiment, or party political broadcasts on behalf of dwarfs. Dinklage just gets on with his performance like an actor who can&#x27;t understand why he&#x27;s got the lead role. It&#x27;s this tension between the film and the unwilling Romeo that makes &quot;The Station Agent&quot; such a hypnotic watch.&quot;

<text>Kyle Singer (born August 6, 1980, in Plymouth, Minnesota) is an American soccer player who last played goalkeeper for the New England Revolution of Major League Soccer.

Singer played college soccer at the University of Virginia from 1998 to 2001, and Boston College in 2002. After three mediocre seasons (and one redshirt) at UVA, Singer transferred to BC for his senior season. Unable to earn a starting position at UVA, Singer quickly established himself; he set a school record by recording 12 shutouts, and was named first team All-New England and the Big East Goalkeeper of the Year.

Upon graduating, Singer was selected 29th overall in the 2003 MLS SuperDraft by the local New England Revolution. Singer only played 9 minutes as a rookie, and only spent one minute in goal, playing the other 8 as a field player. However, he spent eight games with the New Hampshire Phantoms of the PSL, with whom he posted 7 wins and 4 shutouts. Singer did not see any playing time in 2004, as Adin Brown and Matt Reis were too formidable a player to break through, but again saw significant time with the Phantoms. Playing in 10 games, Singer posted a record of 7 wins, 2 losses, and 1 tie, while allowing only 1.23 goals per game. Without Singer in goal, the Phantoms posted a record of 3 wins and 7 losses.

<doc id="1156569" wikidata="Q2379963" url="?curid=1156569" title="Kevin Volans">
<text>Kevin Volans (born 26 July 1949) is a South African-born Irish composer and pianist. He studied with Karlheinz Stockhausen and Mauricio Kagel in Cologne in the 1970s and later became associated with the &quot;Neue Einfachheit&quot; (New Simplicity) movement in the city. In the late 1970s he became interested in the indigenous music of his homeland and began a series of pieces which attempted to combine aspects of African and contemporary European music. Although Volans later moved away from any direct engagement with African music, certain residual elements such as interlocking rhythms, repetition and open forms are still detectable in his music since the early 1990s which have taken a new direction more redolent of certain schools of abstract art. He settled in Ireland permanently in 1986 and was granted Irish citizenship in 1994.

== Biography ==
Volans was born in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa, on 26 July 1949. During his teenage years, he developed an interest in the music of the post-war avant-garde as well as abstract painting. He pursued a Bachelor of Music degree at the University of the Witwatersrand graduating in 1972. After postgraduate study at the University of Aberdeen he moved in 1973 to Cologne, where he became one of only five students admitted to Stockhausen&#x27;s composition class at the Musikhochschule. He became intimately acquainted with Stockhausen&#x27;s extensions of serial technique and eventually became his teaching assistant in 1975–76, replacing Richard Toop. He also took lessons in music theatre from Mauricio Kagel as well as taking piano lessons from Aloys Kontarsky and studying electronic music with Hans-Ulrich Humpert.

While in Cologne Volans became increasingly dissatisfied with the new-music movement in the city, which he perceived to be dogmatic and creatively restricting. Alongside other composers such as Walter Zimmermann, Gerald Barry, and Michael von Biel, Volans began to question the hegemony of the prevailing new-music style that was based on an extension of the serial techniques of the previous generation. This group of composers, loosely referred to as the Cologne School, marked the start of the &quot;Neue Einfachheit&quot; (New Simplicity) movement which began with a concert series organised by Zimmermann in January 1977. Composers linked with the New Simplicity generally sought a more transparent and direct style, an openness to aspects of tonality and freedom to use pre-existing material quite in contrast to the intense abstraction of the post-war avant-garde.

== Africa series ==
Despite having grown up in South Africa, Volans had little contact with the indigenous music of his homeland due to apartheid strictures which largely prohibited the intermingling of black and white cultures. It wasn&#x27;t until he was commissioned by Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR) to undertake a number of field trips between 1976 and 1979 to South Africa to record various kinds of indigenous African music that he began to actively take an interest in this music. These field trips alerted him to aspects of indigenous African culture, both musical and visual, which he had previously overlooked. He thus set about planning a series of works in which he attempted to reconcile African and European aesthetics. At the start of the series Volans envisaged that the African source material would be quite recognizable but as the series progressed he would gradually exercise more and more intervention into it so that by the end of the series the African material would be fully assimilated into his own style:

As a political statement, Volans, as a white South African, felt that the series might lend some sort of contribution to the struggle against apartheid and some performances were met with protests from the musical establishment in South Africa. The most well-known piece from the series is &quot;White Man Sleeps&quot; (1982) for two harpsichords, viola da gamba and percussion. In this piece Volans attempted to &quot;Africanize&quot; Western European art music by transferring paraphrases and transcriptions of Venda, San, Nyungwe and Lesotho music, as well as his own material, onto re-tuned period instruments. The subsequent reworking of the piece for a recording by the Kronos Quartet became one of the biggest-selling string-quartet releases of all time. The works immediately following &quot;White Man Sleeps&quot;, such as the second and third quartets, continue to use some African references, but display an increasing preoccupation with non-directional narratives influenced by the uneven and often random patterns present in African textiles, as well as the open approach to time present in the late works of Morton Feldman.

== Towards abstraction ==
Despite the success of the African series, Volans began to find himself increasingly categorized as an &quot;African&quot; composer—a label which he found creatively restricting. In the late 1980s he began to pursue a new direction, developing a style characterized by an overall tendency towards increasing abstraction occasionally punctuated by works where literal African elements once again re-emerge. This is clearly seen in works such as &quot;Chevron&quot; (1990) and &quot;One Hundred Frames&quot; (1991), as well as his opera &quot;The Man with Footsoles of Wind&quot; (1993) based on the last year of the life of the 19th-century poet Arthur Rimbaud. A parallel development to this was his increasing interest in writing for dance, an art form particularly suited to Volans&#x27;s open conception of formal structure and he has collaborated with the choreographers Jonathan Burrows, Siobhan Davies and Shobana Jeyasingh.

The key work which confirmed this new direction is &quot;Cicada&quot; (1994) for two pianos, which was inspired by his experience inside one of James Turrell&#x27;s Skyspaces. The piece involves very gradual adjustments of tone, harmonic colour and tempo being applied to a repeated sonority based on a B-flat major and A major triads. Described by the composer as his first minimalist piece, &quot;Cicada&quot;&#x27;s reduction in content and largely flat surface is a departure from the generally high degree of activity which marked many of his earlier works. Although there is no recognizably African material present in the piece, the existence of interlocking patterns, inherent rhythms and open non-developmental forms demonstrate how African elements continue to inform his work in a background capacity.

In a number of works since &quot;Cicada&quot;, Volans limited the content and pursued a similar policy of incremental changes at the margins of the material. The reduction of material in these pieces is even more extreme than in &quot;Cicada&quot; and exemplifies a tendency which Volans has described as follows:

Two works in particular demonstrate this tendency – String Quartet No. 6 and the Concerto for Double Orchestra. String Quartet No. 6 is not in fact a string quartet at all but a piece for two spatially separated string quartets which can be performed live with both quartets or with one live and the other pre-recorded. The vast majority of the piece consists of just two chords which overlap between both quartets creating a blurring of the harmonies not unlike the blurring of colour fields in the paintings of Mark Rothko, which served as the piece&#x27;s inspiration. In the Concerto for Double Orchestra (2001) static harmonies are spatially distributed back and forth between a split orchestra with a focus on the &quot;edges&quot; of the chords through accented pizzicatos and dynamics rather than &quot;bleeding&quot; them together. Both of these works demonstrate Volans&#x27;s concerns with moving the site of musical discourse to the margins of the material, a strategy inspired by his lifelong interest in visual art. The music tends to focus on the interplay between dynamics, voicings, register, timbre and types of attack; parameters which are usually considered secondary to larger-scale transformations in the domain of pitch and rhythm. The reduced approach to content directs attention towards changes in the slightest details and encourages a form of engagement perhaps more prevalent in the world of visual art.
This tendency towards reduction is not universal, however. Perhaps due to the inherent nature of the medium, Volans&#x27;s concertante works such as the Trio Concerto (2005) and the Piano Concerto No. 2 (2006) are notable for their virtuosic writing and dynamism. Volans&#x27;s most recent work constitutes yet another phase of development. Beginning with &quot;The Partenheimer Project&quot; (2007), much of the new work explores the interaction between individual parts playing independently of each other to some degree. The &quot;Partenheimer Project&quot; is spatially separated into three ensembles while both &quot;Violin: Piano&quot; (2008) and &quot;Cello: Piano&quot; (2008) contain instruments playing at different tempi propelled for the most part by irregular repetition. The transparent scoring and negation of any sense of goal-orientated progression lends the music a static floating quality.

While Volans&#x27;s music has often been viewed as a reaction to the perceived excesses of serialism, it is nevertheless significant that his approach to dynamics and articulation is always structurally rather than expressively directed. In this way, Volans identifies with the tradition of modernism and his music studiously avoids any lapses into postmodern nostalgia. He has been described by the music critic Kyle Gann as:

In 1997 the &quot;BBC Music Magazine&quot; listed Volans as one of the 50 most important living composers. In 1999 the Southbank Centre in London hosted a 50th birthday celebration of his work, for his 60th the Wigmore Hall in London organised a &quot;Kevin Volans Day&quot; of concerts, and in 2019 the Wigmore Hall again had a concert celebrating his 70th birthday.

==Students==

Volans taught composition at the University of Natal, where he received a DMus in 1986. He was also composer in residence at Queen&#x27;s University Belfast (1986–89) and at Princeton University (1992). Since moving to Ireland in 1985 he has exerted a considerable influence on the direction of music in the country through his teaching. His notable students include Jennifer Walshe.

<doc id="1156581" wikidata="Q862091" url="?curid=1156581" title="Jewish name">
<text>Jewish names, specifically one&#x27;s given name, have varied over time and by location and ethnic group. Other types of names used by Jewish people include the surname and the religious name known as the Hebrew name. 

== Given names ==
Given names, also known as &quot;first names,&quot; have a range of customs within different Jewish ethnic groups. Common given names, however, remain similar in many parts of the Jewish community, with many of them based on figures in the Hebrew Bible or honoring relatives. These are distinguished from the Hebrew name, which retained the original formulation of Jewish names.

=== Sephardi customs ===
Sephardim have often named newborn children in honor of their living grandparents. This practice typically uses these names in a specific order: the father&#x27;s father, the father&#x27;s mother, the mother&#x27;s father, the mother&#x27;s mother.

=== Ashkenazi customs ===
In stark contrast to Sephardi customs, Ashkenazim have a longstanding superstition about naming a child after a living person. Instead, only a deceased relative&#x27;s name may be used. According to this superstition, naming a child after a living person could appear as though you are waiting for that person to die. This practice is rooted in Jewish custom and has no standing in Jewish law. While not many Jewish people necessarily believe in the superstition per se, the lack of precedence makes practices such as a (living) father naming his son after himself an unusual occurrence for Ashkenazim.

A peculiarity of Yiddish names for Ashkenazi Jews was recording legal names in diminutive form. These dimunitive forms could be either hypocoristics (pet names) or deprecative. This tradition was more widespread for female names rather than for male names. There was a wide variety of suffixes added to a normative form of the name. Depending on the country of residence, the suffixes were borrowed into Yiddish, e.g., from German, Russian, Polish, Belarusian, etc. languages. In many cases these suffixed were used to create nicknames from regular words.
Some examples: Leiba, Leibuța (Romanian-language) from Leib, Berele or Bereleyn from Berl/Berel, Khaytsi, Chayka from Chaya, Rivka from Riva which itself was from Rebecca, Motke, Mordkhe, or Mordka from Mordechai, Feygele, Faygele from Feigl/Foigl (&quot;bird&quot;, which could also be used as a female name), etc.

== Surnames ==
While many surnames are associated with Jewish people in the United States, there are only three surnames rooted in ancient Jewish culture: Kohen (or Cohen), Levy, and Israel. These names originate with the Israelite tribes which bear the same name. Variations on these names are common and most often reflect different ways of transliterating the Hebrew version.

Apart from these original surnames, the surnames of Jewish people of the present have typically reflected family history and their ethnic group within the Jewish people. Sephardic communities began to take on surnames in the Middle Ages (specifically c.10th and 11th centuries), and these surnames reflect the languages spoken by the Sephardic subset of the Jewish diaspora, including Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian. Ashkenazi communities of Northern and Eastern Europe, however, did not take on surnames until later (c.14th and 15th centuries). As with many other European communities, it was not unusual for a surname of this time period to reflect patrilineal relationships (e.g. Abraham&#x27;s son --&gt; Abramson, Abramsohn, etc.).

== Hebrew name ==
The Hebrew name is a Jewish practice rooted in the practices of early Jewish communities and Judaism. This Hebrew name is used for religious purposes, such as when the child is called to read the Torah at their b&#x27;nei mitzvah. 

The baby&#x27;s name is traditionally announced during the &quot;brit milah&quot; (circumcision ceremony) for male babies, typically on the eighth day after his birth. Female babies may also have a naming ceremony, known by several different names, including &quot;zeved habat, b&#x27;rit bat&quot;, and &quot;b&#x27;rit chayim&quot;. This may be held between 7 and 30 days after her birth.

The Hebrew name follows a particular format that reflects gender:

* Male: [Hebrew given name] &quot;ben&quot; [parents&#x27; Hebrew given names]
** Example: Abraham &quot;ben&quot; David &quot;v&quot;Sarah
* Female: [Hebrew given name] &quot;bat&quot; [parents&#x27; Hebrew given names]
** Example: Leah &quot;bat&quot; David &quot;v&quot;Sarah
* Neutral: [Hebrew given name] &quot;mibeit&quot; or &quot;mimishpachat&quot; [parents&#x27; Hebrew given names]
** Example: Lior &quot;mibeit&quot; David &quot;v&quot;Sarah OR Lior &quot;mimishpachat&quot; David &quot;v&quot;Sarah

The chosen Hebrew name can be related to the child&#x27;s secular given name, but it does not have to be. The name is typically Biblical or based in Modern Hebrew.

For those who convert to Judaism and thus lack parents with Hebrew names, their parents are given as Abraham and Sarah, the first Jewish people of the Hebrew Bible. Those adopted by Jewish parents use the names of their adoptive parents.

<doc id="1156587" wikidata="Q3068565" url="?curid=1156587" title="Green Light (Bonnie Raitt album)">
<text>Green Light is the eighth album by Bonnie Raitt, released in 1982.

&quot;What I wanted this time out was a combination of the music I&#x27;ve been listening to recently,&quot; Raitt said in 1982, &quot;Billy Burnette, the Blasters, Rockpile, and the rock-a-billy New Wave scene. I knew I had to get away from the slick sound I had with the Peter Asher record...I was a little stung by the lack of response to &quot;The Glow&quot;. And I was disappointed by not being able to make a record that sounded the way I wanted it to sound. Moving to Shangri-la, I wanted to get back to the roots and to the funkiness I had on earlier records, even though I&#x27;m not crazy about how they sound. They sound like I was having a lot more fun than I really was. &quot;Green Light&quot; is the first album I actually had fun doing.&quot;

&quot;Green Light&quot; earned Raitt her strongest reviews in years, with critic Robert Christgau writing that &quot;on &quot;The Glow&quot; the present-day female interpreter refused to die, and now she does even better by the suspect notion of good ol&#x27; you-know-what. The strength of [&quot;Green Light&quot;] runs too deep to rise up and grab you all at once, so you might begin with &quot;Me and the Boys&quot;, arch as usual from NRBQ but formally advanced pull-out-the-stops (with all postfeminist peculiarities accounted for) when Bonnie and the boys get down on it.&quot;

According to Raitt, the album&#x27;s hard-rock approach came as a surprise to some of her peers. &quot;Well, a lot of my friends thought I had moved to the beach and turned into Gidget. But it&#x27;s not like I suddenly became an airhead. I needed to lighten up a bit, that&#x27;s all. I was laughing all the time, having a lot of fun, hanging out at this funky old studio that had hippie blankets hanging from the ceiling. Now I&#x27;m getting some feedback from people who feel the same way that I do about rock and roll. Then there are other, more conservative friends whom I&#x27;ve known for years who still wish I was sitting in a chair playing acoustic guitar.&quot;

<text>Biofiltration is a pollution control technique using a bioreactor containing living material to capture and biologically degrade pollutants. Common uses include processing waste water, capturing harmful chemicals or silt from surface runoff, and microbiotic oxidation of contaminants in air. Industrial biofiltration can be classified as the process of utilizing biological oxidation to remove volatile organic compounds, odors, and hydrocarbons. 

==Examples of biofiltration==
Examples of biofiltration include:
* Bioswales, biostrips, biobags, bioscrubbers, Vermifilters and trickling filters
* Constructed wetlands and natural wetlands
* Slow sand filters
* Treatment ponds
* Green belts
* Green walls
* Riparian zones, riparian forests, bosques
* Bivalve bioaccumulation

==Control of air pollution==
When applied to air filtration and purification, biofilters use microorganisms to remove air pollution. 
The air flows through a packed bed and the pollutant transfers into a thin biofilm on the surface of the packing material. Microorganisms, including bacteria and fungi are immobilized in the biofilm and degrade the pollutant. Trickling filters and bioscrubbers rely on a biofilm and the bacterial action in their recirculating waters.

The technology finds the greatest application in treating malodorous compounds and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Industries employing the technology include food and animal products, off-gas from wastewater treatment facilities, pharmaceuticals, wood products manufacturing, paint and coatings application and manufacturing and resin manufacturing and application, etc. Compounds treated are typically mixed VOCs and various sulfur compounds, including hydrogen sulfide. Very large airflows may be treated and although a large area (footprint) has typically been required—a large biofilter (&gt;200,000 acfm) may occupy as much or more land than a football field—this has been one of the principal drawbacks of the technology. Since the early 1990s, engineered biofilters have provided significant footprint reductions over the conventional flat-bed, organic media type.

One of the main challenges to optimum biofilter operation is maintaining proper moisture throughout the system. The air is normally humidified before it enters the bed with a watering (spray) system, humidification chamber, bio scrubber, or bio trickling filter. Properly maintained, a natural, organic packing media like peat, vegetable mulch, bark or wood chips may last for several years but engineered, combined natural organic, and synthetic component packing materials will generally last much longer, up to 10 years. Several companies offer these types of proprietary packing materials and multi-year guarantees, not usually provided with a conventional compost or wood chip bed biofilter.

Although widely employed, the scientific community is still unsure of the physical phenomena underpinning biofilter operation, and information about the microorganisms involved continues to be developed. A biofilter/bio-oxidation system is a fairly simple device to construct and operate and offers a cost-effective solution provided the pollutant is biodegradable within a moderate time frame (increasing residence time = increased size and capital costs), at reasonable concentrations (and lb/hr loading rates) and that the airstream is at an organism-viable temperature. For large volumes of air, a biofilter may be the only cost-effective solution. There is no secondary pollution (unlike the case of incineration where additional CO2 and NOx are produced from burning fuels) and degradation products form additional biomass, carbon dioxide and water. Media irrigation water, although many systems recycle part of it to reduce operating costs, has a moderately high biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and may require treatment before disposal. However, this &quot;blowdown water&quot;, necessary for proper maintenance of any bio-oxidation system, is generally accepted by municipal publicly owned treatment works without any pretreatment.

Biofilters are being utilized in Columbia Falls, Montana at Plum Creek Timber Company&#x27;s fiberboard plant. The biofilters decrease the pollution emitted by the manufacturing process and the exhaust emitted is 98% clean. The newest, and largest, biofilter addition to Plum Creek cost $9.5 million, yet even though this new technology is expensive, in the long run it will cost less overtime than the alternative exhaust-cleaning incinerators fueled by natural gas (which are not as environmentally friendly).

==Water treatment==

Biofiltration was first introduced in England in 1893 as a trickling filter for wastewater treatment and has since been successfully used for the treatment of different types of water. Biological treatment has been used in Europe to filter surface water for drinking purposes since the early 1900s and is now receiving more interest worldwide. Biofiltration is also common in wastewater treatment, aquaculture and greywater recycling, as a way to minimize water replacement while increasing water quality.

===Biofiltration process===

A biofilter is a bed of media on which microorganisms attach and grow to form a biological layer called biofilm. Biofiltration is thus usually referred to as a fixed–film process. Generally, the biofilm is formed by a community of different microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, yeast, etc.), macro-organisms (protozoa, worms, insect&#x27;s larvae, etc.) and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) (Flemming and Wingender, 2010). Air or water flows through a media bed and any suspended compounds are transferred into a surface biofilm where microorganisms are held to degrade pollutants. The aspect of the biofilm is usually slimy and muddy.

Water to be treated can be applied intermittently or continuously over the media, via upflow or downflow. Typically, a biofilter has two or three phases, depending on the feeding strategy (percolating or submerged biofilter):

* a solid phase (media)

* a liquid phase (water);
* a gaseous phase (air).

Organic matter and other water components diffuse into the biofilm where the treatment occurs, mostly by biodegradation. Biofiltration processes are usually aerobic, which means that microorganisms require oxygen for their metabolism. Oxygen can be supplied to the biofilm, either concurrently or countercurrently with water flow. Aeration occurs passively by the natural flow of air through the process (three phase biofilter) or by forced air supplied by blowers.

Microorganisms&#x27; activity is a key-factor of the process performance. The main influencing factors are the water composition, the biofilter hydraulic loading, the type of media, the feeding strategy (percolation or submerged media), the age of the biofilm, temperature, aeration, etc.

The mechanisms by which certain microorganisms can attach and colonize on the surface of filter media of a biofilter can be via transportation, initial adhesion, firm attachment, and colonization [Van Loosdrecht et al., 1990]. The transportation of microorganisms to the surface of the filter media is further controlled by four main processes of diffusion (Brownian motion), convection, sedimentation, and active mobility of the microorganisms. The overall filtration process consists of microorganism attachment, substrate utilization which causes biomass growth, to biomass detachment.

===Types of filtering media===

Most biofilters use media such as sand, crushed rock, river gravel, or some form of plastic or ceramic material shaped as small beads and rings.

===Advantages===

Although biological filters have simple superficial structures, their internal hydrodynamics and the microorganisms&#x27; biology and ecology are complex and variable. These characteristics confer robustness to the process. In other words, the process has the capacity to maintain its performance or rapidly return to initial levels following a period of no flow, of intense use, toxic shocks, media backwash (high rate biofiltration processes), etc.

The structure of the biofilm protects microorganisms from difficult environmental conditions and retains the biomass inside the process, even when conditions are not optimal for its growth. Biofiltration processes offer the following advantages: (Rittmann et al., 1988):

* Since microorganisms are retained within the biofilm, biofiltration allows the development of microorganisms with relatively low specific growth rates;
* Biofilters are less subject to variable or intermittent loading and to hydraulic shock;
* Operational costs are usually lower than for activated sludge; 
* The final treatment result is less influenced by biomass separation since the biomass concentration at the effluent is much lower than for suspended biomass processes;
* The attached biomass becomes more specialized (higher concentration of relevant organisms) at a given point in the process train because there is no biomass return.

===Drawbacks===

Because filtration and growth of biomass leads to an accumulation of matter in the filtering media, this type of fixed-film process is subject to bioclogging and flow channeling. Depending on the type of application and on the media used for microbial growth, bioclogging can be controlled using physical and/or chemical methods. Backwash steps can be implemented using air and/or water to disrupt the biomat and recover flow whenever possible. Chemicals such as oxidizing (peroxide, ozone) or biocide agents can also be used.

Biofiltration can require a large area for some treatment techniques (suspended growth and attached growth processes) as well as long hydraulic retention times (anaerobic lagoon and anaerobic baffled reactor).

==Drinking water==
For drinking water, biological water treatment involves the use of naturally occurring microorganisms in the surface water to improve water quality. Under optimum conditions, including relatively low turbidity and high oxygen content, the organisms break down material in the water and thus improve water quality. Slow sand filters or carbon filters are used to provide a support on which these microorganisms grow. These biological treatment systems effectively reduce water-borne diseases, dissolved organic carbon, turbidity and color in surface water, thus improving overall water quality.

Typically in drinking water treatment; granular activated carbon or sand filters are used to prevent re-growth of microorganisms in water distribution pipes by reducing levels of iron and nitrate that act as a microbial nutrient. GAC also reduces chlorine demand and other disinfection by-product accumulation by acting as a first line of disinfection. Bacteria attached to filter media as a biofilm oxidize organic material as both an energy and carbon source, this prevents undesired bacteria from using these sources which can reduce water odors and tastes [Bouwer, 1998]. These biological treatment systems effectively reduce water-borne diseases, dissolved organic carbon, turbidity and color in surface water, thus improving overall water quality.

Biotechnological techniques can be used to improve the biofiltration of drinking water by studying the  microbial communities in the water. Such techniques include qPCR (quantitative polymerase chain reaction), ATP assay, metagenomics, and flow cytometry.

==Wastewater==
Biofiltration is used to treat wastewater from a wide range of sources, with varying organic compositions and concentrations. Many examples of biofiltration applications are described in the literature. Bespoke biofilters have been developed and commercialized for the treatment of animal wastes, landfill leachates, dairy wastewater, domestic wastewater.

This process is versatile as it can be adapted to small flows (&lt; 1 m3/d), such as onsite sewage as well as to flows generated by a municipality (&gt; 240 000 m3/d). For decentralized domestic wastewater production, such as for isolated dwellings, it has been demonstrated that there are important daily, weekly and yearly fluctuations of hydraulic and organic production rates related to modern families&#x27; lifestyle. In this context, a biofilter located after a septic tank constitutes a robust process able to sustain the variability observed without compromising the treatment performance.

In anaerobic wastewater treatment facilities, biogas is fed through a bio-scrubber and “scrubbed” with activated sludge liquid from an aeration tank. Most commonly found in wastewater treatment is the trickling filter process (TFs) [Chaudhary, 2003]. Trickling filters are an aerobic treatment that uses microorganisms on attached medium to remove organic matter from wastewater.

In primary wastewater treatment, biofiltration is used to control levels of biochemical oxygen, demand, chemical oxygen demand, and suspended solids. In tertiary treatment processes, biofiltration is used to control levels of organic carbon [ Carlson, 1998].

==Use in aquaculture==
The use of biofilters is common in closed aquaculture systems, such as recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS). The biofiltration techniques used in aquaculture can be separated into three categories: biological, physical, and chemical. The primary biological method is nitrification; physical methods include mechanical techniques and sedimentation, and chemical methods are usually used in tandem with one of the other methods. Some farms use seaweed, such as those from the genera Ulva, to take excess nutrients out of the water and release oxygen into the ecosystem in a “recirculation system” while also serving as a source of income when they sell the seaweed for safe human consumption.

Many designs are used, with different benefits and drawbacks, however the function is the same: reducing water exchanges by converting ammonia to nitrate. Ammonia (NH4+ and NH3) originates from the brachial excretion from the gills of aquatic animals and from the decomposition of organic matter. As ammonia-N is highly toxic, this is converted to a less toxic form of nitrite (by &quot;Nitrosomonas&quot; sp.) and then to an even less toxic form of nitrate (by &quot;Nitrobacter&quot; sp.). This &quot;nitrification&quot; process requires oxygen (aerobic conditions), without which the biofilter can crash. Furthermore, as this nitrification cycle produces H+, the pH can decrease, which necessitates the use of buffers such as lime.

<doc id="1156605" wikidata="Q5014323" url="?curid=1156605" title="CSS North Carolina">
<text>CSS &quot;North Carolina&quot; was a casemate ironclad built for the Confederate Navy in 1863 during the American Civil War by Berry &amp; Brothers at Wilmington, North Carolina at a cost of $76,000. She was placed in commission during the latter part of the year with Commander W. T. Muse, CSN, in command.

The ironclad&#x27;s bulkheads above the waterline were sloped inward at a 30-degree angle and were armored with four inches of railroad iron, similar to the armor used on . There were two shuttered gun ports on each of her four casemate sides, and she carried six 8-inch cannons that could be rolled on their carriages from one port to another; she mounted one heavy pivot-rifle in the bow cannon position.

&quot;North Carolina&quot; was discovered to be structurally unsound and unsuitable for use on the open ocean; her hull had become riddled with shipworm as a result of the green hull timber used for her construction. She remained in the Cape Fear River, where she had developed bad leaks, until she finally foundered on 27 September 1864, just off Smithville (modern Southport); she was serving there as a guard ship.

Her sister ship was also a hard-luck ironclad. After serving in the Confederate Navy for just one week, &quot;Raleigh&quot; ran heavily aground on a sandbar called &quot;the Rip.&quot; Her tonnage bore down heavily on the ship&#x27;s unsupported aft keel, the pressure finally &quot;breaking her back,&quot; as the tide receded; the ironclad was declared a total loss and her cannon, iron armor, and steam power plant were salvaged.

<text>The Yamaha KT100 is a 100 cc two-stroke cycle kart engine made by Yamaha that has also been adapted for ultralight aircraft use.

==Design and development==
The KT100 is a simple and rugged air-cooled engine that uses piston-ported intake induction with a Walbro WB-3A carburetor. The KT100 is a popular high-performance two-stroke kart racing engine. It comes in various forms used in many countries. The KT100J is slightly smaller with fewer options in comparison to its bigger brother, the KT100SE.

The KT100 is a very versatile engine using different exhaust systems and carburetors through a large range of classes. The KT100 can be tuned for most series and organizations with maximum and minimum rules.

==Aircraft use==
In the late 1970s and early 1980s the engine was adapted for use on ultralight aircraft. The ultralights of that era were lighter and had much lower wing loadings than today, making flight practical on the KT100&#x27;s developed at 10,000 rpm. In aircraft use it was usually equipped with a recoil starter and a belt reduction drive.

==Applications==
*Skyhigh Skybaby
*Striplin Lone Ranger
*Swallow Aeroplane Company Swallow A
*Ultralite Soaring Wizard
*Volmer VJ-24W SunFun

<text>Douglas Howard Sills (born July 5, 1960) is an American actor and singer.

He made his professional stage acting debut with principal roles in the national tours of &quot;Into the Woods&quot; and &quot;The Secret Garden&quot;. He is most well-known for his leading roles in the Broadway production and national tour of &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot;, the Broadway production of &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot;, and the national tour of &quot;The Addams Family&quot;.

==Early life==
Sills was born in Detroit, Michigan, the son of Rhoda (Nemeth) and Archie Sills, and grew up in the suburb of Franklin, in a Jewish household. He was friends (and did amateur theatrics and films) with both Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell. Sills attended Cranbrook School, from which he graduated in 1978, and the University of Michigan where he majored in music. He then continued his education at the American Conservatory Theater in California.

==Career==
During the 1990s, Sills built a reputation as a stage character actor, especially in the professional theaters of southern California. He also performed in several national tours, including &quot;Into the Woods&quot; and &quot;The Secret Garden&quot;, which would also feature future Broadway stars as James Stacy Barbour and Audra McDonald. He met his partner, Todd, in 1994 while touring with &quot;The Secret Garden&quot;. His first Broadway role, however, came when composer Frank Wildhorn and lyricist Nan Knighton approached him in hopes of finding a male lead for their new musical, &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot;. Before this audition, Sills told his agent not to send him to any more auditions because he planned to attend law school. With a score in the 99th percentile on the Law School Admission Test (LSAT), Sills hoped to attend Stanford Law School. However, being a fan of the movie as a child, Sills decided to give acting one more chance and was offered the lead as Sir Percy Blakeney.

Douglas Sills opened in his first Broadway show on November 9, 1997. Continuing the role in three other versions of the show, Sills received a Tony Award nomination. He portrayed the foppish hero in SP 1.0 (The Original Broadway Production, starring Terrence Mann, Christine Andreas and Gilles Chiason), SP 2.0 (the revised Broadway production, starring Rachel York and Rex Smith), and for several months in the national tour. Although rumored as playing the title role in Wildhorn&#x27;s &quot;Dracula, the Musical&quot;, Sills opted out (despite doing a recording demo), and Tom Hewitt portrayed the gothic character at the premiere at the La Jolla Playhouse in 2001. He played Orin Scrivello and several other roles in the 2003 Broadway revival cast of &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot;.

In 2004, Sills joined the Broadway-bound Chicago production of Monty Python&#x27;s &quot;Spamalot&quot;. However, before the production began, Sills left due to reported &quot;major script changes.&quot; In early 2005, production plans were announced for Wildhorn&#x27;s new musical &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot;, from the same team that helped launch his career with &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot;. The title role was written specifically for Sills, however, producers dropped plans for the show in spring 2006 without explanation. A studio-concept recording was planned, starring Sills, Linda Eder and Rob Evan, but plans for it also quickly fell through.

In 2009, Sills starred opposite Kristin Chenoweth at the Encores! New York City Center production of &quot;Music in the Air&quot;, a long-forgotten Kern-Hamerstein musical from the 1930s. The concert-style version ran February 5 through February 8. Sills assumed the role of Gomez Addams in the national tour of &quot;The Addams Family&quot; in September 2011 until the company&#x27;s closing on December 30, 2012.

From March 27 to April 12, 2013, Sills took on the role of Jack in Long Wharf Theatre&#x27;s production of William Mastrosimone&#x27;s &quot;Ride the Tiger&quot;.

Sills played Walter Burns in La Jolla Playhouse&#x27;s production of &quot;His Girl Friday&quot; from May 28 to June 30, 2013.

Sills appeared on Broadway beginning in April 2015, playing an aging orchestra conductor in the comedy &quot;Living on Love&quot;, written by Joe DiPietro, starring Renee Fleming, Jerry O&#x27;Connell and Anna Chlumsky.

He appeared in the new musical &quot;Dave&quot; at the Arena Stage in Washington, D.C., in 2018, in the role of Chief of Staff Bob Alexander. The musical has music by Tom Kitt, lyrics by Nell Benjamin, and the book by Benjamin and Thomas Meehan and is based on the 1993 film &quot;Dave&quot;.

As of 2022, Sills plays Monsieur Baudin in HBO&#x27;s &quot;The Gilded Age&quot;.

<doc id="1156624" wikidata="Q1211555" url="?curid=1156624" title="Commercial paper">
<text>Commercial paper, in the global financial market, is an unsecured promissory note with a fixed maturity of usually less than 270 days. In layperson terms, it is like an &quot;IOU&quot; but can be bought and sold because its buyers and sellers have some degree of confidence that it can be successfully redeemed later for cash, based on their assessment of the creditworthiness of the issuing company.

Commercial paper is a money-market security issued by large corporations to obtain funds to meet short-term debt obligations (for example, payroll) and is backed only by an issuing bank or company promise to pay the face amount on the maturity date specified on the note. Since it is not backed by collateral, only firms with excellent credit ratings from a recognized credit rating agency will be able to sell their commercial paper at a reasonable price. Commercial paper is usually sold at a discount from face value and generally carries lower interest repayment rates than bonds or corporate bonds due to the shorter maturities of commercial paper. Typically, the longer the maturity on a note, the higher the interest rate the issuing institution pays. Interest rates fluctuate with market conditions but are typically lower than banks&#x27; rates.

Commercial paper, though a short-term obligation, is typically issued as part of a continuous rolling program, which is either a number of years long (in Europe) or open-ended (in the United States).

==Overview==
As defined in United States law, commercial paper matures before nine months (270 days), and is only used to fund operating expenses or current assets (e.g., inventories and receivables) and not used for financing fixed assets, such as land, buildings, or machinery. By meeting these qualifications it may be issued without U.S. federal government regulation, that is, it need not be registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Commercial paper is a type of negotiable instrument, where the legal rights and obligations of involved parties are governed by Articles Three and Four of the Uniform Commercial Code, a set of laws adopted by 49 of the 50 states, Louisiana being the exception.

At the end of 2009, more than 1,700 companies in the United States issued commercial paper. As of October 31, 2008, the U.S. Federal Reserve reported seasonally adjusted figures for the end of 2007: there was $1.7807 trillion in total outstanding commercial paper; $801.3 billion was &quot;asset backed&quot; and $979.4 billion was not; $162.7 billion of the latter was issued by non-financial corporations, and $816.7 billion was issued by financial corporations.

Outside of the United States, the international Euro-Commercial Paper Market has over $500 billion in outstandings, made up of instruments denominated predominantly in euros, dollars and sterling.

==History==

Commercial credit (trade credit), in the form of promissory notes issued by corporations, has existed since at least the 19th century. For instance, Marcus Goldman, founder of Goldman Sachs, got his start trading commercial paper in New York in 1869.

==Issuance==


Commercial paper – though a short-term obligation – is issued as part of a continuous significantly longer rolling program, which is either a number of years long (as in Europe), or open-ended (as in the U.S.). Because the continuous commercial paper program is much longer than the individual commercial paper in the program (which cannot be longer than 270 days), as commercial paper matures it is replaced with newly issued commercial paper for the remaining amount of the obligation. If the maturity is less than 270 days, the issuer does not have to file a registrations statement with the SEC, which would mean delay and increased cost.

There are two methods of issuing credit. The issuer can market the securities directly to a buy and hold investor such as most money market funds. Alternatively, it can sell the paper to a dealer, who then sells the paper in the market. The dealer market for commercial paper involves large securities firms and subsidiaries of bank holding companies. Most of these firms also are dealers in US Treasury securities. Direct issuers of commercial paper usually are financial companies that have frequent and sizable borrowing needs and find it more economical to sell paper without the use of an intermediary. In the United States, direct issuers save a dealer fee of approximately 5 basis points, or 0.05% annualized, which translates to $50,000 on every $100 million outstanding. This saving compensates for the cost of maintaining a permanent sales staff to market the paper. Dealer fees tend to be lower outside the United States.

==Line of credit==
Commercial paper is a lower-cost alternative to a line of credit with a bank. Once a business becomes established, and builds a high credit rating, it is often cheaper to draw on a commercial paper than on a bank line of credit. Nevertheless, many companies still maintain bank lines of credit as a &quot;backup&quot;. Banks often charge fees for the amount of the line of the credit that &quot;does not&quot; have a balance, because under the capital regulatory regimes set out by the Basel Accords, banks must anticipate that such unused lines of credit will be drawn upon if a company gets into financial distress. They must therefore put aside equity capital to account for potential loan losses also on the currently unused part of lines of credit, and will usually charge a fee for the cost of this equity capital.&lt;br&gt;
Advantages of commercial paper:
* High credit ratings fetch a lower cost of capital.
* Wide range of maturity provide more flexibility.
* It does not create any lien on asset of the company.
* Tradability of Commercial Paper provides investors with exit options.

Disadvantages of commercial paper:
* Its usage is limited to only blue chip companies.
* Issuances of commercial paper bring down the bank credit limits.
* A high degree of control is exercised on issue of Commercial Paper.
* Stand-by credit may become necessary

==Commercial paper yields==
Like treasury bills, yields on commercial paper are quoted on a discount basis—the discount return to commercial paper holders is the annualized percentage difference between the price paid for the paper and the face value using a 360-day year. Specifically, where formula_1 is the discount yield, formula_2 is the face value, formula_3 is the price paid, and formula_4 is the term length of the paper in days: 
:formula_5

and when converted to a bond equivalent yield (formula_6):
:formula_7

==Defaults==
In case of default, the issuer of commercial paper (large corporate) would be debarred for 6 months and credit ratings would be dropped down from existing to &quot;Default&quot;.

Defaults on high quality commercial paper are rare, and cause concern when they occur. Notable examples include:
* On June 21, 1970, Penn Central filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and defaulted on approximately $77.1 million of commercial paper. This sparked a runoff in the commercial paper market of approximately $3 billion, causing the Federal Reserve to intervene by permitting commercial banks to borrow at the discount window. This placed a substantial burden on clients of the issuing dealer for Penn Central’s commercial paper, Goldman Sachs.
* On January 31, 1997, Mercury Finance, a major automotive lender, defaulted on a debt of $17 million, rising to $315 million. Effects were small, partly because default occurred during a robust economy.
* On September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers caused two money funds to break the buck, and led to Fed intervention in money market funds.

<text>Michael Moore (born December 4, 1954) is an American jazz musician who has lived in the Netherlands since 1982.

== Background and career==
The son of a semi-professional musician, Moore was born and raised in Eureka, California. He studied music at Humboldt State and in 1977 graduated from the New England Conservatory of Music, where he studied with Jaki Byard and Gunther Schuller, and was a classmate of Marty Ehrlich. He played in a variety of musical contexts, especially those in support of theatre and dance groups. By 1982 he was a regular member of Misha Mengelberg&#x27;s Instant Composers Pool and had moved to Amsterdam. He was also a member of Georg Gräwe&#x27;s Grubenklang Orchester.

Moore is one-third of the Clusone Trio (aka Trio Clusone and Clusone 3) with cellist Ernst Reijseger and drummer Han Bennink. Originally meant only to play a single date at a festival in Clusone, Italy, the trio toured irregularly for several years and recorded six albums, including one of freely-interpreted Irving Berlin compositions.

Moore&#x27;s first recording as a leader was in 1992 but it was with 1994&#x27;s &quot;Chicoutimi&quot; that he began to earn recognition as a composer. The drummerless trio on this album (Fred Hersch, piano, and Mark Helias, bass) was inspired by the duo recordings of Lee Konitz and Gil Evans and recalls in places the Jimmy Giuffre trios of the early 1960s.

Moore also plays in Jewels and Binoculars, a collective trio with bassist Lindsey Horner and drummer Michael Vatcher which is devoted to interpretations of Bob Dylan songs.
In 1986, Moore won the VPRO/Boy Edgar Award, the most prestigious jazz award in the Netherlands. In 1991, he founded Ramboy Records to document his music.

Moore started his jazz quintet in 2005, in which he works with accomplished Dutch players: trumpeter Eric Vloeimans, pianist Marc van Roon, bassist Paul Berner, and drummer Owen Hart, Jr. In October 2005, the quintet recorded the album &quot;Osiris&quot;.

In 2013, he performed with InstanPool, a group of international musicians making improved music and occasionally playing a composition. InstanPool consists of Michael Moore and Mark Alban Lotz (winds), Korhan Erel and Robert van Heumen (laptops), Sevket Akinci and Giray Gürkal (guitars, electronics). Some members are also in Islak Köpek.

<doc id="1156644" wikidata="Q1027716" url="?curid=1156644" title="Calvin Murphy">
<text>Calvin Jerome Murphy (born May 9, 1948) is an American former professional basketball player who after a prolific collegiate career at Niagara, where he averaged 33.1 points per game over his three years, played in the National Basketball Association as a guard for the San Diego/Houston Rockets from 1970 to 1983. He is a currently a member of the Houston Rockets&#x27; Space City Home Network broadcast team. Standing at a height of , Murphy has the distinction of being the shortest NBA player inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, and to play in an NBA All-Star Game (the latter since tied by Isaiah Thomas in 2016).

==Early years==
Before basketball, Calvin Murphy was a world-class baton twirler. He says he was &quot;bullied into it&quot; as his mother and all six of her sisters were twirlers. As an 8th grader, in 1963, he won a national championship in baton twirling. His reputation as a twirler earned him invitations to perform at major sporting events and the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair. In 1977, at the height of his basketball career in Houston, Murphy won the Texas State Men&#x27;s Twirling Championship.

He played basketball for Norwalk High School, where he was All-State three times and All-America twice. He is a member of the Connecticut Coaches Association Hall of Fame and a Connecticut Sportswriters Gold Key Award winner. Norwalk High School&#x27;s address is now 23 Calvin Murphy Rd. in his honor.

==College (1967–1970)==
Murphy attended Niagara University, where he was a three-time All-American. He scored 2,548 points in 77 games (33.1 points per game).

One of his best games was a 68-point outing against Syracuse University at Niagara&#x27;s Gallagher Center. In 1970, he led Niagara to the 1970 NCAA tournament and advanced to the second round, where they lost to Villanova. During his career he was famous for being one of &quot;The Three M&#x27;s&quot;, along with Pete Maravich and Rick Mount, both of whom were NCAA Men&#x27;s Division I Basketball All-Americans at the same time as Murphy.

Murphy is a member of the Alpha Nu Omega chapter of the Iota Phi Theta fraternity, being initiated alongside fellow future Hall of Famer Elvin Hayes.

==NBA (1970–1983)==
Murphy was drafted by the San Diego Rockets (now the Houston Rockets) as the first pick in the second round (18th overall) of the 1970 NBA draft. In his first season, after averaging 15.8 points and 4 assists per game, Murphy was nominated to the NBA All-Rookie team. A diminutive guard at , Murphy was known for his quickness and defensive ability. During the 1975 NBA Playoffs, Murphy averaged a postseason career-high of 24.4 points and 5.6 assists per game, as the Rockets advanced past the New York Knicks in the first round (Houston was in the Eastern Conference at the time), before being eliminated by the Boston Celtics in the semifinals. Two seasons later, on March 18, 1978, Murphy set a career high with 57 points scored during a 106–104 loss to the New Jersey Nets. The following year, he earned his only All-Star selection.

During the 1980-81 NBA season, Murphy played a key role in the Rockets making it to the NBA Finals. That postseason run, on April 17, 1981, Murphy led the Rockets to a decisive Western Conference Semifinals Game 7 win over the San Antonio Spurs with 42 points, a postseason career high. After advancing past the Kansas City Kings in the conference finals, in the 1981 NBA Finals Murphy and the Rockets lost to the Boston Celtics in a six-game series. Murphy retired in 1983.

Murphy was one of the best free-throw shooters in league history, setting NBA records for most consecutive free throws made and for the highest free throw percentage in a single season (1980–1981), though both records have since been broken. He set many other records within the Rockets organization, including that of all-time leading scorer until that record was broken in 1994 by Hakeem Olajuwon. Despite being among the shortest players in the league, Murphy was considered to be an &quot;enforcer&quot; due to his physical playing style and willingness to confront other players for hard fouls. Murphy was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1993.

==Post-NBA life==
After retirement, Murphy continued to work for the Rockets organization in numerous roles, mainly as television analyst for Rockets games. He is currently the halftime and post-game analyst for local Rockets broadcasts on AT&amp;T SportsNet.

In 2004, he faced trial in Houston for sexually abusing five of his daughters. He was acquitted of these charges in December of that year.

He hosted &quot;The Calvin Murphy Show&quot; on ESPN Radio&#x27;s Houston affiliate from 2007 until its cancellation in January 2010.

<text>Briggs &amp; Stratton Corporation is an American manufacturer of small engines with headquarters in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin.

Engine production averages 10 million units per year as of April 2015. The company reports that it has 13 large facilities in the U.S. and eight more in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Mexico, and the Netherlands. The company&#x27;s products are sold in over 100 countries across the globe.

==History==
In 1908, inventor Stephen Foster Briggs and investor Harold M. Stratton started an informal partnership to capitalize on the growing automobile industry. Eventually Briggs and Stratton settled on manufacturing automotive components and small gasoline engines.

In 1919 Briggs &amp; Stratton purchased the manufacturing rights for a small, simple two-seat vehicle with a gasoline engine called the Smith Flyer from the A.O. Smith Company in Milwaukee. The Flyer had a small gasoline engine mounted on a fifth wheel, or motor wheel. Briggs &amp; Stratton made engine improvements that raised the horsepower and renamed the vehicle the Briggs &amp; Stratton Flyer. The &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; lists the Flyer as the most inexpensive car of all time, selling at US$125 to US$150 (equivalent to $2020 to $2430 in 2021). In 1925 they sold the rights to the Flyer to Automotive Electric Services Corporation. Briggs &amp; Stratton kept the motor that had been the heart of the motor wheel and adapted it to power other applications such as reel lawn mowers and small equipment such as washing machines.

The company went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 1928.

During World War II, Briggs &amp; Stratton produced generators for the war effort. Some pre-war engines were made with aluminum, which helped the company develop its expertise in using this material. This development, along with the post-war growth of 1950s suburbs (and lawns), helped secure Briggs &amp; Stratton&#x27;s successful growth throughout the 1950s and 1960s.

Stephen Briggs went on to purchase Evinrude and Johnson Outboards and start the Outboard Marine Corporation. Frederick P. Stratton Sr. (the son of Harold Stratton) served as Chairman of Briggs &amp; Stratton until his death in 1962 (Harold also died that year). Frederick P. Stratton Jr. served as Chairman until his retirement in 2001.

In 1995, Briggs &amp; Stratton sold the automotive component business. The resulting company is Strattec Security Corporation.

In 2000, the company acquired its consumer generator business from the Beacon Group and formed Briggs &amp; Stratton Power Products. The Beacon Group had previously purchased the Consumer Products Division of Generac Corporation (now Generac Power Systems) in 1998. In 2005, the company added Simplicity Manufacturing Inc, and Snapper, Inc, to the Briggs &amp; Stratton Power Products line. Murray, Inc, one of its largest customers, collapsed owing the company $40 million, and to minimize the loss Briggs &amp; Stratton purchased the name, marketing rights and product designs of that company. In 2008, Briggs &amp; Stratton announced it would be acquiring the Victa Lawn Care business from GUD Holdings Limited Australia for A$23 million.

In 2019, Briggs &amp; Stratton announced they would be closing their engine factory in Murray, Kentucky, with production being moved to their Poplar Bluff, Missouri facility.

On July 20, 2020, Briggs &amp; Stratton filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. KPS Capital Partners purchased a majority of the company stake for $550 million.

On September 22, 2020 KPS Capital Partners closed on the acquisition of Briggs &amp; Stratton. This sale waives the $900 million that Briggs &amp; Stratton owed going into bankruptcy.

==Acquisitions, agreements and joint ventures==
* Farymann Diesel GmbH (1979–1984) – Based in Lampertheim (near Mannheim) in Germany, this was the first foreign acquisition Briggs &amp; Stratton had ever made and was a poor fit with the company&#x27;s acknowledged expertise in high volume, low cost production. They officially completed the acquisition on May 29, 1979. Despite investing in new production methods, Briggs &amp; Stratton never understood the very low volume, highly customized nature of the air-cooled diesel engine market. After considering adding Italy&#x27;s Lombardini to increase its presence in the diesel market, as well as a failed attempt to develop its own designs, Briggs &amp; Stratton accepted defeat and sold the company to a private investor for a minimal amount to avoid further liabilities. Since the energy crisis had not affected the US market&#x27;s preference for gasoline engines, enthusiasm waned rapidly at management level for diesel engines.
* Daihatsu Briggs &amp; Stratton (DBS) – In an effort to stave off Japanese competition during the 1980s, Briggs &amp; Stratton entered a 50/50 joint venture with the Toyota subsidiary Daihatsu Motor Company in Japan. Located in Shiga Prefecture ( from Osaka, Japan), construction on the then- plant began in December 1986 and was completed in April 1987. This joint venture was notable for the manufacture of vertical and horizontal crankshaft engines from 12.5 to under the Vanguard brand. Today the plant employs roughly 100 people on two shifts and manufactures Vanguard V-twin engines ranging from 14 to . By the end of 2017, Briggs &amp; Stratton is planning to move the production of Vanguard V-twin from Japan to USA 
* The Mitsubishi Agreement – The Vanguard line initially consisted of three single-cylinder engines and several V-twin engines. The V-twins, made by DBS, had sold very well but the single-cylinder engine models, originally produced at Briggs &amp; Stratton&#x27;s Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin plant, didn&#x27;t fare so well. Briggs &amp; Stratton needed to solve this problem, so, following discussions with several Japanese engine manufacturers, it entered into an agreement with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. of Tokyo, Japan. Briggs &amp; Stratton produced only certain parts for the engines, while Mitsubishi was responsible for overall production and shipping. The completed single-cylinder engines were shipped directly to customers worldwide. Briggs &amp; Stratton had exclusive marketing rights for the resulting products only in North America, Europe and Australia/New Zealand. MHI had exclusive marketing rights (under their own brand name) in Malaysia, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan. In other countries both companies competed with the same product under their own brand names which led to considerable friction, and together with escalating production costs in Japan, caused this otherwise successful relationship to fail. Briggs &amp; Stratton commenced marketing alternative U.S.-made single-cylinder engines under the Vanguard brand in early 2007.
* The Komatsu Zenoah Venture – In May 1987, Briggs &amp; Stratton entered into an agreement with yet another Japanese company, executing a 10-year contract with the Komatsu Zenoah Company of Tachikawa, Japan. Under the terms of the contract, Komatsu would manufacture a 2-cycle, 4 hp (3 kW) engine, in which Briggs &amp; Stratton would purchase and distribute in the United States, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. Said Fred Stratton, &quot;This venture was not successful, because the rising price of the yen made the engine too expensive in the U.S.&quot;
* The Toro Agreement – In 1999, Briggs &amp; Stratton made a license agreement with The Toro Company of Bloomington, Minnesota. to produce the Toro R*Tek piston ported version of their E series 2-stroke engine (AKA Lawn-Boy DuraForce) for use in Toro Snow Throwers. The engine was a 141cc 2-cycle that produced from 4 hp to 6.5 hp at 3700 to 4000 rpm on a 50:1 gas &amp; oil mix. A higher power 7-HP model was made (Engine Model# 84330) for use in heavier duty machines such as the single stage Snow Commander (2001–2008) and 2 stage Power Max 726TE/6000 (2004–2008); the extra horsepower was obtained using transfer ports in the piston and cylinder wall, and this model ran at the same operating speed as the 6.5 hp engines (4000rpm). Production stopped in 2011.

==Innovations==
*The aluminum engine – This was introduced in 1953 as a means of having a lighter-weight engine for applications such as rotary lawn mowers. It was improved five years later in 1958 with the introduction of the Kool-Bore (all aluminum) and Sleeve-Bore (aluminum, with a cast iron cylinder liner).
*Easy-Spin Starting – This compression release, implemented as an extra hump on the intake lobe of the camshaft, was introduced in 1961 to reduce the effort required to start an engine. In 1982, a new U.S. federal safety regulation required lawnmower blades to stop spinning within three seconds of the operator letting go of the handle. The least costly, most common way of complying with the new regulation was to put a flywheel brake on the mower engine, to stop the engine (and therefore the blade) immediately when the handle was released. Briggs &amp; Stratton engineers found engines with the Easy-Spin camshaft were unacceptably difficult to restart after being braked to a quick stop. The Easy-Spin lobe hump was moved to the exhaust valve, but this reduced engine performance. The intake-side Easy-Spin remained in use on Briggs &amp; Stratton&#x27;s engines larger than those used on mowers subject to the brake requirement, but was discontinued in 1997 due to tightening emission regulations.
*The Synchro-Balanced Engine – This 1966 innovation was designed to attenuate vibration caused by the reciprocating mass of a single-cylinder engine. The design was a series of counterweights opposing the crankpin.
*The Twin Cylinder Engine – This engine was introduced in 1977 as a means of competing with Briggs &amp; Stratton&#x27;s rivals, particularly Japanese firms like Honda who were cutting into traditional Briggs &amp; Stratton markets by producing lawn mower engines (and later, complete lawn mowers). These first models were rated 16 hp (11.9 kW) and displaced 40 cubic inches (656 cc), but were joined in 1979 by 42 cubic inch (694 cc) models rated at 18 hp (13.4 kW). The original price for the version was $70 lower (at US$228) than their single-cylinder cast-iron version bearing the same power rating.
*Industrial/Commercial (I/C) – This series of engines, initially ranging from 3 to , was introduced in 1979 as Briggs &amp; Stratton&#x27;s answer to high quality commercial-duty engines produced by competitors. These engines include heavy-duty features such as Stellite exhaust valves, upgraded bearings, cast iron sleeved cylinder bores and high-capacity air cleaners.
*The Briggs &amp; Stratton Gasoline/Electric Hybrid Car – In 1980, at the tail end of the energy crisis, Briggs &amp; Stratton developed the first gasoline-electric hybrid automobile concept car. &quot;The Hybrid&quot; was designed by Brooks Stevens, had six wheels and was powered by a twin-cylinder 16 hp (11.9 kW) Briggs &amp; Stratton engine and a large bank of 6v lead-acid electric batteries. Only the second axle was driven, with an extra rear axle added to support the weight of the batteries.
*Magnetron Ignition – This solid-state ignition system introduced by Briggs &amp; Stratton in 1982 eliminated the points-and-condenser system, the performance of which steadily degraded between required periodic maintenance service. Magnetron was made available for to Briggs &amp; Stratton engines made since 1963. Competitor Tecumseh had made a capacitor discharge ignition setup since 1968 for their cast iron engine models, expanding its availability and making it standard equipment on vertical shaft engines powering lawn mowers in late 1976, five years before the advent of the Briggs Magnetron. Defunct competitor Clinton Engines commercialized a piezo &quot;Spark Pump&quot; ignition without breaker points in the early 1960s.

==Logo history==
The Briggs &amp; Stratton logo was always a masthead, but it has been changed several times over the course of the company&#x27;s 80-plus years.

*Pre War logos (1931–1943) – This logo started off with a diamond shape and read Briggs &amp; Stratton and its home city of MILWAUKEE, WIS., U.S.A. below it; in the middle, it had the words 4 CYCLE on the top mast and the words GASOLINE MOTOR and phrase MADE IN U.S.A. on the bottom mast. About 1934 Briggs &amp; Stratton added the more familiar shape of a diamond split across the center with a banner.
*Gold Logo (1948–1963) – This logo had the name BRIGGS STRATTON and its home city of MILWAUKEE, WIS., U.S.A. below it; in the middle, it had the words 4 CYCLE on the top mast and the words GASOLINE ENGINE and phrase MADE IN U.S.A. on the bottom mast.
*Gold Logo (II) (1963–1976) – Although similar to the last logo, this had differently arranged wording: The name BRIGGS STRATTON was written in a new logotype, however, this design also included the horsepower rating above the gold logo in the white field, its city of location was in the middle as before, only this time the patent numbers were eliminated (if you look at a decal on a production engine) from the bottom portion of the mast. There were some engines produced until 1977 that used the prior logo from 1948.
*The Red, White, and Black Logo (1976–present) – This is the company&#x27;s current logo. The logo has the name BRIGGS STRATTON in black letters on the white midsection of the masthead. The words 4 CYCLE ENGINE are on the red top portion of the mast and the city line MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN, U.S.A. is written on the black bottom portion of the mast. Although the logo hasn&#x27;t been changed much since then, the wording on the top and bottom sections of the mast were removed in 1985, although the company continued to use these two sections with the respective wordings ORIGINAL (red section) and SERVICE PARTS (black section) until 1989.

<text>Perry Morris Robinson (September 17, 1938 – December 2, 2018) was an American jazz clarinetist and composer. He was the son of composer Earl Robinson.

==Early life and education==
Robinson was born and grew up in New York City. He attended the Lenox School of Jazz in Massachusetts in mid-1959. 

== Career ==
Robinson served in a U.S. military band in the early-1960s. His first record, &quot;Funk Dumpling&quot; (with Kenny Barron, Henry Grimes, and Paul Motian) was recorded by Savoy in 1962. He also appeared with Grimes on &quot;The Call&quot; in 1965, on the ESP-Disk label (ESP 1026). Although the album is credited to &quot;Henry Grimes Trio&quot; the album liner notes, written by ESP-Disk label head Bernard Stollman, stated: &quot;[Grimes] chose Perry Robinson, a virtuoso who merits far wider recognition, to pair with, and this recording reflects both of their contributions, in equal measure. A more accurate title for the album would be Henry Grimes/Perry Robinson.&quot; Two of the album&#x27;s six songs are credited to Robinson, including the title track.

From 1973, Robinson worked with Jeanne Lee and Gunter Hampel&#x27;s Galaxie Dream Band. He contributed to Dave Brubeck&#x27; s &quot;Two Generations of Brubeck&quot;, and played with Burton Greene&#x27; s Dutch klezmer band, Klezmokum. He was the featured clarinetist on Archie Shepp&#x27;s LP &quot;Mama Too Tight&quot; on the Impulse! label. He led his own groups in performances and on record, with albums on the Chiaroscuro, WestWind, and Timescraper labels. More recently, he worked with William Parker and Walter Perkins on &quot;Bob&#x27;s Pink Cadillac&quot; and several discs on the CIMP label.

From 1975 until 1977, Robinson was a member of the Clarinet Contrast group, which featured German clarinet players Theo Jörgensmann and Bernd Konrad. He recorded with Lou Grassi as a member of his PoBand since the late Nineties, and with Lou Grassi, Wayne Lopes and Luke Faust in The Jug Jam, an improvisational jug band. He plays in a free jazz and world music trio along with tabla player Badal Roy and bassist Ed Schuller, with whom he recorded the CD &quot;Raga Roni&quot;. He played with Darius Brubeck and Muruga Booker in the MBR jazz trio. Robinson also played an integral part in the formation of Cosmic Legends, an improvisational music/performance group led by composer/pianist Sylvie Degiez which included musicians Rashied Ali, Wayne Lopes, Hayes Greenfield, and Michael Hashim. In 2005 he was featured on his cousin Jeffrey Lewis&#x27; album &quot;City and Eastern Songs&quot; on Rough Trade Records, produced by Kramer. A later release was &quot;OrthoFunkOlogy&quot; in 2008 with the band Free Funk, also featuring Muruga Booker, Badal Roy, Richie Shakin&#x27; Nagan and Shakti Ma Booker.

His autobiography, &quot;Perry Robinson: The Traveler&quot; (co-authored by Florence F. Wetzel), was published in 2002.

== Personal life ==
Robinson died in Jersey City, New Jersey, in December 2018, at the age of 80.

<text>Melbourne tram route 75 is operated by Yarra Trams on the Melbourne tram network from Vermont South to Central Pier. The 22.8 kilometre route is operated out of Camberwell depot with A and B class trams. It is the longest route on the network.

==History==

The origins of route 75 lie in separate tram lines, Australia&#x27;s first cable tram from Bourke Street to Hawthorn Bridge and a horse tram from Hawthorn Bridge to Auburn Road, which was converted to an electric line and extended over many years to its current terminus at Vermont South.

The first cable tram line opened by the Melbourne Tramway &amp; Omnibus Company was from Bourke Street to Hawthorn Bridge along Spencer Street, Flinders Street, Wellington Parade and Bridge Road opened on 11 November 1885. On 27 January 1889 a horse tram from Hawthorn Bridge to Auburn Road, travelling via Burwood Road, Power Street and Riversdale Road was opened. The Hawthorn Tramways Trust (HTT) closed the horse tramway for conversion to electric traction on 31 January 1916, with the electric line opening in two stages; Power Street to Auburn Road along Riversdale Road opening on 7 May 1916, and from Hawthorn Bridge to Riversdale Road along Burwood Road and Power Street on 21 June 1916.

The Riversdale Road line was extended by the HTT on 31 May 1916 to Bowen Street in Camberwell, along Riversdale Road and Camberwell Road and passing through Camberwell Junction. It was extended a week later on 10 June 1916 to Boundary Road (now Warrigal Road) in Burwood, along Camberwell Road and Norwood Road (now Toorak Road). The Melbourne &amp; Metropolitan Tramways Board (MMTB) converted the Bourke Street to Hawthorn Bridge cable line to electric traction in three stages, closing the line on 29 June 1927. Reopening with electric trams running from Lonsdale Street, a short electric extension to the previous cable terminus of Bourke Street, to Swanston Street on 14 July 1927, from Swanston Street to Simpson Street on 17 September 1927, and Simpson Street to Hawthorn Bridge on 4 December 1927.

Throughout 1934, Hawthorn and Camberwell depot services were allocated route numbers. Route 74 was allocated the service between the Batman Avenue tram terminus in the City (route 70&#x27;s long-time terminus until 1999) and the Burwood terminus via Swan Street on 9 December, while route 27 was allocated the service between Spencer Street and Hawthorn tram depot via Bridge Road on 6 June. Route 75 was a short-working service of route 74 between the Batman Avenue terminus and Smith Road at Hartwell. Route 27&#x27;s terminus in the City was extended slightly north to terminate at La Trobe Street, when the MMTB opened the La Trobe Street line on 15 January 1951. Initially, services on weekday daytime and Saturday mornings were also extended to Brunswick Street but the through-routing ceased just a month later on 26 February, due to congestion on Flinders Street hampering on-time running of the Hawthorn service.

In February 1965, Hawthorn tram depot closed, and routes 74 and 75 were re-routed via Bridge Road towards the Spencer Street terminus, replacing route 27. Operation of the routes along Bridge Road was also passed to Camberwell tram depot. From 1 August 1977, Z-class trams were attached to Camberwell depot and commenced operating route 74 in readiness for an East Burwood extension. The MMTB viewed the new trams as desirable for the proposed line addition. On 12 July 1978, the terminus of the Burwood line and route 74 were slightly shifted east to Somers Street. Just a week later, on 19 July 1978, the Burwood line was extended a further 3.4 kilometres to Middleborough Road in Burwood East, and the entire line ran as route 75 while route 74 (City to Somers Street) became the short-working of route 75. The line was now exclusively operated by Z-class trams.

Beginning 16 March 1981, Z3-class trams were allocated to Camberwell depot for route 75. Entering service on 19 December 1984, B1-class 2001 was allotted to Camberwell depot and began operating route 75; it was joined at the depot with B1-class 2002 from 17 December 1985. The two B1s were reallocated on 20 November 1987 to route 96 after the St Kilda Beach &quot;light rail&quot; extension opened. From 19 December 1993, B2-class trams were assigned to Camberwell depot and began operating route 75. Due to a Camberwell depot Z3 shortage, A-class trams were allocated there and started operating the route from 28 March 1994. All Z-class trams assigned to Camberwell depot besides two Z3s—because of an A2-class shortage—were reallocated by January 1996 for the eventual network privatisation. The two Z3s would leave the depot by 1997, ending Z-class running on route 75.

On 8 July 1993, the line was extended to Blackburn Road. In December that year, at the Spencer Street end, the route was amended to terminate at a new siding north of La Trobe Street (along with route 48) so that terminating trams were out of the way of through trams on La Trobe and Spencer Streets. During the 1999 election campaign, the Labor State Opposition committed to extend route 75 to Knox City Shopping Centre. Labor won the election, but the line was only extended to its current terminus at Vermont South on 23 July 2005, with a connecting route 732 bus operated by Ventura Bus Lines. At 22.8 kilometres, it became the longest line on the network. The Public Transport Users Association has campaigned for the line to be extended to its originally proposed terminus.

On 4 May 2003, the route was changed at the City end to terminate at Flinders Street, west of Spencer Street, swapping route termini with route 70, and it no longer ran along Spencer Street. Between May and November 2005, the route temporarily terminated at Market Street due to the closure and demolition of the King Street Overpass in Flinders Street. After the works were completed, on 21 November 2005, the route was reinstated along Flinders Street and Spencer Street, and terminated at La Trobe Street one more. On 26 January 2014, the route was changed to terminate at Central Pier and no longer served Spencer Street.

In January 2016, route 75 began operating through the night on Fridays and Saturdays as part of the Night Network.

==Route==
Route 75 runs Central Pier along Flinders Street and continues past Flinders Street station, St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, and Federation Square, entering East Melbourne east along Wellington Parade and into Richmond continuing east on Bridge Road.

At Hawthorn Bridge it crosses the Yarra River into Hawthorn and continues east on Burwood Road, it briefly travels south on Power Street before turning east into Riversdale Road, traversing Hawthorn and Hawthorn East. At Camberwell Junction it crosses Burke Road and travels south east along Camberwell Road.

It enters Toorak Road and heads east, at Warrigal Road Toorak Road becomes the Burwood Highway, it continues east, past Deakin University and through Burwood East, to its terminus in Vermont South.

==Operation==
Route 75 is operated out of Camberwell depot with B-class trams, although A-class trams are occasionally used.

==Controversy over accessibility==
During the extension of the route from Burwood to Vermont South, all new stops were constructed as wheelchair accessible, low-floor platforms, with many other stops along the route converted to accessible platforms.

There has been controversy in the local newspaper, as even though the platforms are wheelchair accessible, the route is operated with high floor trams with steps. The upgrade has been criticised as a waste of money, because passengers using wheelchairs and other mobility-impaired passengers are still limited from accessing trams on the route.

<doc id="1156658" wikidata="Q235291" url="?curid=1156658" title="Jung Chang">
<text>Jung Chang (, ; born 25 March 1952) is a Chinese-born British author. She is best known for her family autobiography &quot;Wild Swans&quot;, selling over 10 million copies worldwide but banned in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Her 832-page biography of Mao Zedong, &quot;&quot;, written with her husband, the Irish historian Jon Halliday, was published in June 2005.

==Life in China==
Chang was born on 25 March 1952 in Yibin, Sichuan as the second daughter and child of five children. Her parents were both Chinese Communist Party officials, and her father was greatly interested in literature. As a child she quickly developed a love of reading and writing, which included composing poetry.

As Party cadres, life was relatively good for her family at first; her parents worked hard, and her father became successful as a propagandist at a regional level. His formal ranking was as a &quot;level 10 official&quot;, meaning that he was one of 20,000 or so most important cadres, or &quot;ganbu&quot;, in the country. The Communist Party provided her family with a dwelling in a guarded, walled compound, a maid and chauffeur, as well as a wet-nurse and nanny for Chang and her four siblings.

Chang writes that she was originally named Er-hong (), which sounds like the Chinese word for &quot;faded red&quot;. As communists were &quot;deep red&quot;, she asked her father to rename her when she was 12 years old, specifying she wanted &quot;a name with a military ring to it.&quot; He suggested &quot;&quot;, which means &quot;martial affairs.&quot;

===Cultural Revolution===
Like many of her peers, Chang chose to become a Red Guard at the age of 14, during the early years of the Cultural Revolution. In &quot;Wild Swans&quot; she said she was &quot;keen to do so&quot;, &quot;thrilled by my red armband&quot;. In her memoirs, Chang states that she refused to participate in the attacks on her teachers and other Chinese, and she left after a short period as she found the Red Guards too violent.

The failures of the Great Leap Forward had led her parents to oppose Mao Zedong&#x27;s policies. They were targeted during the Cultural Revolution, as most high-ranking officials were. When Chang&#x27;s father criticized Mao by name, Chang writes in &quot;Wild Swans&quot; that this exposed them to retaliation from Mao&#x27;s supporters. Her parents were publicly humiliated – ink was poured over their heads, they were forced to wear placards denouncing them around their necks, kneel in gravel and to stand outside in the rain – followed by imprisonment, her father&#x27;s treatment leading to lasting physical and mental illness. Their careers were destroyed, and her family was forced to leave their home.

Before her parents&#x27; denunciation and imprisonment, Chang had unquestioningly supported Mao and criticized herself for any momentary doubts. But by the time of his death, her respect for Mao, she writes, had been destroyed. Chang wrote that when she heard he had died, she had to bury her head in the shoulder of another student to pretend she was grieving. She explained her change on the stance of Mao with the following comments:

Chang&#x27;s depiction of the Chinese people as having been &quot;programmed&quot; by Maoism would ring forth in her subsequent writings.

According to &quot;Wild Swans&quot; (chapters 23 to 28), Chang&#x27;s life during the Cultural Revolution and the years immediately after the Cultural Revolution was one of both a victim and one of the privileged. Chang attended Sichuan University in 1973 and became one of the so-called &quot;Students of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers&quot;. Her father&#x27;s government-sponsored official funeral was held in 1975. Chang was able to leave China and study in the UK on a Chinese government scholarship in 1978, a year before the post-Mao Reforms began.

===Studying English===
The closing down of the university system led Chang, like most of her generation, away from the political maelstroms of the academy. Instead, she spent several years as a peasant, a barefoot doctor (a part-time peasant doctor), a steelworker and an electrician, though she received no formal training because of Mao&#x27;s policy, which did not require formal instruction as a prerequisite for such work.

The universities were eventually re-opened and she gained a place at Sichuan University to study English, later becoming an assistant lecturer there. After Mao&#x27;s death, she passed an exam which allowed her to study in the West, and her application to leave China was approved once her father was politically rehabilitated. 

==Life in Britain==

===Academic background===
Chang left China in 1978 to study in Britain on a government scholarship, staying first in London. She later moved to Yorkshire, studying linguistics at the University of York with a scholarship from the university itself, living in Derwent College, York. She received her PhD in linguistics from York in 1982, becoming the first person from the People&#x27;s Republic of China to be awarded a PhD from a British university. In 1986, she and Jon Halliday published &quot;Mme Sun Yat-sen (Soong Ching-ling)&quot;, a biography of Sun Yat-Sen&#x27;s widow.

She has also been awarded honorary doctorates from University of Buckingham, University of York, University of Warwick, University of Dundee, the Open University, University of West London, and Bowdoin College (USA). She lectured for some time at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, before leaving in the 1990s to concentrate on her writing.

===New experiences===
In 2003, Jung Chang wrote a new foreword to &quot;Wild Swans&quot;, describing her early life in Britain and explaining why she wrote the book. Having lived in China during the 1960s and 1970s, she found Britain exciting and loved the country, especially its diverse range of culture, literature and arts. She found even colorful window-boxes worth writing home about – Hyde Park and the Kew Gardens were inspiring. She took every opportunity to watch Shakespeare&#x27;s plays in both London and York. In an interview with HarperCollins, Chang stated: &quot;I feel perhaps my heart is still in China&quot;.

Chang lives in west London with her husband, the Irish historian Jon Halliday, who specializes in history of Asia. She was able to visit mainland China to see her family, with permission from the Chinese authorities, despite the fact that all her books are banned.

===Celebrity===
The publication of Jung Chang&#x27;s second book &quot;Wild Swans&quot; made her a celebrity. Chang&#x27;s unique style, using a personal description of the life of three generations of Chinese women to highlight the many changes that the country went through, proved to be highly successful. Large numbers of sales were generated, and the book&#x27;s popularity led to its being sold around the world and translated into nearly 40 languages.

Chang became a popular figure for talks about Communist China; and she has travelled across Britain, Europe, America, and many other places in the world. She returned to the University of York on 14 June 2005, to address the university&#x27;s debating union and spoke to an audience of over 300, most of whom were students. The BBC invited her onto the panel of &quot;Question Time&quot; for a first-ever broadcast from Shanghai on 10 March 2005, but she was unable to attend when she broke her leg a few days beforehand.

Chang was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2024 New Year Honours for services to literature and history.

==Publications==

===&quot;Wild Swans&quot;===
The international best-seller is a biography of three generations of Chinese women in 20th century China – her grandmother, mother, and herself. Chang paints a vivid portrait of the political and military turmoil of China in this period, from the marriage of her grandmother to a warlord, to her mother&#x27;s experience of Japanese-occupied Jinzhou during the Second Sino-Japanese War, and her own experience of the effects of Mao&#x27;s policies of the 1950s and 1960s.

&quot;Wild Swans&quot; was translated into 38 languages and sold 20 million copies, receiving praise from authors such as J. G. Ballard. It is banned in mainland China, though many pirated versions circulated, as do translations in Hong Kong and Taiwan.

===&quot;Mao: The Unknown Story&quot;===

Chang&#x27;s 2005 work, a biography of Mao, was co-authored with her husband Jon Halliday and portrays Mao in an extremely negative light. The couple traveled all over the world to research the book, which took 12 years to write. They interviewed hundreds of people who had known Mao, including George H. W. Bush, Henry Kissinger, and Tenzin Gyatso, the Dalai Lama. Kissinger called it &quot;grotesque in that it depicts Mao as a man without any qualities.&quot; Later, he described it in his book &quot;On China&quot; as &quot;one-sided but often thought-provoking.&quot;

Among their criticisms of Mao, Chang and Halliday argue that despite his having been born into a relatively rich peasant family, he had little well-informed concern for the long-term welfare of the Chinese peasantry. They hold Mao responsible for the famine resulting from the Great Leap Forward and state that he had created the famine by exporting food when China had insufficient grain to feed its own people. They also write that Mao had arranged for the arrests and murders of many of his political opponents, including some of his personal friends, and they argue that he was a far more tyrannical leader than had previously been thought.

&quot;Mao: The Unknown Story&quot; became a best-seller, with UK sales alone reaching 60,000 in six months. Academics and commentators wrote reviews ranging from praise to criticism. Professor Richard Baum said that it had to be &quot;taken very seriously as the most thoroughly researched and richly documented piece of synthetic scholarship&quot; on Mao. &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; reported that while few commentators disputed it, &quot;some of the world&#x27;s most eminent scholars of modern Chinese history&quot; had referred to the book as &quot;a gross distortion of the records.&quot;

Historian Rebecca Karl summarized its negative reception, writing, &quot;According to many reviewers of [&quot;Mao: The Unknown Story&quot;], the story told therein is unknown because Chang and Halliday substantially fabricated it or exaggerated it into existence.&quot;

===&quot;Empress Dowager Cixi&quot;===

In October 2013, Chang published a biography of Empress Dowager Cixi, who led China from 1861 until her death in 1908. Chang argues that Cixi has been &quot;deemed either tyrannical and vicious, or hopelessly incompetent—or both,&quot; and that this view is both simplistic and inaccurate. Chang portrays her as intelligent, open-minded, and a proto-feminist limited by a xenophobic and deeply conservative imperial bureaucracy. Although Cixi is often accused of reactionary conservatism (especially for her treatment of the Guangxu Emperor during and after the Hundred Days&#x27; Reform), Chang argues that Cixi actually started the Reforms and &quot;brought medieval China into the modern age.&quot; Newspaper reviews have also been positive in their assessment. Te-Ping Chen, writing in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, found the book &quot;packed with details that bring to life its central character.&quot; Simon Sebag Montefiore writes: &quot;Filled with new revelations, it’s a gripping and surprising story of an extraordinary woman in power. Using Chinese sources, totally untapped by western books, this reappraises one of the great monstresses of modern history… Jung Chang’s revisionism means that this book reveals a new and different woman: ambitious, sometimes murderous, but pragmatic and unique. All of this adds up to make Empress Dowager Cixi a powerful read.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; named it one of its &#x27;Notable Books of the Year&#x27;.

The book received critical treatment in the academic world. The Qing dynasty specialist Pamela Kyle Crossley wrote a skeptical review in the &quot;London Review of Books&quot;. &quot;Chang has made impressive use of the rapidly expanding range of published material from the imperial archives. But understanding these sources requires profound study of the context. [...] Her claims regarding Cixi’s importance seem to be minted from her own musings, and have little to do with what we know was actually going in China. I am as eager as anyone to see more attention paid to women of historical significance. But rewriting Cixi as Catherine the Great or Margaret Thatcher is a poor bargain: the gain of an illusory icon at the expense of historical sense.&quot;

<doc id="1156663" wikidata="Q2814126" url="?curid=1156663" title="Konvas">
<text>Konvas () is the general name of portable 35mm motion-picture cameras that was manufactured in the USSR by KMZ (KRASNOGORSKIY MEKHANICHESKIY ZAVOD – Krasnogorsk Mechanical Works), known as ZENIT camera makers, and later on, MOSKINAP (MOSKOVSKIY ZAVOD KINOAPPARATURIY – Moscow Works of Cinema Equipment (The holder of the Order of the Badge of Honour – Орден «Знак Почета»), at one time in the late 80&#x27;s had over 2,000 employees; now OAO &quot;MOSKINAP&quot;, and for a short period at the same factory after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The factory was manufacturing Laser soundheads, and 35mm sound projectors originally were made by Odessa PO KINAP some time ago. The camera line is no longer made, although many working models are still circulating at reasonable prices worldwide. The name &quot;Konvas&quot; is a portmanteau that comes from the first three letters of the last and first name of the camera&#x27;s designer, KONSTANTINOV VASILY ().

Later renamed to Konvas-Avtomat (Automatic) for electric-driven models.

Initially, the camera was used widely by fiction, documentary, and news cameramen throughout the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. The relatively small size of Konvas cameras and its low price (it often sells for almost the same price as the more primitive, older Bell &amp; Howell Eyemo) makes it popular with independent filmmakers throughout the world to this day. There are very good and useful modifications for these cameras these days. You might be surprised for some prices, but its functionality is much more valuable than its price always.

Konvas cameras are reflex, using a spinning mirrored shutter, allowing the operator to view the scene through the main lens during filming. Because of the camera&#x27;s movement mechanism, the shutter opening is 155° as opposed to the 180° which is standard on many other cameras. Consequently, the shutter speed is slightly higher, for which the exposure must be compensated from the usual 24fps frames per second light meter setting by 1/3 of an f/stop. It has an extended dwell time for film transport like in ARRI 35 series, thus provides more steadiness despite it has no register pin. Some models including −2M and 8M accept a single OCT-19 mount lens, others have a three lens turret including −1M and 7M.

All Konvas cameras accept a 60-meter (slightly less than 200 ft) load of film via a detachable camera magazine, some also accept a 120-meter (roughly 400 ft) detachable magazine. The magazines are very easy to change, however; they are not easy to load and often present a challenge for camera assistants not familiar with the Konvas magazine.

The Konvas runs on an electric 12 Volt DC motor mainly. Some are capable of running at very accurate &quot;X-tal Sync&quot; speeds @ 8, 12, 16, 24, 25, 32fps via 17EP-16 APK, 18EP-16 APK and 19EP-16APK motor drives while 15EPSS motor drive provides electric regulated speeds. The camera is noisy (about 55dB), making sound recording difficult, so it can be used as a MOS camera. This was not a problem in the Soviet Union, as Soviet cinema usually re-recorded all sound during editing via a process called &quot;ADR&quot; or &quot;dubbing/looping&quot;.

<text>Nine Lives is the ninth album by Bonnie Raitt, released in 1986. It was Raitt&#x27;s most difficult release, due to the poor sales, negative reviews, and general circumstances surrounding its release.

==History==

&quot;In 1983 there was a corporate sweep at Warner&#x27;s, coming from upstairs, and they needed to trim the fat,&quot; Raitt recalled in 1990. &quot;I just had completed an album called &quot;Tongue &amp; Groove&quot;, which was produced by Rob Fraboni, who had also done &quot;Green Light&quot;. And I don&#x27;t think they maliciously said, &#x27;Let&#x27;s let her finish her album and get the tour all lined up and print the covers and hire the people to do the video and then drop her.&#x27; You know, ha, ha, ha. But that&#x27;s what they did. It was literally the day after I had finished mastering it. I had already finished the album once, and [Warner&#x27;s claimed] the Jerry Williams tune would be more commercial if it didn&#x27;t have quite as reggae a beat. Or something like that. So I went in and redid it. I thought if I cooperated a little more, maybe they&#x27;d promote the album more. But instead they dropped me and pulled the rug out from under my tour. I thought the way they did it was real crummy. They sent a letter. I think I suffered from not having a relationship with the A&amp;R department there, because I had an independent production deal...&quot;

Raitt could have purchased the master tapes and released the album elsewhere, but Warner&#x27;s asking price was considered too high. &quot;They told me I can take the tapes and shop them around,&quot; said Raitt, &quot;but they wanted about $500,000 for them, and nobody wanted to pay that much...&quot;

The material for &quot;Tongue &amp; Groove&quot; was shelved until two years later when &quot;Warner&#x27;s suddenly said they were going to put the record out,&quot; Raitt recalled. &quot;I said it wasn&#x27;t really fair. I think at this point they felt kind of bad. I mean, I was out there touring on my savings to keep my name up, and my ability to draw was less and less. So they agreed to let me go in and recut half of it.&quot; The result was &quot;Nine Lives&quot;, which was finally released in 1986.

The song &quot;Stand Up to the Night&quot; was used in the film Extremities with Farrah Fawcett.

<text>Trastevere () is the 13th of Rome, Italy. It is identified by the initials R. XIII and it is located within Municipio I. Its name comes from Latin ().

Its coat of arms depicts a golden head of a lion on a red background, the meaning of which is uncertain.

==History==

In Rome&#x27;s Regal period (753–509 BC), the area across the Tiber belonged to the Etruscans: the Romans named it &quot;Ripa Etrusca&quot; (Etruscan bank). Rome conquered it to gain control of and access to the river from both banks, but was not interested in building on that side of the river. In fact, the only connection between Trastevere and the rest of the city was a small wooden bridge called the &quot;Pons Sublicius&quot; (English: &#x27;bridge on wooden piles&#x27;).

By the time of the Republic BC, the number of sailors and fishermen making a living from the river had increased, and many had taken up residence in Trastevere. Immigrants from the East also settled there, mainly Jews and Syrians. The area began to be considered part of the city under Augustus, who divided Rome into 14 regions (&quot;regiones&quot; in Latin); modern Trastevere was the XIV and was called &quot;Trans Tiberim&quot;.

Since the end of the Roman Republic the quarter was also the center of an important Jewish community, which lived there until the end of the Middle Ages. Rome&#x27;s oldest remaining synagogue, though not used as such any longer, is found in the district. The building was constructed in 980, and became a synagogue in 1073 through the efforts of lexicographer Nathan ben Yechiel. Within the building there was also a mikveh. At the base of the central column Hebrew writing is still visible. Its use as a synagogue ended when the Jews were forced to move to the Roman ghetto on the other side of the Tiber river in the mid-16th century. It is now used commercially, and can be found at 14, Vicolo dell’Atleta.

With the wealth of the Imperial Age, several important figures decided to build their &quot;villae&quot; in Trastevere, including Clodia, (Catullus&#x27; &quot;friend&quot;) and Julius Caesar (his garden villa, the &quot;Horti Caesaris&quot;). The &quot;regio&quot; included two of the most ancient churches in Rome, the &quot;Titulus Callixti&quot;, later called the Basilica di Santa Maria in Trastevere, and the &quot;Titulus Cecilae&quot;, Santa Cecilia in Trastevere.

In order to have a stronghold on the right Bank and to control the Gianicolo hill, &quot;Transtiberim&quot; was partially included by Emperor Aurelian (270–275) inside the wall erected to defend the city against the Germanic tribes.

In the Middle Ages Trastevere had narrow, winding, irregular streets; moreover, because of the &quot;mignani&quot; (structures on the front of buildings) there was no space for carriages to pass. At the end of the 15th century these &quot;mignani&quot; were removed. Nevertheless, Trastevere remained a maze of narrow streets. There was a strong contrast between the large, opulent houses of the upper classes and the small, dilapidated houses of the poor. The streets had no pavement until the time of Sixtus IV at the end of the 15th century. At first bricks were used, but these were later replaced by sampietrini (cobble stones), which were more suitable for carriages. Thanks to its partial isolation (it was &quot;beyond the Tiber&quot;) and to the fact that its population had been multicultural since the ancient Roman period, the inhabitants of Trastevere, called &quot;Trasteverini&quot;, developed a culture of their own. In 1744 Benedict XIV modified the borders of the &quot;rioni&quot;, giving Trastevere its modern limits.

==Modern day==

Nowadays, Trastevere maintains its character thanks to its narrow cobbled streets lined by ancient houses. At night, natives and tourists alike flock to its many pubs and restaurants, but much of the original character of Trastevere remains. The area is also home to several foreign academic institutions including The American University of Rome and John Cabot University (both of which are private American universities), the American Academy in Rome, the Rome campus of the Thomas More College of Liberal Arts, the Canadian University of Waterloo School of Architecture (between the months of September and December), and the American Pratt Institute School of Architecture therefore serving as home to an international student body.

The neighborhood has attracted artists, foreign expats, and many famous people. In the sixties and seventies, the American musicians/composers Frederic Rzewski and Richard Teitelbaum, of the group Musica Elettronica Viva, lived in Via della Luce. Sergio Leone, the director of Spaghetti Westerns, grew up in Viale Glorioso (there is a marble plaque to his memory on the wall of the apartment building), and went to a Catholic private school in the neighborhood. Ennio Morricone, the film music composer, went to the same school, and for one year was in the same class as Sergio Leone.

==Geography==
The &quot;rione&quot; is on the west bank of the River Tiber, south of Vatican City, in the plain between the meander of the river and the Janiculum Hill. In addition to the river, which marks the eastern border of the borough, the area is delimited to the west and to the south by the Janiculum walls, and to the north by the Galleria Principe Amedeo di Savoia-Aosta tunnel.

===Boundaries===
To the north, Trastevere borders with Borgo (R. XIV), whose border is defined by a portion of the walls of Urban VIII, beside Rampa del Sangallo and Viale delle Mura Aurelie, by Piazza della Rovere and by Ponte Principe Amedeo.

To the east, the &quot;rione&quot; borders with Ponte (R. V), Regola (R. VII) and Ripa (R. XII): the border is marked by the stretch of the Tiber between Ponte Principe Amedeo and Ponte Sublicio.

To the south, Trastevere borders with &quot;Quartiere&quot; Portuense (Q. XI), from which is separated by a short stretch of the Aurelian Walls beside Piazza di Porta Portese; as well as with &quot;Quartiere&quot; Aurelio (Q. XIII), from which is separated by the stretch of the Walls between Porta Portese and Porta San Pancrazio.

Westward, it borders with &quot;Quartiere&quot; Gianicolense (Q. XII), whose boundary is marked by the Aurelian Walls, alongside Viale delle Mura Aurelie.

<text>Keļallur Nīlakaṇṭha Somayāji (14 June 1444 – 1544), also referred to as Keļallur Comatiri, was a mathematician and astronomer of the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics. One of his most influential works was the comprehensive astronomical treatise &quot;Tantrasamgraha&quot; completed in 1501. He had also composed an elaborate commentary on Aryabhatiya called the &quot;Aryabhatiya Bhasya&quot;. In this Bhasya, Nilakantha had discussed infinite series expansions of trigonometric functions and problems of algebra and spherical geometry. &quot;Grahapariksakrama&quot; is a manual on making observations in astronomy based on instruments of the time. 

==Early life==
Nilakantha was born into a Brahmin family which came from South Malabar in Kerala.

==Biographical details==

Nilakantha Somayaji was one of the very few authors of the scholarly traditions of India who had cared to record details about his own life and times.

In one of his works titled &quot;Siddhanta-star&quot; and also in his own commentary on &quot;Siddhanta-darpana&quot;, Nilakantha Somayaji stated that he was born on Kali-day 1,660,181 which works out to 14 June 1444 CE. A contemporary reference to Nilakantha Somayaji in a Malayalam work on astrology implies that Somayaji lived to a ripe old age even to become a centenarian. Sankara Variar, a pupil of Nilakantha Somayaji, in his commentary on Tantrasamgraha titled &quot;Tantrasamgraha-vyakhya&quot;, points out that the first and last verses of Tantrasamgraha contain chronograms specifying the Kali-days of the commencement (1,680,548) and of completion (1,680,553) of Somayaji&#x27;s magnum opus Tantrasamgraha. Both these days occur in 1500 CE.

In Aryabhatiya-bhashya, Nilakantha Somayaji has stated that he was the son of Jatavedas and he had a brother named Sankara. Somayaji has further stated that he was a Bhatta belonging to the Gargya gotra and was a follower of Asvalayana-sutra of Rigveda. References in his own &quot;Laghuramayana&quot; indicate that Nilakantha Somayaji was a member of the Kelallur family (Sanskritised as Kerala-sad-grama) residing at Kundagrama, now known as Trikkandiyur in modern Tirur, Kerala. His wife was named Arya and he had two sons Rama and Dakshinamurti.

Nilakantha Somayaji studied vedanta and some aspects of astronomy under one Ravi. However, it was Damodara, son of Kerala-drgganita author Paramesvara, who initiated him into the science of astronomy and instructed him in the basic principles of mathematical computations. The great Malayalam poet Thunchaththu Ramanujan Ezhuthachan is said to have been a student of Nilakantha Somayaji.

The epithet &quot;Somayaji&quot; is a title assigned to or assumed by a Namputiri who has performed the vedic ritual of &quot;Somayajna&quot;. So it could be surmised that Nilakantha Somayaji had also performed a &quot;Somayajna&quot; ritual and assumed the title of a &quot;Somayaji&quot; in later life. In colloquial Malayalam usage the word Somayaji has been corrupted to Comatiri.

Somayāji’s &quot;Āryabhaṭīyabhāṣya&quot; is the most extensive commentary on Āryabhaṭīya. He takes all pains to expose the rationale and the objective behind the statements and observations made by Āryabhaṭa.

==Nilakantha Somayaji as a polymath ==
Nilakantha&#x27;s writings substantiate his knowledge of several branches of Indian philosophy and culture. It is said that he could refer to a Mimamsa authority to establish his view-point in a debate and with equal felicity apply a grammatical dictum to the same purpose. 
In his writings he refers to a Mimamsa authority, quotes extensively from Pingala&#x27;s chandas-sutra, scriptures, Dharmasastras, Bhagavata and Vishnupurana also. Sundararaja, a contemporary Tamil astronomer, refers to Nilakantha as sad-darshani-parangata, one who had mastered the six systems of Indian philosophy.

==Astronomy==
In his &quot;Tantrasangraha&quot;, Nilakantha revised Aryabhata&#x27;s model for the planets Mercury and Venus. According to George G. Joseph his equation of the centre for these planets remained the most accurate until the time of Johannes Kepler in the 17th century.

In his &quot;Aryabhatiyabhasya&quot;, a commentary on Aryabhata&#x27;s &quot;Aryabhatiya&quot;, Nilakantha developed a computational system for a partially heliocentric planetary model in which Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn orbit the Sun, which in turn orbits the Earth, similar to the Tychonic system later proposed by Tycho Brahe in the late 16th century. Most astronomers of the Kerala school who followed him accepted this planetary model.
Somayaji time and again advocates the necessity of periodical modification of computation system based on observations and experimentations. One of his works, &quot;Jyotirmimamsa&quot;, is written exclusively for this purpose. His critical and analytical approach is reflected in all works.

==Works ==
The following is a brief description of the works by Nilakantha Somayaji dealing with astronomy and mathematics.
