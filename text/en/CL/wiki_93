<text>A flying wedge (also called flying V or wedge formation, or simply wedge) is a configuration created from a body moving forward in a triangular formation. This V-shaped arrangement began as a successful military strategy in ancient times when infantry units would move forward in wedge formations to smash through an enemy&#x27;s lines. This principle was later used by Medieval European armies, as well as modern armed forces, which have adapted the V-shaped wedge for armored assault.

In modern times the effectiveness of flying wedge means it is still employed by civilian police services for riot control. It has also been used in some sports, although the use of wedges is sometimes banned due to the danger it poses to defenders.

== Military tactics ==

=== Antiquity ===
==== Greeks and Romans ====

The wedge (ἔμβολον, &quot;embolon&quot; in Greek; &quot;cuneus&quot; in Latin, colloquially also &quot;caput porcinum&quot;, &quot;boar&#x27;s head&quot;), was used by both infantry and cavalry. The men deployed in a triangular or trapezoid formation with the tip leading the way. According to Arrian and Asclepiodotus, the wedge was first used by the Scythians, and then the Thracians. Philip II of Macedon adopted it from them as the main formation of his Companion cavalry and Alexander the Great faced Persian cavalry arrayed thus, as Arrian attests. The advantage of the wedge was that it offered a narrow point for piercing enemy formations and concentrated the leaders at the front. It was easier to turn than a square formation because everyone followed the leader at the apex, &quot;like a flight of cranes&quot;.

As an infantry formation it is attested by Frontinus to have been used by the Romans in Pydna against the Macedonian line of Perseus. It was also used to great effect by the Roman legions, with the wedge proving effective in campaigns in Britain, such as during Boudicca&#x27;s Revolt, where a greatly outnumbered Roman army used it to defeat the Iceni.

==== Scandinavian and Germanic ====

&quot;Keilerkopf&quot; or &quot;Keil&quot; (wild boar&#x27;s head, wedge, Latin: &quot;cuneus&quot;, meaning throng) is a German phrase to describe the attack formation (&quot;Tactical body&quot;) of the prehistoric infantry of the Celts and Germanic tribes. It is generally believed that the Germanic tribes were more successful with this tactic than the Celts. It was used to force the Roman forces to split and was later applied specifically to the weakest units.

Due to the high discipline this formation required and the relatively high probability of failure, it is assumed that the front lines were filled with the best and most heavily armoured warriors of the Germanic sibbs who had to break the Roman front line.

Here the individual warrior tried to gain fame and glory in the battle. The most distinguished princes and their acolytes stood at the head of the &quot;Keil&quot;. However, this was also the most dangerous point, whence the need to be heavily armoured. But an army leader who survived a lost battle often forfeited his life (usually suicide). Warriors who had fled were hanged or slain.

According to the Roman historian Tacitus, the &quot;Keil&quot; was a tightly packed crowd, strong on all sides, not only in front and back, but also on the flanks. The formation was not like a wedge but more like a rectangle with forty warriors in the first line and 1,600 men strong. In this formation, the wingmen are at most risk. It was therefore well possible that the wing marched with some caution and held back a bit, so that the center stormed further and looked like a wedge. The outer ranks of the rear on the other hand swelled slightly. The goal was to hit hard at the same time and to drive a 40 yard wide hole into the enemy line, according to the German historian Hans Delbrück.

According to Richard Burton, the central body consisted of heavily armed, warriors protecting less-armored archers to the sides. The triangular formation was used to overwhelm an enemy with a frontal assault. Family groups and tribes were placed side-by-side in units to maintain its cohesion in battle. The tactic was a formidable assault strategy against defenders in line or column, however, attackers faced annihilation in the event of retreat because the wedge became an ill-defined mob if its forward momentum collapsed.

When the Germanic &quot;Keil&quot; was advancing against the enemy, they sang the &quot;baritus&quot; or &quot;barditus&quot;, the battle song (battle cry); it begins with a muffled grumbling and swells with the heat of the battle up to the roar of the waves beating against the rocks. According to Germanic legend and Tacitus, Hercules once visited German soil and they sang of him first of all heroes.

=== The Middle Ages ===
In the Middle Ages, the tactic was especially effective against defensive shield wall formations when defenders would link their shields together to form an all-but impenetrable barrier. Armored, heavily armed infantry could use their momentum in wedge formation to drive open small sections in the shield wall. This would break up the shield wall exposing the defenders to flank attacks.

==== Western Europe ====
Two complete descriptions of an infantry wedge are given by Saxo Grammaticus in his &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;. In Book I, he describes a shallow wedge, with the front rank of two men then each thereafter doubled. In Book VII, he depicts a sharper pointed formation 10 men deep with the first rank being composed of 2 men, each rank composed of 2 more. Thus, each wedge was composed of 110 men, 10 deep, 2 men on its tip, and 20 on its base. According to the Vikings, the wedge formation, called by them svinfylking, cf. the Latin &quot;caput porcinum&quot;, was invented by Odin himself.

A triangular or wedge formation was also used in the medieval period by the Flemish and Swiss infantry.

Deep wedges of cavalry were used by German armies in the later Middle Ages. At the Battle of Pillenreuth in 1450, both the armies of Albrecht Achilles and Nuremberg fought in wedge formation. The Nuremberg cavalry was drawn up in a wedge led by 5 picked knights, then seven, then nine, then 11. The following twenty ranks held 250 ordinary men-at-arms, then a final rank of 14 picked men to hold the formation together. Sir Charles Oman refers to an unpublished manual of 1480 by Philip of Seldeneck which describes the formation, calling it the &quot;Spitz&quot;. He gives examples of various formations varying from 200 men to 1000. The formation of 1000 men places seven men in the first rank, with each rank increasing by two men back to the eighth rank with 21. The remaining men are in a column 20 men wide behind the point. The banner would be carried in the seventh rank.

The use of the cavalry wedge in 13th Century Castile is described in the Siete Partidas, a law code compiled for king Alfonso X of Castile

==== Byzantium ====
Byzantine Emperor Nikephoros Phocas analyzes the wedge formation of the Byzantine Cataphracts in the third chapter of his &quot;Praecepta Militaria&quot;. There, he relates that the wedge must be formed by 354 cataphracts and 150 horse archers to a total number of 504 men. The row of the first line comprised 20 horsemen, the second 24, the third 28, down to the 12th line, which consisted of 64 men. If such a number of men is not available, he proposes that the wedge be formed by 304 cataphracts and 80 horse archers, or a total of 384 men, the first line comprising 10 men. In his next chapter (&quot;Ordinance on Cavalry Deployment&quot;), he ordains that the wedge must be accompanied by two cavalry units, which will guard its flanks. A wedge whose ranks are not complete in the middle is shaped as an Λ instead of a Δ and is called a hollow wedge, or in Greek κοιλέμβολον,
&quot;koilembolon&quot;.

=== Modern warfare ===

The wedge is still used in modern armies, especially by tanks and other armored units. An example of this is the &quot;Panzerkeil&quot; or &quot;armored wedge&quot; used by the German Wehrmacht in World War II.

The hollow wedge formation remains one of the basic infantry formations at the squad and section level, especially when crossing open ground. However unlike in ancient and medieval times, the formation is used not to maximise effectiveness in melee combat, but to maximise the situational awareness and firepower of a unit. The intervals between soldiers is designed to give mutually supporting lines of sight that do not obscure one another forward and to the sides, and this also corresponds to mutually supporting overlapping arcs of fire. The squad automatic weapon will usually anchor one of the flanks of a fireteam wedge. In a platoon wedge the command group and platoon machine guns are placed in the hollow of the wedge.

Exactly the same principles of mutually supporting lines of sight and fire, apply to an armored vehicles deployed in a wedge formation.

There are many advantages to using this formation. It provides more overwatch as a result of the area it spans. Bounding overwatch can also be transitioned fast and efficiently. The regiment can change formation with ease and the front of it has a significant amount of strength from its crossfire.
==== Drill formation ====
The wedge formation is used ceremonially by cadets at the United States Air Force Academy during the annual graduation parade, when the soon-to-be commissioned first-class cadets (seniors) leave the Cadet Wing. This is the reverse of the acceptance parade, held each fall, when the new fourth-class cadets (freshmen) join the Cadet Wing in the inverted wedge formation.

== Civilian applications ==

=== Policing ===

Police and law enforcement riot squads sometimes charge in flying wedge formations, to break into a dense crowd as a snatch squad to arrest a leader or speaker, or to chop a long demonstration march into segments. It can also be used to escort VIPs through hostile crowds.

=== Sports ===

Although originally permitted in most full contact team sports, the use of the flying wedge is now banned for safety reasons in rugby union, rugby league, and American football. The principle is similar to the military application: the ball carrier starts an attack and is joined on both sides by teammates who drive them forward, toward the goal line. However, due to the number of deaths and serious injuries related to the flying wedge, any attempt at this formation is now punished by in-game penalties.

In American football, the formation was developed by Lorin F. Deland and first introduced by Harvard in a collegiate game against Yale in 1892. Teammates would lock themselves together with the ball carrier using their hands and arms and rush forward. But despite its practicality, it was outlawed two seasons later in 1894 because of its contribution to serious injury. 

The penalty against &quot;assisting the runner&quot;, which forbids the locking together of players as well as pushing and pulling the ball carrier to increase force in the same manner as the historic flying wedge, remains in the American football rule books; its eradication has been so complete that the foul has not been called in the National Football League since 1991. The concept of wedge-shaped formations continued to influence several football plays in the modern game, particularly on kickoff returns, until 2009 when NFL league owners agreed to stop its use. 

Recent changes in the rules at various levels regarding runbacks of free kicks are stricter still in that they restrict blocking by teammates close together even without touching each other. The &quot;wedge&quot; commonly referred to in interference on free kick returns simply meant such a close group of blockers. Wedge blocking using only the shoulders to push forward teammates not holding the ball is still legal. Some leagues went still farther in theoretically not allowing any transfer of momentum between teammates in blocking but that prohibition is commonly flouted. Consequently, some NFL teams today, when facing a short-yardage situation, will &quot;push&quot; a quarterback for a first down or a touchdown. In Philadelphia, this practice is (jokingly) referred to as &quot;The Brotherly Shove.&quot;

<text>2C-T-4 (2,5-dimethoxy-4-isopropylthiophenethylamine) is a psychedelic phenethylamine of the 2C family. It was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin and is used as entheogenic recreational drug.

==Chemistry==

2C-T-4 is the 2-carbon homolog of aleph-4. The full chemical name is 2-[4-(isopropylthio)-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl]-ethanamine. The drug has structural and pharmacodynamic properties similar to 2C-T-7 and 2C-T-19.

==Effects==
2C-T-4 produces psychedelic and entheogenic effects that develop slowly and can last 8–16 hours. While users may experience virtually no effects for the first hour after ingestion, results vary drastically between individuals and range from hallucination and euphoria to intense sickness and anxiety. Shulgin devoted a chapter in the first part of his book &quot;PiHKAL&quot; to this compound, describing an intense &quot;plus-four&quot; psychedelic experience mediated by a twelve milligram dose.

==Pharmacology==

The mechanism that produces 2C-T-4&#x27;s hallucinogenic and entheogenic effects has not been specifically established, however it is most likely to result from action as a 5-HT2A serotonin receptor agonist in the brain, a mechanism of action shared by all of the hallucinogenic tryptamines and phenethylamines for which the mechanism of action is known.

==Popularity==

2C-T-4 is relatively unknown on the black market, but has been sold to a limited extent on the research chemical market.

==Drug prohibition laws==

===Canada===
As of October 31, 2016, 2C-T-4 is a controlled substance (Schedule III) in Canada.

===China===
As of October 2015 2C-T-4 is a controlled substance in China.

===Denmark===
2C-T-4 is added to the list of Schedule B controlled substances.

===Sweden===
&quot;Sveriges riksdags&quot; health ministry &quot;Statens folkhälsoinstitut&quot; classified 2C-T-4 as &quot;health hazard&quot; under the act &quot;Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor&quot; (translated &quot;Act on the Prohibition of Certain Goods Dangerous to Health&quot;) as of Jul 15, 2007, in their regulation SFS 2007:600 listed as 2,5-dimetoxi-4-isopropyltiofenetylamin (2C-T-4), making it illegal to sell or possess.

===United States===
As of July 9, 2012, 2C-T-4 is a Schedule I substance in the United States, under the Synthetic Drug Abuse Prevention Act of 2012.

==Homologue==

2C-T-4 has one homologue, the structural isomer Ψ-2C-T-4 (2,6-dimethoxy-4-(i)-propylthiophenethylamine). This compound was tested by Alexander Shulgin at a dose of 12 mg.

At this dosage its duration was very short and it produced few effects, however based on the research into the better characterized compound Ψ-DOM, the potency of Ψ-2C-T-4 is likely to be around 1/3 that of 2C-T-4 itself, so a more effective dosage of Ψ-2C-T-4 might be in the region of 20–60 mg; however high doses such as this might well be associated with toxic side effects, and so extreme caution would be advised.

<text>Jacques Barrot (; 3 February 1937 – 3 December 2014) was a French politician, who served as European Commissioner for Justice from 2008 to 2010, after having spent four years serving as Commissioner for Transport from 2004 to 2008 and Commissioner for Regional Policy for eight months in 2004. He was also one of five vice-presidents of the 27-member Barroso Commission. He previously held various ministerial positions in France, and was a member of the right-wing political party UMP. He was officially approved in his post by the European Parliament on 18 June 2008 with a vote of 489 to 52 with 19 abstentions.

== Biography ==
Barrot was a European Commissioner between April 2004 and, serving as Commissioner for Regional Policy in the Prodi Commission before being selected as a Vice-President and Commissioner for Transport in the Barroso Commission.

He was convicted in a French court of embezzlement in 2000. The case involved the diverting of £2 million of government money to his party. He received an eight-month suspended prison sentence. His conviction was automatically erased by a 1995 presidential amnesty.

Barrot was approved by the European Parliament in 2004 for Commissioner of Transport and made a Vice-President in the new Barroso Commission. However shortly after he began work, his previous conviction was revealed by Nigel Farage, MEP for Independence and Democracy. French President Jacques Chirac had granted him presidential amnesty, a fact the Commissioner did not disclose during his hearing to the Parliament. Despite calls from some MEPs for him to be suspended he remained in office after a large majority accepted legal opinion that Barrot was not legally required to disclose the amnesty.

A major project during his term was the Galileo positioning system. Work on the system began a year before Barrot came to office and has developed since with the launch of the first satellite. However infighting within private sector partners may have been a potential setback to the project with Barrot favouring greater funds from the EU budget. Other work includes recent guarantees of air passenger rights and the Single European Sky.

Barrot died on 3 December 2014 in Neuilly-sur-Seine at the age of 77.

<doc id="1187864" wikidata="Q263899" url="?curid=1187864" title="Elugelab">
<text>Elugelab, or Elugelap (, ), was an island, part of the Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands. It was destroyed in the world&#x27;s first full-scale thermonuclear explosion, the &quot;Mike&quot; shot of Operation Ivy, on November 1, 1952. Prior to being destroyed, the island was described as &quot;just another small naked island of the atoll&quot;.

==Environment==
The land had palm trees and the surrounding marine had &quot;Heliopora&quot; coral growth which was home to &quot;Eurythoe complanata&quot; and &quot;Haplosyllis spongicola&quot;, most of which are now dead or dying.

==Explosion==
The fireball created by Ivy Mike had a maximum diameter of . This maximum is reached a number of seconds after the detonation and during this time the hot fireball invariably rises due to buoyancy. While still relatively close to the ground, the fireball had yet to reach its maximum dimensions and was thus approximately wide.

The detonation produced a crater in diameter and deep where Elugelab had once been; the blast and water waves from the explosion (some waves up to high) stripped the test islands clean of vegetation, as observed by a helicopter survey within 60 minutes after the test, by which time the mushroom cloud had blown away. The island &quot;became dust and ash, pulled upward to form a mushroom cloud that rose about into the sky.&quot; The outcome of the test was reported to incoming president Eisenhower by Atomic Energy Commission Chairman, Gordon Dean, as follows: “The island of Elugelab is missing!”.

According to Eric Schlosser, all that remained of Elugelab was a circular crater filled with seawater, more than in diameter and &quot;fifteen stories deep&quot;. The blast yielded 10.4 megatons of explosive energy, 700 times the energy that leveled central Hiroshima. Aerial footage of Elugelab and adjacent islands well before &quot;Mike&quot; shot at a time prior to the connecting causeway being created is available, as is footage after the causeway was finished that supported the diagnostic Krause-Ogle box light pipe system, with numerous trees removed in preparation of the shot also plainly evident, along with footage of the aforementioned helicopter survey of the Mike crater soon after the detonation, and finally, high-altitude footage of the crater accompanied with details of its depth&quot; deep&quot;equivalent to the height of a &quot;17-story building&quot; and with an area large enough to accommodate about &quot;14 Pentagon buildings&quot;.

The detonation also collapsed some natural crevices in the reef, some distance away from the rim of the crater. Full radioecology recovery surveys were documented before and after each test series.

=== Impact on the nuclear arms race ===
This test marked a pivotal moment in escalating the nuclear weapons development arms race. The Soviet Union conducted its own thermonuclear test three years later. It was believed that Soviet scientists were able to sustain the development of the hydrogen bomb partly because they received U.S. research details from atomic spy Klaus Fuchs. However, the &quot;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&quot; indicated in the 1990s that most of the information Fuchs provided may have been useless.

<doc id="1187874" wikidata="Q827198" url="?curid=1187874" title="Speech balloon">
<text>Speech balloons (also speech bubbles, dialogue balloons, or word balloons) are a graphic convention used most commonly in comic books, comics, and cartoons to allow words (and much less often, pictures) to be understood as representing a character&#x27;s speech or thoughts. A formal distinction is often made between the balloon that indicates speech and the one that indicates thoughts; the balloon that conveys thoughts is often referred to as a thought bubble or conversation cloud.

==History==
One of the earliest antecedents to the modern speech bubble were the &quot;speech scrolls&quot;, wispy lines that connected first-person speech to the mouths of the speakers in Mesoamerican art between 600 and 900 AD.
Earlier, paintings, depicting stories in subsequent frames, using descriptive text resembling bubbles-text, were used in murals, one such example written in Greek, dating to the 2nd century, found in Capitolias, today in Jordan.

In Western graphic art, labels that reveal what a pictured figure is saying have appeared since at least the 13th century. These were in common European use by the early 16th century. Word balloons (also known as &quot;banderoles&quot;) began appearing in 18th-century printed broadsides, and political cartoons from the American Revolution (including some published by Benjamin Franklin) often used themas did cartoonist James Gillray in Britain. They later became disused, but by 1904 had regained their popularity, although they were still considered novel enough to require explanation. With the development of the comics industry during the 20th century, the appearance of speech balloons has become increasingly standardized, though the formal conventions that have evolved in different cultures (USA as opposed to Japan, for example) can be quite distinct.

In the UK in 1825 &quot;The Glasgow Looking Glass,&quot; regarded as the world&#x27;s first comics magazine, was created by English satirical cartoonist William Heath. Containing the world&#x27;s first comic strip, it also made it the first to use speech bubbles.

Richard F. Outcault&#x27;s Yellow Kid is generally credited as the first American comic strip character. His words initially appeared on his yellow shirt, but word balloons very much like those used presently were added almost immediately, as early as 1896. By the start of the 20th century, word balloons were ubiquitous; since that time, few American comic strips and comic books have relied on captions, notably Hal Foster&#x27;s &quot;Prince Valiant&quot; and the early &quot;Tarzan&quot; comic strip during the 1930s. In Europe, where text comics were more common, the adoption of speech balloons was slower, with well-known examples being Alain Saint-Ogan&#x27;s &quot;Zig et Puce&quot; (1925), Hergé&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; (1929), and Rob-Vel&#x27;s &quot;Spirou&quot; (1938).

Speech balloons are not necessarily popular or well-known in all parts of the world. During the Gulf War, an American propaganda leaflet that used a thought bubble proved puzzling to Iraqi soldiers: according to one PSYOP specialist this was because the technique was not known in Iraq, and readers &quot;had no idea why Saddam&#x27;s head was floating in the air.&quot;

==Popular forms==
===Speech bubbles===
The most common is the speech bubble. It is used in two forms for two circumstances: an in-panel character and an off-panel character. An in-panel character (one who is fully or mostly visible in the panel of the strip of comic that the reader is viewing) uses a bubble with a pointer, termed a tail, directed towards the speaker.

When one character has multiple balloons within a panel, often only the balloon nearest to the speaker&#x27;s head has a tail, and the others are connected to it in sequence by narrow bands. This style is often used in &quot;Mad Magazine&quot;, due to its &quot;call-and-response&quot; dialogue-based humor.

An off-panel character (the comic book equivalent of being &quot;off screen&quot;) has several options, some of them rather unconventional. The first is a standard speech bubble with a tail pointing toward the speaker&#x27;s position (sometimes seen with a symbol at the end to represent specific characters). The second option, which originated in manga, has the tail pointing &quot;into&quot; the bubble, instead of out. (This tail is still pointing towards the speaker.) The third option replaces the tail with a sort of bottleneck that connects with the side of the panel. It can be seen in the works of Marjane Satrapi (author of &quot;Persepolis&quot;).

In comics, a bubble without a tail means that the speaker is not merely outside the reader&#x27;s field of view, but also invisible to the viewpoint character, often as an unspecified member of a crowd.

Characters distant (in space or time) from the scene of the panel can still speak, in squared bubbles without a tail; this usage, equivalent to voice-over for movies, is not uncommon in American comics for dramatic contrast. In contrast to captions, the corners of such balloons never coincide with those of the panel; for further distinction, they often have a double outline, a different background color, or quotation marks.

===Thought bubbles===
Thought bubbles are used in two forms, the chain thought bubble and the &quot;fuzzy&quot; bubble.

The chain thought bubble is the almost universal symbol for thinking in cartoons. It consists of a large, cloud-like bubble containing the text of the thought, with a chain of increasingly smaller circular bubbles leading to the character. Some artists use an elliptical bubble instead of a cloud-shaped one.

Often, non-human characters such as Snoopy and Garfield &quot;talk&quot; using thought bubbles. They may also be used in circumstances when a character is gagged or otherwise unable to speak.

Another, less conventional thought bubble has emerged: the &quot;fuzzy&quot; thought bubble. Used in manga (by such artists as Ken Akamatsu), the fuzzy bubble is roughly circular in shape (generally), but the edge of the bubble is not a line but a collection of spikes close to each other, creating the impression of fuzziness. Fuzzy thought bubbles do not use tails, and are placed near the character who is thinking. 

Thought bubbles are sometimes seen as an inefficient method of expressing thought because they are attached directly to the head of the thinker, unlike methods such as caption boxes, which can be used both as an expression of thought and narration while existing in an entirely different panel from the character thinking. However, they are restricted to the current viewpoint character. An example is Alan Moore and David Lloyd&#x27;s &quot;V for Vendetta&quot;, wherein during one chapter, a monologue expressed in captions serves not only to express the thoughts of a character but also the mood, status and actions of three others.

===Other forms===
The shape of a speech balloon can be used to convey further information. Common ones include the following:
*&quot;Scream bubbles&quot; indicate a character is screaming or shouting, usually with a jagged outline or a thicker line which can be colored. Their lettering is usually larger or bolder than normal.
*&quot;Broadcast bubbles&quot; (also known as &quot;radio bubbles&quot;) may have a jagged tail like the conventional drawing of a lightning flash and either a squared-off or jagged outline. Letters are sometimes italicised without also being bold. Broadcast bubbles indicate that the speaker is communicating through an electronic device, such as a telephone, radio or television, or is robotic.
*&quot;Whisper bubbles&quot; are usually drawn with a dashed (dotted) outline, smaller font or gray lettering to indicate the tone is softer, as most speech is printed in black. Another form, sometimes encountered in manga, looks like an occidental thought bubble.
*&quot;Icicle bubbles&quot; have jagged &quot;icicles&quot; on the lower edge, representing &quot;cold&quot; hostility. 
*&quot;Monster bubbles&quot; have blood or slime dripping from them.
*&quot;Colored bubbles&quot; can be used to convey the emotion that goes with the speech, such as red for anger or green for envy. This style is seldom used in modern comics. Alternatively (especially in online-published comics), colours can be used to provide an additional cue about who is speaking. Main characters often have individual thematic colours, and their speech bubbles are frequently tinted with their colour; especially in situations when there are not any characters visible for speech bubbles to point toward.

==Captions==
Captions are generally used for narration purposes, such as showing location and time, or conveying editorial commentary. They are generally rectangular and positioned near the edge of the panel. Often they are also colored to indicate the difference between themselves and the word balloons used by the characters, which are almost always white. Increasingly in modern comics, captions are frequently used to convey an internal monologue or typical speech.

==Artist-specific variations==
Some characters and strips use unconventional methods of communication. Perhaps the most notable is the Yellow Kid, an early American comic strip character. His (but not the other characters&#x27;) words would appear on his large, smock-like shirt. &quot;Shirt Tales&quot;, a short-run American animated TV series of the early 1980s used this same concept, but with changing phrases on the &quot;T-shirts&quot; worn by the animal-based characters, depending on the characters&#x27; thoughts. 

Also noteworthy are the many variations of the form created by Dave Sim for his comic &quot;Cerebus the Aardvark&quot;. Depending on the shape, size, and position of the bubble, as well as the texture and shape of the letters within it, Sim could convey large amounts of information about the speaker. This included separate bubbles for different states of mind (drunkenness, etc.), for echoes, and a special class of bubbles for one single floating apparition.

An early pioneer in experimenting with many different types of speech balloons and lettering for different types of speech was Walt Kelly, for his &quot;Pogo&quot; strip. Deacon Mushrat speaks with blackletter words, P.T. Bridgeport speaks in circus posters, Sarcophagus MacAbre speaks in condolence cards, &quot;Mr. Pig&quot; (a take on Nikita Khrushchev) speaks in faux Cyrillic, etc.

In the famous French comic series &quot;Asterix&quot;, Goscinny and Uderzo use bubbles without tails to indicate a distant or unseen speaker. They have also experimented with using different types of lettering for characters of different nationalities to indicate that they speak a different language which Asterix may not understand; Goths speak in blackletter, Greeks in angular lettering (though always understood by the Gaulish main characters, so it is more of an accent than a language), Norse with &quot;Nørdic åccents&quot;, Egyptians in faux hieroglyphs (depictive illustrations and rebuses), etc. Another experiment with speech bubbles was exclusive to one book, &quot;Asterix and the Roman Agent&quot;. The agent in question is a vile manipulator who creates discord in a group of people with a single innocent-sounding comment. His victims start quarreling and ultimately fighting each other while speaking in green-colored speech bubbles.

Font variation is a common tactic in comics. &quot;The Sandman&quot; series, written by Neil Gaiman and lettered by Todd Klein, features many characters whose speech bubbles are written with a font that is exclusive to them. For examples, the main character, the gloomy Dream, speaks in wavy-edged bubbles, completely black, with similarly wavy white lettering. His sister, the scatterbrained and whimsical Delirium speaks in bubbles in a many-colored explosive background with uneven lettering, and the irreverent raven Matthew speaks in a shaky angular kind of bubble with scratchy lettering. Other characters, such as John Dee, have special shapes of bubbles for their own.

For &quot;Mad&quot; magazine&#x27;s recurring comic strip &quot;Monroe&quot;, certain words are written larger or in unusual fonts for emphasis.

In manga, there is a tendency to include the speech necessary for the storyline in balloons, while small scribbles outside the balloons add side comments, often used for irony or to show that they are said in a much smaller voice. Satsuki Yotsuba in the manga series &quot;Negima&quot; is notable because she speaks almost &quot;entirely&quot; in side scribble.

==Graphic symbols==

Speech bubbles are used not only to include a character&#x27;s words, but also emotions, voice inflections and unspecified language.

===Punctuation marks===
One of the universal emblems of the art of comics is the use of a single punctuation mark to depict a character&#x27;s emotions, much more efficiently than any possible sentence. A speech bubble with a single big question mark (?) (often drawn by hand, not counted as part of the lettering) denotes confusion or ignorance. An exclamation mark (!) indicates surprise or terror. This device is used much in the European comic tradition, the Belgian artist Hergé&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; series being a good example. Sometimes, the punctuation marks stand alone above the character&#x27;s head, with no bubble needed.

In manga, the ellipsis (i.e. three dots) is also used to express silence in a much more significant way than the mere absence of bubbles. This is especially seen when a character is supposed to say something, to indicate a stunned silence, or when a sarcastic comment is expected by the reader. The ellipsis, along with the big drop of sweat on the character&#x27;s temple – usually depicting shame, confusion, or embarrassment caused by other people&#x27;s actions – is one of the Japanese graphic symbols that have become used by other comics around the world, although they are still rare in Western tradition. Japanese even has a sound effect for &quot;deafening silence&quot;, .

===Foreign languages===
In many comic books, words that would be foreign to the narration but are displayed in translation for the reader are surrounded by brackets or chevrons .

Gilbert Hernandez&#x27;s series about Palomar is written in English, but supposed to take place mainly in a Hispanic country. Thus, what is supposed to be representations of Spanish speech is written without brackets, but occasional actual English speech is written within brackets, to indicate that it is unintelligible to the main Hispanophone characters in the series.

Some comics will have the actual foreign language in the speech balloon, with the translation as a footnote; this is done with Latin aphorisms in &quot;Asterix&quot;. In the webcomic &quot;Stand Still, Stay Silent&quot;, in which characters may speak up to five different languages in the same scene, most dialogue is unmarked (languages mostly being inferred by who is speaking and to whom), but miniature flags indicate the language being spoken where this is relevant.

Another convention is to put the foreign speech in a distinctive lettering style; for example, &quot;Asterix&quot;&#x27;s Goths speak in blackletter.

Since the Japanese language uses two writing directionalities (vertical, which is the traditional direction; and horizontal, as most other languages), manga has a convention of representing translated foreign speech as horizontal text.

===The big Z===

It is a convention for American comics that the sound of a snore is represented as a series of Z&#x27;s, dating back at least to Rudolph Dirks&#x27; early 20th-century strip &quot;The Katzenjammer Kids&quot;. This practice has even been reduced to a single letter Z, so that a speech bubble with this letter standing all alone means the character is sleeping in most humorous comics. This can be seen, for instance, in Charles Schulz&#x27;s &quot;Peanuts&quot; comic strips.

The resemblance between the &#x27;z&#x27; sound and that of a snore is a frequent feature in other countries. However, in Japanese manga the common symbol for sleep is a large bubble of snot coming out of a character&#x27;s nose.

===Drawings within the speech bubble===
Singing characters usually have musical notes drawn into their word balloons. Archie Comics&#x27; Melody Valentine, a character in their &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; comic, has musical notes drawn into her word balloons at all times, to convey that she speaks in a sing-song voice.

The above-mentioned Albert Uderzo in the &quot;Asterix&quot; series decorates speech bubbles with beautiful flowers depicting an extremely soft, sweet voice (usually preceding a violent outburst by the same character).

A stormy cloud with a rough lightning shape sticking out of it, either in a bubble or just floating above the character&#x27;s head as a modified &#x27;cloudy&#x27; thought bubble, depicts anger, not always verbally expressed.

Light bulbs are sometimes used when the character thinks of an idea or solution to a problem.
In the Western world, it is common to replace profanity with a string of nonsense symbols (&amp;%$@*$#), sometimes termed grawlixes. In comics that are usually addressed to children or teenagers, bad language is censored by replacing it with more or less elaborate drawings and expressionistic symbols. For example, instead of calling someone a swine, a pig is drawn in the speech bubble.

One example is the Spanish series, created by Francisco Ibáñez. Although not specifically addressed to children, was initiated during Francisco Franco&#x27;s dictatorship, when censorship was common and rough language was prohibited. When Ibáñez&#x27;s characters are angry, donkey heads, lightning, lavatories, billy goats and even faux Japanese characters are often seen in their bubbles.

When was portrayed in a movie by Spanish director Javier Fesser in 2003, one of the critiques made to his otherwise successful adaptation was the character&#x27;s use of words that never appeared in the comics. Fesser claimed: &quot;When you see a bubble speech containing a lightning falling on a pig, what do you imagine the character&#x27;s saying?&quot;

==Order==
In order for comic strip and graphic novel dialogue to make sense, it has to be read in order. Thus, conventions have evolved in the order in which the communication bubbles are read. The individual bubbles are read in the order of the language. For example, in English, the bubbles are read from left to right in a panel, while in Japanese, it is the other way around. Sometimes the bubbles are &quot;stacked&quot;, with two characters having multiple bubbles, one above the other. Such stacks are read from the top down.

==Lettering==
Traditionally, a cartoonist or occupational letterer would draw in all the individual letters in the balloons and sound effects by hand. A modern alternative, used by most comics presently and universal in English-translated manga, is to letter with computer programs. The fonts used usually emulate the style of hand-lettering.

Traditionally, most mainstream comic books are lettered entirely in upper-case, with a few exceptions:
* Name particles such as &quot;de&quot; and &quot;von&quot;, and the &quot;c&quot; in a surname of Scottish or Irish origin starting with &quot;Mc&quot;.
* To indicate a frightened or quiet manner of speech.
* An interjection such as &quot;er&quot;, &quot;um&quot;, etc.

When hand-lettering, upper-case lettering saves time and effort because it requires drawing only three guidelines, while mixed-case lettering requires five.

For a few comics, uppercase and lowercase are used as in ordinary writing. Since the mid-1980s, mixed case lettering has gradually become more widely used in mainstream comic books. Some comics, such as &quot;Pearls Before Swine&quot;, also use lowercase speech to mark a distinctive accent (in this case, the male crocodiles&#x27; accented speech, opposed to all other characters who use standard uppercase speech).

From 2002 to 2004, Marvel Comics experimented with mixed-case lettering for all its comic books. Most mainstream titles have since returned to traditional all upper-case lettering.

For many comics, although the lettering is entirely in capital letters, serif versions of &quot;I&quot; are used exclusively where a capital I would appear in normal print text, and a sans-serif (i.e., a simple vertical line) is used in all other places. This reduces confusion with the number one, and also serves to indicate when the personal pronoun &quot;I&quot; is meant. This lettering convention can be seen in computer fonts designed for comic book lettering, which use OpenType contextual alternates to replace the single-stroke &quot;I&quot; with a serifed one in appropriate contexts.

In some comics, characters who are upside down when speaking also have the lettering in their speech bubbles turned upside down. As this only hinders the reading of the comic, this seems to be used only for humorous effect.

==Substance of balloons==
In several occasions, comics artists have used balloons (or similar narrative devices) as if they have true substance, usually for humorous meta-like purposes. In &quot;Peanuts&quot;, for example, the notes played by Schroeder occasionally take substance and are used in various ways, including Christmas decorations or perches for birds. Sometimes balloons can be influenced by the strip&#x27;s environment: in the Italian strip &quot;Sturmtruppen&quot; they freeze and crack when the temperature is very low, or an Archie comic strip where two men from Alaska remarked on how cold it was, by saying the speech balloons froze as they said them, and the words had to be thawed out to be heard.

In the Flemish series &quot;Suske en Wiske&quot;, on one occasion a thought bubble full of mathematical formulas is cut open with scissors and its contents emptied in a bag, to be saved for later (in a manner not unlike the pensieve in the Harry Potter series). In the same series, speech balloons are occasionally even held and blown up to function as actual balloons or the words of the speech bubble are occasionally shown coming out the side of the speech bubble, to signify that the speaker is moving so fast that their words cannot keep up with them, i.e. at supersonic speed.

In the novel &quot;Who Censored Roger Rabbit?&quot;, the last words of a murdered Toon (cartoon character) are found under his body in the form of a speech balloon.

==Computer-generated speech balloons==
Many digital artists generate speech balloons with general-purpose illustration software. Products like Comic Book Creator for Microsoft Windows, Comic Life for Mac OS X and Windows were developed for the non-professional part of the market.

==Encoding==

Unicode character was added with Unicode 6.0 in 2010. It can also be produced with &quot;:speech_ballooon:&quot; on Slack and GitHub. (&quot;:left_speech_bubble:&quot;) was added with Unicode 7.0 in 2014.
👁️‍🗨️ EYE IN SPEECH BUBBLE is a ZWJ sequence added to Emoji 2.0 in 2015.

<text>Josiah Crudup (January 13, 1791 – May 20, 1872) was a U.S. Congressman from North Carolina between 1821 and 1823.

Crudup was born in Wakelon, North Carolina in Wake County, the son of Elizabeth (Battle) and Josiah Crudup, a Baptist minister. Crudup attended a private school in Louisburg, North Carolina, and then Columbian College (now George Washington University) in Washington, DC. He studied theology and was ordained as a Baptist minister, which was his profession his entire life.

Also a farmer and slave owner, Crudup was elected to the North Carolina Senate from Wake County in 1820, but was forced to vacate his office because the state constitution at the time forbade &quot;a minister of the Gospel, while exercising his ministerial functions, to hold a public office.&quot; In the 1850 US Federal Census Slave Schedule, Crudup is listed as enslaving 52 men, women and children; by 1860, according to the US Federal Census Slave Schedule, that number had increased to 64.

In 1821, he was elected to the 17th United States Congress and served for one term, from March 4, 1821 to March 3, 1823. Although he ran for re-election in 1822, he was narrowly defeated by Willie P. Mangum and returned to farming and the ministry. Crudup was a delegate from Granville County to the 1835 North Carolina Constitutional Convention, and died in Kittrell, North Carolina in 1872; he is buried in his family cemetery near Kittrell. Among his descendants is actor Billy Crudup.

<doc id="1187884" wikidata="Q6858115" url="?curid=1187884" title="Milkor 37/38mm and 40mm Stopper">
<text>The Milkor 37/38mm Less Lethal &quot;Stopper&quot; Single-shot was designed and distributed in 1981 by Milkor (Pty) Ltd as a less-lethal anti-riot weapon along with the Milkor 40mm Single shot Grenade Launcher which was designed as a reduced-cost grenade launcher for the SWAPOL Forces. In 2008, Milkor (Pty) Ltd released a new design designated the Milkor 37/38mm or 40mm Stopper Convertible, which is a single shot break-open weapon designed to utilize a variety of 37/38mm or 40mm Less Lethal rounds. As with the original Milkor MGL, the Stopper was originally marketed for Milkor by Armscor (South Africa).

==Context==
The standard riot gun of the South African Police Service was the 37mm Federal Riot Gun. Owing to the arms embargo imposed upon the apartheid regime, it was difficult to obtain spare parts from the USA. Due to an international arms embargo against South Africa, South Africans designed and manufactured some weapons as a small firearms industry developed locally. A South African farmer, Andries Piek, the &#x27;accidental designer&#x27; involved with the Milkor BXP was involved with the design of this weapon. This was to be the first in a product line of grenade launchers from Milkor (Pty) Ltd.

==Design==
The Milkor Stopper is a riot gun used for riot control, designed to fire a 37/38mm or 40mm cartridge, which can be a 9mm Buckshot, Rubber ball buckshot, teargas canister, rubber shot cartridge or explosive. The weapon is simple to operate and all metal surfaces are treated with a coating for corrosion protection, plus long-life dry film lubrication. It fires one shot before reloading. It is a conventional single shot, break-open weapon (opening at the breech like an ordinary shotguns (not pump-action)) with a floating firing pin mechanism that ensures safety when accidentally dropped. As a security or assault weapon, it can be fired from the shoulder or like a pistol by hand. The components of the weapon are interchangeable (client dependent), providing a range of applications from Less Lethal 37/38mm to a 40mm Lethal weapon.

===Variants===
* (1981) The Milkor 37/38mm Less Lethal “Stopper” Single-shot
* (1981) The Milkor 40mm Single Shot Grenade Launcher
* (2008) The 37/38mm or 40mm Stopper Convertible

<doc id="1187903" wikidata="Q5662752" url="?curid=1187903" title="Harold Whitfield">
<text>Squadron Sergeant Major Harold Edward Whitfield VC (10 June 1886 − 19 December 1956) was a British Army soldier and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Background==
Born in Oswestry, Shropshire, in June 1886, Whitfield joined the Shropshire Yeomanry in 1908. When World War I broke out in 1914 he was mobilized spending the next two years in England. In 1916 he was shipped to Egypt, his unit becoming part of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force. He was now a member of the 10th Battalion of the King&#x27;s Shropshire Light Infantry as his unit had been re-designated.

===Citation===
Whitfield was 31 years old, and a private in the 10th Battalion, The King&#x27;s Shropshire Light Infantry, British Army during the First World War Battle of Tell &#x27;Asur when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 10 March 1918 at Burj El Lisaneh, Egypt, during the first of three counter-attacks made by the enemy on the position which had just been captured by his battalion, Private Whitfield, single-handed, charged and captured a Lewis gun, killed the whole gun team of three and turned the gun on the enemy, driving them back with heavy casualties. Later he organised and led a bombing attack on the enemy, again inflicting many casualties and by establishing his party in their position saved many lives and materially assisted in the defeat of the counter-attack.
==Further information==
He later achieved the rank of squadron sergeant major.

In civilian life, he was a farmer. After giving up business, he worked at Express Dairies at Whittington, Shropshire until his death, aged 70. He died from head injuries received in a road accident three days earlier when, cycling after work to his home in Lord Street, Oswestry, his machine was hit from behind by an army Jeep.

His medals are held by the Shropshire Regimental Museum in Shrewsbury Castle.

<text>Buffalo Springfield is the debut studio album by the Canadian-American folk-rock band Buffalo Springfield. Released by Atco Records around November1966, the album was written by the band members Stephen Stills and Neil Young.

Most subsequent pressings of the album from March 1967 onward replaced the track &quot;Baby Don&#x27;t Scold Me&quot; with the standalone single &quot;For What It&#x27;s Worth&quot;, which was ascending the US charts at the time. The single eventually peaked at number 7 on the Hot 100, while the album reached number 80 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Pop Albums chart.

==Background and content==
Buffalo Springfield were formed in early 1966, playing their first gig at The Troubadour club in Hollywood in April of that year. An initial single that appeared on this album, Young&#x27;s &quot;Nowadays Clancy Can&#x27;t Even Sing&quot;, sung by Richie Furay and recorded on July 18, 1966, failed to reach the national charts. But made the Top 40 locally in Los Angeles during August. This album was mostly recorded in July, August and September of 1966 at Gold Star Studios where Phil Spector created his &quot;Wall of Sound&quot; and Brian Wilson produced recordings by the Beach Boys. Young sings lead on only two of his five compositions, Furay singing lead on the other three.

The album was produced by the group&#x27;s managers, Charles Greene and Brian Stone, both of whom had minimal experience as record producers. The group was reportedly unhappy with the sound of the album, feeling that it did not reflect the intensity of their live shows. The band asked Atco for time to re-record the album, but not wanting to miss the Christmas holiday season the label insisted that the record be released as it was.

&quot;Buffalo Springfield&quot; was originally released in both mono and stereo versions as Atco SD 33-200. The back cover contained band profiles of each member in the mode of those for &quot;Tiger Beat&quot;. Recorded the day the LP was released and issued soon after, the band&#x27;s new single by Stills &quot;For What It&#x27;s Worth&quot; became a national hit, making the top ten on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart in March 1967. For the second pressing of March 6, 1967, the album was reissued as Atco SD 33-200A with the hit as the lead track, dropping &quot;Baby Don&#x27;t Scold Me&quot; and slightly reconfiguring the running order. &quot;Baby Don&#x27;t Scold Me&quot; has never been reissued in stereo; all compact disc releases feature only the mono mix of this track.

The album was remastered in HDCD and reissued on June 24, 1997, with two versions on one disc, the mono tracks from Atco 33-200 first with the stereo tracks from SD 33-200A following. Not contained were the stereo mix of &quot;Baby Don&#x27;t Scold Me&quot; from Atco SD 33-200 or the mono mix of &quot;For What It&#x27;s Worth&quot; from Atco 33-200A. &quot;Burned&quot; has also never been issued in stereo. 

The recording sessions took place at Gold Star Studios in Los Angeles from July 18 to September 11, 1966, with &quot;For What It&#x27;s Worth&quot; recorded at Columbia Studios in Los Angeles on December 5, 1966.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Cash Box&quot; said that &quot;Burned&quot; has a &quot;slick, mid-tempo rock arrangement that could catch on big.&quot;

<doc id="1187909" wikidata="Q7728772" url="?curid=1187909" title="The Damage Manual">
<text>The Damage Manual is an English industrial supergroup formed in London in 2000. It featured Martin Atkins on drums and loops, Chris Connelly on vocals, Geordie Walker on guitar and Jah Wobble on bass. A second lineup saw Steven Seibold of the band Hate Dept. replacing both Walker and Wobble after their departure.

==History==

Originally stemming from discussions between Atkins and Wobble, Walker was brought aboard when Wobble expressed interest in working with him. After writing and arranging material through exchanging recordings from their own respective studios, the trio had put together a batch of instrumental ideas in need of a vocalist. It has been said that they originally approached John Lydon (Public Image Ltd, Sex Pistols) for an amicable resurgence (both Atkins and Wobble did notable work in PiL) but he declined the opportunity. Atkins and Walker had both done solid work with vocalist/songwriter Chris Connelly in the early 1990s with Murder, Inc. They released two recordings in 2000, the &quot;One&quot; EP in April followed by a self-titled album that September, both on Atkins&#x27; own Invisible Records label. The group dissolved after a US tour which did not include Jah Wobble who was reported as not being interested in touring with the band, although he had played on the UK leg of the tour. Invisible Records later released a collected reissue of the first EP and full length album titled &quot;Double Damage&quot; as well as a remix LP.

In 2004, a resurrected Damage Manual without Walker and Wobble found Steven Seibold of the band Hate Dept. providing guitar and bass. The revised band released the full length record &quot;Limited Edition.&quot; It was to be followed by a headlining tour in 2004; however, that was canceled due to a series of emergencies within Martin Atkins&#x27;s family. A subsequent tour with Pigface and Sheep on Drugs in 2005 was also canceled, this time due to Chris Connelly&#x27;s illness. A DVD compilation of studio recording footage, interviews and more, titled &quot;The Damage Manual&quot; was released in 2008.

<doc id="1187910" wikidata="Q175517" url="?curid=1187910" title="Norilsk">
<text>Norilsk () is a closed city in Krasnoyarsk Krai, Russia, located south of the western Taymyr Peninsula, around 90 km east of the Yenisey River and 1,500 km north of Krasnoyarsk. Norilsk is 300 km north of the Arctic Circle and 2,400 km from the North Pole. It has a permanent population of 176,735 as of 2024, and up to 220,000 including temporary inhabitants. It is the second-largest city in the region after Krasnoyarsk. Since 2016, Norilsk&#x27;s population has grown steadily. In 2017, for the first time, migration to the city exceeded outflow. In 2018, according to Krasnoyarskstat, natural population growth amounted to 1,357 people: 2,381 were born, and 1,024 died.

It is the world&#x27;s northernmost city with more than 180,000 inhabitants, and the second-largest city (after Murmansk) inside the Arctic Circle. Norilsk and Yakutsk are the only large cities in the continuous permafrost zone.

Norilsk is located atop some of the largest nickel deposits on Earth. Consequently, mining and smelting ore are the major industries. Norilsk is the center of a region where nickel, copper, cobalt, platinum, palladium, and coal are mined. The presence of mineral deposits in the Siberian Craton was known for two centuries before Norilsk was founded, but mining began only in 1939, when subterranean portions of the Norilsk-Talnakh intrusions were found beneath mountainous terrain.

In 2004, two satellite cities (Talnakh and Kayerkan) became districts of the city of Norilsk, and Oganer became a suburb of Norilsk&#x27;s Central District. The jurisdiction of Norilsk also extends to the settlement of Snezhnogorsk, which originated in 1963 as a settlement to accommodate the builders of the Ust-Khantai Hydroelectric Power Station.

Access to Norilsk is restricted for foreign citizens, who are required to obtain special permission to visit the city.

== Name ==
Norilsk owes its name to its geographical location. The Norilsk river flows near the city, which is located near the Norilsk mountains. The travelers Khariton Laptev, Alexander Fyodorovich Middendorf, and Fedor Bogdanovich Schmidt mentioned the river Norilsk and the Norilsk mountains in their accounts. 

According to the Soviet Arctic explorer Nikolay Urvantsev, the Norilsk river was probably given its former name, Norilka, in the 16th–17th centuries during the existence of the city Mangazeya, when the Taymyr was settled by Russian fishing people. It is likely that the name of the river comes from the word &quot;norilo&quot;, a long thin pole that was used to stretch a string of trap nets from hole to hole under the ice. 

Some argue the name derives from the Yukagir word &quot;nerile&quot;, meaning &quot;an earthen hill, consisting of some crags, cliffs&quot; (the mountains around Norilsk do indeed resemble &quot;nerile&quot;s). Others suggest, the name of the river &quot;(Norilka)&quot; and, accordingly, the city name come from the Evenk word &quot;narus&quot;, or &quot;nioril&quot; in Yukaghir, which mean &quot;swamps&quot;. It may also have originated from the name of an Evenk tribe, the Nyurilians; or, from the name of the nearby Lake Murilskoye.

==History==

People knew about the minerals in the Norilsk area as early as the Bronze Age. A site with primitive equipment for smelting and casting, as well as raw materials (balls of native copper), has been discovered near Lake Pyasino.

In the 16th–17th centuries, copper from the Norilsk deposits was used by the inhabitants of Mangazeya, a city located beyond the Arctic Circle on the Taz River, which was an important regional trading and craft center. During the excavations of Mangazeya in 1972–1975, professor Mikhail Ivanovich Belov discovered a vast foundry yard. Platinoids were found in the remains of the copper wares unearthed there. 

Geologist and explorer Nikolay Urvantsev carried out further study of the Norilsk region during expeditions from 1919 to 1926, which confirmed the presence of rich deposits of coal and polymetallic ores in the western spurs of the Putorana Plateau.
In 1921, during one of Urvantsev&#x27;s expeditions, a log cabin was built at the northern foot of Mount Schmidt. This hut is considered to be the first building in Norilsk. The cabin was later moved, and is now located near Norilsk Museum. It has the status of a historical monument.

Norilsk was founded at the end of the 1920s, but the official date of the city&#x27;s foundation is traditionally held to be 1935, when the Norillag system of Gulag labour camp was established and prisoners began construction work on the Norilsk Mining and Metallurgical Plant. Over the next few years Norilsk grew into a settlement for the Norilsk mining and metallurgical complex, and it was granted urban-type settlement status in 1939, and city status in 1953.

In the late 1940s, architects began to design a new city on the eastern shore of Lake Dolgoye, and Norillag prisoners started building work in 1951. In the summer of 1953, inmates from one of the Norillag camps, Gorlag, went on strike, sparking the Norilsk Uprising. 

In 1947, construction began on the Salekhard–Igarka Railway, a line intended to cross northern Siberia. The railway was to have linked the Arctic coal-mining city of Vorkuta in European Russia to the Yenisei River via Salekhard and the Ob River. A spacious railway station was built in Norilsk, in the expectation that the city would eventually have a train service to Moscow, but construction of the Salekhard–Igarka Railway was halted after Joseph Stalin died in 1953.

To support the new city, the Norilsk railway to the port of Dudinka on the Yenisei River was built, first as a narrow-gauge line (winter 1935–36), later as a Russian standard gauge line (completed in the early 1950s).

Norillag was officially closed on August 22, 1956, by order No. 0348 of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. According to the Norillag archives, 16,806 prisoners died in Norilsk as a result of forced labor, starvation and intense cold during the years the camp was operational (1935–1956). Fatalities were especially high during World War II from 1942 to 1944 when food supplies were particularly scarce. An unknown, yet significant number of prisoners continued to work and die in the mines until around 1979.

Several memorial structures have been erected in the city to commemorate Norilsk&#x27;s Gulag past. Russian author Boris Ivanov wrote about the most famous one:
On July 17, 2020, a monument to the Metallurgists of Norilsk was unveiled at the site of the foundation stone. The foundation stone itself is part of the sculptural composition.

In the 1980s, the Norilsk Golgotha memorial complex was built on the slope of Mount Schmidtikh to house the mass graves of the prisoners who founded the city. Poland and the (ex-Soviet) Baltic states have erected monuments to their countrymen who died here. Icon lamps also burn in an Orthodox chapel set on the mountainside.

The discovery in 1966 of the Oktyabrskoye deposit of copper–nickel ores, located 40 kilometers northeast of Norilsk, was a milestone in the further development of the region. The mining settlement of Talnakh was founded at the same time. A new complex, the Nadezhda Metallurgical Plant, was built 15 km west of Norilsk to process the raw materials from the new deposits. Work began in 1971 and the complex was finished in 1981.

A number of Finnish companies assisted in the construction and automation of Norilsk&#x27;s No. 2 copper and nickel smelters (in the Nadezhda complex), which led to substantial numbers of Finnish metallurgical and automation experts and their families coming to Norilsk from 1978 onward, creating a Finnish expat community of some hundreds of people for a couple of years. 
Today Talnakh is the area&#x27;s major mining and ore enrichment site. Enriched ore emulsion is pumped from here to Norilsk&#x27;s metallurgy plants.

Enriched nickel and copper are transported from Dudinka to Murmansk by sea, and from there to the Monchegorsk enrichment and smelting plant on the Kola Peninsula, while more precious content goes upriver to Krasnoyarsk. This transportation takes place only during the summer. The port of Dudinka is closed and dismantled during spring flooding in late May, when waters can rise by up to (a typical spring occurrence on all Siberian rivers, caused by winter ice obstructing meltwater from upstream).

Norilsk-Talnakh continues to be a dangerous mine to work in. According to the mining company, there were 2.4 accidents per 1,000 workers in 2005. In 2017, Norilsk Nickel claimed that it had reduced its overall lost time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) by almost 60% since 2013.

In June 2020, 20,000 tons of diesel fuel spilled from the tank of an NTEK power plant, polluting hundreds of square kilometers and causing serious damage to the local ecosystem.

Norilsk remains a closed city, and foreign citizens require special permission to visit the area.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the Russian system of administrative divisions, it is, together with the urban-type settlement of Snezhnogorsk, Krasnoyarsk Territory, incorporated as the district city of Norilsk—an administrative unit with a status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the district city of Norilsk is incorporated as the Norilsk Urban Okrug.

Since 2005, the city of Norilsk has been divided into three geographically disparate administrative districts:

* Tsentralny District (including Oganer), with a population of 107,351
* Talnakh, with a population of 48,502
* Kayerkan, with a population of 20,882

== Government ==

=== Norilsk City Council of Deputies ===
The Norilsk City Council of Deputies was elected on September 11, 2022, with a five-year mandate. Its chairman is Aleksandr Pestryakov.
=== Mayor of Norilsk ===
The mayor of Norilsk has been Dmitry Karasyov since January 27, 2021. His mandate is for five years.

=== Legislative Assembly of the Krasnoyarsk Territory ===
In September 2021, the composition of the Legislative Assembly of the Krasnoyarsk Territory was updated. Sergey Sizonenko was elected deputy for Taymyr constituency No. 23.

==Demographics==

===Population===
The population of Norilsk as of 2021 is 174,453. After the fall of the USSR the population dropped by 40,000, but this was offset by the subsequent merger of the towns of Kayerkan and Talnakh into Norilsk, maintaining a permanent population of 175,000. Including temporary residents, the population can reach up to 220,000.

Life expectancy for local residents is about 10 years less than average Russian life expectancy, which as of 2013 was around 69 years.

===Ethnic composition===

The city has an ethnically diverse population. As of 2021, the predominant ethnic and cultural groups were Russians, Azerbaijanis, Ukrainians, Tatars, Bashkirs, Nogais, Lezgins, Kazakhs, Ossetians, Chuvash and Kyrgyz. The population of Norilsk consists almost entirely of people who moved to the city in the second half of the 20th century and their descendants, but many of the descendants of prisoners who were amnestied in 1953 still live in the city. There are very few representatives of indigenous ethnicities - Nenets, Enets, Nganasans and Dolgans - in the city.

There were 77 recognized ethnic groups in Norilsk as of 2021.
As of January 1, 2021, in terms of population, the city ranked 103rd out of 1,116 cities in the Russian Federation.


===Religion===

Orthodox Christianity is the main religion in Norilsk. There is a Russian Orthodox cathedral, several Russian Orthodox churches and a Ukrainian Orthodox church. There is also a mosque in Norilsk. Built in 1998 and belonging to the local Tatar community, it is considered to be the northernmost Muslim prayer house in the world.

Since 2014, the city has been the center of the newly formed Norilsk Diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church.

==Time zone==
Norilsk is on Krasnoyarsk Time, seven hours ahead of UTC (UTC+07:00) and 4 hours ahead of Moscow Time (MSK+4)

==Geography==
Norilsk sits between the West Siberian Plain and Central Siberian Plateau at the foot of the Putorana Mountains. It is one of the world&#x27;s most northerly settlements and is both the second largest city built on permafrost (after Yakutsk), and the second largest city inside the Arctic Circle (after Murmansk). Norilsk has an extremely harsh subarctic climate. It is one of the coldest cities in the world – far colder than Murmansk, which is located at almost the same latitude.

As a result of Norilsk&#x27;s geographical isolation on the Taimyr Peninsula, the rest of Russia is usually referred to as “the mainland”, and expressions like “move to the mainland” or “on the mainland” are common among locals. 

===Climate===

Despite being located inside the Arctic Circle, Norilsk has a subarctic climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfc&quot;; Trewartha: &quot;Ecld&quot;) with very long, extremely cold winters (from early October to May) and very short, mild summers. Norilsk experiences negative temperatures for about 240 days a year, and snow cover lasts from seven to nine months, with more than 50 days of snowstorms. Strong winds are common. The average temperature in January is about .

The midnight sun is above the horizon from May 20 to July 24, and the time when the sun does not rise, polar night, lasts from approximately November 30 to January 13.

Summer is short (mid-July) and cool, with an average July temperature 14-15 °C (58 °F), though temperatures can sometimes rise above .

Norilsk has an average annual air temperature of , with an annual variation of absolute temperatures of . The average annual relative humidity is about 76%.

Although Norilsk is located south of the arctic tree line, much of the surrounding area is naturally forest tundra, and there are few trees in the city itself.

===Norilsk-Talnakh nickel deposits===

The nickel deposits of Norilsk-Talnakh are the largest known nickel–copper–palladium deposits in the world. The deposit was formed 250 million years ago during the eruption of the Siberian Traps igneous province (STIP). The STIP erupted over one million cubic kilometers of lava, a large portion of it through a series of flat-lying lava conduits below Norilsk and the Talnakh Mountains.

The current resource known for these mineralized intrusion exceeds 1.8 billion tons.

Norilsk is a center of non-ferrous metallurgy and is home to mining giant Norilsk Nickel&#x27;s mining operations. The smelting of the nickel ore is directly responsible for severe pollution, which generally takes the form of acid rain and smog. By some estimates, Norilsk&#x27;s nickel mines produce one percent of global sulfur dioxide () emissions.

===Ecology===
Norilsk is a city with an extremely unfavorable ecological and environmental situation, but recent initiatives have begun to tackle some of the region&#x27;s most serious pollution issues.

====Pollution====
Russia&#x27;s Federal State Statistics Service lists Norilsk as the most polluted city in Russia. In 2017, Norilsk produced 1.798 million tons of carbon pollutants—nearly six times more than the 304,600 tons that was generated by Russia&#x27;s second-most polluted city, Cherepovets. Norilsk, the report states, decontaminates almost half of its emissions.

In addition, the Blacksmith Institute has included Norilsk in its list of the 10 most polluted places on Earth. The list cites air pollution by particulates, including radioisotopes strontium-90, and caesium-137; the metals nickel, copper, cobalt, and lead; selenium; and by gases (such as nitrogen and carbon oxides, sulfur dioxide, phenols and hydrogen sulfide). The Institute estimates that 4 million tons of cadmium, copper, lead, nickel, arsenic, selenium and zinc are released into the air every year.

Nickel ore is smelted at the company&#x27;s processing site at Norilsk. This smelting is directly responsible for severe pollution, which generally comes in the form of acid rain and smog. By some estimates, Norilsk&#x27;s nickel mines produce 1 percent of global sulfur dioxide emissions. Heavy metal pollution near Norilsk is so severe that it has now become economically feasible to mine surface soil, as the soil has acquired such high concentrations of platinum and palladium.

According to an April 2007 BBC News report, Norilsk Nickel accepted personal responsibility for what had happened to the forests around the city, and insisted that the company was implementing measures to reduce pollution. In 2016, company chairman Vladimir Potanin admitted that environmental issues were the company&#x27;s biggest problem.

In September 2016, images surfaced on social media of the nearby Daldykan River, which had turned red. Russia&#x27;s Environment Ministry issued a statement claiming that preliminary evidence pointed towards Nornickel-owned wastewater pipes from a nearby smelting plant as the source of the contamination. The company referred to intense rainfall and insisted that the incident of sedimentary coloring presented no danger to people or wildlife. The smelting plant, the company said, was in the process of being modernized. Nonetheless, accusations of illegal waste dumping continue to plague the company.

====Environmental initiatives====
The closure of the nickel plant in June 2016 was an important step toward the improvement of the environmental situation in the city, and made it possible to cut annual pollutant emissions from the plant by about 400,000 tons.

Norilsk Nickel has stated that the total emissions of its Russian operations were 6% lower in 2016 than in 2015, primarily thanks to the shutdown of the smelter. Following the completion of a large-scale project to upgrade the Talnakh concentrator, the enterprise&#x27;s capacity has grown by more than 30%, from 7.6 to 10.2 million tons of ore per year. In addition to achieving higher production rates, the goal of the modernization was also to reduce the negative impact on the environment by increasing the recovery of sulfur from ore to tailings.

In 2017, Norilsk Nickel announced that it had invested $14 billion in a major development program aimed at reducing sulfur dioxide emissions in Norilsk by 75% by 2023, using 2015 as a base year. One of the bigger steps taken to combat pollution was the closure of Nornickel&#x27;s old smelter in Norilsk, the main source of SO2 emissions within the city boundaries since 1942.

In 2018, Norilsk Nickel announced the Sulfur Project, which includes the modernization of the Copper Plant, located within the city, and the relocation of blister copper production to the Nadezhda plant, outside the city. Norilsk&#x27;s Arena sports and entertainment complex has a showroom where you can see information about the Sulfur Program and Norilsk Nickel&#x27;s other environmental projects.

In 2021, the Clean Norilsk project was launched, with the support of Federal Minister of Natural Resources and Ecology Alexander Kozlov. The aim of the initiative is to demolish about 500 abandoned buildings and structures, and remove about 2 million square meters of industrial waste. The Clean Norilsk project was included in the nationwide environmental program Clean Arctic.

====May 2020 diesel spill====

On May 29, 2020 a fuel reservoir owned by Nornickel subsidiary NTEK at CHPP-3 ruptured during depressurization, spilling approximately 21,000 tons of diesel fuel and directly threatening the ecosystem of the Arctic Ocean. It was one of the largest oil spills in Russian history. As a result of the leak, according to preliminary estimates, 6,000 tons soaked into the ground, and 15,000 tons leaked into the nearby Ambarnaya River and Daldykan River. By June 3, according to Rosprirodnadzor, the maximum permissible concentration of harmful substances in the water of the Ambarnaya River exceeded the norm by tens of thousands of times. Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, declared a state of emergency. The fuel was a reserve used as a backup for the main gas supply to a power plant. The storage tank was built on permafrost, which, according to a statement by the company, could possibly have melted and become unstable due to climate change. An area of 350 square kilometers (135 square miles) was contaminated and it is proving difficult to clean up the area because there are no roads and the river is too shallow for boats and barges. Oleg Mitvol, former deputy head of Rosprirodnadzor, estimated that the clean-up would cost about 100 billion rubles (US$1.5 billion) and take 5–10 years.

Vice-speaker of the Taymyr Duma Sergey Sizonenko noted that about 700 of Taymyr&#x27;s indigenous people live in the affected area.

As a result of the proceedings, Norilsk Nickel was obliged to pay a fine of 146 billion rubles, which went into the federal budget of the Russian Federation, rather than the budget of the municipality. On August 26, 2021, the head of the Ministry of Emergency Situations of the Russian Federation Alexander Chupriyan announced that clean-up work was complete.

===Water===

At the beginning of 2020, 43 water treatment facilities were operational in Norilsk. The system is constantly being upgraded. The modernization work is partly funded by Norilsk Nickel.

==Economy==

MMC Norilsk Nickel (formerly the Norilsk Mining and Metallurgical Combine), a mining company, is the principal employer in the Norilsk area. Norilsk is a major center of non-ferrous metallurgy; the following non-ferrous metals are mined here: copper, nickel, cobalt; precious metals: palladium, osmium, platinum, gold, silver, iridium, rhodium, ruthenium; by-products: technical sulfur, metallic selenium and tellurium, sulfuric acid. The company produces 35% of the world&#x27;s palladium, 25% of its platinum, 20% of its nickel, 20% of its rhodium, and 10% of its cobalt. In Russia, 96% of nickel, 95% of cobalt, and 55% of copper is produced by Norilsk Nickel. In 2007 the total volume of commodities produced and services carried out by the company in various manufacturing industries amounted to 321.5 billion rubles. In 2021 Norilsk Nickel&#x27;s net profit increased by 92% to $6.974 billion.

The Norilsk industrial region has all the necessary infrastructure for the production of non-ferrous metals: electric power, hydropower, industrial construction and building material production, and repair and service enterprises.

Energy is supplied from the Norilsk CHPP-1, CHPP-2, and CHPP-3 combined cycle power plants, which are located in different parts of the city and are owned by Norilsk Nickel. The company&#x27;s industrial enterprises are the principal consumers of electricity in the city.

==Transport==
The city is served by Alykel Airport and Valek Airport. The Norilsk railway links Norilsk to the port of Dudinka on the Yenisei River, but has been freight-only since 1998. 

There is a road network around Norilsk (such as the A-382 which links to Dudinka and Norilsk Alykel Airport), but the city is not connected to the rest of Russia by road or rail. In essence, Norilsk and Dudinka are an island. As there is no overland communication with the &quot;Big Land&quot;, groups of enthusiasts make road trips to Norilsk in off-road vehicles from other cities in Russia.

Freight is transported to and from Norilsk via Dudinka by boat on the Arctic Ocean or on the Yenisei. Dudinka is connected by sea with Arkhangelsk and Murmansk year-round, and by river with Krasnoyarsk and Dikson during the summer navigation period. 

Norilsk has a municipal bus network, and there is also a bus service to Dudinka. Several dozen taxi firms operate in the city. In bad weather, workers from Norilsk Nickel&#x27;s industrial enterprises, which are located outside the city, are transported to and from the sites in off-road vehicles.

===Norilsk Airport===

Norilsk (Alykel) airport is located 35 kilometers west of the city center. Large-scale reconstruction in 2005-2008 upgraded the passenger terminal building to a modern international standard. In 2016-2018, a large-scale project was carried out to upgrade the airport&#x27;s runway. This has made it possible to increase the airport&#x27;s capacity, offer more flights and increase air safety.

In the summer of 2020, reconstruction work began on the airport as part of a state program to develop Russia&#x27;s transport network. Total investment amounts to more than 12.5 billion rubles (of which 5.8 billion rubles has been invested by Norilsk Nickel).

The vehicle license plate code for Norilsk is 24 RUS and 124 RUS.

==Communication==

Norilsk has a six-digit telephone numbering plan. All districts of the city are connected by a single telephone network.

Fixed-line communications for the population and organizations are provided by MTS, Norilsk Telecom, NN-Infocom, and Rostelecom.

Cellular communication began to develop relatively late in Norilsk: the first operator, Yeniseitelecom, began offering services only in December 2001. There are currently four mobile operators in the city: Yeniseitelecom (since 2001; since 2012 - under the Rostelecom brand; since July 31, 2015 - Tele2 Russia), Beeline (since 2002), MTS (since 2003) and MegaFon (since 2006). All of them, in addition to GSM communications, also provide third-generation services in the UMTS standards (Beeline, MTS and MegaFon, Tele2 Russia) and IMT-MC-450 (Tele2 Russia). Apart from MTS, all these mobile operators, built their own networks from scratch. MTS entered the Norilsk market as a result of the purchase of LLC Sibchallenge (the Taymyrsky Telefon (TT) brand) in 2003.

Since September 22, 2017, communication with the &quot;mainland&quot; has been carried out via fiber optic transmission; before that, communication could only be carried out via satellite channels; there were no cable lines connecting Norilsk with other cities.

A characteristic feature of Norilsk&#x27;s cable network is the presence of communication cables in sewage pipes (on the surface); on the &quot;mainland&quot; the cables are laid in a cable duct.

Norilsk&#x27;s troposcatter communication station was dismantled in the first half of the 2000s.

Since 2017, internet connection speeds have improved due to the installation of a 957-km (595 mi) communications cable laid along the Yenisei River toward Krasnoyarsk.

On June 3, 2019, the city switched to digital television, and most TV channels stopped broadcasting using an analogue signal.

===Fiber optic communication===

Until 2017, Norilsk was the last major city in Russia without high-speed internet access - access to the network was provided by a satellite channel with a speed of only 1 GB/s. The laying of a fiber optic line was complicated by the long distance (956 km) and severe weather conditions (up to -60 degrees in winter). The country&#x27;s &quot;big three&quot; telecom operators did not dare to undertake the project, which was instead handled by the Norilsk Nickel subsidiary Unity. Broadband internet started working in the city in September 2017. The launch was attended by Minister of Telecom and Mass Communications Nikolay Nikiforov and President of Norilsk Nickel Vladimir Potanin. Connectivity is now 40 times faster - up to 40 GB/s. The construction of the fiber optic line cost Norilsk Nickel 2.5 billion rubles, an investment that will not pay off, according to Russian business daily &quot;Vedomosti&quot;.

==Education==

Norilsk has a number of higher education institutions:
* Zabaikalsky State University Polytechnic College
* Norilsk College of Arts
* Norilsk Pedagogical College
* Norilsk Medical College
* Norilsk College of Industrial Technologies and Service

There are also several branches of higher educational institutions based in other Russian cities.

The city has 80 institutions in the general education system: 38 pre-school educational and 29 secondary schools, six preparatory schools, one lyceum, and six further education institutions (the Station for Young Technicians, the Center for Extracurricular Activities, the House of Children&#x27;s Creativity, the Social and Educational Center, the Station for Children&#x27;s and Youth Tourism and Excursions, and the Palace of Creativity for Children and Youth).

There are 41 municipal budgetary autonomous preschool educational institutions in Norilsk, including the Child Development Center. Ten of the city&#x27;s general education institutions offer specialized professional development classes.

==Culture==

Norilsk has a wide range of cultural institutions, including the Norilsk Museum and exhibition complex (which includes an art gallery and the &quot;First House of Norilsk&quot; house-museum), the Norilsk Municipal Cultural Center, the Norilsk Polar Drama Theater, the Norilsk Youth Theater &amp; Studio, cinemas, a sports and entertainment complex, a music school, and art schools for children and adults, as well as many monuments and historical buildings.

The Norilsk Polar Drama Theater is one of the world&#x27;s northernmost theaters. Founded in 1941 in Norillag, the troupe originally consisted mainly of prisoners. Artists such as Georgiy Zhzhonov (1949-1953, after imprisonment), E. Urusova (1950-1954, after imprisonment), Innokenty Smoktunovsky (1946-1951), V. Lukyanov, and V. Abramitskaya, E. Mokienko, A. Shcheglov, and I. Rozovsky all performed in the Norilsk Drama Theater at one time. From 1954-1962, Honored Artist of the RSFSR Efim Gelfand was the chief director of the theater. The theater also collaborated with Grigory Gorin and Yuli Kim, whose musical &quot;How the Soldier Ivan Chonkin Guarded the Plane&quot;, based on Vladimir Voinovich&#x27;s novel &quot;The Life and Extraordinary Adventures of Private Ivan Chonkin&quot;, was staged in Norilsk for the first time and awarded the Golden Ostap Prize at a satire and humor festival in St. Petersburg (1997). In 2009, the Norilsk Polar Drama Theater was classified as a cultural heritage site of special value in the Krasnoyarsk Territory.

The city hosts several annual major cultural and entertainment festivals, such as the Bolshoi Argish festival, the Land is Our Common Home festival, and others.

Norilsk&#x27;s library system has been recognized as the best in the Krasnoyarsk Territory. Libraries are found in every district of the city.

Exhibitions, concerts, creative gatherings, performances by local groups and touring artists regularly take place at the museum and exhibition complex, the Norilsk Municipal Cultural Center, and other cultural and leisure centers in the city.

As in other cities built around metallurgical enterprises, Metallurgist&#x27;s Day (July 17) is an important festival. Members of indigenous northern ethnicities (Nenets, Dolgans, etc.) celebrate the festival of Heiro, which marks the return of the sun to the sky after the polar night.

In June 2021, Norilsk Nickel announced a RUB 4 billion project to create an Arctic Museum of Contemporary Art (AMMA), which includes the reconstruction of the House of Trade building and the opening of an 8,500-square-meter museum.

==Architecture==
The head of the Norilsk camps, Avraami Zavenyagin, was made responsible for restructuring the camp barracks into a full-fledged city. The architects - Gevorg Kochar, Mikael Mazmanyan, Olgerd Trushinsh - were prisoners of Norillag. They were supervised by Vitold Nepokoichitsky, who arrived from Leningrad in 1939, so the first blocks to be constructed in the city were built in the neoclassical style and resemble St. Petersburg. Nepokoichitsky&#x27;s wife, Lydia Minenko, also made a notable contribution. Local features such as Lake Dolgoye and reservoirs in the southwestern district were taken into account in the masterplan. The layout of the city was based on a main avenue, interrupted in places by squares.

One of the main challenges was to minimize the impact of strong winds. The first solutions were unsuccessful (it was initially assumed that snow would be swept out along the city&#x27;s streets, which were specially laid out along the axes of the prevailing winds, but the winds turned out to be too strong, and there was too much snow). After that, the decision was taken to use compact perimeter blocks, which determined the appearance of the city.

In the 1960s, districts of standardized panel housing were built in the outskirts of Norilsk.

The city is unusual in that its gas and water pipes, which are typically laid underground elsewhere, run overground. This is due to the problems created by the seasonal melting and freezing of the top layer of permafrost.

The city center is dominated by buildings in neoclassical style, with outlying residential areas consisting of tower blocks.

===Effects of thawing permafrost===
Rising Arctic temperatures are causing permafrost to thaw, cracking foundations and making many of the city&#x27;s buildings increasingly unstable. In response, regional authorities have announced a 650-million-ruble (€7.9 million) thermal stabilisation program for 10 Norilsk apartment buildings whose foundations are under threat. 

The system consists of a network of pipes through which refrigerant circulates, helping to freeze the foundations in the ground. Soil cooling systems were installed alongside two buildings in 2019 and 2020, and the thermal stabilisation program is scheduled to be completed in 2024.

==Media==

=== Television ===
The Norilsk Television Station broadcasts the signal from Russia’s First and Second Digital Multiplexes in the DVB-T2 format.

On November 16, 2020, the city launched Norilsk TV, its first municipal round-the-clock channel, broadcast by local cable operators MTS and Norсom under number 24. Another local channel, Severny Gorod Norilsk (“The Northern City of Norilsk”) presents its news broadcasts on the Klyuch channel several times a day. Until August 2019, news was produced and broadcast by the GTRK Norilsk Television and Radio Company, a division of VGTRK that was subsequently closed due to reorganization.

Apart from &quot;Zapolyarnaya Pravda&quot;, the local print-based press consists of free papers containing adverts and commercial information.

==Healthcare==

Norilsk&#x27;s residents enjoy a full range of public healthcare services offered by institutions that report to the Ministry of Healthcare of the Krasnoyarsk Territory. All city districts have outpatient clinics for children and adults, emergency rooms, and dentist clinics. An inter-district children&#x27;s hospital is also available. The city operates a blood center.

The healthcare sector also features a broad range of private institutions offering a variety of services.

Norilsk&#x27;s largest hospital is the general city hospital (KGBUZ Norilsk Interdistrict Hospital No. 1), located in the Oganer residential area.

In December 2018, Norilsk completed the construction of a maternity center.

December 2021 saw the inauguration of the first of five healthcare centers Nornickel had promised to build. The remaining four are expected to start operating before 2025.

==Sport==

The city has a futsal club, MFK Norilsk Nickel, which competes in the Super League. Founded in 1993, the club&#x27;s current president is Pavel Belkin. Norilsk Nickel won the Russian championship in the 2001/2002 and made it to the Russian Cup finals in 1999/2000, 2014/15, and 2017/18, eventually winning the trophy in 2019/20. In 2020/2021, the team came third in the Russian championship.

In 2021, Norilsk hosted a basketball match between a representative team from the Norilsk division and PBC CSKA Moscow.

The city&#x27;s range of sports amenities includes the Arktika multidisciplinary sports palace; swimming pools in the Central District, Talnakh, and Kayerkan; the Zapolyarnik outdoor stadium; the BOKMO sports complex; the House of Physical Education in the city center; the Ldinka indoor skating rink; and the Solnyshko stadium. For winter sports Norilsk has the Ol-Gul professional skiing center, the Oganer ski lodge, and the Gora Otdelnaya ski resort. In the summer, suburban tourist centers offer outdoor sports facilities for children and grown-ups. The city also has a junior sports academy.

In 2006, construction work began on a multi-purpose stadium in Metallurgov Square. It was later transformed into the Arena Norilsk shopping mall, which opened its doors in December 2013. In September 2015, the shopping mall welcomed visitors to the new X-Fit-Sever fitness center and the Tropicana water park and swimming pool.

Norilsk has nine municipal extracurricular sports centers, where schoolchildren can choose from a variety of sports and activities: basketball, volleyball, acrobatics, gymnastics, trampoline, track and field, cross-country skiing, fencing, boxing, wrestling, swimming, taekwondo, judo, weightlifting, karate, futsal, figure skating, hockey, and water polo.

Another popular local sport is curling. Norilsk and Dudinka host the international WCT Arctic Cup, which features teams from Hungary, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, and Estonia. The championship is supported by the Russian Curling Federation and Nornickel.

On December 17, 2020, Nornickel announced the opening of Aika, a sports center of over 10,000 square meters. The company has invested 3.6 billion rubles into its construction.

==Social initiatives==

Projects include renovation of the housing stock, repairs to infrastructure, and the relocation of residents to areas with more favorable living conditions.

<doc id="1187920" wikidata="Q5718181" url="?curid=1187920" title="Henry Betterton, 1st Baron Rushcliffe">
<text>Henry Bucknall Betterton, 1st Baron Rushcliffe, (15 August 1872 – 18 November 1949), known as Sir Henry Betterton, Bt, between 1929 and 1935, was a British barrister and Conservative politician. He served as Minister of Labour under Ramsay MacDonald between 1931 and 1934.

==Background and education==
Betterton was the son of Henry Inman Betterton, of Woodville, Leicestershire, and Agnes, daughter of Samuel Bucknall. He was educated at Rugby and Christ Church, Oxford, and was called to the Bar, Inner Temple, in 1896. He practiced for some years at the Chancery Bar.

==Political career==

Betterton was elected Member of Parliament for Rushcliffe in Nottingham in 1918. He served under Stanley Baldwin as Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labour between 1923 and 1924 and again between 1924 and 1929. When the National Government was formed in 1931 he was sworn of the Privy Council and made Minister of Labour under Ramsay MacDonald, a post he held until 1934, when he left the House of Commons after appointment as the chair of the Unemployment Assistance Board.

Betterton was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1918 and a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1920. He was made a Baronet, of Blackfordby in the County of Leicester, in 1929 and raised to the peerage as Baron Rushcliffe, of Blackfordby in the County of Leicester, in 1935. In 1941 he was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire.

== Nurses Salaries Committee ==
Rushcliffe, as he was now known, chaired the Nurses Salaries Committee which was established in October 1941. It was the first official body to fix salary scales and conditions for nursing in England. 

The Committee consisted of two panels, each of twenty members, one panel representing employers, the other employees. The committee published two reports in 1943. 

==Family==
Lord Rushcliffe was twice married. He married firstly Violet, daughter of J. G. Gilliat, in 1912. They had two daughters. After her death in October 1947 he married secondly Inez Alfreda, daughter of Alfred Lubbock and widow of Sir Harold Edward Snagge, in 1948. Rushcliffe died in November 1949, aged 77, when the baronetcy and barony became extinct. His second wife died in May 1955.

<doc id="1187923" wikidata="Q5384093" url="?curid=1187923" title="Eqn (software)">
<text>Part of the troff suite of Unix document layout tools, eqn is a preprocessor that formats equations for printing. A similar program, neqn, accepted the same input as eqn, but produced output tuned to look better in nroff. The eqn program was created in 1974 by Brian Kernighan and Lorinda Cherry.
It was implemented using yacc compiler-compiler.

The input language used by eqn allows the user to write mathematical expressions in much the same way as they would be spoken aloud. The language is defined by a context-free grammar, together with operator precedence and operator associativity rules. The eqn language is similar to the mathematical component of TeX, which appeared several years later, but is simpler and less complete.

An independent compatible implementation of the eqn preprocessor has been developed by GNU as part of groff, the GNU version of troff. The GNU implementation extends the original language by adding a number of new keywords such as &quot;smallover&quot; and &quot;accent&quot;. mandoc, a specialised compiler for UNIX man pages, also contains a standalone eqn parser/formatter.

== History ==
Eqn was written using the yacc parser generator.

== Syntax examples ==
Here is how some examples would be written in eqn (with equivalents in TeX for comparison):

Spaces are important in eqn; tokens are delimited only by whitespace characters, tildes ~, braces {} and double-quotes &quot;&quot;. Thus codice_1 results in formula_1, whereas codice_2 is needed to give the intended formula_2.

<text>The Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF), whose members were referred to as WAAFs (), was the female auxiliary of the British Royal Air Force during the Second World War. Established in 1939, WAAF numbers exceeded 181,000 at its peak strength in 1943, (15.7% of the RAF) with over 2,000 women enlisting per week. 

==History==

A Women&#x27;s Royal Air Force had existed from 1918 to 1920 but had been disbanded in the wake of the end of the First World War, alongside the Women&#x27;s Army Auxiliary Corp (1917–1921) and the first iteration of the Women&#x27;s Royal Naval Service (1917–1919).

== Second World War ==

The Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Air Force was created on 28 June 1939, absorbing the forty-eight RAF companies of the Auxiliary Territorial Service which had existed since 1938, following the Munich Agreement. Conscription of women did not begin until after December 1941 when the UK Government passed the National Service Act (No. 2), which was issued by Royal Proclamation on 10 January 1942. It only applied to those between 20 and 30 years of age and they had the choice of the military auxiliary services, the civilian Women&#x27;s Land Army or factory work in support of the war effort.

== Training ==
Women recruited into the WAAF were given basic training at one of five sites, though not all of the sites ran training simultaneously. The five sites were at West Drayton, Harrogate, Bridgnorth, Innsworth and Wilmslow. All WAAF basic recruit training was located at Wilmslow from 1943.

== Roles in the WAAF ==

WAAFs did not serve as aircrew. (The use of women pilots was limited to the Air Transport Auxiliary, which was civilian, but 30 WAAFs did transfer to serve as pilots in the ATA). Although WAAFs did not participate in active combat, they were exposed to the same dangers as any on the &quot;home front&quot; working at military installations. They were active in parachute packing and the crewing of barrage balloons in addition to performing catering, meteorology, radar, aircraft maintenance, transport, policing, communications duties including wireless telephonic and telegraphic operation. They worked with codes and ciphers, analysed reconnaissance photographs, and performed intelligence operations. WAAFs were a vital presence in the control of aircraft, both in radar stations and iconically as plotters in operation rooms, most notably during the Battle of Britain. These operation rooms directed fighter aircraft against the Luftwaffe, mapping both home and enemy aircraft positions.

Air Force nurses belonged to Princess Mary&#x27;s Royal Air Force Nursing Service instead. Female medical and dental officers were commissioned into the Royal Air Force and held RAF ranks.

WAAFs were paid two-thirds of the pay of male counterparts in RAF ranks.

By the end of the Second World War, WAAF enrolment had declined and the effect of demobilisation was to take the vast majority out of the service. The remainder, now only several hundred strong, was renamed the Women&#x27;s Royal Air Force on 1 February 1949.

===Flying Nightingales===
Nursing Orderlies of the WAAF flew on RAF transport planes to evacuate the wounded from the Normandy battlefields. They were dubbed the Flying Nightingales by the press. The RAF Air Ambulance Unit flew under 46 Group Transport Command from RAF Down Ampney, RAF Broadwell, and RAF Blakehill Farm. RAF Dakota aircraft carried military supplies and ammunition so could not display the Red Cross.

Training for air ambulance nursing duties included instruction in the use of oxygen, injections, learning how to deal with certain types of injuries such as broken bones, missing limb cases, head injuries, burns and colostomies; and to learn the effects of air travel and altitude. Although supplied with parachutes, they were instructed not to use them if the plane was shot down on its return from Europe and instead stay with the wounded soldiers onboard and provide medical support should anyone survive the crash.

The first three Flying Nightingales to arrive in France, a week after D-Day, were Corporal Lydia Alford, LACW Myra Roberts and LACW Edna Birkbeck.

In October 2008 the seven known nurses still living were presented with lifetime achievement awards by the Duchess of Cornwall.

==Directors==

On 1 July 1939, Jane Trefusis Forbes was made Director of WAAF, with the rank of Senior Controller, later, Air Commandant. On 1 January 1943 she was appointed to the rank of Air Chief Commandant with its creation. On 4 October 1943, while Forbes toured Canada, assessing the Royal Canadian Air Force Women&#x27;s Division, she was relieved by Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester, who had been head of the WAAF since 1939, again with the rank of Senior Controller, then, Air Commandant, being gazetted to Air Chief Commandant on 22 March 1943. Forbes retired in August 1944, and the post of director was given to Mary Welsh, who was appointed Air Chief Commandant. After the war, the rank of Air Chief Commandant was suspended and in December 1946, the final director of WAAF, Felicity Hanbury, was appointed.
*Air Chief Commandant Dame Jane Trefusis Forbes, June 1939 – 4 October 1943
*Air Chief Commandant Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester, 4 October 1943 – August 1944
*Air Chief Commandant Dame Mary Welsh, August 1944 – November 1946
*Air Commandant Dame Felicity Hanbury, December 1946 – January 1949

==Ranks==
Initially, the WAAF used the ATS ranking system, although the director held the rank of senior controller (equivalent to brigadier in the British Army and air commodore in the RAF) instead of chief controller (equivalent to major-general or air vice-marshal) as in the ATS. However, in December 1939 the title was changed to air commandant, when the ranks were renamed and reorganised. Other ranks now held identical ranks to male RAF personnel, but officers continued to have a separate rank system, although now different from that of the ATS. From February 1940 it was no longer possible to enter directly as an officer; from that time all officers were appointed from the other ranks. From July 1941 WAAF officers held full commissions. On 1 January 1943, the rank of air chief commandant (equivalent to air vice-marshal) was created with the director&#x27;s appointment to that rank.

The album was included in Robert Dimery&#x27;s 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.

On the double CD &quot;Olympia 1964-1966&quot; issued in 2016 (Barclay no. 4774913), a different track sequence is provided, &quot;more closely resembling the original sequence as performed by Brel&quot;, with &quot;Amsterdam&quot; as third chanson.

<text>In finance, Jensen&#x27;s alpha (or Jensen&#x27;s Performance Index, ex-post alpha) is used to determine the abnormal return of a security or portfolio of securities over the theoretical expected return. It is a version of the standard alpha based on a theoretical performance instead of a market index.

The security could be any asset, such as stocks, bonds, or derivatives. The theoretical return is predicted by a market model, most commonly the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). The market model uses statistical methods to predict the appropriate risk-adjusted return of an asset. The CAPM for instance uses beta as a multiplier.

==History==
Jensen&#x27;s alpha was first used as a measure in the evaluation of mutual fund managers by Michael Jensen in 1968. The CAPM return is supposed to be &#x27;risk adjusted&#x27;, which means it takes account of the relative riskiness of the asset.

This is based on the concept that riskier assets should have higher expected returns than less risky assets. If an asset&#x27;s return is even higher than the risk adjusted return, that asset is said to have &quot;positive alpha&quot; or &quot;abnormal returns&quot;. Investors are constantly seeking investments that have higher alpha.

Since Eugene Fama, many academics believe financial markets are too efficient to allow for repeatedly earning positive Alpha, unless by chance. Nevertheless, Alpha is still widely used to evaluate mutual fund and portfolio manager performance, often in conjunction with the Sharpe ratio and the Treynor ratio.

==Calculation==

:formula_1

In the context of CAPM, calculating alpha requires the following inputs:
* formula_2: the realized return (on the portfolio),
* formula_3: the market return,
* formula_4: the risk-free rate of return, and
* formula_5: the beta of the portfolio.

An additional way of understanding the definition can be obtained by rewriting it as:

:formula_6

If we define the excess return of the fund (market) over the risk free return as formula_7 and formula_8 then Jensen&#x27;s alpha can be expressed as:

:formula_9

==Use in quantitative finance==

Jensen&#x27;s alpha is a statistic that is commonly used in empirical finance to assess the marginal return associated with unit exposure to a given strategy. Generalizing the above definition to the multifactor setting, Jensen&#x27;s alpha is a measure of the marginal return associated with an additional strategy that is not explained by existing factors.

We obtain the CAPM alpha if we consider excess market returns as the only factor. If we add in the Fama-French factors (of size and value), we obtain the 3-factor alpha. If additional factors were to be added (such as momentum) one could ascertain a 4-factor alpha, and so on. If Jensen&#x27;s alpha is significant and positive, then the strategy being considered has a history of generating returns on top of what would be expected based on other factors alone. For example, in the 3-factor case, we may regress momentum factor returns on 3-factor returns to find that momentum generates a significant premium on top of size, value, and market returns.

<text>Michael Ryan Davis (March 10, 1946 – October 25, 2022) was an American writer, political activist, urban theorist, and historian based in Southern California. He was best known for his investigations of power and social class in works such as &quot;City of Quartz&quot; and &quot;Late Victorian Holocausts&quot;. His last two non-fiction books were &quot;Set the Night on Fire: L.A. in the Sixties&quot;, co-authored by Jon Wiener, and &quot;The Monster Enters: COVID-19, Avian Flu, and the Plagues of Capitalism&quot; (February 2022).

==Biography==
===Early life: 1946–1964===

==== Background and childhood ====

Michael Ryan Davis was born in Fontana, California, on March 10, 1946, to Dwight and Mary (Ryan) Davis. Dwight was from Venedocia, Ohio, and was of Welsh and Protestant background. He was a trade-union Democrat and an &quot;anti-racist,&quot; which Davis attributed to his ancestors, Welsh abolitionists and Union soldiers who had settled in the Black Swamp of Ohio. Mary was an Irish Catholic from Columbus, Ohio, and the daughter of Jack Ryan, a veteran of the Spanish–American War. Both parents hitchhiked to California during the Great Depression and came to the El Cajon Valley, but moved to Fontana for a brief period during the Second World War and after.

Returning in 1953, Davis was raised in a tract home in the community of Bostonia in San Diego County. His father Dwight worked in the wholesale meat industry for the Superior Meat Company in downtown San Diego and was a member of the meat cutter&#x27;s union, and his uncle ran a wholesale meat company. The nearly all-white neighborhood of Davis&#x27;s childhood was populated by refugees of the Great Depression, mostly Southern Baptist families from Oklahoma and Texas, and had a country-western ballroom and rodeo. Davis identified with his community as a &quot;redneck&quot; and a &quot;Westerner&quot; in opposition to the &quot;surfer&quot; beach culture held by the wealthier, Methodist neighborhoods south of El Cajon&#x27;s Main Street. Racism and anti-communism were endemic in the town, but Democrats held the dominant political role in the community due to the influence of the Machinists Union.

Dwight Davis was an amateur geologist, and would bring the young Davis with him on frequent excursions in the Colorado Desert to search for uranium deposits, abandoned mines, geodes, and petrified wood. The favorite stop in the desert for the two was the Ocotillo Wells gas station and café, owned by an eccentric elderly proprietor who would debate baseball with Dwight. In 1955, the young Davis was curious about several photos of cadavers taken by the proprietor and posted on the bulletin board in the café. The proprietor explained to Davis that the bodies were of young Mexican men, all executed in arroyos along the border by being shot in the back. Davis remained haunted by the photos of the corpses, and the experience would influence his ideas on the border for the rest of his life.

Davis described the family home as absent of books save for the Vulgate Bible, but his parents were avid readers of newspapers and &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;. The family were among the few Catholics in the neighborhood, and the young Davis often found himself in fistfights with his fundamentalist neighbors, which contributed to him renouncing religion at the age of 10 and gravitating towards science with the advent of &quot;Sputnik&quot;. Davis was a patriotic and conservative pre-adolescent, enlisting in the Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton&#x27;s &quot;Devil Pups&quot; program, and until he was 15, had a picture of Edward Teller, the &quot;father of the hydrogen bomb&quot; on his wall.

Davis&#x27;s patriotic phase was eroded by the dysfunction in his suburban Bostonia. At 12, Davis witnessed the aftermath of the Pendergast murders near his home, where five members of a family, including four children, were murdered by Carl Eder. Davis recalled the scene as if &quot;...somebody had taken a bucket of red paint and thrown it on the walls.&quot; Davis also faced difficulties with a childhood bully in his neighborhood, Gordon Neumann, who was hostile to children, and would later go on to shoot six, killing one of them, and then killing a woman before burning himself to death in 1993. Neumann, who was much older, had previously attacked Davis in second grade, but he was rescued by his father who &quot;almost killed&quot; Neumann. Domestic violence was present in the community but never discussed, and he recalled hearing women and children being frequently beaten while in his backyard in the evenings.

==== Teenage years ====
In high school, Davis became interested in history from the stories of his teachers, who were World War II veterans. He was eventually exposed to John Hersey&#x27;s &quot;Hiroshima&quot;, a reading which challenged all of his ideas on patriotism and the United States. At 16, his father suffered a catastrophic heart attack which undermined the family&#x27;s financial security. Davis had to leave school to provide for the family by working as a delivery truck driver for his uncle&#x27;s wholesale meat company, delivering to restaurants throughout San Diego County. 

After his father&#x27;s heart attack, Davis entered a brooding and troubled period, and was mostly interested in drag racing, Kerouac, and taking bullfighting classes. Davis drank, raced, and stole cars with his friends, which culminated in a near-fatal car accident when he drove his Ford into a brick wall during a drag race, leaving him with a permanent scar on his left thigh. Concurrently, while delivering to restaurants across San Diego&#x27;s East County, he met Lee Gregovich, an older communist and Wobbly whose family emigrated from the Dalmatian coast to work in the copper mines of the American southwest. Gregovich was blacklisted from many employers by the HUAC, but had found a job as a cook at the Chicken Shack, an old-style roadhouse in Julian. The Chicken Shack was the most distant customer Davis delivered to, leading to a weekly ritual: after Davis put the order in the walk-in, Gregovich would provide Davis with red wine and the two would talk. At the end of every discussion, Gregovich urged the young Davis to &quot;read Marx!&quot; 

The &quot;alcoholic, delinquent, and suicidal&quot; Davis was then invited to a Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) demonstration at the Bank of America in downtown San Diego at the behest of his cousin, who had married the Black civil rights activist Jim Stone. The group was doused in lighter fluid and threatened with ignition by a group of sailors, before members of the Nation of Islam rescued them from the fray. Davis described the 1962 demonstration as his &quot;burning bush moment.&quot; Under the guidance of Stone, Davis returned to high school and began working at the San Diego chapter of CORE, to commendation from Gregovich. Davis graduated as one of three valedictorians of El Cajon Valley High, and earned a full scholarship to Reed College.

===Young activist: 1964–1968===

==== New York and Oakland ====
At Reed College, Davis was overwhelmed, alienated by the hippy culture and struggling academically. He joined the Portland, Oregon chapter of CORE, which included the labor historian Jeremy Brecher, who at the time was one of few members of the nascent Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) in the Pacific Northwest. Living &quot;drunk&quot; in the dorm of a girlfriend for five weeks, Davis was expelled from Reed for . Davis was eligible for the draft after his expulsion and passed the physical, but he was rejected after he insisted to the personnel at the induction center he belonged to several subversive organizations. After reading the Port Huron Statement, and at the recommendation of Brecher, Davis boarded a Greyhound bus to New York City to join the national office of SDS, arriving in November of 1964. In 1964 and 1965, Davis worked in the national office of SDS, which was becoming overwhelmed by the growing number of chapters. The national council meetings gave the office the responsibility to organize two major demonstrations, an Anti-Apartheid sit-in and the first march on Washington in protest of the Vietnam War.

Davis was one of the chief coordinators behind the Anti-Apartheid sit-in at Chase Manhattan Bank. In the aftermath of the Sharpeville massacre, Chase Manhattan had led a consortium of international banks that bailed out the Apartheid government of South Africa. The chief ally and tactical organizer to the sit-in was the New York chapter of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), headed by Betita Martinez (then Elisabeth Sutherland), who Davis became acquainted with. Other supporters included exiled members of the African National Congress and young members of the Tanzanian mission to the United Nations. On the Friday afternoon of March 19, 1965, some 600 demonstrators marched on Chase Manhattan&#x27;s offices, with 43 arrested, in what was SDS&#x27;s first act of civil disobedience.

Davis returned to California in early 1965, arriving in the Bay Area during the transformation of the Free Speech Movement into the Vietnam Day Committee. His only subsistence for the next six months was money earned by selling literature sent to him by the SDS national office. The demand for radical literature by students in the Bay Area was enough that Davis could afford to rent a derelict house with no electricity. While couch surfing in the homes of academics, he became aware of Herbert Marcuse, who was lauded by the organizers of the Free Speech Movement. Davis had struggled to understand any of Marcuse&#x27;s &quot;One-Dimensional Man&quot;, but opted to write a letter to the respected academic about the accomplishments and motives of SDS. Marcuse responded, but was critical, suggesting that SDS was only serving to advance Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s war on poverty, and that the organization should seek a more oppositional approach. While in Oakland, Davis burned his draft card in protest of Johnson&#x27;s intervention in the Dominican Republic.

==== Los Angeles and Texas ====
In June of 1965, after burning his draft card, Davis was sent by the SDS national committee to Los Angeles, where he was ordered to assist in organizing protestors against the construction of the 210 freeway through a historically Black neighborhood in Pasadena. Davis and other SDS members also organized weekly meetings to spread awareness about the draft on local campuses. Working in South Los Angeles, he befriended Levi Kingston, a former jazz bassist and radicalized sailor from the Merchant Marine. Kingston previously ran a coffeehouse, Pogo&#x27;s Swamp, which served as a local hub for beatniks and radical students at Los Angeles City College, including the future founder of US Organization, Ron Everett. Kingston connected Davis with local activists in South Central, and the two worked together organizing draft resistance and doing draft counseling. On August 16, 1965, during the Watts uprising, Kingston was shot at by a vigilante from the roof of a fraternity house of USC. Davis was at Kingston&#x27;s side during the shooting, and noted that Kingston, who was Black, was the only one targeted. Kingston later organized a Black draft resistance organization, the Freedom Draft Movement, and remained close friends with Davis for the rest of his life. Davis viewed Kingston as his &quot;big brother&quot; and one of the major figures in his life, and would dedicate his last book, &quot;Set the Night on Fire&quot;, to Kingston, who died shortly before it was published.

In 1966, 19-year-old Davis, characterized as a &quot;draft card-burning SDS leader,&quot; debated actor Kirk Douglas on Melvin Belli&#x27;s talk show. The section of an article in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; on the debate, titled &quot;Outtalked by 19-Year-Old,&quot; described Davis &quot;...to have much less trouble stating his case then either Belli or Douglas,&quot; while Douglas &quot;...was having some difficulty being articulate on his own behalf.&quot; In his recollection on the appearance, Davis, the first to be on, was confronted by Douglas as he was leaving the studio. Douglas allegedly called him a &quot;commie dupe.&quot; Davis responded by telling Douglas that he admired his appearance in &quot;Paths of Glory&quot;, but questioned why the actor would star in an anti-war film while serving as a goodwill ambassador for the Johnson administration in Southeast Asia. According to Davis, Douglas was &quot;speechless.&quot;

As the Southern California regional organizer in 1966, Davis organized protests in support of the anti-war and civil rights movement. The first, in February, was a rally in solidarity with Julian Bond and the peace demonstrations in the South, meant to bring closer ties between the peace and civil rights movements. In May, Davis helped organize a protest against the manufacture of napalm used in the Vietnam War by Dow Chemical, with SDS picketing the Dow Chemical plant in Torrance in coordination with other national protests originating from the Stanford Committee for Peace in Viet Nam. The Torrance picket was countered by demonstrators from the Victory in Vietnam Association, headed by local chapter leader Dana Rohrabacher. Davis also frequently spoke on behalf of SDS in public debates and conferences on world affairs and social revolutions.

In 1967, Davis briefly left Los Angeles to organize for SDS in Texas, and lived in Austin. While in Texas, Davis sought out the populist news editor Archer Fullingham. At the time, Davis was still wary of Marxism and the number of his friends who were becoming Marxists, and instead was interested in the idea of reviving the Populist Party. He approached Fullingham at his residence in Kountze, and proposed the idea to the editor, suggesting that Fullingham could be the leader of the party. According to Davis, Fullingham rebuked him, calling him &quot;...one of the dumbest piss-ants I&#x27;ve ever met,&quot; and suggested Davis &quot;figure out this stuff for yourself.&quot;

In late 1967 and 1968, Davis returned to Los Angeles and joined the Southern California District of the Communist Party, headed by Dorothy Healey, in solidarity with their stand against the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. He left SDS after the 1969 &quot;Days of Rage,&quot; and looked back on the achievements of the movement with ambivalence.

His education was punctuated by stints as a meat cutter, truck driver, and a Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) and Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) activist. At 28, Davis returned to college, studying economics and history at the University of California, Los Angeles on a union scholarship. Davis earned his BA and MA degrees, but did not complete the PhD program in history.

==Career==
Davis was a 1996–1997 Getty Scholar at the Getty Research Institute and received a MacArthur Fellowship Award in 1998. He won the Lannan Literary Award for Nonfiction in 2007.

Davis was Distinguished Professor Emeritus in the Department of Creative Writing at the University of California, Riverside, and an editor of the &quot;New Left Review&quot;. Davis taught urban theory at the Southern California Institute of Architecture and at Stony Brook University before he secured a position at University of California, Irvine&#x27;s history department. He also contributed to the British monthly &quot;Socialist Review&quot;, the organ of the British Socialist Workers Party. As a journalist and essayist, Davis wrote for a number of well-known publications, including &quot;The Nation&quot;, the &quot;New Left Review&quot;, &quot;Jacobin&quot;, and the UK&#x27;s &quot;New Statesman&quot;.

Davis was a self-defined international socialist and &quot;Marxist-Environmentalist&quot;. He wrote in the tradition of socialists/architects/regionalism advocates such as Lewis Mumford and Garrett Eckbo, whom he cited in &quot;Ecology of Fear&quot;. His early book, &quot;Prisoners of the American Dream&quot;, was an important contribution to the Marxist study of U.S. history, political economy, and the state, as well as to the doctrine of revolutionary integrationism.

Davis was also the author of two fiction books for young adults: &quot;Land of the Lost Mammoths&quot; and &quot;Pirates, Bats and Dragons&quot;.

==Criticism and academic reception==
Reviewers have praised Davis&#x27; prose style and his exposés of economic, social, environmental and political injustice. His book &quot;Planet of Slums&quot; inspired a special issue of &quot;Mute&quot; magazine on global slums.

According to Todd Purdum&#x27;s sharply critical 1999 piece, Davis &quot;acknowledged fabricating an entire conversation with a local environmentalist, Lewis McAdams, for a cover story he wrote for &quot;L.A. Weekly&quot; a decade before (in the late 1980s); he defended it as an early attempt at journalistic scene-setting.&quot; However, in his October 2004 &quot;Geography&quot; article, &quot;That Certain Feeling: Mike Davis, Truth and the City,&quot; Kevin Stannard held that this &quot;controversy is explained by Davis&#x27;s ambiguous balancing of academic research and reportage&quot;.

Jon Wiener has defended Davis in &quot;The Nation&quot;, maintaining that his critics are political opponents exaggerating the significance of small errors.

Some academic leftists have also criticized Davis&#x27;s focus on modern urban structures. In a review essay on &quot;City of Quartz&quot;, geographer Cindi Katz criticized its apocalypticism as masculinist and tied it to the flattening of people&#x27;s subjectivity as they are made into &quot;characters&quot; more than social actors. Citing Jane Jacobs&#x27; attacks upon Lewis Mumford in her &quot;Death and Life of Great American Cities,&quot; Andy Merrifield (&quot;MetroMarxism&quot;, Routledge 2002) wrote that Davis&#x27; analysis was &quot;harsh&quot; (p. 170). Davis&#x27; work, particularly &quot;Planet of Slums&quot;, has been criticized by Merrifield and urban studies professor Tom Angotti as &quot;anti-urban&quot; and &quot;overly apocalyptic&quot;.

These critics charge that Davis failed to focus on activist groups among the poor and working class in solving problems—as advocated by Manuel Castells and Marshall Berman.
==Personal life and death==
Davis was married to Mexican artist and professor Alessandra Moctezuma and lived in San Diego, California. Prior to his marriage to Moctezuma, he had been married and divorced four times. Davis met his first wife in SDS, who had returned from the 1964 &quot;Freedom Summer&quot; in Mississippi trying to organize tugboat crews. He had two children with Moctezuma, one child with his fourth wife Sophie Spalding, and one child with his third wife Brigid Loughran.

Davis was diagnosed with cancer in 2020. In a July 25, 2022, story in &quot;The Los Angeles Times,&quot; Davis said, &quot;I&#x27;m in the terminal stage of metastatic esophageal cancer but still up and around the house...I guess what I think about the most is that I&#x27;m just extraordinarily furious and angry. If I have a regret, it&#x27;s not dying in battle or at a barricade as I&#x27;ve always romantically imagined — you know, fighting.&quot; He died from esophageal cancer on October 25, 2022, at age 76.

<text>Stanley Booth (January 5, 1942 – December 19, 2024) was an American music journalist based in Memphis, Tennessee. Characterized by Richie Unterberger as a &quot;fine, if not extremely prolific, writer who generally speaking specializes in portraits of roots musicians, most of whom did their best work in the &#x27;60s and &#x27;50s,&quot; Booth wrote extensively about Keith Richards, Otis Redding, Janis Joplin, James Brown, Elvis Presley, Gram Parsons, B.B. King, and Al Green. He chronicled his travels with the Rolling Stones in several of his works.

==Life and career==
Booth was born in Waycross, Georgia, and received a degree in English and art history from Memphis State University (where he cultivated a lifelong friendship with fellow student Jim Dickinson) in 1963. After leaving a graduate program at Tulane University without taking a degree, he began his journalistic career while maintaining a day job with the Tennessee Department of Welfare. His early oeuvre includes notable articles on Memphis musicians like Presley (including a seminal 1967 article for &quot;Esquire&quot; regarded by James Calemine as &quot;the first serious article&quot; written about the singer) and Redding, the latter of whom Booth witnessed writing the famous song &quot;(Sittin&#x27; On) The Dock of the Bay&quot; with Steve Cropper at Stax Studios on the Friday before Redding&#x27;s death.

After befriending Keith Richards at the instigation of Ian Stewart while covering the trial of Brian Jones in 1968, he ensconced himself in the band&#x27;s inner circle; shortly thereafter, he traveled with the band during their 1969 American tour. During this period, Booth was introduced to fellow Richards confederate and Waycross native Gram Parsons of The Flying Burrito Brothers (he reviewed &quot;The Gilded Palace of Sin&quot; for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; contemporaneously) and was present at the infamous Altamont Free Concert, where a concertgoer was killed by a member of the Hells Angels.

Although his 1970 profile of Furry Lewis received the annual &quot;Playboy&quot; Best Nonfiction Award, Booth retreated to a cabin in the Boston Mountains of Newton County, Arkansas for many years following a 1971 drug conviction of a year&#x27;s probation. Subsequent setbacks, including circumspection toward the Rolling Stones&#x27; 1972 American tour (which he attempted to cover but ultimately castigated as &quot;an ugly scene full of amyl nitrate, Quaaludes, tequila sunrises, cocaine, heroin, and too many pistoleros, and it left me with more material than I could ever use&quot;), precipitated a long creative interregnum typified by &quot;clinical depression, drug problems and domestic upheaval&quot;; these problems were exacerbated by a LSD-induced back injury in 1978. Nevertheless, his long-gestating account of the 1969 tour (&quot;Dance with the Devil: The Rolling Stones and Their Times&quot;, later republished as &quot;The True Adventures of the Rolling Stones&quot;) was finally released to rapturous reviews in 1984. However, the book&#x27;s effusive reception (including plaudits from Richards, who has characterized the book as &quot;the only one I can read and say, &#x27;Yeah, that&#x27;s how it was...&#x27;&quot;) belied lingering contractual issues that ensured Booth made &quot;next to nothing&quot; from his work.

In addition to an essay collection (&quot;Rythm Oil&quot;) and a biography of Richards, Booth also published articles in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;GQ&quot; and many smaller journals. He appeared in many documentaries, not only on Southern music and the Rolling Stones, but Tom Thurman&#x27;s &quot;Movies of Color&quot; and &quot;Peckinpah&quot;. For some years Booth lived near Brunswick, Georgia with his wife, the poet Diann Blakely. Subsequently he resided in Memphis, and was finishing the successor to &quot;Rythm Oil&quot;, currently entitled &quot;Blues Dues&quot;; a memoir, &quot;Tree Full of Owls&quot;; and &quot;Distant Thoughts&quot;, a series of letters chronicling the unfolding literary relationship and love story between Booth and poet Blakely.

Booth died in Memphis, Tennessee, on December 19, 2024, at the age of 82.

<text>Gary James Paulsen (May 17, 1939 – October 13, 2021) was an American writer of children&#x27;s and young adult fiction, best known for coming-of-age stories about the wilderness. He was the author of more than 200 books and wrote more than 200 magazine articles and short stories, and several plays, all primarily for teenagers. He won the Margaret Edwards Award from the American Library Association in 1997 for his lifetime contribution in writing for teens.

==Early life==
Gary Paulsen was born on May 17, 1939, in Minneapolis to Oscar Paulsen and Eunice Paulsen, née Moen. His father was a career army officer who departed soon after Gary’s birth to join General Patton’s staff. Gary next saw his father at age 7 when he and his mother sailed to the Philippines to join him at his army base. He and his mother lived in Thief River Falls, Minnesota. When Gary was 4, his mother took him to live in Chicago. Before World War II ended, she sent him to live with relatives on a farm for a year.

He wrote some fragmented autobiographical works describing his early life, such as &quot;Eastern Sun, Winter Moon: An Autobiographical Odyssey&quot;. The book, which is written in the first person, begins when he was seven, living in Chicago with his mother. Paulsen described several traumatic occurrences that transpired during the three years that are chronicled by the book. For example, one day while his mother was napping, Gary sneaked outside to play. There a vagrant snatched him and attempted to molest him, but his mother suddenly appeared on the scene and beat the man. Paulsen reported an affair his mother had in &quot;Eastern Sun&quot;. He also discussed his mother&#x27;s alcoholism. 

When World War II ended, Gary&#x27;s father sent for him and his mother to come to join him in the Philippines, where he was stationed. A great part of the book Eastern Sun, Winter Moon is dedicated to the voyage by naval vessels (liberty ships) to the Philippines. During the trip, Gary witnessed a plane crash. He, his mother, and the people who were also being transported on this liberty ship looked on as many of the airplane&#x27;s passengers were killed or maimed by the sharks that would follow the ship consuming waste. His mother, the only woman aboard, helped the ship&#x27;s corpsman care for the surviving victims. After arriving in Hawaii, according to Paulsen, his mother began an affair with the corpsman.

In elementary school, he was quite deficient at literacy class and struggled with it. The accounts in &quot;Eastern Sun&quot; ended when Gary and his mother left Manila.

Bits and pieces of Gary&#x27;s adolescence can be cobbled together in &quot;&quot;. In that book, Paulsen discusses how he survived between the ages of twelve and fourteen back in Minnesota. He barely mentions his parents except to say that they were too busy being drunk to stock the refrigerator. He worked several jobs during this time, including setting pins at a bowling alley, delivering newspapers, and working as a farmhand. He bought his own school supplies and a .22 single-shot rifle, which he used to hunt for sustenance. Eventually, he gave up the rifle and manufactured his own bow and arrows, which he used to hunt deer.

Paulsen graduated from Lincoln High School in Thief River Falls, Minnesota. He attended Bemidji State University, but dropped out. He served in the U.S. Army between 1959 and 1962, attaining the rank of sergeant while working with missiles. His army service brought him to New Mexico for a while, a place in which he later chose to settle.

==Careers==
Much of what is known about Paulsen&#x27;s life was revealed in the prologues and epilogues of his own books. In &quot;The Quilt&quot;, one of a series of three novels based on summers spent with his grandmother, Paulsen recounts what a tremendous influence his grandmother had on him. It is difficult to say how factual an autobiography &quot;The Quilt&quot; is intended to be, as Paulsen is supposed to have been six years old in this story and yet he made references to events found in &quot;Eastern Sun&quot;, which is supposed to have been set later. He also refers to himself, in this book, in the third person and only as &quot;the boy&quot;.

Much of Paulsen&#x27;s work features the outdoors and highlights the importance of nature. He often uses &quot;coming of age&quot; themes in his novels, where a character masters the art of survival in isolation as a rite of passage to manhood and maturity. He was critical of technology and has been called a Luddite.

According to Paulsen&#x27;s &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary, &quot;Hatchet&quot; (1987) is probably his best-known novel. Other well-known works include &quot;Dogsong&quot; (1985) and &quot;The Winter Room&quot; (1989).

The ALA Margaret Edwards Award recognizes one writer and a particular body of work for a &quot;significant and lasting contribution to young adult literature&quot;. Paulsen won the annual award in 1997, when the panel cited six books published from 1983 to 1990: &quot;Dancing Carl&quot;, &quot;Hatchet&quot; (first in the series), &quot;The Crossing&quot;, &quot;The Winter Room&quot;, &quot;Canyons&quot;, and &quot;Woodsong&quot;. The citation noted that &quot;[t]he theme of survival is woven throughout, whether it is living through a plane crash or living in an abusive, alcoholic household&quot; and emphasized &quot;Hatchet&quot; in particular for &quot;encompassing a survival theme in all its aspects, physical as well as psychological&quot;.

Three of Paulsen&#x27;s books were runners-up for the Newbery Medal, the premier ALA annual book award for children&#x27;s literature: &quot;Dogsong&quot;, &quot;Hatchet&quot;, and &quot;The Winter Room&quot;.

==Personal life==
Paulsen’s first two marriages ended in divorce. In the mid-1960s, Paulsen moved to Taos, New Mexico, where he met his third wife, Ruth Wright, an illustrator of children&#x27;s books, whom he married in 1971. Paulsen had two children from his first marriage, Lynn and Lance, and a son Jim from his third marriage with Ruth Wright. Although a successful author, Paulsen said he chose to live modestly. He lived throughout New Mexico, including in Santa Fe, La Luz, White Oaks, and Tularosa. He also spent time living on a houseboat on the Pacific Ocean.

In 1983, Paulsen entered the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, and placed 41st out of 54 finishers, with an official time of 17 days, 12 hours, 38 minutes, and 38 seconds. In 1990, suffering from heart disease, Paulsen decided to give up dog sledding, which he described as the most difficult decision he had ever made. Paulsen spent more than a decade sailing the Pacific before getting back into dog sledding in 2003. According to his keynote speech on October 13, 2007, at the Sinclair Lewis writing conference in Sauk Centre, Minnesota, he still intended to compete in the Iditarod. He is listed in the &quot;Withdrawn/Scratched&quot; section of both the 1985 and the 2006 Iditarod. Paulsen was an outdoorsman (a hunter and trapper), who maintained a parcel of land north of Willow, Alaska, where he bred and trained sled dogs for the Iditarod.

==Death==
Paulsen died from cardiac arrest at his home in Tularosa, New Mexico, on October 13, 2021, aged 82.

<text>Joseph Chaim Brenner (; 11 September 1881 – 2 May 1921) was a Hebrew-language author from the Russian Empire, and one of the pioneers of modern Hebrew literature.

==Biography==

Yosef Haim Brenner was born to a poor Jewish family in , Russian Empire (today part of Ukraine). He studied at a yeshiva in Pochep, and published his first story, &quot;Pat Lechem&quot; (&quot;A Loaf of Bread&quot;) in &quot;Ha-Melitz&quot; in 1900, followed by a collection of short stories in 1901.

In 1902, Brenner was drafted into the Russian army. Two years later, when the Russo-Japanese War broke out, he deserted. He was initially captured, but escaped to London with the help of the General Jewish Labor Bund, which he had joined as a youth.

In 1905, he met the Yiddish writer Lamed Shapiro. Brenner lived in an apartment in Whitechapel, which doubled as an office for &quot;HaMe&#x27;orer&quot;, a Hebrew periodical that he edited and published in 1906–07. In 1922, Asher Beilin published &quot;Brenner in London&quot; about this period in Brenner&#x27;s life.

In 1913, Brenner married Chaya Braude, with whom he had a son, Uri.

Brenner immigrated to Palestine (then part of the Ottoman Empire) in 1909. He worked as a farmer, eager to put his Zionist ideology into practice. Unlike A. D. Gordon, however, he could not take the strain of manual labor, and soon left to devote himself to literature and teaching at the Gymnasia Herzliya in Tel Aviv. According to biographer Anita Shapira, he suffered from depression and problems of sexual identity. He was murdered in Jaffa in May 1921 during the Jaffa riots.

==Zionist views==
In his writing, Brenner praised the Zionist endeavor, though also affirmed that the Land of Israel was just another diaspora and no different from other diasporas - which of course happened to be the case at the time.

==Writing style==
Brenner was very much an &quot;experimental&quot; writer, both in his use of language and in literary form. With Modern Hebrew still in its infancy, Brenner improvised with an intriguing mixture of Hebrew, Aramaic, Yiddish, English and Arabic. In his attempt to portray life realistically, his work is full of emotive punctuation and ellipses. Robert Alter, in the collection &quot;Modern Hebrew Literature&quot;, writes that Brenner &quot;had little patience for the aesthetic dimension of imaginative fictions: &#x27;A single particle of truth,&#x27; he once said, &#x27;is more valuable to me than all possible poetry.&#x27;&quot; Brenner &quot;wants the brutally depressing facts to speak for themselves, without any authorial intervention or literary heightening.&quot; This was Alter&#x27;s preface to Brenner&#x27;s story, &quot;The Way Out&quot;, published in 1919, and set during Turkish and British struggles over Palestine in World War I.

==Commemoration==
The site of his murder on Kibbutz Galuyot street is now marked by Brenner House, a center for Hanoar Haoved Vehalomed, the youth organization of the Histadrut. Kibbutz Givat Brenner was also named for him, while kibbutz Revivim was named in honor of his magazine. The Brenner Prize, one of Israel&#x27;s top literary awards, is named for him.

<doc id="1187953" wikidata="Q2862119" url="?curid=1187953" title="Riot gun">
<text>In current usage, a riot gun or less-lethal launcher is a type of firearm used to fire &quot;non-lethal&quot; or &quot;less-lethal&quot; ammunition for the purpose of suppressing riots or apprehending suspects with minimal harm or risk. Less-lethal launchers may be special purpose firearms designed for riot control use, or standard firearms, usually shotguns and grenade launchers, adapted for riot control use with appropriate ammunition. The ammunition is most commonly found in 12 gauge (18.5 mm/.729 inch) shotguns and 37mm (1.46 inch) or 40 mm (1.57 inch) grenade launchers.

In the United States, the term &quot;riot gun&quot; more commonly refers to a riot shotgun.

==Ammunition==

Less-lethal launchers can fire various sorts of ammunition, including:
*Impact projectiles, which rely on kinetic energy, such as baton rounds, bean bag rounds, or rubber bullets
*Tear gas cartridge
*Pepper spray
*Stun rounds
*Smoke round
*Less-lethal shotgun shells
*Less-lethal grenades
*Sound-emitting projectiles
*GLIMPS (Grenade-Launched Imaging Modular Projectile System), a round containing a small camera that transmits images

To avoid breaking the projectile up, less-lethal cartridges are often propelled by gunpowder, which, when fired, may make an eruption of sparks and smoke larger than those made by modern cartridges propelled by smokeless powder.

===Chemical agent ammunition===
Chemical agents may be dispersed in three ways: muzzle dispersion, canister, and ferret.

====Muzzle dispersion====
This method is the simplest: the chemical agent is in the form of a loose powder, which is expelled by the propellant of the cartridge. These rounds are used at short range, and have effect from the muzzle to a range of about 30 feet. This method is best used by operators wearing gas masks, as the chemical agent can easily be blown towards the operator.

====Canister projectiles====
These are also called gas grenades, and are used at longer ranges. They are analogous to rifle grenades, providing increased accuracy and range over hand-thrown gas grenades. Gas grenades may be used by operators without gas masks, as the agent is only dispersed in the area of impact, as far away as . The agent in gas grenades is dispersed as a gas or an aerosol spray.

====Ferret rounds====
These are specialized gas grenades designed to penetrate light barriers, such as windows, hollow core doors, and interior walls, and disperse chemical agents on the far side.

===Impact rounds===
Impact rounds come in a variety of shapes, sizes and compositions for varying roles. Impact rounds are made out of materials of much lower density than the lead normally used in bullets, are larger, and are fired at lower velocities. Rounds are designed with low mass, moderate velocity, and large surface area to prevent the rounds from penetrating the skin significantly or causing severe injury, so they merely provide a painful blow to the target: but instances have been reported where rubber or plastic bullets have caused significant injuries to the body or eyes, and in some cases caused death.

One broad classification of impact rounds is direct fire and indirect fire rounds. Direct fire rounds can be fired directly at the target, ideally targeted low on the target, away from vital organs that are more prone to damage from the impact.

====Baton rounds====
Baton rounds, often called rubber bullets or plastic bullets, are cylinders made of rubber, plastic, wood, or foam, and can be as large as the full bore diameter of the launcher. Smaller baton rounds may be encased in a shell casing or other housing. Baton rounds may fire one long baton, or several shorter batons. Harder or denser baton rounds are intended for skip fire, while softer or less dense batons are intended for direct fire. Baton rounds are the subject of significant controversy, due to extensive use by British and Israeli forces, resulting in a number of avoidable fatalities.

====Beanbag rounds====
Beanbag rounds consist of a tough fabric bag filled with birdshot. The bag is flexible enough to flatten on impact, covering a large surface area, and they are used for direct fire. Beanbag rounds may be wide and flat, designed for close range use, or elliptical in shape, with a fabric tail to provide drag stabilization, for longer range use.

====Rubber buckshot====

These, also called stinger rounds, consist of a number of rubber balls ranging from around in diameter, and are used for direct fire. The small diameter means that each ball contains far less energy than a baton round, but it also limits the range. &quot;Rubber slugs&quot;, used in 12 gauge firearms, consist of a fin stabilized full bore diameter rubber projectile. These are used for long range, accurate direct fire shots on individual targets.

====PepperBall rounds====
PepperBall rounds also known as PepperBall projectiles are a patented impact sphere that is filled with either PAVA or an inert powder. PepperBall projectiles are deployed by air powered launchers and are similar in theory to a paintball marker. The term is not interchangeable with other projectiles on the market as PepperBall, pepper ball and pepperball are trademarked terms.

The PAVA in a PepperBall projectile is a pharmaceutical grade organic irritant and is based on one of the hottest of the six Capsaicinoids found in pepper plants. Capsaicin and Pelargonic Acid Vanillyl amide (aka “PAVA”) are the hottest of the six Capsaicinoids and are equal in heat value.

PAVA has other names:

* Pelargonylvanillylamide
* Nonivamide
* Capsaicin II
* Synthetic capsaicin

==Types of less-lethal launchers==
Purpose-built launchers are commonly large bore guns, formerly 25 to 27 mm (0.98 to 1.06 inches), modern versions are 37 to 40 mm (1.46 to 1.57 inches). Dual-purpose guns are usually 12 gauge (18.5 mm/.729 inches) riot shotguns, firing special less-lethal shotgun shells.

Single-shot large bore launchers, such as the Milkor 37/38mm and 40mm Stopper, M79 grenade launcher, ARWEN ACE, and RGS-50M, are generally break open designs. The barrels are relatively short, resulting in a carbine sized gun, and may have a shoulder stock and/or a forward handgrip to provide greater control. Pistol launchers exist, but are generally only used for short range, muzzle dispersing chemical agents.

Multishot large-bore launchers, such as the ARWEN 37, are usually in the form of a revolver holding five or six rounds in the cylinder. Unlike normal revolvers, the cylinder of a revolving riot gun is too massive to be turned easily by the trigger pull, and is usually turned by a pre-tensioned spring or by a pump action.

Shotguns used for riot control are nearly always in 12 gauge, as that is the gauge in which nearly all riot control rounds are made. Generally riot shotguns are used, such as some models of the Remington 870 and Mossberg 500. Due to the reduced power of riot control rounds, there is insufficient energy to cycle the actions of gas operated and recoil operated firearms, so riot shotguns are manually operated, usually pump action. The advantage of using a riot shotgun for riot control is that the shotgun is a dual use firearm, and can switch quickly to and from the riot control role by changing the ammunition. The downside is that it can fire lethal projectiles, and so extra care must be taken in its use to prevent the wrong ammunition from being used.

A less lethal projectile gun, an example of which is the FN 303, is essentially a paintball marker, either purpose built for riot control, or modified from a commercial paintball marker. The pepper ball guns use special pepper spray ammunition based on paintball technology, consisting of a gelatin capsule filled with the riot control agent. The guns use compressed gas and provide semiautomatic fire, and the pepperballs act just like paintballs, fracturing on impact and splattering the chemical agent on impact. These can be used for direct fire, to break the balls on the target, or indirect fire, breaking near the target and spraying the agent into the target&#x27;s vicinity.

Police have been known to use paintball guns loaded with paint projectiles, to mark particular rioters so that police can easily identify and arrest them later.

Some weapons discharge teargas as a solution in water.

==Legal issues==
Large-bore launchers are classified as firearms in most countries. Shotguns intended for riot use are semi-automatic shotguns subject to relevant regulations. Riot control ammunition may be restricted in various jurisdictions, to a lesser or greater degree than normal shotgun shells.

===United States===
In the U.S. large-bore launchers are subject to BATFE regulations. Since firearms over .50 caliber (12.7 mm) with rifled barrels are considered destructive devices under the National Firearms Act, only smoothbore riot guns may be sold to civilians without an NFA permit; a common form found on the civilian market are M203 grenade launcher replicas, which can be used to fire 37 mm practice rounds. The 40 mm guns are usually rifled, and may fire 40 mm grenades; explosive grenades rely on the spin both for stabilization and for arming the fuze.

==Lethality==
Riot guns have been documented to be lethal in some cases, with the use of an FN 303 by the Boston Police Department in October 2004 resulting in the fatal shooting of Victoria Snelgrove being one such incident.

<text>John Woods Whittle, VC, DCM (3 August 1882 – 2 March 1946) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest decoration for gallantry &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; that can be awarded to members of the British and British Commonwealth armed forces. Whittle was serving as a sergeant in the First World War when he was decorated with the Victoria Cross following two separate actions against German forces during their retreat to the Hindenburg Line in 1917. In the latter action, he attacked a machine gun crew, killing the group and seizing the gun.

Born in Tasmania, Whittle completed twelve months active service during the Second Boer War, before returning to Australia and enlisting in the Royal Navy, where he served for five years as a stoker. Re-enlisting in the army, he was posted to the Army Service Corps, artillery, and Tasmanian Rifle Regiment before the outbreak of the First World War. Transferring to the Australian Imperial Force in 1915, Whittle joined the 12th Battalion in Egypt and embarked for the Western Front the following year. During an attack on the village of La Barque, Whittle rushed a German trench and forced the men from the position; he was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal as a result.

Wounded three times during the war, Whittle was the subject of two courts-martial for unruly behaviour. In October 1918, he returned to Australia at the invitation of the Prime Minister of Australia to assist in recruitment. Discharged from the military in December 1918, he later moved to Sydney. In 1934, Whittle was presented with a Certificate of Merit after saving a drowning boy. He died in 1946, aged 63.

==Early life==
Whittle was born on 2 August 1882 at Huon Island, Tasmania, to Henry Whittle, a labourer, and his wife Catherine (née Sullivan). He grew up in Hobart, and was living there when he enlisted as a private in the 4th Tasmanian (2nd Imperial Bushman) Contingent during 1899, for service in the Second Boer War. The unit embarked for South Africa on 27 March 1901, and arrived four weeks later. The contingent spent the following twelve months on active duty, which included action in the Cape Colony, before returning to Australia on 25 June 1902.

Soon after his return to Australia, Whittle enlisted in the Royal Navy as a stoker. He spent five years as a sailor, during which time he was attached to several ships on the Australia Station, including HMS &quot;Challenger&quot; and . Discharged from the navy in 1907, Whittle joined the Australian Army and was posted to the Army Service Corps; he was to serve in this position for three and a half years. During this time, Whittle married Emily Margaret Roland in a Catholic ceremony at the archbishop&#x27;s house, Hobart, on 23 July 1909.

Following his marriage, Whittle transferred briefly to the artillery, serving with the 31st Battery, Australian Field Artillery. He was then posted to the Tasmanian Rifle Regiment, and remained with this unit until the outbreak of the First World War.

==First World War==
===Early war service===
On 6 August 1915, Whittle transferred to the Australian Imperial Force to see active service overseas during the war. Allotted as a reinforcement to the 26th Battalion as a private, he embarked from Melbourne on 27 October aboard HMAT &quot;Ulysses&quot; bound for Egypt. Appointed acting corporal soon after arrival, he was reallocated to the 12th Battalion with the rank of private on 1 March 1916, following a period of divisional reorganisation and expansion to the Australian forces which were now stationed in Egypt. Whittle was promoted to the substantive rank of corporal two weeks later.

Embarking for the Western Front, the 12th Battalion joined the British Expeditionary Force upon arrival in France on 7 April 1916. Eight days later, Whittle was promoted to lance sergeant. Posted to the Fleurbaix sector of France, the 12th Battalion was engaged in minor operations until July. During this time, Whittle was wounded on 18 June, suffering a gunshot wound to his right arm. Initially admitted to the 3rd Field Ambulance, the injury necessitated treatment in England and Whittle was transferred to the 1st Auxiliary Hospital, Harefield. He rejoined the 12th Battalion on 16 September following recuperation.

Following its involvement at Pozières from July to September 1916, the 12th Battalion moved to the Ypres sector in Belgium, where Whittle was promoted to sergeant on 14 October. In late November, Whittle was admitted to hospital suffering from an illness; on 18 December, he rejoined his unit, which had returned to action on the Somme.

During the German retreat to the Hindenburg Line, Whittle took part in the 12th Battalion&#x27;s attack on the villages of La Barque and Ligny-Thilloy as a member of Captain James Newland&#x27;s A Company on 26–27 February 1917. At Bark Trench, a position on the north side of the centre of La Barque, the company encountered a German strongpoint and Newland was wounded. Rallying his men, Whittle rushed the post and started bombing the occupants with grenades. He then chased the Germans as they began to retreat down the trench line, before they were forced from the position. For his efforts during the assault, Whittle was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal, the recommendation of which cited his &quot;... conspicuous gallantry in the presence of the enemy&quot;. The announcement of the award was published in a supplement to the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 26 April 1917.

===Victoria Cross===
By early April 1917, three German-held outpost villages remained between the area to the south of the I Anzac Corps position and the Hindenburg Line. An attack to capture the villages of Boursies, Demicourt and Hermies by the 1st Australian Division was formulated to commence on 9 April, the day the British offensive opened at Arras. For his gallantry in two separate actions during this engagement, Whittle was awarded the Victoria Cross.

On 8 April, the 12th Battalion was tasked with the capture of the village of Boursies. The attack was to act as a feint to mislead the German forces on the direction from which Hermies was to be assaulted. Whittle had been placed in command of the left platoon in Newland&#x27;s A Company for the attack, which commenced at 03:00. Advancing, the company was subjected to heavy machine gun fire from a derelict mill approximately short of the village and began to suffer heavy casualties. Gathering a party of men, Newland led a bombing attack which was able to dislodge the Germans from the position and secure the area. Continuing their advance, the company was able to reach its objectives, where Whittle was placed in command of a post just beyond the mill.

Throughout the day, the Australians came under heavy shellfire from the Germans. At 22:00, the German forces launched a severe counter-attack against the mill under the cover of an intense barrage of artillery and bombs. Advancing down the main road, they managed to enter the trench Whittle was holding. Gathering all available men, Whittle charged the Germans and was able to restabilise the position. Newland arrived soon after, and the two men worked together until the position was re-established. The 12th Battalion was relieved on 10 April by the 11th Battalion, having succeeded in capturing Boursies at the cost of 240 casualties, of which 70 were killed or missing.

Following a four-day reprieve away from the frontline, the 12th Battalion relieved the 9th Battalion at Lagnicourt on 14 April. Around dawn the following day, the Germans launched a fierce counter-attack against the 1st Australian Division&#x27;s line. Breaking through the Australian line, the Germans forced back the 12th Battalion&#x27;s D Company, which was to the left of Newland&#x27;s A Company. Soon surrounded and under attack on three sides, Newland withdrew the company to a sunken road which had been held by Captain Percy Cherry during the capture of the village three weeks earlier, and lined the depleted company out in a defensive position on both banks. Establishing his platoon in position, Whittle noticed a group of Germans moving a machine gun into position to enfilade the road. As the gunners began to set up the weapon, Whittle, under heavy rifle fire, jumped from the road and single-handedly rushed the crew. Using his bombs, he succeeded in killing the entire group before collecting the gun and taking it back to A Company&#x27;s position.

As reinforcements from the 9th Battalion began to arrive, Newland was able to repulse a third attack by the Germans. Reorganising the 9th and 12th Battalions, a combined counter-attack was able to be launched and the line recaptured by approximately 11:00. The 12th Battalion had suffered 125 casualties during the engagement, including 66 killed or missing. Whittle and Newland were both subsequently awarded a Victoria Cross for their actions that day; the pair were the only two permanent members of the Australian military to receive the decoration during the war.

The full citation for Whittle&#x27;s Victoria Cross appeared in a supplement to the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 8 June 1917, reading:

===Later war service===
In late April 1917, Whittle spent three days in a field hospital receiving treatment for psoriasis, before embarking for England on attachment to a training battalion. Joining the unit on 6 May, he once again underwent an eight-day furlough in a military hospital later in the month. During this time, Whittle attended an investiture ceremony in the forecourt of Buckingham Palace on 21 July, where he was decorated by King George V with his Victoria Cross and Distinguished Conduct Medal.

Re-embarking for France on 25 August, Whittle rejoined the 12th Battalion which had subsequently moved to Belgium in preparation for another offensive at Ypres. On 1 October, he was the subject of a General Court Martial in the field, charged with two offences committed on 27 September: 1. Drunkenness while on active service; 2. Conduct to the prejudice of good order and Military Discipline while on active service, in that when the commanding officer was addressing a parade he called out words to the effect of: &quot;But we are good soldiers though&quot;. He was found guilty of both offences, and sentenced to be reduced to the rank of corporal. Following four days detention during the trial, Whittle re-joined the 12th Battalion on 8 October.

The 12th Battalion spent the next two months engaged in minor operations in Belgium, before once again transferring to the trenches in France during December. During this time, Whittle was re-promoted to the rank of sergeant. With the commencement of the German spring offensive of 1918, the 12th Battalion assisted in repulsing the assault in the months of March and April. While engaged in this operation, Whittle was wounded on 19 March and admitted to a field hospital suffering shrapnel wounds to his right hand. Recovering from the wound, he returned to the 12th Battalion in April. Later that month, Whittle was charged with conduct to the prejudice of good order and Military Discipline a second time for mutilating his pay book; he was reprimanded by the battalion&#x27;s commanding officer as a result.

In June 1918, Whittle was posted to the 2nd Army Central School for a five-week stint. Returning to the 12th Battalion in mid-July, Whittle was wounded in action for the third time; suffering shrapnel wounds to his right elbow, he was admitted to the 3rd Australian Field Ambulance on 25 July. Evacuated to England, he was admitted to the Central Military Hospital, Eastbourne, before transferring to the 3rd Australian Auxiliary Hospital, Dartford, two weeks later. During this time, Billy Hughes, as Prime Minister of Australia, invited several of Australia&#x27;s Victoria Cross recipients of the war to return to Australia and assist in a recruiting drive; Whittle was among a group of ten who accepted the offer. The party embarked aboard HMAT &quot;Medic&quot; on 24 August, bound for Melbourne. Arriving seven weeks later, Whittle returned to Tasmania and assisted with recruiting on the island during the last few weeks of the war. Following the Armistice, he was discharged from the Australian Imperial Force on 15 December 1918.

==Later life==

After his discharge from the Australian Imperial Force, Whittle re-settled in Hobart with his family. He briefly re-enlisted in the 40th Battalion during 1921, before moving to Sydney, where he gained employment as an inspector on the staff of an insurance company. Whittle later worked in several other jobs, including a period of service with Tooth&#x27;s Brewery in Sydney. On 11 November 1929, he attended the New South Wales Dinner for recipients of the Victoria Cross in Sydney, before briefly re-enlisting in the Australian Army once again the following year.
On 7 February 1934, Whittle was walking through University Park when he was accosted by a small boy who said that his younger brother had fallen into the lake. Rushing to the area, Whittle dived into the weed-choked lake and began searching for the boy. Finding him unconscious, Whittle brought the boy to the bank and applied artificial respiration for approximately half an hour; the child later came around and was taken to hospital. Whittle left the scene and proceeded home in a taxi without leaving his name, but his identity was subsequently discovered and he was presented with a Certificate of Merit by the Royal Life Saving Society. Whittle himself was ill for a fortnight due to swallowing some of the foul water in the ornamental lake.

During the Second World War, Whittle&#x27;s son, Ivan Ernest, served as a private in the 2/33rd Australian Infantry Battalion. He was killed on 7 September 1943 when a B-24 Liberator bomber crashed into his battalion&#x27;s marshalling yard at Port Moresby, New Guinea. Just over two years later, and aged 63, John Whittle died of a cerebral haemorrhage at his home in Glebe on 2 March 1946. Survived by his wife, second son and three daughters, he was buried in Rookwood Cemetery.

<text>Alfred Wilcox VC (16 December 1884 – 30 March 1954), was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Until 2006, he was the only recipient of the Victoria Cross whose exact resting place was unknown.

He was 33 years old, and a lance-corporal in the 2/4th Battalion, The Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 12 September 1918 near Laventie, France, when his company was held up by enemy machine-gun fire at short range, Lance-Corporal Wilcox rushed to the nearest enemy gun, bombing it and killing the gunner. Being then attacked by an enemy bombing party, the corporal picked up enemy stick bombs and led his company against the next gun, finally capturing and destroying it. Then, left with only one man he continued bombing and captured a third gun. Going up the trench, bombing as he went, he captured a fourth gun and then returned to his platoon.

A nephew was Charles Wilcox GC. In 2006 his nephew John Wilcox, who had attended his Uncle&#x27;s funeral in 1954, helped historian Chris Sutton in locating his grave in Aston Church. A service was held, and a memorial unveiled on 12 September 2006, 88 years to the day after he captured the guns.

He is named prominently on the front panel of the plinth unveiled at the new student accommodation in James Wolfe Road, Oxford on 16 August 2019 at the site of Cowley Barracks.

<text>Alfred Robert Wilkinson VC (5 December 1896 – 18 October 1940), was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Wilkinson enlisted in the Royal Scots Greys at the outbreak of war in 1914 and transferred the following year to the 2nd. Battalion, Seaforth Highlanders. He finally transferred to the 1/5th Manchester Regiment and went to France in July 1916.

He was 21 years old, and a private in the 1/5th Battalion, The Manchester Regiment, British Army during the Battle of the Selle in the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 20 October 1918 at Marou, France, during the attack, four runners had been killed in attempting to deliver a message to the supporting company and Private Wilkinson volunteered for the duty. He succeeded in delivering the message although the journey involved exposure to extremely heavy machine-gun and shell fire for 600 yards. He showed magnificent courage and complete indifference to danger and throughout the remainder of the day continued to do splendid work.

He later achieved the rank of lieutenant. Wilkinson was killed in incident in a laboratory at Bickershaw Colliery, Leigh where he died from carbon monoxide poisoning https://victoriacrossonline.co.uk/alfred-robert-wilkinson-vc/.

His grave stone at Leigh Cemetery has the VC engraved on it. In 2018 it had a trail of poppies leading to it which had been made by local school children.

A statue of Wilkinson has been erected (October 2018) on the green at Pennington Wharf, which is a housing estate at the old Bickershaw Colliery. The road around the green has also been named Wilkinson Park Drive. The road sign is gold in colour and has the VC printed on it.

A mural featuring Wilkinson has been painted on a house on Twist Lane, Leigh, situated between Dorothy Grove and Arthur Street.

<doc id="1187978" wikidata="Q1926717" url="?curid=1187978" title="Micha Josef Berdyczewski">
<text>Micha Josef Berdyczewski (), or Mikhah Yosef Bin-Gorion (August 7, 1865 – November 18, 1921) (surname also written &quot;Berdichevsky&quot;), was a Podolian Jewish writer of Hebrew, a journalist, and a scholar. He appealed for the Jews to change their way of thinking, freeing themselves from dogmas ruling the Jewish religion, tradition and history, but is also known for his work with pre-modern Jewish myths and legends. He wrote in Hebrew, Yiddish and German and has been described as &quot;the first Hebrew writer living in Berlin to be revered in the world of German letters&quot;.

==Biography==
Micha Josef Berdyczewski was born in 1865 in the town of Medzhibozh (today Medzhybizh) in Podolia Governorate, to a family of Hasidic Rabbis. His father was the town Rabbi. In his youth he began to read works from the Jewish Enlightenment, and their influence is noticeable in his works. Berdyczewski was forced to divorce his first wife following her family&#x27;s objection to his involvement with secular literature. He then moved to the Volozhin Yeshiva, but there too, his pursuit of unconventional literature stirred anger and objection.

One of his earliest publications was about this period of his life—an article titled &quot;Hetzitz V&#x27;nifga&quot; (הציץ ונפגע in Hebrew—literally &quot;peeked and got hurt&quot;, meaning &quot;gone to heresy&quot;), published in 1888 in the newspaper &quot;Ha-Melitz&quot;. Most of his works from this period were polemic, and his emotional style became his trademark throughout his writing career.

In 1890 he went to Germany and Switzerland, studied at the universities of Berlin, Breslau and Bern, and completed his Doctor of Philosophy degree. In this period Berdyczewski studied the works of the great German philosophers Nietzsche and Hegel, and was deeply influenced by them. In the ten years until his return to Ukraine, he published many articles and stories in Hebrew journals. Up to 1900, the year in which he married Rahel Ramberg, Berdyczewski had published ten books.

Upon his return to Ukraine, Berdyczewski encountered the harsh reality of Jewish life in the Pale of Settlement, and subsequently the subject of many of his stories is the deterioration of the traditional way of life.

After a short stay in Warsaw, Berdyczewski returned to Germany in 1911, where he lived until his death in 1921. He is buried in the Jewish Cemetery in Weißensee, Berlin.

==Literary career==
Berdyczewski adopted the surname Bin-Gorion, first used to sign a collection of his works that he published in Berlin in 1914. The name Bin-Gorion is also inscribed on his tombstone. His last years were spent in intensive writing and research, collecting Jewish legends and folktales and publishing in Hebrew, Yiddish, and German. After his death, his wife and their son Emanuel Bin-Gorion translated some of his works into German, among them &quot;Die Sagen der Juden&quot; (&quot;The Legends of the Jews&quot;, 1935) and &quot;Der Born Judas&quot; (&quot;The Well of Judah&quot;), published in six volumes.

Berdyczewski&#x27;s popularity among the Jews of his age is attributed to his success in expressing their ambivalent attitude towards the traditional Jewish world, and to the secular European culture.

==Commemoration==
The Israeli moshav Sdot Micha, founded in 1955, was named after him.

<text>George Clement Tryon, 1st Baron Tryon, PC (15 May 1871 – 24 November 1940) was a British Conservative politician who served in a number of ministerial positions in the inter-war years.

==Early life==
George Clement Tryon was son of Vice-Admiral Sir George Tryon and Clementina Heathcote, daughter of Gilbert Heathcote, 1st Baron Aveland. 

Educated at Eton College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, Tryon joined the Grenadier Guards in 1890, serving for sixteen years before retiring as major.

==Career==
Tryon was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Brighton in 1910, serving until 1940. He became Under-Secretary of Air in 1919 and Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Pensions in 1920 and in 1922 became a Privy Counsellor. He served as Minister of Pensions himself 1922–24, 1924–29 and 1931–35 and was then appointed Postmaster General in 1935, serving until 1940. He was one of those to appear on the first day of BBC television broadcasts, 2 November 1936.

In April 1940, Tryon was elevated to the peerage as Baron Tryon, of Durnford in the County of Wilts and made Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and First Commissioner of Works. However, he was replaced as Chancellor (by Lord Hankey) when Winston Churchill became prime minister in May, while retaining the First Commissionership; he relinquished that post the following October, a few weeks before his death, aged 69.

==Personal life==
He married Averil Vivian, daughter of Colonel Sir Henry Hussey Vivian, 1st Baron Swansea. They had two children, including Charles, 2nd Baron Tryon.

<text>Workers Party of India is a political party in the Indian state of West Bengal. WPI has its origin in the Democratic Vanguard in India. DV was formed in 1943 when a group led by Jiban Lal Chattopadhyay broke away from the Radical Democratic Party of Manabendra Nath Roy. DV were dissatisfied with the development of RDP into a non-Marxist outfit. Jiban Lal Chattopadhyay had been elected secretary of the Bengal Congress in 1930.

On 12 June 1960 DV became the Workers Party of India. The party adopted a hammer and sickle in a five-pointed star as its symbol. The party held its Second All India Conference in Calcutta in 1965, its Third All India Conference in 1970 and the Fourth All India General Conference in 1971. The 8th All India Conference was held in 1976.

WPI was part of the United Left Front that contested the 1967 West Bengal state assembly election. WPI was part of the Communist Party of India (Marxist)-led United Front, which governed West Bengal 1967–1971. Jyotibhushan Bhattacharya, a leader of the Workers Party, was the Education Minister and Information Minister in the two United Front governments in 1967 and 1969 in West Bengal. He was the General Secretary of the Party since 1970. Jiban Lal Chattopadhyay died in 1970. In 1976 WPI split into two. One faction, led by Monidranarayan Basu, retained the name WPI. The other faction led by Bhattacharya called itself Communist Workers Party. Subsequently the Communist Workers Party of India changed its name to Workers Party. Basu died in a car accident, and Salien Pal took over the leadership.

In the 1980 Indian general election WPI fielded Mohammed Elias Razi in the Raiganj constituency. He obtained 13,554 votes (2.89%).

WPI publishes &quot;Ganabiplab&quot; (Popular Revolution) in Bengali. As of the early 1980s, &quot;Ganabiplab&quot; was printed in 1,500 copies and its editor was Hemendra Behari Mukherjee. Its publication was somewhat irregular at the time.

WPI considers the Communist Party of the Soviet Union as revisionist. Of late, WPI has joined the Left Front in 2011. Its secretary is Manik Dutta.

<text>Fort Simpson (Slavey language: &quot;Łı́ı́dlı̨ı̨ Kų́ę́&quot; &quot;place where rivers come together&quot;) is a village, the only one in the entire territory, in the Dehcho Region of the Northwest Territories, Canada. The community is located on an island at the confluence of the Mackenzie and Liard rivers. It is approximately west of Yellowknife. Both rivers were traditionally trade routes for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and the native Dene people of the area.

Fort Simpson is the regional centre of the Dehcho and is the gateway to the scenic South Nahanni River and the Nahanni National Park Reserve. Fort Simpson can be reached by air, water and road and has full secondary and elementary school service. The Mackenzie Highway was extended to Fort Simpson in 1970-71.

The central section of the community is on an island near the south bank of the Mackenzie River, but industrial areas and rural residential areas are located along the highway as far as the Fort Simpson Airport, just beyond which is the Liard River ferry crossing.

==History==
Fort Simpson was first started as a fur trading site in 1803 then named Fort of the Forks. The Village of Fort Simpson was a permanent settlement in July 1822 when the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company constructed a trading post, naming it for George Simpson, then the Governor of Rupert&#x27;s Land. Until 1910 Fort Simpson was &quot;a company town&quot;, with some participation by the Anglican and Roman Catholic Missions. The Dené know it as &quot;Łı́ı́dlı̨ı̨ Kų́ę́&quot;, meaning &quot;the place where the rivers come together&quot;. It was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1969.

Pope John Paul II attempted to visit the community in September 1984 as part of his Canadian tour, but was prevented from landing due to fog; in an address over the radio from Yellowknife, he promised to visit in the future. He did so in September 1987 near the end of the tour of the United States, making a side trip to Fort Simpson.

==Culture==
There are two main annual festivals which occur in Fort Simpson.

The first which is held in March is known as the &quot;Beavertail Jamboree&quot;. This is a winter carnival which includes traditional games, snowmobile races, and talent shows.

The other festival is the &quot;Open Sky Festival&quot; which is held annually on or around the Canada Day long weekend. The Open Sky Festival is a multi-disciplinary arts festival which has occurred annually since 2001. Festival events include musical, theatrical, and other performances as well as traditional Dehcho Dene Crafts, visual arts, new media exhibitions, workshops, and demonstrations. The Open Sky festival is hosted by the Open Sky Creative Society, a multi-disciplinary arts organization serving artists working in the Dehcho region.

The Dene of the community are represented by the Łı́ı́dlı̨ı̨ Kų́ę́ First Nation and the Métis by Fort Simpson Métis Local 52. Both groups belong to the Dehcho First Nations.
==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Fort Simpson had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

In 2016, 890 people identified as Indigenous peoples. Of these the majority, 770, of the residents are First Nations with 95 Métis and 20 Inuit. The main languages are South Slavey and English.


==Climate==
Fort Simpson has a subarctic climate (Köppen &quot;Dfc&quot;) with long, cold winters and warm but short summers. July temperatures are unusually warm for such northerly areas, which demonstrates the extreme continental nature of the area&#x27;s climate. However, the heat quickly turns into cold winters when daylight hours turn drastically shorter. Transition seasons are extremely short, and the year is on average dominated by the winter and to a lesser extent, summer. The average monthly temperatures range from in January to in July. Most of the precipitation falls during the summer months.

The highest temperature ever recorded in Fort Simpson was on 25 July 1994 and 13 July 2014. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on 1 February 1947.

<text>In mechanics, a diaphragm is a sheet of a semi-flexible material anchored at its periphery and most often round in shape. It serves either as a barrier between two chambers, moving slightly up into one chamber or down into the other depending on differences in pressure, or as a device that vibrates when certain frequencies are applied to it.

A diaphragm pump uses a diaphragm to pump a fluid. A typical design is to have air on one side constantly vary in pressure, with fluid on the other side. The increase and decrease in volume caused by the action of the diaphragm alternately forces fluid out the chamber and draws more fluid in from its source. The action of the diaphragm is very similar to the action of a plunger with the exception that a diaphragm responds to changes in pressure rather than the mechanical force of the shaft.

A diaphragm pressure tank is a tank which has pressurant sealed inside on one side of the diaphragm. It is favored in certain applications due to its high durability and reliability. This comes with a downside, as the vessel needs to be replaced in the case of a rupture of the diaphragm.
Diaphragm tanks are used to store hypergolic propellant aboard space probes and various other spacecraft.

Pressure regulators use diaphragms as part of their design. Most uses of compressed gasses, for example, in gas welding and scuba diving rely on regulators to deliver their gas output at appropriate pressures. Automotive fuel systems frequently require fuel-pressure regulators; this is true of many fuel injection systems as well as in vehicles fueled with liquefied petroleum gas (autogas) and compressed natural gas.

<doc id="1188012" wikidata="Q5271779" url="?curid=1188012" title="Diaphragm (acoustics)">
<text>In the field of acoustics, a diaphragm is a transducer intended to inter-convert mechanical vibrations to sounds, or vice versa. It is commonly constructed of a thin membrane or sheet of various materials, suspended at its edges. The varying air pressure of sound waves imparts mechanical vibrations to the diaphragm which can then be converted to some other type of signal; examples of this type of diaphragm are found in microphones and the human eardrum. Conversely a diaphragm vibrated by a source of energy beats against the air, creating sound waves. Examples of this type of diaphragm are loudspeaker cones and earphone diaphragms and are found in air horns.

==Loudspeaker==

In an electrodynamic loudspeaker, a diaphragm is the thin, semi-rigid membrane attached to the voice coil, which moves in a magnetic gap, vibrating the diaphragm, and producing sound. It can also be called a cone, though not all speaker diaphragms are cone-shaped. Diaphragms are also found in headphones.

Quality midrange and bass drivers are usually made from paper, paper composites and laminates, plastic materials such as polypropylene, or mineral/fiber-filled polypropylene. Such materials have very high strength/weight ratios (paper being even higher than metals) and tend to be relatively immune from flexing during large excursions. This allows the driver to react quickly during transitions in music (i.e. fast changing transient impulses) and minimizes acoustical output distortion.

If properly designed in terms of mass, stiffness, and damping, paper woofer/midrange cones can outperform many exotic drivers made from more expensive materials. Other materials used for diaphragms include polypropylene (PP), polyetheretherketone (PEEK) polycarbonate (PC), Mylar (PET), silk, glassfibre, carbon fibre, titanium, aluminium, aluminium-magnesium alloy, nickel, and beryllium. A paper woofer with a peak-to-peak excursion of 0.5 inches at 60 Hz undergoes a maximum acceleration of 92 &quot;g&quot;s.

Paper-based cones account for approximately 85% of the cones sold worldwide. The ability of paper (cellulose) to be easily modified by chemical or mechanical means gives it a practical processing advantage not found in other common cone materials.

The purpose of the cone/surround assembly is to accurately reproduce the voice coil signal waveform. Inaccurate reproduction of the voice coil signal results in acoustical distortion. The ideal for a cone/surround assembly is an extended range of linearity or &quot;pistonic&quot; motion characterized by i) minimal acoustical breakup of the cone material, ii) minimal standing wave patterns in the cone, and iii) linearity of the surrounds force-deflection curve. The cone stiffness/damping plus the surround&#x27;s linearity/damping play a crucial role in accuracy of the reproduced voice coil signal waveform. This is the crux of high-fidelity stereo.

The surround may be resin-treated cloth, resin-treated non-wovens, polymeric foams, or thermoplastic elastomers over-molded onto the cone body. An ideal surround has a linear force-deflection curve with sufficient damping to fully absorb vibrational transmissions from the cone/surround interface, and the &quot;toughness&quot; to withstand long-term vibration-induced fatigue. Sometimes the conical part and the outer surround are molded in one step and are one piece as commonly used for a Guitar speaker.

Other types of speakers (such as electrostatic loudspeakers) may use a thin membrane instead of a cone.

==Microphone==

Microphones can be thought of as speakers in reverse. The sound waves strike the thin diaphragm, causing it to vibrate. Microphone diaphragms, unlike speaker diaphragms, tend to be thin and flexible, since they need to absorb as much sound as possible. In a condenser microphone, the diaphragm is placed in front of a plate and is charged. In a dynamic microphone, the diaphragm is glued to a magnetic coil, similar to the one in a dynamic loudspeaker. (In fact, a dynamic speaker can be used as a rudimentary microphone, and vice versa.)

The diaphragm in a microphone works similarly to the human eardrum.

==Other uses==

In a phonograph reproducer, the diaphragm is a flat disk of typically mica or isinglass that converts the mechanical vibration imparted on the buttress from the recorded groove into sound. In the case of acoustic recording the reproducer converts the sound into the motion of the needle that scribes the groove on the recording media.

He was admitted to the bar and opened a law practice in Dobson in 1914, relocating to Mount Airy to practice law there. From 1932 to 1938, he was a trustee of the University of North Carolina, and was named to the state&#x27;s Superior Court in 1937.

Folger had served only two months as a judge when he resigned to serve on the Democratic National Committee; he was a member of the Committee from 1936 until his death in 1941.

As a Democrat, he was elected to the 76th United States Congress in 1938 and re-election to the 77th U.S. Congress in 1940, but his second term was cut short by his death in a car accident in Mount Airy on April 30, 1941.

In a special election, his brother John Hamlin Folger was chosen to succeed him on Congress.

<text>Barbara Parkins (born May 22, 1942) is a Canadian-American former actress, singer, dancer and photographer.

==Early life==
Parkins was born in Vancouver, British Columbia. At the age of 16, she and her adoptive mother moved to Los Angeles, where she enrolled at Hollywood High School and studied acting, tap, ballet and fencing at the Falcon School, where her mother played the piano.

Parkins worked as an usher in a cinema to pay for drama lessons.

==Professional life==
Parkins began her career as a backup singer and dancer in the nightclub acts of stars like comedian George Burns. She made her film debut in the 1961 low-budget crime caper &quot;20,000 Eyes&quot;, and guest-starred in television series such as &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot;, &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, &quot;Perry Mason&quot; and &quot;The Wide Country&quot;.
Parkins was involved in two of the most highly publicized projects of the 1960s, the ABC primetime serial &quot;Peyton Place&quot;, and the film adaptation of Jacqueline Susann&#x27;s best-selling novel, &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot;.

In &quot;Peyton Place&quot;, Parkins received lead billing for her role as small-town bad girl Betty Anderson. The character was scripted to die in a car crash six weeks into the season, but audience reaction to Parkins was overwhelmingly favorable and her character was kept in the story line. In a late-1965 interview, the actress said she was lucky to have the role of Anderson, calling her character the &quot;salt and pepper in the stew&quot;.

Parkins was the only female star nominated for an award throughout the run of the series (1964–1969). In 1966, she was nominated for an Emmy Award as Lead Actress in a Drama Series, but lost to Barbara Stanwyck for &quot;The Big Valley&quot;. Parkins said while losing the award was painful, she was glad to have lost it to Stanwyck instead of Anne Francis, who was also nominated and whose work Parkins thought was &quot;unfeminine&quot;.

Following the close of &quot;Peyton Place&quot;, producer Paul Monash developed a spin-off series, &quot;The Girl from Peyton Place&quot;, for Parkins. However, when co-star Ryan O&#x27;Neal, who played her husband, declined to participate, the project was shelved. 

In &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot;, Parkins played Anne Welles, a character based on author Susann. The Welles character was described as &quot;the good girl with a million-dollar face and all the bad breaks&quot;. Although the film was trashed by the critics, it was a commercial success and became a cult classic.

After visiting London in 1968 to be a bridesmaid in the wedding of &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot; co-star Sharon Tate and director Roman Polanski, Parkins moved to England, where she starred in several productions, including &quot;Puppet on a Chain&quot; (1970), &quot;The Mephisto Waltz&quot; (1971), and &quot;Shout at the Devil&quot; (1976), Parkins said she moved to London because it was relaxed and simple, and she loved its traditions.

Parkins posed for nude pictorials in the May 1967, February 1970 and May 1976 editions of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine.

In the 1970s and 1980s, Parkins appeared on American television in series that included &quot;&quot;, &quot;Captains and the Kings&quot; and &quot;The Testimony of Two Men,&quot; &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;Hotel&quot;, and &quot;Vega$&quot;. She also appeared in television films, including &quot;To Catch a King&quot;, in which she portrayed the Duchess of Windsor, and opposite Sharon Stone in &quot;Calendar Girl Murders&quot;.

Parkins returned to the role of Betty Anderson in &quot;Peyton Place: The Next Generation&quot; (1985), a one-shot sequel to the series.

In 1991, Parkins starred in Canadian mystery series &quot;Scene of the Crime&quot;. She appeared in two Susann-inspired projects, the biography &quot;Scandalous Me&quot; and a segment of the Lifetime series &quot;Intimate Portrait&quot;.

In 2006, Parkins participated with Ted Casablanca on the audio commentary for the DVD release of &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot;.

While filming &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot;, Parkins met photographer Edward Steichen, a friend of the film&#x27;s cinematographer, and was influenced to begin a lifetime career in photography. She is also an advocate for endangered wildlife.

<doc id="1188024" wikidata="Q7143911" url="?curid=1188024" title="Pat Paulsen">
<text>Patrick Layton Paulsen (July 6, 1927 – April 25, 1997) was an American comedian and satirist notable for his roles on several of the Smothers Brothers television shows, and for his satirical campaigns for President of the United States between 1968 and 1996.

==Early life and education==
Paulsen was born July 6, 1927, in South Bend, Washington, a small fishing town in Pacific County. He was the son of Beulah Inez (née Fadden) and Norman Inge Paulsen, a Norwegian immigrant who worked for the Coast Guard. The family moved to California when he was 10, where he graduated from Tamalpais High School in Mill Valley in May 1945.

Paulsen joined the U.S. Marine Corps after high school, when World War II was still being waged, but it ended before he was shipped overseas. However, he did experience overseas duty, including guarding captured Japanese soldiers during their repatriation. He returned home after the war and worked as a posting clerk, a truck driver, a hod carrier, a Fuller Brush salesman, and a gypsum miner. Later, he was employed as a photostat operator for several years. He attended San Francisco City College, then joined an acting group called &quot;The Ric-y-tic Players,&quot; and he formed a comedy trio that included his brother Lorin.

==Career in comedy==

Paulsen developed a solo act, appearing as a comedic guitarist in various clubs on the West Coast and in New York City. He met the Smothers Brothers during an appearance in San Francisco. &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; premiered in 1967, and Paulsen said that he was hired because he sold them inexpensive songs and would run errands. At first, he was cast as their editorialist, but his deadpan, double-talk comments on the issues of the day propelled him into the national spotlight. His work on &quot;The Smothers Brothers&#x27; Comedy Hour&quot; earned him an Emmy Award in 1968.

Paulsen made a guest appearance on &quot;The Monkees&quot; in the 1968 episode &quot;Monkees Watch Their Feet&quot;, playing the Secretary of National Defense. He also made many appearances on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;. In 1968, he appeared as timid Federal Agent Bosley Cranston in &quot;The Night of the Camera&quot; in Season 4 of &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;. During the first season of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; in 1969–1970, he appeared in a series of comic skits. He was featured in the 1970 &quot;Get Smart&quot; episode &quot;The Mess of Adrian Listenger&quot;. Early in 1970, he headlined his own series &quot;Pat Paulsen&#x27;s Half a Comedy Hour&quot;, which ran 13 weeks on ABC. Guests on the first show were former Vice President Hubert Humphrey and an animated Daffy Duck, whom Paulsen interviewed.

In 1971, Paulsen performed in the play &quot;Play It Again, Sam&quot; at Cherry County Playhouse in Traverse City, Michigan. He enjoyed this professional summer-stock theater so much that he became business partners in 1976 with television writer and producer Neil Rosen and bought Cherry County Playhouse. He starred in a production every summer except 1973, all the way through the 1995 season. He starred in 24 different plays, including &quot;The Fantasticks&quot;, &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;, &quot;Harvey&quot;, and &quot;The Sunshine Boys&quot;. He appeared in nightclubs, theaters, and conventions throughout the country. In 1984, he co-starred in the film &quot;Night Patrol&quot;, a vehicle for The Unknown Comic.

==Political campaigns==
After CBS sold five minutes of airtime on &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; for a political ad, the show&#x27;s writers came up with a bit in which Paulsen disclaimed association with the ad and stating that the ad was unfair to him as a candidate. CBS refused to air the bit, but the incident became the impetus for the &quot;Smothers Brothers&quot; writers launching a Pat Paulsen presidential campaign. His campaign in 1968 and succeeding years was grounded in comedy, although not without serious commentary. He ran the supposed campaigns using obvious lies, double talk and tongue-in-cheek attacks on the major candidates, and he responded to all criticism with his catchphrase, &quot;Picky, picky, picky&quot;. His campaign slogans included &quot;Just a common, ordinary, simple savior of America&#x27;s destiny&quot;, &quot;We’ve upped our standards, now up yours&quot; and &quot;United we sit&quot;. He gave essentially the same answer to every question on social issues: &quot;To get to the meat of the matter, I will come right to the point, and take note of the fact that the heart of the issue in the final analysis escapes me.&quot; In announcing his candidacy on the Smothers Brothers show, Paulsen said, &quot;Now I ask you: Will I solve our economic problems? Will I ease the causes of racial tension? Will I bring a peaceful end to Vietnam? Sure, why not?&quot;

Paulsen&#x27;s name appeared on the ballot in New Hampshire for the Democratic primary several times. In 1996, he received 921 votes (one percent) to finish second to President Bill Clinton (76,754 votes); this was ahead of real politicians such as Buffalo mayor James D. Griffin. In 1992, he came in second to George Bush in the North Dakota Republican primary. In the 1992 Republican Party primaries, he received 10,984 votes total.

==Winemaking==

In 1971, Paulsen and his then-wife Jane opened Pat Paulsen Vineyards, a vineyard and winemaking operation in Sonoma County, California. Shortly after Clint Eastwood was elected mayor of Carmel, California (1986), Paulsen proclaimed himself &quot;mayor&quot; of Asti, the small town near his vineyard. The office was of his own invention.

==Personal life==
In the 1980s, Paulsen began a relationship with social worker Linda Chaney, whom he met at a Denver comedy club. She began serving as his booking agent and the two were married in 1988. However, he learned that she was diverting his funds into her own personal accounts and he filed for divorce after only 40 days. He later sued her and was awarded a judgment of $233,000, but Chaney said that, even if she had the money, she would &quot;go out and shred it rather than turn it over&quot; to Paulsen. 

In 1995, Paulsen was diagnosed with colon cancer and doctors discovered that the cancer had spread to his brain and lymph nodes in 1997. He sought alternative medicine treatment for his cancer in Tijuana, Mexico and died there from complications of pneumonia and kidney failure on April 25, 1997. Paulsen was fondly remembered by fans who enjoyed his mockery of the entire electoral process. &quot;Whenever I’d walk around with him,&quot; Tom Smothers said, &quot;people would yell, &#x27;Hey, Mr. President.&#x27; We miss him.&quot;

<text>Alessandro &quot;Sandro&quot; Mazzinghi (3 October 1938 – 22 August 2020) was an Italian professional boxer who held the world light middleweight championship twice.

== Biography ==
In 1961 Mazzinghi won the Military World Championships. The same year he turned professional, following his elder brother Guido. He eventually became a European and World Champion, and had a record of 64–3–0–2 (42 KOs). Of these matches, five were valid for the European title and 8 for the World title. On 7 September 1963 he won the world light middleweight title, defeating the American Ralph Dupas by a ninth-round technical knockout in Milan. In December of the same year, a rematch took place in Sydney, Australia, and Mazzinghi won again by knockout.

He remained world champion until 1965, a year after a terrible accident. The boxer remained in critical condition for some days, with a skull fracture that would condition his career in the following years. Mazzinghi came back in the ring to defend his title in Genoa, Italy, against Tony Montano (knockout in the 12th round) and in Rome, against Fortunato Manca (winning by decision in 15 rounds).

On 18 June 1965 Mazzinghi faced Nino Benvenuti and lost by knockout in the sixth round, losing his world title. In their rematch, Mazzinghi barely escaped an early round knockout when he was floored – unable to rise in time he was saved by the bell. He rebounded from that close call to give Benvenuti a hard fight, but Benvenuti won by decision.

Mazzinghi started again and gained the Superwelter European crown in Rome, Italy, on 17 June 1966 defeating Yoland Leveque; he defended his title four times.

On 26 May 1968, Mazzinghi beat Korean Ki-Soo Kim in &quot;San Siro&quot; Stadium, Milan, Italy, regaining the world light middleweight crown.

On 25 October he fought against American Freddie Little, but was disqualified by the referee for an illegal blow; this decision was revoked and the result of the match was changed to a &quot;no contest&quot;. A few days later, the Italian Boxing Federation took away the title from Mazzinghi, after the WBA wouldn&#x27;t.

In 1970 he left boxing for seven years, and would make a comeback from 1977 to 1978. He retired in 1978.

<text>John Hamlin Folger (December 18, 1880 – July 19, 1963) was a Democratic U.S. Congressman from North Carolina between 1941 and 1949.

Born in Rockford, North Carolina, Folger attended public schools in Surry County. He graduated from Guilford College in Greensboro, North Carolina and studied law at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

Admitted to the bar in 1901, Folger opened a law practice in Dobson, North Carolina. He was elected mayor of the town of Mount Airy, North Carolina from 1909, serving until 1911. He was sent to the North Carolina House of Representatives from 1927 to 1928 and to the North Carolina State Senate from 1931 to 1932.

Active in the North Carolina Democratic Party, Folger was a delegate to state Democratic conventions between 1924 and 1940 and to the Democratic National Conventions in 1932 and 1944. After the death of his brother, Rep. Alonzo D. Folger, John Folger was sent to Congress in a special election called to fill the vacancy. He was re-elected three more times, serving in the 77th, 78th, 79th, and 80th United States Congresses.

Folger did not stand for reelection in 1948 and returned to his law practice in Mount Airy, North Carolina, from which he retired in 1959. He died in Clemmons, North Carolina in 1963 and is buried in Mount Airy&#x27;s Oakdale Cemetery.

<doc id="1188061" wikidata="Q893925" url="?curid=1188061" title="Born in East L.A. (film)">
<text>Born in East L.A. is a 1987 American satirical comedy film written and directed by Cheech Marin in his feature film directorial debut, who also starred in the film. It co-stars Paul Rodriguez, Daniel Stern, Kamala Lopez, Jan-Michael Vincent, Lupe Ontiveros and Jason Scott Lee in his feature film debut. The film is based on his song of the same name, released as a 1985 single by Cheech &amp; Chong. The film focuses on Rudy Robles, a Mexican-American from East Los Angeles who is mistaken for an illegal migrant and deported.

&quot;Born in East L.A.&quot; marked Marin&#x27;s first solo film, without the involvement of his comedy partner, Tommy Chong, at the insistence of executive Frank Price, who was fired between greenlighting and production due to the failure of &quot;Howard the Duck&quot;. &quot;Born in East L.A.&quot; was ultimately a financial success, and bolstered Marin&#x27;s reputation in the Latino community, winning several awards at the Havana Film Festival.

==Plot==
Guadalupe Rudolfo &quot;Rudy&quot; Robles is told by his mother to pick up his cousin Javier at a factory in Downtown Los Angeles before she and his sister leave for Fresno. Robles arrives shortly before immigration officials raid the factory, and because he is carrying no identification and cannot confirm he is a U.S. citizen, he is deported to Mexico.

In Tijuana, Rudy becomes friends with Jimmy and Dolores. Unable to contact his mother, Rudy makes repeated attempts to cross the border, all ending in failure. He cannot speak more than very simple Spanglish, though he is fluent in German from having served in West Germany in the United States Army. Jimmy offers to get him back home for a price. Having left home without his wallet, Rudy works for Jimmy as doorman at a strip club, earning extra money selling oranges and teaching five would-be immigrants to walk and talk like East Los Angeles natives.

Rudy falls in love with Dolores and finally raises the money needed to be smuggled across the border. He goes on a date with Dolores and the next day, Rudy bids farewell to Jimmy, receives a last kiss goodbye from Dolores, and climbs into the truck that will take him across the border. After seeing a woman pleading to join her husband on the truck despite lacking the money to pay, Rudy gives the woman his place.

Rudy stands for the last time on the hill of the Mexico–United States border while two immigration officers sit in their truck watching in laughter. As Rudy raises his arms, hundreds of people appear and race towards the border, causing the immigration officers to hide in their truck. Rudy, Dolores, and their friends are able to walk into the United States.

Rudy and Dolores are kidnapped by smugglers and held for ransom, coincidentally, across the street from Rudy&#x27;s home. He calls his cousin Javier to bring him his wallet so that he can pay off the kidnappers. The immigration officials from the beginning of the film arrive, and while Rudy is able to show his identification, the official say he is going to send Dolores back to El Salvador. Rudy and Dolores escape during the East Los Angeles Cinco de Mayo parade, ending up on a float with a priest, who they ask to marry them. Rudy and Dolores both look at each other in happiness as they are wed.

The immigration officer arrives to place Dolores under arrest, but Rudy explains that they are now married, making Dolores a legal resident. The crowd, witnessing everything, cheers.

==Cast==

Although Tommy Chong did not have a role in the film, he appears in a comedic scene as a portrait of Jesus Christ above an answering machine.

==Production==
Following the success of Cheech &amp; Chong&#x27;s 1985 single &quot;Born in East L.A.&quot;, a parody of Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; written by Cheech Marin, Frank Price, at the time a development executive at Universal Pictures, called Marin, whom he had known from having previously worked at Columbia Pictures, where Cheech &amp; Chong had made the films &quot;Nice Dreams&quot; and &quot;Things Are Tough All Over&quot;. Price suggested that the song would make a good film, but without Tommy Chong&#x27;s involvement. With the deterioration of Marin&#x27;s comedy partnership with Chong, Marin signed a contract with Universal to write, direct and star in &quot;Born in East L.A.&quot;

Production commenced in Tijuana, Mexico, where the crew faced difficulty filming from the Mexican government. Actor Tony Plana (Feo) described Cheech Marin as a collaborative director, saying, &quot;He was open to ideas, and finding the socially relevant insight into what we were doing, as well as finding the comedy.&quot; Marin and Plana worked together on developing the character, with Plana stating, &quot;At the time, we had a couple of religious scandals going on, such as Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart — preachers who sinned publicly. We wanted to satirize them a little bit. We turned Feo into a guy who extorts money in the name of Jesus.&quot; Plana also improvised much of his dialogue, including &quot;You don’t have to thank me, you just have to pay me.&quot;

Also improvised was the scene with Marin standing outside the bar; the people that walked past him, Marin claims, were not extras, and their reactions were real.

During shooting, the film&#x27;s producer, Peter MacGregor-Scott, was interviewed by a Mexican radio station, where he called for extras to come to the set to appear in the movie, where they would receive American scale pay, lunch and transportation paid for by the production.

==Release==
Between the greenlighting and production of &quot;Born in East L.A.&quot;, Frank Price was fired by Universal due to the failure of &quot;Howard the Duck&quot;, which was blamed on Price. As a result of Price&#x27;s departure from the studio, Universal chose to spend little money publicizing &quot;Born in East L.A.&quot;, as Price was the only executive who supported the project.

Ultimately, according to Marin, the film was the second-highest grossing release in its opening week. The film also increased Marin&#x27;s popularity among the Latino community. However, the movie dropped by 40% in its second week at the box office. Still, &quot;Born in East L.A.&quot; proved to be a financial success. During release, Marin traveled to Havana, Cuba to present the film as an official entry at the Havana Film Festival.

According to Marin, he also received praise from Richard Pryor, who Marin says left him a phone message stating, &quot;I went in not expecting much and was blown away. You made a great film. You should be proud.&quot;

===Critical response===
Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;Born in East L.A.&quot; is an across-the-board winner&quot; and said that it had &quot;more energy and drive&quot; than &quot;La Bamba&quot;.

More negative response, however, came from critic Richard Harrington of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, who wrote:

Caryn James, film critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, wrote:

===Accolades===
* Havana Film Festival: Winner, Best Production Design &amp; Best Screenplay; 1987.
* Havana Film Festival: 3rd Place, Grand Coral Prize, Cheech Marin; 1987.

==Home video releases and alterations==
An extended version of the film was produced for television, containing a longer, alternate ending.

The movie was released in VHS and DVD format. Shout Factory released it on Blu-ray under their Shout Select banner on March 19, 2019. The Blu-ray edition included new interviews with Cheech Marin, Paul Rodriguez and Kamala Lopez, an audio commentary by Marin, the trailer, the theatrical cut in high definition and the extended television version in standard definition and in 4:3 (1.33:1) aspect ratio, although High Def Digest reported that the television cut was presented in widescreen at 1.85:1.

<text>In computability theory, an [[undecidable problem]] is a decision problem for which an effective method (algorithm) to derive the correct answer does not exist. More formally, an undecidable problem is a problem whose language is not a recursive set; see the article Decidable language. There are uncountably many undecidable problems, so the list below is necessarily incomplete. Though undecidable languages are not recursive languages, they may be subsets of Turing recognizable languages: i.e., such undecidable languages may be recursively enumerable.

Many, if not most, undecidable problems in mathematics can be posed as word problems: determining when two distinct strings of symbols (encoding some mathematical concept or object) represent the same object or not.

For undecidability in axiomatic mathematics, see List of statements undecidable in ZFC.

==Problems in logic==
* Hilbert&#x27;s Entscheidungsproblem.
* Type inference and type checking for the second-order lambda calculus (or equivalent).
* Determining whether a first-order sentence in the logic of graphs can be realized by a finite undirected graph.
* Trakhtenbrot&#x27;s theorem - Finite satisfiability is undecidable.
* Satisfiability of first order Horn clauses.

==Problems about abstract machines==
* The halting problem (determining whether a Turing machine halts on a given input) and the mortality problem (determining whether it halts for every starting configuration).
* Determining whether a Turing machine is a busy beaver champion (i.e., is the longest-running among halting Turing machines with the same number of states and symbols).
* Rice&#x27;s theorem states that for all nontrivial properties of partial functions, it is undecidable whether a given machine computes a partial function with that property.
* The halting problem for a register machine: a finite-state automaton with no inputs and two counters that can be incremented, decremented, and tested for zero.
* Universality of a nondeterministic pushdown automaton: determining whether all words are accepted.
* The problem whether a tag system halts.

==Problems about matrices==
* The mortal matrix problem.
* Determining whether a finite set of upper triangular 3 × 3 matrices with nonnegative integer entries generates a free semigroup.
* Determining whether two finitely generated subsemigroups of integer matrices have a common element.

==Problems in combinatorial group theory==
* The word problem for groups.
* The conjugacy problem.
* The group isomorphism problem.

==Problems in topology==

* Determining whether two finite simplicial complexes are homeomorphic.
* Determining whether a finite simplicial complex is (homeomorphic to) a manifold.
* Determining whether the fundamental group of a finite simplicial complex is trivial.
* Determining whether two non-simply connected 5-manifolds are homeomorphic, or if a 5-manifold is homeomorphic to S5.

==Problems in analysis==
* For functions in certain classes, the problem of determining: whether two functions are equal, known as the zero-equivalence problem (see Richardson&#x27;s theorem); the zeroes of a function; whether the indefinite integral of a function is also in the class. Of course, some subclasses of these problems are decidable. For example, there is an effective decision procedure for the elementary integration of any function which belongs to a field of transcendental elementary functions, the Risch algorithm.
* &quot;The problem of deciding whether the definite contour multiple integral of an elementary meromorphic function is zero over an everywhere real analytic manifold on which it is analytic&quot;, a consequence of the MRDP theorem resolving Hilbert&#x27;s tenth problem.
* Determining the domain of a solution to an ordinary differential equation of the form
::formula_1
:where &quot;x&quot; is a vector in Rn, &quot;p&quot;(&quot;t&quot;, &quot;x&quot;) is a vector of polynomials in &quot;t&quot; and &quot;x&quot;, and &quot;(t0, x0)&quot; belongs to Rn+1.

==Problems about formal languages and grammars==
* The Post correspondence problem.
* Determining if a context-free grammar generates all possible strings, or if it is ambiguous.
* Given two context-free grammars, determining whether they generate the same set of strings, or whether one generates a subset of the strings generated by the other, or whether there is any string at all that both generate.

==Other problems==
* The problem of determining if a given set of Wang tiles can tile the plane.
* The problem of determining the Kolmogorov complexity of a string.
* Hilbert&#x27;s tenth problem: the problem of deciding whether a Diophantine equation (multivariable polynomial equation) has a solution in integers.
* Determining whether a given initial point with rational coordinates is periodic, or whether it lies in the basin of attraction of a given open set, in a piecewise-linear iterated map in two dimensions, or in a piecewise-linear flow in three dimensions.
* Determining whether a λ-calculus formula has a normal form.
* Conway&#x27;s Game of Life on whether, given an initial pattern and another pattern, the latter pattern can ever appear from the initial one.
* Rule 110 - most questions involving &quot;can property X appear later&quot; are undecidable.
* The problem of determining whether a quantum mechanical system has a spectral gap.
* Finding the capacity of an information-stable finite state machine channel.
* In network coding, determining whether a network is solvable.
* Determining whether a player has a winning strategy in a game of &quot;&quot;.
* Planning in a partially observable Markov decision process.

* In the ray tracing problem for a 3-dimensional system of reflective or refractive objects, determining if a ray beginning at a given position and direction eventually reaches a certain point.
* Determining if a particle path of an ideal fluid on a three dimensional domain eventually reaches a certain region in space.

<text>Vladimir Mikhailovich Myasishchev (; 28 September 1902 – 14 October 1978) was a Soviet aircraft designer, major general of Engineering (1944), Hero of Socialist Labour (1957), Doctor of Technical Sciences (1959), Honoured Scientist of the RSFSR (1972).

After his graduation from Moscow State Technical University in 1926, Myasishchev worked at the Tupolev Design Bureau and took part in constructing airplanes, such as Tupolev TB-1, Tupolev TB-3, and Tupolev ANT-20. As an assistant to Boris Lisunov, he traveled to the United States in 1937 to help translate the Douglas DC-3 drawings in preparation for the production of the Lisunov Li-2.

In 1938, Myasishchev became a victim of a repression campaign. While in confinement, he worked at NKVD&#x27;s Central Design Bureau No. 29 (ЦКБ-29 НКВД) in Moscow under the guidance of Vladimir Petlyakov, designing the Pe-2 bomber. In 1940, after his release, Myasishchev headed a design bureau (in the same building), working on the long-range high-altitude bomber DVB-102 (ДВБ-102). In 1946–1951, Myasishchev was the head of the faculty and later dean of the Department of Aircraft Design at Moscow Aviation Institute. In 1956, he became chief aircraft designer. In 1960–1967, Myasishchev was appointed Head of the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute (TsAGI). In 1967–1978, Myasishchev held a post of the chief aircraft designer of the Experimental Machine Building Plant, which would bear his name starting 1981.

Myasishchev designed different kinds of military aircraft, including Pe-2B, Pe-2I, Pe-2M, DIS, DB-108, M-4, 3M, M-50. He also worked on a cargo aircraft VM-T Atlant and high-altitude airplane M-17 Stratosphera. Among Myasishchev&#x27;s aeroplane designs, the 3M and M-4 set nineteen world records, and the M-17 &quot;Stratosphera&quot; twenty.

Myasishchev was awarded Hero of Socialist Labour gold star (in 1957), three Orders of Lenin (in 1945, 1957, 1962), the Order of Suvorov II degree (in 1944), the Order of the October Revolution (in 1971), medals.

Myasishchev&#x27;s mother was of Polish nationality, a daughter of Poles exiled to Siberia.

== Family ==
1927 — He married Elena Alexandrovna Spendiarova (1905-1981), the daughter of the Armenian composer Alexander Afanasyevich Spendiaryan.

1930 — They had a daughter Maria.

Granddaughter — Daria Myasishcheva (the common-law wife and mother of the children of Russian actor Pavel Derevyanko).

<text>Juan Carlos Aramburu (February 11, 1912 – November 18, 2004) was the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Buenos Aires, Argentina, from 1975 to 1990, and was named to the College of Cardinals by Pope Paul VI in 1976.

==Biography==
Aramburu was born in rural Reducción, in the Province of Córdoba, Argentina. He was ordained a priest in 1934 and became a bishop in 1946, serving successively as auxiliary bishop, diocesan bishop (from 1953), and first archbishop (from 1957) of Tucumán. He created ten new parishes and built chapels in this diocese, as well as a House of Spiritual Exercises. His intense pastoral work included giving the Confirmation to more than 1,000 people in one day.

In 1967 he was named coadjutor archbishop of Buenos Aires, and on April 22, 1975, he was installed as archbishop, succeeding Antonio Caggiano. He was elevated to cardinal one year later, on May 24, 1976.

Aramburu was the second youngest bishop in the history of the Argentine Church, and served for 70 years of priesthood, during which he consecrated ten bishops. At his death, he was the senior bishop by date of consecration in the entire Catholic Church. Active in retirement, he suffered a fatal cardiac failure as he prepared to hear confessions at the Shrine of San Cayetano.

==Collaboration with National Reorganization Process==
The year of Aramburu&#x27;s elevation to cardinal coincided with the beginning of the National Reorganization Process. The Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, a group looking for information on their children who suffered forced disappearance, wrote to top members of the ecclesiastical hierarchy for help, including Aramburu, but it did not get any response. Also, Aramburu did not denounce the murder of bishop Enrique Angelelli, conducted by a military task force and disguised as a road accident; instead, he claimed that there was no evidence of it being a crime.

In 1982, during a trip to Italy, Aramburu was interviewed by the Roman newspaper &quot;Il Messaggero&quot; and replied to a question about forced disappearances saying: &quot;I don&#x27;t understand how this question of guerrillas and terrorism has come up again; it&#x27;s been over for a long time.&quot; On the issue of common graves with unidentified bodies being discovered, he claimed: &quot;In Argentina there are no common graves. ... Everything was recorded in the regular fashion in the books. The common graves belong to people who died without the authorities being able to identify them. Disappeared? Let&#x27;s not confuse things. You know that there are &#x27;disappeared people&#x27; who live quietly in Europe.&quot;

In 2002, an organization composed of children of disappeared people organized a protest to accuse Aramburu of collaborationism with the National Reorganization Process. The Argentine Episcopal Conference released a document in defense of Aramburu. Rubén Capitanio, a priest, sent a critical letter to the Conference where he mentioned, among other things, that Aramburu had given Holy Communion to people &quot;that [he] knew were responsible of horrible public crimes&quot; and that he had overlooked the human rights abuses at the Navy Mechanics School, within his jurisdiction.

<doc id="1188103" wikidata="Q4938345" url="?curid=1188103" title="Boiler room (business)">
<text>In business, a boiler room is an outbound call center selling questionable investments by telephone. It usually refers to a room where salespeople work using unfair, dishonest sales tactics, sometimes selling penny stocks or private placements or committing outright stock fraud. A common boiler room tactic is the use of falsified and bolstered information in combination with verified company-released information. The term is pejorative: it is often used to imply high-pressure sales tactics and, sometimes, poor working conditions.

==Business structure==

The classic image of a boiler room is that it has an undisclosed relationship with the companies it promotes, or an undisclosed profit motive for promoting those companies.
Once the insider investors are in place, a boiler room promotes (by telephone calls to brokerage clients or spam email) these thinly traded stocks (i.e. stocks that are not purchased or sold very often) where there is no actual market. The brokers of the boiler room actually &quot;create&quot; a market by attracting buyers, whose demand for the stock drives up the price; this gives the owners of the company enough volume to sell their shares at a profit, a form of pump and dump operation where the original investors profit at the expense of the investors taken in by the boiler room operation.

In the 20th century, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission described boiler rooms as follows:

Some traits of a boiler room include presenting only good news about the stock to be sold, and discouraging outside research by customers or brokers working there. The &quot;International Journal of Law, Crime and Justice&quot; states that:

==Etymology==
The term might have originated from the cheap, hastily arranged office space used by such firms, often just a few desks in the basement or utility room of an existing office building, with the &quot;heat&quot; and &quot;pressure&quot; of close quarters, and fast-paced sales tactics analogous to the conditions in a boiler and, in the former case, its surrounding room.

In the early 1970s (and possibly earlier), &quot;boiler room&quot; was a term used by political parties for a room with many telephones used to call prospective voters.

In 1968, Senator Robert F. Kennedy had six women working for him as the &quot;Boiler Room Girls&quot;, as they were known, and whose fame grew as a result of the death of Mary Jo Kopechne in 1969.

==Modern boiler rooms==

In the late 1960s to the 1980s, boiler rooms sold municipal bonds to unsophisticated investors. These boiler rooms were located primarily in the southeastern United States, most notably Memphis, Tennessee and later Little Rock, Arkansas. The operators got the nickname &quot;Bond Daddies.&quot; The operators would sell the bonds at inflated prices, substitute different bonds, mislead investors about the risks, or fail to deliver the bonds to the investor.

In the 1990s, organized crime in New York City became involved in microcap stock fraud using boiler rooms.

Although many disappeared in the 1990s following the burst of the &quot;dot-com bubble&quot;, many boiler rooms still operate across the world. Reductions in telecommunication costs mean that a company can viably operate in one country while calling prospective investors in another. The advantage of such an operation is that a company can operate without fear of prosecution from the investor&#x27;s native legal system. For example, many boiler rooms contacting prospective investors in the United Kingdom operate from Spanish cities such as Barcelona and Valencia.

A boiler room operation is well exemplified by the case of Fort Lauderdale-based company First Resource Group LLC, charged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission with conducting a fraudulent boiler room scheme in 2012. According to the SEC, First Resource (and the company&#x27;s founder, David H. Stern) used a telephone sales boiler room to make inflated claims and defraud investors while simultaneously manipulating the price of the stocks and making profits for themselves.

With the advent of the internet and the ability to create web sites easily without any regulatory involvement, as well as the ability to operate from other jurisdictions, boiler rooms have continued to operate into the 21st century. It is easy for scammers to set up a web site in one country, operate from another country and target victims in a third country, hiding their identity and making it difficult to trace them. Financial regulation varies significantly from country to country, and some countries deliberately promote low regulatory environments in order to attract financial business. This makes it easy for boiler rooms to use this to their advantage. Financial regulatory authorities in each country have significant difficulty enforcing rules on scammers in other countries. With low financial literacy by investors or victims (particularly in the increasingly complex ways that global financial markets operate), and without better coordination between financial regulators in different countries, boiler rooms continue to operate.

===Gold Coast boiler room scams===
The Gold Coast has been described by investigators as the capital of investment fraud in Australia, with numerous boiler room operators selling bogus investment and sports betting schemes to Australian and overseas customers. The Australian Crime Commission estimates Australians had lost at least AU$113 million up to 2012.

Operators of the scams buy old shelf companies with no complaint history to give the appearance they&#x27;ve been trading legitimately for long periods. When complaints cause reputation problems they close the company and start anew. Virtual offices, fake receptionists and fake testimonials are used, and telemarketers cold call victims with misleading claims of high returns. Victims say the betting and investment software does not work and they lost their money when the companies suddenly closed.
In 2011, private investigator, Ken Gamble, acting on behalf of groups of victims, provided evidence of millions of dollars&#x27; worth of fraud to the Queensland Police Service, but says the fraud squad failed to investigate. In late 2014 it was announced Queensland&#x27;s Crime and Corruption Commission had taken over investigation of several Gold Coast boiler room scams due to allegations fraudsters were receiving police protection.

==In popular culture==
A fictional &quot;boiler room&quot; brokerage firm was dramatized in the 2000 film &quot;Boiler Room&quot;, and the play and 1992 film &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot; show a similar boiler room operation selling real estate.

Season two of the HBO show &quot;The Sopranos&quot; depicts a pump and dump scheme being operated out of a boiler room by associates of the fictional DiMeo crime family. 

The 2013 film &quot;The Wolf of Wall Street&quot;, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, also involves a boiler-room investment business and is based on the memoir of convicted penny stock fraudster Jordan Belfort, whose Stratton Oakmont brokerage house operated as a boiler room. A 2010 episode of the television series &quot;White Collar&quot; depicted fictional conman Neal Caffrey infiltrating a group of corrupt brokers also peddling inflated penny stocks.

== Victims ==
Individuals will be targeted through the use of mediums such as the sucker list which discloses information about those who have fallen victim to scams in the past. Another avenue, and one that is not as accessible due to its shielded nature, is the utilization of shareholder lists. These lists provide information that links the employees of the boiler room businesses to the people most susceptible to fraud.

=== Victim support ===
The Office for Victims of Crime offers monetary aid to victims of crimes throughout the United States. These funds come directly from the &quot;federal offenders&quot; as well as from private donations and gifts. In addition to this, it &quot;raises awareness about victims&#x27; issues, promotes compliance with victims&#x27; rights laws, and provides training and technical assistance and publications and products to victim assistance professionals.&quot; It also links victims to The United States Department of Justice Victim Notification System, which was developed to maintain victims informed of case activity. Victims may register online to receive notifications regarding their relevant case.

=== Emotional impact ===
Impacts of fraudulent boiler room business range from financial loss to decline in mental health and stability. Victims often suffer from stress, anxiety, loss of self-esteem, and depression. This decline in health and financial wealth has reportedly been linked to marriage dissolution as well as thoughts of suicide, and attempts of suicide. Victims also exhibited changes in behavior that included wariness of others and of financial transactions. On the other hand, many victims became more aware of the importance of security and as such took preventative action for the future.

<doc id="1188104" wikidata="Q2566926" url="?curid=1188104" title="Old quantum theory">
<text>The old quantum theory is a collection of results from the years 1900–1925 which predate modern quantum mechanics. The theory was never complete or self-consistent, but was instead a set of heuristic corrections to classical mechanics. The theory has come to be understood as the semi-classical approximation to modern quantum mechanics. The main and final accomplishments of the old quantum theory were the determination of the modern form of the periodic table by Edmund Stoner and the Pauli exclusion principle, both of which were premised on Arnold Sommerfeld&#x27;s enhancements to the Bohr model of the atom.

The main tool of the old quantum theory was the Bohr–Sommerfeld quantization condition, a procedure for selection of certain allowed states of a classical system: the system can then only exist in one of the allowed states and not in any other state.

== History ==

The old quantum theory was instigated by the 1900 work of Max Planck on the emission and absorption of light in a black body with his discovery of Planck&#x27;s law introducing his quantum of action, and began in earnest after the work of Albert Einstein on the specific heats of solids in 1907 brought him to the attention of Walther Nernst. Einstein, followed by Debye, applied quantum principles to the motion of atoms, explaining the specific heat anomaly.

In 1910, Arthur Erich Haas further developed J. J. Thomson&#x27;s atomic model in a paper that outlined a treatment of the hydrogen atom involving quantization of electronic orbitals, thus anticipating the Bohr model (1913) by three years.

John William Nicholson is noted as the first to create an atomic model that quantized angular momentum as formula_1. Niels Bohr quoted him in his 1913 paper of the Bohr model of the atom.

In 1913, Niels Bohr displayed rudiments of the later defined correspondence principle and used it to formulate a model of the hydrogen atom which explained the line spectrum. In the next few years Arnold Sommerfeld extended the quantum rule to arbitrary integrable systems making use of the principle of adiabatic invariance of the quantum numbers introduced by Lorentz and Einstein. Sommerfeld made a crucial contribution by quantizing the z-component of the angular momentum, which in the old quantum era was called &quot;space quantization&quot; (German: &quot;Richtungsquantelung&quot;). This model, which became known as the Bohr–Sommerfeld model, allowed the orbits of the electron to be ellipses instead of circles, and introduced the concept of quantum degeneracy. The theory would have correctly explained the Zeeman effect, except for the issue of electron spin. Sommerfeld&#x27;s model was much closer to the modern quantum mechanical picture than Bohr&#x27;s.

Throughout the 1910s and well into the 1920s, many problems were attacked using the old quantum theory with mixed results. Molecular rotation and vibration spectra were understood and the electron&#x27;s spin was discovered, leading to the confusion of half-integer quantum numbers. Max Planck introduced the zero point energy and Arnold Sommerfeld semiclassically quantized the relativistic hydrogen atom. Hendrik Kramers explained the Stark effect. Bose and Einstein gave the correct quantum statistics for photons.

Kramers gave a prescription for calculating transition probabilities between quantum states in terms of Fourier components of the motion, ideas which were extended in collaboration with Werner Heisenberg to a semiclassical matrix-like description of atomic transition probabilities. Heisenberg went on to reformulate all of quantum theory in terms of a version of these transition matrices, creating matrix mechanics.

In 1924, Louis de Broglie introduced the wave theory of matter, which was extended to a semiclassical equation for matter waves by Albert Einstein a short time later. In 1926 Erwin Schrödinger found a completely quantum mechanical wave-equation, which reproduced all the successes of the old quantum theory without ambiguities and inconsistencies. Schrödinger&#x27;s wave mechanics developed separately from matrix mechanics until Schrödinger and others proved that the two methods predicted the same experimental consequences. Paul Dirac later proved in 1926 that both methods can be obtained from a more general method called transformation theory.

In the 1950s Joseph Keller updated Bohr–Sommerfeld quantization using Einstein&#x27;s interpretation of 1917, now known as Einstein–Brillouin–Keller method. In 1971, Martin Gutzwiller took into account that this method only works for integrable systems and derived a semiclassical way of quantizing chaotic systems from path integrals.

== Basic principles ==

The basic idea of the old quantum theory is that the motion in an atomic system is quantized, or discrete. The system obeys classical mechanics except that not every motion is allowed, only those motions which obey the &quot;quantization condition&quot;:

:formula_2

where the formula_3 are the momenta of the system and the formula_4 are the corresponding coordinates. The quantum numbers formula_5 are &quot;integers&quot; and the integral is taken over one period of the motion at constant energy (as described by the Hamiltonian). The integral is an area in phase space, which is a quantity called the action and is quantized in units of the (unreduced) Planck constant. For this reason, the Planck constant was often called the &quot;quantum of action&quot;.

In order for the old quantum condition to make sense, the classical motion must be separable, meaning that there are separate coordinates formula_4 in terms of which the motion is periodic. The periods of the different motions do not have to be the same, they can even be incommensurate, but there must be a set of coordinates where the motion decomposes in a multi-periodic way.

The motivation for the old quantum condition was the correspondence principle, complemented by the physical observation that the quantities which are quantized must be adiabatic invariants. Given Planck&#x27;s quantization rule for the harmonic oscillator, either condition determines the correct classical quantity to quantize in a general system up to an additive constant.

This quantization condition is often known as the &quot;Wilson–Sommerfeld rule&quot;, proposed independently by William Wilson and Arnold Sommerfeld.

== Examples ==

=== Thermal properties of the harmonic oscillator ===
The simplest system in the old quantum theory is the harmonic oscillator, whose Hamiltonian is:
: formula_7

The old quantum theory yields a recipe for the quantization of the energy levels of the harmonic oscillator, which, when combined with the Boltzmann probability distribution of thermodynamics, yields the correct expression for the stored energy and specific heat of a quantum oscillator both at low and at ordinary temperatures. Applied as a model for the specific heat of solids, this resolved a discrepancy in pre-quantum thermodynamics that had troubled 19th-century scientists. Let us now describe this.

The level sets of &quot;H&quot; are the orbits, and the quantum condition is that the area enclosed by an orbit in phase space is an integer. It follows that the energy is quantized according to the Planck rule:
: formula_8
a result which was known well before, and used to formulate the old quantum condition. This result differs by formula_9 from the results found with the help of quantum mechanics. This constant is neglected in the derivation of the &quot;old quantum theory&quot;, and its value cannot be determined using it.

The thermal properties of a quantized oscillator may be found by averaging the energy in each of the discrete states assuming that they are occupied with a Boltzmann weight:
: formula_10

&quot;kT&quot; is Boltzmann constant times the absolute temperature, which is the temperature as measured in more natural units of energy. The quantity formula_11 is more fundamental in thermodynamics than the temperature, because it is the thermodynamic potential associated to the energy.

From this expression, it is easy to see that for large values of formula_11, for very low temperatures, the average energy &quot;U&quot; in the harmonic oscillator approaches zero very quickly, exponentially fast. The reason is that &quot;kT&quot; is the typical energy of random motion at temperature &quot;T&quot;, and when this is smaller than formula_13, there is not enough energy to give the oscillator even one quantum of energy. So the oscillator stays in its ground state, storing next to no energy at all.

This means that at very cold temperatures, the change in energy with respect to beta, or equivalently the change in energy with respect to temperature, is also exponentially small. The change in energy with respect to temperature is the specific heat, so the specific heat is exponentially small at low temperatures, going to zero like
: formula_14

At small values of formula_11, at high temperatures, the average energy &quot;U&quot; is equal to formula_16. This reproduces the equipartition theorem of classical thermodynamics: every harmonic oscillator at temperature &quot;T&quot; has energy &quot;kT&quot; on average. This means that the specific heat of an oscillator is constant in classical mechanics and equal to &quot;k&quot;. For a collection of atoms connected by springs, a reasonable model of a solid, the total specific heat is equal to the total number of oscillators times &quot;k&quot;. There are overall three oscillators for each atom, corresponding to the three possible directions of independent oscillations in three dimensions. So the specific heat of a classical solid is always 3&quot;k&quot; per atom, or in chemistry units, 3&quot;R&quot; per mole of atoms.

Monatomic solids at room temperatures have approximately the same specific heat of 3&quot;k&quot; per atom, but at low temperatures they don&#x27;t. The specific heat is smaller at colder temperatures, and it goes to zero at absolute zero. This is true for all material systems, and this observation is called the third law of thermodynamics. Classical mechanics cannot explain the third law, because in classical mechanics the specific heat is independent of the temperature.

This contradiction between classical mechanics and the specific heat of cold materials was noted by James Clerk Maxwell in the 19th century, and remained a deep puzzle for those who advocated an atomic theory of matter. Einstein resolved this problem in 1906 by proposing that atomic motion is quantized. This was the first application of quantum theory to mechanical systems. A short while later, Peter Debye gave a quantitative theory of solid specific heats in terms of quantized oscillators with various frequencies (see Einstein solid and Debye model).

=== One-dimensional potential: &quot;U&quot; = 0 ===
One-dimensional problems are easy to solve. At any energy &quot;E&quot;, the value of the momentum &quot;p&quot; is found from the conservation equation:
: formula_17
which is integrated over all values of &quot;q&quot; between the classical &quot;turning points&quot;, the places where the momentum vanishes. The integral is easiest for a &quot;particle in a box&quot; of length &quot;L&quot;, where the quantum condition is:
: formula_18
which gives the allowed momenta:
: formula_19
and the energy levels
: formula_20

=== One-dimensional potential: &quot;U&quot; = &quot;Fx&quot; ===

Another easy case to solve with the old quantum theory is a linear potential on the positive halfline, the constant confining force &quot;F&quot; binding a particle to an impenetrable wall. This case is much more difficult in the full quantum mechanical treatment, and unlike the other examples, the semiclassical answer here is not exact but approximate, becoming more accurate at large quantum numbers.
: formula_21
so that the quantum condition is
: formula_22
which determines the energy levels,
: formula_23

In the specific case F=mg, the particle is confined by the gravitational potential of the earth and the &quot;wall&quot; here is the surface of the earth.

=== One-dimensional potential: &quot;U&quot; = &quot;kx&quot;2 ===

This case is also easy to solve, and the semiclassical answer here agrees with the quantum one to within the ground-state energy. Its quantization-condition integral is
: formula_24
with solution
: formula_25
for oscillation angular frequency formula_26, as before.

=== Rotator ===
Another simple system is the rotator. A rotator consists of a mass &quot;M&quot; at the end of a massless rigid rod of length &quot;R&quot; and in two dimensions has the Lagrangian:
: formula_27
which determines that the angular momentum &quot;J&quot; conjugate to formula_28, the polar angle, formula_29. The old quantum condition requires that &quot;J&quot; multiplied by the period of formula_28 is an integer multiple of the Planck constant:
: formula_31
the angular momentum to be an integer multiple of formula_32. In the Bohr model, this restriction imposed on circular orbits was enough to determine the energy levels.

In three dimensions, a rigid rotator can be described by two angles — formula_28 and formula_34, where formula_28 is the inclination relative to an arbitrarily chosen &quot;z&quot;-axis while formula_34 is the rotator angle in the projection to the &quot;x&quot;–&quot;y&quot; plane. The kinetic energy is again the only contribution to the Lagrangian:
: formula_37

And the conjugate momenta are formula_38 and formula_39. The equation of motion for formula_34 is trivial: formula_41 is a constant:
: formula_42
which is the &quot;z&quot;-component of the angular momentum. The quantum condition demands that the integral of the constant formula_43 as formula_34 varies from 0 to formula_45 is an integer multiple of &quot;h&quot;:
: formula_46

And &quot;m&quot; is called the magnetic quantum number, because the &quot;z&quot; component of the angular momentum is the magnetic moment of the rotator along the &quot;z&quot; direction in the case where the particle at the end of the rotator is charged.

Since the three-dimensional rotator is rotating about an axis, the total angular momentum should be restricted in the same way as the two-dimensional rotator. The two quantum conditions restrict the total angular momentum and the &quot;z&quot;-component of the angular momentum to be the integers &quot;l&quot;,&quot;m&quot;. This condition is reproduced in modern quantum mechanics, but in the era of the old quantum theory it led to a paradox: how can the orientation of the angular momentum relative to the arbitrarily chosen &quot;z&quot;-axis be quantized? This seems to pick out a direction in space.

This phenomenon, the quantization of angular momentum about an axis, was given the name &quot;space quantization&quot;, because it seemed incompatible with rotational invariance. In modern quantum mechanics, the angular momentum is quantized the same way, but the discrete states of definite angular momentum in any one orientation are quantum superpositions of the states in other orientations, so that the process of quantization does not pick out a preferred axis. For this reason, the name &quot;space quantization&quot; fell out of favor, and the same phenomenon is now called the quantization of angular momentum.

=== Hydrogen atom ===
The angular part of the hydrogen atom is just the rotator, and gives the quantum numbers &quot;l&quot; and &quot;m&quot;. The only remaining variable is the radial coordinate, which executes a periodic one-dimensional potential motion, which can be solved.

For a fixed value of the total angular momentum &quot;L&quot;, the Hamiltonian for a classical Kepler problem is (the unit of mass and unit of energy redefined to absorb two constants):
: formula_47

Fixing the energy to be (a negative) constant and solving for the radial momentum formula_48, the quantum condition integral is:
: formula_49
which can be solved with the method of residues, and gives a new quantum number formula_50 which determines the energy in combination with formula_51. The energy is:
: formula_52
and it only depends on the sum of &quot;k&quot; and &quot;l&quot;, which is the &quot;principal quantum number&quot; &quot;n&quot;. Since &quot;k&quot; is positive, the allowed values of &quot;l&quot; for any given &quot;n&quot; are no bigger than &quot;n&quot;. The energies reproduce those in the Bohr model, except with the correct quantum mechanical multiplicities, with some ambiguity at the extreme values.

== De Broglie waves ==

In 1905, Einstein noted that the entropy of the quantized electromagnetic field oscillators in a box is, for short wavelength, equal to the entropy of a gas of point particles in the same box. The number of point particles is equal to the number of quanta. Einstein concluded that the quanta could be treated as if they were localizable objects 
(see page 139/140), particles of light. Today we call them photons (a name coined by Gilbert N. Lewis in a letter to &quot;Nature&quot;.)

Einstein&#x27;s theoretical argument was based on thermodynamics, on counting the number of states, and so was not completely convincing. Nevertheless, he concluded that light had attributes of both waves and particles, more precisely that an electromagnetic standing wave with frequency formula_26 with the quantized energy:
: formula_54
should be thought of as consisting of n photons each with an energy formula_13. Einstein could not describe how the photons were related to the wave.

The photons have momentum as well as energy, and the momentum had to be formula_56 where formula_50 is the wavenumber of the electromagnetic wave. This is required by relativity, because the momentum and energy form a four-vector, as do the frequency and wave-number.

In 1924, as a PhD candidate, Louis de Broglie proposed a new interpretation of the quantum condition. He suggested that all matter, electrons as well as photons, are described by waves obeying the relations.
: formula_58
or, expressed in terms of wavelength formula_59 instead,
: formula_60

He then noted that the quantum condition:
: formula_61

counts the change in phase for the wave as it travels along the classical orbit, and requires that it be an integer multiple of formula_45. Expressed in wavelengths, the number of wavelengths along a classical orbit must be an integer. This is the condition for constructive interference, and it explained the reason for quantized orbits—the matter waves make standing waves only at discrete frequencies, at discrete energies.

For example, for a particle confined in a box, a standing wave must fit an integer number of wavelengths between twice the distance between the walls. The condition becomes:
: formula_63
so that the quantized momenta are:
: formula_64
reproducing the old quantum energy levels.

This development was given a more mathematical form by Einstein, who noted that the phase function for the waves, formula_65, in a mechanical system should be identified with the solution to the Hamilton–Jacobi equation, an equation which William Rowan Hamilton believed to be a short-wavelength limit of a sort of wave mechanics in the 19th century. Schrödinger then found the proper wave equation which matched the Hamilton–Jacobi equation for the phase; this is now known as the Schrödinger equation.

== Kramers transition matrix ==
The old quantum theory was formulated only for special mechanical systems which could be separated into action angle variables which were periodic. It did not deal with the emission and absorption of radiation. Nevertheless, Hendrik Kramers was able to find heuristics for describing how emission and absorption should be calculated.

Kramers suggested that the orbits of a quantum system should be Fourier analyzed, decomposed into harmonics at multiples of the orbit frequency:
: formula_66

The index &quot;n&quot; describes the quantum numbers of the orbit, it would be &quot;n&quot;–&quot;l&quot;–&quot;m&quot; in the Sommerfeld model. The frequency formula_26 is the angular frequency of the orbit formula_68 while &quot;k&quot; is an index for the Fourier mode. Bohr had suggested that the &quot;k&quot;-th harmonic of the classical motion correspond to the transition from level &quot;n&quot; to level &quot;n&quot;−&quot;k&quot;.

Kramers proposed that the transition between states were analogous to classical emission of radiation, which happens at frequencies at multiples of the orbit frequencies. The rate of emission of radiation is proportional to formula_69, as it would be in classical mechanics. The description was approximate, since the Fourier components did not have frequencies that exactly match the energy spacings between levels.

This idea led to the development of matrix mechanics.

== Limitations ==
The old quantum theory had some limitations:
* The old quantum theory provides no means to calculate the intensities of the spectral lines.
* It fails to explain the anomalous Zeeman effect (that is, where the spin of the electron cannot be neglected).
* It cannot quantize &quot;chaotic&quot; systems, i.e. dynamical systems in which trajectories are neither closed nor periodic and whose analytical form does not exist. This presents a problem for systems as simple as a 2-electron atom which is classically chaotic analogously to the famous gravitational three-body problem.
However it can be used to describe atoms with more than one electron (e.g. Helium) and the Zeeman effect. 
It was later proposed that the old quantum theory is in fact the semi-classical approximation to the canonical quantum mechanics but its limitations are still under investigation.

<text>Stanley Frederick Webb (born 3 February 1946) is an English musician who is the frontman and lead guitarist with the blues band Chicken Shack.

==Career==
Webb was born in Fulham, South West London. Initially playing in skiffle bands, Webb formed the first version of the blues band Chicken Shack with bassist Andy Silvester in 1965. The band played in Hamburg, Germany over the next couple of years. They signed to the Blue Horizon record label in 1967, where their label mates were the fledgling Fleetwood Mac. The group was then composed of Webb, Christine Perfect, drummer Dave Bidwell, and bassist Andy Silvester. Bidwell and Silvester would later become the rhythm section of the British blues ensemble, Savoy Brown. Webb also joined Savoy Brown for their album &quot;Boogie Brothers&quot;. Perfect later joined Fleetwood Mac becoming Christine McVie after her marriage to the band&#x27;s bassist, John McVie.

Chicken Shack enjoyed their heyday in the mid to late 1960s, when R&amp;B was popular in England. Chicken Shack&#x27;s line-up has evolved over the years, with Webb being the only constant. Their music was traditional in make-up, and the group covered a variety of American blues standards, as well as composing their own songs. Their repertoire included &quot;I&#x27;d Rather Go Blind&quot; by Ellington Jordan and Billy Foster. Christine Perfect was the lead singer. This song was originally recorded by Etta James.

In 2001, Webb released his first solo album in over eight years when &quot;Webb&quot; appeared on the Indigo Records label.

<text>The Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra (Sanskrit; , ; Vietnamese: &quot;Kinh Đại Bát Niết Bàn&quot;) or Nirvana Sutra for short, is an influential Mahāyāna Buddhist scripture of the Buddha-nature class. The original title of the sutra was Mahāparinirvāṇamahāsūtra (&quot;Great Scripture of the Great Perfect Nirvāṇa&quot;) and the earliest version of the text was associated with the Mahāsāṃghika-Lokottaravāda school. The sutra was particularly important for the development of East Asian Buddhism.

The &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot; uses the backdrop of the Buddha&#x27;s final nirvana to discuss the nature of the Buddha, who is described in this sutra as undying and eternal, without beginning or end. The text also discusses the associated doctrine of buddha-nature (tathāgatagarbha) which is said to be a &quot;hidden treasury&quot; within all living beings that is eternal (nitya), blissful, Self (atman), and pure (shudda). Due to this buddha nature, all beings have the capacity to reach Buddhahood. Some scholars like Michael Radich and Shimoda Masahiro think that the &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot; might be the earliest source for the idea of buddha-nature. 

The &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot; also discusses the teachings of not-self and emptiness, and how they are incomplete unless they are complemented by the teaching of &quot;non-emptiness&quot; and the true self, which is buddha-nature. Furthermore, the &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot; discusses the idea of the icchantikas, a class of sentient beings who &quot;have little or no chance of liberation.&quot; The icchantika idea is discussed in various ways throughout the different versions of the sutra, and the issue is complex, though as Blum writes the Nirvana sutra seems &quot;ambivalent on whether or not icchantikas can attain buddhahood&quot;.

The &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot;&#x27;s precise date of origin is uncertain, but its early form may have developed in or by the second century CE. The original Sanskrit text is not extant except for a small number of fragments, but it survives in Chinese and Tibetan translation. The &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot; was translated into Chinese various times. The most important editions are the 416 CE &quot;six fascicle text&quot; and the 421 CE translation of Dharmakṣema, which is about four times longer than the earlier one. This sutra should not be confused with the early Buddhist &quot;Mahāparinibbāna Sutta&quot; which is not a Mahayana sutra.

==History==
===Origins===

The history of the text is extremely complex, but the consensus view is that the core portion of this sutra was compiled in South India (dakṣiṇāpatha), possibly in Andhra or some part of the Deccan.

The language used in the sūtra and related texts seems to indicate a region in southern India during the time of the Śātavāhana dynasty, likely the 2nd century CE. The Śātavāhana rulers gave rich patronage to Buddhism, and were involved with the development of the cave temples at Karla and Ajaṇṭā, and also with the Great Amarāvati Stupa. During this time, the Śātavāhana dynasty also maintained extensive links with the Kuṣāṇa Empire. Hodge argues that it is likely that the text was composed &quot;in a Mahāsāṃghika environment&quot; like Karli or Amaravatī-Dhanyakaṭaka. Hiromi Habata likewise associated the sutra with the Mahāsāṃghika-Lokottaravāda school.

According to Stephen Hodge, internal textual evidence in the &quot;Aṅgulimālīya Sūtra&quot;, &quot;Mahābheri Sūtra&quot;, and the &quot;Nirvāṇa&quot; indicates that these texts initially circulated in South India, but then gradually began to be propagated in the northwest (especially in Kashmir). Hodge notes that the &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot; contains prophesies of its own emergence during a period of Dharma decline (which can be calculated to be in around 220 CE) along with prophesies that the text will be taken to Kashmir (罽賓). Hodge also discusses an important person named Sarvasattvapriyadarśana who appears in a group of texts related to the Nirvana sutra like the &quot;Aṅgulimāla&quot; and the &quot;Lotus sutra&quot; (he is also called Sarvalokapriyadarśana in the &quot;Mahāmegha&quot; and &quot;Mahābherīhāraka&quot;). This figure is connected with the teaching of the eternity of the Buddha and is said to have been born during the a Śātavāhana king (a prophesy placed in the mouth of the Buddha himself in some sources). According to Hodge, Sarvasattvapriyadarśana may have been a historical figure connected to the Nirvana sutra lineage (even its founder) in south India. After the situation in the south became unfavorable for this tradition, it was taken to Kashmir, where later parts of the text were written, reflecting the decline narrative of some parts of the text.

Shimoda Masahiro proposes that the earliest part of the &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot; is related to the views and practices of itinerant dharma preachers called dharmakathikas or dharmabhāṇakas (說法者 or 法師). These figures frequently went on pilgrimage to stūpa sites in the company of laypeople who were allowed to protect them with swords and staves. They may have also believed in the eternal nature of the Buddha and his vajra body. According to Shimoda, the authors of the &quot;Nirvana sutra,&quot; as advocates of stupa worship, would have known how the term &quot;buddhadhātu&quot; originally referred to śarīra or physical relics of the Buddha. According to Shimoda&#x27;s theory, these figures used the teachings of the &quot;Tathāgatagarbha Sūtra&quot; to reshape the worship of the śarīra into worship of the inner Buddha as a principle of salvation: the Buddha-nature. Sasaki states that a key premise of Shimoda&#x27;s work is that the origins of Mahayana and the &quot;Mahāparinirvāṇa&quot; are entwined.

Scholars like Shimoda as well as Michael Radich argue that the &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot; might be the earliest source for the tathāgatagarbha doctrine. 

===Dating===
Scholars believe that the compilation of the core portion (corresponding to the six fascicle Chinese translation and the shorter Tibetan translation) must have occurred at an early date, during or prior to the 2nd century CE, based internal evidence and on Chinese canonical catalogs.

Using textual evidence in the &quot;Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra&quot; and related texts, Stephen Hodge estimates a compilation period between 100 CE and 220 CE for the core sutra.

The Indian version of the &quot;Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra&quot; underwent a number of stages in its composition. Masahiro Shimoda discerns several main stages: 
# a short proto-&quot;Nirvāṇa Sūtra&quot;, which was, he argues, probably not distinctively Mahāyāna, but quasi-Mahāsāṃghika in origin and would date to 100 CE, if not even earlier;
# an expanded version of this core text was then developed and would have comprised chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7 of the six fascicle text and shorter Tibetan versions, though it is believed that in their present state there is a degree of editorial addition in them from the later phases of development.
# Chapter 8 of the six fascicle text.
# Ch. 5, and Ch. 9 onwards of the six fascicle text.

=== In East Asia ===

The &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot; is an extremely influential work for East-Asian Buddhism. It was translated various times and two major Chinese translations are extant. The translation by Dharmakṣema (c. 385–433) is significantly longer and this has led some scholars to argue that the latter portions of this edition were composed in China. This longer edition was also the most important and popular one in China, Japan and Korea, since it promoted the universality of Buddha nature and Buddhahood. The six fascicle version on the other hand was mostly ignored according to Blum.

Dharmakṣema&#x27;s &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot; inspired numerous sutra commentaries and is cited widely by numerous East Asian Buddhist authors. The sutra was a key scriptural source for the idea that all sentient beings have buddha-nature, which was seen as an active force in the world. It was also influential due to its teachings promoting vegetarianism and its teachings on the eternal nature of the Buddha. All these doctrines became central teachings of Chinese Buddhism.

In the Southern Dynasties (420-589) period, there was a Chinese Buddhist school devoted to the Dharmakṣema &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot;, which was simply called the &quot;Nirvana School&quot; (&quot;nièpán-zong&quot;) and was also influenced by the works of Daosheng. This school taught the universality of Buddha nature and the capacity for even icchantikas to attain Buddhahood. The school thrived in the Liang dynasty (502-557) and many of its teachings were incorporated into the Tiantai school. During the Liang, the school&#x27;s teachings were supplemented by the teachings of the &quot;Tattvasiddhi-Śāstra&quot; by scholars like Pao-liang (d. 509).

The &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot; was also seen as a key sutra for both the Tiantai and the Huayan schools, the main doctrinal schools of Chinese Buddhism. The key Tiantai exegete Zhiyi even saw the sutra as a final teaching of the Buddha and as being of equal status to the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;.

Due to its status in these doctrinal traditions, it also became important for numerous Japanese Buddhist schools like Zen, Nichiren and Shin Buddhism. The work is cited by key Japanese Buddhist figures like Dōgen, Nichiren and Shinran. The &quot;Nirvana Sutra&quot; is among the most important sources and influences on Shinran&#x27;s magnum opus, &quot;Kyogyoshinsho&quot;. Shinran relies on crucial passages from the &quot;Nirvana Sutra&quot; for the more theoretical elaboration of the meaning of shinjin. Similarly, the &quot;Nirvana&quot; is a key source for Dōgen&#x27;s view of buddha-nature.

== Teachings ==
The &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot;&#x27;s setting is the final hours of the Buddha&#x27;s life. Unlike the early Buddhist &quot;Mahaparanibbana sutta,&quot; Ananda, the Buddha&#x27;s attendant, is mostly absent from the &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot; (instead, the main interlocutor is Mañjuśrī). The &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot; also ends with the Buddha lying down, but it does not depict his actual &quot;parinirvāṇa,&quot; nor does it depict the cremation, and other episodes after his death, like the division of relics and Mahakasyapa paying respect to his body etc.

According to Sallie B. King, the &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot; is somewhat unsystematic and this made it a fruitful sutra for later commentators who drew on it for various doctrinal and exegetical purposes. King notes that the most important innovation of the &quot;Nirvana&quot; is the linking of the term &quot;buddhadhātu&quot; (buddha-nature) with &quot;tathagatagarbha&quot; (tathagata womb/chamber). The buddha-dhātu (buddha-nature, buddha-element) is presented as a timeless, eternal (nitya) and pure &quot;Self&quot; (ātman). This notion of a buddhist theory of a true self (i.e. a Buddhist ātma-vada) is a radical one which caused much controversy and was interpreted in many different ways.

Other important doctrinal themes in the &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot; include re-interpretations of not-self (anātman) and emptiness (Śūnyatā) as a skillful means that paves the way for the ultimate buddha-nature teachings, the doctrine of the icchantika, the eternal and docetic (lokottara) nature of Shakyamuni Buddha and his adamantine body (vajra-kaya), the promotion of vegetarianism, and a teaching on the decline of the Buddha&#x27;s Dharma.

=== The Eternal Buddha ===

A key teaching found in the &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot; is the eternal nature of the Buddha. Blum notes that the sutra makes it clear that the Buddha is not subject to the processes of birth and death, but abides forever in an undying state. While the Buddha will appear to die (and manifest parinirvāṇa, his final nirvana, the apparent death of his body), he is in fact eternal and immortal, since he was never born, and had no beginning or end. The sutra states:

The body of the Tathāgata is an eternal body (*nityakāya), an indestructible body (*abhedakāya), an adamant body (*vajrakāya); it is not a body sustained by various kinds of food. That is to say, it is the Dharma Body (*dharmakāya). Do not say now that the body of the Tathāgata is soft, can easily be broken, and is the same as that of common mortals. O good man! Know now that for countless billions of kalpas, the body of the Tathāgata has been strong, firm, and indestructible. 

The &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot; thus presents the Buddha as an eternal and transcendent being (lokottara) who is beyond being and non-being and is Thusness &quot;(tathata&quot;), the ultimate reality, the eternal Dharmakāya or &quot;dharma body&quot; (which is equivalent to the buddha-body). The sutra also states that the Buddha&#x27;s body (buddhakaya) is an eternal, unchanging, unimpeded, and indivisible adamantine body (&quot;abhedavajrakāya).&quot; As such, while he &quot;appears&quot; to die, his &quot;transcendent, indestructible mode of being&quot; is something that never truly dies, being uncompounded (asaṃskṛta).&quot;&quot; The &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot; further equates the Dharmakāya with the buddha-nature and states that it has four perfections (&quot;pāramitās&quot;): permanence, bliss, purity, and selfhood.

According to Shimoda and Radich, this theme is the central theme of what is perhaps the earliest textual layer of the &quot;Nirvana sutra.&quot; Radich also notes that the &quot;Nirvana&quot; sutra refers to itself by alternative titles, including &quot;Tathāgataśāśvata-sūtra/Tathāgatanityatva-sūtra,&quot; which indicate the eternity of the Tathāgata. 

A key element of the doctrine of the eternal buddha-body is a kind of Mahayana docetism, the idea that the Buddha&#x27;s physical birth and death on earth was a mere appearance, a conventional show for the sake of helping sentient beings (a doctrine which was already found in the Mahāsāṃghika school).&quot;&quot; According to the &quot;Nirvana sutra,&quot; the Buddha entered nirvāṇa aeons ago (and yet remains actively benefiting beings). As such, the Buddha merely appears to be born, practice the path, achieve nirvana and die in order to be &quot;in accordance with the world&quot; (lokānuvartanā, Ch. &quot;suishun shijian&quot;, 隨順世間) so that people would trust him as a human sage. However, in reality, his nature is eternal and unchanging.&quot;&quot; As the Buddha says in the &quot;Nirvana sutra,&quot; &quot;at times, I show [myself entering into] parinirvāṇa in the Jambudvīpas of a billion worlds, and yet, ultimately, I do not take parinirvāṇa.” 

According to Radich, the tathāgatagarbha idea in the &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot; is closely related to the positive elements of this docetic Buddhology, which refers to the idea that since the Buddha did not have a normal human body (nor did he gestate in a normal womb), he must have had some other transcendent type of body (which requires a transcendent womb, the tathāgata-garbha, &quot;buddha womb&quot;).

===Buddha-nature===
The doctrine of the &quot;buddha-dhātu&quot; (buddha-nature, buddha-element, Chinese: 佛性 &quot;foxing&quot;, Tibetan: &quot;sangs rgyas gyi khams&quot;), which refers to the fundamental nature of the Buddha, is a central teaching of the &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot;. According to the &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot;, &quot;all sentient beings possess buddha-nature without distinction&quot; (Chinese:一切眾生皆有佛性而無差別)&quot;.&quot; According to Sally King, the sutra speaks about Buddha-nature in many different ways. This led Chinese scholars to create a list of types of buddha-nature that could be found in the text.

The &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot; also equates buddha-nature with the term &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; (which is also done by other texts like the &quot;Aṅgulimālīya&quot;, &quot;Mahābherī&quot;, and &quot;Uttaratantra&quot;). According to King, this can be understood as an &quot;embryonic tathāgata&quot; or as the &quot;womb of the tathāgata&quot;. The Chinese typically translated the term as 如來藏 &quot;rúlái zàng&quot; (&quot;tathāgata storehouse,&quot; &quot;tathāgata matrix&quot;, or &quot;tathāgata chamber&quot;). However, according to Mark Blum, Dharmaksema translates &quot;tathāgatagārbha&quot; as or simply &quot;mìzàng,&quot; &quot;tathagata&#x27;s hidden treasury&quot;. This treasury is seen as a wondrous liberating truth that is mysteriously hidden from the view of ordinary people. Blum notes that the two major Chinese versions of the sutra don&#x27;t use the literal Chinese term for embryo or womb, but speak of the &quot;wondrous interior treasure-house of the Buddha&quot; which is always present within all beings. This inner treasure, a pure &quot;buddha-relic&quot; within, is obscured by the negative mental afflictions of each sentient being. Once these negative mental states have been eliminated, however, buddha-nature is said to shine forth unimpededly. 

The &quot;Nirvana sutra&#x27;s&quot; explanation of buddha-nature is multifaceted and complex. Karl Brunnholzl argues that there three main meanings of buddha-nature in the Nirvana sutra: (1) an intrinsic pure nature that merely has to be revealed, (2) a seed or potential that can grow into Buddhahood with the right conditions, (3) the idea that the Mahayana path is open to all&quot;.&quot; The &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot; states that buddha-nature as buddhahood is endowed with the powers and qualities of a buddha is free of any karma or affliction (klesha), transcending the five skandhas and the twelve links of dependent arising&quot;.&quot; However, in order to become true Buddhas, sentient beings need to practice the six pāramitās which actualize their buddha potential into full Buddhahood. This is compared to how milk is made into cream or butter through additional conditions&quot;.&quot; As such, the &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot; criticizes those who think that buddha-nature means that all beings are already full Buddhas and do not need to practice the bodhisattva path&quot;.&quot;

However, other similes in the &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot; contain slightly different characterizations of buddha-nature. For example, one simile compares the buddha nature to a treasure buried under the earth, or a to a gold mine (both which are found in the &quot;Tathāgatagarbhasūtra&quot;, which is cited by name in the &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot;). These similes suggest a more immanent understanding of buddha-nature in which the buddha element is merely something to be revealed&quot;.&quot; Furthermore, other similes reject the idea that buddha-nature abides in sentient beings at all, stating that buddha-nature abides nowhere, like how the sound made by a lute is not located in any part of the lute&quot;.&quot;
The Indic term dhātu was used in early Buddhism to refer to the relics of a Buddha as well as to basic constituents of reality or &quot;raw material&quot; (like the eighteen &quot;dhātus&quot; that make up any personality). The &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot; draws on this term and applies it to the true nature of a Buddha, which is permanent (nitya), pure, blissful and resides within all sentient beings (analogous to how the pure buddha relics were housed inside a stupa)&quot;.&quot; Some scholars like Shimoda and Radich have seen the buddha-nature idea as arising from an internalization of stupa and relic worship. Instead of worshiping relics externally, the buddha-nature teaching turns inward, to the inner buddha relic in all of us. According to Jones, the term &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; could also have referred to &quot;the chamber (garbha) for a Buddha (tathāgata): the space at the center of a stūpa, where lies hidden that which is essential to a Buddha and most precious to the world after his (apparent) departure from it.&quot; The term “chamber for a relic” (dhātugarbha) is attested in many Buddhist texts. Due to this, Radich argues that the term tathāgatagarbha also developed as an internalized buddha relic which came to refer to the presence of a buddha&#x27;s qualities, mode of being or body which was not located in a stupa but in sentient beings.

Another key aspect of the buddha-nature as taught in the &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot; is that it can only be directly perceived by a fully awakened Buddha, though the sutra says that a bodhisattva at the tenth stage (bhūmi) can also perceive buddha-nature in an imperfect and indistinct manner. Since according to the &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot;, &quot;the nature of the Tathāgata is difficult to see&quot;, the sutra emphasizes the importance of faith (&quot;śraddhā&quot;) in both the &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot; itself and in the buddha-nature, saying that &quot;only one who follows the teachings of the Tathāgata, faithfully committing oneself to them, after that sees their equality [to the Buddha].&quot; 

==== Buddhadhātu as ātman and the four perfections ====
The &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot; describes Buddhahood and buddha-nature as a true self (&quot;ātman&quot;), a “supreme essence” (Tibetan: snying po’i mchog) and as a &quot;great self&quot; (&quot;mahātman,&quot; 大我) that is eternal, pure and blissful, and is also separate from the five aggregates and beyond samsaric phenomena. For example, the sutra states:

The real self is the nature of the Tathāgata ( 如來性). Know that all sentient beings have this, but as those sentient beings are enshrouded by immeasurable afflictions, it is not manifested.

The Indic term &quot;ātman&quot; generally referred to &quot;the permanent and indestructible essence, or an unchanging central element, of any human or other sentient being&quot;, and the idea that such a thing existed was widely rejected by mainstream Indian Buddhism. In teaching the existence of a permanent element (Tibetan: &quot;yang dag khams&quot;) in sentient beings that allows them to become Buddhas, the sutra is self consciously adopting a Buddhist version of ātmavāda (“discourse about the self”) which was popular in Indian thought, while also modifying the Buddhist doctrine of not-self (&quot;anātman&quot;) that completely rejected any notion of a self.

The teaching that the buddha-nature is a self is one of the &quot;four inversions&quot; (viparyāsas), a key theme in the &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot;. Early Buddhism held that living beings have four distortions in how they perceive reality: they see what is impermanent as permanent (nitya), they see what is not-self as a self (ātman), they see what is impure as pure (śubha/śuci) and they see what is suffering as being pleasant or blissful (sukha). The &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot; claims that while these four do apply to samsaric phenomena, when it comes to the &quot;supreme dharma(s)&quot; (&quot;zhenshifa&quot; 真實法, *paramadharma, like Buddha and buddha-nature), the opposite is the case. As the sutra states:
Monks, whatever you mentally cultivate, repeatedly and increasingly and with full acceptance, to be in all instances impermanent, unsatisfactory, without self, and impure, amid these there is that which exhibits permanence, bliss, purity and selfhood...
As such, the &quot;Nirvana sutra &quot;claims that buddha-nature (and the Buddha&#x27;s body, his Dharmakaya) is characterized by four perfections (pāramitās) or qualities (which are denied in classic Buddhist doctrine): permanence (&quot;nitya&quot;), bliss (&quot;sukha&quot;), self (&quot;ātman&quot;), and purity (&quot;śuddha).&quot; The four perfections as a feature of buddha-nature is also found in the &quot;Śrīmālādevī sūtra.&quot;

==== &quot;Self&quot; and &quot;not-self&quot; as skillful means ====
Paul Williams also notes that while we can speak of the tathāgatagarbha as a Self, this is a much more complex issue since the sutra also speaks of the importance of the not-self teaching, saying that those who have notions of a self cannot perceive buddha-nature.

The &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot; is aware that there are numerous non-buddhist accounts of a self which might sound similar to its own self theory and it argues that if they seem similar, this is due to two reasons. The first is that non-buddhist ātmavāda theories are often misinterpretations or misrememberings of what was taught by a bodhisattva and the second is that they may be skillful means taught to non-buddhists by Buddhas and bodhisattvas. Furthermore, numerous non-buddhist doctrines of a self are rejected in the &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot; (including some of the theories taught in the Upanishads), in which the self is &quot;some kernel of identity hidden within the body&quot; which is a &quot;person&quot; (pudgala), a jīva, a &quot;doer&quot; (kartṛ) or a &quot;master&quot; (zhu 主). According to Williams, the &quot;Self&quot; taught in the &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot; &quot;is not a Self in the worldly sense taught by non-Buddhist thinkers, or maintained to exist by the much-maligned ‘man in the street’&quot;, since these are considered to lead to egoistic grasping. 

Thus, the &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot; often portrays the teaching of the tathāgatagarbha as a Self as being a skillful means, a useful strategy to convert non-buddhists and to combat annihilationist interpretations of the Dharma. For example, in &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot;, the Buddha proclaims &quot;I do not teach that all sentient beings are without a self! I constantly teach that all sentient beings possess Buddha-nature; is Buddha-nature not the self? Hence, I have not taught an annihilationist view.&quot; The Buddha then states the reason he teaches not-self (and impermanence, suffering, and impurity) is because sentient beings do not see the buddha-nature. Later on in the sutra, the Buddha also states:
Good son, this Buddha-nature is in truth not the self; for the benefit of sentient beings is it called the self.… Buddha-nature is absence of self, [but] the Tathāgata teaches the self [for the sake of some audiences]: because of his permanence, the Tathāgata is the self, but he teaches absence of self, because he has achieved sovereignty [zizai 自在, possibly Skt. aiśvarya].

Thus, according to the &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot;, the Buddha uses the term self when needed (to overcome nihilistic interpretations of not-self) and teaching not-self when needed (to overcome grasping at what is not the self). This is part of his skillful means (upaya) to guide beings to liberation.

The &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot; states that those who see everything as empty and fail to see what is &quot;not&quot; empty do not know the true middle way. Likewise, those who see everything as not-self but fail to see what is Self also fail to see the true middle way, which is the buddha nature&quot;.&quot; According to Mark Blum, the &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot; sees the Buddhist doctrine of not-self as &quot;a very important doctrine to be expounded when the listener is attached to his or her notion of selfhood or personality, because it deconstructs that object of attachment, revealing its nature as a fantasy.&quot; However, the sutra understands both the not-self and emptiness teachings as being skillful means, not ultimate truths. The &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot; also affirms the truth of &quot;non-emptiness&quot;, which is a real genuine self, the buddha-nature. 

The &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot; compares the not-self teaching to a milk-based medicine which is useful for certain ailments, but not for all. Because of this, a physician who only prescribed this single medicine would be an unskillful one. The Buddha in the &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot; says he taught not-self in order to get rid of certain mistaken views of self in order that the correct teaching about the self (i.e. the buddha-nature) could be given. This is why according to the &quot;Nirvana sutra,&quot; &quot;the Buddha teaches that the nature of the Tathāgata (如來性) is the real self (真實我), but if with respect to this tenet one mentally cultivates [the thought] that it is not the self, this is called the third distortion.&quot; 

Using another medicinal simile, the Nirvana sutra compares the teaching of not-self to a medicine which requires a mother to stop breast feeding her infant. The mother thus smears her breast with a pungent ointment and tells her child that it is poison. When the medicine is fully ingested, the mother removes the ointment and invites the child to nurse at her breast again. In this simile, the medicine is the skillful notion of not-self, and the mother&#x27;s milk is the teaching of &quot;the nature of the Tathāgata, which is the supermundane, supreme self&quot; (離世真實之我, possibly *&quot;lokottaraparamātman&quot;).

Another important element of the relationship between not-self and true self in the &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot; is that they are seen as non-dual (advaya), as two sides of the same coin so to speak. Thus, according to the &quot;Nirvana&quot;: &quot;the wise know that the existence of the self and absence of self are non-dual.&quot; In making this claim, the sutra also cites two sutras, the &quot;Sarvapuṇyasamuccayasūtra&quot; (possibly Taisho no. 381–382) and a &quot;Prajñāpāramitā&quot; sutra (the most likely candidate being the &quot;Suvikrāntavikrāmiparipṛcchā&quot;).

=== Icchantikas ===
Despite the fact that the Buddha-nature is innate in all sentient beings, there is a class of people who called &quot;icchantikas&quot; (&quot;extremists&quot; or &quot;dogmatists&quot;) which are either excluded from Buddhahood or will find it very difficult to ever reach it. The &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot; discusses this class of people often. According to scholars like Blum and Brunnholzl, the exact status and nature of the icchantika in the Nirvana sutra is difficult to ascertain, as the topic is discussed in different ways throughout the sutra. &quot;&quot; In some parts, icchantikas are said to be like scorched seeds who can never sprout and thus of being incurable and incapable of Buddhahood. In other passages, they are said to also possess buddha-nature and to be able to attain buddhahood (their potential for buddhahood is also depicted much more positively in the longer versions of the sutra). &quot;&quot; As such, the icchantika doctrine has caused much controversy and debate in East Asian Buddhism. &quot;&quot;

According to Karashima, the word icchantika derives from the verb icchati (to claim, to hold, to maintain) and the term is thus best understood as &quot;someone who [makes] claims; an opinionated [person].&quot; Specifically, the icchantika is someone who rejects and is hostile to the buddha nature teaching of the &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot;.

The &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot; describes them as follows:
In spite of their hostile dogmatism, the longer version of the &quot;Nirvana Sutra&quot; explains that because all beings have the buddha-nature, all beings without exception, even icchantikas (the most incorrigible and spiritually base of beings), can eventually attain liberation and become Buddhas. This is possible if they gain faith in buddha-nature, as the Dharmakṣema translation of the &quot;Nirvana&quot; states: &quot;If an icchantika were to have faith in the existence of Buddha-nature, know that he will not descend into the three bad [destinies], and also is then not called an icchantika.&quot;

=== Decline of the Dharma ===
Parts of the &quot;Nirvana Sutra&quot; are very concerned with the decline of the Dharma and with eschatology, describing how in the times of Dharma decline, there will be false monks, false teachings and all sorts of calamities. Hodge argues that the earliest portion of the sutra was written in India by people who believed they were living in an age of decline in which the Buddha-dharma would perish. The sutra states that during the age of Dharma decline, the Mahayana sutras will be lost (including the Nirvana sutra itself), false teachings will spread, and monks will act unethically, owning servants, cattle and horses, and engaging in lay jobs like farming, smithing, painting, sculpture and divination (instead of focusing on the Dharma).

The sutra responds to this situation of decline with the proclamation of the innate Buddhahood that is present in all (though it remains concealed by the defilements). The &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot; sees itself as the final teaching of the Buddha that has the power to lead people to discover their own innate buddha-nature (as long as they listen to it with faith). As such, it sees itself as the ideal solution to the era of Dharma decline.

== Texts ==
The Indic text of the &quot;Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra&quot; (in Sanskrit) has survived only in a number of fragments, which were discovered in Central Asia, Afghanistan and Japan. Four full editions of the &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot; of varying lengths survive in Chinese and Tibetan. The fragments are written in Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit and indicate that they were written by speakers of a Prakrit language.

=== Chinese ===
According to early Chinese sutra catalogues such as the &quot;Lidai Sanbao ji&quot; (歷代三寶紀), a part of the core portion of the sutra was translated previously into Chinese by Dharmarakṣa (fl. c. 260-280), though this version is now lost. Chinese canonical records also mention that another lost translation was made by the Chinese monk Zhimeng who studied in India from 404-424 CE. According to Zhimeng&#x27;s own account, he also obtained his manuscript from the same layman in Pataliputra as Faxian did some years earlier.

==== The &quot;six fascicle text&quot; ====
This translation, often called the &quot;Six fascicle text&quot;, and titled &quot;Dabannihuan jing&quot; (大般泥洹經, Taisho no. 376.12.853-899), is the shortest and earliest translation into Chinese. It is attributed to Faxian and Buddhabhadra during the Jin dynasty (266–420) between 416 and 418. Though the translation of this version in six fascicles (&quot;juàn&quot; 卷) is conventionally ascribed to Faxian (法顯), this attribution is probably inaccurate. According to Faxian&#x27;s own account, the manuscript copy forming the basis of the six &quot;juan&quot; Chinese version was obtained by him in Pāṭaliputra from the house of a layman known as Kālasena, during his travels in India. The earliest surviving Chinese sutra catalogue, Sengyou&#x27;s &quot;Chu Sanzang Jiji&quot; (出三藏記集), which was written less than 100 years after the date of this translation, makes no mention of Faxian. Instead it states that the translation was done by Buddhabhadra and his assistant Baoyun (寶雲), quoting earlier catalogues to corroborate this attribution. The idea that Faxian was involved in the translation only emerges in later catalogues, compiled several hundred years after the event.

==== Dharmakṣema&#x27;s &quot;northern&quot; edition ====
The &quot;Northern text&quot;, titled &quot;Dabanniepan jing&quot; (大般涅槃經), is a translation in 40 fascicles (Taisho no. 374.12.365c-603c), completed by the Magadhan Indian monk translator Dharmakṣema (c. 385–433 CE) between 421 and 430 in the Northern Liang kingdom. This &quot;northern&quot; version of the text is &quot;around four times the length&quot; of the &quot;six fascicle&quot; version and the later Tibetan translation, extending for a further thirty fascicles, beyond the first ten fascicles of the &quot;core&quot; sutra material. This version was also later translated into Classical Tibetan from the Chinese.

The first ten fascicles of the northern edition may be based on a birch-bark manuscript from North-Western India that Dharmakṣema brought with him, which he used for the initial translation work of his version. This version corresponds overall in content to the &quot;six fascicle&quot; version and the Tibetan version.

Many scholars doubt the Indian provenance of the extra material found in the northern edition (the content beyond the first ten fascicles). The chief reasons for this skepticism are the following:
* No traces of an extended Sanskrit text has ever been found. Sanskrit manuscript fragments of twenty four separate pages distributed right across the core portion of the &quot;Mahāparinirvāṇa-sūtra&quot; have been found over the past hundred years in various parts of Asia; Likewise, there are no quotations from this latter portion in any Indian commentaries or sutra anthologies.
* No other translator in China or Tibet ever found Sanskrit copies of this portion. The Chinese monk-translator Yijing traveled to India and searched for this material but only found manuscripts corresponding to the core text.

Some textual scholars argue the latter portion of the northern edition may have been a Central Asian composition, and some, even argue it may have been written by Dharmakṣema himself. However, other scholars like Jones and Granoff note that the latter portion knows of Indic texts which were unknown in China. Thus, Jones writes that there is &quot;convincing evidence that this material is familiar with Indian literature unknown to any other Chinese materials that we know from Dharmakṣema’s time.&quot; Granoff notes for example, that the story of Ajatasatru in the latter portion of the &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot; draws on the &quot;Mahābhārata,&quot; suggesting an Indic origin. Furthermore, as Jones notes, both Chinese and Tibetan tradition understood the additional content as being of Indic origin.

One significant difference between the Dharmakṣema edition and the earlier six fascicle &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot; is that the six fascicle&#x27;s view of icchantikas (heretics who cling to wrong views and reject the teachings of the Nirvana sutra) is much more negative and harsh. The Dharmakṣema translation of the &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot; seems to indicate that icchantikas can redeem themselves and eventually attain Buddhahood (since all beings have buddha-nature), while the six fascicle version seems to indicate that icchantikas are hopeless. This was famously a point of contention for the leading Chinese monk Daosheng (c. 360–434), who rejected the Faxian translation and was exiled, until he was vindicated when the new translation of Dharmakṣema was released.

There is also a secondary Chinese version the Dharmakṣema&#x27;s translation, which was completed in 453 CE. This was produced &quot;by polishing the style and adding new section headings&quot; according to Stephen Hodge.

==== The &quot;southern&quot; edition ====
The &quot;Southern text&quot; (Taisho no. 375.12.605-852), in 36 fascicles, was edited c. 453 by Huiguan and Huiyan during the Liu Song dynasty. This edition integrates and amends the translations of the six fascicle text and Dharmakṣema&#x27;s into a single edition of thirty-six fascicles. This edition changes the chapter divisions of the first part of the Dharmakṣema to match the six fascicle version and it also changes the language, Chinese characters and syntax to a more accessible and readable.

=== Tibetan editions ===
In the 6th section of the Tibetan Kangyur collection (vols. 77-78) there are three translations of the &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot;:

* Toh 120, the first &quot;short&quot; translation of the sūtra, in 3. 900 ślokas (13 scrolls). It was made in the early 9th century by Jinamitra, Dhyānagarbha and Ban de btsan dra. It is titled: ཡོངས་སུ་མྱ་ངན་ལས་འདས་པ་ཆེན་པོ་ཐེག་པ་ཆེན་པོའི་མདོ།, &quot;Phags pa yong su Mya ngan las &#x27;Das pa chen po theg pa chen po&#x27;i mdo.&quot;
* Toh 119 - a translation from Chinese into Tibetan of the version of Dharmakṣema by Wang-phab-zhun, Dge-ba&#x27;i blos-gros and Rgya-mtsho&#x27;i sde in 56 scrolls, with the title ཡོངས་སུ་མྱ་ངན་ལས་འདས་པ་ཆེན་པོའི་མདོ།, &quot;Phags pa yongs su mya ngan las &#x27;das pa chen po&#x27;i mdo.&quot;
* Toh 121 which preserves 16 verses translated by Kamalagupta and Rin Chen Bzang Po titled ཡོངས་སུ་མྱ་ངན་ལས་འདས་པའི་མདོ།, &quot;Phags pa yongs su mya ngan las &#x27;das pa&#x27;i mdo.&quot;

=== Related sutras ===
There are several associated texts which are considered to be part of the Nirvana sutra &quot;family&quot;. These are found in the &quot;Nirvana&quot; section (涅槃部) in the Chinese Buddhist canon. It includes:&quot;&quot;

# &quot;Dabanniepan jing houfen&quot; (&quot;The Latter Portion of the Mahāparinirvāṇa sūtra&quot;, 大般涅槃經後分, Taisho no. 377) translated by Tang dynasty monk Huining and the Indian monk *Jñānabhadra (若那跋陀羅) in Heling. This is purported to be an even further missing part of the &quot;Nirvana sutra.&quot; Dharmakṣemaʼs biography records a comment by Tanwufa mentioning a missing portion, and some biographies mention that Dharmakṣema died while on his way back to India (or Central Asia) to search for the missing parts of the sutra.
# &quot;Si tongzi sanmei jing&quot; (四童子三昧經 Taisho no. 379, Sanskrit: &quot;Caturdhārakasamādhi sūtra&quot;), translated by Jñānagupta in the Sui dynasty. Its setting is also the Buddha&#x27;s final nirvana, though it has Ananda as the main interlocutor. It also teaches that the Buddha is eternally embodied in the dharmakaya and is always preaching the Dharma.
# &quot;Fangdeng bannihuan jing&quot; (方等般泥洹經 Taisho no. 378, Sanskrit: &quot;Caturdhārakasamādhi sūtra&quot;), translated by Dharmarakṣa. The first six chapters are similar to Taisho no. 379, while the rest of the text focuses on Śākyamuniʼs buddhafield and the Buddha&#x27;s parinirvāṇa.
# &quot;Fo chui banniepan lüe shuo jiao jie jing&quot; (佛垂般涅槃略說教誡經 Taisho no. 389), also known as &quot;Yi jiao jing&quot; (遺教經), translated by Kumārajīva. It also describes the final nirvana and teaches that the Buddha is eternal.

=== Commentaries ===
Numerous commentaries on the Nirvana sutra were written in China. The most important Chinese commentary on the &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot; is the &quot;Compendium of Commentaries on the *Mahāparinirvāṇa-sūtra&quot; (&quot;Dabanniepanjing ji jie&quot;, 大般涅槃經集解 T 1763), compiled in 509 by Baoliang (寶亮) in the Liang dynasty. This is a compilation of comments by numerous masters on the Nirvana sutra. It includes comments by Emperor Wu of the Liang, Daosheng, Sengliang, Falue, Tanji, Sengzong, Baoliang, Zhixiu, Fazhi, Faan, Tanzhun, Falang, Tan&#x27;ai, Tanqian, Mingjun, Daohui, Falian and Jiaoyi.&quot;&quot;

Another important commentary was the Nirvana school scholar Pao-liang&#x27;s (d. 509) &quot;On the Middle Path Buddha-nature&quot;. Pao-liang interprets the buddha-nature as the innately pure mind which is &quot;the mysterious essence of divine illumination&quot;. According to Pao-liang, &quot;there is not one split second in which this liberating essence is not functioning (to deliver the person from ignorance)&quot; and he also says that this &quot;liberating function&quot; is the same as the natural tendency to avoid pain and seek bliss. Pao-liang also says that buddha nature is both in the skandhas and transcends them, being the unity of the two truths and the unity of samsara and nirvana.

Other Chinese commentaries in the Taisho Tripitaka include:

<text>The pseudo-Hadamard transform is a reversible transformation of a bit string that provides cryptographic diffusion. See Hadamard transform.

The bit string must be of even length so that it can be split into two bit strings &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; of equal lengths, each of &quot;n&quot; bits. To compute the transform for Twofish algorithm, &quot;a&quot;&#x27; and &quot;b&quot;&#x27;, from these we use the equations:

:formula_1

:formula_2

To reverse this, clearly:

:formula_3

:formula_4

On the other hand, the transformation for SAFER+ encryption is as follows:

:formula_5

:formula_6

==Generalization==

The above equations can be expressed in matrix algebra, by considering &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; as two elements of a vector, and the transform itself as multiplication by a matrix of the form:

:formula_7

The inverse can then be derived by inverting the matrix.

However, the matrix can be generalised to higher dimensions, allowing vectors of any power-of-two size to be transformed, using the following recursive rule:

:formula_8

For example:

:formula_9

<text>Dodds is an unincorporated community in eastern Clearcreek Township, Warren County, Ohio, United States. It was formerly on the Cincinnati, Lebanon and Northern Railway.

==History==
A post office called Dodds was established in 1881, and remained in operation until 1901. The Dodds family had settled the area in the early 19th century.

<doc id="1188118" wikidata="Q1399677" url="?curid=1188118" title="Suleviae">
<text>In ancient Celtic religion, Sulevia was a goddess worshipped in Gaul, Britain, and Gallaecia, very often in the plural forms Suleviae or (dative) Sule(v)is. Dedications to Sulevia(e) are attested in about forty inscriptions, distributed quite widely in the Celtic world, but with particular concentrations in Noricum, among the Helvetii, along the Rhine, and also in Rome. Jufer and Luginbühl distinguish the Suleviae from another group of plural Celtic goddesses, the Matres, and interpret the name Suleviae as meaning &quot;those who govern well&quot;. In the same vein, Patrizia de Bernardo Stempel connects Suleviae with Welsh &quot;hylyw&quot; &#x27;leading (well)&#x27; and Breton &quot;helevez&quot; &#x27;good behaviour&#x27;.

==Epigraphy==

The Suleviae have been identified in one inscription with the Junones, but mostly with the Matres, for example on an inscription from Roman Colchester, as well as on most of the inscriptions from Rome. The Colchester inscription reads:

::::MATRIBVS SVLEVIS SIMILIS ATTI F CI CANT VSLM
::(Translated: &quot;To the Sulevi mothers, Similis the son of Attius, of the Civitas Cantiacorum, willingly and deservedly fulfills his vow.&quot;)

In another inscription, the dative singular &quot;Suleviae Idennicae&quot; is attested in conjunction with Roman goddess Minerva.

== Relation to other deities ==
Van Andringa interprets the Suleviae as &quot;native domestic divinities honoured at all social levels&quot;. For the theory that the Suleviae were a triune version of Sulis Minerva, see Sulis. This theory is disputed by some researchers who find no direct links with Sulis, and suggest instead that the similarity in names is coincidental. Another theory connects the Suleviae with the Xulsigiae, known from a site at Trier; but this suggestion has also been contested.

<text>Mariupol is a city in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine. It is situated on the northern coast (Pryazovia) of the Sea of Azov, at the mouth of the Kalmius River. Prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, it was the tenth-largest city in the country and the second-largest city in Donetsk Oblast, with an estimated population of 425,681 people in January 2022; as of August 2023, Ukrainian authorities estimate the population of Mariupol at approximately 120,000. Mariupol has been occupied by Russian forces since May 2022.

Historically, the city of Mariupol was a centre for trade and manufacturing, and played a key role in the development of higher education and many businesses and also served as a coastal resort on the Sea of Azov. In 1948, Mariupol was renamed Zhdanov () after Andrei Zhdanov, a native of the city who had become a high-ranking official of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and a close ally to Joseph Stalin. The name was part of a larger effort to rename cities after high-ranking political figures in the Soviet Union. The historic name was restored in 1989.

Mariupol was founded on the site of a former encampment for Cossacks, known as Kalmius, and was granted city rights within the Russian Empire in 1778. It played a key role in Stalin-era industrialization; it was a centre for grain trade, metallurgy, and heavy engineering—including the Illich Iron and Steel Works and the Azovstal Iron and Steel Works.

Beginning on 24 February 2022, a three-month-long siege by Russian forces largely destroyed the city, for which it was named a &quot;Hero City of Ukraine&quot; by the Ukrainian government. On 16 May 2022, the last Ukrainian troops who remained in Mariupol surrendered at the Azovstal Iron and Steel Works, and the Russian military secured complete control over the city by 20 May.

== History ==
===Ancient history===

Neolithic burial grounds excavated on the shore of the Sea of Azov date from the end of the third millennium BCE. Over 120 skeletons have been discovered, with stone and bone instruments, beads, shell-work, and animal teeth.

===Crimean Khanate===
From the 12th through the 16th century, the area around Mariupol was largely devastated and depopulated by intense conflict between the Crimean Tatars, the Nogay Horde, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and Muscovy. By the middle of the 15th century much of the region north of the Black and Azov Seas was annexed by the Crimean Khanate and became a dependency of the Ottoman Empire. East of the Dnieper River a desolate steppe stretched to the Sea of Azov, where lack of water made early settlement precarious. Being near the Muravsky Trail exposed it to frequent Crimean–Nogai slave raids and plundering by Tatar tribes, preventing permanent settlement and keeping it sparsely populated, or even entirely uninhabited, under Tatar rule. Hence it was known as the Wild Fields or the &#x27;Deserted Plains&#x27; (&quot;Campi Deserti&quot; in Latin).

===Cossack period===
In this region of Eurasian steppes, the Cossacks emerged as a distinct people in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. Below the Dnieper Rapids were the Zaporozhian Cossacks, freebooters organized into small, loosely-knit, and highly mobile groups who were both livestock farmers and nomads. The Cossacks would regularly penetrate the steppe to fish and hunt, as well as for migratory farming and to herd livestock. Their independence from governmental and landowner authority attracted to join them many peasants and serfs fleeing the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and Grand Duchy of Moscow.

The Treaty of Constantinople in 1700 further isolated the region, as it stipulated that there should be no settlements or fortifications on the coast of the Azov Sea to the mouth of the Mius River. In 1709, in response to a Cossack alliance with Sweden against Russia, Tsar Peter the Great ordered the liquidation of the Zaporozhian Sich, and their complete and permanent expulsion from the area. In 1733, Russia was preparing for a new military campaign against the Ottoman Empire and therefore allowed the return of the Zaporozhians, although the territory officially belonged to Turkey.
Under the Agreement of Lubny of 1734, the Zaporozhians regained all their former lands, and in return, were to serve in the Russian army in war. They were also permitted to build a new stockade on the Dnieper River called New Sich, though the terms prohibited them from erecting fortifications. These terms allowed only for living quarters, in Ukrainian called &quot;kureni&quot;.

Upon their return, the Zaporozhian population in these lands was extremely sparse, so effort to establish a measure of control, they introduced a structure of districts or palankas. The nearest district to modern Mariupol was the Kalmius District, but its border did not extend to the mouth of the Kalmius River, although this area had been part of its migratory territory. After 1736, the Zaporozhian Cossacks and the Don Cossacks (whose capital was at nearby Novoazovsk) came into conflict over the area, until Tsarina Elizabeth issued a decree in 1746 declaring the Kalmius River the dividing line between the two Cossack hosts.

Sometime after 1738, the treaties of Belgrade and Niš in 1739, in addition to the Russian-Turkish convention of 1741, as well as the following likely concurrent land survey of 1743–1746 (resulting in the demarcation decree of 1746), the Zaporzhian Cossacks established a military outpost on &quot;the high promontory on the right bank of the Kalmius river.&quot; Though the details of its construction and history are obscure, excavations have revealed Cossack artifacts, including others, within the enclosure being approximately 120 square meters in the shape of a square. The outpost was likely a modest structure in that it lay within the territory of the Ottoman Empire, and the erection of fortifications on the Sea of Azov was prohibited by the Treaty of Niš.

The last Tatar raid, launched in 1769, covered a vast area, overrunning the New Russian Province with a huge army in severe wintertime weather. The raid destroyed the Kalmius fortifications and burned all the Cossack winter lodgings. In 1770, the Russian government, during the war with Turkey, moved its border with the Crimean Khanate southwest by more than two hundred kilometres. This action initiated the Dnieper fortified line (running from today&#x27;s Zaporizhzhia to Novopetrovka), thereby laying claim to the region, including the site of future Mariupol, from the Ottoman Empire.

Following the victory of the Russian forces, the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca eliminated the endemic threat from Crimea. In 1775, Zaporizhzhia was incorporated into the New Russian Governorate, and part of the land claimed behind the Dnieper fortified line including modern Mariupol was incorporated in the newly re-established Azov Governorate.

=== Russian Empire and Soviet Union ===
After the Russo-Turkish War from 1768 to 1774, the governor of the Azov Governorate, Vasily A. Chertkov, reported to Grigory Potemkin on 23 February 1776 that ruins of ancient &quot;domakhas&quot; (homes) had been found in the area, and in 1778 he planned the new town of &quot;Pavlovsk&quot;. However, on 29 September 1779, the city of Marianοpol () in Kalmius County was founded on the site. For the Russian authorities the city was named after the Russian Empress Maria Feodorovna; its de facto title came from after the Greek settlement of Mariampol, a suburb of Bakhchysarai in Crimea. The name was derived from the Hodegetria icon of the Holy Theotokos and the Virgin Mary. Subsequently, in 1780, Russian authorities forcibly relocated many Orthodox Greeks from Crimea to the Mariupol area, in what is known as the Emigration of Christians from the Crimea.

In 1782, Mariupol was an administrative seat of its county in the Azov Governorate of the Russian Empire, with 2,948 inhabitants. In the early 19th century, a customs house, a church-parish school, a port authority building, a county religious school, and two privately founded girls&#x27; schools were built. By the 1850s the population had grown to 4,600 and the city had 120 shops and 15 wine cellars. In 1869, consuls and vice-consuls of Prussia, Sweden, Norway, Austria-Hungary, the Roman States, Italy, and France established their representative offices in Mariupol.

After the construction of the railway line from Yuzovka (later Stalino and Donetsk) to Mariupol in 1882, much of the wheat grown in the Yekaterinoslav Governorate and coal from the Donets Basin were exported via the port of Mariupol (the second largest in the South Russian Empire after Odesa), which served as a key funding source for opening a hospital, public library, electric power station and urban water supply system.

Mariupol remained a local trading centre until 1898, when the Belgian subsidiary &quot;SA Providence Russe&quot; opened a steelworks in Sartana, a village near Mariupol (now the Ilyich Steel &amp; Iron Works). The company incurred heavy losses and by 1902 was bankrupt, owing 6 million francs to the Providence company and needing to be re-financed by the Banque de l&#x27;Union Parisienne.
The mills brought cultural diversity to Mariupol as immigrants, mostly peasants from all over the empire, moved to the city looking for a job and a better life. The number of workers increased to 5,400.

In 1914, the population of Mariupol reached 58,000. However, the period from 1917 onwards saw a continuous decline in population and industry due to the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 and the subsequent Russian Civil War. In 1933, a new steelworks (&quot;Azovstal&quot;) was built along the Kalmius River.

=== World War II ===

During World War II, the city was under German military occupation from 8 October 1941, to 10 September 1943. During this time, the city suffered tremendous material damage and great loss of life. The Germans shot approximately 10,000 inhabitants, sent nearly 50,000 young men and girls as forced laborers to Germany and deported 36,000 prisoners to concentration camps.

During the occupation, the Germans focused on &quot;the complete and quick destruction&quot; of Mariupol&#x27;s Jewish population, as part of the Holocaust. The execution of the Jews of Mariupol was carried out by Sonderkommando 10A, which was part of Einsatzgruppe D. The leader was Obersturmbannführer Heinz Seetzen. The Germans shot about 8,000 Mariupol Jews from 20 October 1941, to 21 October 1941. By 21 November 1941, Mariupol was declared Jew-free.

The &quot;Menorah memorial&quot;, or officially, the Mariupol Memorial to the Murdered Jews is installed in a suburb of Mariupol in memory to the murdered Jews of the city. The work consists of a seven-pointed menorah, a Star of David and two commemorative steles with inscriptions in Russian:


The Choral Synagogue of Mariupol was reportedly undamaged during the hostilities. Reportedly, the Germans opened a hospital in the building, and when they retreated, tried to set fire to it.

The Germans operated four transit camps for prisoners of war in Mariupol, consecutively Dulag 152 in 1941–1942, Dulag 172 in 1942, Dulag 190 in 1942–1943 and Dulag 201 in 1943, as well a subcamp of the Stalag 368 POW camp in 1943. Mariupol was liberated by the Soviet Red Army on 10 September 1943.

In 1948, Mariupol was renamed &quot;Zhdanov&quot;, after the recently deceased close Stalin ally Andrei Zhdanov, who had been born in the city. The historic name of the city &quot;Mariupol&quot; was restored in 1989 after a popular grassroots movement advocated for the name change.

=== Russo-Ukrainian War ===
====War in Donbas and economic downturn====
Following the Ukrainian Revolution of Dignity in 2014, pro-Russian movements and protests erupted across eastern Ukraine, including Mariupol. This unrest later evolved into the Russo-Ukrainian War between the Ukrainian government and Russia together with the separatist forces of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic (DPR). In May of that year, a battle between the two sides broke out in Mariupol after it briefly came under DPR control. On 13 June 2014, the city was recaptured by government forces, and, in June 2015, Mariupol was proclaimed the temporary administrative centre of Donetsk Oblast until the city of Donetsk could be recaptured by the Ukrainian forces.

The city remained peaceful until the end of August 2014, when DPR separatists together with a detachment of the Russian Armed Forces captured Novoazovsk, located east of Mariupol near the Russo-Ukrainian border. This followed an offensive by pro-Russian forces from the east, which came within of Mariupol, before an overnight counter-offensive pushed the separatists away from the city. In September, the two sides agreed to a ceasefire, halting that offensive. Minor skirmishes continued on the outskirts of Mariupol in the following months.

A rocket attack on Mariupol was launched on 24 January 2015 by the Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic, from the village of Shyrokyne around east of Mariupol city limits. Grad rockets fired by separatist forces hit residential areas of Mariupol, killing at least 30 people. A Bellingcat investigative team concluded that the shelling was instructed, directed and supervised by Russian military commanders in active service with the Russian Ministry of Defence. The attack exposed the city&#x27;s vulnerability to separatist attacks. As a result, in February 2015, Ukrainian forces launched an surprise assault on Shyrokyne, forcing the separatists out from Shyrokyne and neighbouring villages by July 2015.

In May 2018, the Crimean Bridge was opened, linking mainland Russia to Crimea, which had been annexed in 2014 in the opening stages of the Russo-Ukrainian War. Russia &quot;dramatically increased&quot; the number of armed vessels in the Kerch Strait in 2018, and cargo ships bound for Mariupol found themselves subject to inspections by Russian authorities, resulting in delays of up to a week. Therefore, Mariupol port workers were put on a four-day week schedule. On 26 October 2018, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; reported that the bridge had reduced Ukrainian shipping from its Azov Sea ports (including Mariupol) by about 25%.

==== 2022 Russian siege and subsequent occupation ====

During the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine of 2022, Mariupol was a strategic target for Russian forces and their proxies. It came under artillery bombardment the day the invasion began, and was placed under siege by Russian forces. By early March, a severe humanitarian crisis developed in the city, which a Red Cross worker later described as &quot;apocalyptic&quot;, citing food shortages and severe damage to infrastructure and access to sanitation. The siege was also marked by numerous war crimes committed by Russian forces, most notably Russian airstrikes on a maternity hospital and a drama theater serving as an air raid shelter for hundreds of civilians.

By late April, Russian and separatist troops had pushed deep into most of the city, separating the last Ukrainian troops from the few pockets of Ukrainian troops retreating into the Azovstal Iron and Steel Works, which contains a complex of bunkers and tunnels which could even resist a nuclear bombing. Ukrainian troops in Azovstal held out until 16 May 2022, when its last troops from the Azovstal Steel Plant surrendered and the city fell into Russian control.

When the fighting stopped, &quot;as many as 90%&quot; of residential buildings in Mariupol had been damaged or destroyed, according to the United Nations (UN) and Ukrainian authorities. Estimates for the number of civilian dead ranged from the UN&#x27;s list of 1,348 confirmed deaths to the Ukrainian claim of over 25,000. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky awarded Mariupol the title of Hero City of Ukraine due to Ukrainian forces&#x27; &quot;valiant defense&quot; of the city.

In the months after they took control of the city, Russian authorities had many damaged buildings torn down, sometimes evicting the remaining residents. Some new housing was also built. Associated Press described this ongoing process as an effort to &quot;eradicat[e] all vestiges of Ukraine&quot; and to cover up &quot;the evidence of war crimes&quot;. Local schools started using a Russian curriculum, the television and radio broadcasts switched to Russian, and many street names were replaced by their Soviet-era names. The latter was especially controversial, as the Ukrainian authorities restored many historic names during the decommunization process, all of which predated the Soviet Union. Among other toponyms, &quot;Freedom Square&quot; was renamed &quot;Lenin Square&quot;.

In August 2023, the Institute for the Study of War reported that the Ukrainian Resistance Center had claimed to have gained access to documents detailing Russian plans to conduct a decade-long ethnic cleansing campaign in occupied Mariupol. The ISW reported that the depopulation of Ukrainians through deportation and Russian efforts to attract Russian citizens to move to the city is likely to be an ethnic cleansing campaign in addition to being apparent violations of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.

The estimates of the pre-war population that remained in the city in 2024 vary from 80,000 to 120,000. Since the invasion is estimated to have damaged over 90% of housing in the city centre, the Russian government has invested significant amounts towards building new buildings. This process has included demolishing many damaged buildings, whose remaining residents are sometimes not allowed into the rebuilt buildings, and are offered new property further from the city centre with little compensation. Property prices are similar to before the war, with the Russian government maintaining mortgages at 2% to draw in Russian buyers. According to a Ukrainian official, they number around 80,000 as of mid-2024. In early 2024 the Russian government began a process to seize properties from those who had fled, requiring owners to obtain Russian citizenship and re-register properties with Russian authorities in person in order to keep them. 514 apartments were declared ownerless in May.

The 2023 Ukrainian documentary about the siege, &quot;20 Days in Mariupol&quot;, won the 2024 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature Film.

In November 2024, Ukrainian MP Maxym Tkachenko reported that around one third of the estimated 200,000 people that fled Mariupol during the city&#x27;s siege had returned to living in the city, primarily due to inadequate government support when living elsewhere. A day later he said that &quot;There is no such data. It was my unfounded and emotional assumption.&quot;

== Geography ==
Mariupol is located in the south of the Donetsk Oblast, on the coast of Sea of Azov and at the mouth of Kalmius River. It is located in an area of the Azov Lowland that is an extension of the Ukrainian Black Sea Lowland. To the east of Mariupol is the Khomutov Steppe, which is also part of the Azov Lowland, located on the border with Russia.

The city occupies an area of , or including suburbs administered by the city council. The downtown area is , while the area of parks and gardens is .

The city is mainly built on land made of solonetzic (sodium enriched) chernozem, with a significant amount of underground subsoil water, that frequently leads to landslides.

=== Climate ===
Mariupol has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfa&quot;) with warm summers and cold winters. The average annual precipitation is . Agroclimatic conditions allow the cultivation of warmth-loving agricultural crops with long vegetative periods (sunflower, melons, grapes, etc.). However water resources in the region are insufficient, so ponds and water basins are used for the needs of the population and industry.

In winter, the wind blows mainly from the east, and in summer the north.

=== Ecology ===
Mariupol has historically led Ukraine in the volume of emissions of harmful substances by industrial enterprises. The city&#x27;s leading enterprises have begun to address these ecological problems, so, over the last 15 years, industrial emissions have fallen to nearly a half of their previous levels.

Due to stable production by the majority of the large industrial enterprises, the city constantly experiences environmental problems. At the end of the 1970s, Zhdanov (Mariupol) ranked third in the USSR (after Novokuznetsk and Magnitogorsk) in the quantity of industrial emissions. In 1989, including all enterprises, the city had 5,215 sources of atmospheric pollution producing 752,900 tons of harmful substances a year (about 98% from metallurgical enterprises and Mariupol Coke-Chemical Plant &quot;Markokhim&quot;). Even after Ukraine regained independence in 1991, by the mid-1990s many pollution limits were still exceeded:
* 1.3 times for ammonia
* 1.3 times for phenol
* 2.0 times for formaldehyde
In the residential areas adjoining the industrial giants, concentrations of benzopyrene reach 6–9 times the maximum concentration limits; hydrogen fluoride, ammonia, and formaldehyde reach 2–3 to 5 times the maximum concentration limits; dust and oxides of carbon, and hydrogen sulphide are 6–8 times the maximum concentration limits; and dioxides of nitrogen are 2–3 times the maximum concentration limits. The maximum concentration limit has been exceed on phenol by 17x, and on benzapiren by 13-14x.

Ill-considered locations of the Azovstal and Markokhim to economize on transport charges, during both construction in the 1930s and subsequent operations, have led to extensive wind-borne emissions into the central areas of Mariupol. Wind intensity and geographical &quot;flatness&quot; offer relief from the accumulation of long-standing pollutants, somewhat easing the problem.

The nearby Sea of Azov is in distress. The fish catch in the area has been reduced by orders of magnitude over the last 30–40 years.

The environmental protection activity of the leading industrial enterprises in Mariupol costs millions of hrivnas, but it appears to have little effect on the city&#x27;s long-standing environmental problems.

== Governance ==
===City administration and local politics===

The Mariupol electorate traditionally supported left wing (socialist and communist) and pro-Russian political parties. At the turn of the 21st century the Party of Regions numerically prevailed in the City Council followed by the Socialist Party of Ukraine.

In the presidential elections of 2004, 91.1% of the city voted for Viktor Yanukovych and 5.93% for Viktor Yuschenko. In the 2006 parliamentary elections, the city voted for the Party of Regions with 39.72% of the votes, the Socialist Party of Ukraine with 20.38%, the Natalia Vitrenko Block with 9.53%, and the Communist Party of Ukraine with 3.29%.

In the 2014 parliamentary elections the Opposition Bloc won more than 50% of the votes. The seats of the city&#x27;s two electoral districts were won by Serhiy Matviyenkov and Serhiy Taruta.

The &quot;de jure&quot; mayor (chairman of executive committee of the city council) of the city is Ukrainian politician Vadym Boychenko. In the October 2020 local elections he was re-elected with 64.57% of the votes as a candidate of the Vadym Boychenko Bloc. In these mayoral elections Volodymyr Klymenko of Opposition Platform — For Life received 25.84% of the vote, self-nominated candidate Lydia Mugli received 4.72%, the candidate from For the Future Yulia Bashkirova received 1.68% and the nominee from Our Land Mykhailo Klyuyev received 0.99% of the votes. Voter turnout in the election was 27%.

On 6 April 2022, amidst the siege of the city, politician Konstantin Ivashchenko was installed by Russia as the mayor of Mariupol. He served as the &quot;de facto&quot; mayor until January 2023, when he was replaced with Oleg Morgun.

===Administrative division===

Mariupol is divided into four urban districts.
*Kalmiuskyi District (until June 2016 named Illichivsk District after Vladimir &quot;Ilyich&quot; Lenin) is the northern part of the city, the largest and most industrialized neighborhood in the city. It is commonly known as the Zavod (&quot;Factory&quot;) of Ilyich.
*Livoberezhnyi District (until June 2016 named after Sergo Ordzhonikidze) is the eastern part of the city, on the left bank of the Kalmius River. Its name means the &quot;Left Bank&quot;.
*Prymorskyi District is the southern area of the city, on the coast of the Azov Sea. The everyday name of the central part this neighbourhood is simply &quot;the Port&quot;.
*Tsentralnyi District is the central urban district. Its everyday name is simply &quot;the Centre&quot; or &quot;the City&quot;. Formerly it was known as Zhovtnevyi District (October District) commemorating the 1917 Bolshevik revolution.
The Kalmius River separates the Livoberezhnyi District from the remaining three districts. The population is mostly concentrated in the Tsentralnyi and Prymorskyi Districts. The Kalmiuskyi District houses the large Illich Steel and Iron Works and the Azovmash manufacturing plant. The Livoberezhnyi (Left Bank) is home to the Azovstal metallurgic combine and the Koksokhim (Coke and Chemical) factory. The settlements of Staryi Krym and Sartana are located in close proximity to the city limits of Mariupol (see map).

=== Coat of arms ===
The modern coat of arms of Mariupol was confirmed in 1989. It is described in heraldic terms as: &quot;Per fess wavy argent and azure, on an anchor or, accompanied by the figure 1778 of the last&quot;. The gold anchor has a ring on top. The number 1778 indicates the year of the city&#x27;s founding. The argent represents steel; the azure, the sea; the anchor, the port; and the ring, metallurgy.

=== City holidays ===
Holidays exclusive to Mariupol include:

* Day of liberation of the city from fascist aggressors (on 10 September)
* Day of the city (the Sunday after the day of liberation of Mariupol in September)
* Day of the metallurgist – a professional holiday for many citizens
* Day of the machine engineer
* Day of the seaman and other professional holidays

== Demographics ==
As of 1 December 2014, the city&#x27;s population was 477,992. Over the last century the population has grown nearly twelvefold. The city is populated by Ukrainians, Russians, Pontic Greeks (including Caucasus Greeks and Tatar- and Turkish-speaking but Greek Orthodox Christian Urums), Belarusians, Armenians, Jews, etc. The main language is Russian.

The population fell precipitously as the result of the siege of the city in 2022. Per Ukrainian sources it was 120 thousand in 2023, while according to Russian administration the city population was approximately 280 thousand.

=== Ethnic structure ===
The city is largely and traditionally Russian-speaking, while ethnically the population is divided about evenly between Ukrainians and Russians. There is also a significant ethnic Greek minority in the city.

In 2002, ethnic Ukrainians made up the largest percentage (48.7%) but less than half of the population; the second greatest ethnicity was Russian (44.4%). A June–July 2017 survey indicated that Ukrainians had grown to 59% of Mariupol&#x27;s population and the Russian share had dropped to 33%.

The city is home to the largest population of Pontic Greeks in Ukraine (&quot;Greeks of Priazovye&quot;) at 21,900, with 31,400 more in the six nearby rural areas, totaling about 70% of the Pontic Greek population of the area and 60% for the country.

=== Language structure ===
The city is predominantly Russian speaking. From 60% to 80% of Ukrainian-language inhabitants communicate in Surzhyk, due to the large influence of Russian culture.

Most Greek-speaking villages in the region speak a dialect called Rumeíka, a branch of Pontic Greek. About 17 villages speak this language today. Modern scholars distinguish five subdialects of Rumeíka according to their similarity to standard Modern Greek. This was derived from the dialect of the original Pontic settlers from the Crimea. Although Rumeíka is often described as a Pontic dialect, the situation is more nuanced. Arguments can be brought both for Rumeíka&#x27;s similarity to Pontic Greek and to the Northern Greek dialects. In the view of Maxim Kisilier, while the Rumeíka dialect shares some features with both the Pontic Greek and the Northern Greek dialects, it is better considered on its own terms as a separate Greek dialect, or even a group of dialects.
The village of Anadol speaks Pontic proper, being settled from the Pontos in the 19th century. After the October Revolution of 1917, a Rumaiic revival occurred in the region. The Soviet administration established a Greek-Rumaiic theater, several magazines and a newspaper, and a number of Rumaiic language schools. The best Rumaiic poet Georgi Kostoprav created a Rumaiic poetic language for his work. This process was reversed in 1937 as Kostoprav and many other Rumaiics and Urums were killed as part of Joseph Stalin&#x27;s national policies.

A new attempt to preserve a sense of ethnic Rumaiic identity started in the mid-1980s. The Ukrainian scholar Andriy Biletsky created a new Slavonic alphabet for Greek speakers. Though a number of writers and poets make use of this alphabet, the population of the region rarely uses it. The Rumaiic language is declining rapidly, most endangered by the standard Modern Greek which is taught in schools and the local university. The latest investigations by Alexandra Gromova demonstrate that there is still hope that elements of the Rumaiic population will continue to use the dialect.

Along with those speaking Rumeíka, there were and are a number of Tatar-speaking Orthodox villages, the so-called Urums, which is the Tatar term for Romaios or Rumei. This subdivision had already occurred in Crimea before the settlement of the Azov Sea steppe region by Pontic Greeks which began following the fall of the Empire of Trebizond in northeastern Anatolia in 1461. It occurred on a larger scale after the end of the Russo-Turkish War in 1779, as part of the Russian policy to populate and develop the region while depriving the Crimea of an economically active part of its population. Though Greek- and Tatar-speaking settlers lived separately, the language of the Urums was the lingua franca of the region for a long time, being called the language of the bazaar.

There are also a number of settlements of other ethnic communities, including Germans, Bulgarians, and Albanians (though the meanings of all such terms in this context is open to dispute).

Native languages of the population as of the All-Russian Empire Census in 1897:

<text>&quot;What&#x27;d I Say&quot; (or &quot;What I Say&quot;) is an American rhythm and blues song by Ray Charles, released in 1959. As a single divided into two parts, it was one of the first soul songs. The composition was improvised one evening late in 1958 when Charles, his orchestra, and backup singers had played their entire set list at a show and still had time left; the response from many audiences was so enthusiastic that Charles announced to his producer that he was going to record it.

After his run of R&amp;B hits, this song finally broke Charles into mainstream pop music and itself sparked a new subgenre of R&amp;B titled soul, finally putting together all the elements that Charles had been creating since he recorded &quot;I Got a Woman&quot; in 1954. The gospel and rhumba influences combined with the sexual innuendo in the song made it not only widely popular but very controversial to both white and black audiences. It earned Ray Charles his first gold record and has been one of the most influential songs in R&amp;B and rock and roll history. For the rest of his career, Charles closed every concert with the song. It was added to the National Recording Registry in 2002 and appeared in the 2003 and 2021 versions of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot; list: at number 10 in 2003 and at number 80 in 2021.

==Background==
Ray Charles was 28 years old in 1958, with ten years of experience recording primarily rhythm and blues music for the Downbeat and Swingtime record labels, in a style similar to that of Nat King Cole and Charles Brown. Charles signed with Atlantic Records in 1952 where producers Ahmet Ertegun and Jerry Wexler encouraged him to broaden his repertoire. Wexler would later remember that Atlantic Records&#x27; success came not from the artists&#x27; experience, but the enthusiasm for the music: &quot;We didn&#x27;t know shit about making records, but we were having fun&quot;. Ertegun and Wexler found that a hands-off approach was the best way of encouraging Charles. Wexler later said, &quot;I realized the best thing I could do with Ray was leave him alone&quot;.

From 1954 into the 1960s Charles toured for 300 days a year with a seven-piece orchestra. He employed another Atlantic singing trio named the Cookies and renamed them the Raelettes when they backed him up on the road. In 1954 Charles began merging gospel sounds and instruments with lyrics that addressed more secular issues. His first attempt was in the song &quot;I Got a Woman&quot;, based either on the melodies from the gospel songs, The Southern Tones &quot;It Must Be Jesus&quot; or an uptempo, &quot;I Got a Savior (Way Across Jordan)&quot;. It was the first Ray Charles record that got attention from white audiences, but it made some black audiences uncomfortable with its black gospel derivatives; Charles later stated that the joining of gospel and R&amp;B was not a conscious decision.

In December 1958, he had a hit on the R&amp;B charts with &quot;Night Time Is the Right Time&quot;, an ode to carnality that was sung between Charles and one of the Raelettes, Margie Hendricks, with whom Charles was having an affair. Since 1956 Charles had also included a Wurlitzer electric piano on tour because he did not trust the tuning and quality of the pianos provided him at every venue. On the occasions he would play it, he was derided by other musicians.

==Composition and recording==
According to Charles&#x27; autobiography, &quot;What&#x27;d I Say&quot; was accidental when he improvised it to fill time at the end of a concert in December 1958. He asserted that he never tested songs on audiences before recording them, but &quot;What&#x27;d I Say&quot; was an exception. Charles himself did not recall where the concert took place, but Mike Evans in &quot;Ray Charles: The Birth of Soul&quot; placed the show in Brownsville, Pennsylvania. Shows were played at &quot;meal dances&quot; which typically ran four hours with a half-hour break, and would end around 1 or 2 in the morning. Charles and his orchestra had exhausted their set list after midnight, but had 12 minutes left to fill. He told the Raelettes, &quot;Listen, I&#x27;m going to fool around and y&#x27;all just follow me&quot;.

Starting on the electric piano, Charles played what felt right: a series of riffs, switching then to a regular piano for four choruses backed up by a unique Latin conga tumbao rhythm on drums. The song changed when Charles began singing simple, improvised unconnected verses (&quot;Hey Mama don&#x27;t you treat me wrong / Come and love your daddy all night long / All right now / Hey hey / All right&quot;). Charles used gospel elements in a twelve-bar blues structure. Some of the first lines (&quot;See the gal with the red dress on / She can do the Birdland all night long&quot;) are influenced by a boogie-woogie style that Ahmet Ertegun attributes to Clarence &quot;Pinetop&quot; Smith, who used to call out to dancers on the dance floor, telling them what to do through his lyrics. In the middle of the song, however, Charles indicated that the Raelettes should repeat what he was doing, and the song transformed into a call and response between Charles, the Raelettes, and the horn section in the orchestra as they called out to each other in ecstatic shouts and moans and blasts from the horns.

The audience reacted immediately; Charles could feel the room shaking and bouncing as the crowd was dancing. Many audience members approached Charles at the end of the show to ask where they could purchase the record. Charles and the orchestra performed it again several nights in a row with the same reaction at each show. He called Jerry Wexler to say he had something new to record, later writing, &quot;I don&#x27;t believe in giving myself advance notices, but I figured this song merited it&quot;.

The Atlantic Records studio had just purchased an 8-track recorder, and recording engineer Tom Dowd was familiarizing himself with how it worked. On February 18, 1959, Charles and his orchestra finally recorded &quot;What&#x27;d I Say&quot; at Atlantic&#x27;s small studio. Dowd recalled that it did not seem special at the time of recording. It was second of two songs during the session and Charles, the producers, and the band were more impressed with the first one at the session, &quot;Tell the Truth&quot;: &quot;We made it like we made all the others. Ray, the gals, and the band live in the small studio, no overdubs. Three or four takes, and it was done. Next!&quot; In retrospect, Ahmet Ertegun&#x27;s brother Nesuhi credits the extraordinary sound of the song to the restricted size of the studio and the technologically advanced recording equipment used; the sound quality is clear enough to hear Charles slapping his leg in time with the song when the music stops during the calls and responses. The song was recorded in only a few takes because Charles and the orchestra had perfected it while touring.

Dowd, however, had two problems during the recording. &quot;What&#x27;d I Say&quot; lasted over seven and a half minutes when the normal length of radio-played songs was around two and a half minutes. Furthermore, although the lyrics were not obscene, the sounds Charles and the Raelettes made in their calls and responses during the song worried Dowd and the producers. A previous recording called &quot;Money Honey&quot; by Clyde McPhatter had been banned in Georgia and Ahmet Ertegun and Wexler released McPhatter&#x27;s song despite the ban, risking arrest. Ray Charles was aware of the controversy in &quot;What&#x27;d I Say&quot;: &quot;I&#x27;m not one to interpret my own songs, but if you can&#x27;t figure out &#x27;What I Say&#x27;, then something&#x27;s wrong. Either that, or you&#x27;re not accustomed to the sweet sounds of love.&quot;

Dowd solved the recording issues by mixing three versions of the song. Some call-outs of &quot;Shake that thing!&quot; were removed, and the song was split into two three-and-a-half minute sides of a single record, titling the song &quot;What&#x27;d I Say Part I&quot; and &quot;What&#x27;d I Say Part II&quot;. The recorded version divides the parts with a false ending where the orchestra stops and the Raelettes and orchestra members beg Charles to continue, then goes on to a frenzied finale. Dowd later stated after hearing the final recording that not releasing the record was never an option: &quot;we knew it was going to be a hit record, no question.&quot; It was held for the summer and released in June 1959.

== Personnel ==
The following musicians played on the session for &quot;What&#x27;d I Say&quot;.
* Ray Charles – piano, Wurlitzer electronic piano, lead vocals
* David Newman – tenor saxophone, alto saxophone
* Bennie Crawford – alto saxophone, baritone saxophone
* Edgar Willis – double bass
* Milt Turner – drums
*The Raelettes – backing vocals

==Reception==
&quot;Billboard&quot; magazine initially gave &quot;What&#x27;d I Say&quot; a tepid review: &quot;He shouts out in percussive style ... Side two is the same.&quot; The secretary at Atlantic Records started getting calls from distributors, however. Radio stations refused to play it because it was too sexually charged, but Atlantic refused to take the records back from stores. A slightly sanitized version was released in July 1959 in response to the complaints, and the song hit number 82. A week later it was at 43, then 26. In contrast to their earlier review, &quot;Billboard&quot; several weeks later wrote that the song was &quot;the strongest pop record that the artist has done to date&quot;. Within weeks &quot;What&#x27;d I Say&quot; topped out at number one on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s R&amp;B singles chart, number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;What&#x27;d I Say&quot; was Ray Charles&#x27; first gold record. It also became Atlantic Records&#x27; best-selling song at the time.

&quot;What&#x27;d I Say&quot; was banned by many black and white radio stations because of, as one critic noted, &quot;the dialogue between himself and his backing singers that started in church and ended up in the bedroom&quot;. The erotic nature was obvious to listeners, but a deeper aspect of the fusion between black gospel music and R&amp;B troubled many black audiences. Music, as was much of American society, was also segregated, and some critics complained that gospel was not only being appropriated by secular musicians, but it was being marketed to white listeners. During several concerts in the 1960s, the crowds became so frenetic and the shows so resembled revival meetings while Charles performed &quot;What&#x27;d I Say&quot; that the police were called in, when the organizers became worried that riots might break out. The moral controversy surrounding the song has been attributed to its popularity; Charles later acknowledged in an interview that the beat was catchy, but it was the suggestive lyrics that attracted listeners: &quot; &#x27;See the girl with the diamond ring. She knows how to shake that thing.&#x27; It wasn&#x27;t the diamond ring that got &#x27;em.&quot; 

&quot;What&#x27;d I Say&quot; was Ray Charles&#x27; first crossover hit into the growing genre of rock and roll. He seized the opportunity of his immense newfound success and announced to Ertegun and Wexler that he was considering signing with ABC-Paramount Records (later renamed ABC Records) later in 1959. While he was in negotiations with ABC-Paramount, Atlantic Records released an album of his hits, titled &quot;What&#x27;d I Say&quot;.

==Legacy==
Michael Lydon, another of Charles&#x27; biographers, summarized the impact of the song: &quot;&#x27;What&#x27;d I Say&#x27; was a monster with footprints bigger than its numbers. Daringly different, wildly sexy, and fabulously danceable, the record riveted listeners. When &#x27;What&#x27;d I Say&#x27; came on the radio, some turned it off in disgust, but millions turned the volume up to blasting and sang &#x27;Unnnh, unnnh, oooooh, oooooh&#x27; along with Ray and the Raelets. [It] became the life of a million parties, the spark of as many romances, and a song to date the Summer by.&quot;

The song was also influential in the United Kingdom. Paul McCartney was immediately struck by the song and knew when he heard it that he wanted to be involved in making music. George Harrison remembered an all-night party he attended in 1959 where the song was played for eight hours non-stop: &quot;It was one of the best records I ever heard.&quot; While the Beatles were developing their sound in Hamburg, they played &quot;What&#x27;d I Say&quot; at every show, trying to see how long they could make the song last and using the audience in the call and response, with which they found immense popularity. The opening electric piano in the song was the first John Lennon had ever heard, and he tried to replicate it with his guitar. Lennon later credited Charles&#x27; opening of &quot;What&#x27;d I Say&quot; to the birth of songs dominated by guitar riffs. 

When Mick Jagger sang for the first time with the band that would become the Rolling Stones, he performed a duet of &quot;What&#x27;d I Say&quot;. Eric Burdon from the Animals, Steve Winwood of the Spencer Davis Group, Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys, and Van Morrison counted the song as a major influence on why they became interested in music and incorporated it into their shows. Music historian Robert Stephens attributes the birth of soul music to &quot;What&#x27;d I Say&quot; when gospel and blues were successfully joined; the new genre of music was matured by later musicians such as James Brown and Aretha Franklin. &quot;In an instant, the music called Soul comes into being. Hallelujah!&quot; wrote musician Lenny Kaye in a retrospective of Atlantic Records artists.

In the late 1950s, rock and roll was faltering as its major stars dropped from public view. Elvis Presley was drafted, and Buddy Holly and Eddie Cochran died in 1959 and 1960 respectively. Music and culture critic Nelson George disagrees with music historians who attest the last two years of the 1950s were barren of talent, pointing to Charles and this song in particular. George writes that the themes in Charles&#x27; work were very similar to the young rebels who popularized rock and roll, writing

By breaking down the division between pulpit and bandstand, recharging blues concerns with transcendental fervor, unashamedly linking the spiritual and the sexual, Charles made pleasure (physical satisfaction) and joy (divine enlightenment) seem the same thing. By doing so he brought the realities of the Saturday-night sinner and Sunday-morning worshipper—so often one and the same—into raucous harmony.

&quot;What&#x27;d I Say&quot; has been covered by many artists in many different styles. Jerry Lee Lewis found particular success with his rendition in 1961, which peaked at number 30 and spent eight weeks on the charts. The following year, Bobby Darin&#x27;s version reached #21 in Canada. Elvis Presley used the song in a large dance scene in his 1964 film &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot; and released it on the B-side of the title song. Cliff Richard, Eric Clapton with John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers, Rare Earth, Eddie Cochran, Nancy Sinatra, and Sammy Davis Jr., all put their own style on the song. Charles noticed, later writing &quot;I saw that many of the stations which had banned the tune started playing it when it was covered by white artists. That seemed strange to me, as though white sex was cleaner than black sex. But once they began playing the white version, they lifted the ban and also played the original.&quot;

Charles spoofed this double standard on the television comedy show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 1977. He hosted an episode and had the original band he toured with in the 1950s to join him. In one skit, he tells a producer that he wants to record the song, but the producer tells him that a white band named the &#x27;Young Caucasians&#x27;, composed of beaming white teenagers, are to record it first, which they do on the show, in a chaste, sanitized, and unexciting performance. When Charles and his band counter with their original version, Garrett Morris tells them, &quot;Sorry. That&#x27;ll never make it.&quot;

Charles closed every show he played for the rest of his career with the song, later stating, What&#x27;d I Say&#x27; is my last song onstage. When I do &#x27;What&#x27;d I Say&#x27;, you don&#x27;t have to worry about it—that&#x27;s the end of me; there ain&#x27;t no encore, no nothin&#x27;. I&#x27;m finished!&quot;

It was ranked tenth on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;, with the summary, &quot;Charles&#x27; grunt-&#x27;n&#x27;-groan exchanges with the Raeletts were the closest you could get to the sound of orgasm on Top Forty radio during the Eisenhower era&quot;. In 2000, it ranked number 43 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Songs in Rock and Roll&quot; and number 96 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Dance Songs&quot;, being the oldest song in the latter ranking. The same year it was chosen by National Public Radio as one of the 100 most influential songs of the 20th century. The song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame also in 2000. Bruce Conner&#x27;s 1962 collage film &quot;Cosmic Ray&quot; uses a live recording of &quot;What&#x27;d I Say&quot; as its soundtrack. A central scene in the 2004 biopic &quot;Ray&quot; features the improvisation of the song performed by Jamie Foxx, who won an Academy Award for his portrayal of Charles. For its historical, artistic, and cultural significance, the Library of Congress added it to the U.S. National Recording Registry in 2002. The Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame featured it as one of 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll in 2007.

<text>An anti-submarine weapon (ASW) is any one of a number of devices that are intended to act against a submarine and its crew, to destroy (sink) the vessel or reduce its capability as a weapon of war. In its simplest sense, an anti-submarine weapon is usually a projectile, missile or bomb that is optimized to destroy submarines.

==History==

===Before World War I===
Prior to about 1890, naval weapons were only used against surface shipping. With the rise of the military submarine after this time, countermeasures were considered for use against them. The first submarine installation of torpedo tubes was in 1885 and the first ship was sunk by a submarine-launched torpedo in 1887. There were only two ways of countering the military submarine initially: ramming them or sinking them with gunfire. However, once they were submerged, they were largely immune until they had to surface again. By the start of the First World War there were nearly 300 submarines in service with another 80 in production.

===World War I===
World War I marked the first earnest conflict involving significant use of submarines and consequently marked the beginning of major efforts to counter that threat. In particular, the United Kingdom was desperate to defeat the U-boat threat against British merchant shipping. When the bombs that it employed were found to be ineffective it began equipping its destroyers with simple depth charges that could be dropped into the water around a suspected submarine&#x27;s location. During this period it was found that explosions of these charges were more efficient if the charges were set to explode below or above the submarine. However, many other techniques were used, including minefields, barrages and Q-ships and the use of cryptanalysis against intercepted radio messages. The airship (&quot;blimp&quot;) was used to drop bombs but fixed-wing aircraft were mostly used for reconnaissance. However, the most effective countermeasure was the convoy. In 1918 U-boat losses became unbearably high. During the war a total of 178 U-boats were sunk, by the following causes:

*Mines: 58;
*Depth charges: 30;
*Gunfire: 20;
*Submarine torpedoes: 20;
*Ramming: 19;
*Unknown: 19;
*Accidents: 7;
*Other (including bombs): 2

British submarines operated in the Baltic, North Sea and Atlantic as well as the Mediterranean and Black Sea. Most of the losses were due to mines but two were torpedoed. French, Italian and Russian submarines were also destroyed.

Before the war ended, the need for forward-throwing weapons had been recognized by the British and trials began. Hydrophones had been developed and were becoming effective as detection and location devices. Also, aircraft and airships had flown with depth bombs (aerial depth charges), albeit quite small ones with poor explosives. In addition, the specialist hunter-killer submarine had appeared, HMS &quot;R-1&quot;.

===Inter-war ===
The main developments in this period were in detection, with both active sonar (ASDIC) and radar becoming effective. The British integrated the sonar with fire control and weapons to form an integrated system for warships. Germany was banned from having a submarine fleet but began construction in secret during the 1930s. When war broke out it had 21 submarines at sea.

In the inter-war period Britain and France had experimented with several novel types of submarine. New sonars and weapons were developed for them.

===World War II===

====Atlantic/Mediterranean Theatre====
By the time of World War II, anti-submarine weapons had been developed somewhat, but during that war, there was a renewal of all-out submarine warfare by Germany as well as widespread use of submarines by most of the other combatants. The effective use of depth charges required the combined resources and skills of many individuals during an attack. Sonar information, helmsmen, depth charge crews and the movement of other ships had to be carefully coordinated in order to deliver a successful depth charge attack. As the Battle of the Atlantic wore on, British and Commonwealth forces in particular proved particularly adept at depth charge tactics, and formed some of the first destroyer hunter-killer groups to actively seek out and destroy German U-boats.
Air-dropped depth bombs were normally set to explode at a shallow depth, while the submarine was crash-diving to escape attack. Aircraft were very successful in not only attacking U-boats, but also in disrupting U-boats from carrying out attacks against ships. Some were fitted with a searchlight as well as bombs.

A host of new anti-submarine weapons were developed. Forward-throwing anti-submarine mortars were introduced in 1942 to prevent loss of sonar contact. These mortars, the first being Hedgehog, fired a pattern of small depth charges. One type of charge was used to create entire patterns of explosions underwater around a potential enemy, while the second type of round was fitted with contact detonators, meaning the warhead exploded only upon contact with the submarine. A later design enabled a pursuing destroyer or destroyer escort to maintain continual sonar contact until a definite &quot;hit&quot; was achieved. Additionally, new weapons were designed for use by aircraft, rapidly increasing their importance in fighting submarines. The development of the FIDO (Mk 24 mine) anti-submarine homing torpedo in 1943 (which could be dropped from aircraft) was a significant contributor to the rising number of German sub sinkings.
====Pacific Theater====
Japan, the United States, Great Britain, The Netherlands, and Australia all employed anti-submarine forces in the Pacific Theater during World War II. Because the Japanese Navy tended to utilize its submarines against capital ships such as cruisers, battleships and aircraft carriers, U.S. and Allied anti-submarine efforts concentrated their work in support of fleet defense.

Early Japanese submarines were not very maneuverable under water, could not dive very deep, and lacked radar. Later in the war, Japanese submarines were fitted with radar scanning equipment for improved hunting while surfaced. However, these radar-equipped submarines were in some instances sunk due to the ability of U.S. radar receivers to detect their tell-tale scanning emissions. For example, sank three Japanese radar-equipped submarines in the span of four days. In 1944, U.S. anti-submarine forces began to employ the FIDO (Mk 24 mine) air-dropped homing torpedo against submerged Japanese subs with considerable success.

In contrast, Allied submarines were largely committed against Japanese merchant shipping. As a consequence, Japanese anti-submarine forces were forced to spread their efforts to defend the entirety of their merchant shipping lanes, not only to resupply their forces, but also to continue the necessary importation of war material to the Japanese home islands.

At first, Japanese anti-submarine defenses proved less than effective against U.S. submarines. Japanese sub detection gear was not as advanced as that of some other nations. The primary Japanese anti-submarine weapon for most of WWII was the depth charge, and Japanese depth charge attacks by its surface forces initially proved fairly unsuccessful against U.S. fleet submarines. Unless caught in shallow water, a U.S. submarine commander could normally dive to a deeper depth in order to escape destruction, sometimes using temperature gradient barriers to escape pursuit. Additionally, during the first part of the war, the Japanese tended to set their depth charges too shallow, unaware that U.S. submarines possessed the ability to dive beyond 150 feet.

Unfortunately, the deficiencies of Japanese depth-charge tactics were revealed in a June 1943 press conference held by U.S. Congressman Andrew J. May, a member of the House Military Affairs Committee who had visited the Pacific theater and received many confidential intelligence and operational briefings. At the press conference, May revealed that American submarines had a high survivability because Japanese depth charges were fused to explode at too shallow a depth, typically 100 feet (because Japanese forces believed U.S. subs did not normally exceed this depth). Various press associations sent this story over their wires, and many newspapers, including one in Honolulu, thoughtlessly published it. Soon enemy depth charges were rearmed to explode at a more effective depth of 250 feet. Vice Admiral Charles A. Lockwood, commander of the U.S. submarine fleet in the Pacific, later estimated that May&#x27;s revelation cost the navy as many as ten submarines and 800 crewmen.

In addition to resetting their depth charges to deeper depths, Japanese anti-submarine forces also began employing autogyro aircraft and Magnetic Anomaly Detection (MAD) equipment to sink U.S. subs, particularly those plying major shipping channels or operating near the home islands. Despite this onslaught, U.S. sub sinkings of Japanese shipping continued to increase at a furious rate as more U.S. subs deployed each month to the Pacific. By the end of the war, U.S. submarines had destroyed more Japanese shipping than all other weapons combined, including aircraft.

===Post-war developments===

The Cold War brought a new kind of conflict to submarine warfare. This war of development had both the United States and Soviet Union racing to develop better, stealthier and more potent submarines while consequently developing better and more accurate anti-submarine weapons and new delivery platforms, including the helicopter.

Attack submarines (SSKs and SSNs) were developed to include faster, longer range and more discriminating torpedoes. This, coupled with improvements to sonar systems, made ballistic missile submarines more vulnerable to attack submarines and also increased the anti-surface warfare (ASuW) capabilities of attack subs. SSBNs themselves as well as cruise-missile submarines (SSGNs) were fitted with increasingly more accurate and longer range missiles and received the greatest noise reduction technology. 
To counter this increasing threat torpedoes were honed to target submarines more effectively and new anti-submarine missiles and rockets were developed to give ships a longer-range anti-submarine capability. Ships, submarines and maritime patrol aircraft (MPA) also received increasingly effective technology for locating submarines, e.g. magnetic anomaly detectors (MAD) and improved sonar.

==Anti-submarine technology==
The first component of an anti-submarine attack is detection: anti-sub weapons cannot be successfully employed without first locating the enemy submarine.

===Detection equipment===

====Optical detection====
Initial methods involved making visual contact with the submarine, and remains an important method of target confirmation. This may now be supplemented by thermal techniques. However, the low &quot;indiscretion rate&quot; of modern submarines means that optical detection is now less successful.

====Radio intercept====
The use of the &quot;wolf pack&quot; by submarines in both the first and second World Wars allowed interception of radio signals. Though these were encrypted, they were broken by the British at &quot;Room 40&quot; in the First World War and by Bletchley Park during the second. This allowed convoys to be diverted and hunter-killer groups to be targeted on the pack. Submarines now transmit using methods that are less susceptible to intercept.

In World War II, high frequency direction finding (HF/DF or &quot;Huff-duff) was used by Allied escort vessels to detect submarines making position or sighting reports. The direction finding technology was not thought feasible for installation on a warship by the Kriegsmarine and they attributed successes of Huff-duff to radar technology of a performance that did not exist at the time. The standard escort tactic was to steer at speed in the direction of an HF/DF bearing until the target submarine was sighted (often visually, but sometimes on radar) and open fire before the submarine dived. If the submarine dived before being shelled, it could be hunted on sonar.

====Radar====
Radar was a prime tool in World War II for locating surfaced submarines. After development of the snorkel, and then of nuclear-powered submarines, submarines rarely surfaced outside their home port, rendering direct radar detection largely useless. However, it is possible that radar can detect the surface effects produced by a submarine.

====Sonar====
Since World War II, sonar has emerged as the primary method of underwater detection of submarines. The most effective type has varied between active and passive, depending on the countermeasures taken by the submarine. Its versatility has increased with the development of air-dropped sonobuoys, which relay sonar signals to overhead aircraft, dipping sonar from helicopters and fixed long range systems.

====Magnetic anomaly detection====
A magnetic anomaly detector (MAD) is an electronic magnetometer designed to measure magnetic field variations caused by large metal objects, such as the steel hull of a submarine. Before the development of sonar buoys, MAD gear was often installed in aircraft to pick up shallow-submerged submarines. It is still used today.

====Other non-acoustic methods====
Submarine detector loops were one of the first ways of finding the presence of an underwater submarine. The &quot;sniffer&quot; for detecting diesel exhausts was developed in the Second World War. More recently indirect methods of submarine detection have been tried, mainly via its wake.

==Anti-submarine weapons==

Anti-submarine weapons can be divided into three categories according to their mode of operation: guided weapons, non-guided weapons, and rocket and mortar weapons.

Guided anti-submarine weapons, such as torpedoes, seek out the submarine, either via its own sensors or from the launching platform&#x27;s sensors. The advantage with this type of weapon is that it requires a relatively small payload as it detonates in direct contact or within a very close proximity of the submarine. The disadvantage is that this type of weapon can be decoyed and is adversely affected by stealth features of the submarine.

Non-guided anti-submarine weapons, such as mines and depth charges, are &quot;dumb&quot; weapons that has to be carried to the submarine or that the submarine has to come in close proximity of. This is to some degree compensated by a heavy payload, in some mines exceeding half a metric ton, but since the effect of an underwater explosion decreases with a factor of the distance cubed, an increase in payload of a depth charge from 100 to 200 kg would not result in more than a few meters in killing radius.

The main advantage of rockets and mortar weapons, such as anti-submarine grenades and anti-submarine rockets, is their rapid response time as they are carried through the air to the target. Once dropped on top of the target, they also have the advantage of not being sensitive to decoys or stealth features. A hybrid of this category is the rocket launched torpedo, which is carried to the proximity of the target via a rocket; this then reduces the response time and gives the submarine less time to undertake countermeasures or evasive maneuvers.

Finally, a submarine can also be destroyed by means of artillery fire and missiles in the rare case that a modern submarine surfaces, but these weapons are not specifically designed for submarines and their importance in modern anti-submarine warfare is very limited.

===Guns===
Gunfire has been used to disable submarines from the First World War and onwards. After the First World War, special ASW shells were developed for medium calibre naval guns. An example of the modern ASW shell is Kingfisher gun-launched anti-submarine munition.

===Depth charge===

Perhaps the simplest of the anti-submarine weapons, the depth charge, is a large canister filled with explosives and set to explode at a predetermined depth. The concussive effects of the explosion could damage a submarine from a distance, though a depth charge explosion had to be very close to break the submarine&#x27;s hull. Air-dropped depth charges were referred to as &#x27;depth bombs&#x27;; these were sometimes fitted with an aerodynamic casing.

Surface-launched depth charges are typically used in a barrage manner in order to cause significant damage through continually battering the submarine with concussive blasts. Depth charges improved considerably since their first employment in World War I. To match improvements in submarine design, pressure-sensing mechanisms and explosives were improved during World War II to provide greater shock power and a charge that would reliably explode over a wide range of depth settings.

Aerial-launched depth bombs are dropped in twos and threes in pre-computed patterns, either from airplanes, helicopters, or blimps. Since aerial attacks normally resulted from surprising the submarine on the surface, air-dropped depth bombs were usually timed to explode at a shallow depth, while the submarine was in the process of making a crash dive. In many cases destruction was not achieved, but the submarine was nonetheless forced to retire for repairs.

Early depth charges were designed to be rolled into the water off of the stern of a fast ship. The ship had to be moving fast enough to avoid the concussion of the depth charge blast. Later designs allowed the depth charge to be hurled some distance from the ship, allowing slower ships to operate them and for larger areas to be covered.

Today, depth charges not only can be dropped by aircraft or surface ships, but can also be carried by missiles to their target.

===Anti-submarine unguided projectiles===

====Anti-submarine mortar====

With the discovery that depth charges rarely scored a kill by hitting a submarine, but instead were most effective in barrages, it was found that similar or better effects could be obtained by larger numbers of smaller explosions. The anti-submarine mortar is actually an array of spigot mortars, designed to fire off a number of small explosives simultaneously and create an array of explosions around a submarine&#x27;s position. These were often called &quot;Hedgehogs&quot; after the name given to a World War II British design. Later ASW mortar shells were fitted with impact detonators that fired only after actual contact with the hull of the submarine, allowing sonar crews to maintain a constant sound track until a hit was achieved.

The Hedgehog fired twenty-four 14.5 kg charges whereas a later development called the &quot;Squid&quot; fired three full-sized depth charges. A further development called &quot;Limbo&quot; was used into the 1960s, and this used 94 kg charges.

A development of the anti-submarine mortar, designed primarily for the exceptionally challenging task of littoral anti-submarine operations, utilizes a shaped charge warhead. An example of this is the Saab Dynamics Elma ASW-600 and the upgraded .

====Anti-submarine rockets====
Anti-submarine rockets are very similar to anti-submarine morters. Some examples of the latest anti-submarine rockets are Roketsan ASW rocket launcher system, RBU-6000, RBU-1200.

===Mine===

Similar to naval mines designed to defeat surface ships, mines can be laid to wait for an enemy submarine to pass by and then explode to cause concussive damage to the submarine. Some are mobile and upon detection they can move towards the submarine until within lethal range. There has even been development of mines that have the ability to launch an encapsulated torpedo at a detected submarine. Mines can be laid by submarines, ships, or aircraft.

===Anti-submarine torpedo===

The early anti-submarine torpedoes were straight-running types and usually a group was fired in case the target manoeuvred. They can be divided into two main types, the heavyweight which are fired from submarines, and the lightweight which are fired from ships, dropped from aircraft (both fixed wing and helicopters) or delivered by rocket. Later ones used active/passive sonar homing and wire-guidance. Pattern running and wake homing torpedoes have also been developed.

The first successful homing torpedo was introduced by Nazi Germany&#x27;s &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; for use by its U-boat arm against Allied shipping. After capturing several of these weapons, along with independent research, the United States introduced the FIDO air-dropped homing torpedo (also called the Mark 24 &#x27;mine&#x27; as a cover) in 1943. FIDO was designed to breach the steel pressure hull of a submarine but not necessarily cause a catastrophic implosion, forcing the now-crippled submarine to surface where the submarine and crew might possibly be captured. After World War II, homing torpedoes became one of the primary anti-submarine weapons, used by most of the world&#x27;s naval powers. Aircraft continued to be a primary launching platform, including the newly available helicopter, though homing torpedoes can also be launched from surface ships or submarines. However, the torpedo&#x27;s inherent limitations in speed of attack and detection by the target have led to the development of missile-borne anti-submarine weapons that can be delivered practically on top of the enemy submarine, such as ASROC.

On ships the torpedoes are generally launched from a triple-barreled launcher by compressed air. These may be mounted on deck or below. On submarines torpedoes have been carried externally as well as internally. The latter have been launched in the past by stern tubes as well as by the more normal forward ones.

Aircraft delivery platforms have included both unmanned helicopters, such as the US DASH, and manned ones such as British Westland Wasp. The helicopter may be solely a weapons carrier or it can have submarine detection capabilities.

===Anti-submarine missiles===

Some examples of the latest anti-submarine missiles are SMART, RUM-139 VL-ASROC, RPK-9 Medvedka, CY-5 and MILAS. The missile type is differ from other types of missiles in that instead of having a warhead which the missiles delivers to the target directly and explodes, they carry another anti-submarine weapon to a point of the surface where that weapon is dropped in the water to complete the attack. The missile itself launches from its platform and travels to the designated delivery point. 

The major advantages of anti-submarine missiles are range and speed of attack. Torpedoes are not very fast compared to a missile, nor as long-ranged, and are much easier for a submarine to detect. Anti-sub missiles are usually delivered from surface vessels, offering the surface escort an all-weather, all-sea-conditions instant readiness weapon to attack time-urgent targets that no other delivery system can match for speed of response. They have the added advantage that they are under the direct control of the escort vessel&#x27;s commander, and unlike air-delivered weapons cannot be diverted to other taskings, or be dependent on weather or maintenance availability. Aircraft delivery can be further compromised by low fuel state or an expended weapon load. The missile is always available, and at instant readiness. It allows the torpedo or nuclear depth bomb to enter the water practically on top of the submarine&#x27;s position, minimizing the submarine&#x27;s ability to detect and evade the attack. Missiles are also more rapid and accurate in many cases than helicopters or aircraft for dropping torpedoes and depth charges, with a typical interval of 1 to 1.5 minutes from a launch decision to torpedo splashdown. Helicopters frequently take much longer to just get off the escort&#x27;s deck.

==Weapon control systems==
The readiness of weapons was at first determined manually. Early fire control consisted of range measurements and calculation of the submarine&#x27;s course and speed. The aiming point was then manually determined by rule. Later, mechanical computers were used to solve the fire control problem with electrical indication of weapon readiness. Today the weapon firing process is carried out by digital computer with elaborate displays of all relevant parameters.

==ASW Countermeasures==
The main countermeasure the submarine has is stealth; it tries not to be detected. Against the ASW weapon itself, both active and passive countermeasures are used. The former may be a noise making jammer or a decoy providing a signal that looks like a submarine. Passive countermeasures may consist of coatings to minimize a torpedo&#x27;s sonar reflections or an outer hull to provide a stand-off from its explosion. The anti-submarine weapon has to overcome these countermeasures.

<text>Level is an unincorporated community in southern Harlan Township, Warren County, Ohio, United States, which in the 19th century was a station on the Marietta and Cincinnati Railroad and had its own post office, since closed. According to the U.S. Geographic Names Information System (GNIS), an alternate name for this community is &quot;Windsor&quot;.

Level was not officially platted. A post office called Level was established in 1834, and remained in operation until 1905.

<text>Interstate 60 (also known as Interstate 60: Episodes of the Road) is a 2002 American independent road film written and directed by Bob Gale, in his directorial debut, and starring James Marsden, Gary Oldman, Amy Smart, Christopher Lloyd, Chris Cooper, Amy Jo Johnson, Art Evans, Ann-Margret and Kurt Russell, with a cameo by Michael J. Fox. It involves a trip to the fictional town of Danver, Colorado.

== Plot ==
In a bar, a college student affirms that the United States does not have any folktales involving characters who grant wishes. An elderly man then interrupts him, insisting that he is wrong. He mentions O.W. Grant, who carries a pipe in the shape of a monkey&#x27;s head. Grant travels the country granting wishes to strangers, usually messing with them in the process. However, if he likes you, he will play it straight.

Meanwhile, Neal Oliver aspires to be an artist, despite the lack of support from his father and girlfriend. At a party for his 22nd birthday, O.W. Grant is the waiter who serves the cake. While blowing out the candles, Neal wishes for an answer to his life. His father responds by handing him an admission letter to law school that Neal does not want to attend. The family goes outside to look at the red convertible that Neal&#x27;s dad bought him as a gift, but Neal notices that the car was clearly meant for his dad and not him. Neal is later struck on the head by a falling bucket.

Neal wakes up in the hospital, where a doctor named Ray comes in and does a sight test using playing cards. Neal has to name the suit on the cards. Neal asks if he got it right, and Ray points out that the cards actually had red spades and black hearts, emphasizing that things are not always what they seem.

After leaving the hospital, Neal sees a woman that he has been dreaming about in a billboard advertisement, but the billboard company insists that the billboard is blank. After checking the billboard, Neal sees a new picture of her, this time with a framed inscription &quot;Call 555-1300&quot;. Neal calls the number, and a recorded message says that he has an appointment at 555 Olive Street, Suite 1300.

At the appointment, Ray gives him a package to deliver to a Robin Fields in Danver in Colorado (not &quot;Denver&quot;). Neal will find Danver by taking Interstate 60.

With no Interstate 60 on the roadmap, Neal sets out west and encounters O.W. Grant on the roadside. Grant gives Neal directions to Interstate 60. On his journey, Neal meets a man who can consume unnatural quantities of food and drink; a woman looking for perfect sex; a mother looking for her son, who lives in a city where the population is addicted to a government-controlled drug; a dying ex-advertiser on a crusade to punish dishonesty; and Mrs. James, who runs the Museum of Art Fraud that actually contains real masterpieces posing as fakes.

At the town of Morlaw, where all citizens are lawyers who spend their days suing each other, Neal finds Lynn, the imprisoned woman he has been dreaming about and painting. Lynn met O.W. Grant and wished to find the right guy. They have sex at a motel. Neal also makes a painting of the motel. Neal leaves to deliver the package in Danver, while Lynn stays behind.

On the radio, Neal hears of a reported murderer on the loose, and the description matches his car. He abandons his vehicle to hitchhike. In Danver, Neal meets &quot;Robin Fields&quot;, who turns out to be O.W. Grant. After opening the package (which holds a replacement monkey-head pipe for O.W.&#x27;s broken one), Grant uses his powers to &quot;warp&quot; Neal back in time, where he wakes up in the hospital before he first encountered Ray.

Leaving the hospital, Neal confronts his father and asserts his right to live his life without the latter&#x27;s interference. His sister takes him to an art gallery where Neal sees his painting of the motel – submitted on his behalf by O.W. Grant after Neal had &quot;left it&quot; there. He is approached by Lynn, who in reality works with Danver Publishing, because she took an interest in his painting. She talks about wanting to commission him to do more paintings on roadside motels and diners.

====Deleted scenes====
The DVD includes several deleted scenes and the &quot;bridges&quot; where they would be placed in the film. They include:

* Neal visits an AAA office where he seeks information about Interstate 60 that the service representative repeatedly tells him does not exist. The man explains the American Interstate Highway System to Neal. Neal discovers that if I-60 did exist, it would be oriented west to east and be north of Interstate 40 and south of Interstate 70.
* When told by the man in the bar about O. W. Grant at the film&#x27;s beginning, a waitress tells Neal that she had never seen the man before but he had won a large amount of bets by consuming large quantities of alcohol in a brief time without throwing up or urinating. This is the same man who appears later in a diner and makes similar bets that he can eat large amounts of food without releasing them through similar processes. The man admitted he acquired this quality through a wish from O.W. Grant but did not enjoy it, because in addition to being &quot;able&quot; to eat without stopping, he now &quot;must&quot; do so to avoid starving.
* Neal meets his father in his office saying that he doesn&#x27;t want to be in a pigeon hole. His father says that everyone in the world is in a pigeon hole, even starving artists; there are good pigeon holes and bad pigeon holes so it is better to be in a good one.
* At the beginning of his road journey, Neal receives a call on his car phone but shuts it off narrating that the only freedom left in the 21st Century is to be incommunicado.
* After leaving the hospital at the end of the film, Neal breaks up with his girlfriend who calls him a loser and that artists starving for their work only exist in the previous century.

==Reception==
Robert Koehler, writing in &quot;Variety,&quot; criticized the film&#x27;s &quot;juvenile obviousness&quot; and says that the themes do not feel genuine.

Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes lists 4 reviews, and reports 3 positive and 1 negative review.

<text>In Canada, the Regional Development Agencies (RDA) are the seven federal government agencies responsible for addressing key economic challenges and furthering economic development, diversification, and job creation specific to their respective regions.

The seven agencies and their individual regions are:

* Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency (ACOA) — New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island
* Canada Economic Development for Quebec Regions (CED) — Quebec
* Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario (FedDev Ontario) — southern Ontario
* Federal Economic Development Agency for Northern Ontario (FedNor) — northern Ontario
* Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency (CanNor) — Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut
* Pacific Economic Development Canada (PacifiCan) — British Columbia
* Prairies Economic Development Canada (PrairiesCan) — Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba

PacifiCan and PrairiesCan are the two newest RDAs, which were announced by the Government of Canada on 5 August 2021 as the result of splitting Western Economic Diversification Canada (WD), which covered British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba.

The regional development agencies were brought under the Innovation, Science and Economic Development portfolio by the Mulroney government. RDAs were administered by the Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages with a Deputy Minister and Parliamentary Secretary assigned to each agency. However, in the cabinet announced by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau following the 2021 Canadian federal election, the RDAs were placed back under control of individual cabinet ministers.

== Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency ==
The Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency (ACOA; ) is the Government of Canada&#x27;s agency responsible for helping to create opportunities for economic growth in the Atlantic Provinces by working with the people of the region. ACOA encompasses the provinces of New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island. ACOA offers non-repayable and repayable financial aid. Loans are unsecure and interest-free. Information on funded projects is public but specific information such as how much has been repaid is confidential. 

From the 1980s to 2021, ACOA was overseen by the Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages. Historically, ACOA reported to the Minister for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, but this role was combined with other ministerial roles for regional development agencies to report to one position. In 2021, ACOA and the other RDAs returned to have a dedicated Cabinet minister, the Minister responsible for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency.

In 2014, ACOA assumed responsibility for the direct delivery of economic development programs, services and advocacy in Cape Breton. Prior to 2014, a federal Crown corporation named Enterprise Cape Breton Corporation (ECBC), had a similar function to ACOA with a specific jurisdictional mandate for the whole of Cape Breton Island and a portion of mainland Nova Scotia.

Planned spending for 2015-2016 consisted of $171 million for enterprise development, $89 million for community development, $25 million for internal services, and $11 million for policy, advocacy, and coordination.

=== Atlantic Innovation Fund ===
The Atlantic Innovation Fund (AIF) is a funding program run by the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency to help Canadian organizations in Atlantic Canada to develop innovative products and services. This program is highly competitive. Project proposals go through an extensive external review process.

To be eligible for this program, the project must be based in Atlantic Canada, have a potential commercial value and include a large R&amp;D component. The average funding level is about $2 million per project. Average project duration is about two years.

=== Locations ===
ACOA encompasses the provinces of New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island. Its head office is located at the Blue Cross Centre in Moncton, NB, along with a liaison office in Ottawa.

Other offices of ACOA are located in:

* New Brunswick
** Fredericton (regional office)
** Edmundston
** Miramichi
** Grand Falls (northwest office)
** Tracadie-Sheila

== Canada Economic Development for Quebec Regions ==

Canada Economic Development for Quebec Regions (CED; ; legal name: Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec) is the regional development agency responsible for promoting economic expansion in Quebec by promoting small and medium-sized enterprises and non-profit economic organizations.

Before 1998, CED was called the Federal Office of Regional Development - Quebec. The agency is under the supervision of the Minister of the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec.

Under its Act, which came into effect on 5 October 2005, the object of the Agency is to promote the long-term economic development of the regions of Quebec by giving special attention to those where slow economic growth is prevalent or opportunities for productive employment are inadequate.

CED works with a network of partners, which includes: Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC), Canada Business Network, Investissement Québec, Ministère de l&#x27;Économie et de l&#x27;Innovation Québec (MEI), National Research Council Canada (NRC), and others.

The agency has offices throughout the province. The administrative regions served by CED include: Abitibi-Témiscamingue, Bas-Saint-Laurent, Centre-du-Québec, Chaudière-Appalaches, Côte-Nord, Estrie, Gaspésie–Îles-de-la-Madeleine, Lanaudière, Laurentides, Laval, Mauricie, Montérégie, Montréal, Nord-du-Québec, Outaouais, Québec, and Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean.

== Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency ==

== Federal Economic Development Agency for Northern Ontario ==
The Federal Economic Development Agency for Northern Ontario (FedNor) is a Regional Development Agency whose mission is to address the economic development, diversification and job creation in Northern Ontario.

This is a federal administrative region that extends not only south of the French and Mattawa Rivers, but all the way to Muskoka which is just south of Ontario&#x27;s administrative North. FedNor especially aids women, Franco-Ontarians, youth, and Aboriginal peoples in Ontario. While a lot of progress has been made in achieving FedNor&#x27;s objectives, communities in Northern Ontario continue to face the ongoing economic challenges that necessitate a stable, long-term regional development effort.

Since the beginning of FedNor in 1987, the role in business and economic development throughout the North has grown substantially. As a result, the programs and services that FedNor offers to the communities of Northern Ontario have evolved and improved. The Minister responsible for this agency was originally called the &quot;Minister responsible for the Federal Economic Development Initiative for Northern Ontario&quot;

In 2020, FedNor invested over CA$122 million in 294 initiatives led by local businesses, organizations, and communities, helping to support over 7,300 jobs in Northern Ontario.

FedNor has its main offices in Sudbury, Sault Ste. Marie, and Thunder Bay; as well as offices located in North Bay, Timmins, and Kenora.

===Controversy===
Under prior minister Andy Mitchell, FedNor&#x27;s service area was expanded to include many rural areas in Southern Ontario, including much of the Central Ontario region. In 2007, a group of politicians from Northern Ontario, including Tony Martin, Claude Gravelle and France Gélinas, called for the program to be refocused exclusively on the Northern Ontario administrative region.

Additionally there had been many calls from politicians and organizations to make FedNor an agency, separate from Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, like the other regional development agencies across Canada. In 2021, FedNor and the other RDAs were removed from ISED and placed under the control of dedicated cabinet ministers.

===Programs===
FedNor supports regional economic development, which it does through the delivery of three programs:

* Northern Ontario Development Program (NODP) — NODP was put in place to help promote economic development and diversification throughout Northern Ontario. NODP provides repayable and non-repayable contributions to not-for-profit organizations and small-and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) for projects focussed on the following three areas: Innovation; Community Economic Development; and Business Growth and Competitiveness.
* Community Futures Program — This program helps to support 24 Community Futures Development Corporations (CFDCs), throughout Northern Ontario. CFDCs provide an assortment of different programs and services which are for assisting in the community economic development and small business growth. These programs are able to provide help in: Strategic community planning and socio-economic development; Business information and planning services; and Access to capital for small and medium-sized businesses and social enterprises. These community-based, not-for-profit organizations are staffed by professionals and are each governed by local volunteer boards of directors familiar with their communities&#x27; needs, concerns and future development priorities.
* Economic Development Initiative (EDI) — As Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada’s main point of presence in Northern Ontario, FedNor delivers national initiatives and expanded program delivery opportunities across the region. In 2009, FedNor launched the Economic Development Initiative of the Federal Strategy for Official Languages called the Roadmap for Canada’s Linguistic Duality 2008–2013: Acting for the Future!

== Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario ==

The Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario (FedDev Ontario) is the federal government agency responsible for fostering innovation and business growth in Canada&#x27;s southern Ontario region, the most populous region in Canada.

Since its creation in 2009 to October 1, 2021, FedDev Ontario has invested more than $3.5 billion in over 5,000 projects working with over 63,000 organizations and businesses that have generated strong results, such as supporting nearly 190,000 jobs in the region.

With its headquarter office in Waterloo, FedDev Ontario has regional offices in Toronto, Peterborough, and Ottawa. Its area of operations is in the 37 census divisions of Statistics Canada, from Cornwall in the east to Owen Sound in the west, and from Pembroke in the north to Windsor in the south.

== Western Canada ==

=== Pacific Economic Development Canada ===
Pacific Economic Development Canada (PacifiCan) is the federal economic development agency of the province of British Columbia.

Canada&#x27;s Minister of International Development, currently Harjit Sajjan, holds the title of &quot;Minister responsible for the Pacific Economic Development Agency of Canada&quot;.

The agency has offices in Vancouver, and is set to establish headquarters in Surrey with additional service locations in Victoria, Kelowna, Prince George, Cranbrook, Fort St. John, Prince Rupert, and Campbell River, as well as an office in Ottawa, Ontario.

It was created in August 2021 from splitting the Western Economic Diversification Canada into two separate agencies, the other encompassing the Canadian Prairies.

=== Prairies Economic Development Canada ===
Prairies Economic Development Canada (PrairiesCan) is the federal economic development agency of the Canadian Prairies, which encompasses Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan. Its main priorities focus on community economic development, trade and investment, innovation, and business development.

It is headquartered in Edmonton, Alberta, with offices in Saskatoon and Winnipeg, a regional satellite office in Calgary, and a liaison office in Ottawa at the Thomas D&#x27;Arcy McGee Building. It will also be establishing new service locations in Lethbridge, Fort McMurray, and Grande Prairie, Alberta; Regina and Prince Albert, Saskatchewan; and Brandon and Thompson, Manitoba.

Canada&#x27;s Minister of Northern Affairs, currently Daniel Vandal, holds the title of &quot;Minister responsible for Prairies Economic Development Canada&quot;, along with &quot;Minister responsible for the Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency&quot;.

PrairiesCan was created in August 2021 from splitting the Western Economic Diversification Canada into two separate agencies, the other encompassing British Columbia.

=== Western Economic Diversification Canada ===
The Western Economic Diversification Canada (WD; legal name: Department of Western Economic Diversification) was a Canadian federal ministerial department concerned with the economy and economic development of Western Canada, which encompasses Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan.

On 5 August 2021, the Government of Canada announced that WD would be divided into two new agencies—PacifiCan for BC; and PrairiesCan for Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan.

WD operated under the provision of the &quot;Western Economic Diversification Act&quot;, which came into force on 28 June 1988. Formerly, WD was led by the Minister of Western Economic Diversification.

WD was headquartered in Edmonton, AB, and had regional offices in each of the other western provinces: Winnipeg, MB; Saskatoon, SK; and Vancouver, BC. The Edmonton office has now become the headquarters of PrairiesCan.

The Western Canada Business Service Network (WCBSN) is a group of independent organizations that receive funding from WD in order to help people in Western Canada start, grow, and expand their businesses.

The agency also released a quarterly economic publication called &quot;West at a Glance&quot; ().

<text>Alfred Humphreys Pease (May 6, 1838 in Cleveland, Ohio – July 12, 1882 in St. Louis, Missouri), studied at Kenyon College, where he was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon and later in Germany under music professors Theodor Kullak, Richard Wüerst, Wilhelm Wieprecht, and Hans von Bülow.

Pease was a popular composer and pianist in the 19th century. His earliest song (1864) &quot;Break, break break&quot; was one of the most popular tunes of the time, performed throughout the United States and Europe by some of the foremost musicians of the day. His orchestral compositions include &quot;Riveiere arid Andante,&quot; &quot;Andante and Scherzo,&quot; &quot;Romanze,&quot; and &quot;Concerto,&quot; all of which were performed by Theodore Thomas&#x27;s orchestra in New York and other cities.

<doc id="1188176" wikidata="Q1546872" url="?curid=1188176" title="Rat Park">
<text>Rat Park was a series of studies into drug addiction conducted in the late 1970s and published between 1978 and 1981 by Canadian psychologist Bruce K. Alexander and his colleagues at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, Canada.

At the time of the studies, research exploring the self-administration of morphine in animals often used small, solitary metal cages. Alexander hypothesized that these conditions may be responsible for exacerbating self-administration. To test this hypothesis, Alexander and his colleagues built Rat Park, a large housing colony 200 times the floor area of a standard laboratory cage. There were 16–20 rats of both sexes in residence, food, balls and wheels for play, and enough space for mating. The results of the experiment appeared to support his hypothesis that improved housing-conditions reduce the consumption of morphine water. This research highlighted an important issue in the design of morphine-self administration studies of the time, namely the use of austere housing-conditions, which confound the results.

== Rat Park experiments==

In Rat Park, the rats could drink a fluid from one of two drop dispensers, which automatically recorded how much each rat drank. One dispenser contained a sweetened morphine solution and the other plain tap water. Morphine solution was sweetened to reduce averse reaction to the taste of morphine; as a control, prior to morphine introduction, rats were offered a sweetened quinine solution instead.

Alexander designed a number of experiments to test the rats&#x27; willingness to consume the morphine. The Seduction Experiment involved four groups of 8 rats. Group CC was isolated in laboratory cages when they were weaned at 22 days of age, and lived there until the experiment ended at 80 days of age; Group PP was housed in Rat Park for the same period; Group CP was moved from laboratory cages to Rat Park at 65 days of age; and Group PC was moved out of Rat Park and into cages at 65 days of age.

The caged rats (Groups CC and PC) took to the morphine instantly, even with relatively little sweetener, with the caged males drinking 19 times more morphine than the Rat Park males in one of the experimental conditions. The rats in Rat Park resisted the morphine water. They would try it occasionally—with the females trying it more often than the males—but they showed a statistically significant preference for the plain water. He writes that the most interesting group was Group CP, the rats who were brought up in cages but moved to Rat Park before the experiment began. These animals rejected the morphine solution when it was stronger, but as it became sweeter and more dilute, they began to drink almost as much as the rats that had lived in cages throughout the experiment. They wanted the sweet water, he concluded, so long as it did not disrupt their normal social behavior. Even more significant, he writes, was that when he added naloxone, a drug which negates the effects of opioids, to the morphine-laced water, the Rat Park rats began to drink it.

In another experiment, he forced rats in ordinary lab cages to consume the morphine-laced solution for 57 days without other liquid available to drink. When they moved into Rat Park, they were allowed to choose between the morphine solution and plain water. They drank the plain water. He writes that they did show some signs of dependence. There were &quot;some minor withdrawal signs, twitching, what have you, but there were none of the mythic seizures and sweats you so often hear about ...&quot;

The authors concluded that isolated cages, as well as female sex, caused an increased consumption of morphine. The authors advised that it is important to consider the conditions of testing, as well as the sex of the animals, when exploring self-administration of morphine.

==Further experiments==

Studies that followed up on the contribution of environmental enrichment to addiction produced mixed results. A replication study found that both caged and &quot;park&quot; rats showed a decreased preference for morphine compared to Alexander&#x27;s original study; the author suggested a genetic reason for the difference Alexander initially observed. Another study found that while social isolation can influence levels of heroin self-administration, isolation is not a necessary condition for heroin or cocaine injections to be reinforcing.

Other studies have reinforced the effect of environmental enrichment on self-administration, such as one that showed it reduced re-instatement of cocaine seeking behavior in mice through cues (though not if that re-instatement was induced by cocaine itself) and another that showed it can eliminate previously established addiction-related behaviors. Furthermore, removing mice from enriched environments has been shown to increase vulnerability to cocaine addiction and exposure to complex environments during early stages of life produced dramatic changes in the reward system of the brain that resulted in reduced effects of cocaine. 

Broadly speaking, there is mounting evidence that the impoverished small cage environments that are standard for the housing of laboratory animals have undue influence on lab animal behavior and biology. These conditions can jeopardize both a basic premise of biomedical research—that healthy control animals are healthy—and the relevance of these kinds of animal studies to human conditions.

==Criticisms==
===Replication===

Bruce Petrie (1996), a graduate student of Alexander&#x27;s, attempted to replicate the study and correct for the original studies on 20 rats using two different methods for measuring morphine consumption between conditions (which introduced a potential confound). The study was not able to replicate the results, and the author suggested that strain differences between the rats Alexander&#x27;s research group used could be the reason for this.

There has been little subsequent interest in replicating the studies due to several methodological issues present in the originals. Issues included the small number of subjects used, the use of oral morphine, which does not mimic actual conditions of use (and introduces a confound because of the bitterness of morphine), and the measurement of morphine consumption, which differed between conditions. Other problems included equipment failures, lost data and rat deaths. However, some researchers have shown an interest in &quot;conceptual&quot; replication to continue exploring the contribution of environmental and social enrichment to addiction.

===Media interpretation===

Journalist Johann Hari gave a popular TED Talk about the results of the study in 2015. In it, he interpreted the studies to suggest that biological underpinnings are not the cause of addiction, instead shifting the etiology to a need for healthy relationships. The YouTube channel Kurzgesagt created and published a video based on Hari&#x27;s book, which garnered over 19 million views. The channel later took down the video, stating that they improperly represented the evidence.

Researchers have re-iterated that the results of Alexander&#x27;s studies highlight issues with rat models kept in bare-bones lab environments, and help implicate the environment as a contributing factor to addiction. However, the media has overstated the studies&#x27; importance by suggesting it represents a paradigm shift in research, and that the environment is the only—or the key—factor in addiction.

<text>Jodi Albert (born 22 July 1983) is a British actress and singer, best known for playing Debbie Dean in the Channel 4 soap opera &quot;Hollyoaks&quot;, as a member of Simon Cowell&#x27;s British girl group Girl Thing, and as a member of Irish girl group Wonderland.

==Early life==
Jodi Albert attended the independent Sylvia Young Theatre School, and shared lessons with Lee Ryan, Matt Willis, Billie Piper, and Amy Winehouse. At the age of ten, she was cast in the starring role of Young Cosette in &quot;Les Misérables&quot; at London&#x27;s Palace Theatre.

Jodi signed her first recording contract at age 15 years old to Simon Cowell&#x27;s group Girl Thing. They had a top ten hit and their album went gold in Asia and Australia. Girl Thing subsequently reunited for the second series of &quot;The Big Reunion&quot;.

In 2002, Albert joined the cast of the soap opera &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; on Channel 4, playing Debbie Dean. She left in 2005 but returned for guest appearances in 2005 and 2006. In 2005, Albert won the British Soap Award for &quot;Sexiest Female&quot; for her role in &quot;Hollyoaks.&quot; After leaving &quot;Hollyoaks,&quot; she appeared in Five sitcom &quot;Respectable;&quot; &quot;Casualty, and&quot; &quot;The Inspector Lynley Mysteries&quot; for the BBC; and the British film &quot;Popcorn&quot;, opposite ex-&quot;EastEnders&quot; star Jack Ryder.

In 2008, Albert signed her second record deal and became part of the Irish-based girl group Wonderland&quot;,&quot; who wrote and helped create their successful UK top ten 10 album, &quot;Wonderland&quot;. She was heavily involved in the creative part of this band formed with Kian Egan, in partnership with music manager Louis Walsh.

Albert has posed for numerous photoshoots for several men&#x27;s magazines, including &quot;Maxim&quot; and &quot;FHM&quot;, and is featured in &quot;Maxim&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Girls of &quot;Maxim&quot;&quot; gallery, also being named three times in &quot;FHM&quot; 100 Sexiest Women list: No. 93 in 2003; No. 73 in 2004; and No. 65 in 2005.

==Personal life==
Albert married Kian Egan, a member of the Irish vocal group Westlife, on 9 May 2009, in Barbados.
 On 31 July 2011, the couple announced they were expecting their first baby. The birth of their son Koa was announced on 20 December 2011. In November 2014, it was announced that they were expecting their second child.
In February 2015, her mother, Eileen, died after suffering from cancer for eight years. On 21 May 2015, Albert gave birth to her second child, a son named Zekey. On 30 March 2017, Jodi announced on her Instagram that they were expecting their third child. Their third son, Cobi Egan, was born on 29 September 2017. The family live in Strandhill, County Sligo.

<doc id="1188184" wikidata="Q751484" url="?curid=1188184" title="Block design">
<text>In combinatorial mathematics, a block design is an incidence structure consisting of a set together with a family of subsets known as &quot;blocks&quot;, chosen such that frequency of the elements satisfies certain conditions making the collection of blocks exhibit symmetry (balance). Block designs have applications in many areas, including experimental design, finite geometry, physical chemistry, software testing, cryptography, and algebraic geometry.

Without further specifications the term &quot;block design&quot; usually refers to a balanced incomplete block design (BIBD), specifically (and also synonymously) a 2-design, which has been the most intensely studied type historically due to its application in the design of experiments. Its generalization is known as a t-design.

== Overview ==
A design is said to be &quot;balanced&quot; (up to &quot;t&quot;) if all &quot;t&quot;-subsets of the original set occur in equally many (i.e., &quot;λ&quot;) blocks. When &quot;t&quot; is unspecified, it can usually be assumed to be 2, which means that each &quot;pair&quot; of elements is found in the same number of blocks and the design is &quot;pairwise balanced&quot;. For &quot;t&quot;=1, each element occurs in the same number of blocks (the &quot;replication number&quot;, denoted &quot;r&quot;) and the design is said to be &quot;regular&quot;. A block design in which all the blocks have the same size (usually denoted &quot;k&quot;) is called &quot;uniform&quot; or &quot;proper&quot;. The designs discussed in this article are all uniform. Block designs that are not necessarily uniform have also been studied; for &quot;t&quot;=2 they are known in the literature under the general name pairwise balanced designs (PBDs). Any uniform design balanced up to &quot;t&quot; is also balanced in all lower values of &quot;t&quot; (though with different &quot;λ&quot;-values), so for example a pairwise balanced (&quot;t&quot;=2) design is also regular (&quot;t&quot;=1). When the balancing requirement fails, a design may still be &quot;partially balanced&quot; if the &quot;t&quot;-subsets can be divided into &quot;n&quot; classes, each with its own (different) &quot;λ&quot;-value. For &quot;t&quot;=2 these are known as PBIBD(&quot;n&quot;) designs, whose classes form an association scheme.

Designs are usually said (or assumed) to be &quot;incomplete&quot;, meaning that the collection of blocks is not all possible &quot;k&quot;-subsets, thus ruling out a trivial design.

Block designs may or may not have repeated blocks. Designs without repeated blocks are called &quot;simple&quot;, in which case the &quot;family&quot; of blocks is a set rather than a multiset.

In statistics, the concept of a block design may be extended to &quot;non-binary&quot; block designs, in which blocks may contain multiple copies of an element (see blocking (statistics)). There, a design in which each element occurs the same total number of times is called &quot;equireplicate,&quot; which implies a &quot;regular&quot; design only when the design is also binary. The incidence matrix of a non-binary design lists the number of times each element is repeated in each block.

== Regular uniform designs (configurations) ==
The simplest type of &quot;balanced&quot; design (&quot;t&quot;=1) is known as a tactical configuration or 1-design. The corresponding incidence structure in geometry is known simply as a configuration, see Configuration (geometry). Such a design is uniform and regular: each block contains &quot;k&quot; elements and each element is contained in &quot;r&quot; blocks. The number of set elements &quot;v&quot; and the number of blocks &quot;b&quot; are related by formula_1, which is the total number of element occurrences.

Every binary matrix with constant row and column sums is the incidence matrix of a regular uniform block design. Also, each configuration has a corresponding biregular bipartite graph known as its incidence or Levi graph.

==Pairwise balanced uniform designs (2-designs or BIBDs)==

Given a finite set &quot;X&quot; (of elements called &quot;points&quot;) and integers &quot;k&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, &quot;λ&quot; ≥ 1, we define a &quot;2-design&quot; (or &quot;BIBD&quot;, standing for balanced incomplete block design) &quot;B&quot; to be a family of &quot;k&quot;-element subsets of &quot;X&quot;, called &quot;blocks&quot;, such that any &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot; is contained in &quot;r&quot; blocks, and any pair of distinct points &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; in &quot;X&quot; is contained in &quot;λ&quot; blocks. Here, the condition that any &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot; is contained in &quot;r&quot; blocks is redundant, as shown below.

Here &quot;v&quot; (the number of elements of &quot;X&quot;, called points), &quot;b&quot; (the number of blocks), &quot;k&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, and λ are the &quot;parameters&quot; of the design. (To avoid degenerate examples, it is also assumed that &quot;v&quot; &gt; &quot;k&quot;, so that no block contains all the elements of the set. This is the meaning of &quot;incomplete&quot; in the name of these designs.) In a table:

The design is called a (&quot;v&quot;, &quot;k&quot;, &quot;λ&quot;)-design or a (&quot;v&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, &quot;k&quot;, &quot;λ&quot;)-design. The parameters are not all independent; &quot;v&quot;, &quot;k&quot;, and λ determine &quot;b&quot; and &quot;r&quot;, and not all combinations of &quot;v&quot;, &quot;k&quot;, and &quot;λ&quot; are possible. The two basic equations connecting these parameters are
:formula_2 
obtained by counting the number of pairs (&quot;B&quot;, &quot;p&quot;) where &quot;B&quot; is a block and &quot;p&quot; is a point in that block, and
:formula_3
obtained from counting for a fixed &quot;x&quot; the triples (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;B&quot;) where &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are distinct points and &quot;B&quot; is a block that contains them both. This equation for every &quot;x&quot; also proves that &quot;r&quot; is constant (independent of &quot;x&quot;) even without assuming it explicitly, thus proving that the condition that any &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot; is contained in &quot;r&quot; blocks is redundant and &quot;r&quot; can be computed from the other parameters.

The resulting &quot;b&quot; and &quot;r&quot; must be integers, which imposes conditions on &quot;v&quot;, &quot;k&quot;, and &quot;λ&quot;. These conditions are not sufficient as, for example, a (43,7,1)-design does not exist.

The &quot;order&quot; of a 2-design is defined to be &quot;n&quot; = &quot;r&quot; − &quot;λ&quot;. The complement of a 2-design is obtained by replacing each block with its complement in the point set &quot;X&quot;. It is also a 2-design and has parameters &quot;v&quot;′ = &quot;v&quot;, &quot;b&quot;′ = &quot;b&quot;, &quot;r&quot;′ = &quot;b&quot; − &quot;r&quot;, &quot;k&quot;′ = &quot;v&quot; − &quot;k&quot;, &quot;λ&quot;′ = &quot;λ&quot; + &quot;b&quot; − 2&quot;r&quot;. A 2-design and its complement have the same order.

A fundamental theorem, Fisher&#x27;s inequality, named after the statistician Ronald Fisher, is that &quot;b&quot; ≥ &quot;v&quot; in any 2-design.

A rather surprising and not very obvious (but very general) combinatorial result for these designs is that if points are denoted by any arbitrarily chosen set of equally or unequally spaced numerics, there is no choice of such a set which can make all block-sums (that is, sum of all points in a given block) constant. For other designs such as partially balanced incomplete block designs this may however be possible. Many such cases are discussed in. However, it can also be observed trivially for the magic squares or magic rectangles which can be viewed as the partially balanced incomplete block designs.

===Examples===
The unique (6,3,2)-design (&quot;v&quot; = 6, &quot;k&quot; = 3, &quot;λ&quot; = 2) has 10 blocks (&quot;b&quot; = 10) and each element is repeated 5 times (&quot;r&quot; = 5). Using the symbols 0 − 5, the blocks are the following triples:
: 012    013    024    035    045    125    134    145    234    235.

and the corresponding incidence matrix (a &quot;v&quot;×&quot;b&quot; binary matrix with constant row sum &quot;r&quot; and constant column sum &quot;k&quot;) is:

:formula_4

One of four nonisomorphic (8,4,3)-designs has 14 blocks with each element repeated 7 times. Using the symbols 0 − 7 the blocks are the following 4-tuples:
: 0123    0124    0156    0257    0345    0367    0467    1267    1346    1357    1457    2347    2356    2456.

The unique (7,3,1)-design is symmetric and has 7 blocks with each element repeated 3 times. Using the symbols 0 − 6, the blocks are the following triples:
: 013    026    045    124    156    235    346. 
This design is associated with the Fano plane, with the elements and blocks of the design corresponding to the points and lines of the plane. Its corresponding incidence matrix can also be symmetric, if the labels or blocks are sorted the right way:

: formula_5

==Symmetric 2-designs (SBIBDs)==

The case of equality in Fisher&#x27;s inequality, that is, a 2-design with an equal number of points and blocks, is called a symmetric design. Symmetric designs have the smallest number of blocks among all the 2-designs with the same number of points.

In a symmetric design &quot;r&quot; = &quot;k&quot; holds as well as &quot;b&quot; = &quot;v&quot;, and, while it is generally not true in arbitrary 2-designs, in a symmetric design every two distinct blocks meet in &quot;λ&quot; points. A theorem of Ryser provides the converse. If &quot;X&quot; is a &quot;v&quot;-element set, and &quot;B&quot; is a &quot;v&quot;-element set of &quot;k&quot;-element subsets (the &quot;blocks&quot;), such that any two distinct blocks have exactly λ points in common, then (&quot;X, B&quot;) is a symmetric block design.

The parameters of a symmetric design satisfy
::formula_6
This imposes strong restrictions on &quot;v&quot;, so the number of points is far from arbitrary. The Bruck–Ryser–Chowla theorem gives necessary, but not sufficient, conditions for the existence of a symmetric design in terms of these parameters.

The following are important examples of symmetric 2-designs:

===Projective planes===
Finite projective planes are symmetric 2-designs with &quot;λ&quot; = 1 and order &quot;n&quot; &gt; 1. For these designs the symmetric design equation becomes:

::formula_7

Since &quot;k&quot; = &quot;r&quot; we can write the &quot;order of a projective plane&quot; as &quot;n&quot; = &quot;k&quot; − 1 and, from the displayed equation above, we obtain &quot;v&quot; = (&quot;n&quot; + 1)&quot;n&quot; + 1 = &quot;n&quot;2 + &quot;n&quot; + 1 points in a projective plane of order &quot;n&quot;.

As a projective plane is a symmetric design, we have &quot;b&quot; = &quot;v&quot;, meaning that &quot;b&quot; = &quot;n&quot;2 + &quot;n&quot; + 1 also. The number &quot;b&quot; is the number of &quot;lines&quot; of the projective plane. There can be no repeated lines since λ = 1, so a projective plane is a simple 2-design in which the number of lines and the number of points are always the same. For a projective plane, &quot;k&quot; is the number of points on each line and it is equal to &quot;n&quot; + 1. Similarly, &quot;r&quot; = &quot;n&quot; + 1 is the number of lines with which a given point is incident.

For &quot;n&quot; = 2 we get a projective plane of order 2, also called the Fano plane, with &quot;v&quot; = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 points and 7 lines. In the Fano plane, each line has &quot;n&quot; + 1 = 3 points and each point belongs to &quot;n&quot; + 1 = 3 lines.

Projective planes are known to exist for all orders which are prime numbers or powers of primes. They form the only known infinite family (with respect to having a constant λ value) of symmetric block designs.

===Biplanes===
A biplane or biplane geometry is a symmetric 2-design with &quot;λ&quot; = 2; that is, every set of two points is contained in two blocks (&quot;lines&quot;), while any two lines intersect in two points. They are similar to finite projective planes, except that rather than two points determining one line (and two lines determining one point), two points determine two lines (respectively, points). A biplane of order &quot;n&quot; is one whose blocks have &quot;k&quot; = &quot;n&quot; + 2 points; it has &quot;v&quot; = 1 + (&quot;n&quot; + 2)(&quot;n&quot; + 1)/2 points (since &quot;r&quot; = &quot;k&quot;).

The 18 known examples are listed below.
* (Trivial) The order 0 biplane has 2 points (and lines of size 2; a 2-(2,2,2) design); it is two points, with two blocks, each consisting of both points. Geometrically, it is the digon.
* The order 1 biplane has 4 points (and lines of size 3; a 2-(4,3,2) design); it is the complete design with &quot;v&quot; = 4 and &quot;k&quot; = 3. Geometrically, the points are the vertices of a tetrahedron and the blocks are its faces.
* The order 2 biplane is the complement of the Fano plane: it has 7 points (and lines of size 4; a 2-(7,4,2)), where the lines are given as the &quot;complements&quot; of the (3-point) lines in the Fano plane.
* The order 3 biplane has 11 points (and lines of size 5; a 2-(11,5,2)), and is also known as the after Raymond Paley; it is associated to the Paley digraph of order 11, which is constructed using the field with 11 elements, and is the Hadamard 2-design associated to the size 12 Hadamard matrix; see Paley construction I.
:Algebraically this corresponds to the exceptional embedding of the projective special linear group &quot;PSL&quot;(2,5) in &quot;PSL&quot;(2,11) – see projective linear group: action on &quot;p&quot; points for details.
* There are three biplanes of order 4 (and 16 points, lines of size 6; a 2-(16,6,2)). One is the Kummer configuration. These three designs are also Menon designs.
* There are four biplanes of order 7 (and 37 points, lines of size 9; a 2-(37,9,2)).
* There are five biplanes of order 9 (and 56 points, lines of size 11; a 2-(56,11,2)).
* Two biplanes are known of order 11 (and 79 points, lines of size 13; a 2-(79,13,2)).

Biplanes of orders 5, 6, 8 and 10 do not exist, as shown by the Bruck-Ryser-Chowla theorem.

===Hadamard 2-designs===
An Hadamard matrix of size &quot;m&quot; is an &quot;m&quot; × &quot;m&quot; matrix H whose entries are ±1 such that HH⊤  = mIm, where H⊤ is the transpose of H and I&quot;m&quot; is the &quot;m&quot; × &quot;m&quot; identity matrix. An Hadamard matrix can be put into &quot;standardized form&quot; (that is, converted to an equivalent Hadamard matrix) where the first row and first column entries are all +1. If the size &quot;m&quot; &gt; 2 then &quot;m&quot; must be a multiple of 4.

Given an Hadamard matrix of size 4&quot;a&quot; in standardized form, remove the first row and first column and convert every −1 to a 0. The resulting 0–1 matrix M is the incidence matrix of a symmetric 2-(4&quot;a&quot; − 1, 2&quot;a&quot; − 1, &quot;a&quot; − 1) design called an Hadamard 2-design. 
It contains formula_8 blocks/points; each contains/is contained in formula_9 points/blocks. Each pair of points is contained in exactly formula_10 blocks.

This construction is reversible, and the incidence matrix of a symmetric 2-design with these parameters can be used to form an Hadamard matrix of size 4&quot;a&quot;.

==Resolvable 2-designs==
A resolvable 2-design is a BIBD whose blocks can be partitioned into sets (called &quot;parallel classes&quot;), each of which forms a partition of the point set of the BIBD. The set of parallel classes is called a &quot;resolution&quot; of the design.

If a 2-(&quot;v&quot;,&quot;k&quot;,λ) resolvable design has &quot;c&quot; parallel classes, then &quot;b&quot;  ≥ &quot;v&quot; + &quot;c&quot; − 1.

Consequently, a symmetric design can not have a non-trivial (more than one parallel class) resolution.

Archetypical resolvable 2-designs are the finite affine planes. A solution of the famous 15 schoolgirl problem is a resolution of a 2-(15,3,1) design.

==General balanced designs (&quot;t&quot;-designs)==
Given any positive integer &quot;t&quot;, a &quot;t&quot;-design &quot;B&quot; is a class of &quot;k&quot;-element subsets of &quot;X&quot;, called &quot;blocks&quot;, such that every point &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot; appears in exactly &quot;r&quot; blocks, and every &quot;t&quot;-element subset &quot;T&quot; appears in exactly λ blocks. The numbers &quot;v&quot; (the number of elements of &quot;X&quot;), &quot;b&quot; (the number of blocks), &quot;k&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, λ, and &quot;t&quot; are the &quot;parameters&quot; of the design. The design may be called a &quot;t&quot;-(&quot;v&quot;,&quot;k&quot;,λ)-design. Again, these four numbers determine &quot;b&quot; and &quot;r&quot; and the four numbers themselves cannot be chosen arbitrarily. The equations are

:formula_11

where &quot;λi&quot; is the number of blocks that contain any &quot;i&quot;-element set of points and &quot;λt&quot; = λ.

Note that formula_12 and formula_13.

Theorem: Any &quot;t&quot;-(&quot;v&quot;,&quot;k&quot;,λ)-design is also an &quot;s&quot;-(&quot;v&quot;,&quot;k&quot;,λs)-design for any &quot;s&quot; with 1 ≤ &quot;s&quot; ≤ &quot;t&quot;. (Note that the &quot;lambda value&quot; changes as above and depends on &quot;s&quot;.)

A consequence of this theorem is that every &quot;t&quot;-design with &quot;t&quot; ≥ 2 is also a 2-design.

A &quot;t&quot;-(&quot;v&quot;,&quot;k&quot;,1)-design is called a Steiner system.

The term &quot;block design&quot; by itself usually means a 2-design.

===Derived and extendable t-designs===
Let D = (&quot;X&quot;, &quot;B&quot;) be a t-(&quot;v&quot;,&quot;k&quot;,&quot;λ&quot;) design and &quot;p&quot; a point of &quot;X&quot;. The &quot;derived design&quot; &quot;D&quot;&quot;p&quot; has point set &quot;X&quot; − {&quot;p&quot;} and as block set all the blocks of D which contain p with p removed. It is a (&quot;t&quot; − 1)-(&quot;v&quot; − 1, &quot;k&quot; − 1, &quot;λ&quot;) design. Note that derived designs with respect to different points may not be isomorphic. A design E is called an &quot;extension&quot; of D if E has a point p such that Ep is isomorphic to D; we call D &quot;extendable&quot; if it has an extension.

Theorem: If a &quot;t&quot;-(&quot;v&quot;,&quot;k&quot;,&quot;λ&quot;) design has an extension, then &quot;k&quot; + 1 divides &quot;b&quot;(&quot;v&quot; + 1).

The only extendable projective planes (symmetric 2-(&quot;n&quot;2 + &quot;n&quot; + 1, &quot;n&quot; + 1, 1) designs) are those of orders 2 and 4.

Every Hadamard 2-design is extendable (to an Hadamard 3-design).

Theorem:.
If D, a symmetric 2-(&quot;v&quot;,&quot;k&quot;,λ) design, is extendable, then one of the following holds:
# D is an Hadamard 2-design,
# &quot;v&quot;  =  (λ + 2)(λ2 + 4λ + 2), &quot;k&quot; = λ2 + 3λ + 1,
# &quot;v&quot; = 495, &quot;k&quot; = 39, λ = 3.

Note that the projective plane of order two is an Hadamard 2-design; the projective plane of order four has parameters which fall in case 2; the only other known symmetric 2-designs with parameters in case 2 are the order 9 biplanes, but none of them are extendable; and there is no known symmetric 2-design with the parameters of case 3.

====Inversive planes====
A design with the parameters of the extension of an affine plane, i.e., a 3-(&quot;n&quot;2 + 1, &quot;n&quot; + 1, 1) design, is called a finite inversive plane, or Möbius plane, of order &quot;n&quot;.

It is possible to give a geometric description of some inversive planes, indeed, of all known inversive planes. An &quot;ovoid&quot; in PG(3,&quot;q&quot;) is a set of &quot;q&quot;2 + 1 points, no three collinear. It can be shown that every plane (which is a hyperplane since the geometric dimension is 3) of PG(3,&quot;q&quot;) meets an ovoid &quot;O&quot; in either 1 or &quot;q&quot; + 1 points. The plane sections of size &quot;q&quot; + 1 of &quot;O&quot; are the blocks of an inversive plane of order &quot;q&quot;. Any inversive plane arising this way is called &quot;egglike&quot;. All known inversive planes are egglike.

An example of an ovoid is the elliptic quadric, the set of zeros of the quadratic form
::: &quot;x&quot;1&quot;x&quot;2 + &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;3, &quot;x&quot;4), 
where f is an irreducible quadratic form in two variables over GF(&quot;q&quot;). [&quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) = &quot;x&quot;2 + &quot;xy&quot; + &quot;y&quot;2 for example].

If &quot;q&quot; is an odd power of 2, another type of ovoid is known – the Suzuki–Tits ovoid.

Theorem. Let &quot;q&quot; be a positive integer, at least 2. (a) If &quot;q&quot; is odd, then any ovoid is projectively equivalent to the elliptic quadric in a projective geometry PG(3,&quot;q&quot;); so &quot;q&quot; is a prime power and there is a unique egglike inversive plane of order &quot;q&quot;. (But it is unknown if non-egglike ones exist.) (b) if &quot;q&quot; is even, then &quot;q&quot; is a power of 2 and any inversive plane of order &quot;q&quot; is egglike (but there may be some unknown ovoids).

==Partially balanced designs (PBIBDs)==

An &quot;n&quot;-class association scheme consists of a set &quot;X&quot; of size &quot;v&quot; together with a partition &quot;S&quot; of &quot;X&quot; × &quot;X&quot; into &quot;n&quot; + 1 binary relations, R0, R1, ..., Rn. A pair of elements in relation Ri are said to be &quot;i&quot;th–&quot;associates&quot;. Each element of &quot;X&quot; has &quot;n&quot;i  &quot;i&quot;th associates. Furthermore:

*formula_14 and is called the Identity relation. 
*Defining formula_15, if &quot;R&quot; in &quot;S&quot;, then &quot;R*&quot; in &quot;S&quot;
*If formula_16, the number of formula_17 such that formula_18 and formula_19 is a constant formula_20 depending on &quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot;, &quot;k&quot; but not on the particular choice of &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;.

An association scheme is &quot;commutative&quot; if formula_21 for all &quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot; and &quot;k&quot;. Most authors assume this property.

A partially balanced incomplete block design with &quot;n&quot; associate classes (PBIBD(&quot;n&quot;)) is a block design based on a &quot;v&quot;-set X with &quot;b&quot; blocks each of size &quot;k&quot; and with each element appearing in &quot;r&quot; blocks, such that there is an association scheme with &quot;n&quot; classes defined on &quot;X&quot; where, if elements &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are &quot;i&quot;th associates, 1 ≤ &quot;i&quot; ≤ &quot;n&quot;, then they are together in precisely λi blocks.

A PBIBD(&quot;n&quot;) determines an association scheme but the converse is false.

===Example ===
Let &quot;A&quot;(3) be the following association scheme with three associate classes on the set &quot;X&quot; = {1,2,3,4,5,6}. The (&quot;i&quot;,&quot;j&quot;) entry is &quot;s&quot; if elements &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot; are in relation Rs.

The blocks of a PBIBD(3) based on &quot;A&quot;(3) are:

The parameters of this PBIBD(3) are: &quot;v&quot;  =  6, &quot;b&quot;  =  8, &quot;k&quot;  =  3, &quot;r&quot;  =  4 and λ1 = λ2 = 2 and λ3 = 1. Also, for the association scheme we have &quot;n&quot;0  =  &quot;n&quot;2  =  1 and &quot;n&quot;1  =  &quot;n&quot;3  =  2. The incidence matrix M is

formula_22

and the concurrence matrix MMT is

formula_23

from which we can recover the &quot;λ&quot; and &quot;r&quot; values.

===Properties===
The parameters of a PBIBD(&quot;m&quot;) satisfy:
# formula_24
# formula_25
# formula_26
# formula_27
# formula_28

A PBIBD(1) is a BIBD and a PBIBD(2) in which λ1  =  λ2 is a BIBD.

===Two associate class PBIBDs===
PBIBD(2)s have been studied the most since they are the simplest and most useful of the PBIBDs. They fall into six types based on a classification of the &quot;then known&quot; PBIBD(2)s by :
# group divisible;
# triangular;
# Latin square type;
# cyclic;
# partial geometry type;
# miscellaneous.

==Applications==
The mathematical subject of block designs originated in the statistical framework of design of experiments. These designs were especially useful in applications of the technique of analysis of variance (ANOVA). This remains a significant area for the use of block designs.

While the origins of the subject are grounded in biological applications (as is some of the existing terminology), the designs are used in many applications where systematic comparisons are being made, such as in software testing.

The incidence matrix of block designs provide a natural source of interesting block codes that are used as error correcting codes. The rows of their incidence matrices are also used as the symbols in a form of pulse-position modulation.

=== Statistical application ===
Suppose that skin cancer researchers want to test three different sunscreens. They coat two different sunscreens on the upper sides of the hands of a test person. After a UV radiation they record the skin irritation in terms of sunburn. The number of treatments is 3 (sunscreens) and the block size is 2 (hands per person).

A corresponding BIBD can be generated by the R-function &quot;design.bib&quot; of the R-package agricolae and is specified in the following table:

The investigator chooses the parameters , and for the block design which are then inserted into the R-function. Subsequently, the remaining parameters and are determined automatically.

Using the basic relations we calculate that we need blocks, that is, 3 test people in order to obtain a balanced incomplete block design. Labeling the blocks and , to avoid confusion, we have the block design,
: },    } and }.

A corresponding incidence matrix is specified in the following table:
Each treatment occurs in 2 blocks, so .

Just one block () contains the treatments 1 and 2 simultaneously and the same applies to the pairs of treatments (1,3) and (2,3). Therefore, .

It is impossible to use a complete design (all treatments in each block) in this example because there are 3 sunscreens to test, but only 2 hands on each person.

<text>Clarence Coles Phillips (October 3, 1880June 13, 1927) was an American artist and illustrator who signed his early works &quot;C. Coles Phillips&quot;, but after 1911 worked under the abbreviated name, &quot;Coles Phillips&quot;. He is known for his stylish images of women and a signature use of negative space in the paintings he created for advertisements and the covers of popular magazines.

==Early life==

Phillips was born in Springfield, Ohio, the son of Anna Seys and Jacob Phillips. From 1902 to 1904, he attended Kenyon College in his native state, where he was a member of Alpha Delta Phi. His illustrations were published in the 1901–1904 editions of the school&#x27;s yearbook, &quot;The Reveille&quot;.

After leaving Kenyon, Phillips moved to Manhattan, determined to earn a living through his art. He took night classes for three months at the Chase School of Art—his only formal artistic training—before establishing his own advertising agency. One of Phillips&#x27;s employees was the young Edward Hopper, his former classmate.

In 1907, Phillips met with J. A. Mitchell, the publisher of &quot;Life&quot; magazine, and was hired onto its staff at the age of twenty-six. Phillips would be associated with the magazine throughout his life.

==Career==

The work of Phillips quickly became popular with the &quot;Life&quot; readers. In May 1908, he created a cover for the magazine that featured his first &quot;fadeaway girl&quot; design with a figure whose clothing matched, and disappeared into, the background. Phillips developed this idea in many subsequent covers.

Phillips&#x27;s use of negative space allowed the viewer to &quot;fill-in&quot; the image; it also reduced printing costs for the magazine, as &quot;the novelty of the technique and the striking design qualities masked the fact that &quot;Life&quot; was getting by with single color or two-color covers in a day when full-color covers were de rigueur for the better magazines&quot;. Phillips worked in watercolor and always painted from life; according to his biographer, Michael Schau, &quot;he refused to work from photographs or to use the pantograph&quot;.

Phillips produced cover art for other national magazines besides &quot;Life&quot;, including &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot;, which for two years (beginning in July 1912) made him their sole cover artist. Phillips also created many advertising images for makers of women&#x27;s clothing, and for such clients as the Overland automobile company and Oneida Community flatware. His series depicting women wearing Holeproof Hosiery products was considered daring for its time. Phillips&#x27;s works also appear in the 1921 and 1922 editions of the U. S. Naval Academy yearbook, &quot;Lucky Bag&quot;.

==Personal life==
From 1905 until his death, Phillips lived and worked in New Rochelle, New York. His work habits were regular; his other activities included raising pigeons, a hobby he had pursued from the age of eight years.

In December 1907 Phillips met Teresa Hyde, a nurse who became his most frequent model during his early years. They married in early 1910.

In 1924 he was diagnosed with tuberculosis of the kidney (Renal TB), and for the remainder of his life he was frequently ill. In January 1927, when problems with his eyesight made painting difficult, he dedicated himself to writing. Phillips died in New Rochelle at his home, of his kidney ailment on June 13, 1927, at the age of forty-seven. The funeral service was held on June 14 at the Sutton Manor home in New Rochelle and officiated by the Rev. Paul Gordon Favour from Trinity Episcopal Church of New Rochelle. Artist and friend, J.C. Leyendecker eulogized him as an artist &quot;unique in his field, one with a highly developed sense of decoration and color... he was ahead of most men in depicting the American type of young womanhood.&quot; The body was then taken to Fresh Pond Crematory for cremation.

Phillips&#x27;s works are often exhibited alongside those of other notable graphic artists. In 2002, the Swann Gallery&#x27;s &quot;American Beauties: Drawings from the Golden Age of Illustration&quot; featured Phillips, Charles Dana Gibson, Wladyslaw Benda, and Nell Brinkley, among others. Phillips was also included in the Norman Rockwell Museum&#x27;s &quot;Toast of the Town: Norman Rockwell and the Artists of New Rochelle&quot; and in &quot;Illustrating Modern Life: The Golden Age of American Illustration from the Kelly Collection&quot; at the Frederick R. Weisman Museum of Art at Pepperdine University. In 2015, the Oneida Community Mansion House presented an exhibition focused on Phillips’s ads created for Oneida silverware from 1911 to 1924.

<text>A single-point urban interchange (SPUI, or ), also called a single-point interchange (SPI) or single-point diamond interchange (SPDI), is a type of highway interchange. The design was created in order to help move large volumes of traffic through limited amounts of space efficiently.
==Description==

A SPUI is similar in form to a diamond interchange but has the advantage of allowing opposing left turns to proceed simultaneously by compressing the two intersections of a diamond into one single intersection over or under the free-flowing road.

The term &quot;single-point&quot; refers to the fact that all through traffic on the arterial street, as well as the traffic turning left onto or off the interchange, can be controlled from a single set of traffic signals. Due to the space efficiency of SPUIs relative to the volume of traffic they can handle, the interchange design is used extensively in the reconstruction of existing freeways as well as constructing new freeways, particularly in dense urban environments.

Sometimes a SPUI will allow traffic to proceed straight through from the offramp to the onramp; this usually happens when the ramps connect with frontage roads. Since most through traffic travels over or under the intersection, the SPUI is still much more efficient than a surface intersection.

===Advantages===
The most commonly cited advantages of SPUIs are improved operation efficiency and safety as well as reduced right-of-way requirements compared to other interchange forms. Left-turning traffic from both directions of the intersecting roadways is able to turn simultaneously without crossing the path of the opposing left turns. Because traffic passing through the interchange can be controlled by a single signal, vehicles can clear the intersection much more quickly than in a diamond interchange (which requires two sets of traffic signals).

SPUIs also allow for wider turns, easing movement for large vehicles, such as trucks and RVs. Furthermore, a SPUI takes up considerably less space than a full cloverleaf interchange, allowing construction to take place on a limited amount of property and minimizing state use of eminent domain.

Finally, SPUIs are reportedly safer than other space-efficient interchange forms, such as (standard) diamond interchanges. Research suggests that, although there may not be a significant difference between the two types of interchanges in terms of total collisions, the injury and fatality rates are notably lower for SPUIs than diamond interchanges.

===Disadvantages===
The major disadvantage of SPUIs over other types of road junctions is the increased cost due to the need for a longer or wider bridge. A freeway-under SPUI (as in the upper diagram) requires a wider bridge over the free-flowing road to make room for the compressed on- and offramps. However, this disadvantage poses less of a problem in cases where the arterial, or nonfreeway road, already requires a very wide bridge. The intersection of 97 Street, having seven throughlanes, with Yellowhead Trail in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, though a diamond interchange in concept, required such a wide bridge that traffic-signal phasing allows this intersection to behave as a SPUI. A freeway-over SPUI (as in the lower photo) requires a longer bridge of the free-flowing road to cross the wider area required for the SPUI intersection below.

Because vehicles must be able to cross the pavement in six different ways, a SPUI generally has a very large area of uncontrolled pavement in the middle of the intersection. This can be unsafe particularly if drivers are unfamiliar with the interchange type. Drivers making a left turn may become confused as oncoming turning traffic passes them on the &quot;righthand&quot; side.

Due to the large intersection area, the traffic lights need a longer yellow and red phase to clear the intersection, and, even then, it may not be long enough for a bicyclist entering on green or yellow to make it across before opposing traffic gets a green. In general, SPUI designs should not be used where bicycle traffic is expected unless fairly substantial changes to the design or special accommodations are provided.

Pedestrians are usually not able to get through the intersection with one green light. It can take up to four cycles to walk through the entire length of a SPUI.

Finally, SPUIs can be somewhat difficult to clear of snow. The large area in which lanes cross may have to be shut down to allow efficient and thorough cleaning lest a snowplow leave piles of snow, interfering with traffic and visibility in the middle of the uncontrolled pavement. Additionally, if the wide area of uncontrolled pavement is on a bridge, as in the diagram, the snow cannot be pushed to the sides of the bridge as it may pose a hazard to the road underneath. This problem can be exacerbated by the comparatively large bridge width required by the SPUI.

Given that a SPUI allows only left and right turns, drivers may not reenter the freeway they are departing (if, for example, they realize that they have taken the wrong exit) within a SPUI.

Three-phase traffic signals are required. Other interchange types designed for efficiency, such as the six-ramp partial cloverleaf and the diverging diamond, require just two signal phases.

==History==
The first SPUI opened on February 25, 1974, along U.S. Route 19 (State Road 55), which goes over State Road 60 east of Clearwater, Florida. It was designed by Wallace Hawkes, Director of Transportation Engineering at J. E. Greiner Company (later URS Corporation), who has been called the &quot;granddaddy of the urban interchange&quot;. This design has since been altered to include frontage roads in each direction.

Several SPUIs, built in the 1970s and later, are located on German autobahns, like the A40, A42, A44, A46, A57, A59, and A113 in Berlin. There is also a SPUI on the &quot;Frankenschnellweg&quot;, the urban part of the A73, and Maximilianstraße, in Nuremberg (at ). Smaller versions of the SPUI can also be found on non-autobahn roads in German cities, with right-turning traffic under signal control, located in Heilbronn, Karlsruhe, Sindelfingen, Stuttgart, and Wiesbaden.

SPUIs are also found in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Indonesia, and Singapore.

==Variants==
===Inverted SPUI===

A rarely built variant of the SPUI is the inverted SPUI, in which the carriageways of the free-flowing road are separated, with left on- and offramps running between the carriageways and coming to a single at-grade intersection with the cross street. This can be built less expensively than a standard SPUI by allowing for shorter, simpler bridges at the interchange. However, this inverts the usual convention of placing carriageway on- and offramps on the right side of the carriageway, instead placing them on the left side, usually considered the passing lane.

====Notable examples====

* Interstate 290 in Oak Park, Illinois, near Chicago, at South Harlem Avenue () and at South Austin Boulevard ().
* Greensboro, North Carolina, connecting West Wendover Avenue to South Holden Road ().
* Interstate 244 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, at Sheridan Road () and at Memorial Drive ().
* U.S. Route 422 in Reading, Pennsylvania, at U.S. Route 222 Business ().
*State Route 18 in St. George, Utah, at Red Hills Parkway.
*Woodall Rogers Freeway (TX Spur 366), in Dallas, Texas at Riverfront Boulevard, immediately before the Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge ().

====Continuous green T (or seagull) hybrid====
There is also a variant of the inverted SPUI, which can be used when a side road ends at, rather than crossing, a free-flowing road. In this variant, one carriageway of the free-flowing road is grade-separated from the side road, as with a typical inverted SPUI, while the other carriageway of the free-flowing road is at-grade with but still separated from the side road, as found in a continuous green T- (or seagull) intersection.

There is one such interchange in Pultney Township, Belmont County, Ohio, between State Route 7 (SR 7) and Interstate 470 (I-470) at . The ramps leading to and from I-470 run west of, but are not directly connected to, SR 7; these ramps form the &quot;side road&quot; at this interchange. The southbound carriageway of SR 7 bridges over the interchange, while its northbound carriageway remains at-grade. SR 7&#x27;s left on- and offramps run between its carriageways, meeting the I-470 ramps at an at-grade intersection. The I-470 ramps proceed to a trumpet interchange with I-470. I-470 itself bridges over both carriageways of SR 7 a short distance north of the I-470/SR 7 ramps&#x27; intersection. This design was likely chosen not for cost savings but because the northbound carriageway of SR 7 is bordered by railroad tracks, commercial properties, and the Ohio River and because I-470 bridges the river just east of SR 7—a more conventional interchange design was likely more difficult to achieve.

There is another such interchange in Millvale, Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh, at the junction between Pennsylvania Route 28 (PA 28) and the 40th Street Bridge. The northbound carriageway of PA 28 passes under the interchange, with lefthand ramps meeting at the bridge (the northbound entrance ramp does not provide direct access to PA 28). The southbound carriageway of PA 28 has a continuous green T-intersection with the bridge.

A similar interchange exists in Coal Grove, Ohio, at the junction of U.S. Route 52 (US 52) with the Ben Williamson Memorial Bridge and the Simeon Willis Memorial Bridge, which cross the Ohio River and lead to and from Ashland, Kentucky, respectively. The eastbound carriageway of US 52 passes under the interchange, with lefthand exit and entrance ramps to the bridges. The westbound carriageway of US 52, which narrows to one throughlane, has a continuous green T-intersection with the bridges. The ramps cross each other , with a traffic light-controlled intersection.

An interchange, like that in Millvale, Pennsylvania, formerly existed at the junction of SR 7 and SR 822 at the now-demolished Fort Steuben Bridge in Steubenville, Ohio. The northbound carriageway of SR 7 passed under the bridge, with lefthand ramps meeting the bridge approach, while the southbound carriageway had a continuous green T-intersection with the bridge.

===Offset SPUI===

An offset SPUI is similar to a diamond interchange, however, by making two of the ramps flyovers or flyunders, all ramps are pushed to one side of the highway, where they meet the surface street at a single intersection. An example of this is the interchange between Interstate 225 and Alameda Avenue near the Town Center at Aurora shopping center in Aurora, Colorado, United States (at ).

===Three-level SPUI===
A three-level SPUI is similar to a standard SPUI but includes an additional grade separation allowing for free-flowing through traffic on the crossroad; such through traffic thus bypasses the signalized intersection. The remaining intersection, free of the crossroad&#x27;s through traffic, uses a two-phase traffic signal for handling the left turns in pairs, similar to the traffic flow at an inverted SPUI.

Examples include:
* Jalan Tun Abdul Razak (Federal Route 1) in Johor Bahru, Johor, Malaysia, at Jalan Lingkaran Daram (Federal Route 188). Jalan Lingkaran Daram passes over the SPUI. ().
* Central Expressway (CTE) in Singapore, at Braddell Underpass. Braddell Road passes under the SPUI. ();
* Jinxing Avenue (Chinese: 金星大道 Pinyin: Jīnxīng dàdào) in Yubei District, Chongqing, China, at Food City Avenue (Chinese: 食品城大道 Pinyin: Shípǐn chéng dàdào). This is a partial three-level SPUI in which one of the ramps from Food City Avenue to Jinxing Avenue passes under the SPUI. ().

<text>John Colin Campbell Davidson, 1st Viscount Davidson, (23 February 1889 – 11 December 1970), known before his elevation to the peerage as J. C. C. Davidson, was a British civil servant and Conservative Party politician, best known for his close alliance with Stanley Baldwin. Initially a civil servant, Davidson was private secretary to Bonar Law between 1915 and 1920. After entering parliament in 1920, he served under Baldwin as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster between 1923 and 1924 and as Parliamentary and Financial Secretary to the Admiralty between 1924 and 1926. From 1926 to 1930 he was Chairman of the Conservative Party. He was once again Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster between 1931 and 1937, firstly under Ramsay MacDonald and from 1935 onwards under Baldwin. On Baldwin&#x27;s retirement in 1937, Davidson left the House of Commons and was ennobled as Viscount Davidson. Despite being only 48, he never took any further active part in politics. His wife Frances, Viscountess Davidson, succeeded him as MP for Hemel Hempstead. Lord Davidson died in London in 1970.

==Background and education==
Davidson was born at Aberdeen, the younger child and only son of Sir James Mackenzie Davidson, a physician and pioneer of X-rays, by Georgina Barbara Watt Henderson, daughter of William Henderson, of Aberdeen. His grandfather John Davidson had accumulated a large fortune in Argentina, of which Davidson inherited a half. He was educated at Fretherne House preparatory school, Westminster and Pembroke College, Cambridge, and was called to the Bar, Middle Temple, in 1913.

==Civil service career, 1910–1920==
After leaving Cambridge in 1910, Davidson joined the Colonial Office, where he became unpaid private secretary to Lord Crewe, the Secretary of State for the Colonies. He continued in this post when Lewis Harcourt succeeded Crewe as Colonial secretary at the end of 1910. Davidson was anxious to serve in the First World War, but Harcourt considered him so valuable that he managed to convince him to stay at the Colonial Office. In 1915 Bonar Law replaced Harcourt as head of the Colonial Office, and was urged to retain Davidson as private secretary. They became close friends and Law came to rely as heavily on Davidson as Harcourt had done.

In December 1916 Bonar Law was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer and Leader of the House of Commons and insisted on taking Davidson with him as private secretary. Davidson managed to persuade Bonar Law to employ Stanley Baldwin as his Parliamentary Private Secretary, a move that would have far-reaching consequences for Davidson himself and for the nation&#x27;s history. Baldwin had up until then been an obscure back-bench MP, but his appointment as PPS to Bonar Law was his first move on the ladder of promotion. Davidson and Baldwin developed a close friendship which lasted until Baldwin&#x27;s death in 1947. In 1918 he was responsible for the final draft of the &quot;coupon&quot; endorsing parliamentary candidates in the general election as representatives of the coalition government. In 1919 he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB).

==Political career, 1920–1937==
Davidson entered parliament unopposed for Hemel Hempstead in 1920 by-election and became Parliamentary Private Secretary to Bonar Law, then Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the House of Commons. The latter resigned on the grounds of ill health in May 1921, when Davidson became PPS to Stanley Baldwin, who by then had become President of the Board of Trade. The following year he urged Bonar Law to return and accept the leadership of the Conservative Party if the party voted against continuing the coalition government headed by David Lloyd George. Despite the wishes of the party leadership, a majority of MP&#x27;s voted against continuing the coalition at the Carlton Club meeting in October 1922. Austen Chamberlain resigned as party leader and was succeeded by Bonar Law. Shortly afterwards Bonar Law was asked to form a government and once again appointed Davidson as his Parliamentary Private Secretary and unofficial unpaid private secretary.

Bonar Law resigned in May 1923 after his health collapsed. Davidson was appointed a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in the short resignation honours list which was issued that same month. Stanley Baldwin was chosen to succeed Bonar Law as Prime Minister over the claims of Lord Curzon. In his biography of Davidson in the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, Robert Blake writes that Davidson&#x27;s role in the appointment of Baldwin remains a puzzle. Lord Stamfordham, George V&#x27;s private secretary, sounded out Davidson on Bonar Law&#x27;s wishes for his successor. Bonar Law, now gravely ill, asked not to be involved, but it was apparent that he favoured Baldwin although he could not overlook the claims of party grandee, Curzon. In 1954, a memorandum was found in the Royal Archives that had obviously been dictated by Davidson and clearly argued for the claims of Baldwin over Curzon. The note had been handed over to Stamfordham by Sir Ronald Waterhouse, another of Bonar Law&#x27;s secretaries, at the same time as his official resignation as Prime Minister. Stamfordham had noted on the memorandum that it &quot;practically expressed the views of Mr. Bonar Law&quot;. According to Blake, there was nothing in the memorandum to substantiate that claim. Davidson subsequently said that he had dictated the note after being asked by Stamfordham about the opinion of back-bench MP&#x27;s. However, Blake argued, &quot;In any case, the result [Baldwin as Bonar Law&#x27;s successor] was affected only marginally. The King&#x27;s decision was firmly based on his own good sense and the powerful arguments of Balfour against the choice of a peer as prime minister&quot;.

Following the appointment of Baldwin as prime minister, Davidson entered the government as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and effectively continued as the prime minister&#x27;s private secretary. However, he lost his seat in parliament at the general election of December 1923, but regained it already in the general election in October the following year. Baldwin once again formed an administration after the brief first-ever 1924 Labour government, and made Davidson Parliamentary and Financial Secretary to the Admiralty. In this post he was forced to deal with cuts in naval expenditure proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Winston Churchill, especially regarding the construction of new cruisers. He served as deputy chief civil commissioner during the general strike of 1926, with responsibility for publicity. He also managed the short-lived &quot;British Gazette&quot; during the strike and arranged for the broadcasting of official bulletins.

In 1926 Davidson left the government to take up the post of Chairman of the Conservative Party, which he remained until 1930. He was primarily charged with raising cash for the party and cleaning up the honours system, which had fallen into disrepute following informal cash-for-honours system instigated by Lloyd George in 1918. He was also the driving force behind the establishment of Ashridge in memory of Bonar Law. In 1928 he was sworn of the Privy Council. According to Blake, Davidson &quot;left a lasting imprint on the organization of the party, including the creation of the Research Department, and many of the changes attributed to his successor, Neville Chamberlain, were in fact his&quot;. However, Davidson came under criticism after the defeat at the 1929 general election and resigned in 1930.

In November 1931 Davidson was once again appointed Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in the National Government headed by Ramsay MacDonald. He was chairman of the Indian States inquiry committee and travelled to India in 1932 and was made a member of the joint select committee whose proposals resulted in the Government of India Act 1935. He declined the governorship of Bombay. He invited Joachim von Ribbentrop to meet with Stanley Baldwin for the first time in Westminster to discuss Hitler&#x27;s ideas about equality in armaments. He remained Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster when Baldwin became Prime Minister for the third time in 1935, although he was never a member of the cabinet. The latter year he was also made a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (GCVO). He stepped from the government and the House of Commons after Neville Chamberlain became Prime Minister in May 1937. The following June he was elevated to the peerage as Viscount Davidson, of Little Gaddesden in the County of Hertford. He was succeeded as MP by his wife, Frances, Viscountess Davidson (see below).

==Later career, 1937–1970==
Despite being only 48 at the time of his elevation to the peerage, Davidson took no further active part in political life. He remained involved with Ashridge and his business affairs. During the Second World War he was with the Ministry of Information between 1940 and 1941 and made an official tour of South America in 1942. This was followed in 1943 with his foundation of Canning House, an important centre for Latin American culture and education. Blake writes of Davidson: &quot;A man of much charm and geniality, bespectacled and ruddy complexioned, Davidson could be very tough. He was essentially one who operated behind the scenes rather than on the front of the stage. A streak of Scottish puritanism put him emphatically on the side of the &#x27;respectable&#x27;. He had no sympathy with the buccaneers – Lloyd George, Churchill, Birkenhead, Beaverbrook. He was deeply devoted to Baldwin who owed a great debt to his advice, companionship, and support.&quot;

==Marriage and children==
Davidson married Frances Joan &quot;Mimi&quot; Dickinson, daughter of Sir Willoughby Dickinson, later Lord Dickinson of Painswick, in 1919. They had two sons and two daughters:

* Hon Margaret Joan Davidson (24 June 1922 – 11 May 2008)
* Hon Jean Elizabeth Davidson (19 June 1924 – 15 August 2020), married the Hon Charles Strutt, son of Robert Strutt, 4th Baron Rayleigh. They had three children, the youngest of whom is John Gerald Strutt, 6th Baron Rayleigh and the eldest is Anne Jenkin, Baroness Jenkin of Kennington.
* John Andrew Davidson, 2nd Viscount Davidson (22 December 1928 – 22 July 2012)
* Malcolm William Mackenzie Davidson, 3rd Viscount Davidson (28 August 1934 – 27 September 2019)

Lady Davidson remained MP for Hemel Hempstead until 1959, and was created a life peer as Baroness Northchurch in 1963. Lord and Lady Davidson thereby became one of the few couples who both held titles in their own right.

==Death==
Lord Davidson died in London in December 1970, at the age of 81. He was succeeded in the viscountcy by his eldest son Andrew, who also became a Conservative government minister. Andrew died in 2012 and the title passed to his brother Malcolm who became the 3rd Viscount.

Viscountess Davidson died in November 1985, aged 91.

==In popular culture==
Davidson was featured prominently in Jack Thorne&#x27;s 2023 play &quot;When Winston Went to War with the Wireless&quot;, played by Ravin J Ganatra.

<doc id="1188217" wikidata="Q6702207" url="?curid=1188217" title="Luke O'Connor">
<text>Major-General Sir Luke O&#x27;Connor, (20 January 1831 – 1 February 1915) was an Irish-born soldier who served in the British Army. He was the first soldier to receive the Victoria Cross, Britain&#x27;s highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy.

==Background==
Luke O&#x27;Connor was born in Kilcroy, Hillstreet, in the parish of Aughrim, Co Roscommon in Ireland. He was born to James O&#x27;Connor (born 1800) and Mary Gannon. He and his family were evicted from their farm because they were unable to pay the rent and decided to move to North America in 1839 in search of opportunity. His father James died at sea en route and his mother and a baby brother died at Grosse Isle, Quebec on arrival of cholera. Although Luke returned to Ireland as a boy, some of his other siblings remained in North America and fought in the American Civil War.

==Military==
He enlisted in the British Army as a young man. At the age of 23, he was a sergeant in the 23rd Regiment of Foot (later The Royal Welch Fusiliers). During the Crimean War, the 23rd Foot were part of the British force sent to the Crimea. On 20 September 1854, at the Battle of the Alma, Sergeant O&#x27;Connor was advancing between two officers, carrying the Colour, when one of them was mortally wounded. Sergeant O&#x27;Connor was also shot at the same time, but recovering himself, he snatched up the Colour from the ground and continued to carry it until the end of the action, although urged to retire to the rear on account of his wounds. He also acted with great gallantry at the assault on the Redan (8 September 1855) where he was shot through both thighs.

The Victoria Cross did not exist at that time, but when it was created in 1856 O&#x27;Connor was one of the 62 Crimean veterans invested by Queen Victoria at Hyde Park on 26 June 1857.

In June 1906 he was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1906 Birthday Honours. He later achieved the rank of major general and was appointed colonel of his old regiment on 3 June 1914. His VC is displayed at the Royal Welch Fusiliers Museum in Caernarfon Castle, Gwynedd, Wales.

==Death==
He died in Clarges Street, London, on 1 February 1915. He is buried at St Mary&#x27;s Catholic Cemetery, Kensal Green, London.

<text>Cynthia Lynne Cooper-Dyke (born April 14, 1963) is an American basketball coach and former player who has won championships in college, in the Olympics, and in the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA). She is considered by many as one of the greatest female basketball players ever. In 2011, Cooper-Dyke was voted by fans as one of the Top 15 players in WNBA history. Upon the league&#x27;s formation, she played for the Houston Comets from 1997 to 2000, being named the Most Valuable Player of the WNBA Finals in all four seasons, and returned to play again in 2003. Cooper-Dyke still holds the record for most Finals MVPs with four. On April 30, 2019, she was introduced as the head coach for the Texas Southern Lady Tigers basketball team, a position she held in the 2012–13 season. She has also coached at USC, UNC Wilmington, Prairie View A&amp;M, and, professionally, for the Phoenix Mercury. Cooper-Dyke was inducted into the Women&#x27;s Basketball Hall of Fame in 2009 and the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2010.

==Early years==

==Career==

===Team USA===
Cooper was named to represent the US at the 1981 William Jones Cup competition in Taipei, Taiwan, while still in high school. The team won seven of eight games to win the silver medal for the event. Cooper scored 2.8 points per game and recorded nine steals.

Cooper was selected to represent the US at the inaugural Goodwill games, held in Moscow in July 1986. North Carolina State&#x27;s Kay Yow served as head coach. The team opened up with a 72–53 win over Yugoslavia, and followed that with a 21-point win over Brazil 91–70. The third game was against Czechoslovakia and would be much closer. Cheryl Miller was the scoring leader in this game, scoring 26 points to help the US to a 78–70 victory. The US faced Bulgaria in the semi-final match up, and again won, this time 67–58. This set up the final against the Soviet Union, led by 7-foot-2 Ivilana Semenova, considered the most dominant player in the world. The Soviet team, had a 152–2 record in major international competition over the prior three decades, including an 84–82 win over the US in the 1983 World Championships. The Soviets held the early edge, leading 21–19 at one time, before the US went on a scoring run to take a large lead they did not relinquish. The final score was 83–60 in favor of the US, earning the gold medal for the US squad. Cooper averaged 2.0 points per game.

Cooper continued to represent the US with the national team at the 1986 World Championship, held in Moscow, a month after the Goodwill Games in Moscow. The US team was even more dominant this time. The early games were won easily, and the semifinal against Canada, while the closest game for the US so far, ended up an 82–59 victory. At the same time, the Soviet team was winning easily as well, and the final game pitted two teams each with 6–0 records. The Soviet team, having lost only once at home, wanted to show that the Goodwill games setback was a fluke. The US team started by scoring the first eight points, and raced to a 45–23 lead, although the Soviets fought back and reduced the halftime margin to 13. The US went on a 15–1 run in the second half to put the game away, and ended up winning the gold medal with a score of 108–88. Cooper averaged 5.9 points per game.

Cooper played for USA Basketball as part of the 1987 USA Women&#x27;s Pan American Team which won a gold medal in Indianapolis, Indiana. Cooper was a member of the gold medalist 1988 US Olympic Women&#x27;s Basketball Team., and the Bronze Medal team in 1992.

===International===
Cooper played for several teams in the European leagues:
* Samoa Bétera (Spain) 1986–1987 (36.7 ppg)
* Parma (Italy) 1987–1994
* Alcamo (Italy) 1994–1996

During her time playing for Samoa Bétera, a Spanish team, she was the league leading scorer with 36.7 ppg. During the almost ten years she played in the Italian leagues, she was the league&#x27;s leading scorer eight times, and finished second the other two years.

In 1987, she was the MVP of the European All-Star team. She was also named to the All-Star team of the Italian leagues in 1996–1997.

===WNBA===
At the age of 34, Cooper signed to play with the Houston Comets. Cooper has the distinction of scoring the most points out of all players who participated in the first day of the WNBA&#x27;s conception. On June 21, 1997, 58 women across 6 teams suited up to kick off the WNBA&#x27;s first scheduled day of competition. On that day, the Comets earned a 76 - 56 win over the Cleveland Rockers where Cooper recorded 25 points, 8 rebounds, 5 assists, 3 steals and 1 block. She was the only player that day to score 20+ points, thus making her the first player in WNBA history to have a 20-point game.

She led the league in scoring three consecutive years, leading the franchise to a record four WNBA Championships. In addition, she was voted the WNBA&#x27;s MVP in 1997 and 1998 and named Most Valuable Player in each of those four WNBA Finals. Cooper was named the 1998 Sportswoman of the Year (in the team category) by the Women&#x27;s Sports Foundation. During the Comet dynasty, she was a vital part of the triple threat offense with Sheryl Swoopes and Tina Thompson. When retired in 2000, Cooper became the first player in WNBA history to score 500, 1,000, 2,000 and 2,500 career points. She scored 30 or more points in 16 of her 120 games and had a 92-game double-figure scoring streak from 1997 to 2000. She went on to coach the Phoenix Mercury for one and a half seasons (2001–2002).

Cooper returned as an active player in the 2003 season, and played only 4 games during that season with the Comets. Her appearance in the game on May 22, 2003, as a 40-year-old, made her the oldest player, at the time, to play in a WNBA game (later being broken by Nancy Lieberman-Cline who at 50 years old, played a game for the Detroit Shock on July 24, 2008).

Cooper&#x27;s final WNBA game ever was played on June 1, 2003, in a 64 - 68 loss to the Minnesota Lynx with Cooper recording 22 points, 3 rebounds, 4 assists and 2 steals.

Afterward, she served as a TV analyst and halftime reporter for the Houston Rockets of the NBA. Cooper has also been named one of the top 15 players in the WNBA at the 2011 WNBA All-Star game. During Game 1 of the 2016 WNBA Finals, she was named in the WNBA Top 20@20.

<doc id="1188232" wikidata="Q5386260" url="?curid=1188232" title="Eric Charles Twelves Wilson">
<text>Lieutenant Colonel Eric Charles Twelves Wilson VC (2 October 1912 – 23 December 2008) was an English British Army officer and colonial administrator. He received the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. At the time of his death, he was the last surviving British Army recipient of the Victoria Cross in the Second World War, and the earliest and oldest recipient.

==Early life==
Wilson was born at Sandown on the Isle of Wight, where his father Cyril Charles Clissold Wilson was a curate. His mother&#x27;s maiden name was Twelves. His grandfather Charles Thomas Wilson was the first missionary from the Church Mission Society to visit Buganda, in 1877. He was educated at Marlborough College, where fees were reduced for the sons of clergymen, and he became a house captain. Although he wore glasses, he was awarded a prize cadetship to attend the Royal Military College, Sandhurst.

==Military career==
Wilson was commissioned as a second lieutenant in The East Surrey Regiment on 2 February 1933. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant in 1936 and was seconded to the 2nd (Nyasaland) Battalion The King&#x27;s African Rifles in 1937 serving in East Africa, where he learned to speak Nyanja. He was then seconded to the Somaliland Camel Corps in 1939.

In August 1940, Wilson was 27 years old, and by then an acting captain attached to the Somaliland Camel Corps, when Italian forces commanded by General Guglielmo Nasi invaded British Somaliland (now Somaliland). During the Italian conquest of British Somaliland the heavily outnumbered British-led forces made their stand on the hills around Tug Argan. During this battle, from 11 to 15 August 1940 at Observation Hill, Captain Wilson kept a Vickers machine-gun post in action in spite of being wounded and suffering from malaria. Some of his guns were blown to pieces by the enemy&#x27;s field artillery fire, and his spectacles were smashed. He was wounded in the right shoulder and the left eye, and he was assumed to have been killed. For his actions, likened in the &quot;Daily Sketch&quot; to another Rorke&#x27;s Drift, Wilson was awarded the Victoria Cross.

Wilson has the rare distinction of being mistakenly awarded a &quot;posthumous&quot; VC, announced in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; on 16 October 1940. At the time the award was made, he was believed to be missing in action, presumed dead. He had, however, been captured by the Italians. An official report in &quot;The Times&quot; on 16 October indicated that he had survived, but another captured officer was surprised to find the &quot;late&quot; Captain Wilson still alive in a prisoner of war camp in Eritrea.

In 1941, when the Italian forces in East Africa surrendered following the East African Campaign, Wilson was released from captivity. He returned to England and received his Victoria Cross at Buckingham Palace in July 1942. With his captain&#x27;s rank made permanent in 1941, and with the rank of temporary major, he served as adjutant of the Long Range Desert Group and then as second in command of the 11th (Kenyan) King&#x27;s African Rifles, part of the 25th East African Brigade in 11th East African Division, in the Burma Campaign. Having contracted scrub typhus he was hospitalised for two months and then returned to East Africa to command an infantry training establishment at Jinja in Uganda. He was promoted to acting lieutenant-colonel in June 1945 and was seconded to The Northern Rhodesia Regiment in 1946. He retired from the Army in 1949 and although at this time his permanent rank was major, he was granted the honorary rank of lieutenant-colonel.

==Victoria Cross citation==
The formal citation for Wilson&#x27;s VC, published in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; in October 1940 when he was still presumed dead, reads:

==Later life ==
Wilson married Ann Pleydell-Bouverie (a descendant of the Earls of Radnor) in 1943. They had two sons. After they divorced in 1953, Wilson married Angela Joy Gordon, and they had one son.

After Wilson left the Army in 1949, he joined the Overseas Civil Service in Tanganyika. He learned several African languages, and served in Tanganyika until independence of the British East African countries which led to his retirement in 1961.

In 1962 Wilson was appointed Deputy Warden of London House, a residence at Goodenough Square in the Bloomsbury district of London. This residence is for university graduates from the Commonwealth of Nations pursuing graduate studies in the United Kingdom. In 1966 Wilson was promoted to Warden of London House, holding the position until he retired in 1977, after which he lived in Stowell, Somerset.

At the time of his death, he was one of only ten Victoria Cross recipients still alive. He was the last surviving British Army recipient of the Second World War, as well as being the earliest and oldest recipient. His VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.

He suffered from prostate cancer in later life, and died after a stroke. He was buried in Stowell, survived by his second wife and their son, and both of his sons from his first marriage.

<doc id="1188233" wikidata="Q2133160" url="?curid=1188233" title="Ingrain wallpaper">
<text>Ingrain (or wood-chip) wallpaper is a decorating material. It consists of two layers of paper with wood fibre in between; different kinds of ingrain wallpaper are distinguished by the size and form of the fibre pieces.

Ingrain wallpaper was invented by German pharmacist Hugo Erfurt in 1864; marketed by the company his grandfather founded, it was first used as a decoration for shop windows, but began seeing use as a wallpaper from the 1920s on as well.

Ingrain wallpaper is the most commonly used type of wallpaper in Germany. It was also commonplace in the United Kingdom and Ireland from the 1960s onwards, but has since fallen out of favour and become less common there, especially in new builds and more recent redecorations. At least since the noughties, both popcorn ceilings and ingrain wallpapers have had a reputation for being undesirably old-fashioned, especially if encountered together, and also hard to remove. People flipping houses in recent decades in these countries routinely removed both. Unlike popcorn ceilings, ingrain wallpapers never made major inroads in most other parts of the English-speaking world, especially America. Ingrain wallpaper has however remained much more popular in Germany and her neighbouring continental European countries, where it is valued for its tendency to hide small dents and scuff marks, and hence is often retained and simply repainted during renovations. Ultimately ingrain wallpaper can become very difficult to remove once several coats of paint have been applied over the years, but whether that trade-off is widely accepted depends on the country and culture.

<text>Tul Bahadur Pun VC (Nepali: तुल बहादुर पुन; 23 March 192320 April 2011) was a Nepalese Gurkha recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He later achieved the rank of Honorary Lieutenant. In addition to the Victoria Cross, Pun was awarded 10 other medals, including the Burma Star.

==Victoria Cross==

Pun was 21 years old, and a Rifleman in the 3rd Battalion, 6th Gurkha Rifles, in the Indian Army during World War II when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross:

On 23 June 1944 at Mogaung, Burma, during an attack on the railway bridge, a section of one of the platoons was wiped out with the exception of Rifleman Tul Bahadur Pun, his section commander and one other. The section commander immediately led a charge on the enemy position but was at once badly wounded, as was the third man. Rifleman Pun, with a Bren gun continued the charge alone in the face of shattering fire and reaching the position, killed three of the occupants and put five more to flight, capturing two light machine-guns and much ammunition. He then gave accurate supporting fire, enabling the rest of his platoon to reach their objective.

Despite the above text, Pun told a different story in an interview. He told that he had killed four with his gun and three with his kukri. Later he took a flamethrower and killed a further 30 Japanese in a dugout.

Pun was invited, along with other Victoria Cross recipients, to the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II on 2 June 1953. He attended the ceremony at Westminster Abbey, and was invited to the party afterwards at Buckingham Palace.

He made several visits to the United Kingdom, particularly to meet with other members of the Victoria Cross and George Cross Association. He had tea with Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.

== Memorials ==
=== London ===
Pun&#x27;s name is inscribed on the roof of an arched memorial stand at the Memorial Gates, at Constitution Hill, London (at the junction with Duke of Wellington Place, London SW1), along with other volunteers from the Indian subcontinent, Africa, and the Caribbean, who served with the Armed Forces during the First and Second World Wars and received the Victoria Cross or George Cross. The memorial with his name inscribed is directly outside the walled gardens of Buckingham Palace.

In addition, as a recipient of the Victoria Cross, his name is inscribed on memorials at Westminster Abbey and the Union Jack Club, in London, and on the &quot;Memorial to the Chindits&quot; on the north side of the Victoria Embankment next to the Ministry of Defence headquarters in London.
=== Other ===
He has also had a Great Western Railway operated IET unit named after him.

== Immigration controversy ==

In later life Pun suffered from ill-health, including heart problems, asthma and diabetes. He had difficulties getting medical attention and the medical supplies in Nepal, which were needed to keep him alive. He lived at the foothills of the Himalayas in Nepal at 4,000 feet. His house has no proper roof, no electricity, and no running water. In a statement given to his solicitors, Howe &amp; Co, of Ealing, West London, Mr Pun stated that his home had no sanitation and that he was therefore obliged to dig a hole in the surrounding fields to serve as a toilet. He told the British press that he was in constant fear of landslides during the Nepalese monsoon season.

Pun received a British Army pension of £132 per month. In order to receive his monthly pension he had to be driven for three hours and then walk for one full day (being carried by two or three men in a wicker basket) to the Gurkha army camp at Pokhara. If he had ever failed to appear in person at the camp, he would not have received that month&#x27;s pension.

Pun applied in 2006 to the British Embassy in Kathmandu, Nepal, for a visa to settle in the United Kingdom, particularly because of his ill-health and his desire to be with his veteran comrades in the United Kingdom. A British Entry Clearance Officer refused his application for settlement on the ground that he had &quot;failed to demonstrate strong ties with the UK&quot;.

Pun then lodged an appeal against the immigration decision through his solicitors, Howe &amp; Co. The immigration appeal was listed to be heard in August 2007 in London. On 1 June 2007, following widespread media publicity of the British public&#x27;s support of Pun&#x27;s case, the then Minister of State for Immigration Liam Byrne announced:

Pun began his journey to Britain on 1 July 2007. Around one thousand people turned up to see him off. There were traditional Nepali bands outside his home and a motorcade of around 30-50 cars and motorbikes took him to the airport so he could fly to Kathmandu. One of those who turned up to say farewell was old Gurkha friend and fellow VC recipient Lachhiman Gurung, 90, who lost a hand to a Japanese grenade in 1945.

He finally arrived at London, Heathrow, on 4 July and was met with an official guard of honour. Col David Hayes, of the Royal Gurkha Rifles, saluted him and said: &quot;I wish to emphasise the manner in which he&#x27;s revered by serving Gurkhas. His reputation goes before us into battle.&quot; Pun was then driven by limousine to a reception to meet hundreds of members of the public who had helped to bring him to Britain. The reception included many representatives from The Gurkha Ex-Servicemen&#x27;s Organisation (GAESO)—and from the Army Rumour Service website.

Pun commented, &quot;I have never had so much respect as in these two days, leaving Kathmandu and arriving in Britain.&quot;

==Death==
On 20 April 2011, after suffering severe respiratory ailments, Pun died unexpectedly in his home village of Myagdi, Nepal. He had briefly returned to see the completion of a school for the village, a project which he had been involved with.

==Decorations and medals==
