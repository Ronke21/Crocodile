<text>Dermatophyte (from Greek &quot; derma&quot; &quot;skin&quot; ( &quot;dermatos&quot;) and &quot;phyton&quot; &quot;plant&quot;) is a common label for a group of fungus of &quot;Arthrodermataceae&quot; that commonly causes skin disease in animals and humans. Traditionally, these anamorphic (asexual or imperfect fungi) mold genera are: &quot;Microsporum&quot;, &quot;Epidermophyton&quot; and &quot;Trichophyton&quot;. There are about 40 species in these three genera. Species capable of reproducing sexually belong in the teleomorphic genus Arthroderma, of the Ascomycota (see Teleomorph, anamorph and holomorph for more information on this type of fungal life cycle). As of 2019 a total of nine genera are identified and new phylogenetic taxonomy has been proposed.

Dermatophytes cause infections of the skin, hair, and nails, obtaining nutrients from keratinized material. The organisms colonize the keratin tissues causing inflammation as the host responds to metabolic byproducts. Colonies of dermatophytes are usually restricted to the nonliving cornified layer of the epidermis because of their inability to penetrate the viable tissue of an immunocompetent host. Invasion does elicit a host response ranging from mild to severe. Acid proteinases (proteases), elastase, keratinases, and other proteinases reportedly act as virulence factors. Additionally, the products of these degradative enzymes serve as nutrients for the fungi. The development of cell-mediated immunity correlated with delayed hypersensitivity and an inflammatory response is associated with clinical cure, whereas the lack of or defective cell-mediated immunity predisposes the host to chronic or recurrent dermatophyte infection.

Some of these skin infections are known as ringworm or tinea (which is the Latin word for &quot;worm&quot;), though infections are not caused by worms. It is thought that the word tinea (worm) is used to describe the snake-like appearance of the dermatophyte on the skin. Toenail and fingernail infections are referred to as onychomycosis. Dermatophytes usually do not invade living tissues, but colonize the outer layer of the skin. Occasionally the organisms do invade subcutaneous tissues, resulting in kerion development.

== Types of infections ==
Infections by dermatophytes affect the superficial skin, hair, and nails are named using &quot;tinea&quot; followed by the Latin term for the area that is affected. Manifestation of infection tends to involve erythema, induration, itching, and scaling. Dermatophytoses tend to occur in moist areas and skin folds. The degree of infection depends on the specific site of infection, the fungal species, and the host inflammatory response.

Although symptoms can be barely noticeable in some cases, dermatophytoses can produce &quot;chronic progressive eruptions that last months or years, causing considerable discomfort and disfiguration.&quot; Dermatophytoses are generally painless and are not life-threatening. 
===Tinea pedis or athlete&#x27;s foot===
Contrary to the name, tinea pedis does not solely affect athletes. Tinea pedis affects men more than women, and is uncommon in children. Even in developed countries, tinea pedis is one of the most common superficial skin infections by fungi.

The infection can be seen between toes (interdigital pattern) and may spread to the sole of the foot in a &quot;moccasin&quot; pattern. In some cases, the infection may progress into a &quot;vesiculobullous pattern&quot; in which small, fluid-filled blisters are present. The lesions may be accompanied by peeling, maceration (peeling due to moisture), and itching.

Later stages of tinea pedis might include hyperkeratosis (thickened skin) of the soles, as well as bacterial infection (by streptococcus and staphylococcus) or cellulitis due to fissures developing between the toes.

Another implication of tinea pedis, especially for older adults or those with vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, or nail trauma, is onychomycosis of the toenails. Nails become thick, discolored, and brittle, and often onycholysis (painless separation of nail from nail bed) occurs.

===Tinea cruris or jock itch===
More commonly occurs in men than women. Tinea cruris may be exacerbated by sweat and tight clothing (hence the term &quot;jock itch&quot;). Frequently, the feet are also involved. The theory is that the feet get infected first from contact with the ground. The fungus spores are carried to the groin from scratching from putting on underclothing or pants. The infection frequently extends from the groin to the perianal skin and gluteal cleft.

The rashes appear red, scaly, and pustular, and is often accompanied by itch. Tinea cruris should be differentiated from other similar dermal conditions such as intertriginous candidiasis, erythrasma, and psoriasis.

===Tinea corporis or ringworm of the body===

Lesions appear as round, red, scaly, patches with well-defined, raised edges, often with a central clearing and very itchy (usually on trunk, limbs, and also in other body parts). The lesions can be confused with contact dermatitis, eczema, and psoriasis.

===Tinea faciei or facial ringworm===
Round or ring shaped red patches may occur on non-bearded areas of the face. This type of dermatophytosis can have a subtle appearance, sometimes known as &quot;tine incognito&quot;. It can be misdiagnosed for other conditions like psoriasis, discoid lupus, etc. and might be aggravated by treatment with immunosuppressive topical steroid creams.

===Tinea capitis or scalp (&quot;blackdot&quot;) ringworm===
Children from ages 3–7 are most commonly infected with tinea capitis. &quot;Trichophyton tonsurans&quot; is the most common cause of out breaks of tinea capitis in children, and is the main cause of endothrix (inside hair) infections. &quot;Trichophyton rubrum&quot; is also a very common cause of favus, a form of tinea capitis in which crusts are seen on the scalp.

Infected hair shafts are broken off just at the base, leaving a black dot just under the surface of the skin, and alopecia can result. Scraping these residual black dot will yield the best diagnostic scrapings for microscopic exam. Numerous green arthrospores will be seen under the microscope inside the stubbles of broken hair shafts at 400×. Tinea capitis cannot be treated topically, and must be treated systemically with antifungals.

===Tinea manuum or ringworm of the hands===
In most cases of tinea manuum, only one hand is involved. Frequently both feet are involved concurrently, thus the saying &quot;one hand, two feet&quot;.

===Onychomycosis, tinea unguium, or ringworm of the nail===
See Onychomycosis

=== Tinea incognito ===
Ringworm infections modified by corticosteroids, systemic or topical, prescribed for some pre-existing pathology or given mistakenly for the treatment of misdiagnosed tinea.

== Pathogenesis ==
In order for dermatophytoses to occur, the fungus must directly contact the skin. Likelihood of infection is increased if the skin integrity is compromised, as in minor breaks.

The fungi use various proteinases to establish infection in the keratinized stratum corneum. Some studies also suggest that a class of proteins called LysM coat the fungal cell walls to help the fungi evade host cell immune response.

The course of infection varies between each case, and may be determined by several factors including: &quot;the anatomic location, the degree of skin moisture, the dynamics of skin growth and desquamation, the speed and extent of the inflammatory response, and the infecting species.&quot;

The ring shape of dermatophyte lesions result from outward growth of the fungi. The fungi spread in a centrifugal pattern in the stratum corneum, which is the outermost keratinized layer of the skin.

For nail infections, the growth initiates through the lateral or superficial nail plates, then continues throughout the nail. For hair infections, fungal invasion begins at the hair shaft.

Symptoms manifest from inflammatory reactions due to the fungal antigens. The rapid turnover of desquamation, or skin peeling, due to inflammation limits dermatophytoses, as the fungi are pushed out of the skin.

Dermatophytoses rarely cause serious illness, as the fungi infection tends to be limited to the superficial skin. The infection tends to self-resolve so long as the fungal growth does not exceed inflammatory response and desquamation rate is sufficient. If immune response is insufficient, however, infection may progress to chronic inflammation.

== Immune response ==
Fortunately, dermatophytoses soon progress from the inflammatory stage to spontaneous healing, which is largely cell-mediated. Fungi are destroyed via oxidative pathways by phagocytes both intracellularly and extracellularly. T-cell-mediated response using TH1 cells are likely responsible for controlling infection. It is unclear whether the antifungal antibodies formed in response to the infection play a role in immunity.

Infection may become chronic and widespread if the host has a compromised immune system and is receiving treatment that reduces T-lymphocyte function. Also, the responsible species for chronic infections in both normal and immunocompromised patients tends to be &quot;Trichophyton rubrum;&quot; immune response tends to be hyporeactive&quot;.&quot; However, &quot;the clinical manifestations of these infections are largely due to delayed-type hypersensitivity responses to these agents rather than from direct effects of the fungus on the host.&quot;

== Diagnosis and identification ==
Usually, dermatophyte infections can be diagnosed by their appearance. However, a confirmatory rapid in-office test can also be conducted, which entails using a scalpel to scrape off a lesion sample from the nail, skin, or scalp and transferring it to a slide. Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is added to the slide and the sample is examined with a microscope to determine presence of hyphae. Care should be taken in procurement of a sample, as false-negative results may occur if the patient is already using an antifungal, if too small a sample is obtained, or if sample from a wrong site is collected.

Additionally, a Wood&#x27;s lamp examination (ultraviolet light) may be used to diagnose specific dermatophytes that fluoresce. Should there be an outbreak or if a patient is not responding well to therapy, sometimes a fungal culture is indicated. A fungal culture is also used when long-term oral therapy is being considered.

Fungal culture medium can be used for positive identification of the species. The fungi tend to grow well at 25 degrees Celsius on Sabouraud agar within a few days to a few weeks. In the culture, characteristic septate hyphae can be seen interspersed among the epithelial cells, and the conidia may form either on the hyphae or on conidiophores. Trichophyton tonsurans, the causative agent of tinea capitis (scalp infection) can be seen as solidly packed arthrospores within the broken hairshafts scraped from the plugged black dots of the scalp. Microscopic morphology of the micro- and macroconidia is the most reliable identification character, but both good slide preparation and stimulation of sporulation in some strains are needed. While small microconidia may not always form, the larger macroconidia aids in identification of the fungal species.

Culture characteristics such as surface texture, topography and pigmentation are variable, so they are the least reliable criteria for identification. Clinical information such as the appearance of the lesion, site, geographic location, travel history, animal contacts and race is also important, especially in identifying rare non-sporulating species like &quot;Trichophyton concentricum&quot;, &quot;Microsporum audouinii&quot; and &quot;Trichophyton schoenleinii&quot;.

A special agar called Dermatophyte Test Medium (DTM) has been formulated to grow and identify dermatophytes. Without having to look at the colony, the hyphae, or macroconidia, one can identify the dermatophyte by a simple color test. The specimen (scraping from skin, nail, or hair) is embedded in the DTM culture medium. It is incubated at room temperature for 10 to 14 days. If the fungus is a dermatophyte, the medium will turn bright red. If the fungus is not a dermatophyte, no color change will be noted. If kept beyond 14 days, false positive can result even with non-dermatophytes. Specimen from the DTM can be sent for species identification if desired.

Often dermatophyte infection may resemble other inflammatory skin disorders or dermatitis, thus leading to misdiagnosis of fungal infections.

== Transmission ==
Dermatophytes are transmitted by direct contact
with an infected host (human or animal) or by direct or indirect contact
with infected shed skin or hair in fomites such as clothing, combs, hair brushes, theatre seats, caps, furniture, bed linens, shoes, socks, towels, hotel rugs, sauna, bathhouse, and locker room floors. Also, transmission may occur from soil-to-skin contact. Depending on the species the organism may be viable in the environment for up to 15 months.

While even healthy individuals may become infected, there is an increased susceptibility to infection when there is a preexisting injury to the skin such as scars, burns, excessive temperature and humidity. Adaptation to growth on humans by most geophilic species resulted in diminished loss of sporulation, sexuality, and other soil-associated characteristics.

== Classification ==
Dermatophytes are classified as anthropophilic (humans), zoophilic (animals) or geophilic (soil) according to their normal habitat.
* Anthropophilic dermatophytes are restricted to human hosts and produce a mild, chronic inflammation. 
* Zoophilic organisms are found primarily in animals and cause marked inflammatory reactions in humans who have contact with infected cats, dogs, cattle, horses, birds, or other animals. Infection may also be transmitted via indirect contact with infected animals, such as by their hair. This is followed by a rapid termination of the infection.
* Geophilic species are usually recovered from the soil but occasionally infect humans and animals. They cause a marked inflammatory reaction, which limits the spread of the infection and may lead to a spontaneous cure but may also leave scars.

===Sexual reproduction===

Dermatophytes reproduce sexually by either of two modes, heterothallism or homothallism. In heterothallic species, interaction of two individuals with compatible mating types are required in order for sexual reproduction to occur. In contrast, homothallic fungi are self-fertile and can complete a sexual cycle without a partner of opposite mating type. Both types of sexual reproduction involve meiosis.

== Frequency of species ==
In North America and Europe, the nine most common dermatophyte species are:

* &quot;Trichophyton: rubrum, tonsurans, mentagrophytes, verrucosum, and schoenlenii&quot;
* &quot;Microsporum: canis, audouinii, and gypseum&quot;
* &quot;Epidermophyton: floccosum&quot;
*About 76% of the dermatophyte species isolated from humans are &quot;Trichophyton rubrum&quot;.
* 27% are &quot;Trichophyton mentagrophytes&quot;
* 7% are &quot;Trichophyton verrucosum&quot;
* 3% are &quot;Trichophyton tonsurans&quot;
* Infrequently isolated (less than 1%) are &quot;Epidermophyton floccosum&quot;, &quot;Microsporum audouinii&quot;, &quot;Microsporum canis&quot;, &quot;Microsporum equinum&quot;, &quot;Microsporum nanum&quot;, &quot;Microsporum versicolor&quot;, &quot;Trichophyton equinum&quot;, &quot;Trichophyton kanei&quot;, &quot;Trichophyton raubitschekii&quot;, and &quot;Trichophyton violaceum&quot;.

The mixture of species is quite different in domesticated animals and pets (see ringworm for details).

== Epidemiology ==
Since dermatophytes are found worldwide, infections by these fungi are extremely common.

Infections occur more in males than in females, as the predominantly female hormone, progesterone, inhibits the growth of dermatophyte fungi.

== Medications ==
General medications for dermatophyte infections include topical ointments.

* Topical medications like clotrimazole, butenafine, miconazole, and terbinafine.
* Systemic medications (oral) like fluconazole, griseofulvin, terbinafine, and itraconazole.

For extensive skin lesions, itraconazole and terbinafine can speed up healing. Terbinafine is preferred over itraconazole due to fewer drug interactions.

== Treatment ==
Tinea corpora (body), tinea manus (hands), tinea cruris (groin), tinea pedis (foot) and tinea facie (face) can be treated topically.

Tinea unguium (nails) usually will require oral treatment with terbinafine, itraconazole, or griseofulvin. Griseofulvin is usually not as effective as terbinafine or itraconazole. A lacquer (Penlac) can be used daily, but is ineffective unless combined with aggressive debridement of the affected nail.

Tinea capitis (scalp) must be treated orally, as the medication must be present deep in the hair follicles to eradicate the fungus. Usually griseofulvin is given orally for 2 to 3 months. Clinically dosage up to twice the recommended dose might be used due to relative resistance of some strains of dermatophytes.

Tinea pedis is usually treated with topical medicines, like ketoconazole or terbinafine, and pills, or with medicines that contains miconazole, clotrimazole, or tolnaftate. Antibiotics may be necessary to treat secondary bacterial infections that occur in addition to the fungus (for example, from scratching).

Tinea cruris (groin) should be kept dry as much as possible.

<text>Tiberius Claudius Balbillus Modestus (3 – 79), more commonly known as Tiberius Claudius Balbilus, was a distinguished Ancient Roman scholar, politician and a court astrologer to the Roman emperors Claudius, Nero, and Vespasian.

== Forms of his name ==
Other forms of Balbilus&#x27;s name include the Latin forms Tiberius Claudius Balbillus, Barbillus, Babilus, Balbillus and Balbillus the Wise, Greek forms include &#x27;, modern Greek transliteration &#x27;.

==Descent, family background and early life==
It is assumed that the birthplace of Balbilus was Alexandria in Roman Egypt. Balbilus was a Roman Egyptian nobleman mostly of Greek but partly of Armenian and Median descent. Balbilus was the son and the younger child born to Tiberius Claudius Thrasyllus. Thrasyllus was a grammarian, literary commentator, and court astrologer who became the personal friend of the Roman emperor Tiberius.

Balbilus had one known sibling, an elder unnamed sister, who married the Eques Lucius Ennius. Through her, Balbilus was the maternal uncle of Ennia Thrasylla who married the Praetorian prefect of the Praetorian Guard Naevius Sutorius Macro and perhaps, Lucius Ennius who was the father of Lucius Ennius Ferox, a Roman soldier who served during the reign of the Roman emperor Vespasian from 69 until 79. Although Balbilus was born and raised in Egypt, he was of the Roman equestrian order. Balbilus was a friend of Tiberius’ nephew, Claudius, whom Balbilus knew from when they were children and had met at his father&#x27;s house.

A surviving papyrus found in Theogonis in Egypt, dated 26 August 34, mentions Balbilus as one of the owners of a bathhouse located in the city and the Papyrus mentions the Lease of the Bathhouse and taxation paid from its revenue. A second papyrus dated to his tenure in Egypt is a draft of a petition from tax collectors to excuse them from collecting the poll taxes for several villages where the inhabitants have either fled out of poverty or died without leaving heirs. At some date in the reign of Caligula, Balbilus left Rome and returned to Alexandria.

==Political career==
Balbilus military and political career began when Claudius came to the imperial throne. Following the assassination of Caligula (January 41), Balbilus returned to Rome to support Claudius. Balbilus accompanied Claudius on his expedition to Britain in 43, serving as a military tribune in Legio XX Valeria Victrix and as the Commander of the Military Engineers. When Claudius returned with the Roman Legions from Britain to Rome, Balbilus was awarded a crown of honour.

According to Suetonius, Claudius awarded Balbilus a Hasta Pura and perhaps a corona aurea during the Triumph to celebrate the conquest of Britain in 44. As Balbilus was a part of his retinue, it seems likely that his awards, as much as his military rank, were honorary.

Balbilus was one of the highest ranking Equestrian Magistrates who served in Rome. After Balbilus returned to Rome from the Roman conquest of Britain, he received an important post in Egypt. While in Alexandria, Balbilus was appointed High Priest at the Temple of Hermes and Director of the Library, he split his time between Alexandria and Rome. Sometime later he served as a Procurator of the Asia province.

In October 54, Claudius died and was succeeded by Nero as Roman emperor. Under Nero, Balbilus was appointed Prefect of Egypt where he served from 55 until 59. After his prefecture ended in Egypt, Balbilus continued to live in Alexandria.

==Astrology==
Balbilus followed his father in developing skills in astrology. He became a leading astrologer of his time in Rome. He remained in Rome during Claudius’ reign as his advisor, after Claudius had passed an edict expelling all astrologers from the city. Balbilus foretold an eclipse which fell on one of the emperor&#x27;s birthdays.

During the reign of Nero, Balbilus served as an astrological adviser to him and his mother, Agrippina the Younger. A comet had passed across the sky in either 60 or 64, signalling the death of a great personage. Balbilus tried to calm Nero&#x27;s fears by noting that the usual solution was to murder prominent citizens, thus appeasing the gods and Nero agreed, killing many nobles. As Balbilus proved to be a capable (and wily) astrologer, he avoided the fatal end of many astrologers under Nero.

During the reign of Roman emperor Vespasian from 69 until 79, Balbilus returned to Rome from Alexandria and served as an astrologer to Vespasian.

Balbilus was a learned man. Seneca the Younger describes him as ‘an excellent man of most rare learning in every branch of studies’. He wrote an astrology treatise, titled &quot;Astrologumena&quot;, of which only fragments have survived. The book was addressed to Hermogenes.

==Family and issue==
The identity of the wife of Balbilus is unknown; most probably she was a Greek noblewoman from the aristocracy of the Roman Near East. There is a possibility that the wife of Balbilus may have been royalty, possibly Commagenian. By his wife Balbilus had a daughter called Claudia Capitolina. The nomen &quot;Claudia&quot; she inherited from her father&#x27;s family while the Cognomen &quot;Capitolina&quot;, she may have inherited from her mother&#x27;s family.

In 64, Capitolina married her cousin, Gaius Julius Archelaus Antiochus Epiphanes, son of King Antiochus IV of Commagene, and his sister-wife, Queen Iotapa. Capitolina bore Epiphanes one son, called Gaius Julius Antiochus Epiphanes Philopappos and one daughter, called Julia Balbilla.

Balbilus has two further namesakes the Emesene Priests of the cult of El-Gebal in Rome, Tiberius Julius Balbillus and his relative, Titus Julius Balbillus who lived in the second half of the 2nd century and the first half of the 3rd century. Like Balbilus, both were descendants of the King Antiochus I of Commagene, through Balbilus’ maternal aunt Iotapa who married into the Emesene dynasty.

==Posthumous honours==
In his later years Balbilus lived in Ephesus. Vespasian granted privileges to him and his city of Ephesus because of his proficiency as an astrologer. Balbilus died in 79, possibly in June of that year.

As Vespasian thought very highly of him, he dedicated and allowed Ephesians to institute games held in his honour. These games became a sporting festival called the &quot;Balbillean Games&quot;. This festival was held at Ephesus from 79 well into the 3rd century. An inscription in Ephesus honours Balbilus and his daughter.

Balbilus was honoured by his granddaughter Julia Balbilla in two epigrams in Aeolic Greek which are dated to 130. The two epigrams are a part of four epigrams recorded which are inscribed and are preserved on the lower sections of one of the Colossi of Memnon. These are two massive stone statues built by the Egyptian Pharaoh Amenhotep III (flourished 14th century BC), to stand guard at the entrance of Amenhotep&#x27;s memorial temple. Balbilla had lived in Egypt and was an escort to the Roman emperor Hadrian and his wife, Vibia Sabina when they visited the country. The inscriptions that Balbilla commissioned commemorated their visit to Egypt.

In the inscriptions on the Colossi of Memnon, Balbilla acknowledged and made reference to her royal and aristocratic descent. In the last two lines of the second epigram, she honours her family including Balbilus:

The fourth and final epigram, Balbilla dedicates to her parents and grandfathers. This epigram is dedicated also to her noble and aristocratic blood. In the epigram, Balbilla mentions that Balbilus has royal lineage.

==Balbilus in fiction==
* The Hasta Pura of Balbilus is mentioned in the second part of the novel series, written by Robert Graves, &quot;I, Claudius&quot; and &quot;Claudius the God&quot;. Graves calls the decoration an &quot;arrow without a head&quot; and refers to its award to Balbilus.
* Balbilus&#x27;s role as court astrologer is referred to throughout the fourth to sixth parts of the novel series &quot;Romanike&quot; by Codex Regius (2006–2014)
* The character of Barbillus in the Cambridge Latin Course, a wealthy but superstitious Alexandrian with an interest in astrology living around AD 79, is based on Balbilus.

<doc id="1181756" wikidata="Q1043778" url="?curid=1181756" title="Carmichael function">
<text>In number theory, a branch of mathematics, the Carmichael function of a positive integer is the smallest positive integer such that
:formula_1
holds for every integer coprime to . In algebraic terms, is the exponent of the multiplicative group of integers modulo. As this is a finite abelian group, there must exist an element whose order equals the exponent, . Such an element is called a primitive -root modulo.

The Carmichael function is named after the American mathematician Robert Carmichael who defined it in 1910. It is also known as Carmichael&#x27;s λ function, the reduced totient function, and the least universal exponent function.

The order of the multiplicative group of integers modulo is , where is Euler&#x27;s totient function. Since the order of an element of a finite group divides the order of the group, divides . The following table compares the first 36 values of and (in bold if they are different; the s such that they are different are listed in ).

==Numerical examples==
* . The set of numbers less than and coprime to 5 is }. Hence Euler&#x27;s totient function has value and the value of Carmichael&#x27;s function, , must be a divisor of 4. The divisor 1 does not satisfy the definition of Carmichael&#x27;s function since formula_2 except for formula_3. Neither does 2 since formula_4. Hence . Indeed, formula_5. Both 2 and 3 are primitive -roots modulo 5 and also primitive roots modulo 5.
* . The set of numbers less than and coprime to 8 is . Hence and must be a divisor of 4. In fact since formula_6. The primitive -roots modulo 8 are 3, 5, and 7. There are no primitive roots modulo 8.

== Recurrence for ==
The Carmichael lambda function of a prime power can be expressed in terms of the Euler totient. Any number that is not 1 or a prime power can be written uniquely as the product of distinct prime powers, in which case of the product is the least common multiple of the of the prime power factors. Specifically, is given by the recurrence
:formula_7
Euler&#x27;s totient for a prime power, that is, a number with prime and , is given by
:formula_8

== Carmichael&#x27;s theorems ==

Carmichael proved two theorems that, together, establish that if is considered as defined by the recurrence of the previous section, then it satisfies the property stated in the introduction, namely that it is the smallest positive integer such that formula_9 for all relatively prime to .

This implies that the order of every element of the multiplicative group of integers modulo divides . Carmichael calls an element for which formula_10 is the least power of congruent to 1 (mod ) a &quot;primitive λ-root modulo n&quot;. (This is not to be confused with a primitive root modulo, which Carmichael sometimes refers to as a primitive formula_11-root modulo .)

If is one of the primitive -roots guaranteed by the theorem, then formula_12 has no positive integer solutions less than , showing that there is no positive such that formula_9 for all relatively prime to .

The second statement of Theorem 2 does not imply that all primitive -roots modulo are congruent to powers of a single root . For example, if , then while formula_14 and formula_15. There are four primitive -roots modulo 15, namely 2, 7, 8, and 13 as formula_16. The roots 2 and 8 are congruent to powers of each other and the roots 7 and 13 are congruent to powers of each other, but neither 7 nor 13 is congruent to a power of 2 or 8 and vice versa. The other four elements of the multiplicative group modulo 15, namely 1, 4 (which satisfies formula_17), 11, and 14, are not primitive -roots modulo 15.

For a contrasting example, if , then formula_18 and formula_15. There are two primitive -roots modulo 9, namely 2 and 5, each of which is congruent to the fifth power of the other. They are also both primitive formula_11-roots modulo 9.

==Properties of the Carmichael function==
In this section, an integer formula_21 is divisible by a nonzero integer formula_22 if there exists an integer formula_23 such that formula_24. This is written as
:formula_25

===A consequence of minimality of ===

Suppose for all numbers coprime with . Then .

Proof: If with , then 
:formula_26
for all numbers coprime with . It follows that since and is the minimal positive exponent for which the congruence holds for all coprime with .

=== divides ===
This follows from elementary group theory, because the exponent of any finite group must divide the order of the group. is the exponent of the multiplicative group of integers modulo while is the order of that group. In particular, the two must be equal in the cases where the multiplicative group is cyclic due to the existence of a primitive root, which is the case for odd prime powers.

We can thus view Carmichael&#x27;s theorem as a sharpening of Euler&#x27;s theorem.

===Divisibility===

:formula_27

Proof.

By definition, for any integer formula_23 with formula_29 (and thus also formula_30), we have that formula_31 , and therefore formula_32. This establishes that formula_33 for all relatively prime to . By the consequence of minimality proved above, we have formula_34.

===Composition===

For all positive integers and it holds that
:formula_35.
This is an immediate consequence of the recurrence for the Carmichael function.
===Exponential cycle length===

If formula_36 is the biggest exponent in the prime factorization formula_37 of , then for all (including those not coprime to ) and all ,

:formula_38

In particular, for square-free (), for all we have

:formula_39

===Average value===

For any :

:formula_40

(called Erdős approximation in the following) with the constant

:formula_41
and , the Euler–Mascheroni constant.

The following table gives some overview over the first values of the function, for both, the exact average and its Erdős-approximation.

Additionally given is some overview over the more easily accessible with
There, the table entry in row number 26 at column
* → 60.49
indicates that 60.49% (≈ ) of the integers have meaning that the majority of the values is exponential in the length of the input , namely
:formula_42

===Prevailing interval===
For all numbers and all but positive integers (a &quot;prevailing&quot; majority):
:formula_43
with the constant

:formula_44

===Lower bounds===

For any sufficiently large number and for any , there are at most
:formula_45
positive integers such that .

===Minimal order===
For any sequence of positive integers, any constant , and any sufficiently large :
:formula_46

===Small values===

For a constant and any sufficiently large positive , there exists an integer such that
:formula_47
Moreover, is of the form
:formula_48
for some square-free integer .

===Image of the function===
The set of values of the Carmichael function has counting function
:formula_49
where
:formula_50

==Use in cryptography==

The Carmichael function is important in cryptography due to its use in the RSA encryption algorithm.

==Proof of Theorem 1==
For , a prime, Theorem 1 is equivalent to Fermat&#x27;s little theorem:
:formula_51
For prime powers , , if
:formula_52
holds for some integer , then raising both sides to the power gives
:formula_53
for some other integer formula_54. By induction it follows that formula_55 for all relatively prime to and hence to . This establishes the theorem for or any odd prime power.

===Sharpening the result for higher powers of two===
For coprime to (powers of) 2 we have for some integer . Then,
:formula_56,
where formula_57 is an integer. With , this is written
:formula_58
Squaring both sides gives
:formula_59
where formula_60 is an integer. It follows by induction that
:formula_61
for all formula_62 and all coprime to formula_63.

===Integers with multiple prime factors===
By the unique factorization theorem, any can be written in a unique way as
:formula_37
where are primes and are positive integers. The results for prime powers establish that, for formula_65,
:formula_66
From this it follows that
:formula_67
where, as given by the recurrence,
:formula_68
From the Chinese remainder theorem one concludes that
:formula_69

<text>Epicure was an Australian progressive rock band formed in Ballarat, in 1996 as Pima&#x27;s Little Finger. Their original line-up was Juan Alban on vocals and guitar, Tim Bignell on bass guitar, Michael Brown on guitar, Luke Cairnes on guitar and Dom Santamaria on drums. &quot;Armies Against Me&quot; and &quot;Life Sentence&quot;, were picked up by national youth radio, Triple J. These appeared on &quot;The Goodbye Girl&quot; (March 2004), their third album. Both tracks were listed on the Triple J Hottest 100, 2003, whilst the title track of their next extended play, &quot;Self Destruct in Five&quot; (October 2004), made the Triple J Hottest 100, 2004.

In late 2003 they supported United States rock group, Live, on their Australian tour. They played at the Big Day Out festival in January 2004 and at both Falls Festivals in December. The group disbanded in mid-2010 after a final tour, Quietly into the Night.

==History==

Epicure started in 1996 as a school rock band, Pima&#x27;s Little Finger, its five original members Juan Alban, Michael &#x27;Brownie&#x27; Brown, Tim Bignell, Dom Santamaria and Luke Cairnes played their first gig at the Dunnstown Football Club and were booed off stage in favour of Cold Chisel. They released their first recording in 1996 – a demo tape, &quot;The Least of These&quot;. Their base in Ballarat&#x27;s local live music scene was The Rat at the Bridge Mall Inn (now closed). After they released their first extended play, &quot;The Means to an End&quot; (1997), they were signed to Flugelhorn Records and managed by Mark Eatock, who bought the Bridge Mall Inn in early 1999. Triple J radio helped bring Epicure to the Australian consciousness when they added &quot;Feet from Under Me&quot; and &quot;Johnny Venus&quot; to their play lists in 2000. Both appeared on their debut album, &quot;Fold&quot; (August 2000).

Shortly after the release of their second EP, &quot;Elevator&quot; (October 2001), Brown and Cairnes both left and were replaced by Dan Houlihan on lead guitar and Dean Shannon on keyboard. This brought a new feeling to the band, and Shannon became popular with the crowds for his showmanship. In the same month they issued their second album, &quot;Airmail&quot;, which is a compilation of their previous EPs. Their third EP, &quot;Life Sentence&quot;, was independently released with distribution by MGM on 1 September 2003. It peaked at No. 77 on the ARIA Singles Chart. It was recorded by Cam MacKenzie, with tracks mixed by producer, Chris Dickie.

During that year both &quot;Armies Against Me&quot; and &quot;Life Sentence&quot;, were picked up by Triple J. These appeared on their third album, &quot;The Goodbye Girl&quot; (March 2004), which peaked at No. 88 on the ARIA Albums Chart. The band spent 2003–04 touring Australia, particularly in regional areas. They supported shows by Pete Murray, the Beautiful Girls, Xavier Rudd, the Whitlams, and Monique Brumby. A dispute between the band and Shannon occurred in mid-2004, which resulted in his replacement on keyboards by Heath McCurdy. Their third full-length album, &quot;Main Street&quot;, was released in October 2005, and provided the single, &quot;Tightrope Walker&quot;.

In late 2006 Houlihan was replaced by Mick Hubbard (ex-Jen Cloher) on lead guitar. During June–July 2007 the band took a break from recording their next album, &quot;Postcards from a Ghost&quot;, and played support slots for Mia Dyson on the east coast of Australia. Epicure posted a video of recording sessions on Myspace and asked fans to choose between &quot;Landslide&quot; and &quot;Cobra Kisses&quot; for the album&#x27;s lead single – &quot;Cobra Kisses&quot; was chosen and issued. &quot;Postcards from a Ghost&quot; followed in October 2008 via Down in Flames/MGM. For the album aside from the band members they used session musicians: Chris Brodieon pedal steel; Jason Bunn on viola; Dani Fry on backing vocals; Sianne Lee on backing vocals; Caewen Martin on cello; Jodi Moore on electric violin; Stu Syme on tambourine; Jenny Thomas on violin; and Erki Veltheim on viola. In February 2010 the band announced their final tour, Quietly into the Night before disbanding in May.

<doc id="1181773" wikidata="Q7401187" url="?curid=1181773" title="Saint Duthac">
<text>Saint Duthac (also Duthus or Duthak; 1000–1065) was a Scottish Christian prelate who served as Bishop of Ross. He is the patron saint of Tain in Scotland. His feast day is 8 March.

== Biography and legacy ==
According to the &quot;Aberdeen Breviary,&quot; Duthac was a native Scot. Tradition has it that Duthac was born in Tain and educated in Ireland.
A chapel was built in his honour and a sanctuary established at Tain by the great Ferchar mac in tSagairt, first Earl or Mormaer of Ross in the thirteenth century, and was ministered by the Norbertine canons of Fearn Abbey. St. Duthus&#x27;s Chapel, is thought to have been where St Duthac was born. A century later, this sanctuary was notably breached by English supporters who captured Robert the Bruce&#x27;s wife, daughter and sisters sheltering in the chapel. The chapel was burnt later in political violence between regional power groups, namely the Clan MacKay and the Clan Ross. The ruins of the chapel still exist as a centrepiece of St Duthus Old Burial Ground on the shores of the Dornoch Firth.

Saint Duthac was greatly venerated in Scotland and his memory is still preserved in variations, in the names of places and organisations, including Kilduthie; Arduthie near Stonehaven and Kilduich on the Loch Duich. Tain, where he is reputed to have died and been buried, had the Church built in his honour. His death is recorded in the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot; for the year 1065. After many years his body was found to be incorrupt and his relics were translated to the shrine at St. Duthus Collegiate Church built between 1370 and 1458. The ruins of the St Duthus Church are still there but the relics disappeared c. 1560 at the time of the Reformation.

==Veneration==
St Duthac was known as the Chief Confessor of Ireland and Scotland (Dubtach Albanach) and his saint&#x27;s feast day is 8 March. His shrine was visited multiple times by King James IV, Robert the Bruce and his family, and other notable pilgrims.

Tain was called Baile Dhubhthaich in Scottish Gaelic or Duthac&#x27;s Town and near it stands St. Duthac&#x27;s Cairn, although the biennial Fairs called by his name are no longer held in the town.

St Duthac is venerated by Catholics, Anglicans, and Eastern Orthodox Christians.

==St Duthac&#x27;s Way==
St Duthac&#x27;s Way runs from Tain to Aberdeen, with an expanded section continuing to St. Andrews. From St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral in Aberdeen the route continues to Stonehaven and goes down the coast pass Dunnottar Castle to Montrose, then pass Arbroath Abbey and Inchcape to Dundee, and on to St Andrews.

<doc id="1181778" wikidata="Q431484" url="?curid=1181778" title="Shadowland (k.d. lang album)">
<text>Shadowland is the debut solo album by k.d. lang, released in 1988 (see 1988 in music). The album included her collaboration with Kitty Wells, Loretta Lynn and Brenda Lee on &quot;Honky Tonk Angels&#x27; Medley&quot; and was produced by Owen Bradley, who produced Patsy Cline&#x27;s best-known work.

==Critical reception==

The &quot;Toronto Star&quot; determined that &quot;&quot;Shadowland&quot; is a self-conscious anachronism, haunted by vague, 25-year-old memories... It&#x27;s as purely retrogressive and deferential as the Dave Edmunds-produced &quot;Angel with a Lariat&quot;, which came mighty close to re-defining country music, was radical and innovative.&quot;

<text>CMS-2 is an embedded systems programming language used by the United States Navy. It was an early attempt to develop a standardized high-level computer programming language intended to improve code portability and reusability. CMS-2 was developed primarily for the US Navy’s tactical data systems (NTDS).

CMS-2 was developed by RAND Corporation in the early 1970s and stands for &quot;Compiler Monitor System&quot;. The name &quot;CMS-2&quot; is followed in literature by a letter designating the type of target system. For example, CMS-2M targets Navy 16-bit processors, such as the AN/AYK-14.

==History==
CMS-2 was developed for FCPCPAC (Fleet Computer Programming Center - Pacific) in San Diego, CA. It was implemented by Computer Sciences Corporation in 1968 with design assistance from Intermetrics. The language continued to be developed, eventually supporting a number of computers including the AN/UYK-7 and AN/UYK-43 and UYK-20 and UYK-44 computers.

==Language features==
CMS-2 was designed to encourage program modularization, permitting independent compilation of portions of a total system. The language is statement oriented. The source is free-form and may be arranged for programming convenience. Data types include fixed-point, floating-point, boolean, character and status. Direct reference to, and manipulation of character and bit strings is permitted. Symbolic machine code may be included, known as direct code.

==Program structure==

A CMS-2 program is composed of statements. Statements are made up of symbols separated by delimiters. The categories of symbols include operators, identifiers, and constants. The operators are language primitives assigned by the compiler for specific operations or definitions in a program. Identifiers are unique names assigned by the programmer to data units, program elements and statement labels. Constants are known values that may be numeric, Hollerith strings, status values or Boolean.

CMS-2 statements are free form and terminated by a dollar sign. A statement label may be placed at the beginning of a statement for reference purposes.

A CMS-2 source program is composed of two basic types of statement. Declarative statements provide basic control information to the compiler and define the structure of the data associated with a particular program. Dynamic statements cause the compiler to generate executable machine instructions (object code).

Declarative statements defining the data for a program are grouped into units called data designs. Data designs consist of precise definitions for temporary and permanent data storage areas, input areas, output areas and special data units. The dynamic statements that act on data or perform calculations are grouped into procedures. Data designs and procedures are further grouped to form system elements of a CMS-2 program. The compiler combines system elements into a compile time system. A compile time system may stand alone or be part of a larger program.

==Data declarative statements==
Data declarative statements provide the compiler with information about data element definitions. They define the format, structure and order of data elements in a compile-time system. The three major kinds of data are switches, variables and aggregates.

===Switches===
Switches provide for the transfer of program control to a specific location in a compile-time system. They contain a set of identifiers or switch points to facilitate program transfers and branches. The switch represents a program address of a statement label or procedure name.

===Variables===
A variable is a single piece of data. It may consist of one bit, multiple bits or words. A value may be assigned in the variable definition. Variables may hold a constant or changing value. Data types include integers, fix point, floating point, Hollerith character strings, status or Booleans.

===Aggregates===
Tables hold ordered sets of identically structured information. The common unit of data in a table is an item. Items may be subdivided into fields, the smallest subdivision of a table. Allowable data types contained in fields include integer, fixed point, floating point, Hollerith character string, status or Boolean. An array is an extension of the table concept. The basic structural unit of an array is an item. Array items contain fields as defined by the programmer.

==Dynamic statements==
Dynamic statements specify processing operations and result in executable code generation by the compiler. A dynamic statement consists of an operator followed by a list of operands and additional operators. An operand may be a single name, a constant, a data-element reference or an expression.

===Statement operators===
Major CMS-2 operators are summarized below.
===Special operators===
Special operators facilitate references to data structures and operations on them.
==Program structure declarations==
The dynamic statements that describe the processing operations of a program are grouped into blocks of statements called procedures.

==High level input/output statements==
Input/output statements provide communication with hardware devices while running in a non-realtime environment under a monitor system.
==Compiler Monitor System 2 (CMS-2)==
The Compiler Monitor System 2 (CMS-2) was a system that ran on the UNIVAC CP-642B (AN/USQ-20). The system software included the monitor, compiler, librarian, CP-642 Loader, tape utility and flow charter.

===MS-2 monitor===

A batch processing operating system that controls execution of CMS-2 components and user jobs run on the CP-642 computer. It provides input/output, software library facilities and debugging tools. Job accounting is also provided.

===CMS-2 compiler===

A compiler for the CS-1 and CMS-2 languages that generates object code for the CP-642, L-304, AN/UYK-7, 1830A and 1218/1219 computers. During the 1970s there were different versions of the CMS-2 compiler, depending on which computer was used to compile the code. Some source code had to be rewritten to work around some functions. And the different versions of CMS-2 had problems with the debugging tools.

===XCMS-2 compiler===

An extended CMS-2 compiler, adding language features for the AN/UYK-7 computer. It only generates AN/UYK-7 object code.

===CMS-2 librarian===

A file management system that provides storage and access to source and object code.

===CP-642 Object code loaders===

Two object code loaders for loading absolute or relocatable object code.

===Tape utility===

A set of utilities for managing data on magnetic tape.

===CMS-2 flowcharter===

The flowcharter software processes flowcharter statements in CMS-2 source code and outputs a flowchart to a high-speed printer.

<text>James Sinclair Ross, CM (January 22, 1908 – February 29, 1996) was a Canadian banker and author, who wrote novels and short fiction about life on the Canadian Prairies. He is best known for his first novel, &quot;As For Me and My House&quot;.

==Life and career==
Ross was born on a homestead near Shellbrook, Saskatchewan. When he was seven, his parents separated, and he lived with his mother on a number of different farms during his childhood, going to school in Indian Head, Saskatchewan. He left school after Grade 11 and in 1924 he joined the Union Bank of Canada, which became part of the Royal Bank of Canada a year later. At first, he worked in a number of small towns in Saskatchewan, then moved to Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1933 where he wrote and published his most famous novel &quot;As For Me and My House&quot;. In 1946 he moved to Montreal, Quebec after spending four years in the Canadian Army during World War II. He remained with the Royal Bank until his retirement in 1968, after which he spent some time in Spain and Greece before moving to a nursing home in Vancouver, British Columbia, where he lived until his death.

&quot;As For Me and My House,&quot; set in an isolated town on the Prairies during the Great Depression, was published in 1941. At first not much noticed, it went on to become a Canadian literary classic and set the precedent for the genre of Canadian prairie fiction. He wrote three more novels during his lifetime, as well as a few anthologies of short stories, none of which became as well known as his first novel. He is known to have destroyed manuscripts of novels that his publisher rejected, including a sequel to &quot;Sawbones Memorial&quot;.

His short story &quot;The Painted Door&quot; was adapted by Atlantis Films as the short film &quot;The Painted Door&quot;, which was an Academy Award nominee for Best Live Action Short Film at the 57th Academy Awards in 1985.

A monument in his honour has been erected in Indian Head by Saskatchewan artists and readers, with a bronze statue sculpted by Joe Fafard.

In 1992, he was made a Member of the Order of Canada. He died in 1996, having had Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and was buried in Indian Head. The year after his death his homosexuality became public knowledge for the first time, as a result of Keath Fraser&#x27;s biography &quot;As For Me and My Body: A Memoir of Sinclair Ross&quot; (1997).

<text>The Disney family is an American family that gained prominence when brothers Roy and Walt began creating films through the Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio, today known as mass media and entertainment conglomerate The Walt Disney Company. The Disney family&#x27;s influence on American culture grew with successful feature films such as &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; in 1937 and the opening of the Disneyland Amusement park in 1955. Other Disney family members have been involved in the management and administration of the Disney company, filmmaking, and philanthropy.

==Background==

The family name, originally &quot;d&#x27;Isigny (&quot;from Isigny&quot;)&quot;, is of Norman French derivation, coming from the town of Isigny-sur-Mer. The Disneys, among others who took names from the Normans, settled in England and gave their name to Norton Disney in Lincolnshire. Some of the family moved to Ireland around the 11th century.

==Elias Disney==
Elias Charles Disney (1859–1941) was born in the rural village of Bluevale, Province of Canada (now Ontario, Canada), to Irish Protestant immigrants Kepple Elias Disney (1832–1891) and Mary Richardson (1838–1909). Both parents had emigrated from Ireland to Canada as children, accompanying their parents.

Disney married Flora Call (1868–1938) on January 1, 1888, in Kismet, Lake County, Florida. The couple had five children:
*Herbert Arthur Disney, mail carrier (December 8, 1888 – January 29, 1961, aged 72)
*Raymond Arnold Disney, insurance salesman&lt;ref name=&quot;newspapers/82391314&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;d23/raymond-born&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (December 30, 1890 – May 24, 1989, aged 98)
*Roy Oliver Disney (June 24, 1893 – December 20, 1971, aged 78)
*Walter Elias Disney (December 5, 1901 – December 15, 1966, aged 65)
*Ruth Flora (née Disney) Beecher, stenographer,&lt;ref name=&quot;heritagedata.Oregon/55067&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; WDHM benefactor, and musician&lt;ref name=&quot;d23/ruth-born/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (December 6, 1903 – April 7, 1995, aged 91)&lt;ref name=&quot;d23/disney-ruth-f&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wdw-magazine/ruth-history&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;newspapers/82391425&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mouseplanet/3835&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roy Disney family==

Roy Oliver Disney (June 24, 1893 – December 20, 1971) was an American businessman and co-founder of The Walt Disney Company. Roy was married to Edna Francis from April 1925 until his death. Roy&#x27;s nephew Charles Elias Disney chose to name his son Charles Roy Disney in Roy&#x27;s honor.

Their son, Roy Edward Disney (January 10, 1930 – December 16, 2009), was a longtime senior executive for the Walt Disney Company and the last member of the Disney family to be actively involved in the company. Disney was often compared to his uncle and father. He had two sons (one, Tim Disney, a documentary film producer), and two daughters; his daughter Abigail Disney is a documentary filmmaker.

==Walt Disney family==
Walter Elias Disney (December 5, 1901 – December 15, 1966) was an American entrepreneur, animator, writer, voice actor and film producer who cofounded Disney Brothers Studio with his brother Roy. He received 59 Academy Award nominations, including 22 awards: both totals are records.

He married Lillian Bounds in 1925. They had two daughters, bearing Diane (December 18, 1933 – November 19, 2013) and after, reportedly, suffering several miscarriages,&lt;ref name=&quot;eastbaytimes/2005/06/30/disneys-daughter&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;consideringadoption/walt-disney&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; adopting Sharon (in December 1936, born six weeks previously – February 16, 1993).

Diane married Ronald William Miller, who became president of Walt Disney Productions in 1980 and CEO in 1983, before being ousted by Roy E. Disney.

Sharon,&lt;ref name=&quot;gettyimages/sharon-mae-disney&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; who became an actress,&lt;ref name=&quot;gettyimages/517258374&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; had three children from two marriages, to Robert Brown&lt;ref name=&quot;gettyimages/514968436&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and later, to William Lund,&lt;ref name=&quot;ccsnyder/ps45_087&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and died, of complications of breast cancer,&lt;ref name=&quot;cbsnews/disney-diane-79&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;medium/6652a86b328f&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; February 16, 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes/1993-02-17-me-60&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;d23/sharon-born&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;d23/a-z/disney-sharon&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In 2001, the Walt Disney Hometown Museum, housing a collection of memorabilia from the Disney family, many of which were donated by the family of Ruth Flora Disney Beecher, Walt&#x27;s sister, opened, in the restored Santa Fe Railway Depot in Marceline, Missouri.&lt;ref name=&quot;waltdisneymuseum/museum&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the Walt Disney Family Museum, designed by Disney&#x27;s daughter Diane and her son (Walt&#x27;s grandson) Walter E. D. Miller, opened in the Presidio of San Francisco. The museum was established to promote and inspire creativity and innovation and celebrate and study the life of Walt Disney.

<doc id="1181789" wikidata="Q6908791" url="?curid=1181789" title="Mopery">
<text>Mopery () is a vague, informal name for minor offenses. The word is based on the verb &quot;to &quot;, which originally meant &quot;to wander aimlessly&quot;; it only later acquired the sense &quot;to be bored and depressed&quot;. The word &quot;mope&quot; appears to have first been used in the 16th century, and appears in William Shakespeare&#x27;s works. It has occasionally been put into use by police as a charge to bring when no other legitimate charge seems appropriate. It has also been used for satiric or comedic effect in books and films.

== Definitions ==
In 1970, in Columbus, Ohio, mopery was defined as &quot;loitering while walking, or walking down the street with no clear destination or purpose&quot;, and was used by police to stop and interview counterculture &quot;hippies&quot; who were regarded as unsavory. Some of those arrested were aggressively prosecuted by public prosecutor Karl T. Chrastan. In discussions of law, &quot;mopery&quot; is used as a placeholder name to mean some crime whose nature is not important to the problem at hand. This is sometimes expanded to &quot;mopery with intent to creep&quot; or &quot;mopery with intent to gawk&quot;.

The word &quot;mopery&quot; has been used by authors Thomas Pynchon &quot;(Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow)&quot; and Dashiell Hammett &quot;(The Thin Man)&quot;, among others, for whom it is usually a comic accent. In &quot;Catch-22&quot; (Joseph Heller, 1961), the mildly rebellious Cadet Clevinger is court-martialed by three angry officers, who accuse him of &quot;breaking ranks while in formation, felonious assault, indiscriminate behavior, mopery, high treason, provoking, being a , listening to classical music, and so on&quot;. Similarly, in the 1984 comedy film, &quot;Revenge of the Nerds&quot;, mopery is defined as &quot;exposing oneself to a blind person&quot;. According to Russell Baker, &quot;mopery isn&#x27;t a crime, but only an old policemen&#x27;s joke in which it&#x27;s defined as the act of displaying yourself in the nude to a blind person.&quot;

<doc id="1181803" wikidata="Q731902" url="?curid=1181803" title="Portmahomack">
<text>Portmahomack (; &#x27;Haven of My [i.e. &#x27;Saint&#x27;] Colmóc&#x27;) is a small fishing village in Easter Ross, Scotland. It is situated in the Tarbat Peninsula in the parish of Tarbat. Tarbat Ness Lighthouse is about from the village at the end of the Tarbat Peninsula. Ballone Castle lies about from the village.

There is evidence of early settlement, and the area seems to have been the site of significant activity during the time of the Picts, the Romans (possible Roman foundations of the lighthouse that were later identified in the Middle Ages as a &quot;Roman landmark&quot; near Port a&#x27; Chait that is now called &quot;Port a Chaistell&quot;.), early Christianity and the Vikings. The village is situated on a sandy bay and has a small harbour designed by Thomas Telford: it shares with Hunstanton the unusual distinction of being on the east coast but facing west. Portmahomack lies inside the Moray Firth Special Area of Conservation with the associated dolphin and whale watching activity.

The village has a primary school, golf course, hotel, a number of places to eat and a shop with a sub-post office. The nearest rail access is at Fearn railway station and the nearest commercial airport is at Inverness Airport. The nearest town with full services is Tain lying approximately west. Tain also has rail access. The hamlet of Rockfield is nearby and is accessed via the village of Portmahomack.

==History==
Situated east of Tain on the northern coast of the Tarbat Peninsula, Portmahomack has long been known to be on the site of early settlements. The earliest evidence of habitation is provided by shell middens pointing to settlement as early as one or two thousand years BCE.

There are the remains of an Iron Age broch a little to the west of the village. Finds of elaborate early Christian carved stones dating to the 8th–9th centuries (including one with an inscription), in and around the churchyard, had long suggested that Portmahomack was the site of an important early church in the sixth-seventh century.

===Possible Roman camp===

After the description by a minister in 1822 of a structure, near Port a&#x27; Chaistell, as &quot;a beautiful square fortification of about 100 paces of a side,&quot; the archaeologist O. G. S. Crawford speculated in 1949 that the site might have been a Roman camp, although he did not ever visit the site and no trace of a Roman settlement was found during a later visit.

It had apparently been defaced by 1872 during land reclamation, but in Crawford&#x27;s opinion there may be some traces of the Roman camp still visible or to be discovered.

Furthermore it has been suggested (by Montesanti ) that the supposed camp was visited by emperor Septimius Severus, based on remarks made by the Roman historian Cassius Dio: &quot;Severus did not desist until he approached the extremity of the island (of Britain)&quot;.

=== Monastery ===

Portmahomack is the site of the first confirmed Pictish monastery and the subject between 1994 and 2007 of one of the largest archaeological investigations in Scotland directed by Martin Carver (b. 1941). The fields surrounding the redundant St Colman&#x27;s church were the focus of the 13-year investigation. What the archaeologists uncovered were: an early medieval enclosure ditch, burial ground, remnants of a stone church, and carved stone fragments in the Pictish style.

The monastery began around 550 AD and was destroyed by fire in about 800 AD. It had a burial ground with cist and head-support burials, a stone church, at least four monumental stone crosses and workshops making church plate and early Christian books. The making of vellum in an early medieval site was detected for the first time here by Cecily Spall of FAS Ltd.

Over two hundred pieces of sculpture have been found, some of it broken up in a layer of burning suggesting that the monastic buildings were violently destroyed, possibly in a Viking raid, about the year 800.

The present restored building, adapted to house a museum after lying empty for a number of years, has been shown by archaeological investigation to be itself a monument of great interest, of multi-phase construction, the oldest part (the east wall of the crypt) having been built as early as the 9th century. The museum and visitor centre in the remodeled parish church is managed by the Tarbat Historic Trust.

Recent research on the ancient trench around the local monastery found organic samples in the date range from 140 AD to 590 AD. The area enclosed by the ditch may have been a &quot;settlement, craft-working centre and/or hub of a Pictish community&quot;, connected to the possible Roman fortification in Port a Chaistell.

===Local battles===
The Battle of Tarbat Ness was a land battle fought (c 1030–1040) between Thorfinn the Mighty, Earl (Jarl) of Caithness and the King of Scotland.

In the Battle of Tarbat in the 1480s, a raiding party from the Clan Mackay of Strathnaver were cornered in the Tarbat church by the Clan Ross, who killed many of them before setting fire to the church.

===Fishing and shipping===
During the 17th century, cod, skate ling, halibut, lobsters and turbot were fished in great quantities until the end of the 18th century. Over 100 ships are reported to have exported grain from the harbor. Herring exports peaked between 1850 and 1890, and brought increased employment and prosperity to the region. At the end of the 19th century, the growing number of steam trawlers in the area led to the decline of the herring industry. The construction of the Balintore harbour, south of Portmahomack, also contributed to reduced shipping activity at Portmahomack. The export of grain from the harbor ended during the 1930s.

== Tourist site ==
Today, Portmahomack is a tourist destination with its traditional harbour, swimming beach, golf, dolphin watching, fishing and other watersports. It has a permanent population of between 500 and 600 residents. In the former parish church the Tarbat Discovery Centre, designed by exhibition consultants Higgins Gardner &amp; Partners, houses displays on local history, and many of the finds from several seasons of excavation within the church itself, and in the fields surrounding the churchyard. It also houses the Peter Fraser Archive of memorabilia relating to Peter Fraser, wartime prime minister of New Zealand, who was born and grew up in Hill of Fearn, distant from Portmahomack.

Notable among these are a large collection of fragments of Pictish stone sculpture, many of them superbly carved with figures of ecclesiastics, fantastic and realistic animals, &#x27;Celtic&#x27; interlace and key-pattern, and other motifs. The large elaborate late seventeenth- or early eighteenth-century bell-turret on the west gable of the church is an unusual and distinctive feature.

Some important Pictish carved stones from Portmahomack are on display in the Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh with replicas in the Tarbat Discovery Centre.

Two other important historic buildings in Portmahomack are adjoining &#x27;girnals&#x27; (storehouses), built in the late 17th century and 1779, overlooking the harbour (restored as housing). The former is one of the oldest such buildings to survive in Scotland. The village also features a number of attractive 18th/early 19th century houses lining the shore.

==Notable people==
Portmahomack was a favourite holiday location for Lord Reith (John Reith, 1st Baron Reith (1889-1971)), Director-General of the BBC, who holidayed in the Blue House, still aptly painted blue and located on the seafront, near the harbour.

The murder-mystery writer Anne Perry (1938-2023) lived adjacent to the village for a number of years.

John Shepherd-Barron (1925-2010), the inventor of the ATM (Auto-Teller Machine), lived in the nearby community of Geanies until his death in 2010.

Professor Thomas Summers West (1927-2010), was a famous son of the Village with an Exhibition held in his name at the Tarbat Discovery Centre in 2011.

<doc id="1181806" wikidata="Q45614" url="?curid=1181806" title="Foal">
<text>A foal is an equine up to one year old; this term is used mainly for horses, but can be used for donkeys. More specific terms are colt for a male foal and filly for a female foal, and are used until the horse is three or four. When the foal is nursing from its dam (mother), it may also be called a &quot;suckling&quot;. After it has been weaned from its dam, it may be called a &quot;weanling&quot;. When a mare is pregnant, she is said to be &quot;in foal&quot;. When the mare gives birth, she is &quot;foaling&quot;, and the impending birth is usually stated as &quot;to foal&quot;. A newborn horse is &quot;foaled&quot;.

After a horse is one year old, it is no longer a foal, and is a &quot;yearling&quot;. There are no special age-related terms for young horses older than yearlings. When young horses reach breeding maturity, the terms change: a filly over three (four in horse racing) is called a mare, and a colt over three is called a stallion. A castrated male horse is called a gelding regardless of age; however, colloquially, the term &quot;gelding colt&quot; is sometimes used until a young gelding is three or four. (There is no specific term for a spayed mare other than a &quot;spayed mare&quot;.)

Horses that mature at a small stature are called ponies and occasionally confused with foals. However, body proportions are very different. An adult pony can be ridden and put to work, but a foal, regardless of stature, is too young to be ridden or used as a working animal. Foals, whether they grow up to be horse or pony-sized, can be distinguished from adult horses by their extremely long legs and small, slim bodies. Their heads and eyes also exhibit juvenile characteristics. Although ponies exhibit some neoteny with the wide foreheads and small stature, their body proportions are similar to that of an adult horse. Pony foals are proportionally smaller than adults, but like horse foals, they are slimmer and have proportionally longer legs.

==Early development==
Foals are born after a gestation period of approximately 11 months. Birth takes place quickly, consistent with the status of a horse as a prey animal, and more often at night than during the day. Labor lasting over twenty-four hours may be a sign of medical complications. Unlike most predators which are altricial (born helpless), horses are precocial, meaning they come into the world relatively mature and mobile. Healthy foals can typically keep up with the rest of the herd only a few hours after birth. If a foal has not eaten within twelve hours, it may require assistance.

Healthy foals grow quickly and can put on up to three pounds or over a kilo a day. A sound diet improves growth and leads to a healthier adult animal, although genetics also plays a part. In the first weeks of life the foal gets everything it needs from the mare&#x27;s milk. Like a human infant, it receives nourishment and antibodies from the colostrum in milk that is produced within the first few hours or days following parturition. The mare needs additional water to help her produce milk for the foal and may benefit from supplementary nutrition.

A foal may start to eat solids from ten days of age. After eight to ten weeks it will need more nutrition than the mare&#x27;s milk can supply, requiring supplementary nourishment. It is important when adding solid food to the foal&#x27;s diet to not feed the foal excessively or feed an improperly balanced diet. This can trigger one of several possible growth disorders that can cause lifelong soundness problems. On the other hand, insufficient nutrition to mare or foal can cause stunted growth and other health problems for the foal as it gets older.

==Weaning and maturity==

It is typical for foals under human management to be weaned between four and six months of age, though under natural conditions, they may nurse for longer, occasionally until the following year when the mare foals again. Some foals can nurse for up to three years in domesticity because the mare is less likely to conceive another foetus. A foal that has been weaned but is less than one year old is called a weanling.

Mare&#x27;s milk is not a significant source of nutrients for the foal after about four months, though it does no harm to a healthy mare for a foal to nurse longer and may be of some psychological benefit to the foal. A mare that is both nursing and pregnant will have increased nutritional demands made upon her in the last months of pregnancy, and therefore most domesticated foals are weaned sometime in the autumn in the Northern Hemisphere if the mare is to be bred again the next season.

Weanlings are not capable of reproduction. Puberty occurs in most horses during their yearling year. Therefore, some young horses are capable of reproduction prior to full physical maturity, though it is not common. Two-year-olds sometimes are deliberately bred, though doing so, particularly with fillies, puts undesirable stress on their still-growing bodies. As a general rule, breeding young horses prior to the age of three is considered undesirable.

==Early training==
In spite of rapid growth, a foal is too young to be ridden or driven. However, foals usually receive very basic horse training in the form of being taught to accept being led by humans, called halter-breaking. They may also learn to accept horse grooming, hoof trimming by a farrier, having hair trimmed with electric clippers, and to become familiar with things it will have to do throughout life, such as loading into a horse trailer or wearing a horse blanket. Horses in general have excellent memories, so a foal must not be taught anything as a young horse that would be undesirable for it to do as a full-grown animal.

In either case, foals that have not bonded to their mothers will have difficulty in pasture. The mare will find it more difficult to teach the foal to follow her. Other horses can have difficulty communicating with the foal and may ostracise it due to speaking a different &quot;language&quot;. It can be difficult to lead a foal that has never even been led by its dam.

Horses are not fully mature until the age of four or five, but most are started as working animals much younger, though care must be taken not to over-stress the &quot;soft&quot; bones of younger animals. Yearlings are generally too young to be ridden at all, though many race horses are put under saddle as &quot;long&quot; yearlings, in autumn. Physiologically young horses are still not truly mature as two-year-olds, though some breeders and most race horse trainers do start young horses in a cart or under saddle at that age. The most common age for young horses to begin training under saddle is the age of three. A few breeds and disciplines wait until the animal is four.

<doc id="1181807" wikidata="Q538163" url="?curid=1181807" title="Cosey Fanni Tutti">
<text>Cosey Fanni Tutti (born Christine Carol Newby; 4 November 1951) is an English performance artist, musician and writer, best known for her time in the avant-garde groups Throbbing Gristle and Chris &amp; Cosey.

Tutti first performed under the name Cosmosis. According to Throbbing Gristle biographer Simon Ford, the name of Cosey Fanni Tutti was suggested to her by mail artist Robin Klassnick based on the title of the opera &quot;Così fan tutte&quot;, meaning literally &quot;That&#x27;s What All Women Do.&quot;

==Early career==
Tutti was a performer with COUM Transmissions, of which she was a founding member in 1969. Her addition changed the nature of the group, which had been mostly a musical venture. From that point on, COUM performances became events involving props, costumes, dance, improvisation and street theatre. As an installation artist, she was selected in 1975 to represent Britain at the IXth Biennale de Paris.

== Visual art works and performance art ==
Tutti worked for two years on the Prostitution project as part of COUM Transmissions, in which she created an exhibition about the pornography and sex industry and worked as a model for sex magazines and films. It was shown at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, London in 1976. Censorship restrictions were imposed on the exhibition so that only one image could be viewed at a time. The project also involved events in which women working in the sex industry and the public could discuss issues about the industry and prostitution. Tutti also utilised her own used tampons and used nappies from Mary Kelly&#x27;s work. This &quot;aroused hysterical reactions from the British media and art establishment, unable to address the political implications of the work.&quot;

==Pornography==
Tutti had a long career as a stripper and in the fields of pornographic film and magazines stemming from a desire to incorporate her own image into collages that she produced in this period. This willingness to consciously participate in the process of commercial image production has inspired a number of visual and performance artists. Some of her performance artwork has also drawn on her experience as an adult performer. In 1978, she appeared as a dancer in the music video for American singer Sylvester&#x27;s disco song &quot;You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)&quot; with three other women from her stripping agency in London, alongside several dancers from Pineapple Dance Studios.

==Music career==
Music was used in some of Tutti&#x27;s performance art. The use of music led to Tutti&#x27;s interest in the concept of &quot;acceptable&quot; music and she went on to explore the use of sound as a means of physical pleasure or pain. In 1976, she cofounded the group Throbbing Gristle with Chris Carter, Peter &#x27;Sleazy&#x27; Christopherson and Genesis P-Orridge. The group disbanded in 1981.

Following the breakup of Throbbing Gristle, Genesis P-Orridge and Peter Christopherson went on to form Psychic TV, while Tutti and Chris Carter continued to record together under the moniker Chris &amp; Cosey, with the duo combining their interest and skills in avant-garde music with the sounds and structures of the then-nascent genres of synthpop and electronic dance music. In honour of the dawn of the 21st century, Chris &amp; Cosey changed their stage name to Carter Tutti, and the project pivoted to focus more on experimental ambient sounds. In 2004, after 23 years apart, all four original members of Throbbing Gristle reunited, and they issued a new 12&quot; recording, &quot;TG Now&quot;. The band continued to collaborate sporadically and began to perform live shows together for the first time in over two decades. In April 2009, Throbbing Gristle toured the U.S., appearing at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and playing shows in Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Chicago.

In October 2010, Throbbing Gristle began a European tour; however, following the band&#x27;s first tour date at the London Village Underground venue, London, on 23 October, their website announced that Genesis P-Orridge was no longer willing to perform with the band, and would return to their home in New York. Chris, Cosey and Peter finished the tour without P-Orridge, under the name X-TG. 
Carter and Tutti performed with Nik Colk Void of Factory Floor at Mute&#x27;s Short Circuit Festival on 13 May 2011. A live album of the show, with an additional studio track, was released as &quot;Transverse&quot; in 2012, under the name Carter Tutti Void.

==Later life==
Tutti continues to release solo recordings, including a retrospective deluxe box set with many photos and text called &quot;Time To Tell&quot;, and she continues to work as a performance artist in the Dada tradition. She co-edited (with Richard Birkett) and published (Koenig Books, 2012), Maria Fusco&#x27;s &quot;Cosey Complex&quot;, the first major publication to discuss and theorise about Tutti as methodology. In April 2017, she published her autobiography &quot;Art Sex Music&quot;.

In March 2018, Tutti discussed her life and career with actress Maxine Peake on BBC Radio Four&#x27;s programme &quot;Only Artists&quot;.

<text>Statilia Messalina (c. AD 35 – after 68) was a Roman patrician woman, a Roman Empress and third wife to Roman Emperor Nero.

==Biography==
===Background===
The ancient sources say little of her family; however, Suetonius states that she was a great-great-granddaughter of Titus Statilius Taurus, a Roman general who was awarded a triumph for his victory and was twice consul. She was either the daughter of Titus Statilius Taurus Corvinus, consul in 45 AD, and who was involved in a plot against the Emperor Claudius, or a daughter of the sister of Corvinus, Statilia Messallina. Her grandmother might have been Valeria Messalina Corvina, one of the daughters of Roman senator Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus who served as consul in 31 BC.

===Marriages===
Her fourth husband was the consul Marcus Julius Vestinus Atticus to whom she may have borne a son (who died in 88 AD). Around 65 AD, she became Nero&#x27;s mistress. After the death of the emperor&#x27;s second wife Poppaea Sabina, Vestinus was forced to commit suicide in 66, so Nero could marry Statilia.

She was one of the few of Nero&#x27;s courtiers who survived the fall of his reign. After Nero&#x27;s death, Otho promised that he would marry her, before his suicide in 69 AD.

<doc id="1181818" wikidata="Q7512898" url="?curid=1181818" title="Signed-digit representation">
<text>In mathematical notation for numbers, a signed-digit representation is a positional numeral system with a set of signed digits used to encode the integers.

Signed-digit representation can be used to accomplish fast addition of integers because it can eliminate chains of dependent carries. In the binary numeral system, a special case signed-digit representation is the &quot;non-adjacent form&quot;, which can offer speed benefits with minimal space overhead.

==History==
Challenges in calculation stimulated early authors Colson (1726) and Cauchy (1840) to use signed-digit representation. The further step of replacing negated digits with new ones was suggested by Selling (1887) and Cajori (1928).

In 1928, Florian Cajori noted the recurring theme of signed digits, starting with Colson (1726) and Cauchy (1840). In his book &quot;History of Mathematical Notations&quot;, Cajori titled the section &quot;Negative numerals&quot;. For completeness, Colson uses examples and describes addition (pp. 163–4), multiplication (pp. 165–6) and division (pp. 170–1) using a table of multiples of the divisor. He explains the convenience of approximation by truncation in multiplication. Colson also devised an instrument (Counting Table) that calculated using signed digits.

Eduard Selling advocated inverting the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 to indicate the negative sign. He also suggested &quot;snie&quot;, &quot;jes&quot;, &quot;jerd&quot;, &quot;reff&quot;, and &quot;niff&quot; as names to use vocally. Most of the other early sources used a bar over a digit to indicate a negative sign for it. Another German usage of signed-digits was described in 1902 in Klein&#x27;s encyclopedia.

==Definition and properties==
===Digit set===
Let formula_1 be a finite set of numerical digits with cardinality formula_2 (If formula_3, then the positional number system is trivial and only represents the trivial ring), with each digit denoted as formula_4 for formula_5 formula_6 is known as the radix or number base. formula_1 can be used for a signed-digit representation if it&#x27;s associated with a unique function formula_8 such that formula_9 for all formula_5 
This function, formula_11 is what rigorously and formally establishes how integer values are assigned to the symbols/glyphs in formula_12 One benefit of this formalism is that the definition of &quot;the integers&quot; (however they may be defined) is not conflated with any particular system for writing/representing them; in this way, these two distinct (albeit closely related) concepts are kept separate. 

formula_1 can be partitioned into three distinct sets formula_14, formula_15, and formula_16, representing the positive, zero, and negative digits respectively, such that all digits formula_17 satisfy formula_18, all digits formula_19 satisfy formula_20 and all digits formula_21 satisfy formula_22. The cardinality of formula_14 is formula_24, the cardinality of formula_15 is formula_26, and the cardinality of formula_16 is formula_28, giving the number of positive and negative digits respectively, such that formula_29. 

====Balanced form representations====

Balanced form representations are representations where for every positive digit formula_30, there exist a corresponding negative digit formula_31 such that formula_32. It follows that formula_33. Only odd bases can have balanced form representations, as otherwise formula_34 has to be the opposite of itself and hence 0, but formula_35. In balanced form, the negative digits formula_21 are usually denoted as positive digits with a bar over the digit, as formula_37 for formula_17. For example, the digit set of balanced ternary would be formula_39 with formula_40, formula_41, and formula_42. This convention is adopted in finite fields of odd prime order formula_43:
:formula_44

====Dual signed-digit representation====
Every digit set formula_1 has a dual digit set formula_46 given by the inverse order of the digits with an isomorphism formula_47 defined by formula_48. As a result, for any signed-digit representations formula_49 of a number system ring formula_50 constructed from formula_1 with valuation formula_52, there exists a dual signed-digit representations of formula_50, formula_54, constructed from formula_46 with valuation formula_56, and an isomorphism formula_57 defined by formula_58, where formula_59 is the additive inverse operator of formula_50. The digit set for balanced form representations is self-dual.

===For integers===
Given the digit set formula_1 and function formula_62 as defined above, let us define an integer endofunction formula_63 as the following:
:formula_64
If the only periodic point of formula_65 is the fixed point formula_66, then the set of all signed-digit representations of the integers formula_67 using formula_1 is given by the Kleene plus formula_69, the set of all finite concatenated strings of digits formula_70 with at least one digit, with formula_71. Each signed-digit representation formula_72 has a valuation formula_73
:formula_74. 
Examples include balanced ternary with digits formula_75. 

Otherwise, if there exist a non-zero periodic point of formula_65, then there exist integers that are represented by an infinite number of non-zero digits in formula_1. Examples include the standard decimal numeral system with the digit set formula_78, which requires an infinite number of the digit formula_79 to represent the additive inverse formula_80, as formula_81, and the positional numeral system with the digit set formula_82 with formula_83, which requires an infinite number of the digit formula_84 to represent the number formula_85, as formula_86.

===For decimal fractions===

If the integers can be represented by the Kleene plus formula_69, then the set of all signed-digit representations of the decimal fractions, or formula_6-adic rationals formula_89, is given by formula_90, the Cartesian product of the Kleene plus formula_69, the set of all finite concatenated strings of digits formula_70 with at least one digit, the singleton formula_93 consisting of the radix point (formula_94 or formula_95), and the Kleene star formula_96, the set of all finite concatenated strings of digits formula_97, with formula_98. Each signed-digit representation formula_99 has a valuation formula_100
:formula_101

===For real numbers===

If the integers can be represented by the Kleene plus formula_69, then the set of all signed-digit representations of the real numbers formula_103 is given by formula_104, the Cartesian product of the Kleene plus formula_69, the set of all finite concatenated strings of digits formula_70 with at least one digit, the singleton formula_93 consisting of the radix point (formula_94 or formula_95), and the Cantor space formula_110, the set of all infinite concatenated strings of digits formula_111, with formula_71. Each signed-digit representation formula_113 has a valuation formula_114
:formula_115. 
The infinite series always converges to a finite real number.

===For other number systems===
All base-formula_6 numerals can be represented as a subset of formula_117, the set of all doubly infinite sequences of digits in formula_1, where formula_67 is the set of integers, and the ring of base-formula_6 numerals is represented by the formal power series ring formula_121, the doubly infinite series
:formula_122
where formula_123 for formula_124. 

====Integers modulo powers of ====
The set of all signed-digit representations of the integers modulo formula_125, formula_126 is given by the set formula_127, the set of all finite concatenated strings of digits formula_128 of length formula_129, with formula_71. Each signed-digit representation formula_131 has a valuation formula_132
:formula_133

====Prüfer groups====
A Prüfer group is the quotient group formula_134 of the integers and the formula_6-adic rationals. The set of all signed-digit representations of the Prüfer group is given by the Kleene star formula_96, the set of all finite concatenated strings of digits formula_137, with formula_71. Each signed-digit representation formula_139 has a valuation formula_140
:formula_141

====Circle group====
The circle group is the quotient group formula_142 of the integers and the real numbers. The set of all signed-digit representations of the circle group is given by the Cantor space formula_110, the set of all right-infinite concatenated strings of digits formula_144. Each signed-digit representation formula_131 has a valuation formula_146
:formula_147
The infinite series always converges.

====-adic integers====
The set of all signed-digit representations of the formula_6-adic integers, formula_149 is given by the Cantor space formula_110, the set of all left-infinite concatenated strings of digits formula_151. Each signed-digit representation formula_131 has a valuation formula_153
:formula_154

====-adic solenoids====
The set of all signed-digit representations of the formula_6-adic solenoids, formula_156 is given by the Cantor space formula_117, the set of all doubly infinite concatenated strings of digits formula_158. Each signed-digit representation formula_131 has a valuation formula_160
:formula_161

==In written and spoken language==
===Indo-Aryan languages===
The oral and written forms of numbers in the Indo-Aryan languages use a negative numeral (e.g., &quot;un&quot; in Hindi and Bengali, &quot;un&quot; or &quot;unna&quot; in Punjabi, &quot;ekon&quot; in Marathi) for the numbers between 11 and 90 that end with a nine. The numbers followed by their names are shown for Punjabi below (the prefix &quot;ik&quot; means &quot;one&quot;): 
* 19 unni, 20 vih, 21 ikki
* 29 unatti, 30 tih, 31 ikatti
* 39 untali, 40 chali, 41 iktali
* 49 unanja, 50 panjah, 51 ikvanja
* 59 unahat, 60 sath, 61 ikahat
* 69 unattar, 70 sattar, 71 ikhattar
* 79 unasi, 80 assi, 81 ikiasi
* 89 unanve, 90 nabbe, 91 ikinnaven.

Similarly, the Sesotho language utilizes negative numerals to form 8&#x27;s and 9&#x27;s.
* 8 robeli (/Ro-bay-dee/) meaning &quot;break two&quot; i.e. two fingers down
* 9 robong (/Ro-bong/) meaning &quot;break one&quot; i.e. one finger down

===Classical Latin===
In Classical Latin, integers 18 and 19 did not even have a spoken, nor written form including corresponding parts for &quot;eight&quot; or &quot;nine&quot; in practice - despite them being in existence. Instead, in Classic Latin,

*18 = duodēvīgintī (&quot;two taken from twenty&quot;), (IIXX or XIIX),
*19 = ūndēvīgintī (&quot;one taken from twenty&quot;), (IXX or XIX)
*20 = vīgintī (&quot;twenty&quot;), (XX).

For upcoming integer numerals [28, 29, 38, 39, ..., 88, 89] the additive form in the language had been much more common, however, for the listed numbers, the above form was still preferred. Hence, approaching thirty, numerals were expressed as:

*28 = duodētrīgintā (&quot;two taken from thirty&quot;), less frequently also yet vīgintī octō / octō et vīgintī (&quot;twenty eight / eight and twenty&quot;), (IIXXX or XXIIX versus XXVIII, latter having been fully outcompeted.)
*29 = ūndētrīgintā (&quot;one taken from thirty&quot;) despite the less preferred form was also at their disposal.

This is one of the main foundations of contemporary historians&#x27; reasoning, explaining why the subtractive I- and II- was so common in this range of cardinals compared to other ranges. Numerals 98 and 99 could also be expressed in both forms, yet &quot;two to hundred&quot; might have sounded a bit odd - clear evidence is the scarce occurrence of these numbers written down in a subtractive fashion in authentic sources.

===Finnish Language===
There is yet another language having this feature (by now, only in traces), however, still in active use today. This is the Finnish Language, where the (spelled out) numerals are used this way should a digit of 8 or 9 occur. The scheme is like this:

*1 = &quot;yksi&quot; (Note: yhd- or yht- mostly when about to be declined; e.g. &quot;yhdessä&quot; = &quot;together, as one [entity]&quot;)
*2 = &quot;kaksi&quot; (Also note: kahde-, kahte- when declined)
*3 = &quot;kolme&quot;
*4 = &quot;neljä&quot;
*7 = &quot;seitsemän&quot;
*8 = &quot;kah(d)eksan&quot; (two left [for it to reach it])
*9 = &quot;yh(d)eksän&quot; (one left [for it to reach it])
*10 = &quot;kymmenen&quot; (ten)

Above list is no special case, it consequently appears in larger cardinals as well, e.g.:
*399 = &quot;kolmesataayhdeksänkymmentäyhdeksän&quot;

Emphasizing of these attributes stay present even in the shortest colloquial forms of numerals:

*1 = &quot;yy&quot;
*2 = &quot;kaa&quot;
*3 = &quot;koo&quot;
*7 = &quot;seiska&quot;
*8 = &quot;kasi&quot;
*9 = &quot;ysi&quot;
*10 = &quot;kymppi&quot;

However, this phenomenon has no influence on written numerals, the Finnish use the standard Western-Arabic decimal notation.

===Time keeping===
In the English language it is common to refer to times as, for example, &#x27;seven to three&#x27;, &#x27;to&#x27; performing the negation.

==Other systems==
There exist other signed-digit bases such that the base formula_162. A notable examples of this is Booth encoding, which has a digit set formula_163 with formula_164 and formula_165, but which uses a base formula_166. The standard binary numeral system would only use digits of value formula_167.

Note that non-standard signed-digit representations are not unique. For instance:

: formula_168
: formula_169
: formula_170
: formula_171

The non-adjacent form (NAF) of Booth encoding does guarantee a unique representation for every integer value. However, this only applies for integer values. For example, consider the following repeating binary numbers in NAF,
: formula_172

<doc id="1181828" wikidata="Q1319963" url="?curid=1181828" title="The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things">
<text>The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things is a 2004 drama film co-written and directed by Asia Argento and starring Argento, Jimmy Bennett, Dylan Sprouse and Cole Sprouse (with Bennett and the Sprouse brothers sharing the role as Jeremiah). The screenplay by Argento and Alessandro Magania is based on JT LeRoy&#x27;s novel of the same name. The film received a limited release in North America on March 10, 2006, shortly after Laura Albert was revealed to be the actual author of the JT LeRoy books.

The film concerns a tattered relationship between Sarah, a drug addict, and her young son, Jeremiah. Their life together is marked by Sarah&#x27;s substance abuse. The title is taken from Jeremiah 17:9.

==Plot==
Sarah (Asia Argento) is the young mother of Jeremiah who has him move back in with her after spending his early years with a stable foster family. Their life soon becomes hectic with Sarah not only giving her young son drugs, but also giving him a chaotic life on the road.

Sarah becomes involved with a series of men who treat her and seven-year-old Jeremiah (Jimmy Bennett) poorly, and she uses them as an excuse to abandon her son. She disappears to Atlantic City with her boyfriend, Emerson (Jeremy Renner), and then deserts him; Emerson returns to their home and rapes Jeremiah. After a trip to the hospital, Jeremiah&#x27;s grandmother (Ornella Muti) takes him to a West Virginian radical Christian cult led by his grandfather (Peter Fonda). After he has been three years with the cult, Sarah returns to reclaim the 11-year-old Jeremiah (Dylan and Cole Sprouse).

Sarah&#x27;s current lover, Kenny (Matt Schulze), a truck driver, eventually abandons them at a truck stop while Sarah is soliciting. Sarah realizes that if she is going to keep her men, she cannot say Jeremiah is her son. She persuades Jeremiah to cross-dress so that he can act as her &quot;little sister&quot;; and Jeremiah&#x27;s cross-dressing evolves to include his mother&#x27;s seduction techniques. After dressing up as a &quot;baby doll&quot; version of Sarah which consisted of her makeup, her white nightgown and her red high heel pumps, Jeremiah seduces Jackson (Marilyn Manson), his mother&#x27;s latest man, who initially tries to rebuff the boy&#x27;s advances, but then gives in. Sarah is furious with Jackson for giving in to the boy&#x27;s advances and also with Jeremiah for ruining her panties with drops of blood on them. She then takes Jeremiah and leaves.

Later, they are in a house where the basement houses a methamphetamine laboratory, which later blows up with Sarah&#x27;s latest boyfriend inside. After fleeing, and while detoxing from methamphetamine, Sarah is convinced that everyone is after them and that only certain foods are edible (mainly chips and sugary soda). She convinces Jeremiah that if they eat anything but these foods, they will be poisoned which leads them to a failed attempt to shoplift at a grocery store; afterwards, Jeremiah finds and eats a hamburger from a dumpster. His mother, in a state of &quot;meth psychosis&quot;, is convinced the food he ate was poison, and makes him drink ipecac in order to make him better and rid him of any &quot;poisons&quot;.

Jeremiah wakes up in the hospital with his grandmother beside him. She tells him that Sarah is in the psychiatric ward. Later that night, Sarah collects Jeremiah from his hospital room, and rather than have him go back to the cult, she clutches his hand, and they walk off into the world in their hospital gowns. The final scene is of Sarah and Jeremiah driving away.

<text>Citizen Ruth is a 1996 American satirical black comedy film directed by Alexander Payne, in his feature film directorial debut, and starring Laura Dern, Swoosie Kurtz, Kelly Preston, Burt Reynolds, Kurtwood Smith, Mary Kay Place, Kenneth Mars, and Tippi Hedren. The film follows a poor, drug-addled, irresponsible pregnant woman who unexpectedly attracts national attention from those involved in the abortion debate. The story was inspired by the case of Martina Greywind, a homeless, unmarried mother from North Dakota who was offered $15,000 to carry what would have been her fifth child to term. This film marked Kenneth Mars’ final theatrical film role.

The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 1996. It later opened in limited release in the United States on December 13, 1996.

==Plot==
Ruth Stoops is an inebriated addict in Nebraska who is capable of doing nearly anything to get money or drugs. She has four children, all of whom have been taken from her custody by the state because of her inability to care for them. One morning, Ruth and her boyfriend have intercourse on a bed in a flophouse, after which he disrespectfully throws her out of the apartment. Afterward, she visits the home of her brother and sister-in-law to sneak a look at two of her children and beg her brother for money. Despite being family, she waits at the back door similar to a dog. She later goes to a hardware store to buy wood sealant and huffs it in a paper bag in an alley to get high.

After Ruth is arrested for her continuing drug use, she discovers that she is pregnant again. At her arraignment, she learns to her horror that she is facing felony charges for endangering a fetus; her many earlier arrests had all been on misdemeanors. The judge, who knows of the situation with Ruth&#x27;s other children, informs her after the hearing that he will lessen her sentence if she has an abortion. Ruth is bailed out of jail by Norm and Gail Stoney, a middle-aged radical Evangelical couple who have become aware of Ruth&#x27;s story through the local news. The couple takes her into their home and attempts to persuade her to keep her child. On the first night, Ruth, impervious to their convictions, sneaks out of the house with the couple&#x27;s reckless teenage daughter, Cheryl, and again huffs paint and smokes marijuana.

At the Stoneys&#x27; urging, Ruth visits a crisis pregnancy center where she is further persuaded to go forward with her pregnancy, despite her resistance given her limited opportunities and drug problem. After she is found huffing glue at an anti-abortion protest with Gail and Norm, they kick her out of the house. Diane, a friend of Gail&#x27;s who participates in abortion protests, offers to take Ruth in. Upon arriving at Diane&#x27;s farmhouse, Diane discloses that she is in fact a lesbian abortion-rights activist and spy who attempts to help women she feels the Stoneys and others prey upon. The witless Ruth soon finds comfort in Diane and her partner, Rachel, as well as Harlan, a gruff disabled veteran and friend of the women who provides security detail for them.

After the Stoneys discover Diane was working against them, they stake out Diane&#x27;s home with numerous other anti-abortion activists and engage in religious song and mass prayer. They offer Ruth $15,000 to keep her child, which Harlan ultimately agrees to match if Ruth goes through with her abortion. The scene becomes a spectacle documented by news stations and is exacerbated when Blaine Gibbons, a charismatic and famous evangelist, arrives to participate. Blaine offers Ruth an additional $15,000 from his ministry to cancel the abortion. After Ruth finds alcohol in the house and gets drunk, Diane chews her out and tells her to sleep it off.

On the morning Ruth is to have her abortion, she suffers a miscarriage and becomes disillusioned with Diane, whom she realizes is using her as a pawn to promote her message, similar to the Stoneys. Ruth conceals the miscarriage from Diane and Rachel, and agrees to travel to the abortion clinic with them; the three are escorted via helicopter with renowned abortion-rights activist Jessica Weiss, who saw Ruth&#x27;s story in the media and felt compelled to help her. Upon arriving at the clinic, Ruth manages to locate the $15,000 Harlan had promised her, which he has stashed behind the front desk, and escapes out of a back window. Though the clinic is surrounded by anti-abortion and abortion-rights picketers alike, they fail to notice Ruth as she walks through the crowd before running down the street with her backpack of money.

==Cast==

==Themes==
&quot;Citizen Ruth&quot; is known for its explicit attack on the abortion debate. Through black comedy and satire, the film spins the motif of women seeking abortions in &quot;ways unprecedented in prior decades&quot; of film. Most importantly, the film uses these methods of humor &quot;to critique moral realism in the abortion debates.&quot; While the film&#x27;s overt subject matter is abortion, director Alexander Payne has insisted that the film is more prominently about the human side of fanaticism. Elaborating on this, Payne said, &quot;People become fanatics for highly personal reasons. I mean, it&#x27;s more about them and their own psychosis than about that cause.&quot; This point has been noted by critics, who reaffirm the common loss in sight made by extremists of the people and issues involved in such debates.

A running joke in the movie is a &quot;Success in Finance&quot;-type tape produced by an Amway-type company. Ruth takes the tape and studies it to determine what to do with her newfound money. It is never shown what she does with the money as the film abruptly ends.

== Release==
The film premiered at the 1996 Sundance Film Festival. Its initial title was &quot;The Devil Inside&quot;, but Miramax insisted on changing it because they felt it sounded too much like a horror film title. It was then changed to &quot;Meet Ruth Stoops&quot;, then finally &quot;Citizen Ruth&quot;.

Though the film had a positive reception at Sundance, it was not theatrically released until the end of the year on December 13, 1996, reportedly because of controversy surrounding the film &quot;Priest&quot; and condemnation from Catholic organizations in the United States. Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor expressed that Miramax did not make good on a promise to support the film and to campaign Dern for an Academy Award nomination, instead focusing their promotional efforts on &quot;Sling Blade&quot; for that Oscars season.

==Reception==
&quot;Citizen Ruth&quot; received positive reviews upon release. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 81% based on 26 reviews, with an average score of 6.8/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Smart and sharply funny, &quot;Citizen Ruth&quot; is an entertaining look at a tough subject – and an impressive calling card for debuting director/co-writer Alexander Payne.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 64 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Praise was given to Dern&#x27;s performance, with Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times,&quot; writing &quot;Criminally negligent as Ruth is, she becomes outrageously funny and weirdly lovable thanks to Laura Dern&#x27;s sidesplitting performance in this role. Proving herself a terrific physical comedian, the long and rangy Ms. Dern kicks and shrieks her way through the crisis that erupts over Ruth&#x27;s plight.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three stars out of four praising the film for its &quot;reckless courage to take on both sides in the abortion debate&quot; and for its &quot;gallery of sharp-edged satiric portraits.&quot; He added, &quot;There is a point at which this all perhaps grows a little thin; we yearn for someone to cheer for, instead of against. But there is courage in the decision to make Ruth an unredeemed dopehead whose only instinct is to go for the cash. I doubt that the two sides in the debate would actually engage in a bidding war, but that&#x27;s what satire is for: To take reality and extend it to absurdity.&quot;

Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; also gave the film a positive review calling the performances &quot;pinpoint perfect&quot;, though also suggesting that the &quot;movie is a little too aware of its own outrageousness.&quot; Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; focused on the fact of &quot;Citizen Ruth&quot; being Payne&#x27;s directorial debut, stating, &quot;Director Payne may not yet possess all the skills necessary to completely pull off a full-scale social farce; he could profitably have added more comic invention around the edges, but he does score quite a few points, even-handedly ribbing the extremists in both camps.&quot;

<doc id="1181831" wikidata="Q2736505" url="?curid=1181831" title="The Twisted Tales of Felix the Cat">
<text>The Twisted Tales of Felix the Cat is an American animated television series produced by Film Roman. The series first aired on September 16, 1995 on CBS Saturday mornings lasting for two seasons with the final episode airing on April 12, 1997. The first season consists of 13 episodes and the second and final season consists of 8 episodes.

This is the second television series featuring Felix the Cat; the first was the 1958–1960 series &quot;Felix the Cat&quot;.

The show has Spanish-dubbed episodes of the series aired on Saturday mornings on Univision in the United States from September 16, 2000 to September 8, 2001 as part of the &quot;¡De Cabeza!&quot; block as &quot;Los Nuevos Cuentos de Felix el Gato&quot;. It also has Spanish-dubbed episodes of the series aired on Saturday and Sunday mornings on Telefutura in 2003 as part of &quot;Toonturama&quot; as &quot;Las Nuevas Aventuras de Felix el Gato&quot; along with &quot;Bruno the Kid&quot; and &quot;Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm&quot;.

==History==
The show was a modern take of the original 1958–1962 series produced by Otto Messmer&#x27;s former assistant, Joe Oriolo. His son, Don Oriolo, was involved in the creation of this series as well.

In many ways, the show reverts to the silent era of shorts with surreal settings and offbeat character depictions. Felix is also more like his original mischievous adult form, rather than the young and innocent depiction from the 1936 Van Beuren shorts, the 1959 TV series and &quot;Felix the Cat: The Movie&quot;. It does, however, contain some elements from the 1950s series such as Felix&#x27;s Magic Bag of Tricks and the characters Poindexter, the Master Cylinder, the Professor and Rock Bottom (though the latter two are actually parodies of the original characters, with their names being the Mad Doctor and Lead Fanny, respectively). The series had a Fleischer Studios-inspired art style.

The series starred Thom Adcox-Hernandez as the voice of Felix the Cat, but since Adcox-Hernandez&#x27;s voice was apparently a temporary role while the producers kept looking for a more suitable actor by the first season&#x27;s run, he was replaced by Charlie Adler in Season 2. It was produced by Phil Roman and Timothy Berglund and is reputed to have been one of the most expensive cartoons ever made by Film Roman. Martin Olson and Jeremy Kramer, two comedy writers known for pushing the envelope into the bizarre, wrote both outlines and scripts for the series. The main theme was composed by Don Oriolo, while the musical score and closing theme were composed and performed by the Club Foot Orchestra.

==Characters==
* Felix the Cat: The main character and star of the show. He has many adventures with his magic bag of tricks that often helps in dangerous situations. Unlike his original counterpart, he is shown to be a pre-teen cat who has a cute personality (voiced by Thom Adcox-Hernandez in season 1 and Charlie Adler in season 2).

===Allies===
* Rosco (voiced by Phil Hayes) – Felix&#x27;s dim-witted best friend.
* Candy Kitty (voiced by Jennifer Hale) – Rosco&#x27;s older sister and Felix&#x27;s love interest.
* Sheba Beboporeba (voiced by Cree Summer) – Felix&#x27;s friend.
* Shamus T. Goldcrow (voiced by Tony Pope) – an anthropomorphic crow.
* Skiddoo the Mouse (voiced by Susan Silo) – one of Felix&#x27;s friends.
* Bermuda Triangle: He is an anthropomorphic version of the location of the same name. He wreaks havoc because of his stupidity. He caused all sorts of chaos in New York City until he fell in love with Times Square. The two ended up getting married.
* Nastasshia Slinky (voiced by Jane Singer) – an actress who Felix is obsessed with. She however, never returns the feelings. In fact, she hates Felix and wants nothing to do with him, not showing him even the slightest grip of affection. 
* (voiced by Cam Clarke): He is the nerdy young nephew of the Professor and is Felix&#x27;s other best friend. He is depicted as a stereotypical scientist; he is very intelligent and always wears thick Coke-bottle glasses, a lab coat, and a mortarboard. A button on the chest of his lab coat acts as a control for whatever device the plot calls for. Despite the Professor being his uncle, he is also one of Felix&#x27;s best friends. Whenever he talks to Felix, he refers to him as &quot;Mr. Felix&quot;.
* Guardian Angel (voiced by Jeff Bennett)

===Villains===
* Peking Duck (voiced by Tony Jay) – an antagonist.
** Moo Shoo and One-Ton (voiced by Kevin Schon and Jim Cummings) – Peking Duck&#x27;s henchman.
* The Sludge King
* Fufu Gauche (voiced by Brad Garrett) – a disgraced fashion designer who tries to get revenge on the city by replacing everyone&#x27;s clothes with his tacky fish costumes.
* Oscar (voiced by Jeffrey Tambor) – a minor villain whose sole appearance was in the episode &quot;Phoney Phelix&quot;, serving as one of the most pathetic foes Felix has ever faced. A wannabe cartoon star who met failure at every step of the way, Oscar sought to climb his way to stardom by hijacking Felix&#x27;s own cartoon, despite being a painfully obvious impersonator.
* Fuzzy Bunny (voiced by Rob Paulsen) – a cutesy toy rabbit who manages to replace Felix&#x27;s own show and become a nationwide sensation, thanks to how cute he is. In truth however, he is actually a gruesome thug in a rabbit suit.
** Froggy and Fuzzyman (voiced by Jeff Bennett) – Fuzzy Bunny&#x27;s henchman.
* Bet a Billion Bill (voiced by Daran Norris) – a smooth-talking and arrogant hotshot playboy gambler.
* Captain Herman (voiced by Tom Kenny)
* Mad Doctor (voiced by Pat Fraley): He is a parody of the Professor from the 1958–60 &quot;Felix the Cat&quot; series. 
* Leadfanny (voiced by Billy West): He is a parody of Rock Bottom from the 1958–60 &quot;Felix the Cat&quot; series. He is a stereotypically gay dog whose voice is an imitation of actor Harvey Fierstein. Leadfanny is Mad Doctor&#x27;s assistant.
* Black Cats Leader (voiced by Greg Burson)
** Black Cats Gatekeeper (voiced by Dan Castellaneta) – Black Cats Leader&#x27;s henchman.

Born in Montreal, Quebec, Alarie was the daughter of a choirmaster, assistant conductor of the &quot;Société Canadienne d&#x27;opérettes&quot;, and of a soprano and actress. She studied voice and acting early and performed on radio from the age of 9, first as an actress and later as a singer of popular music. While studying voice with Victor Issaurel, she made her debut in 1938 at &quot;Les Variétés lyriques&quot; in the operetta &quot;The White Horse Inn&quot;. She also sang Marie in Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;La fille du régiment&quot; and the lead role in &quot;Mireille&quot;.

== Career ==

===Stage===
He originally trained to be an accountant in New Zealand, but decided to change his career path in 1950 when he made his stage debut as Sebastian in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;. He moved to London in 1950 and studied acting there at the Old Vic Theatre.

He went on to have such varied stage roles as Bob (narrator) in &quot;Irma la Douce&quot;, Ratty in &quot;Toad of Toad Hall&quot; and Jean-Paul Marat in &quot;Marat/Sade&quot;.

He made his Broadway debut in 1952, playing Sam Weller in &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot;, and subsequently appeared in &quot;Irma La Douce&quot;, &quot;The Incomparable Max&quot; and &quot;Oliver!&quot;, for which his Fagin was nominated for a Tony Award. He is also known for his roles in the operettas of Gilbert and Sullivan, on both stage and television. He starred in the first national tour of the musical &quot;Drood&quot;, replacing George Rose, who was murdered during the run.

He also participated in the workshop production of &quot;Tom Jones: The Musical&quot;, playing the role of Squire Western and reprising it on the cast recording.

===Film===
His red hair and distinctive Mr. Punch-like features often saw him cast as comic eccentrics in a number of British films of the 1960s and 1970s such as &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; (1966), &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot; (1966), &quot;The Double Man&quot; (1967), &quot;Fathom&quot; (1967), &quot;The Assassination Bureau&quot; (1969), &quot;A Severed Head&quot; (1970), &quot;The Black Windmill&quot; (1974) and &quot;One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing&quot; (1975).

He was often cast as humorous foreign characters (he has played everything from Chinese to Russian). Two of his highest profile roles of this kind were in two films for Billy Wilder: &quot;The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1970) and &quot;Avanti!&quot; (1972), for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for his part as put-upon hotel manager Carlo Carlucci.

===Television===
In the 1978 television miniseries &quot;Centennial&quot;, he played the Scottish accountant Finlay Perkin. He played both Ko-Ko (the starring role) in &quot;The Mikado&quot;, and the title character, John Wellington Wells, in &quot;The Sorcerer&quot; for the Brent Walker television series of Gilbert and Sullivan productions, shown by the BBC in 1983.

After relocating to the United States, he guest-starred in many television series, such as &quot;Columbo&quot; (1978, &quot;The Conspirators&quot;); &quot;Hart to Hart&quot;; &quot;Dynasty&quot;; &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;; &quot;The Love Boat&quot; (S9 E22 as Slade 1986); &quot;Remington Steele&quot;; &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;; &quot;Babylon 5&quot;; &quot;The Feather and Father Gang&quot;; &quot;Newhart&quot;; &quot;MacGyver&quot;; &quot;Dear John&quot;; &quot;The Fall Guy&quot;; &quot;Maude&quot;; and &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;.

<doc id="1181840" wikidata="Q164578" url="?curid=1181840" title="Adnan Oktar">
<text>Adnan Oktar (; born 2 February 1956), also known as Adnan Hoca or Harun Yahya, is a Turkish cult leader and Muslim televangelist.

Between the 2000s and late 2010s, he was engaged in &quot;a massive campaign&quot; of proselytizing Westerners to Islam, producing dozens of vividly illustrated books. On 17 November 2022, he was sentenced to 8,658 years in prison for leading a criminal gang, engaging in political and military espionage, sexual abuse of minors, and other charges. Prior to his arrest, Oktar established and ran two organizations: &quot;Bilim Araştırma Vakfı&quot; (BAV), which promoted creationism, and &quot;Millî Değerleri Koruma Vakfı&quot; which worked domestically on a variety of moral issues. 

In the West, before his arrest and trial, Oktar sent thousands of unsolicited copies of his creationist book, &quot;The Atlas of Creation&quot;, to French schools and universities in January 2007, and several months later to American scientists, members of Congress, science museums and schools.

Oktar has advocated a version of Islam that rejects both Sunni and Shia traditions, focusing instead on a Quran-centric interpretation. He has preached &quot;the true Islam&quot; based on the Quran on his television channel, A9 TV. His organization is commonly referred to as a cult. Oktar filed more than 5,000 lawsuits against individuals for defamation from 2005 to 2015, which led to the blocking of a number of prominent websites in Turkey.

==Life and career==
===Early life and education===
Adnan Oktar was born in Ankara, Turkey, in 1956, and grew up there through his high school years. While in high school he studied the works of Islamic scholars like Said Nursî, a Kurdish scholar who wrote &quot;Risale-i Nur&quot;, an extensive &quot;tafsir&quot; (Qur&#x27;anic commentary) that includes a comprehensive political and religious ideology. According to Oktar biographer Anne Ross Solberg, he grew up in a &quot;relatively affluent secular family&quot;.

In 1979, Oktar moved to Istanbul and entered Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University to study architecture. It was here, according to Solberg, that he became fully engaged in religious activism. Following the Turkish coup e&#x27;tat in September 1980, Oktar began regularly attending the Molla Çelebi Mosque in nearby Fındıklı. Edip Yüksel, who knew Oktar during those years, described him as a &quot;Sunni zealot.&quot;

===Sect beginnings===
By the early 1980s, Oktar had begun disseminating his views on Islam to young university students from socially-connected, wealthy Istanbul families. Between twenty and thirty of these followers formed a group around Oktar between 1982 and 1984, soon thereafter joined by newly-converted private high school students who also came from affluent backgrounds. Yüksel said Oktar presented &quot;a refined and urbanized version&quot; of Nursi&#x27;s teachings &quot;to the children of the privileged class&quot;, avoiding a high pressure or traditional, old fashioned approach. Like Nursi, Oktar argued against Marxism, communism and materialistic philosophy, but attached special importance to refuting evolution and Darwinism, as he believed they were being used to promote materialism and atheism. Oktar personally put money into a pamphlet entitled the &quot;Theory of Evolution&quot;, which promoted pseudoscientific arguments against evolution.

In 1986 Oktar enrolled in the philosophy department of Istanbul University and began holding lectures, in which many students, mostly from neighboring Boğaziçi University, sought to participate. Oktar&#x27;s name also began to appear regularly in the press, including a cover story in &quot;Nokta&quot; magazine. Later that year he published a 550-page book titled &quot;Judaism and Freemasonry&quot;, based on the antisemitic canard that state offices, universities, political groups and media were influenced by a &quot;hidden group&quot; seeking to undermine &quot;the spiritual, religious, and moral values of the Turkish people and make them like animals.&quot;

Oktar was arrested on the grounds of promoting a theocratic revolution and was detained for nineteen months, though he was never formally charged. He spent ten months in a mental hospital, where he was diagnosed with schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, but he maintains that he was a political prisoner who was punished because of the publication of &quot;Judaism and Freemasonry&quot; and not mentally ill.

Oktar continued building up his community for the remainder of the 1980s and into the 1990s. His followers were especially active recruiting at summer resorts along the Sea of Marmara. Two themes one ex-follower remembered from this period were a strong hatred of Jews and Freemasons and, in a move away from orthodox Islam, abandoning belief in &quot;hadith&quot;:
Oktar claims that, due to the political upheaval in Turkey during this period, he was unable to continue his studies and so devoted his energy to writing books upon leaving school.

In 1990, Oktar founded the Science Research Foundation (&quot;Bilim Araştırma Vakfı&quot;, or BAV). (Oktar ran and also served as honorary president of both BAV and the later &quot;Millî Değerleri Koruma Vakfı&quot;) As reported by Solberg, members of the BAV discarded their &quot;overtly Islamic garments&quot; in favor of &quot;designer clothing&quot; and &quot;proclaimed themselves supporters of the ideals&quot; of the founder of modern Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, despite the fact that Atatürk was secularist. The BAV held conferences and seminars in which Oktar blamed political and social problems on Darwinism and materialism. Based his own experiences and conversations with ex-members of the BAV, Yüksel characterizes the group as &quot;a complete cult&quot; with &quot;all the criteria of a cult as you would define it today ... isolation, entire control of the lives of the cult members&quot;.

===Later career===
In 1994, the Islamist Welfare Party (&quot;Refah Partisi&quot;) won control of the municipalities of Istanbul and Ankara. The new mayors one of whom was future president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan made business agreements with Oktar in exchange for political support. The following year, Oktar founded the Foundation for Protection of National Values (&quot;Millî Değerleri Koruma Vakfı&quot;, or MDKV), through which he networked with other Turkish nationalist organizations and individuals on shared issues. Following the 1997 Turkish military memorandum, the Welfare Party disbanded and the new government, headed by Erdoğan, distanced itself from Oktar going forward.

In 1998 Oktar distributed a new book, &quot;The Evolution Deceit&quot;. The following year he was arrested and charged with extortion and forming a criminal enterprise. He was convicted and sentenced to three years in prison, but the verdict was appealed and in May 2010 it was overturned. During his imprisonment Oktar engaged in numerous libel suits. In some cases he was successful in blocking high-profile websites in Turkey for slander, including that of Richard Dawkins and the entirety of WordPress.com.

Between that time and the present, BAV has organized hundreds of conferences on creationism in Turkey and worldwide. He built a large publishing enterprise with publications sold though Islamic bookstores worldwide. He is one of the most widely distributed authors in the Muslim world.

In 2007 he sent out thousands of unsolicited copies of his &quot;Atlas of Creation&quot; advocating Islam and creationism to schools and colleges in several European countries and the US.

His television show is viewed by many in the Arab world. According to Middle East Eye, his TV programs were known for featuring him discussing Islamic principles, while (somewhat incongruously), &quot;scantily clad women with bleached blonde hair danced around him to popular music. These women Oktar referred to as his &#x27;kittens&#x27;&quot;.

In 2010, Oktar was selected as one of the top fifty of &quot;The 500 Most Influential Muslims&quot; in the World by the Royal Islamic Strategic Studies Centre of Jordan for his dissemination of creationism in an Islamic context, and other extensively distributed publications on Islamic topics.

===July 2018 arrest and criminal charges===

On 11 July 2018, the financial crimes section of the Turkish police detained Oktar and over 160 of his associates on charges including forming a criminal enterprise, financial fraud and sexual abuse. Other charges Oktar faces range from sexual intercourse with minors and kidnapping children to holding people captive, political and military espionage, money laundering and torture. According to the Istanbul chief prosecutor&#x27;s office, Oktar was apprehended while attempting to run away from the arresting police officers.

On 19 July 2018, Adnan Oktar was remanded into custody pending trial along with 168 of his associates. In addition, after Oktar&#x27;s initial arrest, over 45 people from over six countries, including two children, have pressed charges against him. When asked why he was arrested before being questioned by the police, Oktar stated: &quot;It&#x27;s a British plot.&quot;
On 19 July 2019, an Istanbul high court approved the indictment of Oktar for the charges. The first hearing was scheduled for 17 September in Silivri Prison.

On 11 January 2021, Oktar was sentenced to 1,075 years in prison after being tried for charges including forming a criminal enterprise, financial fraud, and sexual abuse. Along with thirteen others detained in the case, sentences totalled 9,803 years. An international trial observation report written by Lionel Blackman heavily criticised the conduct of the trial,
and on 15 March 2022, his verdict was overturned by the Turkish Court of Appeal &quot;due to incomplete prosecution and erroneous assessment,&quot; with the court asking for &quot;the retrial of all defendants&quot;. As of 17 March, taking into account time spent in jail, the appeal court has &quot;decided to release 68 defendants&quot;, but not &quot;16 high-profile defendants, including Oktar&quot;. Oktar was subsequently sentenced to 8,658 years in prison on 17 November 2022 as a result of his retrial.

==Writings, productions, and beliefs==
Oktar has written numerous books under the pen name Harun Yahya. &quot;Harun&quot; refers to the biblical Aaron and &quot;Yahya&quot; refers to the New Testament John the Baptist.

His publications argue against evolution. They assert that evolution denies the existence of God, abolishes moral values, and promotes materialism and communism.

Truman State University physicist Taner Edis, who was born in Turkey, says the secret to BAV&#x27;s success is the huge popularity of the Harun Yahya books. &quot;They&#x27;re fairly lavishly produced, on good-quality paper with full-color illustrations all over the place,&quot; he says. &quot;They&#x27;re trying to compete with any sort of science publication you can find in the Western world. And in a place like Turkey, Yahya books look considerably better-published than most scientific publications.&quot; Many of his books have been made into high-resolution videos which are freely downloadable on the Internet.

===Creationism===
Oktar has been called &quot;fiercely opposed to the theory of evolution&quot; and Darwinism, which he believes undermines religious belief, thus leading to &quot;the discord, atheism, terrorism and extreme political ideologies&quot; of contemporary life.

The spread of organized Christian creationism to Islam began in the 1980s, when the Muslim minister of education in Turkey turned to the Institute for Creation Research (ICR), a Christian institution then located near San Diego, California, for help in developing twofold curriculum that would teach evolution and creationism side by side. In 1990, the &quot;Science Research Foundation&quot; (BAV in Turkish) was formed in Istanbul, headed by Oktar.

For many years Oktar drew on the writings of young earth Christian creationists to develop his case against evolution. Oktar later produced material which was more similar to Intelligent Design. In fact, Harun Yahya&#x27;s website was listed as an &quot;Islamic intelligent design&quot; website by the Discovery Institute. However Oktar does not embrace use of the term &#x27;Intelligent Design&#x27; due to its lack of specific mention of God, calling it &#x27;another of Satan&#x27;s snares&#x27;.

In early 1998, the BAV launched its first campaign against evolution. Thousands of free copies of Oktar&#x27;s book, &quot;The Evolution Deceit&quot;, and the booklets based on this book were distributed throughout Turkey. They regularly ran full-page ads against evolution in daily Turkish newspapers and even ran an ad in the U.S. magazine &quot;Time&quot;. Where the funding for the campaign came from is unknown.

BAV spearheaded an effort to confront Turkish academics who taught evolutionary biology. A number of faculty members were harassed, threatened and slandered in fliers, leading to legal action against BAV (see &quot;Legal Issues&quot; below). In 2005, Professor Ümit Sayın summed up the effect of the BAV&#x27;s campaign when he said to &quot;The Pitch&quot;:

In September 2008 Oktar issued a challenge offering &quot;10 trillion Turkish lira to anyone who produces a single intermediate-form fossil demonstrating evolution&quot;. He has stated: &quot;Not one [fossil] belongs to strange-looking creatures in the course of development of the kind supposed by evolutionists.&quot; Biology professor Kevin Padian at the University of California, Berkeley has criticized the notion that such fossils do not exist, stating that Oktar &quot;does not have any sense of what we know about how things change through time. If he sees a fossil crab, he says, &#x27;It looks just like a regular crab, there&#x27;s no evolution.&#x27;&quot;

Taner Edis has said &quot;there is nothing new in the Yahya material: scientifically negligible arguments and outright distortions often copied from Christian anti-evolution literature, presented with a conservative Muslim emphasis&quot; concluding it &quot;has no scholarly standing whatsoever&quot;. According to Richard Dawkins, Oktar &quot;doesn&#x27;t know anything about zoology, doesn&#x27;t know anything about biology. He knows nothing about what he is attempting to refute&quot;.

====&quot;The Atlas of Creation&quot;====
Oktar published volume 1 of his &quot;Yaratılış Atlası&quot; (&quot;The Atlas of Creation&quot;), with Global Publishing, Istanbul, Turkey in October 2006.
Volumes 2 and 3 followed in 2007. A dedicated website (yaratilisatlasi.com, English atlasofcreation.com) registered to Global Yayıncılık (Global Publishing), Istanbul, went online also in 2007.

At 28 cm x 43 cm and nearly 5.5 kg, with a bright red cover and almost 800 glossy pages, most of them lavishly illustrated, &quot;Atlas of Creation&quot; is according to &quot;The New York Times&quot; &quot;probably the largest and most beautiful creationist challenge yet to Darwin&#x27;s theory, which Yahya calls a feeble and perverted ideology contradicted by the Koran&quot;. Tens of thousands of copies of the book were sent—unsolicited—to schools, prominent researchers and research institutes throughout Europe and the United States.

In France, scientists spoke out against the book, and in America scientists are unimpressed.

Padian said that people who had received copies were &quot;just astounded at its size and production values and equally astonished at what a load of crap it is,&quot; adding that &quot;[Oktar] does not really have any sense of what we know about how things change through time.&quot;

Geneticist and writer Adam Rutherford writes that the book claims to prove that no species alive on Earth today underwent mutagenesis, but points out that 
Gerdien de Jong, one of five biologists at Utrecht University who received a copy of the book, has described its reasoning as &quot;absurdly ridiculous&quot;.

Biologist PZ Myers wrote: &quot;The general pattern of the book is repetitious and predictable: the book shows a picture of a fossil and a photo of a living animal, and declares that they haven&#x27;t changed a bit, therefore evolution is false. Over and over. It gets old fast, and it&#x27;s usually wrong (they have changed!) and the photography, while lovely, is entirely stolen.&quot;

The Committee on Culture, Science and Education of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe wrote in a report that &quot;None of the arguments in this work are based on any scientific evidence, and the book appears more like a primitive theological treatise than the scientific refutation of the theory of evolution.&quot;

===Conspiracy theories===
Oktar propagates a number of conspiracy theories, beginning with the antisemitic canard in his 1986 &quot;Judaism and Freemasonry&quot; (&quot;Yahudilik ve Masonluk&quot;). The book suggests that the principal mission of Jews and Freemasons in Turkey was to erode the spiritual, religious, and moral values of the Turkish people and, thus, make them like animals, as stated in what Oktar refers to as their use of &quot;Distorted Torah.&quot; Oktar asserts that &quot;the materialist standpoint, evolution theory, anti-religious and immoral lifestyles were indoctrinated to the society as a whole&quot; by Jews and Freemasons.

His theory of a global conspiracy of Freemasonry is expounded in his book &quot;Global Masonluk&quot; (&quot;Global Freemasonry&quot;) and on his websites &quot;Masonluk&quot; and &quot;Global Freemasonry&quot;. According to Oktar, Freemasonry is &quot;the main architect of the world system based on materialist philosophy, but which keeps that true identity concealed.&quot; Oktar called the theory of evolution a Masonic conspiracy initiated by the Rosicrucians.

Oktar&#x27;s recent publications no longer attack Jews and Judaism, but declare Darwinism and materialism to be conspiracies responsible for antisemitism and terrorism. In recent publications and interviews (since 2004). Oktar qualifies his condemnations of Zionism and Freemasonry by adding the word atheist before them, as in &quot;atheist Zionists&quot; and &quot;atheist Freemasons&quot;.

He believes that a secret cabal, known as the &quot;British deep state&quot;, is trying to control the world.

===Holocaust denial and affirmation===
Oktar&#x27;s position on the holocaust has evolved from &quot;antisemitic conspiracy-theorising&quot; (1980s), denying that the Nazis had a plan for the mass extermination of Jews (&quot;The Holocaust Deception,&quot; 1996), to acknowledging the genocide (&quot;The Holocaust Violence&quot;, 2006), and most recently to attending &quot;numerous events in Israel&quot;, being photographed with &quot;far-right Zionists like Yehuda Glick and Rabbi Meir Lau&quot;.

In 1996, BAV distributed its first book, originally published the previous year, entitled &quot;Soykırım Yalanı&quot; (&quot;The Holocaust Deception&quot; or &quot;The Holocaust Lie&quot;). The publication of &quot;Soykırım Yalanı&quot; sparked controversy. This book claims that &quot;what is presented as Holocaust is the death of some Jews due to the typhus plague during the war and the famine towards the end of the war caused by the defeat of the Germans.&quot;

A Turkish painter and intellectual, Bedri Baykam, published a strongly worded critique of the book in Ankara&#x27;s daily newspaper, &quot;Siyah-Beyaz&quot; (&quot;Black and White&quot;). A legal suit for slander was brought against him. During the trial in September, Baykam exposed the real author of &quot;The Holocaust Lie&quot; as Adnan Oktar. The suit was withdrawn in March 1997.

In 2001, the Stephen Roth Institute, of Tel Aviv University, listed Oktar as a Holocaust denier due to the publication of &quot;The Holocaust Lie&quot;. Three years later, the Stephen Roth Institute expressed the opinion that Oktar had increased his tolerance toward others, asserting that &quot;he now works towards promoting inter-religious dialogue&quot;, calling upon all Muslims to have &quot;a tolerant and friendly attitude toward other religions&quot;.

In 2006, BAV published a book affirming the Holocaust, called &quot;The Holocaust Violence&quot;. &quot;The Holocaust Violence&quot; states,
In a 2007 interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Oktar denied writing &quot;The Holocaust Lie&quot;, a claim that &quot;The Guardian&quot; stated was &quot;hard to believe.&quot; The next year in an interview with &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;, Oktar claimed &quot;The Holocaust Lie&quot; had been written by a friend who had published his own essays using Oktar&#x27;s pen name, &quot;Harun Yahya&quot;, on his own. Oktar disclaimed the first book, and said the second book reflected his own opinions.

In 2009, Oktar expressed his new views on Jews in his own words, &quot;hatred or anger toward the line of the Prophet Abraham is completely unacceptable. The Prophet Abraham is our ancestor, and the Jews are our brothers. We want the descendants of the Prophet Abraham to live in the easiest, pleasantest and most peaceful manner. We want them to be free to perform their religious obligations, to live as they wish in the lands of their forebears and to frequently remember Allah in comfort and security.&quot;

Nevertheless, that year the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) described Yahya as &quot;an anti-Semitic Turkish writer whose articles demonize Jews who support Israel as &quot;godless&quot; and blames them for committing atrocities.&quot; The ADL also argued that Yahya quotes Holocaust-denier Roger Garaudy and still cites &quot;The Holocaust Deception&quot; in the articles on his site.

After his 2018 arrest Oktar was described by &quot;The Times of Israel&quot; as having &quot;been criticized in the past for publishing books featuring anti-Semitic conspiracy theories and Holocaust denial, but in recent years has renounced them and held events to combat those phenomena in the Muslim world. He has been embraced by some high-profile Israelis.&quot;

===Television broadcasting===
On 21 March 2011, Oktar started television broadcasting on the A9 satellite channel, which broadcasts over both the internet and Turkish cable networks.
The channel is his &quot;main platform&quot; for broadcasting his &quot;unique brand of televangelism&quot;, interviews, night lectures, as well as documentaries based on his works.

His TV programs have received considerable attention from both Turkish and international media for their &#x27;weirdness&#x27;, and in particular for featuring female devotees, he calls his &#x27;kittens&#x27;. In stark contrast to orthodox Islamic decorum and the shows of any other Muslim televangelist, the women, who are usually wealthy socialites who have undergone plastic surgery, wear heavy make-up and tight Versace T-shirts (or other tight, revealing outfits), and dance to pop music between sets. They and Adnan Oktar have discussions about Islam, fossils that supposedly discredit evolution, and about Oktar himself.

Oktar has defended the unusual appearance of his co-hosts in Islamic terms (&quot;A woman may wear the head-covering, or cover herself up entirely or uncover her head or wear low-cut clothes. Once she says, &#x27;I am a Muslim,&#x27; nobody has the right to judge her.&quot;) But others have questioned whether Oktar and his kitten cohosts are motivated by the empowerment of women and basing Islam only on the Quran (setting aside Sunni and Shia doctrines and traditions).

According to Edip Yüksel, Oktar got the idea that hijab is not necessary for women from him in the 1980s. &quot;At that time I said that the headscarf doesn&#x27;t exist in the Quran&quot;, and thought of Oktar as a kindred spirit. But now he feels his argument has been &quot;abused&quot; on behalf of a &quot;sex cult&quot;, which has &quot;created very bad associations for the cause of reformation&quot; of Islam. Journalist Meher Ahmad attempted to interview the women in Oktar&#x27;s group about feminism in Islam, travelling to Istanbul in 2015 to make a video for Vice. But when she arrived she found herself repeatedly stonewalled and treated with suspicion&quot;, by Oktar&#x27;s people unable to get &quot;a one-on-one interview or a group interview with the women.&quot;

===Other religious beliefs===
Oktar has been described as preaching Islam as a &quot;dutiful disciple&quot; of Kurdish Islamic scholar Said Nursî, criticizing not only Communism, but Atatürk&#x27;s secular reforms, and especially his mortal enemy Freemasonry, but making &quot;no claim whatever to clerical authority&quot;.

;United Islamic state
Oktar has preached for Turkish-Islamic union, &quot;a new Ottoman Empire girdling the world from Eastern Russia to Western Nigeria, which would unify the Islamic world under Turkish leadership&quot;.

;Sex outside of marriage
According to Halil Arda, Oktar justified concubinage &quot;by reference to the Ottoman harems, while passages of the Koran were recited to justify the practice of severing the ties of the young followers to their families&quot;. He quotes a Turkish legal scholar &quot;involved in some of the court cases against Oktar&quot;:

Despite cutting off these relations, the group ultimately depended on parents financial and social resources. &quot;followers were encouraged to plunder their parents&#x27; bank accounts and sell their assets&quot;. 
;Love of luxury
&quot;I want to resemble Prophet Solomon. Prophet Solomon was like this. He used to be well dressed. He liked being well dressed. His palace was beautiful; there were beautiful people around him. Allah is beautiful. Allah loves those who are beautiful, wants everywhere to be beautiful. Paradise is also beautiful. [The] aim of a Muslim should be beauty.&quot;
;Eschatology
Oktar preaches that &quot;the day of judgement, contrary to what may believe, is approaching now, not in some distant future&quot;. There will be two apocalyptic phases: one of &quot;material and spiritual problems&quot;, followed by a &#x27;Golden Age&#x27;, where &quot;true religion&quot; brings &quot;generosity and kindness&quot;. This will be followed by &quot;rapid social collapse&quot; before Judgment Day arrives. One unique variation by Oktar on the traditional prophesy of Gog and Magog is that their invasion will not be of hordes of warriors but of television programs they transmit, and that the blocking of them by the Two-Horned One (Dhu al-Qarnayn) will not be by some wall but by electromagnetic jamming.
Oktar has also emphasized the importance in Islam of &quot;the role to be played by Jesus at the end of the world&quot;, which permits him &quot;to cultivate an ecumenical image&quot;—Muslims and Christians will be joined in combat &#x27;destroying the society established by the Antichrist, they will save mankind from atheism&#x27;&quot;.
;No true beliefs
According to one critic (Halil Arda in New Humanist), Oktar&#x27;s &quot;ideological and political promiscuity&quot; (jumping from Anti-Darwinism, interfaith dialogue, Turkish-Islamic union) may be because he doesn&#x27;t really have any &quot;genuine beliefs&quot;, and merely work by opportunistically jumping &quot;on issues&quot; that followers have come up with and that he thinks &quot;will further his notoriety&quot;. Arda quotes a former follower: &quot;We had something to please everybody: Atatürk, namaz (ritual prayer), creationism and, if need be, cocaine.&quot;

===Bibliography===

Oktar&#x27;s books and brochures appear in Turkish published by &quot;Vural Yayıncılık&quot; (&quot;Global Publishing&quot;) of Istanbul. English translations of his books are published by Ta-Ha Publishers in London, Global Publishing of Istanbul, Al-Attique Publishers in Toronto, and Goodword Books of New Delhi, India. As of mid-2008, Oktar&#x27;s &quot;publishing empire&quot; had produced &quot;260 books in 52 languages, over 80 DVDs and dozens of websites&quot;.

Publication media includes: Books, booklets, pamphlets, children&#x27;s books, journals, documentaries, audiobooks, CDs, posters and over a hundred websites. The total number of books and brochures published by Oktar number in the hundreds. The works are lavishly produced, on good-quality paper with full-color illustrations and sold in Islamic bookstores worldwide.

==Other legal issues==
In addition to the slander trial over &quot;The Holocaust Lie&quot;, Oktar has been involved in other cases. Although most are unrelated to creationism or religion, a BAV spokesperson says Oktar is being persecuted &quot;because of his ideas.&quot; Physicist Taner Edis of Truman State University, who has followed the case closely, says given the political pressures on Turkey&#x27;s justice system, that&#x27;s &quot;not entirely implausible.&quot;

In the summer of 1986, Oktar was arrested for his statement &quot;I am from the nation of Abraham and Turkish ethnicity&quot; in a newspaper interview. Oktar was arrested for promoting a theocratic revolution for which he served 19 months, though he was never formally charged.

In 1991, Oktar was arrested for possession of cocaine, which he claimed had been planted in one of the books in his library by the security forces, who, he said, also spiked his food with cocaine. He was later acquitted.

A number of faculty members who taught evolution were harassed, threatened and slandered in flyers that labeled them &quot;Maoists&quot;. In 1999, six of the professors won a civil court case against the BAV for defamation and were each awarded $4,000.

In 1999, Oktar was arrested and charged with using threats for personal benefit and creating an organization with the intent to commit a crime. BAV&#x27;s lawyers claimed there were several human rights violations during this police operation, as well as the use of violence during the arrest and afterwards. The judicial process lasted over two years, during which most of the complainants retracted their claims. As a result, cases against Oktar and other BAV members were dismissed.

The 1999 case was reopened by another court in 2008. The indictment from the prosecutor&#x27;s office, made public by &quot;Cumhuriyet&quot;, claimed blackmail and extortion. Among other things, it claimed that BAV used its female members to attract young scholars from rich families with the promise of sexual favors in exchange for attending events. It was claimed that the sexual activities of thousands of people were videotaped with hidden cameras for the purpose of blackmail. Members who wanted to leave the group were threatened that the tapes would be made public. In the face of all these allegations against BAV, the Chairman of the Court announced in the hearing on 29 February 2008, that testimonies obtained through unlawful means may not be considered as evidence based on article 148 of the criminal code.

Oktar was convicted of creating an illegal organization for personal gain. He and 17 other members of his organisation were sentenced to three years in prison. Oktar appealed the verdict. In May 2010, the Court of Appeals overturned the conviction and dismissed the charges.

==Blocking of Internet sites==
Since 2007, Oktar has successfully had the Turkish government block public access to several websites. In April 2007, Oktar filed a libel lawsuit against the owners of Ekşi Sözlük, a virtual community similar to everything2. The court reviewed the complaint and ordered the service provider to close the site to public access. The site was temporarily suspended so the entry on Oktar could be expunged and locked. Then access to &quot;Süper Poligon&quot;, a news website, was also restricted following Oktar&#x27;s complaint. In August 2007, Oktar got a Turkish court to block WordPress.com throughout Turkey. His lawyers argued that blogs on WordPress.com contained libelous material, which WordPress.com was unwilling to remove.

Edip Yüksel, a Turkish writer who knew Oktar in the 1980s, had his own website banned in Turkey due to Oktar&#x27;s complaints. In addition, Yüksel wrote a Turkish-language book, &quot;The Cult of the Antichrist&quot;, but has yet to find &quot;a publisher willing to brave Mr. Oktar&#x27;s lawyers.&quot;

On 19 September 2008, a Turkish court banned Internet users in Turkey from viewing the official Richard Dawkins website after Oktar claimed its contents were defamatory, blasphemous and insulting to religion, arguing that his personality was violated by this site. The ban was lifted on 8 July 2011.

In September 2008, a complaint by Oktar led to the banning of the internet site of the Union of Education and Scientific Workers. This was followed by a block of the country&#x27;s third-biggest newspaper site, &quot;Vatan&quot;, in October.

<text>Thomas Winfried Menko Pogge (; born 13 August 1953) is a German philosopher and is the Director of the Global Justice Program and Leitner Professor of Philosophy and International Affairs at Yale University, United States. In addition to his Yale appointment, he is the Research Director of the Centre for the Study of the Mind in Nature at the University of Oslo, Norway, a Professorial Research Fellow at the Centre for Applied Philosophy and Public Ethics at Charles Sturt University, Australia, and Professor of Political Philosophy at the University of Central Lancashire&#x27;s Centre for Professional Ethics, England. Pogge is also an editor for social and political philosophy for the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy and a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters.

==Early life==
Pogge received his PhD from Harvard University in 1983. His dissertation, titled &quot;Kant, Rawls, and Global Justice&quot;, was supervised by John Rawls. Since then, he has published widely on Immanuel Kant and in moral and political philosophy, including various books on Rawls and global justice.

==Major works==

===&quot;The Health Impact Fund: Making New Medicines Accessible for All&quot; (2008)===
In this book, Thomas Pogge and Aidan Hollis argue in favour of establishing the Health Impact Fund (HIF). The HIF is a new proposal for stimulating research and development of life-saving pharmaceuticals that make substantial reductions in the global burden of disease.

The HIF will provide pharmaceutical companies with a new choice. Pharmaceutical companies can sell a new medicine in the usual manner at patent-protected high prices, or they can choose to register their new medicine with the HIF and sell it globally at the cost of production. If they choose to register their medicine with the HIF, the pharmaceutical company will receive additional payments from the fund that are proportionate to health improvements that are brought about by the registered medicines. The more effective the medicine is in improving global health, the bigger the payout. Because malaria kills millions, the firm that finds and develops a cure can expect a significant return.

===&quot;World Poverty and Human Rights&quot; (2002, 2008)===
Pogge&#x27;s &quot;World Poverty and Human Rights&quot; (2002) includes a number of original and substantial theses, the most notable being that people in wealthy Western liberal democracies (such as Western Europeans) are currently harming the world&#x27;s poor (like those in sub-Saharan Africa). In particular, without denying that much blame should be directed at domestic kleptocrats, Pogge argues that international institutions facilitate and exacerbate the corruption perpetuated by national institutions. Pogge is especially critical of the “resource” and “borrowing” privileges, which allow illegitimate political leaders to sell natural resources and to borrow money in the name of the country and its people. In Pogge&#x27;s analysis, these resource and borrowing privileges that international society extends to oppressive rulers of impoverished states play a crucial causal role in perpetuating absolute poverty. What is more, Pogge maintains that these privileges are no accident; they persist because they are in the interest of the wealthy states. The resource privilege helps guarantee a reliable supply of raw materials for the goods enjoyed by the members of wealthy states, and the borrowing privilege allows the financial institutions of wealthy states to issue lucrative loans. It may seem that such loans are good for developing states too, but Pogge argues that, in practice, they typically work quite to the contrary:

&quot;Local elites can afford to be oppressive and corrupt, because, with foreign loans and military aid, they can stay in power even without popular support. And they are often so oppressive and corrupt, because it is, in light of the prevailing extreme international inequalities, far more lucrative for them to cater to the interests of foreign governments and firms than to those of their impoverished compatriots.&quot;

===&quot;Realizing Rawls&quot; (1989)===
In &quot;Realizing Rawls&quot;, Pogge defends, criticizes and extends John Rawls&#x27;s &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot; (1971). Pogge insists that Rawls has been importantly misunderstood by his most influential critics, including the libertarian Robert Nozick and the communitarian Michael Sandel. According to Pogge, Rawls’ reluctance to disagree sharply with his critics has helped these (mis)understandings to become widespread, and has also induced Rawls in his more recent work to dilute the moral statement of his central Rawlsian ideas: first, that moral deliberation must begin from reflection upon the justice of our basic social institutions; and second, that the justice of an institutional scheme is to be assessed by how well its least advantaged participants fare. From these starting points, Pogge develops his own specification of Rawls&#x27;s principles of justice, discussing the relative importance of different fundamental rights and liberties, the ideal constitution of the political process, and the just organization of educational, health-care, and economic institutions. In the last part of the book, Pogge argues for extending the Rawlsian criterion of justice to the international arena, and identifies those features of the present global order that this criterion would single out as principal targets for institutional reform.

==Other projects==

===Giving What We Can===
Pogge deeply influenced Toby Ord in founding Giving What We Can, an effective altruism organization whose members pledge to give at least 10% of their income to effective charities. The aim of the organization is to encourage people to commit to long-term donations to those charities that provide the most cost-effective good.

In addition, he became a member of the organization at its beginnings in 2009.

===Incentives for Global Health (IGH)===
IGH is a non-profit organization dedicated to developing market-based, systemic solutions to health challenges faced by the world&#x27;s poor. Its flagship proposal is the Health Impact Fund.

===Academics Stand Against Poverty (ASAP)===

Academics Stand Against Poverty is an organization meant to help academics have a greater impact on world poverty. “The group lies between academia and activism. Like the latter, it aims primarily at persuading and motivating people to change their behavior. Like the former, it does so by moral and political argument, using the distinctive skills of academics.”

This project is still in its beginning stages. It has three central aims:
# To disseminate accessible versions of arguments for taking action against world poverty to the public;
# To disseminate responses to standard objections to such arguments to the public; 
# To distribute discussion of what individuals and states in developing countries should do in response to world poverty to the public.

===Poverty and gender equality measurement===
Various indices - the United Nations Development Programme&#x27;s Human and Gender‐Related Development Indices, and the World Bank’s Poverty Index - are used to track poverty, development, and gender equity at the population level. Pogge argues that these prominent indices are deeply flawed and therefore distort our moral judgments and misguide resource allocations by governments, international agencies, and non-governmental organizations.

“This project will work toward new indices ‘of poverty and of gender equity’ applicable both at the national and supranational levels, and to smaller groups affected by specific policies and programs. Both indices will draw on a holistic measure of individual (dis)advantage that reflects all relevant aspects of a person&#x27;s situation.”

Pogge has pursued similar themes in &quot;Politics as Usual: What Lies Behind the Pro-Poor Rhetoric&quot; (2010).

===Illicit financial flows===
This project focuses on the illicit financial flows out of developing countries, the lack of transparency in the global financial system, and the impact these conditions have on human rights. The driving idea behind this project is that “‘human rights and international financial integrity are intimately linked’” and that poverty increases when money flows out of nations illicitly instead of being invested in the basic needs of people in their countries.”

===Forced Labor and Human Trafficking===
The Forced Labor and Human Trafficking project aims &quot;to bring public, official, and mainstream media attention to the global crisis of human trafficking and labor abuse towards children and adults.&quot; The non-profit organization Art Works Projects is a contributor to this project.

==Sexual harassment allegations==

As a professor at Columbia University in the mid-1990s, Pogge had been disciplined by the school following allegations of sexual harassment. He was later hired by Yale University. In 2010, Pogge was accused in a high-profile sexual harassment case of by a recent Yale graduate, Fernanda Lopez Aguilar. Aguilar was represented by sexual harassment and discrimination lawyer Ann Olivarius. The university cleared Pogge of misconduct. Afterwards, 169 philosophy professors from several countries, including many in Pogge&#x27;s own academic department at Yale, signed an open letter condemning his behavior and asking the U.S. Department of Education&#x27;s Office for Civil Rights to investigate Yale&#x27;s response. Some of the professors who signed the letter pledged to skip conferences in which Pogge is involved and to remove his work from their curricula. Pogge wrote a detailed defense. In 2019, the Yale Daily News reported a graduate student stating that Pogge continuing to teach undergraduates was a “source of difficulty” and that his presence was cause of &quot;persistent unrest among the graduate students.”

<doc id="1181848" wikidata="Q5314794" url="?curid=1181848" title="Dundee–Happy Hollow Historic District">
<text>The Dundee–Happy Hollow Historic District is located west of Midtown Omaha, Nebraska. It covers the area between Harney Street on the south, Hamilton Street on the north, Happy Hollow Boulevard on the west, and 46th Street on the east. The &quot;heart&quot; of Dundee is located at 50th and Underwood Avenue in Omaha, Nebraska, United States. It was founded in 1880 and annexed into the city in 1915. Dundee is home to Warren Buffett and nationally syndicated editorial cartoonist Jeff Koterba and was the hometown of filmmaker Alexander Payne. Actor Henry Fonda additionally lived in the Dundee neighborhood.

== History ==
The neighborhood was developed in 1880 and has been dubbed Omaha&#x27;s first suburb.

The Shannon Brothers of Kansas City were hired to construct six homes between 48th and 52nd Street, Capitol to California. The brothers had just converted the Kansas City Fairgrounds on the edge of Downtown Kansas City into a planned residential development called Dundee Place and they hoped to do the same in Omaha. Unlike other suburban development where the houses look similar, the houses in Dundee were built to look distinctive.

The Omaha Herald on October 30, 1888 noted neighborhood covenants required that the buildings be for residential purposes only, stand at least 25 feet away from the street, cost at least $2500, and not be &quot;used for any immoral or illegal business, nor shall any spirits or malt liquors be sold or bartered away.&quot;

The houses did not initially sell well and the developers set out to create the neighborhood as a self-contained village. Developers planted 2,000 maple trees along the roadways (one of which was named Underwood for one of the developers). In 1905 developer Luke Toot O&#x27;Keefe offered free lots if the buyer built. If the buyer stayed for more than a year he got a bonus of $500. Interest in the neighborhood skyrocketed and the developers expanded to be south of Dodge Street and north of Cuming Street.

C.C. and J.E. George laid out Happy Hollow Boulevard and developed the area south of Dodge and west of 50th to Elmwood Park. They filled in the creek that ran along 50th Street and added sidewalks and the Dundee lights. Homes in the area reflected the Colonial, Georgian and Tudor Revival styles. Omaha annexed Dundee on June 20, 1915. At that time it was and had 2500 residents.

The district includes 30 known works by Omaha architect F. A. Henninger.

===World War II bombing===
In April 1945 a Japanese fire balloon exploded over Dundee. The incident was part of a large World War II campaign by the Japanese military to cause mass chaos in American cities. However, the story was suppressed by the American military until after the war was over. Nobody was hurt in the explosion.

==Education==
This central Omaha neighborhood is home to Dundee Elementary School, which is in the Omaha Public Schools district. Brownell-Talbot School is a historic, traditionally Episcopalian school. St. Margaret Mary&#x27;s school is the local Catholic school. SMM was rated the city&#x27;s best private school when it received the &quot;Blue Ribbon Award&quot; in 2006. On the outskirts of Dundee is Harrison Elementary School, which is also part of the Omaha Public Schools. Most children from the two OPS elementary schools attend Lewis &amp; Clark Middle School, and then Omaha Central High School. The area is renowned for its numerous historic residences.

==Parks and attractions==
Two major area parks are in the neighborhood are Memorial Park and Elmwood Park. St. Margaret Mary Catholic Church and Dundee Presbyterian Church (the church Warren Buffett attended and in which he was married) are among many congregations in Dundee. The area is home to numerous businesses, including the Dundee Dell, the Dundee Theatre, the Blue Line Coffee Shop, Exist Green Zero Waste Market and Refillery, the Underwood Bar, and eCreamery Ice Cream and Gelato. The area is promoted and preserved by the Dundee-Memorial Park Association. St. Margaret Mary Catholic Church and the associated school are known for extreme pride in their neighborhood. Dundee annually hosts Dundee Day, featuring a neighborhood festival and dance showdown.

Warren Buffett, the &quot;Oracle of Omaha&quot;, lives in a house bought for $31,500 in 1958 in Dundee ($340,000 in 2024), on the corner of Farnam and 55th. The average sales price of a home in Dundee as of December 31st, 2023 is $379,544.

Dundee Community Garden, located on 49th and Underwood, serves as a neighborhood common space open to the public. Plots for planting are available to community members for a nominal fee. Members of the garden routinely provide free vegetables from the communal beds to underserved population in the community.

==American Planning Association&#x27;s Great American Places of 2011==
Dundee-Memorial Park district has been named one of APA&#x27;s Great American Places of 2011 because of the neighborhoods pro-active vibrant community. The community has developed a street car plan and they seek National Register status. The community also created an adopt-a-streetlight program with efforts to restore 328 historic cast-iron poles. They pushed to be named a neighborhood conservation and enhancement district. The neighborhood offers a variety of architecture as well as two major parks in Omaha, Nebraska. 
The city has made many substantial efforts to improve the daily life within the neighborhood. They decided to allocate “$550,000 of $2.2 million needed to implement merchant-funded street-scape master plan (2009) to improve traffic flow, increase parking, and add amenities.” Dundee Neighborhood Conservation-Enhancement District Plan has also preserved a two block district for historical preservation.

<text>Edward Cross (November 11, 1798 – April 6, 1887) was a judge, surveyor, and Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives from the state of Arkansas.

==Biography==
Cross was born in Hawkins County, Tennessee, and he attended public schools during his youth. He studied law and was admitted to the bar. He owned slaves.

==Career==
In 1826 Cross moved to Arkansas and was appointed as a Judge of the Superior Court of the Arkansas Territory on May 26, 1830. From April 30, 1836, to September 1, 1838, he served as United States surveyor general for Arkansas.

Cross was elected as a Democrat to the Twenty-sixth, Twenty-seventh, and Twenty-eighth United States Congresses between March 4, 1839, and March 3, 1845. During the Twenty-eighth Congress he served as chairman of the Committee on Private Land Claims.

Cross served as a justice of the Arkansas Supreme Court from July 1845 to 1855. Cross served as president of the Cairo &amp; Fulton Railway (later the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway from 1855 to 1862. In 1874 he was appointed attorney general of Arkansas.

==Death==
Cross died at his residence, &quot;Marlbrook&quot;, near Washington, Hempstead County, Arkansas on 6 April 1887 (age 88 years, 146 days). He was interred at his residence, then his remains were moved and interred at the Marlbrook Cemetery near modern-day Blevins, Arkansas in the 20th century. Cross County, Arkansas is named for his son, David Cross.

<doc id="1181861" wikidata="Q7048830" url="?curid=1181861" title="Non-adjacent form">
<text>The non-adjacent form (NAF) of a number is a unique signed-digit representation, in which non-zero values cannot be adjacent. For example:

:(0 1 1 1)2 = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7
:(1 0 −1 1)2 = 8 − 2 + 1 = 7
:(1 −1 1 1)2 = 8 − 4 + 2 + 1 = 7
:(1 0 0 −1)2 = 8 − 1 = 7

All are valid signed-digit representations of 7, but only the final representation, (1 0 0 −1), is in non-adjacent form.

The non-adjacent form is also known as &quot;canonical signed digit&quot; representation.

==Properties==
NAF assures a unique representation of an integer, but the main benefit of it is that the Hamming weight of the value will be minimal. For regular binary representations of values, half of all bits will be non-zero, on average, but with NAF this drops to only one-third of all digits. This leads to efficient implementations of add/subtract networks (e.g. multiplication by a constant) in hardwired digital signal processing.

Obviously, at most half of the digits are non-zero, which was the reason it was introduced by G.W. Reitweisner for speeding up early multiplication algorithms, much like Booth encoding.

Because every non-zero digit has to be adjacent to two 0s, the NAF representation can be implemented such that it only takes a maximum of &quot;m&quot; + 1 bits for a value that would normally be represented in binary with &quot;m&quot; bits.

The properties of NAF make it useful in various algorithms, especially some in cryptography; e.g., for reducing the number of multiplications needed for performing an exponentiation. In the algorithm, exponentiation by squaring, the number of multiplications depends on the number of non-zero bits. If the exponent here is given in NAF form, a digit value 1 implies a multiplication by the base, and a digit value −1 by its reciprocal.

Other ways of encoding integers that avoid consecutive 1s include Booth encoding and Fibonacci coding.

==Converting to NAF==
There are several algorithms for obtaining the NAF representation of a value given in binary. One such is the following method using repeated division; it works by choosing non-zero coefficients such that the resulting quotient is divisible by 2 and hence the next coefficient a zero.

 Input &quot;E&quot; = (&quot;e&quot;&quot;m&quot;−1 &quot;e&quot;&quot;m&quot;−2 ··· &quot;e&quot;1 &quot;e&quot;0)2
 Output &quot;Z&quot; = (&quot;z&quot;&quot;m&quot; &quot;z&quot;&quot;m&quot;−1 ··· &quot;z&quot;1 &quot;z&quot;0)NAF
 &quot;i&quot; ← 0
 while &quot;E&quot; &gt; 0 do
 if &quot;E&quot; is odd then
 &quot;z&quot;&quot;i&quot; ← 2 − (&quot;E&quot; mod 4)
 &quot;E&quot; ← &quot;E&quot; − &quot;z&quot;&quot;i&quot;
 else
 &quot;z&quot;&quot;i&quot; ← 0
 &quot;E&quot; ← &quot;E&quot;/2
 &quot;i&quot; ← &quot;i&quot; + 1
 return &quot;z&quot;

A faster way is given by Prodinger where &quot;x&quot; is the input, &quot;np&quot; the string of positive bits and &quot;nm&quot; the string of negative bits:

 Input &quot;x&quot;
 Output &quot;np&quot;, &quot;nm&quot;
 &quot;xh&quot; = &quot;x&quot; » 1;
 &quot;x3&quot; = &quot;x&quot; + &quot;xh&quot;;
 &quot;c&quot; = &quot;xh&quot; ^ &quot;x3&quot;;
 &quot;np&quot; = &quot;x3&quot; &amp; &quot;c&quot;;
 &quot;nm&quot; = &quot;xh&quot; &amp; &quot;c&quot;;

which is used, for example, in .

<text>Craig Krenzel (born July 1, 1981) is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Ohio State Buckeyes. As the starting quarterback, he led their 2002 team to a national championship. He played professionally in the NFL for one season with the Chicago Bears in 2004.

==Early life==
Krenzel attended Henry Ford II High School (Sterling Heights, Mich.), and was an excellent student and a letterman in football (3 yrs), basketball (2 yrs), and baseball (1 yr). In football, as a senior, Krenzel completed 60 percent of his passes and threw for 1,760 yards and 25 touchdowns, and won USA Today honorable mention All-America accolades that year.

==College career==
Krenzel played in college for The Ohio State Buckeyes. After quarterback Steve Bellisari was suspended from play due to an alcohol-related police charge late in the 2001 season, Krenzel earned the starting position against Michigan and led the Buckeyes to their first win in Ann Arbor since 1987. His most successful year was 2002 when he led Ohio State to the national championship. Krenzel was 24–2 as a starter (while appearing in 27 games, appearing in relief of Scott McMullen in a loss to Illinois in 2001).

Krenzel graduated from The Ohio State University with a degree in molecular genetics and a GPA of 3.75. He did research as part of a selective oncology laboratory at the Ohio State University Medical Center. Krenzel was named a First-team Academic All-American and Academic All-American of the Year, and received three Academic All-Big Ten awards, the Today&#x27;s Top VIII Award, a National Football Foundation Hall of Fame post-graduate scholarship, &quot;Sporting News&quot;&#x27; Socrates Award, and the Draddy Trophy.

Krenzel&#x27;s brother Brian was also talented in both academics and athletics, playing for the Duke Blue Devils football team before graduating from the University of Louisville School of Medicine.

==Professional career==
Krenzel was drafted in the fifth round of the 2004 NFL draft by the Chicago Bears, for whom he played the 2004 season. Despite poor passing statistics, Krenzel won his first three starts at quarterback with the Bears, including a win over the San Francisco 49ers, which was at the time starting Ken Dorsey at quarterback, the same quarterback that started for the Miami Hurricanes during the 2003 National Championship game. However, he lost his final two starts with the Bears and injured his ankle, ending his season. In 2005, he was cut by the Bears in the offseason and he signed with the Cincinnati Bengals. He was the third-string quarterback on the team behind Carson Palmer and Jon Kitna. He was released by the Bengals in May 2006 due to an elbow injury that he sustained that eventually required Tommy John surgery.

==Personal life==
Krenzel now works as a commentator on 97.1 The Fan in Columbus, Ohio. Craig is known for his bit known as the &quot;Mike Tomczak Story.&quot;

He is also a spokesman for JD Equipment and has acted in several commercial spots.

Krenzel now is a partner of the Arthur Krenzel Lett Insurance Group in Columbus, Ohio and Winfield, West Virginia. Craig Lett, his business partner, is the son of the Minor League pitcher Jim Lett of the Cincinnati Reds.

<doc id="1181899" wikidata="Q572751" url="?curid=1181899" title="Ingénue (album)">
<text>Ingénue is the second solo album by Canadian singer k.d. lang, released in 1992. It is Lang&#x27;s most successful album on the pop charts, both in her native Canada and internationally, and has more of a cabaret flavor than her earlier more country-influenced work.

==Singles==
&quot;Constant Craving&quot; was the first single released from the album. It peaked at number 8 in Lang&#x27;s native Canada, number 38 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number 15 in the UK Singles Chart when re-released, becoming her biggest solo hit single there. &quot;Constant Craving&quot; inspired (albeit subconsciously) The Rolling Stones&#x27; 1997 single &quot;Anybody Seen My Baby?&quot;, from their &quot;Bridges to Babylon&quot; album, with the result that the Stones gave writing credits on that song to lang and her collaborator Ben Mink.

&quot;Miss Chatelaine&quot; was released as the second single from the album. The song&#x27;s video depicted Lang—who was usually best known for a fairly androgynous appearance—in an exaggeratedly feminine manner, surrounded by bright pastel colours and a profusion of bubbles reminiscent of a performance on &quot;The Lawrence Welk Show&quot;, complete with an accordion in the instrumentation.

A third single, &quot;The Mind of Love&quot;, was also released.

<doc id="1181904" wikidata="Q7815229" url="?curid=1181904" title="Tom Carvel">
<text>Tom Carvel (born Athanasios Karvelas (; July 14, 1906 – October 21, 1990) was a Greek-born American businessman and entrepreneur known for the invention and promotion of soft-serve ice cream in the northeastern United States. He was the founder of the Carvel brand and franchise.

==Early business career==
Carvel began selling ice cream out of his truck in 1929 in Hartsdale, New York. On Memorial Day weekend in 1934, his truck had a flat tire, so he pulled into a parking lot next to a pottery store and began selling his melting ice cream to vacationers who were driving by. The owner of the store allowed Carvel to use electricity from his store. As such, Carvel opened his parked truck for ice cream sales. Within two days, he had sold his entire supply of ice cream and concluded that he could increase his profits by working from a fixed location.

==Carvel Brands franchising==
In 1936, Carvel purchased the pottery store and converted it into a roadside ice cream stand; this permanently established Carvel as the first retailer to develop and market soft ice cream. The same year, he established the Carvel Brand Corporation and developed a secret soft-serve ice cream formula.

Carvel also developed new refrigeration machines and sold his designs. After World War II, he began to franchise his ice cream stores. Carvel was featured in his own advertisements as the company believed that his gravelly voice and personal charm were important factors in the success of his business.

The Carvel company specializes in ice cream cakes, often in the shapes of animals. Two of the most popular ice cream novelties introduced by the company have been &quot;Fudgie the Whale&quot; and &quot;Cookie Puss&quot;. The brand continues to operate using a franchising model, primarily concentrated in the Northeast United States and Florida.

==Death==
Carvel died in Pine Plains, Dutchess County, New York, in 1990 and is buried with his wife Agnes in Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale.

=== Controversy ===
In October 2009, Carvel&#x27;s niece Pamela Carvel filed court papers to have Carvel&#x27;s body exhumed and an autopsy performed, stating she suspected he was drugged or suffocated by employees whom Carvel suspected of embezzlement. Her petition was denied, and she later became a fugitive from justice in a personal bankruptcy case. She had been vying for control of his $67-million estate.

<doc id="1181925" wikidata="Q123269416" url="?curid=1181925" title="Sabbath desecration">
<text>Sabbath desecration is the failure to observe the Biblical Sabbath and is usually considered a sin and a breach of a holy day in relation to either the Jewish &quot;Shabbat&quot; (Friday sunset to Saturday nightfall), the Sabbath in seventh-day churches, or to the Lord&#x27;s Day (Sunday), which is recognized as the Christian Sabbath in first-day Sabbatarian denominations.

==Judaism==

According to Mosaic Law, to desecrate &quot;shabbat&quot; intentionally, despite warning, is a capital offense (Exodus 31:14). All work was prohibited during &quot;shabbat&quot;, even minor tasks, such as &quot;gathering wood&quot; (Numbers 15:32-36). Since the decline of classical &quot;semicha&quot; (rabbinic ordination) in the 4th century C.E., the traditional Jewish view is that Jewish courts have lost the power to rule on criminal cases. As such, it would be practically impossible for Orthodox courts to enforce the death penalty in modern times, even if they had the political standing to do so. Talmudic protections for defendants make execution very difficult even by the Great Sanhedrin, e.g., requiring two competent witnesses to the &quot;shabbat&quot; violation and an official court warning prior to the violation. Some Reform and Conservative rabbis condemn capital punishment generally, partly based on this stringency.

There are 39 categories of activity prohibited on Shabbat, derived in the tractate Shabbat (Talmud) from the construction of the Biblical tabernacle. &quot;Halakha&quot; (Jewish law) derives many further forbidden acts from these categories (&quot;toledoth&quot; and &quot;shevuth&quot;), with varying severity, that may not be performed except for preventing severe illness or death. Unwarranted violation of any of these precepts is termed &quot;chillul shabbat&quot; (&quot;profanation of &quot;shabbat&quot;&quot;). People who consistently violate &quot;shabbat&quot; today are generally not considered reliable in certain matters of Jewish law.

==Christianity==

Congregationalists, Presbyterians, Methodists, and Baptists, as well as many Episcopalians, have historically espoused the view of first-day Sabbatarianism, which teaches that the Lord&#x27;s Day (Sunday) is the Christian Sabbath, in keeping with the understanding that the moral law contained in the Ten Commandments stands eternally.

In contrast, Seventh-day Sabbatarians believe that the Sabbath should be observed on Saturday, holding that it was not transferred from Saturday to Sunday. Other Christians do not observe the Sabbath or apply it to a &quot;day of rest&quot;, believing that it is a part of the Mosaic Law that has no application to Christians.

===Traditional application to Sunday===
The traditional application of the Christian Sabbath to Sunday is based on the claim that the Sabbath was moved to the Lord&#x27;s Day, the day that Jesus rose from the dead. First-day Sabbatarian (Sunday Sabbatarian) practices include attending morning and evening church services on Sundays, receiving catechesis in Sunday School on the Lord&#x27;s Day, taking the Lord&#x27;s Day off from servile labour, not eating at restaurants on Sundays, not Sunday shopping, not using public transportation on the Lord&#x27;s Day, not participating in sporting events that are held on Sundays, as well as not viewing television and the internet on Sundays; Christians who are Sunday Sabbatarians often engage in works of mercy on the Lord&#x27;s Day, such as evangelism, as well as visiting prisoners at jails and the sick at hospitals and nursing homes.

The Westminster Confession, held by Presbyterian Churches, teaches first-day Sabbatarianism:
As it is the law of nature, that, in general, a due proportion of time be set apart for the worship of God; so, in His Word, by a positive, moral, and perpetual commandment binding all men in all ages, He has particularly appointed one day in seven, for a Sabbath, to be kept holy unto him (Ex. 20:8, 20:10-11, Is. 56:2, 56:4, 56:6-7): which, from the beginning of the world to the resurrection of Christ, was the last day of the week: and, from the resurrection of Christ, was changed into the first day of the week (Ge. 2:2-3, 1 Cor. 16:1-2, Ac. 20:7), which, in Scripture, is called the Lord&#x27;s Day (Rev. 1:10), and is to be continued to the end of the world, as the Christian Sabbath (Ex. 20:8, 20:10, Mt. 5:17). This Sabbath is to be kept holy unto the Lord when men, after a due preparing of their hearts, and ordering of their common affairs beforehand, do not only observe an holy rest all the day from their own works, words, and thoughts about their worldly employments and recreations (Ex. 20:8, 16:23, 16:25-26, 16:29-30, 31:15-17, Is. 58:13, Neh. 13:15-19, 13:21-22), but also are taken up the whole time in the public and private exercises of His worship, and in the duties of necessity and mercy (Is. 58:13).
This statement was adopted by the Congregationalist Churches, which are descended from the Puritans, in their Savoy Declaration. The 1689 Baptist Confession of Faith of the Reformed Baptists advances the same first-day Sabbatarian obligation of the Presbyterian&#x27;s Westminster Confession and the Puritan Congregationalists&#x27; Savoy Declaration.

The General Rules of the Methodist Church similarly require &quot;attending upon all the ordinances of God&quot; including &quot;the public worship of God&quot; and prohibit &quot;profaning the day of the Lord, either by doing ordinary work therein or by buying or selling&quot;.

====Blue laws====

The law in North Dakota at one time stated: &quot;The fine for Sabbath-breaking is not less than one dollar or more than ten dollars for each offence.&quot; Other laws have been passed against Sabbath breaking, e.g., by the Puritans. First-day Sabbatarian organizations, such as the Lord&#x27;s Day Alliance in North America, as well as the Lord&#x27;s Day Observance Society in the British Isles, have mounted campaigns with support in both Canada and Britain from labour unions, with the goal of preventing secular and commercial interests from hampering freedom of worship and preventing them from exploiting workers.

<text>Commonly-cited arguments for and against the prohibition of drugs include the following:

==Efficiency==

===Arguments that drug laws are effective===
Supporters of prohibition claim that drug laws have a successful track record suppressing illicit drug use since they were introduced in the 1910s. The licit drug alcohol has current (last 12 months) user rates as high as 80–90% in populations over 14 years of age, and tobacco has historically had current use rates up to 60% of adult populations, yet the percentages currently using illicit drugs in OECD countries are generally below 1% of the population excepting cannabis where most are between 3% and 10%, with six countries between 11% and 17%.

In the 50-year period following the first 1912 international convention restricting use of opium, heroin and cocaine, the United States&#x27; use of illicit drugs other than cannabis was consistently below 0.5% of the population, with cannabis rising to 1–2% of the population between 1955 and 1965. With the advent of the counter-culture movement from the late 1950s, where illicit drug use was promoted as mind-expanding and relatively harmless, illicit drug use rose sharply. With illicit drug use peaking in the 1970s in the United States, the &quot;Just Say No&quot; campaign, initiated under the patronage of Nancy Reagan, coincided with recent (past month) illicit drug use decreases from 14.1% in 1979 to 5.8% in 1992, a drop of 60%.

In March, 2007, Antonio Maria Costa, former executive director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, drew attention to the drug policy of Sweden, arguing:

In Europe as of 2007, Sweden spends the second highest percentage of GDP, after the Netherlands, on drug control. The UNODC argues that when Sweden reduced spending on education and rehabilitation in the 1990s in a context of higher youth unemployment and declining GDP growth, illicit drug use rose but restoring expenditure from 2002 again sharply decreased drug use as student surveys indicate. In 1998, a poll run by SIFO of 1,000 Swedes found that 96% wanted stronger action by government to stop drug abuse, and 95% wanted drug use to remain illegal.

Criticizing governments that have relaxed their drug laws, Antonio Maria Costa, speaking in Washington before the launch of the World Drug Report in June 2006, said:

===Arguments that drug laws are ineffective===
One of the prominent early critics of prohibition in the United States was August Vollmer, founder of the School of Criminology at University of California, Irvine and former president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police. In his 1936 book &quot;The Police and Modern Society&quot;, he stated his opinion that:

Stephen Rolles, writing in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; in 2010, argues:

These conclusions have been reached by a succession of committees and reports including, in the United Kingdom alone, the Police Foundation, the Home Affairs Select Committee, the Prime Minister&#x27;s Strategy Unit, the Royal Society of Arts, and the UK Drug Policy Consortium. The United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime has also acknowledged the many &quot;unintended negative consequences&quot; of drug enforcement.

The editor of the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot;, Dr. Fiona Godlee, gave her personal support to Rolles&#x27; call for decriminalisation, and the arguments drew particular support from Sir Ian Gilmore, former president of the Royal College of Physicians, who said we should be treating drugs &quot;as a health issue rather than criminalising people&quot; and &quot;this could drastically reduce crime and improve health&quot;.

Danny Kushlik, head of external affairs at Transform, said the intervention of senior medical professionals was significant. He said: &quot;Sir Ian&#x27;s statement is yet another nail in prohibition&#x27;s coffin. The Hippocratic oath says: &#x27;First, do no harm&#x27;. Physicians are duty bound to speak out if the outcomes show that prohibition causes more harm than it reduces.&quot;

Nicholas Green, chairman of the Bar Council, made comments in a report in the profession&#x27;s magazine, in which he said that drug-related crime costs the UK economy about £13bn a year and that there was growing evidence that decriminalisation could free up police resources, reduce crime and recidivism and improve public health.

A 2006 report sponsored by the New York County Lawyers&#x27; Association, one of the largest local bar associations in the United States, argues on the subject of US drug policy:

In response to claims that prohibition can work, as argued by Antonio Maria Costa, executive director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, who drew attention to the drug policy of Sweden, Henrik Tham has written in 1998 that sometimes it&#x27;s domestically important to stress drug policy as successful; in the case of Sweden, where this notion is important, such claims serve &quot;the function of strengthening a threatened national identity in a situation where the traditional &#x27;Swedish model&#x27; has come under increasingly hard attack from both inside and outside the country.&quot; Tham questions the success of the Swedish model – &quot;The shift in Swedish drug policy since around 1980&quot; ...(more difficult to receive &quot;nolle prosequi&quot; for minor drug crimes) ...&quot;towards a more strict model has according to the official point of view been successful by comparison with the earlier, more lenient drug policy. However, available systematic indicators show that the prevalence of drug use has increased since around 1980, that the decrease in drug incidence was particularly marked during the 1970s and that some indicators point towards an increase during the 1990s.&quot;

Leif Lenke and Börje Olsson from Stockholm University have conducted research that showed how drug use have followed the youth unemployment in close correlation. They noted that unlike most of Europe, Sweden did not have widespread and lingering youth unemployment until the early 1990s financial crisis, suggesting that unattractive future prospects may contribute to the increase in drug use among the young. CAN, the Swedish Council for Information on Alcohol and Other Drugs, 2009 report stated that the increase in drug use have continued since the 1990s with a slight dip in the mid-2000.

The professor emeritus in criminology at the University of Oslo, Nils Christie, pointed out Sweden as the hawk of international drug policy in a 2004 book. He said that Sweden is serving the role of being welfare alibi for, and lending legitimacy to, the US drug war. Adding that USA and Sweden have had an extraordinary influence on UNODC as the biggest donor countries. Sweden was the second biggest donor financing 8% of the UNODC budget behind the European Commission in 2006, followed by the US. In 2007 and 2008 Sweden was the fourth biggest donor, behind the European Commission, USA and Canada. In 2009 it was the third, as USA withdrew some of its funding.

A 2009 editorial in &quot;The Economist&quot; argued: 

Antonio Maria Costa&#x27;s conviction that &quot;countries have the drug problem they deserve&quot; if they fail to follow the &quot;Swedish Model&quot; in drug control has also been criticised in Peter Cohen&#x27;s work – &quot;Looking at the UN, smelling a rat&quot;.

In its 2011 report, the Global Commission on Drug Policy stated that &quot;The global war on drugs has failed, with devastating consequences for individuals and societies around the world&quot;.

==Deterrence==

===Arguments that prohibition discourages drug use===
A 2001 Australian study, of 18- to 29-year-olds by the NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research suggests that prohibition deters illicit drug use. 29% of those who had never used cannabis cited the illegality of the substance as their reason for never using the drug, while 19% of those who had ceased use of cannabis cited its illegality as their reason.

Gil Kerlikowske, director of the US ONDCP argued,

The DEA argues &quot;Legalization has been tried before—and failed miserably. Alaska&#x27;s experiment with legalization in the 1970s led to the state&#x27;s teens using marijuana at more than twice the rate of other youths nationally. This led Alaska&#x27;s residents to vote to re-criminalize marijuana in 1990.&quot;

Drug Free Australia has cited the Netherlands as an example of drug policy failure because it is soft in approach. They argue that the Dutch idea of going soft on cannabis dealers, thereby creating a &quot;separation of markets&quot; from hard drug dealers has failed to stem the initiation to drugs such as heroin, cocaine, and amphetamines, saying that, in 1998, the Netherlands had the third highest cannabis and cocaine use in Europe. According to Barry McCaffrey of the US Office of National Drug Control Policy, Dutch tolerance has allowed the Netherlands to become a criminal epicentre for illicit synthetic drug manufacture, particularly ecstasy, as well as the home for production and worldwide export of strains of cannabis with THC reportedly 10 times higher than normal. Gil Kerlikowske has attested that, where there were once thousands of cannabis cafés there are now only several hundred. Levels of cannabis use, in 2005 only marginally higher than in 1998, while other European countries have accelerated past them, are more likely, Drug Free Australia argues, the result of a growing intolerance of cannabis in the Netherlands rather than a growing tolerance. Drug Free Australia has also argued that British reductions in cannabis use after softer legislation may be more so the result of heavy UK media exposure of the stronger evidence of links between cannabis and psychosis.

===Arguments that prohibition does not discourage drug use===
It has been suggested that drug law reform could reduce the use of hard drugs as it has in countries such as the Netherlands. According to a 2009 annual report by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, the Dutch are among the lowest users of marijuana or cannabis in Europe, despite the Netherlands&#x27; policy on soft drugs being one of the most liberal in Europe, allowing for the sale of marijuana at &quot;coffee shops&quot;, which the Dutch have allowed to operate for decades, and possession of less than .

British Crime Survey statistics indicated that the proportion of 16- to 24-year-olds using cannabis decreased from 28% a decade ago to 21%, with its declining popularity accelerating after the decision to downgrade the drug to class C was announced in January 2004. The BCS figures, published in October 2007, showed that the proportion of frequent users in the 16–24 age group (i.e. who were using cannabis more than once a month), fell from 12% to 8% in the past four years.

American teenagers are drinking and smoking less and doing fewer drugs than their predecessors in more than 40 years of tracking. Use of marijuana is down among 8th- and 10th-graders, though it is flat among high school seniors, according to the annual Monitoring the Future survey of American teens.

A 2008 scholarly study found that intensified enforcement of marijuana laws does not achieve the stated goals of
marijuana prohibition and that &quot;decriminalizing marijuana possession or deprioritizing marijuana law enforcement does not appear to increase marijuana use&quot;.

==Gateway drug theory==
===Arguments that cannabis is a gateway drug===
The US Drug Enforcement Agency&#x27;s &quot;2008 Marijuana Sourcebook&quot; argues that recent research supports the gateway hypothesis that certain drugs (such as cannabis) act as gateways to use of &#x27;harder&#x27; drugs such as heroin, either because of social contact or because of an increasing search for a better high. Proponents cite studies such as that of 311 same sex twins, where only one twin smoked cannabis before age 17, and where such early cannabis smokers were five times more likely than their twin to move on to harder drugs.

===Arguments that cannabis is not a gateway drug===
In the &quot;American Journal of Public Health&quot;, Andrew Golub and Bruce Johnson of the National Development and Research Institute in New York wrote that young people who smoked marijuana in the generations before and after the baby boomers did not appear to be likely to move on to harder drugs.

Researchers from the independent Rand Drug Policy Research Center in Santa Monica, California, looking at data from the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse between 1982 and 1994, concluded that teenagers who took hard drugs did so whether they had first tried cannabis or not.

A twin study (of 510 same sex twin pairs) which adjusted for additional confounders such as peer drug use, found that cannabis use and associations with later hard drug use existed only for non-identical twins. The study suggested that a causal role of cannabis use in later hard drug usage is minimal, if it exists at all, and that cannabis use and hard drug use share the same influencing factors such as genetics and environment.

==Health==

===Health arguments for drug laws===
Advocates of prohibition argue that particular drugs should be illegal because they are harmful. Drug Free Australia for example argues &quot;That illicit drugs are inherently harmful substances is attested by the very nomenclature of the &#x27;harm reduction&#x27; movement.&quot; The U.S. government has argued that illegal drugs are &quot;far more deadly than alcohol&quot; saying &quot;although alcohol is used by seven times as many people as drugs, the number of deaths induced by those substances is not far apart. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), during 2000, there were 15,852 drug-induced deaths; only slightly less than the 18,539 alcohol-induced deaths.&quot; Ratios of the harms of illicit opiates to licit alcohol and tobacco in Australia are similar, with 2 deaths per hundred opiate users per annum versus 0.22 deaths per hundred for alcohol (9 times less) per year and 0.3 for tobacco (7 times less).

The DEA has said:

Many of the deaths from using cannabis, other than from car accidents while intoxicated or violence and aggression, are more likely to figure in the longer term, just as with tobacco, where both nicotine overdose and cannabis overdose are extremely rare or nonexistent. While ecstasy may have lower rates of immediate mortality than some other illicits, there is a growing science on the already recognized considerable health harms of ecstasy. Drug Free Australia argues that distinctions between &quot;soft&quot; and &quot;hard&quot; drugs are entirely artificial, and titling cannabis &quot;soft&quot; or ecstasy &quot;recreational&quot; does not lessen the extensive harms of these substances.

Gil Kerlikowske, former director of the US Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) argues that in the United States, illegal drugs already cost $180 billion a year in health care, lost productivity, crime, and other expenditures, and that number would only increase under legalization because of increased use.

Drug Free Australia claims arguments that increased health harms of illicit drugs are the result of lack of government regulation of their purity and strength are not well supported by evidence. In Australia, which has had the highest opioid mortality per capita in the OECD, studies found that &quot;overdose fatality is not a simple function of heroin dose or purity. There is no evidence of toxicity from contaminants of street heroin in Australia.&quot; Drug Free Australia claims that other causes of death such as suicide, murder and accidents are an effect of the drug themselves, not of their purity or otherwise.

====Addiction====
Drug Free Australia argues &quot;Regarding the freedom of choice of those addicted to a drug, it is important to recognize that addiction is defined as compulsive by its very nature and that addictions curb individual freedom.&quot; ... &quot;As is the case with alcohol addiction, illicit drug addictions likewise serve to keep many such users functionally in poverty and often as a continued burden on friends, family and society. Where it is argued that all disabilities are a burden on society it must be recognized that most disabilities are not the result of a choice, whereas the decision to recreationally use illicit drugs is most commonly free, and with the knowledge that they may lead to an abundance of addictions.&quot;

===Health arguments for drug law reform===

There is evidence that some illicit drugs pose comparatively fewer health dangers than certain legal drugs. The health risks of MDMA (Ecstasy) have been exaggerated for instance, the risks from cannabis use also overstated, and health problems from the use of legal substances, particularly alcohol and tobacco, are greater, even than from cocaine use for example (occasional cocaine use does not typically lead to severe or even minor physical or social problems).

====Health benefits====
A 2015 study of 135,095 U.S. adults found no significant link between lifetime psychedelic use and increased mental health problems or suicidal behavior. The researchers concluded that the prohibition of psychedelics is challenging to justify on public health grounds, given these findings.

Many trials have shown beneficial effects associated with psychoactive drug use:

* There is evidence that MDMA (ecstasy) can treat or cure post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety in cases of terminal illness.
* LSD has been widely researched as a therapeutic agent, and has shown effectiveness against alcoholism, frigidity and various other disorders. See Psychedelic therapy.
* Researchers at Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital found members of a religious group regularly using peyote scored significantly better on several measures of overall mental health than did subjects who did not use the hallucinogen.
* A 2007 study, by Santos et al. found that users of ayahuasca scored better on tests measuring anxiety and hopelessness than people who did not use the drug.

====Quality control====
According to a World Health Organisation report: &quot;As cannabis is an illegal drug its cultivation, harvesting and distribution are not subject to quality control mechanisms to ensure the reliability and safety of the product used by consumers. It is well recognised in developing countries, such as Kenya, that illicit alcohol production can result in the contamination with toxic by-products or adulterants that can kill or seriously affect the health of users. The same may be true of illicit drugs such as opiates, cocaine and amphetamine in developed societies.&quot;

The government cannot enforce quality control on products sold and manufactured illegally. Examples include: the easier to make derivative MDA being sold as MDMA, heroin users unintentionally injecting brick dust, quinine, or fentanyl with which their heroin had been cut; and heroin/cocaine overdoses occurring as a result of users not knowing exactly how much they are taking. If the supply of drugs such as ecstasy came from legitimate pharmaceutical companies, their product would be far less likely to contain toxic additives or varying dosages. This is a view supported by a number of parents whose children have died of overdoses.

The illegality of injectable drugs leads to a scarcity of needles which causes an increase in HIV infections. An easy cure to this problem, while upholding the illegality of drugs, is the Dutch policy of distributing free needles. The money spent on both increased health costs due to HIV infections and drug prohibition itself causes a drain upon society.

Studies on the effects of prescribing heroin to addicts as practiced in many European countries have shown better rates of success than any other available treatment in terms of assisting long-term users establish stable, crime-free lives. Many patients were able to find employment, some even started a family after years of homelessness and delinquency.

====Block to research====
The illegality of many recreational drugs may be dissuading research into new, more effective and perhaps safer recreational drugs, despite evidence that their use may be beneficial in certain contexts. Research on Schedule I drugs in many countries, including the United States and United Kingdom, and under international law, is tightly regulated and requires expensive and hard-to-obtain permits. Such restrictions have largely prevented investigation of their properties and therapeutic uses, and most research since the passage of the drug laws focuses on negative impacts of these drugs. For example, all known agonists of the 5HT2A receptor are psychedelics, which prevents research into this receptor.

In particular, research suggests that recreational drugs may have psychiatric applications, which many demonstrating potential for treatment-resistant mental health conditions, such as depression and anxiety. Those who support the legalisation of recreational drugs for research purposes highlight that it is unethical &quot;not&quot; to conduct research into therapeutic interventions that may have the potential to treat these conditions.

====Misleading health statistics====
The United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has suggested that illegal drugs are &quot;far more deadly than alcohol&quot;, arguing that &quot;although alcohol is used by seven times as many people as drugs, the number of deaths induced by those substances is not far apart&quot;, quoting figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), claiming &quot;during 2000, there were 15,852 drug-induced deaths; only slightly less than the 18,539 alcohol-induced deaths.&quot;

The DEA&#x27;s use of such figures is questionable however. An article in the Journal of the American Medical Association gave the number deaths caused by alcohol in year 2000 as 85,000 – over four and a half times greater than the DEA&#x27;s preferred figure. The DEA&#x27;s argument also overlooks tobacco, causing 435,000 US deaths in year 2000. And, the CDC definition of &quot;drug-induced death&quot; includes suicides using drugs, accidental overdose, and deaths from medically prescribed (not illegal) drugs. An analysis of drug-induced deaths for the 20-year period 1979–1998 found the vast majority attributable to accidental overdose, and suicide by drug taking, which together account for about 76 percent of all such deaths. Taking into account deaths from non-illegal drugs leaves only 21 percent of CDC &quot;drug-induced death&quot; figures actually due to the use of &quot;illegal&quot; drugs.

Claims that cannabis is far more powerful than it used to be are also dubious, with &quot;scare figures&quot; skewed by comparing the weakest cannabis from the past with the strongest of today. Figures regarding emergency room mentions of marijuana use can be misleading too, as &quot;mention&quot; of a drug in an emergency department visit does not mean that the drug was the cause of the visit.

===Medical uses===
A document published for the non-profit advocacy organization Europe Against Drugs (EURAD) argues that &quot;one cannot vote for a medicine&quot; and that a scientific approval basis is essential. It says that EU rules set out strict criteria for the acceptance of a drug for medical use:

====Arguments against medical uses of prohibited drugs====
According to Janet D. Lapey, M.D., of Concerned Citizens For Drug Prevention, &quot; Due to a placebo effect, a patient may erroneously believe a drug is helpful when it is not. This is especially true of addictive, mind-altering drugs like marijuana. A marijuana withdrawal syndrome occurs, consisting of anxiety, depression, sleep and appetite disturbances, irritability, tremors, diaphoresis, nausea, muscle convulsions, and restlessness. Often, persons using marijuana erroneously believe that the drug is helping them combat these symptoms without realizing that actually marijuana is the cause of these effects. Therefore, when a patient anecdotally reports a drug to have medicinal value, this must be followed by objective scientific studies.&quot;

The US Drug Enforcement Administration also says:

====Arguments for medical uses of prohibited drugs====
Most of the psychoactive drugs now prohibited in modern societies have had medical uses in history. In natural plant drugs like opium, coca, cannabis, mescaline, and psilocybin, the medical history usually dates back thousands of years and through a variety of cultures.

Psychedelics such as LSD and psilocybin (the main ingredient in most hallucinogenic mushrooms) are the subject of renewed research interest because of their therapeutic potential. They could ease a variety of difficult-to-treat mental illnesses, such as chronic depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and alcohol dependency. In 2018, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted breakthrough therapy designation for psilocybin-assisted therapy for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder. In 2019, the FDA also granted breakthrough therapy designation for psilocybin therapy treating major depressive disorder more generally. MDMA (Ecstasy) has been used for cognitive enhancement in people with Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and has shown potential in treating posttraumatic stress disorder, social anxiety, and alcohol addiction.

====Lack of access to controlled medications====
Under prohibition, millions of people find it very difficult to obtain controlled medications, particularly opiate pain-relievers. The United Nations 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs requires that opiates be distributed only by medical prescription, but this is impractical in many areas.

According to the Transnational Institute, June 2008:
According to the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) and the World Health Organisation (WHO) there is now an unmet demand in opiates. Ironically, the current drug control regulations hamper access to controlled opiate medications for therapeutic use. Many patients are unable to access morphine, methadone or an equivalent opioid. Global medical morphine consumption would rise five times if countries would make morphine available at the level of the calculated need, according to a recent WHO estimate.

According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, September 2007:
Under Sierra Leone law, morphine may be handled only by a pharmacist or doctor, explained Gabriel Madiye, the hospice&#x27;s founder. But in all Sierra Leone there are only about 100 doctors — one for every 54,000 people, compared with one for every 350 in the United States... &quot;How can they say there is no demand when they don&#x27;t allow it?&quot; he [Madiye] asked. &quot;How can they be so sure that it will get out of control when they haven&#x27;t even tried it?&quot;
==Economic==

===Economic arguments for prohibitive drug laws===
The DEA argues that &quot;compared to the social costs of drug abuse and addiction—whether in taxpayer dollars or in pain and suffering—government spending on drug control is minimal.&quot;

Antonio Maria Costa, executive director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, has said: 

Gil Kerlikowske, former director of the US ONDCP, argues that legalizing drugs, then regulating and taxing their sale, would not be effective fiscally. 

Former directors of the ONDCP, John P. Walters and Barry McCaffrey have accused billionaires George Soros, Peter Lewis and John Sperling of bankrolling the pro-pot or drug legalisation movement. &quot;These people use ignorance and their overwhelming amount of money to influence the electorate&quot;, Walters said. Billionaire US financier, George Soros said in his autobiography, &quot;I would establish a strictly controlled distribution network through which I would make most drugs, excluding the most dangerous ones like crack, legally available.&quot; The drug legalization lobby&#x27;s vigorous and well funded promotion in media and schools of a &quot;safe use of illegal drugs&quot; message
indicates that drug prohibition is in the midst of a pitched battle waged by those who are accepting not only of the drug user but who also strongly promote an acceptance of drug use itself.

====Prohibition of hemp industry====
Opposition to the legalization of hemp, which uses plants of the cannabis genus for commercial purposes, centres on the fact that those wanting to legalize the use of cannabis for recreational and medical purposes themselves present it as their Trojan horse for that very purpose:

In a &quot;Huffington Post&quot; interview, Mark Kleiman, the &quot;Pot Czar&quot; of Washington state, said he was concerned that the National Cannabis Industry Association would favor profits over public health. He also said that it could become a predatory body like the lobbying arms of the tobacco and alcohol industries. Kleiman said: &quot;The fact that the National Cannabis Industry Association has hired itself a K Street suit [lobbyist] is not a good sign.&quot;

===Economic arguments for drug law reform===
The United States efforts at drug prohibition started out with a $350 million budget in 1971, and was in 2006 a $30 billion campaign. These numbers only include &quot;direct&quot; prohibition enforcement expenditures, and as such only represent &quot;part&quot; of the total cost of prohibition. This $30 billion figure rises dramatically once other issues, such as the economic impact of holding 400,000 prisoners on prohibition violations, are factored in.

The war on drugs is extremely costly to such societies that outlaw drugs in terms of taxpayer money, lives, productivity, the inability of law enforcement to pursue &quot;mala in se&quot; crimes, and social inequality. Some proponents of decriminalization say that the financial and social costs of drug law enforcement far exceed the damages that the drugs themselves cause. For instance, in 1999, close to 60,000 prisoners (3.3% of the total incarcerated population) convicted of violating marijuana laws were behind bars at a cost to taxpayers of some $1.2 billion per year. In 1980, the total jail and prison population was 540,000, about one-quarter the size it is today. Drug offenders accounted for 6% of all prisoners. According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, drug offenders now account for nearly 51%.

It has been argued that if the US government legalised marijuana it would save $7.7 billion per year in expenditure on enforcement of prohibition. Also, that marijuana legalization would yield tax revenue of $2.4 billion annually if it were taxed like all other goods and $6.2 billion annually if it were taxed at rates comparable to those on alcohol and tobacco.

According to a 2018 report, legalising cannabis in the United Kingdom could raise between 1 and 3.5 billion pounds in tax and lead to savings for the police and the criminal justice system. It has been argued that the raised tax revenue could then be invested in public services, such as the budget of the National Health Service (NHS).

====The creation of drug cartels====
Mass arrests of local growers of marijuana, for example, not only increase the price of local drugs, but lessens competition. Only major retailers that can handle massive shipments, have their own small fleet of aircraft, troops to defend the caravans and other sophisticated methods of eluding the police (such as lawyers), can survive by this regulation of the free market by the government
====Effect on producer countries====
The United States&#x27; &quot;War on Drugs&quot; has added considerably to the political instability in South America. The huge profits to be made from cocaine and other South American-grown drugs are largely because they are illegal in the wealthy neighbouring nation. This drives people in the relatively poor countries of Colombia, Peru, Bolivia and Brazil to break their own laws in organising the cultivation, preparation and trafficking of cocaine to the States. This has allowed criminal, paramilitary and guerrilla groups to reap huge profits, exacerbating already serious law-and-order and political problems. Within Bolivia, the political rise of former president Evo Morales was directly related to his grassroots movement against US-sponsored coca-eradication and criminalization policies. However, coca has been cultivated for centuries in the Andes. Among their various legitimate uses, coca leaves are chewed for their mild stimulant &amp; appetite suppression effects, and steeped as a tea which is known to reduce the effects of human altitude sickness. Rural farmers in the poor regions in which coca has historically been cultivated often find themselves at the difficult and potentially violent intersection of government-sponsored eradication efforts, illegal cocaine producers &amp; traffickers seeking coca supplies, anti-government paramilitary forces trafficking in cocaine as a source of revolutionary funding, and the historical hardships of rural subsistence farming (or its typical alternative – abandoning their land and fleeing to an urban slum). In some regions, farmers&#x27; coca and other crops are frequently destroyed by U.S.-sponsored eradication treatments (usually sprayed from the air with varying degrees of discrimination), whether or not the farmers directly supply the cocaine trade, thereby destroying their livelihoods. Agricultural producers in these countries are pushed further to grow coca for the cocaine trade by the dumping of subsidised farming products (fruit, vegetables, grain etc.) produced by Western countries (predominantly US and EU agricultural surpluses) (see BBC reference, below), which reduces the prices they could otherwise receive for alternate crops such as maize. The net effect can be a depression of prices for all crops, which can both make the farmer&#x27;s livelihood more precarious, and make the cocaine producers&#x27; coca supplies cheaper.

After providing a significant portion of the world&#x27;s poppy for use in heroin production, Afghanistan went from producing practically no illegal drugs in 2000 (following banning by the Taliban), to cultivating what is now as much as 90% of the world&#x27;s opium. The Taliban is currently believed to be heavily supported by the opium trade there.

Furthermore, the sale of the illegal drugs produces an influx of dollars that is outside the formal economy, and puts pressure on the currency exchange keeping the dollar low and making the export of legal products more difficult.

====Prohibition of hemp industry====

The war on drugs has resulted in the outlawing of the entire hemp industry in the United States. Hemp, which is a special cultivar of &quot;Cannabis sativa&quot;, does not have significant amounts of psychoactive (THC) substances in it, less than 1%. Without even realizing the plant had been outlawed several months prior, &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; magazine published an article in 1938 entitled &quot;The New Billion-Dollar Crop&quot; anticipating the explosion of the hemp industry with the invention of machines to help process it. Recently, governmental refusal to take advantage of taxing hemp has been a point of criticism. Hemp has a large list of potential industrial uses including textiles, paper, rope, fuel, construction materials, and biocomposites (for use in cars for example). Hemp has some drawbacks, however, one being that the long fibers in hemp are only a part of the outer bast, and this has contributed to hemp having only modest commercial success in countries (for example in Canada) where it is legal to harvest hemp.

The seed of the hemp plant is highly nutritious. Rare for a plant, it contains all essential amino acids. Rare for any food, it is a good source of alpha-linolenic acid, an omega 3 fatty acid which is deficient in most diets.

====Legalization as a job creator====
Drug legalization has the potential to create a vast array of jobs, in sectors such as: sales, distribution, transportation, growing, cultivation, production, quality assurance, regulatory bodies, advertising, scientific research and lab analysis. If certain drugs were to be sold solely at single-purpose licensed premises then construction of these stores would also help the construction industry.

A 2019 jobs count found that legalized cannabis had directly created 211,000 full-time workers in the U.S., part of a total of 296,000 in all related areas combined (as a total of states where cannabis is legal). Nick Colas at DataTrek Research said in 2019 that cannabis is the “fastest-growing labor market in the U.S.” If cannabis were to be legalized nationally across the U.S., it is estimated that it would create over one million jobs.

Before the legalization of cannabis in Canada, it was estimated that the legalization of cannabis in the country would create thousands of new jobs. However, comprehensive statistics regarding the total amount jobs created by legalized cannabis in Canada have yet to be published post legalization. Cannabis was legalized in Canada on 17 October 2018.

==Crime, terrorism and social order==

===Arguments for prohibitive drug laws===
While concerns are sometimes expressed that the &quot;war on drugs&quot; can never be won, there is a failure to recognize that other justifiably costly policing wars such as &quot;blitzes&quot; on speeding can likewise never be won. Such blitzes reduce and contain speeding, as with policing of illicit drug use. Failure to police speeding drivers simply allows inordinate harm to be inflicted on other individuals. Speeding is not legalized simply because it can never be eradicated.

There is an argument that much crime and terrorism is drug related or drug funded and that prohibition should reduce this.

Former US president George W. Bush, in signing the Drug-Free Communities Act Reauthorization Bill in December 2001, said, &quot;If you quit drugs, you join the fight against terror in America.&quot;

The US Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) says that drug-related offences may include violent behavior resulting from drug effects.

The US Drug Enforcement Administration claims:

The U.S. government began the Drug Use Forecasting (DUF) program in 1987 to collect information on drug use among urban arrestees. In 1997, the National Institute of Justice expanded and reengineered the DUF study and renamed it the Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (ADAM) program. ADAM is a network of 34 research sites in select U.S. cities.

DUF research indicates that:

* Frequent use of hard drugs is one of the strongest indicators of a criminal career.
* Offenders who use drugs are among the most serious and active criminals, engaging in both property and violent crime.
* Early and persistent use of cocaine or heroin in the juvenile years is an indicator of serious, persistent criminal behavior in adulthood.
* Those arrested who are drug users are more likely than those not using drugs to be rearrested on pretrial release or fail to appear at trial.

Criminal behavior can importantly be the direct result of drug use which can cause emotional/brain damage, mental illness and anti-social behavior. Psychoactive drugs can have a powerful impact on behavior which may influence some people to commit crimes that have nothing to do with supporting the cost of their drug use. The use of drugs changes behavior and causes criminal activity because people will do things they wouldn&#x27;t do if they were rational and free of the drug&#x27;s influence. Cocaine-related paranoia is an example. If drug use increases with legalization, so will such forms of related violent crime as assaults, drugged driving, child abuse, and domestic violence.

That higher prices make the trade lucrative for criminals is recognized but countered by the argument that capitulating to illicit drug use on these grounds makes no more sense than capitulating to those who continue to traffic in human lives, a more expensive business because of its illegality and therefore more lucrative for the criminal, but necessary for the rights of vulnerable citizens.

The Office of National Drug Control Policy says that the idea that our nation&#x27;s prisons are overflowing with otherwise law-abiding people convicted for nothing more than simple possession of marijuana is a myth, &quot;an illusion conjured and aggressively perpetuated by drug advocacy groups seeking to relax or abolish America&#x27;s marijuana laws.&quot; ONDCP state that the vast majority of inmates in state and federal prison for marijuana have been found guilty of much more than simple possession. Some were convicted for drug trafficking, some for marijuana possession along with one or more other offenses. And many of those serving time for marijuana pleaded down to possession in order to avoid prosecution on much more serious charges. In the US, just 1.6 percent of the state inmate population were held for offences involving only marijuana, and less than one percent of all state prisoners (0.7 percent) were incarcerated with marijuana possession as the only charge. An even smaller fraction of state prisoners were first time offenders (0.3 percent). The numbers on the US federal prisons are similar. In 2001, the overwhelming majority of offenders sentenced for marijuana crimes were convicted for trafficking and only 63 served time for simple possession.

Detective superintendent Eva Brännmark from the Swedish National Police Board, in a speech given to Drug Free Australia&#x27;s first international conference on illicit drug use, said:

The argument that drug addicts of certain drugs are forced into crime by prohibition should first and foremost highlight the fact that this argument presupposes and underlines the addictive nature of some illicit drugs (which legalization proponents often downplay), addictive enough to create a viable criminal supply industry. Secondly, the harms of increased addictive drug use, which as previously outlined would be a consequence of legalization and its cheaper prices, far outweigh the current crime harms of prohibition. It is worth pointing out, this argument is not useful for substances such as LSD and mescaline, with no addictive properties.

Although criminal punishments vary with rooting out drug usage, it is not the foremost eradication technique to resolve substance use disorder issues. In order to combat these issues, the application of treatment and support group resources coupled with community support and understanding, has far higher long-term potential to cure the ever-growing epidemic plaguing the nation, especially in rural areas.

===Arguments for drug law reform===
In 2021, Professor Peter Singer described the War on Drugs as an expensive, ineffective and extremely harmful policy.

====Violence and profits of drugs traffickers====
Prohibition protects the drug cartel insofar as it keeps the distribution in the black market and creates the risk that makes smuggling profitable. As former federal narcotics officer Michael Levine states in relation to his undercover work with Colombian cocaine cartels, from Lamar
:&quot;I learned that not only did they not fear our war on drugs, they &quot;counted on it&quot; to increase the market price and to weed out the smaller, inefficient drug dealers. They found U.S. interdiction efforts laughable. The only U.S. action they feared was an effective demand reduction program. On one undercover tape-recorded conversation, a top cartel chief, Jorge Roman, expressed his gratitude for the drug war, calling it &quot;a sham put on for the American taxpayer&quot; that was actually &quot;good for business&quot;.

Critics of drug prohibition often cite the fact that the end of alcohol prohibition in 1933 led to immediate decreases in murders and robberies to support the argument that legalization of drugs could have similar effects. Once those involved in the narcotics trade have a legal method of settling business disputes, the number of murders and violent crime could drop. Robert W. Sweet, a federal judge, strongly agrees: &quot;The present policy of trying to prohibit the use of drugs through the use of criminal law is a mistake&quot;. When alcohol use was outlawed during prohibition, it gave rise to gang warfare and spurred the formation of some of the most well known criminals of the era, among them the infamous Al Capone. Similarly, drug dealers today resolve their disputes through violence and intimidation, something which legal drug vendors do not do. Prohibition critics also point to the fact that police are more likely to be corrupted in a system where bribe money is so available. Police corruption due to drugs is widespread enough that one pro-legalization newsletter has made it a weekly feature.

Drug money has been called a major source of income for terrorist organizations. Critics assert that legalization would remove this central source of support for terrorism. While politicians blame drug users for being a major source of financing terrorists, no clear evidence of this link has been provided. US government agencies and government officials have been caught trafficking drugs to finance US-supported terrorist actions in events such as the Iran-Contra Affair, and Manuel Noriega but the isolated nature of these events precludes them from being major sources of financing.

====Corruption====
Human rights organizations and legal scholars have claimed that drug prohibition inevitably leads to police corruption.

On 2 July 2010, former Interpol President Jackie Selebi was found guilty of corruption by the South African High Court in Johannesburg for accepting bribes worth US$156,000 from a drug trafficker. After being charged in January 2008, Selebi resigned as president of Interpol and was put on extended leave as National Police Commissioner of South Africa.

====Stigma of conviction====
Despite the fact that most drug offenders are non-violent, the stigma attached to a conviction can prevent employment and education.

Since the human brain continues to mature past age eighteen and into a person&#x27;s early twenties, it has been argued that many adult drug users will have made decisions to take drugs when their brains were not fully developed and thus they may not have adequately appreciated the risks (as many drug users are under the age of thirty). Since having a drug conviction will create societal disadvantages for the rest of a person&#x27;s life, it has been argued that drug laws do not adequately take into account the full extent of human maturity when punishing people for taking drugs.

====Children being lured into the illegal drug trade====
Janet Crist of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy mentioned that the anti-drug efforts have had &quot;no direct effect on either the price or the availability of cocaine on our streets&quot;. Additionally, drug dealers show off expensive jewellery and clothing to young children. Some of these children are interested in making fast money instead of working legitimate jobs. Drug decriminalization would remove the &quot;glamorous Al Capone-type traffickers who are role-models for the young&quot;.

The lack of government regulation and control over the lucrative illegal drug market has created a large population of unregulated drug dealers who lure many children into the illegal drug trade. The U.S. government&#x27;s most recent 2009 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) reported that nationwide over 800,000 adolescents ages 12–17 sold illegal drugs during the previous 12 months preceding the survey. The 2005 Youth Risk Behavior Survey by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that nationwide 25.4% of students had been offered, sold, or given an illegal drug by someone on school property. The prevalence of having been offered, sold, or given an illegal drug on school property ranged from 15.5% to 38.7% across state CDC surveys (median: 26.1%) and from 20.3% to 40.0% across local surveys (median: 29.4%).

Despite more than $7 billion spent annually towards arresting and prosecuting nearly 800,000 people across the country for marijuana offenses in 2005, the federally funded Monitoring the Future Survey reports about 85% of high school seniors find marijuana &quot;easy to obtain.&quot; That figure has remained virtually unchanged since 1975, never dropping below 82.7% in three decades of national surveys.

====Environmental====
With respect to drug crop cultivation, eradication efforts in line with prohibitionist drug policies ultimately force coca, poppy, and marijuana growers into more remote, ecologically sensitive areas. These crops, which are generally grown away from urban centers and state presence, tend to deplete forestland and expand the agricultural frontier. Out of fear of eradication, cultivators are incentivized to accelerate production cycles in order to obtain the highest yield in the shortest period of time; the pace and methods used by growers neglect measures to promote sustainability, exacerbating the environmental impact. Drug cultivators typically opt to produce in areas with ecosystems with abundant plant biomass to better conceal their operations. Ultimately, this practice leads to increased deforestation which contributes to a greater influx of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Moreover, the aerial spraying of herbicides such as glyphosate used in eradication and control efforts have been shown to have negative effects on environmental and human health.

The &quot;balloon effect&quot; also operates further up the drug commodity chain in countries where drugs are trafficked rather than cultivated. Like eradication programs, interdiction pushes traffickers into remote areas where they exacerbate preexisting pressures on forestland. Traffickers use slash and burn practices to convert forest into arable land for cash crop production for the purposes of money laundering as well as the construction of clandestine roads and airstrips. The war on drugs and prohibitionist policies only serve to aggravate the already detrimental impacts of narco-trafficking on Central American forests. Intensified ecological devastation across cultivation and trafficking zones is yet another negative unintended consequence of emphasis on supply-side narcotic reduction borne by poor countries.

====User cost of drugs====
When the cost of drugs increases, drug users are more likely to commit crimes in order to obtain money to buy the expensive drugs. Legalizing drugs would make drugs reasonably cheap.

==Discriminatory==

===Arguments for inconsistent drug laws===
In response to the issue of consistency with regard to drug prohibition and the dangers of alcohol former director of the ONDCP John P. Walters, has said, &quot;It&#x27;s ludicrous to say we have a great deal of problems from the use of alcohol so we should multiply that with marijuana&quot;.

===Arguments against inconsistent drug laws===
Since alcohol prohibition ended and the war on drugs began there has been much debate over the issue of consistency among legislators with regard to drug prohibition. Many anti-prohibition activists focus on the well-documented dangers of alcohol (such as alcoholism, cystitis, domestic violence, brain and liver damage). In addition to anecdotal evidence, they cite statistics to show more deaths caused by drunk driving under the influence of alcohol than by drivers under the influence of marijuana, and research which suggests that alcohol is more harmful than all but the most &quot;dangerous&quot; drugs. When the level of harm associated with the other drugs includes harm that arises solely as a result of the drugs illegality rather than merely that danger which is associated with actually using the drugs, only heroin, cocaine, barbiturates and street methadone were shown to be more harmful than the legal drug alcohol.

A 2002 DAWN report, for the USA records two possible drug-induced deaths where marijuana was the only drug found. Legal drugs however, have been the cause of more than half a million deaths a year: 480,000 from tobacco smoking-related illnesses and 80,000 from alcohol use disorder. Together, tobacco and alcohol cause about 20% of all yearly deaths in the USA.

It is argued that inconsistency between the harm caused and the legal status of these common drugs undermines the declared motives of the law enforcement agencies to reduce harm by prohibition, for example of marijuana.

In February 2009, the UK government was accused by its most senior expert drugs adviser Professor David Nutt of making political decisions with regard to drug classification, for example in rejecting the scientific advice to downgrade ecstasy from a class A drug. The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) report on ecstasy, based on a 12-month study of 4,000 academic papers, concluded that it is nowhere near as dangerous as other class A drugs such as heroin and crack cocaine, and should be downgraded to class B. The advice was not followed. Jacqui Smith, then Home Secretary, was also widely criticised by the scientific community for bullying Professor David Nutt into apologising for his comments that, in the course of a normal year, more people died from falling off horses than died from taking ecstasy. Professor Nutt was later sacked by Jacqui Smith&#x27;s successor as Home Secretary Alan Johnson; Johnson saying &quot;It is important that the government&#x27;s messages on drugs are clear and as an advisor you do nothing to undermine public understanding of them. I cannot have public confusion between scientific advice and policy and have therefore lost confidence in your ability to advise me as Chair of the ACMD.&quot;

====Consistency between drugs====
In the United States, defendants convicted of selling crack cocaine receive equal sentences to those convicted of selling 100 times the same amount of powder cocaine. This disparity was lessened during the Obama administration when the Fair Sentencing Act 2010 changed the ratio to 18 to 1. The majority of offenders convicted for selling crack are poor and/or black, while the majority of those convicted for selling cocaine are not.

====Same policy for distinct drugs====
Many drug policies group all illegal drugs into a single category. Since drugs drastically vary in their effects, addictive potential, dosages, methods of production, and consumption the arguments either way could be seen as inconsistent.

====Race and enforcement of drug laws====
It has been alleged that current drug laws are enforced in such a way as to penalize non-whites more harshly and more often than whites, and to penalize the poor of all races more harshly and more often than the middle and upper classes. For example, up until 2012, crack cocaine carried penalties one hundred times more severe than cocaine despite the fact that these drugs are essentially identical. Especially in urban black communities, convictions were nearly exclusively for crack, while cocaine use is statistically much higher among affluent whites.

==Civil rights==

===Civil rights arguments for prohibitive drug laws===
Article 33 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child reads:

:States Parties shall take all appropriate measures, including legislative, administrative, social and educational measures, to protect children from the illicit use of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances as defined in the relevant international treaties and to prevent the use of children in the illicit production and trafficking of such substances.

Drug Free Australia argues:

:The notion that illicit drug use is a victimless crime and that everyone should be free to do what they want with their body disregards the web of social interactions that constitute human existence. Affected by an individual&#x27;s illicit drug use are children, parents, grandparents, friends, colleagues, work, victims of drugged drivers, crime victims, elder abuse, sexual victims etc. Illicit drug use is no less victimless than alcoholism.

Drug Free Australia gives the example that in 2007 one in every nine children under the age of 18 in the United States lived with at least one drug dependent or drug abusing parent. 2.1 million children in the United States live with at least one parent who was dependent on or used illicit drugs.

The Christian Institute argues that there is no point in having criminal laws unless those caught breaking them will at least face prosecution. Less serious offenses, such as failing to complete a census form, may also attract a criminal record, so the contention that criminalizing drug use is draconian can be seen as overstatement.

:&quot;Parental substance dependence and abuse can have profound effects on children, including child abuse and neglect, injuries and deaths related to motor vehicle accidents, and increased odds that the children will become substance dependent or abusers themselves. Up-to-date estimates of the number of children living with substance-dependent or substance-abusing parents are needed for planning both adult treatment and prevention efforts and programs that support and protect affected children.&quot;

Drug Free Australia concludes any democratic society that deems the use of a certain drug to present unacceptable harm to the individual user, to present unacceptable harm to the users&#x27; surrounding community or to transfer too great a burden to the community will seek legislation which will curb that particular freedom of the individual.

Sweden&#x27;s centre-right alliance government Moderate Party advocates &quot;Zero tolerance for crime&quot;, arguing:
Many people argue that only drug dealers should be fought and not the drug users themselves. But this rests on the fundamental error that big-time drugs smugglers and dealers hawk illicit drugs to new consumers. This is most often not the case. Rather it is the users themselves that are mostly responsible for recruiting new users through networks of friends or relatives demonstrating that users need to be targeted as the recruiters of new drug use, and that an emphasis on early rehabilitation for young users is the best answer to curbing widespread dealing. Sweden&#x27;s mandatory rehabilitation program has resulted in the lowest drug use levels in the developed world.

The freedom of choice of those addicted to a drug is also questioned, recognizing that addiction is defined as compulsive by its very nature and that addictions in and of themselves curb individual freedom. Likewise, the proposal that addictive drugs should be legalized, regulated and opened to &quot;free market dynamics&quot; is immediately belied by the recognition that the drug market for an addict is no longer a free market – it is clear that they will pay any price when needing their drug.

===Civil rights arguments for drug law reform===

====Cognitive liberty====

Authors such as Aldous Huxley and Terence McKenna believed that what persons do in private should not be regulated by the government. It is argued that persons should be able to do whatever they want with their bodies, including the recreational use of drugs, as long as they do not harm others. Such arguments often cite the harm principle of philosopher John Stuart Mill who urged that the state had no right to intervene to prevent individuals from doing something that harmed them, if no harm was thereby done to the rest of society: &#x27;Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign&#x27; and &#x27;The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not sufficient warrant.&#x27; The argument is that drug use is a victimless crime and as such the government has no right to prohibit it or punish drug consumers, much like the government does not forbid overeating, which causes significantly more deaths per year. This can be equated with the quest for freedom of thought.

====Spiritual and religious====
Some religious groups including the &quot;União do Vegetal&quot;, the Native American Church, the Bwiti religion and the Rastafari movement (see religious and spiritual use of cannabis) use psychoactive substances as sacrament in religious rituals. In some religious practice, drugs are sometimes used as a conduit to an oceanic feeling or divine union, equated with mysticism or entheogenic (&#x27;that which causes God to be within an individual&#x27;) experiences. In others, the &#x27;entactogenic&#x27; qualities of drugs are used to enhance feelings of empathy among congregations.

====Personal development and exploration====
Some people believe that altered states of consciousness enable many people to push the boundaries of human experience, knowledge, and creativity. There is thus a moral imperative to use drugs in terms of human progress, teleological development, or just increased artistic creativity; such ideas are central to Cognitive Liberty, Stoned Ape Hypothesis and Aldous Huxley&#x27;s &quot;The Doors of Perception&quot;.

In PiHKAL, Alexander Shulgin, argues that the psychedelics help us learn about ourselves; indeed that is where the name &quot;psychedelic&quot; (mind expanding) comes from. 

==Moral and ethical reasons==

===Moral arguments for prohibitive drug laws===
===Moral arguments for drug law reform===
Many people, including some religious groups, argue that the war on drugs is itself immoral.

In 2007, Richard Brunstrom, the Chief Constable of North Wales, one of Britain&#x27;s most senior police officers, said &quot;If policy on drugs is in future to be pragmatic not moralistic, driven by ethics not dogma, then the current prohibitionist stance will have to be swept away as both unworkable and immoral, to be replaced with an evidence-based unified system (specifically including tobacco and alcohol) aimed at minimisation of harms to society.&quot;

The author and physician Andrew Weil has commented on the peculiar attitude and emotional bias of some people who think &quot;drug taking is bad&quot;, but who nevertheless consume alcohol, and formulate the unhelpful conception &quot;We drink. Therefore alcohol is not a drug.&quot;

The UK drug policy reform group Release believe that the stigma attached to drug use needs to be removed. Release&#x27;s actions have included challenging such stigmatisation with its &quot;Nice People Take Drugs&quot; advertising campaign.

==Political==

===Sending out signals===

====Arguments for sending out signals====
Some argue that sending out signals should be a consideration of drug policy. Previous UK Home Office Minister Vernon Coaker argued &quot;is not part of any system with respect to drugs ... not only trying to send messages out to people who misuse drugs but also about trying to send messages out to people out there in the community?&quot;

In response to the UK government&#x27;s official drugs advisory body&#x27;s opposition to cannabis reclassification (upwards, from a class C to a class B drug) in 2008, prime minister Gordon Brown said: &quot;I believe that if we&#x27;re sending out a signal, particularly to teenagers – and particular those at the most vulnerable age, young teenagers – that in any way we find cannabis acceptable, given all we know about the way that cannabis is being sold in this country, that is not the right thing to do. There&#x27;s a stronger case now for sending out a signal that cannabis is not only illegal, it&#x27;s unacceptable.&quot;

====Arguments against sending out signals====
The Science and Technology Select Committee appointed by the House of Commons to inquire into the Government&#x27;s handling of scientific advice, risk and evidence in policy making agreed with Transform Drug Policy Foundation&#x27;s view that &quot;Criminal law is supposed to prevent crime, not &#x27;send out&#x27; public health messages&quot;. Transform warned that sending out signals could backfire by &quot;fostering distrust of police and public health messages amongst young people&quot;. The Select Committee&#x27;s report said &quot;The Government&#x27;s desire to use the Class of a particular drug to send out a signal to potential users or dealers does not sit comfortably with the claim that the primary objective of the classification system is to categorise drugs according to the comparative harm associated with their misuse. It is also incompatible with the Government&#x27;s stated commitment to evidence based policy making since it has never undertaken research to establish the relationship between the Class of a drug and the signal sent out and there is, therefore, no evidence base on which to draw in making these policy decisions.&quot;

===Political calculation===

====Arguments for political calculation====
John Donnelly, writing for the Boston Globe on the presidential race of 2000, suggested that the candidates&#x27; silence on drug policy may stem from a widely shared belief that any position even hinting at reducing penalties for drug use would be political suicide. Charles R. Schuster, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse under Presidents Reagan and Bush (Snr.), was reported as saying in 1997, &quot;Talking sense about drug policy in today&#x27;s climate of opinion can be political suicide.&quot;

Drug policy academic Mark A.R. Kleiman has argued: 

Scott Morgan reports how he once attended a discussion of Peter Reuter and David Boyum&#x27;s book &quot;An Analytic Assessment of U.S. Drug Policy&quot;, in which the authors admitted ignoring the legalization option in their analysis. Boyum claimed that there was no legitimate political support for ending the drug war and that he and Reuter had therefore confined themselves to recommendations that they thought were politically viable.

====Arguments against political calculation====
The deaths of two teenage boys in the United Kingdom in March 2010 sparked a nationwide controversy over the amphetamine drug mephedrone, which had gained popularity as a legal high. The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) recommended a ban on the drug, which was quickly passed into law, but the decision was criticised for being politically rather than scientifically driven and led to the resignation of the ACMD&#x27;s Eric Carlin, the eighth member of the council to leave in five months in protest at what was seen as political interference. Toxicology reports released in May revealed that the boys had never taken the drug. In a later commentary, David Nutt noted that the pharmacology of mephedrone was not known at the time it was banned, and that the decision was so knee-jerk that the ACMD accidentally banned the wrong enantiomer for about a year.

Professor Colin Blakemore, professor of neuroscience at the University of Oxford, said: &quot;This shocking news should be a salutary lesson to tabloid journalists and prejudiced politicians who held a gun to the heads of the ACMD and demanded that this drug should be banned before a single autopsy had been completed ... The politicians talk about using drug classification as a way of sending &#x27;messages&#x27; to young people. I fear that the only message that will be sent by the hasty decision on mephedrone is that the drug laws deserve no respect.&quot;

Professor David Nutt, the former chairman of the ACMD, said: &quot;the previous government&#x27;s rush to ban mephedrone never had any serious scientific credibility – it looks much more like a decision based on a short-term electoral calculation. This news demonstrates why it&#x27;s so important to base drug classification on the evidence, not fear, and why the police, media and politicians should only make public pronouncements once the facts are clear.&quot;

==Public opinion==

===Public opinion on prohibitive drug laws===
A direct example of societal attitudes driving the International Drug Conventions is the 1925 speech by the Egyptian delegate M. El Guindy to the 1925 Geneva Convention forum which prohibited cannabis – largely reproduced in Willoughby, W. W.; In the late 19th and early 20th century drug use was regarded by the public &quot;as alone a habit, vice, sign of weakness or dissipation&quot;, similar to the view of those who could not control their use of the licit drug alcohol. The use of illicit drugs has been prohibited internationally since 1912, an entire century, because of international agreement that the general community has a greater right to protect itself from the harms of illicit drug use than does an individual user to use a harmful substance recreationally.

Currently there is still greater public support for the continued prohibiting of illicit drug use than there is for legalizing and regulating the use of these substances. In the United States 82% of those polled by the Family Research Association in 1998 were opposed to the legalization of heroin and cocaine in the same manner as alcohol is legal. In October 2009 a Gallup poll found that 54% of those polled were against the legalization of cannabis. In Australia, which has had the highest levels of illicit drug use in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (or OECD) countries for more than a decade, according to a 2007 survey, 95% of Australians do not support the legalization of heroin, cocaine and amphetamines, and 79% do not support the legalization of cannabis.

It can be argued that the negative attitudes to illicit drug use which issued in the international drug Conventions, with prohibitions against their use 100 years ago, still exist today. Taking again statistics from Australia, 97% disapprove of the regular use of heroin, 96% disapprove the regular use of amphetamines or cocaine, and 76.5% disapprove of the regular use of cannabis. In any democracy where &quot;the will of the people&quot; is respected by its political representatives, the prohibition of these substance might well be expected to remain intact.

===Public opinion on drug law reform===
According to Transform Drug Policy Foundation, over the past decade there has been strong shift in public opinion in favour of drug policy reform. This shift has taken place &quot;despite&quot; successive government&#x27;s reluctance to consider or debate the subject, or even call to for an independent inquiry.

A national telephone survey conducted in 1993 found that between 52% and 55% of Australians believed that growing and possessing cannabis for personal use should be legalised.

An ICM poll of 1201 people for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 1998 found that 47% believed that the illegality of drugs actually encourages young people to try them.

46% of UK adults in a 2002 Guardian poll (of 1075) felt that drug addicts who register themselves as such should have access to certain illegal drugs via prescription.

An ICM poll of 1008 UK adults (aged 16+) for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2008 found that 38% would support a scheme, similar to that established in Portugal and Spain, whereby it is not a criminal offence to possess and use drugs privately.

Following President Barack Obama&#x27;s win of the 2008 presidential election, Change.gov hosted a service on their website named the Citizen&#x27;s Briefing Book allowing United States citizens to give their opinion on the most important issues in America, and allow others to vote up or down on those ideas. The top ten ideas are to be given to Obama on the day of his inauguration, January 20, 2009. The most popular idea according to respondents was &quot;Ending Marijuana Prohibition&quot;, earning 92,970 points and obtaining a total of 3,550 comments.
The second most popular hope, by contrast, was &quot;Commit to becoming the &quot;Greenest&quot; country in the world.&quot; with 70,470 points.

Marijuana has seen a renaissance in its utopian representation in films such as the suburban satire &quot;American Beauty&quot; (1999, dir. Sam Mendes) and the stoner comedy &quot;Pineapple Express&quot; (2008, dir. David Gordon Green). Another venue for contemporary criticism of marijuana prohibition is television, such as the Showtime series &quot;Weeds&quot; (2005–2012, dev. Jenji Kohan); the HBO series &quot;True Blood&quot; (2008–2014, dev. Alan Ball); and adult animation shows such as &quot;South Park&quot;, &quot;Family Guy&quot;, and &quot;American Dad!&quot;.

David Simon, creator of the television series &quot;The Wire&quot;, in 2011 told U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder that he&#x27;d &quot;give him another season of the HBO show for an end to the war on drugs.&quot; Holder had invited show stars Wendell Pierce, Sonja Sohn, and Jim True-Frost to Washington on behalf of an anti-drug public relations campaign and at the time called on Simon and Ed Burns for another season or a movie of the show. Simon replied via a letter to a newspaper offering the trade.

In November 2020, 76 percent of voters in Washington D.C. voted in favor of the initiative to decriminalize psychedelic plants and fungi.

<text>The M117 is an air-dropped demolition bomb used by United States military forces. The weapon dates back to the Korean War of the early 1950s. Although it has a nominal weight of its actual weight, depending on fuze and retardation options, can be around . The bomb&#x27;s explosive content is typically of Tritonal or of Minol in the case of the M117A1E2 due to their higher density and detonation velocity compared to TNT. Demolition bombs rely on time delayed fuzes which allow the bomb to burrow into a building or other structure before detonating. The M117 can be configured with a conical low-drag tail for medium and high altitude deliveries or a high-drag tail fin for low-altitude drops, delaying the bombs hitting their targets ensuring bombers are out of the blast zone before detonation. The M117 was the basis for the BOLT-117, the world&#x27;s first laser-guided bomb.

==History and use==
From the 1950s through the early 1970s the M117 was a standard aircraft weapon, carried by the F-100 Super Sabre, F-104 Starfighter, F-105 Thunderchief, B-57 Canberra, F-111, F-5, A-1 Skyraider, A-4 Skyhawk and F-4 Phantom. The M117 series was used extensively during the Vietnam War, and B-52G Stratofortress aircraft dropped 44,600 M117 and M117R bombs during Operation Desert Storm.

The B-52 Stratofortress was the last American aircraft to use the bomb; tactical aircraft had mostly switched to using the Mark 80-series bombs, particularly the Mark 82 () or Mark 84 () bombs and their guided equivalents. On 26 June 2015, the last Mk 117 in PACAF inventory was dropped by a B-52H crew on an island near Andersen AFB, Guam.

In October 2023, during the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, the Israeli Air Force released images and footage showing F-16Is armed with M117 bombs, with a description suggesting that M117 bombs were used in airstrikes in the Gaza Strip. The bombs appear to be unguided, as there are no visible GPS-guided JDAM kits or laser-guidance kits installed.

==Variants==
;M117A1
* The M117A1 is essentially the same bomb as the M117 with the exception of the following components which have been removed: center lug, two spring washers utilized to hold the electrical fuzes in the nose and base and a ring receptacle lock utilized in the electrical fuze cable assembly.
;M117A1E1
;M117A1E2
* The M117A1E2 is identical to the M117A1 with the exception that the explosive filler Minol II() is used instead of Tritonal. Minol II was used in an effort to offset the shortages of TNT in the late 1960s, however, problems developed during the storage of M117 bombs filled with Minol II, especially in hot, tropical areas which caused the explosive filler to expand and ooze or extrude through the joints of the bomb. While determined safe to handle, the extruded material required maintainers to clean the bombs before transportation or usage. The U.S. Navy refused to use M117 bombs with the Minol II filler citing, &quot;Because of the proximity of crew quarters to the ships’ magazines where explosives are stored and the necessity of handling ordnance on rolling and pitching vessels, the Navy has regarded Minol II as being a potential hazard to the safety of its ships ’ crews and thus has not approved its use aboard ship.&quot;
;M117A1E3
;M117A2
;M117A3
;M117D
* &quot;The M117D (D – Destructor) looks similar to the M117R but uses a magnetic influence fuze, which enables the bomb to function as a mine. The M117D is released in a high-drag configuration for a ground implant or shallow water mining. It detonates when an object passing near the bomb triggers the fuze.&quot;
;M117R
* The M117R (R – Retarded) uses a special fin assembly providing either high-drag or low-drag release options. For low altitude deliveries, the tail assembly opens four large drag plates which rapidly slow the bomb and allow the aircraft to escape its blast.
;MC-1
* The M117 was the basis of the MC-1 chemical warfare bomb, which had the body cavity filled with sarin nerve gas. The MC-1 was never used by the U.S. in combat and was eliminated from the U.S. stockpile in June, 2006.

==Tail Assemblies==
;BSU-85/B
* Air-inflatable retarder
;BSU-93/B
* Air-inflatable retarder
;M131/M131A1
* Early low-drag conical tail assembly utilized for high-altitude bomb drops.
;MAU-91A/B
* High-drag tail assembly utilized to drastically reduce the free-fall speed of the M117 and when utilized in low-level bombing, allowed bomber aircraft sufficient time to exit the blast area before bomb detonation. M117 bombs utilizing this style tail assembly were designated M117R.
;MAU-103A/B
* Low-drag conical tail assembly which began service with the M117 in the 1970s.

<doc id="1181956" wikidata="Q5281109" url="?curid=1181956" title="Dirty Water">
<text>&quot;Dirty Water&quot; is a song by the American rock band The Standells, written by their producer Ed Cobb.
The song is a mock paean to the city of Boston, Massachusetts, and its then-famously polluted Boston Harbor and Charles River.

== History ==
According to Standells keyboardist Larry Tamblyn, at least some of the song (notably the references to &quot;lovers and thieves&quot;) was inspired by a mugging of Cobb in Boston. In addition to the river, other local interest items in the song include the Boston University women&#x27;s curfew—&quot;Frustrated women ... have to be in by 12 o&#x27;clock&quot;—and a passing mention of the Boston Strangler—&quot;have you heard about the Strangler? (I&#x27;m the man I&#x27;m the man).&quot;

==Reception ==
First issued in late 1965 on the Tower label, a subsidiary of Capitol Records, the song debuted April 30, 1966 on the &quot;Cash Box&quot; charts and peaked at No.8. It reached No.11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; singles charts on June 11. It was the band&#x27;s first major hit single; their earlier charting record, &quot;The Boy Next Door&quot;, had only reached No.102 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Bubbling Under chart in February 1966.

Although &quot;Dirty Water&quot; is beloved by the city of Boston and its sports fans, the song first became a hit in the state of Florida, breaking out on WLOF in Orlando in January 1966.

&quot;Dirty Water&quot; was also the title of the Standells&#x27; most successful LP, their only nationally charting album. This LP charted on both &quot;Billboard&quot; and &quot;Cash Box&quot; magazines&#x27; charts, peaking at No.52 and No.39, respectively, during the summer of 1966.

The song is traditionally played by Boston sports teams following home victories. The National Hockey League&#x27;s Boston Bruins began playing it in 1995, and Major League Baseball&#x27;s Boston Red Sox followed suit after home victories beginning in the 1997 season. The surviving Standells have performed the song at Fenway Park from atop the Green Monster. The famous guitar riff was recorded with a Fender Telecaster through a Vox AC30 amplifier by Standells guitarist Tony Valentino. The song is also included in the soundtrack for the film &quot;Fever Pitch&quot;, which includes the Boston Red Sox leading up to the 2004 World Series.

Starting in April 2019, Liverpool F.C., a club in the English Premier League, began playing &quot;Dirty Water&quot; after home matches, because the club is owned by Fenway Sports Group, the same owners as the Boston Red Sox.

&quot;Dirty Water&quot; was included in the influential compilation album &quot;&quot;, and is listed in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s &quot;500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll&quot;.

Though the song is credited solely to Cobb, band members Dodd, Valentino, and Tamblyn have claimed substantial material-of-fact song composition copyright contributions to it as well as contributing to its arrangement.

==Chart history==
==Covers and samples==

*British garage rock revivalists The Inmates covered &quot;Dirty Water&quot; in 1979 (and replaced Boston and the Charles with London and the River Thames), a version which was a moderate hit and reached #51 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart in January 1980. This song was promoted with customized promo versions recorded for many towns distributed to radio stations. For example, the promo copy played on Jackson, Mississippi&#x27;s WZZQ said &quot;Pearl River&quot; and &quot;Jackson you&#x27;re my home&quot;.
*The song is sampled at the beginning of &quot;These Are the Days&quot;, the first track on the Ducky Boys&#x27; 1998 album &quot;Dark Days&quot;.
*Boston punk band Dropkick Murphys often include the song in live sets, such as the one documented on 2002&#x27;s &quot;Live on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day From Boston, MA&quot; and at the 2007 and 2018 Boston Red Sox baseball World Series victory rolling parades. A version recorded with the Mighty Mighty Bosstones&#x27; Dicky Barrett was released on Fenway Recordings&#x27; 2002 compilation &quot;In Our Lifetime, Vol. 3: The Revenge of Boston&quot;.
*Icelandic indie band Singapore Sling covered it in its 2002 debut album &quot;The Curse of Singapore Sling&quot;, released in North America and Europe the following year.
*Former Red Sox pitcher Bronson Arroyo&#x27;s 2005 cover album, &quot;Covering the Bases&quot;, includes a version of the song.
*The Buffalo Sabres NHL team plays a cover version of this song before the beginning of the third period. This version substitutes River Charles with Niagara River, and Boston is replaced with Buffalo.
*&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic covered the song during his March 4, 2018 evening show at The Wilbur Theater in Boston.
*Pearl Jam covered the song during their September 4, 2018 show at Fenway Park in Boston.
*Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band have covered the song on multiple occasions while playing in Boston, most recently during their March 20, 2023 show at the TD Garden.

<doc id="1181958" wikidata="Q3612208" url="?curid=1181958" title="All You Can Eat (k.d. lang album)">
<text>All You Can Eat is the third solo album by Canadian singer k.d. lang, released in October 1995.

== Reception ==

In a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review, Barry Walters wrote &quot;The rhythms and sonic textures draw from the vintage soul of Al Green, while the stark arrangements and lush melodies embrace the primal sophistication of trend-bucking college-radio faves like Björk and PJ] Harvey without evoking either. By holding back on vocal volume and letting her creativity loose, Kathryn Dawn ultimately expresses much more. Traditional torch and twang gave her something to master and rebel against, but sublimely sensual art pop has set lang free.&quot;

David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; described the album as &quot;Ten meditations on unrequited desire, courtship, rejection, and sex, &quot;All You Can Eat&quot; is both the most brazen and conventional album she’s ever made, and one of her best. With each new album, lang has gradually toned down the often cloying cowpunk giddiness of her early work. That course continues with &quot;Eat&quot;, a sober album that musically and lyrically picks up where &quot;Ingénue&quot;‘s hit &#x27;Constant Craving&#x27; left off. The songs are a series of pleas to a lover to allow our tortured chanteuse into her life, each one highlighting varying degrees of optimism, confusion, and bleakness.&quot;

In an AllMusic review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine called it &quot;a more experimental and realized record than its predecessor &quot;Ingénue&quot;.&quot;

<doc id="1181972" wikidata="Q2333325" url="?curid=1181972" title="Templecombe">
<text>Templecombe is a village in Somerset, England, situated on the A357 road five miles south of Wincanton, east of Yeovil, and west of Salisbury. It is in the Blackmore Vale. 

Templecombe is the main settlement in the civil parish of Abbas and Templecombe, along with the hamlet of Combe Throop. Historically, Temple Combe was the southern part of the village and Abbas Combe the northern part, but in modern usage Templecombe is the common name for the whole settlement.

The parish had a population of 1,657 at the 2021 census, up from 1,560 in 2011.

==History==
Before the Norman Conquest Combe was held by Leofwine Godwinson.

Abbas Combe was recorded in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086–7 as &quot;Cumbe&quot;, when it was held by the church of St Edward, Shaftesbury.

The other manor within the parish was held by Godwinson, but after the Norman Conquest, was given to Bishop Odo of Bayeux. It was his descendant Serlo FitzOdo who granted it to the Knights Templar.

The parish was part of the Hundred of Horethorne.

Templecombe derives its name from &quot;Combe Templariorum&quot;, after the Knights Templar who established Templecombe Preceptory in the village in 1185. After they were suppressed in 1312 it was granted to the Knights Hospitaller who held it until the dissolution of the monasteries, after which it was acquired by Richard Duke (d. 1572) of Otterton, Devon. An attempt to discover &#x27;the village of the templars&#x27; was made by the &quot;Time Team&quot; television series, in a programme first shown in 1996. Late in the investigation, an old tithe map revealed the location of the Templar site, and an old stone boundary wall was found to be still standing high.

The Manor House in the high street was built in the 17th century on the site of a medieval building. Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork bought Temple Coombe Manor in 1637 for £20,000. The Earl already owned Stalbridge Manor in Dorset, close by. Boyle also purchased Annery House near Bideford in 1640 for £5000.

&quot;Somerset&quot; by G.W. Wade and J.H. Wade () states, &quot;Templecombe (or Abbas Combe), an inconsiderable village at the S.E. extremity of the county, with an important station on the S. &amp; D. and L. &amp; S.W. lines. The church is ancient but uninteresting, and seems to have been considerably altered. It contains a curious E.E. font. The tower is somewhat peculiar, and forms the S. porch. On the rising ground at the S. of the village are the remains of a preceptory of the Knights Templars, founded in the 12th century by Serlo Fitz-Odo. From this foundation the place takes its name. A long building, which was perhaps once the refectory, but which is now used as a barn, will be noticed abutting on a farm-house along the road to Milborne Port. In an orchard at the back of the farm are the ruins of a small chapel.&quot;

It was found by &quot;Time Team&quot; that the long building post-dated the preceptory, having timbers dated to ; but that the chapel, since demolished, and with only footings remaining, was authentically Templar.

Lady Theodora Guest funded the building of Templecombe&#x27;s &quot;Merthyr Guest Cottage hospital&quot; which opened in 1906. It had over 100 in-patients in 1947, when it became an NHS maternity hospital, and operated until 1974.

==Governance==
The Abbas and Templecombe parish council has responsibility for local issues.

The village is in Somerset unitary district, administered by Somerset Council. The village is part of &#x27;Blackmoor Vale&#x27; electoral division for council elections. Historically it was in Wincanton Rural District from 1894 until local government reorganisation in 1974. It was then in South Somerset district until the creation of Somerset unitary district in 2023.

It is part of the Glastonbury and Somerton constituency in the House of Commons.

==Transport==
Templecombe railway station is served by trains on the London Waterloo to Exeter St Davids West of England Main Line, originally built by the London and South Western Railway. When the village was served by the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway, trains had to reverse into Templecombe station. This unusual characteristic was shared with Limerick Junction in County Tipperary in Ireland, and also previously with Dorchester South. The station closed in 1966 due to the Beeching Axe, but re-opened due to local pressure in 1983.

==Economy==
Templecombe&#x27;s largest employer is Thales Underwater Systems, formerly Marconi Underwater Systems and Plessey Naval Systems.

The water treatment centre off Temple Lane, east of the village, is operated by Wessex Water. The original pumping station was built by the Temple Combe and Henstridge joint water committee in the 1940s.

==Education==
Abbas and Templecombe CofE Primary School is on School Lane, close to the parish church. The current building dates back to 1899, with modern extensions to the rear. The original church school was founded in 1606 and expanded over the centuries. In 1835, it was funded by the National Society and then became a voluntary controlled school from 1948.

==Religious sites==
The parish Church of St. Mary dates from the 12th century, but was largely rebuilt in the 19th century. It has been designated as a Grade II* listed building. The church contains a panel painting discovered in a local cottage which has been carbon dated to around 1280 which is believed to be linked to the period when the Knights Templar held the village. Until the dissolution of the monasteries in the 1540s, the church was under the patronage of Shaftesbury Abbey, entitling them to appoint the vicar and collect income from the parish. The church patronage or advowson was then held by the lord of the manor of Abbas Combe until it reverted to the diocese of Bath and Wells in 1931.

In Templecombe stands the United Reformed Church (next door to the former The Royal Wessex, Public House). This building has been on the site for over 150 years: the current building dates from 1834 and was originally a congregational church.

==Notable residents==
General Sir Richard McCreery (1898–1967), Chief of Staff to Field Marshal Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis, at the time of the Second Battle of El Alamein and later commanded the British Eighth Army in Northern Italy during 1944–45, died in Templecombe.

Valerie Singleton, TV presenter, lives in Templecombe.

<doc id="1181974" wikidata="Q3560381" url="?curid=1181974" title="Home invasion">
<text>A home invasion, also called a hot prowl burglary, is a sub-type of burglary (or in some jurisdictions, a separately defined crime) in which an offender unlawfully enters into a building residence while the occupants are inside. The overarching intent of a hot prowl burglary can be theft, robbery, assault, sexual assault, murder, kidnapping, or another crime, either by stealth or direct force. Hot prowl burglaries are considered especially dangerous by law enforcement because of the potential for a violent confrontation between the occupant and the offender.

==Historiography==
The first published use of the term &quot;home invasion&quot; recorded in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; is an article in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; on 1 February 1912, with an article in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; on 18 March 1925 clearly indicating the modern meaning.

&quot;Home-invasion robberies&quot; were highlighted in June 1995, when the term appeared in the cover story of &quot;The FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin&quot; in an article written by Police Chief James T. Hurley of the Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, area, later republished on bNet, the online blog posted by Harvard Business School. Hurley posited that, at the time, the crime could be considered an alternative to bank or convenience store robberies, which were becoming more difficult to carry out due to technological advances in security. In the same article, Hurley recommended educating the public about home invasion. Before the term &quot;home invasion&quot; came into use, the term &quot;hot burglary&quot; was often used in the literature. Early references also use &quot;burglary of occupied homes&quot; and &quot;burglar striking an occupied residence.&quot;

In 2008 Connecticut Congressman Chris Murphy proposed making home invasion a federal crime in the United States.

Home invasion differs from burglary in that its perpetrators have a violent intent apart from the unlawful entry itself, specific or general, much the same way as aggravated robbery—personally taking from someone by force—is differentiated from mere larceny (theft alone).

===Under US law===
In some jurisdictions, there is a defined crime of home invasion; in others, there is no crime defined as home invasion, but events that accompany the invasion are charged as crimes. Where home invasion is defined, the definition and punishments vary by jurisdiction. It is not a legally defined federal offense throughout the United States, but is in several states, such as Georgia, Michigan, Connecticut, Illinois, Florida, Texas, Louisiana, and Nevada. Home invasion laws also have been introduced in the South Carolina General Assembly and in the State of Maryland. On March 15, 2011, a bill making home invasion deaths a capital crime in New Hampshire passed the New Hampshire House without debate.

Many U.S. states (particularly those that endorse the castle doctrine) include defending oneself against forcible entry of one&#x27;s home as part of their definition of justifiable homicide without any obligation to retreat.

===Other jurisdictions===
Home invasion as such is not defined as a crime in most countries other than the US, with offenders being charged according to the actual crimes committed once inside the building, such as armed robbery, rape or murder.

In English law, offenders who commit burglary while carrying a weapon can be convicted of the offence of aggravated burglary even if the weapon is not actually brandished or used.

In Canada, section 348 of the Criminal Code provides that home invasion can be considered an aggravating circumstance in cases of
* Breaking and entering to steal firearm
* forcible confinement
* robbery
* break-and-enter with intent
* extortion

==Notable examples==

The Lindbergh Kidnapping – In 1932, one-year-old Charles Augustus Lindbergh, Jr. was kidnapped from his family&#x27;s home in East Amwell, New Jersey and later murdered. The offender perpetrated the crime by using a ladder to enter a second floor bedroom of the Lindbergh residence while the family was asleep.

The &quot;Chauffeurs de la Drôme&quot; (The Heaters of Drôme) were a gang of four men who carried out a series of attacks on remote dwellings in the Department of Drôme in south-west France between 1905 and 1908. They became notorious for roasting the feet of householders against the fireplace, to torture them into revealing the hiding places of valuables. Responsible for as many as 18 murders, three of the gang were executed on September 22, 1909. The fourth died on the penal colony on Devil&#x27;s Island.

One well-known home invasion is the November 15, 1959, quadruple murder of the Clutter family by Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Hickock and Perry Edward Smith during a home-invasion robbery in rural Holcomb, Kansas. The murders were detailed in Truman Capote&#x27;s &quot;nonfiction novel&quot; &quot;In Cold Blood&quot;. However, the perpetrators were convicted of murder, not home invasion.

The BTK Killer – Between 1974 and 1991, a series of sexual assaults and murders was carried out in the Wichita, Kansas area. In most of the attacks, the offender broke into or forced his way into a residence, then killed one or more people.

Joseph James DeAngelo – A serial killer and rapist who was active in California in the 1970s and 1980s, who is known to have murdered thirteen people between 1975 and 1986. His modus operandi was to break into the homes of his victims in the middle of the night and attack them as they slept.

The Night Stalker – A series of home invasion murders, rapes, and robberies plagued the Los Angeles, California area in the mid-1980s. In all, twelve murders were committed in southern California as part of this series.

Mr Cruel – An Australian paedophilic serial rapist who entered houses and attacked three girls in the northern and eastern suburbs of Melbourne, Victoria in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

Wichita Massacre – brothers Jonathan and Reginald Carr entered a house in December 2000, robbed the five residents, forced them into sex with each other and the attackers and then drove them to a snowy soccer field to be shot execution-style. One woman survived and testified against them in court, where they were given the death penalty.

Two paroled criminals were each charged with three counts of capital murder during a home invasion into the Petit family home in Cheshire, Connecticut, on July 23, 2007. During the invasion, the mother died of asphyxiation due to strangulation and the two daughters died of smoke inhalation after the suspects set the house on fire. The men were charged with first-degree sexual assault, murder of a kidnapped person, and murder of two or more people at the same time. The state attorney sought the death penalty against the suspects. The first defendant, Steven Hayes, was found guilty of 16 of 17 counts including capital murder on October 5, 2010, and on November 8, 2010, was sentenced to death. His co-defendant, Joshua Komisarjevsky, was convicted of all 17 counts against him in October 2011, and was also sentenced to death. Both men later had their sentences commuted to life without parole when Connecticut abolished the death penalty in 2015.

Another home invasion occurred on November 26, 2007, when Washington Redskins star Sean Taylor was murdered during an overnight home invasion of his suburban Miami home. Five men were convicted of the crime and given sentences ranging from 18 years to life imprisonment.

In December 2015, a man gained entry to a house in the Swiss town of Rupperswil. After forcing the mother to get him money, he raped her 13-year-old son and then murdered them and another son and his girlfriend, before setting the house ablaze. The man was convicted in 2018 of murder and other crimes and sentenced to life in prison.

Three men in Louisville, Kentucky were charged for the April 20, 2017 home invasion at Mallard Crossing of record producer Jonathan Hay and his teenage daughter.

Four people have been charged in the home invasion of Pop Smoke, who was murdered during the robbery in Hollywood Hills on February 19, 2020.

Various tones of &quot;orchid&quot; may range from grayish purple to purplish-pink to strong reddish purple.

The first recorded use of &quot;orchid&quot; as a color name in English was in 1915.

In 1987, orchid was included as one of the X11 colors. After the invention of the World Wide Web in 1991, these became known as the X11 web colors.
== Derivation ==
The name originates from the flowers of some species of the vast orchid family (Orchidaceae), such as &quot;Laelia furfuracea&quot; and &quot;Ascocentrum pusillum&quot;, which have petals of this color.The word &quot;Orchid&quot; derives from the Greek word &quot;orchis&quot; which means testicle, after the appearance of the tubers of plants of the genus &quot;Orchis&quot;.

<doc id="1181987" wikidata="Q958040" url="?curid=1181987" title="Hughie Gallacher">
<text>Hugh Kilpatrick Gallacher (2 February 1903 – 11 June 1957) was a Scottish football player in the 1920s and 1930s. In 597 senior club games, Gallacher scored 419 goals, playing league football for Airdrieonians, Newcastle United, Chelsea, Derby County, Notts County, Grimsby Town and Gateshead. Prior to this he also played and scored for then non-league Queen of the South.

He is one of the Scotland national football team&#x27;s most prolific goalscorers with 24 goals from his 20 internationals, a strike rate of more than a goal a game. Gallacher was one of the Wembley Wizards who beat England 5–1 at Wembley Stadium in 1928.

== Early and personal life ==
Gallacher was born in Bellshill, Lanarkshire in 1903. He started &quot;biffing a twopenny ball&quot; almost as soon as he could walk. He began a long friendship with Alex James when both were students at Bellshill Academy.

His Irish father had moved to Scotland in search of work in the vast coal mining areas the country had to offer. He soon settled and married a local woman, raising a family with a strict Protestant upbringing. This didn&#x27;t stop the diminutive Gallacher son from having Catholic friends.

He had been down the Hattonrig Pit at the age of 15, working 10-hour shifts. Aged 16, he left Lanarkshire junior league side Tannochside Athletic to join Hattonrigg Thistle. However fate played a part in his next move up the football ladder. As a spectator he attended to watch Bellshill Athletic (who had previously rejected Gallacher and James for being too small) playing St Mirren Juniors. Bellshill were a man short and Gallacher was asked to play. After hitting his side&#x27;s goal in the 1–1 draw, he was asked to join the club.

He was barely 17 when he met and married Annie McIlvaney, a girl who worked at the pit where he worked as a miner. The marriage broke up within a few years, although Annie refused to grant Hughie a divorce. Their dispute generated large legal fees, which contributed to his bankruptcy. 
During his early life Hughie had three children; Hughie (Jr), who died before his first birthday, Catherine (both to Annie McIllvaney) and Jackie Gallacher, who scored prolifically for Celtic in the 1940s.

Soon after he moved to Newcastle in 1925, Hughie met and fell in love with Hannah Anderson, a 17-year-old daughter of the landlord of one of his favourite pubs. They married soon after he divorced from Annie, and they had three sons.

==Club career==
===Queen of the South===
In December 1920, Gallacher was picked for the Glasgow Junior League XI to play against the Irish Intermediate League XI at Shawfield. Gallacher hit the Glasgow equaliser with a fine header with two minutes remaining in the 1–1 draw. Among those at the game was James Jolly, secretary of Dumfries club Queen of the South.

Jolly approached Gallacher after the game and offered him a trial at Queens, with the prospect of a £30 signing-on fee and £5 per week plus expenses should he do well in the trial. At the time Queens were in their second season after formation and, cup games aside, played only local fixtures. However it was professional football and that was good enough for Gallacher. His name on the team sheet replaced Ian Dickson who was on his way to Aston Villa (they were two of the four players to play in Queens&#x27; first three seasons before moving on to successful careers in England&#x27;s top division, the others being Dave Halliday and Willie Ferguson).

Rejecting the opportunity of an international trial game at Methil, Gallacher made his Queen of the South debut aged 17 against St Cuthbert Wanderers on 29 January 1921. He scored four goals in a 7–0 victory. &quot;The Herald and Courier&quot; wrote after the game, &quot;Gallacher was the pick of the front line. He is only a young player but knows all that is required of him in the centre. He gathers the ball to perfection and possesses a first time shot of a deadly nature. His four goals were all well taken and it was not his fault that he did not have more&quot;. The contract was waiting for Gallacher after the game.

Gallacher&#x27;s next game was his senior debut, a Scottish Cup second round tie against Nithsdale Wanderers. Queens lost 3–1. In the 5–2 victory over Dumbarton, the Herald and Courier said of Gallacher, &quot;From the first kick until the last, he showed exceptional dash and had the unusual record of scoring all five goals. He was continuously the source of great danger and showed no mercy with his rocket shooting&quot;.

While enjoying a holiday in Dumfries, Gallacher took ill with double pneumonia. Doctors believed that he would never play football again, but a week later he was said to be recovering well. While in Dumfries Infirmary he was approached by directors of Airdrieonians who had noted his performance in a recent challenge game. At this time if a player was not playing league football at any time then he was free to sign for whoever offered a contract. Airdrie offered a contract and Gallacher signed without a second thought.

In his nine games for Queens Gallacher hit 19 goals, with the game against Hawick on 13 April 1921 being his last. He however returned to Palmerston Park many times to play in and referee charity matches. He was also among the jubilant crowd who watched Queens win in their 1929–30 season-ending 2–1 Charity Cup final win against Mid-Annandale.

===Airdrieonians===
Gallacher moved back to North Lanarkshire with a transfer to Airdrieonians. On 19 September 1921 he made his senior Scottish Football League debut in a 2–0 defeat to Raith Rovers. Gallacher was selected for the first team 15 times that season and hit seven goals. He also helped Airdrie reserves to the Second XI Cup. The following season he became a first team mainstay as the club finished second. The next season they finished second again, with Gallacher hitting five in a 6–1 win over Clyde that briefly had the &quot;Diamonds&quot; top of the league. Silverware arrived when Airdrie beat Hibernian 2–0 in the 1924 Scottish Cup Final to claim the club&#x27;s first senior trophy. In 1925–26 Airdrie had their third straight second place league finish; Gallacher was credited with 35 goals.

Gallacher was only 5 ft 5 ins tall and was often on the receiving end of rough treatment. However, because he tended to seek his own retribution, he was often in trouble with the authorities. There was much speculation about a number of English clubs that were out to sign him. The Airdrie fans were incensed and threatened to burn the wooden stand down if he was sold. His last game for the club came on 5 December 1925 in a 2–1 defeat to Morton. In 129 games for Airdrie, he hit 100 goals.

===Newcastle United===
Newcastle United&#x27;s desperation for their new centre-forward meant that they were willing to pay £6,500 (£ today) to capture him. Gallacher signed on 8 December 1925. He made an immediate impact, scoring two goals on his debut four days after signing in the 3–3 home draw against Everton (Dixie Dean hit an Everton hat trick) and scoring 15 goals in his first nine games. He ended the season with 23 league goals in 19 games, ending up as the club&#x27;s top scorer despite signing halfway through the season.

From the very first match he played in England he was a marked man, hacked and elbowed and gouged by defenders acting on instructions to stop him scoring at all costs. One teammate described how Gallacher would sit in the dressing room, with pieces of flesh hanging from his legs and his socks and boots soaked in blood.

The following season, 1926–27, 23-year-old Gallacher was given the captaincy, and his powerful leadership qualities took Newcastle to the League Championship for the first time since 1909, although his criticism of some of the less talented players in the team did not go unnoticed. Sunderland were still in contention until they were beaten 1–0 at St James&#x27; Park on 19 March before a then record crowd of 67,211. The goalscorer was Gallacher, still widely rated today as Newcastle&#x27;s finest ever player. He scored 36 league goals in 38 appearances, still the highest number of league goals in one season by a Newcastle player.

Whilst at Newcastle United, he scored 143 league and cup goals in 174 appearances. His strike rate of over 82% is the most prolific in the club&#x27;s history.

A chant reportedly once sung at St James&#x27; Park in relation to Hughie went as follows;
:&quot;Do ye ken hughie gallacher the wee scots lad,&quot;
:&quot;The best centre forward Newcastle ever had,&quot;
:&quot;If he doesn&#x27;t score a goal then wu&#x27;ll put him on the dole,&quot;
:&quot;and wu&#x27;ll send him back to Scotland where he came from.&quot;

===Chelsea===
Gallacher joined David Calderhead&#x27;s Chelsea as part of a £25,000 spending spree which also saw the club sign his fellow Scottish forwards Alex Jackson and Alec Cheyne; such was his popularity at Newcastle, when Chelsea visited St James&#x27; Park, the home of Newcastle United, that season the attendance was a record 68,386 with several thousand more locked out. Gallacher scored 81 goals in 144 games and was Chelsea&#x27;s top scorer in each of his four seasons in west London. The team sometimes clicked, such as in a 6–2 win over Manchester United and a 5–0 win over Sunderland but trophies remained elusive.

The FA Cup was to be the closest the club came to silverware. In 1932, the team secured impressive wins over Liverpool and Sheffield Wednesday, and were drawn against Newcastle United in the semi-finals. Tommy Lang inspired Newcastle to a 2–0 lead, before Gallacher pulled one back for Chelsea. The Blues laid siege to the United goal in the second half, but were unable to make a breakthrough and the Geordies went on to lift the trophy.

Gallacher&#x27;s time there was also marred by suspensions for indiscipline – including a two-month ban for swearing at a referee – and off-pitch controversies. In 1934 he ended up in the bankruptcy court due to a prolonged and acrimonious divorce.

===Later career===
Gallacher was transferred to Derby County in November 1934 for £2,750. He was taken under the wing of fellow Scotsmen Dally Duncan and an old Newcastle United friend, Jimmy Boyd, and was said to have been as good as gold during his Baseball Ground days. His 38 goals in 51 league games helped Derby finish second in the league to Sunderland in 1935–36, a finish the club have surpassed only twice (both times in the 1970s under the influence of Brian Clough and Dave Mackay). Gallacher hit 40 goals in his 55 games for Derby. Later in 1941, when the club were investigated by the F.A. over suspected financial irregularities, one of the accusations was that manager George Jobey had paid Gallacher illegal signing-on fees. The player refused to admit it, but Jobey, manager of the &quot;Rams&quot; since 1925, received a ten-year suspension for his part in the scandal.

The following season, 1936, he moved to Notts County for £2,000. His impressive 32 goals in 45 games helped County to a second-place finish in England&#x27;s third division. In January 1938 he moved to Grimsby Town for £1,000, hitting three goals in his 12 games.

Later in 1938, Gateshead, a modest team languishing in the bottom division, paid £500 for him. &quot;It&#x27;s grand to be back on Tyneside,&quot; said an emotional Gallacher, when he climbed off the train. &quot;My heart has been here ever since I left United eight years ago. I intend to spend the rest of my life with my adopted folk in Gateshead.&quot; Crowds at the Gateshead ground soared to 20,000 a week. He hit 18 league goals for the club, which included a five-goal haul against Rotherham United. Whilst at Gateshead, he recorded double figures for English league goals for the 14th successive season. He retired from football with the outbreak of World War II.

==International career==
Gallacher represented Scotland 20 times, hitting 24 goals. Only two players, Denis Law and Kenny Dalglish with 30 each, have scored more goals for the full Scotland team than Gallacher, who averaged 1.2 goals per game from his 20 caps. He won his first cap on 1 March 1924 in a 2–0 victory against Ireland. Scotland won all six games when Gallacher and Alex James were both selected to play; this included the 1928 &#x27;Wembley Wizards&#x27; 5–1 defeat of England when James netted twice.

In November 1925 Gallacher hit five goals in the Scottish League&#x27;s 7–3 victory over the Irish League in Belfast. By coincidence in February 1929 he scored a record five times for Scotland in the same city and with the same final scoreline during the 1928–29 British Home Championship (having also scored three against Wales four months earlier in the same competition.)

When the Scottish FA undertook a tour Canada &amp; America in 1935, Gallacher scored ten times six matches for an unofficial Scotland XI against club &amp; representative sides.

==Retirement and death==
Gallacher continued to live in Gateshead, trying a number of careers, one of them being a sports journalist, a role that led to him being banned from St James&#x27; Park for his outspoken remarks about Newcastle United. However, he continued to be a popular character on Tyneside. He turned out in charity matches even at the age of 52. With no savings from his footballing days, he took numerous unremarkable jobs, often menial, to earn a living to support his family. His second wife died in December 1950 from heart disease.

One evening in May 1957 Gallacher&#x27;s son, Hughie Jr. (by his father&#x27;s second marriage), said in a press interview, &quot;Dad had been drinking that night when the trouble started. Up until then he had never laid a finger on Mat. But on this particular night Mat had ignored Dad and Dad had reacted. He had picked up an ashtray and threw it across the room, maybe in temper, but I&#x27;m sure only to frighten the lad. But it hit Mat on the side of the head and drew blood. Basically this had been a domestic situation that had got out of hand and it should have been left at that, but a neighbour who had come on the scene asked if she should get the police and, without thinking, I said yes. That was a stupid thing for me to do. If I&#x27;d only given myself a minute to think I wouldn&#x27;t have said it. Yes, I was upset, but I obviously wasn&#x27;t prepared for the consequences.&quot;

For weeks after the alleged assault, Gallacher began wandering the streets. Many people spoke to him including Newcastle players and staff offering support and assuring him that no one would believe the press and their scandalous statements. Many offered to speak on his behalf.

Denied access to his son and with the court appearance looming, Gallacher began to get increasingly irrational. A local reporter friend said he looked like &#x27;a traumatised man walking in a glassy-eyed dream&#x27;. Gallacher said to a friend, &quot;It&#x27;s no good fighting this thing now. They have got me on this one. My life is finished. It&#x27;s no use fighting when you know you can&#x27;t win.&quot; He was summoned to Gateshead Magistrates Court for Wednesday 12 June 1957.

On 11 June, he posted a short message to the Gateshead Coroner expressing his regrets at what he had caused, adding that &#x27;if he had lived to be 100 he would never be able to forgive himself for having hurt Mattie&#x27;. He then wandered aimlessly through the streets ignoring the greetings of several people.

On the day of his death, two young trainspotters watched him for half an hour pacing backwards and forwards on a footbridge over the London-Edinburgh railway line at Low Fell, Gateshead. He was openly weeping, talking to himself and occasionally pounding the bridge rail with his fists. He stepped down from the bridge and killed himself by walking in front of an oncoming express train. When the effects of his father&#x27;s suicide had subsided Mattie returned home to stay with his elder brother Hughie, before moving to South Africa in 1965.

==Legacy==
On 13 December 2021, a brick memorial tribute was unveiled to Gallacher at Derby County&#x27;s Pride Park Stadium. On 22 February 2023, his grandson Andy Gallacher was present to unveil a further memorial plaque at Gateshead Redheugh F.C.; both tributes were organised by author and historian Kal Singh Dhindsa. Owing to his importance in the history of Newcastle United, it was suggested on Tyneside that a similar memorial could be erected at St James&#x27; Park.

<text>New Adventures is a British dance-theatre company. Founded by choreographer Matthew Bourne in 2001, the company developed from an earlier company Adventures in Motion Pictures, now dissolved.

== History ==
Adventures in Motion Pictures (AMP) was established in 1987 by a group of students from London&#x27;s Laban Centre, including Matthew Bourne, Catherine White (now Malone), Emma Gladstone, Susan Lewis, Carrollynne Antoun, David Massingham and Keith Brazil. AMP&#x27;s productions like &quot;Spitfire&quot; (1988), parodied the manners of romantic ballet dancers.

By 1991, the original members of the company were working outside of AMP, and Bourne held auditions for new dancers, forming a company with six core dancers, including Scott Ambler (later founder artistic associate), Etta Murfitt (now associate artistic director), Ben Wright, Ally Fitzpatrick and Jamie Watton. Their first piece together was &quot;Town &amp; Country&quot; (1991). Subsequent AMP productions included &quot;Nutcracker!&quot; (1992), &quot;Highland Fling&quot; (1994), &quot;Swan Lake&quot; (1995), &quot;Cinderella&quot; (1997) and &quot;The Car Man&quot; (2000). 

In 2000, Bourne formed New Adventures with producer Robert Noble, who became co-director of the company. New Adventures Limited was incorporated in January 2001. New Adventures Charity (incorporated in 2008) is a registered charity (charity number: 1125342) that works &quot;To advance the education of young people, dance practitioners and the general public particularly but not exclusively through the provision of workshops and classes with specific but not exclusive reference to the dance choreography of Matthew Bourne&quot;.

New Adventures has been a National Portfolio Organisation receiving funding from Arts Council England since 2015.

<doc id="1182004" wikidata="Q981443" url="?curid=1182004" title="Roberto D'Aubuisson">
<text>Roberto D&#x27;Aubuisson Arrieta (; 23 August 1943 – 20 February 1992) was a Salvadoran military officer, neo-fascist politician, and death squad leader. In 1981, he co-founded and became the first leader of the far-right Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA) and served as president of the Legislative Assembly from 1982 to 1983. He was a presidential candidate for 1984 presidential election, losing in the second round to José Napoleón Duarte, the former president of the Revolutionary Government Junta.

After ARENA&#x27;s loss in the 1985 legislative elections, D&#x27;Aubuisson stepped down in favor of Alfredo Cristiani and was designated as the party&#x27;s honorary president for life. D&#x27;Aubuisson was named by the United Nations&#x27; Truth Commission for El Salvador as having ordered the assassination of Óscar Romero, the archbishop of San Salvador in 1980.

== Early life ==

Roberto D&#x27;Aubuisson Arrieta was born on 23 August 1943 in Santa Tecla, El Salvador. His father was Roberto d&#x27;Aubuisson Andrade, and his mother was Joaquina Arrieta Alvarado, a career civil servant. He is the descendant of Jacques, Marie, Germain, Gustave d&#x27;Aubuisson, who was born in Toulouse, France in 1822 and arrived in El Salvador at the age of 20, where he established himself as an ironmonger and salesman. His father, Pierre d&#x27;Aubuisson, was Marquis and Lord of Nailloux and Ramonville-Saint-Agne.

D&#x27;Aubuisson enrolled in the Captain General Gerardo Barrios Military School in 1958 at the age of 15 and graduated in 1963, becoming a member of the National Guard. He was part of La Tandona, the class of 1966 at the Captain General Gerardo Barrios Military School. In 1972, he was trained in communications at the School of the Americas, a United States Department of Defense Institute that provides military training to government personnel in US-allied Latin American nations. After completing his studies at the institute, he became a member of the Salvadoran military intelligence. D&#x27;Aubuisson was also educated at the Taiwanese Fu Hsing Kang College.

== Death squads ==


D&#x27;Aubuisson involved himself in death squad activity while in the military, and he became associated with the second death squad to emerge in El Salvador in the mid-1970s, called the White Warriors Union. In October 1979, after a group of progressive officers deposed the government of Carlos Humberto Romero in a bloodless coup d&#x27;état and established the Revolutionary Government Junta (JRG, 1979–1982), D&#x27;Aubuisson was forced out of military service for his death squad connections, although he continued working for senior military commanders secretly. D&#x27;Aubuisson was regularly featured on Salvadoran television denouncing alleged traitors and communists, who were then murdered shortly afterwards by death squads.

On 7 May 1980, six weeks after the assassination of Óscar Romero, D&#x27;Aubuisson and a group of civilians and soldiers were arrested on a farm. The raiders found weapons and documents identifying D&#x27;Aubuisson and the civilians as death squad organizers and financiers, and of planning a coup d&#x27;état to depose the JRG. D&#x27;Aubuisson was soon released from prison, after 8 of the 14 military garrison commanders voted for his release, overruling the JRG.

His opposition to the JRG gave him international infamy. In August 1981, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that D&#x27;Aubuisson &quot;openly talked of the need to kill 200,000 to 300,000 people to restore peace to El Salvador&quot;. Shortly afterwards, on September 30, he founded ARENA (Nationalist Republican Alliance), a far-right political party. D&#x27;Aubuisson accumulated much political capital among Salvadorans for his anti-leftist stridency and for his reputation as an effective counter-insurgency strategist. He often accused the JRG of being a Marxist threat to El Salvador.

He praised Hitler to West German journalists, out of belief in the Jewish Bolshevism conspiracy: &quot;You Germans were very intelligent. You realized that the Jews were responsible for the spread of Communism and you began to kill them.&quot; He also asked every Jesuit be murdered as instruments of Communism and threatened to kill James Richard Cheek, a State Department official under Carter.

== Political career ==

=== President of the Legislative Assembly ===

In the 1982 legislative election, the PDC won 40 percent of the vote but not a controlling majority in the legislature. Meanwhile, ARENA won 29 percent of the vote, the PCN won 19 percent, Democratic Action (AD) won 8 percent, and other parties won the remaining 4 percent. D&#x27;Aubuisson was among one of ARENA&#x27;s 19 deputies in the Legislative Assembly. Representing the San Salvador Department, he assumed office on 26 April 1982.

Although ARENA and the PCN were held a majority and sought to elect D&#x27;Aubuisson as the country&#x27;s president, pressure from the United States dissuaded the PCN which voted with the PDC to elect AD candidate Álvaro Magaña as the country&#x27;s president. Rather than being elected as president of El Salvador, D&#x27;Aubuisson was instead elected as the president of the Legislative Assembly, serving from 26 April 1982 to 20 December 1983. The JRG&#x27;s government ended on 2 May 1982

On 31 March 1983, D&#x27;Aubuisson was allowed entry to the United States by the State Department after deeming him not barred from entry any longer. When asked about D&#x27;Aubuisson&#x27;s association with the assassination of Archbishop Romero, the State Department responded that &quot;the allegations have not been substantiated.&quot; In November 1993, documents by the State Department, Defense Department, and the Central Intelligence Agency were released after pressure by Congress increased. The 12,000 documents revealed that the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush knew of the assassinations conducted by D&#x27;Aubuisson, including that of Oscar Romero, and still worked with him despite this.

=== 1984 presidential campaign ===

On 25 March 1984, D&#x27;Aubuisson began his campaign for the Salvadoran presidency. On 2 May he lost the presidential election to former President of the Junta José Napoleón Duarte of the Christian Democratic Party, receiving 46.4 percent of the vote to Duarte&#x27;s 53.6 percent. D&#x27;Aubuisson claimed fraud and U.S. interference on behalf of Duarte, who was later confirmed to have been a CIA asset.
In Washington D.C., a supporter of D&#x27;Aubuisson was Senator Jesse Helms, who had close ties with D&#x27;Aubuisson&#x27;s ARENA party.

Helms opposed the appointment of Thomas R. Pickering as Ambassador to El Salvador, and alleged that the CIA had interfered in the 1984 Salvadoran election in favor of Duarte, claiming that Pickering had &quot;used the cloak of diplomacy to strangle freedom in the night&quot;. A CIA operative testifying to the Senate Intelligence Committee was alleged by Helms to have admitted rigging the election, but senators who attended stated that, whilst the CIA operative admitted involvement, the person did not admit to rigging the election. Helms disclosed details of CIA financial support for Duarte, earning a rebuke from fellow senator Barry Goldwater, but Helms replied that his information came from sources in El Salvador, not the Senate committee.

In December 1984, D&#x27;Aubuisson travelled to Washington and was presented with a plaque by groups such as the American Foreign Policy Council, the Moral Majority and the Young Americans for Freedom for “continuing efforts for freedom in the face of communist aggression which is an inspiration to freedom-loving people everywhere”.

=== Deputy of the Legislative Assembly ===

In 1985, D&#x27;Aubuisson was re-elected as a deputy of the Legislative Assembly from San Salvador. In 1988, he was re-elected as a deputy of the Legislative Assembly, but instead from La Libertad. In 1991, he was re-elected as a deputy of the Legislative Assembly, again from La Libertad.

==Death==

D&#x27;Aubuisson died at 48 after a prolonged battle against esophageal cancer and bleeding ulcers on 20 February 1992.

==Commission reports==
After the Salvadoran Civil War, the United Nations Commission on the Truth for El Salvador and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights stated that D&#x27;Aubuisson &quot;gave the order to assassinate the Archbishop&quot; to military officers who also tried to kill judge Atilio Ramírez Amaya &quot;to deter investigation of the case&quot;. Views of him among contemporary Salvadorans are mixed and often drawn across party lines. ARENA supporters revere him for his right-wing beliefs and steadfast opposition to communism. FMLN supporters vilify him for his alleged human rights atrocities and involvement in Archbishop Romero&#x27;s assassination.

On January 20, 2007, President Antonio Saca of the ARENA party paid homage to D&#x27;Aubuisson upon the anniversary of his death, promising &quot;to continue the ARENA party, based upon his ideologic legacy.&quot; Amid opposition debate, ARENA tried to name D&#x27;Aubuisson a &quot;meritorious son of El Salvador&quot;, a national honor, but failed due to the efforts of protesting Church leaders and human rights workers.

He was known as &quot;Chele&quot; (light-skinned face) and was alleged to have been a leader of anti-communist death squads that were alleged to have tortured and killed thousands of civilians before and during the Salvadoran Civil War. To political prisoners he was known as &quot;Blowtorch Bob&quot;, due to his frequent use of a blowtorch in interrogation sessions.

In 1986, ex-U.S. ambassador Robert White reported to the United States Congress that &quot;there was sufficient evidence&quot; to convict D&#x27;Aubuisson of planning and ordering Archbishop Romero&#x27;s assassination, describing D&#x27;Aubuisson as a pathological killer, as early as his 1984 Salvadoran presidential run. In April 2010, Alvaro Saravia, a former army captain who had admitted taking part in Romero&#x27;s murder, testified in an interview with the Salvadoran newspaper &quot;El Faro&quot; that D&#x27;Aubuisson had given the order to proceed with the killing of the archbishop. The report of the U.N. truth commission in El Salvador following the Salvadoran Civil War found that D&#x27;Aubuisson was arrested on a farm following the assassination of the archbishop, along with weapons and documents tied to the assassination.

==Sons==
In February 2007, D&#x27;Aubuisson&#x27;s son Eduardo, along with two ARENA politicians and their driver, were killed in Guatemala. Investigators suggested that the murders may have been connected to drug-trafficking groups. In March 2015, D&#x27;Aubuisson&#x27;s surviving son, Roberto José d&#x27;Aubuisson Munguía, was elected mayor of Santa Tecla, a neighboring municipality of the capital San Salvador.

== In popular culture ==
Tony Plana was cast as Maj. Maximiliano &quot;Max&quot; Casanova in the movie &quot;Salvador&quot; by Oliver Stone, a thinly disguised depiction of D&#x27;Aubuisson. In the 1989 film &quot;Romero&quot;, D&#x27;Aubuisson was depicted as Lt. Columa and played by Eddie Velez.

<text>William Thomas Dillard (September 2, 1914 – February 8, 2002) was an American businessman. He was the founder of the Dillard&#x27;s Department Stores chain.

==Early life==
Dillard was born on September 2, 1914, to Thomas J. Dillard and Hattie Mae Gibson Dillard, both grocers. At 12 years old, Dillard began working for his father who owned a local general store. Dillard found employment with Sears &amp; Roebuck Company where he gained experience in retail business. He graduated from the University of Arkansas with a degree in Business Administration and earned an MBA from Columbia University. He was a member of the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity.

==Career==
Dillard returned to Arkansas and opened his first retail store in 1938 in the town of Nashville, Arkansas, after he borrowed US$8,000 from his father to sign the lease and install shelves, and stocking those shelves with merchandise supplied on generous credit, extended on the basis of wholesalers&#x27; long dealings with his father. In 1948, he sold his Nashville store and opened stores in Texas, followed by more stores across the Southern United States. In 1964, he opened his first store in a mall in Austin, Texas, and foreshadowed the boom of malls. In 1965, he opened more stores in malls in Little Rock, Arkansas, and Tulsa, Oklahoma. He used computerized checkouts to track inventory. By the end of the 20th century, Dillard&#x27;s Department Stores was the third largest department store chain in the United States. He retired in 1998. His eldest son, William T. Dillard II, took over as CEO and his second son, Alex Dillard, as president. His daughters, Drue Corbusier and Denise Mahaffy, and a third son, Mike Dillard, serve as vice presidents.

==Personal life and death==
Dillard married Alexa Latimer on June 9, 1940, and they had five children. He was an Episcopalian, and a Republican. He died on February 8, 2002, at his home in Little Rock, Arkansas at the age of 87.
In February 2020, the University of Arkansas announced the naming of William Dillard Accounting Department in honor of his legacy.

<doc id="1182029" wikidata="Q5509628" url="?curid=1182029" title="Furnace anneal">
<text>Furnace annealing is a process used in semiconductor device fabrication which consist of heating multiple semiconductor wafers in order to affect their electrical properties. Heat treatments are designed for different effects. Wafers can be heated in order to activate dopants, change film to film or film to wafer substrate interfaces, densify deposited films, alter states of grown films, repair damage from implants, move dopants or drive dopants from one film into another or from a film into the wafer substrate. During ion implantation process, the crystal substrate is damaged due to bombardment with high energy ions. The damage caused can be repaired by subjecting the crystal to high temperature. This process is called annealing. Furnace anneals may be integrated into other furnace processing steps, such as oxidations, or may be processed on their own.

Furnace anneals are performed by equipment especially built to heat semiconductor wafers. Furnaces are capable of processing many wafers at a time, but each process can last between several hours and a day. Increasingly, furnace anneals are being supplanted by Rapid Thermal Anneal (RTA) or Rapid Thermal Processing (RTP). This is due to the relatively long thermal cycles of furnaces that causes the dopants which are being activated, especially boron, to diffuse further than is intended. RTP or RTA fixes this by having thermal cycles for each wafer that is of the order of minutes rather than hours for furnace anneals.

<text>The Ferrari Mondial (Type F108) is a mid-engined, V8, grand tourer manufactured and marketed by Ferrari between 1980 and 1993 – with styling by Pininfarina and bodywork by Carrozzeria Scaglietti.

Offered as either a 2+2 coupé or cabriolet, the Mondial has the slightly higher roofline, greater dimensions and increased weight to accommodate occasional rear seating for children or small adults.

The Mondial replaced the Ferrari 308/208 GT4 coupé and remains the last V8, rear mid-engined, 2+2 Ferrari. 

The name &quot;Mondial&quot;, French for &quot;global&quot;, reflected its worldwide conformance with 1980 safety and emission standards — as well as the company&#x27;s prominent motor racing victories. Ferrari had used the nameplate in the 1950s to celebrate Formula 1 World Championships and again in the 1970s to mark its Formula 1 World Constructors Championships.

==Design==
The Mondial uses a rear mid-engine, in 2+2 2-door coupé or 2+2 convertible bodystyles. It was marketed concurrently with Ferrari&#x27;s two-seater 308 GTB/GTS, 328, and 348 sports cars, sharing the major mechanical systems with the two-seater model Ferrari marketed concurrently.

Unlike its 308 GT4 predecessor which was styled by the Italian Gruppo Bertone, the original Mondial 8 was designed by Pierangelo Andreani who just started working at Pininfarina with subsequent iterations redesigned by Leonardo Fioravanti, the designer with whom Ferrari had worked closely since 1951.

===Chassis and body===

Pininfarina&#x27;s bodywork was manufactured by coachbuilder Carrozzeria Scaglietti. Its used outer body panels fitted to a separate space-frame chassis of tubular box or oval-shaped steel sections. While most body panels are steel, the front lid and rear engine cover of the Mondial 8 and QV models are aluminium. Full-width aluminium louvre panels across the front lid and engine cover provide airflow through the front-mounted radiators and engine bay.

Louvre grilles are located on each side of the vehicle just ahead of the rear wheels providing intake air to the engine on the right and on the left, providing air to an external oil cooler located ahead of the rear wheel arch. Louvres in the front polished aluminium grille provide airflow to the main radiator, supplied with coolant via alloy tubing running through the central chassis spine. A full-width black louvre panel is located below the rear bumper, accommodating an exhaust outlet to each side. Front and rear bumpers are black plastic on the Mondial 8 and QV, while the 3.2 and &quot;t&quot; models use integrated wrap-around glass-fibre panels finished in body colour.

The Mondial chassis features detachable sub-frames holding major mechanical assemblies, including one at the rear supporting the engine/transmission/rear suspension assembly, to simplify engine service compared to previous V8 Ferraris.

A forward-hinged lid covers a front compartment accommodating the spare tyre, radiators and cooling fans, battery (ahead of a wheel arch), heating and cooling systems electric control systems. At the rear, a full-width, insulated and trimmed luggage boot with a gas-strut-supported lid sits behind the engine bay. Electrically actuated pop-up headlights contain twin round lamps in each for all 8, QV and 3.2 models, and a single homofocal rectangular unit each side of the Mondial t.

U.S. market models feature rectangular side turn-indicator lamps, front and rear.

===Engine===
All Mondials are fitted with a V8 engine deriving from Ferrari&#x27;s original V8 powerplant released in the 1974 Ferrari (Dino) 308 GT4.

Mondial engines comprise a lightweight alloy V8 block with 90° bank-angle; shrink-fit cylinder liners; a five-bearing, flat-plane crankshaft with paired connecting rods on each journal; belt-driven, quad overhead camshafts (two per cylinder bank) acting directly on the valves; alloy crossflow cylinder heads; and a wet-sump lubrication system (excepting the Mondial t, which used a dry-sump system). Engine displacement started at for the Mondial 8 and QV models, increasing to for the Mondial 3.2, and culminating in for the Mondial t model. The orientation of the 3.4 V8 engine block is unique in &quot;Mondial t&quot; models. Mirroring the two-seater Ferrari V8 vehicles, all 3.0 and 3.2 L engines sit across the car with their crankshaft and cylinder planes transverse to the main vehicle axis. The 3.4 L engine in the &quot;Mondial t&quot; (and 348 GTB cousin) is rotated ninety degrees to a longitudinal orientation with respect to the car.

In the Mondial 8 the V8 employs two valves-per-cylinder, and this increases to four valves-per-cylinder for the &quot;Quattrovalvole&quot; QV and all later models. All models feature a cast-alloy intake housing nestled centrally above the engine &quot;vee&quot; with manifold tubing running directly to each cylinder. Marelli electronic ignition is used on all vehicles with the exception of the Mondial t, and comprises twin coils, a separate distributor run off each bank of cylinders, and a common electronic control module. Again excepting the &quot;Mondial t&quot;, fuel metering is via Bosch K Jetronic continuous fuel injection with &quot;lambda&quot; exhaust sensing. For the Mondial t, a Bosch Motronic 2.5 or 2.7 engine management system controls both the ignition and fuel metering functions. Exhaust gases on all models are collected via 4-2-1 systems fitted to the outside of each cylinder bank, flowing through a one or two catalytic converters to twin outlets each side of the rear panel.
*Power and torque figures quoted are for European versions

===Transmission===

In the Mondial 8, QV, and 3.2 models, the transmission housing is integral with the engine sump casting, albeit with its own oil supply, sitting below and slightly to one side of the main block. Drive to the gearbox is via a single-plate, diaphragm-spring clutch and a set of drop-gears located outboard of the left-hand end of the crankshaft, with output torque feeding into a friction-plate limited-slip final drive unit offset to the rear of the gearbox.

A five-speed, all-indirect manual transmission using a &quot;dog-leg&quot; selector pattern was the only transmission offered. Instead of the conventional &quot;H&quot; shift pattern, this arrangement (also known as a &quot;reverse h-gate&quot;) has 1st gear situated to the far left and back, behind reverse. This pattern has been popular with racing gearboxes, as it allows quicker, more direct shifts between 2nd and 3rd, and 4th and 5th, gears. The output from the final drive to the rear wheels is via a pair of short, solid drive shafts fitted with constant-velocity joints at each end to allow for suspension articulation.

For these models, clutch actuation is hydraulic, unlike their two-seater cousins&#x27; cable systems, and transmission selection is via a rod which extends through the centre chassis tunnel and passes through the engine sump into the transmission housing.

For the Mondial t, the engine and transmission were substantially reconfigured and their orientations rotated by ninety degrees to place the axes of both the engine crankshaft and the transmission input shafts parallel to the vehicle&#x27;s longitudinal axis. The transmission and final-drive units form a combined transaxle arrangement fitted to the rear of the engine block, using a design originally derived from Ferrari&#x27;s 312T Formula 1 car. Drive from the single-plate clutch enters the gearbox and is turned ninety degrees by bevel gears to the main transmission shafts which are aligned transverse to the vehicle. A parallel crownwheel with integral limited-slip action directs output torque to driveshafts with CV joints at each end. The clutch is hydraulically-actuated, and gear selection is via cable operation.

in 1991, an &quot;auto-clutch&quot; option became available on the Mondial t, developed by French supplier Valeo. Essentially, this turned the transmission from a conventional manual into a clutchless manual. This system retained the conventional manual transmission mechanicals but replaced the normal clutch linkage mechanism with an electro-mechanical actuator, without a foot-operated clutch pedal. Clutch engagement and disengagement on the Valeo unit is triggered by the movement of the gear-lever, although the electronic control unit combines data from sources including engine, road-speed, and gear selection to warn against, or over-ride, attempted selections outside the specified operating limits.

===Suspension and running gear===
Although based on the two-seater vehicle designs, Mondials are slightly larger overall including having appreciably wider front and rear track dimensions. Suspension systems are fully independent all-round, comprising unequal-length upper and lower wishbones, coil-over damper units and anti-roll bars at each end of the vehicle. Mondial t vehicles include a driver-adjustable selector to set the electronically controlled damper units, providing three choices of ride-stiffness adjustment.

Steering is a rack-and-pinion mechanism sitting ahead of the front wheels, unpowered on all 8, QV and 3.2 models. Hydraulic power-assistance was standard on the subsequent Mondial t model. Braking is via four-wheel ventilated disks with split-circuit vacuum assistance on all vehicles. Anti-lock braking (ABS) was available as an option in 1987, and it was fitted as standard from 1988.

Wheels on all vehicles are of a five-spoke alloy design in a clear-lacquered finish. Two distinct patterns were used: the Mondial 8 and QV models have wheels with a flat centre and pronounced edges to the five spokes, whereas the 3.2 and t models&#x27; wheels have a convex centre and smoother, angled spokes. All wheels feature a yellow circular centre cap bearing Ferrari&#x27;s black &quot;Cavallino Rampante&quot; rearing-horse logo.

Mondials until the late 1980s, including all 8 and QV models and many 3.2s, were originally fitted with Michelin TRX tyres of size 220/55 VR 390 front and 240/55 VR390 rear. TRX tyres require wheels with the proprietary TRX rim profile, meaning all vehicles fitted with such wheels could only utilise TRX-style tyres. Later 3.2 vehicles and the Mondial t reverted to industry-standard wheel designs of size 7x16 front and 8x16 rear, enabling a far wider range of tyre choices to suit the 205/55 VR16 front and 225/55 VR16 rear tyre specifications.

===Interior===
The seats and interior of all Mondial variants are fully trimmed in Connolly hide with the exception of the use of black vinyl for the dashboard top and upper door linings. Paint, upholstery and carpet colours generally match those available on Ferrari&#x27;s concurrent two-seater models, with the commonest choices being Rosso Corsa or Rosso Dino (reds), Azzurro (blue) and Nero (black), in combination with beige, tan or black leather. All seats including those in the rear are strongly bucket-shaped, and fitted with inertia-reel seatbelts.

A central tunnel for the chassis structure is prominent in both front and rear footwells, and is straddled by a large front centre console with a polished open-gated gear selector and electronic warning-light panel. Electric windows (the front panes only are opening) and air-conditioning are standard fitments, with their controls on the central console. The handbrake is located outside the driver&#x27;s seat beside the inner sill, and is a &quot;drop-down&quot; design to assist ingress and egress. A three-spoked leather steering wheel is mounted to a steering column adjustable for reach and rake, behind which is a &quot;pod-style&quot; instrument binnacle holding six gauges: speedometer, tachometer, fuel level, water temperature, oil pressure and oil temperature. The Mondial instrumentation is completed with a comprehensive set of warning lights and electronic check panels.

==History==

The Mondial was, at the time, one of Ferrari&#x27;s most commercially successful models, with over 6,000 examples produced over its thirteen-year run. The Mondial underwent many updates throughout its production with four distinct variants produced: the Mondial 8, Mondial QV, Mondial 3.2, and Mondial t. All but the Mondial 8 were released in both coupé and cabriolet (convertible) body form.

Starting with the Mondial 8 coupé launched in 1980, the vehicle which served as sole V8-engined Grand Touring or &quot;GT&quot; vehicle within the Ferrari range proved to be a disappointment to some Ferrari enthusiasts. With a body that was larger, heavier and less aerodynamically efficient than the equivalent two-seater models, combined with the introduction of tougher emission standards which significantly dropped power outputs, overall vehicle performance inevitably decreased. In addition, Ferrari responded to new safety requirements, especially in the U.S., with large, black, over-dominant bumpers which were considered to have negatively affected the external design. The fact that the Mondial 8 was a significantly more expensive vehicle than its better-performing two-seater 308 GTBi sister somewhat compounded the situation.

Ferrari acted quickly just two years later in 1982 to address the straight-line performance issues, by upgrading the engine with a new four-valve head. This model, the Mondial Quattrovalvole or QV, shared its engine with the contemporary two-seaters 308 GTB/GTS QV. A new cabriolet version was also introduced at this time, a body style which would be carried forward through all subsequent Mondial models.

The next evolution was the Mondial 3.2 produced from 1985, which saw the engine grow in displacement and power, and both the internal and external styling significantly refreshed. This car has enjoyed strong popularity within the Mondial range due to it being a good all-round performer and one of the last Ferraris to have the relatively straightforward maintenance provided by the Ferrari 328 engine and transmission configuration.

The final Mondial variant was the Mondial t, released in 1989. This contained some of the biggest changes in the Mondial history, with an even-larger engine, a substantial update to the exterior styling and interior ergonomics, and with an entirely new, albeit more complex to service, powertrain. Overall the Mondial t is considered the best vehicle in the range regarding overall performance and refinement, although it is often noted that this comes at the cost of greater maintenance.

Production of the Mondial ceased in 1993, with a total of 6,149 vehicles from all variants having been manufactured.

==Mondial 8==

The first Mondial iteration introduced as the Mondial 8 at the 1980 Geneva Auto Salon. It was the first Ferrari to depart from the company&#x27;s simple 3-digit naming scheme, and some reviews found it relatively mild, compared to other Ferraris, regarding performance, drawing criticism from some in the motoring press. It used a mid/rear-mounted Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection V8, shared with the 308 GTBi/GTSi, mounted transversely. The engine used in the 1973 &quot;Dino&quot; 308 GT4. The K-Jetronic system is mechanical, with a high-pressure pump which streams fuel continuously to the injectors; it does not have a computer, just a few relays to handle the cold start sequence etc.

The chassis was also based on the 308 GT4, but with a wheelbase at . The suspension was the classic layout of unequal-length double wishbones and Koni dampers all around.


==Mondial Quattrovalvole==
The first Mondial engine, although a DOHC design, used just two valves per cylinder. The 1982 Quattrovalvole or QV introduced a new four-valve head; the combustion chamber design purportedly based on the early eighties Formula 1 engine. Again, the engine was shared with the contemporary 308 GTB/GTS QV, and produced . Appearance was largely as per the Mondial 8, although with red engine heads and prominent &quot;Quattrovalvole&quot; script at the rear. 1,145 coupés built between 1982 and 1985.

===Mondial QV Cabriolet===
A new Cabriolet convertible model was added for 1983. The body styling remained the same as the coupé variant, with the roof maintaining the &#x27;buttress&#x27; design, though the Cabriolet required the rear seats to be mounted closer together laterally. The introduction of the Cabriolet saw the popularity of the Mondial rise, particularly in the American market, where a convertible option was highly desirable. The Cabriolet has the added distinction of being the only four-seat, mid-rear engine, convertible automobile ever manufactured in regular production. 629 units were produced between 1983 and 1985, making this the rarest version of the Mondial.
==Mondial 3.2==
Like the new Ferrari 328, the Mondial&#x27;s engine grew in both bore and stroke to 3.2 L (3,185 cc) in 1985. Output was now . The Mondial 3.2 was first presented at the 1985 Frankfurt Auto Show in September that year.

Available in both Coupé and Cabriolet forms, styling refreshed with restyled and body-coloured bumpers, similar to the 328 with more integrated indicators and driving lamps, and new alloy wheels with a more rounded face. The 3.2 also boasted a major interior update, with a more ergonomic layout and a more rounded instrument binnacle. Later cars, from 1987 onwards, also sported ABS brakes. Fuel injection remained the primarily mechanical Bosch K-Jetronic (CIS) with an O2 sensor in the exhaust providing feedback to a simple computer for mixture trimming via a pulse modulated frequency valve that regulated control fuel pressure. The ignition system was Marelli Microplex, with electronic advance control and one distributor per bank of the V8. The 1988 Mondial 3.2 would be the final model year that retained the relatively low maintenance costs of the 308/328 drivetrain, allowing major service items like timing belt and clutch replacement performed with the engine/transmission package still in the car.


==Mondial t==
The final Mondial evolution was 1989&#x27;s Mondial t (Coupé and Cabriolet). It was a substantially changed model, &quot;spearhead of a new generation of V8 Ferraris&quot;, according to &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; magazine. It was visually different from preceding Mondial models, the most recognizable being the redesign of the air intakes to a smaller rectangular shape. Additionally, the door handles were of a visually different design, as were the front and rear bumpers which became body-colored. New front and rear wings cover wider tracks and are re-profiled to a fuller shape compared to previous models, which feature a rolled lip.
The &#x27;t&#x27; called attention to the car&#x27;s new engine/transmission layout: the previously transverse engine mounted longitudinally while the gearbox remained transverse, thus forming a &#x27;t&#x27;. The &#x27;t&#x27; suffix was also homage to the first use of a transverse transmission by Ferrari in the highly successful Ferrari 312T, driven by F1 World Champion Niki Lauda. By adopting this layout, a longer engine could be mounted lower in the chassis, improving handling dramatically. The &#x27;t&#x27; configuration was used by Ferrari&#x27;s Formula One cars of the 1980s, and would be the standard for the marque&#x27;s future mid-engine V8 cars, beginning with the 348, introduced later in the year. The transverse manual gearbox fitted with a Limited Slip Differential with a twin-plate clutch design with bevel gears driving the wheels. Later in production, an electromechanical-actuated clutchless manual transmission, termed &quot;Valeo&quot;, was available as an option; where the driver would change gear using a traditional H-pattern gearshift, but the clutch was automatically actuated through electronic equipment, eliminating the need for a manually-operated clutch pedal.

The new layout saw the engine and transmission mounted on a removable subframe; the assembly removed from the underside of the vehicle for maintenance. This process is necessary for timing belt replacement, making this a costly procedure for the owner who does not have a lift. On the other hand, the clutch was now located at the very rear of the drive train. This arrangement makes clutch replacement and service a simple, inexpensive, and readily owner-doable proposition.

The engine was up to 3.4 L (3405 cc) and . The engine was controlled by Bosch Motronic DME 2.5 (later DME 2.7) electronic engine management that integrated EFI and ignition control into a single computer unit. Two of these were used in the car: one for each bank of the engine. Engine lubrication upgraded to a dry-sump system.
The &quot;t&quot; was home to other Ferrari firsts: It used power-assisted steering for the first time and had a 3-position electronically controlled suspension for a variable tradeoff between ride quality and road holding. It also had a standard anti-lock braking system.

The Mondial t represented the most substantial upgrade to the Mondial model line in performance and handling since its introduction in 1980. The &quot;t&quot; offered greater performance while retaining a mid-engine layout and a practical packaging layout, and was once again, favorably received.

The Mondial&#x27;s chassis would underpin a new generation of two-seater Ferraris, right up to the Ferrari 360, but the 2+2 Mondial would end production just four and a half years later in 1993. However, the &quot;t&quot; layout of the engine and transaxle, adapted from Ferrari&#x27;s Formula One cars, continues to be used in mid-engine V8 model Ferraris to date, albeit with a more sophisticated chassis.

The company has not produced a mid-engine 2+2 car since then, leaving the 2+2 configuration to the more classic front-engine design starting with the 456 in 1992. Since then, the GTC4Lusso, Portofino, Roma have been additional four-seat vehicle offerings – but all of these are front-engined, leaving the Mondial t as the most recent four-seat, mid-engine, Ferrari produced.
===PPG Indy Pace Car===

A Mondial t was manufactured exclusively by Ferrari for PPG Industries to use as a pace car for the PPG Indy Car World Series. Built under the design of Ercole Spada at I.DE.A Institute at a cost of approximately $1 million, it was introduced at the 1989 Champion Spark Plugs 300 in Laguna Seca. 
==Legacy==
The Mondial has historically been a target of derision from Ferrari enthusiasts, with many calling it the one of the worst Ferraris ever made due its styling, performance and weight. Some enthusiasts, however, consider the car a future classic due to its low price relative to other classic Ferraris.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.cheatsheet.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

<text>The Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF) was the expeditionary field force of Canada during the First World War. It was formed on August 15, 1914 following Britain’s declaration of war on the German Empire, with an initial strength of one infantry division. The division subsequently fought at Ypres on the Western Front, with a newly raised second division reinforcing the committed units to form the Canadian Corps. The CEF and corps was eventually expanded to four infantry divisions, which were all committed to the fighting in France and Belgium along the Western Front. A fifth division was partially raised in 1917, but was broken up in 1918 and used as reinforcements following heavy casualties.

== Personnel ==
=== Recruitment ===

The CEF was mostly volunteers; a bill allowing conscription was passed in August 1917, but not enforced until call-ups began in January 1918 (&quot;see&quot; Conscription Crisis of 1917); only 24,132 conscripts ended up being sent to France to take part in the final Hundred Days campaign.

As a Dominion in the British Empire, Canada was automatically at war with Germany upon the British declaration. Popular support for the war was found mainly in English Canada, especially among those born in the United Kingdom who had recently emigrated. Of the first contingent trained at Valcartier in 1914, about two-thirds were men born in the United Kingdom. More Canadian-born recruits would join the ranks throughout the war, but at least half of CEF soldiers were still British-born at the war&#x27;s end in 1918. Recruiting was difficult among the French-Canadian population, many of whom did not agree with Canada&#x27;s participation in the war; one battalion, the 22nd, who came to be known as the &#x27;Van Doos&#x27;, was French-speaking (&quot;Van Doos&quot; is a caricatured Anglophone mispronunciation of the French for &quot;22nd&quot; - ).

To a lesser extent, several other cultural groups within the Dominion enlisted and made a significant contribution to the Force including Indigenous people of the First Nations, Black Canadians as well as Black Americans. Many British nationals from the United Kingdom or other territories who were resident in Canada and the United States also joined the CEF. 

Some units of the Permanent Active Militia were mobilized into the CEF, including the Royal Canadian Dragoons, Lord Strathcona&#x27;s Horse and the Royal Canadian Regiment (RCR). But the bulk of the CEF&#x27;s units were newly raised, including a privately raised and equipped battalion, Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry (PPCLI). The CEF came to include 260 numbered infantry battalions, two named infantry battalions (RCR and PPCLI), 17 mounted regiments, 13 railway troop battalions, five pioneer battalions, four divisional supply trains, four divisional signals companies, a dozen engineering companies, over 80 field and heavy artillery batteries, fifteen field ambulance units, 23 general and stationary hospitals, and many other medical, dental, forestry, labour, tunnelling, cyclist, and service units. Two tank battalions were raised in 1918 but did not see service. Most of the infantry battalions were broken up and used as reinforcements, with a total of fifty being used in the field, including the mounted rifle units, which were re-organized as infantry. The artillery and engineering units underwent significant re-organization as the war progressed, in keeping with rapidly changing technological and tactical requirements.

Another entity within the CEF was the Canadian Machine Gun Corps. It consisted of several motor machine gun battalions, the Eatons, Yukon, and Borden Motor Machine Gun Batteries, and nineteen machine gun companies. During the summer of 1918, these units were consolidated into four machine gun battalions, one being attached to each of the four divisions in the Canadian Corps.

The Canadian Corps with its four infantry divisions comprised the main fighting force of the CEF. The Canadian Cavalry Brigade also served in France. Support units of the CEF included the Canadian Railway Troops, which served on the Western Front and provided a bridging unit for the Middle East; the Canadian Forestry Corps, which felled timber in Britain and France, and special units which operated around the Caspian Sea, in northern Russia and eastern Siberia.

=== Establishment of corps ===
When it was deployed in 1914, the Canadian Expeditionary Force included only infantry battalions, but it became clear by 1915 that support and administrative units needed to be included on the Western Front. After September 1915 it expanded to include supporting combat corps and what were considered administrative corps:

* Canadian Cavalry Brigade
* Canadian Forestry Corps
* Canadian Machine Gun Corps
* Corps of Guides (Canada)
* HQ Corps of Military Staff Clerks
* Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps
* Royal Canadian Army Pay Corps
* Royal Canadian Army Service Corps
* Royal Canadian Army Veterinary Corps
* Royal Canadian Corps of Signals
* Canadian Military Engineers
* Canadian Postal Corps
* Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery

=== Reserves and training ===
The Canadian Expeditionary Force also had a large reserve and training organization in England, and a recruiting organization in Canada.

===Enlistment of foreign nationals===
====American Legion====
A large number of United States citizens enlisted in the Canadian armed forces while the United States was still neutral. In November 1915, an all-American battalion of the CEF was formed and given the title 97th Battalion (American Legion). The unit embarked for Europe in May 1916 at Toronto, but were held at Aldershot, Nova Scotia, due to objections by the US government, causing a number of desertions and resignations. The battalion finally arrived in England in September, having officially dropped the &quot;American Legion&quot; title, although the term continued to be used informally throughout the war. Further American battalions followed, but were either used as drafts for other CEF units or had been merged with the 97th Battalion by the end of the war. Approximately 2,700 US citizens are interred in Commonwealth War Graves or named in its memorials. 

On returning to New York after the war, 2,754 US citizens who had fought with British Empire forces, including 300 African Americans, were detained on Long Island and New Jersey because they lacked the correct documentation. Some of the men reportedly sent a telegram to King George V, complaining of their &quot;rotten reception.&quot; The plight of these men was covered extensively in local and national media, and following several days of negotiations and bureaucratic wrangling, those who had returned legally were allowed to enter the country. Their ticket home was paid by the UK government, in addition to 28 days pay. A United States Department of War report in early 1918 estimated that 25,000 to 30,000 Americans were serving in the Canadian Expeditionary Force.

====Bermudians====
A sizeable percentage of Bermuda&#x27;s volunteers who served in the war joined the CEF, either because they were resident in Canada already, or because Canada (its next nearest neighbour after the United States) was the easiest other part of the British Empire and Commonwealth to reach from Bermuda. Bermuda had been part of British North America (a collection of colonies administered collectively as a region by the Colonial Office), with its garrison forming part of that of Nova Scotia (the second nearest landfall from Bermuda after the United States) under the Commander-in-Chief, Maritime provinces, but as an Imperial fortress it had remained under administration of the British Government after being left out of the 1867 Confederation of Canada (along with the Colony of Newfoundland). As the Royal Canadian Regiment, 38th Battalion (Ottawa), CEF, 77th Battalion, CEF, and 163rd Battalion (French-Canadian), CEF were posted successively to the Bermuda Garrison before proceeding to France, islanders were also able to enlist there. Bermudians in the Canadian Expeditionary Force enlisted under the same terms as Canadians, and all male British Nationals resident in Canada became liable for conscription under the Military Service Act, 1917.

====Chinese Labour Corps====
Chinese labourers were also brought over to Europe, especially the Canadian Railway Troops. From 1917 to 1918 84,000 Chinese labourers were recruited for the Chinese Labour Corps from China (via Shandong Province) that were shipped to Canada and then some to the Western Front. Many of these labourers died in Belgium and France.

==Operations==

===Battle of Ypres===
The Second Battle of Ypres in 1915, the first engagement of Canadian forces in the Great War, exposed Canadian soldiers and their commanders to modern war. They had previously experienced the effects of shellfire and participated in aggressive trench raiding despite a lack of formal training and generally inferior equipment. They were equipped with the frequently malfunctioning Ross rifle, the older, lighter and less reliable Colt machine gun and an inferior Canadian copy of British webbing equipment that rotted quickly and fell apart in the wet of the trenches.

In April 1915, they were introduced to yet another facet of modern war, gas. The Germans employed chlorine gas to create a hole in the French lines adjacent to the Canadian force and poured troops into the gap. The Canadians, operating for the most part in small groups and under local commanders, fired into the flanks of the German advance, forcing it to turn its attention onto the Canadian sector. For three days, Canadian and reinforcing British units fought to contain the penetration with a series of counter-attacks while using handkerchiefs soaked in urine to neutralize effects of the gas. One in every three of the inexperienced but determined Canadians became a casualty. The senior Canadian officers were also inexperienced at first and lacked communications with most of their troops. Notable among these was Arthur Currie, a brigade commander later became the commander of the Canadian Corps and who appointed as his divisional commanders only those who had fought well in this engagement. The battle cost the British Expeditionary Force – BEF (of which the Canadian Corps was a part) 59,275 men and the Canadian Expeditionary Force over 6000.

===Battle of the Somme===
According to historian G. W. L. Nicholson, &quot;The Somme offensive had no great geographical objectives. Its purpose was threefold – to relieve pressure on the French armies at Verdun, to inflict as heavy losses as possible on the German armies, and to aid allies on other fronts by preventing any further transfer of German troops from the west.&quot; The Canadian Corps was formed after receiving the 2nd and 3rd and later, 4th divisions. Its first commander was Lieutenant-General Edwin Alderson, who was soon replaced by Lieutenant-General Julian Byng, in time to repulse a German attack at Mont Sorrel in the Ypres sector in June 1916. while much of the BEF was moving toward the Somme. In this engagement, Major-General Malcolm Mercer, commander of the newly formed 3rd Division was killed; he was the most senior Canadian to be killed in the war.

The corps did not participate in the battles of the Somme until September, but these began on 1 July after a seven-day bombardment. British losses on the first day amounted to 57,470, which included the casualties of the Newfoundland Regiment serving in the British 29th Division. The regiment was annihilated when it attacked at Beaumont Hamel. By the time the four Canadian divisions of the corps participated in September, the Mark I Tank first appeared in battle. Only a few were available because the production time was long for the unfamiliar and unproven technology; those delivered were committed in order to aid the expected breakthrough. The psychological impact of them was considerable, with some claiming that they made many German soldiers surrender immediately, although the four months of sustained combat, high casualties among the defending Germans and the appearance of the fresh Canadian Corps were more likely factors in the increasing surrenders. The toll of the five-month campaign cannot be statistically verified by a single reliable source, however historians have estimated German losses at roughly 670,000 and an Allied total of 623,907. The Canadian Corps suffered almost 25,000 casualties in this the final phase of the operation, but like the remainder of the BEF, it had developed significant experience in the use of infantry and artillery and in tactical doctrine, preparation and leadership under fire.

===Battle of Vimy Ridge===
The Battle of Vimy Ridge had significance for Canada as a young nation. For the first time the Canadian Corps, with all four of its divisions attacked as one. This Canadian offensive amounted to the capture of more land, prisoners and armaments than any previous offensive. The main offensive tactic was the creeping barrage, an artillery strike combined with constant infantry progression through the battlefield.

===Passchendaele===

In August 1917, the Canadian Corps attacked Lens as a distraction to allow two armies of the BEF to begin the Third Battle of Ypres, the attack on Passchendaele Ridge. The Corps, led by Lieutenant General Arthur Currie, captured Hill 70 overlooking Lens and forced the Germans to launch more than twenty counter-attacks in attempting to remove the threat to its flank. The Ypres offensive began with the swift capture of the Messines Ridge, but weather, concrete defences and the lack of any other concurrent Allied effort meant that the BEF fought a muddy, bloody campaign against the main German force for two months. The BEF, including the ANZACs, pushed to within two kilometres of the objective with very high casualties and in ever-deepening mud.

By September, it became clear that a fresh force would need to be brought in for the final push. With the situation in Italy and with the French army deteriorating, it was decided to continue the push and Currie was ordered to bring in the Canadian Corps. He insisted on time to prepare, on reorganizing the now-worn down artillery assets and on being placed under command of General Plumer, a commander he trusted. The first assault began on October 26, 1917. It was designed to achieve about 500 meters in what had become known as &quot;bite and hold&quot; tactics but at great cost (2,481 casualties) and made little progress. The second assault on October 30 cost another 1,321 soldiers and achieved another 500 metres but reached the high ground at Crest Farm. On November 6, after another round of preparations, a third attack won the town of Passchendaele, for another 2,238 killed or wounded. The final assault to capture the remainder of Passchendaele Ridge began on November 10 and was completed the same day. Nine Canadians earned the Victoria Cross in an area not much bigger than four football fields and the Canadian Corps completed the operation after it had taken the BEF three months to advance the eight kilometres onto the ridge. The Canadian Corps suffered 15,654 battle casualties in the muddiest, best-known battle of the Great War.

===Hundred Days Offensive===
Since they were mostly unmolested by the German Army&#x27;s offensive manoeuvres in the spring of 1918, the Canadians were ordered to spearhead the last campaigns of the War from the Battle of Amiens on August 8, 1918 to the winning of a tacit victory for the Allies, when the armistice came into effect on November 11, 1918.

===Deployments to Russia===
In August 1918, the Canadian Expeditionary Force&#x27;s Canadian Siberian Expeditionary Force travelled to revolution-torn Russia. It reinforced a garrison resisting Lenin&#x27;s Bolshevik forces in Vladivostok during the winter of 1918–19. At this time, another force of Canadian soldiers were placed in Archangel, where they fought against Bolsheviks.

==Disbandment==

The Canadian Expeditionary Force was a special force, distinct from the Canadian Militia which mobilized in 1914 on a limited basis for home defence and to assist with the recruitment and training of the Canadian Expeditionary Force. In 1918 the militia personnel active in Canada were granted Canadian Expeditionary Force status, to simplify administration in the wake of conscription coming into force. Beginning in 1918, in anticipation of the disbandment of the Canadian Expeditionary Force, plans for the re-organization of the militia were initiated, guided largely by the deliberations of the Otter Commission, convened for this purpose. Among the commission&#x27;s recommendations was a plan by which individual units of the Canadian Militia, notably infantry and cavalry regiments, would be permitted to perpetuate the battle honours and histories of the Canadian Expeditionary Force units that had fought during the war.

During the latter part of the war, the Canadian Military Hospitals Commission reported on provision of employment for members of the Canadian Expeditionary Force on their return to Canada, and the re-education of those who were unable to follow their previous occupations because of disability.

==Legacy==
After extensive experience and success in battle from the Second Battle of Ypres, through the Somme and particularly in the Battle of Arras at Vimy Ridge in April 1917, and Passchendaele the Canadian Corps came to be regarded as an exceptional force by both Allied and German military commanders. In the later stages of the European war, particularly after their success at Vimy Ridge and Passchendaele, the Canadian Corps was regarded by friend and foe alike as one of the most effective Allied military formations on the Western Front. 

The Canadian Expeditionary Force lost 60,661 men killed or died during the war, representing 9.28 per cent of the 619,636 who enlisted.

There were occasions when Canadian soldiers acted up. Soldiers of the 218th Battalion rioted in Feb 1917. About 150 soldiers of an un-named battalion attacked the police station at Prince Albert in 1917, in protest of the imposition of strict liquor laws.

A.A. Milne&#x27;s well-known character &quot;Winnie-the-pooh&quot; is derived from a black bear taken to Europe as the mascot of a western Canadian army unit during the war.

==Equipment==

During the war the equipment used changed as tactics evolved. The standard issued rifle was, at the beginning of the war, the Ross Rifle, which was later replaced by the Short Magazine Lee-Enfield Mark III (SMLE). This was due to problems of the Ross Rifle in comparison to the reliability of the SMLE, with unofficial replacement already occurring until the switchover in 1916. The service pistols issued were the Colt New Service, M1911 pistol, and the Smith &amp; Wesson Triple Lock. Approved private purchase and secondary side-arms were the Webley Mark VI, and the Enfield revolver. Infantrymen were issued with the Ross bayonet, and later the Pattern 1907 bayonet. Machine-guns initially included the Colt and Vickers machine-guns, with the Vickers line continually expanded during the war, and which were complemented by the Lewis machine gun.

Officially an infantry division would be classified at full animal strength at 5,241 horses and mules; 60.7 percent or 3,182 of these animals were part of the infantry division&#x27;s artillery branch. Besides mounted and cavalry units, the Canadian Expeditionary Force used horses, mules, donkeys and cattle to transport gun pieces on the battle front, as motorized vehicles could not handle rough terrain. At the start of the war over 7,000 horses were brought over to England and Europe from Canada and by the end of the war over 8 million horses had been lost in the course of fighting in Europe. Dogs and carrier pigeons were employed as messengers in the front. With horses, wagons were also used to transport equipment as well.

===Uniforms and combat dress===


Load-bearing equipment

Head dress

Military equipment

The CEF used a mix of service revolver or pistols, bolt-action rifles, machine guns (from light, medium and heavy) and armoured fighting vehicles (armoured cars, tanks and motorcycles). Horses and mules were used by the cavalry, as well as for transport of personnel and equipment to the front.

<doc id="1182050" wikidata="Q5304797" url="?curid=1182050" title="Drag (k.d. lang album)">
<text>Drag is a cover album by k.d. lang, released in 1997; most of its songs feature a smoking motif, although some address broader issues of dependence and/or addiction. The cover of Dionne Warwick&#x27;s &quot;(Theme from) Valley of the Dolls&quot; was notably used in key scenes in the pilot episode and series finale of the Showtime comedy-drama series &quot;Nurse Jackie&quot;. Lang&#x27;s cover of &quot;Hain&#x27;t It Funny&quot; was part of the soundtrack for the 2002 film &quot;Talk to Her&quot;.

== Reception ==
In an AllMusic review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote, &quot;A collection of covers that are somehow related to smoking, Drag is far more ambitious than the average cover record... lang&#x27;s rich voice and the measured arrangements make Drag a ringer for Ingénue in places, but the tone is considerably lighter and more humorous, which certainly makes it an enjoyable listen.&quot;

Writing for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Robert Hilburn said, &quot;The pace is sometimes slow and demanding and a couple of the songs are marginal, but the heart of this album combines mainstream pop accessibility and torch-driven cabaret intimacy in ways that seem absolutely addicting themselves.&quot;

<doc id="1182054" wikidata="Q1617709" url="?curid=1182054" title="Adventures of the Little Koala">
<text>Adventures of the Little Koala (known in Japan as ) is an anime television series produced by Hakuhodo. It aired originally in Japan on TV Tokyo from October 4, 1984, through March 28, 1985, and then aired in the United States on Nickelodeon (later moved into the Nick Jr. block upon its launch at the start of 1988) dubbed in English from June 1, 1987, until April 2, 1993. The storyline revolved around Roobear Koala (voiced in English by former child actor Steven Bednarski) and his friends and their utopian village in the Australian bush, known in the Japanese version as Yukari Village, within the shadow of a real rock formation known as The Breadknife.

Production of the English and French versions of the series was done by the Canadian studio Cinar Films.

It also aired in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Greece, Italy, France, the United Kingdom, in the Arabic-speaking world, and other countries.

== Characters ==
== Historical background ==
&quot;Adventures of the Little Koala&quot; was made as Japan was in the midst of a koala frenzy along with another koala themed anime titled ふしぎなコアラ ブリンキー (&quot;The Wondrous Koala Blinky&quot;), which would later be broadcast alongside &quot;Little Koala&quot; on Nickelodeon&#x27;s Nick Jr. block in 1988, as &quot;Noozles&quot;. According to &quot;The Anime Encyclopedia&quot; by Jonathan Clements and Helen McCarthy, Japan&#x27;s koala frenzy was sparked by the Tama Zoo in western Tokyo receiving their first koala as the Australian government sent six koalas to Japan as a token of goodwill, but in actuality, the Tama Zoo as well as other zoos in Japan got their koalas because Japan was craving them, and &quot;Little Koala&quot; and &quot;Noozles&quot; had already been airing when the koalas arrived in October 1984.

== Production notes ==
The Japanese animation studio Topcraft, best known for providing animation duties on many of Rankin-Bass&#x27; American animated TV specials as well as the feature film &quot;The Last Unicorn&quot;, worked on &quot;Adventures of the Little Koala.&quot; Topcraft provided animation assistance for Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s 1984 feature film &quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind&quot;; in fact, some of the animators who worked on &quot;Little Koala&quot; also worked on &quot;Nausicaa&quot;. After &quot;Nausicaa&quot;, a number of Topcraft animators went on to work for Miyazaki&#x27;s Studio Ghibli.

Some notable animators who worked on this series included Katsuhisa Yamada and Hidekazu Ohara.

The opening and ending theme songs of the Japanese version were recorded by the all-female rock band Akasaka Komachi, which would later gain fame as Princess Princess.

The series has a total of 26 episodes, each of them contained two 11-minute segments.
* Performed by: Sonja Ball, Shari Chaskin and Maxie Vaughann

<doc id="1182058" wikidata="Q5300097" url="?curid=1182058" title="Double switching">
<text>Double switching, double cutting, or double breaking is the practice of using a multipole switch to close or open both the positive and negative sides of a DC electrical circuit, or both the hot and neutral sides of an AC circuit. This technique is used to prevent shock hazard in electric devices connected with unpolarised AC power plugs and sockets. Double switching is a crucial safety engineering practice in railway signalling, wherein it is used to ensure that a single false feed of current to a relay is unlikely to cause a wrong-side failure. It is an example of using redundancy to increase safety and reduce the likelihood of failure, analogous to double insulation. Double switching increases the cost and complexity of systems in which it is employed, for example by extra relay contacts and extra relays, so the technique is applied selectively where it can provide a cost-effective safety improvement.

== Examples ==

=== Landslip and Washaway Detectors ===

A landslip or washaway detector is buried in the earth embankment, and opens a circuit should a landslide occur. It is not possible to guarantee that the wet earth of the embankment will not complete the circuit which is supposed to break. If the circuit is double cut with positive and negative wires, any wet conductive earth is likely to blow a fuse on the one hand, and short the detecting relay on the other hand, either of which is almost certain to apply the correct warning signal.

== Accidents ==

=== Clapham ===
The Clapham Junction rail crash of 1988 was caused in part by the lack of double switching (known as &quot;double cutting&quot; in the British railway industry). The signal relay in question was switched only on the hot side, while the return current came back on an unswitched wire. A loose wire bypassed the contacts by which the train detection relays switched the signal, allowing the signal to show green when in fact there was a stationary train ahead. 35 people were killed in the resultant collision.

=== United Flight 811 ===
A similar accident on the United Airlines Flight 811 was caused in part by a single-switched safety circuit for the baggage door mechanism. Failure of the wiring insulation in that circuit allowed the baggage door to be unlocked by a false feed, leading to a catastrophic de-pressurisation, and the deaths of nine passengers.

== Signalling in NSW ==

A study of railway electrical signalling in New South Wales from the 1900s, shows an ever increasing proportion of double switching compared to single switching.

Double switching does of course cost more wires, more relay contacts, and testing.

On the other hand double switching is inherently less prone to wrong side failures; it helps overcome short-circuit faults that are hard to test for.

Partial double switching might double switch the lever controls, and the track circuits between one signal and the next, while single switching the track circuits in the less critical overlap beyond the next signal.

Double switching is facilitated by more modern relays that have more contacts in less space:

* Pre-1950 Shelf Type Relay - 12 contacts (front (make) and back (break)) - full size 
* Post-1950 Q-type plug in relay - 16 contacts (front (make) and back (break)) - about half size

<text>Ousmane Sembène (; 1 January 1923 or 8 January 1923 – 9 June 2007), was a Senegalese film director, producer and writer. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; considered him one of the greatest authors of Africa and he has often been called the &quot;father of African film&quot;.

He was often credited for his work in the French style as Sembène Ousmane, which he seemed to favor as a way to underscore the &quot;colonial imposition&quot; of this naming ritual and subvert it.

Descended from a Serer family through his mother from the line of Matar Sène, Ousmane Sembène was particularly drawn to Serer religious festivals. He especially was intrigued by the &quot;Tuur festival&quot;.

==Early life==
The son of a fisherman and his wife, Ousmane Sembène was born in Ziguinchor in Casamance to a Lebou family. From childhood he was exposed to the Serer religion through his mother&#x27;s people, especially the &quot;Tuur festival&quot;, in which he was made &quot;cult servant&quot;. Although the &quot;Tuur&quot; demands offerings of curdled milk to the ancestral spirits (Pangool), Sembène did not take his responsibility as cult servant seriously and was known for drinking the offerings made to the ancestors. Some of his adult work draws on Serer themes. His maternal grandmother reared him and greatly influenced him. Women play a major role in his works.

Sembène&#x27;s knowledge of French and basic Arabic besides Wolof, his mother tongue, followed his attendance at a madrasa, as was common for many Muslim boys, and a French school until 1936, when he clashed with the principal. Sembène worked with his father—he was prone to seasickness—until 1938. At the age of fifteen, he moved to Dakar, where he worked a variety of manual labour jobs.

In 1944, during World War II and after the Fall of France, Sembène was drafted into the Senegalese Tirailleurs (a corps of the French Army). His later World War II service was with the Free French Forces. After the war, he returned to his home country. In 1947 he participated in a long railroad strike, on which he later based his seminal novel &quot;God&#x27;s Bits of Wood&quot; (1960).

Late in 1947, Sembène stowed away to reach France, where he worked at a Citroën factory in Paris. He went south to work on the docks at Marseille, where he became active in the French trade union movement. He joined the communist-led CGT and the Communist party, helping lead a strike to hinder the shipment of weapons for the French colonial war in Vietnam. During this time, he discovered the Harlem Renaissance writer Claude McKay and the Haitian Marxist writer Jacques Roumain.

==Early literary career==
Sembène taught himself to read and write in French. He drew on many of his life experiences in his debut novel, &quot;Le Docker Noir&quot;, written in French (1956, later published in English as &quot;The Black Docker&quot;). This was the story of Diaw, an African stevedore who faces racism and mistreatment on the docks at Marseille. Diaw writes a novel, which is later stolen by a white woman and published under her name. When he confronts her, he accidentally kills her. He is tried and executed in scenes highly reminiscent of Albert Camus&#x27;s &quot;The Stranger&quot; (1942, also translated as &quot;The Outsider&quot;). 

Though Sembène focuses particularly on the mistreatment of African immigrants, he also details the oppression of Arab and Spanish workers. He demonstrates that the issues concern xenophobia as much as they do race. This is written in a social realist mode, as was much of his subsequent fiction. His debut marked the beginning of Sembène&#x27;s literary reputation. The success of this novel provided enough financial return so that he could continue writing.

Sembène&#x27;s second novel, &quot;O Pays, mon beau peuple!&quot; (&quot;Oh country, my beautiful people!&quot;, 1957), tells the story of Oumarf. He is an ambitious black Senegalese farmer who returns to his native Casamance with a new white wife and ideas for modernizing the area&#x27;s agricultural practices. Oumar struggles against both the French colonial government and the village social order, and he is eventually murdered. &quot;O Pays, mon beau peuple!&quot; was an international success, and Sembène received invitations from around the world, particularly from Communist countries such as China, Cuba, and the Soviet Union.

Sembène&#x27;s third and most famous novel is &quot;Les Bouts de Bois de Dieu&quot; (&quot;God&#x27;s Bits of Wood&quot;, 1960); most critics consider it his masterpiece, rivaled only by &quot;Xala&quot;. The novel is a fictional treatment of the railroad strike on the Dakar-Niger line, which lasted from 1947 to 1948. Though the charismatic and brilliant union spokesman, Ibrahima Bakayoko, is the most central figure, the novel has no true hero except the community itself. The people band together in the face of hardship and oppression to assert their rights. Accordingly, the novel features nearly fifty characters in both Senegal and neighboring Mali, showing the strike from all possible angles. In this, the novel is often compared to Émile Zola&#x27;s &quot;Germinal&quot;.

Sembène followed &quot;Les Bouts de Bois de Dieu&quot; with the short fiction collection &quot;Voltaïque&quot; (&quot;Tribal Scars&quot;, 1962). The collection contains short stories, tales, and fables, including &quot;La Noire de...&quot; which he would later adapt as his first film. In 1964, he released &quot;l&#x27;Harmattan&quot; (&quot;The Harmattan&quot;), an epic novel about a referendum for independence that takes place in an African capital.

From 1962 to 1963, Sembène studied filmmaking for a year at Gorky Film Studio, Moscow, under Soviet director Mark Donskoy. Also studying there was Sarah Maldoror, a French-Guadeloupean artist who became the first woman to make a feature film in Africa.

==Later literary career==
With the 1965 publication of the novellas &quot;Le mandat, précédé de Vehi-Ciosane&quot; (&quot;The Money Order and White Genesis&quot;), Sembène&#x27;s emphasis began to shift. Just as he had once attacked the racial and economic oppression conducted by the French colonial government, with these works, he turned his attention to the corrupt African elites who followed during independence.

He was among the contributors to the magazine &quot;Lotus&quot;, which was launched in Cairo in 1968 and financed by Egypt and the Soviet Union.

Sembène continued this theme with the novel &quot;Xala&quot; (1973), the story of El Hadji Abdou Kader Beye, a rich businessman. On the very night of his wedding to his beautiful, young third wife, El Hadji suffers impotence (&quot;xala&quot; in Wolof), and believes it to be caused by a curse. El Hadji grows obsessed with removing the curse through visits to marabouts. Only after losing most of his money and reputation does he discover he was cursed by the beggar who lives outside his offices, whom he had wronged in the course of acquiring his fortune.

&quot;Le Dernier de l’empire&quot; (&quot;The Last of the Empire&quot;, 1981), Sembène&#x27;s last novel, depicts corruption and an eventual military coup in a newly independent African nation. His paired 1987 novellas &quot;Niiwam et Taaw&quot; (&quot;Niiwam and Taaw&quot;) continue to explore social and moral collapse in urban Senegal.

On the strength of &quot;Les Bouts de Bois de Dieu&quot; and &quot;Xala&quot;, Sembène is considered one of the leading figures in African postcolonial literature. Samba Gadjigo notes that his influence reached audiences beyond Africa, &quot;Of Sembène&#x27;s ten published literary works, seven have been translated into English&quot;. By contrast, the Nigerian pioneer writers Chinua Achebe and Wole Soyinka wrote their works in English, which eased their recognition beyond Nigeria.

==Film==
As an author concerned with social change, Sembène wished to touch a wide audience. He realized that his written works would reach only the cultural elites, but that films were &quot;the people&#x27;s night school&quot; and could reach a much broader African audience.

In 1963, Sembène produced his first film, a short called &quot;Barom Sarret&quot; (The Wagoner). In 1964 he made another short, entitled &quot;Niaye&quot;. In 1966 he produced his first feature film, &quot;La Noire de...&quot;, based on one of his own short stories; it was the first feature film ever released by a sub-Saharan African director. Though only 60 minutes long, the French-language film won the Prix Jean Vigo, bringing immediate international attention to both African film generally and Sembène specifically. Sembène followed this success with the 1968 &quot;Mandabi&quot;, achieving his dream of producing a film in his native Wolof language.

His later Wolof-language films include &quot;Xala&quot; (1975, based on his own novel), &quot;Ceddo&quot; (1977), &quot;Camp de Thiaroye&quot; (1987), and &quot;Guelwaar&quot; (1992). The Senegalese release of &quot;Ceddo&quot; was strongly censored, ostensibly for a problem with Sembène&#x27;s paperwork, though some critics suggest that this censorship had more to do with the government&#x27;s interpretation of what could be considered anti-Muslim content in the film.

Sembène resisted this action by distributing fliers at theaters describing the censored scenes, and he released the film uncut for the international market.

In 1971, Sembène also made a film in French and Diola, entitled &quot;Emitaï&quot;. It was entered into the 7th Moscow International Film Festival, where it won a Silver Prize. It was banned by governments throughout French West Africa. His 1975 film &quot;Xala&quot; was entered into the 9th Moscow International Film Festival.

In 1977 his film &quot;Ceddo&quot; was entered into the 10th Moscow International Film Festival. In the same year Sembène was invitted to be a member of the jury at the 27th Berlin International Film Festival. At the 11th Moscow International Film Festival in 1979, he was awarded with the Honorable Prize for the contribution to cinema.

Recurrent themes of Sembène&#x27;s films are the history of colonialism, the failings of religion, the critique of the new African bourgeoisie, and the strength of African women.

His final film, the 2004 feature &quot;Moolaadé&quot;, won awards at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival and the FESPACO Film Festival in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. The film, set in a small African village in Burkina Faso, explored the controversial subject of female genital mutilation.

Sembène often makes a cameo appearance in his films. For example, in &quot;Mandabi&quot; he plays the letter writer at the post office.

==Death==
Ousmane Sembène died on 9 June 2007, at the age of 84. He had been ill since December 2006, and died at his home in Dakar, Senegal, where he was buried in a shroud adorned with Quranic verses. Sembène was survived by three sons from two marriages.

Seipati Bulane Hopa, Secretary General of the Pan African Federation of Filmmakers (FEPACI), described Sembène as &quot;a luminary that lit the torch for ordinary people to walk the path of light...a voice that spoke without hesitation, a man with an impeccable talent who unwaveringly held on to his artistic principles and did that with great integrity and dignity.&quot;

South Africa&#x27;s Pallo Jordan, Minister of Arts and Culture, went further in eulogizing Sembène as &quot;a well rounded intellectual and an exceptionally cultured humanist...an informed social critic [who] provided the world with an alternative knowledge of Africa.&quot;

<doc id="1182067" wikidata="Q8030004" url="?curid=1182067" title="Wolfert Acker">
<text>Wolfert Acker (1667–1753) was a colonial-period American who is featured in Washington Irving&#x27;s short story collection &quot;Wolfert&#x27;s Roost and Miscellanies&quot; (1855). His name was recorded in all combinations of Wolfert or Wolvert as given name, and Acker, Echert, Eckar, or Ecker as surname. He was born in Flatbush, Brooklyn, New York and died at his sizable home, &quot;Wolfert&#x27;s Roost&quot; (or &quot;Wolfert&#x27;s Rest&quot;) near the site of what is now Irvington, New York in Westchester County, New York. On December 20, 1692, on land belonging to Frederick Philipse, he married Maretje Sibouts.

Acker served the British colonial government as collector of Philipsburg Manor in New Netherlands. He was a quiet man whose favorite phrase was &quot;Rust in Lust&quot; (peace in quiet) but always found himself working for very loud and active governors; he was, at one point, privy counsellor to Peter Stuyvesant, before eventually retiring to Wolfert&#x27;s Roost. William Owens believes that, despite his high status, Wolfert may have been a tenant of Philipse. Tenant or not, Wolfert did have the second largest house in the region, second only to Philipse Manor Hall, which still stands.

Jan Ecker, Wolfert&#x27;s brother, was the first deacon of the Old Dutch Church of Sleepy Hollow, which was founded by Philipse, and was still living in May 1716. Wolfert Acker became the second deacon and later, an Elder. However, by May 1716, he and his wife Maritie were two of eight members no longer on the roll, although their names continued to appear as baptismal witnesses until 1734. Acker is entombed beneath the floorboards of the church along with other Elders, beside Philipse and his wife.

Acker had three sons, Steven, Siber, and Abraham, and each son was married and named a son Wolfert. From Abraham&#x27;s line came Abraham II and Wolfert II, the American &quot;patriot&quot; and Whig coordinator who lived in Marlborough, New York (where his house, Hill House, still stands) and founder of the Acker Ferry between Newburgh, New York and what became in 1913 part of Beacon, New York. Abraham&#x27;s connection to the Van Tassel family is cited in &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot;, and it was through their association with a rebellious Van Tassel scion during the revolutionary period that the Ackers lost Wolfert&#x27;s Roost.

Wolfert&#x27;s property was passed along in his family for some time, but was eventually broken up and sold off. One person who bought his land was Washington Irving who took an existing structure and made his romantic Sunnyside out of it. The actual Wolfert&#x27;s Roost was burned down by the British after the brother-in-law of Catriena Ecker Van Tassel shot at the British sloops with a goose-rifle charged with nails.

Eckar Street in Irvington, New York is named for him.

<doc id="1182076" wikidata="Q1498131" url="?curid=1182076" title="Deadly weapon">
<text>A deadly weapon, sometimes dangerous weapon (although some jurisdictions differentiate between the two) or lethal weapon, is an item that can inflict mortal or great bodily harm. By statutory definition, certain items, especially firearms, are designated &quot;deadly weapons &quot;&quot;&quot;, meaning they are regarded as deadly weapons no matter how they are used, from the Latin for &quot;by itself&quot;. In addition, deadly weapons statutes often contain provisions covering other implements intended to be used to inflict harm.

The use or possession of a deadly weapon during the commission of a crime often constitutes a penalty enhancer. The deadly weapon penalty enhancer is premised on a belief that commission of the particular crime is inherently more dangerous.

In some jurisdictions, a distinction is made between deadly weapons and destructive devices, such as explosives, incendiary or poison gas, bombs, grenades, landmines, rockets, missiles, or similar devices, including the unassembled components from which such devices can be made.

==Deadly weapons &quot;per se&quot;==
A deadly weapon &quot;per se&quot; is usually defined as a firearm and may include knives of a certain length (usually three inches or longer, depending on jurisdiction). Statutes list weapons such as switchblade, gravity knife, ballistic knife, stiletto, sword, dagger, blackjack, brass knuckles, nunchaku (fighting sticks), shuriken (throwing stars), among others.

==Other deadly weapons==
Any object designed, made, or adapted for the purposes of inflicting death or serious physical injury can be considered a deadly weapon.

For example, a shoe or a shod foot used for kicking may be considered a dangerous weapon. A man from Florida was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon after throwing a live alligator through the open drive-through window of a fast food restaurant. In Texas a federal grand jury decided that a flashing GIF, intended to provoke an epileptic seizure resulting in death, can be considered as a deadly weapon.

==Examples of statutes==
===In Wisconsin===
In Wisconsin, statute §939.22(10) defines dangerous weapon:
&quot;Dangerous weapon&quot; means any firearm, whether loaded or unloaded; any device designed as a weapon and capable of producing death or great bodily harm; any electric weapon, as defined in s. 941.295 (4); or any other device or instrumentality which, in the manner it is used or intended to be used, is calculated or likely to produce death or great bodily harm.

===In Pennsylvania===
Pennsylvania Crimes Code, Title 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 2301. Definitions.
&quot;Deadly Weapon.&quot; Any firearm, whether loaded or unloaded, or any device designed as a weapon and capable of producing death or serious bodily injury, or any other device or instrumentality which, in the manner in which it is used or intended to be used, is calculated or likely to produce death or serious bodily injury. (effective June 6, 1973)

===In Maine===
In Maine, the definition of &quot;dangerous weapon&quot; includes firearms, each of are defined in Title 17-A M.R.S.A § 2 sub (9) &amp; (12-A);

17-A M.R.S.A. § 2(9) Dangerous weapon:
A. &quot;Use of a dangerous weapon&quot; means the use of a firearm or other weapon, device, instrument, material or substance, whether animate or inanimate, which, in the manner it is used or threatened to be used is capable of producing death or serious bodily injury. 
B. &quot;Armed with a dangerous weapon&quot; means in actual possession, regardless of whether the possession is visible or concealed, of:
(1) A firearm;
(2) Any device designed as a weapon and capable of producing death or serious bodily injury; or
(3) Any other device, instrument, material or substance, whether animate or inanimate, which, in the manner it is intended to be used by the actor, is capable of producing or threatening death or serious bodily injury. For purposes of this definition, the intent may be conditional. 
C. When used in any other context, &quot;dangerous weapon&quot; means a firearm or any device designed as a weapon and capable of producing death or serious bodily injury.

17-A M.R.S.A. § 2(12-A) Firearm:
&quot;Firearm&quot; means any weapon, whether loaded or unloaded, which is designed to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive and includes any such weapon commonly referred to as a pistol, revolver, rifle, gun, machine gun or shotgun. Any weapon which can be made into a firearm by the insertion of a firing pin, or other similar thing, or by repair, is a firearm.

===In Florida===
Sec. 21-14. - Dangerous weapons; penalty; trial court.
(a) Concealed dangerous weapons. It shall be unlawful for any person to wear under his clothes, or concealed about his person, or to display in a threatening manner any dangerous or deadly weapon including, but not by way of limitation, any pistol, revolver, slingshot, cross-knuckles or knuckles of lead, brass or other metal, or any bowie knife, razor, dirk, dagger, or any knife resembling a bowie knife, or any other dangerous or deadly weapon, except as hereinafter provided.
Note— Florida Statutes § 790.33, as amended, preempts and declares null and void all local ordinances, administrative regulations and rules in the field of firearms and ammunition, with limited exceptions set forth in § 790.33, as amended.

<doc id="1182080" wikidata="Q5125870" url="?curid=1182080" title="Clapham Junction rail crash">
<text>The Clapham Junction rail crash occurred on the morning of 12 December 1988, when a crowded British Rail passenger train crashed into the rear of another train that had stopped at a signal just south of Clapham Junction railway station in London, England, and subsequently sideswiped an empty train travelling in the opposite direction. A total of 35 people died in the collision, while 484 were injured.

The collision was the result of a signal failure caused by a wiring fault. New wiring had been installed, but the old wiring had been left in place and not adequately secured. An independent inquiry chaired by Anthony Hidden, QC found that the signalling technician responsible had not been told that his working practices were wrong, and his work had not been inspected by an independent person. He had also performed the work during his 13th consecutive seven-day workweek. Hidden was critical of the health and safety culture within British Rail at the time, and his recommendations included ensuring that work was independently inspected and that a senior project manager be made responsible for all aspects of any major, safety-critical project such as re-signalling work.

British Rail was fined £250,000 for violations of health and safety law in connection with the incident.

==Collisions==
On 12 December 1988 the 07:18 from to London Waterloo, a crowded 12-car train made up of four-car 4VEP electric multiple units 3033, 3119 and 3005, was approaching when the driver saw the signal ahead of him change from green (&quot;proceed&quot;) to red (&quot;danger&quot;). Unable to stop at the signal, he stopped his train at the next signal and then reported to the signal box by means of a line-side telephone. He was told there was nothing wrong with the signal. Shortly after 08:10, the following train, the 06:30 from , made up of 4REP unit 2003 and 4TC units 8027 and 8015, collided with the Basingstoke train. A third train, carrying no passengers and comprising 4VEP units 3004 and 3425, was passing on the adjacent line in the other direction and collided with the wreckage immediately after the initial impact. The driver of a fourth train, coasting with no traction current, saw the other trains and managed to come to a stop behind the other two and the signal that should have protected them, which was showing a yellow &quot;proceed with caution&quot; aspect instead of a red &quot;danger&quot; aspect.

== Casualties ==
As a result of the collisions, 35 people died, and 69 were seriously injured. Another 415 sustained minor injuries. Twenty-two of the people killed were from Dorset and the New Forest, including the train driver John Rolls, who was from Bournemouth.

==Emergency response==
The driver of the Basingstoke train was off his train and standing by the line-side telephone when his train was pushed forward several feet by the collision. He picked up the receiver and spoke to the signalman, informing him of the collision and asking him to call the emergency services. The signalman immediately switched all the signals he could to &#x27;danger&#x27;, and signalled to the adjacent signal boxes he had an obstruction on the line. He had no control over automatic signals, however, and was not able to stop the fourth train. He then called the Clapham Junction station manager and asked him to call the emergency services. The crash had tripped the high-voltage feed to the traction current. The operator in the nearby Raynes Park electrical control room suspected there had been a derailment and re-configured the supply so that the nearby Wimbledon line trains could still run.

Pupils and teachers from the adjacent Emanuel School, who were first on the scene of the disaster, were later commended for their service by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
Rescue was hampered because the railway was in a cutting, with a metal fence at the top and a wall at the bottom of a wooded slope. The last casualty was taken to hospital at 13:04 and the last body was removed at 15:45.

==Investigations==
An initial internal investigation showed that a wiring fault meant that the signal would not show a red danger aspect when the track circuit immediately in front of the signal was occupied. Work associated with the &quot;Waterloo Area Resignalling Scheme&quot; meant new wiring had been installed, but the old wiring had been left connected at one end, and loose and uninsulated at the other.

An independent inquiry was chaired by Anthony Hidden, QC for the Department for Transport. His eventual report included 93 recommendations, for changes to the working practices of both British Rail and the emergency services.

A 1978 British Rail Southern Region report had concluded that due to the age of the equipment the re-signalling was needed by 1986. However, approval was given in 1984 after a report of three wrong-side signal failures. The re-signalling project had been planned assuming more people were available, but employees felt that the programme was inflexible and that they were under pressure to get the work done. Installation and testing was carried out at weekend during voluntary overtime, the technician having worked a seven-day week for the previous 13 weeks. The re-wiring had been done a few weeks previously, but the fault had only developed the previous day when equipment had been moved and the loose and uninsulated wire had created a false feed to a relay.

The signalling technician who had done the work had not cut back, insulated, nor tied back the loose wire and his work had not been supervised, nor inspected by an independent person as was required. In particular, a wire count that would have identified that a wire had not been removed was not carried out. There had been inadequate training, assessment, supervision and testing and, with a lack of understanding of the risks of signalling failure, these were not monitored effectively.
Critical of the health and safety culture within British Rail at the time, Hidden recommended that unused signal wires needed to be cut back and insulated, and that a testing plan be in place, with the inspection and testing being done by an independent person. Signal technicians needed to attend refresher courses every five years, and testers needed to be trained and certified. Management was to ensure that no one was working high levels of overtime, and a senior project manager made responsible for all aspects of the project. Unprotected wrong side signal failures – where the failure permitted a train to go beyond where it was permitted – had to be reported to the Railway Inspectorate. Cab radios, linking driver and signalman, were recommended, as was the installation of address system on existing trains that were not expected to be withdrawn within five years.

==Legacy==
Testing was mandated on British Rail signalling work and the hours of work of employees involved in safety-critical work was limited. Although British Rail was fined £250,000 () for breaches of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974, there was no prosecution for manslaughter. In 1996 the collision was one of the events cited by the Law Commission as reason for new laws on manslaughter, resulting in the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007.

A memorial marking the location of the crash site is at the top of the cutting above the railway on Spencer Park, Battersea.

The Basingstoke train stopped at the next signal after the faulty signal, in accordance with the rule book. Railway historian Adrian Vaughan suggests this may not be the best way of handling faulty signals. If the Basingstoke train had carried on to the signal following the next signal, the crash would not have happened because the Bournemouth train would have stopped at the signal where the crash occurred. As of 1999, the rule book had not been changed.

In 2017, a Rail Accident Investigation Branch report into a serious irregularity at on 29 December 2016 revealed that some of the lessons from the Clapham Junction crash appeared to have been forgotten. In that incident, a pair of redundant points had been left in an unsafe condition and undetectable by the signalling system. The alertness of a driver prevented a serious incident. Excessive working hours, cancellation of route-proving trains and lack of detailed planning were identified as contributory factors to the incident. A year later, a report into a collision at London Waterloo highlighted similar circumstances, saying that &quot;some of the lessons from the 1988 Clapham Junction accident are fading from the railway industry&#x27;s collective memory&quot;.

<text>Lawrence Brooks Hays (August 9, 1898 – October 11, 1981) was an American lawyer and politician who served eight terms as a Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives from the State of Arkansas from 1943 to 1959. He was also a president of the Southern Baptist Convention.

== Biography ==
Brooks Hays was born in London, Pope County, Arkansas, on August 9, 1898. He attended public schools in Russellville, Arkansas. Hays served in the United States Army in 1918. After leaving the service he earned a degree from the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville in 1919. He attended law school at George Washington University, becoming a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity, earning his law degree in 1922, after which he was admitted to the bar. Hays returned to Russellville and opened a private law practice.

=== Political career ===
Hays served as assistant attorney general of Arkansas from 1925 to 1927. Hays ran for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1928 and 1930, but was unsuccessful both times.

He served as a Democratic National committeeman for Arkansas from 1932 to 1939. With the arrival of the New Deal, Hays was appointed as a labor compliance officer for the National Recovery Administration in Arkansas in 1934. He served as assistant to the administrator of resettlement in 1935 and held administrative and legal positions in the Farm Security Administration from 1936 to 1942.

Hays ran for the United States House of Representatives and was elected to the Seventy-eighth. Hays was reelected seven times and served from January 3, 1943 – January 3, 1959.

In 1953, Hays sponsored House Resolution 60, to create within the Capitol building, &quot;a place of retreat as an encouragement to prayer.&quot; This followed a trend of religious legislation which had manifested the previous year in the establishment of the National Day of Prayer, and would continue in following years with the insertion of the words &quot;under God&quot; into the Pledge of Allegiance (1954), and the addition of &quot;In God We Trust&quot; to the national currency (1955). 1953 also saw the inception of the Presidential Prayer Breakfast, later renamed the National Prayer Breakfast, an event sponsored by International Christian Leadership, also known as The Family. Hays, whom &quot;The Washington Post&quot; Drew Pearson described in a June 20, 1954, column as &quot;one of the foremost experts in psychological warfare against communism,&quot; used his evangelical connections to help build a Christian conservative consensus in favor of the aggressive internationalism The Family called &quot;Militant Liberty,&quot; an approach favored by internationalist Republicans and conservative Democrats.

==The 1958 election==

The major issue of the day was President Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s sending in federal troops to integrate Central High School in Little Rock (&quot;see also Little Rock Integration Crisis&quot;). Most Arkansas politicians opposed the intervention, but Hays (D) tried to mediate the standoff between the federal government and Arkansas Gov. Orval Faubus. Hays was not an integrationist, and he had signed the 1956 anti-desegregation Southern Manifesto, but his actions inflamed segregationists in the state, who rallied around Amis Guthridge the attorney for several segregationist groups in the Democratic primary. Guthridge was backed by the White Citizens Council and ran on a pro-segregation platform. Hays prevailed by a 3–2 margin in the primary. Then, with just a week to go before the November election, Dale Alford, a member of the Little Rock school board, launched a write-in bid against Hays. Backed by Faubus&#x27; allies, Alford won in a major upset by just over 1,200 votes (51–49 percent). It was one of only three times in the past half-century (this was asserted in 2006) that a write-in candidate won a Congressional election.

==Post-congressional career==
During his last term in Congress, Hays was elected to serve as the president of the Southern Baptist Convention for its 1957–1958 term. He was nominated by J. D. Grey, long-term pastor of the First Baptist Church of New Orleans. In that capacity, Hays traveled with Rev. Dr. Clarence Cranford, his pastor at Calvary Baptist Church in Washington, D.C., and president of the American Baptist Convention, to Moscow for a joint peace mission.

From 1959 to 1961, after his congressional tenure had ended, Hays served on the board of directors of the Tennessee Valley Authority. Hays served in the Kennedy administration as Assistant Secretary of State for congressional relations in 1961 and as Special Assistant to the President of the United States from late 1961 until February 1964.

Hays became a professor of political science at the Eagleton Institute at Rutgers University and a visiting professor of government at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. He served as director of the Ecumenical Institute at Wake Forest University from 1968 to 1970. In 1970 he was elected as co-chairman of Former Members of Congress, Inc. and served as the chairman of the Government Good Neighbor Council of North Carolina. 

He also served on the board of directors of the National Conference on Citizenship in 1960.

In 1966, Hays ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in Arkansas. It was a crowded field of eight candidates, following 12 years of control by Governor Orval Faubus, who was stepping down. Hays finished third, ahead of the man who had defeated him as a write-in candidate in 1958, Dale Alford, but behind Frank Holt and &quot;Justice Jim&quot; Johnson. Johnson, the eventual party nominee, a former Arkansas Supreme Court justice from Conway and avowed segregationist, was defeated in the November general election by the Republican Winthrop Rockefeller of Morrilton.

In 1972 Hays was the Democratic nominee for election to the Ninety-third Congress as a representative from North Carolina, but lost to the Republican incumbent, Wilmer Mizell (also known as &quot;Vinegar Bend&quot; Mizell).

=== Death ===
With his career at an end, Hays took up residence in Chevy Chase, Maryland. He died on 11 October 1981 in Chevy Chase and was buried at Oakland Cemetery in Russellville, Arkansas.

<text>Buttonville Municipal Airport or Toronto/Buttonville Municipal Airport was a medium-sized airport in the neighbourhood of Buttonville in Markham, Ontario, Canada, north of Downtown Toronto, which closed in November 2023. It was operated by Torontair. Due to its location within Toronto&#x27;s suburbs, there were several strict noise-reduction procedures for aircraft using the airport, which was open and staffed 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. In 2014, Buttonville was Canada&#x27;s 20th busiest airport by aircraft movements. There was also a weather station located at the airport, which was still operational on the site but closed along with the airport (weather data for Markham is now referencing to Toronto City Centre Airport by Environment Canada).

The airport was classified as an airport of entry by Nav Canada and was serviced by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) on a call-out basis from Oshawa Executive Airport during weekdays and Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport on the Toronto Islands during weekends. CBSA officers at this airport handled general aviation aircraft only, with no more than 15 passengers.

In May 2023, the airport operators announced plans to close the airport to its tenants, and a NOTAM was issued stating CYKZ was officially closed at 11:00 (EST) on November 24, 2023.

==History==

Fred F. Gillies was the operator of Buttonville Airport and Gillies Flying Service starting in 1953 until he retired in 1958.
Buttonville Airport began to really grow as a grass airstrip in 1953 when Leggat Aviation moved its operations from Barker Field in Toronto. The airstrip became an official airport in 1962.

===Second air traffic control tower===


On January 17, 2006, Nav Canada announced plans for the construction of a new air traffic control tower at Buttonville Airport. It is located at the south end of the now-closed airport next to FlightExec offices on Allstate Parkway.

The new tower, representing an investment of over $2 million, replaced the existing facility, which was built in 1967 and had reached the end of its useful life. Construction began in the fall of 2006 and became fully operational on June 26, 2007. The new tower provided expanded operational space, optimal visibility and the latest in air navigation equipment and technology for 10 air traffic controllers and one support staff who provided service to 84,000 aircraft movements per year at the airport. It is located on the south side of the airport – the opposite side of the old tower. The new tower was designed and built using a modular design enabling the facility to be relocated in the future. New equipment and technology include the Nav Canada Auxiliary Radar Display System and the company&#x27;s state-of-the-art voice communications switch.

NAV Canada shut down operations of the air traffic control tower on January 3, 2019.

===Redevelopment plans===

Buttonville Airport was privately owned, and was threatened with closure due to lack of funds. The Greater Toronto Airports Authority (GTAA) ceased funding the airport causing a $1.5 million loss. The GTAA blamed the decrease of traffic at Pearson Airport for eliminating the subsidy.

In September 2009, the Sifton family, owners of the airport, announced plans to re-develop the airport from 2009 to 2016 into a mixed use of commercial, retail and residential development. 

In 2010, a joint real estate venture purchased the 170-acre property on 7 October, with the intention of redeveloping the property by Cadillac Fairview. Plans included condominiums, retail shops, and office space. Due to planning delays, in 2018 Cadillac Fairview announced the site would continue to operate as an airport until at least 2023.

=== Closure ===

On May 31, 2023, the president of Torontair Limited formally notified the tenants of the airport that the Toronto Buttonville Municipal Airport would cease operations on November 30, 2023, although the airport actually closed down six days before this date, on November 24.

==Navigation==
There were two non-precision instrument approaches available: a Global Positioning System (GNSS) approach to runway 33 and a localizer approach to runway 15.

==Radio==
Buttonville Airport was in a Class E control zone. Pilots were required to broadcast their intentions on the mandatory frequency 124.8 MHz prior to entering the control zone. After the control tower closed in 2019, standard uncontrolled aerodrome position reports were required be broadcast.

The London Flight Information Centre had a Remote Communications Outlet at the airport operating on the frequency 123.15 MHz. Toronto Terminal handled instrument flight rules (IFR) arrivals and departures and visual flight rules (VFR) flight following on 133.40 MHz.

Flightline is available on 123.50 MHz.

==Navigation aids==
There were two ground-based navigation aids attached specifically to the Buttonville airport:

*a distance measuring equipment (DME) on channel 48 (111.1 MHz) with the identifier &quot;IKZ&quot;, located on the airfield
*a localizer for runway 15 on the frequency 111.1 MHz

==Tenants==

==Ground access==
The airport was located next to Highway 404 at the 16 Avenue interchange with connections to nearby Highway 407, with Highway 401 further to the south. 

==Incidents==
On May 25, 2010, a Cirrus SR20 4-seater plane crashed on the roof of a building just from the airport in Markham (Woodbine Avenue near Apple Creek Boulevard). The pilot and a passenger died in the crash; however, nobody on the ground was seriously hurt. Markham Fire &amp; Emergency Services crews quickly doused the flames; rescue crews were not able to go on top of the building to reach the plane due to possibility of structural collapse.

On June 20, 2010, an accident occurred just outside the airport. A black four-seater banner-towing Cessna 172K Skyhawk, registration C-GQOR, crashed on Vogell Road near the Highway 404 and 16th Avenue interchange in Richmond Hill. The pilot, the aircraft&#x27;s only occupant, was killed in the crash.

On July 12, 2018, a pilot was killed in a Bellanca 8KCAB when it crashed in a nearby field southwest of the airport.

On February 27, 2020, a US-registered Dassault Falcon 50 corporate jet (tail number N951DJ), was set on fire late at night. The fence surrounding the airport was cut through and a jerrycan was found at the scene. The aircraft, parked outside near a hangar, was written off, damaged beyond repair. The fire was considered arson.

On August 10, 2021, a Cessna on final approach struck a drone operated by York Regional Police, causing major damage to the aircraft, although there were no injuries.

==Support==

The airport had one aircraft rescue and firefighting unit (ARFF), a Walter RIV 2000, but it was retired. Fire and rescue at the airfield was later provided by Markham Fire and Rescue Stations 9-2 (10 Riviera Drive near Woodbine Avenue and 14th Avenue) or 9-3 (Woodbine and Major Mackenzie Drive East).

<doc id="1182121" wikidata="Q3539296" url="?curid=1182121" title="Trinity Washington University">
<text>Trinity Washington University is a private Catholic university in Washington, D.C., United States. It was founded as Trinity College by the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur in 1897 as the nation&#x27;s first Catholic liberal arts college for women. Trinity was chartered by an Act of Congress on August 20, 1897. An elite collegian institution in its early life, the college faced declining enrollment by the 1980s. It chose to begin recruiting local underprivileged students, and became predominantly black and Hispanic. It became Trinity Washington University in 2004.

Trinity enrolls more than 1,800 students in its undergraduate and graduate programs in the College of Arts and Sciences, School of Nursing and Health Professions, School of Education, School of Business and Graduate Studies, and School of Professional Studies. Trinity&#x27;s student body in 2020 includes about 95% ethnic minorities, including about 65% Black/African American and 30% Latina/Hispanic. Trinity is designated by the U.S. Department of Education as a Minority Serving Institution and is the only university in the D.C. region, as well as one of only a few in the nation, designated as both a Predominantly Black Institution (PBI) and Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI).
Trinity has a 97% acceptance rate with 35% of students graduating.

==History==
After its founding in 1897 as the nation&#x27;s first Catholic liberal arts college for women by the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur, Trinity educated middle-class Catholic women, who were underrepresented in America&#x27;s colleges, for more than 70 years. (For more background on women&#x27;s higher education, see Origins and types of Women&#x27;s colleges in the United States.) 

When many all-male colleges became co-ed, Trinity&#x27;s full-time enrollment dropped from 1,000 in 1969 to 300 in 1989. The school&#x27;s 12th president, Donna Jurick, responded in the early 1980s by opening a weekend college for working women from the District of Columbia, a racially diverse population the school had previously not served. The first such program in Washington, it became very popular; within three years, it had more students than the undergraduate program.

Under Patricia McGuire, a Trinity alumna, who became president of the college in 1989, Trinity became a multifaceted university that reached out to the Black and Hispanic women of Washington. McGuire split the college into three schools. The historic women&#x27;s college became the College of Arts and Sciences; the higher-revenue teacher college became the School of Education; and the continuing education classes were folded into a School of Professional Studies. Trinity began recruiting at D.C. high schools. She expanded the professional schools, whose combined enrollment rose from 639 in 1989 to 974 in 1999. By the school&#x27;s 1997 centennial, it had become the private college of choice for women from D.C. public schools.

In 2004, the college gained university status and became Trinity Washington University.

==Academics==

===Five schools===
Trinity has an annual enrollment of more than 1,800 students in the university&#x27;s five schools, which offer undergraduate and graduate degrees.

* The College of Arts and Sciences—Trinity&#x27;s historic women&#x27;s school—offers community service opportunities, athletics, student clubs, and campus activities. The College of Arts and Sciences offers a number of undergraduate academic programs, including international affairs, criminal justice, forensic psychology, journalism, and business economics.
* Trinity&#x27;s School of Education is a coeducational graduate program offering degrees in education, counseling, curriculum design, and educational administration. Through its Continuing Education Program, the School of Education also offers professional development courses enrolling 4,000 education professionals each year.
* The School of Professional Studies offers undergraduate degrees designed for women and men seeking to advance or change their careers. 
* The School of Business and Graduate Studies encompasses the graduate degree programs of Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.), Master of Science Administration (M.S.A.), and Strategic Communication and Public Relations (M.A.).
* The School of Nursing and Health Professions is home to Trinity&#x27;s nursing program, which is accredited by Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education. It also offers Master&#x27;s degrees of Occupational Therapy, Science in Nursing, and Public Health.

===Special academic programs===

Trinity offers professional programs at a satellite classroom located at THEARC, a multipurpose community facility in Southeast Washington — the only private university to offer college degree programs in the District of Columbia&#x27;s underserved neighborhoods east of the Anacostia River.

===Rankings===
In 2024, &quot;U S News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked Trinity #133-#175 out of 181 Regional Universities North.

==Student body==

Of Trinity&#x27;s more than 1,800 students, 95% were persons of color, including about 65% Black/African American and 30% Latina/Hispanic as of 2020. Ninety-four percent of the students are women, reflecting the university’s historic and ongoing commitment to women’s education.  About 80% of full-time undergraduates are eligible for Pell Grants, with a median family income of just about $25,000. Slightly more than 100 Trinity students are undocumented immigrants.

For 2023, according to the U.S. Department of Education, Trinity had a 97% acceptance rate with 35% of students graduating, 33% transferring, 30% withdrawing, and 2% still enrolled. Sixty-three percent of graduates earn more than a high school graduate. 

Trinity is designated by the U.S. Department of Education as a Minority Serving Institution and is the only university in the D.C. region, and one of only a few in the nation, designated as both a Predominantly Black Institution and Hispanic Serving Institution.

Trinity&#x27;s 2020–21 tuition for a full-time undergraduate is $24,860 for a full year. All full-time undergraduate students in the College of Arts and Sciences receive a scholarship between $10,000 and $15,000. About 80% of the undergraduate students receive Pell Grants and most D.C. students receive D.C. TAG (D.C. Tuition Assistance Grant). With additional grants and loans, the average student pays $1,000 to $2,000 out-of-pocket for tuition.

==Athletics==
The Trinity Washington athletic teams are called the Tigers. The university is a member in the Division III level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), primarily competing as an NCAA D-III Independent since the 2015–16 academic year (which they were in a previous stint from 2007–08 to 2011–12). The Tigers previously competed in these defunct conferences: the Great South Athletic Conference (GSAC) from 2012–13 to 2014–15; and the Atlantic Women&#x27;s Colleges Conference (AWCC) as a founding member from 1995–96 to 2006–07.

Trinity Washington competes in five intercollegiate varsity sports: basketball, lacrosse, soccer, tennis, and volleyball.

===Facilities===
The Trinity Center for Women and Girls in Sports was completed in 2003. It features a basketball arena; walking track; swimming pool; spa; fitness center with weight machines, free weights and cardio equipment and dance studio; tennis courts; and an athletic field. It is free for Trinity students and offers memberships to local residents.

==Campus buildings==
The campus includes the following buildings:

* Main Hall, which houses most of the administrative offices on campus, many faculty offices and classrooms, as well as the university&#x27;s admissions office, O&#x27;Connor Auditorium, and bookstore. 
* Payden Academic Center, opened in 2016, has nursing and science labs, classrooms for all disciplines and Trinity&#x27;s technology hub.
* Trinity Center for Women and Girls in Sports is an athletic, recreational, and educational complex located in the heart of Trinity&#x27;s campus.
* Sister Helen Sheehan Library holds more than 200,000 volumes.
* Alumnae Hall, the university&#x27;s dining hall, serves three meals a day throughout the academic year and is also a residence hall.
* Cuvilly Hall is a residence hall primarily for first-year students.
* Kerby Hall is a residence hall. In the 1980s, it was a residence hall for graduate students of other colleges in Washington, D.C., including Robert Casey, who studied law at Catholic University of America and later became a U.S. Senator from Pennsylvania.
* Notre Dame Chapel hosts many of Trinity&#x27;s traditions, including Academic Convocation, Freshman Medal Ceremony, Cap and Gown Mass, and Baccalaureate Mass. Dedicated in 1924, it was designed by the architectural firm Maginnis and Walsh and won a national architecture award for ecclesiastical architecture from the American Institute of Architects. It was restored in 1997 and features Guastavino tiles, stained glass windows by Charles Jay Connick and a mosaic by Bancel LaFarge. The chapel hosted the pope during his 1979 visit to the United States.

==Honor societies==

<doc id="1182125" wikidata="Q6771026" url="?curid=1182125" title="Markham Stouffville Hospital">
<text>Markham Stouffville Hospital is an acute care community hospital with two sites: the Markham site, with diagnostic and emergency services, and clinical programs in childbirth, children&#x27;s health, surgery, medicine, cancer care and mental health; and the Uxbridge site, a 20-bed hospital offering some inpatient and emergency services. In the 2019-2020 fiscal year there were almost 20,000 inpatient stays with an average length of stay of 4.6 days, and 106,000 emergency department visits.

==History==
Opened in 1990, it was created to relieve stress on York Central Hospital in Richmond Hill and hospitals in the north part of Toronto. MSH is the only hospital in Markham and one of three in south York Region. It was one of a few Greater Toronto Area hospitals dealing with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients.

In 2004, Uxbridge Cottage Hospital became a partner site with MSH.

In 2010, MSH became an affiliated and community teaching hospital linked with the University of Toronto&#x27;s Faculty of Medicine.

The original complex was built by Mathers &amp; Haldenby Architects and the current expansion by Bregman+Hamann and Perkins+Will.

==Services==
MSH is a popular hospital for ambulance re-directs from east-end Toronto hospitals with bed shortages.

Services provided at MSH:
* Acute Care
* Ambulatory Care
* Cardiorespiratory and Electrodiagnostics
* Cardiology 
* Emergency
* Maternal/Child System
* Mental Health/Inpatient Programs
* Mental Health/Outpatient Programs
* Nuclear Medicine
* Oncology
* Rehab, Palliative &amp; Complex Care
* Surgery
* Ultrasound
* Physicians / Specialist Search
* Department of Family Practice Clinics
* Department of Laboratory Service Clinics
* Diagnostic System-PACS Clinics
*Telemedicine
*Ronald McDonald Family Room - opened 2013

==Heliport==
The hospital&#x27;s helipad designation is .
An original heliport was located at the east end of the hospital to facilitate medical airlifts to and from the hospital. Transfer of patients requires a journey of approximately from the pad to the near entrance at the rear. Upon completion of the rebuilding of the hospital in 2014, the helipad is now on the roof of the new emergency wing and allows the transfer of patients directly into the hospital building. The new pad is an elevated octagon shaped pad which connects the roof of the hospital by a steel frame with a ramp to the entrance to the hospital. The relocation provides a safer landing area given that the old pad was next to public access roads around the rear of the hospital. The old pad site was removed (along with a Windsock nearby) during the re-development of the new Cornell Community Centre &amp; Library and used as a parking/storage space by construction crews.
==Bus terminal==
Markham Stouffville Hospital Terminal is a hub that connects to several YRT and Viva bus routes, and is the easternmost transit terminal in York Region. It was partly replaced by Cornell Terminal upon its opening in 2022.

=== Routes ===

Markham Stouffville Hospital connects to the following bus routes:

* Viva Purple
* YRT 1 Highway 7
* YRT 9 9th Line
* YRT 16 16th Avenue
* YRT 303 Bur Oak Express

<text>Gaspar van Weerbeke ( – after 1516) was a Netherlandish composer of the Renaissance. He was of the same generation as Josquin des Prez, but unique in his blending of the contemporary Italian style with the older Burgundian style of Dufay.

== Life ==

He was born somewhere in the diocese of Tournai, evidently out of wedlock, and was educated at Oudenaarde. While little is known of the first two decades of his life, he probably knew or studied with Johannes Regis, and he may have studied with Johannes Ockeghem; in addition it is likely he knew Dufay at the Burgundian court of Charles the Bold, since so much of his music follows in the model of the older composer. In 1471 he went to Milan, where he joined the singers of the Sforza chapel, which included Johannes Martini, Alexander Agricola, and Loyset Compère.

In 1472 and 1473 he went back north to Burgundy to find more singers for his Italian employer. Successful in his quest, he returned to Milan, and soon the Sforza chapel had one of the largest choirs in Europe. After the murder of Duke Sforza in 1476, however, the singers mostly disbanded. Weerbeke then joined the papal choir in Rome under Sixtus IV and Innocent VIII, where he remained until 1489, at which time he returned to Milan.

For the next decade Weerbeke seems to have been associated with several courts, including Milan, the court of Philip the Fair, and possibly the Medici in Florence. After 1500 he was again in Rome singing in the papal choir. The last years of his life are obscure; he may have returned to the region of his birth, for he received appointments for posts at both Cambrai and Tournai; and in addition there is a record of his possibly holding a post at St. Maria ad Gradus in Mainz in 1517.

== Music ==

Weerbeke combined the styles of the Italians with some of the older techniques of the Burgundians. He was almost alone among the Franco-Flemish composers in avoiding the smooth, imitative polyphonic style which was developing at the time, best exemplified by the music of Josquin des Prez.

He composed sacred music: masses, motets, motet cycles, a Magnificat setting, and a setting of the Lamentations, as well as a few secular chansons; but the bulk of his work is sacred vocal music. Attribution of the chansons is controversial, and many scholars believe them to have been composed by composers such as Josquin, or Jean Japart.

In style, much of his motet writing is homophonic, incorporating some of the lightness of the contemporary Italian secular music. Most of his masses are based on chanson melodies, which are stated clearly in the tenor voice, and the other voices usually move in a simple, occasionally parallel manner, related to the manner of Dufay or the other Burgundians. Once in a while Weerbeke uses imitation but never in the paired manner of Josquin or the pervasive manner of the later Franco-Flemish composers; his style of composition of masses is almost archaic in comparison to his contemporaries.

His music was much esteemed, especially in Italy, where it represented perhaps the popular aesthetic as opposed to the contrapuntal, but foreign grandeur of most of the composers from the Low Countries.

<text>&quot;Roses Are Red&quot; is a love poem and children&#x27;s rhyme with Roud Folk Song Index number 19798. It has become a cliché for Valentine&#x27;s Day, and has spawned multiple humorous and parodic variants.

A modern standard version is:

==Origins==
The rhyme builds on poetic conventions that are traceable as far back as Edmund Spenser&#x27;s epic &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; of 1590:

A rhyme similar to the modern standard version can be found in &quot;Gammer Gurton&#x27;s Garland&quot;, a 1784 collection of English nursery rhymes published in London by Joseph Johnson:

Victor Hugo was probably familiar with Spenser, but may not have known the English nursery rhyme when he published his novel &quot;Les Misérables&quot; in 1862. A song by the character Fantine contains this refrain:

In his English translation published in the same year, Charles Edwin Wilbour rendered this as:

This translation replaces the original version&#x27;s cornflowers (&quot;bleuets&quot;) with violets, and makes the roses red rather than pink, effectively making the song closer to the English nursery rhyme.

==Folklore==
The short poem has since become a snowclone, and numerous satirical versions have long circulated in children&#x27;s lore. Among them:

Country music singer Roger Miller parodied the poem in a verse of his 1964 hit &quot;Dang Me&quot;:
The Marx Brothers&#x27; film &quot;Horse Feathers&quot; has Chico Marx describing the symptoms of cirrhosis thus:

<doc id="1182145" wikidata="Q16268440" url="?curid=1182145" title="Ferrari 365 GT4 2+2, 400 and 412">
<text>The Ferrari 365 GT4 2+2, Ferrari 400 and Ferrari 412 (&quot;Tipo F101&quot;) are front-engined V12 2+2 grand tourers made by Italian manufacturer Ferrari between 1972 and 1989. The three cars are closely related, using the same body, chassis and engine evolved over time.

Following Ferrari practice, their numeric designations refer to their engines&#x27; single-cylinder displacement expressed in cubic centimetres. The 365 GT4 2+2 was introduced in 1972 to replace the 365 GTC/4. It then evolved into the 400, the first Ferrari available with an automatic transmission. In 1979 the 400 was replaced by the fuel injected 400 i. The improved 412 ran from 1985 to 1989, bringing to an end Ferrari&#x27;s longest-ever production series.

Although the option of an automatic transmission might imply it may have been designed for the American market, no version of these grand tourers was ever officially imported there as Enzo Ferrari believed that emerging environmental and safety regulations and a 55 MPH national speed limit suggested the company&#x27;s 8 cylinder cars would suffice in the US market. Many, however, entered as grey imports.
==Design==

Ferrari turned to frequent styling partner Leonardo Fioravanti at Pininfarina, whose three-box design for the 365 GT4 2+2 was a clear departure from its fastback predecessor, the 365 GTC/4. It followed Fioravanti&#x27;s Ferrari 365 GTB/4 Daytona as the second Ferrari to feature the characteristic &quot;swage line&quot; dividing the body into upper and lower halves.

Various coachbuilders, such as Carrozzeria Pavesi and Straman, offered convertible conversions of the 400 series. Switzerland&#x27;s Felber also showed a shooting brake version on 400 GT basis called the Felber Croisette at the 1981 Geneva Salon de l&#x27;Auto.
==Specifications==
The tubular steel chassis was based on that of the GTC/4, but the wheelbase was lengthened to . The bodies were steel, with a fiberglass floor; they were manufactured by Pininfarina at its Turin plant, then shipped fully finished to Modena where Ferrari assembled the cars. 
Suspension consisted of double wishbones, coil springs coaxial with the shock absorbers, and anti-roll bars all around; the rear axle featured a hydraulic self-levelling system.
Under the bonnet there was a &quot;Tipo F 101&quot; Colombo V12 that underwent many changes through the years. It was an alloy head and block, four overhead cams, 24-valve unit using wet sump lubrication.
The transmission was conventionally coupled directly to the engine, as on the GTC/4, with a driveshaft connecting it to the rear limited slip differential. The steering was servo-assisted. Brakes were discs on all four wheels.

==365 GT4 2+2==

In 1972, just a year after the launch of the GTC/4, a new 2+2 debuted at the Paris Motor Show: the 365 GT4 2+2. The name refers to the single cylinder displacement (365 cc), four overhead camshafts (GT4) and seat configuration (2+2). Most of the mechanicals, including the engine, were carried over from its predecessor. The V12 used six side-draft Weber 38 DCOE 59/60 carburetors and produced at 6200 rpm. The gearbox was a five-speed, all-synchromesh manual with a single-plate clutch.
Five-spoke alloy wheels were mounted on Rudge knock-off hubs; Borrani wire wheels were still offered at extra cost.
Fittingly for a large grand tourer, standard equipment included leather upholstery, electric windows and air conditioning. 524 units were produced, including 3 prototypes.
The GT4 was replaced in 1976 by the nearly identical looking Ferrari 400.

==400==
At the 1976 Paris Motor Show Ferrari unveiled the replacement for the 365 GT4 2+2. The new 400 was offered in two models: 400 Automatic, using a GM THM400 3-speed automatic transmission, and 400 GT, using a five-speed transmission. The 400 Automatic was the first Ferrari to have an automatic transmission.
The 365&#x27;s V12 engine had been stroked to a displacement of and given six 38 DCOE 110-111 Webers, and now produced . 0–60 mph took 7.1 seconds.

Other changes compared to the 365 GT4 2+2 included five-stud wheels to replace the knock-off hubs (Borrani spoked wheels were not offered anymore), a revised interior, the addition of a lip to the front spoiler, and double circular tail light assemblies instead of triple. A total of 502 examples were produced, 355 of which were Automatics and 147 GTs.

== 400 i==

The carburetors on the 400 were replaced with Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection in 1979. As in the smaller 308GTBi and 308GTSi, power was down to , but emissions were much improved, complying with U.S. standards. Top speed was . Initially differences between the 400 and 400 i were limited to the fuel injected engine and an &quot;i&quot; badge on the tail.

Towards the end of 1982, the 400i was updated. New camshaft profiles and exhaust headers raised engine power to . The interior was significantly revised, gaining different upholstery, door panels, centre console and new electronic switchgear.
On the exterior a narrower grille left the rectangular foglights exposed; the venting on the engine bonnet was changed from silver to body-colour. New, more elegant wing mirrors were fitted, bearing a small Ferrari shield. Around the back the tail panel was body-coloured instead of matte black, and foglamps were fitted in the bumper. Lower profile Michelin TRX tyres were adopted, on metric sized wheels.
A total of 1305 examples were produced, 883 Automatics and 422 GTs.

==412==
In 1985 further improvements were made to the series, with the launch of the Ferrari 412 (chassis &quot;Tipo F 101 EL&quot;) in April that year. The engine was bored 1 mm, for an increase in displacement to — hence the name change to 412, representing the single cylinder displacement in cubic centimetres. Both the manual and automatic transmissions were retained, but exterior badging no longer denoted the transmission type fitted. Bosch ABS was offered, a first for Ferrari.
The body was altered, with a raised rear deck granting more luggage space. Pininfarina made many subtle tweaks to modernize the exterior. The bumpers were body-coloured; at the front there was a deeper spoiler, at the rear a black valance incorporated the foglamps and exhaust pipes. Side window trim was changed from chrome to black. The flat-faced wheels were new and fitted with TRX tires.

A total of 576 examples were made. Production ended in 1989 without a direct successor being immediately launched; the mid-engined Mondial remained the only Ferrari offering 2+2 seating.
In 1992, after a three-year hiatus, the classic front-engine V12 2+2 grand tourer returned with the 456.

A black 1987 model of the 412 was used in the 2006 independent film &quot;Daft Punk&#x27;s Electroma&quot;. The car used in filming was later auctioned for charity, with the &#x27;HUMAN&#x27; license plates (in reference to the duo&#x27;s album &#x27;Human After All&#x27;, released a year before) signed by Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo, the directors of the film.


==Legacy==
Today, its sleek, Pininfarina-designed lines and relatively limited production numbers have made many enthusiasts consider it a classic. It has not been universally admired however, and is listed at #18 in the BBC&#x27;s book of &quot;Crap Cars&quot; and Jeremy Clarkson on Top Gear described it as &quot;awful in every way&quot;. However, there have been many other favorable articles about the 400 series in the motoring press, including an outlying view expressed by UK motoring journalist L. J. K. Setright in CAR magazine in August 1984, who described it as &quot;one of the few most beautiful, and one of the two most elegant, bodies ever to leave the lead of Pininfarina&#x27;s pencilling vision&quot;.

<doc id="1182164" wikidata="Q3153938" url="?curid=1182164" title="Invincible Summer">
<text>Invincible Summer is the fifth solo album by k.d. lang, released by Warner Bros. Records in 2000. The album&#x27;s title derives from a quote by Albert Camus: &quot;In the depths of winter, I finally learned that within me there lay an invincible summer.&quot;

== Critical reception ==
In an Allmusic review, Stacia Proefrock wrote &quot;Glowing with happiness and lovey bliss, this lush album is dripping with the kind of bright, slick production that hasn&#x27;t seen much light since the Brill Building&#x27;s heyday. Swelling strings, electronic bubbles and warbles, and the occasional mandolin combine to create a sound that manages to evoke a warm feeling of nostalgia without sounding retro. Topping it all off is lang&#x27;s smooth-as-maple-syrup voice, which shows even greater range than before.&quot;

In a three-and-a-half star Rolling Stone review, James Hunter wrote &quot;On &#x27;Invincible Summer,&#x27; k.d. lang reorchestrates the relaxed loveliness of Sixties Southern California pop and, to a lesser extent, Brazilian music...The music is often quick-paced fluff with the retro exactness, and the soul, of a Pottery Barn sofa. But for the most part, lang&#x27;s lighter musical tack encourages her to retire the galloping self-regard that can cancel the attractiveness of her voice.&quot;

<doc id="1182178" wikidata="Q5164736" url="?curid=1182178" title="Consumers' Research">
<text>Consumers&#x27; Research is an American conservative 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. Established in 1929, it was a founding organization in the consumer protection movement. It turned to the right after its sale in 1981 to a conservative publisher.

The organization was established by Stuart Chase and F. J. Schlink after the success of their book &quot;Your Money&#x27;s Worth&quot; galvanized interest in testing products on behalf of consumers. It published a monthly magazine called &quot;Consumers&#x27; Research Bulletin&quot;. Leading staff from this organization, thwarted in their efforts to establish a collective bargaining unit of a labor union, protested and left to form Consumers Union in 1936. The magazine published by Consumers Union, initially &quot;Consumers Union Reports&quot; and now called &quot;Consumer Reports&quot;, gained popularity and market share over the &quot;Bulletin&quot; and largely supplanted its relevance.

The organization stopped assessing products in the 1980s after its acquisition by M. Stanton Evans and was mostly dormant by the early 2000s. It was resuscitated in the 2020s as a Republican-aligned group. It has launched campaigns targeting &quot;wokeness&quot;, including &quot;woke capitalism&quot; and environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) initiatives in corporate America.

==Early history==
Consumers&#x27; Research published comparative test results on brand-name products and publicized deceptive advertising claims.

===Founding===

In 1927 Schlink and Chase, encouraged by the public response to the publishing of their book &quot;Your Money&#x27;s Worth&quot;, solicited financial, editorial, and technical support from patrons of other activist magazines to support the creation of an organization to offer consumers the unbiased services of &quot;an economist, a scientist, an accountant, and goodness knows what more.&quot; Schlink founded this organization, Consumers&#x27; Research, and migrated the existing subscriber base of a White Plains, New York organization&#x27;s &quot;Consumer&#x27;s Club Commodity List&quot; to support the &quot;Consumers&#x27; Research Bulletin&quot; published by his new organization. This was a publication with the mission to &quot;investigate, test and report reliably … hundreds of common commodities purchased.&quot; This magazine would &quot;accept no money or compensation of any kind from manufacturers, dealers, advertising agencies or other commercial enterprises.&quot; In 1927 the circulation of the bulletin was 565; by 1932 there were 42,000 subscribers. In addition to the magazine the organization also published books, pamphlets, and reports.
In 1933, Schlink and Arthur Kallet, a board member of Consumers&#x27; Research and former colleague of Schlink at the American Standards Association, published &quot;100,000,000 Guinea Pigs&quot;. The book was to become one of the best-selling books of the decade and the metaphor of consumers being guinea pigs exploited by commercial enterprises moved readers as an appropriate description of the public during the Depression. Consumers&#x27; Research moved in 1933 to Washington, New Jersey and later the Bowerstown in Washington Township, New Jersey. After the move Schlink began to take more control over the management of the organization and rapidly hired and fired many staff. When Schlink established Consumers’ Research he appointed his wife and close friends to compose the majority of seats on the board of directors, and staff noted that he held control of hiring, firing, and the organization&#x27;s editorial and budget decisions. When the organization grew the staff began to question its mission.

===Schlink&#x27;s control and resulting protests===
In 1927 at the start of publication &quot;Consumers&#x27; Research Bulletin&quot; discussed conceptual issues, but by 1934 ratings of products and guidance for purchases filled more than 75% of each issue. Around this time Chase left the organization to pursue other interests, and Schlink began to take more control over management. By 1935 Consumers’ Research had a staff of 50, used 200 consultants, and was sponsored by such respected and established journalists such as Alexander Crosby of &quot;The Nation&quot;, Arthur Kellog of &quot;The Survey&quot;, and George Soule of &quot;The New Republic&quot;. Each of these also wrote in their own magazines about consumer activism.

In the spring of 1935, the workers began to openly complain about management practices. In August 1935 many workers formed a chapter of the Technical, Editorial, and Office Assistant&#x27;s Union. In response to this, Schlink fired John Heasty, the appointed president of the union, and the union organizers responded with a strike at Consumers Research. Schlink counter-responded to the strike by hiring strikebreakers and armed security and by filing legal grievances against protestors. The negative publicity this dispute attracted pleased Consumers&#x27; Research critics.

===Kallet seeks a solution===
The positions between Consumers&#x27; Research and the strikers became more entrenched and less reconcilable, and the strikers began to have more discussions about the working conditions of employees. Arthur Kallet emerged as a leader who proposed the creation of a new organization which would evaluate products and take into account the working conditions under which those products were created. The organization proposed would also engage in and promote boycotts, educational campaigns, and have alliances with other organizations, which were activities Consumers Research avoided.

At the end of 1935, the protesters called for mediation. Reinhold Niebuhr, a religious philosopher, chaired an arbitration group which included the American Civil Liberties Union&#x27;s Roger Nash Baldwin, the educator George Counts, and the socialist Norman Thomas. Schlink rejected this arbitration and the Consumers&#x27; Research board of directors accused the strikers of being communists.

The new organization, Consumers Union, which was founded by Kallet and an Amherst College professor Colston Warne, published its first magazine &quot;Consumers Union Reports&quot; in May 1936. The previous strike was very successful at drawing attention to the protesters and the magazine was founded with public attention and support. Within two years the circulation of this new magazine surpassed the subscriptions to &quot;Consumers&#x27; Research Bulletin&quot;, which the organization continued to publish. As of 1987 it had less than 1% of the subscribers which Consumers Union&#x27;s magazine had.

===Accomplishments===
From its New Jersey location, Consumers&#x27; Research continually organized petitions to Franklin D. Roosevelt urging him to establish a federal Department of the Consumer. This department would organize all consumer protection agencies and have as goals the prevention of monopoly and prevention of fraud to consumers. Because of Consumers&#x27; Research, and women&#x27;s groups, and home economics activists, there were a Consumer Advisory Board, a labor advisory committee, and a business advisory committee in the National Recovery Administration. In 1933 Roosevelt appointed Mary Harriman Rumsey to head the Consumer Advisory Board. Caroline F. Ware, Paul Douglas, Walton Hale Hamilton, and Dexter Keezer were other consumer representatives involved in this effort.

===Legacy===
Consumers&#x27; Research was a founding organization in the consumer protection movement.

The establishment of Consumers Union, directly resulting from the staff dismissals and walkouts from Consumers&#x27; Research, was one of the major events influencing the consumer movement after World War I. Other important organizations formed in the same era were the New Deal programs aimed at promoting economic recovery after the Great Depression by increasing consumer representation in the market, with the Consumer Advisory Board within the National Recovery Administration and the Consumers&#x27; Counsel within the United States Department of Agriculture being notable among them.

==Later history==
===1980s sale and turn to conservatism===
In 1981, Consumers&#x27; Research was sold to conservative commentator M. Stanton Evans. Evans had chaired the American Conservative Union, led the National Journalism Center, and served as editor for &quot;National Review&quot; and &quot;Human Events&quot;. The organization moved its headquarters to Washington, D.C., and abandoned assessing products, closing its New Jersey testing laboratories by 1983. The organization relied on reports from the government for its articles and saw a decrease in readership for its magazine. Evans held the role of editor at the magazine until 2002.

In March 2020, Will Hild became the organization&#x27;s executive director. From 2020 to 2021, the annual budget of Consumers&#x27; Research budget increased from $800,000 to $8 million, with significant funding coming from Donors Trust, which as a donor advised fund allows for donor anonymity. The organization has become a key actor in conservative efforts to limit socially responsible investing, particularly environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) initiatives by corporations. Consumers&#x27; Research is the main donor to the Republican-led State Financial Officers Foundation.

In December 2022, Consumers&#x27; Research and 13 state attorneys general called for an investigation of the investment management firm The Vanguard Group. The investment firm caved, withdrawing its pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions and leaving the Net Zero Asset Managers Alliance coalition. Consumers&#x27; Research has also levied attacks against companies it alleges promote liberal agendas. 

===Targeting &quot;wokeness&quot;===
In 2021, Consumers&#x27; Research launched an ad campaign to combat &quot;wokeness&quot; in corporate America, targeting companies by name, including Major League Baseball, Ticketmaster, Coca-Cola, American Airlines and Nike. In 2023, Consumers&#x27; Research launched a &quot;woke alerts&quot; digital advertising campaign that has targeted companies including Target, Bank of America, Disney, BlackRock, and Anheuser-Busch, which was the subject of a consumer boycott of Bud Light in 2023 in which Consumers&#x27; Research played a central role.

In 2022, insurance company State Farm partnered with GenderCool, a group whose mission is to present positive stories about transgender and nonbinary youth, to support a program providing LGBTQ-themed children&#x27;s books to teachers and libraries in Florida. Consumers&#x27; Research ran an advertising campaign calling State Farm &quot;a creepy neighbor&quot; and accusing the insurance company of targeting children with books about gender identity. After an online uproar, State Farm dropped its support of the GenderCool partnership.

In 2022, Consumers&#x27; Research launched a multi-million dollar advertising campaign targeting BlackRock and Larry Fink over environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) investments. In 2023, Consumers&#x27; Research gave congressional leaders &quot;a detailed roadmap for dismantling the environmental, social and governance (ESG) movement,&quot; calling ESG &quot;an existential threat to our liberty.&quot; The report alleged that &quot;some of the largest asset managers in the world have leveraged Americans&#x27; savings to coerce corporations to adopt critical race theory, boycott states with Republican governments, fund employees&#x27; abortions, and divest from investment in drilling for oil and natural gas, among a wide range of other left-wing causes.&quot;

<doc id="1182187" wikidata="Q7954909" url="?curid=1182187" title="WRC-TV">
<text>WRC-TV (channel 4) is a television station in Washington, D.C., serving as the market&#x27;s NBC outlet. It is owned and operated by the network&#x27;s NBC Owned Television Stations division alongside Class A Telemundo outlet WZDC-CD (channel 44). WRC-TV and WZDC-CD share studios on Nebraska Avenue in the Tenleytown neighborhood of Northwest Washington. Through a channel sharing agreement, the stations transmit using WRC-TV&#x27;s spectrum from a tower adjacent to their studios.

==History==

The station traces its roots to experimental television station W3XNB, which was put on the air by the Radio Corporation of America, the then-parent company of NBC, in 1939. A construction permit with the commercial callsign WNBW (standing for &quot;NBC Washington&quot;) was first issued on channel 3 (60–66 MHz, numbered channel 2 prior to 1946) on December 23, 1941. NBC requested this permit to be cancelled on June 29, 1942; channel 3 was reassigned to Harrisonburg, Virginia (WHSV-TV) in 1953.

On June 27, 1947, WNBW was re-licensed on channel 4 and signed on the air. Channel 4 is the second-oldest commercially licensed television station in Washington, after WTTG (channel 5), which signed on seven months earlier in December 1946. WNBW was also the second of the five original NBC-owned television stations to sign-on, behind WNBT in New York City and ahead of WNBQ in Chicago, WNBK in Cleveland and KNBH in Los Angeles. The station was operated alongside WRC radio (980 AM, now WTEM, and 93.9 FM, now WKYS).

On October 18, 1954, the television station&#x27;s call sign changed to the present WRC-TV to match its radio sisters. The new calls reflected NBC&#x27;s ownership at the time by RCA. It has retained its &quot;-TV&quot; suffix to this day, nearly four decades after the radio stations were sold off and changed call letters.

In 1955, while in college (at the nearby University of Maryland) and serving as a puppeteer on a WRC-TV program, Jim Henson was asked to create a puppet show for the station. The series he created, &quot;Sam and Friends&quot;, was the first series to feature the Muppets, and launched the Jim Henson Company.

The second presidential debate between candidates John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon was broadcast from the station&#x27;s studios on October 7, 1960. David Brinkley&#x27;s Washington segment of the &quot;Huntley-Brinkley Report&quot; originated at WRC-TV between 1956 and 1970, as did Washington reports or commentaries by Brinkley or John Chancellor on &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; in the 1970s.

The earliest color videotape in existence is a recording of the dedication of WRC-TV&#x27;s Washington studios on May 22, 1958. President Dwight D. Eisenhower spoke at the event, introduced by NBC President Robert W. Sarnoff. Before Eisenhower spoke, Sarnoff pushed a button, which converted the previously black and white signal into color. It was also the first time a U.S. president had been videotaped in color.

At the time of its sign-on, channel 4 was one of two wholly network-owned stations in Washington, the other being DuMont&#x27;s WTTG. DuMont was shut down in 1956, and for the next 30 years, WRC-TV was Washington&#x27;s only network owned-and-operated station.

From the opening of its Nebraska Avenue facility in 1958 through 2020, WRC-TV housed NBC News&#x27; Washington bureau, out of which the network&#x27;s long-running political affairs program &quot;Meet the Press&quot; was based. In January 2021, NBC News moved the bureau near Capitol Hill.

===Telemundo affiliation===
In September 2017, NBC announced they were to launch a new Telemundo owned-and-operated station based out of WRC-TV. ZGS Communications, owner of Washington&#x27;s existing Telemundo affiliate WZDC-CD (channel 25), sold the station&#x27;s channel allocation in the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)&#x27;s 2017–18 incentive auction, accepting a $66 million payout to turn off its signal and continue operations by sharing the channel of another station. A Telemundo spokesperson stated that the sale of WZDC&#x27;s spectrum &quot;gave us the ability to take back the Telemundo affiliation for this market,&quot; without elaborating what that meant. NBC later purchased WZDC-CD with the intention of moving its over-the-air signal to that of WRC-TV through a channel-sharing agreement.

NBC took control of WZDC-CD on January 1, 2018, and added a temporary relay to WRC-TV&#x27;s digital subchannel 4.3. The channel-sharing agreement took effect on March 7, 2018. Under the agreement, WZDC shares WRC-TV&#x27;s physical signal as a subchannel would and is managed with its own virtual channel number and license. WZDC&#x27;s virtual channel changed from 25.1 to 44.1 to avoid a conflict with WDVM-TV, which also occupies virtual channel 25.1.

==Programming==

Because of its ownership by the network, WRC-TV generally carries the entire NBC network schedule, though the station airs &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; at 7 p.m. (rather than 6:30 p.m. as with most NBC stations in the Eastern Time Zone), due to an hour-long 6 p.m. newscast. The weekend edition of the network&#x27;s newscast airs at its usual 6:30 p.m. time slot. Despite being the originating station of &quot;Meet the Press&quot; for most of the show&#x27;s history, it airs on a 90-minute delay at 10:30 a.m., competing head-to-head with CBS&#x27; &quot;Face the Nation&quot;.

WRC-TV previously housed &quot;It&#x27;s Academic&quot;, which premiered in 1961 and is the longest-running game show in television history according to the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; (as of October 29, 2022, it is now aired on PBS member station WETA-TV). &quot;Sam and Friends&quot;, Jim Henson&#x27;s late-night precursor to &quot;Sesame Street&quot; and &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, got its start on WRC-TV on May 9, 1955. WRC-TV served as the production facilities for the original run of &quot;The McLaughlin Group&quot; from its premiere in 1982 until May 2008, when the production facilities moved to Tegna Inc.-owned CBS affiliate and WRC-TV&#x27;s rival WUSA and it remained until the original show&#x27;s ending in 2016.

===Sports programming===
WRC-TV was the over-the-air home of Washington Commanders (formerly the Washington Redskins) preseason games from 2009 through 2024. Before the Comcast–NBC Universal merger, games were syndicated to over-the-air stations only in standard definition, with actual rights-holder CSN Mid-Atlantic (later NBC Sports Washington, now Monumental Sports Network) exclusively airing the high definition broadcast.

===News operation===

WRC-TV presently broadcasts 45 hours, 55 minutes of locally produced newscasts each week (with 7 hours, 35 minutes each weekday; three hours on Saturdays and five hours on Sundays). By 2001, WRC&#x27;s newscasts had all been rated number one in the market, with some of the success attributed to Jim Vance and Doreen Gentzler, who anchored together from 1989 until Vance&#x27;s death in 2017. Vance had been with Channel 4 since 1969, and was promoted to anchor three years later. In the May 2010 sweeps, it placed first at 5 am, 6 a.m., 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. in total viewers, and first at 6 am, 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. in the 25–54 demo. It still leads most time slots today, although WTTG&#x27;s morning news and WJLA&#x27;s 11 p.m. news have given it much competition in the 25–54 demo.

In 1974, WRC-TV adopted the &quot;NewsCenter&quot; branding, following the three other NBC-owned stations at the time in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago in adopting the &quot;NewsCenter&quot; branding.

In 1975, the station adopted MFSB&#x27;s song &quot;My Mood&quot; as the closing theme music for the 6 p.m. newscast every Friday, which remains in use by the station today. Michael Randall commissioned the news theme for WRC-TV entitled &quot;NewsCenter Theme&quot;, which was used by the station until 1986; also, Charlie Rose was hired by WRC-TV after his short stint at KXAS-TV in Dallas and hosted the &quot;Charlie Rose Show&quot; from its premiere in 1980 until he left the station in 1984 for CBS News. The station also hired George Michael as sports anchor, eventually launching the nationally syndicated program &quot;The George Michael Sports Machine&quot;, which originated from the studios of WRC-TV from its entire run from 1984 until 2007 (&quot;The George Michael Sports Machine&quot; was distributed by the station&#x27;s sister company NBCUniversal Television Distribution).

In 1982, after 8 years of using the &quot;NewsCenter&quot; branding, the news branding was changed to &quot;Channel 4 News&quot;. The station added a 5 p.m. newscast in 1984. On September 7, 1987, the station changed its news branding to &quot;News 4&quot;. In 1989, the station used a new promotional campaign &quot;We Work Well Together&quot;, produced by Music Oasis, which was also adopted as its news theme until 1992. In 1991, WRC-TV added a morning newscast under the title of &quot;News 4 Today&quot;. From January 14 to October 25, 1991, the station also produced a 7:30 p.m. newscast for then-independent station WFTY (now CW affiliate WDCW) entitled &quot;7:30 News Headlines&quot;. The newscast suffered low ratings throughout its run.

In 1993, the station adopted the news music theme entitled &quot;Working 4 You&quot;, which also serves as a current station slogan for News 4. In 1994, WRC-TV expanded a late weekday newscast from 4:30 p.m. to a full-hour at 4 p.m. 615 Music remixed the theme in 1997, this time under the title of &quot;Working For You&quot;. The theme was also used by other NBC affiliates (including WHO-TV in Des Moines, Iowa, KPLC in Lake Charles, Louisiana, WPSD-TV in Paducah, Kentucky, and WEAU in Eau Claire, Wisconsin). In 2002, WRC-TV adopted &quot;The Tower&quot; news theme commissioned by 615 Music from Chicago sister station WMAQ-TV with the notes of the &quot;Working For You&quot; theme as a musical trademark added only in the news opens. The &quot;Working For You&quot; theme continued to be used as a closing theme for all of its newscasts. Both &quot;Working For You&quot; and &quot;The Tower V.1 with Working For You&quot; were both in use by the station until 2008, when they switched to Gari Media Group&#x27;s &quot;The NBC Collection&quot; now with added notes of the &quot;Working For You&quot; theme.

On January 14, 2009, WRC-TV and WTTG entered into a Local News Service (called LNS) agreement in which the two stations pool video and share news helicopter footage. The agreement is similar to ones already made between Fox and NBC owned-and-operated stations in Chicago (WMAQ-TV and WFLD) and Philadelphia (WCAU and WTXF). WUSA later joined that agreement. In 2012, News Director Camille Edwards announced the station would no longer participate in LNS, but the stations would continue to share the helicopter. In 2016, the station launched its own helicopter, Chopper4.

On April 8, 2010, the station began test broadcasts of its news programming in high definition during local news updates seen during &quot;Today&quot;; regular newscasts continued to be broadcast in standard definition. WRC-TV started broadcasting its newscasts from a temporary set on February 8, 2010, while &quot;upgrades&quot; were being made on its main set and the station made final adjustments for its switch to high definition. On April 22, 2010, WRC became the fourth (and final) English-language television station in the Washington, D.C. market to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition. It is the only station in the Washington market that shoots most of its remote field video in 16:9 widescreen; other stations still shoot live field video in 4:3 and then either pillarbox or stretch this content to widescreen—though WRC&#x27;s field video is shot in standard definition.

On September 15, 2014, the station&#x27;s newscasts shifted to a full 16:9 widescreen presentation, therefore becoming the third English-language television station in the Washington, D.C. market to do so, following Tegna-owned CBS affiliate WUSA (January 2013) and Fox-owned WTTG (August 2013). In conjunction with this, the newscast title was changed to a variation of the station&#x27;s NBC 4 logo and also, its longtime newscast theme music was heavily updated. Also, the station&#x27;s &quot;Look F&quot; graphics package from NBC ArtWorks, which was introduced 2 years earlier (May 2012), was reformatted for the 16:9 presentation.

On June 29, 2016, the station officially began using the &quot;Look N&quot; graphics package that was first adopted by sister station WNBC (which began using the package on June 11), becoming the sixth NBC-owned station to use this package, following WVIT (June 13), WTVJ (also on June 13), KXAS-TV (June 20) and WMAQ-TV (testing on June 21; full usage beginning June 28).

On July 31, 2017, WRC-TV became the first station in Washington, D.C. to expand its morning newscasts to 4 am. In May 2018, after 10 years of using &quot;The NBC Collection with Working for You&quot; news theme, the station brought back 615 Music&#x27;s &quot;The Tower&quot; news theme, this time without the famous &quot;Working for You&quot; musical trademark; the news theme was previously used with the &quot;Working for You&quot; signature only in the news opens from 2002 until 2008; the theme has also been used by sister station WVIT since 2016.

On October 19, 2021, WRC-TV became the last station in the group to introduce their &quot;Look S&quot; graphics, beginning with the 4 p.m. newscast.

Starting with &quot;News 4 Today&quot; on February 27, 2023, WRC-TV&#x27;s newscasts moved to a new studio that formerly housed &quot;Meet the Press&quot;, where an entirely new set debuted for the first time in almost 13 years.

On September 9, 2024, WRC-TV&#x27;s morning newscast moved its starting time back to 4:25 am, leaving WTTG as the only station in the Washington market to start its morning newscast at 4 a.m.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WRC-TV ended regular programming on its analog signal, on VHF channel 4, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal continued to broadcast on its pre-transition UHF channel 48, using virtual channel 4.

The station participated in the &quot;Analog Nightlight&quot; program, with its analog signal carrying information on the digital transition until analog signal broadcasts were permanently discontinued on June 26, 2009.

Beginning in 1996, WRC-TV&#x27;s studios were the home of WHD-TV, an experimental high definition television station owned by a consortium of industry groups and stations which carried the nation&#x27;s first program in the format transmitted by a television station, an episode of &quot;Meet the Press&quot;, and aired on UHF channel 34 to provide the FCC and the National Association of Broadcasters a channel to conduct many experiments in the new format. WHD-TV was discontinued around 2002.

<text>The Dino 308 GT4 and 208 GT4 (later Ferrari 308 GT4 and 208 GT4) are mid-engined V8 2+2 cars built by Ferrari. The Dino 308 GT4 was introduced in 1973 and supplemented by the 208 GT4 in 1975. The cars were sold with Dino badging (continuing the Dino brand to differentiate non-V12 Ferrari) until May 1976, when they received Ferrari badging. It was the first production Ferrari to feature the rear mid-engined V8 layout that would become the bulk of the company&#x27;s business in the succeeding decades. The GT4 was replaced by the Mondial 8 in 1980 after a production run of 2,826 308s and 840 208s.

==Design==

The GT4 was the first production Ferrari with Bertone rather than Pininfarina designed bodywork. Pininfarina was upset by the decision to give cross-town rival Bertone the design, considering all they had done for Ferrari.

The design has sharp, angular shapes, entirely in contrast to its delicately curvaceous two-seater predecessor, the Dino 246 GT and GTS, and was controversial at the time. Journalists compared it to the Bertone-designed Lancia Stratos and especially the Lamborghini Urraco – all were designed by Marcello Gandini, and Lamborghini had quickly become one of Ferrari&#x27;s foremost competitors. The Dino 308 GT4 exactly copied the Urraco&#x27;s layout, and styled by the same designer, it looked rather similar. Gandini was since not again hired for the design of a Ferrari.

From the cockpit the driver sees only the road. Enzo Ferrari himself took a major role in its design, even having a mock-up made where he could sit in the car to test different steering, pedals and cockpit seating positioning.

==Specifications==

The chassis was a tubular spaceframe based on the Dino 246, but was stretched for a wheelbase to make room for the second row of seats. The suspension was fully independent, with double wishbones, anti-roll bars, coaxial telescopic shock absorbers and coil springs on both axles. There are claims that Niki Lauda was involved in suspension setup prior to joining Ferrari which could have levered his aim to be the main Ferrari driver in F1. That is incorrect as Lauda denied it, having not joined Ferrari until after the launch of the GT4, and the final specification would have been decided some time before that. The confusion lies in advertising by the USA importer Chinetti, which wrongly claimed Lauda&#x27;s involvement. Some creative licence was used when sales were difficult.

The 2.9 L (2927 cc) V8 was mounted transversally integrally joined with the 5-speed transaxle gearbox. It was fitted with 205/70VR14 Michelin XWX tires and 195/70R14 tyres on the 208 GT4. The engine had an aluminium alloy block and heads, 16 valves and dual overhead camshafts driven by toothed belts; it produced in the European version and in the American. The induction system used four Weber 40 DCNF carburetors.
==308 GT4==

The Dino 308 GT4 was introduced at the Paris Motor Show in October 1973. Its chassis number was 07202 and it was the only example produced that year. It was painted in Azzurro Metallizzato (Light Blue Metallic).

The 308 GT4 later went on sale as a 1974 model and gained the &quot;Prancing Horse&quot; badge in May 1976, which replaced the Dino badges on the hood, wheels, rear panel and the steering wheel while retaining the Dino 308GT4 logo on the rear boot lid. This has caused major confusion over the years by owners, enthusiasts and judges. During the energy crisis at that time many prospective owners were hesitant to buy such an expensive automobile not badged &quot;Ferrari&quot;, being confused at the significance of the Dino name. Dino was Enzo Ferrari&#x27;s son who died in 1956, and his name was to honor his memory on the models it was placed. 

In an effort to improve sales until the 1976 official re-badging, Ferrari sent out factory update #265/1 on July 1, 1975 with technical and cosmetic revisions in many areas. Some of these revisions were implemented piecemeal by dealers. Some made all the revisions while some just made a few. This leaves many 1975 GT4&#x27;s with a variety of modifications which are hard to document as &quot;correct&quot; to aficionados who may not understand the complicated series of events surrounding this model year. Some of the revisions included adding Prancing Horse badges, repainting in the Boxer two-tone scheme (lower half painted matte black), air conditioning fixes, etc. It also included bumper modification and exhaust changes for North American versions. The Dino 308 GT4 was the only Ferrari legally imported to the US in 1975, and it was also the year Niki Lauda won the Formula One drivers championship and Ferrari won the constructors title.
The GT4 was the only 2+2 Ferrari ever raced with factory support.

There were two series of GT4; the earlier cars featured a twin distributor engine and fog lamps mounted in the front valance. The so called Series 2 cars ahd a wider and shallower grille with fog lamps mounted behind, European versions changed to a single distributor while USA and Australian cars continued with twin distributors, each with 2 sets of points, but European cars changed to a single distributor. On European cars Magneti Marelli electronic ignition was fitted from July 1978.

The series 2 cars had Cavallino Rampante badging on the nose and steering wheel and road wheel centres. The Dino 308GT4 logo remained on the boot/trunk lid and the Dino script continued on the instrument dials and the air vents. The revised sales brochure made no mention of Dino but was branded Ferrari. The chassis numbering sequence continued with even numbers, as started with the earlier Dinos, while the by now concurrent 308GTB/S had reverted to the traditional odd numbered chassis for road cars.

The Dino brand experiment had come to an end.

==208 GT4==

Introduced at the Geneva Motor Show in 1975, the 208 GT4 was a low-displacement version of the V8 produced for the Italian market, where cars with engines larger than two litres were subjected to more than double VAT (38%). The engine was de-bored to (66.8 by 71 mm) 2.0 L (1991 cc) V8, resulting in the smallest production V8 in history for a road car.

Power output is at 7700 rpm for a top speed of . Smaller Weber 34 DCNF carburetors, a lower final drive ratio and skinnier tires completed the technical changes for the 208. Chrome (rather than black) accents outside and the lack of fog lights were external visual indicators of the smaller-engined GT4. Inside the 208 GT4 featured a black rather than silver dash facing.

The 208 GTB replaced the 208 GT4 in 1980, after only 840 cars had been built.

<text>CSS &quot;Jamestown&quot;, originally a side-wheel, passenger steamer, was built at New York City in 1853, and seized at Richmond, Virginia in 1861 for the Virginia Navy during the early days of the American Civil War. She was commissioned by the Confederate States Navy (CSN) the following July (after the Virginia Navy was transferred to the CSN), and renamed CSS &quot;Thomas Jefferson&quot; but was generally referred to as &quot;Jamestown&quot;, after Jamestown, Virginia.

Brigantine-rigged &quot;Jamestown&quot; was designed and constructed by the well-known shipbuilder William H. Webb for the New York and Old Dominion Line as a sister to &quot;Yorktown&quot;, which became CSS &quot;Patrick Henry&quot;.

==Career==
With Lt. Joseph Nicholson Barney, CSN, in command, she was actively employed until the end of her career in May 1862. Her service was highlighted by the Battle of Hampton Roads on March 8–9 1862, during which she assisted CSS &quot;Virginia&quot; in attacking USS &quot;Congress&quot; and USS &quot;Cumberland&quot; and stood by during the battle between USS &quot;Monitor&quot; and &quot;Virginia&quot;. The Confederate Congress tendered special thanks to the officers and crew of &quot;Jamestown&quot; for their &quot;gallant conduct and bearing&quot; in combat.

Some 4 weeks later, on April 11, 1862, &quot;Jamestown&quot;, &quot;Virginia&quot; and five other Confederate ships sailed from Norfolk, Virginia, into Hampton Roads in full view of the Union squadron there. When it became clear that the Federal ships were not going to attack, &quot;Jamestown&quot;, covered by &quot;Virginia&quot; and the others, moved in, captured three merchant ships, and helped by CSS &quot;Raleigh&quot;, towed them to Norfolk. The merchant ships were the brigs &quot;Marcus of Stockton, NJ&quot; and &quot;Sabout of Providence, RI&quot; and the schooner &quot;Catherine T. Dix&quot; of Accomac County, VA. Their flags were hoisted &quot;Union-side down&quot; to taunt the Federals into fighting. Later that month &quot;Jamestown&quot; was despatched from Norfolk to cooperate with Major General John B. Magruder, CSA, in the James River, and early in May she was used to transport army sick and wounded to Richmond, Virginia.
On the night of May 5, &quot;Jamestown&quot; and &quot;Patrick Henry&quot; proceeded to Norfolk and returned the following night with CSS &quot;Richmond&quot;, CSS &quot;Hampton&quot; and store boats, passing the Federal battery at Newport News, Virginia unobserved on both occasions. A second attempt to return to Norfolk met with failure.
On May 8, &quot;Jamestown&quot; was ordered to notify Stephen Mallory, Secretary of the Confederate States Navy, of the continuing engagement of two Federal gunboats and ironclad USS &quot;Galena&quot; with the Confederate batteries at Day&#x27;s Point. Unable to carry out her assignment, &quot;Jamestown&quot; retired up the James River as far as Drewry&#x27;s Bluff, where on May 15, 1862, she was sunk to obstruct the channel.

==Commanders==
The commanders of the CSS &quot;Jamestown&quot; were:
* Lt. Joseph Nicholson Barney (1861–1862)
* Lt. George W. Harrison (May 1862, temporarily)

<text>Rubye Rose Blevins (October 30, 1908 – May 3, 1996), known professionally as Patsy Montana, was an American country and western singer and songwriter. Montana was the first female country performer to have a million-selling single with her signature song &quot;I Want to Be a Cowboy&#x27;s Sweetheart&quot;, and is a member of the Country Music Hall of Fame.

==Biography==
Ruby Blevins (she added an &quot;e&quot; to Ruby in her late teens) was born in Beaudry, Arkansas, United States, and grew up near Hope. She had ten siblings, all of them boys, However, two died early from an accidental fire.

In 1929, Blevins went to California to study violin at the University of the West (UCLA). She won a local talent contest with her singing, yodelling, and playing the guitar and first prize was an opportunity to play on the &quot;Hollywood Breakfast Club&quot; radio program.

In the summer of 1933, Blevins went with two of her brothers to the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair. The trip&#x27;s mission was to enter a large, prize watermelon the Blevins had raised, and Rubye was invited to go, mainly to meet up with two pen pals, Millie and Dolly Good (The Girls of the Golden West). While in Chicago, she auditioned for a crooner&#x27;s role. However, she began laughing halfway through the song. The producer on hand fell in love with her &quot;giggle&quot; and auditioned her instead at WLS-AM for a group called the Prairie Ramblers. Blevins and the Ramblers became regulars on WLS&#x27;s &quot;National Barn Dance&quot; program. The Prairie Ramblers also backed Blevins on most of her hits with ARC Records, Decca, and RCA Victor.
In 1934, Blevins&#x27; repertoire included &quot;Montana Plains&quot;, a reworking of a song originally called &quot;Texas Plains&quot;. Blevins further altered the composition, which became her signature song, &quot;I Want to Be a Cowboy&#x27;s Sweetheart&quot;. Released in 1935, the song made Blevins the first female country recording artist to have a million seller. Blevins performed on &quot;National Barn Dance&quot; until the 1950s, and worked with Gene Autry, Pat Buttram, Red Foley, the Girls of the Golden West and George Gobel.

Blevins took her stage name from silent film star and world-champion roper Monte Montana, with whom she had an opportunity to work early in her career. She made one feature-length movie called &quot;Colorado Sunset&quot; with Smiley Burnette and Gene Autry.

&quot;Barn Dance&quot; also introduced her to her future husband, Paul E. Rose. Rose was a stage manager for Gene Autry at the time, and was always around when Autry was performing, which just so happened to be when Patsy was performing. According to Patsy (as she was by this time called by everyone who knew her), they were the &quot;only two single people involved with the show and kinda got thrown together.&quot; Though Rose was around five years her junior, they married on July 3, &quot;honeymooned,&quot; and July 4 went their separate ways on different tours. Two weeks later they were again united, but throughout their married life they often followed this pattern. The couple had two daughters, Beverly and Judy. Montana and her two daughters later appeared as the Patsy Montana Trio.
After semi-retiring in the late 1950s to spend more time with her family, Montana attempted a comeback in 1964. She released an album on the Sims label in Arizona, notable for having Waylon Jennings as lead guitar player before he made his national debut. The album was later re-released by Starday Records. She influenced later singers Patsy Cline and Dottie West, and more recently, Western music star Devon Dawson, the singing voice of &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;&#x27;s Jessie the Yodeling Cowgirl. 
Montana&#x27;s signature song, &quot;I Want to Be a Cowboy&#x27;s Sweetheart&quot;, appears over the end credits of John Sayles&#x27;s 1996 film &quot;Lone Star&quot;, which was released just weeks after Montana&#x27;s death.

Montana died on May 3, 1996, at her home in San Jacinto, California. As Paul Rose served in the United States Army, she is buried at Riverside National Cemetery in Riverside, California. She was inducted into the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame in Fort Worth, Texas, in 1987 and in the Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville, Tennessee, in 1996.

<text>The Soviet NKVD Order No. 00485 was an anti-Polish ethnic cleansing campaign issued on August 11, 1937, which laid the foundation for the systematic elimination of the Polish minority in the Soviet Union between 1937 and 1938. The order was called &quot;On the liquidation of Polish sabotage and espionage groups and units of the POW&quot; (POW stands for Polish Military Organization, Polska Organizacja Wojskowa) (). It is dated August 9, 1937, was issued by the Central Committee Politburo (VKP b), and signed by Nikolai Yezhov, the People&#x27;s Commissar for Internal Affairs. The operation was at the center of the national operations of the NKVD, and the largest ethnically motivated shooting action of the Great Terror.

==Arrests and executions==

According to the order, the entire operation was to be completed in three months. Subject to arrest and immediate elimination were persons of the following categories: &quot;prisoners of war from the Polish army who after the 1920 war had remained in the Soviet Union, deserters and political émigrés from Poland (such as Polish communists admitted through prisoners&#x27; exchange), former members of the Polish Socialist Party (PPS) and other anti-Soviet political parties; and the inhabitants of Polish districts in border regions.&quot; The order was supplemented by a secret letter from Yezhov, specifying the various accusations to be used against the Polish minority, which were fabricated by the Moscow NKVD executive. The order aimed at the arrest of &quot;absolutely all Poles&quot; and confirmed that &quot;the Poles should be completely destroyed&quot;. Member of the NKVD Administration for the Moscow District, A. O. Postel (Арон Осипович Постель) explained that although there was no word-for-word quote of &quot;all Poles&quot; in the actual Order, that was exactly how the letter was to be interpreted by the NKVD executioners.

Particularly affected were Poles employed in the so-called &quot;strategic&quot; sectors of the economy such as transportation and telecommunications (e.g., railway engineers and postal workers), the defense industry, the armed forces, and the security services, as well as members of Polish cultural organizations.&lt;ref name=&quot;hoover/pdf&quot;&gt;The Great Terror (Chapter 4) – from: &quot;Stalin&#x27;s Loyal Executioner: People&#x27;s Commissar Nikolai Ezhov, 1895–1940&quot; by Marc Jansen and Nikita Petrov, pp. 95 (17 / 33). Internet Archive.&lt;/ref&gt; The Order created an extrajudicial sentencing body composed of two NKVD soldiers, the so-called &quot;Dvoika&quot; (twosome) completing the paperwork. The Order also established the so-called &quot;album procedure&quot; of convictions: the lists of convicted already during the initial investigations by lower NKVD organs were compiled into &quot;albums&quot; by the mid-rank NKVD organs and sent to the NKVD for approval. After the approval, the convictions (shooting or imprisonment) were immediately put into effect.

A similar procedure was applied to all other national operations of 1937–1938: German, Latvian, Finnish, Estonian, Romanian, Greek, and others. The procedure was amended in September 1938. To expedite the process, regional NKVD units were instructed to set up so-called &quot;Special Troikas&quot; (not to be confused with the regional Troikas established under the NKVD Order No. 00447) authorized to try the &quot;national operations&quot; cases locally.

According to official Soviet state documents, the anti-Polish operation of the NKVD affected 139,815 people, 111,071 of whom were condemned to death without trial and executed immediately afterwards.

<doc id="1182243" wikidata="Q1073120" url="?curid=1182243" title="Mark tree">
<text>A mark tree (also known as a nail tree, chime tree, or bar chimes) is a percussion instrument used primarily for musical color. It consists of many small chimes—typically cylinders of solid aluminum or brass tubing about 3/8&quot; in diameter—of varying lengths, hung from a bar. They are played by sweeping a finger or stick through the length of the hanging chimes. They are typically mounted in pitch order to produce rising or falling glissandos. More expensive models may also have a damper bar. Unlike tubular bells, another form of chime, the chimes on a mark tree do not produce definite pitches.

The mark tree is named after its inventor, studio percussionist Mark Stevens, who devised it in 1967. When he could not come up with a name, percussionist Emil Richards named it after Stevens. Mark trees are colloquially called wind chimes in some modern repertoire. However, the mark tree and wind chimes are two separate instruments, differing in construction and manner of sounding.

<doc id="1182244" wikidata="Q5264377" url="?curid=1182244" title="Design science revolution">
<text>R. Buckminster Fuller coined the term design science revolution to describe his proposed scientific and socio-economic revolution accomplished by shifting from &quot;weaponry to livingry&quot; through the application of what he called &quot;comprehensive anticipatory design science&quot;. His &quot;World Design Science Decade,&quot; proposed to the International Union of Architects in 1961, was an attempt to catalyze the revolution.

Fuller advocated the design science revolution as an alternative to politics, seeking to optimize planetary resources for the benefit of 100% of humanity. He coined the term &quot;synergetics&quot; to explain how design science could create rich returns, such as how &quot;energy income&quot; could be harvested from the environment. His main premise was that nature&#x27;s existing and omnipotent order must be allowed to guide human designs, if they are to survive and thrive as a species. He wrote that humanity was approaching its critical test as a species, in which it would be determined whether or not man was a mistake of nature, or its greatest accomplishment. This sense of urgency for the design science revolution was reflected in numerous writings:&quot;The Dark Ages still reign over all humanity, and the depth and persistence of this domination are only now becoming clear. This prison has no steel bars, chains, or locks. Instead, it is locked by misorientation and built of misinformation. We are powerfully imprisoned ... by the terms in which we have been conditioned to think.&quot;&quot;There is now plenty for all. War is obsolete. It is imperative that we get the word to all humanity — RUSH — before someone ignorantly pushes the button that provokes pushing of all the buttons.&quot;Fuller insisted that the key principle of the design science revolution was to recognize nature &quot;as&quot; technology:&quot;In its complexities of design integrity, the Universe is technology. The technology evolved by man is thus far amateurish compared to the elegance of nonhumanly contrived regeneration. Man does not spontaneously recognize technology other than his own, so he speaks of the rest as something he ignorantly calls nature.&quot; He stressed that by utilizing these natural principles of technology, industrial civilization could transform from an extractive to a regenerative force within the context of Earth&#x27;s ecosystems. Operationally, he viewed design science as the integration of natural principles within the utilization of planetary resources to achieve ever-increasing ephemeralization:&quot;Amongst other grand strategies for making the world work and taking care of everybody is the design science revolution of providing ever more effective tools and services with ever less, real resource investment per each unit of end performance. For instance, a communications satellite, weighing only one-quarter of a ton, is now out-performing the transoceanic communication capabilities of 175 thousand tons of copper cable.&quot;

<doc id="1182245" wikidata="Q7249398" url="?curid=1182245" title="Project delivery method">
<text>Project delivery methods defines the characteristics of how a construction project is designed and built and the responsibilities of the parties involved in the construction (owner, designer and contractor). They are used by a construction manager who is working as an agent to the owner or by the owner itself to carry-out a construction project while mitigating the risks to the scope of work, time, budget, quality and safety of the project. These risks ranges from cost overruns, time delays and conflict among the various parties. 

== History==
=== Trends in delivery methods ===
Though DBB is now used for most private projects and the majority of public projects, it has not historically been the predominant delivery method of choice. The master builders of centuries past acted both as designers and constructors for both public and private clients. In the United States, Zane&#x27;s Post Road in Ohio and the IRT in New York City were both originally developed under more integrated delivery methods, as were most infrastructure projects until 1933. Integrated Project Delivery offers a new delivery method to remove considerable waste from the construction process while improving quality and a return to more collaborative methods from the past. 
In an effort to assist industry professionals with the selection of appropriate project delivery systems, construction management researchers have prepared a Procurement Method and Contract Selection Model, which can be used for high level decision making for construction projects on a case-by-case basis.

== Types ==

Common project delivery methods include:

=== Design-Bid-Build (DBB) or Design-Award-Build (DAB) ===
:In Design-Bid-Build, owner develops contract documents with an architect or an engineer consisting of a set of blueprints and a detailed specification. Bids are solicited from contractors based on these documents; a contract is then awarded to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder. This is the traditional model for public sector infrastructure projects.

==== DBB with Construction Management (DBB with CM) ====
:DBB with Construction Management is a modified version of the Design-bid-build approach With partially completed contract documents, an owner will hire a construction manager to act as an agent. As substantial portions of the documents are completed, the construction manager will solicit bids from suitable subcontractors. This allows construction to proceed more quickly and allows the owner to share some of the risk inherent in the project with the construction manager.

=== Design-Build (DB) or Design-Construct (DC) ===
:In Design-Build, an owner develops a conceptual plan for a project, then solicits bids from joint ventures of architects and/or engineer and builders for the design and construction of the project. This is an alternative to the traditional model for public infrastructure projects that does not involve Private Financing.

==== Design-Build-Operate-Maintain (DBOM) ====
:DBOM takes DB one step further by including the operations and maintenance of the completed project in the same original contract

=== Integrated Project Delivery (IPD) ===
:Integrated Project Delivery seeks to involve all participants (people, systems, business structures and practices) through all phases of design, fabrication, and construction, with the goal of improving project efficiency and reducing &quot;waste&quot; in project delivery (i.e. any processes that do no directly add value to the final product). IPD is closely associated with the philosophy of Lean construction.

==== Job Order Contracting (JOC) ====
:A form of Integrated Project Delivery (IPD) specifically for repair, renovation, maintenance, sustainability, and &quot;minor&quot; new construction. Each job order contract uses a Unit Price Book for pricing each job via a multi-year umbrella contract.

=== Public-private partnership (PPP, 3P, or P3) ===
:A public–private partnership is a cooperative arrangement between one or more public entities (typically the owner) and another (typically private sector) entity to design, build, finance, and at times operate and maintain, the project for a specified period of time on behalf of the owner. &quot;A minima&quot;, public-private partnership refers to the idea of cooperation between the public sector and the Private sector. 

:The following models are usually used for P3 projects, though they are also sometimes used for private sector projects.

====Build-Finance (BF)====

:The private actor builds the asset and finances the cost during the construction period, afterwards the responsibility is handed over to the public entity. In terms of private-sector risk and involvement, this model is again on the lower end of the spectrum for both measures.

==== Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) ====
:Build-Operate-Transfer represents a complete integration of the project delivery: the same contract governs the design, construction, operations, maintenance, and financing of the project. After some concessionary period, the facility is transferred back to the owner.

==== Build–own–operate–transfer (BOOT) ====
:A BOOT structure differs from BOT in that the private entity owns the works. During the concession period, the private company owns and operates the facility with the prime goal to recover the costs of investment and maintenance while trying to achieve a higher margin on the project. BOOT has been used in projects like highways, roads mass transit, railway transport and power generation.

==== Build–own–operate (BOO) ====
:In a BOO project ownership of the project remains usually with the project company, such as a mobile phone network. Therefore, the private company gets the benefits of any residual value of the project. This framework is used when the physical life of the project coincides with the concession period. A BOO scheme involves large amounts of finance and long payback period. Some examples of BOO projects come from the water treatment plants.

==== Build–lease–transfer (BLT) ====
:Under BLT, a private entity builds a complete project and leases it to the government. In this way the control over the project is transferred from the project owner to a lessee. In other words, the ownership remains by the shareholders but operation purposes are leased. After the expiry of the leasing the ownership of the asset and the operational responsibility is transferred to the government at a previously agreed price.

====Design-Build-Finance-Maintain (DBFM) ==== 
:&quot;The private sector designs, builds and finances an asset and provides hard facility management or maintenance services under a long-term agreement.&quot; The owner (usually the public sector) operates the facility. This model is in the middle of the spectrum for private sector risk and involvement.

====Design–build–finance–operate-maintain (DBFOM) or Design–build–finance–maintain-operate (DBFMO)====

:Design–build–finance–operate-maintain (DBFOM) also referred to as Design–build–finance–maintain-operate (DBFMO) is a project delivery method very similar to BOOT except that there is no actual ownership transfer. Moreover, the contractor assumes the risk of financing until the end of the contract period. The owner then assumes the responsibility for maintenance and operation. This model is extensively used in specific infrastructure projects such as toll roads. The private construction company is responsible for the design and construction of a piece of infrastructure for the government, which is the true owner. Moreover, the private entity has the responsibility to raise finance during the construction and the exploitation period.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www-esd.worldbank.org/pbc_resource_guide/Docs-latest%20edition/cases-and-pdfs/pakkalae5.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, the public sector begins payments to the private sector for use of the asset post-construction. This is the most commonly used model in the EU according to the European Court of Auditors.

==== Design–build–operate–transfer (DBOT) ====
:This funding option is common when the client has no knowledge of what the project entails. Hence the project is contracted to a company to design, build, operate, and then transfer it. Examples of such projects are refinery constructions.

==== Design–construct–manage–finance (DCMF) ====
:A private entity is entrusted to design, construct, manage, and finance a facility, based on the specifications of the government. Project cash flows result from the government&#x27;s payment for the rent of the facility. Some examples of the DCMF model are prisons or public hospitals.
== Conceptual differences between delivery methods ==
There are two key variables which account for the bulk of the variation between delivery methods:
* The extent of the integration of the various service providers.
* The extent to which the owner is directly financing the project.

When the various service providers are segmented, the owner has the most control, but this control is costly and does not give each provider an incentive to optimize its contribution for the next service. When there is tight integration amongst providers, each step of the delivery is undertaken with future activities in mind, resulting in cost savings, but limiting the owner&#x27;s influence throughout the project.

The owner&#x27;s direct financing of a project simply means that the owner directly pays the providers for their services. In the case of a facility with a consistent revenue stream, indirect financing becomes possible: rather than be paid by the owner, the providers are paid with the revenue collected from the facility&#x27;s operation.

Indirect financing risks being mistaken for privatization. Though the providers do have a concession to operate and collect revenue from a facility that they built and financed, the structure itself remains the property of the owner (usually a government agency in the case of public infrastructure).

<doc id="1182250" wikidata="Q329193" url="?curid=1182250" title="George Axelrod">
<text>George Axelrod (June 9, 1922 – June 21, 2003) was an American screenwriter, producer, playwright and film director, best known for his play &quot;The Seven Year Itch&quot; (1952), which was adapted into a film of the same name starring Marilyn Monroe. Axelrod was nominated for an Academy Award for his 1961 adaptation of Truman Capote&#x27;s &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot; and also adapted Richard Condon&#x27;s &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; (1962).

==Early life and family==
Axelrod was born in New York City, the son of Beatrice Carpenter, a silent film actress, and Herman Axelrod, a Columbia graduate who had worked on the school&#x27;s annual Varsity Show with Oscar Hammerstein and who later went into real estate. His father was Russian Jewish and his mother was of Scottish and English descent. He was the father of lawyer Peter Axelrod; Steven Axelrod, painting contractor and writer; Nina Axelrod, actress; and stepfather of screenwriter Jonathan Axelrod (who married the actress Illeana Douglas). George Axelrod is the grandfather of actor Taliesin Jaffe.

== Career ==

===Radio and Broadway===
Early in his career, Axelrod worked in summer stock theater as a stage manager and an occasional actor. During World War II, he was a member of the U.S. Army Signal Corps. When he returned to civilian life, he wrote for &quot;The Shadow&quot;, &quot;Midnight&quot;, &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot;, and other radio programs. With the advent of television, he wrote for that medium, too, eventually working on more than 400 TV and radio scripts. Comedians for whom he wrote included Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin Axelrod wrote the 1952 stage comedy, &quot;The Seven Year Itch&quot;, a risqué social satire about a middle-class man who has an affair while his wife and children are on vacation. &quot;The Seven Year Itch&quot; was first presented by Courtney Burr and Elliot Nugent at the Fulton Theatre, New York City, on July 15, 1952.

===Television===
Axelrod&#x27;s overnight success prompted him to write a seriocomic teleplay, &quot;Confessions of a Nervous Man&quot;, starring Art Carney as a playwright waiting anxiously in a Theater District bar for the newspaper reviews of his first play to hit the streets. Based on his own experiences on the opening night of &quot;The Seven Year Itch&quot;, the one-hour play was presented as the November 30, 1953, episode of &quot;Studio One&quot;. He appeared on television himself occasionally as a guest panelist on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;

===Films===
The Broadway success of &quot;The Seven Year Itch&quot; led to the successful 1955 film directed by Billy Wilder and starring Marilyn Monroe. The plot was altered so that the husband (Tom Ewell) only fantasizes about having an affair.

Axelrod&#x27;s next stage hit was &quot;Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?&quot;, a Faustian comedy about a fan magazine writer (Orson Bean) selling his soul to the Devil (in the guise of a literary agent) to become a successful screenwriter. It ran for more than a year on Broadway in 1955–56 and received much attention in the national press thanks to its star, Jayne Mansfield. The screen rights were bought by 20th Century Fox, but the studio had director/screenwriter Frank Tashlin change the story to a satire on television advertising and throw out all of Axelrod&#x27;s characters except Rita Marlowe (with Mansfield recreating her stage role). Axelrod was contemptuous of the 1957 film version, saying that he did not go to see it because the studio &quot;never used my story, my play or my script.&quot;

In 1959–60, Lauren Bacall starred in his comic play &quot;Goodbye Charlie&quot; which ran for 109 performances, followed by a film version with Debbie Reynolds. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, Axelrod was one of the best paid screenwriters in Hollywood, and he was nominated for an Academy Award for his 1961 adaptation of Truman Capote&#x27;s &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot;. He was highly regarded for his adaptation of Richard Condon&#x27;s novel for director John Frankenheimer&#x27;s Cold War thriller &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; (1962) starring Laurence Harvey and Frank Sinatra. Axelrod, who co-produced, considered it his best screen adaptation. After the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in November 1963, the movie was taken out of circulation and wasn&#x27;t re-released until 1988, when it became a box office hit and was deemed by critics to be a classic of American cinema.

Axelrod wrote the original screenplay for &quot;How to Murder Your Wife&quot; (1965), directed by Richard Quine with Jack Lemmon, Virna Lisi and Terry-Thomas. Axelrod directed &quot;Lord Love a Duck&quot; (1966), and two years later, he directed &quot;The Secret Life of an American Wife&quot; (1968). After a decade hiatus, he returned to films providing the screenplay for an unsuccessful remake of &quot;The Lady Vanishes&quot; (1979). Subsequent contributions include the scripts for Frankenheimer&#x27;s &quot;The Holcroft Covenant&quot; (1985) and &quot;The Fourth Protocol&quot; (1987).

===Novels===

Axelrod published three novels: &quot;Blackmailer&quot; (1952), a darkly comic mystery; &quot;Beggar&#x27;s Choice&quot; (1947), a comedy of role reversal; and &quot;Where Am I Now When I Need Me?&quot; (1971), a humorous overview of the Hollywood scene.

==Death==
On June 21, 2003, at the age of 81, Axelrod died quietly at his Los Angeles home. He was under hospice care after a lingering illness. His body was cremated.

<text>The Drum Major Institute for Public Policy (DMI) is a non-profit American progressive think tank and community action group. The group was founded in 1961 in the midst of the Civil Rights Movement. It later became defunct until it was relaunched in 1999. It is headquartered in New York City. DMI&#x27;s stated mission is &quot;to eradicate poverty, racism and militarism/violence, through advocacy, empowerment and education.&quot;

==History==
The Drum Major Foundation (later Institute) was founded in 1961 during the American Civil Rights Movement by Harry H. Wachtel, a New York City lawyer who was an adviser to Martin Luther King Jr. The organization became more or less defunct after King&#x27;s assassination in April 1968, but was relaunched in 1999 by King&#x27;s son Martin Luther III, Wachtel&#x27;s son William, and King confidant Andrew Young.

Martin Luther King Jr. often used the phrase &quot;drum major instinct,&quot; meaning the instinct to be a leader. In his sermon at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, Georgia, on February 4, 1968, he said: &quot;If you want to say that I was a drum major, say that I was a drum major for justice, say that I was a drum major for peace, say that I was a drum major for righteousness. And all of the other shallow things will not matter... I just want to leave a committed life behind.&quot;

The director of the institute from 2002 through 2004 was Fernando Ferrer, the former Borough president of the Bronx, who resigned from the institute at the end of 2004 to run for mayor of New York City. Donations to Ferrer&#x27;s mayoral campaign helped pay for DMI&#x27;s operations. From 2004 through 2010, Andrea Batista Schlesinger was the institute&#x27;s executive director. P.J. Kim was named the organization&#x27;s executive director in 2010.

Donors to DMI have included labor unions, health care companies and real estate groups.

==Activities==
According to its website, DMI focuses on a few main areas: immigration policy, combating tort reform, and, more generally, policies that they feel benefit the middle class. DMI has issued legislative scorecards for the United States Congress and the New York Legislature which grade elected officials on their votes relating to issues that DMI perceives as being important to achieving a middle class standard of living.

DMI&#x27;s Civil Justice Fellowship, originally called the Milberg Weiss Fellowship because it was funded by the indicted plaintiffs&#x27; law firm Milberg Weiss, was created to oppose tort reform.

Since 2002, the Drum Major Institute has hosted a series of discussions called the Marketplace of Ideas, progressive speakers series which highlights a public policy which is presented by the official who helped put it in place.

DMI supported New York City&#x27;s mandatory paid sick leave law.

DMI has hosted events featuring Bill Clinton, John Edwards, Howard Dean and Eliot Spitzer.

In 2008, as part of a joint project with the magazine &quot;The Nation&quot;, DMI interviewed mayors across the country on urban issues. The goal of the project was to help add urban issues to the presidential race.
