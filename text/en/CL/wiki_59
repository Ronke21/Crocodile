<text>John Cannizzaro Jr. (born 1943), better known as John Canemaker, is an American independent animator, animation historian, author, teacher and lecturer. In 1980, he began teaching and developing the animation program at New York University, Tisch School of the Arts&#x27;, Kanbar Institute of Film and Television Department. Since 1988 he has directed the program and is currently a tenured full professor. From 2001-2002 he was Acting Chair of the NYU Undergraduate Film and Television Department. In 2006, his film &quot;The Moon and the Son: An Imagined Conversation&quot;, a 28-minute animated piece about Canemaker&#x27;s relationship with his father, won the Academy Award for best animated short. In 2007 the same piece picked up an Emmy award for its graphic and artistic design.

== Biography ==
Raised in Elmira, New York, Canemaker began an acting career which included off-Broadway and advertising work in New York City from 1961 to 1965. In 1967, after a two-year stint in the Army, Canemaker, with funds from acting assignments in TV commercials (he appeared in over 35 advertisements for major products, most famously leading a line of &quot;fat kids, skinny kids, kids who climb on rocks&quot; through Central Park for Armour hotdogs)—and appearing as a cast member of the 1972 WCBS-TV show &quot;Patchwork Family&quot;, in which he drew on a large sketching pad—he obtained his bachelor of arts degree from Marymount Manhattan College in 1974 and master of fine arts in film from New York University in 1976.

== Career ==
While studying for his Bachelor of Arts degree, Canemaker&#x27;s childhood interest in animation revived. He began making sponsored animated shorts and wrote the first of more than 100 articles on animation history. His first book, the story of the making of Richard Williams&#x27; &quot;Raggedy Ann and Andy&quot;, was published in 1977 as &quot;The Animated Raggedy Ann and Andy&quot;. In 1982, he wrote the introduction of &quot;Treasures of Disney Animation Art&quot;; in 1987, he published &quot;Winsor McCay—His Life and Art&quot;; and, in 1991, &quot;Felix, the Twisted Tale of the World&#x27;s Most Famous Cat.&quot; There followed &quot;Tex Avery: The MGM Years&quot; and &quot;Before the Animation Begins: the Art and Lives of Disney Inspirational Sketch Artists&quot; (both in 1997), &quot;Paper Dreams: The Art and Artists of Disney Storyboards&quot; (1999), &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Nine Old Men and the Art of Animation&quot; (2001), and &quot;The Art and Flair of Mary Blair&quot; (2003).

His research in the history of animation inspired two of his own films, &quot;Remembering Winsor McCay&quot; (1976) and &quot;Otto Messmer and Felix the Cat&quot; (1977).

Canemaker&#x27;s filmography includes independently made animated shorts that are part of the permanent collection of New York&#x27;s Museum of Modern Art. Among them are &quot;The &#x27;40s&quot; (1974), &quot;Street Freaks&quot; (1975), &quot;Confessions of a Stardreamer&quot; (1978), &quot;The Wizard&#x27;s Son&quot; (1981), &quot;Bottom&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1983), &quot;Confessions of a Stand-Up&quot; (1993), and &quot;Bridgehampton&quot; (1998).

In the early 1980s, Canemaker animated several Children&#x27;s Television Workshop films for &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, TV commercials, and, in 1981, created the animation sequences for the Warner Bros. feature &quot;The World According to Garp&quot;. He designed and directed animation sequences in the Academy Award-winning HBO documentary &quot;You Don&#x27;t Have to Die&quot; (1988) and the Peabody Award-winning CBS documentary &quot;Break the Silence: Kids Against Child Abuse&quot; (1994).

&quot;John Canemaker: Marching to a Different Toon&quot;, a DVD/home video collection of his films, is distributed by Milestone Film &amp; Video/Image Entertainment. In addition, Canemaker writes regularly on animation for &quot;The New York Times&quot; and is on-camera and audio commentator on DVD versions of &quot;The Fantasia Anthology&quot;, &quot;Dumbo&quot;, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, &quot;Cut-up: The Films of Grant Munro&quot;, and &quot;Winsor McCay: The Master Edition&quot;. He has appeared on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot;, PBS&#x27; &quot;The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer&quot;, and &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;, and has lectured throughout the United States and in Brazil, Canada, England, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Slovakia, Spain, Switzerland, and Wales.

In 2006, he received an Award for outstanding contribution to animation studies at the World Festival of Animated Film - Animafest Zagreb.

<doc id="1175010" wikidata="Q363148" url="?curid=1175010" title="Ray Clemence">
<text>Raymond Neal Clemence (5 August 1948 – 15 November 2020) was an English professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper. Regarded as one of the greatest goalkeepers of all time, he is one of few players to have made over 1,000 career appearances, and holds the record for the most clean sheets in the history of football (460).

As part of the Liverpool team of the 1970s, Clemence won three European Cups, five League titles, two UEFA Cups, a European Super Cup, an FA Cup and a League Cup; the last of his 665 appearances for the club was the victorious 1981 European Cup final. In 1981, after being phased out at Liverpool, Clemence joined Tottenham Hotspur, winning a UEFA Cup, an FA Cup, and a Charity Shield with them, before retiring from football in 1988. Clemence played internationally for England from 1972 to 1983, and represented the country at UEFA Euro 1980 and the 1982 FIFA World Cup.

After brief spells as joint-manager at Tottenham (alongside Doug Livermore) and sole manager at Barnet in the first half of the 90s, he acted as head of the FA Development Team, overseeing the development made by players in the England youth teams from under-16 to 21 level, having previously been part of the England senior team&#x27;s backroom staff.

== Club career ==
=== Scunthorpe United ===
Born in Skegness, Lincolnshire, Clemence played eight matches on trial for Notts County, but was ultimately not signed by the Meadow Lane club. He was spotted by Scunthorpe United whilst playing in a county-cup final at their Old Showground ground for his local youth club Skegness Cosmos. After starring in the Cosmos&#x27; 4-3 victory, Clemence was invited for formal trials with &quot;The Iron&quot;, which he duly passed. Clemence went on to sign professional terms for Scunthorpe on his 17th birthday, 5 August 1965, shortly before the start of Scunthorpe&#x27;s 1965–66 Third Division campaign.

Despite initially playing in the club&#x27;s &#x27;third team&#x27;, Clemence&#x27;s big break arrived later in his debut season – making his professional debut in a 1–1 draw at home to Swansea Town on 2 April 1966. Prior to this debut, Clemence remembers a key behind-the-scenes intervention from two Scunthorpe coaches: &quot;Jack Brownsword and Alan Bushby pulled me aside, gave me a pep talk and told me they thought I could play for England one day but &#x27;you&#x27;ve got to work at it&#x27;&quot;.

Clemence went on to make four appearances in total throughout his debut season, including earning his first professional clean sheet in a 1–0 victory away at Southend United. Having spent much of that season as understudy to the experienced former Wolverhampton Wanderers and Aston Villa custodian Geoff Sidebottom, Clemence later cited Sidebottom as a crucial early mentor: &quot;I learned a lot from Geoff. He taught me how to look after myself because &#x27;keepers were a lot less protected then.&quot;

During his time at the club, Clemence lived with Mrs Ruby Duce of King Edward Street in Scunthorpe; in the very same digs which would then immediately be occupied by his future England and Liverpool teammate Kevin Keegan following Clemence&#x27;s departure to Liverpool.

After being reintroduced to the side after they had lost their opening three games in all competitions, Clemence became Scunthorpe&#x27;s undisputed first-choice goalkeeper in their following 1966–67 Third Division campaign, in which they finished a disappointing 18th. After manager and ex-Busby Babe Freddie Goodwin departed mid-season for the New York Generals in the nascent North American Soccer League, Clemence spent the latter half of his season under the guidance of caretaker player-manager Keith Burkinshaw, who would later also sign the player for Tottenham Hotspur.

And despite Clemence himself worrying that a humiliating 7–1 defeat away to arch-rivals Grimsby Town could end his professional career, Scunthorpe&#x27;s faith in him never waivered and this defeat proved to be the second game in a run of 46 consecutive starts he made to see out all of Scunthorpe&#x27;s remaining league and cup matches.

This run took Clemence&#x27;s figures to 50 appearances and 12 clean sheets in all competitions for Scunthorpe; but unbeknownst to him, he had been scouted in 12 games by legendary Liverpool manager Bill Shankly and his coaching staff. This came to fruition later that summer, when Clemence was forced to leave a beachside deckchair-stacking shift early, with the news that an urgent telegram awaited him at home. This was because Liverpool&#x27;s bid for the now 18-year-old shot-stopper had been accepted, and the Scunthorpe chairman personally drove Clemence to Anfield in his Rolls-Royce the next morning.

Looking back on his time with the club, Clemence fondly recalled how Scunthorpe United was: &quot;A club I&#x27;m proud to be associated with. While I was there it was like being part of a family.

=== Liverpool ===

Clemence was signed by Liverpool manager Bill Shankly on 24 June 1967 from Scunthorpe United for a fee of £18,000. He made his debut and kept his first clean sheet in a League Cup third round tie at Anfield on 25 September 1968, Swansea Town were the visitors and were beaten 2–0. He was nurtured through the reserve side over the next two years, with the occasional senior appearance, until 1970, at which point he became the club&#x27;s first choice goalkeeper.

In 1971, Liverpool reached the FA Cup final, where Clemence played well but Arsenal scored twice in extra time to overcome Liverpool&#x27;s lead and win the game 2–1. There would be joy for Clemence two seasons later in 1973, when Liverpool won both the League title and UEFA Cup, with Clemence saving a penalty from Jupp Heynckes in the final of the latter against Borussia Mönchengladbach. The penalty save meant that Liverpool took a 3–0 lead to Germany with them, rather than 3–1. Gladbach went on to win 2–0 in the second-leg; had Heynckes scored the penalty, then with the same second-leg result the tie would have finished 3–3 on aggregate, Gladbach would have won on the away goals rule. The 1973–74 season saw Liverpool claim yet more silverware winning the FA Cup with a comprehensive 3–0 victory over Newcastle United.

Liverpool won another League and UEFA Cup double in 1976 and then made a bid for a unique treble a year later. They achieved the first leg when they won the League title, but lost the FA Cup final 2–1 to rivals Manchester United. A few days later, Liverpool won the European Cup for the first time in Rome, defeating Borussia Mönchengladbach 3–1. In the second half Clemence made a magnificent save against Uli Stielike when the score was 1–1.

Liverpool retained the European Cup in 1978 with a narrow 1–0 win over Club Brugge at Wembley, but conceded their League title to Nottingham Forest, to whom they also lost in the League Cup final. In 1979 and 1980, Clemence kept goal as Liverpool clinched the League title in each season. The 1978–79 League success saw Clemence set a record that was never beaten under the two points for a win system, conceding only 16 goals in the 42 league matches (and just four at Anfield). This remarkable record remains for a 42-match season and endured until beaten in the 2004–05 season by Chelsea, who conceded 15 goals in the 38 League matches.

In 1981, Liverpool won the League Cup, and for the third time the European Cup, the latter with a 1–0 win over Real Madrid in a dour contest at the Parc des Princes on 27 May. It turned out to be Clemence&#x27;s last game for the club.

The emergence of Bruce Grobbelaar put Clemence&#x27;s place in the side under threat for the first time in eleven years (during which period he played in more than 650 matches and missed a mere six), and he decided to leave Liverpool to join Tottenham Hotspur for a fee of £300,000.

=== Tottenham Hotspur ===
Clemence left Liverpool to join Tottenham Hotspur in 1981 for a fee of £300,000. The two clubs reached the 1982 League Cup final, which Liverpool won 3–1. Despite this, they however, won the 1982 FA Cup, defeating Queens Park Rangers 1–0 after a replay.

Clemence&#x27;s first Tottenham appearance was in the 1981 FA Charity Shield against Aston Villa at Wembley on 22 August 1981, where Mark Falco and Peter Withe each scored twice in an entertaining 2–2 draw. His League debut came a week later with a winning start at Ayresome Park, where they beat Middlesbrough 3–1. His first clean sheet came three games later on 12 September at Molineux, when he kept Wolverhampton Wanderers off the scoresheet in the 1–0 victory.

Tottenham won the UEFA Cup in 1984. Clemence missed the final against Anderlecht through injury, but was on the bench as substitute goalkeeper in a match famously won when Tony Parks saved twice during the penalty shootout. Clemence reached a fifth FA Cup final in 1987, where his side lost to Coventry City. He is in a select group of players who have appeared in five or more FA Cup finals. Clemence sustained an Achilles tendon injury in Tottenham&#x27;s away match at Norwich in October 1987, which forced his retirement from playing in 1988. Shortly after retiring, Clemence joined the Tottenham coaching staff.

== International career ==
Clemence was a regular for England between 1972 and 1983, making his debut and keeping his first clean-sheet in the 1–0 World Cup qualifier win over Wales at Ninian Park on 15 November 1972. England failed to qualify for World Cups in 1974 and 1978. Clemence was part of the squad that qualified for UEFA Euro 1980 but the team failed to qualify from Group 2. In 1982, he was in the squad for the World Cup, but again England did not progress beyond the quarter-final stage.

Clemence captained England once — the first keeper to do so since Frank Swift. The game in question was a 1981 friendly with Brazil at Wembley, although Clemence couldn&#x27;t prevent the Brazilians from scoring as England lost 1–0.

Because of injury to his left knee, Clemence was retired from international football with 61 England caps in a 12-year international career. The presence of another goalkeeper, Peter Shilton, meant that the England management struggled to decide which keeper was the best, and ended up alternating their selection. Shilton ended up as first choice keeper for the rest of the 1980s, playing in two more World Cups and attaining a record 125 caps.

== Coaching career ==
=== Management ===
Clemence retired in 1988 and joined the coaching staff at Tottenham, working his way through to the first team, before leaving to become joint manager of Barnet (with fellow goalkeeper Gary Phillips) in January 1994. At the start of the 1994–95 season, he took sole charge leading Barnet to ninth and 13th in the Third Division.

=== England coaching team ===
In August 1996, he was recruited by his former Spurs and England teammate Glenn Hoddle as goalkeeping coach for the England national team, a position he continued to hold under Hoddle&#x27;s successors Kevin Keegan and Sven-Göran Eriksson. He remained in that position under Steve McClaren, until he was replaced by Italian Franco Tancredi as goalkeeping coach in December 2007, as Fabio Capello took charge of the national team. Clemence, however, remained part of the England backroom staff, and when Roy Hodgson took over as manager, he reinstated Clemence as goalkeeper coach. On 11 June 2012, he snapped his Achilles tendon during England&#x27;s warmups for their game against France during UEFA Euro 2012. He was also England&#x27;s Head of international teams, managing all the junior, women&#x27;s and disability teams. 

In 2013, Clemence retired; being &quot;lavishly saluted&quot;, and being bought a gift from the England team; despite his last appearance at an international level being 30 years earlier. 

== Personal life and death ==
Clemence was appointed an MBE in the 1987 Birthday Honours for services to football. His son, Stephen was a midfield player who came through the ranks at Tottenham Hotspur and Birmingham City, before retiring due to injury at Leicester City in 2010. He was appointed manager of Gillingham in 2023, then Barrow in 2024. Clemence&#x27;s daughter Sarah also has footballing connections, being the wife of former Crystal Palace and Nottingham Forest manager and Scotland striker Dougie Freedman. He also occasionally worked as a pundit on TV and radio, and commented on current goalkeeping stories in football.

In February 2005, Clemence announced that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer and that he would spend time away from the England squad whilst he received treatment. He was the second member of Eriksson&#x27;s staff to be diagnosed with prostate cancer; Brian Kidd was diagnosed with the disease prior to UEFA Euro 2004. He died from prostate cancer at his home in Corby on 15 November 2020, at the age of 72.

Clemence is held in high regard by both Liverpool and Tottenham fans. He was voted in at No. 11 on the Liverpool Football Club web site poll &quot;100 Players Who Shook The Kop&quot;; he was also the highest placed goalkeeper. He was also chosen as goalkeeper in the BBC&#x27;s Merseyside team of the 20th century, and topped &quot;Total Football&quot;″s poll of the best ever goalkeeper, beating players of the calibre of Peter Shilton, Lev Yashin, Gordon Banks and Pat Jennings. Shortly before his death, a mural near Anfield was created in his honour.

<text>The C-class ferries (also known as &quot;Cowichan&quot; class) are a class of five double-ended roll-on/roll-off ferries operated by BC Ferries in the Strait of Georgia in British Columbia, constructed between 1976 and 1981. When the vessels were first built, they were the largest ships of their kind in the world. The C-class ferries are long, with a car capacity of 316, and a crew and passenger capacity of 1494 persons. Each vessel&#x27;s two MaK 12M551AK engines produce 11,860 HP, which provides a maximum service speed of .

==C-class vessels==

The first two C-class ferries built were &quot;Queen of Coquitlam&quot; and &quot;Queen of Cowichan&quot;, constructed in 1976. &quot;Queen of Oak Bay&quot; and &quot;Queen of Surrey&quot; were built in 1981. There were some minor modifications to the design of the two later ships compared to the earlier C-class ships; most noticeably, &quot;Queen of Oak Bay&quot; and &quot;Queen of Surrey&quot; both have longer passenger decks than their older sisters. The C-class vessels were designed by Philip F. Spaulding and are similar to the Jumbo-class ferries he designed for Washington State Ferries several years earlier.

&quot;Queen of Alberni&quot; was also constructed in 1976 along with the first two C-class vessels. Although this ferry is considered to be a C-class vessel, it is significantly different in layout. It was originally designed to carry only overheight (truck) traffic but in 1984, an upper car deck was installed for 150 non-overheight vehicles. This ferry has a capacity of 280 cars and 1200 passengers and crew, and has a maximum service speed of .

&quot;Queen of Coquitlam&quot;, &quot;Queen of Cowichan&quot;, &quot;Queen of Oak Bay&quot;, &quot;Queen of Surrey,&quot; and &quot;Queen of Alberni&quot; each received extensive mid-life upgrades in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007 respectively. From engine work to major modifications and improvements, the vessels were refitted to provide an additional 20 years of service.

In July 2018, BC Ferries announced that it had issued a request for proposals to build replacement vessels for all C-class ships, with deliveries beginning in 2024. In 2022, BC Ferries deferred the replacement after it was determined the vessels could be given five-year life extensions beyond their original planned retirement dates. The project is in the design phase, with the first new major vessel currently scheduled to go into service in 2029.


==Routes==
C-class ferries are double-ended; they have a separate bridge at each end and therefore are not required to turn around during the sailing. These ferries generally run on the Duke Point–Tsawwassen, Horseshoe Bay–Departure Bay and Horseshoe Bay–Langdale routes. At one time, these ferries operated on the Swartz Bay–Tsawwassen route, but due to limitations placed on their speed when transiting Active Pass—after an accident they were required to operate in the more maneuverable docking mode rather than cruising mode—it is no longer feasible to run them on that route.

==Incidents and accidents==

On August 9, 1979, &quot;Queen of Alberni&quot; was transiting through Active Pass when it ran aground on Galiano Island, tipping fifteen degrees to starboard. Several large commercial vehicles on board the vessel at the time were damaged. No persons were injured, but a racehorse onboard was killed.

On October 19, 1980, &quot;Queen of Coquitlam&quot; tipped over and landed on her side in the Burrard Shipyards drydock during a maintenance layover, causing approximately in damage. She also gained the distinction of being the only BC Ferries vessel to have issued a mayday from drydock.

On August 12, 1985, three people were killed when &quot;Queen of Cowichan&quot; ran over a pleasure boat near the Horseshoe Bay terminal.

In June 1989, &quot;Queen of Alberni&quot; collided with the loading dock at Departure Bay causing significant damage to the ship and dock. Six people were injured including a cook who suffered a fractured cheekbone as he was walking down a set of stairs.

On March 12, 1992, &quot;Queen of Alberni&quot; collided with the Japanese freighter &quot;Shinwa Maru&quot; southwest of Tsawwassen. The collision occurred in heavy fog, with both vessels suffering minor damage. Injuries included 2 serious and 25 minor injuries for the 260 people on the ferry, while none of the 11 people aboard the freighter received injuries.

In October 1994, &quot;Queen of Surrey&quot; crashed into the dock at Horseshoe Bay, causing $200,000 in damage.

On October 20, 1995, &quot;Queen of Coquitlam&quot; experienced an engine shut-down while approaching Horseshoe Bay. She crashed into a dock at the terminal resulting in light damage.

On December 15, 2001, &quot;Queen of Alberni&quot; got caught in a heavy wind storm which turned a regular 2-hour crossing into a 7-hour ordeal.

On May 12, 2003, &quot;Queen of Surrey&quot; was disabled as a result of an engine room fire. &quot;Queen of Capilano&quot; was tethered to &quot;Queen of Surrey&quot; while tugboats were dispatched. The vessel was then towed back to shore. None of the 318 passengers were injured, but several crew members were treated for minor injuries. Some buckling of the main car deck resulted from the heat of the fire. However, no vehicles were damaged in the incident.

On July 31, 2003, &quot;Queen of Surrey&quot; experienced a mechanical problem with one of its propellers. As a result, she was removed from service for emergency dry-docking to facilitate repairs, which took about five days.

On June 30, 2005, &quot;Queen of Oak Bay&quot; lost power while approaching the Horseshoe Bay ferry terminal. After the captain gave ample warning, the ship coasted into the nearby Sewell&#x27;s Marina, where it overran more than a dozen boats before running aground. No one was injured, and the ferry sustained only minor scraping to a rudder and propeller blade. See for extensive details on this accident.

<text>QuickTime Animation format (also known as QuickTime RLE) is a video compression format and codec created by Apple Computer to enable playback of RGB video in real time without expensive hardware. It is generally found in the QuickTime container with the FourCC &#x27;rle &#x27;. It can perform either lossless or lossy compression and is one of the few video codecs that supports an alpha channel. Supported color depths are 1-bit (monochrome), 15-bit RGB, 24-bit RGB, 32-bit ARGB, as well as palettized RGB. As a result of reverse-engineering of the format, a decoder is implemented in XAnim as well as an encoder and decoder in libavcodec.

== Technical Details ==
QuickTime Animation uses run-length encoding and conditional replenishment for compression. When encoding, the input frame is scanned pixel-wise in raster-scan order and processed line-wise. Within a line, pixels are segmented into runs, the length of which is variable and signaled in the bitstream. For each run, one of three coding modes is used: same color, skip, or PCM. In same color mode, a run of pixels is represented by a single color in a run-length encoding fashion. If pixels with different colors are joined into a run (of a single color) by the encoder, the coding process is lossy, otherwise it is lossless. The lossless mode is used at the 100% quality level. In skip mode, the run of pixels is left unchanged from the previous frame (conditional replenishment). In PCM mode, the color of each pixel is written to the bitstream, without any compression.

Run-length encoding works well on content with large areas of constant color. Conditional replenishment works well if only small areas change from frame to frame. QuickTime Animation works well on content with both these properties, such as traditional 2-D animation and screencast content. For natural video and complex 3D rendered scenes, in which runs of constant color rarely occur, only low compression ratios can be achieved in lossless mode, and the merging of runs becomes visible as noise in lossy mode.

<doc id="1175028" wikidata="Q19848926" url="?curid=1175028" title="Null pointer">
<text>In computing, a null pointer or null reference is a value saved for indicating that the pointer or reference does not refer to a valid object. Programs routinely use null pointers to represent conditions such as the end of a list of unknown length or the failure to perform some action; this use of null pointers can be compared to nullable types and to the &quot;Nothing&quot; value in an option type.

A null pointer should not be confused with an uninitialized pointer: a null pointer is guaranteed to compare unequal to any pointer that points to a valid object. However, in general, most languages do not offer such guarantee for uninitialized pointers. It might compare equal to other, valid pointers; or it might compare equal to null pointers. It might do both at different times; or the comparison might be undefined behaviour. Also, in languages offering such support, the correct use depends on the individual experience of each developer and linter tools. Even when used properly, null pointers are semantically incomplete, since they do not offer the possibility to express the difference between a &quot;Not Applicable&quot; value versus a &quot;Not known&quot; value or versus a &quot;Future&quot; value.

Because a null pointer does not point to a meaningful object, an attempt to access the data stored at that (invalid) memory location may cause a run-time error or immediate program crash. This is the null pointer error. It is one of the most common types of software weaknesses, and Tony Hoare, who introduced the concept, has referred to it as a &quot;billion dollar mistake&quot;.

== C ==

In C, two null pointers of any type are guaranteed to compare equal. Prior to C23, the preprocessor macro codice_1 was provided, defined as an implementation-defined null pointer constant in codice_2, which in C99 can be portably expressed as codice_3, the integer value codice_4 converted to the type codice_5 (see pointer to void type). Since C23, a null pointer is represented with codice_6 which is of type codice_7 (something originally introduced to C++11), providing a type safe null pointer.

The C standard does not say that the null pointer is the same as the pointer to memory address 0, though that may be the case in practice. Dereferencing a null pointer is undefined behavior in C, and a conforming implementation is allowed to assume that any pointer that is dereferenced is not null.

In practice, dereferencing a null pointer may result in an attempted read or write from memory that is not mapped, triggering a segmentation fault or memory access violation. This may manifest itself as a program crash, or be transformed into a software exception that can be caught by program code. There are, however, certain circumstances where this is not the case. For example, in x86 real mode, the address codice_8 is readable and also usually writable, and dereferencing a pointer to that address is a perfectly valid but typically unwanted action that may lead to undefined but non-crashing behavior in the application; if a null pointer is represented as a pointer to that address, dereferencing it will lead to that behavior. There are occasions when dereferencing a pointer to address zero &quot;is&quot; intentional and well-defined; for example, BIOS code written in C for 16-bit real-mode x86 devices may write the interrupt descriptor table (IDT) at physical address 0 of the machine by dereferencing a pointer with the same value as a null pointer for writing. It is also possible for the compiler to optimize away the null pointer dereference, avoiding a segmentation fault but causing other undesired behavior.

== C++ ==

In C++, while the codice_1 macro was inherited from C, the integer literal for zero has been traditionally preferred to represent a null pointer constant. However, C++11 introduced the explicit null pointer constant codice_6 and type codice_7 to be used instead, providing a type safe null pointer. codice_6 and type codice_7 were later introduced to C in C23.

== Other languages ==

In some programming language environments (at least one proprietary Lisp implementation, for example), the value used as the null pointer (called codice_14 in Lisp) may actually be a pointer to a block of internal data useful to the implementation (but not explicitly reachable from user programs), thus allowing the same register to be used as a useful constant and a quick way of accessing implementation internals. This is known as the codice_14 vector.

In languages with a tagged architecture, a possibly null pointer can be replaced with a tagged union which enforces explicit handling of the exceptional case; in fact, a possibly null pointer can be seen as a tagged pointer with a computed tag.

Programming languages use different literals for the &quot;null pointer&quot;. In Python, for example, a null value is called codice_16. In Java and C#, the literal codice_17 is provided as a literal for reference types. In Pascal and Swift, a null pointer is called codice_14. In Eiffel, it is called a codice_19 reference.

== Null dereferencing ==

Because a null pointer does not point to a meaningful object, an attempt to dereference (i.e., access the data stored at that memory location) a null pointer usually (but not always) causes a run-time error or immediate program crash. MITRE lists the null pointer error as one of the most commonly exploited software weaknesses. 

* In C, dereferencing a null pointer is undefined behavior. Many implementations cause such code to result in the program being halted with an access violation, because the null pointer representation is chosen to be an address that is never allocated by the system for storing objects. However, this behavior is not universal. It is also not guaranteed, since compilers are permitted to optimize programs under the assumption that they are free of undefined behavior.
* In Delphi and many other Pascal implementations, the constant represents a null pointer to the first address in memory which is also used to initialize managed variables. Dereferencing it raises an external OS exception which is mapped onto a Pascal exception instance if the unit is linked in the clause.
* In Java, access to a null reference (codice_17) causes a (NPE), which can be caught by error handling code, but the preferred practice is to ensure that such exceptions never occur.
* In Lisp, is a first class object. By convention, codice_21 is , as is codice_22. So dereferencing in these contexts will not cause an error, but poorly written code can get into an infinite loop.
* In .NET and C#, access to null reference (codice_17) causes a to be thrown. Although catching these is generally considered bad practice, this exception type can be caught and handled by the program.
* In Objective-C, messages may be sent to a object (which is a null pointer) without causing the program to be interrupted; the message is simply ignored, and the return value (if any) is or , depending on the type.
* Before the introduction of Supervisor Mode Access Prevention (SMAP), a null pointer dereference bug could be exploited by mapping page zero into the attacker&#x27;s address space and hence causing the null pointer to point to that region. This could lead to code execution in some cases.

== Mitigation ==

While we could have languages with no nulls, most do have the possibility of nulls so there are techniques to avoid or aid debugging null pointer dereferences. Bond et al. suggest modifying the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to keep track of null propagation.

We have three levels of handling null references, in order of effectiveness:
# languages with no null;
# languages that can statically analyse code to avoid the possibility of null dereference at run time;
# if null dereference can occur at runtime, tools that aid debugging.

Pure functional languages are an example of level 1 since no direct access is provided to pointers and all code and data is immutable. User code running in interpreted or virtual-machine languages generally does not suffer the problem of null pointer dereferencing.

Where a language does provide or utilise pointers which could become void, it is possible to avoid runtime null dereferences by providing compilation-time checking via static analysis or other techniques, with syntactic assistance from language features such as those seen in the Eiffel programming language with Void safety to avoid null derefences, D, and Rust.

In some languages analysis can be performed using external tools, but these are weak compared to direct language support with compiler checks since they are limited by the language definition itself.

The last resort of level 3 is when a null reference occurs at runtime, debugging aids can help.

== Alternatives to null pointers ==
As a rule of thumb, for each type of struct or class, define some objects representing some state of the business logic replacing the undefined behaviour on null. For example, &quot;future&quot; to indicate a field inside a structure that will not be available right now (but for which we know in advance that in the future it will be defined), &quot;not applicable&quot; to indicate a field in a non-normalized structure, &quot;error&quot;, &quot;timeout&quot; to indicate that the field could not be initialized (probably stopping normal execution of the full program, thread, request or command).

== History ==

In 2009, Tony Hoare stated
that he invented the null reference in 1965 as part of the ALGOL W language. In that 2009 reference Hoare describes his invention as a &quot;billion-dollar mistake&quot;:

<doc id="1175032" wikidata="Q467106" url="?curid=1175032" title="Max Weinreich">
<text>Max Weinreich ( &quot;Maks Vaynraych&quot;; , &quot;Meyer Lazarevich Vaynraykh&quot;; 22 April 1894 – 29 January 1969) was a Russian-American-Jewish linguist, specializing in sociolinguistics and Yiddish, and the father of the linguist Uriel Weinreich, who, a sociolinguistic innovator, edited the &quot;Modern Yiddish-English English-Yiddish Dictionary&quot;.

He is known for increasing language awareness of Yiddish as a standardized language; he popularised the phrase &quot;A language is a dialect with an army and navy&quot;.

== Biography ==

Weinreich began his studies in a German school in Goldingen (modern Kuldīga), transferring to the gymnasium in Libau (modern Liepāja) after four years. He then lived in Daugavpils and Łódź. Between 1909 and 1912, he resided in Saint Petersburg, where he attended I. G. Eizenbet&#x27;s private Jewish gymnasium for boys. He was raised in a German-speaking family but became fascinated with Yiddish.

In the early 1920s, Weinreich lived in Germany and pursued studies in linguistics at the universities of Berlin and Marburg. In 1923, under the direction of German linguist in Marburg, he completed his dissertation, entitled &quot;Studien zur Geschichte und dialektischen Gliederung der jiddischen Sprache&quot; (Studies in the History and Dialect Distribution of the Yiddish language). The dissertation was published in 1993 under the title &quot;Geschichte der jiddischen Sprachforschung&quot; (&quot;History of Yiddish Linguistics&quot;).

In 1925, Weinreich was the cofounder, along with Nochum Shtif, Elias Tcherikower, and Zalman Reisen, of YIVO (originally called the &quot;Yidisher Visnshaftlekher Institut&quot; — Yiddish Scientific Institute). Although the institute was officially founded during a conference in Berlin in August 1925, the centre of its activities was in Wilno (now Vilnius, Lithuania), which eventually became its official headquarters as well. YIVO&#x27;s first office in Wilno was in a room in Weinreich&#x27;s apartment. Remembered as the guiding force of the institute, Weinreich directed its linguistic, or philological section in the period before the Second World War. His children were both born in Wilno at that time. His elder son Uriel (1926-1967) a linguist and lexicographer. The younger Gabriel Weinreich (1928-2023) was a physicist and musical acoustician.

Weinreich was in Denmark with his wife, Regina Shabad Weinreich, the daughter of a notable doctor and Jewish leader of Wilno Zemach Shabad, and his older son, Uriel, when World War II broke out in 1939. Regina returned to Vilnius, but Max and Uriel stayed abroad, moving to New York City in March 1940. YIVO was founded in Vilnius before being relocated to New York City. His wife and younger son, Gabriel, joined them there during the brief period (1920-1923) when Vilnius was in independent Lithuania. Weinreich became a professor of Yiddish at City College of New York and re-established YIVO in New York.

== Publications ==
Weinreich translated Sigmund Freud and Ernst Toller into Yiddish.

Weinreich is often cited as the author of a witty quip distinguishing between languages and dialects: &quot;A language is a dialect with an army and navy&quot; (&quot;אַ שפּראַך איז אַ דיאַלעקט מיט אַן אַרמײ און פֿלאָט&quot;, &quot;a shprakh iz a dialekt mit an armey un flot&quot;), but he was then explicitly quoting an unknown auditor at one of his lectures at Columbia University shortly after the war in 1945. This auditor was a high-school teacher who encapsulated one of the paradoxes of modern linguistics, i.e. that linguists may be in disagreement on the precise characterization of a given variety as a dialect or a language as a result of &quot;ignor[ing] politics&quot;, while, in Maxwell&#x27;s assessment, &quot;understanding political opinion is more relevant than linguistic expertise&quot; in the hierarchical categorization of language and dialect.

<text>The Battle of Wizna was fought between September 7 and September 10, 1939, between the forces of Poland and Germany during the initial stages of the invasion of Poland, which marked the beginning of the Second World War in Europe. According to Polish historian Leszek Moczulski, between 350 and 720 Poles defended a fortified line for three days against more than 40,000 Germans. Although defeat was inevitable, the Polish defence stalled the attacking forces for three days and postponed the encirclement of Independent Operational Group Narew fighting nearby. Eventually the tanks broke through the Polish line and German engineers eliminated all the shelters one by one. The last shelter surrendered around midday on September 10.

Because the battle consisted of a small force holding a piece of fortified territory against a vastly larger invasion for three days at great cost before being annihilated, Wizna is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Polish Thermopylae&quot;. One of the symbols of the battle is Captain Władysław Raginis, the commanding officer of the Polish force, who swore to hold his position as long as he was alive. When the last two shelters under his command ran out of ammunition, he ordered his men to surrender their arms and committed suicide by detonating a grenade against his neck.

==History==

===Background===
Before the war, the area of the village of Wizna was prepared as a fortified line of defence. It was to shield the Polish positions further to the south and guard the crossing of the Narew and Biebrza rivers. The long line of Polish defences stretched between the villages of Kołodzieje and Grądy-Woniecko, with Wizna in the centre. The line ran some from the border with East Prussia, along an elevated banks of Narew and Biebrza rivers. Units defending the line were subordinate to the Polish Independent Operational Group Narew shielding Łomża and providing defence of the northern approach to Warsaw. The Wizna fortified area was one of the most important nodes in Northern Poland, providing cover of both the river crossings, and the roads Łomża–Białystok and roads towards Brześć Litewski on the rear of Polish forces.

Construction started in June 1939, only two months before the outbreak of World War II. The spot was chosen carefully; most of the concrete bunkers were built on hills overlooking a swampy Narew River valley. They could be reached either through direct assault through the swamps or by attack along the causeway leading from the bridge in Wizna. Before September 1, 1939, only 16 bunkers were built out of 60 planned. Six bunkers were made of heavy concrete with reinforced steel cupolas weighing 8 tons each, armed with machine guns and anti-tank artillery. Two were light concrete bunkers, armed with machine guns only. The remaining eight were ad hoc machine gun pillboxes, protected mostly by sandbags and earthworks. Four additional heavy bunkers were under construction when World War II started. In addition, the area was reinforced with trenches, anti-tank and anti-personnel obstacles, barbed wire lines and land mines. There were also plans to break the dams on the Biebrza and Narew rivers to flood the area, but the summer of 1939 was one of the driest seasons in Polish history and the water level was too low.

Although not all bunkers were ready by the beginning of the war, the Polish lines of defence were well-prepared. The walls of an average bunker, 1.5 metres thick and reinforced with 20-centimetre-thick steel plates, could withstand a direct hit from even the heaviest guns available to the Wehrmacht at the time. The bunkers were situated on hills which gave good visibility of all the advancing forces.

=== Opposing forces ===

The Polish defensive line was initially manned by a single battalion from the 71st Infantry Regiment, commanded by Major Jakub Fober. However, shortly before the outbreak of World War II it was reinforced with a machine gun company from Osowiec Fortress under Captain Władysław Raginis, as well as numerous smaller detachments from a variety of units. On September 2, 1939, the III/71 battalion departed for Osowiec, and Fober passed command over Wizna to Raginis and his men. Altogether, the Polish defensive position was manned by 720 men: 20 officers and 700 NCOs and privates. However, some sources claim that the Polish unit was even weaker, no more than 360 men strong.

Although the Polish units were almost entirely composed of conscripts mobilised in August 1939 rather than professional soldiers, their morale was very high. After the war, Guderian had trouble explaining why his corps was stopped by such a small force. In his memoirs he attributes the delay to his officers &quot;having trouble building bridges across the rivers&quot;. During the Nuremberg Trials he remarked that Wizna was &quot;well-defended by a local officer school&quot;.


=== Before the battle ===
On September 1, 1939, the Polish Defensive War and World War II started. The German 3rd Army was to advance from East Prussia towards Warsaw, directly through the positions of Polish Narew Corps. On September 2 Captain Władysław Raginis was named the commander of the Wizna area. As his command post he chose the &quot;GG-126&quot; bunker near the village of Góra Strękowa. The bunker was located on a hill in the exact centre of the Polish lines. His forces numbered approximately 700 soldiers and NCOs and 20 officers armed with 6 pieces of artillery (75mm), 24 HMGs, 18 machine guns and two Kb ppanc wz.35 anti-tank rifles, with just 20 bullets.

After initial clashes at the border, the Podlaska Cavalry Brigade operating in the area, during the night of 3/4 September was ordered to withdraw and on September 5 it left the area and marched toward Mały Płock to cross the river Narew. On September 3 Polish positions were spotted from the air and strafed with machine gun fire from enemy fighters.

On September 7, 1939, the reconnaissance units of the 10th Panzer Division of General Nikolaus von Falkenhorst captured the village of Wizna. Polish mounted reconnaissance squads abandoned the village after a short fight and retreated to the southern bank of Narew. When German tanks tried to cross the bridge, it was blown up by Polish engineers. After dark, patrols of German infantry crossed the river and advanced towards Giełczyn, but were repelled with heavy casualties.

On September 8, General Heinz Guderian, commander of the XIX Panzer Corps, was ordered to advance through Wizna towards Brześć. By the early morning of September 9, his units reached the Wizna area and were joined with 10th Panzer Division and &quot;Lötzen&quot; Infantry Brigade already present in the area. His forces numbered some 1,200 officers and 41,000 soldiers and NCOs, equipped with over 350 tanks, 108 howitzers, 58 pieces of artillery, 195 anti-tank guns, 108 mortars, 188 grenade launchers, 288 heavy machine guns, and 689 machine guns. Altogether, his forces were some 60 times stronger than the Polish defenders.

=== Defence of Wizna ===

In the early morning, German planes dropped leaflets that urged the Poles to surrender and claimed that most of Poland was already in German hands, and that further resistance was futile. In order to strengthen the morale of his troops, Władysław Raginis and Lieutenant Brykalski swore that they would not leave their post alive and that resistance would continue. Soon after that a German artillery barrage and aerial bombardment started. The Polish artillery was much weaker and was soon forced to retreat towards Białystok. After preparation, the Germans attacked the northern flank of the Polish forces. Two platoons defending several bunkers located to the north of Narew were attacked from three sides by German tanks and infantry. Initially the losses among German infantry were high, but after heavy artillery fire, the commander of the Giełczyn area, First Lieutenant Kiewlicz, was ordered to burn the wooden bridge over Narew and withdraw to Białystok. The remnants of his forces broke through the German encirclement and reached Białystok, where they joined the forces of General Franciszek Kleeberg.

At the same time, an assault on the southern part of Polish fortifications became a stalemate. The Polish bunkers lacked adequate anti-tank armament, but were able to rake the German infantry with machine gun fire. However, at 6 o&#x27;clock in the evening, the Polish infantry was forced to abandon the trenches and field fortifications and retreat into the bunkers. The German tanks could finally cross the Polish lines and advance towards Tykocin and Zambrów. However, the German infantry was still under heavy fire and was pinned down in the swampy fields in front of the Polish bunkers.

Although Raginis was subordinate to Lieutenant Colonel Tadeusz Tabaczyński, commander of the Osowiec fortified area located some 30 kilometres to the north, he could not expect any reinforcements. On September 8, the Marshal of Poland, Edward Rydz-Śmigły, ordered the 135th Infantry Regiment, which constituted the reserves of both Osowiec and Wizna, to be withdrawn to Warsaw. When the order was withdrawn and the unit returned to Osowiec, it was already too late to help the isolated Poles at Wizna.

Heavy fighting for each of the now isolated bunkers continued. Several assaults were repelled during the night and in the early morning of September 10. At approximately 11 o&#x27;clock, German engineers, with the help of tanks and artillery, finally managed to destroy all but two of the Polish bunkers. Both of them were located in the centre of Strękowa Góra and continued fighting despite having much of the crew wounded or incapacitated and most of their machine guns destroyed. After the war, the Poles insisted that Guderian, in an attempt to end the Polish resistance, threatened the Polish commander that he would shoot the POWs if the remaining forces did not surrender. The resistance, however, continued for another hour, when a German envoy arrived carrying a flag of truce and proposed a cease fire. It lasted until approximately 1:30 p.m. Raginis, realising that all of his men were wounded and his ammunition was almost depleted, ordered his men to surrender their arms to the Germans. He himself – seriously injured at the time – refused to surrender and committed suicide by detonating a grenade against his neck.

===Aftermath===
After the Polish resistance ended, the XIX Panzer Corps advanced towards Wysokie Mazowieckie and Zambrów, where it fought the Battle of Zambrów against the Polish 18th Infantry Division, finally encircling and destroying the Polish division during the Battle of Andrzejewo. Later it advanced further southwards and took part in the Battle of Brześć.

Although all the bunkers were destroyed and the Polish resistance was finally broken, the fortified area of Wizna managed to halt the German advance for three days. The heroic struggle against overwhelming odds is one of the symbols of the Polish Defensive War of 1939 and is a part of Polish popular culture.

== Casualties ==
Exact Polish losses are unknown, mostly because very little is known of the soldiers that were taken as prisoners of war by the Germans. Out of 720 Polish soldiers only approximately 70 survived. Some successfully withdrew and reached the Polish lines, others were taken prisoner. Some of the prisoners were subsequently killed by the Germans, others were beaten and abused but survived and were eventually taken to POW camps.

German losses are not known either. An official release by the Wehrmacht mentioned &quot;several dozen dead&quot;.

The Wehrmacht lost at least 10 tanks and several other AFVs in the struggle.

The history of the 10th Tank Division for September 8 mentions 9 killed and 26 wounded in action for the ALA. The I./IR 86, which was the main unit of the capture of the bunkers reported on September 9 at 17:00 the loss of 40 men. There are some losses of the Tank Regiment 8 reported as well. The following fighting at Wysokie-Mazowieckie and Andrzejewo make it difficult to differentiate the losses.

==In popular culture==
The Battle of Wizna is the theme of the song &quot;40:1&quot;, on the album &quot;The Art of War&quot; by the Swedish metal band Sabaton. The title comes from the disparate ratio of forces and the lyrics compare the Polish forces with the 300 Spartan warriors at the battle of Thermopylae.

<doc id="1175046" wikidata="Q1510326" url="?curid=1175046" title="Waihou River">
<text>The Waihou River is located in the northern North Island of New Zealand. Its former name, Thames River, was bestowed by Captain James Cook in November 1769, when he explored of the river from the mouth. An older Māori name was &quot;Wai Kahou Rounga&quot;. A 1947 Geographic Board enquiry ruled that the official name would be Waihou.

==Geography==
The river flows north for from the Mamaku Ranges past the towns of Putāruru, Te Aroha, Paeroa and Turua, before reaching the Firth of Thames at the south end of the Hauraki Gulf near the town of Thames. In its lower reaches, the river and the nearby Piako River form the wide alluvial Hauraki Plains. Just before the river reaches the ocean, State Highway 25 crosses the river over the Kopu Bridge, which was the longest single lane bridge in the country at and the only remaining swing bridge on a New Zealand state highway. The bridge was infamous for the queues of vehicles travelling to and from the Coromandel Peninsula until a new two lane bridge was opened in December 2011. Tributaries include the Waimakariri Stream, Waiomou Stream, Oraka Stream and the Ohinemuri River.

==History==

Many areas on the banks of the Waihou River were settled by Hauraki Māori, such as Oruarangi pā and Paterangi pā near Matatoki, and the Te Raupa pā and Waiwhau pā near Paeroa. The mouth of the river was famous as a location for pātiki (flounder) fishing.

In 1879 Te Au o Tonga, or the Falls of Awotonga, were destroyed by of dynamite to free the navigation of the river for shipping. There was a water column of . Other parts of the river had been cleared in the same manner in previous years. Josiah Firth spent £7,442 to 1880, extending navigation for his Kotuku steamer, drawing , as far as Stanley Landing, near Gordon. By 1923 a launch could reach Okauia. A 1925 report said there had once been a steady traffic. Regular traffic on the river ended in 1947.

In the 1910s stopbanks and floodgates were constructed along the Waihou River in order to protect farmland from flooding, including a canal constructed at the point where the Waihou River and Ohinemuri River meet, west of Paeroa. Further work occurred in the 1980s after extensive flooding in 1981.

==Recreation==
The river supports large populations of rainbow and brown trout. A survey conducted in 2009 showed that the upper section of the river supported over 700 fish per kilometre.

== Pollution ==
The water quality at Te Aroha is in the worst category for dissolved reactive phosphorus and also the worst 25% of all sites measured for other pollutants. At Okauia the river is in the worst category for &quot;E. coli&quot;, though the measurement may have been overestimated. In the upper reaches of the river the main pollutant is phosphorus. Water flows are measured at Te Aroha and Okauia.

<text>Corbie (; ; Picard:&quot;Corbin&quot;) is a commune of the Somme department in Hauts-de-France in northern France.

==Geography==
The small town is situated up river from Amiens, in the département of Somme and is the main town of the canton of Corbie. It lies in the valley of the river Somme, at the confluence with the Ancre. The town is bisected by the Canal de la Somme.

This satellite photograph shows it in its context. The town is to the left and the fenny Somme valley winds down to it from the right. The chalk of the Upper Cretaceous plateau shows pale in the fields. The river Ancre flows down from the north-east. The A29 road is shown under construction snaking across the chalk in the southern part of the picture. The fainter, straight line just to its north is the road N29. It passes through Villers-Bretonneux, the village just south of Corbie.

==History==

===Corbie Abbey===

The town of Corbie grew up round Corbie Abbey, founded in 657 or 660 by the queen regent Bathilde, with a founding community of monks from Luxeuil Abbey in the Franche-Comté.

Its scriptorium came to be one of the centers of work of manuscript illumination when the art was still fairly new in western Europe. In this early Merovingian period the work of Corbie was innovative in that it portrayed images of people, such as Saint Jerome. It was also the place of creation, in about 780, of the influential Caroline minuscule script.

The contents of its library are known from catalogues of the eleventh and twelfth centuries. In 1638, Cardinal Richelieu ordered the transfer of the library&#x27;s books to the library at Saint-Germain-des-Prés, which was dispersed at the end of the eighteenth century.

===Town===
In 1234, Floris IV, Count of Holland died at a tournament held here. In 1475, the town was taken by Louis XI. The Spanish took it after a short siege on 15 August 1636 but were ousted in November by Richelieu and Louis XIII of France after a siege of three months.

In 1918, Corbie was on the margin of the battlefield of Villers-Bretonneux at which the First Battle of the Somme (1918) of the German spring offensive came to a climax.

<text>Cornucopia is an unincorporated census-designated place in the town of Bell in northern Bayfield County, Wisconsin, United States. It is situated on Lake Superior at the northern end of the Bayfield Peninsula. It is along Wisconsin Highway 13 and County Highway C. As of the 2020 census, its population was 103, up from 98 at the 2010 census. The community borders the lake at Siskiwit Bay, between Roman&#x27;s Point and Mawikwe (formerly Squaw) Point. It is near a mainland portion of the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore, which features the Mawikwe Bay Sea Caves.

Most residents of the Town of Bell with Cornucopia mailing addresses are considered residents of Cornucopia.

==Geography==
Cornucopia has an area of , all of it land.

== History==
The Ojibwe used the Siskiwit Bay area as a temporary camp and a stopover on the way to La Pointe. &quot;Siskiwit&quot; comes from an Ojibwe word for a subspecies of Lake trout known in English as a &quot;fat trout&quot;. A historical marker at the Cornucopia beach tells of the Tragedy of the Siskiwit, an Ojibwe battle on that site with a band of Meskwaki that lead to several deaths and the kidnapping of a chief&#x27;s son.

The first white settlers in the Siskiwit Bay area were loggers who came at the close of the nineteenth century. Remnants of this period include abandoned railroad pilings in Siskiwit Lake and a legend of stolen gold on Gold Hill at the southeastern edge of the community.

The first farmers were &quot;Russians&quot; who came to the Town of Bell from the Austrian Empire via Chicago. They were not Great Russians but Carpatho-Russians or Rusyns, an ethnic group found in the mountainous borderlands of Poland, Slovakia, Ukraine, and, Romania. Rusyn surnames found in Cornucopia include Kaseno, Celinsky, Sveda, Roman, and Pristash.

Commercial fishing for lake trout, whitefish, and freshwater herring has traditionally operated out of Cornucopia&#x27;s harbor. The Jones, Ehlers, Johnson, and Ivanow families kept the fishing industry going during the twentieth century. Today only the Halvorson family engages in commercial fishing out of Cornucopia.

In 1903, T.J. Stevenson and Albert Wescott, two land speculators from Iowa established a post office and gave the village the name &quot;Cornucopia&quot; for its abundance of resources. A centennial celebration in 2003 recognized this event.

After World War II, Cornucopia&#x27;s natural environment led tourism to replace logging, farming, and fishing as the dominant industry of the community. Today, most working-age residents are engaged in trades, service, or seasonal employment.

== Landmarks ==
The Bell Town Hall, a large brick building in the center of the community, was a school until the 1970s. Today children from Cornucopia attend school at the South Shore School in Port Wing, Wisconsin, 15 miles to the west. The town was awarded a grant to remodel the town hall, making it more accessible, building a new kitchen, and replacing windows. It is the site of many weddings and family gatherings and host to community events, such as the annual fish fry. The baseball diamond was the home field of the Cornucopia Little League baseball team.

Cornucopia is the home of three active churches: St. Ann&#x27;s Roman Catholic, Immanuel Lutheran, and St. Mary&#x27;s Orthodox Church of America. St. Mary&#x27;s was originally built as a Russian Orthodox church. Its design includes an enclosed bell tower and a small onion dome.

The Cornucopia Historic (Green Shed) Museum lies on the harbor. It contains displays of photographs, family histories and historic artifacts and is open seasonally from mid June to early October.

The Cornucopia Post Office is Wisconsin’s northernmost post office.

==Economy==

Siskiwit Bay Marina is near the center of Cornucopia, WI where boaters from all over the midwest come to enjoy their summer times.

Lumberman Walter Flieth and fisherman Herman Ehlers started the Flieth-Ehlers Mercantile Company in 1915. Now known as Ehlers&#x27; General Store, it has been the social and commercial center of the community since its beginnings.

Cornucopia has a harbor where the Siskiwit River meets Lake Superior. Today, two marinas, one private and one municipal, operate out of Cornucopia. There is also an extensive sand swimming beach. Numerous gift shops and lodging places line the harbor.

The community was once home to the Cornucopia Yacht Club, an imaginary yacht club founded by Hale, Roger, and Scot O&#x27;Malley in 1975. The O&#x27;Malleys founded the club to gain access to yacht club marinas in other cities, which generally required a reciprocal agreement with another club. While the club printed membership cards and made its own jackets, it never had its own marina or building; its mailing address was &quot;Pier 99&quot;, which was actually a post office box at Cornucopia&#x27;s post office. Membership cost $5 a year, and members were not required to own a boat; the application instead asked what members would name their boats if they had one. The club once boasted over 700 members, including several who had never been to Cornucopia; according to the founders, this tally included former U.S. President Gerald Ford and his wife Betty.

== Annual events ==

Cornucopia Day takes place every year on the second Saturday in August. The event, put on for the benefit of the volunteer fire department and ambulance service, includes a 5K Run, bike ride, fish, brats &amp; corn, parade, flea market and raffles.

The Annual Fish Fry takes place on the Sunday closest to July 4.

The Annual Turkey Dinner takes place the first Sunday of the deer hunting season, which is the Sunday before Thanksgiving.

Cribbage League is a five-week cribbage contest between the residents of Cornucopia and the nearby community of Red Cliff, Wisconsin, taking place every January and February.

<doc id="1175089" wikidata="Q1378887" url="?curid=1175089" title="Primary battery">
<text>A primary battery or primary cell is a battery (a galvanic cell) that is designed to be used once and discarded, and it is not rechargeable unlike a secondary cell (rechargeable battery). In general, the electrochemical reaction occurring in the cell is not reversible, rendering the cell unrechargeable. As a primary cell is used, chemical reactions in the battery use up the chemicals that generate the power; when they are gone, the battery stops producing electricity. In contrast, in a secondary cell, the reaction can be reversed by running a current into the cell with a battery charger to recharge it, regenerating the chemical reactants. Primary cells are made in a range of standard sizes to power small household appliances such as flashlights and portable radios.

Primary batteries make up about 90% of the $50 billion battery market, but secondary batteries have been gaining market share. About 15 billion primary batteries are thrown away worldwide every year, virtually all ending up in landfills. Due to the toxic heavy metals and strong acids and alkalis they contain, batteries are hazardous waste. Most municipalities classify them as such and require separate disposal. The energy needed to manufacture a battery is about 50 times greater than the energy it contains. Due to their high pollutant content compared to their small energy content, the primary battery is considered a wasteful, environmentally unfriendly technology. Due mainly to increasing sales of wireless devices and cordless tools which cannot be economically powered by primary batteries and come with integral rechargeable batteries, the secondary battery industry has high growth and has slowly been replacing the primary battery in high end products.

==Usage trend==
In the early twenty-first century, primary cells began losing market share to secondary cells, as relative costs declined for the latter. Flashlight power demands were reduced by the switch from incandescent bulbs to light-emitting diodes.

The remaining market experienced increased competition from private- or no-label versions. The market share of the two leading US manufacturers, Energizer and Duracell, declined to 37% in 2012. Along with Rayovac, these three are trying to move consumers from zinc–carbon to more expensive, longer-lasting alkaline batteries.

Western battery manufacturers shifted production offshore and no longer make zinc-carbon batteries in the United States.

China became the largest battery market, with demand projected to climb faster than anywhere else, and has also shifted to alkaline cells. In other developing countries disposable batteries must compete with cheap wind-up, wind-powered and rechargeable devices that have proliferated.

==Comparison between primary and secondary cells==
Secondary cells (rechargeable batteries) are in general more economical to use than primary cells. Their initially higher cost and the purchase cost of a charging system can be spread out over many use cycles (between 100 and 1000 cycles); for example, in hand-held power tools, it would be very costly to replace a high-capacity primary battery pack every few hours of use.

Primary cells are not designed for recharging between manufacturing and use, thus have battery chemistry that has to have a much lower self-discharge rate than older types of secondary cells; but they have lost that advantage with the development of rechargeable secondary cells with very low self-discharge rates like low self-discharge NiMH cells that hold enough charge for long enough to be sold as pre-charged.

Common types of secondary cells (namely NiMH and Li-ion) due to their much lower internal resistance do not suffer the large loss of capacity that alkaline, zinc–carbon and zinc chloride (&quot;heavy duty&quot; or &quot;super heavy duty&quot;) do with high current draw.

Reserve batteries achieve very long storage time (on the order of 10 years or more) without loss of capacity, by physically separating the components of the battery and only assembling them at the time of use. Such constructions are expensive but are found in applications like munitions, which may be stored for years before use.

==Polarization==
A major factor reducing the lifetime of primary cells is that they become &quot;polarized&quot; during use. This means that hydrogen accumulates at the cathode and reduces the effectiveness of the cell. To reduce the effects of polarization in commercial cells and to extend their lives, chemical depolarization is used; that is, an oxidizing agent is added to the cell, to oxidize the hydrogen to water. Manganese dioxide is used in the Leclanché cell and zinc–carbon cell, and nitric acid is used in the Bunsen cell and Grove cell.

Attempts have been made to make simple cells self-depolarizing by roughening the surface of the copper plate to facilitate the detachment of hydrogen bubbles with little success. Electrochemical depolarization exchanges the hydrogen for a metal, such as copper (e.g. Daniell cell), or silver (e.g. silver-oxide cell), so called.

==Terminology==
===Anode and cathode===
The battery terminal (electrode) that develops a positive voltage polarity (the carbon electrode in a dry cell) is called the cathode and the electrode with a negative polarity (zinc in a dry cell) is called the anode. This is the &quot;reverse&quot; of the terminology used in an electrolytic cell or thermionic vacuum tube. The reason is that the terms anode and cathode are defined by the direction of electric current, not by their voltage. The anode is the terminal through which conventional current (positive charge) enters the cell from the external circuit, while the cathode is the terminal through which conventional current leaves the cell and flows into the external circuit. Since a battery is a power source which provides the voltage which forces the current through the external circuit, the voltage on the cathode must be higher than the voltage on the anode, creating an electric field directed from cathode to anode, to force the positive charge out of the cathode through the resistance of the external circuit.

Inside the cell the anode is the electrode where chemical oxidation occurs, as it donates electrons which flow out of it into the external circuit. The cathode is the electrode where chemical reduction occurs, as it accepts electrons from the circuit.

Outside the cell, different terminology is used. As the anode donates positive charge to the electrolyte (thus remaining with an excess of electrons that it will donate to the circuit), it becomes negatively charged and is therefore connected to the terminal marked &quot;−&quot; on the outside of the cell. The cathode, meanwhile, donates negative charge to the electrolyte, so it becomes positively charged (which allows it to accept electrons from the circuit) and is therefore connected to the terminal marked &quot;+&quot; on the outside of the cell.

Old textbooks sometimes contain different terminology that can cause confusion to modern readers. For example, a 1911 textbook by Ayrton and Mather describes the electrodes as the &quot;positive plate&quot; and &quot;negative plate&quot; .

<doc id="1175103" wikidata="Q7692606" url="?curid=1175103" title="Technology governance">
<text>Technology governance means the governance, i.e., the steering between the different sectors—state, business, and NGOs—of the development of technology. It is the idea of governance within technology and its use, as well as the practices behind them. The concept is based on the notion of innovation and of techno-economic paradigm shifts according to the theories by scholars such as Joseph A. Schumpeter, Christopher Freeman, and Carlota Perez.

== Overview ==
The thought is that periods in economic development are commanded by a worldview driving innovation that impacts through finance components, hierarchical change, and more prominent returns. Currently, the worldview driving innovation is information and communications technology (ICT), which has grown exponentially over the past years. 

Technology governance is a public policy concept; a humanitarian setting can facilitate both control and care of subjects in creating an environment aimed at reducing harms they might experience. Without governance, redundant technological solutions can occur, creating more complexity as well as a potential increase in cost, compromising future investments for innovation. There is a fine line between technology governance and its alternative, IT governance. It is not to be confused with inner-corporate arrangements of organization (corporate governance) and IT arrangements, sometimes called &quot;Information Technology Governance&quot; or Corporate governance of information technology. The difference between them is IT governance influences the governance around firm performance and information systems whereas technology governance focuses on technology itself and adapting with it.

Organizations that can establish procedures and structures on public policies based on decision-making principles are at the heart of technology governance. It is a way to get people involved in these groups and allow all levels of government officials to participate. Technology governance serves as a mediator between technological innovation and controversies that surround it. Technology governance creates a balance between the political and social implications brought from new technology innovations. 

Technology governance is a controversial topic with a wide array of stakeholders across the world. To ensure the long-term success, various organizations bring together groups and people to exchange knowledge and information, informing decisions related to technology-related public policy and regulation. Many of the technology governance organizations do not make direct policy changes, but instead aim to bring together relevant organizations and experts to exchange information and highlight key issues to influence public policy. It is still a growing area of academic focus and professional training. 

The majority of organizations focus on Internet policies, including general organizations such as the Internet Society, as well as more specific groups such as the Internet Architecture Board that serve as a &quot;committee of the Internet Engineering Task Force and an advisory body of the Internet Society&quot;. Larger organizations tend to focus on more overarching goals, such as development and guidance for the changing internet and technologies, while many smaller groups advise and work with and within larger groups to provide oversight and more direct examination of policies.

== Importance ==
Technological advancement often brings a new sense of innovation and increased convenience. These advances come with potential harm and threats if unregulated. Compliance can be breached, technology can be used to harm, and disinformation can negatively affect media while also being a potential interference in governmental/political elections. Technology governance aims to regulate that space which allows for a rather smooth evolution of technology as a whole. NGO&#x27;s, committees, and unions have dedicated their efforts to the idea of technology governance as advancements become more complex and complicated. Groups like the GSCA, IGC, TTC, and the IFI divide their attention to the demand of technology governance, as well as advocate for its further presence when technological advances are made. They aim to achieve a regulated space for evolution to run its course in the tech world, free from disinformation, malpractice in use of technology, and rules/laws broken.

=== Examples ===
Technology innovation has a lot of beneficial effects and benefits, but it also has a lot of harmful consequences and benefits. It aids in the discovery and management of the risks and rewards associated with technology. A recurrent pattern in these breakthroughs is a shift in the industry, as well as the contentious disputes that surround them.

# Gene Editing
# Social Media

== Barriers ==
Effective technology governance will involve collective action from various sectors to manage the development of breakthrough technologies. With the boundary-crossing nature of emerging technology, the need for collaborative policy-making architecture is paramount to adapt to the speed of technological change and address the variety of issues associated with introducing new technologies within our shared digital infrastructure. The challenge of a collaborative policy-making architecture within governance is the inherent need for trust and cooperation among diverse stakeholder groups between innovations.

Among some of the barriers for governance, we see a well-known puzzle: the Collingridge dilemma, holding that early in the innovation process — when interventions and course corrections might still prove easy and cheap — the full consequences of the technology and hence the need for change might not be fully apparent. The Collingridge dilemma can be described as one of the main underlying problems within the governance of emerging technologies. With new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, the implications of introducing and applying this within our digital infrastructure could prove to be dangerous and unknown. Another example is neurotechnology, with embedded devices and brain-computer interfaces that challenge existing safety and efficacy regimes and may fail to consider the potential long-term ethical questions of protecting the human agency and mental privacy. In the opportunity that the need for intervention within an innovation becomes clear, changing the course to align with a collaborative policy could become expensive, complex, and time-consuming. This uncertainty and unknowingness with emerging technology make the challenges within &quot;opening up&quot; or &quot;closing down&quot; development trajectories the central focus of governance debates between sectors.

Public acceptance introduces another aspect of challenges for technology governance. The resistance from the general acceptance within emerging innovations can fall under fundamental value conflicts, distributive concerns, or even failures of trust in governing institutions such as regulatory authorities and bodies giving technical advice. The opposition of public acceptance will require &quot;anticipatory governance,&quot; an approach that uses participatory forms of foresight and technology assessment to work towards achieving desired future outcomes and focuses on engaging stakeholders in communicative processes with particular links to policy. Within anticipatory governance and the confines of the so-called Collingridge dilemma, we envision building three capacities: anticipation or foresight; integration across disciplines; and public engagement.

== Initiatives ==

=== Global Technology Governance Summit 2021 ===
This summit was first hosted in Japan in April 2021 by the World Economic Forum in collaboration with the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution Network (C4IR). The Global Technology Governance Summit has goals of becoming the leading authority on technology governance of emerging technologies by ensuring public-private collaboration.

IGF brings together people and groups to spread information to influence policy and best practices for the internet and technology. The aim of the organization is to get stakeholders from across the world and of various backgrounds to be involved, as it is seen as necessary in order advance public policies in the rapidly changing area of Internet Governance. Each year, the Internet Governance Forum is hosted by a country and facilitates discussion between governments and organizations around the world, identifying the key issues and topics surrounding Internet governance and related technology topics. In addition to identifying issues, the forum also hopes to find solutions to the issues that emerge from the misuse of the internet, constantly reviewing the guidelines and principles regarding internet governance.

The first IGF Conference was announced by the United Nations on July 18, 2006 and located in Athens, Greece. Since then, 12 more conferences has hosted the IGF with the website listing all 13 countries that have hosted IGF: starting from 2006 to 2018, showcasing countries such as Greece, Brazil, India, France and several others. According to the IGF, participants in the conference are usually from &quot;World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) and Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) accredited entities&quot; as well as other organizations that have proven expertise and background that is related to Internet governance.

=== IEEE - Advancing Technology for Humanity ===
IEEE is the world&#x27;s largest technical professional organization and aims to foster innovation and technological advancement to benefit society. Although IEEE stands for the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, as one of the largest organizations in the world, the organizations is composed of more than just engineers but professionals from scientists to software developers.

IEEE began in 1884 due to the increased influence of electricity in the world. The organization came from the merger of two different organizations, the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE) and the IRE. The AIEE began in 1884, formed in order to support industry professionals and their efforts to improve the standard of living in society. Although the organization was formed in New York, the first meeting was held in Philadelphia, PA, with many of the leaders coming from industries like telegraph, power, and telephone. As electricity advanced and grew, the organization focused more on electric power with its initial focus on telegraph and the telephone becoming secondary. IRE on the other hand was focused on radio, and more broadly to electronics. Although its similar to the AIEE and formed in the 1940s, it grew faster and became the larger group in 1957. Due to the growth of both organizations. in January 1963, the AIEE and the IRE merged and became known as the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). Today, the IEEE has more than 390,000 members and involved in more than 16 countries.

=== World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) ===
W3C is a global organization that allows groups and individuals to come together and advance Web standards. The organization is led by Director, Tim Berners-Lee, and the CEO, Jeffrey Jaffe and they achieve their goals by developing the protocols and guidelines pertaining to the Web to make sure that it is successful in the long-term. In addition, there is also a W3C team called W3C Evangelists, which serves like a Business Development team by helping with identification and recruitment of new members to W3C as well as operating events in their geographical location, promoting W3C, and helping connect donors and sponsorships. The organization is mainly funded through W3C membership dues, research grants, donations, and sponsorships. The W3C also has a free service for validating web pages, which although not mandatory, is helpful in having better quality pages.

According to its website, W3C was founded in October 1984 by Tim Berners-Lee at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology computer science lab. W3C collaborated with CERN and was supported by DRNA and the European Commission, hosting its first conference in April 1995. Since its beginnings, there has now been four major conferences held. The second conference was hosted at Keio University of Japan in 1996 and in 2003, the third ERCIM (European Research Consortium in Informatics and Mathematics) hosted the third conference in Europe, replacing the previous European W3C host, INRIA. The fourth host was in 2013, and hosted by Beihang University in China.

=== US Technology Policy Committee (USTPC) ===
The USTPC is a branch within the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) that is the main committee for facilitating the interaction of matters related to policies relating to information technology. One of the main ways the USTPC contributes is through providing informational reports on computing-related policy issues such as Digital Privacy, Deep Fakes, Cyber Security, and various more topics. The production of these reports and information is usually in response to requests for their expertise in technical areas, serving as a resource for decision-makers to get reliable information. The main audience groups that the USTPC provides its information to are the Congress, the Administration, and courts, helping them inform how changes in computing and technology influences public policy in the US.

The USTPC used to be known as USACM, was first began in 1992. Since then, there have been five different committee chairs, with the committee chair being James Hendler from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Hendler who works with Subcommittees of volunteers and collaborations with other organizations in order to operate and work toward their goals.

* From Paeroa, the river can be viewed from or near the Criterion Bridge, at the south end of town.
* State Highway 2 follows the path of the river through Karangahake Gorge most of the way between Paeroa and Waihi.
* The Karangahake Gorge Walkway, Hauraki Rail Trail and the Goldfields Railway follow respective parts of the river. At Karangahake, a car park and picnic area provide good access to the river.

==Gold mines==

At Karangahake Gorge the remains of the Crown and Talisman gold mines are visible from the Karangahake Gorge Historic walkway. At Waikino the Victoria Battery site has been opened as a public reserve. A railway line followed the river&#x27;s south bank eastward to Waihi until 1952. This is now part of the Hauraki Rail Trail.

On 23 August 2024, the Ohinemuri River turned bright orange, with an old mining shaft eventually confirmed as the source. Testing is underway as mining waste is often toxic.

==Old towns==
Several old mining towns are located along the river, including:
*Mackaytown is still extant, although a shadow of its former self.
*Karangahake is still extant and is at the western end of the Karangahake Gorge Walkway, and the northern end of Mt Karangahake Walkway.
*Owharoa is a ghost town 2 km west of Waikino.
*Waikino is still extant and is at the eastern end of the Karangahake Gorge Walkway and the Western end of the Goldfields Railway.

<text>A law collective is a non-hierarchical organization which provides legal aid to a community or communities in need. Such work ranges from traditional criminal defense, to advocacy on behalf of immigrants, to legal support at large and small protests, to &quot;Know Your Rights&quot; and other law-related workshops.

There were many law collectives in the 1970s. These collectives ran as worker-run, cooperative law firms. They often had revolutionary politics, and supported explicitly revolutionary groups and individuals. Lawyer and non-lawyer employees were paid the same wages, and had equal decision-making power. At some law collectives, workers supporting families were paid more. A handful of law collectives organized along those lines still exist - for example, the People&#x27;s Law Office in Chicago, Illinois and the Portland Law Collective in Portland, Oregon.

Such law collectives&#x27; activities may have been covertly disrupted by government officials in order to diminish their effectiveness. For example, the Bar Sinister law collective in Los Angeles was allegedly burgled by the FBI in 1971.

Since the 1999 Seattle WTO protests, there has been a small movement of activist law collectives. These groups are usually non-lawyer centered, run along anarchist principles (even if they do not explicitly identify as anarchist), and work as part of the movement for social justice. These law collectives are made up mostly or entirely of non-lawyers. They are located in cities including Philadelphia; Washington, DC; New York; Madison; Portland; Oakland; and Montreal, Quebec, Ottawa, Ontario, and Toronto, Ontario in Canada. Also, since June 2009, the Minnesota Law Collective has been open in St. Paul, Minnesota.

This new generation of law collective works to assist people in providing their own legal support. They give &quot;trainer trainings&quot; so people can give &quot;Know Your Rights&quot; and other workshops to their communities; teach people to provide legal support for their affinity groups or for specific protests; and to explain the law in general and law collective work in particular.

Law collectives have been central in the defense of activists from criminal prosecution in such protests including the Seattle WTO protests in November 1999; the &quot;A16&quot; World Bank and International Monetary Fund protests in 2000; the Republican and Democratic convention protests, also in 2000; the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) protests in 2001 and 2004; protests by the Ontario Coalition Against Poverty; in protests around the US against the war in Iraq in 2003; in New York, Oakland, and Chicago during the Occupy movement in 2011; and in after unarmed black men were killed by police officers in Ferguson and Baltimore in 2014 and 2015.

<text>Lugal-Zage-Si ( ; frequently spelled &quot;Lugalzaggesi&quot;, sometimes &quot;Lugalzagesi&quot; or &quot;Lugal-Zaggisi&quot;) of Umma (died 2334 BC) was the last Sumerian king before the conquest of Sumer by Sargon of Akkad and the rise of the Akkadian Empire, and was considered as the only king of the third dynasty of Uruk, according to the Sumerian King List. Initially, as king of Umma, he led the final victory of Umma in the generation-long conflict with the city-state Lagash for the fertile plain of Gu-Edin. Following up on this success, he then united Sumer briefly as a single kingdom.

==Filiation==
According to the &quot;Nippur vase of Lugalzagesi&quot;, Lugal-Zage-Si was the son of Ukush, governor of Umma:

== Reign ==
Lugal-Zage-Si pursued an expansionist foreign policy. He began his career as &quot;énsi&quot; of Umma, from where he conquered several of the Sumerian city-states. In the seventh year of his reign, Uruk fell under the leadership of Lugal-Zage-Si, &quot;énsi&quot; of Umma, who ultimately annexed most of the territory of Lagash under king Urukagina, and established the first reliably documented kingdom to encompass all of Sumer. The destruction of Lagash was described in a lament (possibly the earliest recorded example of what would become a prolific Sumerian literary genre), which stressed that:

Later, Lugal-Zage-Si invaded Kish, where he overthrew Ur-Zababa, Ur, Nippur, and Larsa; as well as Uruk, where he established his new capital. He ruled for 25 (or 34) years according to the &quot;Sumerian King List&quot;.

Lugal-Zage-Si claimed in his inscription that Enlil gave to him &quot;all the lands between the upper and the lower seas&quot;, that is, between the Mediterranean Sea and the Persian Gulf:

Although his incursion to the Mediterranean was, in the eyes of some modern scholars, not much more than &quot;a successful raiding party&quot;, the inscription &quot;marks the first time that a Sumerian prince claimed to have reached what was, for them, the western edge of the world&quot;. (Historical accounts from much later tablets asserted that Lugal-Anne-Mundu of Adab, a slightly earlier king, had also conquered as far as the Mediterranean and the Taurus mountains, but contemporary records for the entire period before Sargon are still far too sketchy to permit scholars to reconstruct actual events with great confidence.)

Lugal-Zage-Si himself was in turn defeated and his kingdom was annexed by Sargon of Akkad. According to later Babylonian versions of Sargon&#x27;s inscriptions, Sargon of Akkad captured Lugal-Zage-Si after destroying the walls of Uruk, and led him in a neck-stock to Enlil&#x27;s temple in Nippur:

==Nippur vase of Lugalzagesi==
The Nippur vase contains an extensive dedicatory inscription by Lugalzagesi, which has been reconstructed from the fragments of the vase:

<doc id="1175127" wikidata="Q272246" url="?curid=1175127" title="Johanne Luise Heiberg">
<text>Johanne Luise Heiberg (; née Pätges; 22 November 1812 – 21 December 1890) was a Danish actress of the 19th century. She is most famous for her work at the Royal Theatre in Copenhagen, where she achieved great success. Though she was closely connected to the romantic tradition, Heiberg is still regarded as a key figure of Danish drama. She contributed to the growing public social and moral perception of Danish actors as artists and cultural personalities rather than simply performers.

==Early life==
Heiberg was second youngest of nine children born to German emigrants. Her father Christian Heinrich Pätges was Roman Catholic, her mother Henriette (née Hartwig or Hirschborn) was Jewish. 
She showed artistic gifts very early and entered ballet school in 1820. With the help of patrons she was promoted to the rank of an actress and made a successful debut in 1827. From then on she was considered a leading actress of Danish theatre.

==Career==
In 1831 she married the much older critic and dramatist Johan Ludvig Heiberg (1791–1860). The marriage raised her position. The Heibergs became a Copenhagen concept and their home was a cultural centre. In return the dual position of Heiberg as the leading lady of the theatre married to its main playwright also aroused much jealousy and accusations of favouritism. Her husband&#x27;s time as the director of the Royal Theatre 1849-56 ended in an open conflict with her colleagues, and for a short period she even left the theatre. The death of her husband in 1860 and her age caused her retirement as an actress 1864 though she worked as a stage director until 1874.

Heiberg played about 275 roles. Her exotic beauty combined with culture and elegance secured her position. Among her roles were Shakespeare characters including Viola in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; and especially in French comedies and dramas. In Danish dramas she appeared in Holberg&#x27;s and Oehlenschläger&#x27;s plays, and especially in her husband&#x27;s dramas; notably in &quot;Elves&#x27; Hill&quot; (&quot;Elverhøi&quot;) was a classic. Her strength was intelligence, controlled passion and wit, but she did not show the same talent for tragedy. She especially inspired Henrik Hertz (1797–1870) to write many of his main female roles for her. She also wrote some few vaudeville acts herself; the most popular being “A Sunday at Amager” (&quot;En Søndag paa Amager&quot;).

==Legacy==
* Søren Kierkegaard wrote a tribute to her in 1847, &quot;The Crisis and a Crisis in the Life of an Actress&quot; (&quot;Krisen og en Krise i en Skuespillerindes Liv&quot;).
* Her 1891-92 autobiography, &quot;A Life Relived in Memory&quot; (&quot;Et Liv gjenoplevet i Erindringen&quot;) has often been criticised for its subjective descriptions but is still regarded as a pioneering work because of its interest regarding the process of acting.
* Her image was featured on the front of the Danish 1997 series 200-krone banknote. It went out of print in 2010.
* The drama &quot;Från regnormarnas liv&quot; (1981) by the Swedish author Per-Olov Enquist fictitiously deals with the relationship between Mrs Heiberg and Hans Christian Andersen.
* The Danish television drama &quot;1864&quot; (2014) features Heiberg as a confidant of the Council President Ditlev Gothard Monrad (1811–1887).

Gray made an immediate impact with the Fire, starting twenty games as a rookie while scoring two goals and five assists. He appeared in 28 games in 2003, again starting twenty, while scoring two goals and one assist. While playing more defensively in 2004, he started 23 games for the Fire, scoring one goal. Gray&#x27;s versatility may have been a hindrance to his development, however, as even three years into his career with the Fire, it is unclear what his position should be; although a consistent starter, he was longing to play in his hometown.

Gray was traded to San Jose Earthquakes in June 2005 in exchange for a second-round pick in the 2006 MLS SuperDraft. Along with the rest of his Earthquakes teammates, he moved to Houston for the 2006 season. Gray scored the winning goal in the second leg of Houston&#x27;s Champions&#x27; Cup tie with Puntarenas. In June 2007, Gray was traded with a second-round pick in the 2008 MLS SuperDraft to Los Angeles Galaxy in exchange for Nate Jaqua. He made his debut in Galaxy&#x27;s 2–0 victory over Chicago on 4 July 2007.

Due to the Galaxy&#x27;s increased salary cap restrictions, Gray was waived at the end of the 2007 season. He was picked up by Colorado Rapids at the start of the 2008 season, but played just two games for them before being traded with Jovan Kirovski to the newly reformed San Jose Earthquakes franchise in exchange for Preston Burpo and a fourth-round pick in the 2009 MLS SuperDraft. Gray stayed with San Jose until he was waived on June 25, 2009. He promptly retired from professional soccer choosing instead to run his own soccer academy, the &quot;Kelly Gray Soccer Academy.&quot;

===International===
Gray has played extensively with the Youth United States national teams, including at the 2001 World Youth Championship in Argentina, and has most recently been with the Under-23 team, which he captained in January 2003.

==Trivia==
Gray is the owner of a company called Adesso Clothing.

<text>Bryony Lavery (born 1947) is a British dramatist, known for her successful and award-winning 1998 play &quot;Frozen&quot;. In addition to her work in theatre, she has also written for television and radio. She has written books including the biography &quot;Tallulah Bankhead&quot; and &quot;The Woman Writer&#x27;s Handbook&quot;. She taught playwriting at the University of Birmingham.

==Biography==
Lavery grew up in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire.

Having begun her career as an actress, she decided that she wanted to write plays with better parts for women. Early in her career she founded a theatre company called &quot;Les Oeufs Malades&quot; (The Bad Eggs) with actors Gerard Bell and Jessica Higgs. She also founded Female Trouble, More Female Trouble, and served as artistic director of Gay Sweatshop.

Her plays have a feminist undertone. She has written such plays as &quot;More Light&quot;, which has only one male speaking role, with almost entirely female casts. Since 1976 she has written more than twenty plays. 

In addition, she has written translations of such works as Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot;. 

She has written five plays for the National Theatre Connections series. Her successful &quot;Frozen&quot; triggered a controversy and discussion about artistic sources and plagiarism. It was the subject of a piece by Malcolm Gladwell published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and collected in his book &quot;What the Dog Saw&quot;. 

She adapted &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, the novel by Robert Louis Stevenson, as a play which was first performed on the Olivier Stage of the National Theatre, London, on 3 December 2014.

She was married to a man until her early thirties. Since that period, Lavery has identified as gay.

<text>The Thames Valley is a non-administrative region in the North Island of New Zealand. Broadly, it is the valley component of the Waihou River catchment (which was formerly known as the Thames River). The lower part of the valley is more commonly known as the Hauraki Plains. Geographically the valley extends as far as the Hinuera Gap, although this is not often referred to as such. In geographical history of New Zealand, the Thames Valley was the path of the ancestral Waikato River when it discharged into the Firth of Thames over 20,000 years ago.

For local government administration, the Thames Valley is fully contained within the Waikato region, and is split between the Thames-Coromandel, Hauraki and Matamata-Piako Districts.

The region&#x27;s principal industry is dairy farming and is considered to be some of the most intensively farmed dairying areas in the world. The main towns are Thames, Paeroa, Ngatea and Te Aroha. While geographically the towns of Morrinsville and Matamata are also located within the Thames Valley, they are not typically treated as such, and their rugby clubs are affiliated with the Waikato provincial union.

The Thames Valley Rugby Team, known as the Swamp Foxes, play in the New Zealand Provincial Rugby Heartland Competition.

<text>The Conference and Workshop on Neural Information Processing Systems (abbreviated as NeurIPS and formerly NIPS) is a machine learning and computational neuroscience conference held every December. Along with ICLR and ICML, it is one of the three primary conferences of high impact in machine learning and artificial intelligence research.

The conference is currently a double-track meeting (single-track until 2015) that includes invited talks as well as oral and poster presentations of refereed papers, followed by parallel-track workshops that up to 2013 were held at ski resorts. 

== History ==

The NeurIPS meeting was first proposed in 1986 at the annual invitation-only Snowbird Meeting on Neural Networks for Computing organized by The California Institute of Technology and Bell Laboratories. NeurIPS was designed as a complementary open interdisciplinary meeting for researchers exploring biological and artificial Neural Networks. Reflecting this multidisciplinary approach, NeurIPS began in 1987 with information theorist Ed Posner as the conference president and learning theorist Yaser Abu-Mostafa as program chairman. Research presented in the early NeurIPS meetings included a wide range of topics from efforts to solve purely engineering problems to the use of computer models as a tool for understanding biological nervous systems. Since then, the biological and artificial systems research streams have diverged, and recent NeurIPS proceedings have been dominated by papers on machine learning, artificial intelligence and statistics.

From 1987 until 2000 NeurIPS was held in Denver, United States. Since then, the conference was held in Vancouver, Canada (2001–2010), Granada, Spain (2011), and Lake Tahoe, United States (2012–2013). In 2014 and 2015, the conference was held in Montreal, Canada, in Barcelona, Spain in 2016, in Long Beach, United States in 2017, in Montreal, Canada in 2018 and Vancouver, Canada in 2019. Reflecting its origins at Snowbird, Utah, the meeting was accompanied by workshops organized at a nearby ski resort up until 2013, when it outgrew ski resorts.

The first NeurIPS Conference was sponsored by the IEEE. The following NeurIPS Conferences have been organized by the NeurIPS Foundation, established by Ed Posner. Terrence Sejnowski has been the president of the NeurIPS Foundation since Posner&#x27;s death in 1993. The board of trustees consists of previous general chairs of the NeurIPS Conference.

The first proceedings was published in book form by the American Institute of Physics in 1987, and was entitled &quot;Neural Information Processing Systems&quot;, then the proceedings from the following conferences have been published by Morgan Kaufmann (1988–1993), MIT Press (1994–2004) and Curran Associates (2005–present) under the name &quot;Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems&quot;.

The conference was originally abbreviated as &quot;NIPS&quot;. By 2018 a few commentators were criticizing the abbreviation as encouraging sexism due to its association with the word &quot;nipples&quot;, and as being a slur against Japanese. The board changed the abbreviation to &quot;NeurIPS&quot; in November 2018.

== Topics ==

Along with machine learning and neuroscience, other fields represented at NeurIPS include cognitive science, psychology, computer vision, statistical linguistics, and information theory. Over the years, NeurIPS became a premier conference on machine learning and although the &#x27;Neural&#x27; in the NeurIPS acronym had become something of a historical relic, the resurgence of deep learning in neural networks since 2012, fueled by faster computers and big data, has led to achievements in speech recognition, object recognition in images, image captioning, language translation and world championship performance in the game of Go, based on neural architectures inspired by the hierarchy of areas in the visual cortex (ConvNet) and reinforcement learning inspired by the basal ganglia (Temporal difference learning).

Notable affinity groups have emerged from the NeurIPS conference and displayed diversity, including Black in AI (in 2017), Queer in AI (in 2016), and others.

===Named lectures===
In addition to invited talks and symposia, NeurIPS also organizes two named lectureships to recognize distinguished researchers. The NeurIPS Board introduced the Posner Lectureship in honor of NeurIPS founder Ed Posner; two Posner Lectures were given each year up to 2015. Past lecturers have included:

*2010 – Josh Tenenbaum and Michael I. Jordan
*2011 – Rich Sutton and Bernhard Schölkopf
*2012 – Thomas Dietterich and Terry Sejnowski
*2013 – Daphne Koller and Peter Dayan
*2014 – Michael Kearns and John Hopfield
*2015 – Zoubin Ghahramani and Vladimir Vapnik
*2016 – Yann LeCun
*2017 – John Platt
*2018 – Joëlle Pineau
*2019 – Yoshua Bengio
*2020 – Christopher Bishop
*2021 – Peter Bartlett

In 2015, the NeurIPS Board introduced the Breiman Lectureship to highlight work in statistics relevant to conference topics. The lectureship was named for statistician Leo Breiman, who served on the NeurIPS Board from 1994 to 2005. Past lecturers have included:

*2015 – Robert Tibshirani
*2016 – Susan Holmes
*2017 – Yee Whye Teh
*2018 – David Spiegelhalter
*2019 – Bin Yu
*2020 – Marloes Maathuis
*2021 – Gabor Lugosi
*2022 – Emmanuel Candes
*2023 – Susan Murphy
*2024 – Arnaud Doucet

== NIPS experiment ==
In NIPS 2014, the program chairs duplicated 10% of all submissions and sent them through separate reviewers to evaluate randomness in the reviewing process. Several researchers interpreted the result. Regarding whether the decision in NIPS is completely random or not, John Langford writes: &quot;Clearly not—a purely random decision would have arbitrariness of ~78%. It is, however, quite notable that 60% is much closer to 78% than 0%.&quot; He concludes that the result of the reviewing process is mostly arbitrary.

Jhanjharpur town is connected with, Kamla Balan bridge, a century-old 220 ft bridge built by the British in the early 1900s, being a rail-cum-road bridge (first rail-cum-road bridge in India) It facilitates the movement of dozen of trains and hundreds of vehicles every day to and from Jhanjharpur. Jhanjharpur is also connected to number of other places and destination via NH 57.

The nearest airport is Darbhanga Airport which is 48 km away from Jhanjharpur. People can also take their flights for the different cities of India from the Lok Nayak Jayprakash Narayan International Airport which is 191 km away from Jhanjharpur and present in the capital city of Bihar &quot;Patna&quot;.

==Trade==

Laukaha is a nearby town close to the border of Nepalese town of Thadi. Laukaha in India and Thadi in Nepal are a part of one of the agreed route for Mutual Trade between India and Nepal.

<doc id="1175164" wikidata="Q5584401" url="?curid=1175164" title="Goramansingh">
<text>Goramansingh also known as Gauramansingh is a small village in the Darbhanga district of Bihar, India. It is located approximately 62 kilometers east of Darbhanga (the district headquarters) and 12 kilometers east from its subdivisional headquarters of Biraul on the bank of the Kamala River in Bihar.

==Geography==

Goramansingh is situated in the Darbhanga district of the state of Bihar in India. The village is located in the Gaura-Bauram block of the Biraul sub-division of Darbhanga.

==Economy==
Goramansingh is one of the most underdeveloped areas in India. It does not have good roads. Every year in July floods hit the area and often cause damage. Flooded areas take a long time to dry out which leads to many problems, including financial hardship and human suffering.

Agriculture is the main occupation of the villagers. The Supaul Bazar is the main business hub of the village. People from remote areas often visit it in order to purchase goods.

==Politics==
This village is not a king maker but it has a great number of voters. In every election leaders come here but afterwards they never look back. Villagers are on their own. While some persons are trying to make a difference but without government help they are unable to do any good.

==Language and culture==

===Mithila, Maithil and Maithili===

The Maithili language is widely spoken in the Mithila region (Darbhanga, Madhubani, Samastipur, Saharsa and Purnia district) of Bihar as well as Terai districts of Nepal. There is a lot of culture associated with this region: songs like &quot;Bhagvati Song&quot;, &quot;Batgavni&quot;, &quot;Sohar&quot;, dances like Jaat-Jatin and Jhumar, festivals such as Chauthchandra, Ghari puja, Joor Sital and others.

&quot;Baat Taakna&quot; means &quot;to wait&quot;; a married girl is waiting for her husband in the dark night, but her husband loves the moonlight. He always comes in the moonlight to meet her. This song is based upon the culture of the Mithila.

===Castes===

The majority of people in Goramansingh are of the chaupal caste. They are very gentle and are known for their hospitality. The villages is also the home of other castes such as Kayasth, Dhanuk, Badhay (carpenter), Khatvay, Muslim, Nai, Dhobi, Kumhar, Chamar Dom and a very small percentage of Brahman. Everyone lives here in harmony. OBC and SC/ST have high percentage in this village. They often decide the political game here. But under the influence of fraternity they work along with whole village.

===Festivals===
Durga Puja: Durga Puja is one of the most celebrated festival of this village. Every year in Ashwin month people come here from many villages to visit. The temple is made by villagers&#x27; contribution. In Dashara whole village contribute money as Chanda to make this festival stunning. Deities are made of Sangmarmar. On the last day of Dashara people gathers in Mandir Parisar for feast.

MakarSankranti: This festival takes place on 14 or 15 January. On the eve of this festival, people of the village take a holy bath in the pond in the winter morning. After that, they light a fire to warm themselves. The children enjoy eating a special breakfast in front of the fire. The morning breakfast on the day of &quot;Makarsankrati&quot; includes sweets made from parched rice, flattened rice, tilkut, sugarcane, dahi (curd or yogurt) and more. Women perform puja in their homes and distribute &quot;Prasaad&quot; among the children and other members of their family. &quot;Khichri&quot; is a very important dish on this day.

Holi: On the eve of the festival people enjoy different colour and gulal. The way of playing Holi in the village is somewhat different from its neighbouring area. Villagers first play Holi only with colour from 8am to 1pm. After 1pm, they play only gulal till 8pm. Villagers shake hands with each other and take blessings from the elders during gulal spraying.

Vaisakhi or Joor Sital: This festival always falls on 14 April just after Amavasaya (New Moon) of the Chaitra month, and it marks the beginning of the new year. The Amavasaya of Chaitra month is the last day of the Hindu year. The next day marks the beginning of the new year according to the Hindu calendar. The festival is known by various names in different parts of India: Vaisakhi in Northern India and Vishu in the Kerala region. People of the Mithila region know this festival as Joor Sital. Villagers of the Mithila region celebrate the festival in different ways. On the day of the Joor Sital, every elder of each family gets up early in the morning. They give blessings to every younger one. The way of blessing is taking water (&quot;Jal&quot;) in a bended palm leaf (&quot;Htheli&quot;) and placing their palm on the head of younger ones at least three or five times. People perform puja at home in a mango garden. They offer Baasi (cooked food in night), Vari and Rice to God. Every child pours water onto the dry land. They irrigate all plants and trees in their own garden.

Chhath: The festival of the Chhath falls on the sixth day of the Hindu month of Kartik (late October or mid-November) in the Hindu lunar calendar every year. The Chhath falls on the month of Kartik, known as Dala Chhath. Another type of Chhath is Chaiti Chhath which falls on the month of Chaitra (late April or mid-May). The Dala Chhath is one of the holier festivals for Biharis. The way of celebrating Chhath in the village Goramansingh is almost the same as celebrating Chhath in the rest of Bihar. There are many songs dedicated to the Chhath festival.

==Wildlife==

Many migratory birds land in marshes around the village from December to March. These birds originate from Nepal, Bhutan, Pakistan, Tibet, China, Siberia and Mongolia. Important migratory birds seen in the village include:

*&quot;Local name:&quot; Lalshar, Dighouch, Mail, Nakta, Silli, Adhani, Harial, Chaha, Karan, Ratwa, Gaiber
*&quot;Biological names:&quot; Dalmatian pelican, Indian darter bar-headed goose, white-winged wood duck, marbled duck, Baer&#x27;s pochard, Siberian crane, Indian skimmer and Oriental goosander.

<doc id="1175165" wikidata="Q754034" url="?curid=1175165" title="Japanese serow">
<text>The (Capricornis crispus) (羚羊) is a Japanese goat-antelope, an even-toed ungulate. It is found in dense woodland in Japan, primarily in northern and central Honshu. The serow is seen as a national symbol of Japan, and is subject to protection in conservation areas.

Adult Japanese serow stand about tall and weigh . They are black to whitish, and colouring lightens in summer. The fur is very bushy, especially the tail. Both sexes have short, backwards-curving horns, and are difficult to distinguish by sight. Japanese serow are found in dense mountain forests where they eat leaves, shoots, and acorns. They are diurnal and feed in early mornings and late afternoons. Serows are solitary, or gather in couples or small family groups. The animal marks its territory with sweet-and-sour-smelling preorbital gland secretions, and males and females have separate territories that may overlap.

In the mid-20th century, the Japanese serow was hunted to near-extinction. In 1955, the Japanese government passed a law designating it a &quot;Special National Monument&quot; to protect it from poachers. Populations have since grown so greatly that the IUCN Red List of Threatened Animals ranks it &quot;least concern&quot;. Complaints from foresters and farmers led in 1979 to the 1955 law&#x27;s repeal. Since then, the serow has had protected status in 13 designated protected areas over 23 prefectures, and has been subject to culling as a pest outside conservation areas. Conservationists have labelled it a &quot;living national treasure of the forest&quot;.

==Taxonomy==

Taxonomically Coenraad Jacob Temminck first described the Japanese serow in 1836, and named it &quot;Antilope crispa&quot;. John Edward Gray gave it its current name in 1846. Pierre Marie Heude proposed many new genera and species in a system published in 1898; &quot;Capricornis&quot; became &quot;Capricornulus&quot;, which included &quot;crispus&quot;, &quot;pryerianus&quot;, and &quot;saxicola&quot;. The system did not find acceptance.

There is no fossil record of the Japanese serow; its evolutionary history and the closeness of its relation to the Taiwan serow (&quot;Capricornis swinhoei&quot;) are speculative. Its taxonomic position has led to it being called a &quot;living fossil&quot;. Karyotype studies indicate it was the earliest species to split from the common &quot;Capricornis&quot; ancestor. The closest relative to the Japanese serow is the Taiwan serow (&quot;Capricornis swinhoei&quot;). Genetically, there is little difference between Japanese and Taiwan serows; their karyotype is essentially the same: 2n=50, FN=60. The Taiwan serow is smaller and shorter-haired, with browner fur and a white patch under the chin and throat.

Phylogenetically, &quot;Capricornis&quot; is closer to goats and sheep than cattle. The nomenclature and status of &quot;Capricornis&quot; taxa are not completely resolved. Some researchers have considered &quot;Capricornis&quot; a junior synonym of &quot;Naemorhedus&quot;, a classification that includes gorals; molecular analysis has not supported this classification. &quot;Capricornis&quot; has a lower canine, which &quot;Naemorhedus&quot; species usually do not.

In Japan, the serow is widely thought of as a kind of deer, though deer and serows are in different families. In the past, the Japanese word &#x27; was written using the Chinese character for &#x27;, meaning &quot;deer&quot;. Today, when written using Chinese characters, the characters for &quot;antelope&quot; and &quot;sheep&quot; are used. Sometimes the serow is mistaken for a wild boar.

==Appearance and anatomy==

The Japanese serow is a small bovid whose displayed morphology is primitive in relation to other bovids. It has a stocky body whose size varies little between sexes or geographic location; it stands about tall ( at the shoulder) and weighs . The hoof is cloven. Compared to mainland serow, the ears are shorter and the coat is typically longer and woollier—about on the body. It has a bushy tail of and no mane.

Its fur is whitish around the neck, and fur on the body may be black, black with a dorsal white spot, dark brown, or whitish. The coat lightens in summer. There are three well-developed skin glands: large preorbital glands in both sexes, which increase in size as the animal ages; poorly developed interdigital glands in all four legs; and preputial glands. The adult&#x27;s 32 permanent teeth form by 30 months, and have a dental formula of . The inner sides of the teeth become blackened with a hard-to-remove substance, likely tree resin. The tongue has a V-shaped apex.


Differentiation between the sexes is not well developed; body size, growth, survival, and feeding habits show negligible difference. Both sexes have short, backwards-curving horns measuring ; the sheaths have a series of transverse rings. Horns begin to develop at about four months and continue to grow throughout the lifespan.

Environment affects the size of the first growth ring. Size, curvature, and thickness and number of transverse rings are indicative of age. Up to two years, there are thicker transverse rings, of greater length and flexion than in adults. Into adulthood, thinner horn rings force the thick transverse rings upward. Growth increment slows earlier in maturation in females than in males. Researchers use genitalia and sexual behaviour to distinguish the sexes. Females have two pairs of mammae.

Hearing is sensitive and eyesight is strong—the serow is able to detect and react to movement from a distance, and it can see well in low lighting. Sense of smell is also strong, and the serow can be observed raising its head and sniffing the air around it.

==Distribution, ecology, and behaviour==

&quot;Capricornis crispus&quot; is the only wild bovine ruminant in Japan, and is endemic to three of the four main islands of Japan: primarily northern and central Honshu, and small areas in Shikoku and Kyushu. It can tolerate colder, snowier climates better than mainland serows. The animal is found solitary, in pairs, or in small family groups in open grassland and forests at an elevation of about , and uses caves to rest in. It prefers temperate deciduous forest, but also lives in broad-leaved or subalpine coniferous forest made up of Japanese beech, Japanese oak, alpine meadow, and coniferous plantations. Population density is low, at an average of , and no greater than .

&quot;C. crispus&quot; is philopatric and territorial, and marks trees with sweet-sour-smelling preorbital gland secretions to indicate its territory. Males and females establish separate, overlapping ranges, typically , but the male&#x27;s is typically larger than the female&#x27;s. Aggression is rare, but the serow may react with hostility to territorial breaches. Due to the extinction of its once-primary predator, the Japanese wolf, the Japanese black bear is its only predator. It flees with a whistling snort when it detects danger. It is an agile, sure-footed mountain dweller that is able to sprint up mountains and to jump from cliff to cliff to safety; hunters have likened this display of agility to the ninja.

The diurnal Japanese serow is a browser that feeds in early morning and late afternoon, primarily on fleshy or coniferous leaves, plant shoots, and acorns. It feeds on alder, sedge, Japanese witch-hazel (&quot;Hamamelis japonica&quot;), and Japanese cedar. It adjusts its diet to what food is locally available, and, as a ruminant, the serow has a four-chambered stomach. Studies indicate that even severe winters have a negligible impact on the serow&#x27;s food intake, suggesting that, given its solitary social structure, it selects its territory to ensure sufficient food supply. Defecation occurs in set locations.

Life expectancies may be up to 20–25 years. Parapoxvirus is common, though rarely fatal; infection causes papular and nodular lesions. There have been epidemics of contagious pustular dermatitis. Bacteria such as &quot;E. coli&quot; and &quot;Lyme borreliosis&quot; are common, and &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot; has been reported. &quot;C. crispus&quot; is susceptible to numerous parasites, such as the nematode &quot;Trichuris discolor&quot; and the lungworm &quot;Protostrongylus shiozawai&quot;.

===Reproduction===

&quot;Capricornis crispus&quot; is socially monogamous. Females reach sexual maturity at 30 months. First breeding takes place at age 2.5–3 years; breeding occurs once a year, between September and January. In a courtship ritual resembling that of goats or gazelles, the male Japanese serow licks the female&#x27;s mouth, strikes her on the hindlegs with his forelegs, and rubs her genitalia with his horns. Both sexes display Flehmen responses.

Birth takes place between June and August after a gestation period of about 210–220 days. It takes about half an hour, and the female walks about during the birth. The single fawn is tall and reaches adult height in a year. The fawn stays with its mother for 1–2 years. It then moves gradually from its mother&#x27;s range until it establishes its own. Young that do not disperse on their own may be chased away by the mother.


==Relationship with humans==
The earliest record of human contact with the serow is of a small number of prehistoric Jōmon period bones unearthed by archaeologists, primarily in mountainous regions. It is speculated the serow was hunted for its hide and for food. What is believed to be the earliest written record appears in the &#x27; (720): the Emperor Tenmu (r. 672–686) sent the hides of a &#x27; to senior statesmen; this &quot;&quot; likely refers to the serow, and recurs elsewhere in the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;.

The 8th-century &quot;&quot; contains a waka poem by Kakinomoto no Hitomaro that mentions a group of &quot;shishi&quot;; a number of writers have concluded this animal is the serow, but others have pointed out the serow is normally solitary. Heian period (794–1185) documents record gifts of serow horns brought to the capital. Japan&#x27;s earliest extant medical work, the (808), appears to record the use of serow horn and flesh for medicinal purposes.

For centuries following the Heian period, mention of the serow becomes scarce. There is some belief that it was still hunted for medicinal use. The Edo period (1603–1868) saw records increase. The &quot;&quot; encyclopaedia of 1712 contains an illustrated entry on the serow. came into effect, but exceptions were made where animals damaged crops. Following the Meiji Restoration in 1868, realistic depictions appeared of the serow, beginning with one in Keisuke Ito&#x27;s &quot;Fauna Japonica&quot; (1870).

===Hunting and conservation===

The serow has long been hunted in Japan, especially in northern Japan where, along with bear-hunting, serow-hunting was strongly associated with &quot;matagi&quot; culture. Throughout Japan&#x27;s mountainous regions, the serow has been a valued catch. Its various body parts are used without waste. Prized in particular is its meat—until the mid-20th century, serow meat was so widely eaten in these regions the animal itself was known as &quot;meat&quot;. Its waterproof hides were used for rafters&#x27; backflaps, its horns were ground as a preventive against diseases such as beriberi, and a cure for stomach-aches was made from the serow&#x27;s small intestines and gall bladder.

An animal that once inhabited deep forests far from populated areas, the Japanese serow has increasingly penetrated the outskirts of villages. In western Honshū, it had become extinct by the 20th century. Elsewhere, it had been hunted to such a severe degree that the Japanese government declared it a &quot;Non-Game Species&quot; in a 1925 hunting law. In 1934, the Law for Protection of Cultural Properties designated it a &quot;Natural Monument Species&quot;.

Poaching continued, leading the government to declare the Japanese serow a &quot;Special Natural Monument&quot; in 1955, at which point overhunting had brought its numbers to 2000–3000. Populations grew as the police put an end to poaching, and post-War monoculture conifer plantations created favourable environments for the animal. By the 1980s, population estimates had grown to up to 100,000 and serow range had reached . Between 1978 and 2003, its distribution increased 170%, and the population had stabilized.

Conflicts with agriculture and forestry led to a 1978 repeal of the full protection the animal received under the 1955 designation. Thenceforth, 13 designated protection areas were established over 23 prefectures. They cover about 20% of the serow range, have a total area of , and range in size from to . Culling removed 20,000 serows outside of conservation areas between 1978 and 2005.

The IUCN Red List of Threatened Animals ranked the Japanese serow as &quot;least concern&quot; in 2008, as it has wide distribution in Japan, and a large, stable or increasing population. The and provide for the legal management of the Japanese serow. In 1979, the Agency for Cultural Affairs, Environmental Agency, and Forestry Agency reached an agreement on serow management measures, such as the establishment of protection areas and culling as pest control. The measures were met with resistance from conservationists, naturalist organizations, and some biologists, as the animal had previously been fully protected. A 1999 amendment to the Wildlife Protection and Hunting Law allowed prefectures to manage wildlife populations; by 2007, seven plans had been established for serow management outside of conservation areas.

Foresters have raised concerns that the rising serow populations have interfered with post-War mountainside reforestation efforts, as the animal feeds on the saplings of Japanese cypress, Japanese cedar, and Japanese red pine, species with commercial significance. Serow have caused damage to farm crops in mountain villages, and the villagers have objected to conservationists&#x27; efforts. Damage by serows to forests has been characterized in parts of Japan in criminal or martial terms: the media have referred to the problems as &#x27; (&quot;the war between humans and deer&quot;) and &#x27; (&quot;serow war&quot;).

Frustration with the government and conservationists led 400 foresters to launch a lawsuit in the 1980s over serow damage to timber plantations. Foresters in Gifu Prefecture have justified the shooting of serows in the legs, as such shooting would not be fatal. Estimating accurate population numbers has been difficult. Foresters see the serow as a harmful animal, and resent government interference in controlling serow-hunting. They have accused the government and wildlife experts of undercounting serows, while conservationists have counteraccused that foresters may inflate population numbers and levels of forestry damage to promote their own interests.

Conservationists such as Shin Gotō believe that the increased visibility is due not to an absolute increase in populations, but to deforestation which has driven the animal further from its traditional home. Serows close to populated areas may feed on farms and cypress, including saplings.

Clearcutting practices may also contribute to the problem, as clearcut forests create areas of rapid herbaceous growth ideal for herbivores, who see population increases. The situation is temporary, though, and after regrowth of trees leads to the forest canopy closing over after 15–20 years, the herbivore populations are displaced as the herbaceous growth ceases to flourish.

In the 1990s, as the number of young plantations decreased, so did forestry damage from serows. Concern instead turned to damage caused by sika deer, wild boars, and Japanese macaques. In Kyushu in particular, increased grazing and browsing competition from sika deer may be slowing growth of serow populations.

===Cultural significance===

Labelled a &quot;living national treasure of the forest&quot;, the Japanese serow has achieved emblematic status in Japan with national associations. It is seen as a relic species harking back to the formation of the Japanese archipelago as distinct from mainland Asia. In a symbolic gesture in 1973, the Chinese government gifted Japan a giant panda, to which the Japanese government returned two Japanese serow. Municipalities and other regions of Japan have adopted the serow as a local symbol.

In Japan, the Japanese serow is most commonly known as &#x27; or &#x27;. It has historically been given a variety of names, often based on its appearance, some of which translate as &quot;mountain sheep&quot;, &quot;wool deer&quot;, &quot;nine tail cow&quot;, and &quot;cow demon&quot;. Regional names abound, some of which translate as &quot;dancing beast&quot;, &quot;foolish beast&quot;, or &quot;idiot&quot;. Japanese people often characterize the serow as &quot;weird&quot; or &quot;abnormal&quot;, and it is seen as a &quot;phantom animal&quot; as it tends to live alone in the depths of distant forests, and appears to observe forest workers from areas high in the mountains.

The serow has a reputation in Japan for its speed and agility. Superior athletes are compared to the serow, as it is known not only for its agility, but also its sprinting ability. The Yamaha Motor Company has marketed the XT 225 sport motorcycle as the Yamaha Serow. In Japanese, the word &#x27; means both &quot;to fail an exam&quot; and &quot;to fall&quot;; as the serow is known for its sure-footedness on mountain cliffs, students can buy &#x27; charms marked with a serow hoofprint in the hope it will help them pass exams.

<text>Jeff Cassar (born February 2, 1974) is an American soccer coach and former goalkeeper who last coached Real Salt Lake of Major League Soccer.

==Playing career==
Cassar played college soccer at Florida International University, where he was roommates with Steve Ralston. Following his graduation, he was selected eighth overall in the 1996 MLS College Draft by the Dallas Burn. Although Cassar made the team, Mark Dodd took firm hold of the starting position, and Cassar only appeared in two games that season. After spending all of the 1997 season injured with a torn ACL, Cassar was selected tenth overall in the 1997 MLS Expansion Draft by the Miami Fusion. Cassar started much of the Fusion&#x27;s inaugural season, appearing in twenty-one games, all starts, and compiling a GAA of 1.95. After splitting starting duties with Garth Lagerway in 1999, Cassar lost his job to Nick Rimando, and would start just ten games for Miami in 2000 and 2001. Upon Miami&#x27;s contraction at the end of the 2001 season, Cassar was again selected by the Burn in the 2002 MLS Dispersal Draft, but failing to make the team, went looking for work overseas. Cassar found a job as the backup for Bolton Wanderers in England, and would remain with the team from March to June 2002.

Cassar returned to the United States at the end of the English season, and signed with the Atlanta Silverbacks of the A-League, for whom he appeared in six games. Cassar joined Dallas for a third time the next year, signing on as a backup for D.J. Countess following Matt Jordan&#x27;s departure for Europe. Cassar appeared in seven games for the Burn in 2003, doing a passable, if unexceptional, job for the team. Following the 2003 season, the Burn brought in a new coach, Colin Clarke, who traded away Countess and replaced him with Scott Garlick. Although Garlick began the season as the team&#x27;s starting goalkeeper, an injury midseason gave Cassar the opportunity to seize the position, which he did with a series of impressive performances; he ended the season as the club&#x27;s starting goalkeeper, having made nineteen starts.

Following the 2006 season, Cassar retired.

==Coaching==
Cassar was appointed by new head coach Steve Morrow, Clarke&#x27;s replacement, as the team&#x27;s goalkeeper coach. In May 2007, he became the goalkeeper coach for Real Salt Lake. However, he also spent time at the end of the season as an assistant with the Puerto Rico Islanders of the USL First Division.

Jeff was called on as a goalkeeper coach for the U.S. Men&#x27;s National Team in September 2013 during their world cup qualification bid against Mexico.

On December 18, 2013, Cassar was named the new head coach of Real Salt Lake, replacing Jason Kreis after the latter became head coach of New York City FC.

After serving as the head coach of Real Salt Lake for three full seasons in Major League Soccer, Cassar was dismissed on March 20, 2017, following an 0-2-1 start to the 2017 MLS season. Cassar&#x27;s assistant coach Daryl Shore was appointed interim head coach on the same day.

Cassar joined the staff of the Dallas Hornets youth club in July 2023.

<text>A talking stick, also called a speaker&#x27;s staff, is an instrument of Indigenous democracy used by a number of Indigenous communities, especially those in the Pacific Northwest nations of North America. The talking stick may be passed around a group, as multiple people speak in turn, or used only by leaders as a symbol of their authority and right to speak in public.

Akan chiefs in Western Africa have a tradition of speaker&#x27;s staffs capped with gold-leafed finials. These emerged in the 19th century as a symbol of the holder&#x27;s power.

==Pacific Northwest Coast art==
Among many of the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest, talking sticks are carved wooden staffs, which can either bear a single crest at the top or be fully carved with heraldic clan crests of the chief or hereditary political spokesman. The staffs can include shell inlay. The staffs resemble small totem poles and are still used ceremonially today. At gatherings, especially potlatches, a chief or their designated speaker holds the talking stick and makes announcements. The speaker thumps the stick on the ground for emphasis. In some situations, a feather has been used as a stand-in for the talking stick.

Talking sticks are a contemporary Northwest Coast art form with great symbolic importance. Tsimshian woodcarver David A. Boxley was commissioned to sculpt a crown of a talking stick for the 1990 Goodwill Games, that incorporated symbolism of the United States and Russia. This staff was carried from Spokane, Washington to Oregon and on to Seattle, Washington by participating athletes. Talking sticks are also incorporated into totem poles. In 1988 Kwakwaka&#x27;wakw Richard Hunt carved the world&#x27;s largest totem pole featuring a Cedar Man wielding a 4.3 meter (14 foot) tall talking stick. Representations of chiefs are carved in totem poles carrying talking sticks as well as coppers.

<doc id="1175180" wikidata="Q12162442" url="?curid=1175180" title="Mathematics of three-phase electric power">
<text>In electrical engineering, three-phase electric power systems have at least three conductors carrying alternating voltages that are offset in time by one-third of the period. A three-phase system may be arranged in delta (∆) or star (Y) (also denoted as wye in some areas, as symbolically it is similar to the letter &#x27;Y&#x27;). A wye system allows the use of two different voltages from all three phases, such as a 230/400 V system which provides 230 V between the neutral (centre hub) and any one of the phases, and 400 V across any two phases. A delta system arrangement provides only one voltage, but it has a greater redundancy as it may continue to operate normally with one of the three supply windings offline, albeit at 57.7% of total capacity. Harmonic current in the neutral may become very large if nonlinear loads are connected.

==Definitions==
In a star (wye) connected topology, with rotation sequence L1 - L2 - L3, the time-varying instantaneous voltages can be calculated for each phase A,C,B respectively by:

: formula_1

: formula_2

: formula_3

where:

:formula_4 is the peak voltage,
:formula_5 is the phase angle in radians 
::formula_6 is the time in seconds 
::formula_7 is the frequency in cycles per second and
:voltages L1-N, L2-N and L3-N are referenced to the star connection point.

==Diagrams==
The below images demonstrate how a system of six wires delivering three phases from an alternator may be replaced by just three. A three-phase transformer is also shown.

==Balanced loads==
Generally, in electric power systems, the loads are distributed as evenly as is practical among the phases. It is usual practice to discuss a balanced system first and then describe the effects of unbalanced systems as deviations from the elementary case.

===Constant power transfer ===
An important property of three-phase power is that the instantaneous power available to a resistive load, formula_8, is constant at all times. Indeed, let 

: formula_9

To simplify the mathematics, we define a nondimensionalized power for intermediate calculations, formula_10

: formula_11

Hence (substituting back):

: formula_12

Since we have eliminated formula_13 we can see that the total power does not vary with time. This is essential for keeping large generators and motors running smoothly.

Notice also that using the root mean square voltage formula_14, the expression for formula_15 above takes the following more classic form:
:formula_16.

The load need not be resistive for achieving a constant instantaneous power since, as long as it is balanced or the same for all phases, it may be written as

: formula_17

so that the peak current is

: formula_18

for all phases and the instantaneous currents are

: formula_19

: formula_20

: formula_21

Now the instantaneous powers in the phases are

: formula_22

: formula_23

: formula_24

Using angle subtraction formulae:

: formula_25

: formula_26

: formula_27

which add up for a total instantaneous power

: formula_28

Since the three terms enclosed in square brackets are a three-phase system, they add up to zero and the total power becomes

: formula_29
or
: formula_30
showing the above contention.

Again, using the root mean square voltage formula_14, formula_15 can be written in the usual form
:formula_33.

===No neutral current===
For the case of equal loads on each of three phases, no net current flows in the neutral. The neutral current is the inverted vector sum of the line currents. See Kirchhoff&#x27;s circuit laws.

:formula_34

We define a non-dimensionalized current, formula_35:

:formula_36

Since we have shown that the neutral current is zero we can see that removing the neutral core will have no effect on the circuit, provided the system is balanced. Such connections are generally used only when the load on the three phases is part of the same piece of equipment (for example a three-phase motor), as otherwise switching loads and slight imbalances would cause large voltage fluctuations.

==Unbalanced systems==
In practice, systems rarely have perfectly balanced loads, currents, voltages and impedances in all three phases. The analysis of unbalanced cases is greatly simplified by the use of the techniques of symmetrical components. An unbalanced system is analysed as the superposition of three balanced systems, each with the positive, negative or zero sequence of balanced voltages.

When specifying wiring sizes in a three-phase system, we only need to know the magnitude of the phase and neutral currents. The neutral current can be determined by adding the three phase currents together as complex numbers and then converting from rectangular to polar co-ordinates. If the three-phase root mean square (RMS) currents are formula_37, formula_38, and formula_39, the neutral RMS current is:
: formula_40

which resolves to
: formula_41

The polar magnitude of this is the square root of the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts, which reduces to
: formula_42

===Non-linear loads===
With linear loads, the neutral only carries the current due to imbalance between the phases. Devices that utilize rectifier-capacitor front ends (such as switch-mode power supplies for computers, office equipment and the like) introduce third order harmonics. Third harmonic currents are in-phase on each of the supply phases and therefore will add together in the neutral which can cause the neutral current in a wye system to exceed the phase currents.

==Revolving magnetic field==
Any polyphase system, by virtue of the time displacement of the currents in the phases, makes it possible to easily generate a magnetic field that revolves at the line frequency. Such a revolving magnetic field makes polyphase induction motors possible. Indeed, where induction motors must run on single-phase power (such as is usually distributed in homes), the motor must contain some mechanism to produce a revolving field, otherwise the motor cannot generate any stand-still torque and will not start. The field produced by a single-phase winding can provide energy to a motor already rotating, but without auxiliary mechanisms the motor will not accelerate from a stop.

A rotating magnetic field of steady amplitude requires that all three phase currents be equal in magnitude, and accurately displaced one-third of a cycle in phase. Unbalanced operation results in undesirable effects on motors and generators.

==Conversion to other phase systems==
Provided two voltage waveforms have at least some relative displacement on the time axis, other than a multiple of a half-cycle, any other polyphase set of voltages can be obtained by an array of passive transformers. Such arrays will evenly balance the polyphase load between the phases of the source system. For example, balanced two-phase power can be obtained from a three-phase network by using two specially constructed transformers, with taps at 50% and 86.6% of the primary voltage. This &quot;Scott T&quot; connection produces a true two-phase system with 90° time difference between the phases. Another example is the generation of higher-phase-order systems for large rectifier systems, to produce a smoother DC output and to reduce the harmonic currents in the supply.

When three-phase is needed but only single-phase is readily available from the electricity supplier, a phase converter can be used to generate three-phase power from the single phase supply. A motor–generator is often used in factory industrial applications.

==System measurements==
In a three-phase system, at least two transducers are required to measure power when there is no neutral, or three transducers when there is a neutral. Blondel&#x27;s theorem states that the number of measurement elements required is one less than the number of current-carrying conductors.

<text>Mario Alberto Butler Graham (born January 15, 1957) is a Panamanian retired professional basketball player.

Butler spent most of his career playing in the Baloncesto Superior Nacional (BSN) in Puerto Rico. At , he played center and was known for his rebounding skills. He is the BSN all-time rebounding leader with 8,236 rebounds.

==Panama==
Butler grew up on the streets of Panama City, where he picked up the game of basketball at around the age of 9. Butler quickly became famous around his neighborhood for his abilities, and he eventually earned a scholarship to an American university and a spot on the Panama national basketball team.

He studied at Briar Cliff College in Sioux City, Iowa, where he befriended another Panamanian and future basketball legend in Puerto Rico, Rolando Frazer. Butler and Frazer, had played together with Panama&#x27;s national team; away from home, however, they were also able to establish a friendship. Mario graduated in 1979 and was an integral part of Briar Cliff&#x27;s famous Panama Pipeline. He played in 102 games during his career, scoring 815 points and totaling 664 rebounds, which ranked 14th and seventh all-time, respectively, at the time of his graduation. He shot 55.4 percent for his career and averaged 12.0 points per game as a senior, while leading the team with 9.4 rebounds per game. Butler played on teams which produced the best four-year record in school history (91–24), reaching the NAIA tournament all four years which were also the first four national tournaments in program history. He helped the Cliff to one Sweet 16 and one Elite 8. He was inducted into the Briar Cliff Athletic Hall of Fame in 2016.

==Puerto Rico==
In 1979, Genaro Marchand, then president of the BSN, attended the Pan American Games, held in San Juan. The Puerto Rican basketball leader was so impressed by Butler and Frazer&#x27;s playing that he decided to carry out a special draft in 1980, and Butler was chosen by the Morovis Titans, while Frazer went to the Polluelos of Aibonito.

Butler, alongside teammates Wesley Correa and Mario Sanchez, brought instant respectability to the Titans. During that era, games were shown on Puerto Rico&#x27;s national television almost daily (on weekends, twice a day) by WAPA-TV, helping Butler, Frazer, Mario Morales, Georgie Torres, Jerome Mincy and a number of other BSN players to become household names there. Despite being active in the BSN, Butler continued representing Panama at different international tournaments, but he was not able to participate at any Olympic Games; Panama never qualified for them during Butler&#x27;s period with their national team.

In 1983, the Titans almost won the BSN&#x27;s title, losing to Morales, Fico Lopez and the Guaynabo Mets during a seven-game semi-final series. The Titans repeated their regular season success from 1984 to 1986, only to fall short in the playoffs. But at the 1987 BSN finals, Butler and the Titans finally conquered the title, the franchise&#x27;s first and so far, only, title, by beating the defending champions, Frazer and the Polluelos, by a score of 100–92 in game seven of the championship series. Correa, who was considered by many Puerto Ricans to be the best player on the Titans of that era, said &quot;Me and the two Marios (Butler and Sanchez) have been working for so long that we deserved this title since a long time ago!&quot;. By then, Butler had been nicknamed by famous broadcaster Manolo Rivera Morales as &quot;The Panamanian Express&quot; and &quot;The King of the Jungle&quot;.

After many other seasons with the Titans, Butler joined the Santurce Crabbers, where he played alongside José Ortiz and Carlos Arroyo, among others. Butler added three more championships to his resume when the Crabbers, who had begun a four championships in a row run in 1997, won the 1998, 1999 and 2000 titles.

After playing with the Crabbers, Butler joined the Carolina Giants, where he played until 2002. Then, he signed with the Titans again. In 2003, Butler broke the record for most games played in the BSN&#x27;s history, and becoming half of the first father and son duo in Puerto Rico to play for the same team at the same time in the BSN, alongside Mario Jr.

Butler scored more than 12,000 points at the BSN, making him a member of the exclusive group of players to have scored 5,000 or more points in that league (as the league usually has a schedule of only 30 to 33 games per year, anyone who reaches 5,000 or more points there is generally considered as an all-time great by Puerto Ricans), and also joining the even more exclusive group of players with 10,000 or more points scored. He averaged 17 points per game over 23 years. He also collected more than 8,000 rebounds, for an average of almost 12 rebounds caught per game. Butler was the BSN&#x27;s MVP in 1988, and the league&#x27;s defensive player of the year in 1984, 1985, 1987, 1988, 1991, 1993 and 1994.

Mario Butler returned to basketball, lured by Yamil Chade, in time to win his fifth BSN basketball championship, this time with the Arecibo Captains during 2005.

==International career==
Mario Butler also saw action in professional leagues of other countries besides Panama and Puerto Rico. He played as a professional in Brazil, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Italy, Mexico, Spain, the United States (though not in the NBA) and Venezuela.

One incident that Butler publicly admitted he probably will never forget happened while he was a player for the Aguascalientes team in Mexico: after the game&#x27;s referees made a call that disgusted local fans, many fans jumped onto the court to fight Butler and his teammates. Others began tossing bottles and other items from the fan stands. Butler and his coach, fellow Puerto Rican Julio Toro, had to push some fans away in order to make it out of the arena, and they were formally accused by some fans of hitting them, but the Mexican police never charged them.

==National team career==
Butler saw action for the Panama national team in other important tournaments apart from the Pan American games. These included the Central American and Caribbean Games, the Pre-Olympics and others. It was because of this international exposure that he, at 6 feet and 8 inches (80 inches) tall, became known by many basketball fans as one of the most dominant centers in the Spanish-speaking countries during his era as a basketball player.

<text>Zarqa () is the capital of Zarqa Governorate in Jordan. Its name means &quot;the blue (city)&quot;. It had a population of 635,160 inhabitants in 2015, and is the second most populous city in Jordan after Amman.

==History==

Although the area has been inhabited since the first century AD, the city of Zarqa was only established in 1902, by Chechen immigrants who were displaced due to the wars between the Ottoman and Russian Empires. They settled along the Zarqa River. At that time a station on the Hejaz Railway was built in the new settlement. The railway station turned Zarqa into an important hub. On 10 April 1905, the Ottoman governor issued a decree that allowed the Chechen immigrants to own the land they had settled on. The population then quickly grew in size. On 18 November 1928, the new Jordanian government issued a decree to establish the first municipal council for Zarqa.

After the Transjordan Frontier Force was formed in 1926, military bases were constructed in the city by the British Army, and the city later became known as the &quot;military city&quot;. The headquarters of Jordan&#x27;s Arab Legion were also located in Zarqa.

The oldest Palestinian refugee camp in Jordan, known as Zarqa Camp, is located near the city. It was set up by the International Committee of the Red Cross in 1949, after the Nakba and the subsequent exodus of Palestinian refugees from the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Although the camp initially consisted of tents, UNRWA eventually replaced these tents with concrete shelters. More refugees came to Zarqa after the 1990–91 Gulf War, when the Kuwaiti government expelled a quarter-million Palestinians, whom it suspected of supporting Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Iraq in that war. More than half of those expelled went to Zarqa or the nearby city of Russeifa. 

During the Black September conflict in 1970, Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine members hijacked five airplanes, and forced three to land at Dawson&#x27;s Field, an airstrip in the desert near Zarqa.

Zarqa is regarded today as a &quot;marginalized&quot; and &quot;conservative&quot; city, with a large Palestinian population. It is a stronghold of political Islamism, and is home to many supporters of the opposition Islamic Action Front party, which is the political wing of the Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan. The city was home to jihadist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the first leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq. About one-third of Jordanians who left to fight in the Syrian Civil War, mainly for Islamist groups, are believed to have come from Zarqa - more than from any other area in the country.

==Geography==
Zarqa is located in the Zarqa River basin in northeast Jordan. The city is situated northeast of Amman, and its area is 60 square kilometers.

==Climate==
Zarqa has a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;BSk&quot;). The average annual temperature is , and around of precipitation falls annually, mostly in winter months. Zarqa&#x27;s elevation is 619 meters above sea level, and the city occasionally receives snowfall in winter.

==Demographics==

With 700,000 people as of 2010, Zarqa has the third-largest metropolitan population in Jordan after Amman and Irbid. Zarqa city proper is the second-most populous in Jordan after Amman, with a population of about 635,000.

==Districts of Greater Zarqa Municipality==
The city of Zarqa is divided into five districts that have a combined area of about , and another two districts within the radius of influence of the city.

==Economy and infrastructure==

===Transportation===

From 1908-20, the Hejaz Railway connected Zarqa to Amman, to the south; and to Syria, to the north.

Zarqa lies on the international highway that connects Saudi Arabia with Syria, and the international Amman-Baghdad highway also passes through the city.

===Industry===
Zarqa is Jordan&#x27;s industrial centre. It is home to over 50% of Jordanian factories. The growth of industry in the city is the result of low real estate costs and proximity to the capital Amman.

Several facilities that are vital to Jordan&#x27;s economy are based in Zarqa, such as Jordan&#x27;s only oil refinery plant. According to the Zarqa Chamber of Commerce, 10% of Jordan&#x27;s total exports in 2011 came from Zarqa Governorate, amounting to more than US$512 million. Leather and garment products constituted about 52% of Zarqa&#x27;a exports, followed by chemical, agricultural and pharmaceutical products.

In September 2020, massive explosions occurred at an army munitions depot for mortars near Zarqa, caused by a short circuit.

==Education==
There are three universities in Zarqa, the largest of which is Hashemite University. The other two are Al-Balqa` Applied University and Zarqa University. Other community colleges and research centres are based in Zarqa such as the Al-Zarqa Educational &amp; Investment. The city is also home to many secondary schools (or high schools), most notably the Zarqa Secondary School for Boys, which is considered one of the oldest high schools in Jordan.

<doc id="1175189" wikidata="Q256524" url="?curid=1175189" title="Munich S-Bahn">
<text>The Munich S-Bahn () is an electric rail transit system in Munich, Germany. &quot;S-Bahn&quot; is the German abbreviation for &quot;Stadtschnellbahn&quot; (literally, &quot;urban rapid rail&quot;), and the Munich S-Bahn exhibits characteristics of both rapid transit and commuter rail systems.

The Munich S-Bahn network is operated by S-Bahn München, a subsidiary of DB Regio Bayern, which is itself a subsidiary of the German national railway company, Deutsche Bahn. It is integrated into the Munich Transport and Tariff Association (&quot;Münchner Verkehrs- und Tarifverbund&quot;, MVV) and interconnected throughout the city with the locally owned Munich U-Bahn. Today, the S-Bahn covers most of the populated area of the Munich metropolitan area of about 3 million inhabitants. In terms of system length, the Munich S-Bahn is the fourth-largest in Germany, behind the Rhine-Neckar S-Bahn, Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn and the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland.

The Munich S-Bahn was established on 28 May 1972. It was intended as part of the scheme to provide an adequate transport system during the 1972 Summer Olympics held in Munich by connecting the pre-existing suburban rail services in the west and east of the city via a new tunnel section from Hauptbahnhof to Ostbahnhof.

==Lines==

===System===

The system has seven branches in the west, which were originally numbered from north to south from the S 1 (to Freising) to the S 7 (Wolfratshausen). These are coupled with the five eastern branches. Operational requirements have changed several times, particularly due to line extensions, resulting in random numbering in the east. Two lines end at Munich East station (&quot;Ostbahnhof&quot;), these are currently S 1 and S 6. The first change was made in June 1991 when the branch to Ebersberg changed from S 4 to S 5 as a requirement to shorten the travel time to and from Herrsching. The line to Wolfratshausen was first called the S 10, but when it was connected to run over the trunk line it was changed to the S 7.

The S-Bahn branch in the east via Ismaning to the airport was designated as the S 8. Later this was combined with the original line S 3, which shared part of the route of the S 8, and the new route is called the S 8. This eliminated route S 3. The old route S 5 was later largely replaced by the current S 3, so there was no line S 5 until December 2024.

In addition, there is line S 20, which runs from Pasing to Höllriegelskreuth. These two lines do not run through the trunk line tunnel. The numbers beginning with 2 comes from the time of the introduction of these lines, as the line to Holzkirchen via Deisenhofen still had the number S 2 (instead of the current S 3). These lines cross the Isar via Großhesselohe Bridge.

In the Deutsche Bahn time table, the S-Bahn lines are numbered from 999.1 to 999.8 and 999.20; line A is numbered as 999.30.

===Frequency===

The basic interval of the Munich S-Bahn is one train every 20 minutes. On parts of some branches during peak hours there is a 10-minute frequency produced by added trains. A special case is the line to Erding, where on weekdays a mix of express trains from Erding and normal S-Bahn trains from Markt Schwaben runs in the morning peaks, producing a 10-minute frequency west of Munich East station. There are also occasional additional trains on the western section of the S4 and on the S1 between Freising and Munich during the peak hour, which do not continue past the Hauptbahnhof (not run through the trunk line tunnel). On some branches, one of three trains does not run to the terminus station at off-peak times, so that on these outer sections trains run at 20 or 40 minutes alternatively. The S8 is 24/7 (only to airport direction).
(*) Terminus of extra services in peak. Up to here services in the peak run at 10-minute intervals.

(+) Occasional additional services to create 10 minute frequency.

===Routes===
The S-Bahn partly operates on its own routes (one or two tracks), parts of it are double-track lines where S-Bahn operations are mixed with other traffic (passengers and freight), and in some cases more than two tracks are available. In the latter case one-or two tracks are set aside for the S-Bahn operations only and the two other tracks are used for the remaining traffic.

In the following table, the route length is shown from Munich Hauptbahnhof or from Ostbahnhof (Munich East station) because it reflects the chainage officially applied to the lines. An exception is S27 where the chainage starts at Pasing.
=== Former Lines / Station Renamings ===

Here are some of the former train lines. Some of the stations are also renamed as well.

* /: Until the tunnel section on the Donnersbergerbrücke was opened on 31 May 1981, instead today&#x27;s S7 and S10 to Hauptbahnhof (Holzkirchner wing station) without stopping at Donnersberger and Hackerbrücke. Instead of the later, Starnberg wing station to Munich Hauptbahnhof, the S27 and S22 also ended in Holzkirchner Bahnhof. were used, locomotive-hauled trains.
* From Pasing via Mittersendling to Deisenhofen was originally part of the push-pull operation under the name S12. Thereafter, these trains ran without S-Bahn-designation. Later, the line was simplified and became the S20 again an S-Bahn-designation.
* /: The S5 and S11 ran as special lines during the 1972 Olympic Games via Johanneskirchen (S5) or Moosach (S11) to the now-defunct Olympiastadion. 
* , from 1985 , went as a special line at major events in the Olympic Park until 1988, running from Moosach to Olympiastadion.
* : In 1975, the operation of the S-Bahn to Freiham was abandoned.
* : In 1981, the operation to Großhesselohe was abandoned.
* /: The commissioning of the S-Bahn station Heimeranplatz took place on 26 September 1982.
* : In 1992, Unterpfaffenhofen-Germering station was renamed as Germering-Unterpfaffenhofen
* /: Until the construction of the airport line, S8 (1991) made use of the S3 the route Nannhofen-Ismaning. After the construction of the route to the airport the S8 ended in the West in Pasing, the S3 went to the east to the Ostbahnhof. Later, the two lines were merged in order to relieve the original route in 1994. Because of the importance of the airport line, the line S3 ceased to operate and only S8 operated. There was no &#x27;S3&#x27; from 1994 to 2004 and now there is no S5 for this reason.
* : From December 2004 to December 2005 witnessed the temporary re-introduction of the S3: it was a peak hour service between Maisach and Zorneding and realized the promised 10-minute frequency on this section. (Red / Black). After one year, this service became obsolete because the West branches of the S4 and S8 were exchanged.
* : On 28 May 2000, the terminus points, Esterhofen and Walpertshofen have been renamed to Vierkirchen-Esterhofen and Hebertshausen.
* : With the timetable change on 12 December 2004, Mühlthal station was closed, since then the trains of S6 have run the 7.7 km between Gauting and Starnberg Nord without intermediate stops.
* : With the timetable change in late 2005, the terminus of the line was S4 (previously: S8) at Nannhofen was renamed Mammendorf.
* : the timetable change in December 2009 accounted for the designation S5. The route to Herrsching has since been operated by the S8 route to Holzkirchen of the S3.
* : the timetable change in December 2009, the S3 was reintroduced. It now runs between Mammendorf and Holzkirchen.
* : The S27 operated from Starnberg wing station at the main station along the route of the S7 to Solln, crossed the Isar on the Großhesseloher bridge and ran on to Deisenhofen. On 15 December 2013, the S27 was abandoned and replaced by regional trains of the Meridian.
* : From 1995 to 2014, the line A was the only non-electrified Munich S-Bahn line, which ran on the Dachau–Altomünster railway. It was made into a branch of the S2 on 14 December 2014, and was finally electrified.

The connection between the Hauptbahnhof and the Ostbahnhof, called the &quot;Südring&quot;, runs west from Hauptbahnhof before turning south and curving toward Ostbahnhof without any stops in between. The trains travelling on this route (DB50) are included in the MVV tariff scheme and offer a view of the city while the travel time is slightly longer than the Stammstrecke tunnel.

Additional regional lines make calls at stations also served by the S-Bahn but provide an effective express functionality for MVV passengers. The examples include:

* Garmisch-Partenkirchen to Munich, calling at Tutzing (S6) and Pasing (Stammstrecke)
* Augsburg to Munich, calling at Mammendorf (irregularly) and Pasing (Stammstrecke)
* Regensburg to Munich, calling at Moosburg, and Freising (S1)
* Rosenheim to Munich, calling at Grafing Bf (S4) and Ostbahnhof (Stammstrecke)
* Various southern lines of the BRB, calling at Holzkirchen (S3) and several S7 stations (Solln (weekends), Siemenswerke (weekdays), Harras, Donnersbergerbrücke, Main Station)
* Former S27 route served by the BRB from Deisenhofen to Main Station via Solln and then along the S7, stops at all stations apart from Hackerbrücke
* Rosenheim to Holzkirchen calling at Kreuzstraße (S7) and Holzkirchen (S3), sometimes continuing to Munich
* Lindau to Munich, calling at Geltendorf (S4) and Pasing (Stammstrecke)
* Nürnberg to Munich, calling at Petershausen (S2) and Dachau Bf (S2)

Expansion plans announced by the MVV on 7 April 2017 include express S-Bahn lines with limited stops operating through the second tunnel now under construction.

==History==
An underground railway line for Munich was first proposed in 1928 in a report on the &quot;relocation of traffic centres&quot;. An underground route would allow &quot;direct long distance traffic to and through the city centre&quot;.

On 22 May 1938, the first tunnel, which was part of the north–south route, was started in the Lindwurmstraße, between the present-day underground stations Sendlinger Tor and Goetheplatz. In the speech of Julius Dorpmüller, the general director of Deutsche Reichsbahn, the project was called &quot;S-Bahn&quot; for the first time. Due to World War II the construction and plans for the Munich S-Bahn were set aside.

===Plans, with the Munich Olympic bid===

In 1965, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Free State of Bavaria, the state capital of Munich and the Deutsche Bundesbahn signed a contract on the construction of the Munich S-Bahn. The further development was most influenced by a decision made in Rome on 26 April 1966: the International Olympic Committee chose Munich over Detroit, Madrid and Montreal as the location for the 1972 Summer Olympics, resulting in a tight schedule of only six years to complete the Munich S-Bahn network.

Not only did the tunnel through the city centre have to be built, the full railway infrastructure had to be expanded. The network of suburban lines had to be changed over and modernized. A large number of stations had to be upgraded; platforms were extended to a length of to allow for three-unit trains, and the platform height was raised to . However, the floor height of trains used then and now is at approximately , which makes boarding difficult for people with wheelchairs or prams. Tunnel stations and platforms updated recently where no freight trains run do feature a height of , however.

On 25 February 1971 the topping-out ceremony could be celebrated in the core route tunnel. In May the first S-Bahn train of the ET 420 series was put into service on the route between Pasing and Gauting. On 1 September 1971 a regular advance service was started on that route.

===Opening===
On 28 May 1972, the Munich S-Bahn network was finally put into service with of tracks and 101 trains of the ET 420 series. Town names in the nearby Munich such as Dachau, Tutzing, Erding and Pasing came into the picture. It was the first time a S-Bahn network that size was put into service on a single date. The route S10 to Wolfratshausen (today S7) was operated with conventional push-pull trains from the southern wing of Munich Central Station. It was electrified later and connected to the core route after the construction of a tunnel crossing the large number of mainline rail tracks leading to Munich Central Station.

Three months later the German President Gustav Heinemann opened the 1972 Summer Olympics. During the Games there were two additional S-Bahn lines servicing the now-defunct station Olympiastadion (Olympic Stadium). The new S-Bahn system stood the test and transported 3.18 million passengers in 7,138 runs to and from the sports sites in only 17 days. The first stage was limited by the Olympic Games in 1972. Because of the enormous time pressure, not all lines could be equipped for a 10 or 20 minute cycle.

The second stage was necessary mainly because of the increasing traffic volume. In 1973 and 1974, the Deutsche Bundesbahn established the following construction measures: Own S-Bahn tracks were to be built on the railway tracks from Lochhausen to Nannhofen (now Mammendorf) and from Munich to East Grafing, So as not to hinder long-distance and regional transport on the respective routes. As new settlements developed in Esting, in the south Neuperlachs and in Unterschleißheim new settlements, the new breakpoints Unterschleißheim in the year 1977, Neuperlach Süd in 1977 and Esting in 1980. In addition, The railway line to Herrsching was to be extended two-way between Freiham and Weßling.

Since then the Munich S-Bahn network has been expanded multiple times. On 28 May 1980, it was extended to Mammendorf. On 3 November 1979, it was extended to Ebersberg (S4). S5 was extended to Herrsching in 1984.

In 1992, the route between Ismaning and the newly opened Airport Munich II was put into service as S8, followed by S1 extension on 29 November 1998.

===Further development===
With the timetable change on 12 December 2004, the ten-minute headway on the S 4 from Maisach to Zorneding and on the S 5 from Germering-Unterpfaffenhofen to Deisenhofen was introduced during rush hour, doubling the number of trains offered from three to six per hour. Since 11 December 2005 this is also offered on the western section of the S 2 to Dachau. This means there are now 30 trains per hour and direction on the trunk line during rush hour.

In August 1998, the federal government, the Free State of Bavaria and Deutsche Bahn decided on a 266-million-euro package to introduce this ten-minute headway on several lines. The main point was the modernization of the control and safety technology between Pasing and Ostbahnhof, including the installation of Linienzugbeeinflussung. Between 2001 and 2005, construction work on the external lines continued as part of this program. In addition, new S-Bahn stations were opened on 10 June 2001 in Starnberg Nord (S6 West) and on 11 December 2005 in Untermenzing (S2 West). Some already existing stations on the outer routes could also be made wheelchair-accessible in the financial framework of the project. On 21 November 2005, the section of the airport line S 8 within Unterföhring was moved underground, this was at the request of the town. On 13 December 2009, a new stop &quot;Hirschgarten&quot; was inaugurated on the S-Bahn trunk line between Laim and Donnersbergerbrücke. On 14 September 2013 a new Freiham stop was opened on line S8 close to the one that had been closed decades before, which is to connect the new residential area Freiham. It is located one kilometer east of the 1975 decommissioned station Freiham. Construction had begun on 12 June 2012.

On 15 December 2013, the S 27 from the main station to Deisenhofen was discontinued, the trips are taken by the half-hourly Meridian trains of the Bayerische Regiobahn, which are extended in the rush hour via Holzkirchen and the Mangfalltalbahn to Rosenheim. In addition, the terminus of the S 20 line was relocated from Deisenhofen to Höllriegelskreuth on the Isartalbahn. The railway line Munich-Holzkirchen is no longer served by S-Bahn trains between Solln and Deisenhofen.

In 2014, the Dachau–Altomünster railway line, which had previously been used by line A, was electrified, which had been the only unelectrified stretch of the S-Bahn. Furthermore, a two-track meeting section between Bachern and Schwabhausen and an additional crossing station in Erdweg were built. The planning approval process was completed in January 2013. From 28 April to 13 December 2014, the line A line between Dachau and Altomünster was suspended for electrification, and Class 428 railcars were replaced by buses. After completion of the conversion work, electrical operation began on 14 December 2014. During rush hour, trains now operate on a 30-minute headway. Otherwise, service remains hourly. The route is operated as a wing section of the S 2. The last cost estimate was 47 million euros. Construction was originally scheduled to start in 2012 and completion was scheduled for 2013.

Further dates:
* 15 June 1966 – Construction of the core route tunnel begins in Arnulfstraße.
* 28 April 1972 – first test runs on the tunnel route (Hauptbahnhof-Marienplatz-Ostbahnhof).
* 28 May 1972 – regular service with 360 route km begins.

== Rolling stock ==
===Current rolling stock===
====Class 420====

Since the opening of the S-Bahn network from 1972 to 2004, vehicles of the DB Class 420 have been used in the Munich S-Bahn network. In 1972, however, only 101 of the ordered 120 trains were available, so that on some routes until 1975 had to be driven with turning trains. The first 120 vehicles came from the first series of this series. In the following years, due to the higher demand for vehicles, about 30 vehicles of the second construction series came to Munich. The number of trains of the second series of construction varied, as they were also exchanged with vehicles from other cities. From 1979 to 1982 also came vehicles of the fifth and sixth series to Munich, these were used after 1982 but again in other suburban rail networks. From 1992, some vehicles of the seventh and from 1996 the eighth series were added, so that the vehicle stock in Munich in 1996 included 209 vehicles. Since the delivery of Class 423 vehicles, the Class 420 trains have been delivered to other cities, sold or scrapped. For the time being, the last regular passenger service in the Munich S-Bahn network drove a train of this series, the so-called &quot;Olympia motor coach&quot;, on 5 December 2004 on an amplifier circulation line S 8 and was since then only in the museum service at regular special trips to be found.

Due to the electrification of the A line and the resulting vehicle shortage since December 2014 again series 420 trainsets are used. These are 15 units taken over from the S-Bahn Stuttgart, but due to the lack of regular train traffic, they can not run on the main line during rush hours. They therefore take over exclusively the amplifier services on the S 2 between Dachau and Altomünster as well as amplifier rides on the west branch of the S 4 line and the S 20 line. Currently planning the S-Bahn Munich and the Bavarian railway company, 20 to 30 other units from Stuttgart to Munich to match the rising numbers of passengers. These are to be equipped with the existing units with the Linienzugbeeinflussung in order to be able to drive in the trunk tunnel.

Since the route of the line A from Dachau to Altomünster was not electrified until April 2014, DB Class 628 was primarily used. These were located in the railway depot of the Südostbayernbahn in Mühldorf am Inn. The vehicles were procured again in 1998 for the track, previously were used on the line A n-car push-pull trains with diesel locomotives. However, the entrances to the trains were not barrier-free because of steps. Following the electrification of the line, it was replaced by a branch line of S2, and Class 420s were replaced as well in June 2017.

====Class 423====
From the autumn of 2000, the class 420 trainsets, some of them over thirty years old, were replaced massively by new vehicles of the class 423. The new vehicle emissions were enforced line by line, as the trains could not be coupled with each other. First, the S 7 line was served by the new locomotives. By 2003, 211 locomotives were delivered. In 2004, another 23 units were procured. In 2005, four more trains were delivered, so today there are 238 traction vehicles.

====Class 424====
After the continuous of trains kept going, the company announced that some trains of the class 424 were to be transferred from Hanover to Munich and put them into S-Bahn service after a modernisation.

These trains would run services on the S20, with some services extending up to Geltendorf.

In December 2023, the first refurbished 424 units were placed into service on the S2 shuttle service between Dachau Bahnhof and Altomünster, and later entered service on the S20 as well. Due to the height of the train floor being 20 centimeters lower than the height of the platform, these trains are limited to the S2 Altomünster shuttle, the S20, and S4 amplifier services between Geltendorf and Munich Hauptbahnhof (platforms 27-36).

===Future trains===

====New train====
In October 2020, DB Regio started a competition for over 110 to 200 new trains for the S-Bahn München. These trains should be roughly 200m long.

It was planned to take the trains into service from 2026 onwards, however, according to various media sources, the new trains would be taken in service near the end of the 2020s. The first design concepts of the train were revealed on 14 February 2023 by the Bavarian ministry of traffic. 

On 2 August 2023, it was revealed that Deutsche Bahn had awarded Siemens Mobility a contract worth more than €2 billion, for 90 13-car new S-Bahn trains, with options for further trains. With a capacity of 1841 passengers, lighting on the train will change according to the time of day, and seating will be organised in 3 and 4 seat configurations. A more powerful HVAC system, new passenger information displays showing occupancy, station stops and nearest exits on the platform, and free Wi-Fi will be fitted. External LED strips will display the colour of the S-Bahn line. 5 cars will have &#x27;multi-purpose&#x27; areas with space for luggage, bicycles and strollers. The trains are fitted with ETCS, ATO and a train integrity monitoring system. The trains will enter service by the end of 2028.

The European Investment Bank and HypoVereinsbank, a subsidiary of UniCredit, provided credit of more than €2 billion for the order, with LHI Leasing selected as the lessor.

===Others===
====BR 425====
In October 2019, some modernised trains of the Class 425 were brought to Munich to supplement a few services of the S20. This was to alleviate the chequered availability of rolling stock. After the timetable change in December 2019, those Class 425 train sets were returned to S-Bahn Rhein-Main.

====n-Wagen====
In 1972, during the Olympic Games, a consist made up of 15 Silberlinge cars and a DB Class 140 locomotive at the middle was used to haul trains on the S25 between the Ostbahnhof and the Olympiastadion stations.

====Tests with double decker-trains====
In 1989, the &quot;&quot; (DDM-1) double decker carriages used by Nederlandse Spoorwegen in the Netherlands were briefly trialled on the then S4 between Geltendorf and Ebersberg. Patrons were invited to fill out a questionnaire while on board describing their experiences while boarding and riding the train. The concept was to increase passenger capacity at the same time as accommodating bicycles, prams, and wheelchairs with efficiency. The trains were pulled by a DB Class 120 locomotive at each end of the train.

==Plans and further expansions==
===The Second S-Bahn Tunnel (Zweite Stammstrecke)===

Nearly all lines use the core route through the city centre in the underground, creating a bottle-neck responsible for long and increasingly frequent delays from even the smallest disruptions. The disadvantage of current core route is the inability of trains to reroute themselves onto different tracks in an event of disruption.

After years of discussions and studies into different route propositions, a second tunnel through the city centre has been already approved with the funding of €3.85 billion and the completion date of 2028–2032. On 5 April 2017, the ground-breaking ceremony took place to commence the construction.

The second tunnel will be in length and run in parallel with the current tunnel in the south on the western portion of Hauptbahnhof and in the north on the eastern portion. It will have three underground stations (Hauptbahnhof, Marienhof, Ostbahnhof) and two surface stations (Laim and Leuchtenbergring). Marienhof, which will be built to the north of Munich Marienplatz station, will be the only all-new station on the line; other stations will be expanded to accommodate the new tunnel. With focus on express service and shorter travel time, the second tunnel will bypass six current stations between Laim and Ostbahnhof.

Most of express S-Bahn with limited stops will use the second tunnel: the proposed express S-Bahn routes are S18X (Herrsching-Leuchtenbergring), S21X (Landshut-Leuchtenbergring), S23X (Mering-Flughafen München), and S24X (Buchloe-Leuchtenbergring). Two of current S-Bahn routes will be transferred to the second tunnel upon the completion: S1 (Flughafen München/Freising-Ebersberg) and S6 (Tutzing-Leuchtenbergring).

====Optimisation (Optimierung)====
The initial design called for second S-Bahn station underneath Orleansplatz at Ostbahnhof with long pedestrian tunnels connecting to the aboveground station serving regional and long-distance trains and current S-Bahn. This design received many negative criticism from the public, especially the residents in Haidhausen neighbourhood quarter. The residents have grave concern about tunnelling and earth extraction impacting their housing and disrupting their daily lives. The new EU directives call for more escape tunnels and rescue access points to be incorporated in the design. The forthcoming construction of new U9 subway station at the Hauptbahnhof requires the further tweaking of master build plans (reconstruction of main building and second S-Bahn station).

On 3 July 2019, Deutsche Bahn announced the new &quot;2. Stammstrecke — Die Optimierungen&quot; (Second Trunk Line Optimisation). The optimisation project called for second S-Bahn station at Ostbahnhof to be moved from Orleansplatz to the southeastern side of Ostbahnhof platforms along the street, Friedenstraße. The entire second S-Bahn station will be underground and connected to the current S-Bahn platforms via staircases, escalators, and lifts. The advantages of new location are its close proximity to the entertainment quarter in the southeast, higher capacity flow with more direct access to the aboveground platforms, better connection to Berg am Laim S-Bahn station, and platforms closer to the ground (16 metres deep instead of 40). The relocation necessitated realignment and lengthening of S-Bahn tunnels between Marienhof and Ostbahnhof.

The new EU directive requires the third tunnel for escape and rescue to be constructed between two tunnels and access points to the aboveground be added at every 600 metres. The benefit of new design allows quicker passenger evacuation from the tunnels, easier access for the rescue personnel, and simpler access for maintenance crew.

The State of Bavaria and Munich city council wants the first U9 station to be built at the Hauptbahnhof at the same time as reconstruction of Hauptbahnhof main building and construction of second S-Bahn trunk line. The new changes relocate U9 platforms from the west end of regional and long distance platforms to the middle of main Hauptbahnhof building below the ground. The relocation places U9 station directly above the second trunk line station in a cross arrangement. This improves the passenger flow between two current U-Bahn lines (U4/U5 and U1/U2/U7/U8), one current S-Bahn trunk line, and aboveground level.

===S-Bahn-Nordring===

An alternative route in the north has been proposed for many years. This route would use part of Münchner Nordring (Munich North Ring) currently used by the freight trains and as railway bypass. The plan would call for eight new S-Bahn stations and two conjunctions (one at Pasing and other one at Berg am Laim) to be built, totalling fourteen stations (six have been built earlier for use in the existing system: Pasing, Moosach, Johanneskirchen, Englschalking, Daglfing, and Trudering).

The advantage of using the Nordring is numerous as compared to Südring (South Ring – proposed as an assumedly weak alternative to second trunk line):
* Many rail infrastructures have been already built in the past, connecting to two current S-Bahn routes (S1 at Moosach and S8 between Johanneskirchen and Unterföhring);
* This will serve many of industrial centres in the north, namely BMW manufacturing plants, FIZ research centre, and media centres in Unterföhring;
* S-Bahn serving Nordring can also travel to the Munich Airport via Johanneskirchen station and back without transferring;
* Five stations would have U-Bahn connections while additional two would probably be connected if U1 (Lassallestraße) and U4 (Englschalking) extensions are built;
* Three stations would have tram connections (Pasing, Moosach, and Unterföhring Süd);
* The new S-Bahn stations and additional technical modifications can be built on the existing route without incurring the enormous cost as the second trunk route would.

The discussion of S-Bahn-Nordring is ongoing with no tentative date of construction and completion as well as cost estimate.

===Circular Railway (Ringbahn)===
Michael Piazolo, a Bavarian state parliament representative, commissioned a study for a potential Münchner Ringbahn. The proposal of building the circular railway similar to Berlin Ringbahn has recently gained more traction with the city government and the state parliament. The circular railway would use the Munich North Ring, the S8 line between Johanneskirchen and Ostbahnhof, the Südring between Ostbahnhof and Heimeranplatz, and a new line to be built between Heimeranplatz and Olympiakreuz. The close proximity of Nymphenburg Palace and the west–east lines at Donnersbergerbrücke station would require the construction of tunnels between south of Heimeranplatz and Olympiakreuz.

Most of the Ringbahn would use the existing railway lines with seven S-Bahn stations (Heimeranplatz, Donnersbergerbrücke, Johanneskirchen, Englschalking, Daglfing, Leuchtenbergring, and Ostbahnhof) currently in use. Five new surface stations (BMW Forschungszentrum, Ingolstädter Straße, Aumeister, Kolumbusplatz, and Poccisstraße) and three new underground stations (Nymphenburg, Neuhausen, and Olympiakreuz) would have to be built.

One additional advantage of this Ringbahn concept is an airport express train service from Hauptbahnhof via Olympiakreuz, following the proposed tracking for the finally abandoned Munich Airport Transrapid. That could potentially shorten the travel time from the Hauptbahnhof on the west side, bypassing the current S2 with numerous stops along the line.

===Southern Ring===
The alternative to the Circular Ring is the Southern Ring between Ostbahnhof and Heimeranplatz, with stations at Heimeranplatz, Poccistraße and Kolumbusplatz, which is the express variant.

===Northern Tunnels along the Airport===
In 2009, a Nordtunnel was proposed by Vieregg-Rössler as a further extension, which connects the main railway station with the Kunstareal (with the three Pinakotheken) Nordring, football stadium, Garching, airport). In the inner city area, the planned route is roughly equal to that of the planned U9. In addition to the S-Bahn, the route would also include regional and long-distance transport, in this way the central orientation of the Munich local transport system should be replaced by the city center. The Nordtunnel was not followed, among other things due to higher costs with at the same time lower profitability.

===S-Bahn Vision 2050===
On 31 March 2017, MVV announced the Vision 2050 expansion proposal. The vision for the year 2050 includes double-decked wagons, 24-hour operations, new stations, and extensions further beyond the city limit.

The possible extensions are:
* S1 North from Freising to Landshut
* S2 North from Altomünster to Aichach and from Petershausen to Pfaffenhofen
* S2 East from Markt Schwaben to Dorfen
* S3 West from Mammendorf to Augsburg
* S3 South from Holzkirchen to Schaftlach which splits to Lenggries and Tegernsee
* S4/S6 East from Ebersberg to Wasserburg and from Grafing Bahnhof to Rosenheim
* S4/S6 West from Geltendorf to Kaufering and beyond
* S7 South to Geretsried (Geretsried Süd railway station) via Gelting and Geretsried Mitte. The environmental impact study is planned for 2017. Work started in 2022, and the projected completion date is 2027 at the earliest.
* New S-Bahn line from Karlsfeld to Dasing

Rings and Spurs (Ringschlüsse und Spange):
* Neufahrner Kurve (Neufahrn Curve): this will facilitate the travel between Freising and Munich Airport without switching back at Neufahrn. The construction was completed, and the RE train service to Regensburg and Landshut was commenced on 9 December 2018.
* Erdinger Ringschluss (Erding Loop): this line will connect with S1 and S8 at Munich Airport and with S2 at Erding. If completed, it would make two loops with one larger and one smaller, stopping at Hauptbahnhof and Munich Airport. Due to the military base nearby, the tunnel is required. Still in discussion.
* Walpertskirchner Spange (Walpertskirchner Spur): this line extend the Erdinger Ringschluß from Erding to proposed S2 East extension, connecting somewhere between Walpertskirchner and Thann-Matzbach. Still in discussion.
* Verknüpfungskurve S7 - Rosenheim: Like Neufahrner Kurve, this spur makes travelling between the city centre in Munich and Rosenheim easier without switchback at Kreuzstraße.

Four-Track Expansions:
* Four-track extension of S8 line to the Munich Airport and moving the surface railway to the underground between Leuchtenbergring and Unterföhring. The extra tracks are for freight trains, which must pull aside often for S-Bahn. If the four-track extension is completed, the airport express train could use the freight tracks as to bypass the local service. Still in discussion.
* Four-track extension of S4-West between Buchenau and Pasing. The extension is due to the opening of Gotthard Tunnel in Switzerland. This will increase freight transports between northern and southern Europe going through central Europe. The first phase is from Pasing to Puchheim. For cost reasons, the extension would terminate at Eichenau for time being. In planning.

Other Projects:
* Possible relocation of the S2 East to the Munich International Trade Fair site. Now cancelled.
* New stations at Breitenau, Emmering, Weichselbaum, Menterschwaige, Schwaigerloh, Sendlinger Spange, Gelting, and Messestadt Nord.

<text>Nkosinathi Nhleko (born 24 July 1979, in Ermelo) is a retired South African soccer player who last played as a striker for Kaizer Chiefs and Retired at Antaliay Football Club (Turkey Football League)

Nhleko was a stocky built striker known for his pace and ability to hold up the ball and turn defenders not so much for his goal scoring exploits.

== Club career ==
Nhleko began his professional career with South African club Jomo Cosmos, for whom he played from 1998 to 2002.

In 2002, Nhleko moved to Brann of Norway; although he appeared in 20 games, including two UEFA Cup matches, Nhleko had trouble adjusting to the climate and environment at Brann, and during the summer of 2003, was loaned to Major League Soccer&#x27;s Dallas Burn for the rest of the season.

Nhleko performed well in 11 games with the Burn, showing strength and power possessed by few MLS forwards, registering two goals and four assists while teaming well with Eddie Johnson. The team bought Nhleko in the 2004 offseason for a nominal fee, and he played a larger role in the team&#x27;s 2004 offense. Appearing either as a substitute for Jason Kreis or a starter with Eddie Johnson, Nhleko played in 23 games for Dallas in 2004, 13 of them starts, while scoring six goals and two assists. He left the team after the season, coming back to the Cosmos.

He arrived for his second spell at Jomo Cosmos in January 2005 but his stay was short lived as he moved back to Europe, where he was signed by Roy Hodgson.

In July 2005, Nhleko returned to Norway to play for Viking. He helped Viking by scoring to beat AS Monaco and Slavia Prague in the 2005 Uefa cup.

In August 2006 he was sold to Swedish club Hammarby IF. In August 2007 he was loaned out to Sandefjord until November 2007. He returned to Jomo Cosmos.

His third stint at Jomo Cosmos proved to be fruitless. He failed to score a single league goal in a team who were struggling to find goals to fight off relegation. He did however score a cup goal in a 1–0 win over Golden Arrows in a Nedbank Cup Last 32 Round match.

After Jomo Cosmos relegation from the Premier Soccer League during the 2007/08 season, Nhleko signed for Thanda Royal Zulu on a Bosman free transfer.

== International career ==
Nhleko has made ten appearances scoring one goal for the South African national team, playing in the 2004 African Nations Cup.

<doc id="1175196" wikidata="Q1661172" url="?curid=1175196" title="Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare">
<text>The Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW) is an economic indicator intended to replace the gross domestic product (GDP), which is the main macroeconomic indicator of System of National Accounts (SNA).
Rather than simply adding together all expenditures like the GDP, consumer spending is balanced by such factors as income distribution and cost associated with pollution and other unsustainable costs. The calculation excludes defence expenditures and considers a wider range of harmful effects of economic growth. It is similar to the genuine progress indicator (GPI).

The Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW) is roughly defined by the following formula:

&quot;ISEW&quot; = &quot;personal consumption&quot;&lt;br&gt;+ &quot;public non-defensive expenditures&quot;&lt;br&gt;- &quot;private defensive expenditures&quot;&lt;br&gt;+ &quot;capital formation&quot;&lt;br&gt;+ &quot;services from domestic labour&quot;&lt;br&gt;- &quot;costs of environmental degradation&quot;&lt;br&gt;- &quot;depreciation of natural capital&quot;

==History==
GDP is misleading as an indicator or even as a proxy of the welfare of a nation, let alone as a measure of people&#x27;s well-being, although the makers of economic policy commonly think to the contrary. This problem already became apparent in practical economic policies in most industrialised countries in the early 1970s. The most famous examples of this development are the MEW index developed by William Nordhaus and James Tobin in their Measure of Economic Welfare (MEW) in 1972, the Japanese Net National Welfare (NNW) indicator in 1973, the Economic Aspects of Welfare index (EAW) index of Zolatas in 1981, the ISEW indicator of Daly and Cobb in 1989 and the UN&#x27;s human development index (HDI) in 1990. They are all based on neoclassical welfare economics and use as the starting point the System of National Accounts (SNA). The basic idea behind all these approaches is the inclusion of nonmarket commodities, positive and negative, to yield an aggregated macroindicator in monetary terms.

The EAW index, applied to the United States for the period from 1950 to 1977, showed that the economic aspects of social welfare are a diminishing function of economic growth in industrially mature, affluent societies. The percentage increases in social welfare over time are smaller than the corresponding increases in the GDP, and are diminishing. When the elasticity of the EAW/GDP ratio reaches zero, economic welfare will have attained its maximum value. Beyond that point any further increase in the GDP would lead to an absolute decline in economic welfare.

The ISEW was originally developed in 1989 by leading ecological economist and steady-state theorist Herman Daly and theologian John B. Cobb, but later they went on to add several other &quot;costs&quot; to the definition of ISEW. This later work resulted in yet another macroeconomic indicator Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI): see sustainability measurement. The GPI is an extension of ISEW that stresses genuine and real progress of the society and seeks especially to monitor welfare and the ecological sustainability of the economy. The ISEW and GPI summarise economic welfare by means of a single figure according to the same logic by which GDP summarises economic output into a single figure. Beside economic issues, social and environmental issues in monetary terms are included in the calculation.

==Trend of ISEW in the United States==

The calculation of the ISEW in the United States from 1950 to 1986 was done by Cobb and Daly in 1989. The results reveal that the increase in economic welfare of an average American has stabilised after the 1970s although the economy, measured by GDP, has continued to grow. According to Cobb and Daly&#x27;s calculations the external effects of production and the inequity of income distribution are the main reasons for this development in which an increase in production does not necessarily lead to an increase in welfare.

==Other countries and regions to calculate ISEW==

Besides the USA there have been at least seven other countries or regions which have compiled the ISEW, namely the UK (Jackson &amp; Marks 1994), Germany (Diefenbacher 1994), The Netherlands (Rosenberg &amp; Oegema 1995), Austria (Stockhammer et al. 1995), British Columbia (Gustavson &amp; Lonergan 1994), Sweden (Jackson &amp; Stymne 1996), Chile (Castaneda 1999), Finland (Hoffrén 2001), Poland (Gil &amp; Śleszyński 2003), Belgium (Bleys, 2008), Flanders (Bleys &amp; Van der Slycken, 2019) and China (Zhu et al., 2021).

==Progress of the Finnish ISEW ==

The calculation of the ISEW for Finland has been done by Dr. Jukka Hoffrén at Statistics Finland in 2001 . Today the time period covered is extended to years from 1945 to 2010. According to the results, sustainable economic welfare rose steadily in the 1970s and early 1980s, but has since declined and stabilised. One of the underlying reasons for this development was effective income distribution which apportioned evenly the welfare derived from increased production. In the mid-1980s income disparities started to grow again, flows of capital (investments) abroad increased and environmental hazards escalated, resulting in a decline in the weighted personal consumption.

Major contributors to Finnish ISEW in 2000 (FIM billion, rp)
Weighted personal consumption + 467.8

Household work + 82.8
Other positive contributions + 21.7
Long-term environmental damage - 228.0
Environmental deterioration - 192,5
 
ISEW + 151,8

<text>Hulusi Behçet (; ; ; 20 February 1889 – 8 March 1948) was a Turkish dermatologist and scientist. He described a disease of inflamed blood vessels in 1937, which is named after him as Behçet&#x27;s disease. His portrait was depicted on a former Turkish postcard stamp.

== Early life ==
Born to Turkish parents, as his father was an official in the Ottoman Empire, they emigrated to Damascus where he spent his early childhood after he lost his mother to an illness.

== Professional works ==
During World War I (1914–1918), he served at the military hospital in Edirne as a specialist in dermatology and venereal diseases and was assigned to the head of the hospital as an assistant. After the war, between 1918 and 1919, he first went to Budapest, Hungary and then to Berlin, Germany to improve his medical knowledge. He had the opportunity to meet some well-known colleagues there. After his return to Turkey, he went into private practice. In 1923, Behçet was appointed as the head physician at the Hasköy Venereal Diseases Hospital at Golden Horn in Istanbul. Shortly after, he moved to Guraba Hospital, which is now part of the School of Medicine Bezmialem University. While he lectured at the university, he continued his private practice as well.

== Scientific works ==
In 1933, Istanbul University was re-established out of the old-fashioned Dar-ul Fünun. During this period of reform, Behçet founded the department of dermatology and venereal diseases. His curiosity for research, writing, and discussion were his intellectual characteristics. Starting from the early years in his profession, his participation in national and international congresses with original articles was very apparent, publishing many articles at home and abroad. The famous German pathologist Philipp Schwartz once called him &quot;&quot;a scientist who was well known everywhere, but in his country&quot;, adding that &quot;you could never find him in Turkey because he was always abroad presenting his findings&quot;&quot;. He translated many articles into Turkish to help educate new generations and published original case reports in international reviews in order to make contact with such far countries as Korea.

He was interested in syphilis since 1922 and had published many international articles on its diagnosis, treatment, hereditary properties, serology, and social aspects. Leishmaniasis (Oriental sore) was another disease, which Behçet worked on, beginning in 1923. He wrote about it in many articles and succeeded in its treatment with diathermic. He first described &quot;the nail sign&quot; appearing by the removal of the crust of an oriental sore. A part of his published work was concerned with parasitosis. In 1923, he described the etiologic agents of &quot;gale cereal&quot; in Turkey. Behçet dealt with superficial and deep mycosis and their treatments. Due to his observations, he described the dermatitis of fig in 1933. In 1935, at the Dermatology Congress in Budapest, he was honored for his studies on mycosis. He was also in the publishing vanguard to improve Turkish medicine and he was responsible for the first dermato-venerology journal of Turkey called &quot;’’Turkish Archives of Dermatology and Syphilology’’&quot; in 1924. In 1939, he was elected as a correspondent member to the German scientific journals &quot;’’Dermatologische Wochenschrift’’&quot; and &quot;’’Medizinische Wochenschrift’’&quot;. The same year, he was promoted to ordinary professor. The most important work that Behçet brought to Turkish medicine was the monograph published in 1940 called &quot;’’Clinical and Practical Syphilis, Diagnosis and Related Dermatoses’’&quot;. Every page of this book contains an aspect of syphilis and the footnotes provide a wealth of detailed information about the differential diagnosis of other skin diseases. As a result, scientists had the chance to learn about syphilis and dermatology at the same time. This book, despite its outdated style, still retains its value and spirit in medicine as being the only example in its field. Behçet continued as the Head of the Department of Dermatology and Venereal Diseases until 1947.

== Behçet&#x27;s disease ==

His first observations on Behçet&#x27;s disease began with a patient he met between 1924 and 1925. This man had been consulted for 40 years in Istanbul and Vienna, Austria several times. According to his symptoms, the illness had been diagnosed. From the aetiology, syphilis and tuberculosis were suspected. Austrian doctors had called it an unknown protozoal disease. Ophthalmologists had described the ocular symptoms as iritis, which might be the result of syphilis, tuberculosis or streptococcal or staphylococcal infections. After several iridectomies, the patient had completely lost his vision. Behçet continued to follow up the patient for many years.

In 1930, a woman suffering from irritation in her eye and with lesions in her mouth and genital regions was referred to Behçet&#x27;s clinic and told him that these symptoms had been recurring for several years. He consulted the patient until 1932 and tried to diagnose the aetiological agent for tuberculosis, syphilis or mycosis etc. by biopsy and other laboratory analysis, but he could not find anything. The prominent ophthalmologists Murat Rahmi and Iggescheimer had been also consulted.

Following those two patients, in 1936 a male patient from a dental clinic with oral wounds, acneiform signs on the back, scrotal ulcer, eye irritation, evening fever, and abdominal pain was sent to his clinic. After the consultation, nothing except a dental cyst was found. Behçet thought the recurrent symptoms might be due to a virus. He referred the patient to Braun, who did a viral investigation and found some corpuscular structures.

Behçet, with the symptoms of these three patients whom he had followed for years, then decided that they were the symptoms of a new disease and in 1936, he described the situation in a meeting and this was published in the &quot;Archives of Dermatology and Venereal Disease&quot;. He wrote in 1937 his ideas in the &quot;Dermatologische Wochenschrift&quot; and the same year he presented it at the meeting of the Dermatology Association of Paris. At this meeting, he declared that a dental infection might cause the etiology of the disease. In 1938, he published his ideas about the subject in the &quot;Dermatologische Wochenschrift&quot; in a more detailed form. In the same year, Niyazi Gözcü and Frank reported two new cases with the same symptoms. The Belgian scientists Weekers and Reginster, and the Italian Frachescetti reported some patients with similar symptoms. Therefore, European doctors had accepted the appearance of a new disease.

Ophthalmologists had begun to accept &quot;Behçet&#x27;s Disease&quot;, but dermatologists kept denying the new disease, insisting they could be symptoms of known diseases. While that debate was taking place, some new cases were reported from Belgium, Austria, the U.S., Japan, Denmark and Switzerland. When they had been published, the whole world finally came to accept that they were confronted with a new disease. In 1947, at the suggestion of Mischner of the Zurich Medical Faculty during the International Medical Congress of Geneva, the finding of Behçet was named &quot;Morbus Behçet&quot;. Though it was evaluated in the early days as &quot;Behçet&#x27;s Syndrome&quot;, &quot;Trisymptom Behçet&quot;, and &quot;Morbus Behçet&quot;, today the disease is universally called ‘’’Behçet&#x27;s Disease’’’ in medical literature. Behçet published 126 national and international articles between 1921 and 1940. 53 of those appeared in prestigious European scientific journals.

== Personal life ==
Behçet was deeply interested in the arts, particularly literature. Generally, he was a nervous man and suffered from insomnia, colitis and angina pectoris, but sometimes he was joyful and good-humored among friends. He divorced from his wife seven years before his death from a heart attack on 8 March 1948. He also liked to travel. This, together with his passion for dermatology and education, led him to many national and international medical congresses. He also published 137 scientific papers, 2 books, 12 monographs and 17 medical translations.

== Commemoration ==
In 1975, 27 years after his death, he was honored with the TÜBİTAK Scientific Award. Several classes, laboratories, and libraries had been named in his honor. In national and international congresses, events like &quot;Korean-Turkish Behçet Days&quot; take place. In 1980, on the initiative of one of his students, a postal stamp was issued in his commemoration, about which an article was published in the &quot;Journal of the American Dental Association&quot;. His biography was published in the &quot;Journal of Philatelic Society&quot; and in the &quot;Medical Bulletin of the United States Army, Europe’’ and ’’Seventh Army&#x27;s Medical Bulletin&quot;.

In 1982, he was awarded the Medical Award of the Turkish Republic by the Eczacıbaşı Foundation of Scientific Research. In 1996, the Turkish mint released a silver commemorative coin for Behçet during the National Dermatology Congress.

<text>Hiroyasu Koga ( &quot;Koga Hiroyasu&quot;, born 15 August 1947) is a former Tatenokai member and &quot;kaishakunin&quot; responsible for the decapitations of Yukio Mishima and Masakatsu Morita during their &quot;seppuku&quot; on November 25, 1970. He studied law at Kanagawa University and intended to become a lawyer.

Koga, known by the nickname Furu-Koga (distinguishing him from another Tatenokai member named Masayoshi Koga who was in turn nicknamed Chibi-Koga, ), was a skilled practitioner of kendo (swordsmanship). It was originally planned that Mishima would be decapitated by Masakatsu Morita, the Tatenokai&#x27;s student leader; however, Morita was not trained in the sword and failed, at which point Koga stepped in to complete it. Koga then decapitated Morita as part of Morita&#x27;s own &quot;seppuku&quot;.

Koga and two other participating Tatenokai members (Masayoshi Koga and Masahiro Ogawa) went on trial on March 24, 1971, facing charges of bodily injury, violence, illegal possession of firearms and swords, and assisting a suicide. They were convicted and sentenced to four years&#x27; penal servitude, and were released in 1974, a few months early.

As of 2005, it was believed that he was a practising Shinto priest at a shrine on Shikoku. However, an alternative belief is that he never became a Shinto priest, instead becoming the head of the Hokkaido branch of Seicho no Ie and was renamed Hiroyasu Arechi.

<text>, full name and also known as , is a Japanese professional football club based in Chiba, capital of Chiba Prefecture. They currently play in the J2 League, Japanese second tier of professional football.

== History ==

=== Furukawa Electric SC (1946–1991) ===
The club began as the company team, in 1946. As the company team, it won the Japan Soccer League twice, the Emperor&#x27;s Cup four times and the JSL League Cup three times. Furukawa also won the 1986–87 Asian Club Championship, the top club honour in Asia; they were the first Japanese club to do so.

The club was a founding member (&quot;Original Eight&quot;) of the Japan Soccer League (JSL) in 1965. Since the league&#x27;s inception, the club had always played in the top flight in Japan and was the only Japanese club to never be relegated from the JSL Division 1, a record they kept into the J1 years. They did finish the 1978 season in a relegation position (last of 10) but stayed up after beating Honda FC 1–0 on aggregate in a two-legged playoff. The last place was not automatically relegated until the 1980 season.

=== JEF United Ichihara (1992–2004) ===
In 1991, it merged with the JR East&#x27;s company team to become and rebranded itself as JEF United Ichihara upon the J.League&#x27;s founding in 1993. JEF United Ichihara was an original member (&quot;Original Ten&quot;) of the J.League in 1993. The club initially built itself around the former Germany national football team player Pierre Littbarski.

From 1998 to 2000, the club struggled to stay in the J.League and it began a series of efforts to be a competitive team. Since the hiring of Ivica Osim in 2003, JEF United has contended for the league title each year despite limited resources and struggling attendance.

=== JEF United Chiba (2005–) ===
On 1 February 2005, the club changed its name from &quot;JEF United Ichihara&quot; to the current name after Chiba city had joined Ichihara, Chiba as its hometown in 2003. Of its club name, &quot;JEF&quot; is taken from the JR East and Furukawa Electric companies and &quot;United&quot; is meant to represent the unity of the club and its home city. Also, JEF United is the only team in J.League which corporate name survived the transition from the JSL in 1992, as J.League mandated that &quot;corporate teams are not allowed in the J.League&quot;, and that any corporate teams need to adapt a hometown and name themselves after it, rather than their owner companies.

On 16 July 2006, Osim left the club to take over the coach of the Japan national team and was succeeded by Amar Osim, his son and assistant coach.
On December 5, 2007, it was announced that Amar Osim had been sacked after the club&#x27;s lowly 13th-place finish in the 2007 season.

After 13 games in the 2008 season Josip Kuže was sacked as team manager. On 8 May 2008 it was announced that the new manager was Alex Miller. Miller was First Team Coach at Liverpool F.C. alongside Rafael Benítez prior to joining JEF United.

The Furukawa Electric is no longer the main sponsor of the club, a job these days taken over by Fuji Electric.

On November 8, 2009, JEF United Chiba was relegated to J2 after 44 seasons in the Japanese top division; since 2010, JEF United Chiba is playing in J.League Division 2.

JEF United Chiba was close to being promoted to J.League Division 1 during the 2012 season. The club was considered one of the favorites to be directly promoted to J1. However, after defeats to clubs considered lesser than them such as FC Gifu and F.C. Machida Zelvia, JEF played the playoffs, making their road to the final. They defeated Yokohama FC by 4–0, but lost the final match to Oita Trinita by 1–0, at Tokyo National Stadium.

In the 2013 season they played in the promotion to J1 playoffs. They lost the semi-final match to Tokushima Vortis by 1–1(Chiba was 6th place and Tokushima was 3rd place in the league, regulation decides up high club can go final even draw.)

In the 2014 season they played in the promotion playoffs to J1 again. The club did not have to play in the semi-final (Chiba was 4th place but the 3rd place club named Giravanz Kitakyushu had a J League original stadium problem so Kitakyushu could not go to the promotion play off). In the final against Montedio Yamagata, they lost by 0–1, at Ajinomoto Stadium.

The club will play their 14th consecutive season at the J2 on 2023.

== Symbols ==

=== Stadiums ===

It had played its home matches at Ichihara Seaside Stadium, but has since moved to the larger, football-specific and more conveniently located Fukuda Denshi Arena, which opened in Chiba during the 2005 season. The club had initially practiced at Urayasu, Chiba planning to base itself in Narashino, Chiba before opposition by those living around Akitsu Stadium forced it to be based in Ichihara. Since 2000, training has been held at Footpark Anesaki in Ichihara in normally.
Since 1 October 2009, they made new practice place UNITED PARK near the Fukuda Denshi Arena.

=== Mascot ===

JEF United Ichihara&#x27;s mascot characters are Akita Inu brothers named Jeffy and Unity. The squad number of Jeffy is 2 and that of Unity is 9. They are also joined by a third mascot named Mina, or Mina-chan. Her backstory was that she one day came to Soga Station (the railway station nearest to Fukuda Denshi Arena) and offered to work alongside Jeffy and Unity. Her squad number is 12.

=== Slogan ===
JEF United considers its philosophy to be encapsulated in its tagline &quot;Win By All&quot; since 2001.

== Affiliated clubs ==

=== Furukawa Electric Chiba ===
This was JEF&#x27;s reserve team during the JSL years. They were formed in 1967 and were first promoted to the JSL Second Division in 1975. They still exist, although they are no longer affiliated on paper, and play in the Kanto Regional League. In 2008 they renamed themselves &quot;S.A.I. Ichihara&quot; and in 2011 they adopted the name Vonds Ichihara. Now separate from Furukawa Electric control, they aim to form its power base in Ichihara as JEF is now based in Chiba city.

=== JEF Reserves ===
JEF&#x27;s reserve team played until 2011 in the Japan Football League, the third tier of Japanese football. But in 2011, the club announced the end of the B team because of financial problems.

=== JEF United Chiba Ladies ===
== Rivalries ==
=== Marunouchi Gosanke ===
Historically, JEF United&#x27;s fiercest rivals have been Kashiwa Reysol and Urawa Reds, both close neighbors. The three were co-founders (&quot;Original Eight&quot;) of the Japan Soccer League (JSL) in 1965, and spent most seasons in the top tier through the JSL era. Because of their former parent companies&#x27; headquarters being all based in Marunouchi, Tokyo, the three clubs were known as the &quot;Marunouchi Gosanke&quot; () and fixtures among them were known as the Marunouchi derbies.

=== Chiba derby ===
JEF United and Reysol first met in 1941 in ancient Kanto regional football league. The two clubs both now based in Chiba Prefecture, and their rivalry is known as the Chiba derby. They annually contest a pre-season friendly match well known as the Chibagin Cup (i.e., &quot;Chiba Bank Cup&quot;) since 1995.

<doc id="1175222" wikidata="Q561231" url="?curid=1175222" title="Hans Albers">
<text>Hans Philipp August Albers (22 September 1891 – 24 July 1960), also known by his nickname “der blonde Hans” (The Blond Hans), was a German actor and singer. He was the biggest male movie star in Germany between 1930 and 1960 and one of the most popular German actors of the twentieth century.

== Early life ==
Hans Albers was born in Hamburg, the son of a butcher, and grew up in the district of St. Georg. He was seriously interested in acting by his late teens and took acting classes without the knowledge of his parents. In 1915 Albers was drafted to serve in the German Army in World War I, but was wounded early on. After his release from the Hospital in Wiesbaden where he had been treated, he performed in the local Residenztheater in comedies, antics and operettas. After the war Albers moved to Berlin, where he found work as a comedic actor in various Weimar-Era Berlin theatres. His breakthrough performance was that of a waiter in the play &quot;Verbrecher&quot; (Criminals). It was also in Berlin that Albers began a long-term relationship with Jewish actress Hansi Burg (1898–1975). Their relationship ended only when he died in 1960.

After roles in over one hundred silent films, Albers starred in the first German talkie &quot;Die Nacht gehört uns&quot; (&quot;The Night Belongs to Us&quot;) in 1929. Soon thereafter, Albers played big-mouthed strong man Mazeppa alongside Marlene Dietrich in her star-making classic &quot;Der blaue Engel&quot; (&quot;The Blue Angel&quot;). Albers himself shot to fame in 1930 with the movie &quot;The Copper&quot; and constantly enhanced his star status with similar daredevil roles in the 1930s. He was probably at his best when teamed-up with fellow German movie legend Heinz Rühmann, as in &quot;Bombs on Monte Carlo&quot; (1931) and &quot;Der Mann, der Sherlock Holmes war&quot; (1937). Many of Albers&#x27; songs from his movies became huge hits and some even remain popular to this day.

== The 1930s and the Second World War ==
When the Nazis came to power in 1933, Albers and his Jewish girlfriend Hansi Burg moved to Lake Starnberg in Bavaria. They married in 1934 and Albers&#x27; contract with UFA was cancelled. While Albers himself never showed public support for the Nazi regime, he became the most popular actor under Nazi rule. The actor nevertheless avoided an overly close association in public. As the ultimate sign of his popularity, the Nazis even silently accepted his relationship with Hansi Burg for a long time. But Albers finally gave in to pressure. Hansi Burg went to Switzerland and then to Great Britain in 1939, but they secretly remained a couple with him even managing to send her financial support. They were reunited after the war, when she returned to Germany in a British uniform.

In 1943, Albers was paid a huge sum of money to star in UFA&#x27;s big-budgeted anniversary picture &quot;Münchhausen&quot; but was careful not to give the impression that he was endorsing the National Socialist regime, which was indeed never asked of him. Also in 1943, Albers starred in another classic German film &quot;Große Freiheit Nr. 7&quot; with actress Ilse Werner. Some of the scenes are said to have been shot in Prague because of bomb damage to Hamburg. The sailing ship &quot;Padua&quot; used for the outdoor scenes of the film has survived under Soviet and Russian flag until this day as &quot;Kruzenshtern&quot;.

==Post war==
After World War II Albers was affluent and, on account of his association with Hansi Burg, he avoided the professional ban and financial plight which many actors were facing at that time. Nevertheless, German &quot;heroes&quot; were considered undesirable by the occupation government that wanted to promote its own stars. This accounted for a major hiatus in his career and made him hard to cast. Eventually he found an opening with respectable wisdom-with-age type character parts, and enjoyed some public acclaim, but with these parts he never again enjoyed his huge stardom of the 1930s and early 1940s. By the early 1950s, his age was finally beginning to show and his powerful presence and freshness were almost wholly lost. His decline was exacerbated by his increasing alcoholism during the 1950s. Yet he remained active in movies until the very end.

== Death ==

Hans Albers collapsed during a theater performance with massive internal bleeding and died months later on 24 July 1960 at a sanatorium in Kempfenhausen near Lake Starnberg at the age of 68. He was cremated and subsequently buried at the Ohlsdorf Cemetery in Hamburg, the city of his birth.

==Legacy==

Albers&#x27; name will forever be closely associated with his hometown of Hamburg, in particular the district of St. Pauli where there is a square named &quot;Hans-Albers-Platz&quot; in his honour. Today he is probably better known for his music than his films; some of his songs have remained familiar to later generations of Germans.

Outside of Northern Europe, Albers remains virtually unknown; however the image of an older man in a seaman&#x27;s cap and raincoat playing accordion and singing remains familiar internationally. As a case in point, McDonald&#x27;s used such an image in an American television ad campaign in 1986. Albers actually had no significant experience on the water, this being restricted to a one-day trip to Heligoland.

Many of Albers&#x27; songs were humorous tales of drunken, womanizing sailors on shore-leave, with double entendres such as &quot;It hurts the first time, but with time, you get used to it&quot; in reference to a girl falling in love for the first time. Albers&#x27; songs were often peppered with expressions in Low German, which is spoken in Northern Germany. One of his signature songs is &quot;Auf der Reeperbahn nachts um halb eins&quot;, (&quot;On the Reeperbahn at Half Past Midnight&quot;) which has become one of the best-known songs about Hamburg and also an unofficial anthem of the St. Pauli district where the Reeperbahn itself is located. &quot;Hans-Albers-Platz&quot;, one block south of the Reeperbahn, features a statue of Albers, created by the German artist Jörg Immendorff.

<doc id="1175232" wikidata="Q19772" url="?curid=1175232" title="Radlett">
<text>Radlett is a large village in Hertfordshire, England, between Elstree and St Albans on Watling Street, with a population of 10,060. It is in the council district of Hertsmere in the south of the county, and forms part of the civil parish of Aldenham. Radlett is located inside the M25 motorway.

==Locality==
Radlett lies in the valley of Tykes Water, a stream that runs north from Aldenham Reservoir to the River Colne. Now entirely surrounded by the Metropolitan Green Belt, it is subject to significant &#x27;infill&#x27; development and there is pressure to relax the Green Belt restrictions.

Radlett is located 14 miles (22.5 km) north west of the centre of London. It is one of the wealthiest places in Britain and the second most expensive town to buy a house outside London. The town contains many substantial detached houses with large gardens. In the older centre there are also a few streets with Victorian semi detached and terraced houses.

Watling Street, which is the main road through Radlett, has a wide variety of local shops and restaurants, as well as some national chain stores, a Post Office inside the local Budgens supermarket, and the Radlett Centre with a 300-seat auditorium for various performances. Attached to the Radlett Centre is the local Public Library.

There are two public houses in Radlett: &quot;The Red Lion&quot; and “No.58”.

==History==
===Pre-Roman period===
Radlett is situated on the ancient Watling Street, one of the oldest trackways in Britain. Various archaeological finds of Mesolithic and Neolithic flints provide evidence that the Radlett area was inhabited in the Stone Age; the land was densely wooded and remained so until the Middle Ages. The Catuvellauni tribe settled in parts of Hertfordshire, near St Albans and Wheathamstead in about 80BC, although no trace of settlement has been found in or near Radlett itself. The name Radlett appears to come from the Old-English rad-gelaete meaning a junction of the roads and it is likely that the settlement grew at the point where the ancient route from Aldenham to Shenley crosses Watling Street.

===Roman period===
During the Roman occupation of Verulamium, the area from Radlett to Brockley Hill was home to a number of major potteries, which supplied not only the Roman capital but other parts of the province. One of these potteries is known to have existed on Loom Lane. Roman-era clay pits are still in evidence at the southern end of the village, in the area around Cobden hill and Tabard RFC. In addition, there is evidence of a Roman villa with a bath building, barn and tile kiln dating from 2nd to 4th century AD, in the area of Netherwylde Farm.

===Post-Roman period===
Wratten notes that the area was settled by the Saxons by the sixth century, with suggestions that a Saxon church was established on the site of Aldenham Church in King Offa&#x27;s time. For most of recorded history, the land to the East of Watling Street was administered separately to that on the West.

The Domesday survey of 1086 confirms that most of the land was in the possession of the Abbey of Westminster, though parts of Titeberst (land to the east of Watling Street) were claimed by St Albans. The two major tenants were listed as Geoffrey de Mandeville and Geoffrey de Bec and they leased part of their holdings to tenant farmers. The land was densely forested but was gradually cleared throughout the medieval period for agricultural use and the population lived in dispersed farm settlements adjacent to field strips or scattered around the periphery of common land which made up a substantial part of the southern and western area of the Parish.

It is known that in the thirteenth century, gallows were erected jointly by the Abbots of Westminster and St Albans &#x27;in a certain spot called Keneprowe&#x27; (now Kemp Row), for trials conducted at Aldenham.

Radlett seems to have consisted of two farms: Darnells (first mentioned in 1358) and Gills Hill on the west side of Watling Street; and the estates of Aldenham Lodge, Newberries and Organ Hall on the east, plus Newlands (first recorded in 1291) and a few cottages. There are records of at least two other medieval moated homesteads within the Parish – Penne&#x27;s Place and Kendals, but tantalisingly little physical evidence.

The first recorded reference of Radlett comes from 1453 and it was usually spelt with one T until the mid-nineteenth century. With the dissolution of the monasteries in 1536, the disputes over land ownership in the Parish between St Albans Abbey and Westminster Abbey ceased to be viable and the land was sold to create revenue for the Crown.

===Modern period===
In 1823 the town was the site of the Radlett murder, a notorious crime which became the subject of numerous books and stage plays. The victim, William Weare, was killed on Gills Hill Lane (subsequently popularly known as Murder Lane), with the site gaining such notoriety that it became a tourist attraction for some time.

In 1860 the Midland Railway was extended from Bedford into London and a station was built at Radlett connecting it with London. On 8 December 1865 the Ecclesiastical Parish of Radlett was created out of the eastern part of Aldenham and this marks the start of the modern history of the village. Development could only start when the landowners sold off their land for this purpose and this started in the final decade of the 19th century when land to the west of Watling Street was sold off. In 1910 the estate of Aldenham Lodge to the north of Shenley Hill was released for development and in 1935 the Newberries estate. Newberries mansion was demolished in the 1950s and Aldenham Lodge in 1964.

Handley Page Ltd opened a grass airfield just north of the town in 1929 for the production of aircraft. By 1939 Radlett Aerodrome was upgraded to have three hard runways for use in the production of Handley Page Hampden and Handley Page Halifax bombers during the Second World War. Post-war the airfield was used for production of Handley Page Hastings transport aircraft and Handley Page Hermes airliners. The SBAC held air shows here in 1946 and 1947 which subsequently moved to Farnborough. The Handley Page Victor bomber prototype was built here, with the main runway being extended in 1952 to allow flight testing, and there is now a road on this site named in its honour next to a DPD depot. Handley Page went bankrupt in 1969 and the airfield closed in 1970.

The 1948 Olympic Marathon went through Radlett. It was an out-and-back course from the Empire Stadium, Wembley.

In 1977 Eddie Kidd the stunt rider jumped over 14 London Double Decker buses at the former Radlett Aerodrome.

The introduction of the Metropolitan Green Belt in the 1950s set a legal framework limiting further outward growth beyond the then existing limits of the village, and since then new development has been restricted to infilling within the built-up area. Despite this, many new houses continue to be built in former large gardens, and the population now stands at just over 10,000.
In 2005, and 2006, there was a large campaign in the village, and surrounding areas to save the Fire Station, which was opened 100 years ago. The campaign failed, and the station closed in October 2006. The campaign continued for a while after the closure, however the fire station has now been demolished.

==Governance==
There are three tiers of local government covering Radlett, at parish, district (borough), and county level: Aldenham Parish Council, Hertsmere Borough Council, and Hertfordshire County Council.

Radlett is the main settlement within the parish of Aldenham, having grown to be significantly larger than Aldenham village. The parish council retains the historic Aldenham name, but has its offices in Radlett at the Radlett Centre. For representation on Hertsmere Borough Council, the parish of Aldenham is divided into two wards called Aldenham East and Aldenham West. The urban area of Radlett straddles these two wards.

Radlett is classed as a post town by the Royal Mail, corresponding to the WD7 postcode district, which also covers the neighbouring village of Shenley.

==Transport==
Radlett lies close to the M25 and M1 motorways and the A1 trunk road. There is a 24-hour metro-style commuter rail service on the Thameslink route that connects Radlett railway station to central London including St Pancras International taking from as little as 21 minutes, Farringdon (25 mins), City Thameslink and Blackfriars. From Radlett there are also direct train services to London Gatwick and London Luton airports, whilst London Heathrow is a thirty-minute drive away. Radlett is part of Transport for London&#x27;s (TfL) Oyster card and contactless payment travel system.

There are two main buses that run through Radlett, both operated by Uno. Route 602 runs roughly east–west connecting Watford, Radlett, St Albans and Hatfield and route 601 running roughly north–south connecting Hatfield, St Albans, Radlett and Borehamwood.

==Religion==

===2021 Census data===

As of the 2021 census, Radlett had an official Jewish population of 29.6% which was one of the highest concentrations in the country. Those identifying as Christian constituted 35.6%, forming a plurality.

===Places of worship===

There are four churches in Radlett: Christ Church, an Anglican church on Watling Street founded in 1864; St. Anthony of Padua Catholic Church in The Crosspath; St. John&#x27;s Anglican church, a sister church of Christ Church, in Gills Hill Lane; and The United Free Church in Station Road. The United Free Church was formed by uniting the Methodist and United Reformed Churches in Radlett.

There are three synagogues: the Radlett United Synagogue which serves the Orthodox Jewish community, and the Radlett Reform Synagogue (formerly Radlett &amp; Bushey Reform Synagogue) which serves the Reform Jewish community, as well as the Chabad of Radlett Synagogue Chabad house.

<doc id="1175235" wikidata="Q5367991" url="?curid=1175235" title="Flipper's Guitar">
<text>Flipper&#x27;s Guitar (フリッパーズ・ギター) were a Tokyo-based rock band led by (and later a duo of) Keigo Oyamada and Kenji Ozawa. The band were influenced by the chirpy sound of British 80s pop and post-punk groups like Haircut 100, Exhibit B, Orange Juice, The Style Council and Aztec Camera, as well as the fashionably eclectic sounds of early 90s Britain, from alternative dance to acid jazz.

The group were an important part of the Tokyo Shibuya-kei scene in the late 1980s to early 1990s, and Oyamada went on to produce work for Pizzicato Five and his close friend Kahimi Karie.

The band wears their influence on their sleeves, their song titles often citing their British artists&#x27; influence — &quot;Goodbye Our Pastels Badges&quot;, &quot;Haircut One Hundred&quot;, &quot;The Colourfield.&quot;

Following the demise of the band in 1991, the two members pursued solo careers. Ozawa released the album &quot;The Dogs Bark But The Caravan Moves On&quot; under his own name, and Oyamada began recording under the name of Cornelius. It was as Cornelius that Oyamada gained a minor cult following outside Japan, as well as remix work for the likes of Blur, Beck, and the Manic Street Preachers.

==History==

===Lollipop Sonic and formation (1987-1988)===
Flipper&#x27;s Guitar formed in 1987 and were originally known as Lollipop Sonic. The group formed in junior high school as a five-piece consisting of Keigo Oyamada (vocals, guitar), Kenji Ozawa (guitar, vocals), Shusaku Yoshida (bass), Yasunobu Arakawa (drums) and Yukiko Inoue (keyboards). This early line-up lasted until early 1990 when Yoshida, Arakawa and Inoue were asked to leave.

In 1988, prior to signing with Polystar records, the group released material on a pair of independent cassettes. The first &quot;Favorite Shirts&quot;, the title is a reference to Haircut One Hundred&#x27;s song of the same name, was a self-released 11-track cassette. The majority of the songs were re-recorded for the release the following year as the band&#x27;s debut album. The second cassette, &quot;Akko-Chan&#x27;s Anorak Party!&quot;, was a split-compilation that also included songs by the obscure Japanese groups; Penny Arcade and Debonaire. Some of Lollipop Sonic&#x27;s tracks had already appeared on &quot;Favorite Shirt&quot;.

===&quot;Three Cheers for Our Side&quot; (1989)===
The group was &#x27;discovered&#x27; by Zin Yoshida of the cult-Japanese new wave duo Salon Music. In 1989, Yoshida helped arrange for the group to sign with the major-record label Polystar. At the behest of their label the group renamed themselves Flipper&#x27;s Guitar, a reference to the dolphins on the cover of the Orange Juice album You Can&#x27;t Hide Your Love Forever. Still a five-piece they re-recorded the majority of their early material for release as their debut album. The album was produced by Zin N. Summer (a.k.a. Zin Yoshida), Hitomi T. (a.k.a. Hitomi Takenaka) (also of Salon Music) and Kenichi Makimura. Lead guitarist Ozawa wrote the lyrics for all songs. Music was written by Oyamada and Ozawa with arrangements by the band, Zin N. Summer and Hitomi T.

The resulting album &quot;Three Cheers for Our Side&quot; (海へ行くつもりじゃなかった), the title a homage to an Orange Juice song, was released in August 1989. While a fairly straightforward guitar-pop album, it showcased a wide array of sounds including elements of bossa nova, beach rock, and jazz. The group&#x27;s fascination with European-style, British 80s guitar pop (&quot;Goodbye, Our Pastels Badges&quot;) and American 60s pop (Lou Reed name-checked in the credits) was already evident. The album was sung entirely in English. The artwork, aside from lyric and song-title translations, were also displayed in English, and featured a comic strip by cartoonist Jonathan Lemon. Despite having major-label distribution the album was not a commercial success in Japan.

===&quot;Camera Talk&quot; (1990)===
1990 was a major year for the group. The group, now a duo, released several singles and their landmark second album. The first small coup for the duo came when their first single of the year &quot;Friends Again&quot; was featured in the film &quot;Octopus Army ~ Shibuya de aitai!&quot; This gave the group a lot of exposure to audiences outside of the small alternative scene. The single was also their first material produced by Oyamada and Ozawa themselves under the name Double Knockout Corporation. KO being Oyamada and Ozawa&#x27;s initials. The single also marked the beginning of their contact with the European music scene. The group filmed the music video for &quot;Friends Again&quot; in France. Flipper&#x27;s Guitar&#x27;s second album &quot;Camera Talk&quot;, released later that year, credits French and English recording studios as well as British musicians John &quot;Segs&quot; Jennings (from The Ruts/Ruts DC) and David Ruffy (The Ruts, Aztec Camera) on several tracks.

In Japan, a major breakthrough came when their second single of 1990, the jazz-influenced &quot;Young, Alive, In Love&quot; was featured as the main theme song to the popular drama &quot;Youbikou Bugi&quot; (&quot;Cram-school Boogie&quot;). Aside from the extra exposure the decision to sing in Japanese marked a turning-point for the duo. All subsequent Flipper&#x27;s Guitar songs were written in Japanese with occasional choruses adopting English. Due to the sudden uplift in popularity the group&#x27;s second album &quot;Camera Talk&quot; (カメラ・トーク) was released in June 1990 to much greater anticipation and sales. The album produced by &#x27;Double Knockout Corporation&#x27; and Zin Yoshida. The album shows the group widening its guitar-orientated sound to take-in bossa nova/Latin, vocal jazz, house music, and spy thriller instrumentals. The influence of new wave British guitar-pop was present in equal measure and if anything more apparent than on the debut. Songs titled after the British acts Haircut 100 and The Colourfield made the connection overt.
Flipper&#x27;s Guitar followed &quot;Camera Talk&quot; with their first national tour. The duo kept busy in the studio releasing the extended-play &quot;Camera! Camera! Camera!&quot; in September and the non-album single &quot;Love Train&quot; b/w &quot;Slide&quot; in November. The title-track of &quot;Camera! Camera! Camera!&quot; is an alternate &#x27;guitar pop&#x27; recording of the &quot;Camera Talk&quot; album track with John &quot;Segs&quot; Jennings and David Ruffy.

===&quot;Doctor Head&#x27;s World Tower&quot; (1991)===
1991 found the group pursuing their interest in the British alternative scenes of House, Madchester/Baggy and an extensive use of sampling.
&quot;Groove Tube&quot;, their first single of 1991 and a primer for their third album had a new sound that combined pop accessibility with shoegaze and Madchester/Baggy styles. The single bears a similarity to &quot;Fool&#x27;s Gold&quot; by The Stone Roses, &quot;Soon&quot; by My Bloody Valentine and &quot;Come Together&quot; by Primal Scream.

That summer the group released &quot;Doctor Head&#x27;s World Tower&quot; (ヘッド博士の世界塔). The album title is a reference to The Monkees&#x27;s 1968 movie &quot;Head&quot;. Samples of dialogue from &quot;Head&quot; appear throughout. Stylistically the album was another leap-forward for the group that showcased an increased use of sampling and the obvious influence of groups like Primal Scream and the Happy Mondays giving the album a tripped-out dance groove. Gone were short acoustic pop songs of the debut and the bossa nova/Latin, vocal jazz leanings of &quot;Camera Talk&quot;. In there place were songs of much greater length, three of which were over six-minutes long.

The group&#x27;s innovative method of sampling involved a cut-and-paste construction and marriage of samples from The Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;God Only Knows&quot; to Eyeless in Gaza&#x27;s &quot;Changing Stations&quot; and lifting a large portion of Strawberry Switchblade&#x27;s &quot;Trees and Flowers&quot; (&quot;Dolphin Song&quot;). The album&#x27;s closing track &quot;The World Tower&quot; at ten minutes in length is a psychedelic track that segues between sections of guitar-rock, music-hall and sound collages. The album was followed by the group&#x27;s final single, &quot;Blue Shinin&#x27; Quick Star&quot; b/w &quot;Dolphin Song&quot;.

===Break-up===
In the months after the release of &quot;Doctor Head&#x27;s World Tower&quot;, tensions between Ozawa and Oyamada broke-out into acrimony. Flipper&#x27;s Guitar announced that they had broken-up in October that year. Booked tour dates were cancelled.

Since the duo&#x27;s split their label Polystar has issued several compilation albums. The first &quot;Colour Me Pop&quot; (カラー・ミー・ポップ) released December 1991 collected non-album singles, b-sides, live-tracks and rarities. A live-album &quot;On Pleasure Bent&quot;, compiled from tours in 1990 and 1991, followed in 1992. That same year the 12-track &quot;Singles&quot; album was also released. &quot;Treasure Collection&quot;, a further compilation followed in 1999. &quot;Lost Pictures, Original Clips &amp; CMS + Testament&quot;, a video collection was released in 1993 on VHS and on DVD in 2004. &quot;Tribute to Flipper&#x27;s Guitar: Friends Again&quot;, a tribute album was released in 2004.

===After Flipper&#x27;s Guitar===
Following the demise of the band in 1991, the two members pursued solo careers. Ozawa began a solo career and released the album &quot;The Dogs Bark But The Caravan Moves On&quot; under his own name. Oyamada began recording under the name of Cornelius. It was as Cornelius that Oyamada gained a minor cult following outside Japan, as well as remix work for the likes of Blur, Beck, and the Manic Street Preachers. Oyamada formed and ran the sub-label Trattoria for Polystar records.

<doc id="1175241" wikidata="Q4750984" url="?curid=1175241" title="Anakonda">
<text>Anakonda is the final studio album by American rapper Akinyele. It was released in 2001 on Koch Records. &quot;Anakonda&quot; proved to be the least successful of Akinyele&#x27;s albums, not making it to any of the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Exclaim!&quot; wrote that &quot;undoubtedly the intention was to shock, but the mediocre skills and pedestrian beats instead induce rolling of the eyes.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; thought that &quot;the veteran Queens rapper again spits out the raunchiest raps north of Miami’s 2 Live Crew.&quot;

&quot;USA Today&quot; listed &quot;Anakonda&quot; as the fifth worst R&amp;B album of 2001, writing: &quot;The explicit rapper&#x27;s raunchy antics used to make you laugh or cringe. But at this point, there are no surprises left.&quot;

<doc id="1175244" wikidata="Q7327926" url="?curid=1175244" title="Richard Mouw">
<text>Richard John Mouw (born 1940) is an American theologian and philosopher. He held the position of President at Fuller Theological Seminary for 20 years (1993–2013), and continues to hold the post of Professor of Faith and Public Life.

== Education and career ==
Mouw was born on April 22, 1940. He received the BA from Houghton College. He then studied at Western Theological Seminary. He was awarded the MA from the University of Alberta, and his PhD from the University of Chicago.

Mouw was Professor of Christian philosophy at Calvin University for seventeen years. He has also served as a visiting professor to the Free University of Amsterdam. He was appointed Professor of Christian Philosophy and Ethics at Fuller Theological Seminary in 1985. In 1993 he was elected president of Fuller Theological Seminary, retiring after the 2012–2013 academic year after 20 years of service. In 2020, Mouw retired from Fuller and returned to Calvin University, becoming a senior research fellow at the Paul B. Henry Institute for the Study of Christianity and Politics.

In 2007, Mouw, who sees Abraham Kuyper as a personal hero, was awarded the Abraham Kuyper Prize for Excellence in Reformed Theology and Public Life at Princeton Theological Seminary by the Abraham Kuyper Center for Public Theology.

== Views ==

===Dialogue with Catholics===
In 2009, he signed a public statement encouraging all Christians to &quot;read, wrestle with, and respond to Caritas in Veritate&quot;, the social encyclical by Pope Benedict XVI. He participated in an interfaith dialogue with Donald Senior, President of Catholic Theological Union and Professor of New Testament Studies, at the Arts Club of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, November 14, 2011, which can be viewed on Vimeo.

===Dialogue with Mormons===

In November 2004, Mouw offered introductory remarks at a speaking event where Christian evangelist and apologist Ravi Zacharias was the featured speaker, at the Salt Lake Tabernacle at Temple Square in Salt Lake City, Utah. In his remarks, he apologized to Mormons for the way in which many Evangelicals have treated the Mormon faith. &quot;Let me state it clearly,&quot; Mouw said. &quot;We evangelicals have sinned against you [Mormons].&quot; Since his formal apology to Mormons, he has been criticized by some in the evangelical community for saying that detractors of Mormonism are guilty of &quot;shading the truth&quot;. He has reported that he continues to &quot;get hate mail yet on that.&quot; In an article in the May 2016 issue of &quot;First Things&quot;, he argued that Mormons were progressively de-emphasising the unorthodox aspects of their theology and moving closer to the Christian theological mainstream.

Multiple Mormon commentators have expressed appreciation for Mouw&#x27;s efforts to understand their faith to a greater extent.

<text>The description of the Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age in IPCC reports has changed since the first report in 1990 as scientific understanding of the temperature record of the past 1000 years has improved. The Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and Little Ice Age (LIA) are the best-known temperature fluctuations in the last millennium.

Critics of the &quot;hockey stick graph&quot; of all subsequent reports have claimed that the record of the MWP and LIA were suppressed in the IPCC Third Assessment Report although every report discussed the phenomena.

With the growth of interest in global warming in the 1980s came renewed interest in the past temperature record as well as the question of whether past times had been warmer or colder than &quot;present&quot;. However, available records were then few. In Chapter 7 &quot;Observed Climate Variations and Change&quot;, the Executive Summary on page 199 noted that palaeo-climatic evidence indicated surface temperature &quot;fluctuations including the Holocene Optimum around 5,000-6,000 years ago, the shorter Medieval Warm Period around 1000 AD (which may not have been global) and the Little Ice Age which ended only in the middle to late nineteenth century. Details are often poorly known because palaeo-climatic data are frequently sparse.&quot;

Section &quot;7.2.7 Climate Of The Past 5,000,000 Years&quot; of the report included, on page 202, &quot;Figure 7.1: Schematic diagrams of global temperature variations since the Pleistocene on three time scales&quot;. The third diagram, figure 7.1 (c), used a schematic (non-quantitative) curve to represent temperature variations over the last 1000 years. The vertical temperature scale was labelled as &quot;Temperature change (°C)&quot; but no numerical labels were given; it could be taken to imply that temperature variations of the MWP and LIA were each of the order of 0.5 °C from the temperature around 1900. Text on the same page specifically stated recent climate changes were in a range of probably less than 2 °C. It noted that the &quot;late tenth to early thirteenth centuries (about AD 950-1250) appear to have been exceptionally warm in western Europe, Iceland and Greenland&quot;, and this period &quot;is known as the Medieval Climatic Optimum&quot;.

The 1990 report noted that it was not clear &#x27;whether all the fluctuations indicated were truly global. However, large regional
changes in hydrological conditions have occurred, particularly in the tropics. Wetter conditions in the Sahara from 12 000 to 4,000 years BP enabled cultural groups to survive by hunting and fishing &#x27;(p 202). Figure 7.1 is about global temperature. A paper by Jones, Keith Briffa et al. noted that the schematic 7.1 (c) figure on p. 202 had no clear source, but can be traced to publications by Hubert Lamb representing the Central England temperature record; those publications have no &quot;explicit calibration against instrumental data, [and are] just Lamb’s qualitative judgement and interpretation of what he refers to as the ‘evidence’&quot;.
Within the 1990 report, the LIA is taken to be global in extent but not the MWP. Climate over the last 1000 years is mentioned very briefly in the SPM of the 1990 report. The MWP is not mentioned at all, and the LIA described by &quot;probably fluctuated by little more than 1°C. Some fluctuations lasted several centuries, including the LIA which ended in the [19th century] and which appears to have been global in extent&quot;. The MWP is mentioned in the executive summary to chapter 7, as &quot;MWP around 1000 AD (which may not have been global)&quot;.

== 1992 supplement ==
The 1992 report (appendix C) used only two graphs of pre-instrumental temperatures, from (Wang and Wang 1991). They show air temperature based on documentary evidence in East and North China from 1350 to 1950. Fluctuations are of the order of 0.5-0.75 °C and indicate, variably, colder-than-present temperatures before the 20th century. The graph stops in 1350 and does not show a MWP. The only text reference to the MWP is qualified by in this region in boldface.

== 1995 report (SAR) ==

By 1995, research in the subject had advanced and hemispherical reconstructions of temperature were available, though only for the summer season (because tree rings are often most strongly influenced by summer temperatures). The 1995 IPCC report used a Northern Hemisphere summer temperature reconstruction (fig 3.20) from 1400 to 1979 by (Bradley and Jones 1993). This too shows no MWP (it only goes back to 1400) and colder temperatures otherwise before the 20th century, of the order of 0.5 °C colder. Fig 3.21 shows 8 ice core records from 1200 to present, which display a mixed pattern.

The MWP and LIA are introduced, in the text, as &quot;two periods which have received special attention... These have been interpreted, at times, as periods of global warmth and coolness, respectively. Recent studies have re-evaluated the interval commonly known as the Medieval Warm Period to assess the magnitude and geographical extent of any prolonged warm interval between the 9th and 14th centuries (Hughes and Diaz, 1994). The available evidence is limited (geographically) and is equivocal.&quot; After discussing the evidence, it concluded &quot;a clearer picture may emerge as more and better calibrated proxy records are produced. However, at this point, it is not yet possible to say whether, on a hemispheric scale, temperatures declined from the 11-12th to the 16-17th century. Nor, therefore, is it possible to conclude that global temperatures in the Medieval Warm Period were comparable to the warm decades of the late 20th century.&quot;

== 2001 report (TAR) ==

The 2001 report used Northern Hemisphere warm-season and annual reconstructions from 1000 AD to present by (Mann et al. 1999), and .

The IPCC TAR says of the MWP that &quot;the posited Medieval Warm Period appears to have been less distinct, more moderate in amplitude, and somewhat different in timing at the hemispheric scale than is typically inferred for the conventionally defined European epoch. The Northern Hemisphere mean temperature estimates of , (Mann et al. 1999), and show temperatures from the 11th to 14th centuries to be about 0.2°C warmer than those from the 15th to 19th centuries, but rather below mid-20th century temperatures&quot;.

The TAR discusses &quot;Was there a &quot;Little Ice Age&quot; and a &quot;Medieval Warm Period&quot;?&quot; and says &quot;Thus current evidence does not support globally synchronous periods of anomalous cold or warmth over this timeframe, and the conventional terms of &quot;Little Ice Age&quot; and &quot;Medieval Warm Period&quot; appear to have limited utility in describing trends in hemispheric or global mean temperature changes in past centuries.&quot;

== 2007 report (AR4) ==

The 2007 report used more recent temperature reconstructions including , (Bradley et al. 2003a), (Jones and Mann 2004), . The IPCC concluded &quot;the warmest period prior to the 20th century very likely occurred between 950 and 1100...The evidence currently available indicates that Northern Hemisphere mean temperatures during medieval times (950–1100) were indeed warm in a 2-kyr context and even warmer in relation to the less sparse but still limited evidence of widespread average cool conditions in the 17th century . However, the evidence is not sufficient to support a conclusion that hemispheric mean temperatures were as warm, or the extent of warm regions as expansive, as those in the 20th century as a whole, during any period in medieval times (Jones et al., 2001; Bradley et al., 2003a,b; ).&quot;

== 2013 report (AR5) ==

AR5 prefers the term &quot;Medieval Climate Anomaly&quot; (MCA) to &quot;Medieval Warm Period&quot;. Chapter 5, section 5.3.5.1 discussed work since AR4 on the MCA and LIA. It notes that the timing and spatial structure of the MCA and LIA are complex, with different reconstructions exhibiting warm and cold conditions at different times for different regions and seasons. A combination of Northern Hemisphere temperature reconstructions shows mostly warm conditions from about 950 to about 1250 and colder conditions from about 1450 to about 1850, which are taken to represent the times of the MCA and LIA.

They express high confidence that the mean Northern Hemisphere temperature of the last 30 or 50 years exceed 30- or 50-year means of the past 800 years, and medium confidence that the last 30 years were likely the warmest 30-year period of the last 1400 years.

<doc id="1175251" wikidata="Q6138174" url="?curid=1175251" title="James Logan (statesman)">
<text>James Logan (20 October 167431 October 1751) was a Scots-Irish colonial American statesman, administrator, and scholar who served as the fourteenth mayor of Philadelphia and held a number of other public offices.

Logan was born in the town of Lurgan in County Armagh, Ireland to Ulster Scots Quakers. He served as colonial secretary to William Penn. He was a founding trustee of the College of Philadelphia, the predecessor of the University of Pennsylvania.

==Early life==

Logan was born in Lurgan, County Armagh in present-day Northern Ireland, on 20 October 1674, to parents Patrick Logan (1640–1700) and Isabella, Lady Hume (1647–1722), who married in early 1671, in Midlothian, Scotland. His father had a Master of Arts degree from the University of Edinburgh, and originally was an Anglican clergyman before converting to Quakerism.

James Logan apprenticed with a Dublin-based linen draper, received a good classical and mathematical education, and acquired a knowledge of modern languages not common at the period. The War of 1689–91 obliged him to follow his parents, first to Edinburgh, and then to London and Bristol, England where, in 1693, James replaced his father as schoolmaster. In 1699, he came to the colony of Pennsylvania aboard the &quot;Canterbury&quot; as William Penn&#x27;s secretary. Logan is described as &quot;tall and well-proportioned, with a graceful yet grave demeanor. He had a good complexion, and was quite florid, even in old age; nor did his hair, which was brown, turn grey in the decline of life, nor his eyes require spectacles.&quot;

==Career==

Logan supported proprietary rights in the colonial-era Province of Pennsylvania and became a major landowner in the growing colony; he was also a slave-owner. Logan advanced through several political offices, including clerk (1701), commissioner of property (1701), receiver general (1703), and member of the provincial council (1703).

In 1717, Logan&#x27;s mother came to live with him in Philadelphia; she died on 17 January 1722, at his family home at Stenton in present-day neighbourhood of Logan, named in Logan&#x27;s honour, in Philadelphia.

===Philadelphia and Pennsylvania government===
In 1722, Logan was elected mayor of Philadelphia. During his tenure as mayor, Logan allowed Irish Catholic immigrants to participate in the city&#x27;s first public Mass. He later served as the colony&#x27;s chief justice from 1731 to 1739, and in the absence of a governor of Pennsylvania, became acting governor from 1736 to 1738.

As acting governor, he opposed Quaker pacifism and war tax resistance, and encouraged pacifist Quakers to give up their seats in the Pennsylvania Assembly so that it could make requisitions for the American Revolution, which had begun in many of the initial Thirteen Colonies.

On October 9, 1736, Logan responded to requests from Native American leaders to control the sale of alcohol, which was creating serious social problems, by prohibiting the sale of rum in indigenous communities, but since the penalty was merely a fine of ten pounds and the law was poorly enforced, it did not have a significant effect.

During his tenure as acting governor, Logan played an active role in the territorial expansion of the colony. While William Penn and his immediate successors pursued a policy of friendly relations with the Lenape Indian tribe, Logan and other colony proprietors, including William Penn&#x27;s indebted sons, John, Richard and Thomas Penn, pursued a policy of land acquisition. Such efforts to expand were spurred by increased immigration to the colony and fears that the New York Colony was infringing on Pennsylvania&#x27;s northern borders in the Upper Delaware river valley. In addition, many proprietors (including Logan and the Penn brothers) had engaged in extensive land speculation, selling off lands occupied by the Lenape to new colonists before concluding an official treaty with the tribe.

====Walking Purchase====

As part of his efforts to expand Pennsylvania, Logan signed the Walking Purchase with the Lenape, forcing the tribe to vacate lands in the present-day Lehigh Valley and Northeastern Pennsylvania in Pennsylvania and parts of present-day western New Jersey under the auspices of the tribe having committed to sell the lands to William Penn in 1686, a treaty whose ratifying document is considered by some sources to have been a fabrication, but which was upheld in several federal lawsuits in the early 21st century.

Under the terms of the treaty, the Lenape agreed to cede as much territory as a man could walk in one and one-half days to the Pennsylvania colony; however, Logan used the treaty&#x27;s vague wording, the Lenape&#x27;s unclear diplomatic status, and a heavily influenced (scouts were sent ahead to clear the path of the runners selected to represent the colony) &quot;walk&quot; to claim a much larger territory than was originally expected by the Lenape. Meanwhile, Logan preemptively negotiated with the powerful Iroquois Confederacy to allow for the treaty to take place. As a result, the Iroquois (nominally the diplomatic overlords and protectors of the Lenape people) rebuffed Lenape attempts to have the Iroquois intervene on their behalf. The net result of the Walking Treaty was an increase in the colony&#x27;s size of over 1,200,000 acres, the scattering of the Lenape in a regional diaspora, and the breakdown of diplomatic relations between Pennsylvania and the tribe.

=== Wealth and writings ===
Throughout his life in the Province of Pennsylvania, Logan engaged in various mercantile pursuits, especially fur trading, with such success that he became one of the wealthiest men in the Thirteen Colonies. Logan authored several scholarly papers published by the American Philosophical Society and European journals. Logan was also a natural scientist whose primary contribution to the emerging field of botany was a treatise that described experiments on the impregnation of plant seeds, especially corn. He tutored John Bartram, the American botanist, in Latin and introduced him to Linnaeus.

Logan&#x27;s daughter, Sarah, married Isaac Norris, a Philadelphia businessman and statesman.

==Death==
Logan died in 1751 in Stenton in the present-day Logan neighbourhood, named in Logan&#x27;s honour, in Philadelphia at the age of 77. He was interred in the graveyard of Arch Street Friends Meeting House, built in 1804, in Philadelphia.

== Colonial bibliophile ==

While Logan would eventually become mayor of Philadelphia, chief justice of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, lieutenant governor, and acting governor he is perhaps best known for being a bibliophile, confessing once that &quot;Books are my disease&quot;. He collected a personal library of over 3,000 volumes. Some commentators consider Logan&#x27;s library to have been the largest and best collection of classical writings in America at that time.

Logan would in time become known to Benjamin Franklin and his &quot;Junto&quot;; an influential group of friends that would meet weekly and discuss scholarly and political issues. He became a mentor to Franklin, who published Logan&#x27;s translation of Cicero&#x27;s essay &quot;Cato Maior de Senectute&quot;. Eventually, the Junto decided to establish a subscription library, a cooperative endeavour where members would pay a fee for use of the library. Franklin and the other members of the Junto considered Logan the &quot;best Judge of Books in these parts&quot; and chose him to select the first 43 titles for the Library Company of Philadelphia.

At the same time Logan was helping to build the collection for the Library Company of Philadelphia, he was adding to his own personal library which was considered substantial in number and breadth. He planned on donating his library for public use after his death and to this end he had a building constructed on Sixth Street in Philadelphia. Upon Logan&#x27;s death, and after a lengthy delay due to some confusion in his will, through an act of the Pennsylvania Assembly and the governor on March 31, 1792, the 3,953 volumes and other property of the Loganian Library were &quot;vested in the Library Company of Philadelphia, their successors and assigns, for ever, in trust for the support and increase of the said Loganian Library.&quot;

=== The Loganian Library ===

The Loganian Library, as he wished it to be called, was diverse. The catalogue of its final holdings is now lost but a partial inventory done in 1760 reveals a wide selection of books. The book distribution by date reveals nothing out of the ordinary. Most were from the seventeenth century with 57 percent. Next came those from the eighteenth century at 27 percent. Finally, there was a good number from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries at 16 percent. The collection was mostly British and northern European with 33 percent from Britain; the Netherlands, 24 percent; Germany, 17 percent; France, 13 percent; Switzerland, 9 percent; Italy, 2 percent; and others (Scandinavia, Spain, Poland, Russia, America) at 2 percent

The distribution of the books by subject in the 1760 catalogue is equally diverse with history, antiquities, geography, chronology, etc. at 22 percent. Religious subjects of divinity and ecclesiastical history constituted 15 percent. Scientific subjects such as &quot;physick,&quot; &quot;mathematicks&quot;, and natural history was at 16 percent. Literary subjects such as orators, poets, fables, romances, etc. at 14 percent with philology at 13 percent. Philosophy, surprisingly, was only 6 percent while arts, liberal and mechanical, &quot;magick,&quot; etc. was 3 percent. The remaining subjects were as follows: medicine, surgery, and &quot;chymistry,&quot; 2 percent; law, 2 percent; voyages and travels, 1 percent; philosophical history, 1 percent, and miscellaneous, 5 percent.

Logan&#x27;s library contained many 17th and 16th century classical works such as a 1615 edition of Archimedes&#x27; works, the mathematical treatise of Pappus of Alexandria printed in 1660, an Aratus of Soles from 1672, Elzevir&#x27;s architecture publication of 1649 from Amsterdam, Johann Vossius&#x27; &quot;De Quatuar Artibus Popularibus&quot; published in 1650, and a 1599 edition of astronomy edited by Barthelemy Pitiscus. In one famous episode, Logan was reading a treatise on early astronomy by Johann Fabricius and read that the first printed edition of Greek astronomer Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot; was printed in Greek in 1538. Logan was certain that it was released in an earlier Latin version, having sold it and his other books in Dublin before he left in 1699. Logan wrote Fabricius and politely explained his conviction. In reply, Fabricius reaffirmed his contention and sent his own 1538 copy as proof. Unconvinced, Logan wrote his agent in London, explaining that he had sold his library to a bookseller who lived on Castle Street and to see if he knew of the book&#x27;s location. His agent was successful in finding the book and sent to Logan where it was confirmed that it was a Latin edition of the &quot;Almagest&quot; published in 1515. Such was the strength of Logan&#x27;s bibliographic mind as professed by Benjamin Franklin.

==Legacy==
In Philadelphia, the Logan neighbourhood and the landmark Logan Circle are both named in honour of Logan. His 1730 estate Stenton in the Logan neighbourhood has been named a National Historic Landmark and operates as a public museum.

<text>Jean-François Marie de Surville (18 January 1717 – 8 April 1770) was a merchant captain with the French East India Company. He commanded a voyage of exploration to the Pacific in 1769–70.

Born in Brittany, France, Surville joined the French East India Company in 1727 at the age of 10. For the next several years he sailed on voyages in Indian and Chinese waters. In 1740 he joined the French Navy; he fought in the War of the Austrian Succession and the Seven Years&#x27; War, twice becoming a prisoner of war. After his military career he rejoined the French East India Company. In 1769, in command of &quot;Saint Jean-Baptiste&quot;, he sailed from India on an expedition to the Pacific looking for trading opportunities. He explored the seas around the Solomon Islands and New Zealand before proceeding eastward across the South Pacific towards South America. Part of his route around New Zealand overlapped that of James Cook in &quot;Endeavour&quot;, which had preceded him by only a few days. De Surville drowned off the coast of Peru on 8 April 1770 while seeking help for his scurvy-afflicted crew.

==Early life==
Born on 18 January 1717, Jean-François Marie de Surville was the son of Jean de Surville, a government official at Port-Louis, Brittany, and his wife, Françoise Mariteau de Roscadec, the daughter of a ship owner. One of nine children, Surville left home at the age of 10 and joined the French East India Company. There were existing family connections to the company; an older brother was already in its service and his mother was a niece of one of the company&#x27;s directors. Surville&#x27;s employer was a commercial enterprise supported by the French government and established several years previously to trade in the East Indies, and he sailed on trading voyages around India and China. By 1740 he held the rank of second ensign.

==Naval career==
Following the outbreak of the War of the Austrian Succession in 1740, Surville joined the French Navy, and fought in that conflict. He sailed aboard &quot;Hercule&quot; as an ensign and became a prisoner of war in 1745, when the ship was captured by the Royal Navy off Sumatra. After his release in 1746, he served aboard &quot;Duc de Chartres&quot;, which shipped goods from France to West Africa, where it collected slaves for transportation to the Caribbean, and then molasses from the Caribbean to France, a process known as triangular trade. In 1747, Surville was given command of &quot;Bagatelle&quot; and a letter of marque, which entitled him to sail as a privateer for France. While on one of his sorties on &quot;Bagatelle&quot;, he was again captured by the Royal Navy and taken to England as a prisoner of war.

Released in 1748, Surville returned to the French East India Company as a first lieutenant aboard &quot;Duc de Béthune&quot;, a 40-gun merchantman that traversed the trading route to China. Returning to France in 1750, he married Marie Jouaneaulx at Nantes. The couple had two sons, who later joined the French Army. He spent the next few years on trading voyages around the French ports in the Indian Ocean and during this time, acquired a farm on the island of Réunion.

By 1753, Surville was commander of &quot;Renommée&quot; and had made the acquaintance of Marion Dufresne, who would later become known for his voyages to the Pacific. During the Seven Years&#x27; War, which began in August 1756, Surville returned to active duty with the French Navy and sailed with the Comte d&#x27;Aché&#x27;s naval fleet in the Indian Ocean as commander of &quot;Duc de Orleans&quot;. He was looked upon favourably by his superiors for his seamanship and leadership, and was made an &quot;officer of the blue&quot;, a title used for non-aristocratic officers.

Surville was present at the Battle of Cuddalore in 1758 and was wounded the following year at the Battle of Pondicherry. He was awarded the Cross of Saint Louis for his conduct during the fighting. He ended the Seven Years&#x27; War as commander of &quot;La Fortuné&quot;, a 64-gun warship. While transporting soldiers back to France, he encountered bad weather off the coast of South Africa. The ship developed leaks and was wrecked near Cape Town. Surville was able to get all the crew and passengers safely to shore and on to Cape Town. This delayed his return to France until early 1764.

==French India==
Surville resumed service with the French East India Company in 1765 and later that year commanded &quot;Duc de Praslin&quot; on its voyage transporting the new governor of Pondicherry, Jean Law de Lauriston, to India. Afterwards, together with Lauriston and Jean-Baptiste Chevalier, the governor of Chandernagore – which, like Pondicherry, was a French settlement on the east coast of India – Surville set up a venture to pursue trading in the Indian Ocean. Returning to France in 1766, Surville gained the approval of the French East India Company for his commercial plans. Needing a ship for his venture, he supervised the construction of &quot;Saint Jean-Baptiste&quot;, a large merchantman armed with 36 guns, at Port-Louis. He sailed her to India in June 1767. Over the next several months, Surville made a series of trading voyages along the Indian coast. He also served as deputy governor of Pondicherry.

By late 1768, the French East India Company was undergoing severe financial difficulties, and its monopoly on trade in the East Indies was threatened with revocation. Surville and his business associates recognised that this would represent new opportunities for their syndicate and were planning a commercial expedition to the Philippines. At about this time, they became aware of rumours of a recent British discovery of land in the South Pacific, believed to be the fabulously wealthy island of Davis Land. These rumours were based on HMS &quot;Dolphin&quot;&#x27;s reports of Tahiti.

Davis Land represented a potentially important trading possibility for Surville&#x27;s syndicate, but it was also necessary to establish a French foothold in the South Pacific before the British did, lest they be locked out of the region. Consequently, it was decided that Surville would mount an expedition to the South Pacific. The plan was for Surville to sail &quot;Saint Jean-Baptiste&quot; to Malacca, and then on to the South China Sea and the Philippines. He was then to traverse the north and south latitudes of the Pacific, searching for Davis Land. The latter objective was to be kept secret, even from the officers of the expedition. On his return, Surville was to stop at Manila and Batavia. To avoid British suspicion as to the purpose of the expedition, the official destinations of the &quot;Saint Jean-Baptiste&quot; were Manila and Canton.

After more than two months of preparation, Surville departed from Chandernagore aboard &quot;Saint Jean-Baptiste&quot; on 3 March 1769, carrying a mixture of trading goods as cargo. These goods, if not able to be traded to the Jewish merchants believed to live on Davis Land, were to be sold at Manila on the expedition&#x27;s return voyage, to improve its profitability. Also on board were several charts and narratives of voyages to the Pacific, including an account of Abel Tasman&#x27;s 1642 journey to New Zealand. After visits to French settlements along the Indian coast to pick up provisions, Surville made his last stop at Pondicherry, where he added some grenadiers to the expedition&#x27;s complement. The expedition, now numbering 172 men, departed on 22 June 1769.

==Exploring the Pacific==

Surville sailed first to the Nicobar Islands to try to verify the presence of a Danish colony but encountered adverse winds by the time the islands were in sight. Rather than spend time maneuvering into a more favourable position for the wind, he proceeded to Malacca, arriving on 29 June 1769. An initially warm welcome from the Dutch governor soon cooled when another ship, a British vessel, arrived with allegations that the French were headed to the East Indies, where the Dutch had a monopoly. Surville promptly left, sailing to Terengganu on the Malay Peninsula and then to the islands of the Bashi Channel, between Taiwan and the Philippines, where he stocked up on water and food. Several of his crew deserted and, unable to locate them, Surville kidnapped some of the Bashi islanders as replacements for the missing men.

To the surprise of the majority of the expedition, Surville then sailed to the southeast, away from the ship&#x27;s official destination of Canton, in accordance with his secret instructions to locate Davis Land. Proceeding to the Solomon Islands, which had not been sighted by Europeans since their discovery in 1568, the expedition&#x27;s company began to suffer from scurvy. They reached the coast of Santa Isabel, in the Solomons, on 7 October 1769. At their first anchorage, which Surville named &quot;Port Praslin&quot;, they received a hostile reception. Hoping to find fresh food to help those afflicted with scurvy, a party went ashore but was attacked by the locals. Several French were wounded, one fatally, and over 35 islanders were killed. The expedition then tried for another anchorage, but were unable to conduct any trade or resupply their ship without being attacked by hostile islanders.

By this time, &quot;Saint Jean-Baptiste&quot; was short of fresh food and many of Surville&#x27;s crew had died from scurvy. Morale was low, not helped by the poor condition of the ship, which was leaking. Surville was forced to find a safe anchorage, but was unwilling to risk stopping at the Solomon Islands again. Instead, after consulting Tasman&#x27;s charts, in mid-November he headed for New Zealand. To avoid missing landfall due to errors in longitude, he first sailed southwest across the Coral Sea, before turning eastwards at the latitude of northern New Zealand. For much of his course to the south, he was roughly parallel with the coast of Australia and, before turning to the east, it is likely that he came close to reaching and discovering the coast of what is now New South Wales. Several birds were seen and his crew reported that they could smell land, but he continued with his change of course regardless.

===New Zealand===

On 12 December 1769 at 11:15 am, &quot;Saint Jean-Baptiste&quot; sighted the coast of New Zealand and sailed to just off Hokianga, on the west coast of the northern part of the North Island. Finding the shore inhospitable, Surville sailed northwards. On 16 December, the ship rounded North Cape and, heading south, passed through the area that James Cook&#x27;s &quot;Endeavour&quot; had traversed one or two days earlier. Surville and Cook were the first Europeans to navigate New Zealand waters since Abel Tasman&#x27;s voyage 127 years earlier.

Sailing down the east coast, Surville reached what he called &quot;Lauriston Bay&quot; on 17 December 1769. Cook had already named it &quot;Doubtless Bay&quot; when he sailed past it less than two weeks earlier. Māori in canoes went out to &quot;Saint Jean-Baptiste&quot; and engaged in some trading for fresh fish, allaying fears of the crew who were aware Tasman had experienced a hostile welcome on his arrival in New Zealand. Surville then took his ship deeper into the bay, anchoring late in the day off Tokerau Beach near Whatuwhiwhi.

Surville, along with some sailors and soldiers, went ashore the next day. The party was greeted by a Māori chief, who showed them to a source of water, and gave them cresses and celery. Over the next several days, the fresh food gathered or traded from the Māori helped the majority of the sick among the expedition to recover from their scurvy. It is likely that Father Paul-Antoine Léonard de Villefeix, the chaplain on &quot;Saint Jean-Baptiste&quot;, conducted the first Christian service in New Zealand and may have celebrated mass on Christmas Day 1769. If so, this would predate Reverend Samuel Marsden&#x27;s service of Christmas Day in 1814, generally held to be the first religious service in New Zealand.

Some actions of the French may have caused offence to the Māori. Surville attached a white ostrich feather to a chief&#x27;s head, considered highly &quot;tapu&quot;. The bodies of those who died from scurvy in the bay were thrown overboard, which would have contaminated the fishery, leading to the Māori (if they were aware) placing a &quot;rāhui&quot; or temporary prohibition on fishing in the area. The Māori may have been concerned about the amount of food that the French were taking and, in consequence, trading for fish and celery soon ceased. This led to a deterioration of relations between the French and Māori. Surville, having initially taken care to be as congenial as possible towards the Māori, was becoming increasingly frustrated.

On 27 December, a storm stranded a party of men on shore at Whatuwhiwhi, where they were treated hospitably by the Māori. In the same storm, the ship dragged her anchors, which had to be cut on Surville&#x27;s orders. He and part of the crew spent several hours trying to bring the &quot;Saint Jean-Baptiste&quot; to a more sheltered anchorage. The ship&#x27;s yawl, which was in tow, struck rocks and had to be cut free. After the storm passed, the stranded party returned to the ship, which had suffered a broken tiller. Surville, distressed by the loss of the anchors and the yawl, which jeopardised plans for further exploration of the area, went ashore with a party of two officers and some sailors to fish on 30 December. The party was invited to a village by a local chief and shared a meal before returning to the ship.

The following day, 31 December, an officer spotted the yawl ashore on Tokerau Beach surrounded by Māori, and an armed party set off from &quot;Saint Jean-Baptiste&quot; to retrieve it. Surville considered the yawl to have been stolen; by tradition, any flotsam washed ashore belonged to the chief of the area. Reaching the beach, the French party found a group of Māori carrying spears, but there was no sign of the yawl. Their chief, Ranginui, approached Surville carrying a twig of green leaves, a sign of peace in Māori culture. His patience exhausted, Surville arrested Ranginui for the theft of his yawl. His party burned about 30 huts, destroyed a canoe filled with nets, and confiscated another canoe. They brought Ranginui back to their ship, where the crew members who had been stranded during the storm identified him as the chief who had been hospitable to them. Surville was determined to keep his captive, and &quot;Saint Jean-Baptiste&quot; departed eastwards that day with Ranginui on board.

===Voyage to South America===
Surville, after having consulted with his officers and considering the poor condition of his ship and crew, rejected sailing north to the Philippines or the Dutch East Indies, and instead decided to sail eastwards for South America. This route took advantage of favourable winds, and offered the lucrative prospect of discovering previously unknown lands as they moved eastwards. Surville privately remained hopeful of locating Davis Land. The Spanish considered their ports along the Pacific coast of South America off limits to other nations and there was a risk the French would be imprisoned upon arrival. It was hoped that the existing alliance between France and Spain and an appeal on humanitarian grounds would avert that possibility.

Initially sailing along the southern latitudes of 34° and 35°, the expedition continued to suffer losses to scurvy, with the first death since departing New Zealand occurring on 19 February 1770. Surville soon turned his ship towards 27° south, the latitude on which Davis Land was believed to lie. Early the following month, with water supplies low, Surville conceded defeat in his quest for the island and set course for Peru after consulting with his officers. On 24 March, as the ship approached the Juan Fernández Islands, Ranginui died of scurvy. Although initially distressed at being kidnapped, he had been well treated and had regularly dined with Surville.

Rather than stop at the Juan Fernández Islands for supplies, Surville chose to continue to Peru, only away. &quot;Saint Jean-Baptiste&quot; reached the settlement of Chilca, on the Peruvian coast, on 7 April. An attempt to land a party was made that afternoon, but the sea conditions were too hazardous. The next day, Surville, in full ceremonial dress, and three crew members departed in a small boat to seek help from the Spanish viceroy at Chilca. In poor conditions, the boat capsized and Surville and two others were drowned. His body was found by locals and was buried at Chilca.

In the meantime, &quot;Saint Jean-Baptiste&quot; had been sailed north to the port of Callao, in accordance with Surville&#x27;s instructions in the event he not return to the ship. Surville&#x27;s uniform, Cross of Saint Louis, and a lock of his hair were handed over to Guillaume Labè, the ship&#x27;s first officer. The Spanish authorities impounded &quot;Saint Jean-Baptiste&quot; and detained her surviving crew for over two years before allowing them to return to France. On 20 August 1773, when the ship arrived at Port-Louis, only 66 of the original complement of 173 men had completed Surville&#x27;s expedition; 79 had died through sickness or attacks by hostile islanders, and another 28 had deserted. &quot;Saint Jean-Baptiste&quot; still carried the goods it had taken on board at Pondicherry, and these were sold to allow the expedition&#x27;s investors to recover some of their contributions. Surville&#x27;s widow was granted a pension by the King of France, Louis XV. She also received Surville&#x27;s possessions, handed over by Labè.

==Legacy==

Despite being commercially unsuccessful, Surville&#x27;s voyage allowed geographers of the time to confirm the size of the Solomon Islands and New Caledonia, and the likely non-existence of Davis Land. It provided further evidence that there was no &quot;Terra Australis&quot; to be found in the South Pacific, and also contributed more knowledge of New Zealand and its inhabitants. Surville and his men were the first Europeans to cross the Coral Sea and make a west–east traverse of the temperate zone of the South Pacific, an important route for future explorers in the area.

A street in Surville&#x27;s home town of Port-Louis is named for him. He is remembered in New Zealand through the naming of the Surville Cliffs, the northernmost point of mainland New Zealand. &quot;Cap Surville&quot; was the original name for what is now known as North Cape. A plaque commemorating Surville&#x27;s visit to the area 200 years earlier was laid at Whatuwhiwhi in 1969. Two of the anchors of &quot;Saint Jean-Baptiste&quot; that were lost at Doubtless Bay were discovered in 1974 and are displayed at the Far North Regional Museum at Kaitaia and the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa in Wellington respectively.

<doc id="1175257" wikidata="Q164054" url="?curid=1175257" title="Munich U-Bahn">
<text>The Munich U-Bahn () is an electric rail rapid transit network in Munich, Germany. The system began operation in 1971, and is operated by the municipally owned Münchner Verkehrsgesellschaft (MVG; Munich Transport Company). The network is integrated into the Münchner Verkehrs- und Tarifverbund (MVV; Munich Transport and Tariff Association) and interconnected with the Munich S-Bahn. The U-Bahn currently comprises eight lines, serving 96 stations (100 stations if four interchange stations with separate levels for different lines are counted twice), and encompassing of routes. 

Alongside the S-Bahn, the Munich subway is the most important means of local public transport in Munich. Since the opening of the first line on October 19, 1971, a network with 103.1 km of track and 96 stops has been built, to which the neighboring town of Garching near Munich is also connected and in future also the Planegg district of Martinsried (both in the district of Munich).

The Munich subway is operated by Münchner Verkehrsgesellschaft (MVG) and is integrated into the Munich Transport and Tariff Association (MVV). In 2019, it transported 429 million passengers.

== Current routes ==
Currently, there are eight lines.


The network has of active route, and 100 stations. In 2019, 429 million passengers rode the U-Bahn. The trains operate at speeds up to , which is the top speed among German U-Bahns. There is no continuous operation during the night (break from 1 to 4 am, 2 to 4 am on weekends) except on special occasions such as New Year&#x27;s Eve.

Currently, only the U6 line crosses the municipal border to the town of Garching.

Except for the lines U5 and U6, all lines operate completely below ground. U5 only comes above ground at the south terminus Neuperlach-Süd, U6 on the northern section from Studentenstadt (except Garching and Garching-Forschungszentrum stations and tunnels).

There are three &quot;line families&quot;, which each consist of two lines (not counting peak hour lines) that share a common track in the city centre. The schedules of these lines are coordinated to produce regular train intervals on the common section.

Most stations have two tracks with an island platform between them. Of the single-line stations, only the stations Olympia-Einkaufszentrum (U1), Richard-Strauss-Straße (U4), Neuperlach Süd (U5), Garching-Hochbrück and Nordfriedhof (both U6) have side platforms.

At the junction stations Scheidplatz and Innsbrucker Ring, the four tracks run in parallel on the same level, with two island platforms allowing cross-platform interchange. The stations Hauptbahnhof (lower level), where U1 and U2 branch into two different lines and Münchner Freiheit (U3/U6) also have four tracks, while Implerstraße (U3/U6), Max-Weber-Platz (U4/U5) and Kolumbusplatz (U1/U2) have three: one with a side platform for outbound trains and two with a shared island platform for inbound trains.

Olympiazentrum, Fröttmaning and Kieferngarten also have four tracks each, the first due to the proximity of the Olympic Stadium, the others to support both traffic directed to the technical base and depot in Fröttmaning, and passengers attending the Allianz Arena football stadium.

At Hauptbahnhof, there is a second U-Bahn station for lines U4/5 at a higher level, giving a total of six U-Bahn tracks. Sendlinger Tor, Odeonsplatz and Olympia-Einkaufszentrum also each have two quite separate stations at different levels, connected with each other by escalators and elevators.

=== Frequency and scheduling ===
Most lines operate with trains running at intervals of every 5 minutes during peak hours, but due to lines overlapping, trains can be as frequent as every 2 minutes. Outside of peak times lines operate trains at frequencies of every 10 minutes; however, around the start of operations and after midnight the line frequency decreases to every 20 minutes or more on most lines. Again with line overlap this means that a suitable train will arrive (often much) more frequently.

=== U1 ===


In 1980 the U1 commenced operation together with the U8 (now U2). At the beginning it was only operating on a section of U2&#x27;s track. When the branch to Rotkreuzplatz was opened, it became a separate line. The line&#x27;s colour is green.

Today the U1 has a length of and 15 stations. It starts at Olympia-Einkaufszentrum in the district of Moosach. The U3 was extended to the same station (but on a different level) in 2007. On the way south it follows Hanauer Straße to Georg-Brauchle-Ring, which has been designed by Franz Ackermann, reaching Westfriedhof. It continues via Gern to Rotkreuzplatz, which was its terminus from 1983 to 1998. Below Nymphenburger Straße it goes on to Maillingerstraße and Stiglmaierplatz and finally merges into the U2 track at München Hauptbahnhof.

On the busy city section, U1 and U2 run with a 5-minute offset, yielding 5 minute intervals even beyond peak hours. At Central Station, it also crosses the S-Bahn and U4/U5. At the next station, Sendlinger Tor, it passes below U3/U6. There the U1/U2 platforms for each direction lie in tunnels which are apart from each other and are connected by a pedestrian tunnel.

Fraunhoferstraße, the next station, is also reached in separate tunnels, which had to be excavated using tunneling shields due to the proximity of the River Isar. However, the two tubes are connected by the platform, which demanded large pillars that are characteristic for this station. The next station, Kolumbusplatz, is a junction which has three tracks. Here the U1 branches off the U2 again.

The southbound branch line was opened in 1997 and traverses the colourful station Candidplatz, eventually reaching Wettersteinplatz. The following station, St.-Quirin-Platz has an extraordinary architecture, as it is covered by a large, shell-like structure made from glass and steel, which is drawn nearly down to track level on one side. The U1 terminates at Mangfallplatz below Naupliastraße.

=== U2 ===

The route of the U2 line has undergone more changes than any of the other Munich underground lines. It also changed its name as it was first called U8. It is the only line that runs or ran on all three &quot;line families&quot; (U1/U2, U3/U6 and U4/U5). Today it has a length of and 27 stations. The line&#x27;s colour is red.

The U2 starts in the north at Feldmoching, where it connects to the S1 to Freising/Airport. The station there is decorated with rural and urban motives of Feldmoching&#x27;s history. Below Hasenbergl, a district which had been known for its social problems, it goes to Dülferstraße, which provides access to the eastern Hasenbergl and a newly built area on Panzerwiese. Dülferstraße was the terminus from 1993 till 1996.

Via the stations Harthof and Am Hart, the U2 reaches Frankfurter Ring. In the tunnel between Am Hart and Frankfurter Ring, there is a white and blue wave pattern, which is the only installation of art in a Munich U-Bahn tunnel outside of stations.

After Milbertshofen station the U2 touches the U3 line at Scheidplatz, where cross-platform interchange is possible. Before the opening of the section to Dülferstraße in 1993, U2 went from Scheidplatz to Olympiazentrum, sharing the track with the U3. Through the district of Maxvorstadt the U2 continues to downtown Munich, reaching the stations Hohenzollernplatz, Josephsplatz, Theresienstraße und Königsplatz. At Königsplatz one can find artworks from the nearby Glyptothek on the platform.

At München Hauptbahnhof (Munich Central Station), the U2 meets the U1, with which it shares tracks until Kolumbusplatz (see above).

After Kolumbusplatz the U2 continues eastward and reaches the stations Silberhornstraße, Untersbergstraße and Giesing station, with an interchange possibility to S3 and S7. The next stations are Karl-Preis-Platz and Innsbrucker Ring, where cross-platform interchange to the U5 is possible. Until 1999, when the branch to the Messestadt stations was opened, the U2 ran from here to Neuperlach.

Via the stations Josephsburg and Kreillerstraße the U2 reaches Trudering, which features two platforms in separate tunnels, connected by two transversal tunnels. In 1994, during the construction of this section, an accident happened: the ceiling of the new tunnel collapsed due to the intrusion of water and a bus fell into the crater. Two passengers and one construction worker died and the construction was delayed.

Via Moosfeld, the U2 reaches Messestadt West and its terminus Messestadt Ost. These stations are located between the fairgrounds (Messestadt) in the north and a development area and the Bundesgartenschau 2005 in the south.

=== U3 ===

The U3 is the original Olympic line; the first section was opened for the Olympic Summer Games 1972. Today the line has a total of length of and 25 stations. The line&#x27;s colour is orange.

Today the U3 starts in the north at Moosach, Munich&#x27;s 100th U-Bahn station, where passengers can change to the S1 to Freising/Airport. From here the line runs east to Moosacher St.-Martins-Platz and Olympia-Einkaufszentrum, where a change to the U1 is possible. After passing through Oberwiesenfeld station, the U3 reaches its original northern terminus at Olympiazentrum. From 1972 until 2010, this station was the end of the original Olympic line.

When Munich was awarded the Olympic Summer Games 1972 in 1965, the U-Bahn network concept (which was adopted only one year earlier) had to be revised to speed up the construction of a connection to the Olympic venues at Olympic grounds. The Olympic connector (now U3) was redesigned as a branch of the U6 line, because the original plan of a direct connection to the Olympic ground from Munich Central Station was not feasible in the new timeframe. This original U3 sections consists of four stations (from north to south): Olympiazentrum, Petuelring, Scheidplatz, where cross-platform interchange to the U2 (the line originally supposed to serve the Olympic venues) is possible since 1980, and Bonner Platz. After Bonner Platz the U3 reaches Münchner Freiheit, where it joins the U6 to run together through the inner city section to Implerstraße (for this section see U6 below).

After leaving the three-track junction station Implerstraße, where the U6 heads west towards Harras before ending up in Großhadern suburb, the U3 reaches Brudermühlstraße (near the picturesque Flaucher section of the Isar river), Thalkirchen (Zoo) (a short walk from the large city zoo) and Obersendling, which is built higher than the Thalkirchen station, because it is located on the &quot;Hochufer&quot; (western tread) of the River Isar. Here, interchange to the S-Bahn at Siemenswerke station is possible. The U3 continues west via Aidenbachstraße and Machtlfinger Straße, before reaching Forstenrieder Allee, Basler Straße, and eventually the terminus Fürstenried West. This southern-eastern section was opened on 28 October 1989, as can be seen from huge date numbers on the western entrance of Obersendling station.

=== U4 ===

With only and 13 stations, the U4 is Munich&#x27;s shortest U-Bahn line. This line has originally been planned as U9 and is the only line that operates regularly with 4-car sets rather than the full 6-car set. The exceptions are Fridays in the late afternoon and during the Oktoberfest. The line&#x27;s colour is mint green.

The U4 begins in the west in the Laim neighbourhood at Westendstraße station, which it shares with the U5 line. Both U4 and U5 are the only lines of a joint line &quot;family&quot;, which only branch out on one end of the common line, as an originally planned western extension of the U4 was first put on hold and was subsequently cancelled altogether.

From Westendstraße the U4 runs east to Heimeranplatz, which connects to S7 and S20 S-Bahn lines. The next two stations, Schwanthalerhöhe (originally called Messegelände, the German for &quot;exhibition grounds&quot;; the name was changed when the exhibition centre relocated to Riem in 1998) and Theresienwiese, are gateways to the Oktoberfest, and are therefore highly loaded during this event. Between both aforementioned stations, there is a track that links to Implerstraße to provide a connection to the depot in Fröttmaning.

Theresienwiese is one of only two U-Bahn stations in Munich (besides Fröttmaning station which serves Allianz Arena) to have the command centre booth opened during the Oktoberfest for supervising the masses of passengers. The southern exit of the station leads to the northern entrance of Oktoberfest. U4 trains arriving from the east often terminate at Theresienwiese rather than continue to Westendstraße even during peak hours due to low traffic volume east of Hauptbahnhof.

After Theresienwiese the U4 reaches München Hauptbahnhof (Munich Central Station); passengers can transfer to U1/U2 lines as well as to all S-Bahn lines (except S20) here. The next station is Karlsplatz (Stachus) with shorter and easier connections to S-Bahn (S1 to S8). Karlsplatz is the deepest station in Munich&#x27;s U-Bahn network ( below the surface). From this point on, the U4 runs north of the S-Bahn cross-city tunnel.

After passing Odeonsplatz, where an interchange to U3/U6 trains is possible, and Lehel, the U4 crosses the River Isar in a tunnel, and reaches Max-Weber-Platz, the last station that is shared with the U5. Here, the U4 branches off to the north, while the U5 runs south.

Before terminating at Arabellapark, the U4 passes the stations Prinzregentenplatz, Böhmerwaldplatz, and Richard-Strauss-Straße, the latter being the only station of the line to be equipped with side platforms instead of an island platform.

The original plan called for an extension to Johanneskirchen station (where easy transfer to the S8 S-Bahn line would be possible) via Fideliopark, but was never built, due to low current ridership in the area north of Max-Weber-Platz. The extension of the tram line in the area in 2011 made the plan even more unlikely to materialise. A possible extension in the west to Blumenau is even more improbable.

In the evenings from around 20.40 to the close of operations, the U4 only operates between Odeonsplatz and Arabellapark.

=== U5 ===
The U5 currently begins at Laimer Platz; an extension to is under construction. The total length currently is . The line&#x27;s colour is brown.

Via Friedenheimer Straße, the U5 reaches Westendstraße. From there, the U5 shares the tracks with the U4 to Max-Weber-Platz (see above).

At Max-Weber-Platz, the U5 branches off to the south to Ostbahnhof (East Station), where changing to all S-Bahn lines is possible. The next station, Innsbrucker Ring, allows cross-platform interchange to the U2.

The U5 continues south to Michaelibad, Quiddestraße, and Neuperlach Zentrum, which is the centre of the satellite town of Neuperlach, built during the 1960s and 1970s. Going on to Therese-Giehse-Allee, the U5 comes above ground and reaches its terminus Neuperlach Süd, where it allows cross-platform interchange with S-Bahn line S7. South-east of Neuperlach-Süd is a large parking yard (Betriebsanlage Süd) used to park trains which can&#x27;t be parked at the technical base in Fröttmaning or within the network.

=== U6 ===

The U6 is the oldest U-Bahn line of the network and also features the oldest tunnel built: the section below the Lindwurmstraße (between Sendlinger Tor and including the station Goetheplatz) was already built 1938-1941 as part of a planned S-Bahn network. For this reason Goetheplatz has a platform longer than the standard . Today the line has a length of . Its colour is blue.

Since 2006 the northern terminus of the U6 is Garching-Forschungszentrum; via Garching it reaches Garching-Hochbrück. These three stations are outside the city limits of Munich in the city of Garching.

The distance of to the next station at Fröttmaning is the longest distance between two stations in Munich&#x27;s U-Bahn network. Fröttmaning has been expanded to two island platforms and four tracks to cater for the Allianz Arena football stadium, built for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. The technical base of the U-Bahn is located at Fröttmaning, too. After passing Kieferngarten station, which has two island platforms as well, it crosses over a rail bridge to Freimann and Studentenstadt. Between these two stations is a connection to mainline railway tracks, which is used to bring new trains into the network. The bridge was originally used by the tram and was the only tram track to be converted to be part of the U-Bahn network. The U6 then continues underground for the rest of its way south.

Via Alte Heide, Nordfriedhof (station with side platforms), and Dietlindenstraße, the U6 reaches Münchner Freiheit, where it joins the U3 on the shared inner city tunnel.

Passing Giselastraße and Universität (University), it arrives at Odeonsplatz, where it connects to the U4/U5 lines. Continuing to Marienplatz, it crosses the S-Bahn lines. During peak hours this station is can get overcrowded, which is why additional pedestrian tunnels were built between 2003 and 2006.

At Sendlinger Tor the U3/U6 crosses the U1/U2 line, and interchange is possible. The line now uses the tunnel built in 1941 mentioned above as far as Goetheplatz. The next station, Poccistraße was added belatedly, constructed between the two existing tunnels which stayed operational. At Implerstraße the U3 and U6 separate again. To the north of the station, facing north, there is a branch to the U4/U5 at Schwanthalerhöhe, which is not used for passenger transport.

At Harras the U6 connects to the S-Bahn lines S7 and S20, and to regional trains to the south. The section via Partnachplatz and Westpark to Holzapfelkreuth was constructed for the Internationale Gartenbauausstellung (IGA) in 1983 was therefore dubbed &quot;flower line&quot;, which is reflected in the design of these stations. Passing Haderner Stern and Großhadern, the U6 reaches its current southern terminus at Klinikum Großhadern, where the entrance to the station is covered by a glass pyramid.

An extension to Martinsried, which is only approx. west of the current terminus, is under construction, and is supposed to open in 2026.

=== U7 ===
This booster line (it only operates during rush hours) was added in December 2011 along with the new tram extension to St. Emmeram. The U7 runs between Olympia-Einkaufszentrum and Neuperlach Zentrum via München Hauptbahnhof and Innsbrucker Ring: it shares the tracks with the U1 from Olympia-Einkaufszentrum to Kolumbusplatz, the U2 from München Hauptbahnhof to Innsbrucker Ring, and the U5 from Innsbrucker Ring to its southern terminus Neuperlach Zentrum.

=== U8 ===
This booster line started operations in December 2013. It only operates on Saturday afternoons. The U8 begins in the north at Olympiazentrum and shares the tracks with the U3 as far as Scheidplatz, where it continues along the U2 tracks to Innsbrucker Ring and terminates at Neuperlach Zentrum. It is only running on Saturdays to ease crowding on the U2 and U3 lines, and to provide people an easier access to the Olympic Park from Munich Central Station.

== Rolling stock ==
Munich U-Bahn uses three different generations of electric multiple unit trains. The stock of over 550 carriages is shared between all lines.

=== Class A ===

Class A trains were built between 1967 (prototypes) and 1983. The units consist of two carriages, which always remain coupled in normal operation. The double-carriage units have a length of , a height of , and a width of . Each unit has three doors per side and a capacity of 98 seats and standing room for 192 passengers.
A total of 193 double-carriage units were delivered, of which 179 are still in use in Munich. Up to three A two-carriage units can be coupled together to form a 3/3 train (Langzug).

=== Class B ===

Class B trains were built between 1981 and 1994 to provide more stock to service the growing network in the 1980s. As with the class A trains, six prototypes were ordered. However, it took six years until the series production started and the prototypes had to be modified to match the series-production units. B units have the same size as A units but differ in the design (especially of the front window) and use three-phase current instead of direct current motors. The other difference is the door opening mechanism. On B units, the passengers only need to pull just one handle to open both door leaves rather than both handles as on A units. Of a total of 63 units, 57 are still in service (including one prototype), and six have been scrapped.
As with A trains, up to three B double-carriage units can form a 3/3 train (Langzug). However, it is not possible to form a mixed train of A and B units, which are not compatible.

=== Class C ===

Class C trains were designed in the late 1990s to gradually replace the Class A trains, which become more expensive to operate and maintain. Class C1 trains are six carriages attached together in one continuous length with gangways between the carriages, allowing the passengers to walk from one end to other. Ten trains, designated as C1.9 (Wagon No. 601–610), were ordered and delivered without prototype trains for evaluation. The technical difficulties delayed the entry into service to 2002. Eight more units, designated as C1.10 (Wagon No. 611–618), were delivered in 2005 prior to the 2006 FIFA World Cup. The total number of C1 trains in operation is 18.

A second generation, designated as Class C2, were ordered from Siemens Mobility in November 2010. They are based on new Siemens Inspiro subway trains. The first delivery of 21 units (C2.11) began in 2012 but was delayed until 2018 due to the technical defects and changes in federal and state regulations. The second order for 22 units (C2.12) was announced in 2019 with delivery commencing in 2020 and continuing until 2022. The third order for 24 units (C2.13) was placed in May 2020 for the delivery from 2022 to 2024. The total number of C2 trains in operation and under construction is 67.

=== Operation ===
MVG has made lot of effort in the last few years to increase the frequency for trains on the busier lines (U1/U2/U7 and U3/U6) to five minutes between trains and to ten minutes on less busy lines (U4 and U8). The busier lines (U1/U2/U7/U8 and U3/U6) have &quot;Langzug&quot; (3 Class A/Class B trains or 1 Class C1/C2 trains). &quot;Kurzzug&quot; (short train) with 1 or 2 Class A/Class B trains are operated on less busy lines (U4/U5) or during less busy times in the evenings or weekends. During the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the &quot;Kurzzug&quot; has been temporarily removed from the service.

U3/U6 lines on shared tracks within city boundary has a notorious reputation of frequent service interruptions due to unanticipated technical issues, overcrowding, and passengers requiring medical attention or falling into the tracks at the stations. Additionally, U3/U6 lines receive frequent maintenance and track replacements due to heavier than anticipated passenger load. This necessitates the planning of new U9 line as to reduce the burden on U3/U6 line.

No 24-hour service is offered due to the nightly maintenance. Instead, the night buses are used.

== History ==
Already in 1905 there were plans to build an underground metro in about the route of today&#x27;s trunk line of the S-Bahn between the main and Ostbahnhof and a ring road that surrounds the old town. Since these plans for the then traffic were clearly oversized, they came back into oblivion. The tram network was able to cover the traffic flows in the former half-million city. From 1910, the only 450 m long, automated Munich subway metro connected the main station with the post office on Hopfenstraße. It served only for the transport of letter post. In 1928 there were again plans to replace the trams in Munich by a subway network, but any such plans for this were thwarted the global economic crisis. A network of five subway routes, which had some similarities with today&#x27;s route distribution, was to be realized.

At the time of Nazi Germany, from 1936, a network of electric subterranean railways was planned for the &quot;capital of the movement&quot; and construction was begun, but the Second World War put an end to this. The tunnel of today&#x27;s U6 between Sendlinger Tor and Goetheplatz - including the station there - were already completed in the shell, but still as part of a rapid-transit railway route. This also explains the relative generosity of Goetheplatz (especially in the blockade entrance Goetheplatz does not fit the architecture today) and the narrowness of the present interchange station Sendlinger Tor on the platform U3 / U6. In the Lindwurmstraße took place on 22 May 1938, the groundbreaking ceremony for this tunnel, which should herald the beginning of the end of the tram. By 1941, the shell was completed, first railcars were to be delivered in the same year. The war-related scarcity of resources led to the cessation of this work. The shell was used during the war as an air-raid shelter, of which today still bears inscriptions on the tunnel walls.

Parts of the tunnel were filled with debris after the war, others served for a while as a breeding ground for mushrooms, before penetrating groundwater made the short piece of early metro history unusable. The Nazis forbade the acquisition of new rolling stock for the Munich tramways in order to show how &quot;insufficient&quot; the tram system was. At that time, trams were the primary means of public transportation in Munich. The Nazis made ambitious plans to change Munich into their &quot;Reichshauptstadt der Bewegung&quot; (Capital of the movement; the Nazi party had come to existence in Munich). This included the construction of an underground system. In the late 1930s, construction started in Lindwurmstraße and Sonnenstraße, where Munich&#x27;s main Lutheran-Protestant church, Matthäuskirche, was torn down because it was supposedly a &quot;traffic obstacle&quot; (so was the Munich&#x27;s main synagogue not far away as well as the tower of the Old Town Hall). Construction was abandoned in 1941 as World War II intensified. After the war, the priority was to reconstruct the badly-damaged tram system.

However, even during the 1950s the Munich City Council discussed plans to run a few of the tram lines underground because the capacity for surface traffic was overstretched. It planned four diameter lines (designation A, B, C, D), which divided the city into eight sectors and contained essential elements of today&#x27;s network of lines. An east-west line &quot;A&quot;: Pasing - Laim - Westend - Stachus (change in line &quot;B&quot;) - Marienplatz (change in line &quot;C&quot;) - Ostbahnhof - Berg-am-Laim. Another line &quot;B&quot;: Moosach - Gern - Rotkreuzplatz - Stiglmaierplatz - Stachus (change in line &quot;A&quot;) - Odeonsplatz - Max Weber Square - Bogenhausen - Zamdorf - Riem. A north-south line &quot;C&quot; was along Freimann - Münchner-Freiheit - Marienplatz (change in line &quot;A&quot;) - Goetheplatz (already built 1938-1941 interchange station to the line &quot;D&quot;) - Harras - Waldfriedhof planned. A north-south line &quot;D&quot; with the lines: Settlement am Hart - Scheidplatz - Elisabethplatz - Central Station - Goetheplatz (change to line &quot;C&quot;) - Giesing.

In 1964 plans were, however, changed and it was decided to build a &quot;real&quot; underground network as follows:

*U1: Moosach Bf – (Dachauer Str.) – Hbf – Goetheplatz – Kolumbusplatz – Giesing Bf – Neuperlach Zentrum 
*U2: Amalienburgstr. – Rotkreuzplatz – Hbf – Goetheplatz – Kolumbusplatz – KH Harlaching – Großhesseloher Brücke 
*U3: Heidemannstr. – Scheidplatz – Münchener Freiheit – Marienplatz – Goetheplatz – Fürstenrieder Straße – Blumenau 
*U4: Pasing – Laimer Pl. – Heimeranplatz – Hbf – Theatinerstr. (Marienplatz Nord) – Max-Weber-Pl. – Arabellapark – St. Emmeram 
*U5: Pasing – like U4 – Max-Weber-Pl. – Leuchtenbergring – St.-Veit-Str. – Waldtrudering 
*U6: Kieferngarten – Münchner Freiheit – Marienplatz – Goetheplatz – Harras – Waldfriedhof – Großhadern 
*U8: Hasenbergl – Am Hart – Scheidplatz – Theresienstr. – Karlsplatz (Stachus) – Sendlinger Tor (4. Stammstrecke) – Kapuzinerstr. (Kreuzungsbf mit U1/2) – Thalkirchen – Aidenbachstr. – Fürstenried West

Calls for a ring line of the subway were soon rejected, as this was the tangential passenger volume was too low, but you took in the construction of the S-Bahn trunk line at Rosenheimer Platz station consideration that should not be built the possibility of a crossing station here. Today, the tram takes on the most tangential traffic flows, the concept of a ring metro has been adopted.

Work started on 1 February 1965 at Nordfriedhof (North Cemetery) in Ungererstraße (now known as Schenkendorfstraße). Today a steel girder at the first building site is a monument to Munich&#x27;s first underground railway. When the 1972 Summer Olympics were awarded to Munich in 1966, construction had to be sped up to get the &quot;Olympic&quot; line finished on time. On 19 October 1971 the first line commenced operations between Kieferngarten and Goetheplatz with a total length of . On 8 May 1972 the line between Münchner Freiheit and Olympiazentrum (&quot;Olympic line&quot;) to the venues of the Olympic Summer Games 1972 was opened, just 10 days after the Munich S-Bahn commenced operations. To satisfy demand during the Games, some DT1 trains were borrowed from Nuremberg. On 22 November 1975 the extension from Goetheplatz to Harras was opened. The network has been expanded continuously since 1980.

The activities of the U3 and U1 should be extended on a case-by-case. The beginning of the extension of U1, from Westfriedhof to Georg-Brauchle-Ring, opened on 18 October 2003, whereas another station, Olympia-Einkaufszentrum was later opened on 31 October 2004. Similarly, on 28 October 2007, the new era had resulted in U3, extending from Olympiazentrum, via Oberwiesenfield, to the Olympia-Einkaufszentrum, and later on it was extended to Moosach on 11 December 2010. This is a similar concept to the fictional U3 extension, which was achieved in 2007 and 2010 respectively.

The new Allianz Arena (football stadium) required a larger capacity of the nearby U-Bahn station at Fröttmaning. A new second platform was built and the whole station was moved north by roughly 100 metres (330 ft). For easy access to the platform, a second pedestrian bridge was built at the north end of the platforms. At the same year, U6 was extended on 14 October 2006 from Garching-Hochbrück to Garching-Forschungszentrum via Garching. This is a similar concept to the fictional U1 extension, where it had needed a new series of trains.

=== Timeline ===
== Future expansions ==
=== Extensions under construction ===
==== U5 (west) – extension to Pasing Bahnhof ====
The Laimer Platz-Pasing extension has been approved on 14 July 2015 as to relieve the overburdened tram and bus routes serving the area between Laimer Platz and Pasing neighbourhoods. In case of S-Bahn disruption between Pasing Bahnhof and Ostbahnhof via Hauptbahnhof, the U5 can supplement the connection between both stations. The construction is to commenced in 2022 at cost of 547 million euros and is planned to open in the early 2030s. Two new subway stations are Willibaldplatz and Am Knie. When completed, U5 will be the only subway line in Munich to connect Hauptbahnhof with both west (Pasing) and east (Ostbahnhof) termini that provide regional and long-distance train services.

==== U5 (west) – new station in Freiham ====

The residents called for the further extension of U5 to Freiham from Pasing Bahnhof. MVG initially rejected the proposal due to higher cost and two S-Bahn lines already serving the northern and southern areas of Freiham. Extending the tram line from Pasing Bahnhof to Freiham was considered as a cheaper alternative. On 17 July 2015, the citizen initiative and petition drive took place, supported by Christian Social Union (CSU) and Social Democratic Party (SPD) to extend U5 line further to Freiham. In January 2019, the city council passed the resolution to proceed with the further extension of U5 to Freiham. Due to the anticipated population growth, the subway line is more preferable than tram line in keeping up with the increasing demand. Additionally, the western terminus is to be located in Freiham city centre, serving the suburban town better than two S-Bahn lines in north and south.

On 26 January 2020, the city council approved the plan to extend the U5 further to Freiham with the construction commencing at the same time as the construction of Pasing Bahnhof subway station in 2021. The 750 million euros Pasing Bahnhof-Freiham extension is 4.5 kilometres long and has four new stations: Westkreuz, Radolfzeller Straße, Riesenburgstraße, and Freiham Zentrum. The date of completion is anticipated to be in 2035–2040.

On 28 July 2020, the administrative district of Oberbayern has approved the route alignment and construction plan for the second segment between the future subway stations Willibaldstraße and Am Knie. The second segment is routed from Willibaldstraße U-Bahnhof between Landsberger Straße and Agnes-Bernauer-Straße toward the two popular swimming, recreational, and sport centres (Westbad Hallenbad and Eis- und Funsportzentrums West). Am Knie U-Bahnhof will be located very close to the centres for quick and easy access.

Groundbreaking ceremony for the retention structure of the Freiham Zentrum station took place on 28 May 2024. Due to the construction taking place in an empty field, it won&#x27;t require intervention into existing infrastructure, which will save around 50 million euros in building cost. The retention structure is planned to be finished by 2027. The 4.7 km long connection to Pasing via three stations (Riesenburgstraße, Radolfzeller Straße and Westkreuz) is expected in the 2040s.

==== U6 (south) – extension to Martinsried ====
This extension will serve a large biotech centre at Martinsried. The estimated cost in 2012 was €73.3 million: since the extension crosses the municipality boundary of Munich, the large percentage of funding (95%) comes from Free State of Bavaria while Planegg and Munich contributed smaller percentages. The planning was approved in 2013, and the anticipated completion date was 2014–2015. However, the extension must go through the contaminated area and former gravel pit later filled in, leading to the complications and delays in planning.

The parking garage at Martinsried station is being constructed now and to be completed at the end of 2021. The construction of the subway tunnel began in February 
2023 with anticipated completion in 2026.

=== Planned extensions ===
==== U4 (east) – extension to Englschalking Bahnhof ====

This extension is considered in the third medium-term planning (Mittelfristprogramm) along with the plan of moving a portion of S8 line from surface to underground between Unterföhring and Leuchtenbergring stations. Whether the extension would be approved and when will it be built is not clear. The stations are Cosimapark, Fideliopark, and Englschalking, all of which are in Bogenhausen.

==== U3 (west) – extension to Untermenzing ====
This extension is planned after the U3 has been extended to Moosach, and it will go via Waldhornstraße.

==== U5 (south) – extension to Taufkirchen ====
After the success of citizen initiative to extend the U5 West to Pasing and then to Freiham, the state parliament is exploring the extension south of Neuperlach Süd station to Taufkirchen. The extension would serve several important large-scale industries (including Ludwig-Bölkow-Systemtechnik and Airbus Defence and Space), the Bundeswehr University Munich, the Technical University of Munich Department of Aerospace and Geodesy, and suburban towns (Neubiberg, Ottobrunn, and Taufkirchen).

The six-kilometre extension with four new stations is estimated to cost 300-400 million Euros, and the exact route hasn&#x27;t been determined yet. Due to the cost factor, the extension would be built above ground since the tunnel costs approximately €80 million per kilometre. The Bavarian minister president, Markus Söder, is pushing for the large portion of federal funding, following the recent change in the outdated federal law, Gemeindeverkehrsfinanzierungsgesetz (Municipal Transportation Finances Act), to address the issues with cost factor analysis for the suburban regions and beyond.

No construction or completion date is given yet.

=== Abandoned extension plans ===
==== U1 (south) – extension to Harlaching Hospital via Laurinplatz ====
Although the plans for this extension were quite advanced, low passenger forecasts have led to its abandonment in favour of a tram or light rail from Schwanseestraße. But in 2015 and 2016, it was also announced that it will be extended to Solln.

==== U1 (north) – extension to Feldmoching ====
With this extension, the U1 line would terminate at S-Bahn and U2 subway stations in Feldmoching. The subway station, Olympia-Einkaufszentrum, would be renamed as the Northern Cross. The extension is to connect with U2 line at current Hasenbergl subway station then continue to their terminus in Feldmoching. This plan was abandoned.

==== U2 (north) – extension to Karlsfeld ====
The city council of Bündnis 90 / Die Grünen and the CSU faction in the town council of Karlsfeld proposed the above-ground extension of the U2 from Feldmoching to Karlsfeld as a measure to relieve the municipality of the heavy car traffic. Moreover, this should provide a greater incentive for the employees of the large companies MAN and MTU to use public transport for their work. After initial investigations had shown a low cost-benefit ratio for this route, it was not cost-effective and was abandoned.

==== U6 (north) – extension to Munich Airport ====
This would be only U-Bahn line with direct access to the Munich Airport. At Hallbergmoos station, U6 would continue in parallel with S8 line to the airport and stop at both terminals before travelling further to Eching and Neufahrn. However, the plan was abandoned.

=== U9 and U29 bypass lines ===

On 11 February 2014, SWM/MVG announced a detailed report for the construction of a new 10.5 km bypass line, a sixth intracity underground line, to be called the U9. The new line will relieve the overburdened U1/U2/U7/U8 and U3/U6 lines, especially the transfer stations at Sendlinger Tor (U1/U2/U7/U8 and U3/U6), Hauptbahnhof (U1/U2/U7/U8, U4/U5, and S-Bahn), and Odeonsplatz (U3/U6 and U4/U5), and will shorten the travel time between the Hauptbahnhof and the Allianz Arena by removing the need to transfer at Marienplatz or Odeonsplatz. MVG is predicting tremendous growth of passenger traffic in the northern section of Munich in the next twenty years and wants to plan accordingly.

The proposal was revised and approved in January 2018 to integrate the three major construction projects at Hauptbahnhof: the second S-Bahn tunnel and station, a new dedicated U9 platform, and the reconstruction of Hauptbahnhof. On 2 July 2019, funding for the U9 construction was approved, with most of the €3.5 billion to be provided by the federal government. The confirmed completion date is 2038 at latest.

The revised plan eliminates U6 service between Implerstraße and Münchner Freiheit to relieve the overburdened U3 and reduce the heavy congestion at Sendlinger Tor and Odeonplatz when transferring between lines during rush hour. The U9 takes over the current U6&#x27;s southwestern (Klinikum Großhadern – Implerstraße) and northeastern (Münchner Freiheit – Garching-Forschungszentrum) extensions. The new stations would be Martinsried (a new extension west of Klinikum Großhadern), Esperantoplatz, Hauptbahnhof (dedicated platform), Pinakotheken, and Elisabethplatz. At Münchner Freiheit, the U9 is connected to the current U6 tracks to continue to its northeastern terminus at Garching-Forschungszentrum. A further plan to add a second spur to connect with the U2 line at Theresienstraße is planned. The second spur would be called U29: Klinikum-Großhadern – Hauptbahnhof – Theresienstraße – Harthof. This plan would extend the current U6 southwestern terminus from Klinikum-Großhadern to Martinsried.

Theresienwiese park has currently one subway station on site in the north but is served by two additional subway stations a few blocks away (U3/U6 - Goetheplatz in the southeast and U4/U5 – Schwanthälerhöhe in the west). Adding a second onsite subway station in the southeastern area would reduce the heavy Oktoberfest crowd at Theresienwiese station, especially during the closing time. Both stations would have direct connection to Hauptbahnhof without transferring. The name of second onsite station has not been officially determined yet, but the working title at moment is &quot;2. Wiesnbahnhof&quot;. &quot;Esperantoplatz&quot; and &quot;Bavaria&quot; (in reference to the Bavaria statue nearby) have been suggested.

The museum quarter, Pinakothekenviertel, has one station, U2 – Königplatz, but it is inconveniently located in the southwestern quarter, requiring a long walk to several Pinakotheken museums. The new station, Pinakotheken, would be centrally located in the museum quarter and serve the museums and Technical University of Munich within a short walking distance. Pinakotheken would be served by tram lines, Tram 27 and 28, along with several local and crosstown bus lines. The plan will also facilitate the connection between Technical University of Munich and Campus Garching.

The plan called for the closure of the current Poccistraße and Implerstraße subway stations and construction of a new four-track station underneath the Südring, serving the U3, U9, and U29, and connecting to the new aboveground station serving regional trains and possibly the S-Bahn if the future S-Bahn-Ring is approved. The new U-Bahn station would be called &quot;Impler-/Poccistraße&quot; to differentiate it from the current U3/U6 – Implerstraße and Poccistraße stations. The current Poccistraße station has serious structural problems requiring expensive maintenance and extensive monitoring; it is cheaper to build a new station nearby than to continue using Poccistraße.

At Hauptbahnhof, the new dedicated U9 platform would be built underneath the current S-Bahn platform but above the U4/U5 platform. The platform would be located underneath the regional and long-distance train tracks between Holzkirchner Bahnhof (Holzkirchner wing station, serving southeastern Bavaria) and Starnberger Bahnhof (Starnberg wing station, serving southwestern Bavaria) with a new mezzanine level connecting the U9 platform with both wing stations and the rest of Hauptbahnhof. The advantage of locating the U9 platform in the western section of Hauptbahnhof is a quick transfer between platforms without a long, circuitous walk from one platform to other via the grand platform in the east.

On 3 July 2019, Deutsche Bahn announced the new &quot;2. Stammstrecke — Die Optimierungen&quot; (Second Trunk Line Optimisation). The State of Bavaria and the Munich city council want the first U9 station to be built at the Hauptbahnhof at the same time as the reconstruction of the Hauptbahnhof main building and the construction of the second S-Bahn trunk line. The design revision relocates the U9 platforms from the west end of the regional and long-distance platforms to the middle of the main Hauptbahnhof building below ground. The relocation places the U9 station directly above the second trunk line station in a cross arrangement. This improves the passenger flow between two current U-Bahn lines (U4/U5 and U1/U2/U7/U8), one current S-Bahn trunk line, and the above-ground level.

=== U26 tangent line ===
Another proposal for crosstown travel in the north between U2 - Am Hart and U6 (or U9 when opened) - Kieferngarten is under consideration. This U26 would serve the people who live in the north and don&#x27;t need to travel south in order to travel between northwest and northeast regions. The high cost and fewer stops as compared to tram line would make this proposal less feasible.

However, the new massive expansion plan for BMW&#x27;s Forschungszentrum (Research Centre) in the north of BMW headquarter buildings and manufacturing plants would employ about 40,000 employees by 2050. The increased number of employees would lead to the vehicular traffic chaos and collapse unless the new S-Bahn North Ring and new U26 are built with stations at Forschungszentrum. The higher capacity of U26 and underground placement (without impacting the vehicular traffic) could make it more feasible and possible than tram line.

=== More booster lines ===
Different booster lines have been discussed for years without any concrete plans.

; U10: Harthof - Münchner Freiheit - Odeonsplatz - Sendlinger Tor - Harras
: A third booster line, U10, would share U2 line between Harthof and Scheidplatz then switch to U3 line between Scheidplatz and Implerstraße before turning to U6 line at Harras. The northern and southern terminuses have not been determined yet.
; U11: Olympia-Einkaufszentrum - Westfriedhof - Central Station - Sendlinger Tor - Innsbrucker Ring 
: A fourth booster line, U11, would share U1 from Olympia-Einkaufszentrum to Kolumbusplatz before switching to U2 line for the continued journey to Innsbrucker Ring station. Which terminus station, Messestadt Ost in the east or Neuperlach in the south, has not been determined.
; U12: Harthof - Theresienstraße - Hauptbahnhof - Theresienwiese - Implerstraße - Harras
: A fifth booster line, U12, would share with U2 between Harthof and Theresienstraße then switch to U9 south of Theresienstraße where it shares with U9 toward Harras.

== Renovations and upgrades of subway stations ==
; Platform Screen Doors
Munich U-Bahn system is experiencing the increasingly frequency of passengers and objects falling from the platforms into the tracks lately, disrupting the service. The latest statistics showed for 2018 215 passengers falling in and being rescued, 22 seriously injured or dead, 115 objects, and 10 animals. MVG plans the pilot project at Olympiazentrum up to two years to test the feasibility and to resolve any issues before deploying system-wide technology. If these test at Olympiazentrum stations are successful, platform screen doors will be implemented in the high-frequency stations first then gradually and successively added to more stations when they are being renovated. The anticipated completion date of system-wide installation is 2028.

; Fröttmaning station (U6, North) — Completed

The new Allianz Arena (football stadium) required a larger capacity for the nearby U-Bahn station. A new second platform was built and the whole station was moved north by roughly . For easy access to the platform, a second pedestrian bridge was built at the north end of the platforms.

; Marienplatz station (U3/U6) — Completed

The increase in traffic and the new Allianz Arena also required a larger capacity for this already overcrowded pivotal transfer station. New pedestrian tunnels were built, which provide more room for passengers transferring from and to the S-Bahn. They lie parallel to the existing platforms and are connected to them by 11 portals. At the south end, they meet the transverse tunnel, where the escalators to the S-Bahn platforms are located. To prevent Munich&#x27;s historic town hall, located above the station and in between its two tunnels, from sinking in during the construction works, the ground surrounding the construction site had to be frozen over. The construction was completed in time for 2006 World Cup.

; Karlsplatz (Stachus) (U4/U5) — Completed

The two mezzanine levels and north entrance were renovated to include the enhanced fire protection and the updated interior. Due to the damage from humidity and water seepage, the structures of U4/U5 platforms were repaired and sealed up against further seepages.

; Münchner Freiheit (U3/U6) — Completed
The interior has been updated with horizontally corrugated metal wall covering in fluorescent yellow. The square support columns are decked in deep blue tiles with blue lights casting down, giving them blue hue. The ceiling is covered with mirrors, giving the &quot;infinite&quot; height. The mezzanine level had been updated with new white floor. The aboveground tram and bus station received the new organic-shaped covering roof. An interesting fact: prior to renovation, the name was spelled with extra &quot;e&quot; in &quot;Münchener&quot;. After the completion, the name is now &quot;Münchner Freiheit&quot; eliminating the extra &quot;e&quot;, reflecting the current spelling trend, as well as a &quot;return&quot; towards more traditional Bavarian habits of spelling and pronunciation. Thus, it precisely mirrors the spelling on the street signs above.

; Sendlinger Tor station (U1/U2/U7/U8 and U3/U6) — Completed
Due to poor design and unanticipated explosive growth of passenger traffic, Sendlinger Tor station had severe congestion and chokepoints for passengers moving between upper U3/U6 and lower U1/U2/U7/U8 platforms as well as upper levels (mezzanine and street). The €150 million renovation and upgrade of station was approved on 30 December 2015 by administrative district of Oberbayern. The project was scheduled to be completed in 2023 but delayed to 2024 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

The U3/U6 platform had wide staircases and escalators connecting to the U1/U2/U7/U8 platforms below and mezzanine level above, and they created the narrow passageways on the platform. The narrow passageways lead to the dangerous chokepoints for passengers moving between the platforms or levels, especially during the rush hour. The U1/U2/U7/U8 platforms had only one corridor in the middle, connecting to the U3/U6 platform and upper levels. The combined landings of ascending and descending escalators and wide staircases from U3/U6 platform were placed too close to the U1/U2/U7/U8 platforms at either end of middle corridor. This causes the severe congestion during the rush hour when the passengers going downstairs must push through the passengers who are going upstairs.

The five lifts at the station did not connect directly to every level (two platform levels, mezzanine level, and street level). The two street level lifts were connected the mezzanine level only: they were located inconveniently further away from popular shopping street, Sendlinger Straße, requiring the passengers to cross the busy intersection to reach them. From the mezzanine level, the passengers either used two lifts to reach U1/U2/U7/U8 platforms or another lift to reach U3/U6 platform. If the passengers wish to transfer between upper and lower platforms via lifts, they must reach mezzanine level first and travel considerable distance to other lifts.

Additionally, the new EU safety directive 2016/798 requires additional fire protection in the subterranean train stations. Thus, installation of the partitions and doors that close automatically during the fire alarm at the landings of staircases and escalators.

The U1/U2/U7/U8 platforms have the new dedicated corridors built at north and south ends. The north corridor (Sonnenstraße-Verbindungstunnel) is connected to the mezzanine level: one set of escalators connecting to the mezzanine area and one staircase connecting to the lower landings of entrances A and B. The south corridor (Blumenstraße-Verbindungstunnel) is connected directly to the street level, bypassing U3/U6 platform or mezzanine level. Neither of them have the lifts. The north corridor has been opened to the public on 28 April 2020.

The middle corridor was widened by eliminating the mechanical and storage rooms on one side. This allows the higher and better flow of passengers on either side of escalators and staircases. The current lifts, staircases, and escalators between U1/U2/U7/U8 platforms and mezzanine remain unchanged.

The floors of both upper and lower platforms had been raised five centimetres to line up with the subway carriage&#x27;s floor for barrier-free and stepless access with wheelchairs, prams, walkers, strollers, etc. The tactile tiles for the passengers with visual disabilities were installed for the first time at Sendlinger Tor station. Two lifts were reconstructed and expanded to the aboveground so they connect the mezzanine, two platforms, and ground level. This eliminated the need to transfer between the lifts in the mezzanine level when travelling between the aboveground and one of two platforms.

The escalators between U1/U2/U7/U8 and U3/U6 platforms were rearranged as to improve the flow while the wide staircases were eliminated.

The bilevel mezzanine area was renovated with one section rebuilt and levelled to eliminate the small stairs and narrow ramp, which interrupt the flow. The interior has blue and yellow colours, giving the station a bright and airy feel. The small shops, food vendors, and service centres were installed close to the completion.

On 20 September 2024, the seven-year reconstruction was completed to the great fanfare.

=== Plannings and in progress ===
The original planners in the 1960s and 1970s did not envision the massive growth of passengers, increased number of subway lines, and continued extensions of current subway lines in the forthcoming years. Thus, they did not design the subway stations accordingly as to make them &quot;future proof&quot;. The intersecting subway lines cause the overcrowding and frustrating movements between two station platforms, especially at Hauptbahnhof (U1/U2/U7/U8, U4/U5, and future U9 as well as S-Bahn), Sendlinger Tor (U1/U2/U7/U8 and U3/U6), and Odeonplatz (U3/U6 and U4/U5). The platform width and passage between stations and a fewer number of escalators were inadequate for larger number of people moving from one station to other as well as from aboveground to the underground during the rush hour.

; Hauptbahnhof (U4/U5) — Planned
On 23 February 2020, MVG announced a new project to reconstruct U4/U5 platform at Hauptbahnhof for improved passenger movement between U1/U2/U7/U8 platforms below and mezzanine level above. One of the proposals called for installation of footbridge above U4/U5 platform that are connected at several points by unidirectional escalators and smaller lifts. No construction start date has been given. This coincides with megaproject of reconstructing Hauptbahnhof building and construction of new second S-Bahn trunk line and third U-Bahn line.

<doc id="1175262" wikidata="Q860554" url="?curid=1175262" title="Performance indicator">
<text>A performance indicator or key performance indicator (KPI) is a type of performance measurement. KPIs evaluate the success of an organization or of a particular activity (such as projects, programs, products and other initiatives) in which it engages. KPIs provide a focus for strategic and operational improvement, create an analytical basis for decision making and help focus attention on what matters most.

Often success is simply the repeated, periodic achievement of some levels of operational goal (e.g. zero defects, 10/10 customer satisfaction), and sometimes success is defined in terms of making progress toward strategic goals. Accordingly, choosing the right KPIs relies upon a good understanding of what is important to the organization. What is deemed important often depends on the department measuring the performance – e.g. the KPIs useful to finance will differ from the KPIs assigned to sales.

Since there is a need to understand well what is important, various techniques to assess the present state of the business, and its key activities, are associated with the selection of performance indicators. These assessments often lead to the identification of potential improvements, so performance indicators are routinely associated with &#x27;performance improvement&#x27; initiatives. A very common way to choose KPIs is to apply a management framework such as the balanced scorecard.

The importance of such performance indicators is evident in the typical decision-making process (e.g. in management of organisations). When a decision-maker considers several options, they must be equipped to properly analyse the status quo to predict the consequences of future actions. Should they make their analysis on the basis of faulty or incomplete information, the predictions will not be reliable and consequently the decision made might yield an unexpected result. Therefore, the proper usage of performance indicators is vital to avoid such mistakes and minimise the risk.

KPIs are used not only for business organizations but also for technical aspects such as machine performance. For example, a machine used for production in a factory would output various signals indicating how the current machine status is (e.g., machine sensor signals). Some signals or signals as a result of processing the existing signals may represent the high-level machine performance. These representative signals can be KPI for the machine.

==Categorization of indicators==
Key performance indicators define a set of values to measure against. These raw sets of values, which can be fed to systems that aggregate the data, are called &quot;indicators&quot;. There are two categories of measurements for KPIs. 
* &quot;Quantitative&quot; facts presented with a specific objective numeric value measured against a standard. Usually they are not subject to distortion, personal feelings, prejudices, or interpretations. 
* &quot;Qualitative&quot; represents non-numeric conformance to a standard, or interpretation of personal feelings, tastes, opinions or experiences.

An &#x27;indicator&#x27; can only measure what &#x27;has&#x27; happened, in the past tense, so the only type of measurement is descriptive or lagging. Any KPI that attempts to measure something in a future state as predictive, diagnostic or prescriptive is no longer an &#x27;indicator&#x27;, it is a &#x27;prognosticator&#x27; – at this point, it is analytics (possibly based on a KPI) but leading KPIs are also used to indicate the amount of front end loading activities.

==Points of measurement==
&quot;Performance&quot; focuses on measuring a particular &quot;element&quot; of an &quot;activity&quot;. An activity can have four elements: input, output, control, and mechanism. At a minimum, activity is required to have at least an input and an output. Something goes into the activity as an &quot;input&quot;; the activity transforms the input by changing its &quot;state&quot;, and the activity produces an &quot;output&quot;. An activity can also enable &quot;mechanisms&quot; that are typically separated into &quot;human&quot; and &quot;system&quot; mechanisms. It can also be constrained in some way by a &quot;control&quot;. Lastly, its actions can have a temporal construct of &quot;time&quot;.

* &quot;Input&quot; indicates the inputs required of an activity to produce an output.
* &quot;Output&quot; captures the outcome or results of an activity or group of activities.
* &quot;Activity&quot; indicates the transformation produced by an activity (i.e., some form of work).
* &quot;Mechanism&quot; enables an activity to work (a performer), either human or system.
* &quot;Control&quot; is an object that controls the activity&#x27;s production through compliance.
* &quot;Time&quot; indicates a temporal element of the activity.

==Identifying indicators==
Performance indicators differ from business drivers and aims (or goals). A school might consider the failure rate of its students as a key performance indicator which might help the school understand its position in the educational community, whereas a business might consider the percentage of income from returning customers as a potential KPI.

The key stages in identifying KPIs are:
* Having a pre-defined business process (BP).
* Having requirements for the BPs.
* Having a quantitative/qualitative measurement of the results and comparison with set goals.
* Investigating variances and tweaking processes or resources to achieve short-term goals.

Key performance indicators (KPIs) are ways to periodically assess the performances of organizations, business units, and their division, departments and employees. Accordingly, KPIs are most commonly defined in a way that is understandable, meaningful, and measurable. They are rarely defined in such a way that their fulfillment would be hampered by factors seen as non-controllable by the organizations or individuals responsible. Such KPIs are usually ignored by organizations.

KPIs should follow the SMART criteria. This means the measure has a Specific purpose for the business, it is Measurable to really get a value of the KPI, the defined norms have to be Achievable, the improvement of a KPI has to be Relevant to the success of the organization, and finally it must be Time phased, which means the value or outcomes are shown for a predefined and relevant period.

KPIs should be set at a senior level within an organization and cascaded through all levels of management. In order to be evaluated, KPIs are linked to target values, so that the value of the measure can be assessed as meeting expectations or not.

Key performance indicators are mostly the non-financial measures of a company&#x27;s performance – they do not have a monetary value but in a business context they do contribute to the company&#x27;s profitability.

==Examples==
===Accounts===
These are some of the examples:

* Percentage of overdue invoices
* Percentage of purchase orders raised in advance
* Number of retrospectively raised purchase orders
* Finance report error rate (measures the quality of the report)
* Average cycle time of workflow
* Number of duplicate payments

===Marketing and sales===
* New customer acquisition
* Customer acquisition cost (CAC)
* Average deal size
* Demographic analysis of individuals (potential customers) applying to become customers, and the levels of approval, rejections, and pending numbers
* Status of existing customers
*Customer density (the proportion of revenue attributable to a specified percentage of accounts, which ideally should match, for example the top 10% of accounts should broadly contribute 10% of revenue) 
* Customer attrition (the loss of clients or customers)
* Turnover (i.e., revenue) generated by segments of the customer population
* Outstanding balances held by segments of customers and terms of payment
* Collection of bad debts within customer relationships
* Profitability of customers by demographic segments and segmentation of customers by profitability

Many of these customer KPIs are developed and managed with customer relationship management software.

Faster availability of data is a competitive issue for most organizations. For example, businesses that have higher operational/credit risk (involving for example credit cards or wealth management) may want weekly or even daily availability of KPI analysis, facilitated by appropriate IT systems and tools.

===Manufacturing===
Overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) is a set of broadly accepted nonfinancial metrics that reflect manufacturing success.
* OEE = availability x performance x quality
* Availability = run time / total time; by definition this is the percentage of the actual amount of production time the machine is running to the production time the machine is available.
* Down time = time the building/ location/ service/ machine is out of operation due to any reason (including planned down time such as maintenance or &#x27;out of season&#x27;).
* Performance = total count / target counter, by definition this is the percentage of total parts produced on the machine to the production rate of machine.
* Quality = good count / total count, by definition, this is the percentage of good parts out of the total parts produced on the machine. 
* Cycle time ratio (CTR) = standard cycle time / real cycle time
*Capacity utilization
* Rejection rate

===Professional services===
Most professional services firms (for example, management consultancies, systems integration firms, or digital marketing agencies) use three key performance indicators to track the health of their businesses. They typically use professional services automation (PSA) software to keep track of and manage these metrics.
* Utilization rate = the percentage of time employees spend generating revenue 
* Project profitability = the difference between the revenue generated by a project and the cost of delivering the work 
* Project success rate = the percentage of projects delivered on time and under budget

===System operations===
* Availability / uptime
* Mean time between failure
* Mean time to repair
* Unplanned availability
* Unplanned downtime
* Average time to repair

===Project execution===
* Earned value
* Cost variance or Cost Performance Index
* Schedule variance or Schedule Performance Index
* Estimate to complete
* Manpower spent / month
* Money spent / month
* Planned spend / month
* Planned manpower / month
* Average time to delivery
* Tasks / staff
* Project overhead / ROI
* Planned delivery date vs actual delivery date

===Supply chain management===
Businesses can utilize supply chain KPIs to establish and monitor progress toward a variety of goals, including lean manufacturing objectives, minority business enterprise and diversity spending, environmental &quot;green&quot; initiatives, cost avoidance programs and low-cost country sourcing targets. Suppliers can implement KPIs to gain a competitive advantage. Suppliers have instant access to a user-friendly portal for submitting standardized cost savings templates. Suppliers and their customers exchange vital supply chain performance data while gaining visibility to the exact status of cost improvement projects and cost savings documentation.

Any business, regardless of size, can better manage supplier performance and overall supply chain performance, with the help of KPIs&#x27; robust capabilities, which include:
* Automated entry and approval functions
* On-demand, real-time scorecard measures
* Rework on procured inventory
* Single data repository to eliminate inefficiencies and maintain consistency
* Advanced workflow approval process to ensure consistent procedures
* Flexible data-input modes and real-time graphical performance displays
* Customized cost savings documentation
* Simplified setup procedures to eliminate dependence upon IT resources

Main KPIs for supply chain management will detail the following processes:
* Sales forecasts
* Inventory
* Procurement and suppliers
* Warehousing
* Transportation
* Reverse logistics

In a warehouse, the manager will use KPIs that target best use of the facility, like the receiving and put away KPIs to measure the receiving efficiency and the putaway cost per line. Storage KPIs can also be used to determine the efficiency of the storage space and the carrying cost of the inventory.

===Government===
The provincial government of Ontario, Canada has been using KPIs since 1998 to measure the performance of higher education institutions in the province. All post-secondary schools collect and report performance data in five areas – graduate satisfaction, student satisfaction, employer satisfaction, employment rate, and graduation rate. In England, Public Health England uses KPIs to provide a consistent measure of the performance of NHS population screening activities, and publication of up to four main KPIs for the most important contracts outsourced by each UK government department is seen as a measure helping to increase transparency in the delivery of public services.

===Other performance indicators===
* Duration of a stockout situation

: formula_1

* Customer order waiting time

Human Resource Management

* Employee turnover
* Ability to recruit to advertised roles
* Employee performance indicators
* Staff satisfaction/ results of staff surveys
* Proportion of staff unplanned absence (due to short or long term sickness)
* Cross-functional team analysis
* Organization contribution to Sector performance improvement Ex: Research Institutes contribution to Commercial Agriculture Improvement 

==Problems ==
In practice, overseeing key performance indicators can prove expensive or difficult for organizations. Some indicators such as staff morale may be impossible to quantify. As such, dubious KPIs can be adopted that can be used as a rough guide rather than a precise benchmark.

Key performance indicators can also lead to perverse incentives and unintended consequences as a result of employees working to the specific measurements at the expense of the actual quality or value of their work.

Sometimes, collecting statistics can become a substitute for a better understanding of the problems, so the use of dubious KPIs can result in progress in aims and measured effectiveness becoming different. For example, during the Vietnam War, US soldiers were shown to be effective in kill ratios and high body counts, but this was misleading when used to measure aims as it did not show the lack of progress towards the US goal of increasing South Vietnamese government control of its territory. Another example would be to measure the productivity of a software development team in terms of lines of source code written. This approach can easily add large amounts of dubious code, thereby inflating the line count but adding little value in terms of systemic improvement. A similar problem arises when a footballer kicks a ball uselessly to build up their statistics.

<doc id="1175264" wikidata="Q2091859" url="?curid=1175264" title="Piako River">
<text>The Piako River is a lowland river system that drains into the Firth of Thames on the North Island of New Zealand. Together with the Waihou River, it is one of the two main rivers systems which drains the Hauraki Plains. It is the dominant river system in the Matamata-Piako District, and on its journey it passes through the towns of Morrinsville and Ngatea.

==Geography==
The Piako River has an annual mean flow of (at Paeroa-Tahuna Road), with a total catchment area of approximately . The river system is approximately long, aligned in a north-south direction and occupies much of the central and western Hauraki Plains (or more broadly, the Thames Valley), extending from Hinuera in the south before discharging into the Firth of Thames in the north, five kilometres west of Thames.

The Piako River has two major stems: the first, and main, stem drains the northern Te Miro-Tahuroa hills, and the Pakaroa Range. The dominant tributaries on the eastern slopes of these hills are the Piakonui and Piakoiti Streams. These streams, together with the smaller Toenepi Stream, converge just south of Kereone to become the Piako River. The western slopes are drained by the Waitakaruru Stream which joins the Piako River at Morrinsville. As the Piako River progresses north, it is fed by numerous small streams draining the eastern slopes of the Hangawera Hills.

The second stem is the Waitoa River, which starts near Piarere. The Waitoa River catchment drains the Hinuera Flats and broad southern Hauraki Plains, before converging with the Piako River in the large wetland known as the Kopuatai Peat Dome, northeast of Tahuna. The Upper Piako River catchment also drains the eastern aspects of the Hapuakohe Range through small tributaries.

The river system is highly modified by intensive dairy farming and associated industry. Given this, the Toenepi Stream - a small sub-catchment of the Piako River - has been extensively used to research the impact of intensive farming on water quality and develop improved farming practices.

== Drainage and flood protection ==
In 1906 work started on cutting the bends in the river below Kaihere Landing. Since the 1930s, considerable flood protection measures have been undertaken on the Piako River and surrounding catchment, especially mainly north of Paeroa-Tahuna Road and the Kopuatai Peat Dome. The scheme includes river management works, river diversions and channel enlargement, ponding systems, floodway improvements, stopbanks, floodgates and pumps. However, the river flooded again in 2017. A 2018 plan provides for strengthened stopbanks and diversion ponds.

The scheme works includes the following:
* Main river and tributary channel enlargement and clearing work,
* 170 km of stopbanks,
* 59 floodgates and
* 32 pump stations

The scheme provides the following levels of service:
* 100-year protection from tidal flooding with freeboard,
* 50-year protection from Piako River flooding with freeboard
== Transport ==
Until 1930 the river was used to Tahuna and occasionally Morrinsville to carry people and goods. Northern Steamship had a weekly trip from Auckland to Tahuna and back until 1927, calling at Pipiroa, Hopai, Ngatea (Orchard), Kerepehi and Waikaka. A few years earlier plans had been made to upgrade the main highways in the area, partly with ratepayer funding.

==Piako River Bridge (Ngatea)==
The original Piako River Bridge was built in Ngatea and opened in 1917. In the earliest days all transport or access to and from the land was either by sea, river or canal, but with the first roads being developed, it was essential that a bridge be built over the Piako River so it could become a main route between Auckland and Tauranga. Considerable work has gone into restoring the banks of the river, as in winter it is the direct cause of flooding through the low-lying Hauraki Plains. From 1917 to 1952 the bridge had a lifting section to allow ships to pass.
==History==
Captain James Cook sailed up the Piako.

<text>Amadou is a spongy material derived from &quot;Fomes fomentarius&quot; and similar fungi that grow on the bark of coniferous and angiosperm trees, and have the appearance of a horse&#x27;s hoof (thus the name &quot;hoof fungus&quot;). It is also known as the &quot;tinder fungus&quot; and is useful for starting slow-burning fires. The fungus must be removed from the tree, the hard outer layer scraped off, and then thin strips of the inner spongy layer cut for use as tinder.&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

Amadou was a precious resource to ancient people, allowing them to start a fire by catching sparks from flint struck against iron pyrites. Bits of fungus preserved in peat have been discovered at the Mesolithic site of Star Carr in the UK, modified presumably for this purpose. Remarkable evidence for its utility is provided by the discovery of the 5,000-year-old remains of &quot;Ötzi the Iceman&quot;, who carried it on a cross-alpine excursion before his death and subsequent ice-entombment.

Amadou has great water-absorbing abilities. It is used in fly fishing for drying out dry flies that have become wet. Another use is for forming a felt-like fabric used in the making of hats and other items. It can be used as a kind of artificial leather. Mycologist Paul Stamets famously wears a hat made of amadou.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;
Before such uses, amadou needs to be prepared by being pounded flat, and boiled or soaked in a solution of nitre. One method of preparation starts by soaking a slice in washing soda for a week, beating it gently from time to time. Following this it is left to dry. The result is initially hard and must be pounded with a blunt object to soften and flatten it.

<doc id="1175270" wikidata="Q80722" url="?curid=1175270" title="Nickel–iron battery">
<text>The nickel–iron battery (NiFe battery) is a rechargeable battery having nickel(III) oxide-hydroxide positive plates and iron negative plates, with an electrolyte of potassium hydroxide. The active materials are held in nickel-plated steel tubes or perforated pockets. It is a very robust battery which is tolerant of abuse, (overcharge, overdischarge, and short-circuiting) and can have very long life even if so treated.
It is often used in backup situations where it can be continuously charged and can last for more than 20 years. Due to its low specific energy, poor charge retention, and high cost of manufacture, other types of rechargeable batteries have displaced the nickel–iron battery in most applications.

== Uses ==

Many railway vehicles use NiFe batteries. Some examples are London underground electric locomotives and New York City Subway car – R62A.

The technology has regained popularity for off-the-grid applications where daily charging makes it an appropriate technology.

Nickel–iron batteries are being investigated for use as combined batteries and electrolysis for hydrogen production for fuel cell cars and storage. Those &quot;battolysers&quot; could be charged and discharged like conventional batteries, and would produce hydrogen when fully charged.

== Durability ==

The ability of these batteries to survive frequent cycling is due to the low solubility of the reactants in the electrolyte. The formation of metallic iron during charge is slow because of the low solubility of the ferrous hydroxide. While the slow formation of iron crystals preserves the electrodes, it also limits the high rate performance: these cells charge slowly, and are only able to discharge slowly. Nickel–iron cells should not be charged from a constant voltage supply since they can be damaged by thermal runaway; the cell internal voltage drops as gassing begins, raising temperature, which increases current drawn and so further increases gassing and temperature.

==Electrochemistry==
The half-cell reaction at the positive plate from black nickel(III) oxide-hydroxide NiO(OH) to green nickel(II) hydroxide Ni(OH)2 :

:&lt;chem&gt;2 NiO(OH) + 2 H2O + 2 e- &lt;=&gt; 2 Ni(OH)2 + 2 OH- &lt;/chem&gt;

and at the negative plate:

:&lt;chem&gt;Fe + 2 OH- &lt;=&gt; Fe(OH)2 + 2 e-&lt;/chem&gt;

(Discharging is read left to right, charging is from right to left.)

The open-circuit voltage is 1.4 volts, dropping to 1.2 volts during discharge. The electrolyte mixture of potassium hydroxide and lithium hydroxide is not consumed in charging or discharging, so unlike a lead-acid battery the electrolyte specific gravity does not indicate state of charge. The voltage required to charge the NiFe battery is equal to or greater than 1.6 volts per cell. The inclusion of lithium hydroxide improves the performance of the cell. The equalization charge voltage is 1.65 volts.

==History==

Swedish inventor Waldemar Jungner invented the nickel–cadmium battery in 1899. Jungner experimented with substituting iron for the cadmium in varying proportions, including 100% iron. Jungner discovered that the main advantage over the nickel–cadmium chemistry was cost, but due to the lower efficiency of the charging reaction and more pronounced formation of hydrogen (gassing), the nickel–iron technology was found wanting and abandoned. Jungner had several patents for the iron version of his battery (Swedish pat. Nos 8.558/1897, 10.177/1899, 11.132/1899, 11.487/1899 and German Patent No.110.210 /1899). Moreover, he had one patent for NiCd battery: Swed.pat No. 15.567/1899.

In 1901 Thomas Edison patented and commercialized NiFe in the United States and offered it as the energy source for electric vehicles, such as the Detroit Electric and Baker Electric. Edison claimed the nickel–iron design to be, &quot;far superior to batteries using lead plates and acid&quot; (lead–acid battery). Edison had several patents: /1901, /1902, and German patent No 157.290/1901.

Edison was disappointed that his battery was not adopted for starting internal combustion engines, and that electric vehicles went out of production only a few years after his battery was introduced. He developed the battery to be the battery of choice for electric vehicles, which were the preferred transportation mode in the early 1900s (followed by gasoline and steam). Edison&#x27;s batteries had a significantly higher energy density than the lead–acid batteries in use at the time, and could be charged in half the time; however, they performed poorly at low temperatures, and were more expensive.

Jungner&#x27;s work was largely unknown in the US until the 1940s, when nickel–cadmium batteries went into production there. A 50 volt nickel–iron battery was the main D.C. power supply in the World War II German V-2 rocket, together with two 16 volt batteries which powered the four gyroscopes (turbine powered generators supplied A.C. for its magnetic amplifier driven servomechanisms). A smaller version was used in the V-1 flying bomb. (viz. 1946 Operation Backfire blueprints.)

Edison&#x27;s batteries were profitably made from about 1903 to 1972 by the Edison Storage Battery Company in West Orange, New Jersey. In 1972 the battery company was sold to the Exide Battery Corporation, which discontinued the product in 1975. The battery was widely used for railroad signaling, forklift, and standby power applications.

Nickel–iron cells were made with capacities from 5 to 1250 Ah. Many of the original manufacturers no longer make nickel iron cells, but production by new companies has started in several countries.

== Plate design of the original Edison battery ==
The active material of the battery plates is contained in a number of filled tubes or pockets, securely mounted in a supporting and conducting frame or grid. The support is in good electrical contact with the tubes. The grid is a light skeleton frame, stamped from thin sheet steel, with reinforcing width at the top. The grids, as well as all other internal metal surfaces, are nickel-plated to prevent corrosion. The elements must remain covered with electrolyte; if they dry out, the negative plates oxidize and require a very long charge.

The active material of the positive plates is a form of nickel hydrate. The tube retainers are made of thin steel ribbon, finely perforated and nickel-plated, about 4 in. long and 1/4 in. and 1/8in. in diameter. The ribbon is spirally wound, with lapped seams, and the tubes reinforced at about 1/2 in. intervals with small steel rings. Into these tubes nickel hydrate and pure flake nickel are loaded in thin, alternating layers (about 350 layers of each to a tube) and are tightly packed or rammed. The purpose of the flake nickel is to make good contact between the nickel hydrate and the tubes, and thereby provide conductivity. The tubes, when filled and closed, are then mounted vertically into the grids.


The active material of the negative plates is iron oxide. The retainer pockets are made of thin, finely perforated nickel-plated steel, of rectangular shape, 1/2 in. wide, 3 in long and 1/8 in. maximum thickness. The iron oxide, in finely powdered form is tightly rammed into these pockets, after which they are mounted into the grids. After mounting they are pressed, forcing them into close contact with the grids. This corrugates the sides of the pockets to provide a spring contact of the pocket with the active material.

==Charge==

Charge/discharge involves the transfer of oxygen from one electrode to the other (from one group of plates to the other). Hence this type of cell is sometimes called an oxygenlift cell. In a charged cell the active material of the positive plates is superoxidized, and that of the negative plates is in a spongy or reduced state.

If the normal capacity of the cell is insufficient, short increased rate charges can be given provided that the temperature of the electrolyte does not exceed 115˚ F / 46˚ C. These short charges are very efficient and cause no injury. Rates up to three times normal charge rate (defined as C, the current equal to the nominal capacity of the battery divided by 1 hour) can be employed for periods of 30 minutes.

Fully charging a NiFe cell consists of seven hours at the normal cell rate. In service the amount of charge given is governed by the extent of the previous discharge. For example, a battery discharged one-half, allows a 3.5 hour normal rate charge. Overcharging wastes current and causes rapid evaporation of the water in the electrolyte.

For tapering rates of charge, an average of 1.67 volts should be maintained across the cell terminals throughout the charge. The current value at the start of the charge varies according to the electrical resistance. Absent resistance, the starting rate will be about twice normal and the finishing rate about 40% of normal.

==Discharge==

Under discharge the positive plates are reduced (&quot;deoxidized&quot;); the oxygen, with its natural affinity for iron, goes to the negative plates, oxidizing them. It is permissible to discharge continuously at any rate up to 25% above normal, and for short periods at up to six times normal. When the discharge rate exceeds this value, abnormal voltage drops will occur.

==Electrolyte==

The electrolyte does not enter into chemical combination to perform the functions of the cell, acting as a conveyor. Its specific gravity is unaffected during charge and discharge other than through evaporation and changes in temperature. Considerable variation in specific gravity is permissible, having influence only on battery efficiency.

==Environmental impact==

Nickel–iron batteries do not have the lead or cadmium of the lead–acid and nickel–cadmium batteries, which require treatment as hazardous materials. Nickel-iron batteries do not cause spill concerns since there is no acid in the component.

<text>The ependyma is the thin neuroepithelial (simple columnar ciliated epithelium) lining of the ventricular system of the brain and the central canal of the spinal cord. The ependyma is one of the four types of neuroglia in the central nervous system (CNS). It is involved in the production of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and is shown to serve as a reservoir for neuroregeneration.

==Structure==
The ependyma is made up of ependymal cells called ependymocytes, a type of glial cell. These cells line the ventricles in the brain and the central canal of the spinal cord, which become filled with cerebrospinal fluid. These are nervous tissue cells with simple columnar shape, much like that of some mucosal epithelial cells. Early monociliated ependymal cells are differentiated to multiciliated ependymal cells for their function in circulating cerebrospinal fluid. 

The basal membranes of these cells are characterized by tentacle-like extensions that attach to astrocytes. The apical side is covered in cilia and microvilli.

==Function==

===Cerebrospinal fluid===
Lining the CSF-filled ventricles, and spinal canal, the ependymal cells play an important role in the production and regulation of CSF. Their apical surfaces are covered in a layer of cilia, which circulate CSF around the CNS. Their apical surfaces are also covered with microvilli, which absorb CSF. Within the ventricles of the brain, a population of modified ependymal cells and capillaries together known as the tela choroidea form a structure called the choroid plexus, which produces the CSF.

Modified tight junctions between epithelial cells control fluid release. This release allows free exchange between CSF and nervous tissue of brain and spinal cord. This is why sampling of CSF, such as through a spinal tap, provides information about the whole CNS.

===Neuroregeneration===
Jonas Frisén and his colleagues at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm provided evidence that ependymal cells act as reservoir cells in the forebrain, which can be activated after stroke and as in vivo and in vitro stem cells in the spinal cord. However, these cells did not self-renew and were subsequently depleted as they generated new neurons, thus failing to satisfy the requirement for stem cells. One study observed that ependymal cells from the lining of the lateral ventricle might be a source for cells which can be transplanted into the cochlea to reverse hearing loss.

==Clinical significance==
Ependymoma is a tumor of the ependymal cells most commonly found in the fourth ventricle.

<text>The term overseas territory ( or TOM) is an administrative division of France and is currently only applied to the French Southern and Antarctic Lands.

The division differs from that of overseas department and region ( or DROM), but because of some common peculiarities, DOMs, TOMs and other overseas possessions under other statuses are often referred to collectively as &quot;&quot;. Unlike the British Overseas Territories, which are not constitutionally parts of the United Kingdom or its national territory, they are integral parts of the French Republic.

<text>Susa (, , ) is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the  Metropolitan City of Turin, Piedmont, Italy. In the middle of Susa Valley, it is situated on at the confluence of the Cenischia with the Dora Riparia, a tributary of the Po River, at the foot of the Cottian Alps, 51 km (32 mi) west of Turin.

==History==
Susa () was founded by the Ligures. It was the capital of the Segusini (also known as Cottii). In the late 1st century BC it became voluntarily part of the Roman Empire. Remains of the Roman city have been found in the excavations of the central square, the Piazza Savoia. Susa was the capital of the province of Alpes Cottiae. According to the medieval historian Rodulfus Glaber, Susa was &quot;the oldest of Alpine towns&quot;.

In the Middle and Modern ages, Susa remained important as a hub of roads connecting southern France to Italy. Taking part of the county or march of Turin (sometimes &quot;march of Susa&quot;). In 1167, Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor and Holy Roman Empress Beatrice were attacked here; the emperor disguised as a horse servant to flee, while the empress was imprisoned until permitted to depart in 1168. In 1174 the emperor pillaged Susa in revenge.

Henry of Segusio, usually called Hostiensis, (c. 1200 – 1271) an Italian canonist of the thirteenth century, was born in the city. During the Napoleonic era a new road, the Via Napoleonica, was built. The city&#x27;s role as a communications hub has been confirmed recently by a nationwide dispute over the construction of the proposed Turin-Lyon high-speed rail link (TAV) to France.

==Main sights==

*Susa Cathedral () (1029).
*The triumphal Arch of Augustus, erected by a Romanized Sugusian chief to Augustus in 8 BC. 
*The Roman Amphitheater.
*Castle of Marquise Adelaide. It is likely located in the same site of the ancient Roman &quot;Praetorium&quot;.
*Archaeological area of Piazza Savoia.

==Twin cities==
* Barnstaple, United Kingdom
* Briançon, France
* Paola, Italy

<text>The Sami knife (, , , all of which mean &quot;big-knife&quot;, and ) is a large knife traditionally used by the Sami people.

== Uses and structure ==
The Sami knife has a long, wide, and strong blade that is suited for light chopping tasks such as de-limbing, cutting small trees for shelter poles (See lavvu), brush clearing, bone breaking and butchering tasks, and is sometimes used as a substitute for an axe for chopping and splitting small amounts of firewood from standing dead trees—an essential ability when all dead and fallen wood is buried underneath many layers of snow—or for combat. Typical Sami knives have a blade length ranging from to . 

The handle is generally made from birch for better grip when used in snowy conditions. This also provides good control over the blade, particularly when using draw strokes, which are preferred when handling the knife with gloves, or while the hands are numb. The tang runs through the handle. The handle has no crossguard. Traditional material for the sheath is reindeer leather.

The blade&#x27;s edge often has a Scandinavian (or &quot;Scandi&quot;) grind, i.e. a single flat bevel. The blade should be strong enough to split (reindeer) bones, and tempered to sustain low temperatures. Some Sami knives have fullers.

== Types ==
The Sami people typically use two knives: the smaller called a &quot;buiku&quot;, &quot;puukko&quot;, or &quot;unna niibaš&quot; (&quot;small knife&quot;); while the larger &quot;Sami knife&quot; is called &quot;stuorra niibi&quot; (&quot;big knife&quot;).

<text>Candling is a method used in embryology to study the growth and development of an embryo inside an egg. The method uses a bright light source behind the egg to show details through the shell, and is so called because the original sources of light used were candles.

The technique of using light to examine eggs is used in the egg industry to assess the quality of edible eggs.

==In plants==

This technique can also be used to assess the quality and development stage of certain translucent plant seeds, especially those of Lilies and their close relatives. Ripe, viable seeds have a visible embryo within them when viewed in transmitted light, so good seeds can be sorted out from the non-viable seeds and chaff, if desired. Candling is a highly useful method with certain species that germinate erratically or very slowly, as seed germination causes the embryo to enlarge. Candling can thus be used to estimate the optimal time for planting seeds that are being stratified. Care must be taken during candling, as drying or overheating will kill the developing seeds.

==In lutherie==
In lutherie, candling is sometimes used to check the thickness of the soundboard in various places, especially on lutes and historical guitars. This is especially necessary because these instruments have soundboards which vary in thickness, for instance the area where the rose is carved. It is also used to check for any flaws in the wood, or to check how tight a joint is, for instance on the centre seam of the soundboard.

Traditionally, a candle would be used, hence the name, but usually nowadays a modern light is used, as this is less of a fire risk.

<text>François Dalle (), born on 18 March 1918 in Hesdin (Pas-de-Calais, France) and died on 9 August 2005 in Geneva, Switzerland, was a French company director and business executive. He transformed L’Oréal from an SME, founded in 1909 by Eugène Schueller, into the world&#x27;s leading cosmetics and beauty products company.
==Biography==
François Dalle was the son of Joseph Dalle, a brewer in Hesdin in Pas-de-Calais, and Jeanne Dalle, née Dumont.

As a law student François Dalle lived with the Marist Fathers at 104 rue de Vaugirard in Paris. While there, he forged friendships with André Bettencourt and François Mitterrand. A brilliant student, he was ranked among the best students in the Faculty of Law of Paris, where he achieved a law degree. At the time, he had the ambition of pursuing a career in law, but the fall of France to the Nazis in 1940 forced him to give up working for his agrégation (teaching certificate), and to continue on this path.

For a time a lawyer at the Paris Court of Appeal, from 1941 to 1942, he met Eugène Schueller through his friend André Bettencourt.. After a brief interview he was hired at &quot;half of today’s French statutory minimum wage&quot; as assistant to the secretary of the sales director at the Monsavon factory in Clichy (92), and rapidly rose through the company&#x27;s ranks to become factory manager then chief executive officer of the Monsavon company in 1945. He became CEO of L’Oréal in 1948 before being appointed chairman and CEO on the death of Eugène Schueller in 1957, a post he would occupy without interruption from 1957 to 1984, making him one of the longest-serving chairmen and CEOs of a CAC 40 company. In 1984, at the age of 64, he stepped down in favour of Charles Zviak to become chairman of L’Oréal&#x27;s Strategic Committee, until 1990. He remained a director of the committee until 2005.

Among his other key responsibilities in private companies, he was also on the board of Nestlé SA, from 1974 to 1986, later becoming its First vice-president from 1986 to 1990, before becoming a Council Member from 1990 to 2000. He was chairman &amp; CEO then Director of Saipo from 1957 to 1999 and vice-chairman of the board of directors of Gesparai. Lastly, he was a director of the Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) from 1973 to 1982, of les Éditions Masson from 1975 to 1984, Air Liquide from 1986 to 1992 and TV Channels stations Canal+ from 1985 to 1994 and TF1, from 1987 to 1994.

As part of his commitment to the social and economic life of France, he sat on the Conseil national du patronat français (CNPF) (CNPF; National Council of French Employers) as a member of the executive council from 1972 to 1975 after being a committee member since 1968. He was also the founding chairman in 1969 of the think tank &quot;Entreprise et Progrès&quot;, sitting as a member of the management committee until 1971, to then become honorary chairman. Lastly, he was a member of the Bureau du Conseil du Progrès Industriel from 1968.

François Dalle was heavily involved in other domains, such as training, the academic world and public institution. As such, he was founding chairman and vice-president in 1975, then honorary chairman of the Institut de l&#x27;entreprise (IDEP), founding chairman of the Institut international de prospective-Futuroscope of Poitiers from 1989 to 1999 and chairman of the management committee of the magazine &quot;Humanisme et Entreprise&quot; from 1968. In addition, he held the posts of chairman of the Institut International de l’Innovation, chairman of the Commission Nationale pour l’Industrie, and director and chairman of the Centre d’Études Littéraires et Scientifiques Appliquées (CELSA) whose creation he supported in 1957. Lastly, he was vice-president and honorary director of the Pasteur Institute from 1970 to 1978, director of the Institut Européen d&#x27;Administration des Affaires (INSEAD) from 1969 to 1973, and of the Centre de Documentation et d&#x27;Éducation Permanente (CEDEP), from 1971 to 1996.

In 1983 the magazine &quot;Le Nouvel Économiste&quot; awarded him the title of Manager of the Year.

In 1984 the French President, François Mitterrand, asked him to turn his attention to France&#x27;s automotive industry. He thus delivered a report highlighting the weaknesses of French manufacturers, who were experiencing a downturn in their competitiveness and were stuck with an oversized workforce and an apparently obsolete manufacturing model. Among the economic, social and industrial measures he proposed, he notably recommended using Japanese manufacturing systems. His foresight has since been confirmed, in view of the changes experienced in the French automotive industry over the past 40 years.

François Dalle died on 9 August 2005 in Geneva in Switzerland, leaving six children: Jean-Francois, Guyonne, Pierre-Jérôme, Frédéric, Jean-Baptiste and Violaine. In keeping with his wishes, he was cremated and a mass was celebrated in his memory in the Les Invalides Church in Paris attended by, among others, Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing, Lindsay Owen-Jones and Liliane Bettencourt.

== &quot;L&#x27;aventure L&#x27;Oréal&quot; ==
A demanding businessman, but always caring towards his employees, François Dalle succeeded in transforming a French SME into one of the key players in cosmetics, making it the world leader in beauty, with brands as emblematic as L’Oréal Paris, Garnier, Mixa, Lancôme, Diesel, Biotherm, Yves-Saint-Laurent and Armani.

He told the story of the company in his book &quot;L&#x27;aventure L&#x27;Oréal&quot;, published in 2001 by Éditions Odile Jacob (published in English as &quot;The L’Oréal Adventure), in which he also shared his concepts of management and marketing, via several key principles.

== A selection of aphorisms summing up how Francois Dalle thought and acted ==
Most of the quotes below are taken from the English translation of &quot;L&#x27;aventure L&#x27;Oréal&quot;&quot;Seize upcoming trends.&quot;

&quot;There is no progress without the quest for accomplishment.&quot;

&quot;Authority does not come only from successes achieved; it can also come from errors that one has been able to recognize and correct.&quot;

&quot;Only experience allows one to forge one&#x27;s own certainties, through trial and corrected error.&quot;

&quot;I always made sure that the bivouac spirit, that of being on the road and in the factory, prevailed over the high command of administrative offices.&quot;

&quot;To &quot;find&quot;, takes superior minds, because only superior minds are capable of surrounding themselves with other superior minds who in turn are likely to find.&quot;

&quot;Capitalism can only be justified to the extent that it leads to abundance.&quot;

&quot;There is no limit to the creation of value.&quot;

&quot;We learned it from experience: the smallest difference in quality is ultimately always noticed by the consumer.&quot;

&quot;The primacy of the consumer must be applied throughout an entire company.&quot;

&quot;The information gleaned about a market in a nascent state is of inestimable value because it has not yet been interpreted, and is therefore not distorted.&quot;

== Controversy ==
In 1989, the &quot;L&#x27;Oréal scandal&quot; erupted. Businessman Jean Frydman accused François Dalle of having forced him to resign from the management committee of Paravision, L&#x27;Oréal&#x27;s audiovisual subsidiary in which he held 25% of the shares. The reason for his ousting was allegedly to satisfy the demands of the Arab League, which was boycotting any company with direct or indirect links with Israel. The accusation turned into a State matter. Each party&#x27;s past came out, while L’Oréal was accused having been a refuge for ex-members of La Cagoule and former Second World War collaborators. François Mitterrand was accused of having interfered and lied on behalf of his friends François Dalle and André Bettencourt. The latter was later obliged to step down from leadership of the company after revelations about his past. On 20 November 1991, François Dalle was charged with document forgery and racial discrimination but the charges were later dismissed.

<text>Solomon Loeb (born Salomon Löb, June 29, 1828 – December 12, 1903) was a German-born American banker and businessman. He was a merchant in textiles and later a banker with Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co.

==Biography==
His father, a devout Jew, had been a small corn- and wine-dealer in Worms, which belonged to the Grand Duchy of Hesse and by Rhine. Solomon Loeb immigrated to the United States in 1849. He settled in Cincinnati with the textiles merchant Kuhn, Netter &amp; Co. He moved to New York City in 1865 and with his partner, Abraham Kuhn, started the banking house of Kuhn, Loeb and Co. His second born son, James Loeb, joined the bank in 1888 (and left in 1901). Solomon Loeb gradually retired from running the business but left Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co. only in 1899. He then started to move into the real estate business. In addition, he was also a generous philanthropist.

Among his donations was the Hebrew Charities Building that formerly stood at Second Avenue and 21st Street in New York City.

<text>James Loeb (; ; August 6, 1867 – May 27, 1933) was an American banker, Hellenist and philanthropist.

==Biography==
James Loeb, of German-Jewish descent, was the second son of Solomon Loeb and Betty Loeb. James Loeb joined his father at Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co. in 1888 and was made partner in 1894, but he retired from the bank in 1901 due to severe illness.

In memory of his former lecturer and friend Charles Eliot Norton, Loeb created The Charles Eliot Norton Memorial Lectureship in 1907. In 1911, he founded and endowed the Loeb Classical Library. He assembled a team of Anglo-American classicists to oversee the series, and arranged for publication through Heinemann (publisher) in London When James Loeb died, he bequeathed the Loeb Classical Library and funds to Harvard University to establish The Loeb Classical Library Foundation and to support research in the classics. 

He founded the Institute of Musical Art, which later became part of the Juilliard School of Music. That year he also turned over his collection of Arretine pottery to the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard.
He donated a large amount of funds to what is now called the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry, which helped his former psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin to establish and maintain the Institute in its early days. Nevertheless, presumably unknown to Loeb, Kraepelin held racist views about Jews, and his student who took over the Institute, Ernst Rudin, was a leading advocate of racial hygiene and forced sterilization or killing of psychiatric inpatients for which he was personally honoured by Adolf Hitler.

Loeb left a large portion of his significant art collection to the Museum Antiker Kleinkunst in Munich (today the Staatliche Antikensammlungen) (&quot;Sammlung James Loeb&quot;). He was a member of the English Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies.

Loeb&#x27;s correspondence with Aby Warburg has been characterized as creating a Renaissance of relationships of the European to classical antiquity.

<text>Charles Martin Tornov Loeffler (January 30, 1861 – May 19, 1935) was a German-born American violinist and composer.

==Family background==
Charles Martin Loeffler was born Martin Karl Löffler on January 30, 1861, in Schöneberg near Berlin to parents who were both from Berlin families. The family moved repeatedly, first to Alsace, and then to Smila, 200 km from Kyiv, while Loeffler was still a small child, next to Debrecen, in Hungary, where his father Karl taught at the Royal Academy of Agriculture. Later he lived in Switzerland.

Karl was an agricultural chemist who espoused republican ideals in writing as a journalist under the name &quot;Tornow&quot; or &quot;Tornov&quot;. When his son was about twelve years old, Prussian authorities arrested Karl Loeffler and he died of a stroke in prison. Throughout his career, Charles Martin Loeffler claimed to have been born in Mulhouse, Alsace; in his lifetime, articles were published dissecting his &quot;typically Alsatian&quot; temperament. He sometimes used his father&#x27;s pseudonyms as one of his middle names.

== Career ==
Loeffler decided to become a violinist and studied in Berlin with Joseph Joachim, Friedrich Kiel and Woldemar Bargiel, then with Joseph Massart (and composition with Ernest Guiraud) in Paris. He played with the Pasdeloup Orchestra and in 1881 emigrated to the United States, where he joined the Boston Symphony Orchestra as assistant concertmaster from 1882 to 1903. He was on the board of directors of the Boston Opera Company when it started operations in 1908.

He first appeared as a violinist-composer with the orchestra in 1891 with the performance of his suite &quot;Les Vieilles d&#x27;Ukraine&quot;, and his works were performed regularly by the Boston Symphony (and by other American orchestra) for the rest of his life.

Loeffler became a U.S. citizen in 1887 and eventually resigned from the orchestra to devote himself to composition. He was a friend of Eugène Ysaÿe, Dennis Miller Bunker, and John Singer Sargent (who painted his portrait), also of Gabriel Fauré and Ferruccio Busoni (both of whom dedicated works to him), and later of George Gershwin. A man of wide culture and refined taste, he developed an idiom deeply influenced by contemporary French and Russian music, in the traditions of César Franck, Ernest Chausson and Claude Debussy, and also by Symbolist and &quot;decadent&quot; literature. Loeffler often cultivated unusual combinations of instruments, and was one of the earliest modern enthusiasts for the viola d&#x27;amore, which he discovered in 1894 and wrote parts for in several scores as well as arranging much music for it. In his later years he also, unexpectedly, became deeply interested in jazz, and wrote some works for jazz band.

His notable students include Arthur Hartmann, Kay Swift, Samuel Gardner and Francis Judd Cooke, who studied with him for two years in Medfield, Massachusetts. Loeffler died in 1935 in Medfield, at the age of 74.

== Works ==
Loeffler was a fastidious composer who composed carefully, frequently revising his compositions. Some of his works are lost. His best-known works include the symphonic poems &quot;La Mort de Tintagiles&quot; (after Maeterlinck), &quot;La Bonne Chanson&quot; (after Verlaine), &quot;A Pagan Poem&quot; (after Virgil), and &quot;Memories of My Childhood (Life in a Russian Village)&quot;, as well as the song-cycle &quot;Five Irish Fantasies&quot; (to words by W. B. Yeats and Heffernan), and the chamber works &quot;Music for Four Stringed Instruments&quot; and &quot;Two Rhapsodies&quot; for oboe, viola and piano. The Music for Four Stringed Instruments was written in 1917 after his friend John Jay Chapman&#x27;s son Victor became the first American aviator to die in World War I. Chapman published his son&#x27;s letters in 1917 and Loeffler was inspired to write this string quartet as a combination meditation and memorial.

His &quot;Divertissement&quot; for violin and orchestra was premiered in Berlin in 1905 by Karel Halíř, under the baton of Richard Strauss, at the same concert at which Halíř premiered the revised version of Sibelius&#x27;s Violin Concerto. Fritz Kreisler and Eugène Ysaÿe had declined to play the &quot;Divertissement&quot; because of its technical demands.

He composed the Fantastic Concert for cello and orchestra, which premiered in 1894 with Alwin Schroeder as soloist with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and the Entertainment for violin and orchestra (1895).

He composed the symphonic poem &quot;La Villanelle du Diable&quot; in 1901. This work is inspired by the eponymous poem by Rollinat, and dedicated to Franz Kneisel. It was premiered in April 1902 by the Boston Symphony Orchestra under Wilhelm Gericke, and published by Schirmer in 1905. He later reworked the piece for orchestra and organ; this version was performed by the BSO in January 1910.

<text>Ammi-Saduqa (or Ammisaduqa, Ammizaduga) was a king of the First Dynasty of Babylon, dating to around c. 1646–1626 BC (Middle Chronology) or c. 1638–1618 BC (Low Middle Chronology).

==Reign==
Some twenty-one year-names survive for his reign, including the first seventeen. The names indicate that these years were fairly peaceful ones for the kingdom of Ammi-Saduqa, who was primarily engaged in enriching and enlarging the temples, and a few other building projects, such as building a wall at the mouth of the Euphrates in his eleventh regnal year.

<text>Friedrich August Johannes Loeffler (; 24 June 18529 April 1915) was a German bacteriologist at the University of Greifswald.

==Biography==
He obtained his M.D. degree from the University of Berlin in 1874. He worked with Robert Koch from 1879 to 1884 as an assistant in the Imperial Health Office in Berlin. In 1884, he became staff physician at the Friedrich Wilhelm Institute in Berlin, and four years later became professor at the University of Greifswald.

His development of original methods of staining rendered an important and lasting service to bacteriology. Early in his career, he began a study of parasitic diseases. Among his discoveries was the organism causing diphtheria (&quot;Corynebacterium diphtheriae&quot;) and the cause of foot-and-mouth disease (Aphthovirus). His description of the diphtheria bacillus, published in 1884, was the originating cause of an antitoxin treatment. He also created Löffler&#x27;s serum, a coagulated blood serum used for the detection of the bacteria. In 1887, he founded the &quot;Centralblatt für Bakteriologie und Parasitenkunde&quot;.

The Friedrich Loeffler Institute on the Isle of Riems near Greifswald, as well as the Friedrich Loeffler Institute of Medical Microbiology at the Greifswald Medical School of the University of Greifswald, have been named in his honor.

<text>The Second Battle of Sirte (on 22 March 1942) was a naval engagement in the Mediterranean Sea, north of the Gulf of Sidra and south-east of Malta, during the Second World War. The escorting warships of a British convoy to Malta held off a much more powerful squadron of the (Italian Navy). The British convoy was composed of four merchant ships, escorted by four light cruisers, one anti-aircraft cruiser and 17 destroyers. The Italian force comprised a battleship, two heavy cruisers, one light cruiser and ten destroyers. Despite the British success at warding off the Italian squadron, the Italian fleet attack delayed the convoy&#x27;s planned arrival before dawn, which exposed it to intense air attacks that sank all four merchant ships and one of the escorting destroyers in the following days.

==Background==

===Malta===

Up to the end of 1941, with of cargo had reached Malta without loss and a reserve of seven months&#x27; supplies had been accumulated. Three convoys to Malta in 1941 suffered the loss of only one merchant ship. From January 1941 to August 1942, ships had delivered but had been sunk and modern, efficient merchant ships, naval and air forces had been diverted from other routes for long periods; 31 supply runs by submarines had been conducted. Reinforcements for Malta included and dangerous aircraft carrier ferry operations to deliver fighters. Malta was also a base for air, sea and submarine operations against Axis supply convoys and from 1 June to 31 October 1941, British forces sank about of Axis shipping on the African convoy routes, by the navy and by the Royal Air Force (RAF) and Fleet Air Arm (FAA). Loaded ships sailing to Africa accounted for 90 per cent of the ships sunk and Malta-based squadrons were responsible for about 75 per cent of the ships sunk by aircraft. Military operations from Malta and using the island as a staging post, led to Axis air campaigns against the island in 1941 and 1942..
By early 1942 the Allies had lost the initiative in the central Mediterranean as Italian and German forces isolated Malta and made plans to remove it as a threat. After a series of Allied defeats, the Italian Navy achieved naval superiority in the central Mediterranean by spring 1942. As Malta was running short of aircraft, anti-aircraft guns, fuel, food and ammunition, convoy MW10 sailed from Alexandria on 21 March. The British expected opposition from German and Italian aircraft as well as Italian surface units. In December 1941, the two battleships ( and ) stationed in the eastern Mediterranean had been disabled by an attack by Italian frogmen, leaving the fleet with only cruisers and destroyers. A diversion was organised from Gibraltar, on the morning of 20 March, the battleship —with the aircraft carriers and , supported by the cruiser and eight destroyers—sailed. The next day, the squadron aborted the operation and returned to port—the carriers were unable to launch aircraft reinforcements to Malta due to defective long-range fuel tanks. The escort of convoy MW10 relied on destroyers—including lighter-built destroyer escorts—to provide anti-submarine protection and included the anti-aircraft cruiser . More destroyers and another light cruiser were sent from Malta.

==British plan==
Admiral Sir Philip Vian, commanding the convoy, organised his ships into six divisions plus a close escort of five Hunt-class destroyers for the convoy 
* 1st Division: destroyers , , and 
* 2nd Division: light cruisers and with the destroyer 
* 3rd Division: destroyers and 
* 4th Division: light cruisers (flagship) and 
* 5th Division: destroyers , , and 
* 6th Division: anti-aircraft cruiser and Hunt-class destroyer 

In case of an Italian surface attack, the first five divisions were to stand off from the convoy to face the enemy while the sixth division laid smoke across the wake of the convoy to obscure it. The first five divisions would act as a rearguard to lay smoke and delay the while &quot;Carlisle&quot; and the Hunt-class destroyers proceeded with the cargo ships to Malta.

==Battle==

At 14:30 the next day, the British were faced by a pair of heavy cruisers and escorting destroyers. Admiral Vian immediately implemented his plan; the cargo ships and escorts turned away to the south while the light cruisers and remaining destroyers laid smoke and charged the Italians. After an exchange of fire, the two Italian heavy cruisers backed off in an attempt to lure the British toward the incoming main Italian squadron, and at 16:37 they returned to attack with the battleship , a light cruiser and their screening destroyers. The battle raged for two and a half hours, with the British ships leaving the safety of their huge smoke screen to fire a few volleys and then returning to it when the Italian salvos got too close.

During one of these exchanges, suffered severre damage from a near-miss when fired at by the Italian battleship &quot;Littorio&quot;, and was ordered to withdraw from the battle line and join the convoy. At 18:34, Vian decided to send his destroyers in to launch torpedo attacks from about , the closest the Italians would allow the British to approach. None of the torpedoes found their targets but as turned she was hit by a round that penetrated her boiler room and ignited a fire, temporarily bringing her to a halt. The battle began with a wind blowing to the north-west, with the wind continuing to increase during the day, which favoured the gunnery of the larger Italian ships throughout the battle but aided the laying of smokescreens by Vian&#x27;s ships.

 was struck by shell splinters from the battleship&#x27;s main guns that pierced a bulkhead, causing some flooding but no casualties. At 18:55, &quot;Littorio&quot; had been hit by a 4.7 in (120 mm) shell, with negligible damage. Her floatplane caught fire from the blast from a salvo of her after turret at the same time; this led to the claim by the British that one of the torpedoes had struck. At dusk, before 19:00, the Italians gave up and turned for home; without radar they would have been at a significant disadvantage in a night action, as in the Battle of Cape Matapan. The Italians outgunned their British counterparts but appeared unwilling to close for a decisive blow, perhaps wary of the torpedo threat from the many British destroyers.

==Aftermath==

===Analysis===

Almost all authors have called the battle as a British victory, credited to the escort of light cruisers and destroyers which prevented the Italians from damaging the convoy, by repulsing an Italian squadron composed of a battleship and two heavy cruisers during massed Axis air attacks. Some authors, while generally acknowledging the British success, write of the battle as a partial Italian achievement in delaying and turning the convoy aside. Nearly all sources agree that the Italian fleet inflicted significant damage and several casualties on the British squadron while suffering minimal damage and no casualties in return. Axis aircraft caught the British convoy at sea and chased the surviving steamers to the harbour; more than 80 per cent of the supplies were lost, making the British convoy operation a strategic failure.

===Battle damage===
According to British reports, &quot; was struck on the after part of the bridge at 16:44&quot; by a hit from the light cruiser ; 16 seamen were killed. According to Admiral Iachino, the hit was instead achieved by &quot;Littorio&quot;&#x27;s secondary guns, based on the range between the opposite warships at the time. Cruisers and were also damaged, with &quot;Euryalus&quot; straddled by &quot;Littorio&quot; at 16:43 and at 18:41. &quot;Kingston&quot; was hit amidships by a shell from &quot;Littorio&quot; that killed 15 men of her crew. and left the destroyer dead in the water, with her starboard whaleboat torn apart, her anti-aircraft guns, searchlight tower and torpedo launchers shattered by the explosion. Some sources claim that she was hit by the guns of the heavy cruiser .

Although &quot;Kingston&quot; had an engine in flames and a flooded boiler, she managed to get back up to speed, reaching Malta the next day. &quot;Havock&quot; was also badly damaged in a boiler by a near miss from &quot;Littorio&quot; at 17:20; eight sailors died. &quot;Lively&quot; was forced to retreat to Tobruk for repairs at 18:55, after a near miss&#x27; splinter from &quot;Littorio&quot;″s aft turret holed her hull, resulting in some flooding. Three more destroyers—, and —suffered lesser damage from cruiser fire. The Italian fleet expended 1,511 rounds of all calibres upon the British squadron; the only Italian destroyer to open fire was . The British cruisers had replied with 1,553 rounds and the destroyers with about 1,300 rounds as well as 38 torpedoes. Axis aircraft made continual attacks, mainly against the convoy, throughout the naval action and Royal Navy AA gunners claimed the destruction of seven Axis aircraft and damage to several more.

===Subsequent operations===
Most of the escort force, short of fuel and ammunition and unable to find the convoy, turned back for Alexandria. The damaged destroyers and the cargo ships were sent on to Malta, with &quot;Carlisle&quot;, &quot;Penelope&quot; and &quot;Legion&quot;. The next day, they were subjected to continuous air attacks. The cargo ship was sunk from harbour and the oil tanker was too damaged to reach Valletta.

The merchantmen, &quot;Talabot&quot; and steamer &quot;Pampas&quot;, reached Grand Harbour virtually unharmed. &quot;Pampas&quot; had been hit by two bombs but these failed to explode. &quot;Penelope&quot; attempted to tow &quot;Breconshire&quot;, but the tow parted in heavy seas. She anchored short of the protective minefields and the destroyer &quot;Southwold&quot; attempted to take her in tow, hitting a mine in the process. She was eventually towed into Marsaxlokk Bay by tugs.

Axis air raids against Malta on 24 and 25 March failed to damage the three surviving convoy ships. On 26 March, German dive bombers hit all three ships, sinking &quot;Talabot&quot; and &quot;Pampas&quot; that day with &quot;Breconshire&quot; capsizing on 27 March. Much of &quot;Breconshire&quot;′s oil was salvaged through the hole in her hull. Only about of cargo had been unloaded, of the that had been loaded in Alexandria. The Italian fleet units were no luckier after the battle. After failing to destroy the convoy, they were caught &quot;en route&quot; to their bases by a severe storm that sank the destroyers and . While under repair in dry dock at Malta, &quot;Kingston&quot; was attacked a few days later by German aircraft and suffered further damage, this time beyond repair. She was scrapped &quot;in situ&quot; in the following months.

Whilst docked at Malta, &quot;Havock&quot;, was a target for Axis aircraft and sustained further damage. On 3 April the ship was ordered to Gibraltar before her repairs were complete. &quot;Havock&quot; ran aground off Kelibia, Tunisia, in the Strait of Sicily on 6 April and was wrecked, with one crewman killed in the incident. Another one died from wounds in the following days. On 8 April an Italian boarding party from the tug &quot;Instancabile&quot; (former Royal Yugoslav Navy &quot;Spasilac&quot;) searched the wreck looking for secret information. &quot;Havock&quot;&#x27;s crew and passengers were interned by the Vichy French at Laghouat in the Sahara but were released in November as a result of Operation Torch.

* &quot;The Ship&quot; (1943) by C. S. Forester is a fictionalised account of the battle, seeing the action through the eyes of the crew of a Royal Navy light cruiser &quot;HMS &quot;Artemis&quot;&quot; (it is dedicated to &quot;the officers and ship&#x27;s company of H.M.S. &quot;Penelope&quot;&quot;). It depicts the Italians as inept and cowardly, even though deploying a superior force of &quot;two&quot; battleships, three heavy and four light cruisers; but it seems fairly accurate on the action (while overstating the accuracy of British fire) and gives an excellent account of the roles of different crew members. Published in 1943, the novel did have a propaganda/morale-raising aspect, stressing that everyone&#x27;s efforts were important, and not mentioning the loss of merchant ships afterwards. Forester, best known for his Hornblower R.N. novels, sailed with both the British and American navies during the Second World War to gather material.

<doc id="1175340" wikidata="Q6877446" url="?curid=1175340" title="Miss Susie">
<text>&quot;Miss Susie&quot;, also known as &quot;Hello Operator&quot;, &quot;Miss Suzy&quot;, &quot;Miss Lucy&quot;, and many other names, is the name of an American schoolyard rhyme in which each verse leads up to a rude word or profanity which is revealed in the next verse as part of an innocuous word or phrase. Originally used as a jump-rope rhyme, it is now more often sung alone or as part of a clapping game. Hand signs sometimes accompany the song, such as pulling on the bell in the first verse or making a phone gesture in the second.

This song is sometimes combined or confused with &quot;Miss Lucy had a baby&quot;, which is sung to the same tune and also served as a jump-rope song. That song developed from verses of much older (and cruder) songs which were most commonly known as &quot;Bang Bang Rosie&quot; in Britain, &quot;Bang Away Lulu&quot; in Appalachia, and &quot;My Lula Gal&quot; in the West. The variants including a woman with an alligator purse urging the baby&#x27;s mother to vote have been seen as a reference to Susan B. Anthony, an American suffragette and wife, and may be responsible for the steamboat owner&#x27;s most common name today.

== Structure ==
The rhyme is arranged in quatrains, with an ABCB rhyme scheme. The rhyme is organized by its meter, a sprung rhythm in trimeter. Accentual verse (including sprung rhythm) is a common form in English folk verse, including nursery rhymes and jump-rope rhymes. The rhyme approaches taboo words, only to cut them off and modify them with an enjambment. It shares much of the same melody as the 1937 &quot;The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down&quot; used by Warner Bros. as the theme to their &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; cartoons.

== History ==

The song has developed many variations over an extended period, as is common for such rhymes. Even 21st-century versions, however, typically preserve long-outdated references to the dangerousness of 19th-century steamers and to the need for a switchboard operator to manually connect a telephone call.

The earliest recorded version—about a girl named Mary—appears among the vaudeville jokes collected by Ed Lowry during his career in the 1910s, &#x27;20s, and &#x27;30s, although versions about Robert Fulton, inventor of the steamboat) and Lulu (the star of &quot;Bang Bang Lulu&quot;) may record older traditions. The Lulu tradition—including &quot;Miss Lucy had a baby&quot;—already record enjambed double entendres during the World Wars, but the first version of this song known to have done so—versions about Fulton and a girl named Helen—date to the 1950s.

Later versions developed by embellishment: adding, removing, and adjusting stanzas involving kissing, boys in bathrooms, a little black boy, bras, King Arthur, questions and lies, German spies, raving aunts, and so forth. While the initial stanzas were fairly stable by the late 20th century, the folklorist Josepha Sherman noted that two unrelated children in 1990s New York took the change from &quot;Miss Lucy&quot; to &quot;Ms. Lucy&quot; for granted. An adaptation—&quot;Miss Lucy had some leeches&quot;—has been recorded by Emilie Autumn and another—&quot;Mrs. Landers was a health nut&quot;—featured in the &quot;South Park&quot; episode &quot;Something You Can Do with Your Finger&quot;.

<text>The Empire Poetry League was a British-based organisation founded in 1917, with an effective existence of about 15 years. Initially having a patriotic impetus, and counting a number of leading literary figures among its supporters — G. K. Chesterton, Humbert Wolfe, L. A. G. Strong and the novelists H. E. Bates and A. G. Street (1892–1966) — as members, it shortly became a vehicle for Sydney Fowler Wright (1874–1965), now remembered mainly for 
his genre fiction.

The League, through Fowler&#x27;s small press, the Merton Press, was active in the 1920s in producing anthologies of regional verse of the United Kingdom, usually tied to a single county. It also, true to its name, published early collections from elsewhere in the British Empire: a 1921 anthology &quot;Voices From Summerland&quot; compiled by J. E. Clare McFarlane in Jamaica, and a series of &quot;Dominion and Colonial Verse&quot; collections. The League&#x27;s magazine, &quot;Poetry and the Play&quot; (initially &quot;Poetry&quot;), ran from 1917 to 1932, when the League foundered. The Jamaica Poetry Society, formally a branch, persisted into the 1950s.

The work of the League in publishing new poets made few reputations, and Wright was outspoken against free verse. The most clear exception, to both of those, was the way in which Wright championed Olaf Stapledon from 1923; though some have discounted this as more tactical than convinced on Wright&#x27;s part.

<doc id="1175361" wikidata="Q482530" url="?curid=1175361" title="Hyundai Elantra">
<text>The Hyundai Elantra (), also known as the Hyundai Avante (), is a compact car produced by the South Korean manufacturer Hyundai since 1990. The Elantra was initially marketed as the &quot;Lantra&quot; in Australia and some European markets. In Australia, this was due to the similarly named Mitsubishi Magna Elante model; similarly, in other markets, the name Avante is not used due to its similarity with Audi&#x27;s &quot;Avant&quot; designation, which is used for their line-up of station wagons. The name was standardized as &quot;Elantra&quot; worldwide in 2001 (except in South Korea, Singapore and Russia).


== First generation (J1; 1990) ==

The Elantra (codename &quot;J1&quot;) was launched in October 1990, and received a mid-term facelift in 1993.

It was sold in Europe from the spring of 1991. It replaced the somewhat larger on the outside Stellar, although that model had not been offered in many markets. The Elantra competed with the likes of the Ford Sierra and Vauxhall Cavalier/Opel Vectra, but at a considerably lower price.

The Elantra was powered by a Mitsubishi-designed 1.6 L (1595 cc) straight-four. This DOHC 16-valve 1.6 L unit produced at 6000 rpm and could push the Elantra to in 9.5 seconds. The quarter-mile (0.4 km) run took 17.1 seconds and produced . Top speed was . The Elantra got in the city cycle. Starting in 1993 a Mitsubishi-designed 1.8 L (1836 cc) inline-four option was available; this unit produces at 6000 rpm and replaced the twin-cam 1.6 in the home market.

=== Facelifts ===
The vehicle featured ABS brakes, front airbags, fog lamps, power-operated side mirrors, and optional alloy seven-spoke wheels.

Between 1995 and 1998, the first-generation Elantra was also produced and sold for the Indonesian market as the Bimantara Nenggala, it is only available in there with 1.6 L engine.

== Second generation (J2/RD; 1995) ==
The second generation (codename &quot;RD&quot; or &quot;J2&quot;) was launched in 1995, offered as a sedan and station wagon. It was sold in the South Korean market as the &quot;Hyundai Avante&quot; in sedan form and &quot;Avante Touring&quot; in the wagon body style. Some export markets such as Australia and Europe received the series as the &quot;Hyundai Lantra&quot; as per the first generation. Australian market wagons were given the &quot;Lantra Sportswagon&quot; name.

=== Facelift ===
New grilles arrived in 1998 for the 1999 model year. The Lantra in Europe converged into a single-front end design, for both sedan and wagon. The model received the &quot;RD2&quot; or &quot;J3&quot; model codes. A PSA-built 1.9 L naturally-aspired diesel option was also added for some European markets, producing .

A new 2.0 L engine option became available. In Australia, the GLS model was an upgrade on the GL model and offered the 2.0 L engine, velour trim, softer cloth seats, and alloy wheels. The GLS had body-coloured rear license plate light holder and exterior side-view mirrors.

== Third generation (XD; 2000) ==
An all-new model (codename &quot;XD&quot;) was launched in 2000. The station wagon version was dropped in favor of a five-door Liftback. Starting in 2001, all American models came with standard front and front-side airbags, air conditioning, power locks, power windows, and power steering. This simplified dealer inventories and repairs and also sought to improve Hyundai&#x27;s image of &quot;value&quot; cars.

=== Pre-facelift ===
=== Facelift ===
In 2004, all models were refreshed (codename &quot;XD2&quot;); this introduced new headlights and tail lights, a new grille, updated front and rear bumpers with a split lower grille, a redesigned hood and trunk lid, and a redesigned dashboard that added more functionality.The GLS trim was the base model standard for the Elantra. The top-of-the-line model, the GT trim, came with a stiffer suspension, leather seats, fog lights, alloy wheels, lip spoiler, and blue-lit instrument cluster. Offered as a Liftback since 2001 as a 2002 model year vehicle, the only options for the GT were a power moonroof and anti-lock brakes with traction control. The only major option was a Kenwood MP3/CD deck. The GT trim sedan was introduced in 2003 and discontinued in 2005. The GT trim was replaced for the 2006 model year with the Limited trim, which featured new paint colours, a chrome vertical grille, leather interior with leather steering wheel and leather shifter and wood trim. The Limited trim featured steel rims with a 6-spoke cover featured in the GLS model. The GT trim for the five-door was produced for the remainder of the 2006 model year.

Canadian trim levels differed from that in the US: &quot;GT&quot; models came standard with alloy wheels, four-wheel disc brakes and ABS. Leather upholstery and TCS were only available on the &quot;premium&quot; GT edition.

The XD was available with 1.6-, 1.8- and 2.0-litre petrol engines and a 2.0-litre turbo-diesel. North American models are available only with the 2.0-litre petrol engine. The 1.8-litre engine is a 1.6-litre engine modified for the New Zealand market.

While compact on the outside, it was listed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency as a mid-size car because of a spacious interior. Although the basic powertrain design had changed little since the second generation, fuel economy improved for Elantras with manual transmissions from an EPA city rating of , and further to in 2006. Cars with automatic transmissions returned , a reduction of .Horsepower improved from , and torque from 132 to 136, mainly due to the addition of continuously variable valve timing (CVVT) in 2004. Originally, the horsepower rating was misrepresented as . In 2006, the Elantra was offered with a SULEV emission rated engine in some US states.

In China, the Elantra XD was produced by Beijing Hyundai from 23 December 2003 to 2011. This car has been used as a taxicab in Beijing since 2005 and replaced the popular red Tianjin Xiali taxi in 2006 in an effort to cut down pollution. The Elantra is available in 5 door Liftback for 2007 and sedan form from 2003 to 2010. Pre facelifted models of the Elantra XD were produced for the 2004 model year and had a facelift in 2007 consisting of new headlights, radiator, rear foglights on the rear bumper, and new wheels. Production ran up to 2010. It was facelifted again for the 2011 model year featuring new front and rear lights, bumpers, a single rear bumper fog light, radiator and power-folding mirrors with integrated turn signals. A 1.6-litre engine is available on taxi and passenger cars paired with a 5-speed manual gearbox. A 1.8-litre engine was available until 2007.

=== Engines ===


== Fourth generation (HD; 2006) ==

A redesigned sedan (designated &quot;HD&quot;) debuted at the 2006 New York International Auto Show for the 2007 model year. As before, the HD was sold under the Hyundai Avante name in its South Korean home market. It had a more rounded, jelly bean-like design used in the US in the 1990s.

The engine lineup included 1.6- &quot;Gamma&quot; and 2.0 L &quot;Beta II&quot; petrol inline-four engines, and a 1.6 L turbodiesel inline-four. All engines featured improved fuel economy. A five-speed manual transmission was standard with an optional four-speed automatic.

According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) the Elantra received a &quot;Good&quot; overall score in the frontal crash test and a &quot;Marginal&quot; overall score in the side impact test, but all Hyundai Elantras manufactured after November 2009 earned a &quot;Good&quot; overall score in the side impact test. Standard side airbags included front and rear head curtain airbags and front seat-mounted torso airbags.

=== China ===
Beijing Hyundai launched a redesigned Elantra called the &quot;Elantra Yue Dong&quot; for the Chinese market with an updated exterior and a separate facelifted 2011 Elantra model. The model was later updated in 2017 and is currently known as the Hyundai Celesta.

=== North America ===
Only the 2.0 L engine was offered in North America. Unlike the 2006 model year XD series, the 2007 model year base Hyundai Elantra GLS trim did not include air conditioning as standard equipment, but added side curtain airbags (previously front and side only), active head restraints and all-round disc brakes with four-channel ABS. The Elantra offered the most interior room in its class, leading the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to classify it as a mid-size car.

Hyundai offered the Hyundai i30 wagon in the U.S. and Canada marketed as the &quot;Elantra Touring&quot;. Elsewhere, the same vehicle was marketed as the Hyundai i30cw.
* 2008 model year: the &quot;Limited&quot; trim level was dropped, leaving &quot;GLS&quot; and &quot;SE&quot; trim choices. The SE trim included features not available on the &quot;GLS&quot; such as a telescopic steering wheel and electronic stability control (ESC), with sunroof and leather upholstery as options. According to &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; testing, the &quot;SE&quot; trim has significantly better handling and braking than the base &quot;GLS&quot; trim.
* 2009 model year: iPod and USB interfaces became standard on the &quot;SE&quot; models. On the instrument panel, the gear shift indicator moved to the trip computer display, and the coolant temperature gauge was removed. &quot;GLS&quot; models received new wheel cover designs, and &quot;SE&quot; models had a rear garnish on the rear registration plate border. Exterior colour choices now included &quot;Natural Khaki&quot;. The 2009 model year was J.D. Power&#x27;s highest quality compact car. The study measured 228 attributes, including overall driving experience, engine and transmission, and a broad range of defect and design problems reported by vehicle owners. The 2008, 2009 and 2010 Elantra SE was consistently chosen as a &quot;Top Pick&quot; for compact sedans by &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; magazine.
* 2010 model year: a new &quot;Blue&quot; trim was added, a basic model modified for increased fuel economy. The grille design was slightly modified and &quot;Blue&quot; and &quot;GLS&quot; models received chrome rear garnish. The interior received chrome door handles, new metallic interior finish, cup holders, and a chrome-trimmed gear selector for &quot;SE&quot; models. On &quot;GLS&quot; and &quot;SE&quot; models automatic transmission became standard, while the lesser &quot;Blue&quot; models only offered manual. The &quot;GLS&quot; offered sunroof or an LG navigation system; &quot;SE&quot; included a choice of two packages: a sunroof with heated seats or a sunroof with heated seats, LG navigation and Bluetooth. iPod and USB connectivity became standard on the &quot;GLS&quot; and available on the &quot;Blue&quot;. Exterior colour choices were slightly changed, with &quot;Nordic White&quot; and &quot;Black Noir Pearl&quot; replacing the &quot;Captiva White&quot; and &quot;Black Pearl&quot;, respectively; &quot;Purple Rain&quot; was deleted.

Canadian trim levels were different from the US models. The base model &quot;L&quot; offered a base package with a four-speaker CD/MP3/Auxiliary stereo and front airbags. This trim included power windows in the front with manual windows in the rear. The &quot;GL&quot; added heated mirrors, air conditioning, power windows, heated seats, a six-speaker stereo, wheel-mounted cruise control, and keyless entry with alarm. The &quot;GLS&quot; trim added wheel-mounted audio controls, ABS, all-round disc brakes, and front seat-mounted side-impact and roof-mounted side curtain airbags. The &quot;GLS&quot; with the &quot;Sport Package&quot; included a rear spoiler, power sunroof, 16-inch alloy wheels, fog lamps, trip computer and a leather-wrapped steering wheel and leather shifter. The final trim level, the &quot;Limited&quot;, added leather seats, a telescopic steering wheel, and automatic climate control air conditioning.

=== LPI Hybrid ===
Hyundai presented the LPI Hybrid at the 2009 Seoul Motor Show, and sales began as the Avante &quot;LPI Hybrid&quot; in the South Korean market in July 2009. The LPI Hybrid (liquefied petroleum injected) is a mild hybrid and is the world&#x27;s first hybrid electric vehicle to be powered by an internal combustion engine built to run on liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) as a fuel. Hyundai developed the technology and all key components in the LPI Hybrid, together with its local partners including the electric motor, battery and low DC/DC converter. The lithium-ion polymer batteries, which the LPI Hybrid was the first hybrid to adopt, differed from lithium-ion batteries, using a claimedly more stable and fire-resistant dry polymer electrolyte from Korean company LG Chem instead of a liquid or gel.

The LPI Hybrid came equipped with the 1.6 L &quot;Gamma&quot; engine, a electric motor, and a continuously variable transmission (CVT). The LPI Hybrid delivered . Compared to the conventional 1.6 L model, and considering South Korean petrol prices, the LPI Hybrid can travel for the price of one litre of petrol, while the conventional model would be able to travel only . The engine emitted 99 g/km of , which allows the car to qualify as a Super Ultra Low Emission Vehicle (SULEV). The LPI Hybrid produced 90 percent fewer emissions than an equivalent standard petrol powered model, and LPG is a low carbon emitting hydrocarbon fuel that burns more cleanly than either petrol or diesel, and also is free of the particulates associated with diesel. The LPI Hybrid shares its powertrain with the Kia Forte LPI Hybrid.

The Elantra hybrid comes with an &quot;Eco Guide&quot; tree icon meant to coach the driver into developing more eco driving habits. The CVT has an optional &quot;E (Eco-Drive)&quot; gear to maximize fuel efficiency. The LPG Hybrid was dropped in Australia due to lack of demand, increase in emphasis on brand image and change in focus to cleaner diesel engines.

== Fifth generation (MD/UD/JK; 2010) ==

The fifth-generation Avante debuted at the 2010 Busan International Motor Show in April 2010. It was codenamed &quot;MD&quot; for the sedan, &quot;UD&quot; for sedans manufactured in the US, and &quot;JK&quot; for the coupe. For the U.S. and Canadian market, it featured a new 1.8-L petrol engine. In other markets, it featured a 1.6-L petrol direct-injection engine, producing and 167 Nm (123 lb-ft) torque, mated to a new 6-speed automatic or manual transmission. For markets such as the Middle East, the 1.6-L engine was a MPI version that delivers 128 hp. The Israeli market received the Elantra, with a 1.6 GDI 132 hp coupled to a 6-speed automatic transmission only. The design continued Hyundai&#x27;s &quot;fluidic sculpture&quot; styling theme first seen in the 2011 Sonata. The new model went on sale in August 2010 in South Korea, and began selling between end of 2010 and early 2011 as a 2011 model. The US version of the fifth-generation Elantra debuted at the 2010 Los Angeles Auto Show. It is powered by a new 1.8-L Nu engine producing 148 hp (145 hp-PZEV) and 131 lb-ft (130 lb-ft-PZEV). The fuel economy was aided by a low drag coefficient of just 0.28. The Nu engine block is made of aluminum instead of the previous cast iron.

EPA&#x27;s estimated gas mileage 40/29 was questioned by Consumer Watchdog, a Santa Monica CA consumer group. USA Today writer Jefferson Graham claimed to get combined city/highway mpg of 22 mpg. However, a real-world test by &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; showed significantly better fuel economy than EPA estimated MPG. Also, The Truth About Cars editor tested real-world MPG, leading them to give Consumer Watchdog a thumbs down. EPA mileage estimates were originally in the city and on the highway but were revised to in the city and on the highway due to a series of testing procedural errors in November 2012. The underpinnings of the second-generation i30 and Elantra were similar in their configuration and makeup. The similarities between the second-generation i30 and Elantra continued in front end and suspension characteristics.

It was available in two trim levels, GLS and Limited. Premium features included heated front and rear seats, proximity key entry with electronic push-button start with immobilizer, and touch screen navigation. US 2011 sales reached 186,361 units, up 41 percent from 2010. The Elantra was crowned North American Car of the Year at the 2012 Detroit Auto Show, over the Ford Focus and Volkswagen Passat. The Elantra was crowned South African Car of the Year for 2012. At the 8th Manila International Auto Show, the Elantra was crowned as the Philippine Car of the Year, the first Korean car maker to win the award.

== Sixth generation (AD; 2015) ==

The sixth generation Elantra was launched in South Korea as the Avante in September 2015. The design of the car was resculpted to a more conservative appearance compared to the previous generation. The &quot;fluidic sculpture&quot; design that had persisted across the Hyundai portfolio since 2011 was reshaped with the sixth generation Elantra. The car is now more like a fastback with its roofline sloped from the windshield to the rear of the car and it has fewer curves overall with pentagonal head and taillights, a hexagonal grille, and redesigned body panels and bumper emphasizing straight lines along the body. The windshield is drawn back from the hood further than the prior generation, making for a more traditional sedan look. The interior is also less curved, with a cockpit, audio/temp controls, and glove compartment in a single bow line across the dash. This was done without reducing the interior cabin space of the prior generation.

In India, the AD series Hyundai Elantra launched on 23 August 2016 with petrol and diesel engine options. Its petrol variant displaces 2.0-litre, while the diesel engine is a 1.6-litre unit.

In the Philippines, the AD model Elantra was launched in 2016. It is available in GL (6-speed manual and 6-speed automatic options) and GLS (6-speed automatic) trims. It is powered by 1.6-litre engine for the former and 2.0-litre engine for the latter. The AD model Elantra was discontinued in late 2020.

For China, the Elantra AD model known as the Elantra Lingdong was introduced in March 2016. It is available with the 1.4 litre turbo, the 1.5 litre &quot;Smartstream&quot; engine specifically for its market, and the 1.6 litre &quot;Gamma II&quot; engine. A 7 speed dual clutch option is available as standard for the 1.4, a 6 speed manual option is available as standard for the 1.5 and 1.6 litre models alongside an optional CVT for the 1.5 and a 6 speed automatic for the 1.6. Pricing ranges from 109,800 yuan to 146,800 yuan.

=== North America ===
The sixth generation Elantra made its North American debut at the November 2015 Los Angeles Auto Show for the 2017 model year, and released for sale in the United States in January 2016, and in Canada in February 2016. Two trim levels are present in the 2017 model release: SE and Limited (Value Edition and Sport released later). While the Elantra is sold under the compact class, it classifies as a mid-size sedan according to the EPA.

Newly introduced for 2017 was the ECO Trim, a package which replaced the standard engine with a lower displacement turbocharged 1.4 L DOHC Inline-4, &quot;Kappa&quot; engine along with a 7-speed dual clutch automatic transmission that improved MPG use for eco driving customers.

The new SE model came standard with fewer features compared to the prior generation trim level, and included a 2.0 L &quot;Nu&quot; I4 engine and mated to either a 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmission. The SE Popular Equipment package which included alloy wheels, cruise control, automatic headlights, and touchscreen stereo with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay support; and a Tech Package (required the Popular Equipment package) included LED daytime running lights, blind-spot and rear cross-traffic alert system, proximity key/push-button start, hands-free trunk access, and TFT monochromatic cluster display (in place of the standard LCD cluster). In North America, the SE Popular Equipment package was not available on SE models with the 6-speed manual transmission.

In the middle of the 2017 model year, steering wheel audio controls become standard equipment across all trims. A mid-level Value Edition trim was also added. On top of the Popular Equipment and Tech Package for the SE, it included a power-adjustable driver&#x27;s seat, auto-dimming rearview mirror, a power sunroof, and an automatic up driver&#x27;s power window.

Packages for the Limited Edition includes a Limited Tech Package with a power sunroof, touchscreen stereo with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay support, heated seats, and ClariFi module to enhance interior car audio; and the Ultimate Package (that requires the Limited Tech Package) which adds automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, smart cruise control, lane keep assist, and memory presets for mirrors/driver seat adjustments. For 2018 model year the SEL trim was replaced the SE with Popular Equipment Package, and now includes blind-spot monitoring with rear-cross traffic alert and lane change assist, four-wheel disc brakes (instead of front disc brakes and rear drum brakes), and rear-seat cupholders instead of center console-mounted ones. Limited models receive glossy black interior accents and a standard auto-dimming rearview mirror. All models also receive a new machine grey exterior colour option and three years of complimentary Blue Link/Homelink services.

====Elantra Sport====
Roughly halfway through the 2017 model year, Hyundai released a Sport model for the North American market. The Sport slots between the Eco and Limited models and was differentiated externally by different headlights and tail lights, ground effects, a more aggressive front and rear bumper as well as dual chrome-tipped exhaust outlets. Under the hood, the Sport featured a Turbocharged 1.6 L direct-injected I4 producing and of torque. Transmission options included a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic with manual shift mode or a traditional 6-speed manual. Additional modifications for the sport include a flat-bottomed steering wheel, red stitching on the seats, shift boot and steering wheel, larger front brakes, 18&quot; alloy wheels, an independent multi-link rear suspension, a thicker front stabilizer bar, and a lower ratio steering ratio for a quicker feel.

===Engines===
The 2019 Elantra 2.0 offered a six-speed automatic transmission. For the 2020 model year, the 2.0 engine will be paired with the continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) used in the 2019 Kia Forte. This will enable the 2020 Elantra SE to match the Forte FE&#x27;s 41 miles per U.S. gallon EPA fuel economy rating on the highway. Higher 2.0 trims, which have added weight and different tires, will be rated at 40 mpg on the EPA highway test. The U.S. fueleconomy.gov website shows a city rating of 31 mpg for the 2020 Elantra SE and 30 mpg for higher trims.

The 1.4 Turbo and 1.6 Turbo engines were offered on the 2019 Elantra sedan in the United States, but not in Canada.

===2018 facelift===
On 6 September 2018, the facelifted Avante was launched in South Korea. Despite widespread initial criticism for its design in Korea, the Avante became the fifth best-selling car in the South Korean market. It received a new exterior look, new wheel designs, new safety features and an updated center stack. The new redesign&#x27;s exterior changes include a new rear with redesigned tail lights, &quot;ELANTRA&quot; written across the back (on the USDM mode) and a hidden trunk release within the Hyundai emblem.

Interior design changes include revised HVAC controls for both manual and automatic systems and newly designed vents. The steering wheel has also been changed to the same design shared with the Kona, Veloster, and Elantra GT. The instrument cluster has an updated font, center display, and a checkerboard pattern. A new 5-inch touchscreen audio is now standard on the base SE trim and comes with a backup camera. The center storage in front of the shifter no longer has a door to conceal storage in order to accommodate the available Qi wireless charging dock for compatible smartphones. Rear heated seats are also no longer an option.

In the United States, the facelifted Elantra went on sale for the 2019 model year. New triangular headlights included LED headlights as an option, removing the previously available adaptive HID headlights.

Initially, it came in only one variant equipped with 2.0 L &quot;Nu MPi&quot; engine but later on, a second variant with 1.6 L &quot;Gamma II MPi&quot; engine was also introduced. Both variants come with 6-speed automatic transmission.

== Seventh generation (CN7; 2020) ==
The seventh generation Elantra, which was released for the 2021 model year, was unveiled on 17 March 2020 in West Hollywood, with model code name CN7. It teased a new &quot;parametric dynamics&quot; design language, and a return to a longer and wider fastback rear end sports sedan style. The interior features more rear legroom and a new instrument panel design with available twin digital display screens. The car went on sale in late 2020 in the U.S. and Canada.

The Elantra includes Hyundai’s Smart Sense safety technology which includes Forward Collision-Avoidance Assist (FCA), Blind-Spot Collision-Avoidance Assist (BCA), Rear Cross Traffic Collision-Avoidance Assist (RCCA), Lane Keeping Assist (LKA) and Smart Cruise Control with Stop &amp; Go (SCC).

It was selected as the 2021 North American Car of the Year.

In Australia, the seventh-generation Elantra is badged as the i30 Sedan, to allow Hyundai to integrate the Elantra with the popular i30 hatchback for much higher combined sales figures. It is available in the base level i30 sedan trim, i30 sedan hybrid, i30 N-Line sedan, and i30 N trims.

In China, the Elantra was introduced in October 2020 for the 2021 model year. The Elantra is available in two models known as 1.5 and N-Line. Standard engines consist of the 1.5 litre naturally aspirated unit paired to a CVT transmission for 1.5 models and the 1.4 litre turbo is paired to a 7-speed dual clutch automatic transmission for the N-Line. N-Line trims are known as Leading, Elite, Premium, and Flagship with actual trims known as GLS, GLX, LUX, and TOP. Pricing ranges from 99,800 yuan to 133,800 yuan.

This generation is also the first in China to not offer a manual transmission option since local assembling and production began in 2003.

In Vietnam, the seventh-generation Elantra was introduced on 14 October 2022 and is offered in three grade levels; Standard, Special and N-Line. Engine options include the 1.6-litre petrol engine paired with 6-speed automatic on Standard and Special grades, the 2.0-litre petrol engine paired with 6-speed automatic on Special grade, while the N-Line grade gets the &quot;Smartstream G&quot; 1.6-litre T-GDi engine paired with 7-speed DCT.

This engine consists of 1.6-litre, electric motor, and a 1.3-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery. The battery can store enough energy for gas free operation at a parking lot speed, and shuts off during coasting. The battery is located underneath the rear seats and the car has a steering ratio of 12.2:1.

=== Elantra N/Avante N/i30 Sedan N ===

In July 2021, the Elantra N, also known in some markets as the Avante N and the i30 Sedan N, was announced as the performance model of the Elantra under the Hyundai N sub-brand. The vehicle is powered by a 2.0-litre turbocharged I4 Theta II engine with a larger 52 mm turbine wheel rated at a maximum of 276 horsepower and 289 lb-ft of torque. However, the engine is reportedly significantly underrated. It has reinforced strut mounts, increased body rigidity, stiffer sway bars, and has independent multi-link rear suspension instead of the Elantra&#x27;s standard torsion beam rear suspension. The rear suspension has adjustable toe and camber. Brakes are swapped to higher performance versions, and tires are upgraded to wider and stickier 245/35/19 Michelin Pilot Sport 4S to offer increased performance compared to lower trims. The Elantra N has an electronic torque-vectoring limited-slip differential and a louder exhaust. Upgrades extend to the interior, with N Performance bucket seats as standard. In the United States and most markets the Elantra N is only offered as a fully-loaded model, e.g. with upgraded audio as standard. It is available with either a six-speed manual transmission or an 8-speed wet-type DCT. For DCT models, N Grin Shift (NGS), N Power Shift (NPS) and N Track Sense Shift (NTS) are provided as standard features along with a power moonroof and keyless remote start. N-grin shift, only available on the DCT, allows the engine to be overboosted to 290 ps for 20 seconds. The curb weight is 3186 pounds. In Car and Driver testing, the 8-speed Elantra N can do 0-60 in 4.8 secs and the quarter mile in 13.4s @ a 106 mph trap speed, although other magazines report slower speeds.

===Facelift===
The facelifted Avante was revealed in South Korea on 27 February 2023. On April 18, 2023, Hyundai unveiled the facelifted Elantra N, which features a similar redesigned front and rear end to the standard Elantra.

The North American-market Elantra was introduced on August 30, 2023, along with the refreshed 2024 Hyundai Sonata. In North America, there will be three models available: petrol-only, petrol/electric hybrid, and performance-oriented N. The petrol lineup will feature a new SEL Convenience trim, while the petrol/electric hybrid model is now available in a single trim. Four new exterior paint colour options are available: Ecotronic Gray, Ultimate Red, Exotic Green (available on the N model only), and Amazon Gray. Newly-standard safety features include rear side-impact airbags, a rear seatbelt reminder, and haptic feedback for the steering wheel that is integrated into the vehicle&#x27;s safety systems. A new curved display screen, which consists of two separate screens under a single pane of glass, also becomes available.

The Elantra N was also introduced to China at Auto Shanghai 2023 and was officially listed in November 2023. It is priced at 249,800 yuan and 263,800 yuan with trim levels: 2.0TN and 2.0T Sport Package Edition. Available exterior colour choices are Performance Blue, Cyber Gray, Lightning White, and Phantom Black. While the Elantra has been assembled in the country traditionally since 2003, the Hyundai Elantra N is available instead as an imported model.

The facelifted Elantra N was launched in the Philippines on April 4, 2024, alongside the Ioniq 5 N, as part of Hyundai N&#x27;s arrival in the country.

Hyundai Nishat commenced the production of the seventh-generation facelifted Elantra in Pakistan in October 2024. It comes in only one hybrid variant equipped with the 1.6 L &quot;Smartstream G1.6 Hybrid I4&quot; hybrid powertrain paired with 6-speed DCT.

The nameplate usage continues for the third-generation i30, which was released in 2017 for the 2018 model year. The Elantra GT was discontinued in these markets in 2020 due to the expansion of Hyundai&#x27;s SUV line-up.

== Naming disputes ==
Mitsubishi Motors Australia complained that the Hyundai Elantra was too close to the Elante trim level, which was last used on the 1991 Magna. British Lotus Cars and South Korean Kia Motors said that the Elantra name was too close to the Lotus Elan and its Kia counterpart. Germany&#x27;s Audi, meanwhile, complained that &quot;Avante&quot; was too close to Avant (used for Audi station wagons/estates). In 2001, both the Elan and the Elante had ceased production but the Avante&#x27;s renaming remained necessary as Audi owned the Avant name in Europe and continued to produce it. Because of these naming problems, the Elantra received &quot;Lantra&quot; badges in many markets while &quot;Avante&quot; was mainly used in the South Korean domestic market.

<doc id="1175363" wikidata="Q552966" url="?curid=1175363" title="Philip Yancey">
<text>Philip Yancey (born November 4, 1949) is an American author who writes primarily about spiritual issues. His books have sold more than 15 million copies in English and have been translated into 40 languages, making him one of the best-selling contemporary Christian authors. Two of his books have won the ECPA&#x27;s Christian Book of the Year Award: &quot;The Jesus I Never Knew&quot; in 1996, and &quot;What&#x27;s So Amazing About Grace?&quot; in 1998. He is published by Hachette, HarperCollins Christian Publishing, InterVarsity Press, Rabbit Room Press, and Penguin Random House.

==Life and career==
Yancey was born in Atlanta and grew up in nearby suburbs. When he was one year old, his father, stricken with polio, died after church members suggested he go off life support in faith that God would heal him. This and other negative experiences with a rigid, conservative, fundamentalist church background contributed to Yancey&#x27;s losing his faith at one point and deeply questioning the established church at other times. After high school he attended Columbia Bible College in South Carolina, where he met his wife, Janet. He went on to earn graduate degrees in communications and English from Wheaton College Graduate School and the University of Chicago.

While living in the Chicago, Illinois suburbs, in 1971 Yancey joined the staff of &quot;Campus Life&quot; magazine—a publication directed towards high school and college students—where he served as editor for eight years. For three decades Yancey contributed as an editor-at-large, for &quot;Christianity Today&quot;, and also wrote articles for publications including &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;, &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;,&quot;The Atlantic&quot;, &quot;Chicago Magazine&quot;, &quot;Christian Century&quot;, and &quot;National Wildlife&quot;.

As a journalist, he has interviewed two U. S. presidents and other notable people such as Bono, Billy Graham, and the authors Annie Dillard, John Updike, and Henri Nouwen. Former president Jimmy Carter has called Yancey &quot;my favorite modern author&quot;.

Yancey lives in Colorado, working as a freelance writer. Traveling widely for speaking engagements, he has visited over 85 countries.

Yancey suffered a broken neck in a motor vehicle accident in February 2007 but recovered. In August that year he completed his goal of climbing all 54 of Colorado&#x27;s -plus peaks, the final three after his accident. In the fall of 2022, he was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease. He later described Parkinson’s as &quot;the gift I didn’t want.&quot;

<doc id="1175370" wikidata="Q983160" url="?curid=1175370" title="Bak kut teh">
<text>Bak kut teh (also spelt bah kut teh and abbreviated BKT; , Teochew Pe̍h-uē-jī: &quot;nêg8-gug4-dê5&quot;) is a pork rib dish cooked in broth popularly served in Malaysia and Singapore where there is a predominant Hoklo and Teochew community.

The name literally translates from the Hokkien dialect as &quot;meat bone tea&quot;, and it usually consists of pork ribs simmered in a broth of herbs and spices (including star anise, cinnamon, cloves, &quot;dong quai&quot;, fennel seeds and garlic) for hours. However, it can also be made with seafood, chicken and other meat. Despite its name, there is in fact no tea in the dish itself; the name refers to a strong oolong Chinese tea which is usually served alongside the soup in the belief that it dilutes or dissolves the copious amount of fat consumed in this dish.

Additional ingredients may include offal, varieties of mushroom, choy sum, and pieces of dried tofu or fried tofu puffs. Additional Chinese herbs may include &quot;yu zhu&quot; (玉竹, rhizome of Solomon&#x27;s seal) and &quot;ju zhi&quot; (buckthorn fruit), which give the soup a sweeter, slightly stronger flavor. Light and dark soy sauce are also added to the soup during cooking, with varying amounts depending on the variant – the Teochew&#x27;s version is lighter than the Hokkiens&#x27;. The dish can be garnished with chopped coriander or green onions and a sprinkling of fried shallots.

In Malaysia, it is often served with strips of fried dough called &quot;you char kway&quot; (). Soy sauce (usually dark soy sauce, but light soy sauce is also offered sometimes) is preferred as a condiment, with which chopped chilli padi (Bird&#x27;s eyes chili) and minced garlic is taken together. Tea of various kinds, for example the Tieguanyin () variety which is popular in the Klang Valley area of Malaysia, is also usually served in the belief that it dilutes or dissolves the copious amount of fat consumed in this dish.

In Singapore, similarly the Teochew variant dish is served with a side of youtiao cut into small pieces, meant to be dipped into the soup of the dish before consumption. Braised pig trotters are also an option that can be ordered as a side together with the dish and dark soy sauce with chilli padi is preferred as a condiment. Tea, prepared in a kung fu tea ceremony is also served in restaurants specialising in the dish.

&quot;Bak kut teh&quot; is usually eaten for breakfast or lunch. The Hokkien and Teochew are traditionally tea-drinking cultures and this aspect runs deep in their cuisines.

==History==
&quot;Bak kut teh&quot; is commonly consumed in both Malaysia and Singapore. The origin of &quot;bak kut teh&quot; is unclear, but it is believed to have been brought over from Fujian, China said to be based on a Quanzhou dish of beef ribs stewed with herbs known as &quot;niu pai&quot; (&quot;beef steak&quot;). In Malaysia, the dish is popularly associated with Klang, where the locals believe it to be the place of origin of &quot;bak kut teh&quot;. There are a number of claims for the invention of the dish; one claimed that a local &quot;sinseh&quot; (a Chinese physician) invented the dish in the 1930s, while another claimed he brought the recipe from his hometown in Fujian, China, in the 1940s. The dish is also claimed to have been invented in Port Klang for coolies working at the port to supplement their meagre diet and as a tonic to boost their health in the early 20th century. The dish was popular among early Chinese immigrants, many of whom had also come from Fujian.

The Teochew variant was developed in Singapore and was sold along areas located beside the Singapore River, specifically in Clarke Quay and River Valley after the end of World War II. Established in 1925, owners of Pek Sin Choon claims that it had been supplying tea to bak kut teh stalls since its founding, but the business records were lost during World War II and the oldest preserved record by the business dates back to 1938. It is believed that the Singaporean version of the dish had at least been around since 1938, with evidence from Pek Sin Choon, which had been supplying tea to a bak kut teh stall, Nankin Street Bak Kut Teh, selling the Hokkien version of the dish in Maxwell Food Centre. The stall was founded by Teo Han Poh, the kitchen helper of Ong Say Bak Kut Teh (李旺世肉骨茶). Ong Say Bak Kut Teh was originally founded in the 1920s but was closed in 1989 due to redevelopment, leading to Teo starting her own bak kut teh business with the same recipe that was passed to her. By the 1960s, &quot;bak kut teh&quot; had become a popular street fare in Singapore. Certain business has been focused mainly on serving this dish, and developed their business from traditional humble pushcart into a restaurant chain, one such example would be Song Fa Bak Kut Teh, which was founded as a pushcart stall in 1969.

===Disputes over origin===
The question of its origin has been the subject of a dispute between Malaysia and Singapore; in 2009, the tourism minister of Malaysia, Ng Yen Yen, claimed that &quot;bak kut teh&quot; is a dish of Malaysian origin, and that neighbouring countries had &quot;hijacked&quot; many of Malaysia&#x27;s original dishes.

==Varieties==
There are numerous variants of &quot;bak kut teh&quot; with its cooking style closely influenced by the prevailing Chinese enclave of a certain geographical location.

There are three main types of &quot;bak kut teh&quot;.
* The Teochew style, which is light in colour but uses more pepper and garlic in the soup.
* The Hoklo (Hokkien), uses a variety of herbs and soy sauce creating a more fragrant, textured and darker soup. 
* The Cantonese, with a soup-drinking culture (Canton Cuisine), add medicinal herbs as well to create a stronger flavoured soup.

The main visual difference between the Hokkien and Teochew version of &quot;bak kut teh&quot; is that the Hokkiens use more dark soy sauce and thus the soup base is characteristically darker in colour.

In addition, a &quot;dry&quot; form of &quot;bak kut teh&quot; has also recently become increasingly popular within Malaysia, especially in Klang town. Although called &quot;dry&quot;, the broth is in fact reduced to a thicker gravy, to which other ingredients such as wolfberries, dried dates, dried chillies and dried squid are added. Unlike the original rib soup, the &quot;dry&quot; version has a tangier, sharper taste and is more akin to a herbal stew than the classical broth. It is often recommended locally in Malaysia as an excellent hangover cure.

In Malaysia, a less fatty variation of &quot;bak kut teh&quot; made with chicken is called &quot;chik kut teh&quot;. It also serves as a &quot;halal&quot; version of the dish catered to Muslims, whose religion forbids them to consume pork.

Bak kut is popular among the Chinese Indonesian community in the Riau Islands, Indonesia.

Vegetarian bak kut also can be found in Malaysia. Instead of using meat, oyster mushroom is used.

==Malaysian national record==
On 22 November 2008, the Malaysian Klang Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCCI) collaborated with five &quot;bak kut teh&quot; sellers in Klang to cook the world&#x27;s biggest bowl of the Hokkien variant of &quot;bak kut teh&quot;. The bowl was 182.88 cm in diameter and 91.44 cm in height, and contained 500 kg of meat, 450 kg of soup and 50 kg of herbal medicine, and has been listed in the Malaysian Book of Record.

== Recognition ==
&quot;Bak kut teh&quot; was recognised as an object of national heritage of Malaysia on 23 February 2024.

<text>The Richmond, Fredericksburg, and Potomac Railroad was a railroad connecting Richmond, Virginia, to Washington, D.C. The track is now the RF&amp;P Subdivision of the CSX Transportation system; the original corporation is no longer a railroad company.

The RF&amp;P was a bridge line, with a slogan of &quot;Linking North &amp; South,&quot; on a system that stretched about 113 miles. Until around 1965, RF&amp;P originated less than 5% of its freight tonnage, probably less than any other Class I railroad. For much of its existence, the RF&amp;P connected with the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway, the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad and Seaboard Air Line Railroad at Richmond. At Alexandria and through trackage rights to Washington Union Station in Washington, D.C., where connections were made with the Pennsylvania Railroad, Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and the Southern Railway. 

The railine connected to the Washington and Old Dominion Railroad at Potomac Yard and interchanged with the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway at Doswell. Until 2024, it (along with the former Conrail properties) was the only CSX line to have cab signal requirements on their entire system; the railroad ended this practice on the line in June of that year in favor of positive train control.

==History==

The Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad was chartered on February 25, 1834, to run from Richmond north via Fredericksburg to the Potomac River. It opened from Richmond to Hazel Run in 1836, to Fredericksburg on January 23, 1837, and the rest of the way to the Potomac River at Aquia Creek on September 30, 1842. Steamboat service to Washington, D.C., and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad was provided by the Washington and Fredericksburg Steamboat Company, later renamed the Potomac Steamboat Company, controlled by the railroad after 1845.

Badly damaged during the Civil War, on October 11, 1870, an extension to the north toward Quantico was authorized at a special meeting of the company&#x27;s stockholders. The company&#x27;s charter limited this branch to 10 miles, leaving it 1.7 miles short of the Alexandria and Fredericksburg Railroad. This split from the existing line at Brooke and ran north to Quantico, also on the Potomac. The old line to the Aquia Creek wharf was abandoned on the opening of the Quantico wharf on May 1, 1872.

On the other end of the line, the Alexandria and Washington Railroad was chartered on February 27, 1854, to build from the south end of the Long Bridge over the Potomac River south to Alexandria. That line opened in 1857. The railroad went bankrupt and was sold July 9, 1887, being reorganized November 23, 1887, as the Alexandria and Washington Railway. In 1873 the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad&#x27;s branch over the Long Bridge opened, giving a route into Washington, D.C., over which the A&amp;W obtained trackage rights.

The Alexandria and Fredericksburg Railway was chartered February 3, 1864, to continue the line from Alexandria to Fredericksburg. It opened on July 2, 1872, only reaching Quantico, the north end of the RF&amp;P. At Quantico the 1.7-mile (2.7 km) Potomac Railroad, chartered April 21, 1867, and opened May 1, 1872, connected the two lines. It was leased to the RF&amp;P for 28 years from May 17, 1877. On March 31, 1890, the two companies terminating in Alexandria merged to form the Washington Southern Railway. Until November 1, 1901, it was operated by the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad and its successor the Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington Railroad (part of the Pennsylvania Railroad system). The Potomac Railroad lease was transferred to the Washington Southern on June 30, 1904. On February 24, 1920, the Washington Southern was formally merged into the RF&amp;P.

The Richmond-Washington Company was incorporated September 5, 1901, as a holding company, owning the entire capital stock of the two railroads. The stock of the company was owned equally by the Pennsylvania Railroad, Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, Southern Railway, Seaboard Air Line Railway and Chesapeake and Ohio Railway. Four of these companies (B&amp;O, ACL, SAL, C&amp;O) have since become part of CSX. The Southern Railway is now part of Norfolk Southern and does not use the former RF&amp;P; the former Pennsylvania Railroad, in its later incarnation as Conrail, has been split between CSX and Norfolk Southern with most of PRR&#x27;s routes becoming part of Norfolk Southern. However, the portion of the former PRR that connected to the very north of the RF&amp;P&#x27;s former Potomac Yard, across the Long Bridge and into Washington DC, became part of CSX following the takeover of Conrail by NS and CSX. The RF&amp;P company became Commonwealth Atlantic Land V Inc., and a new corporation, named the Richmond, Fredericksburg &amp; Potomac Railway Company, was formed on October 9, 1991.

On December 31, 1925, RF&amp;P operated 118 miles of road and 432 miles of track; on December 31, 1970, mileages were 118 and 518.

== Passenger service ==

As the link between &quot;North and South&quot; the RF&amp;P primarily hosted the trains of other railroads, particularly those on the lucrative New York–Florida run. In March 1950 this included the &quot;East Coast Champion&quot;, &quot;West Coast Champion&quot;, &quot;Miamian&quot;, &quot;Palmland&quot;, &quot;Silver Star&quot;, &quot;Silver Comet&quot;, &quot;Orange Blossom Special&quot;, &quot;Silver Meteor&quot;, &quot;Vacationer&quot;, &quot;Havana Special&quot;, &quot;Palmetto&quot;, &quot;Florida Special&quot;, &quot;Cotton Blossom&quot;, &quot;Sunland&quot;, and &quot;Everglades&quot;.

The RF&amp;P operated comparatively few trains of its own. One was the &quot;Old Dominion&quot;, a streamliner inaugurated in 1947 between Washington and Richmond. This train used four 70-seat coaches and a cafe-parlor car, all built by American Car and Foundry. In 1956, the RF&amp;P operated two daily passenger trains, one of which was a local and the other an express in addition to operating numerous through trains from other railroads.

==Branches==

;Richmond Connection
The Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac and Richmond and Petersburg Railroad Connection was chartered March 3, 1866, and opened May 1, 1867, as a connection between the RF&amp;P and the Richmond and Petersburg Railroad (later part of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad) west of downtown Richmond. It was operated jointly by those two companies. In addition, a downtown connection was owned by the R&amp;P past Broad Street Station.

;Louisa
The Louisa Railroad was chartered in 1836, running from the RF&amp;P at Doswell west to Louisa. At first it was operated as a branch of the RF&amp;P, but it was reorganized as the Virginia Central Railroad in 1850 and merged into the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad in 1868 as its oldest predecessor.

;Rosslyn
In 1896, the Washington Southern Railway opened a branch that connected the south end of the Long Bridge in Jackson City to the south end of the Aqueduct Bridge in Rosslyn. The Railway built much of the branch within the grade of the old disused Alexandria Canal.

In 1904, the Rosslyn Connecting Railroad, which the Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington Railroad controlled, acquired the branch on the same day (February 29) that the railroad was incorporated in accordance with Virginia law. The Rosslyn Connecting Railroad abandoned nearly all of its line in 1962 and closed in 1969 after operating for 65 years.

In 1977, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority opened a surface-level section of Metrorail&#x27;s Blue Line that replaced most of the section of the Rosslyn Connecting Railroad&#x27;s line that had traveled within the Alexandria Canal&#x27;s grade. The section of the Blue Line parallels Virginia State Route 110 where passing Arlington National Cemetery.

==Heritage units==
On February 12, 2024 CSX unveiled ES44AH No. 1836 as the 10th unit in their fleet. The unit is designed with the cab staying in YN3C and the long hood being painted in the RF&amp;P blue and grey. Another unit, GP40-2 No. 6394 (former RF&amp;P 142) had its nose vandalized into its original RF&amp;P look.

<text>George Barna (born 1954) is the founder of The Barna Group, a market research firm specializing in studying the religious beliefs and behavior of Americans, and the intersection of faith and culture. From 2013–2018 he served as the executive director of the American Culture &amp; Faith Institute, the research division of United in Purpose. In 2019 he became a professor at Arizona Christian University in Phoenix, Arizona, where he also started the Cultural Research Center at Arizona Christian University. He is also the senior research fellow for Christian ethics and Biblical worldview at Family Research Council.

==Background==

George Barna grew up a Catholic in New York City and Princeton, New Jersey but he has since engaged with evangelical Christianity.

Barna has filled executive roles in politics, marketing, advertising, media development, research and ministry. He founded the Barna Research Group in 1984 (now The Barna Group), a marketing research firm focused on the intersection of faith and culture. Through the Barna Group, George served several hundred parachurch ministries, thousands of Christian churches, and many other non-profit and for-profit organizations as well as the U.S. military. He sold it in 2009.

He currently serves as the president of Metaformation, a faith development organization.

Barna has written more than 50 books, mostly addressing cultural trends, leadership, spiritual development, and church dynamics. They include &quot;New York Times bestsellers&quot; and several award-winning books. His works have been translated into more than a dozen foreign languages. He has sold more books based on survey research related to matters of faith than any author in American history.

His work is frequently cited as an authoritative source by the media. Barna has been hailed as “the most quoted person in the Christian Church today” and has been named by various media as one of the nation&#x27;s most influential Christian leaders.

A frequent speaker at ministry conferences around the world, he has been on the faculty at several universities and seminaries, and has served as a pastor of a large, multi-ethnic church as well as a house church, and has helped to start several churches.

After graduating summa cum laude from Boston College, Barna earned two master&#x27;s degrees from Rutgers University and received an honorary doctorate from Dallas Baptist University.

After attending high school and college together, George and his wife Nancy married in 1978. They have three adopted daughters — two from Guatemala, one from Russia and three grandchildren. They live on the central California coast and attend Mission Church in Ventura. He enjoys reading, music, rooting for the Yankees and Lakers, and relaxing on the beach.

Barna leads seminars for church leaders, speaks at ministry conferences, has taught at seminaries, and has been a pastor. As an author, he has written more than 50 books on contemporary Christian issues, with topics ranging from worldviews, trends and children to church life, spiritual growth and leadership. He also written more than 200 articles that have been published in professional journals, mass market publications, and online.

As a result of his work, Barna has coined several terms, including:
* &quot;Mosaic Generation&quot; – the demographic profile of those born between 1984 and 2002. According to Barna, this generation is &quot;very mosaic in every aspect of their life.&quot; He continues, &quot;There&#x27;s no attribute that really dominates like you might have seen with prior generations.&quot; Barna also describes this group as &quot;comfortable with contradiction&quot;, &quot;post-modern&quot; and exhibiting &quot;non-linear&quot; thinking.
* &quot;Theolographics&quot; – the theological perspectives and applications of people;
* &quot;Spiritainment&quot; – a portmanteau which refers to the blending of spirituality and entertainment, toward influencing people&#x27;s spiritual perspectives.
* &quot;SAGE Cons&quot; – an acronym that stands for Spiritually Active Governance Engaged Conservative Christians - the roughly 10% of the US adult population who are compelled by their commitment to Christianity and biblical obedience to be informed and involved in governance and political issues

==Findings==
Barna is known for providing extensive surveys regarding Christianity and the state of the church. Among his findings that have generated substantial interest or controversy in recent years include:
* Children are the most important population segment to minister to because of their spiritual teachability and developmental vulnerability;
* God transforms people&#x27;s lives in connection with a 10-stop journey that is surprisingly consistent across people groups
* Conservative Christians are eager to have their pastors teach them how to think biblically about current cultural issues, but pastors are reluctant to get involved in matters that are political and controversial;
* Christian churches in the United States have been generally ineffective vessels for evangelism and discipleship;
* Most Protestant pastors are neither called to nor competent in leadership;
* Only one out of every ten American adults has a biblical worldview, including less than one out of every three born again adults;
* Every church engages in marketing, but few do it well;
* Mass media has the most dramatic effect on people&#x27;s behavior and beliefs;
* A growing group of spiritually devout Christians, known as &quot;Revolutionaries&quot;, are embracing a post-congregational narrative that is reshaping spiritual life in the U.S.;
* Most &quot;church growth&quot; is simply the recycling of church-goers from one congregation to another.
* Divorce rate amongst born-again Christians is significantly higher than that for atheist/agnostics. A more recent 2008 Barna report shows a closer divorce rate gap between born-again Christians (32% had been divorced) and atheist/agnostics (30% had been divorced).
* Donald Trump won the presidency in 2016 because of the Christian vote. Among Christians, Trump received 57% of their votes, compared to 37% for Clinton. Among non-Christian voters, Clinton was preferred by a 62% to 26% margin. SAGE Cons were the most prolific voter segment for Trump: 91% voted, and 93% of them voted for Trump.
Barna considers Maximum Faith to be his most significant book. Others that he cites as being especially valuable include Transforming Children into Spiritual Champions, Think Like Jesus, The Power of Vision, and Revolution. Since 2009 in addition to writing his own books he has also been a writer for hire, penning books such as The Cause Within You, for Matthew Barnett, which became a New York Times bestseller in 2011.

<doc id="1175373" wikidata="Q948742" url="?curid=1175373" title="Kubaba">
<text>Kubaba (, ) was a legendary Mesopotamian queen who according to the &quot;Sumerian King List&quot; ruled over Kish for a hundred years before the rise of the dynasty of Akshak. It is typically assumed that she was not a historical figure.

==Name==
Kubaba&#x27;s name was written in cuneiform as &quot;kù-dba-ú&quot;, &quot;kù-dbu-ú,&quot; &quot;ku-ub-ba-bu-ú&quot; or &quot;ku-ub-ba-bu-ú&quot;. It is also romanized as Ku-Baba, with a hyphen separating the elements and the first letter of the theonym capitalized. The first sign can be transcribed as &quot;kug&quot; rather than &quot;ku&quot;, which is reflected by the title of the corresponding entry in the Reallexikon der Assyriologie, Ku(g)-Baba. This name can be translated from Sumerian as &quot;radiant Baba&quot; or &quot;silver of Baba&quot;. The correct reading of the last sign in the theonym used as the second element of this theophoric name remains a matter of debate, with /u/ and /wu/ proposed in addition to /ba/. The name of the queen can accordingly be alternatively romanized as Kug-Bau or Kug-Bawu.

===Queen Kubaba and goddess Kubaba===
Due to spatial and temporal differences, a connection between the names of Kubaba and the similarly named goddess Kubaba cannot be established. Gonzalo Rubio stresses that the name of the latter has no clear etymology and cannot be interpreted as originating in either Sumerian or any of the Semitic languages. It was written in cuneiform as &quot;dku-ba-ba&quot; or &quot;dku-pa-pa&quot;.

==Historicity==
Arguments have been made that Kubaba might have been a historical ruler, though this view is not regarded as plausible today. Earliest sources mentioning her were only composed centuries after she supposedly lived. Assyriologists consider her a &quot;legendary&quot; or &quot;mythical&quot; ruler. As noted by Gianni Marchesi, names starting with the element &quot;ku-&quot; are not attested before the Ur III period, and placing a ruler bearing one of them in the Early Dynastic period constitutes an anachronism. Claus Wilcke points out that in the &quot;Sumerian King List&quot; Kubaba&#x27;s reign is supernaturally long, lasting 100 years. It has been pointed out that the SKL does not accurately reflect Early Dynastic history, as indicated by the complete omission of Lagash, which was a major political power, especially during the reign of Eannatum. Kubaba is also not mentioned in any of the discovered inscriptions of historical Early Dynastic rulers. Martel Stol concludes that texts mentioning Kubaba should only be interpreted as speculation about traditional folk stories.

==Attestations in literary texts==
===&quot;Sumerian King List&quot;===
Kubaba is mentioned in the &quot;Sumerian King List&quot;, though due to her gender her inclusion is considered unusual. While some modern authors refer to her as a queen, the Sumerian title applied to her is &quot;lugal&quot; (&quot;king&quot;), which had no feminine counterpart. A recension from Ur instead states that there was no king while Kubaba reigned. She is the only ruler from the third dynasty of Kish listed. The list describes her as an innkeeper (míLÚ.KAŠ.TIN-&quot;na&quot;), credits her with &quot;strengthening the foundation of Kish&quot; and attributes a 100 years long reign culminating in a temporary transfer of power from Kish to Akshak before it was regained by Puzur-Suen. The latter ruler is said to be Kubaba&#x27;s son, which makes her the grandmother of Ur-Zababa, a legendary opponent of historical Sargon of Akkad; Piotr Steinkeller points out that the historicity of these rulers of Kish and the related Sargon tradition is contradicted by an inscription which mentions the city was sacked by Enshakushanna of Uruk, who might have been a contemporary of Sargon, and its king at the time, who was taken as a captive, was named Enbi-Eštar. The oldest known copies of the SKL date back to the Ur III period. While names of some rulers, for example Mesannepada, were likely sourced from votive inscriptions, others, like Bazi and Zizi, might have been ordinary given names copied from lexical lists, such as the Early Dynastic so-called &quot;Names and Professions List&quot;, or outright inventions. Early versions of the SKL do not contain anecdotes about individual rulers, including Kubaba, which indicates they most likely were a later invention. The compilers used few, if any, historical accounts. Accordingly, Kubaba&#x27;s background is treated as fantastical, and has been compared to other unusual stories or members of various professions becoming kings in the same composition, including the fuller Susuda, the sailor Mamagal, and the stone worker Nanniya.

===Other texts===
In the so-called &quot;Weidner Chronicle&quot;, which is considered a derivative of the &quot;Sumerian King List&quot;, the order of Kubaba&#x27;s dynasty and the dynasty of Akshak is switched around, with reigning before her rather than later on. The section dedicated to her is poorly preserved. It relays how Kubaba was granted kingship by Marduk after he delivered an offering of fish to his temple Esagil. The composition is focused on conveying the message that kings who neglected to worship Marduk were rendered powerless, and to that end employs a number of anachronisms, this account being one of them. It is known from Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian copies, and was originally composed no earlier than around 1100 BCE.

References to Kubaba are also known from texts focused on omens linked to liver divination. As noted by Beate Pongratz-Leisten, references to legendary rulers such as her, Gušur, Etana or Gilgamesh in works belonging to this category were meant to establish them as paradigmatic models of kingship. In one of the omen compendiums, the &quot;omen of Kubaba&quot; is the birth of an androgynous being with both a penis and a vagina. It is possible the birth of a sheep rather than a human is meant. Such an event is said to foretell that &quot;the country of the king shall be ruined&quot;. Marten Stol argues that its negative character reflected a negative perception of a woman fulfilling a typically masculine role, that of a ruler. Other omens preserve a tradition according to which Kubaba was a warrior.

<text>Norton Winfred Simon (February 5, 1907 – June 2, 1993) was an American industrialist and philanthropist. He was at one time one of the wealthiest men in America. At the time of his death, he had amassed a net worth of nearly US$10 billion.

Simon was born to a Jewish family in Portland, Oregon. His father operated a wholesale goods store there. When Simon was sixteen years old, he relocated with his family from Portland to San Francisco following his mother&#x27;s death. After dropping out of the University of California, Berkeley, Simon founded a sheet metal company before investing in an insolvent orange juice bottling plant in Fullerton, California. The company was renamed Val Vita Food Products Company, and, under Simon&#x27;s supervision, expanded its product line to include numerous other fruit and vegetable products. The company was eventually sold by Simon to Hunt&#x27;s Foods, after which Simon retired in 1969.

He spent his later years serving in philanthropic and non-profit roles, acting as a regent on the boards of the University of California and Reed College, as well as the Los Angeles Music Center, the California School of Professional Psychology, and the Institute for Advanced Study. Simon amassed a significant art collection that is housed in the Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena, California. After his death in 1993 Simon&#x27;s second wife, actress Jennifer Jones, remained an emeritus director of the Museum until her death in 2009.

==Early life==
Simon was born in Portland, Oregon to a Jewish family, the eldest child of Myer and Lillian Simon (née Gluckman). He had two younger sisters, Evelyn and Marcia. Simon&#x27;s San Francisco-born father was raised in Portland, where he eventually worked as a businessman operating his own wholesale goods store, Simon Sells For Less; Simon&#x27;s mother, a native of Chicago, was raised primarily in Sacramento, California.

In his youth, Simon&#x27;s parents purchased a cottage in Seaside, Oregon, where he spent a significant amount of his childhood. His mother died in Seaside when Simon was fourteen of an acute digestive disorder related to type 1 diabetes. Following his mother&#x27;s death, Simon&#x27;s father lost the majority of his money during the Great Depression, which harshly impacted his goods store.

When he was sixteen, Simon relocated with his father and siblings to San Francisco, where they moved into his aunt and uncle&#x27;s home. There, Simon attended Lowell High School, graduating in 1923. In 1925, at his father&#x27;s insistence, he enrolled in the University of California, Berkeley.

==Business career==

Simon left Berkeley after just six weeks to start a sheet metal distribution company. He enjoyed early success and invested $7,000 in 1927 in an orange juice bottling plant in Fullerton, California, which was insolvent, and renamed it Val Vita Food Products Company. He soon added other fruit and vegetables to the product lines and purchased canning equipment.

As one of the first of his significant corporate moves, Simon sold Val Vita to Hunt&#x27;s Foods in return for a controlling interest in the combined business. By 1943 he changed the company&#x27;s name to Hunt Food and Industries and ran it with strict cost-controls and an unorthodox approach to marketing. During and after World War II, Simon focused on product visibility. Uncharacteristically for a food company at the time, he acquired full-page advertisements in &quot;Vogue&quot; and &quot;Life&quot; magazines with full-color photos of Hunt&#x27;s ketchup bottles and tomato sauce cans. His aggressive advertising ensured the company&#x27;s slogan &quot;Hunt for the best&quot; was prominent. His marketing strategy worked, and by 1945 Hunt Foods became a household name and one of the largest food processing businesses on the West Coast.

With the growing profits from Hunt Foods, he began buying stock in other undervalued companies with growth potential, many of which were still undervalued following the loss of confidence in equities after the Great Depression. He diversified through acquisition into well known businesses such as McCall&#x27;s Publishing, the &quot;Saturday Review of Literature&quot;, Canada Dry Corporation, Max Factor cosmetics, the television production company Talent Associates, and Avis Car Rental, through his holding company Norton Simon Inc. Norton Simon Inc. was formed in 1968 through the merger of Hunt, McCalls, and Canada Dry. Many of these businesses had extensive interests outside the United States. Norton Simon Inc. was later acquired by Esmark in 1983, which merged with Beatrice Foods the next year. Beatrice was sold to ConAgra Foods, Inc. in 1990.

==Art collection==

Simon accumulated a significant private art collection which included works of the Impressionists, Old Masters, modern and native art. In the 1960s, he spent $6 million on artworks – an inventory of slightly less than 800 objects – and real estate – a building at 18 East 79th Street – from the Duveen Gallery in Manhattan, which specialized in old masters. Scholars including the critic Clement Greenberg and the Metropolitan Museum of Art curator Theodore Rousseau studied the Duveen purchases for Simon and were able to identify numerous misattributions. Simon ended up selling much of the collection and only kept around 130 objects, primarily paintings, a handful of sculptures, a few porcelains, and a cape purportedly worn by Charles IV of Spain. However, his collection holds three autographed Rembrandt paintings, considered highly important works of Rembrandt in Southern California.

Simon served as a trustee of the Los Angeles County Museum of History, Science and Art and supported the development of the LA County Museum of Art. Simon initially lent most of his art collection to that Museum although as it expanded he pioneered the &quot;museum without walls&quot; concept by actively lending his collection to different museums around the world.

In 1972, Simon bought a tenth-century South Indian bronze Nataraja, or dancing Shiva, from New York dealer Ben Heller for $900,000. The Indian government declared that the statue had been stolen from a temple in Tamil Nadu and smuggled abroad. Although Simon was quoted in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on May 12, 1973, as saying, &quot;Hell yes, it was smuggled. I spent between $15 and $16 million in the last two years on Asian art, and most of it was smuggled.&quot; He later vehemently denied the quote in the May 13, 1973, edition of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, declaring that the work had been legally imported into the United States. In the same &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article, he stated, &quot;As a collector deeply and emotionally involved in art, I deplore the rape of art treasures of any country.&quot; In 1976, Simon reached an amicable agreement with the Union of India whereby he agreed to return the Nataraja. In exchange, the Indian government agreed that Simon could keep and display the bronze in his museum for nine years first.

Seeking a permanent home for his collection of over 4,000 objects, in 1972 he welcomed an overture from the financially troubled Pasadena Museum of Modern Art. He ultimately assumed control and naming rights, and in 1974 it was renamed the Norton Simon Museum. In 1987, the University of California, Los Angeles, announced an &quot;agreement in principle&quot; with Simon for the transfer to the university of the art collection owned by two Simon foundations – the Norton Simon Foundation and the Norton Simon Art Foundation. The plan was to keep most of collection in Pasadena, administered by UCLA, the Simon board and the Norton Simon Foundation. The university was to build a separate museum facility on campus for part of the collection. However, Simon withdrew his offer three months after the announcement was made.

==Later years==
In 1969, his son Robert Simon died by suicide, leaving Donald (Norton&#x27;s other son), Lucille, and Norton shocked. In 1970, he and wife Lucille Ellis divorced. In 1971, he married actress Jennifer Jones, the widow of David O. Selznick. He retired from active involvement in his business in 1969. He accepted appointments to the University of California Board of Regents, the Carnegie Commission on the Future of Higher Education, the boards of Reed College (in his hometown of Portland), the Los Angeles Music Center, the California School of Professional Psychology at Alliant International University, and the Institute for Advanced Study.

In 1970, Simon opposed U.S. Senator George Murphy&#x27;s bid for a second term in the Republican primary. Murphy won renomination, but lost the seat in the general election to the Democrat John V. Tunney, as Republican Ronald Reagan was winning a second term as governor.

==Death==
Simon was diagnosed in 1984 with the neurological disorder Guillain–Barré syndrome, although he remained active in the Norton Simon Museum. He died of pneumonia at his home in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles on June 2, 1993.

<doc id="1175381" wikidata="Q539042" url="?curid=1175381" title="SCons">
<text>SCons is a software development tool that analyzes source code dependencies and operating system adaptation requirements from a software project description and generates final binary executables for installation on the target operating system platform. Its function is similar to the more popular GNU build system.

The tool generates Python scripts for project configuration and build logic.

== History ==
The &quot;Cons&quot; software construction utility, written in the Perl, was created by Bob Sidebotham in 1999. It served as a base for the &quot;ScCons&quot; build tool, a design which won the Software Carpentry project SC Build competition in August 2000. ScCons was the foundation for SCons.

SCons inspired the creation of Waf, formerly known as &quot;SCons/BKsys&quot;, which emerged in the KDE community. For some time, there were plans to use it as the build tool for KDE 4 and beyond, but that effort was abandoned in favor of CMake.

Notable projects that use SCons (or used it at one time) include: The Battle for Wesnoth, Battlefield 1942, Doom 3, FCEUX, gem5, gpsd, GtkRadiant, Madagascar, Mixxx, MongoDB, Nullsoft Scriptable Install System, OpenNebula, VMware, , XORP and MCA2, openpilot and Godot.

.csig is the SCons Content Signature file format.

== Features ==
Major features include:
* Configuration files are Python; user-written builds can leverage a general-purpose, cross-platform programming language
* Dependency analysis for C, C++ and Fortran
* Dependency analysis is extensible through user-defined scanners for other languages or file types; unlike GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) dependency analysis, SCons uses a regular expression scan for included source files
* Built-in support for C, C++, D, Java, Fortran, Objective-C, Yacc, Lex, Qt and SWIG, as well as TeX and LaTeX documents
* Support for other languages via custom builders
* Building from central repositories of source code and pre-built targets
* Ability to use Visual Studio, including the generation of , , and files
* Detection of file content changes using MD5 signatures; optional, configurable ability to use traditional timestamps
* Ability to do parallel builds, maintaining a specified number of jobs running simultaneously regardless of directory hierarchy
* Autoconf-like support for finding #include files, libraries, functions and typedefs
* Global view of dependencies, so multiple build passes or reordering targets is not required.
* Ability to share built files in a cache to speed up multiple builds - like ccache but for any type of target file, not just C/C++ compilation
* Designed from the ground up for cross-platform builds; known to work on POSIX systems (including Linux, AIX and OS/2, *BSD Unices, HP-UX, SGI IRIX, Solaris, illumos), Windows NT, OS X

== Examples ==

The following is an SConstruct file that builds a hello world C program using the default platform compiler:
Program(&quot;hello-world.c&quot;)
The following is a SConstruct file for a project that includes two source files and specifies build tool options:
env = Environment()
env.Append(CPPFLAGS=[&quot;-Wall&quot;, &quot;-g&quot;])
env.Program(&quot;hello&quot;, [&quot;hello.c&quot;, &quot;main.c&quot;])

<text>A cabbage roll is a dish consisting of cooked cabbage leaves wrapped around a variety of fillings. It is common to the cuisines of Central, Northern, Eastern and Southeastern Europe and much of Western Asia, Northern China, as well as parts of North Africa.
Meat fillings are traditional in Europe, and include beef, lamb, or pork seasoned with garlic, onion, and spices. Grains such as rice and barley, mushrooms, and vegetables are often included as well. Fermented cabbage leaves are used for wrapping, particularly in southeastern Europe. In Asia, seafoods, tofu, and shiitake mushrooms may also be used. Chinese cabbage is often used as a wrapping.

Cabbage leaves are stuffed with the filling which are then baked, simmered, or steamed in a covered pot and generally eaten warm, often accompanied with a sauce. The sauce varies widely by cuisine. In Sweden and Finland, stuffed cabbage is served with lingonberry jam, which is both sweet and tart. In Central and Eastern Europe, tomato-based sauces and sour cream are typical. In Lebanon, the cabbage is stuffed with rice and minced meat and only rolled to the size of a cigar. It is usually served with a side dish of yogurt and a type of lemon and olive oil vinaigrette seasoned with garlic and dried mint.

The cabbage roll is a staple in the Romanian cuisine with variations of the recipe and sizing depending on the region, typically taking up to 6 hours to cook. Traditionally made with pork, beef, bacon, rice, spices and aromatics, the cabbage rolls are broiled in a tomato sauce and served with polenta, sour cream and spicy pickled peppers.

Cooking textbook author Nancy Krcek stated that the origins are unclear and that it is possible multiple groups of people invented it at the same time. Another cooking book author Malgorzata Caprari stated it is believed that credit is owed to the poorer inhabitants of Central and Eastern European countries. Due to the widespread cultivation of cabbage in these regions, it is likely that the cultures who inhabited them were the original inventors of this dish. 

Cabbage rolls have found their way into popular culture, becoming one of the most recognizable dishes in Central and Eastern European cuisine. They often appear in literature and films as a symbol of homey comfort and tradition.

A version called holishkes is traditionally eaten by Jews on Simchat Torah. Recipes vary depending on region; northern Poles prefer a savory sauce, while Galicia, Hungary and Ukraine favor sweet-and-sour, for example.

===Europe===

====Armenia====

In Armenia, cabbage rolls are stuffed with beans and tart fruits. It is wrapped with cabbage leaves, and stuffed with red beans, garbanzo beans, lentils, cracked wheat, tomato paste, onion and many spices and flavorings. Cabbage rolls are called Pasuts tolma (պասուց տոլմա) (Lenten dolma) in Armenian where they are of seven different grains – chickpea, bean, lentil, cracked wheat, pea, rice and maize. Armenian cooks sometimes use rose hip syrup to flavor stuffed cabbage rolls.

====Azerbaijan and Turkey====
Stuffed cabbage leaves ( ) are popular all year in Azerbaijan and Turkey, but especially in winter when other vegetables are less plentiful. The stuffing usually consists of rice and herbs such as coriander, mint and dill, onions and meat, although there is a variation— &quot;yalancı dolma&quot; (&quot;fake&quot; dolma) — which is meat-free.

==== Balkans ====

Cabbage rolls are a culinary standard in Turkey, Bulgaria, Greece, North Macedonia, Albania, Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Slovenia and Romania. They are traditionally made with leaves of brined cabbage stuffed with ground beef, pork and rice, while meat can also be omitted or substituted with crushed walnuts, pine nuts and raisins. In Romania and parts of Greece, cabbage rolls are a favorite dish during Christmas time and other non-fasting holidays. In some countries, such as Serbia, cabbage rolls are traditionally simmered at length in a paprika-based sauce with chunks of smoked bacon.

==== Romania and Moldova ====

With &quot;sarmale&quot; being the national dish of Romania, there are different variations and sizing depending on the region.
Sarmale are Romanian stuffed cabbage rolls traditionally served on Christmas and New Year&#x27;s Eve but also served throughout the year at weddings, baptism parties, and other large celebrations. It is considered a winter dish and starts with the orthodox celebration of St. Ignatie day – Preparing the Pig, when Romanians traditionally slaughter the pigs for Christmas. 
Ground pork or beef is mixed with sauteed caramelized onions and rice, stuffed in a cabbage leaf, pickled sauerkraut leaf or grape leaf. For flavor, they usually consist of layers with bacon, smoked ribs, or smoked sausage. 
Seasoned with spices and aromatics, it is traditionally served with polenta, sour cream and pickled spicy peppers.

==== Hungary ====

Töltött Káposzta, the traditional Hungarian cabbage roll, can be made from sweet or sauerkraut cabbage leaves filled with a mixture of minced pork meat (or sometimes turkey), eggs, onions, and rice seasoned with caraway, salt, and pepper. In Transylvania and Alföld regions it is called &quot;takart&quot;. The Hungarian version often contains minced paprika and is served with sour cream on top. It used to be seasoned with saffron. Many Hungarians serve this food during Christmas and New Year&#x27;s Eve, although it is a common dish throughout the year (sweet version during summer/fall and the sour during winter/spring time). The sour stuffed cabbage is part of the traditional Hungarian pig slaughter menu and it is said that eating this during the holiday season will bring you wealth and health for the new year.

There are lots of regional variations: in Kárpátalja and Nyírség, for example, they make pinky-sized töltött káposzta for weddings.

Although the rolling up of cabbages was first mentioned in the book of Miklós Tótfalusi Kis (in 1695), a similar dish, the &quot;káposztás hús&quot;, was known long before it. (not to be confused with Székelykáposzta)

The Káposztás hús was hugely popular. This traditional cabbage stew had a special significance to Hungarian people. The 17th-century manuscript cookbook of the Csáktornya court, written sometime before 1662, begins its list of dishes with the phrase &quot;The cabbage meat is the coat of arms of Hungary&quot;. &quot;In the old days, there was no dish more suitable for Hungarians than cabbage&quot;, said Péter Apor, praising it as the meal of the lords. Mátyás Bél around 1730 also calls &quot;Cabbage with bacon, the coat of arms of Hungary&quot;. Lippay also calls it the &quot;coat of arms of Hungary&quot; and states that Hungarian people can&#x27;t live without it. Kelemen Mikes when traveling to Turkey also writes back, &quot;The beautifully written letter pleases the mind, as does these cabbages with dill and sour cream&quot;. Mikes also finds it fitting for a coat of arms: &quot;Even if I had no other praise to say about it, is it not enough to say that it is the Transylvanian coat of arms?&quot;

But the cabbage roll itself also appears as a motif in the culture. In the renowned writer Zsigmond Móricz&#x27;s short story &quot;Tragedy&quot;, the protagonist János Kis dies while eating stuffed cabbage (of which he had vowed to eat fifty).

==== Poland ====

Stuffed cabbage rolls are a popular Polish dish. Pork and beef mixed with rice or barley are nestled in a cabbage leaf and cooked in the oven or on the stove until tender.

The cabbage rolls are called &quot;gołąbki&quot; in Polish, &quot;holubky&quot; by Czechs and Slovaks, or &quot;sarma&quot; / &quot;сарма&quot; by Serbs, Croatians and Bulgarians. The sauce is often the main difference in regional variations.
In a less popular version called &quot;leniwe gołąbki&quot; (lazy cabbage rolls) the ingredients are chopped, combined and baked or fried.

====Ukraine====
In Ukraine, the filling of &quot;holubtsi&quot; varies throughout the country. In the Carpathian region corn grits are used, whereas in the Poltava area buckwheat groats are preferred. The cereal is lightly cooked, mixed with fried onions, shkvarky (pork cracklings) or raw minced meat. The mixture is combined with spices and seasonings, and is then used as the filling for steamed fresh or pickled cabbage leaves. In spring cabbage leaves are often replaced with fresh beetroot leaves, and in the southwest – with fresh young grape leaves. The &quot;holubtsi&quot; are lightly fried and then stewed with sour cream, or tomato, mushroom or some other sauce. During Lenten periods this might be water mixed with kvas, while at other times it might be a meat broth.

In Left Bank Ukraine and in the south, &quot;holubtsi&quot; are usually big, made from the entire cabbage leaf, while in the Dniester region and the Carpathians the cabbage leaf is divided into several pieces. In the latter regions, cooks who made large holubtsi were considered lazy. In Poltava cooks preferred the large holubtsi because they were juicier. In most of Ukraine holubtsi were an everyday dish, but in most of Right Bank Ukraine, with the exception of Polissia, they were also included in holiday meals. Beginning in the 1920s, holubtsi began to be stuffed with a rice-meat mixture, and, instead of kvas, they began to be cooked in tomato juice, sauce or paste. This is the most common way they are prepared nowadays.

Holubtsi are a popular dish for both everyday meal and as special occasion treat. For Sviata Vecheria (Christmas Eve Supper) in many regions of Ukraine holubtsi constitute one of the twelve traditional dishes served on the night. Only Lenten ingredients are used in this case. On occasion of Sviata Vecheria, Boykos and Transcarpathians make Holubtsi from &quot;kryzhavky&quot; (pickled whole heads of cabbage). Into these &quot;pickled&quot; holubtsi they put a stuffing of rice and mushrooms. Carpathian-style holubtsi are usually made from fresh cabbage and stuffed with corn grits, or with grated raw potato (Vorokhta, Verkhovyna, Kvasy). These are best served with mushroom gravy. To differentiate the different types of holubtsi, they are wrapped into different shapes: corn-filled ones are made into the shape of envelopes, with the edges folded in, potato-filled are simply rolled up. A classic Halychian (Galician) Sviata Vecheria dish is holubtsi stuffed with grated potato and served with a mushroom machanka (dipping sauce). 

On May 4, 2023, the cooking of holubtsi, a Ukrainian traditional dish, was inscribed in the National Inventory of Elements of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Ukraine.

==== Russia ====

The Russian version of cabbage rolls usually consists of minced meat mixed with cooked rice (or buckwheat) wrapped in cabbage leaves and stewed in a mixture of either sour cream or tomato sauce or both. 

There is an easier-to-make variation of that dish called &quot;lenivye golubtsy&quot; (e.g. &quot;lazy&quot; cabbage rolls): the cabbage is chopped and mixed with minced meat and rice so there is no need to wrap every meatball in a cabbage leaf.

As for the bell pepper variant the dish, the Russians refer to it as &quot;perchiki&quot; (&quot;little peppers&quot;, even though bell peppers are big among peppers)

====Sweden and Finland====
&quot;Kåldolmar&quot; (&quot;cabbage dolma&quot;) are Swedish cabbage rolls filled with rice and minced meat (most often pork). They are traditionally eaten with boiled or mashed potatoes, gravy, and lingonberry jam. In Finland the same dish is known as &quot;kaalikääryle&quot; (plural &quot;kaalikääryleet&quot;).

In 1709, after losing the Battle of Poltava, the wounded Charles XII of Sweden and the remnants of his army escaped with their Cossack allies to the Ottoman town of Bender, in present-day Moldavia, where they were granted refuge by Sultan Ahmed III. Charles XII spent more than five years in the Ottoman Empire, trying to convince the Sultan to help him defeat the Russians. When he finally returned to Sweden in 1715, he was followed by his Ottoman creditors and their cooks. The creditors remained in Sweden at least until 1732; it is generally believed that Ottoman style dolma were introduced into Swedish cooking during this period.

As indicated by the name, Swedish &quot;kåldolmar&quot; are generally considered a variety of the dolma. Swedish is the only European language to use the Turkish term dolma (&quot;filled&quot;) to denote cabbage rolls.

The earliest known Swedish recipe for &quot;Dolma&quot; is in the 1765 edition of the famous cookbook of Cajsa Warg. Warg instructed her readers to prepare the rolls using vine leaves, lamb, rice, and lemon juice. Toward the end of the recipe, however, Warg suggested that those who could not afford vine leaves could use preboiled cabbage leaves in their place. Nowadays, frozen &quot;kåldolmar&quot;, cooked with preboiled cabbage leaves, are sold in most major food stores in Sweden.

To cherish early modern cultural interchange between Sweden and the Orient, the Cabbage Dolma Day (Kåldolmens dag) is celebrated on November 30, the day Charles XII was killed during a military campaign in Norway. The celebrations were instated in 2010 by a group known as the Friends of the Cabbage Dolma (Kåldolmens vänner). In a series of media appearances, historian Petter Hellström explained that the group wanted to make November 30 a day to remember and ponder the multifaceted roots of Sweden&#x27;s cultural heritage, apparently in contrast to the same day&#x27;s long history as the unofficial marching day of Swedish fascism and right wing extremism. Starting in 2013, the Cabbage Dolma Day was hosted by the Swedish History Museum in Stockholm, the country&#x27;s foremost historical museum. The celebrations have also been supported by a number of important civil society organizations over the years, notably the Church of Sweden and the Federation of Local History and Folk Culture (Sveriges hembygdsförbund).

===Africa===
====Egypt====
In Egyptian cuisine, cabbage rolls are called محشي كرمب, pronounced &quot;maḥshī kromb&quot; or &quot;maḥshī koronb&quot; (as Standard Arabic [m] often turns to [n] in proximity to [b] in Egyptian Arabic), literally translating to &quot;stuffed cabbage&quot;. The leaves are fresh and commonly cut into smaller pieces and partially pre-cooked. The most common filling is a mixture of rice, onion, tomato, herbs, and spices (most typically including mint, dill, and cumin); meat is rarely used in Egyptian stuffed cabbage. The rolls are arranged in a pot and boiled in broth or tomato-based sauce, also including the herbs and spices. As the pieces of cabbage and therefore the rolls are small, the leaves are usually simply rolled around the filling almost like a small cigar, and are left open at the ends rather than folded around the filling to produce a completely enclosed package.

=== Americas ===
====United States====
In regions heavily influenced by Polish immigrants, such as Chicago which claims the largest Polish population outside of Poland, Detroit, Pennsylvania, the southern tier of New York, and northeastern Ohio, the term usually refers instead to stuffed cabbage rolls, such as the Polish gołąbki. These are also known as &quot;pigs in a blanket&quot;. Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe popularized the dish in New York City, where they became known as &quot;Jewish cabbage&quot;.

Cabbage rolls also feature prominently in the cuisines of Cajuns and Louisiana Creoles of southern Louisiana, where they usually take the form of ground pork mixed with rice and chopped vegetables stuffed into parboiled cabbage leaves and cooked in a tomato sauce-based liquid.

Romani Americans, Hungarian Americans, Chinese Americans and Vietnamese Americans often cook cabbage rolls.

Romani people in the United States eat &quot;sarmi&quot; which is made with cabbage leaves stuffed with pork, onions, peppers, rice, and tomatoes.

===Asia===
====China====
In Chinese cuisine, cabbage rolls are called 白菜卷, pronounced &quot;báicài juǎn&quot;.

<text>The marching ants effect is an animation technique often found in selection tools of computer graphics programs. It helps the user to distinguish the selection border from the image background by animating the border. The border is a dotted or dashed line where the dashes seem to move slowly sideways and up and down. This creates an illusion of &quot;ants marching in line&quot; as the black and white parts of the line start to move. Some prefer the term marquee selection, as the effect resembles the chaser lights of a marquee, and this term can be considered a synonym. Popular graphics programs, such as the GIMP and Adobe Photoshop, implement their selection tools using the &quot;marching ants&quot; effect. The technique was first widely used by the MacPaint program developed by Bill Atkinson.
The easiest way to achieve this animation is by drawing the selection using a pen pattern that contains diagonal lines. If the selection outline is only one pixel thick, the slices out of the pattern will then look like a dashed line, and the animation can easily be achieved by simply shifting the pattern one pixel sideways and redrawing the outline. The method has the disadvantage of not looking like marching ants with selection borders that are not parallel to the coordinate axes.

== Origin ==

With the selection problem in mind, Bill Atkinson went to his favorite pub in Los Gatos. Something on the wall caught his attention. It was an electric Hamm&#x27;s Beer sign. The beer sign consisted of an illuminated scene of a kind of animated waterfall. Water seemed to flow down the waterfall into the lake. Bill figured that this effect could solve his problem because it is easily recognizable.

He implemented the idea and showed it to Rod Perkins from the Lisa team, who told Bill the effect reminded him of &quot;marching ants&quot;.

<doc id="1175388" wikidata="Q3328618" url="?curid=1175388" title="Classical music of the United States">
<text>American [[classical music]] is music written in the United States in the Classical music tradition, which originated in Europe. In many cases, beginning in the 18th century, it has been influenced by American folk music styles; and from the 20th century to the present day it has often been influenced by American folk music and sometimes jazz.
==Beginnings==
The earliest American classical music consists of part-songs used in religious services during Colonial times. The first music of this type in America were the psalm books, such as the Ainsworth Psalter, brought over from Europe by the settlers of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. The first music publication in English-speaking North America — indeed the first publication of any kind — was the Bay Psalm Book of 1640.
Many American composers of this period worked (like Benjamin West and the young Samuel Morse in painting) exclusively with European models, while others, such as William Billings, Supply Belcher, Daniel Read, Oliver Holden, Justin Morgan, Andrew Law, Timothy Swan, Jacob Kimball Jr., Jeremiah Ingalls, and John Wyeth, also known as the First New England School or Yankee tunesmiths, developed a native style almost entirely independent of the most prestigious European models, though it drew on the practice of West Gallery music composers such as William Tans&#x27;ur and Aaron Williams. Many of these composers were amateurs, and many were singers: they developed new forms of sacred music, such as the fuguing tune, suitable for performance by amateurs, and often using harmonic methods which would have been considered bizarre by contemporary European standards.

Some of the most unusual innovators were composers such as Anthony Philip Heinrich, who received some formal instrumental training but were entirely self-taught in composition. Heinrich traveled extensively throughout the interior of the young United States in the early 19th century, recording his experiences with colorful orchestral and chamber music which had almost nothing in common with the music being composed in Europe. Heinrich was the first American composer to write for symphony orchestra, as well as the first to conduct a Beethoven symphony in the United States (in Lexington, Kentucky in 1817).
Because the United States is made up of many states, some of which were parts of other empires, the classical music of the nation has derived from those empires respectively. The earliest classical music in what is now California, and other former Spanish colonies, was the renaissance polyphony of Spain. This sacred classical music was provided to support the liturgy of the Catholic Church.

Other early American composers: William Selby, Victor Pelissier, John Christopher Moller, Alexander Reinagle, Benjamin Carr, William Brown, James Hewitt, Mr. Newman (Three Sonatas, for the piano forte or harpsichord, New York 1807).

== Second New England School ==
During the mid to late 19th century, a vigorous tradition of home-grown classical music developed, especially in New England. Academics view this development as pivotal in the history of American classical music because it established the characteristics that set it apart from its European ancestors. This initiative was driven by musicians who wanted to produce American indigenous music. John Knowles Paine is recognized as the leader of this group.

The composers of the Second New England School included Paine&#x27;s colleagues and students such as George Whitefield Chadwick, Amy Beach, Edward MacDowell, Arthur Foote, and Horatio Parker, who was the teacher of Charles Ives. Together with Paine, the group was also known as the Boston Six. Many of these composers went to Europe — especially Germany — to study, but returned to the United States to compose, perform, and acquire students. Some of their stylistic descendants include 20th-century composers such as Howard Hanson, Walter Piston, and Roger Sessions. Ives was considered the last of the Second New England School composers although his music is viewed by some as one that still drew influence from European tradition mixed with modernism.

== 20th century ==

In the early 20th century, George Gershwin was greatly influenced by African American music. He created a convincing synthesis of music from several traditions. Similarly inclined was Leonard Bernstein, who at times mixed non-tonal music with Jazz in his classical compositions. Leroy Anderson, Ferde Grofe, Morton Gould, and William Grant Still also composed pieces in the &quot;symphonic jazz&quot; vein. Florence Price often used elements of African American spiritual music to compose pieces in the European classical tradition.

Many of the major classical composers of the 20th century were influenced by folk traditions, none more quintessentially, perhaps, than Charles Ives or Aaron Copland. Other composers adopted features of folk music, from the Appalachians, the plains and elsewhere, including Roy Harris, Elmer Bernstein, David Diamond, Elie Siegmeister, and others. Yet other early to mid-20th-century composers continued in the more experimental traditions, including such figures as Charles Ives, George Antheil, and Henry Cowell. Others, such as Samuel Barber, captured a period of Americana in such pieces as &quot;Knoxville: Summer of 1915&quot;.
The 20th century also saw important works published by such significant immigrant composers as Igor Stravinsky and Arnold Schoenberg, who came to America for a variety of reasons, including political persecution, aesthetic freedom and economic opportunity. See Modernism (music) for more information on the rise of Modernism in America and throughout the world.

Minimalism is a musical movement that started in the early 1960s in New York City. Composers such as Philip Glass, Steve Reich, and John Adams (composer) used experimental composition techniques such as drones, phasing, repeated motifs, sharp contrasts between mixed meters, simple but often abrupt movements between minor and major chords with the same root, contrasts between tonality and atonality, and a large amount of use of synthesizers to display the interplay of the fundamental building blocks of music: the cancellation and amplification of wavelengths that make up all acoustic and synthesized sound. As is often the case in art, the rise of American minimalism in music paralleled the rise of minimalism as an artistic style, which used the contrast of black and white, the gradual movement of shading with gradients, and also often repeated concepts and themes.

In the 1970s and 1980s, the postmodern music movement would see the rise of composers such American composers like John Cage who adopted atonal structures and took an experimental approach to music composition, most famously and controversially with his 1952 piece 4&#x27;33&quot;, for which there are no notes written on the page and the music is described to consist of the sounds of the immediate environment of the audience, thus extending the definition of music to consist of any and all sounds even though they are without a composer created structure. Another more current, example of postmodern music is that of American composer Miguel del Águila, who blends American idioms with those of his Hispanic, Latin American roots.
In the 20th century, incidental music saw new heights with the development of the full orchestrated film score. Drawing from the opera styles of composition and the rules of Richard Wagner (specifically the idea of Gesamtkunstwerk), many early soundtracks include overtures, intermission music, and medleys and concert suites and a repeat or use of the overture for the end credits, depending on whether the movie was showing opening or ending credits. Over the evolution of the cinema the music took on greater and greater sophistication with the inclusion of advanced instrument techniques, a multiplicity of musical genre in any given work, and multicultural structures and instrumentation as the film industry, and therefore the music composition industry, became more globalized. It exploded in the 1990s in America with the release of many different blockbuster films and a high demand for fully orchestrated soundtracks, but is now often replaced with soundtracks that are entirely synthesized or utilize covers songs of famous popular songs or are even composed by popular performers, such as in the soundtrack for the 1997 film &quot;Titanic&quot; (&quot;&quot;) and the use of many popular songs for specific historical references in the soundtrack for the movie &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; (&quot;Forrest Gump&quot; (soundtrack)). Because of the growing common practice of using popular songs combined with a more classical soundtrack, it became a standard to release two soundtracks with one made of up the popular genre selected songs, and the original score or film score as mentioned previously. Significant American composers of film music include Danny Elfman, Michael Giacchino, Jerry Goldsmith, Bernard Herrmann, James Horner, James Newton Howard, Erich Wolfgang Korngold, Randy Newman, Alan Silvestri, and John Williams.

Classical and popular (non-classical) genre fusion compositions also developed in the United States, starting circa 1950s, with entertainers such as Liberace and composers such as Walter Murphy bringing classical music to different genre with their arrangements, such as in Walter Murphy&#x27;s disco-classical fusion piece &quot;A Fifth of Beethoven&quot;. Many disco versions of famous classical works were arranged in the 1970s, such as works by Beethoven, Mozart, Schubert, Wagner, Mussorgsky, J.S. Bach, and George Gershwin.

Popular classical works are also referenced and covered frequently in the United States, also starting circa 1940s-50s, in cartoons, famously in &quot;Rhapsody Rabbit&quot; and &quot;The Cat Concerto&quot;, both using Franz Liszt&#x27;s famous solo piano concert piece: Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2.

<text>The Atlantic Coast Line Railroad was a United States Class I railroad formed in 1900, though predecessor railroads had used the ACL brand since 1871. In 1967, it merged with long-time rival Seaboard Air Line Railroad to form the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad. Much of the original ACL network has been part of CSX Transportation since 1986.

The Atlantic Coast Line served the Southeast, with a concentration of lines in Florida. Numerous named passenger trains were operated by the railroad for Florida-bound tourists, with the Atlantic Coast Line contributing significantly to Florida&#x27;s economic development in the first half of the 20th century.

At the end of 1925, ACL operated 4,924 miles of road, not including its flock of subsidiaries; after some merging, mileage at the end of 1960 was 5,570 not including A&amp;WP, CN&amp;L, East Carolina, Georgia, Rockingham, and V&amp;CS. In 1960, ACL reported 10,623 million net ton-miles of revenue freight and 490 million passenger-miles.

==History==
===Early history===
The earliest predecessor of the ACL was the Petersburg Railroad between Petersburg, Virginia, and a point near Weldon, North Carolina, founded in 1830. A route between Richmond, Virginia, and Petersburg was built by the Richmond &amp; Petersburg Railroad, which was founded in 1836. In 1840 the Wilmington and Weldon Railroad, at the time known as the Wilmington and Raleigh and renamed in 1855, completed a route between Weldon and Wilmington, North Carolina. From Wilmington, the Wilmington and Manchester Railroad began operations in 1853 to Florence, South Carolina, where the Northeastern Railroad operated to Charleston, South Carolina. In 1871, the W&amp;W and the W&amp;M (renamed the Wilmington, Columbia &amp; Augusta) began using the Atlantic Coast Line name to advertise the two lines. An investor from Baltimore, William T. Walters, gained control of these separate railroads after the Civil War, and operated them as a network of independent companies. In 1897–98, most of the South Carolina lines in Walters&#x27; system were consolidated under the name of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company of South Carolina. In 1898, as the companies moved towards combining themselves into a single system, the lines in Virginia were combined into the new Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company of Virginia, and the lines in North Carolina underwent a similar process in 1899, becoming the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company of North Carolina. In 1899 or 1900, due to a regulatory climate in Virginia that was better suited to the company than that in other states, the ACL of Virginia took control of the other lines and subsequently shortened its name to the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company.

===Forming the ACL by mergers===

In 1898, Petersburg Railroad and the Richmond and Petersburg Railroad formally merged, and two years later the combined company took control of the ACL&#x27;s routes south of Virginia and the Norfolk and Carolina Railroad, which operated from Norfolk, Virginia to Tarboro, North Carolina. These mergers created an ACL system reaching from southern Virginia to South Carolina and Georgia. Other small acquisitions took place in 1901, and in 1902 the ACL took over the Plant System, which operated numerous lines within Florida and Georgia. This same year the ACL took control of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad as well as the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway, though the two were never merged into the ACL and were operated independently. The ACL acquired the East Carolina Railway in 1935, running south from Tarboro to Hookerton, although the 12-mile extension to Hookerton was abandoned in 1933.

The ACL&#x27;s last major acquisition was the Atlanta, Birmingham and Coast Railroad, which it purchased in 1927, though the AB&amp;C was not merged into the ACL until 1945.

Upon the formal incorporation of the ACL in 1900, an assessment was made of its repair and maintenance facilities. The oldest inherited shop site was at Wilmington, North Carolina, which dated to 1840. The shops in Florence, South Carolina were a bit more modern, having been upgraded in 1883. However, the sprawling ACL system needed larger and more modern facilities to handle locomotive overhauls and freight car building. By the 1920s the two largest shop sites were at South Rocky Mount, North Carolina and Waycross, Georgia, each of which employed about 2,000 workers. To handle extensions into Florida, in 1926 the ACL established the Uceta shops and yard outside of Tampa, Florida at a cost of $2 million.

===Later history===

By the early 1900s the railroad had largely reached its final configuration and began to focus on upgrading its physical plant. By the 1920s the railroad&#x27;s main line from Richmond, Virginia to Jacksonville, Florida had been double-tracked, which benefited the railroad during the 1920s when Florida boomed.

In 1928 the ACL completed a line between Perry, Florida and Drifton, near Monticello, Florida, the last link of the new &quot;Perry Cutoff&quot;. This created a more direct route between Chicago and Florida&#x27;s west coast and bypassing Jacksonville, one which passed through Macon, Albany, and Thomasville, the route followed by ACL&#x27;s passenger train &quot;Southland&quot; from December 1928 to 1957 when it was rerouted to Jacksonville.
During the Great Depression ACL&#x27;s freight traffic declined by around 60%, but the railroad survived the 1930s without declaring bankruptcy; its success in this regard has been attributed to its leadership and careful financial practices, as well as owning the Louisville and Nashville, which remained strong through the Depression.

During World War II ACL&#x27;s passenger traffic increased 200% and freight traffic 150%. The railroad provided a submarine-proof alternative to coastal shipping, and it also served the fast-emerging military industry in the Southeast. In 1942, Champion McDowell Davis (nicknamed &quot;Champ&quot;) became president of the ACL after starting with the railroad in the 1890s as a messenger boy. He immediately began an improvement program that finished in the mid-1950s, including the rebuilding of several hundred miles of track, the installation of modern signaling systems and improvements to freight yards. The railroad spent at least $268 million in upgrading its physical plant during this period. On June 30, 1955, the railroad retired its last steam locomotive.

In 1956 the railroad moved its headquarters, which had been sited at and adjacent to Wilmington, North Carolina&#x27;s Union Station to Jacksonville, Florida. Jacksonville was selected from three candidate cities, the other two being Savannah, Georgia and Charleston, South Carolina. Construction of the new office complex was finished in July 1960, with the move from Wilmington completed over the following weeks.

===Merger===
As early as October 1958 the ACL and competitor Seaboard Air Line Railroad had discussed the possibility of a merger, initiating extensive studies on the potential unified system. The results showed that the merger could save considerable money through savings incurred and reduced expenditures to the amount of $38 million annually. On August 18, 1960, the merger was approved by shareholders of both railroads. In 1963, a merger between the two companies was approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission, however, petitions for reconsideration were filed leading to a court decision to remand the approval of the merger on May 13, 1965, citing the Clayton Antitrust Act. Following another round of court decisions in 1966, the merger was allowed to proceed, and did so on July 1, 1967. The result was the creation of the Seaboard Coast Line.

==Lines==

The backbone of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad was its main line, which ran nearly 900 miles from Richmond, Virginia to just south of Tampa, Florida. By 1952, the company operated over 5,000 miles of track including the main line and numerous secondary lines and branch lines. The network extended as far west as Birmingham, Alabama and as far south as Everglades City, Florida at its height.

==Traffic==
===Freight===
During its early years, the ACL handled mostly seasonal agricultural products, but by World War II its freight traffic had become more diverse. During the 1950s, around 44% of all freight traffic consisted of manufactured and miscellaneous items, while bulk traffic like coal and phosphates also expanded during this time. During the 1950s, the ACL acquired some 13,000 new freight cars, to be used on high-speed trains offering reduced running times compared to earlier equipment. This allowed the railroad to remain competitive in the face of competition from the Interstate highway system.

===Passenger===

The ACL&#x27;s passenger traffic consisted almost entirely of Florida-bound traffic, largely from the Northeast, but also from the Midwest via trains that were operated by multiple railroads and handled by the ACL at their southern ends. In 1939, in response to the Seaboard&#x27;s popular new streamliner, the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot;, the ACL launched its first streamlined train, the all-coach &quot;Champion&quot;. ACL invested heavily in its passenger fleet after World War II but passenger revenue fell from $28.5 million in 1946 to $14.1 million in 1959. Until its 1967 merger the railroad continued to maintain and improve its passenger service, even replacing old stations with new.

====Major passenger trains====

All of ACL&#x27;s New York - Florida trains ran on the Pennsylvania Railroad north of Washington, D. C., then via the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad from Washington to Richmond. Tampa/St. Petersburg trains used ACL rails south of Richmond all the way to their destinations. Trains for Miami ran on the Florida East Coast Railway from Jacksonville to Miami, but after passenger service on the FEC effectively ended with a long-lasting strike in 1963, ACL transferred its Miami-bound trains to Seaboard rails at Auburndale, Florida.

<text>The British Rail Class 98 is a Total Operations Processing System (TOPS) classification that has been used to cover all steam locomotives used on the mainline in Britain, but also has a particular usage for the three Vale of Rheidol Railway-design locomotives that remained in the ownership of British Rail (BR) after the end of mainline steam traction in August 1968. The locomotives on the Vale of Rheidol Railway were the only steam locomotives ever officially to carry the British Rail corporate blue and the double arrow logo.

The number 98010 was assigned to an locomotive acquired by BR in 1987. This locomotive also worked the Vale of Rheidol and was sold along with the steam locomotives. 98010 was built by the Brecon Mountain Railway, using parts supplied by Baguley-Drewry.

==Vale of Rheidol locomotives==
These three steam locomotives, numbered 7-9 by the Great Western Railway and British Railways, were the only ones to survive in BR&#x27;s ownership after the end of mainline steam traction in August 1968. Under TOPS they were allocated Class 98 and were nominally numbered 98007-98009, but these numbers were never actually carried on the locomotives.

==Registered steam locomotives==

The Class 98 series has also been used for privately owned steam locomotives registered to run on the mainline since 1971. The first two digits are the class designation, in this case 98, the remaining three digits are allocated as follows:

The third digit represents the power classification, which was assigned (with a few exceptions) to all British Railways locomotives. The narrow gauge VoRR locomotives were not assigned a power class, but for TOPS purposes were allocated to power class 0. Three standard gauge locomotives have run on the mainline that were not previously in BR stock; &quot;Lady Armaghdale&quot; (Hunslet works No. 686 of 1898) was assigned power class 1F on the basis of its tractive effort, &quot;Barbara&quot;, a Hunslet Austerity 0-6-0ST (works No. 2890 of 1943/rebuilt 1962 as 3882), assigned power class 4F on the basis of the classification given to LNER Class J94 of the same design, and the new-build A1 Pacific locomotive &quot;Tornado&quot; assigned power class 8P on the basis of the power class assigned to the LNER Peppercorn Class A1 on which it was based. Additionally, two engines in LMS stock but not BR stock were given their LMS power classification 1P.

The fourth and fifth digits usually represent the locomotive&#x27;s BR number, with a few exceptions. Some ex-LNER locomotives have numbers based on their LNER pre-1946 numbers, these being Class A3 &quot;Flying Scotsman&quot; (4472), Class A4s &quot;Mallard&quot; (4468) and &quot;Sir Nigel Gresley&quot; (4498), LNER Class J36 &quot;Maude&quot; (NBR 673, LNER pre-1946 9673) and Class V2 &quot;Green Arrow&quot; (4771). Furthermore, the aforementioned locomotives not of BR origin obviously cannot have numbers based on non-existent BR numbers, so &quot;Lady Armaghdale&quot; number is based on the works number 686, &quot;Barbara&quot; on the works number of its 1962 rebuild, and &quot;Tornado&quot; is assigned the number it carries, 60163, being one greater than the last of the previous Peppercorn A1s.

In a few cases, this process results in the duplication of an existing number, so another is assigned. SR Class U 31625 is TOPS 98426 as it would otherwise duplicate GWR 7325 (TOPS 98425), BR Standard Class 8 71000 &quot;Duke of Gloucester&quot; (TOPS No. 98802) as it would otherwise duplicate GWR King Class 6000 &quot;King George V&quot; (TOPS No. 98800).

==List of locomotives assigned TOPS numbers==

The following is a list of locomotives assigned TOPS numbers. In the power class column, * denotes that this locomotive was not ex-BR and therefore was not assigned a power class by BR. In some cases the names indicated have only been applied during the preservation period.

The given power classes are based on the ones used in the locomotive&#x27;s TOPS number. BR changed the rating of a few classes e.g. LNER V2 were classified as 6MT, but this was later changed to 7P6F.

An up-to-date list of active mainline locomotives is maintained here.
