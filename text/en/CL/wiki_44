<doc id="1168808" wikidata="Q2268159" url="?curid=1168808" title="Scarlet (color)">
<text>Scarlet is a bright red color, sometimes with a slightly orange tinge. In the spectrum of visible light, and on the traditional color wheel, it is one-quarter of the way between red and orange, slightly less orange than vermilion.

According to surveys in Europe and the United States, scarlet and other bright shades of red are the colors most associated with courage, force, passion, heat, and joy. In the Roman Catholic Church, scarlet is the color worn by a cardinal, and is associated with the blood of Christ and the Christian martyrs, and with sacrifice.

Scarlet is also associated with immorality and sin, particularly prostitution or adultery, largely because of a passage referring to &quot;The Great Harlot&quot;, &quot;dressed in purple and scarlet&quot;, in the Bible (Revelation 17:1–6).

== Etymology ==

The word comes from the Middle English &quot;scarlat&quot;, from the Old French escarlate, from the Latin &quot;scarlatum&quot;,
from the Persian &quot;saqerlât&quot;. The term scarlet was also used in the Middle Ages for a type of cloth that was often bright red. An early recorded use of &quot;scarlet&quot; as a color name in the English language dates to 1250.

==History==

=== Ancient world ===
Scarlet has been a color of power, wealth and luxury since ancient times. Scarlet dyes were first mentioned in 8th century BC, under the name Armenian Red, and they were described in Persian and Assyrian writings. The color was exported from Persia to Rome. During the Roman Empire, it was second in prestige only to the purple worn by the Emperors. Roman officers wore scarlet cloaks called &quot;paludamenta&quot;, and persons of high rank were referred to as the &quot;coccinati&quot;, the people of red.

The color is also mentioned several times in the Bible, both in the Old and New Testament; in the Latin Vulgate version of the book of Isaiah (1:18) it says, &quot;If your sins be as scarlet (&quot;si fuerint peccata vestra ut coccinum&quot;) they shall be made white as snow&quot;, and in the book of Revelation (17:1-6) it describes the &quot;Great Harlot&quot; (&quot;meretricius magnus&quot;) dressed in scarlet and purple (&quot;circumdata purpura et coccino&quot;), and riding upon a scarlet beast (&quot;besteam coccineam&quot;).

The Latin term for scarlet used in the Bible comes from &quot;coccus&quot;, a &quot;tiny grain&quot;. The finest scarlets in ancient times were made from the tiny scale insect called kermes, which fed on certain oak trees in Turkey, Persia, Armenia and other parts of the Middle East. The insects contained a very strong natural dye, also called kermes, which produced the scarlet color. The insects were so small they were historically thought to be a kind of grain. This was the origin of the expression &quot;dyed in the grain.&quot;

=== Middle Ages and Renaissance ===
The early Christian church adopted many of the symbols of the Roman Empire, including the importance of the color scarlet. The flag of the Crusaders was a scarlet cross on a white background, with scarlet indicating blood and sacrifice. By a church edict in 1295, Cardinals of the church, second in authority to the Pope, wore red robes, but a red closer in color to the purple of the Byzantine Emperors, a color coming from murex, a type of mollusk. After the fall of Constantinople to the Turks in 1453, however, the imperial purple was no longer available, and Cardinals began instead to wear scarlet made from kermes.

During the Middle Ages and Renaissance, scarlet was the color worn by Kings, princes and the wealthy, partly because of its color and partly because of its high price. The exact shade, which varied widely, was not as important as the brilliance and richness of the color. The finest scarlet, called &quot;scarlatto&quot; or Venetian scarlet, came from Venice, where it was made from kermes by a specific guild which closely guarded the formula. Cloth dyed scarlet cost as much as ten times more than cloth dyed with blue.
=== 16th to 19th century ===
In the &quot;Assumption&quot;, by Titian (1516–1518), the figures of God, the Virgin Mary and two apostles are highlighted by their scarlet costumes, painted with vermilion pigment from Venice. The young Queen Elizabeth I (here in about 1563) liked to wear bright reds, before she adopted the more sober image of the Virgin Queen. Her satin gown was probably dyed with kermes. In the 16th century, an even more vivid scarlet began to arrive in Europe from the New World. When the Spanish conquistadores conquered Mexico, they found that the Aztecs were making brilliant red shades from another variety of scale insect called cochineal, similar to the European kermes vermiilo, but producing better shades of red at lower costs. The first shipments were sent from Mexico to Seville in 1523. The Venetian guilds at first tried to block the use of the cochineal in Europe, but before the century was over, it was being used to make scarlet dye in Spain, France, Italy, and Holland, and almost all the fine scarlet garments of Europe were made with cochineal.

Scarlet was the traditional color of the British nobility in the 17th and 18th century. The members of the House of Lords wore red ceremonial gowns for the opening of Parliament, and today sit on red benches.

The red military uniform was adopted by the English New Model Army in 1645, and was still worn as a dress uniform until the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914. Ordinary soldiers wore red coats dyed with madder, while officers wore scarlet coats dyed with the more expensive cochineal. This led to British soldiers being known as red coats. After 1873 all ranks of the regiments wearing red tunics changed to the more vivid shade of scarlet.

===20th and 21st century===
From the 8th century until the early 20th century, the most important scarlet pigment used in western art was vermilion, made from the mineral cinnabar. It was used, along with red lake pigments, by artists from Botticelli and Raphael to Renoir. However, in 1919 commercial production began of an intense new synthetic pigment, cadmium red, made from cadmium sulfide and selenium. The new pigment became the standard red of Henri Matisse and the other important painters of the 20th century.

In the 20th century, scarlet also became associated with revolution. Red flags had first been used as revolutionary emblems, symbolizing the blood of martyrs, during the French Revolution and Paris uprisings in 1848. Red became the color of socialism, then communism, and became the color of the flags of both the Soviet Union and Communist China. China still uses a scarlet flag; in Chinese culture red is also the color of happiness. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, the flag of Russia consists of red, blue and white, the colors of the historic Russian flag from the time of Peter the Great that were adapted by him from the colors of the flag of the Netherlands.

===Academic dress===

Scarlet is the color worn in traditional academic dress in the United Kingdom for those awarded doctorates. It is also the color of many of the undergraduate gowns worn by students of the ancient universities of Scotland.

In academic dress in the United States, scarlet is used for hood bindings (borders) and, depending on the university or school, other parts of the dress (velvet chevrons, facings, etc.) to denote a degree in some form or branch of Theology (e.g., Sacred Theology, Canon Law, Divinity, Ministry).

In the French academic dress system, the five traditional fields of study (Arts, Science, Medicine, Law and Divinity) are each symbolized by a distinctive color, which appears in the academic dress of the people who graduated in this field. Scarlet is the distinctive color for Law. As such, it is also the color worn on their court dress by French high magistrates.

=== Film and television ===
* &quot;Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons&quot; was a British 1960s science-fiction marionette TV series. The captains are all named after a color, including Scarlet, Magenta, White and Grey.
* &quot;The Scarlet Pumpernickel&quot; is a 1950 &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; short starring Daffy Duck, a parody of &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot;.

===Literature===

* The novel &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; by 19th-century American writer Nathaniel Hawthorne depicts the life of the fictional character Hester Prynne, who wears a prominent scarlet letter &quot;A&quot; (for &quot;adulteress&quot;) on her chest as a punishment for adultery.
* &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot; was an 1888 detective-mystery novel by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, introducing and featuring Sherlock Holmes, solving a baffling mystery whose main clue was a message painted on a wall in blood.
* &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot; was a popular play and novel about intrigue and adventure during the French Revolution, written by Baroness Emmuska Orczy. The play was first staged in London in 1903, about an English lord, Sir Percy Blakely (Blakeney), who wore a disguise and rescued French nobles from the guillotine during the French Revolution. He was supported by a secret club, the League of the Scarlet Pimpernel, and left the red flower of that name as his calling card. The Baroness later converted her play into a highly successful novel, upon which several movies were based. The hero, who lived a double life as a foppish British aristocrat by day and a disguised fighter for justice by night, inspired later heroes such as Batman and Superman.
* The novel &quot;The Scarlet Plague&quot; by Jack London tells of a terrible epidemic, which had decimated mankind in the future world of 2073. 
* In the novel &quot;Scarlet Sails&quot; by Russian writer Alexander Grin the protagonist, an imaginative young girl Assol, dreams of a beautiful ship with scarlet sails to come and take her away from the dismal fishing village. Partly due to the association with this novel, scarlet had become viewed as the color of hope and passion in Russian and related cultures.

===Military===
* In the modern British army, scarlet is still worn by the Foot Guards, the Life Guards, and by some regimental bands or drummers for ceremonial purposes. Officers and NCOs of those regiments which previously wore red retain scarlet as the color of their &quot;mess&quot; or formal evening jackets. The Royal Gibraltar Regiment has a scarlet tunic in its winter dress.
* Scarlet is worn for some full dress, military band or mess uniforms in the modern armies of a number of the countries that made up the former British Empire. These include the Australian, Jamaican, New Zealand, Fijian, Canadian, Kenyan, Ghanaian, Indian, Singaporean, Sri Lankan and Pakistani armies.
* The musicians of the United States Marine Corps Band wear red, following an 18th-century military tradition that the uniforms of band members are the reverse of the uniforms of the other soldiers in their unit. Since the US Marine uniform is blue with red facings, the band wears the reverse.
* The Brazilian Marine Corps wears a red dress uniform.
* Red Serge is the uniform of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, created in 1873 as the North-West Mounted Police, and given its present name in 1920. The uniform was adapted from the tunic of the British Army. Cadets at the Royal Military College of Canada also wear red dress uniforms.

===Religion===
In the Roman Catholic Church, scarlet robes—symbolizing the color of the blood of Christ and the Christian martyrs—are worn by cardinals as a symbol of their willingness to defend their faith with their own blood. Scarlet red, with or without the use of gold stripes, is the proper color in the Catholic church&#x27;s liturgy for Palm Sunday, for Good Friday, for Pentecost, for memorials and feasts of saints who were martyred, and for funerals of the Pope or for cardinals. In the Lutheran tradition, scarlet is the color for paraments for Palm or Passion Sunday, and for all of Holy Week through Maundy Thursday.

===Prostitution===
In countries that have traditionally been dominated by Christian ideas, scarlet is associated with prostitution. The Book of Revelation refers to the Whore of Babylon riding upon a &quot;scarlet beast&quot; and dressed in purple and scarlet. The phrase &quot;Great Scarlet Whore&quot; has been used by Puritans in the 17th century, and the phrase &quot;The Scarlet Woman&quot; was used by many Protestants and later Mormons in North America well into the 20th century. Scarlet and crimson are also linked to the Judeo-Christian concept of sin in the Book of Isaiah, rendered in the King James Version &quot;though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.&quot;

The connection of red or scarlet with prostitution was very common in Europe and America. Prostitutes were obliged to wear red in some European cities, and even today areas in European cities where prostitutes can work legally are known as red-light districts. Sex worker advocacy groups like the Scarlet Alliance use the striking color to associate themselves with prostitution.

===Sports===

==Variations of scarlet==

This is a variation on the standard RGB or Hex combination that produces a truer Scarlet color on some monitors. It is slightly more orange than the standard Scarlet RGB value of 255, 36, 0, but does give a truer color on displays where the red dominates over the orange and would otherwise make the color appear more as a normal red rather than a genuine Scarlet.

<text>Frederick Dozier Gardner (November 6, 1869December 18, 1933), an American businessman and politician from St. Louis, Missouri, served as the 34th Governor of Missouri from 1917 to 1921.

==Political career==
Gardner was born in Hickman, Kentucky; his father was William H. Gardner. He rose to prominence in St. Louis. The only political office he ever sought was a single term as governor, and he narrowly won the election of 1916. However, he did later attend national conventions of the Democratic Party.

As Governor of Missouri he oversaw the elimination of the state&#x27;s debt; it was $2,250,000 when he took office, but the state had over $3,500,000 in the treasury at the end of his term.

===Businessman===
In addition to his political career, Gardner spent 47 years in the funeral industry both as a funeral director and supplier, starting his career as an office boy. He worked for the Ellis Undertaking Co., M. Hermann &amp; Son Livery &amp; Undertaking, and the Southern Undertaking Co., all located in St. Louis. He eventually owned the St. Louis Coffin Co., and served as its president. He was also vice president of Gardner Motor Co. which operated in St. Louis from 1920 to 1932 and manufactured hearses and ambulances. He also operated casket manufacturing plants in Memphis, Tennessee; Texarkana, Arkansas; and Dallas, Texas.

===Personal life and death===
He married Jeannette Vosburgh in 1894 and they had four children: William King, Dozier, Lee, and Janet Gardner. He was also a Freemason belonging to the historic Tuscan Lodge #360 Masonic Temple. He died December 18, 1933, in St. Louis, from an infection of the jaw. He was buried in the Bellefontaine Cemetery there with full Masonic rites.

<doc id="1168826" wikidata="Q67485" url="?curid=1168826" title="Heinrich Berghaus">
<text>Heinrich Karl Wilhelm Berghaus (3 May 1797 – 17 February 1884) was a German geographer and cartographer who conducted trigonometric surveys in Prussia and taught geodesy at the Bauakademie in Berlin. He taught cartography and produced a pioneering and influential thematic atlas which provided maps of flora, fauna, climate, geology, diseases and a range of other information. He was a friend of Alexander von Humboldt and produced some of the maps used in his publications. A nephew Hermann Berghaus also worked in cartography.

==Life==
Berghaus was born at Kleve. He was trained as a surveyor, and after volunteering for active service under General Tauentzien in 1813, joined the staff of the Prussian trigonometrical survey in 1816. He carried on a geographical school at Potsdam where he trained Heinrich Lange, August Heinrich Petermann, his nephew Hermann Berghaus and others, and long held the professorship of applied mathematics at the Bauakademie. He died at Stettin (Szczecin) on 17 February 1884.

He is most famous for his cartographic work. His greatest achievement was the &quot;Physikalischer Atlas&quot; (Gotha, 1838–1848), with which, as in others, his nephew Hermann Berghaus (1828–1890) was associated with him. This atlas was used to illustrate Alexander von Humboldt&#x27;s &quot;Cosmos&quot;. It was planned to publish this atlas in Britain too, together with Alexander Keith Johnston, but it later was published in a different form by Johnston alone. Berghaus had also a share in the re-issue of the great Stieler &quot;Handatlas&quot; (originally produced by Adolf Stieler in 1817–1823, see: Stielers Handatlas), and in the production of other atlases.

The sections of the &quot;Physikalischer Atlas&quot; were:

* Section I. Meteorology and Climatology (15 maps) 
* Section II. Hydrology and Hydrography (16)
* Section III. Geology (15)
* Section IV. Telluric Magnetism (5)
* Section V. Geography of Botany (6) 
* Section VI. Geography of Zoology (12) 
* Section VII. Anthropology (4) 
* Section VIII. Ethnography (19)

Berghaus&#x27;s written works were numerous and important, including &quot;Allgemeine Länder- und Völkerkunde&quot; (Stuttgart, 1837–1840), &quot;Grundriss der Geographie in fünf Büchern&quot; (Berlin, 1842), &quot;Die Völker des Erdballs&quot; (Leipzig, 1845–1847), &quot;Was man von der Erde weiß&quot; (Berlin, 1856–1860), and various large works on Germany. In 1863 he published &quot;Briefwechsel mit Alexander von Humboldt&quot; (Leipzig).

In 1838, Berghaus became a correspondent, living abroad, of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands. When that institute became the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1851 he became a foreign member.

Berghaus is the namesake of Berghaus Island, one of the islands of the Franz Josef Land Arctic archipelago.

<text>The Grantville Gazette (Grantville Gazette Ior more recently yet,Grantville Gazette, Volume 1) is the first of a series of professionally selected and edited paid fan fiction anthologies set within the 1632 series inspired by Eric Flint&#x27;s novel &quot;1632&quot;. The electronically published the Grantville Gazettes, which are reaching long novel length with regularity, now make up the majority of the series in terms of words in print. Flint as series owner and editor accounts all as canonical. The Science Fiction Writers of America (SFWA) recognizes published stories within the Gazettes as qualified credentials for membership—which membership requires a writer to have three published works as prerequisites.

==Series premise==

The first novel, &quot;1632&quot; and resultant 1632 series share a common theme, which is to ask the &quot;What if?&quot; questions common to and characteristic of the science fiction genre: &quot;What if a mysterious cosmic event occurred which juxtaposed the location of a whole populated region of West Virginia with a matching portion of early modern Germany?&quot; Flint added the additional query to his premise: &quot;What if the two places also switched their respective places in time so that the region from our here-now traveled back in space-time to the land and peoples of 369 years ago?&quot; The series lands a fictional town of about 3,000 people (Grantville, West Virginia) in Germany amidst the chaos and disorders of the Thirty Years War.

==Story synopses==

===&quot;Portraits&quot;===

: by Eric Flint

The story deals with the decision to smuggle information about antibiotics to hostile forces besieging Amsterdam, where Rebecca Stearns is trapped. It features Anne Jefferson, introduced in S. L. Viehl&#x27;s &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; short story &quot;A Matter of Consultation&quot;. As well as presenting the moral and ethical issues implicit in aiding the enemy, the story focuses heavily on artist and diplomat Peter Paul Rubens, whose portrait of Jefferson forms the book&#x27;s cover art. The events of this story are referenced in &quot;1634: The Baltic War&quot; and other works in the series.

===&quot;Anna&#x27;s Story&quot;===

: by Loren Jones

The story focus on the farmer girl, Anna Braun, who fled from mercenaries that bowled over Police Chief Dan Frost and signaled the arrival of conflict and war at the opening of &quot;1632&quot;. It is a poignant story that was &quot;just barely&quot; cut from &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; according to Flint in the forward, mainly because Jones already had another tale in the collection, but also because of space considerations&quot;Ring of Fire&quot; is nearly 800 pages. The story also turns to the task of elaborating on her family&#x27;s fate, and introduces a lovable if idiosyncratic farmer who finds a new family this side of the Ring of Fire.

===&quot;Curio and Relic&quot;===

: by Tom Van Natta

The story centers on Paul Santee, a reclusive Vietnam War veteran and gun collector, who lives isolated on the outskirts of Grantville. Set in the weeks immediately after the Ring of Fire, Santee remains unaware of his current situation until being met by Eddie Cantrell, one of several outreach workers combing the remote regions around Grantville to make sure everyone is informed about the Grantville Emergency Committee&#x27;s edicts, and soliciting resources for the community. Furthermore, Santee learns that Frank Jackson wants him to join Grantville&#x27;s army as a trainer of cadre, as he has more combat and years of general military experience than everyone else in town put together. Initially Santee flatly refuses to reenter military service.

Reality intrudes when a band of men ransacks his remote cabin, forcing Santee to realize just how much times have changed and that he is now dependent upon others. He takes a position under Jackson and with the assistance of Eddie Cantrell begins to collect and organize the spare arms in the city, organizes an ammunition reloading program and trains residents who need help learning how to use their weapons. Going out with Cantrell to test fire and evaluate different load combinations in the three calibers selected for use by the New United States Army, the two stumble upon and combat brigands raiding a nearby farm. The down-timer Germans had chopped down several trees behind the battlefield of the Battle of the Crapper to gauge and evaluate the penetration power of the Grantvillers&#x27; firearms, and used the knowledge to create an armored (timberclad) wagon. Under fire from Santee and Cantrell, eight of the rogue ex-mercenaries use the timberclad wagon to begin to close on the position of the two Americans. Realizing their bullets will not penetrate, a wounded Santee bravely orders Cantrell to return to the arsenal and return with an elephant gun while he holds them in check himself. Santee and Cantrell managed to eliminate the brigands with the elephant gun. At the end, Santee agrees to become an unofficial advisor to the military trainers.

===&quot;The Sewing Circle&quot;===

: by Gorg Huff

&quot;The Sewing Circle&quot; takes a canonical look at the meshing of the resource limited &#x27;New United States&#x27; with the extant economy of war-torn central Germany. Four American teenagers set themselves the goal of launching a new industry, waging an uphill battle against adult skepticism as well as the intrinsic difficulty of the project itself. Armed with a father who has become part of Grantville&#x27;s Finance Subcommittee the one girl has a dinner conversation involving &quot;Federal Reserve [Bank] Fairies&quot;, who magically make more money and regulate the economy.

Another part is to convince the Germans and all the other down-timers that they are real, because they perform a very important function and it only works really well if most people believe in them.

Grantville, newly arrived in 1631 has some &quot;fast talking&quot; to do to have its money stand up and be negotiable specie. On thing which is surprisingly salable is things with plastics, particularly dolls that a rich nobleman might buy a favorite daughter.

Soon after, the four Junior High classmates, meet along the banks of a creek. Two, Brent and Trent Partow, are twin brothers, are mechanically inclined and the fourth, David Bartley, is smitten by the lass, the carrot-topped Sarah, who pines for one of the twins. Just to add more angst to David&#x27;s life, his mother is something of an overprotective loser and his father has long departed for greener pastures—and went back to his wife. The four kids realize resources are very limited, manpower is short, and that gearing down is absolutely necessary from the very beginning.

The kids&#x27; problems are just beginning. While Mrs. Higgin&#x27;s Singer is nearly 100 years old, the gap between early 20th century and 17th century manufacturing technology and techniques is vast—particularly for under-experienced would-be twin engineers not yet in high school. David turns out to have a head for organizing and management, and keeps the project moving forward with an able assist from his Grandma Higgins. She eventually bankrolls a big piece of the company, while David figures out how to make it pay. Sarah has a grasp of finance beyond her years, and teams with David—which he minds, not a bit.

===&quot;The Rudolstadt Colloquy&quot;===

: by Virginia DeMarce

This story is Virginia DeMarce&#x27;s second fictional foray in the series and like &quot;Biting Time&quot;, the tale establishes some important canonical underpinnings that draw references, or are extrapolated upon in the various novel sequels. This protestant (Lutheran) Colloquy is mentioned often in the first printed major works of the series, and occasionally crops up in the thirteen Gazettes existing solely as e-published works. The Rudolstadt Colloquy as historical background sits at the heart and center of the religious strife between Protestant sects which in the reader&#x27;s timeline continued to divide the new churches even as they collectively battled the Roman Catholic dominated world and that church&#x27;s Counter-Reformation, the effort to reimpose a uniform religion on all of Europe.

At the heart of the matter is the strongly held belief in the authoritarian philosophy, embraced by the nobility and churchmen alike, that a state cannot not stand without a uniform official religion. &quot;From the perspective of the princes, religion was important in the &#x27;here and now&#x27; because religion here and now was a way of making the population behave.&quot; To the modern mind, this seems a curious and perhaps incomprehensible point of view, but the modern man does not embrace the concept either that one class of people was explicitly set above all others and destined from birth to rule. Further, the position and power of all nobles draws from that belief and that of kings being the chosen and anointed protectors of both church and state, regardless of how well or poorly they conduct the business of taking care of the populace at large. Considered in that light, the colloquy and its results will be a major supporting event in the overall 1632 theme championing religious toleration.

In the Rudolstadt Colloquy, internal tensions within the Lutheran community are contrasted and displayed. In addition to their mainstream Lutheran church, Grantville sends representatives from two smaller up-time Lutheran sects, the Missouri Synod and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. Throughout Europe, both Catholic and Protestant countries either have heads of state attending in person or by proxy by sending a personal envoy to the long theological debate, which is chaired by the Graf Ludwig Guenther, Count of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt. Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt happen to be among the very nearest neighbors to Grantville&#x27;s geographic position. Schwarzburg, in the fictional canon, in fact is so close that the Ring of Fire (ROF) transfer of territory between space-time continuums actually cuts through the outlying houses of the town, and several more that did not go to West Virginia in OTL 2000 AD, slid down the &quot;newly formed&quot; destabilized cliff that resulted immediately after the ROF, as is told in detail in &quot;Schwarza Falls&quot;. Towards the end of the novel 1634: The Baltic War, Gustavus has charged Graf Ludwig with chairing and adjudicating an even larger colloquy in the city of Magdeburg (The Magdeburg Colloquy) to settle larger issues within his new realm.

==Fact Essays==

===&quot;They&#x27;ve Got Bread Mold, So Why Can&#x27;t They Make Penicillin?&quot;===

: by Robert Gottlief

A fact article about the problems and process of identifying and culturing the correct types of mold, and processing and purifying penicillin extract. A story in a later volume includes use of crude penicillin extract, based on real historical uses, and some culture samples found in a lab refrigerator at Grantville High School.

===&quot;Horse Power&quot;===

: Karen Bergstralh

This essay by Karen Bergstralh discusses horse breeds and their characteristics common and uncommon to the era of the Thirty Years&#x27; War and Europe. Work output, rates and other parameters such as strength, endurance, size, and so forth. Riding horses and even the gaits and tendencies of breeds for this or that trait are discussed in some depth.

==Literary significance and reception==
A reviewer for the &quot;Transcendental Basenji Sermons and Enlightenment&quot; that this anthology would &quot;almost certain to appeal to (mostly US) SF fans&quot; since the &quot;central conceit is that small town rural ‘plain folks’ Americans uniquely possess all the skills of their ancestors, the American sense of ‘can do’ to be able to survive and prosper in the alien environment of Europe in 1632, as well as possessing intact the political principals of their idealized 1776 fore bearers.&quot;

&quot;The Grantville Gazette&quot; was listed on the &quot;Locus&quot; magazine Paperback Bestsellers List for two months in a row during 2005, topping at number 9.

<doc id="1168831" wikidata="Q2707860" url="?curid=1168831" title="Alaa Mubarak">
<text>Alaa Mohammed Hosni El Sayed Mubarak (;  ) (born 26 November 1960) is an Egyptian businessman and the elder of two sons of Hosni Mubarak, the former President of Egypt who served from 1981 to 2011, and his wife, Suzanne Mubarak.

==Early life and education==
Alaa Mubarak was born in Cairo to Suzanne Mubarak and Hosni Mubarak, who became President of Egypt in 1981, ousted in 2011. Alaa attended St. George&#x27;s College, Cairo and graduated from the American University in Cairo.

==Career==

Mubarak has kept a much lower profile than his younger brother, Gamal who was involved in politics prior to the Egyptian revolution of 2011.

In 2011, he was arrested together with his father and brother and three of them later convicted for corruption in 2014. Alaa and his brother were released in October 2015 after completing their four-year prison sentence, which included time already served. The EU had imposed sanctions on all three of them, and froze all assets that Mubarak disclosed.

Alaa Mubarak has been named in association with the Panama Papers. In 2013, the British Virgin Islands financial services discovered that Alaa Mubarak owned &#x27;Pan World Investments&#x27;, an investment fund for the Mubarak family of nearly $1 billion incorporated by Mossack Fonseca, who said he was introduced to them by Credit Suisse.

In September 2018, Alaa was arrested along with his brother Gamal, and accused of manipulating the stock market. Alaa&#x27;s corruption conviction, along with the corruption convictions of his father and brother, was upheld by Egypt&#x27;s Court of Cassation the same month as well. Both Alaa and his brother were later acquitted in February 2020 of the 2018 illicit share trading charge.

On 12 March 2021, the European Union revoked the sanctions against nine Egyptian individuals including Mubarak family, adopted since 2011.

==Personal life==
Mubarak is married to Heidy Rasekh, with whom he has had two sons, Muhammad and Omar Alaa Mubarak. Muhammad died on 18 May 2009, aged 12. It was announced that he had suffered a &#x27;severe health crisis&#x27;, which was identified as a brain haemorrhage. He was checked into the Maadi Military Hospital for a couple of hours before being flown to Paris for further care, where he later died. His body was returned and buried in Cairo.

<doc id="1168833" wikidata="Q4867953" url="?curid=1168833" title="Bass Pro Shops">
<text>BPS Direct, LLC, doing business as Bass Pro Shops, is an American privately held sporting goods retailer that offers hunting, fishing, camping, and other related outdoor recreation equipment, marine manufacturing and sales, and outdoor resorts. The company is recognized by its retail stores, Bass Pro Shops and Cabela&#x27;s, that feature natural outdoor designs and decorations. Bass Pro Shops supports conservation efforts, organizations that support the United States&#x27; Armed Services and Veterans, and outdoor education and recreation for youth. The company partners with conservation groups, including Ducks Unlimited, the National Wild Turkey Federation, the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. The company&#x27;s headquarters, original store, and the Wonders of Wildlife National Museum &amp; Aquarium are located in Springfield, Missouri.

==History==

In 1972, 24-year-old Johnny Morris started selling fishing tackle out of his dad&#x27;s Brown Derby Liquor Store in Springfield, Missouri. His father, John A. Morris, was a World War II veteran and often took the family hunting and fishing, which Johnny Morris cited as what taught him to love the outdoors. People who bought tackle from Morris in Springfield continued to request specialized gear from him even after they left the area. To meet their demand, Morris created the first Bass Pro Shops catalog in 1974. In 1978, Morris introduced Tracker Boats, the first boat, motor, and trailer package designed for anglers. Eventually, those boats would be sold through Tracker Marine Group, owned by Bass Pro Shops.

In 1981, Morris opened the first Bass Pro Shops outdoor store in Springfield. A few years later in 1987, Morris bought an empty plot of land on Table Rock Lake in Missouri&#x27;s Ozark Mountains. One year later, at that location, he opened Big Cedar Lodge resort. The resort has five golf courses, and an outdoor arena.

The second Bass Pro Shops location opened in Duluth, Georgia in 1995. From then until 2004, the company opened 3–4 stores a year, and 7–9 stores a year from 2005 to 2008.

The company acquired Cabela&#x27;s Inc. for $4.5 billion in 2016.

In 2017, Morris opened the Wonders of Wildlife Museum &amp; Aquarium in Springfield&#x27;s Bass Pro Shops, which is considered the largest wildlife attraction in the world.

== Legal ==
In 2011, Bass Pro Shops was sued by The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) for failure to hire Hispanic and black applicants. In court filings, Bass Pro Shops denied all of the allegations and in 2014, Bass Pro Shops appealed the lower court&#x27;s ruling, but was rejected by the court. In 2016, Bass Pro Shops tried again and the U.S. EEOC asked the Fifth Circuit Court to reject Bass Pro Shops&#x27; appeal because Bass Pro Shops engaged in the practice of &quot;reckless indifference&quot; when it came to hiring minorities. In 2017, Bass Pro Shops settled its discrimination lawsuit with the U.S. EEOC for $10.5 million. The court noted that any payments Bass Pro Shops made as part of the settlement &quot;should not be construed as an admission of liability.&quot; The case was settled by a consent decree, and the court issued no findings on the veracity of the claims of the EEOC that there had been discrimination. As part of the settlement, Bass Pro Shops agreed to strengthen its diversity hiring and recruiting practices by posting job openings at schools with a significant minority population, participating in job fairs held in communities with large minority populations, posting job openings in publications that have been historically popular with Black and Hispanic audiences, and develop a diversity and inclusion section of its website that lists job opportunities and discusses inclusion efforts.

In 2022, Bass Pro Shops was sued for not honoring a lifetime warranty on &quot;RedHead Lifetime Guarantee All Purpose Wool Socks.&quot;

<doc id="1168834" wikidata="Q826083" url="?curid=1168834" title="Battle of the Trench">
<text>The Battle of the Trench (), also known as the Battle of Khandaq () and the Battle of the Confederates (), was part of the conflict between the Muslims and the Quraysh. The Quraysh advanced towards the Muslims, who defended themselves in Medina by digging a trench around their settlement at the suggestion of Salman the Persian. The battle took place in 627 and lasted around two weeks, resulting in five to six casualties reported by the Muslim, and three casualties amongst the Quraysh.

The Quraysh instigated the battle in response to the Islamic prophet Muhammad&#x27;s continued raids on their trade caravans, and thus decided to occupy his city base of Medina. Realizing that they had little military capability as they were merchants, they negotiated with the Bedouins to get them to join the campaign. The Banu Nadir, whom Muhammad had previously expelled from Medina, were also part of this effort and offered the Bedouins half of their crops in Khaybar to persuade them to participate. They reported to have gathered a confederate force of between 7,500 and 10,000 men, including Banu Ghatafan, Banu Sulaym, and Banu Asad.

Muhammad, having learned of the impending Quraysh advance, took the advice of Salman the Persian to have his followers make a deep trench to impede the opponent&#x27;s movement. The Jewish tribe of Banu Qurayza assisted with this effort by digging the trench and lending them their tools. When the Quraysh approached, they were unfamiliar with this tactic and struggled to get beyond the trench. Muhammad used the time to negotiate secretly with the Banu Ghatafan, sowing distrust among his opponents. After about two weeks, the weather deteriorated and the invading party withdrew.

The battle caused the Meccans to lose their trade to Syria and much of their prestige. After the battle, Muhammad was reportedly visited by Gabriel, who directed him to attack the Banu Qurayza. This led to the slaughter and enslavement of its population by the Muslims.

==Name==
The battle is named after the &quot;Trench&quot;, or &quot;khandaq&quot;, that was dug by Muslims in preparation for the battle as an act of defense. The word &quot;khandaq&quot; () is the Arabised form of the Middle Persian word &quot;kandag&quot; (; meaning &quot;that which has been dug&quot;). Salman the Persian advised Muhammad to dig a trench around the city. The battle is also referred to as the &quot;Battle of Confederates&quot; (). The Qur&#x27;an uses the term &quot;confederates&quot; () in to denote the confederacy of non-believers and Jews against Islam.
==Background==
The Islamic prophet Muhammad first preached his new religion, Islam, in his hometown of Mecca. At first he encountered no serious opposition from the people there, and their response to him was simply indifference, until he began to attack their beliefs, causing tension. A few years later, he moved to Medina after successful negotiations with the Banu Aws and the Banu Khazraj to mediate their tribal conflicts, the latter from which his great-grandmother came.

In Medina, Muhammad became fond of raiding and plundering Quraysh trade caravans, causing armed conflict between them. After Muhammad made a large booty after capturing the caravan at Nakhla during a holy month when bloodshed was forbidden by the Pagan convention, he sent troops to Badr to intercept a large trade caravan returning from Gaza. Abu Sufyan, who was leading the caravan, got wind of Muhammad&#x27;s plan and sent messengers on a swift journey to Medina for help.

The reinforcements camped near Badr, behind a hill not visible from Muhammad&#x27;s position. After the caravan had escaped, some of them withdrew, but others remained. Muhammad became aware of their presence after he captured their water carrier who was carrying water from the wells of Badr. Muhammad ordered his followers to close all the wells with sand except one for him and the Muslims, forcing the Quraysh to fight over the water and leading to the Quraysh&#x27;s defeat.

Wanting to regain their honour after the defeat at Badr and tired of Muhammad&#x27;s attacks on their caravans, the Quraysh sent an army, and a confrontation with Muhammad took place at Uhud. Muhammad&#x27;s side initially had the upper hand, but then the tables turned, and he fled to Medina. Thinking that this was enough to deter Muhammad, the Quraysh did not pursue him to finish him off. Nevertheless, Muhammad attacked their trade caravans again, making them determined to take over Medina, in part due to the encouragement of the Banu Nadir, whom Muhammad had previously expelled from the city.

==The Confederate==
Early in 627, the Banu Nadir met with the Quraysh of Mecca. Huyayy ibn Akhtab, along with other leaders from Khaybar, traveled to swear allegiance with Safwam ibn Umayya at Mecca.

The bulk of the Confederate armies were gathered by the Quraysh of Makkah, led by Abu Sufyan, who fielded 4,000-foot soldiers, 300 horsemen, and 1,000–1,500 men on camels.

The Banu Nadir began rousing the nomads of Najd. The Nadir enlisted the Banu Ghatafan by paying them half of their harvest. This contingent, the second-largest, added a strength of about 2,000 men and 300 horsemen led by Unaina bin Hasan Fazari. The Banu Assad also agreed to join, led by Tuleha Asadi. From the Banu Sulaym, the Nadir secured 700 men, though this force would likely have been much larger had not some of its leaders been sympathetic towards Islam. The Banu Amir, who had a pact with Muhammad, refused to join.

Other tribes included the Banu Murra, with 400 men led by Hars ibn Auf Murri, and the Banu Shuja, with 700 men led by Sufyan ibn Abd Shams. In total, the strength of the Confederate armies, though not agreed upon by scholars, is estimated to have included around 10,000 men and six hundred horsemen. In December 626 the army, which was led by Abu Sufyan, marched on Medina.

In accordance with the plan, the armies began marching towards Medina, Meccans from the south (along the coast), and the others from the east. At the same time, horsemen from the Banu Khuza&#x27;a left to warn Medina of the invading army.
==Muslim defence==
The men from Banu Khuza&#x27;a reached Muhammad in four days, warning him of the Confederate armies that were to arrive in a week. Muhammad gathered the Medinans to discuss the best strategy of overcoming the enemy. Meeting the enemy in the open (which led to victory at Badr), and waiting for them inside the city (a lesson learned from the defeat at Uhud) were both suggested. Ultimately, the outnumbered Muslims opted to engage in a defensive battle by digging deep trenches to act as a barrier along the northern front. The tactic of a defensive trench was introduced by Salman the Persian. Every capable Muslim in Medina including Muhammad contributed to digging the massive trench in six days. The ditch was dug on the northern side only, as the rest of Medina was surrounded by rocky mountains and trees, impenetrable to large armies (especially cavalry). The digging of the ditch coincided with a near-famine in Medina. Women and children were moved to the inner city. The Medinans harvested all their crops early, so the Confederate armies would have to rely on their own food reserves.

Muhammad established his military headquarters at the hillock of Sala&#x27; and the army was arrayed there; this position would give the Muslims an advantage if the enemy crossed the trench.

The final army that defended the city from the invasion consisted of 3,000 men, and included all inhabitants of Medina over the age of 14, except the Banu Qurayza (the Qurayza did supply the Muslims with some instruments for digging the trench).

According to Irfan Shahid, the Muslims adopted the tactic of using trenches from the Persians, possibly via the Ghassanid Arabs who saw their king killed at the Battle of Thannuris in 527 by this tactic. The adopting is reflected in the Arabic word for this battle, &quot;khandaq&quot; (), which is a borrowing via Aramaic from Pahlavi &quot;kandak&quot;.

==Siege of Medina==
The siege of Medina began in January 627 and lasted for 20 nights. Adding in the six days of trench-building, the entire operation lasted 27 days and was contained within a single month (5 Shawwal-1 Dhu al-Qi&#x27;dah). Since sieges were uncommon in Arabian warfare, the arriving Confederates were unprepared to deal with the trenches dug by the Muslims. The Confederates tried to attack with horsemen in hopes of forcing a passage, but the Medinans were rigidly entrenched, preventing such a crossing. Both of the armies gathered on either side of the trench and spent two or three weeks exchanging insults in prose and verse, backed up with arrows fired from a comfortable distance. According to Rodinson, there were three dead among the attackers and five among the defenders. On the other hand, the harvest had been gathered and the besiegers had some trouble finding food for their horses, which proved of no use to them in the attack.

The Quraysh veterans grew impatient with the deadlock. A group of militants led by ‘Amr ibn ‘Abd Wudd and Ikrimah ibn Abi Jahl attempted to thrust through the trench and managed to effect a crossing, occupying a marshy area near the hillock of Sala. &#x27;Amr challenged the Muslims to a duel. According to Shia sources, in response, Ali ibn Abi Talib accepted the challenge, and was sent by Muhammad to fight. As Ali went to fight Amr ibn Abd Wudd, Muhammad said about Ali, &quot;He is the embodiment of all Faith who is going to an encounter with the embodiment of all Unbelief.&quot;

Both the fighters got lost in the dust as the duel became intense. Finally, the soldiers heard screams which hinted at decisive blows, but it was unclear which of the two was successful. The slogan, &#x27;Allahu Akbar&#x27; (God is the greatest) from the dust confirmed Ali&#x27;s victory. The Confederates were forced to withdraw in a state of panic and confusion. According to Shia sources, Ali allowed Amr&#x27;s entourage to retreat; Ali never pursued a fleeing enemy.

The Confederate army made several other attempts to cross the trench during the night but repeatedly failed. Although the confederates could have deployed their infantry over the whole length of the trench, they were unwilling to engage the Muslims at the close-quarter as the former regarded the latter as superior in hand-to-hand fighting. As the Muslim army was well dug-in behind the embankment made from the earth which had been taken from the ditch and prepared to bombard attackers with stones and arrows, any attack could cause great casualties.

===Banu Qurayza===
The Confederates attempted several simultaneous attacks, in particular by trying to persuade the Banu Qurayza to attack the Muslims from the south. From the Confederates, Huyayy ibn Akhtab, a Khaybarian, the leader of the exiled tribe Banu Nadir, returned to Medina seeking their support against the Muslims.

So far the Banu Qurayza had tried their best to remain neutral, and were very hesitant about joining the Confederates since they had earlier made a pact with Muhammad. When Huyayy approached them, their leader refused to allow him entry.

Huyayy eventually managed to enter and persuade them that the Muslims would surely be overwhelmed. The sight of the vast Confederate armies, surging over the land with soldiers and horses as far as the eye could see, swung the Qurayza opinion in the favor of the Confederacy.

News of the Qurayzah&#x27;s supposed renunciation of the pact with Muhammad leaked out, and Umar promptly informed Muhammad. Such suspicions were reinforced by the movement of enemy troops towards the strongholds of the Qurayza. Muhammad became anxious about their conduct, and realised the grave potential danger the Qurayza posed. Because of his pact with the Qurayza, he had not bothered to make defensive preparations along the Muslims&#x27; border with the tribe. The Qurayza also possessed weaponry: 1,500 swords, 2,000 lances, 300 suits of armour, and 500 shields.

Muhammad sent three leading Muslims to bring him details of the recent developments. He advised the men to openly declare their findings, should they find the Banu Qurayza to be kind, so as to increase the morale of the Muslim fighters. However, he warned against spreading the news of a possible breach of the pact on the Qurayza&#x27;s part, so as to avoid any panic within Muslim ranks.

The leaders found that the pact indeed had been renounced and tried in vain to convince the Qurayza to revert by reminding them of the fate of the Banu Nadir and Banu Qaynuqa at the hands of Muhammad. The findings of the leaders were signaled to Muhammad in a metaphor: &quot;Adal and Qarah&quot;. Because the people of Adal and Qarah had betrayed the Muslims and killed them at the opportune moment, Maududi believes the metaphor means the Qurayza were thought to be about to do the same.

===Crisis in Medina===
Muhammad attempted to hide his knowledge of the activities of Banu Qurayza; however, rumors soon spread of a massive assault on the city of Medina from Qurayza&#x27;s side which severely demoralized the Medinans.

The Muslims found themselves in greater difficulties by day. Food was running short, and nights were colder. The lack of sleep made matters worse. So tense was the situation that, for the first time, the canonical daily prayers were neglected by the Muslim community. Only at night, when the attacks stopped due to darkness, could they resume their regular worship. According to Ibn Ishaq, the situation became serious and fear was everywhere.

Quran describes the situation in surah Al-Ahzab:
===Muslim response===
Immediately after hearing the rumors about the Qurayza, Muhammad had sent 100 men to the inner city for its protection. Later he sent 300 horsemen (cavalry was not needed at the trench) as well to protect the city. The loud voices, in which the troops prayed every night, created the illusion of a large force.

The crisis showed Muhammad that many of his men had reached the limits of their endurance. He sent word to Ghatafan, trying to pay for their defection and offering them a third of Medina&#x27;s date harvest if they withdrew. Although the Ghatafan demanded half, they eventually agreed to negotiate with Muhammad on those terms. Before Muhammad began the order of drafting the agreement, he consulted the Medinan leaders. They sharply rejected the terms of the agreement, protesting Medina had never sunk to such levels of ignominy. The negotiations were broken off. While the Ghatafan did not retreat they had compromised themselves by entering into negotiations with Medina, and the Confederacy&#x27;s internal dissension had thereby been increased.

At about that point, Muhammad received a visit from Nuaym ibn Masud, an Arab leader who was well-respected by the entire confederacy, but who had, unknown to them, secretly converted to Islam. Muhammad asked him to end the siege by creating discord amongst Confederates. 

Nuaym then came up with an efficient stratagem. He first went to the Banu Qurayza and warned them about the intentions of the rest of the Confederacy. If the siege fails, he said, the Confederacy will not be afraid to abandon the Jews, leaving them at the mercy of Muhammad. The Qurayza should thus demand Confederate leaders as hostages in return for cooperation. This advice touched upon the fears the Qurayza had already harbored.

Next Nuaym went to Abu Sufyan, the Confederate leader, warning him that the Qurayza had defected to Muhammad. He stated that the tribe intended to ask the Confederacy for hostages, ostensibly in return for cooperation, but really to hand over to Muhammad. Thus the Confederacy should not give a single man a hostage. Nuaym repeated the same message to other tribes in the Confederacy.

===Collapse of the Confederacy===
Nuaym&#x27;s stratagem worked. After consulting, the Confederate leaders sent Ikrimah ibn Abi Jahl to the Qurayza, signaling a united invasion of Medina. The Qurayza, however, demanded hostages as a guarantee that the Confederacy would not desert them. The Confederacy, considering that the Qurayza might give the hostage to Muhammad, refused. Messages were repeatedly sent back and forth between the parties, but each held to its position stubbornly.

Abu Sufyan summoned Huyayy ibn Akhtab, informing him of Qurayza&#x27;s response. Huyayy was taken aback, and Abu Sufyan branded him as a &quot;traitor&quot;. Fearing for his life, Huyayy fled to the Qurayza&#x27;s strongholds.

The Bedouins, the Ghatafan, and other Confederates from Najd had already been compromised by Muhammad&#x27;s negotiations. They had taken part in the expedition in hopes of plunder, rather than for personal reasons. They lost hope as chances of success dwindled, uninterested in continuing the siege. The two confederate armies were marked by recriminations and mutual distrust.

The provisions of the Confederate armies were running out. Horses and camels were dying of hunger and wounds. For days the weather had been exceptionally cold and wet. Violent winds blew out the campfires, taking away from the Confederate army their source of heat. The Muslim camp, however, was sheltered from such winds. The enemy&#x27;s tents were torn up, their fires were extinguished, the sand and rain beat in their faces and they were terrified by the portents against them. They had already well nigh fallen out among themselves. During the night the Confederate armies withdrew, and by morning the ground was cleared of all enemy forces.

==Aftermath: Siege Of Banu Qurayza==

Following the retreat of the Confederate army, the Banu Qurayza neighborhoods were besieged by the Muslims. After a 25-day siege of their neighborhood, the Banu Qurayza unconditionally surrendered. When the Banu Qurayza tribe surrendered, the Muslim army seized their stronghold and their possessions for their acts. On the request of the Banu Aus, who were allied to the Qurayza, Muhammad chose one of them, Sa&#x27;ad ibn Mu&#x27;adh, as an arbitrator to pronounce judgment upon them. Sa&#x27;ad, who later died of his wounds from the battle, decreed the sentence, in which some of the men fighters shall be killed and some of their women and children enslaved. Muhammad approved of this decision, and the next day the sentence was carried out.

The men – numbering between 400 and 900 – were bound and placed under the custody of Muhammad ibn Maslamah, while the women and children were placed under Abdullah ibn Salam, a former rabbi who had converted to Islam.

Ibn Ishaq describes the killing of the Banu Qurayza men as follows:
A lot of scholars have however cast doubt on ibn Ishaq&#x27;s account and there is no reliable hadith about the exact number of people killed leading some to argue only prominent ones were executed. A number of individuals were spared when various Muslims intervened on their behalf. Several accounts note Muhammad&#x27;s companions as executioners, Umar and Zubayr ibn al-Awwam in particular, and that each clan of the Aws was also charged with killing a group of Qurayza men.

According to Ibn Ishaq&#x27;s biography of Muhammad, one woman who had thrown a millstone from the battlements during the siege and killed one of the Muslim besiegers, was also beheaded along with the men. &#x27;Ã&#x27;isha, one of Muhammad&#x27;s wives, is cited as describing the woman as laughing and chatting with her during the massacre, down to the moment her name was called out: &#x27;By Allah,&#x27; she said,&#x27; that is me.&#x27; I said to her &#x27;You poor soul, what is to happen to you?&#x27; She said: &quot;I must be killed.&quot; &quot;Why?&quot; I asked her. &quot;For something I did,&quot; she answered. She went away and was beheaded for her acts. By Allah,(&#x27;Ã&#x27;isha adds) I shall never forget her cheerfulness and her great laugh when she knew that she was to be killed.&#x27;

Ibn Asakir writes in his &quot;History of Damascus&quot; that the Banu Kilab, a clan of Arab clients of the Banu Qurayza, were also killed though this is not accepted by the majority of traditional Islamic historians.

The spoils of battle, including the enslaved women and children of the tribe, were divided up among the Muslims that had participated in the siege and among the emigrees from Mecca (who had hitherto depended on the help of the Muslims native to Medina).

As part of his share of the spoils, Muhammad selected one of the women, Rayhana, for himself and took her as part of his booty. Muhammad offered to free and marry her and according to some sources she accepted his proposal, while according to others she rejected it and remained Muhammad&#x27;s companion. She is said to have later become a Muslim.

Scholars argue that Muhammad had already decided upon this judgment before the Qurayza&#x27;s surrender and that Sa&#x27;ad was putting his allegiance to the Muslim community above that to his tribe. One reason cited by some for such punishment is that Muhammad&#x27;s previous clemency towards defeated foes was in contradiction to Arab and Jewish laws of the time, and was seen as a sign of weakness. Others see the punishment as a response to what was perceived as an act of treason by the Qurayza since they betrayed their joint defense pact with Muhammad by giving aid and comfort to the enemies of the Muslims.

==Implications==
The failure of the siege marked the beginning of Muhammad&#x27;s undoubted ascendency in the city of Medina. The Meccans had exerted their utmost strength to dislodge Muhammad from Medina, and this defeat caused them to lose their trade with Syria and much of their prestige with it. Watt conjectures that the Meccans at this point began to contemplate that conversion to Islam would be the most prudent option.

==Islamic primary sources==

===Quran===
The main contemporary source of the battle is the 33rd Surah of the Quran.

The Sunni Muslim Mufassir Ibn Kathir mentions this incident in his book Tafsir ibn Kathir, and his commentary on this verse mentions the reason and event of the Battle, his commentary is as follows:
===Hadith===
The event is referenced in the Sunni, Hadith collection Sahih al-Bukhari, it mentions the death of Sa&#x27;d ibn Mu&#x27;adh, as follows:

The Sahih al-Bukhari collection also mentions that after the battle, Muslims were to carry out offensive attacks against their enemies:

Muhammad in order to stop the attacks called for a counter-attack against the idolaters, He asserted to his followers before:
The event is also mentioned in the Sahih Muslim Hadith collection as follows:
===Biographical literature===
The incident also is mentioned in the historical works by writers of the third and fourth century of the Muslim era. These include the traditional Muslim biographies of Muhammad, and quotes attributed to him (the &quot;sira&quot; and &quot;hadith&quot; literature), which provide further information on Muhammad&#x27;s life. The earliest surviving written &quot;sira&quot; (biographies of Muhammad and quotes attributed to him) is Ibn Ishaq&#x27;s &quot;Life of God&#x27;s Messenger&quot; written some 120 to 130  years after Muhammad&#x27;s death. Although the original work is lost, portions of it survive in the recensions of Ibn Hisham and Al-Tabari. Another early source is the history of Muhammad&#x27;s campaigns by al-Waqidi (d. 823).

<doc id="1168845" wikidata="Q139921" url="?curid=1168845" title="Keflavík International Airport">
<text>Keflavík Airport ( ) , also known as Reykjavík–Keflavík Airport, is the largest airport in Iceland and the country&#x27;s main hub for international transportation. The airport is located approximately west of the town of Keflavík, Reykjanesbær. and southwest of Reykjavík. The airport has two runways each measuring approx. . Most international journeys to or from Iceland pass through this airport.

Keflavík is a hub for Icelandair and the airline Play. The airport is only used for international flights; all domestic flights use the smaller Reykjavík Airport, which lies from Reykjavík&#x27;s city centre. Keflavík Airport is operated by Isavia, a government enterprise.

==History==


===Early years===
Originally, the airport was built by the United States military during World War II, as a replacement for a small British landing strip at Garður to the north. It consisted of two separate two-runway airfields, built simultaneously just 4 km apart. &quot;Patterson Field&quot; in the south-east opened in 1942 despite being partly incomplete. It was named after a young pilot who died in Iceland. &quot;Meeks Field&quot; to the north-west opened on 23 March 1943, where the airport is still located today. It was named after another young pilot, George Meeks, who died on the Reykjavík airfield. &quot;Patterson Field&quot; was closed after the war, but &quot;Meeks Field&quot; and the adjoining structures were returned to Iceland&#x27;s control and were renamed Naval Air Station Keflavik, named after the nearby town of Keflavík.

In 1949, a passenger terminal was built by the Lockheed Overseas Aircraft Service. In its first years the passenger terminal was mostly used for troop transport as well as transatlantic technical stops; civilian airlines Icelandair and Loftleiðir were still based at the smaller Reykjavík Airport.

In 1951, the U.S. military returned to the airport under a defence agreement between Iceland and the U.S. signed on 5 May 1951.

=== Development since the 1960s ===
The presence of foreign military forces in Iceland under the NATO-sponsored Iceland–U.S. Defense Agreement of 1951 was controversial in Iceland, which had no military forces other than the Icelandic Coast Guard. During the 1960s and 1970s, rallies were held to protest the U.S. military presence in Iceland (and in particular at Keflavík), and every year protesters walked the road from Reykjavík to Keflavík and chanted &quot;Ísland úr NATO, herinn burt&quot; (literally: Iceland out of NATO, the military away). The protests were not effective.

Until the 1960s, the airlines Icelandair and Loftleiðir Icelandic were solely based at the smaller civilian Reykjavík Airport, which is situated within the city and did not have military access restrictions since its ownership was transferred to the Icelandic Government in 1947. Loftleiðir took delivery of its first Canadair CL-44 aircraft in 1964 and Icelandair took delivery of a Boeing 727 as Iceland&#x27;s first jet aircraft in 1967. These new aircraft were considered too large for regular operation on the shorter runway at Reykjavík Airport and both airlines began operations of their new larger aircraft from the longer runway at Keflavík Airport, greatly increasing the civilian passenger traffic through the Keflavík terminal. By the 1970s, almost all international traffic was moved to Keflavík, relegating Reykjavík Airport to serving domestic services and limited short-haul international traffic to Greenland and the Faroe Islands. The road from Reykjavík to Keflavík was newly rebuilt and paved by 1965 which greatly improved access to Keflavík Airport from the city.

The original Keflavík passenger terminal, built in 1949, was located within the military air base. Travellers therefore had to pass through military checkpoints to reach their flights The situation of having to pass through a U.S. military base in order to access the passenger terminal remained unchanged as civilian passenger numbers increased and was not ideal. Subsequently, in April 1987 the Icelandic government finished construction of a relocated civilian terminal which was located on the north side of the airport. The new terminal had separate access from the military area and was accessible without passing through the military area. The new terminal was named after Leif Erikson who was the first European to arrive in North America (, &quot;Leif Erikson Air Terminal&quot;).

The two and runways were large enough to support NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttle as well as the Antonov An-225. On 29 June 1999, Concorde G-BOAA flew from Heathrow Airport to Reykjavík (Keflavik airport). The Concorde had been there earlier. Due to its location, the airport is also an important diversion landing site for large aircraft in transatlantic ETOPS operations.

=== Since 2000 ===
The terminal was extended with the opening of the South Building in 2001, to comply with the requirements of the Schengen Agreement. The North Building was enlarged and finished in 2007. The United States military base closed down and was handed over to the Icelandic Government in 2006. The original Keflavík passenger terminal, built in 1949 and defunct since 1987, was demolished in 2018 to make way for new development on the airport site.

In 2014, a high-speed airport rail link to Reykjavík was proposed, which would be Iceland&#x27;s first passenger railway. As of 2023, proposals have not progressed past the planning phase but the route is safeguarded in local and airport masterplans.

The airport was used as a hub by defunct airlines Iceland Express and WOW air until it ceased operations on 28 March 2019. In September 2018, Atlantic Airways moved their operations from Reykjavík Airport to Keflavík Airport, as they transitioned to using Airbus A320 aircraft which are too large for Reykjavík Airport, having previously used Airbus A319 aircraft. Similarly, Icelandair moved all of their Greenland-bound flights, operated using De Havilland Canada Dash-8 turboprop aircraft, from Reykjavík to Keflavík Airport in 2022, to allow easier onward connections.

In 2016-2019 and 2023, Icelandair operated a domestic service to Akureyri Airport, only available for international connecting passengers. It was the only domestic service ever operated from Keflavík.

In 2016, the south terminal was expanded adding seven gates. The ramp area to the east of the airport was expanded in 2018, adding 13 remote stands. A new 1.2 km taxiway was constructed in 2023 by Isavia, which allows better aircraft traffic management at the airport. A major expansion of the airport began in 2022, with an eastern wing being constructed east of the main terminal. The first phase involved an opening an expanded arrivals hall in 2023, expanding the number of baggage carousels and the arrival retail area. As of 2024, it is projected that the rest of the eastern wing will be completed in 2025, adding 30% new terminal area compared to the current terminal, including four new jet-bridge gates, two new remote-stand bus gates and new spaces for retail units. As of 2024, a 1,900 square metre expansion of the south terminal is also under construction, on its east side.

As of 2023, a third runway had been proposed according to the development masterplan, along with new terminal piers and an airport city.

==Terminal==
The airport has a single terminal, originally called Leifsstöð. (named after Leif Erikson). A total of 13 jet-bridge gates and 17 remote stands are available. The terminal is split into A, C and D gates. &quot;A gates&quot; are located closest to the main lounge along the main hallway. &quot;C-gates&quot; are located past the main hallway on the upper level of the south building. &quot;D-gates&quot; are non-Schengen gates on the lower level of the south building. Airside, past airport security, one emerges into the Schengen side of the terminal. To access flights to non-Schengen countries (including the UK and United States), one must pass through passport control.

==Airlines and destinations==
===Passenger===
Although the population of Iceland is only about 400,000, there are scheduled flights to and from numerous locations across North America and Europe. The largest carrier operating out of Keflavik is Icelandair. The airline Play also uses Keflavik as a hub and is the second largest Icelandic carrier in 2024. The airport only handles international flights; domestic flights are operated from Reykjavík&#x27;s domestic airport.

The following airlines operate regular scheduled and charter services to and from Keflavík:

Taxis are available outside the terminal. Rental cars are available from various companies.

===Bus===
Public buses are operated by Strætó bs on route 55 to Mjódd bus station (located in Reykjavík&#x27;s suburbs); the public bus stop is not located outside the airport terminal itself, but is located a few hundred metres away, near the car rental area.

===Coach===
Private companies Flybus, Airport Express and others operate express services to Reykjavík, including stops and transfers to hotels.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On 21 July 2013, a Russian Sukhoi Superjet 100 airliner, prototype aircraft 97005, made a belly landing during a test flight. The cause was a crew mistake due to fatigue. They operated the plane manually in order to simulate failures.
* On 28 April 2017, a Primera Air Boeing 737-800 skidded off an icy runway.
*On 7 February 2020, an Icelandair Boeing 757-200 suffered a collapsed right main landing gear during touchdown on runway 10.

<text>Svetozar Boroević von Bojna (or Borojević) (13 December 1856 – 23 May 1920) was an Austro-Hungarian field marshal who was described as one of the finest defensive strategists of the First World War. He commanded Austro-Hungarian forces in the Isonzo front, for which he was nicknamed the &quot;Lion of Isonzo&quot;.

For his service during the First World War, Boroević rose to the rank of &quot; Feldmarschall&quot; before the end of the war in 1918, becoming the first and only Austro-Hungarian field marshal of South Slavic descent.

==Life==
===Early life===
Boroević was born on 13 December 1856 in the village of Umetić, Croatian Military Frontier. He was baptized in the Eastern Orthodox Church, most likely in the parish church in Mečenčani, where his father served. His father Adam Boroević was a Grenzer (border guard) officer, his mother was Stana (née Kovarbašić von Zborište). His father took part in wars in Italy, Hungary and Austro-Hungarian campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878. He was awarded the silver medal for bravery. As an old man, Boroević&#x27;s father had built a Serbian Orthodox church as his endowment in Mečenčani, which was consecrated in 1877. Boroević had a brother, Nikola, a colonel who also received Austrian noble status in 1917.

Some sources state that Boroević was an ethnic Serb or of Serb origin. Other sources regard him as an ethnic Croat or of Croat origin. Boroević himself stated that he was a Croat and that Croatia was his homeland.

===Military career===
====Early career====
He joined cadet school at the age of ten. After finishing grade school he moved to Kamenica and later Graz where he studied in military academies. He attended the Liebenau cadet school in 1875. After graduating from Military School he served as a Junior Officer in the army. He advanced quickly through the ranks. He was a corporal in 1872, and later on May 1, 1875, he became a lieutenant. He would also fight battles in Bosnia in 1878. In 1889, he married Leontina von Rosner, a daughter of a late Austrian colonel, Friedrich Ritter von Rosner. The couple had one son, Friedrich Borojević von Bojna, named after his mother&#x27;s father. The son died in 1918.
Boroević was awarded for his service in the capture of Sarajevo. Svetozar would eventually become a commander in the Croatian Home Guard. Before the First World War, he commanded the 42. Home Guard Infantry Division of the Croatian Home Guard. In 1903 he was formally released from the Home Guard, already having been assigned to the Imperial &amp; Royal Army in 1898. During war, the defensive troops were part of the Armed Forces commanded by the Supreme Army Command and could be used at the front. He distinguished himself in the Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878. Because of his service, he was awarded Military Merit Cross. Afterwards, he was promoted to the rank of Oberleutnant in 1880. From 1881 to 1883 he studied at the military academy in Vienna. Between 1887 and 1891 he underwent additional military training and worked as an instructor after that, and he would begin his teaching at the Theresian Military Academy. He would finish teaching there in 1891. Svetozar became a major in May 1892. In May 1895, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel. He would take control over a battalion of the 17th Infantry Regiment during the month of April in 1896. In November 1897 he was promoted to Colonel. Later he was appointed to chief of staff of the Seventh Corps of the Imperial &amp; Royal Army in June 1898, where he remained until February 1904. In 1904, he was promoted Major General and took control of the 14th Infantry Brigade. In May 1905, he was created a Hungarian nobleman (since Croatia was one of the Lands of the Holy Hungarian Crown) with the attribute &quot;von Bojna&quot; by the Emperor &amp; King. From 1907 to 1912 he commanded to VII Landwehr Division. On May 1, 1908, the monarch made him Field Marshal Lieutenant (Feldmarschallleutnant). In September 1909 he was put in charge of the VI Corps in Kassa. He became the commander of the Sixth Corps of the I &amp; R Army in April 1912 and on May 1, 1913, General of the Infantry.

====World War I====

===== Early War =====
When World War I started in 1914 he was in command of the Sixth Corps on Galicia in the Eastern Front. He would distinguish himself at these battles. On September 1, 1914, he became commander of the Third Army. He would fight at the Battle of Komarów. Later, in early October he liberated Fort Przemysl, providing a temporary relief in the Siege of Przemyśl. His troops then pulled back to hold positions around Limanowa, at the Dukla mountain pass, and elsewhere on the Carpathians, stopping the Russians from breaking out on the Danube. The Russian counter-offensive in February and March 1915 almost managed to push Boroević&#x27;s Third Army back towards Hungary, but they managed to hold just enough for the German reinforcements to arrive and save the already endangered Budapest and the Pressburg bridgehead. They then proceeded to join the general Austro-Hungarian—German offensive (with the Austro-Hungarian Fourth Army under Archduke Joseph Ferdinand and the German Eleventh Army under Mackensen) that pushed back the Russians and eventually retook Przemysl.
===== Isonzo Front =====
His actions on other sections of the war appealed to Emperor Franz Joseph and on May 25, 1915, he was given command on the Isonzo front. He arrived on May 27 with part of the Third Army with him and leaving the rest to Army Group Mackensen. There Boroević became the Commander of the Fifth Army, with which he organized a defense against the Italians to break countless offensives. He finished building defenses and managing the logistics of his army by the end of May. While there, Boroević&#x27;s troops contained eleven Italian attacks and he was hailed as the &quot;Knight of Isonzo&quot; in Austria-Hungary, while his soldiers adored him and called him &quot;Naš Sveto!&quot; (&quot;Our Sveto!&quot;). For valor in combat, he was promoted to the rank of Generaloberst on 1 May 1916. On 23 August 1917 he rose to the position of commander of the Southwestern Front, which was later renamed &quot;Army Group Boroević.&quot; He would later fight at the Battle of Caporetto. In January 1918, he opposed Hungarian proposals to split Austria-Hungary&#x27;s Army into separate Austrian and Hungarian units. He became Field Marshal on 1 February 1918 and was also awarded numerous medals, including the highest order for Austro-Hungarian soldiers, the Military Order of Maria Theresia. He led to defeat the southern prong of the last Austro-Hungarian offensive at the Battle of the Piave River. The front was maintained until end of October 1918, when the Italian army launched the decisive offensive of Vittorio Veneto and non-Austrian troops left their positions following the secessions of their nations from the dual monarchy (Czechs and Slovaks on 28 October, South Slavs on 29 October, Hungary on 31 October). After that Boroević fell back to Velden, where he sent a telegram to the Emperor offering to march on Vienna to fight the anti-Habsburg revolution in the imperial capital. It is not certain whether the Emperor was given this message (Boroević doubted it); the offer was refused on behalf of the Emperor. After the Imperial &amp; Royal Army had been demobilized by the Emperor on 6 November, Boroević was retired, by the I &amp; R War Ministry in liquidation, by 1 December 1918.

===After the war===

After the demise and disintegration of Austria-Hungary, Boroević decided to become a citizen of the newly created Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. He was not welcome despite offering his services to the National Council of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. So he stayed in Carinthia, now Austria&#x27;s southernmost state; his personal belongings, which were on transport in Slovenia, the former Austrian crownland of Carniola, were confiscated there. Boroević could not understand the mean treatment he had to experience, &quot;the only field marshal the Southern Slavs had ever produced&quot;, as he wrote in his memoirs.

Boroević died in a hospital at Klagenfurt, the capital city of Carinthia. His body was transferred to Vienna where he was entombed at the Central Cemetery (Grave no. 62 in the New Arcades to the right of the Church of St. Charles Borromeo). The grave had been paid for by the former emperor Charles, who lived in Switzerland then. He could not take part in the funeral, since he had been banished from Austria for his lifetime by the Habsburg Law since 3 April 1919.

==Honors==
===Honorary degree===
In 1916, with the approval of the Emperor Franz Joseph I, on the proposal of the Faculty of Law and the Senate of the University of Zagreb, Svetozar Borojević and Archduke Eugen were awarded the university&#x27;s highest honorary degree, &quot;Doctor Honoris Causa in the field of social sciences&quot;, for their victory over the enemy and especially for the protection of hereditary grudge, and rights and cultural progress of Croats (&quot;Ob eximia in limitibus imperii strenue defendendis ac imprimis in Croatum paterno solo iuribus atque litterarum et artium progressu tuendis merita&quot;). The award ceremonies were held on 30 January 1916 (for Archduke Eugen) and 1 February 1916 (for Svetozar Borojević) at the Fifth Army&#x27;s military apartment, 305 Military Field Post on the Italian front. Delegation for the award was made of Josip Šilović; Milorad Stražnicki, dean of the Faculty of Law; Fran Barac, rector; Robert Frangeš-Mihanović, sculptor; and Andrija Kišur, clerk.

<doc id="1168855" wikidata="Q819127" url="?curid=1168855" title="Supernatural (Santana album)">
<text>Supernatural is the eighteenth studio album by American rock band Santana, released on June 15, 1999, on Arista Records. After Santana found themselves without a label in the mid-1990s, founding member and guitarist Carlos Santana began talks with Arista president Clive Davis, who had originally signed the group to Columbia Records in 1969. Santana and Davis worked with A&amp;R man Pete Ganbarg, as Santana wanted to focus on pop and radio-friendly material. The album features collaborations with several contemporary guest artists, including Rob Thomas, Eric Clapton, Eagle-Eye Cherry, Lauryn Hill, Dave Matthews, Maná, and CeeLo Green.

&quot;Supernatural&quot; was a huge commercial success worldwide, generating renewed interest in Santana&#x27;s music. It reached No. 1 in eleven countries, including the US for 12 non-consecutive weeks, where it is certified 15× platinum. The first of six singles from the album, &quot;Smooth&quot; featuring Matchbox Twenty singer Rob Thomas, and co-written by Thomas and Itaal Shur, was a number one success worldwide and topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart for 12 weeks. The next, &quot;Maria Maria&quot;, featuring the Product G&amp;B, was number one in the US for 10 weeks. &quot;Supernatural&quot; is Santana’s best-selling album to date, the best-selling album by a Hispanic artist in music history, and one of the best-selling albums of all time, selling an estimated 30 million copies worldwide.

At the 2000 Grammy Awards, &quot;Supernatural&quot; won nine Grammy Awards, breaking the record held by Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot; for the most honored album. These included Album of the Year, making Carlos the first Hispanic to win it, and Best Rock Album. Smooth won Song of the Year, however the award went to Rob Thomas and Itaal Shur. Santana also won three Latin Grammy Awards including Record of the Year. In 2025, it was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

==Background==
After Santana&#x27;s record deal with Columbia Records came to an end in 1991, the band&#x27;s two subsequent albums for Polydor/Island, &quot;Milagro&quot; (1992) and &quot;Sacred Fire: Live in South America&quot; (1993), failed to attract strong sales and chart positions. Founder member and guitarist Carlos Santana felt the label were not giving the band any &quot;traction and acceleration&quot;. In October 1996, he met Island founder Chris Blackwell in New York City where he asked for his release. Santana told Blackwell that he had &quot;a masterpiece&quot; album in him, but felt Island was not the right label for such plans. Blackwell subsequently travelled to Santana&#x27;s home in Sausalito, California in an attempt to change the guitarist&#x27;s mind, but Santana persisted and he was released from the label without paying compensation for the early termination.

Santana, along with band manager Greg DiGiovine and attorney John Branca, approached several labels, but they struggled to find one suitable and the guitarist recalled that some considered him too old. In 1995, he was invited to participate in a documentary about Arista founder Clive Davis, who first signed the band to Columbia in 1969. Santana, with encouragement from his wife, approached Davis about the possibility of signing with Arista. Eventually Santana, DiGiovine and Branca scored interest from three labels: Arista, EMI, and Tommy Boy; the three were most interested in EMI, however, as they were willing to pay as much as four times as much money than the others. In early 1997, Santana entered the studio to start on &quot;Supernatural&quot; while the contract was being finalized, but he soon had second thoughts as he recognised Davis&#x27; ability to generate hit records. After the contract was scrapped in May 1997, Santana reconnected with Davis and later said he &quot;Didn&#x27;t rub it in my face. He said the company was still interested.&quot; However, Davis needed to see if the band were still a commercially viable attraction, so Santana invited him to attend the band&#x27;s upcoming concert at Radio City Music Hall in July, which featured a new line-up of the group. Davis was impressed, and offered to sign the band.

Davis agreed to sign Santana on the condition that he have some creative input. This did not bother the guitarist, as he felt &quot;safe&quot; with Davis and knew he would not be told to play anything &quot;crass.&quot; Santana complied and expressed his desire to produce more radio-friendly songs with strong melodies and lyrics that appealed to a broad audience. He convinced Davis that he &quot;wasn&#x27;t stuck in the &#x27;60s; I was adaptable to these times&quot;, and cited Miles Davis and John Coltrane as artists who had successful changes in musical direction towards pop in their later careers. Davis wanted &quot;Supernatural&quot; to surpass the sales of the band&#x27;s best selling album, &quot;Abraxas&quot; (1970), their second, by which time had sold over 4 million copies in the US. Davis wanted half the album to be &quot;vintage Santana&quot; in the style of their early hit song &quot;Oye Como Va&quot;, and the other to be &quot;the most natural&quot; collaborations of &quot;contemporary influences that Carlos was very much feeling.&quot; He found the task of contacting potential artists to collaborate with him particularly exciting. Santana maintained that &quot;Supernatural&quot; was never meant to be &quot;star-studded&quot; at first, &quot;but the songs really dictated different singers and different musicians.&quot; The album was initially titled &quot;Mumbo Jumbo&quot;, but it was changed shortly before its release. Davis threw a release party for the album at the Boathouse restaurant in New York City on June 1, 1999.

==Songs==
&quot;The Calling&quot; features guitarist Eric Clapton, who had attended the 1999 Grammy Awards ceremony which featured Santana performing with Lauryn Hill and asked Santana to call him if there was room for him on a future Santana track.

&quot;Love of My Life&quot; is a reworking of the third movement of Brahms’ Symphony No.3 in F major, which Carlos Santana called a &quot;glorious piece of music&quot;.

==Critical reception==
Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic noted that &quot;there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a track that doesn&#x27;t have a guest star, which brings up the primary problem with the album [...] it never develops a consistent voice that holds the album together.&quot; He added that the album is &quot;directionless&quot; but concluded by saying &quot;the peak moments of &quot;Supernatural&quot; are some of Santana&#x27;s best music of the &#x27;90s, which does make it a successful comeback.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writer David Wild also noted the number of featured artists on the album. He goes on to say &quot;Not everything is quite so appealing&quot;, mentioning the song, &quot;Do You Like the Way&quot; featuring Lauryn Hill and Cee Lo Green, saying that it &quot;seems a bit more forced.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
The album is one of the best-selling albums in the world, and has sold over 30 million copies worldwide, with 11.8 million copies sold in the United States alone. It is the best-selling album by a Hispanic artist, peaking at number one in many countries.

According to the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; in 2005, it was the band&#x27;s first album to peak at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 since &quot;Santana III&quot; in 1971, making it the longest gap between two number one albums, 28 years in total.

Arista had planned for an initial shipment of 125,000 copies, but the high level of interest in the album through word of mouth caused this to rise to 210,000. By the first week of June 1999, after the label issued a sample album to promoters, this number rose to 350,000. The album debuted at number 19 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and eventually peaked at number one in October 1999, selling 169,000 copies that week, it would increase its sales even more in the following weeks, selling 183,000 and 199,000 on its first three weeks atop. Its highest sale came in year&#x27;s final week when it sold 527,000 copies. Its sales would still stay in stratosphere after the Christmas holiday season, selling 583,000 copies after winning nine Grammy Awards in a night, it barely dropped in sales, selling again another monstrous 441,000 copies. Its last of 12 non-consecutive weeks at number one would still see huge sales, 307,000 copies that week, it later was replaced by NSYNC&#x27;s &quot;No Strings Attached&quot; after selling 2.4 million copies in a week. It also debuted and peaked at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Latin Albums chart. However, it was removed from the chart the following week after &quot;Billboard&quot; determined that the album did not meet the linguistic requirement of having at least 50% of its tracks recorded in Spanish. It was ranked on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s top 200 albums of the decade as the ninth best-selling album of the 2000s.

In Australia, the album debuted at number 48 and would peak at number one on March 6, 2000. In the UK, the album peaked at number one for two weeks starting on April 1, 2000.

==Singles==
Copies of the first single, &quot;Smooth&quot;, had been leaked prior to the intended June 15 radio release date and were picked up by some radio stations which began to air the song in late May. &quot;Smooth&quot; featured Rob Thomas on vocals, and peaked at No. 1 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for 12 weeks while it went to No. 3 in the UK and No. 4 in Australia. The next two singles were &quot;Put Your Lights On&quot; and &quot;Maria Maria&quot;; the former song was serviced to rock radio on August 24, 1999, while the latter was added to urban radio on September 14, 1999. &quot;Maria Maria&quot; peaked at No. 1 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for 10 weeks, No. 6 in the UK and No. 49 in Australia while &quot;Put Your Lights On&quot; peaked at No. 18 on the US Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart, No. 97 in the UK, and was a minor hit in Australia at No. 32. The fourth single, &quot;Corazón Espinado&quot; featuring Maná, was released on May 30, 2000, was a top-10 hit in Spain. On August 7, 2000, &quot;Love of My Life&quot; was serviced to US hot and modern adult contemporary radio.

<text>Francis Wheatley (1826 – 21 May 1865) was a British Army soldier and a Crimean War recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

He was born in Ruddington, Nottinghamshire, England. His father was a frame work knitter, a trade which Francis took up before joining the army. He was enlisted at Daventry on 5 November 1839 (for a bounty of £3.17s.6d) into the 1st Battalion Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort&#x27;s Own).

==Victoria Cross==
He was awarded his Victoria Cross (VC) for duty in the Crimean War on 12 October 1854. The day before his VC action, another act of gallantry earned him the Distinguished Conduct Medal. The citation for his VC reads:
On 12 October 1854 Wheatley and some other Riflemen were occupying a section of the trenches before Sevastopol when a live Russian shell fell amongst the men. Without hesitation Wheatley seized hold of the shell and endeavoured to knock the fuse out with the butt of his rifle. He was unsuccessful at the first attempt and so, with great presence of mind and deliberation he managed somehow to heave it over the parapet of the trench. It had scarcely fallen outside when it exploded. Had it not been for his coolness, presence of mind and supreme courage and discipline, the shell would have inevitably exploded amongst the party causing serious casualties, but instead not a man was hurt.

His VC was presented by Queen Victoria in person at the first investiture at Hyde Park, London on 26 June 1857.

==Death==
He died on 21 May 1865 at Westminster Hospital, London from acute myelitis (inflammation of the spinal cord) and asphyxia. He was buried in a common grave in Brompton Cemetery, on which a memorial has now been placed. His medals are on view at the Royal Green Jackets (Rifles) Museum and his name is on the memorial in Winchester Cathedral.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross and other medals are displayed at the Royal Green Jackets (Rifles) Museum, Winchester, England.

His other medals are:
* South Africa Medal
* Crimea War medal with 3 clasps
* Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal
* Turkish War Medal
* French Legion of Honour

<doc id="1168864" wikidata="Q3357762" url="?curid=1168864" title="Ottawa Citizen">
<text>The Ottawa Citizen is an English-language daily newspaper owned by Postmedia Network in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.

== History ==
Established as the Bytown &quot;Packet&quot; in 1845 by William Harris, it was renamed the &quot;Citizen&quot; in 1851.
The newspaper&#x27;s original motto, which has recently been returned to the editorial page, was &quot;Fair Play and Day-Light&quot;.

The paper has been through a number of owners. In 1846, Harris sold the paper to John Gordon Bell and Henry J. Friel.
Robert Bell bought the paper in 1849, and sold it to I.B. Taylor in 1861.
In 1877, Charles Herbert Mackintosh became the principal owner, and he later sold it to Robert and Lewis Shannon.

In 1897, the &quot;Citizen&quot; became one of several papers owned by the Southam family. 
It remained under Southam until the chain was purchased by Conrad Black&#x27;s Hollinger Inc. in 1996.
In 2000, the chain was sold to Canwest Global, which was taken over by Postmedia Network in 2010.

The editorial view of the &quot;Citizen&quot; has varied with its ownership, taking a reform position under Friel, and a conservative position (supporting John A. Macdonald) under Mackintosh.
When the Liberals defeated the Tory government in 1896, the owners of the &quot;Citizen&quot; decided to sell to Southam, rather than face an expected cut in government revenue.
In 2002, the &quot;Citizen&#x27;s&quot; publisher, Russell Mills, was dismissed following the publication of a story critical of Prime Minister Jean Chrétien and an editorial calling for Chrétien&#x27;s resignation. 

The &quot;Citizen&quot; published its last Sunday edition on July 15, 2012. This move meant 20 fewer newsroom jobs, and was part of a series of changes made by Postmedia.
The &quot;Citizen&quot; stopped producing a print edition on Mondays as of 17 October 2022, due to the costs of printing and delivery, but it continued to publish a digital Monday edition.

The pre-2014 logo depicted the top of the Peace Tower of Canada&#x27;s Parliament Buildings in Ottawa. In 2014, the newspaper adopted a new logo showing the paper&#x27;s name over an outline of the Peace Tower roof on a green background.

== Circulation ==
The &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot;&#x27;s circulation in 2009 was 123,856 copies daily.
Its circulation dropped by percent to 91,796 in 2015.

In Spring 2022, the &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot;&#x27;s unduplicated print and digital average weekday audience was 231,000, and its unduplicated average weekly audience was 490,000.

<doc id="1168875" wikidata="Q467505" url="?curid=1168875" title="Handbag">
<text>A handbag, commonly known as a purse in North American English, is a handled medium-to-large bag used to carry personal items. It has also been called a pocketbook in parts of the U.S.

==Terminology==
The term &quot;purse&quot; originally referred to a small bag for holding coins. In many English-speaking countries, it is still used to refer to a small money bag.

A &quot;handbag&quot; is a larger accessory that holds objects beyond currency, such as personal items. American English typically uses the terms purse and handbag interchangeably. The term &quot;handbag&quot; began appearing in the early 1900s. Initially, it was most often used to refer to men&#x27;s hand-luggage. Women&#x27;s bags grew larger and more complex during this period, and the term was attached to the accessory.

&quot;Pocketbook&quot; is another term for a woman&#x27;s handbag that was most commonly used in the United States in the mid-twentieth century.

== Origin ==
=== Antiquity ===
During the ancient period bags were utilised to carry various items including flint, tools, supplies, weapons and currency. Early examples of these bags have been uncovered in Egyptian burial sites ( 2686–2160 BCE) and were made of leather with two straps or handles for carrying or suspending from a stick. The ancient Greeks made use of leather, papyrus and linen purses known as &quot;byrsa&quot; to store coins, which is the etymological origin of the English word &quot;purse&quot;. The emergence of money further inspired the creation of drawstring purses, most commonly hung from a belt or kept in clothing folds.

A handbag was discovered with the remains of Ötzi, who lived between 3350 and 3105 BC. Whilst one of the earliest discoveries of an ornate leather purse came from Anglo-Saxon Britain, dated circa 625 CE, revealed from the burial site of King Roewald in the mounds of Sutton Hoo in Suffolk. Although the leather had deteriorated, its gold ornaments were still intact. Inside the purse was forty gold coins and it was held in place by a gold belt buckle and golden hinged straps. These features symbolised a display of opulence, making the purse part of a lavish suite of possessions.

=== Medieval period ===
The Courtauld bag, tentatively believed to have been made at Mosul in the early 1300s, is thought to be the oldest surviving handbag in the world today. It likely belonged to an Ilkhanate noblewoman.

=== Modern Origin ===
Until the late 1700s, both men and women carried bags. Early modern Europeans wore purses for one sole purpose: to carry coins. Purses were made of soft fabric or leather and were worn by men as often as ladies; the Scottish sporran is a survival of this custom. In the 17th century, young girls were taught embroidery as a necessary skill for marriage; this also helped them make very beautiful handbags.

By the late 18th century, fashions in Europe were moving towards a slender shape for these accessories, inspired by the silhouettes of Ancient Greece and Rome. Women wanted purses that would not be bulky or untidy in appearance, so &quot;reticules&quot; were designed. Reticules were made of fine fabrics like silk and velvet, carried with wrist straps. First becoming popular in France, they crossed over into Britain, where they became known as &quot;indispensables&quot;. Men, however, did not adopt the trend. They used purses and pockets, which became popular in men&#x27;s trousers.

The modern purse, clutch, pouch, or handbag came about in England during the Industrial Revolution, in part due to the increase in travel by railway. In 1841 the Doncaster industrialist and confectionery entrepreneur Samuel Parkinson (of butterscotch fame) ordered a set of traveling cases and trunks and insisted on a traveling case or bag for his wife&#x27;s particulars after noticing that her purse was too small and made from a material that would not withstand the journey.

He stipulated that he wanted various handbags for his wife, varying in size for different occasions, and asked that they be made from the same leather that was being used for his cases and trunks to distinguish them from the then-familiar carpetbag and other travelers&#x27; cloth bags used by members of the popular classes. H. J. Cave (London) obliged and produced the first modern set of luxury handbags, as we would recognize them today, including a clutch and a tote (called a &quot;ladies traveling case&quot;).

These are now on display in the Museum of Bags and Purses in Amsterdam. H. J. Cave did continue to sell and advertise the handbags, but many critics said that women did not need them and that bags of such size and heavy material would &quot;break the backs of ladies&quot;. H. J. Cave ceased to promote the bags after 1865, concentrating on trunks instead, although they continued to make the odd handbag for royalty, celebrities or to celebrate special occasions, the Queen&#x27;s 2012 Diamond Jubilee being the most recent. However, H.J. Cave resumed handbag production in 2010.

== 20th century ==
When handbags started to become popularized, they were heavily criticized as it was seen as unfeminine. In the early 20th century, Sigmund Freud argued that purses were sexually suggestive as the structure of the purse symbolized female genitalia and sexuality. Before handbags, pockets were secured inside of a woman&#x27;s dress which held personal items and retrieving items was done discreetly and modestly. Due to handbags being carried in the open, the accessory exposed a woman&#x27;s personal items. Freud compared women retrieving items from their purse as a representation of masturbation. According to Freud&#x27;s argument, women who carried purses openly displayed their sexuality due to the sexual symbolism of the purse.

As handbags grew into the mainstream in the 20th century, they began to transform from purely practical items to symbols of the wearer&#x27;s wealth and worth in society. The styles, materials, prices, and, most importantly, the brand names of purses and handbags became just as (if not more) valuable than the functionality of the bags themselves. Handbags transitioned from being seen as unfeminine, to being seen as specifically feminine and unmasculine. While women&#x27;s bags served as fashion accessories not meant to hold more than a few personal and beauty items (feminine things), men&#x27;s bags stayed more in the realm of briefcases: square, hard-edged, plain; containing items pertaining to the &quot;man&#x27;s world&quot;: business-related items, documents, files, stationery and pens. The gendered division between the personal bag and the business bag meets in the middle with the unisex alms purse originating in the Middle Ages meant to carry coins to donate to the church or the poor. The charitable symbolism of the alms purse later carried over to women&#x27;s handbags in general; a woman carrying a bag was seen as upper class and therefore potentially using the bag to hold her donations.

During the 1940s, the rationing of textiles for World War II led to the manufacturing of handbags made in materials like raffia or crocheted from yarn. Some women crocheted their own small handbags from commercial patterns during this period.

== Men&#x27;s bags ==

The oldest known purse dates back more than 5000 years, and was a pouch worn by a man, Ötzi the Iceman. Men once carried coin purses. In early modern Europe, when women&#x27;s fashions moved in the direction of using small ornamental purses, which evolved into handbags, men&#x27;s fashions were moving in another direction. Men&#x27;s trousers replaced men&#x27;s breeches during the course of the 18th and 19th centuries, and pockets were incorporated in the loose, heavy material. This enabled men to continue carrying coins, and then paper currency, in small leather wallets. Men&#x27;s pockets were plentiful in the 19th century and 20th century trousers and coats, to carry possessions, such as pipes, matches, and knives, and they were an item frequently mended by their wives.

Men&#x27;s purses were revived by designers in the 1970s in Europe. Since the 1990s, designers have marketed a more diverse range of accessory bags for men. The names man bag, man-purse and murse, mini bag have been used. The designs common in the U.S. are typically variations on backpacks or messenger bags, and have either a masculine or a more unisex appearance, although they are often more streamlined than a backpack and less bulky than a briefcase. These bags are often called messenger bags or organizer bags. In many other countries, it is common for men to carry small rectangular shoulder bags, often made of leather. The leather satchel is also common. Men&#x27;s designer bags are produced by well-known companies such as Prada, Louis Vuitton, Coach, and Bottega Veneta in a variety of shapes and sizes. The global men&#x27;s bag and small leather goods trade is a $4-billion-a-year industry. Sales of men&#x27;s accessories including &quot;holdall&quot; bags are increasing in North America.

== Types ==
* Baguette: a small, narrow, rectangular shape purse, resembling a French loaf of bread (baguette)
* Bowling bag: a popular 1990s &quot;retro&quot; style for younger women, modeled after American bags used to carry bowling balls; sturdy design with arched top and sides and a zipper closure with two carrying handles, may or may not have feet, usually no strap, no drawstring, no top flap
* Barrel bag: a cylindrical shape akin to a barrel, larger than a baguette bag, with two short handles, has no flap, and usually does not have shoulder straps.
* Bucket bag: a cylindrical bag, shaped like a bucket, medium-size or large, with one or two large handles, often shoulder strap(s), and a drawstring closure
* Clutch: a small firm handbag with a top flap and without handles, often rectangular in shape (soft versions sometimes are shaped like sections of an orange), often an evening bag but used during the day as well; some will feature a strap that can be worn over the shoulder but many will not
* Crossbody bag: a bag worn across the body from shoulder to hip; this is as opposed to a smaller hand carried bag such as a clutch as well as opposed to a larger bag such as a tote or bowling bag; a baguette, for example, may be worn crossbody, as can a half-moon or a messenger bag, but a tote cannot be worn this way nor can a hobo (some bucket bags are worn crossbody)
* Doctor&#x27;s bag: also known as a Gladstone bag, modeled after a Victorian-era doctor&#x27;s bag for making house calls, medium to large, has two sturdy handles but no straps and no top flap; resembles a bowling bag but may have a different closure, traditionally always in black leather
* Half-moon bag: shaped like a half-moon, usually smaller and feminine, worn hanging from the shoulder, may or may not have a handle
* Hobo bag: a soft-sided medium-sized crescent-shaped bag with a shoulder- or crossbody-length strap with no handle, no feet, and a top zipper closure with no top flap; a modern, casual silhouette
* Messenger bag: technically a variety of satchel (see below), square or rectangular (wider than tall) with one long strap worn across the body and large flap covering the top opening with no feet; inspired by bags worn by urban messengers to deliver business mail; meant to be carried against the lower back and usually made out of waterproof canvas rather than leather, with a secure front closure
* Minaudière: a variety of clutch, usually rigid-bodied with a hinge at the bottom, sometimes with a soft fabric lining, with no handles, straps, or feet, often encrusted with jewels and worn as evening wear
* Reticule: also known as a &quot;ridicule&quot; or &quot;indispensable&quot;, is an obscure type of small drawstring handbag or purse, similar to a modern evening bag, used mainly from 1795 to 1820
* Saddlebag: a small to medium size bag shaped like an equestrian saddle bag, always with a top flap and curved sides and bottom along with a shoulder strap but no top handle(s), no drawstring, and no feet
* Satchel: a larger soft-sided case usually of leather, often with a pair of top handles and a shoulder strap, usually has a front flap, similar to a doctor&#x27;s bag or tote in shape but smaller, worn across the body and resting on the opposite hip; a satchel made of canvas is usually considered a messenger bag
* Shoulder bag: a bag worn hanging off the shoulder, as opposed to a crossbody bag or a handheld bag; has a shorter strap than a crossbody, but otherwise is not usually distinguished; both shoulder bags and crossbody bags are larger than most clutches or wristlets, but smaller than totes or bucket bags; they may have a top flap, a handle, and feet, or none of these; a hobo bag is a variety of shoulder bag, but because of its distinct shape, it is usually referred to as a hobo specifically
* Top handle bag: a medium-sized bag with one or two top handles, may or may not have a flap, often rectangular with four feet, may also have a strap; many satchels are also top-handle bags, and some of these may be worn as crossbody bags or as shoulder bags if they also have a strap
* Tote: a medium to large bag with two longer straps and an open top (no flap, no zipper closure), similar to a bucket bag but usually less cylindrical and more square, with no feet; the Hermes Birkin bag is a tote
* Wristlet: a small rectangular handbag with a short carrying strap resembling a bracelet that can be worn around the wrist. Similar to a clutch in design, but with the added wrist strap

== Hardware ==
A distinction can also be made between soft-body handbags or frame handbags, where a metal frame supports the textile or leather of the bag. Frame bags often use a kissing lock closure, with two interlocking metal beads set on the top of the frame. Kissing locks were popular on handbags during the early- to mid-20th century, and remain popular with vintage collectors and in &quot;retro&quot; designs. These locks are still seen on smaller coin purses.

== Coinage as a verb ==
The verb &quot;to handbag&quot; and its humorous usage was inspired in the 1980s by UK prime minister Margaret Thatcher having &quot;weaponized&quot; the handbag in the opinion of British biographer and historian David Cannadine. As &quot;her most visible symbol of her power to command&quot; the bag became an emphatic prop that she produced at meetings to show she meant business. She would invariably bring out of the bag a crucial document from which she would quote, her speech notes often being cut to size to fit inside. Because Thatcher was Britain&#x27;s first female prime minister, former Daily Telegraph editor Charles Moore wrote in his authorised biography of 2013, &quot;her handbag became the sceptre of her rule&quot;.

The verb&#x27;s more general meaning of &quot;treating ruthlessly&quot; came to symbolize Thatcher&#x27;s whole style of government. Victims of her handbaggings, from political leaders to journalists, have testified to what the German chancellor Helmut Kohl perceived as her &quot;ice-cold pursuit of her interests&quot;. US secretary of state James Baker recalled her standby ploy: &quot;When negotiations stall, get out the handbag! The solution is always there.&quot;

Julian Critchley, one of her biggest Tory backbench critics, once said, &quot;Margaret Thatcher and her handbag is the same as Winston Churchill and his cigar.&quot; Thatcher&#x27;s bag was almost as newsworthy an item as she was herself and on the day she died, one of her handbag-makers saw a sharp rise in sales of her favorite structured design. The original bag Thatcher asserts on a signed card was the one &quot;used every day in my time at Downing Street&quot; is archived at Churchill College, Cambridge. Made of dark blue leather &quot;in mock-croc style&quot;, it was a gift from friends on her birthday in 1984.

== Handbag collecting ==
Handbag collecting has become increasingly popular in the 2000s.

In 2014, the auction house Christie&#x27;s started a handbag department, which now has several staff, headed by an &quot;international head of handbags&quot;. In June 2017, Christie&#x27;s had its first sale devoted exclusively to handbags.

According to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, the most sought-after and valuable brand is Hermès, followed by others including Céline, Chanel and Louis Vuitton.

=== World records ===
In June 2015, a Christie&#x27;s handbag sale in Hong Kong saw a pink crocodile skin Hermès Birkin bag made only in 2014, sell for a then world record £146,000.

In May 2017, Christie&#x27;s Hong Kong sold a white crocodile skin Hermès Birkin bag with 10.23 carats of diamonds for a world record HK$2.9 million (£293,000).

=== Museums ===
The Museum of Bags and Purses is in Amsterdam, the Netherlands; the Simone Handbag Museum is in Seoul, South Korea; and the ESSE Purse Museum is in Little Rock, Arkansas.

=== Notable collectors ===
Queen Elizabeth II owned over 200 Launer London bags, and kept all of her mother&#x27;s Launer bags.

Other notable collectors include Victoria Beckham, who has over 100 Birkin bags, Katie Holmes, Rita Ora and Kelly Brook. Cara Delevingne, Miranda Kerr, Lauren Conrad, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Beyoncé, Mary-Kate Olsen, Ashley Olsen, Lady Gaga, Olivia Palermo, and Rihanna are also collectors. Others include Kim Chiu, KC Concepcion, Kris Aquino, Heart Evangelista, Marian Rivera, Bea Alonzo, Kathryn Bernardo, Lovi Poe, Megan Young, Gretchen Barretto, Camille Prats, Sarah Lahbati, and Jeffree Star.

<text>Lars Leksell (24 November 1907 – 12 January 1986) was a Swedish physician and professor of Neurosurgery at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden. He was the inventor of radiosurgery.

==Life and career==
Lars Leksell was born in Fässberg Parish, Sweden on 24 November 1907. He completed medical studies at the Karolinska Institute and began his neurosurgical training in 1935 under Herbert Olivecrona. Development of electronystagmography and his thesis on muscular control and gamma motor neurons were his early scientific achievements.
In 1949, he developed his arc centered stereotactic frame based on A polar coordinate system. In 1951, using the Uppsala University cyclotron, Leksell and the physicist and radiobiologist Borje Larsson, developed the concept of radiosurgery. Leksell and Larsson first employed proton beams coming from several directions into a small area into the brain, in experiments in animals and in the first treatments of human patients. Thus, he achieved a new non-invasive method of destroying discrete anatomical regions within the brain while minimizing the effect on the surrounding tissues. He became a professor of surgery at University of Lund in 1958. From 1960 until his retirement, in 1974, he was Professor &amp; Chairman of neurosurgery at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, succeeding Herbert Olivecrona, who was the department&#x27;s founder in 1920.

During this time Leksell pursued his work on stereotactic radiosurgery and refinement of stereotactic methods. The first prototype of the gamma knife was installed in Sophiahemmet in 1968. Over the rest of his career, Leksell treated 762 patients with it. Throughout this time he would propose improving radiosurgery with modern imaging modalities including CT, MRI and angiography, as is currently used. Today, Leksell&#x27;s technique is used as an effective treatment for many conditions such as arteriovenous malformations, pituitary tumors, acoustic neuromas, craniopharyngiomas, meningioma, metastatic and skull base tumors, and primary brain tumors. The device is manufactured by Elekta Instruments, Inc., a Swedish company which manufactures stereotactic surgery and radiosurgery equipment, based on the inventions of Leksell. It was founded by him in 1972. He died peacefully at age of 78 in 1986 while taking a brisk walk in Swiss alps.

==First years and the &quot;stereotactic frame&quot;==
Leksell started his neurosurgical training with Herbert Olivecrona in 1935 at the Serafimer Hospital, one of the oldest hospitals in Sweden founded in 1752. The Olivecrona neurosurgical service enjoyed a solid international reputation and attracted a large number of trainees from all over the world. For a short period Leksell served as a volunteer medical doctor in Finland when it was attacked by the Soviet Union in November 1939. Later he told that during that war, he often speculated on the possibility of extracting bullets from the brain with minimal damage to the surrounding brain tissue using a mechanically guided instrument.

In the early 1940s Leksell joined Ragnar Granit, Nobel Laureate 1967, for experimental studies in neurophysiology. In 1945 he presented a PhD dissertation, a monograph on the motor gamma system titled ‘‘The action potential and excitatory effects of the small ventral root fibers to skeletal muscle.’’ This was a major milestone in the understanding of muscle control and has now become part of basic neurophysiology. During these years he, together with Granit and Skoglund, made another major contribution by describing the phenomenon of ephapsis, ‘‘artificial synapses,’’ caused by local pressure on a nerve, as a possible mechanism involved in trigeminal neuralgia.

After resuming clinical work, he started work on the development of a stereotactic instrument. The stereotactic method is the product of Robert Clarke, an engineer, physiologist and surgeon, who, together with neurosurgeon Victor Horsley, devised an instrument for simulating and making lesions at exact locations within the brains of experimental animals: the Horsley–Clarke apparatus. Clarke came up with the concept in 1895, and the original device was constructed in 1905 and first used in 1906.

The first successful cranial application of stereotactic surgery in humans is credited to the team of Ernest Spiegel and Henry Wycis in the Department of Experimental Neurology at Temple University in Philadelphia (Spiegel et al. 1947). Their original frame, using a Cartesian coordinate systems and similar in design and operation to the Clarke-Horsley device, was fixed to a patient&#x27;s head by means of a plaster cast. The frame and cast were removable, allowing separate imaging and surgery sessions. Contrast radiography, ventriculography and later pneumoencephalography permitted the visualization of intracranial reference points from which the location of target structures of interest could be determined.
Initial applications were for psychosurgery.

In 1947 Leksell visited Wycis in Philadelphia and then developed and described his instrument in a publication in 1949. This was the first example of a stereotactic system based on the principle of ‘‘center-of-arc’’. In contrast to the Cartesian coordinate system of the Spiegel-Wycis device, Leksell&#x27;s frame utilized three polar coordinates (angle, depth and anterior–posterior location). This ‘‘arc-quadrant’’ device provided maximum flexibility in choosing probe entry point and trajectory, and was therefore much easier to use. The frame has been modified over the ensuing years, but remains remarkably similar in function and appearance to the original 1949 device. The use of a movable semi-arc with an electrode carrier implies that the tip of a probe can reach the target regardless of the position of the carrier or the angling of the arc relative to the skull fixation device, a frame or base plate with bars for bone fixation screws. This construction permits also transphenoidal, straight lateral and suboccipital probe approaches.
Leksell was in many respects a perfectionist and for the rest of his life he continued to change and revise the design of virtually every small part of his instrument though the basic semicircular frame was retained. He focused not only on upgrading the function of the instrument but also on its aesthetic appearance. An important feature was that ‘‘the apparatus should be easy to handle and practical in routine clinical work’’ and ‘‘a high degree of exactitude is necessary.’’ An oft-cited quotation is ‘‘Tools used by the surgeon must be adapted to the task and where the human brain is concerned, no tool can be too refined.’’

The first, documented clinical application of Leksell&#x27;s stereotactic system was a case of a craniopharyngioma cyst that was punctured and treated with injection of radioactive phosphorus. that patient was probably the first patient in the world to undergo this form of therapy (1948). Before the advent of modern imaging techniques (CT, MRI), ventriculography was, and in some centers still is, routinely utilized for target coordinate determination. Already in the late 1940s neuroradiology was a well-developed speciality at the Serafimer Hospital and angiography and pneumoencephalography were routinely practiced. Leksell performed pneumoencephalography, first in the sitting and then in the supine position to visualize the anterior and posterior commissures, respectively. In order to compensate for the divergence of the X-rays, he constructed a diagram of tightly packed concentric circles, approximated to spirals, geometrically related to the divergence and the distance between the X-ray tube and the film, and frame planes, for determining the target coordinates; it has to be admitted, however, that in contrast to Leksell&#x27;s other inventions many surgeons found it difficult to understand and use this diagram.

Beside the passionate interest in the technical aspects of stereotaxy, Leksell was in the 1950s and 1960s very active in the operation theatre. He performed a large number of pallidotomies, and later also thalamotomies, in Parkinson&#x27;s disease and capsulotomies in various forms of mental disorders. The results of a series of 81 patients subjected to pallidotomy was published in 1960, and 116 patients treated with capsulotomy were reported in 1961.

==Radiosurgery==
The term and concept of radiosurgery were introduced by Leksell already in 1951 when he reasoned that the ‘‘center-of-arc’’ principle and his first stereotactic instrument were suitable for replacing a probe (needle electrode) by cross-firing intracerebral structures with narrow beams of radiant energy. X-rays were first tried but both gamma rays and ultrasonics were included as alternatives.

Initial experiments were performed on cats and then a few patients with pain and chronic psychosis were treated with a 280 kV X-ray tube attached to the arc. Of particular interest is that in 1953 two cases of trigeminal neuralgia were treated and at follow up in 1971 they were still free of pain.

In 1946 Leksell was appointed head of a neurosurgical unit in Lund in southern Sweden where he became professor in 1958 and remained so until 1960. In those days there were very few neurosurgeons around the world who were active in stereotactic surgery and the international network was very small; it is of interest that the Schalten brand and Bailey&#x27;s Stereotactic Atlas was partly based on some brain specimens supplied by Leksell. While in Lund, Leksell was apparently able to evade many of his clinical obligations because he was able to initiate a close collaboration with a team of physicists led by Börje Larsson at the University of Uppsala (north of Stockholm) where a synchrocyclotron was available.

They conducted experiments with stereotactic high-energy proton irradiation in goats resulting in a seminal publication in &quot;Nature&quot; in 1958. This technique was also applied in a few patients with Parkinson&#x27;s disease (pallidotomy), psychiatric disorder (capsulotomy) and pain (mesencephalotomy). Although precisely placed and well-limited lesions could be produced by the focused proton beams, as demonstrated in a few autopsy cases, the synchrocyclotron proved to be too complicated for general clinical use. This compelled Leksell to consider other radiation sources and he started designing the cobalt-60 gamma unit, which was fully integrated with the stereotactic system. The development of the ‘‘beam-knife’’ took place after Leksell had been appointed successor to Olivecrona in 1960 and the first unit was inaugurated in 1967. Later the same year reports of the two first cases, patients with cancer related pain subjected to radiosurgical thalamotomy, were published. Originally, radiosurgery and the gamma unit were developed with the hope that it would offer a bloodless, and less risky, method to be applied principally in functional neurosurgery, for example in thalamotomy for Parkinson&#x27;s disease. On the other hand, Leksell had always considered his stereotactic instrument a surgical tool that should also be utilized in general neurosurgery in order to enhance precision and minimize hazards. This idea had to some extent been realized by the extensive use of stereotactic technique in puncturing cysts and also in performing biopsies in critical regions. The gamma unit soon proved to be useful in the treatment of some diseases previously requiring neurosurgery, such as pituitary adenomas, acoustic neurinomas and arteriovenous malformations. This use of radiosurgery has revolutionized the management of these conditions but was met with skepticism from the neurosurgical community.

Two other examples of Leksell&#x27;s innovation deserve to be mentioned. He was the first to apply ultrasound in neurosurgical diagnosis by the development of echoencephalography as early as 1955. Moreover, his double action rongeur has become an indispensable tool in the hands of most neurosurgeons.

<text>In mathematics, particularly linear algebra, a zero matrix or null matrix is a matrix all of whose entries are zero. It also serves as the additive identity of the additive group of formula_1 matrices, and is denoted by the symbol formula_2 or formula_3 followed by subscripts corresponding to the dimension of the matrix as the context sees fit. Some examples of zero matrices are

:formula_4

==Properties==

The set of formula_1 matrices with entries in a ring K forms a ring formula_6. The zero matrix formula_7 in formula_8 is the matrix with all entries equal to formula_9, where formula_10 is the additive identity in K. 

:formula_11

The zero matrix is the additive identity in formula_8. That is, for all formula_13 it satisfies the equation

:formula_14

There is exactly one zero matrix of any given dimension &quot;m&quot;×&quot;n&quot; (with entries from a given ring), so when the context is clear, one often refers to &quot;the&quot; zero matrix. In general, the zero element of a ring is unique, and is typically denoted by 0 without any subscript indicating the parent ring. Hence the examples above represent zero matrices over any ring.

The zero matrix also represents the linear transformation which sends all the vectors to the zero vector. It is idempotent, meaning that when it is multiplied by itself, the result is itself.

The zero matrix is the only matrix whose rank is 0.

==Occurrences==

In ordinary least squares regression, if there is a perfect fit to the data, the annihilator matrix is the zero matrix.

*Matrix of ones, a matrix where all elements are one

<text>College Garden is a private garden of Westminster Abbey in London, open to the public Monday through Friday from 10:00am to 4:00pm throughout the year. The garden can be visited separately from the abbey and no charge is made to visit the garden alone. While visiting College Garden, it is also possible to visit the Little Cloister Garden, a small garden with a fountain in the cloisters, and St Catherine&#x27;s Garden which is in the ruins of the old monastic infirmary.
A thousand years ago, this was the infirmary garden of the monastery, then on Thorney Island, and it is claimed to be the oldest garden in England under continuous cultivation. While the main function of the College Garden is no longer to feed hungry monks, the area still retains an atmosphere of calm, despite being situated in such a busy area. Remembering the Herbarium that the monks created here, a new herb garden was created in 2010.

Its current name refers to the Collegiate Church of St. Peter, Westminster Abbey, rather than to its component Westminster School of which Lord Burlington&#x27;s College Dormitory building forms the west side. The north side is formed by the great hall of Westminster School (originally the monks&#x27; dormitory), and the houses of the abbey canons; the east and south sides are a medieval wall with a watergate which formerly opened into the River Thames, now embanked 50 metres away beyond the House of Lords.

Just outside the watergate, College Green is often seen in television interviews with politicians.

<doc id="1168894" wikidata="Q202831" url="?curid=1168894" title="Zihuatanejo">
<text>Zihuatanejo (), and/or Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo, is the fourth largest city in the Mexican state of Guerrero. It was known by 18th-century English mariners as Chequetan and/or Seguataneo. Politically the city belongs to the municipality of Zihuatanejo de Azueta in the western part of Guerrero, but both are commonly referred to as Zihuatanejo. It is on the Pacific Coast, about northwest of Acapulco. Zihuatanejo belongs to a section of the Mexican Pacific Coast known as the Costa Grande. This town has been developed as a tourist attraction along with the modern tourist resort of Ixtapa, away. However, Zihuatanejo has kept its traditional town feel. The town is located on a well-protected bay which is popular with private boat owners during the winter months.

The name Zihuatanejo has two possible origins. One origin might be from the Purépecha language meaning &quot;water of the yellow mountain&quot;; another possible origin might be from Nahuatl (Cihuacan) meaning &quot;place of women.&quot; Cihuacan, or &quot;place of women&quot;, refers to the western paradise of the Nahuatl universe, the home of the &quot;goddess women&quot;. According to tradition, these women arose in the afternoon to lead the sun at dusk to the realm of the dead, Mictlan, to give a dim light to the dead. &quot;De Azueta&quot; is in honor of José Azueta, who died fighting a U.S. incursion into the country in Veracruz in 1914.

Zihuatanejo spent most of its history until recently as a fishing village. The federal government&#x27;s decision to develop the nearby resort in the 1970s has had major implications for both the city and municipality of Zihuatanejo. The area is now the third most-visited area in Mexico, after Cancún and Puerto Vallarta, and the most popular for sports fishermen. Zihuatanejo&#x27;s population jumped from 6,887 to 37,328 by the early 1990s. Recently, a new highway called the Autopista Siglo XXI was built to connect Zihuatanejo with Morelia, cutting the travel time from Mexico City to about six hours.

Zihuatanejo was notably mentioned in the 1994 film &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;, in which the protagonist Andy Dufresne (played by Tim Robbins) escapes from prison to Zihuatanejo, followed by his friend and fellow prisoner, Ellis Boyd &quot;Red&quot; Redding (played by Morgan Freeman) who later joins him. The actual filming location for the film&#x27;s closing reunion scene was the Sandy Point National Wildlife Refuge on the island of Saint Croix in the US Virgin Islands.

==History==
===Pre-colonial===
The first human inhabitants of the region were nomadic tribes with a hunting and gathering culture. By the 15th century, the area was inhabited by groups called the &quot;Chumbia&quot;, the &quot;Panteca&quot;, and the Coixcas. These groups mined salt in what is now Ixtapa. The two main settlements in the area were Xihuacan, which is near the modern Zihuatanejo, and Petatlán. These two settlements along with much of the surrounding area was part of a pre-Hispanic dominion called Cuitlatepan. It extended from the Atoyac River along the coast and inland to the borders of what are now the states of Michoacán and Mexico State. Little remains of these two settlements, mostly because they were abandoned by most of the local inhabitants after being conquered by the Aztecs.

The area had always been sparsely populated before the colonial era. There are some myths and legends related to the place. There is a story that states that Zihuatanejo was a sanctuary dedicated to the goddess Cihuatéotl, who was of Olmec origin. She was considered to be the mother of the human race and the goddess of women who died in childbirth and of warriors who died in battle. In modern Zihuatanejo, there is an area called &quot;La Madera&quot; to the east of the port that may have been a shrine or sanctuary due to the significant number of pre-Hispanic clay figures that have been found. It is thought that this was dedicated to her. The area also appears to have been a sanctuary for the burial of important persons. In pre-Hispanic times, Purépecha kings used this area as a recreational area.

Just south of the Zihuatanejo Airport there is a large archeological site at &quot;La Soledad De Maciel&quot; and the small town of &quot;La Chole&quot;. While artifacts have been found there since the 1930s, excavations were only started between 2000 and 2010. The site was occupied from 3000 BCE to the early 600s CE when it was destroyed by a tsunami. It was occupied by three different cultures and was an important trading city for both Teotihuacan and the Olmec. At its height, it had a large population with the site possibly covering a area. Only a small part of the site has been excavated because most of it is owned by the local farmers who grow fruit trees, vegetables, coconuts for copra, and tobacco that they roll into cigars. The Mexican government is in the process of buying back the site, but it will be a slow process.

&quot;Cuitlatepan&quot; was conquered by the Aztecs under Ahuizotl in 1497. It was renamed Xihuacan and turned into a tributary province.

===Colonial era===
The Spanish arrived in the 1520s. The first Spaniard to arrive here is said to have been Gonzalo de Umbria, sent by Hernán Cortés to explore the area to see if there was any gold. The conquest caused the native peoples to mostly abandon the area, and it is not known where they went. Those left to provide tribute were known in the Mexican highlands for their cotton shawls and decorated conch shells. The oldest document with Zihuatanejo&#x27;s name is called the Matricula de Tributos (Record of Tribute). Today the local indigenous language has been lost and the only trace of the native population is a small archaeological site that was explored by INAH in the 1990s.

The Spanish used the bay as a point of departure to explore the Pacific coast as well as a port for the first ships to sail to the Philippines, the &quot;Florida&quot;, the &quot;Espiritu Santo&quot; and the &quot;Santiago&quot;. These ships were ordered built by Hernán Cortés and offered to the Spanish king Carlos V. According to the chronicles written by Bernal Díaz del Castillo, the ships were constructed here using Spanish carpenters and local wood. They left Zihuatanejo Bay on 31 October 1527 with Captain Alvaro de Saavedra y Cerón. Only the &quot;Florida&quot; made it to the Asian islands, and neither the captain nor crew ever returned to Mexico.

The Ixtapa area was given to Anton Sanchez as an &quot;encomienda&quot;, with nearby &quot;Pochutla&quot; and &quot;Tamaloca&quot; as part of this arrangement. With the disappearance of the native population, fields and forests were worked by Spaniards, leaving little in the way of the colonial system which was prevalent in other parts of Mexico. The Spanish raised chocolate, cotton, vanilla, and corn here; however, the main export was tropical woods such as cedar, oak, walnut, and others. Much of this was exported to Europe. Some gold was found here, mostly in an area in the &quot;Sierra Madre del Sur&quot; mountains in an area called &quot;Real de Guadalupe&quot; and areas north of the current municipality. During the colonial period, the Spanish galleons of Manila brought coconut trees to the area, which still flourish. They were the basis of the economy of the coast for some time. Few, if any, vestiges of the haciendas of the area remain, mostly because lasting constructions such as stone mansions or aqueducts were never built, as they were in other parts of Mexico. These haciendas were generally owned by foreigners, such as the Inguarán company of France or by creoles.
The town now known as Zihuatanejo was a fishing village, surrounded by large haciendas. Between 1680 and 1740 there are indications that the port was used for contraband trade; that is, for trade of arriving Asian products between New Spain and Peru, an interregional trade which had been forbidden. In the second half of the 16th century, the original Spanish shipyards at Zacatula burned. Unable to reconstruct them, new ones were built at Zihuatanejo. The surrounding haciendas occasionally used the bay as a port to ship wood and minerals. The bay was visited during the colonial period by many pirates.

===Independence and post-colonial era===
The municipality was spared involvement in the Mexican War of Independence, except for its use by José María Morelos y Pavón as a logistic port in 1811. Morelos created the province of Tecpan, which included Zihuatanejo.

However, the municipality did suffer consequences during the Mexican Revolution. Generally, it was sympathetic to the rebel cause and many joined, such as brothers &quot;Alfredo, Leonel, Hector&quot;, and &quot;Homero Lopez&quot;. Because of its sympathies, various bands associated with the different forces fighting against the Porfirio Diaz government (and each other) came through here, as well as federal forces. These led to a certain amount of sacking, pillaging, and vandalism.

In 1823, with the first republic, Zihuatanejo was separated from Tecpan and became part of the district of Acapulco. When the state of Guerrero was created, Zihuatanejo was part of the municipality of La Unión and Petatlán.

===20th century===
In 1926, a group called the &quot;vidalistas&quot; attacked the town which led to a secret agreement with the government to free a number of the compatriots.

In 1952, there was a strike by workers on coconut plantations from Acapulco to Zihuatanejo. Strikers blocked the highways of the town. In 1953, the town gained municipality status. In the 1970s, the area changed radically when the federal government decided to develop the Zihuatanejo-Ixtapa area into a tourist attraction. This caused the population to increase dramatically, especially in the 1980s and today the main economic base is tourism.

Tourism in Zihuatanejo was negatively impacted by some events in the 2000s. In May 2008, bull sharks gathered in large numbers along the coast for unknown reasons; two surfers were killed and a third was injured. The attacks occurred during a three-week period causing a &quot;&quot;Jaws&quot;-like mania&quot; and the construction of lifeguard towers and the establishment of a shark patrol for the beaches of Zihuatanejo and north. It was a rare phenomenon that subsided after the sharks dispersed.

On 20 February 2009, a group of men in a pickup truck threw explosive devices at the installations of the Secretariat of Public Security of the municipality of Zihuatanejo, resulting in five persons injured. The attack occurred at 7:45 pm near the municipal docks. At the time of the attack, the 56th Infantry Battalion had been stationed in Zihuatanejo, mostly to interdict the traffic in arms, drugs and stolen vehicles. The grenade attack on the security headquarters was followed by a highway ambush that killed four policemen. Kidnapping of Mexican citizens has been a problem here as well. In one instance four kidnapping victims were rescued by elements of the Mexican military and police, killing one suspect in the process.

==Town and its bay==

===Town center===

The fishing town and resort of Zihuatanejo spreads out around the Bay of Zihuatanejo and inland toward the Sierra Madre del Sur mountains. The town is the seat of government for the municipality and the principal community in the region. Since the 1970s, it has been developed in conjunction with nearby Ixtapa, but conserving its traditional Mexican feel. The downtown is called &quot;El Centro&quot; and is located on the north end of the bay. The centro still has its narrow streets paved with stones or bricks. The town also has a long-standing community of Swiss and Italian immigrants.

The heart of Zihuatanejo is the waterfront walkway Paseo del Pescador (Fisherman&#x27;s Path), also called the malecón. This tree-lined pedestrian walkway goes along the municipal beach between the archeological museum and the fishing pier. It is lined with restaurants offering seafood and many other dishes, as well as a variety of stores selling rugs, arts and crafts and souvenirs, and a small shell market. In the evening, this area fills with people socializing.

Instead of a traditional plaza, the center is a basketball court which is in front of the beach and serves as a point of reference. It is surrounded by benches and shade trees. Next to this are the gazebo and the Casa de la Cultura. These venues host music, concerts, cultural presentations, art shows. The main thoroughfare for cars is Juan Alvarez, a block behind the malecón. Sections of several of the main streets are designated pedestrian zones. The main church of the town, the Parish of &quot;Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe&quot;, is located nearby.

Zihuatanejo&#x27;s oldest building was part of the Ingrana family hacienda, which was a coconut plantation. Today, the building houses &quot;Restaurant Coconuts&quot;, but was the storage facility for the plantation when it was built about 150 years ago. The plantation remained in the family until the Mexican Revolution, when this particular building was confiscated and turned into a field hospital and the rest of the plantation was divided into smaller units. The current restaurant opened in 1979 after restoring this building. Much of the timber in the bar area is original. The gallery of Restaurant Coconuts has a collection of Works done by Guerrero native Nicolás de Jesús.

The &quot;Mercado de Artesanías&quot; (Crafts Market) has 250 shops, which sell a wide variety of crafts. These include those local work done with seashells, coral and snail shells. The market also has silver from Taxco and lacquered objects from Olinalá, Guerrero, and ceramics and bark paper paintings from the central valleys region of Oaxaca.
The town center has its own beach, called the &quot;municipal beach&quot;, but it is not recommended for swimming. Due to its proximity to the port, there is constant maritime traffic in this part of the bay.

The town hosts an annual festival called the Annual Zihua Sail Fest, which raises funds for the education of disadvantaged children in Zihuatanejo. The five-day event takes place in February with more than 100 boats, some from as far away as Alaska coming into the bay. Events include cocktail parties, concerts, auctions and sailboat races, chili cook offs and street fairs. In 2009, the event raised $640,000 pesos, along with a matching grant and a donation of US$20,000 by the Rotary International.

Another festival is the Zihuatanejo International Guitar Festival which is held in March; it is a week-long event held at multiple locations every night, with a children&#x27;s show as well as a free public show at the main plaza. The Zihua Guitar Fest brings guitarists from all over the world such as Canadian artist Adrian Raso, Los Angeles’ artist Omar Torrez, South Africa&#x27;s Margaret&#x27;s Daughter, Nashville&#x27;s Eric McFadden and Texas-based Los Pistoleros to name a few. This festival prides itself in drawing tourism to the area which helps support the many small family-owned businesses. This festival began in 2004 and has been a big hit for locals as well as tourists.

===Port===

The port is mainly used by fishermen who arrive to the docks every morning with their catch, &quot;pangas&quot; and other boats that ferry passengers to places like Las Gatas beach, and fishing charters. There is also a cruise ship greet and rest area for passenger who visit the town. Sport fishing is a major draw to this part of Zihuatanejo. In February 2001, &quot;Sport Fishing Magazine&quot; rated the Zihuatanejo area second worldwide for sailfishing, based on the number of strikes per day and other factors. Yearly, on the first weekend of May, Zihuatanejo hosts the International Sailfish Tournament. The event brings hundreds of fishermen and boats into town in the hopes of winning one of the many prizes offered for largest sailfish, marlin and dorado.

Fish that can be caught here include roosterfish, jacks, snook, grouper and small tuna close to shore between Wamaluli Point and Morro de Pampanoa, but they are not the main attraction here. Most of the sport fishing occurs offshore, about five miles out. Billfish of one of the major attractions. Sport fishing operations exist here using boats such as super pangas and luxury cruisers. Sailfish and marlin can be had, caught, and released. The seas can be very choppy near the shore but calm farther out. Most visitors come for these two fish, which are available year-round. Blue and black marlin are available much of the year, with February and March being the best months. Several huge fish have been caught here such as the black marlin caught just a offshore. Other fish include skipjack tuna and yellowfin tuna.

==== Cruises ====

Cruises often stop at Zihuatanejo, the city having become a major cruise stop and a major attraction for its beaches. The city is also famous for its catamaran tours, most popular and known is Picante Cruises, operating in both Zihuatanejo and Ixtapa bay where snorkeling, spinnaker flying, and sunset cruises are offered.

===Archeological Museum of the Costa Grande===

The &quot;Museo Arqueológico de la Costa Grande&quot; (Archeological Museum of the Costa Grande) is located at the southern end of the municipal beach and the Paseo de los Pescadores. It has six rooms that document the history, archeology, and culture of this part of the Guerrero coast. Many of the artifacts are from as far away as the Olmec and Toltec civilizations, as both explored this area. Room one of the museum displays artifacts from settlements established on the coasts of Jalisco, Nayarit, Colima and Guerrero. Room two houses ceramics and carvings from the area of Cerro de la Madera, in Zihuatanejo, among others. Room three features the Tierras Prietas site, the cultivation of food plants and use of natural resources such as the bajareque technique of walls made of interwoven branches and clay. Room 4 covers aspects of village life and cultural exchange from 200 to 750 A.C.; the introduction of ball games and new pottery techniques. Room five contains pieces from the Aztec period from 1487 to the 1520s, when the province of Cihuatlan was established, and tribute was paid to the Aztecs by the local population in shells, chocolate, basketry and textiles. Room six covers the colonial period and search for a maritime route to the west during the 16th and 17th centuries. During this time the ports of Zihuatanejo and Acapulco were important points of reference for Spanish and other navigators.

===Bay and its beaches===

Zihuatanejo&#x27;s main attraction is its bay, which is well-protected from open ocean. It is a favorite place to moor boats from small private ones to large yachts during the winter months. The bay&#x27;s width varies from between in width and averages deep. It is mostly surrounded by beaches, most of which have gentle waves. On land the bay is surrounded by the foothills of the Sierra Madre mountains. Development of this area has caused some environmental problems. The town&#x27;s five water treatment plants can no longer keep up with demand, with some untreated wastewater and sediment flowing into the bay. There has also been some wholesale destruction of the hills right on the bay to create development space, and there is concern about damage to the local coral reef. Some development projects, such as a dock for cruise ships and Punta del Mar (a complex of hotels, villas, pools and a marina) have been delayed due to the need for environmental impact studies.

The ring of beaches of Zihuatanejo Bay begins with the Municipal Beach which is in front of the town center and next to the port. From there, there is a cement and sand walkway that leads to Playa Madera (Wood Beach). It is a stretch of light-colored sand between the municipal beach and Playa La Ropa. The waves here are gentle with the occasional wave. This beach contains a number of bay-view restaurants, bungalows, condominiums and hotels, as well as a walkway that extends the length of the beach. Part of the beach is covered in pebbles.
Moving away from the town center along the bay, the next beach is called Playa La Ropa (Clothes Beach). The name Playa La Ropa (Clothes Beach) refers to the sinking of a merchant ship near the bay during colonial times. Its cargo of fine silks, belts, cloaks and fabrics from Bombay washed up in this beach. This beach is about long and considered the best for swimming as there is little wave action. During the winter months, many sailboats moor here. Just behind the beach, the land rises suddenly into cliffs, which are dotted with hotels, large residences and guest houses.

A number of these hotels sponsor the local turtle conservation campaign, setting up fenced-off areas in which turtle eggs found along the beach are gathered and protected during incubation from August through December. After hatching, the baby turtles are kept in tubs and released periodically into the ocean at sunset. These hotels invite guests to help with the release.

The beach contains a very small fenced estuary which is home to several crocodiles. They have lived here for years and are well-fed by the local restaurants, although they are still wild creatures.

In a parking lot at the end of La Ropa Beach, one of the parking spaces has become a place of reverence for the Virgin of Guadalupe. According to local reports, an image of the virgin appeared on the bole of a plum tree on 27 November 2006. This is considered by many to be a miracle, especially as it occurred shortly before the Virgin&#x27;s feast day of 12 December. The tree has a base constructed around it with stairs allowing visitors to see the image more easily. There are places to deposit candles and offerings and flowers have been planted around the tree. On 12 December, a mass and candlelit vigil is held here.

Playa Las Gatas (Cats Beach) is on the opposite side of the bay from town, is accessible only by boat as there are no paved roads that lead to here and a small, poorly defined, rocky footpath leading from Playa La Ropa. Las Gatas was originally named for a small cat shark that used to inhabit these waters. It is located at the entrance to the bay at a place called Punta del Rey (King&#x27;s Point). This leaves the area open to ocean breezes. Wave action is stronger, but not as strong as those beaches that face the open ocean as there is a coral reef and a man-made stone barrier in front of it. According to legend, Purépecha chief Calzontzin had a stone barrier built here to keep the waves down and the sea creatures out, creating a kind of swimming pool. Las Gatas is the most popular snorkeling beach in Zihuatanejo. Gear can be rented at Carlo Scuba, along with PADI instruction and certification. Colorful tropical fish can be seen along the man-made breakwater, as well as the abundant coral and sea urchins. At the far end of the beach surfing is possible, and a path leads to the lighthouse on the point of the bay.

==Municipality==

The town of Zihuatanejo is the seat of the municipality of Zihuatanejo de Azueta and as such is the governmental authority for approximately 416 communities, with a total population of 104,609 as of 2005, and an area of . There are small indigenous communities in the municipality which speak Nahuatl and Tlapaneco. Population increase for the period of 1995-2000 was 1.85 percent, with a population density of just under fifty people per square km. The greatest population increase was seen in the 1980s when the municipality jumped from 25,751 to 63,366 residents.
The municipality borders the municipalities of Coyuca de Catalán, Coahuayutla de José María Izazaga, Petatlán and La Unión de Isidoro Montes de Oca, as well as the Pacific Ocean. Altitude varies from between above sea level. Much of the municipality (70%) is rugged terrain with the rest being semi-flat or flat. Major peaks here are the Sierra de la Cuchara and the Cumbre de la Peatada. Major rivers here include the Verde and the Ixtapa. There are also a number of small streams such as the Real, Pantla, Zapote, and Lagunillas.

The climate is warm and mostly moist, with an average temperature of . The rainy season is from June to September. Land wildlife mostly consists of small mammals, bats, and lizards. The bay contains fish such as red snapper, bass, other fish and sea turtles. Because of the climate&#x27;s temperature and humidity, the beaches of Zihuatanejo are apt for the incubation of various sea turtles eggs such as the leatherback, hawksbill and olive ridley. The annual program for the collection and protection of turtle eggs starts at the beginning of June and lasts until the end of December. 31 December is celebrated with a massive baby turtle release along the coasts north and south of Zihuatanejo bay. The program consists of twenty one incubation corrals, along of beaches. These corrals protect the thousands of turtle eggs collected during this time period by government staff and trained volunteers. After birth, they are kept here until they grow large enough to avoid most natural predators and increase their chances of survival.

The most important economic activity for the municipality is tourism, with the major attractions being the beaches. Most international visitors come between November and December and most Mexican tourists come in December, April, July and August. Seventy-one percent of the municipality&#x27;s population is engaged in the commercial and tourism sector of the economy. Outside of Zihuatanejo Bay, some of most important beaches include Quieta Beach, Majahua Beach and Playa Larga. Prior to the 1970s, economic activity was based on fishing and agriculture. At that time, the federal government decided to make a planned resort at Ixtapa, just north of the municipal seat of Zihuatanejo, constructed on what was once a coconut plantation and mangrove estuary. It is a complete tourist center with a hotel strip long, white sands, shopping centers, restaurants, nightclubs, golf courses, residences.

To the south of Zihuatanejo Bay, there are a number of beaches and a lagoon on the way to the regional airport. Playa Larga (Long Beach), Playa Blanca (White Beach) and Las Pozas (The Wells) are parts of the same long stretch of white sand that runs from north west of the airport, past the airport and down to Barra de Potosí. Total length of these beaches in about . Swimming is strongly discouraged off any of these beaches as they face open ocean and have heavy undertows riptides and current. Behind the beaches are coconut groves, small huts and mango trees. Cacti grow on the hillsides, sometimes down to the beach itself. Actitivies that are recommended for this area include whale watching from December to February and dolphin watching all year round, both of which can be done from the beach. There is horseback riding on the beaches and into the adjoining hills. The beach is dotted with open-air restaurants with roofs thatched with palm fronds, tree branches and flower. Volleyball net and soccer posts are set up in front of many of the restaurants as well.

On the southern end of these beaches is the village of Barra de Potosí. There is a lagoon here, called Laguna de Potosí and islets called Morros de Potosí. The lagoon area has a large mangrove estuary filled with bird wildlife. Birdwatching, kayaking and fishing are popular here. The lagoon opens to the ocean and the beaches contain many &quot;enramadas&quot;, palm-thatched outdoor restaurants. Many of these enramadas are decorated with colorful paper or plastic cutouts, especially during the Christmas season. The Morros de Potosí are offshore and is a popular place for snorkeling, with red-billed tropicbirds, brown boobies and brown pelicans nesting on the rocks. In the winter season the bay hosts humpback whales, mother/calf pairs and some males are seen leaping from the water. There is a whale study project, Whales of Mexico, that takes place in the winter as well.

Inland there are a couple of attractions. La Vainilla is an ecological park located from the town of Zihuatanejo on the hilly terrain of the foothills of the Sierra Madre del Sur mountains. It covers approximately , and contains 428 species of plants. These are distributed in three plant communities; bosque tropical subcaducifolio (semi-evergreen seasonal forest), bosque tropical caducifolio (deciduous seasonal forest) and bosque en galleria (gallery forest), with the first type most prevalent. There is also one small archeological site named Tierras Prietas.

Aside from tourism, fishing continues to be a way of life for a large number of families, bringing in seafood such as shark, clams, oysters, red snapper, bass and mugil. The increasing popularity of the area as a sportfishing destination has given new impetus to its livelihood, and traditional fishing is being supplemented with fish farms. The fish caught and produced mainly goes to local, regional and state markets. As in the past, much of the forest area here is still exploited for timber. Timber area covers of the municipality and woods obtained include pine, cedar, mahogany and oak. There is also some livestock-raising, mostly in the south of the municipality, and coffee-growing in the north. Crops are planted on only seven percent of the territory, but include corn, beans, sorghum and sesame seed.

==Food==
The local specialty is &quot;huachinango&quot; or whole red snapper, usually prepared &quot;Veracruzana&quot; (with savory tomato sauce) or &quot;al mojo de ajo&quot; (with garlic sauce).

<text>Gene Pollar (September 16, 1892 - October 20, 1971) was the screen name of New York City firefighter Joseph Pohler, who in his very brief movie career played Tarzan.

==Background==
At age 28, the 6&#x27;2&quot;, 215-pound Joseph Charles Pohler became the second actor to portray Tarzan in films. Elmo Lincoln, the first actor in the role, had made two Tarzan movies when Numa Pictures approached him about making a third. At the time, Lincoln was not interested (though he would later return to the role briefly). One of the Weiss Brothers, the low-budget filmmakers who controlled Numa, was on a visit to New York when he signed Pohler to play the apeman. Pohler was given the screen name Gene Pollar. The film was called &quot;The Return of Tarzan&quot;, based on Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27; novel &quot;The Return of Tarzan&quot;.

==Production==
Pollar was paid $100 per week. The production was sold to Goldwyn Distribution Corporation in April 1920. As a precautionary measure, since it featured a new star, the film was retitled &quot;The Revenge of Tarzan&quot; just two weeks prior to its opening on July 20, 1920. The film was a success, but Numa refused to release Pollar to accept a contract from Universal Pictures.

==Later life==
The disgruntled Pollar ended his acting career and returned to firefighting under his original name, Joseph C. Pohler. In 1944, he became a purchasing agent for a retail store chain, for which he worked until his retirement to West Hollywood, Florida.

Pollar emerged briefly from obscurity in 1966 at age 73. That year, a publicity event surrounding the premiere of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Tarzan&quot; series brought together several actors who had played the apeman, and the guest of honor was James H. Pierce, then 66, who was dubbed the &quot;oldest living Tarzan&quot;. Pollar contacted the media and declared correctly that he was the oldest. &quot;Pierce is just a kid compared to me&quot;, he joked. Pollar blamed the mix-up on a New York City paper&#x27;s erroneous report of his death a few years earlier.

Pollar died in 1971 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, at age 79.

<text>The Western &amp; Atlantic Railroad of the State of Georgia (W&amp;A) is a railroad owned by the State of Georgia and currently leased by CSX, which CSX operates in the Southeastern United States from Atlanta, Georgia, to Chattanooga, Tennessee.

It was founded on December 21, 1836. The city of Atlanta was founded as the terminus of the W&amp;A, with the terminus marked with the Atlanta Zero Mile Post. The line is still owned by the State of Georgia from Atlanta to CT Tower in Chattanooga; it is leased by CSX Transportation.

The W&amp;A Subdivision is a railroad line leased by CSX Transportation in the U.S. states of Tennessee and Georgia. The line runs from Chattanooga to Marietta, Georgia for a total of . At its north end, it continues south from the Chattanooga Subdivision of the Nashville Division and at its south end it continues south as the Atlanta Terminal Subdivision (Chart A).

This line, originally built to gauge, is famous because of the Great Locomotive Chase, also referred to as Andrews&#x27; raid, which took place on the W&amp;A during the American Civil War on the morning of April 12, 1862.

==Establishment==
In 1836, the Georgia General Assembly voted to build the Western &amp; Atlantic Railroad of the State of Georgia to provide a link between the port of Savannah and the Midwest. The initial route of that state-sponsored project was to run from Chattanooga to a spot east of the Chattahoochee River, in present-day Fulton County. The plan was to eventually link up with the Georgia Railroad from Augusta and the Macon and Western Railroad, which ran from Macon to Savannah. An engineer was chosen to recommend the location where the Western &amp; Atlantic line would terminate. Once he surveyed various possible routes, he drove a stake into the ground near what is now Forsyth and Magnolia Streets. The zero milepost was later placed at that spot. In 1842, the zero milepost was moved to a spot immediately adjacent to the current southern entrance to Underground Atlanta. The area developed into a settlement, known as &quot;Terminus&quot;, literally meaning &quot;end of the line&quot;. In 1843, the small settlement of Terminus was incorporated as the city of Marthasville. Two years later, by act of Georgia&#x27;s General Assembly, the city was renamed &quot;Atlanta&quot;. The railroad made significant contributions to the development of north Georgia.

==Funding source for public education==
In 1857, Joseph E. Brown was elected Governor of Georgia. He supported free public education for poor white children, believing that it was key to the development of the state. He asked the state legislature to divert a portion of the profits from the state-owned Western &amp; Atlantic, to help fund the schools. Most planters did not support public education and paid for private tutors and academies for their children. That resistance, and inadequate railroad income, initially thwarted governor Brown&#x27;s education reform efforts. The Western and Atlantic Railroad was mismanaged at the time, and unable to produce the income Brown required to fund his public education proposal. In 1858, Governor Brown appointed John W. Lewis to the position of Superintendent of the state-owned railroad. Lewis had the skills of a successful businessman, and immediately undertook reforms to turn around the failing enterprise. The railroad, said to be in &quot;dire financial straits&quot;, required the same strict economic controls Lewis had practiced in his private businesses. In the three years that Lewis ran the railroad, he was able to turn the business into a money making enterprise, paying $400,000 per year into the state treasury.

In 1861, Brown was up for re-election to a third term. It was at this time, during the re-election campaign, that Western &amp; Atlantic Railroad Superintendent John Woods Lewis, an old friend of the governor, decided to resign from the railroad. The timing could not have been worse. Fearing that Lewis&#x27; resignation would be interpreted negatively, the governor requested that Lewis keep the resignation a secret. But the resignation letter was leaked to the press, causing a rift between the two old friends. Brown wrote to Lewis saying &quot;I did not deserve this at your hands, and I confess I felt it keenly...I do not attribute improper motives, but only say the coincidence was an unfortunate one for me&quot;.

==Leasing==
Through 1870, it was called the State Road, and was operated directly by the state under a superintendent appointed by and reporting to the governor of Georgia. On December 27 of that year, operations were transferred to the Western &amp; Atlantic Railroad Company, a group of 23 investors including Georgia&#x27;s wartime governor Joseph E. Brown, who leased it (both tracks and rolling stock) from the state for $25,000 per month. This expired 20 years later, when the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis (NC&amp;StL) leased it for 29 years. The railroad that was handed over to the NC&amp;StL was in very poor condition. The locomotives that were transferred consisted only of those listed on the 1870 lease as property of the State, with all of the more modern engines purchased under Gov. Brown&#x27;s Western &amp; Atlantic Railroad Company having been sold to other railroads. While most of the passenger equipment was usable, almost all of the locomotives were condemnable and all of the freight cars were scrapped. The value of the locomotives was disputed for some 20 years. A major change in the new lease in 1890 stipulated that all improvements made to the road by the lessee would become property of the state at the termination of the lease. Included in the definition of improvements were modifications to the facilities, right of way and new equipment purchased for use over that line, including passenger cars, freight cars, and locomotives. As it turned out, the NC&amp;StL continued to hold the lease to the Western &amp; Atlantic Railroad until it was absorbed by its parent company, the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, which was itself owned by the Atlantic Coast Line-one of the principal railroads in the Family Lines System and later CSX Transportation, which continues to operate the line as the Western &amp; Atlantic Subdivision. CSXT signed the current lease on the W&amp;A from the State of Georgia in May 1986, set to expire on December 31, 2019. On Sept 7th, 2018, the owner and CSX announced they had reached an agreement to renew the lease for 50 more years, starting in 2020 at $1 million a month, and rising annually thereafter.

After being captured by the Union in mid-1864 and until the end of the war in 1865, the line was briefly operated by the United States Military Railroad.

==Distances of depots from Atlanta (1867 list and 2008 list)==
Trains departed from Atlanta at 8:50 a.m. and 7 p.m. and arrived there at 1:35 a.m. and 1:15 p.m. Not much has happened in between 1867 and now, track realignments in some areas resulted in height clearances and track improvements.

==Great Locomotive Chase==

On the morning of April 12, 1862, the locomotive &quot;General&quot; was stopped at Big Shanty, Georgia (now Kennesaw) so that the crew and passengers could have breakfast. During this time, James J. Andrews and his Union raiders (Andrews Raiders), stole the &quot;General&quot;. The only damage the raiders did involved cutting telegraph lines and raising rails, although an attempt to burn a covered bridge failed. The train&#x27;s conductor, William A. Fuller, chased the &quot;General&quot; by foot and handcar. At Emerson, Georgia, Fuller commandeered the &quot;Yonah&quot; and rode it north to Kingston, Georgia. At Kingston, conductor Fuller got the &quot;William R. Smith&quot; and headed north to Adairsville. The tracks were broken by the raiders south of Adairsville and Fuller had to run the two miles on foot.

At Adairsville, Fuller got the locomotive &quot;Texas&quot; and chased the &quot;General&quot;. While all of this was happening, Andrews&#x27; Raiders were cutting the telegraph wires so no transmissions could go through to Chattanooga. With the &quot;Texas&quot; chasing the &quot;General&quot; in reverse, the chase went through Dalton, Georgia, and Tunnel Hill, Georgia.

At milepost 116.3 (north of Ringgold, Georgia), Andrews&#x27; Raiders abandoned the &quot;General&quot; and scattered from the locomotive just a few miles from Chattanooga. After the chase, Andrews and most of his raiders were caught. After they were found guilty, Andrews and seven members of his party were executed by hanging. Of the remaining 14 raiders, several escaped and made it back to US Army lines and the remainder were exchanged as prisoners of war. These men were the first soldiers to be awarded the Medal of Honor.

=== After the chase ===
When the chase was over, both engines returned to service. After the &quot;General&quot;&#x27;s service with the W&amp;A was over, she retired to the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway Union Depot in Chattanooga. In 1890, the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway overhauled the General and provided the locomotive for public events and to promote the line&#x27;s Civil War history (to drum up the tourism trade) up through the 1930s. In 1962, 100 years after the chase, the L&amp;N performed work necessary to allow the locomotive to operate under her own power for a series of appearances marking the 100th anniversary of the Andrews Raid. The premier appearance was her run from Atlanta to Chattanooga over the Western &amp; Atlantic Railroad. After this run, the General would make excursion trips on various rail lines across the eastern US through most of the 1960s. In the late 60s, the General was to go to Kennesaw for another appearance when the City of Chattanooga officials halted it. The engine was put in storage in Louisville while a legal battle for its custody ensued. In 1971 the United States District Court confirmed the right of the railroad to dispose of the locomotive as it saw fit and it was moved to Kennesaw, Georgia (via a route bypassing Chattanooga) in 1972 where it was placed in the Big Shanty Museum. The &quot;Texas&quot; was renamed &quot;Cincinnati&quot; and was retired shortly after the turn of the century, and was stored on a siding. In 1911, it was moved to Grant Park and later placed in the Atlanta Cyclorama.

== Re-gauging ==

Prior to the Civil War, the rail gauge of most railroads in the South were broad gauge. In 1886, the change to the Northern standard gauge of was mandated on June 1, and the W&amp;A accomplished this along all in less than 24 hours, beginning at 1:30 p.m. on May 31 and finishing at 10 a.m. the next morning. This was done by over 400 men, prying up one rail and moving it closer to the other by exactly , leaving a compatible gauge of . The &quot;General&quot; and many other locomotives were also re-gauged at this time.

==W&amp;A in modern times==
Aside from a few track realignments by the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway, the W&amp;A has changed little since 1862. The most significant changes were realignment during the creation of Lake Allatoona, with the tracks through Allatoona Pass removed. The Etowah River bridge has also been replaced. The famed Chetoogeta Mountain Tunnel in Tunnel Hill, Georgia, was abandoned in 1928; it was too small to accommodate the larger trains of the era, and a new tunnel was built nearby.

A marker indicating where the chase began is near the Big Shanty Museum in Kennesaw, Georgia. A marker for where the chase ended is at Milepost 116.3, north of Ringgold, Georgia, which is not far from the recently restored depot at Milepost 114.5. A monument dedicated to Andrew&#x27;s Raiders is located at the Chattanooga National Cemetery; it has the &quot;General&quot; on top of the monument and a brief history of the great locomotive chase.

<doc id="1168906" wikidata="Q7300666" url="?curid=1168906" title="Ready Set Learn!">
<text>Ready Set Learn! was an American television block broadcast from late 1992 until 2010 across the Discovery Communications-owned TLC and Discovery Kids networks. A cable competitor to PBS&#x27;s children&#x27;s offerings, it broadcast twice on weekday mornings and comprised three hours of original, imported, and rerun programming plus music videos geared towards preschoolers. In its early years, it was hosted by children&#x27;s entertainer Rory Zuckerman, who was billed mononymously; an early 2003 relaunch replaced her with Paz, a penguin who was represented in animated and puppet form.

A 1990 Carnegie Foundation report inspired Discovery to develop the block; shows were selected based on their educational value and visual vibrancy. Amid a $10 million investment from TLC, a line of home video and software releases, and plans to spin it off into a standalone channel, the parent company used &quot;Ready&quot; as a loss leader to expand the network&#x27;s carriage. A counterpart for older children debuted on the main Discovery Channel in early 1997. By mid-2002, the TLC block ended up under the management of Discovery Kids, whose schedule it also appeared on.

&quot;Ready Set Learn!&quot; ran on TLC from December 28, 1992 to September 26, 2008, with Discovery Kids following suit during the 2000s. Despite brief skepticism on its chances as an &quot;educational television&quot; outlet, it was positively reviewed during both its 1990s and 2000s incarnations. The block helped TLC receive a CableACE Creators Award in 1995, and was also honored by the National Education Association, the American Academy of Children&#x27;s Entertainment, and the Parents&#x27; Choice Foundation.

==History==

The TLC network&#x27;s foray into preschool television, &quot;Ready Set Learn!&quot; was first mentioned as early as August 1992. Of the first five shows announced for the block, three of them (&quot;Bookmice&quot;, &quot;Kitty Cats&quot;, and &quot;The Magic Box&quot;) would have their U.S. premieres there; the other two were rerun packages of &quot;Join In!&quot; (previously on the religious VISN network) and &quot;Zoobilee Zoo&quot; (a previously syndicated production of DIC Entertainment and Hallmark). Greg Moyer, Discovery Communications&#x27; senior vice-president of programming, expressed hope that a full-fledged channel would spin off from it within one or two years of launch.

According to TLC employee John Ford, the block was inspired by &quot;Ready to Learn: A Mandate for the Nation&quot;, a 1990 Carnegie Foundation report which stated that 35% of U.S. children began their education unprepared. Assisted by director of programming Mike Quattrone (who had previously undertaken similar endeavors at PBS), Ford selected the shows on the strengths of their educational value along with their visual vibrancy. Finding it &quot;extremely well-produced&quot;, he also bet on &quot;Kitty Cats&quot; as the block&#x27;s breakout series.

&quot;Ready Set Learn!&quot; debuted on December 28, 1992, with &quot;Professor Iris&quot; rounding out the six-show lineup. A competitor to the PBS lineup, its three-hour schedule aired twice on weekdays, first at 6:00 a.m. and again at 9:00 a.m. (in the Eastern Time Zone)—a slot that Ford viewed as &quot;a safe haven&quot;. TLC chose to air it commercial-free because doing otherwise would detract from its purpose. As such, Discovery used the format as a loss leader for expansion of the network&#x27;s carriage, which stood at 18 million homes at the time. According to the Associated Press, TLC invested $10 million in the block&#x27;s initial development (excluding tentative fees from underwriting, a supplement that never came to fruition); original programming was also planned.

In its early years, &quot;Ready Set Learn!&quot; was hosted by children&#x27;s entertainer Rory Zuckerman (billed simply as &quot;Rory&quot;). A resident of Bethesda, Maryland (where TLC&#x27;s parent company Discovery was based), Rory set out to teach children language skills through her music, as well as to &quot;welcome the children into the world of The Learning Channel and also the parents, care-givers and other viewers&quot; as hostess. The block would become the home of her own shows, &quot;Rory and Me&quot; and &quot;Rory&#x27;s Place&quot;, which were seen by one million combined viewers per month in 1996.

Interstitial material on the block was branded under the &quot;Short Stuff&quot; banner, and rounded out each half-hour. Around 1994, music videos began appearing during this feature, starting with clips from Joanie Bartels (an artist signed to Discovery&#x27;s former in-house record label). By 1996, TLC played 10–12 videos per day on &quot;Ready&quot;—showcasing children&#x27;s artists as varied as Fred Penner, Parachute Express, Joe Scruggs, and Sharon, Lois &amp; Bram—to the point where they would all but replace the older &quot;Short Stuff&quot; segments from 1992. The latter group would later headline the mainline &quot;Ready&quot; program &quot;Skinnamarink TV&quot;. Around 1992, the Discovery Channel began plans for a counterpart weekend block to &quot;Ready&quot;. After a four-year delay, it was launched on Sundays in early 1997 alongside the companion U.S. and Latin American Discovery Kids formats.

By mid-2002, the TLC block had come under the purview of the Discovery Kids team; a revamped lineup that tentatively included &quot;Animal Jam&quot;, &quot;The Save-Ums!&quot;, and &quot;Ni Ni&#x27;s Treehouse&quot; was slated to take effect early the following year. The resulting relaunch on February 24, 2003 introduced Paz the Penguin as the new host of the interstitial segments; the 9:00 a.m. repeat moved to Discovery Kids. Paz, created by Irish author Mary Murphy, was seen in both puppet and animated forms; Discovery&#x27;s Marjorie Kaplan saw him as &quot;the avatar for his audience, the optimistic, persistent learner we want each of our viewers to be&quot;, and with his introduction, &quot;hop[ed] for a &#x27;less hyper, more unified programming environment.&#x27;&quot; &quot;The Magic School Bus&quot;, a 1990s PBS staple, bookended the revised three-hour stretch. During &quot;Ready&quot; last few years, new programs on the block premiered on Discovery Kids a week ahead of TLC.

The final TLC airing of &quot;Ready Set Learn!&quot; occurred on September 26, 2008, with &quot;Bigfoot Presents: Meteor and the Mighty Monster Trucks&quot; and &quot;The Magic School Bus&quot; in its closing hour. From that point on, reruns of TLC&#x27;s remaining programs for older audiences occupied its timeslot. By then, the Discovery Kids version was airing from 9:00 a.m. till 2:00 p.m.; it evolved into &quot;HubBub&quot; after the network&#x27;s October 10, 2010 rebranding as The Hub. As part of a cross-channel preview campaign leading up to The Hub&#x27;s debut, TLC briefly returned to family-oriented entertainment with an airing of the Hasbro game show &quot;Family Game Night&quot;.

==Reception==
Almost three weeks before its launch, the &quot;Hartford Courant&quot; was skeptical on whether the original &quot;Ready Set Learn!&quot; could succeed as &quot;educational television&quot;, writing, &quot;What children will learn first and foremost from this &#x27;unprecedented&#x27; offering is how to watch TV, something they will master all too soon without TLC.&quot; The block managed to premiere to positive press; Peggy Charren of Action for Children&#x27;s Television approved of its commercial-free nature, while a reporter for the &quot;Northwest Florida Daily News&quot; said, &quot;From what I&#x27;ve seen, they&#x27;re doing a pretty good job [at making television a teacher].&quot; Lynne Heffley of &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; favorably reviewed the 2003 relaunch, citing &quot;Hi-5&quot; (a U.S. remake of an Australian format) and &quot;The Save-Ums!&quot; as the standouts. &quot;All the new shows are colorful, watchable and scrupulously created with the principles of child development firmly in mind,&quot; she said. &quot;Several feature characters who talk directly to viewers, in the tradition of the best children&#x27;s programming.&quot;

In October 1993, &quot;Ready Set Learn!&quot; helped TLC secure one of that season&#x27;s five Golden CableACE nomination slots; upon its return in 1994–95, the block received a CableACE Creators Award. During its original run, it was also honored by the National Education Association and the American Academy of Children&#x27;s Entertainment. In 2005, the relaunch era&#x27;s Paz segments won a Silver Parents&#x27; Choice Award.

==Merchandise==
A merchandising line for &quot;Ready Set Learn!&quot;, featuring coloring books and videotapes, was actively considered from the time of its planning stages. Discovery chose Professor Iris to represent the first products under the brand—first through three VHS collections in August 1993, and then through two CD-ROM titles, &quot;Fun Field Trip: Animal Safari&quot; in November 1994 and &quot;Seaside Adventure&quot; in May 1995. By the twilight of the block&#x27;s tenure (during 2006–2008), DVD releases of select shows went through Genius Products.

<doc id="1168923" wikidata="Q3283342" url="?curid=1168923" title="Arabian Knights">
<text>Arabian Knights is an animated segment of &quot;The Banana Splits Adventure Hour&quot;, created by Hanna-Barbera Productions. The series is based on the &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;, a classic work of Middle Eastern literature. The cast includes Henry Corden, Paul Frees, Frank Gerstle, Shari Lewis, Jay North and John Stephenson.

==Plot: Secret origins==
Once a peaceful country, Persia was overrun by the powerful forces of the evil conqueror Bakaar the Black Sultan. When all the states of Persia were overthrown, Bakaar invaded the capital city of Baghdad. Bakaar and his forces breached the royal palace and forcibly claimed the throne from Prince Turhan and ordered the prince to be killed.

Prince Turhan fled the palace, pursued by the guards of Bakaar. In his escape, the prince is helped by a magician named Fariik who with his magic slipped away from the guards. On their way to the state of El-Rabaul to seek aid from his uncle the Caliph, Turhan and Fariik meet Raseem while being chased by the guards in the Caves of Doom. Raseem tells them that Bakaar&#x27;s forces have already usurped the throne of El-Rabaul and imprisoned the Caliph and his daughter Princess Nida. The trio then heads to El-Rabaul on Raseem&#x27;s donkey Zazuum.

In El-Rabaul, they rescue Princess Nida who is about to be sold into slavery. There, Princess Nida demonstrates her mastery of disguise and voice mimicry by tricking the guards, but they soon find themselves cornered by Bakaar&#x27;s men. There Bez jumps into the scene, shapeshifts into an elephant, charges through the guards, and carries everyone to safety. In the Caves of Doom, they decide to form a heroic band and swear to protect their land from the tyranny of Bakaar, thus forming an alliance called the Arabian Knights.

==Series direction==
&quot;Arabian Knights&quot; was one of several animated miniseries used as filler segments for Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s &quot;Banana Splits Adventure Hour&quot; show. Each episode ran between 9 and 10 minutes in length. For the most part, it competed with the other series, namely the animated &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;, the part live action, part animated &quot;Micro Ventures&quot;, and the live action &quot;Danger Island&quot; segments.

Often, the general thrust of the &quot;Arabian Knights&quot; adventures deals with the Knights trying to effect some action against Bakaar’s soldiers, finding a means to further complete their goal of turning the tables on the evil dictator, or dealing with another villain set within the Knights&#x27; universe.

For the most part, these adventures were done with a semi-serious slant, with a good portion of action and comedy mixed in. Hardly anyone was injured or harmed—save for Bakaar&#x27;s minions (with a usually comic effect), and the episodes usually had an upbeat, happy ending for the Knights.

==Characters==
===The Arabian Knights===
* Prince Turhan (voiced by Jay North) – The prince of Baghdad and rightful heir to the throne of the Sultan, Turhan is a young and handsome teenage boy. Apart from being brave and bold, he is an agile acrobat, an athlete, and a master swordsman. Turhan gathers a small group of friends to lead a revolt against the tyranny of Bakaar and reclaim his throne to restore the peace and prosperity in his state. Turhan is the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the Knights and the driving force behind fighting Bakaar and ending the usurper’s reign. He owns a magic scimitar that can be thrown and returns like a boomerang, in unique ways. It is speculated he was a prototype for Fred Jones
* Princess Nida (voiced by Shari Lewis) – Daughter of the Caliph of El-Rabaul, Princess Nida is a beautiful teenage girl who is the cousin of Prince Turhan. She is a master of disguise and an expert of voice mimicry. Nida is also skilled in martial arts and can hold her own in the Knights&#x27; battles. 
* Fariik the Magician (voiced by John Stephenson) – A short, tubby, jolly little man, Fariik is a skilled practitioner and spell-master of the mystical arts who lends a magical hand when needed. To cast his spell, Fariik would say his magic words, &quot;Rosan Kobar.&quot; And has done variations of that incantation, like one time he said, “Rosan Korkapukus” to conjure corks in the ears of guards. He is the first to have offered aid to Turhan after Prince Turhan is deposed by Bakaar. Sometimes, the magic gets very difficult and can take a lot of energy out of him. Fariik can animate carpets and pillows for the occasional airborne transport of the team. Fariik can render himself and others invisible for stealth or camouflage purposes. At times, he can dissolve himself and others into smoke to make an escape from narrow places. He can levitate objects, alter the size of things and persons, create things out of thin air, and alter the form of one thing into another.
* Raseem the Strong (voiced by Frank Gerstle) – A tall muscular man with brief costume and fez, Raseem is the powerhouse of the team with incredible physical strength, endurance, and stamina. He first met Turhan and Fariik when they hid in the Caves of Doom that he occupies. Raseem mistakes them for Bakaar&#x27;s men and attacks them. However, upon learning they are against Bakaar, he befriends them, and he goes with them to find the Caliph (to get his aid against Bakaar). He often boasts of his strength, saying he is as strong as 30 men. At one time, Raseem said he was as strong as seven elephants. Strong enough to shatter stone walls, lift and catch boulders, catch and throw back cannonballs, and fight off scores of Bakaar&#x27;s soldiers at a time, Raseem&#x27;s power makes for a good equalizer in the Knights&#x27; battles. He is very similar to the portrayal of Porthos from the other Banana Splits cartoon The Three Musketeers both are charaterised as being inhumanly Strong and have deep booming voices.
* Zazuum (voiced by Don Messick, originally falsely attributed to be Paul Frees) – Raseem&#x27;s faithful little donkey with long ears, Zazuum was first used by Turhan, Fariik, and Raheem to get to El-Rabaul. Zazuum is quite an intelligent donkey as he aids his fellow team members. Zazuum can spin himself so fast he becomes like a destructive miniature tornado that can defeat any enemy or destroy anything coming his way. He does not like his tail to be pulled, as it enrages him to the point of being a berserk loose cannon that can shatter rocks into pebbles. In addition, Zazuum can smell gold very precisely.
* Bez the Beast (voiced by Henry Corden) – A dark-skinned man with a turban and green clothing, Bez can shapeshift into any animal, bird, or aquatic creature, from a mighty elephant to a tiny mouse. Often, he triggers this ability by speaking the phrase “Size of a —!” and naming the animal or bird he wishes to turn into, followed by a loud boom that proclaims his transformation. Sometimes the magical phrase is followed by clapping his hands together. If the creature is small enough, Bez can turn into many versions of it such as turning into a million bees. Bez is known to turn into some larger animals which often serve as alternate modes of transportation for the Arabian Knights like an elephant or a camel for land transportation. He can also transform into mythical creatures like a winged stallion or a roc for the occasional airborne transportation. His shapeshifting makes him a handy spy for the Knights in order to find out what Bakaar is planning.

===Villains===
* Bakaar the Black Sultan (voiced by John Stephenson) – The corrupt conqueror and nemesis of the Arabian Knights, Bakaar usurps the throne of Turhan&#x27;s father and takes control of Baghdad. Clearly wishing to command all of the kingdoms that bow to Baghdad, he sets all of his forces to the goal of capturing Turhan (and later all of the Knights) to secure his place on the throne. While cruel, Bakaar does not usually involve himself directly in the fight against the Knights. He prefers to let his soldiers and minions to do the job. Bakaar&#x27;s distinctive manner of dress—a single-spiked, fur-lined helmet in place of a crown—hints at ancestry from the Mongols.
** Vangore (voiced by Paul Frees) – Bakaar&#x27;s enforcer and captain of his guards. Often hatches plots to capture the Knights. Apparently, Vangore&#x27;s father was a camel driver. He has red hair shaved to a topknot (which would historically be an indication of Galatian ancestry and of being enslaved).
** Sundar – Bakaar&#x27;s court magician.

<doc id="1168927" wikidata="Q4526457" url="?curid=1168927" title="The Spire">
<text>The Spire is a 1964 novel by English author William Golding. &quot;A dark and powerful portrait of one man&#x27;s will&quot;, it deals with the construction of a 404-foot-high spire loosely based on Salisbury Cathedral, the vision of the fictional Dean Jocelin. In the novel, Golding utilises stream-of-consciousness writing with an omniscient but increasingly fallible narrator to show Jocelin&#x27;s demise as he chooses to follow his own will as opposed to the will of God.

==Background==

&quot;The Spire&quot; was envisioned by Golding as a historical novel with a moral struggle at its core, which was originally intended to have two settings: both the Middle Ages and modern day. Whilst teaching at Bishop Wordsworth&#x27;s School, Golding regularly looked out of his classroom window at Salisbury Cathedral and wondered how he would possibly construct its spire But the book&#x27;s composition and eventual realisation of &quot;The Spire&quot; was not an easy process for Golding. According to his daughter, Judy Carver, Golding &#x27;struggled like anything to write The Spire&#x27; and said that the novel &#x27;went through many drafts&#x27;; this was perhaps because he had stopped teaching which, in turn, gave him more time to write.

Golding first wrote fifty to sixty thousand words of a draft in February 1962 over just fourteen days and decided to take a grace period in order to finish the novel for English and American publication by December of the same year. However, by November he &#x27;confessed that he was in &quot;a state of misery&quot; over the novel&#x27;. One reason for his discontent may have been Golding&#x27;s longstanding &#x27;terror of adverse criticism&#x27; as well as his editor, Charles Monteith, repeatedly asking him to co-edit an anthology of modern poetry with W. H. Auden and discouraging him from writing his own poetry collection. After a lecturing trip to America in February and March 1963, Golding found that he was still struggling to write when he returned, and worried greatly about both the novel&#x27;s narrative and its relevance to a contemporary audience.

As tended to be the case, Golding&#x27;s fears were ultimately unnecessary; Monteith and Peter du Sautoy liked the typescript but agreed that it required editing. Golding was pleased at the news, and Monteith sent back edits which suggested splitting the novel into chapters; by 17 July 1963, Golding reported that he had reworked the first three chapters and was confident he would finish the book over the next fortnight. However, Golding first had to attend a conference by &#x27;COMES, the European community of writers&#x27; and, despite telling Monteith on 27 August that his revisions would be complete in the next ten days, William and Ann Golding went to Greece to meet Peter Green: an ex-journalist who had expatriated to Molyvos.

After working on the novel in Greece, a frustrated Golding sent his next draft of &quot;The Spire&quot; to Monteith in October and was unsatisfied with his writing owing to an &#x27;inner dispute between religion and reason&#x27;. This internal conflict occurred as Golding continued to return corrected typescripts and proofs but, though Golding had been feeling nervous since January, the novel was published on 10 April 1964. The typescripts for &quot;The Spire&quot;, along with a page of handwritten manuscript notes, can now be found in the University of Exeter&#x27;s Special Collections archive.

==Plot==

Jocelin, the Dean of the cathedral, directs the construction of a towering spire funded by his aunt, Lady Alison, a mistress of the former King. The project is carried on against the advice of many, and in particular the warnings of the master builder, Roger Mason. The cathedral has insufficient foundations to support a spire of the magnificence demanded by Jocelin, but he believes he has been chosen by God and given a vision to erect a great spire to exalt the town and to bring its people closer to God. As the novel progresses, Golding explores Jocelin&#x27;s growing obsession with the completion of the spire, during which he is increasingly afflicted by pain in his spine (which the reader gradually comes to realise is the result of tuberculosis). Jocelin interprets the burning heat in his back as an angel, alternately comforting or punishing him depending on the warmth or pain he feels. Jocelin&#x27;s obsession blinds him to reality as he neglects his duties as Dean, fails to pray and ignores the people who need him the most. The pit dug to explore the foundations at the Cathedral crossing becomes a place where chthonic forces surge, as the four tower pillars begin to &#x27;sing&#x27;.

Jocelin also struggles with his unacknowledged lust for Goody Pangall, the wife of the crippled and impotent cathedral servant, Pangall. Jocelin seems at first to see Goody as his daughter in God. However, as the novel progresses, and Goody&#x27;s husband is tormented and ridiculed as their &#x27;fool&#x27; by the bullying workmen, Jocelin becomes tormented by sexual desire, usually triggered by the sight of Goody&#x27;s red hair.

Comparisons between Goody and Rachel, Roger Mason&#x27;s wife, are made throughout the novel. Jocelin believes Goody sets an example to Rachel, whom he dislikes for her garrulousness and for revealing that her marriage to Roger remains unconsummated. However, Jocelin overestimates Goody&#x27;s purity, and is horrified when he discovers Goody is embarking upon an affair with Roger Mason. Tortured by envy and guilt, Jocelin finds himself unable to pray. He is repulsed by his sexual thoughts, referred to as &quot;the devil&quot; during his dreams.

The Cathedral building, its ordered life, and the lives of the people around Jocelin are disrupted because of the intractable problems arising from the construction of the spire, but Jocelin continues to drive his dream to its conclusion. His visions and hallucinations, hence his denial of the reality of the situation, mark his descent into irrationality. As the true costs, financial and spiritual, of the endeavour become apparent, the story moves to its tragic conclusion.

Pangall disappears; although his fate is never made explicit, it is clear from the clue of the mistletoe that he was a pagan sacrifice buried at the Crossing by the builders to secure their luck against the stupidity of continuing the work. Goody Pangall dies in childbirth, bearing Roger Mason&#x27;s child. Roger becomes a drunkard and at the end Jocelin dies of his illness, though only after first hearing from his aunt that his appointment was due only to her sexual influence, not to his merits. Before he dies, the phallic imagery of the Spire is displaced by the mysterious symbol of the tree. The spire is incomplete at the end of the story, and there is a growing sense of impending disaster due to the instability of the over-ambitious structure.

==Characters==

===Jocelin===

Dean Jocelin is the character through whom the novel is presented. Golding uses the stream of consciousness technique to show his Lear-like descent into madness. The novel charts the destruction of his self-confidence and ambition. As the construction of the spire draws to an end, Jocelin is removed from his position as Dean and his abandonment of his religious duties is denounced by the church Council. Ultimately, he succumbs to his illness which he had personified as his guardian angel.

Jocelin may have been named after Josceline de Bohon, Bishop of Salisbury from 1142 to 1184, who is buried in Salisbury Cathedral.

===Roger Mason===

Roger Mason, a medieval Master Mason, is, in direct contrast to Jocelin, physically powerful and a rationalist. He is associated with the imagery of a bull and a stallion. Roger contends with Jocelin, arguing that the cathedral foundations are insufficient to support the spire. He is forced to continue with the project because Jocelin makes it impossible for him to work elsewhere. After the death of Goody, Roger becomes an alcoholic. In a moment of clarity, Jocelin visits Roger and we eventually learn of his suicide attempt.

===Rachel===

Rachel Mason is Roger&#x27;s wife. She reveals to Jocelin the reason why they cannot have children as attempts at sex result in fits of giggles.

===Pangall===

Pangall is the crippled and impotent cathedral servant. He is mocked because of his impotency by the workmen.

===Goody===

Goody, who acts as an important object of love and lust, ultimately dies while giving birth. Jocelin initially sees her as the perfect woman.

===Father Anselm===

Anselm is largely critical of the developments concerning the spire, arguing that it is destruction of the church. Jocelin had been prepared to lose his friendship with Anselm as part of the cost of the spire, but we learn by the end of the novel that they appeared not to have had a friendship in the first place.

===Father Adam===

Father Adam is dubbed by Jocelin as &quot;Father Anonymous&quot;, indicating Jocelin&#x27;s feelings of superiority. Until the end of the novel, when Father Adam becomes Jocelin&#x27;s caretaker, he is largely a minor character who is surprised by how Jocelin was never taught to pray, doing his best to help him to heaven.

===Lady Alison===

A wealthy mistress of the late King, we learn how the money funding the spire was a result of this affair. With the appearance of a &quot;tiny woman – not much larger than a child&quot;, she is plump and pale, wearing a black dress, black hair, eyes and make-up, with mainly small features. Her wealth and sexuality is presented through her pearls and perfume and she takes care of her appearance, having smooth skin with fine lines, despite her age.

==Symbolism==

===Paganism===

The workmen are referred to as &quot;an army&quot; and Jocelin is confronted numerous times by those who disagree with the disruption they cause. Pangall is their eventual sacrifice, buried &quot;beneath the crossways&quot; with mistletoe between his ribs. The mistletoe can be viewed as a metaphor in terms of horror and the word &quot;obscene&quot; occurs several times (the Druids&#x27; idea that the berries were the semen of the Gods may well contribute to Jocelin&#x27;s revulsion). &quot;The riotous confusion of its branches&quot; is alarming as well as is Jocelin&#x27;s disgust at the berry on his shoe. Golding weaves the mistletoe as a pagan symbol into the naturalistic treatment of it as a sign of a physical threat to the spire. Mistletoe grows on living oak trees – if the wood used in the building is unseasoned, the mistletoe will continue to grow on it, revealing a scientifically explicable danger.

===Imagery===

Goody&#x27;s &quot;red hair&quot; can be seen as symbolic for a number of things. Sexual dreams, female sexuality, the devil, lust and desire being some of the possible ideas around it. Constant animal symbolism between Roger and Goody (referred to as a bear, a bull and a stallion or a stag at various points in the novel) are also a possible indication of Jocelin&#x27;s lack of social awareness, his childlike qualities and his naivety. However, Goody is said to wear a green dress, which contrasts Rachel Mason&#x27;s red dress – the green can perhaps symbolise nature (a recurring paganistic theme in the novel) and the red represents Rachel&#x27;s undesirable &quot;fiery&quot; personality. Goody is portrayed as a quiet &quot;good woman&quot; by Jocelin (whose view is the platform for this novel) and Rachel is not. The irony being that Goody&#x27;s unfaithfulness is hidden by her hat, and only occasionally do we spot her flame red hair (and infidelity).

The spire Jocelin wishes to raise in itself can be seen as a phallic symbol, as Jocelin initially views the model of it as a man lying on his back.

Religious imagery is used towards the end of the novel, where Jocelin lies dying. Jocelin declares &quot;it&#x27;s like the apple-tree!&quot;, making a reference to the Garden of Eden and Humanity&#x27;s first sin of temptation but also perhaps the pagan ideas that have been constantly threaded into Jocelin&#x27;s mind as he spends more and more time up in the Spire, raised above the ground (and further away from his church and his role as God&#x27;s voice on earth).

===Spire/Spine===
Jocelin&#x27;s degrading spine can be seen as a micro-macro analogy to the unstable spire. He believes the former manifests as the presence of his angel on his back whereas the latter is the will of God. His narcissism is belied by these failing structures he reinterprets to maintain his worldview.

==Reception==
&quot;A most remarkable book, as unforeseeable as one foresaw, an entire original ... remote from the mainstream, potent, severe, even forbidding.&quot; – Frank Kermode, New York Review of Books, 30 April 1964.

== Adaptations ==
Canadian-British director Roger Spottiswoode optioned The Spire in the mid-1990s, originally intending to adapt it for screen and cited as a project in development. In November 2012, a play adaptation by Spottiswoode was premiered at the Salisbury Playhouse, directed by Gareth Minchin.

An audiobook version, voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch, was released by Faber &amp; Faber Audio in 2014. Excerpts from Cumberbatch&#x27;s reading are included in an introductory film on the novel produced by William Golding Limited.

<text>A roll-away computer is an idea introduced as part of a series by Toshiba in 2000, which aimed to predict the trends in personal computing five years into the future. Since its announcement, the roll-away computer has remained a theoretical device.

A roll-away computer is a computer with a flexible polymer-based display technology, measuring 1 mm thick and weighing around 200 grams.

Flexible and rollable displays started entering the market in 2006 (see electronic paper).

The R&amp;D department of Seiko Epson has demonstrated a flexible active-matrix LCD panel (including the pixel thin film transistors and the peripheral TFT drivers), a flexible active-matrix OLED panel, the world&#x27;s first flexible 8-bit asynchronous CPU (ACT11)—which uses the world&#x27;s first flexible SRAM.

University of Tokyo researchers have demonstrated flexible flash memory.

LG Corporation has demonstrated an 18-inch high-definition video display panel that can roll up into a 3 cm diameter tube.

<doc id="1168932" wikidata="Q382288" url="?curid=1168932" title="Christian Freeling">
<text>Christian Freeling (born 1 February 1947, in Enschede, Netherlands) is a Dutch game designer and inventor of abstract strategy games, notably Dameo, Grand Chess, Havannah, and Hexdame.

Freeling&#x27;s designs cover a range of game types. Several of his games are endeavors to improve on established games that he concluded are flawed or limited in some way, while some introduce familiar game mechanics into uncommon settings. He also regularly translates rules for orthogonal board games to the hexagonal grid, resulting in new versions with altered properties – usually enhanced strategy and tactics options, and fewer draws.

&quot;Christian&#x27;s games often embody a desire to get to the heart of the concepts used in abstract games. This is most clearly displayed by his minimalist chess variant, Chad, and his version of column checkers, Emergo.&quot;

Among all his games, Freeling considers Dameo, Emergo, Grand Chess, Storisende, Sygo, and Symple to be his most important, with Emergo as his personal favourite.

==Notable games==
Dameo is a draughts/checkers variant inspired by International draughts and a variant of Turkish draughts called Croda invented by Ljuban Dedić. Dameo utilizes all 64 squares of the checkerboard and uses both orthogonal and diagonal movement, although capture is orthogonal only. It also introduces linear movement of men where lines of men of any length may move forward together, similar to Epaminondas or Bushka. This was added to speed play, enhance tactics, and curtail draws. &quot;Considerable work has already gone into analyzing Dameo, and some remarkable discoveries have been made in the area of endgame positions with just a few pieces left.&quot;

Grand Chess utilizes the same compound pieces as Capablanca Chess, but the starting setup the rooks, giving immediate freedom of movement and &quot;yields the better game&quot; . Internet Grand Chess World Championships have been held, and NOST sponsored yearly tournaments beginning in 1998. A Grand Chess tournament in Yerevan in 1996 attracted 21 chess masters.

Havannah, a connection game using hexagonal cells like Hex, offers &quot;a subtler strategy and much more varied tactics&quot; . The game was published by Ravensburger in 1981 and marketed for ten years, winning critical acclaim. In 2002, Freeling offered a €1,000 prize for any computer program in ten years that could beat him in even one game in a 10-game match, believing the nature of Havannah made the game difficult to program and therefore best played by human strategic thinking. In October 2012, via Internet, a 10-game match was conducted between Freeling and three Havannah bots. Freeling won by +7−3=0, losing two games to Lajkonik (Poland) and one game to Castro (Canada).

Hexdame exactly translates international draughts rules to a hexagonal gameboard, increasing options for moves and tactics, and reducing draws. The World Draughts Federation (FMJD) has actively promoted Hexdame as an alternative to the 10×10 game.

==Personal life==
On 13 May 2000 in Enschede, SE Fireworks exploded 120 meters from Freeling&#x27;s home, killing 23 people, wounding 947, and destroying 400 houses including Freeling&#x27;s. Although uninjured, all his possessions and game materials were lost in the tragedy.

Freeling has three sons (Demian, born 1975; Myron, born 1978; Falco, born 1993) and one daughter (Ninja, born 1982). Demian invented Congo, a xiangqi variant, in 1982 when nearly 8 years old.

<text>The Great Locomotive Chase (a portion of the Andrews&#x27; Raid or the Mitchel Raid) was a military raid that occurred April 12, 1862, in northern Georgia during the American Civil War. Volunteers from the Union Army, led by civilian scout James J. Andrews, commandeered a train, &quot;The General&quot;, and took it northward toward Chattanooga, Tennessee, doing as much damage as possible to the vital Western and Atlantic Railroad (W&amp;A) line from Atlanta to Chattanooga as they went. They were pursued by Confederate forces at first on foot, and later on a succession of locomotives, including &quot;The Texas&quot;, for .

Because the Union men had cut the telegraph wires, the Confederates could not send warnings ahead to forces along the railway. Confederates eventually captured the raiders and quickly executed some as spies, including Andrews; some others were able to flee. The surviving raiders were the first to be awarded the newly created Medal of Honor by the US Congress for their actions. As a civilian, Andrews was not eligible.

== Military background ==
After the Union capture of Fort Henry and Fort Donelson in February, Confederate General Albert Sidney Johnston withdrew his forces from central Tennessee to reorganize. As part of this withdrawal, Johnston evacuated Nashville on February 23, surrendering this important industrial center to Union Brig. Gen. Don Carlos Buell&#x27;s Department of the Ohio army and making it the first Confederate state capital to fall to the Union. After taking Nashville, Buell showed little inclination for further offensive operations, especially towards the pro-Union region of East Tennessee. On March 11, Buell&#x27;s army was merged into the new Department of the Mississippi under General Henry Halleck. In late March, Halleck ordered Buell southwest to reinforce Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s army near Pittsburg Landing on the Tennessee River. Buell departed, leaving a 7,000-man garrison in Nashville along with Maj. Gen. Ormsby Mitchel&#x27;s 10,000-man 3rd Division. Mitchel had earlier assisted in the capture of Nashville and accepted the surrender of the city. With the withdrawal of both Confederate and Union forces towards western Tennessee, central Tennessee became an economy of force operation. Facing minimal Confederate resistance, Mitchel moved his division southeast out of Nashville on March 18 towards Murfreesboro, arriving on March 20.

==The first raid: March==

James J. Andrews was a Kentucky-born civilian serving as a secret agent and scout in Tennessee, for Major General Don Carlos Buell in the spring of 1862. Sometime before Buell departed Nashville in late March, Andrews presented him with a plan to take eight men to steal a train in Georgia, and drive it north. Buell would later confirm in August 1863 that he authorized this expedition. According to Andrews, a train engineer in Atlanta was willing to defect to the Union with his train, if Andrews could supply a volunteer train crew to assist running the train, tearing up track, and burning bridges. The main target was the railway bridge at Bridgeport, Alabama, although future Andrews Raider William Pittenger believed Andrews also intended to target several other bridges in Georgia and Tennessee. The volunteers for this first raid all came from General Mitchel&#x27;s division, which was encamped at Murfreesboro, Tennessee. Moving south forty miles on foot to the Confederate railhead at Tullahoma, the raiders were then able to travel by train down to Marietta, Georgia. There, Andrews discovered the engineer had been pressed into service elsewhere. Andrews asked if any of the raiders knew how to operate a locomotive; when none did, he called the raid off. Two raiders were also confronted by Confederate soldiers while trying to cut the telegraph lines, but successfully pretended to be overworked wiremen. The raiders then returned north to Union lines, arriving about a week after they had departed. Andrews spent several additional days conducting reconnaissance on the Western and Atlantic Railroad before also departing back north to federal lines. None of the original raiders would volunteer for the second raid. One added that &quot;he felt all the time he was in the enemy’s country as though he had a rope around his neck.&quot;

==Background==
Major General Ormsby M. Mitchel, commanding Federal troops in middle Tennessee, sought a way to contract or shrink the extent of the northern and western borders of the Confederacy by pushing them permanently away from and out of contact with the Ohio and Mississippi valleys. This could be done by first a southward and then an eastward penetration from the Union base at Nashville, which would seize and sever the Memphis &amp; Charleston Railroad between Memphis and Chattanooga (at the time there were no other railway links between the Mississippi River and the east) and then capture the water and railway junction of Chattanooga, Tennessee, thereby severing the Western Confederacy&#x27;s contact with both the Ohio and Mississippi river valleys.

At the time, the standard means of capturing a city was by encirclement to cut it off from supplies and reinforcements, then would follow artillery bombardment and direct assault by massed infantry. However, Chattanooga&#x27;s natural water and mountain barriers to its east and south made this nearly impossible with the forces that Mitchel had available. When the Union Army threatened Chattanooga, the Confederate States Army would (from its naturally protected rear) first reinforce Chattanooga&#x27;s garrison from Atlanta. When sufficient forces had been deployed to Chattanooga to stabilize the situation and hold the line, the Confederates would then launch a counterattack from Chattanooga with the advantage of a local superiority of men and materiel. It was this process that the Andrews raid sought to disrupt. If he could somehow block railroad reinforcement of the city from Atlanta to the southeast, Mitchel could take Chattanooga. The Union Army would then have rail reinforcement and supply lines to its rear, leading west to the Union-held stronghold and supply depot of Nashville, Tennessee.

==Planning==
James J. Andrews, still a civilian scout and part-time spy, proposed another daring raid to Mitchel that would destroy the Western and Atlantic Railroad as a useful reinforcement and supply link to Chattanooga from Atlanta and the rest of Georgia. He recruited the men known later as the Andrews Raiders. These were the civilian William Hunter Campbell and 22 volunteer Union soldiers from three Ohio regiments: the 2nd, 21st, and 33rd Ohio Infantry. Andrews instructed the men to arrive in Marietta, Georgia, by midnight of April 10, but heavy rain caused a one-day delay. They traveled in small parties in civilian attire to avoid arousing suspicion. All but two (Samuel Llewellyn and James Smith) reached the designated rendezvous point at the appointed time. Llewellyn and Smith joined a Confederate artillery unit, as they had been instructed to do in such circumstances. Andrews&#x27; proposal was a combined operation; General Mitchel and his forces would first move on Chattanooga; then, the Andrews’ Raid would promptly destroy the rail line between Chattanooga and Atlanta. These essentially simultaneous actions would bring about the capture of Chattanooga. Andrews&#x27; Raid was intended to deprive the Confederates of the integrated use of the railways to respond to a Union advance, using their interior lines of communication.

The plan was to steal a train on its run north towards Chattanooga, stopping to damage or destroy track, bridges, telegraph wires, and track switches behind them, so as to prevent the Confederate Army from being able to move troops and supplies from Atlanta to Chattanooga. The raiders planned to cross through the Federal siege lines on the outskirts of Chattanooga and rejoin Mitchel&#x27;s army.

Because railway dining cars were not yet in common use, railroad timetables included water, rest, and meal stops. They planned to steal a train just north of Atlanta at Big Shanty, Georgia (now Kennesaw). They chose Big Shanty because they thought Big Shanty did not have a telegraph office and the stop would also be used to refuel and take on water for the steep grade further north.

==The chase==
===Big Shanty to Kingston===

The raid began on April 12, 1862, when the regular morning passenger train from Atlanta, with the locomotive &quot;General&quot;, stopped for breakfast at the Lacy Hotel. They took the &quot;General&quot; and the train&#x27;s three boxcars, which were behind the tender in front of the passenger cars. The passenger cars were left behind. Andrews had previously obtained from the work crew a crowbar for tearing up track.

The train&#x27;s conductor, William Allen Fuller, and two other men, chased the stolen train, first on foot, then by a handcar belonging to a work crew shortly north of Big Shanty. Locomotives of the time normally averaged , with short bursts of speed of about . In addition, the terrain north of Atlanta is very hilly, and the ruling grades are steep. Even today, average speeds are rarely greater than between Chattanooga and Atlanta. Since Andrews intended to stop periodically to perform acts of sabotage, a determined pursuer, even on foot, could conceivably have caught up with the train before it reached Chattanooga.

At Etowah, the raiders passed the older and smaller locomotive &quot;Yonah&quot; which was on a siding that led to the nearby Cooper Iron Works. Andrews considered stopping to attack and destroy that locomotive so it could not be used by pursuers, but given the size of its work party (even though unarmed) relative to the size of the raiding party, he judged that any firefight would be too long and too involved, and would alert nearby troops and civilians.

As the raiders had stolen a regularly scheduled train on a railroad with only one track, they needed to keep to that train&#x27;s timetable. If they reached a siding ahead of schedule, they had to wait there until scheduled southbound trains passed them before they could continue north. Andrews claimed to the station masters he encountered that his train was a special northbound ammunition movement ordered by General Beauregard in support of his operations against the Union forces threatening Chattanooga. This story was sufficient for the isolated station masters Andrews encountered (as he had cut the telegraph wires to the south), but it had no impact upon the train dispatchers and station masters north of him, whose telegraph lines to Chattanooga were working. These dispatchers were following their orders to dispatch and control the special train movements southward at the highest priority.
Thus delayed at the junction town of Kingston, as the first of the southbound freight evacuation trains approached, Andrews inquired of that train&#x27;s conductor why his train was carrying a red marker flag on its rear car. Andrews was told that Confederate Railway officials in Chattanooga had been notified by Confederate Army officials that Mitchel was approaching Chattanooga from Stevenson, Alabama, intending to either capture or lay siege to the city, and as a result of this warning, the Confederate Military Railways had ordered the Special Freight movements. The red train marker flag on the southbound train meant that there was at least one additional train behind the one which Andrews had just encountered, and that Andrews had no &quot;authority for movement&quot; until the last train of that sectional movement had passed him. The raiders being delayed at Kingston for over an hour, this gave Fuller all the time he needed to close the distance.

===Kingston to Adairsville===

The raiders finally pulled out of Kingston only moments before Fuller&#x27;s arrival. They still managed north of Kingston again to cut the telegraph wire and break a rail. Meanwhile, moving north on the handcar, Fuller had spotted the locomotive &quot;Yonah&quot; at Etowah and commandeered it, chasing the raiders north all the way to Kingston. There, Fuller switched to the locomotive &quot;William R. Smith,&quot; which was on a sidetrack leading west to the town of Rome, Georgia, and continued north towards Adairsville.

 Two miles south of Adairsville, however, the pursuers were stopped by the broken track, forcing Fuller and his party to continue the pursuit on foot. Beyond the damaged section, he took command of the southbound locomotive &quot;Texas&quot; south of Calhoun, where Andrews had passed it, running it backwards. The &quot;Texas&quot; train crew had been bluffed by Andrews at Calhoun into taking the station siding, thereby allowing the &quot;General&quot; to continue northward along the single-track main line. Fuller, when he met the &quot;Texas&quot;, took command of her, picked up eleven Confederate troops at Calhoun, and continued his pursuit, tender-first, northward.

===Adairsville to Ringgold===

The raiders now never got far ahead of Fuller and never had enough time to stop and take up a rail to halt the &quot;Texas&quot;. Destroying the railway behind the hijacked train was a slow process. The raiders were too few in number and were too poorly equipped with the proper railway track tools and demolition equipment, and the rain that day made it difficult to burn the bridges. As well, railway officials in Chattanooga had sufficient time to evacuate engines and rolling stock to the south, hauling critical railroad supplies away from the Union threat, so as to prevent their either being captured by General Mitchel or trapped uselessly inside Chattanooga during a Union siege of the city.

With the &quot;Texas&quot; still chasing the &quot;General&quot; tender-first, the two trains steamed through Dalton and Tunnel Hill. The raiders continued to sever the telegraph wires, but they were unable to burn bridges or damage Tunnel Hill. The wood they had hoped to burn was soaked by rain. Just before the raiders cut the telegraph wire north of Dalton, Fuller managed to send off a message from there alerting the authorities in Chattanooga of the approaching stolen engine.

Finally, at milepost 116.3, north of Ringgold, Georgia, just 18 miles from Chattanooga, with the locomotive out of fuel, Andrews&#x27;s men abandoned the &quot;General&quot; and scattered. Andrews and all of his men were caught within two weeks, including the two who had missed the hijacking. Mitchell&#x27;s attack on Chattanooga ultimately failed.

==Aftermath==
===Trials and executions===

Confederate forces charged all the raiders with &quot;acts of unlawful belligerency&quot;; the civilians were charged as unlawful combatants and spies. All the prisoners were tried in military courts, or courts-martial. Tried in Chattanooga, Andrews was found guilty. He was executed by hanging on June 7 in Atlanta. On June 18, seven others who had been transported to Knoxville and convicted as spies were returned to Atlanta and also hanged; their bodies were buried unceremoniously in an unmarked grave. They were later reburied in Chattanooga National Cemetery.

===Escape and exchange===
Writing about the exploit, Corporal William Pittenger said that the remaining raiders worried about also being executed. They attempted to escape and eight succeeded. Traveling for hundreds of miles in pairs, the eight made it back safely to Union lines, including two who were aided by slaves and Union sympathizers and two who floated down the Chattahoochee River until they were rescued by the Union blockade vessel USS &quot;Somerset&quot; in the Gulf of Mexico. The remaining six were held as prisoners of war and exchanged for Confederate prisoners on March 17, 1863.

==Medal of Honor==

On March 20, the recently released raiders arrived in Washington DC, and the following day Pittenger wrote a letter to Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton detailing their mission to Georgia. On March 24, they were interviewed by Judge Advocate General Joseph Holt, who was able to corroborate details of their mission with testimony from the raiders who had escaped in 1862. On March 25, they were invited to Stanton&#x27;s office at the Department of War. After a brief conversation, Stanton announced that the raiders would receive the newly approved Medal of Honor. Private Jacob Parrott, who had been physically abused as a prisoner, was awarded the first. The others were Sergeant Elihu H. Mason, Corporals William Pittenger and William H. H. Reddick, and Privates William Bensinger, Wilson Wright Brown, and Robert Buffum. Stanton also offered them all commissions as First Lieutenant. After the ceremony the six raiders were taken to the White House to meet President Abraham Lincoln, which became a tradition for all Medal of Honor recipients. Later, all but three of the other soldiers who had participated in the raid also received the Medal of Honor, with posthumous awards to families for those who had been executed. As civilians, Andrews and Campbell were not eligible. In 2008, the House of Representatives passed a bill which would retroactively award the Medal of Honor to two of the three remaining raiders, Charles Perry Shadrack and George Davenport Wilson. On July 3, 2024, President Joe Biden posthumously presented the medal to descendants of both Shadrack and Wilson. All the Medals of Honor presented to the Andrews Raiders used identical text.

==Legacy==

Both &quot;The General&quot; and &quot;The Texas&quot; survived the war and have been preserved in museums. &quot;The General&quot; is located at the Southern Museum of Civil War and Locomotive History, in Kennesaw, Georgia, close to where the chase began. &quot;The Texas&quot; is at the Atlanta History Center.

The first account of the chase was published a year after the event in 1863 by William Pittenger, one of the Andrews Raiders, under the title of &quot;Daring and Suffering&quot;. It would be republished in 1881 as &quot;Capturing a Locomotive&quot; and 1889 as &quot;The Great Locomotive Chase&quot;. The book was a major success and was widely praised. Two decades later, one newspaper would claim it “was in half the old soldier households in the country.” 

Buster Keaton&#x27;s silent film comedy &quot;The General&quot; is loosely based on Pittenger&#x27;s memoirs. 

In 1956, Walt Disney Productions released the dramatic film &quot;The Great Locomotive Chase&quot;, also based on Pittenger&#x27;s memoirs, starring Fess Parker as Andrews and Jeffrey Hunter as Fuller and filmed on the Tallulah Falls Railway in North Carolina. Walt Disney, who personally supervised parts of the production, also rented the 4-4-0 locomotives &quot;William Mason&quot; to play &quot;The General&quot;, the &quot;Inyo&quot; to play &quot;The Texas&quot;, and &quot;Lafayette&quot; to play &quot;The Yonah&quot;. The same year, Dell published a paperback original movie tie-in, &quot;The Great Locomotive Chase&quot; by MacLennan Roberts, &quot;Based on the Walt Disney Production and on authentic Civil War documents&quot;, according to the cover blurb.

Since at least 1979, the city of Adairsville has held The Great Locomotive Chase Festival, a three-day festival in October which commemorates the event.

In 2000, composer Robert W. Smith wrote a concert piece named for and inspired by the incident.

In 2019, the raid was featured on Comedy Central show &quot;Drunk History&quot; in the episode &quot;Behind Enemy Lines&quot;, narrated by Jon Gabrus, with John Francis Daley portraying Andrews and Martin Starr as Fuller.

==Monument and markers==
The Ohio monument dedicated to the Andrews Raiders is located at the Chattanooga National Cemetery. There is a scale model of the &quot;General&quot; on top of the monument, and a brief history of the Great Locomotive Chase. The &quot;General&quot; is now in the Southern Museum of Civil War and Locomotive History, Kennesaw, Georgia, while the &quot;Texas&quot; is on display at the Atlanta History Center.

One marker indicates where the chase began, near the Big Shanty Museum (now known as Southern Museum of Civil War and Locomotive History) in Kennesaw, while another shows where the chase ended at Milepost 116.3, north of Ringgold – not far from the recently restored depot at Milepost 114.5.

Kennesaw House, 21 Depot St. (c. 1845), a hotel on the L&amp;N railway in Marietta, Georgia, is a contributing building in the Northwest Marietta Historic District. In 1862 this was the Fletcher House hotel where the Andrews Raiders stayed the night before commandeering &quot;The General&quot;.

There is a historical marker in downtown Atlanta, at the corner of 3rd and Juniper streets, at the site where Andrews was hanged.

<text>Dunvegan () is a village on the Isle of Skye in Scotland. It is famous for Dunvegan Castle, seat of the chiefs of Clan MacLeod. Dunvegan is within the parish of Duirinish. In 2011, it had a population of 386.

==Name==
In &quot;The Norse Influence on Gaelic Scotland&quot; (1910), George Henderson suggests that the name &quot;Dùn Bheagain&quot; derives from Old Gaelic &quot;Dùn Bheccáin&quot; ([the] fort of Beccán), Beccán being a Gaelic personal name. &quot;Dùn Bheagain&quot; would not mean &#x27;little fort&#x27; as this would be &quot;Dùn Beag&quot; in Gaelic.

==Geography==

Dunvegan sits on the shores of the large Loch Dunvegan, and the Old School Restaurant in the village is noted for its fish, caught freshly from the loch itself. Dunvegan is situated at the junction of the A850 and the A863. The B884 road also has a junction with the A863, at the eastern end of Dunvegan.

==Demography==
Dunvegan&#x27;s permanent population is declining. However, numbers staying in the area during holidays have increased dramatically over the years since 2001.
==Economy==
Tourist information used to be situated in the parade of shops at Lochside, but is now available on a seasonal basis at Dunvegan Castle&#x27;s St Kilda Shop. The Giant MacAskill Museum, which celebrates the life of Angus Mòr MacAskill, was established in 1989 and is managed by Peter MacAskill, father of the street trials cycle rider Danny MacAskill.

==Dunvegan Parish Church==

Dunvegan Parish Church, also known as Duirinish Parish Church, is located in Dunvegan. It is a Gothic Revival rectangular church with a battlemented tower, which belongs to the Church of Scotland. The church was built between 1823 and 1832 and is now a Category A listed building. Its Historic Environment Scotland listing refers to &quot;a good set [of] sabre legged Elders&#x27; chairs&quot;.

The historic old manse for the church sits in Kinlochfollart overlooking Dunvegan Loch and is a grade C listed building.

<text>A student publication is a media outlet such as a newspaper, magazine, television show, or radio station produced by students at an educational institution. These publications typically cover local and school-related news, but they may also report on national or international news as well. Most student publications are either part of a curricular class or run as an extracurricular activity.

Student publications serve as both a platform for community discussion and a place for those interested in journalism to develop their skills. These publications report news, publish opinions of students and faculty, and may run advertisements catered to the student body. Besides these purposes, student publications also serve as a watchdog to uncover problems at the respective institution. The majority of student publications are funded through their educational institution. Some funds may be generated through sales and advertisements, but the majority usually comes from the school itself. Because of this, educational institutions have specific ways in which they can influence the publications through funding.

== Online student publications ==
Due to the rise in adoption of Internet accessible devices such as computers and smartphones, many high schools and colleges have begun offering online editions of their publications in addition to printed copies. The first student newspaper in the United States to completely abandon its printed issues in favor of a website was &quot;The Campus Lantern&quot; at Eastern Connecticut State University, doing so in the 2000s; however paper issues of &quot;The Lantern&quot; have since been brought back. Due to publishing content online, student publications are now able to reach a much wider audience than before. With many student publications moving to online, content is more accessible to the student body and production of the content is easier and cheaper. As printed student publications become more and more scarce and student publications move online to best fit the news needs of today&#x27;s students, student newspapers will run into several issues. One of these issues is the increase in demand for new content. While an update once a day or even once a week was once acceptable for a student publication, real time information resources will soon be demanded by students who grew up with constant updates of news coverage. This shift in content demand will require more effort and more time by the student newspaper staff.

One of these issues is what is called the &quot;daily me.&quot; Coined by Cass Sunstein in his book &quot;Republic.com,&quot; the &quot;daily me&quot; is the current trend of online readers looking for personalized information providers. In this way the reader deals with only the subjects they wish to deal with. In this way readers are not inconvenienced by material they have no interest in and can personalize an information product themselves, providing added value to both themselves and the provider. However, some believe this trend may not be the best for society, who is now faced with a public that chooses how well to be informed. On a campus paper, this trend will likely manifest itself in the increased number of &quot;hits&quot; to the common &quot;sports&quot; and &quot;opinion&quot; sections of the paper, while hard news sections go un-noticed. This new type of print culture could possibly result in drastic formatting and content changes for student newspapers.

==Australia==
University student newspapers in Australia are usually independent of university administration yet are connected with or run by the student representative organisation operating at the campus. Editors tend to be elected by the student body on a separate ticket to other student representatives and are paid an honorarium, although some student organisations have been known to employ unelected staff to coordinate the production of the newspaper (an example of this is the national &quot;Student View&quot; newspaper).

===Controversy===
Australian student newspapers have courted controversy since their inception. One of the more notorious of these controversies involved the publication of an article which allegedly incited readers to shoplift. The July edition of the magazine was banned by the Office of Film and Literature Classification following a campaign by conservative talkback radio hosts and other media to have the material banned. The four editors of the July 1995 edition of La Trobe University student magazine &quot;Rabelais&quot; were subsequently charged with publishing, distributing and depositing an objectionable publication. An objectional publication was defined in this case, as one that incites criminal activity. The editors lodged an appeal, which led to a protracted four-year court case. The appeal was eventually defeated by the full bench of the Federal Court, who refused the editors&#x27; application to appeal to the High Court of Australia. The charges were eventually dropped in March 1999.

==Canada==

Many student newspapers in Canada are independent from their universities and student unions. Such autonomous papers are funded by student fees won by referendums, as well as advertising, and are run by their staffs, with no faculty input.

About 55 of Canada&#x27;s student newspapers belong to a co-operative and newswire service called the Canadian University Press, which holds conferences, has correspondents across the country, is run democratically by its member papers, and fosters a sense of community among Canadian student journalists.

The oldest continually published student newspapers in Canada are &quot;The Varsity&quot; (1880), &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Journal&quot; (1873), and &quot;The Dalhousie Gazette&quot; (1868). The oldest student publication in Canada is &quot;The Brunswickan&quot;, which was founded in 1867 as a monthly but then switched to a weekly newspaper.

The only Canadian student newspaper that continues to print on a daily schedule is &quot;The Gazette&quot; at the University of Western Ontario.

==Ireland==
Student publications are produced at Ireland&#x27;s universities and Institutes of Technology as well as to a lesser extent at Colleges of Further Education. These publications include &quot;The College Tribune&quot; and &quot;The University Observer&quot; at University College Dublin, &quot;Trinity News&quot; and &quot;The University Times&quot; at Trinity College Dublin, &quot;The College View&quot; based at Dublin City University and &quot;Sin Newspaper&quot; at NUI Galway. Other publications include &quot;The Edition&quot; (stylised as the eDITion), at Dublin Institute of Technology and the &quot;UCC Express&quot; and &quot;Motley Magazine&quot; at University College Cork.

Each publication reports on affairs at its host university and on local, national and international news of relevance to students and many student journalists have gone on to work in Ireland&#x27;s national press. All student publications in Ireland are funded by or linked to their host university or its students&#x27; union, with the exception of UCD&#x27;s &quot;College Tribune&quot; which operates independently. Irish student publications are invited each year to enter the national Student Media Awards, run by a Dublin-based marketing firm &quot;Oxygen.ie&quot; under various categories.

==South Korea==
Almost every university in South Korea runs a student based press. Although many of these press are funded by the school, the students press has a significant amount of say amongst the student body.

==United Kingdom==

Student newspapers in the United Kingdom are often given a constitutionally guaranteed editorial independence from the universities and students&#x27; unions whose students they represent, although the majority are financially dependent on their students&#x27; union. Notable British student newspapers that are financially as well as editorially independent from their respective student unions are &quot;Cherwell&quot; (Oxford Student Publications Ltd), &quot;Varsity&quot; (Varsity Publications Ltd; Cambridge), &quot;The Tab&quot; (Tab Media Ltd; national) and &quot;The Gown&quot; (Queen&#x27;s University Belfast).

In 2003, &quot;The National Student&quot;, the UK&#x27;s first independent national student newspaper, was launched (closed 2019). &quot;Scotcampus&quot; a similar publication based in Scotland was founded in 2001 (closed 2016). In 2009, &quot;The Student Journals&quot; was founded as an independent online magazine for students, but started allowing international writers one year after launch (closed 2014).

==United States==

===Case law===
====&quot;Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District&quot;====

&quot;Tinker v. Des Moines&quot; concerns a group of students who wanted to wear black armbands to school in 1965 to protest United States involvement in Vietnam. After school officials heard about the planned silent protest, they suspended the students involved. A few of the students involved sued and the Supreme Court sided with the students, saying that provided that these speech acts did not distract themselves or others from academic work, the real purpose of the school, then students were free to wear and say want they liked in school. This is considered the benchmark case in issues of student free speech and contains the famous phrase &quot;students do not shed their constitutional rights at the schoolhouse gate.&quot;

====&quot;Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier&quot;====

&quot;Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier&quot;, heard by the United States Supreme Court in 1987 concerned a public school newspaper that attempted to print two controversial stories about issues of teen pregnancy and divorced families. It was the custom of the principal to look over the proposed paper before publication. With little time left before the publication deadline, the principal decided that the two stories, though names had been changed to protect the stories&#x27; subjects, were inappropriate for the paper&#x27;s younger readers; under direction of the principal, the paper was printed without the offending stories. The students filed suit, but the Supreme Court stood by the principal&#x27;s ruling, that, because of time constraints, the only proper course of action was to not print the stories. It was decided that the students&#x27; First Amendment rights had not been infringed. This case is often cited by high schools and universities to support the custom of prior review.

====&quot;Kincaid v. Gibson&quot;====

====Interaction of court rulings====
&quot;Hazelwood&quot; and &quot;Tinker&quot; offer conflicting versions of student free expression. Student-directed publications may indeed be considered open or limited public forums for student expression, offering students freedom of expression under both &quot;Hazelwood&quot; and &quot;Tinker&quot;.

&quot;Hazelwood&quot;, for example, does not say administrators must review or censor their papers before publication. In fact, journalism education organizations, like the Journalism Education Association, argue that prior review has no legitimate educational merit and is only a tool leading to censorship.

Under certain limited conditions and situations presented by &quot;Hazelwood&quot;, school administrators may be permitted prior review of (mostly high school) student publications.

Until June 2005, the &quot;Hazelwood&quot; standard was not considered to apply to public college and university newspapers, a decision most recently affirmed in the 2001 appeals court decision in &quot;Kincaid v. Gibson&quot;. However, in June 2005, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled, in &quot;Hosty v. Carter&quot;, that the &quot;Hazelwood&quot; standard could apply to student publications that were not &quot;designated public forums,&quot; and in February 2006 the Supreme Court declined to hear the students&#x27; appeal. At this time, the &quot;Hosty&quot; decision applies only in the states of Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin.

In response to the Kincaid decision, the California State Legislature passed AB 2581, which extended existing state-level statutory protection of high school student journalists to college and university students. The bill was signed into law by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and took effect on January 1, 2007.

Controversy over alleged censorship actions has led some student newspapers to become independent organizations, such as &quot;The Exponent&quot; of Purdue University in 1969, &quot;The Daily Californian&quot; of the University of California, Berkeley in 1971, &quot;The Daily Orange&quot; of Syracuse University in 1971, &quot;The Independent Florida Alligator&quot; of the University of Florida in 1973, &quot;The Cavalier Daily&quot; of the University of Virginia in 1979, &quot;The Paisano&quot; of the University of Texas at San Antonio in 1981, and most recently &quot;The Mountaineer Jeffersonian&quot; of West Virginia University in 2008.

Some states have laws which enhance the U.S. Constitution in protecting student expression documented by the Student Press Law Center.

====John Silber and university newspapers====

University administrations have learned to get around constitutional protections and effectively diminish critical student newspapers by following the example of former Boston University President John Silber, who on the advice of Harvard Law School Professor Alan Dershowitz, eliminated all funding for student newspapers in the 1970s in an attempt to suppress on-campus criticism. Silber&#x27;s policy went so far as to ban student organizations funded by the university from placing advertisements in the student press. With his hands-off policy, Silber was able to eliminate the independence of &quot;The Daily News&quot; and financially crippled the more-radical 
&quot;b.u. exposure&quot;. The &quot;exposure&quot; sued Silber and the university for infringement of their First Amendment rights, but the courts of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts eventually dismissed their case.

===Issues of diversity in student newspapers===
Studies by the &quot;Journal of Blacks in Higher Education&quot; (&quot;JBHE&quot;) focusing on African American students have found that as few as 2.6% of editors of all student newspapers are of African-American descent, with other minorities showing similar trending. These numbers are not much higher at schools with credited journalism schools. In these institutions, only 4.4% of editors are of African American descent. Both of these percentages are significantly below the percentage of population African-Americans make up in the total United States. Such skewed demographics in these publications could result in newspapers that only reflect the outlooks and values of a particular segment of the student population. The &quot;JBHE&quot; did not suggest any type of affirmative action program for student publications at the study&#x27;s release in 2004.

<doc id="1168965" wikidata="Q4842073" url="?curid=1168965" title="Bagoong">
<text>Bagoóng (; ) is a Philippine condiment partially or completely made of either fermented fish (bagoóng isdâ) or krill or shrimp paste (bagoóng alamáng) with salt. The fermentation process also produces fish sauce known as patís.

The preparation of bagoóng can vary regionally in the Philippines.

==Types==
Bagoóng is usually made from a variety of fish species, including the following:


*Anchovies - known as &quot;dilis&quot;, &quot;monamon&quot;, &quot;bolinaw&quot;, or &quot;gurayan&quot; (&quot;Stolephrus&quot; and &quot;Encrasicholina&quot; species)
*Round scads - known as &quot;galunggóng&quot; or &quot;tamodios&quot; (&quot;Decapterus&quot; species)
*Bonnetmouths (redbait or rubyfish) - known as &quot;terong&quot; (&quot;Emmelichthys nitidus&quot;, &quot;Emmelichthys struhsakeri&quot;, and &quot;Plagiogeneion rubiginosum&quot;) 
*Ponyfish - known as &quot;sapsáp&quot; (&quot;Leiognathus&quot;, &quot;Photopectoralis&quot;, and &quot;Equulites&quot; species)
*Rabbitfish - known as &quot;padas&quot; (&quot;Siganus&quot; species)
*Bar-eyed gobies - known as &quot;ipon&quot; (&quot;Glossogobius giuris&quot;)
*Herrings - known as &quot;lila&quot; (&quot;Clupeoides&quot;)
*Silver perch - known as &quot;ayungin&quot; (&quot;Leiopotherapon plumbeus&quot;)

Bagoóng made from fish is encompassed by the term &quot;bagoóng isdâ&quot; (lit. &quot;fish bagoong&quot;) in Luzon and northern parts of the Visayas. They can be distinguished further by the type of fish they are made of. Those made from anchovies are generally known as &quot;bagoong monamon&quot; or &quot;bagoong dilis&quot; and those from bonnetmouths as &quot;bagoong terong&quot;. 

In the southern Visayas and Mindanao, fish bagoong made from anchovies is known as &quot;guinamos&quot; (also spelled &quot;ginamos&quot;). Larger fermented fish are known as &quot;tinabal&quot;.

Bagoong can also be made from krill. This type of bagoong is known as &quot;bagoong alamang&quot;. It is called &quot;uyap&quot; or &quot;alamang&quot; in the southern Philippines, &quot;aramang&quot; in Ilocos and parts of Northern Luzon, and &quot;ginamos&quot; or &quot;dayok&quot; in western Visayas.

In rarer instances, it can also be made from oysters, clams, and fish and shrimp roe. A kind of bagoong made in the town of Balayan, Batangas is also known as &quot;bagoong Balayan&quot;.

Vegan Bagoong Alamang is a type of fermented Philippine condiments abstaining from animal product. Instead, squash, morinaga and other vegetables are used.

==Preparation==
===&quot;Bagoong isda&quot; and &quot;bagoong alamang&quot;===
&quot;Bagoong isda&quot; is prepared by mixing salt and fish usually by volume; mixture proportions are proprietary depending on the manufacturer. The salt and fish are mixed uniformly, usually by hand. The mixture is kept inside large earthen fermentation jars (known as &quot;tapayan&quot; in Tagalog and Visayan languages, and &quot;burnay&quot; in Ilocano). It is covered, to keep insects away, and left to ferment for 30–90 days with occasional stirring to make sure the salt is spread evenly. The mixture can expand significantly during the process.

The preparation of &quot;bagoong alamang&quot; (shrimp or krill paste) is similar, with krill cleaned thoroughly and washed in weak brine solution (10%). As in fish bagoong, the shrimp are then mixed with salt in a 25% salt to 75% shrimp ratio by weight.

The products of the fermentation process are usually pale gray to white in color. To obtain the characteristic red or pink color of some bagoong, a kind of food coloring known as &quot;angkak&quot; is added. &quot;Angkak&quot; is made from rice inoculated with a species of red mold (&quot;Monascus purpureus&quot;). High-quality salt with little mineral impurities is preferred. High metallic content in the salt used can often result in darker colors to the resulting bagoong and a less agreeable undertaste. Likewise, oversalting and undersalting also has a significant impact on the rate and quality of fermentation due to their effects on the bacteria involved in the process. Some manufacturers grind the fermented product finely and sell the resulting mixture as fish paste.
===&quot;Patís&quot;===
&quot;Patís&quot; or fish sauce is a byproduct of the fermentation process. It is a clear, yellowish liquid that floats above the fermented mixture, and has a sharp salty or cheese-like flavor. Sauces similar to patís include &quot;nước mắm&quot; in Vietnam, &quot;nam pha&quot; (ນ້ຳປາ) in Laos, &quot;hom ha&quot; in China, &quot;nam pla&quot; in Thailand, &quot;shottsuru&quot; in Japan and &quot;saeu chot&quot; in Korea, as well as the garum of ancient Greece and the Roman Empire. Indonesia has an East Javanese condiment called &quot;petis&quot; (pronounced similar to patís in Filipino): a paste made from the caramelized fermented reduction of &quot;pindang&quot; broth, a spicy and tangy herbal soup typically containing fish or shrimp (occasionally, beef or eggs).

To obtain patís, fermentation is longer, usually taking six months to a year. During the longer fermentation processes, the fish or shrimp constituents disintegrate further, producing a clear yellowish liquid on top of the mixture due to hydrolysis. This is the patis; it can be harvested once it has developed its characteristic smell. It is drained, pasteurized, and bottled separately, while the residue is turned into bagoong. If the residual solids are not moist enough, brine is usually added. The rate of fermentation can vary depending on the pH levels of the mixture and the temperature. Exposure to sunlight can also reduce the amount of time required to two months.

== Reputation ==
Over the centuries, people unfamiliar with bagoong have given it a reputation as an &quot;exotic&quot; dish, portraying in a positive or negative light, depending on the point of view of the writer. For example, one early description was Spanish colonial official Antonio de Morga, whose book &quot;Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas&quot; (Events in the Philippine Isles) included a description of bagoong as &quot;fish which ... has started to rot and stink.&quot; This later prompted preeminent Philippine nationalist Jose Rizal to denounce the descriptions in his 1890 annotation, saying:

<text>Isabel Buarque de Hollanda Gilberto de Oliveira (born May 12, 1966), known as Bebel Gilberto, is an American-born Brazilian popular singer often associated with bossa nova. She is the daughter of João Gilberto and singer Miúcha. Her uncle is singer/composer Chico Buarque.

==Early life==
Gilberto was born in New York City to Brazilian parents, bossa nova pioneer João Gilberto and singer Miúcha, who were briefly living in the city at the time of her birth. She often traveled with her father when he recorded albums in different countries; she lived in Mexico at age three and moved to Rio de Janeiro at age five. Gilberto&#x27;s parents separated when she was seven, and she spent her time between Rio de Janeiro with her mother and New York with her father. Gilberto has been performing since her youth in Rio de Janeiro.

Gilberto recalls that her childhood was &quot;music nonstop&quot;; when reflecting on her father&#x27;s influence, Gilberto states, &quot;He taught me to be a perfectionist. But my mother taught me how to lose it. And you can hear it in my music today, I think.&quot; She grew acquainted with popular artists such as Caetano Veloso, David Byrne, and Stan Getz, who often visited her father&#x27;s home to collaborate. She began singing with her mother at a young age and participated in professional musicals such as &quot;Saltimbancos&quot; and &quot;Pirlimpimpim&quot;. At the age of seven, she made her recording debut on her mother&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Miúcha &amp; Antônio Carlos Jobim&quot; (1977). Two years later, she performed at Carnegie Hall with her mother and Stan Getz.

==Career==
===Beginnings: 1986–1999===
Gilberto&#x27;s professional solo debut came in 1986 with a self-titled EP released by WEA which included &quot;Preciso dizer que te amo&quot;, a partnership with Cazuza and Dé Palmeira, when both were in the Barão Vermelho band. In 1991, Gilberto moved to Manhattan, where she continues to live, but shares her time between the U.S. and Brazil.

Gilberto was a great friend of Cazuza and composed several songs with him in addition to &quot;Eu preciso dizer que te amo&quot;, including &quot;Amigos de Bar&quot;, &quot;Mais Feliz&quot;, and &quot;Mulher sem Razão&quot;.

Gilberto next participated in the project Red Hot + Rio, joining major music stars such as Everything but the Girl, Maxwell, George Michael, and others for the benefit CD recording. She also collaborated on Towa Tei&#x27;s CD &quot;Future Listening!&quot;, singing on the hits &quot;Technova&quot; and &quot;Batucada,&quot; and also participated in Peeping Tom with Mike Patton (lead singer of Faith No More), singing &quot;Caipirinha&quot;.

===&quot;Tanto Tempo&quot;, &quot;Bebel Gilberto&quot;, and &quot;Momento&quot;: 2000–2007===
&quot;Tanto Tempo&quot;, an electronic bossa nova album released in 2000, was popular at clubs around the world and positioned Gilberto as one of the best-selling Brazilian artists in the U.S. since the 1960s. With her second album, &quot;Bebel Gilberto&quot; (2004), she refined her sound to create an acoustic lounge style that showcased her strengths as a Brazilian composer.

With &quot;Momento&quot; (2007), her third album in seven years, she wanted to do a fusion of both. Mixing the taste of Rio&#x27;s Orquestra Imperial with the melting pot of New York&#x27;s Brazilian Girls, and following the direction of the English producer Guy Sigsworth (Madonna&#x27;s partner in &quot;What It Feels Like for a Girl&quot;), &quot;Momento&quot; reaffirmed the international character of Gilberto&#x27;s music. In 2007, she was a judge for the 6th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists&#x27; careers.

===&quot;All in One&quot;: 2009–present===
Gilberto recorded her fourth studio album, &quot;All in One&quot;, in New York, Jamaica, and the Brazilian state of Bahia. It was released worldwide on September 29, 2009, on the American jazz label Verve, and was released in Brazil by Universal Music. It is the least electronic-infused of her albums, and brings to the forefront more of Gilberto&#x27;s personality and love for organic styles. &quot;All in One&quot; had a team of accomplished producers including Mark Ronson (Amy Winehouse, Lily Allen), John King (Dust Brothers, Beck), Daniel Jobim, Carlinhos Brown, Didi Gutman (Brazilian Girls) and Mario Caldato Jr (Beastie Boys, Björk, Jack Johnson). Gilberto also provided the voice of the bird Eva in the animated film &quot;Rio&quot; (2011), an experience she called &quot;amazing&quot;.

Since the launch of &quot;Tanto Tempo&quot; in 2000, she has sold over 2.5 million records and has been featured on seven film soundtracks including &quot;Next Stop Wonderland&quot;, &quot;The Bubble&quot;, &quot;Closer&quot; and most recently 2010s &quot;Eat Pray Love&quot; and 2011&#x27;s &quot;Rio&quot;; and seven TV series including &quot;Sex and the City&quot;, &quot;Six Feet Under&quot;, and &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot;.

In 2011, she contributed a cover of &quot;Acabou Chorare&quot; to the Red Hot Organization&#x27;s most recent charitable album, &quot;Red Hot+Rio 2&quot;. The album is a follow-up to the 1996 &quot;Red Hot+Rio&quot;. Proceeds from the sales will be donated to raise awareness and money to fight AIDS/HIV and related health and social issues. In 2015, her song &quot;Tudo&quot; was nominated for the 16th Latin Grammy Awards in the Best Brazilian Song category.

<text>A shawl (from &quot;shāl&quot;) is a simple item of clothing, loosely worn over the shoulders, upper body and arms, and sometimes also over the head. It is usually a rectangular piece of cloth, but can also be square or triangular in shape. Other shapes include oblong shawls. 

==History==
Kashmir was a pivotal point in the history of the shawl, serving as the birthplace of one of the most coveted garments in the world. Perhaps the most widely known woven textiles are the famed Kashmir shawls. The &quot;Kanikar&quot;, for instance, has intricately woven designs that are formalized imitations of nature. The &quot;Chinar&quot; leaf (plane tree leaf), &quot;apple and cherry blossoms&quot;, the &quot;rose and tulip&quot;, the &quot;almond and pear&quot;, the &quot;nightingale&quot;—these are done in deep mellow tones of maroon, dark red, gold yellow and browns. Yet another type of Kashmir shawl is the &quot;Jamia Vr&quot;, which is a brocaded woollen fabric sometimes in pure wool and sometimes with a little cotton added.

The floral design appears in a heavy, close embroidery-like weave in dull silk or soft &quot;pashmina&quot; (Persian, meaning &quot;woolen&quot;), and usually comprises small or large flowers delicately sprayed and combined; some shawls have net-like patterns with floral ensemble motifs in them. Still another type of Kashmir shawl is the double-sided &quot;Dourukha&quot; (Persian, meaning &quot;having two faces&quot;), a woven shawl that is so done as to produce the same effect on both sides. This is a unique piece of craftsmanship, in which a multi-coloured schematic pattern is woven all over the surface, and after the shawl is completed, the &quot;rafugar&quot; (expert embroiderer) works the outlines of the motifs in darker shades to bring into relief the beauty of design. This mode of craftsmanship not only produces a shawl which is reversible because of the perfect workmanship on both sides, but it combines the crafts of both weaving and embroidery and religious beliefs expressed in different shawls.

The most expensive shawls, called shahtoosh, are made from the under-fleece of the Tibetan antelope or Chiru. These shawls are so fine that even a very tightly woven shawl can be easily pulled through a small finger ring.

The &quot;naksha&quot;, a Persian device like the Jacquard loom invented centuries later, enabled Indian weavers to create sinuous floral patterns and creeper designs in brocade to rival any painted by a brush. The Kashmir shawl that evolved from this expertise in its heyday had greater fame than any other Indian textile. Always a luxury commodity, the intricate, tapestry-woven, fine wool shawl had become a fashionable wrap for the ladies of the English and French elite by the 18th century. Supply fell short of demand and manufacturers pressed to produce more, created convincing embroidered versions of the woven shawls that could be produced in half the time. As early as 1803, Kashmiri needlework production was established to increase and hasten output of these shawls, which had been imitated in England since 1784 and even in France. By 1870, the advent of the &quot;Jacquard&quot; loom in Europe destroyed the exclusivity of the original Kashmir shawl, which began to be produced in Paisley, Scotland. Even the characteristic Kashmiri motif, the &quot;mango-shape&quot;, began to be known simply as the &quot;paisley&quot;.

The paisley motif is so ubiquitous to Indian fabrics that it is hard to realize that it is only about 250 years old. It evolved from 1600s floral and tree-of-life designs that were created in expensive, tapestry-woven Mughal textiles. The design in India originated from Persian motif called &quot;butta-jeghgha&quot; which represents a stylized cypress tree, the symbol of Iranians. Early designs depicted single plants with large flowers and thin wavy stems, small leaves and roots. As the designs became denser over time, more flowers and leaves were compacted within the shape of the tree, or issuing from vases or a pair of leaves. By the late 18th century, the archetypal curved point at the top of an elliptical outline had evolved. The elaborate paisley created on Kashmir shawls became the vogue in Europe for over a century, and it was imitations of these shawls woven in factories at Paisley, Scotland, that gave it the name &quot;paisley&quot; still commonly used in the United States and Europe. In the late 18th century and 19th century, the paisley became an important motif in a wide range of Indian textiles, perhaps because it was associated with the Mughal court. It also caught the attention of poorer and non-Muslim Indians because it resembles a mango. The Kashmir shawl is an evergreen shawl all over India and the wider world. &quot;Rural Indians called an &quot;aam&quot; or mango a symbol of fertility&quot;.

Shawls were also part of the traditional male costume in Kashmir. They were woven in extremely fine woollen twill, some such as the Orenburg shawl, were even said to be as fine as the Shatoosh. They could be in one colour only, woven in different colours (called &quot;tilikar&quot;), ornately woven or embroidered (called &quot;ameli&quot;).

Kashmiri shawls were high-fashion garments in Western Europe in the early- to mid-19th century. Shawls in the Indian style were manufactured in the city of Norwich, Norfolk from the late 18th century. The &quot;Norwich shawl&quot; was produced by hand weavers using silk and worsted and supplied the high end of the market. Paisley shawls, imitation Kashmiri shawls woven in Paisley, Renfrewshire, are the origin of the name of the traditional paisley pattern. Decline in market for expensive shawls, due to changes in fashion and the mass market competition from industrial production led to the ending of Norwich shawl making in the 1870s.

Silk shawls with fringes, made in China, were available by the first decade of the 19th century. Ones with embroidery and fringes were available in Europe and the Americas by 1820. These were called &quot;China crêpe shawls&quot; or &quot;China shawls&quot;, and in Spain &quot;mantones de Manila&quot; because they were shipped to Spain from China via the port of Manila. The importance of these shawls in fashionable women&#x27;s wardrobes declined between 1865 and 1870 in Western culture. However, they became part of folk dress in a number of places including Germany, the Near East, various parts of Latin America, and Spain where they became a part of Romani (&quot;gitana&quot;) dress especially in Andalusia and Madrid. These embroidered items were revived in the 1920s under the name of Spanish shawls. Their use as part of the costume of the lead in the opera &quot;Carmen&quot; contributed to the association of the shawls with Spain rather than China.

Some cultures incorporate shawls of various types into their national folk dress, mainly because the relatively unstructured shawls were much more commonly used in earlier times.

==Usage==

Shawls are used in order to keep warm, to complement a costume, and for symbolic reasons. One famous type of shawl is the tallit, worn by Jewish men during prayers and ceremonies. In Christianity, women have used shawls as a headcovering. In addition to these aforementioned religious uses of shawls, they are worn for added warmth (and fashion) at outdoor or indoor evening affairs, where the temperature is warm enough for men in suits, but not for women in dresses and where a jacket might be inappropriate.

==Types==
===The Kashmir shawls===
The Kashmir shawl is a type of shawl distinctive for its Kashmiri weave, and traditionally made of &quot;shahtoosh&quot; or &quot;pashmina&quot; wool. Known for its warmth, light weight and characteristic buta design, the Kashmir shawl was originally used by Mughal royalty and nobility. In the late 18th century, it arrived in Europe, where its use by Queen Victoria and Empress Joséphine popularised it as a symbol of exotic luxury and status. It became a toponym for the Kashmir region itself (as cashmere), inspiring mass-produced imitation industries in India and Europe, and popularising the buta, today known as the Paisley motif. 

&quot;The shawls made in Kashmir occupy a pre-eminent place among textile products; and it is to them and to their imitations from Western looms that specific importance attaches. The Kashmir shawl is characterized by the elaboration of its design, in which the &quot;cone&quot; pattern is a prominent feature, and by the glowing harmony, brilliance, depth, and enduring qualities of its colours. The basis of these excellences is found in the very fine, soft, short, flossy under-wool, called pashm or pashmina, found on the shawl-goat, a variety of &quot;Capra hircus&quot; inhabiting the elevated regions of Tibet. There are several varieties of pashm, but the finest is a strict monopoly of the maharaja of Kashmir. Inferior pashm and Kerman wool — a fine soft Persian sheep&#x27;s wool — are used for shawl weaving at Amritsar and other places in the Punjab, where colonies of Kashmiri weavers are established. Of shawls, apart from shape and pattern, there are only two principal classes: (1) loom-woven shawls called tiliwalla, tilikar or kani kar — sometimes woven in one piece, but more often in small segments which are sewn together with such precision that the sewing is quite imperceptible; and (2) embroidered shawls — amlikar — in which over a ground of plain pashmina is worked by needle a minute and elaborate pattern.&quot; from &quot;Encyclopaedia Britannica&quot;, 1911 

===Pashmina or kar Amir===
The majority of the woollen fabrics of Kashmir, and particularly the best quality shawls, were and are still made of &quot;Pashm&quot; or &quot;Pashmina&quot;, which is the wool of &quot;Capra hircus&quot;, a species of the wild Asian mountain goat. Hence the shawls came to be called Pashmina. The fine fleece used for the shawls is that which grows under the rough, woolly, outer coat of the animal; that from the under-belly, which is shed on the approach of hot weather. Materials of an inferior grade were of the wool of the wild Himalayan mountain sheep or the Himalayan ibex. However, the best fleece wool is soft, silky and warm is of the wild goats, and painstakingly gathered from shrubs and rough rocks against which the animals rub off their fleece on the approach of summer. This was undoubtedly the soft fleece wool from which were made the famous and much coveted &#x27;ring shawls&#x27; in Mughal times. Unfortunately very inferior and second rate wool taken from domesticated sheep and goats provide most of the wool used today on the looms of Kashmir.

The needle-worked &quot;Amlikar&quot; or &quot;Amli&quot;, made from Pashmina wool is a shawl embroidered almost all over with the needle on a plain woven ground. The colours most commonly seen on pashmina shawls are yellow, white, black, blue, green, purple, crimson and scarlet. The design motifs are usually formalised imitations of nature like the leaf, flower and tree designs mentioned above; they are always done in rich colours.

The embroidery stitch employed is rather like the parallel darning stitch and is rarely allowed to penetrate the entire fabric.

The outlines of the design are further touched up and emphasized with silk or woollen thread of different colours run round the finer details; the stitch used for this is at an angle overlapping darn stitch, all the stitches used are so minute and fine that individually they can be seen with the unaided eye only with difficulty. When Pashmina wool is used for the embroidery work, it is made to blend so intimately with the texture of the basic shawl material that it would be difficult to insert even a fine needle between the embroidery stitches and the basic fabric.

===Do-Shalla===
The Emperor Akbar was a great admirer of the shawls of Kashmir. It was he who began the fashion of wearing them in duplicate, sewn back to back, so that the under surfaces of the shawls were never seen. During that time the most desired shawls were those worked in gold and silver thread or shawls with border ornamented with fringes of gold, silver and silk thread.

The &quot;Do-shala&quot;, as the name designates (&quot;two-shawl&quot;), are always sold in pairs, there being many varieties of them. In the &quot;Khali-matan&quot; the central field is quite plain and without any ornamentation. The &quot;Char-bagan&quot; is made up of four pieces in different colours neatly joined together; the central fluid of the shawl is embellished with a medallion of flowers. However, when the field is ornamented with flowers in the four corners we have the Kunj.

Perhaps the most characteristic of the Kashmir shawls is the one made like patchwork. The patterns are woven on the looms in long strips, about twelve to eighteen inches in length and from one half to two inches in width. These design strips, made on very simple and primitive looms, are then cut to the required lengths and very neatly and expertly hand sewn together with almost invisible stitches and finally joined by sewing to a plain central field piece. As a variation, pieces may be separately woven, cut up in various shapes of differing sizes and expertly sewn together and then further elaborated with embroidery. But there is a difference between these two types: while the patchwork loom shawls are made up from separate narrow strips, the patchwork embroidered shawls consists of a certain number of irregularly shaped pieces joined together, each one balancing the predominant colour scheme of the shawl.

===Namda and Gabba===
The basic material for a &quot;gubba&quot; is milled blanket dyed in plain colour. Embroidery is bold and vivid in designing and done with woollen or cotton threads. Gubbas have more of a folk flavour blankets cut and patched into geometric patterns, with limited, embroidery on joining and open space. It is more like appliqué work. Colours are bright and attractive. They are cheap and used for &quot;dewan&quot; covering or as floor covering—&quot;namdas&quot;.

===Knit shawls===
Triangular knit lace shawls are usually knitted from the neck down, and may or may not be shaped. In contrast, Faroese lace shawls are knitted bottom up and contain a centre back gusset. Each shawl consists of two triangular side panels, a trapezoid-shaped back gusset, an edge treatment, and usually also shoulder shaping.

=== Shalli ===
Shalli is a handwoven twill weaved shawl made of angora goat hairs.

===Stole===
A stole is a woman&#x27;s shawl, especially a formal shawl of expensive fabric, used around the shoulders over a party dress or ball gown. A stole is narrower than a typical shawl and of simpler construction than a cape; it is a length of a quality material, wrapped and carried about the shoulders or arms. Lighter materials such as silk and chiffon are simply &quot;finished&quot;, that is, cropped, hemmed, and bound; heavier materials such as fur and brocade are often lined as well. There are different types of stoles including Academic Stoles, Honor Stoles, Graduation Stoles and custom stoles.

A stole can also be a fur or set of furs, usually fox, worn as a stole with a suit or gown; the pelage or skin, of a single animal (head included) is generally used with street dress while for formal wear a finished length of fur using the skins of more than one animal is used; the word stole stands alone or is used in combination: &quot;fur stole&quot;, &quot;mink stole&quot;, the namesake of Dreamlander Mink Stole.

<doc id="1168996" wikidata="Q315782" url="?curid=1168996" title="Zero hour (1945)">
<text>Zero hour (, ) is a term referring to the capitulation at midnight on 8 May 1945 and the immediately following weeks in Germany. It marked the end of World War II in Europe and the start of a new, non-Nazi Germany. It was partly an attempt by Germany to dissociate itself from the Nazis. Denazification was encouraged by the Allies occupying Germany.

According to some historians, the term implies &quot;an absolute break with the past and a radical new beginning&quot; or a &quot;sweeping away of old traditions and customs&quot;. People at the time were living in a devastated country – roughly 80 percent of its infrastructure was in need of repair or reconstruction – which helped the idea that Germany was entering a new phase of history.

== History of the term ==
The term was first used in World War I, and it was used to say &quot;a time at which some great military action has to take place&quot;. The term &#x27;zero hour&#x27; appears in various sources throughout post-World War I history. It is mostly used in terms of a militaristic concept (as it was when it was first coined), Richard Freund (a journalist) used the term as a call to war, he talks of Hitler&#x27;s occupation of the Rhineland, and the Spanish Civil War pushing the world to the edge, and, then he says &quot;The next flash may be the signal. It is Zero Hour&quot;. Not only was it used in militaristic terms, it also suggests a call to action, Erika Mann says &quot;And one man should be forbidden to entreat you: &#x27;Act! This is your hour, it&#x27;s the final hour – the Zero Hour!&quot; she calls the American people to action (also during WWII). The term was used to illustrate the need for America to act in World War II, and to show the urgency for an American military intervention. Both were used in militaristic settings, displaying urgency to their respective audiences, to the need to intervene and help stop the German advances. It was not until the post-war period that the term was used to refer to the &quot;new beginning&quot; of Germany.

== Allied occupation of Germany ==

During the post-war period Germany was split up into four zones controlled by the Soviet Union, the United States of America, France, and the United Kingdom. A main cultural impact of this occupation was the denazification process that each of the occupying powers put in place. The main plan to accomplish this was through &#x27;re-education&#x27;, without the German people noticing the shift. This was done, because for the most part (at least on the Allies&#x27; side) the new political culture was not supposed to be imposed on Germany, for fears of the Germans rejecting these ideas if they felt they were being reeducated, but the Allies also wanted to make sure that there would not be another Nazi-like regime.

The Americans used techniques developed in psychiatry during the 1930s to de-Nazify West Germany. The concept of re-education then was developed originally to change people who had severe delusionary disorders, but it was redone to try and change the German culture at the time. To do this, sociologists, anthropologists, and psychologists studied the differences between democratic and totalitarian societies, to try and find a way to make passing democratic values and traditions to the German people more effective. They encouraged a focus on human values, in favor of &#x27;super human values&#x27;, that is to say a change from focusing on the state, to instead focusing on individuals. Kurt Lewin suggested that the German people should be given training on how to organize themselves in democratic society, and that this should be done as subtly as possibly, to avoid the German people rejecting democratic ideas. In practice, this meant roughly ten policies that the U.S would enact. First &#x27;white lists&#x27;, or lists of anti-Nazis who would be entrusted with political, educational, and other positions. Second a screening process was put in to regulate who could become newspaper editors and run publishing houses. Next new political parties were allowed to form in small towns for elections. German prisoners of war were &#x27;re-educated&#x27;. Information centers were made to let Germans learn about how democracy was going to work. Exchange programs were put in place to let German people see the United States for themselves. Trade unions were formed. Denazification was started, which tried former Nazis for crimes they committed during the Nazi regime. Finally, &quot;gewerbefreiheit&quot; was put in place, which allowed Germans the freedom to practice a trade, gave freedom of economic activity.

However, the Allied occupation did not go entirely as planned, one of the integration processes was to show the German people how race functioned in modern society, so there would not be a repeat of the hyper racialized society created by Nazi Germany. But this message of tolerance was possibly lost in this, because of how America at the time was dealing with race. The American military was segregated up to 1948, and from those that were trying to teach the German people tolerance this demonstrated that intolerance still existed in American democratic society.

== The situation in Berlin ==

When the Soviets (who were the first occupying power) arrived in Berlin, they saw a city devastated by the air raids and street fighting. It was described as a &quot;Geisterstadt&quot; (&quot;ghost town&quot;).

===Extent of the devastation===
* 48,000 of the 245,000 buildings in Berlin were destroyed.
* One third of all private apartments were totally destroyed.
* 23% of industrial capacity was obliterated and the rest was dismantled for transportation by the Russians in the &quot;demontage&quot; (disassembly).
* There were 75 million tons of rubble, which equated to th of all the rubble in Germany.
* All electricity, gas and water supplies were destroyed:
** It was forbidden to wash one&#x27;s whole body.
* The transport network was badly destroyed:
** The underground stations had been flooded and over 90 of them had been bombed.
** The first buses resumed service on May 19.
* 78,000 deaths:
** 50,000 victims of the air raids.
** 977 suicides.
* A further 4,000 died daily in August 1945 (an additional 120,400), because of the cholera and diphtheria epidemics.
* The population shrank and the demographics were significantly altered:
** 4.3 million lived in Berlin before the war (number never more equalized since then), but only 2.8 million afterwards.
** One quarter of the population were over 60.
** 1 in 10 was under 30.
** There were 16 women to every 10 men.

===&quot;Das Aufräumen&quot; (&quot;The clean-up&quot;)===
The job of cleaning up the city fell to the Soviets, as they were first (the Western Allies arrived on July 4, 1945) to enter the city. According to them, the clean-up operation would last 12 years.

On May 29, all women aged between 15 and 65 were conscripted as &quot;Trümmerfrauen&quot; (rubble women). In all, 60,000 women worked to rebuild Berlin.

===Rations and starvation===
The biggest problem that the Berliners had to face was the threat of starvation. German war-time ration cards were no longer valid. Any remaining rations were either used to feed Russian troops or stolen by hungry Germans.

On May 15, the Russians introduced a new five-tier ration-card system: The highest tier was reserved for intellectuals and artists; rubble women and &quot;Schwerarbeiter&quot; (manual workers) received the second-tier card, which was more valuable to them than the 12 Reichsmark they received for cleaning up a thousand bricks; the lowest card, nicknamed the &quot;Friedhofskarte&quot; (cemetery ticket) was issued to housewives and the elderly.

During this period, the average Berliner was around underweight.

====Alternative sources of food====
Due to the meagre rations, the black market thrived, and thousands traded on it daily. Payment was either in cigarettes or by bartering. The word &quot;fringsen&quot; entered the German vocabulary during 1945, meaning to steal to survive. This word is etymologically based on the surname of Cardinal Josef Frings, a senior figure in the Catholic Church of Cologne, who (in accordance with long-standing Catholic tradition) famously gave his blessing to those who had to steal in order to feed their family.

====&quot;Der Elendswinter&quot; (&quot;The miserable winter&quot;, 1945–46)====
The winter of 1945–46 was one of the coldest winters in Berlin. Temperatures plummeted to and there was no protection from the biting cold in the bombed-out houses. About 40,000 people suffered from hypothermia and 1,000 died as a result. The Berlin &quot;Magistrat&quot; (municipal authority) created official &quot;Wärmeräume&quot; (warm rooms) for people to warm themselves in.

===Crime===
In 1946, Berlin was a haven of crime. There were an average of 240 robberies and five murders a day, and most criminals were the destitute and homeless in Berlin. Western Allied soldiers sometimes harassed German civilians too. Problems with law and order occurred in the areas that had still been controlled by the Wehrmacht on May 8, 1945 (e.g. western Austria, Bavaria, South Tyrol (Italy), East Frisia and Schleswig-Holstein), the date of the final German surrender.

== Reconstruction and &quot;Stunde Null&quot; ==
Also at the time of &quot;Stunde Null&quot;, Germany lay in ruins after the destruction wrought by World War II. Following the war was a period of massive scale reconstruction. With roughly eighty percent of the country&#x27;s infrastructure now in need of repair the German people saw an opportunity to reconstruct an old infrastructure into something more modern. They traded the condensed busy interiors of cities for newer, more expansive boulevards, opting to expand outward, creating more space to live in, rather than continuing the trend of condensing as they had done before. However, this project of reconstruction was and is still so great that the process of implementing the changes is not yet complete.

== Culture at the time of &quot;Stunde Null&quot; ==
Germany at the time of &quot;Stunde Null&quot; was certainly very different from its former pre-war self. After the Allies had finished the war, and the concentration camps and the inhuman practices of the Nazis were revealed to the world, Germany was put into a difficult public relations position (people like Thomas Mann saying things such as &quot;Humanity shudders in horror at Germany!&quot; (published in a Munich newspaper named &quot;Bayerische Landeszeitung&quot;)). The severity of Germany&#x27;s crimes was almost universally recognized by the world, including Germany itself, so a culture of trying to escape that past was created. This spurred the idea that 1945 was not only an end, but a beginning too. This thought process began to appear more and more in German culture and speech, with people like Ernst Wiechert talking about making new beginnings in his 1945 address to Germany, talking of &quot;a renewal of German spiritual life&quot;, or Werner Richter saying &quot;The only possible source for a spiritual rebirth lies in an absolute and radical new beginning&quot;. But there were those that did not think that there would be a possibility for Germany to escape its Nazi past. As Karl Becker said &quot;the German people will have lost all right to say that the German people is [are] not Hitler.&quot; This is what really created the culture that sought to wash away the wrongs of the predecessors, they wanted the respect and admiration on the world stage once again, and to do that they needed to distance themselves from this idea of Hitler and the Nazi party.

The idea of &quot;Stunde Null&quot; was even in the politics at the end of the war. British diplomat Robert Gilbert Vansittart wanted to offer German &quot;barren nothingness&quot;, an &quot;empty space in which they [Germans] must fill in with their own ideas if they have any.&quot; Even some of the diplomats negotiating with Germany seemed to want to honor the idea of &quot;Stunde Null&quot;, further propagating the culture of new beginnings instead of endings.

As a result of this new way of thinking, Germany entered into a new period of political rhetoric. A &quot;race-less&quot; Germany was created, Germany began to disconnect itself from its racialist past in favor of one that seemed to ignore the question in general. To a large extent, even scholars started to ignore questions about race, treating the end of World War II as if it solved all of these issues. But race was still very much an issue in the post-war period in Germany. Germany offered their quick acceptance of democratic ideals and customs as proof of their supposed &#x27;race less&#x27; culture, but these same ideals were reintroducing racialization to Germany.

To most in Germany racialization was still a large problem in the post-war period. For instance, many East European Jewish Holocaust survivors who resided in post-war displaced persons camps were considered &quot;parasitic foreigners&quot; who were stealing resources from the German people in need of them. Germany during reconstruction also looked toward the occupying powers for guidance in regards to these matters, but what they saw was segregationist U.S. military policies. But there was also those who sought to remember Germany&#x27;s past.

For all the talk of new beginnings there was a movement to remember the past, and cope. This was called &quot;Vergangenheitsbewältigung&quot; (coping with the past), though not much of the politics of the time was shaped by this there were many people did not want Germany to simply forget the crimes it had committed during World War II.

== Controversy ==

In 1985, Richard von Weizsäcker, the President of West Germany at that time, stated &quot;There was no &#x27;Stunde Null&#x27; but we had the chance for a new beginning&quot; (&quot;Es gab keine &quot;Stunde Null&quot;, aber wir hatten die Chance zu einem Neubeginn.&quot;), implying that a true and total restart never occurred in postwar Germany. The term &quot;Stunde null&quot; implies that the past is over and nothing from former times continues to exist past the &quot;Stunde Null&quot;. Experts in German culture find that this term is divisive and is a barrier to the collective German psyche and their ability to deal with the recent past. The concept of &quot;Vergangenheitsbewältigung&quot; (coping with the past) is what experts allude to and &quot;Stunde null&quot; conflicts directly with this idea, necessitating its judicious use.

== Use in music ==
* An EP released in 1995 by German techno artist Cosmic Baby was entitled &quot;Stunde Null&quot;.
* The English band British Sea Power entitled the fourth track from their 2011 LP &quot;Valhalla Dancehall&quot; &quot;Stunde Null&quot;.
* The German gothic metal band Eisheilig released a track named &quot;Die Stunde Null&quot; on their 2009 album &quot;Imperium&quot;.

== Use in cinema ==
* The 1948 neorealist film &quot;Germany, Year Zero&quot; by Roberto Rossellini depicts life in Berlin in the year after its near total destruction in World War II.

<doc id="1169004" wikidata="Q2708216" url="?curid=1169004" title="Tallapragada Subba Row">
<text>Tallapragada Subba Row (July 6, 1856 – June 24, 1890) was a Theosophist from a Hindu background and originally worked as a Vakil (Pleader) within the Indian justice system. His primary instructors in this field were Messrs. Grant and Laing, who saw to his establishment as a Vakil, a profession which became highly profitable for the time that he held it.

However, Subba Row&#x27;s interest in the law paled when compared to the way he devoured philosophy, especially after an event in which he met two particular individuals. In 1882, he invited Helena Petrovna Blavatsky and Henry Steel Olcott to Madras (now Chennai), where he convinced them to make Adyar the permanent headquarters for the Theosophical Society. Prior to this meeting however, Subba Row was not known for any esoteric or mystical knowledge, even by his closest friends and parents . It was only after meeting the pair that he began to expound on metaphysics, astounding most of those who knew him.

Upon this meeting and thereafter, Subba Row became able to recite whatever passage was so requested of him from the Bhagavad Gita, Upanishads, and many other sacred texts of India. He had, apparently, never studied these things prior to the fateful meeting, and it is stated that when meeting Blavatsky and Damodar K. Mavalankar, all knowledge from his previous lives came flooding back.

== Theosophy in Adyar ==
Subba Row had initial problems with instructing non-Hindus. It was his distinct belief at the time that Hindu knowledge should remain with India, and not be extended to foreigners. In fact, even after passing over this hurdle, he was still especially private regarding his spiritual life, even to his mother and close friends. Unless the person he was speaking to had a deep understanding of mysticism, it was a fairly mute topic for him.

For many years then, Subba Row was instrumental in establishing Theosophy in India, and continued to work hard until the first draft of the Secret Doctrine was given to him. It was his initial compulsion to edit the manuscript when it had been proposed, but upon reading it, he utterly and completely refused to have anything to do with it. It was his opinion that the work contained so many mistakes that he might as well be writing a completely new book were he to edit it.

== Decline ==
In 1888, T. Subba Row resigned from the Theosophical Society along with J.N. Cook. Tensions between himself and many of the members, as well as with HPB, had grown too stressful to maintain. It was only slightly thereafter that he contracted a cutaneous disease, a sickness which manifested itself in an outbreak of boils in 1890 during his last visit to the Theosophical Society&#x27;s headquarters in Madras. Eventually he would succumb to the disease that year, and died on June 24, 1890, saying that his guru had called him, and that it was time for his departure. He was cremated the morning after as per Hindu tradition.

==Memorable works==
Among the many memorable works he left to humanity, they include his commentaries on the Bhagavad Gita, Esoteric Writings, and his Collected Writings in two volumes.

<text>The Red Guards (, ; ) were the paramilitary units of the labour movement in Finland during the early 1900s. The Red Guards formed the army of Red Finland and were one of the main belligerents of the Finnish Civil War in 1918. 

The Red Guards were first established during the 1905 general strike but disbanded a year later until they were re-established after the February Revolution in 1917. The combined strength of the Red Guard was about 30,000 at the beginning of the Civil War, peaking at between 90,000 and 120,000 during the course of the conflict, including more than 2,000 members of the Women&#x27;s Guards. The Red Guards were defeated in Finland by the Whites in May 1918 and around 80,000 were captured as prisoners of war, where 12,000 to 14,000 of them died in the post-war prison camps due to disease, malnutrition, and execution. Most Red Guards were pardoned by the Government of Finland in late 1918. 

Approximately 10,000 to 13,000 Red Guards fled to Soviet Russia where some fought against the Finnish Whites in the Russian Civil War, including the North Russia intervention and the Estonian War of Independence. The Red Guards ceased to exist as an organized force by 1920.

== 1905 general strike and Sveaborg rebellion ==
=== Establishment ===
The Red Guards came about during a general strike in November 1905. The strike began in reaction to the Russification of Finland and was a joint effort between the Social Democratic labour movement and the political right. The strike lasted only a week, but in the final days differing views created a deep gap between the two parties. The National Guard, which was established for law enforcement as the police began to participate, was likewise split into the working-class Red Guards and the bourgeoisie-aligned Protection Corps. Some minor incidents followed, especially in the capital Helsinki, but violent clashes were avoided. Although the general strike was over, both guards remained active. In 1906, the number of Red Guard members was estimated at 25,000.
=== Hakaniemi riot ===
Violence between the two sides finally burst out on 2 August 1906 during the Sveaborg rebellion, a revolt of the Russian Bolshevik sailors in the Sveaborg Fortress in Helsinki. As the mutiny started, the Helsinki Red Guard, led by Johan Kock, joined the rebellion by conducting sabotage in the mainland. In the final day of the revolt, Johan Kock declared a general strike on his own, without permission from the Social Democratic Party, which was leading the Finnish labour movement in the absence of any central trade union. The strike was joined by thousands of Helsinki workers.

The bourgeoisie opposed the strike and sent the Protection Corps to the Hakaniemi working-class district in order to keep the city&#x27;s tram traffic rolling. At Hakaniemi Square the Protection Corps was surrounded by an angry mob of local people throwing stones. The incident escalated into a gunfight between the Protection Corps and the Red Guards, supported by a squad of Russian sailors. The riot was finally disrupted by the Russian cossacks, ending with two Reds and seven Protection Corps members dead.

200 people were arrested, but only one Red Guard platoon leader was convicted, as there was not enough evidence against the others. The funeral of the slain Reds became a mass demonstration against the violence of the bourgeoisie. The Protection Corps, in turn, arranged a large funeral as a protest against Red violence.

Once the Sveaborg rebellion was suppressed, 900 Russian mutineers and about 100 Red Guard members were arrested. 77 Reds were convicted.

=== Dissolution ===
As a result of the Hakaniemi riot, the Senate of Finland banned both guards. The Social Democratic Party had already decided to disband the Red Guards in the party congress held in Oulu in late August. Some delegates opposed the decision and had a secret meeting where an underground organization was established to preserve the Red Guards. The organization was soon revealed to the party leaders but the underground Red Guards were active until the 1907 general election. Their task was to be prepared for the possible revolution in Russia.

== 1917 re-establishment ==
=== February Revolution ===

The Red Guards were re-established during the 1917 Russian Revolution as a result of disputes over law enforcement and the general turmoil in the Grand Duchy of Finland. After the February Revolution, the Russian-controlled police force lost its status in Finland. The role of law enforcement was first transferred to the Russian military, which turned it over to local labour organizations. The established unarmed units were temporary and had no further revolutionary goals.

Finally, a new &quot;People&#x27;s Militia&quot; was organized in late March in the seventeen largest Finnish towns. The political right did not accept the new arrangement and the Senate formed a committee to solve the dispute.

On 18 July, the so-called &quot;power law&quot; was passed in the Social Democratic majority parliament. The power to enact laws was to be transferred from Saint Petersburg to Helsinki and from the Senate to the parliament. This law would have enabled a purely Social Democratic government to be formed in consequence of the position the party gained in the 1916 election. The Russian Provisional Government refused to approve the law and, with the co-operation of the Finnish bourgeois parties, dissolved the parliament.

In the October 1917 election, the Social Democratic Party lost its majority, although it remained the largest party with 92 seats. The Senate now disbanded the People&#x27;s Militia and established a police force which left-wing and labour activists were not allowed to join.

=== Workers&#x27; Order Guards ===
The food shortage launched a large number of agricultural strikes during the summer of 1917. On 13 July, a violent clash between the striking farm workers and their employers occurred in the Western Finnish municipality of Huittinen. The incident is often seen as the beginning of the events which finally led to the Civil War in January 1918. After the Huittinen riot, the right-wing farmers in the Satakunta province started forming &quot;Protection Guards&quot; and were soon followed in other parts of the country.

The labour movement responded by establishing &quot;Workers&#x27; Order Guards&quot;. By the early October, guards were formed in seventeen towns and twenty rural municipalities, mostly in the industrialized areas of the Turku and Pori, Uusimaa and Viipuri provinces. These units had up to 7,000–8,000 men. On 20 October, the Finnish Trade Union Federation urged the party and trade union locals to establishing Workers&#x27; Order Guards throughout the country.

In the next three weeks, the number of guards increase to 237 with more than 30,000 members. The rules of the Guards were published in the party newspapers. The formation was very similar to a common military organization, though the commander was replaced with a five-men committee.

Finland was now split into two camps; the middle and upper classes, including the wealthy farmers, against the working class, poor peasants and the landless people. The first violent incidents between the Protective Guards and the Workers&#x27; Order Guards occurred during the general strike in November 1917. More workers were still joining the Order Guards, as the strike ended on 20 November, the number of members was 40,000–50,000. The newspaperman Ali Aaltonen, who had served as a lieutenant in the Imperial Russian Army, was named the first commander-in-chief of the Workers&#x27; Order Guards.
The general strike was the first time the Workers&#x27; Order Guards were used as a nationwide organization. In many places, they were actually leading the strike, instead of the strike committees. The guards were acting on their own, searching for food supplies and weapons from wealthy houses. As the right-wing Protection Corps were rather weak, the Workers&#x27; Order Guards could usually act without any resistance, although, in some places, the Protection Corps took up arms, which resulted in violent clashes, prefiguring the oncoming Civil War.

The Workers&#x27; Order Guards were most powerful in Helsinki as they were armed by the Russian troops. The Helsinki Guard captured a couple hundred people and invaded the House of the Estates, which prevented the Senate from working. The leaders of the Social Democratic Party strictly condemned this kind of action, insisting the militant guards must be taken under the party control. Soon after the general strike, the first congress of the Worker&#x27;s Order Guards was held in the Tampere Workers&#x27; Hall on 16–18 December 1917. By the new rules adopted in the meeting, the guards were now under an unconditional authority of the Social Democratic Party and the Trade Union Federation.

=== Drift toward war ===
After Finland gained its independence from Soviet Russia on 6 December 1917, disagreement and discontent were still growing. Incidents occurred across the country as the striking workers and the Workers&#x27; Order Guards clashed with the Protection Corps and right-wing bourgeoisie. Unemployed demonstrators surrounded the town hall for two days in Vyborg and in Tampere the city council was captured by the local Workers&#x27; Order Guard. In Turku, the Order Guard occupied town offices and captured the chief of police. The Protection Corps attacked the labour activists in some places too.

On 6 January, the Helsinki Workers&#x27; Order Guard declared itself independent from the Social Democratic Party. The unit was renamed the Helsinki Red Guard. Three days later, the guard occupied the residence of the Governor-General of Finland. It was now called as the Smolna, like the Bolshevik headquarters in Saint Petersburg. On the same day, the Helsinki Guard sent 200 men to Sipoo to search for guns hidden by the local Protection Corps. The operation escalated into a gunfight in which two Reds were killed.
At the beginning of 1918, the Workers&#x27; Order Guards still had very few guns. For example, the largest guard in Helsinki was armed with only 20–30 military rifles. In early January, the commander-in-chief Ali Aaltonen went to Saint Petersburg to acquire weaponry from the Bolsheviks. On 13 January, Aaltonen informed the general staff of the cargo of 10,000 rifles and 10 artillery pieces which would be brought to Finland within a couple of weeks. At the same time, the Protection Corps was preparing to receive 60,000 rifles from Germany.

Up to this point, many of the largest Workers&#x27; Order Guards were occupied by radicals who were pushing the Finnish labour movement towards an armed conflict. They were no longer under the authority of the Social Democratic Party or the Trade Union Federation. In order to keep the labour movement united, the party leadership was forced to negotiate with the revolutionary guards. Many of the leading Social Democrats, such as Väinö Tanner, Taavi Tainio and Evert Huttunen, were moderate and opposed armed revolution and the acts of the Order Guards.

In 19–23 January, violent clashes between the Workers&#x27; Order Guards and the Protection Corps occurred in eastern Finland in Vyborg and Luumäki and in the western part of the country in Kiikka. In Vyborg, the second largest city in Finland, the Protection Corps was trying to seize control but was expelled from the town. Another serious incident was in Luumäki, as the Protection Corps seized 200 rifles at the Taavetti railway station. Two days later, the Workers&#x27; Guards attacked the Protection Corps in order to take the guns back.

Finally, on 25 January, the Senate declared the Protection Corps to be government troops. The Social Democrats and the labour movement interpreted this as a declaration of war against the working class. As a result, the Workers&#x27; Order Guards and the Helsinki Red Guard were merged into the paramilitary Red Guard of Finland &quot;(Suomen Punainen Kaarti)&quot; and the revolution was proclaimed in the late evening of 26 January by lighting a red lantern as a sign on the tower of the Helsinki Workers&#x27; Hall. The order for the mobilization came on the next morning from the executive committee of the Trade Union Federation, coinciding with the spontaneous clashing of Red Guards and the Protection Corps.

== 1918 Civil War ==

=== Commanders ===

The first commander-in-chief of the Red Guards was the former Russian Army lieutenant Ali Aaltonen, who was elected during the general strike in November 1917. As the Civil War started, the task was given to Eero Haapalainen, with the Russian colonel Mikhail Svechnikov as his military advisor from the end of February. Haapalainen was expelled on 20 March and replaced by Eino Rahja, Adolf Taimi and Evert Eloranta. The troika stayed at the office until 10 April, when Kullervo Manner was given the dictator&#x27;s rights as head of the Red Government and the Red Guards. August Wesley served as the chief of the Red Guards general staff from 16 February to 6 April. On 25 April, Manner fled to Soviet Russia, and for the last ten days of the war, there was no commander-in-chief. The final major battle was fought in Vyborg under the command of Edvard Gylling and Oskar Rantala.

=== Size ===

Due to incomplete and destroyed records, the exact number of men who served in the Red Guards is unknown. Historians provide estimates between 80,000 and 100,000 men. As the war started, the number was about 40,000, but by the end of the war, the total strength rose to 80,000–100,000 men and women, including 2,600 female fighters and thousands of women in the unarmed maintenance units. Approximately 40,000 were at the front at any one time. The largest single unit was the Helsinki Red Guard with a strength of 8,000–10,000 men and women. Other major units were the Red Guards of Tampere and Vyborg and the Saint Petersburg Finnish Red Guard. The Female Guards had about 2,000–2,600 members. Russian participation remained low, although 40,000 soldiers of the Imperial Russian Army and the Baltic Fleet were still in Finland. Only a few hundred joined the Red Guards, including a few dozen officers. Most of the Russian troops simply wanted to leave the country and return home. In addition to the Finland-based troops, the Saint Petersburg Bolsheviks supported the Reds in some battles on the Karelian Front.

=== Organization ===
The Red Guards were composed of industrial workers, landless rural workers and crofters. Most of them were members of the Finnish Trade Union Federation. The number of middle-class people was very small. The average age was between 20 and 30, the youngest fighters were only 15 to 16-years-old. The Red military units consisted of infantry, artillery and a small unit of cavalry. Weapons and other equipment were mostly received from the Russian troops. In the beginning of February, a train commanded by Jukka Rahja arrived from Saint Petersburg, carrying a cargo of 15,000 rifles, machine-guns, artillery pieces and 2 million cartridges, which the commander-in-chief Ali Aaltonen had purchased from the Bolsheviks. The Reds also had six armoured trains and a couple of aeroplanes which were flown by Russian pilots.

The general staff was located in Helsinki, with major subordinate staffs in Tampere and Vyborg. The infantry was divided into regiments and battalions but in practice, the largest commanded units were companies. A Red Guard company usually consisted of the men of some trade union local. For example, the Helsinki Red Guard had units composed of shoemakers, tailors, blacksmiths, sheet metal workers, plumbers, stonemasons and so on. Also some working-class sporting clubs formed their own squads. In the rural areas, the units were assembled by the men of the same locality. The Red Guard fighters received a salary that was sometimes even bigger than what they were paid for their usual work. As there was high unemployment, money was one of the reasons for joining the guards. Very few Reds had any kind of military background. The ones who had served in the Russian Imperial Army were usually voted as company leaders. The Red Guard fighters had a short military training before they were sent to the front line. The battles were usually fought like an ordinary working day. The fighting begun at the dawn and as the Sun set, the men returned to the base. On the Tavastia Front, some troops even spent the nights in Tampere, returning to the front by train in the morning.

The Red Guards&#x27; major problems were a lack of equipment, poor leadership and training, and food shortages at the front. The practice of electing officers democratically made discipline lax. Sometimes this led to a general unwillingness to go on offensive operations or to operate outside their local areas. The Red Guards did not have a clear command structure. Local commanders developed plans of their own, which did not always coincide with the ones composed by general staff in Helsinki. As there were very few trained officers, battlefield tactics had to be kept basic.

=== War ===
As the war started on 27 January, the Red Guards occupied the capital, Helsinki, and the largest towns of industrialized southern Finland. The front line was soon established, stretching from the Gulf of Bothnia to the Karelian Isthmus, 30–50 kilometres north of Pori, Tampere, Lahti, Lappeenranta and Vyborg. The Whites occupied rural northern Finland, where the few Red strongholds fell in less than two weeks without any strong resistance. The last Red occupied town in the north was Varkaus, which the Whites seized on 21 February. In the Ostrobothnia, Central Finland, Savonia and North Karelia regions most Reds were captured, but in Lapland many were able to flee to Sweden, Norway or Soviet Russia.

The Red military operations were divided into three major theaters: the Western Front (Satakunta and Häme provinces), the Middle Front (Savo province) and the Eastern Front (the Vyborg province). The northernmost area of the Western Front, located north of Tampere, was often known as the Northern Front. The Red Guard general staff worked in Helsinki, with major subordinate staffs in Tampere and Vyborg. As a major railway junction, Lahti was also an important town for the Red military. A large number of units were organized and trained there before they were sent to the eastern fronts in Savo and Karelia.

The Reds launched three major offensives; in the beginning of February, 21 February and 10 March. The goal was to take the east–west railways connecting Ostrobothnia, Savonia and Karelia. From there the Reds could strike at the strongest White strongholds as well as the White capital of Vaasa. However, the offensives failed and the front line remained in the same position from early February to mid-March.

On 15 March, the Whites launched their major offensive against the Reds in the northern Häme where the Red front collapsed in a couple of days. The Whites were now able to besiege Tampere, militarily the most important Red town. The Battle of Tampere was fought from 23 March to 6 April. It was the fiercest battle of the Finnish Civil War, and at the time, also the largest urban battle in the world. The Battle of Tampere ended with mass executions of surrendering Reds, of whom 10,000–11,000 were captured, and thousands fled the surrounding areas.
At the same time, German troops landed on the south coast of Finland and launched their campaign to support the Whites. On 6 April, the Red Government and the Red Guard general staff left Helsinki for Vyborg. The Red units in the western provinces of Satakunta and Finland Proper were given the order to retreat to eastern Finland. The intention was to re-organize the troops behind the river Kymijoki, but the plan was never realized. Instead, the order caused a mass exodus of refugees as tens of thousands of Red Guard fighters, their family members and other Red supporters fled towards the east.

As the Germans seized Helsinki on 13 April, up to 8,000 local Reds surrendered. Thousands of others from the Uusimaa province joined the refugee column that was coming from the west. In two weeks, more than 100,000 Red refugees headed east, in order to flee to Soviet Russia. About 12,000 managed to cross the border, while most of the remaining were captured. In late April, up to 30,000 civilians and Red fighters fell into the hands of the German and White troops in Lahti. The captured were first placed at the Fellman camp, and then transferred to various prison camps across southern Finland. Although most of the women and children were released, 200–600 Red women were executed and hundreds of others moved into other prison camps. The last major battle took place in Vyborg, which the Whites occupied on 29 April. The last remaining Red stronghold was in the Kymenlaakso province where the Reds finally surrendered to the Germans on 6 May.

Between 23 March and 18 April, some clashes also occurred in the remote eastern Lapland. The Karelian nationalist Iivo Ahava was fighting against the Whites who launched the Viena expedition in order to annex the Russian White Karelia into the newly independent Finland. Ahava formed a Red Guard unit in the Russian town of Kandalaksha of the Reds who had fled from Lapland. Two other Finnish Red Guards were formed in Knyazhaya Guba and Kem. In mid-March, these units comprised up to 2,500 men. Ahava managed to stop the Whites and he was also eager to attack their rear in the northern Finland. However, the Red leaders were not interested in supporting him as they considered that the war would be determined in the populated areas of south.

== After the war ==
A substantial number of Finnish Red Guards managed to retreat into Russian-held territories after the Whites&#x27; victory in Finland. Many of those who fled to Russia were reorganized into new fighting units and participated in the Russian Civil War and, by extension, World War I. The United Kingdom organized the Murmansk Legion from Red Guard refugees as part of the North Russia Intervention of the Allies. The British hoped to use the Murmansk Legion to fight off the Viena expedition of the Germany-aligned White Finns into East Karelia. Red Guard units served in the 7th Red Army when it fought in the Estonian War of Independence. There, the Finnish Reds clashed with Finnish White volunteers fighting for the Republic of Estonia.

<text>In legal definitions for interpersonal status, a person who is single is an individual not in a committed relationship, married, or part of a civil union.

== Reasons people remain single ==
People may be or remain single for a variety of reasons, including (but not limited to) one or several of the following:

* Celibacy or sexual abstinence
* Aromanticism
* Asexuality
* Asociality
* Financial duress
* Their mental health
* Pursuing educational or professional advancement
* Lack of suitable partners
* Changes in perceptions of the necessity of marriage
* In some cases, single people may be uninterested in marriage, domestic partnership, or other types of committed relationships.
* Traumatic experiences including domestic violence, dysfunctional family, rape and/or sexual assault
* The increasing trend of marrying later in life and cohabitation
* Those with a neurodevelopmental disorder, such as those on the autism spectrum, can find it difficult to initiate, develop, and/or sustain relationships

Some single people regard and appreciate solitude as an opportunity. Some people stay single by choice. In addition to choosing singleness as a preferential option, there are also those who forgo marriage due to religious orders that prescribe its forbearance. These religious traditions include:

* The Christian monastic cultures of Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, and Oriental Orthodoxy
* The specific Buddhist monastic traditions

==Single culture in specific countries==
===United States===
According to the United States Bureau of the Census, the fastest-growing household type since the 1980s has been the single person. Previously both socially uncommon and unaccepted due to perceived roles, public awareness, modern socioeconomic factors, and increasingly available popular and lengthier education and careers have made the single lifestyle a viable option for many Americans, especially after the Vietnam War.

According to the United States Bureau of the Census, in 2016, single adults accounted for over 45% of the US population. 65% of this group had never been married. In 2014, Pew Research Center notes that the highest percentage of never-married adults between White, Black, Hispanic and Asian Americans were Black Americans. The same study also projected that about 25% of millennials may not get married.

==== Pandemic effects ====
A 2024 Stanford University study found that the COVID-19 pandemic significantly increased the number of single Americans. Researchers estimated that an additional 13.3 million people were single in 2022 compared to pre-pandemic levels. This increase was attributed to the dissolution of new relationships, the failure of informal relationships to develop, and disruptions to the dating market.

The study also revealed that the average American&#x27;s weekly socializing time had not fully recovered from the pandemic. In 2022, individuals reported spending an average of 4.1 hours per week socializing, which was still below the pre-pandemic average of 4.5 hours per week in 2019.

===United Kingdom===
Similar to the United States, single-person households have been seen to be increasingly popular in the United Kingdom. In the 2000s, studies found that more citizens were seen to be valuing their career over personal relationships. The increase in single-person households was also partly attributed to the high self-esteem it can offer to some people.

===Japan===
In Japan, it is not uncommon for citizens to choose to remain single. This has been illustrated with many public figures and celebrities. Women typically value friendships over romantic relationships; many continue to have jobs and marry later, or forego marriage completely.

However, people in Japan who do wish to date have reported that it is difficult to find the time to do so due to being overworked.

===South Korea===
In South Korea an unofficial holiday called Black Day is observed on 14 April each year by and for single people. Singles who did not receive gifts on Valentine&#x27;s Day or White Day meet dressed in black and eat jajangmyeon, noodles covered in black bean paste. The dish is one of South Korea&#x27;s national foods, and is considered a comfort food.

=== Sweden ===
In Stockholm, Sweden, sixty per cent of people live by themselves.

==Terminology==
Terminology for singleness varies, usually based on gender, language, and country. Generally singles can be categorized by the following terms: never married, separated, divorced, and widowed.

===English===
Terms used to describe single men are seldom used, and carry positive connotations. Single men are often simply referred to as &quot;bachelors&quot;.

The English language has more terms for single, unwed women. These terms typically carry a negative connotation. Single women are sometimes called &quot;bachelorettes&quot;, especially in festive contexts in American English. However, the historic term for unwed women is spinster. The connotations of the word &quot;spinster&quot; have changed so much over time that it is now considered a derogatory term. The Oxford English Dictionary says in its usage notes for the word:

:The development of the word spinster is a good example of the way in which a word acquires strong connotations to the extent that it can no longer be used in a neutral sense. From the 17th century the word was appended to names as the official legal description of an unmarried woman: Elizabeth Harris of London, Spinster. This type of use survives today in some legal and religious contexts. In modern everyday English, however, spinster cannot be used to mean simply ‘unmarried woman’; it is now always a derogatory term, referring or alluding to a stereotype of an older woman who is unmarried, childless, prissy, and repressed.

Though spinster has a long history of being negative, there are some authors, such as Katie Bolick, who are trying to change the word&#x27;s connotation into something positive. Additionally, the phrase &quot;Old Maid&quot; is used to describe an unmarried woman.

===French===
&quot;Catherinette&quot; was a traditional French label for women of 25 years who were still unmarried by the Feast of Saint Catherine.

===Chinese===
The term sheng nu is used to describe unmarried women who are in mid to late twenties in China and East Asia.

===Japanese===
In Japan, men who have no interest in getting married are called &quot;sōshoku(-kei) danshi&quot; (草食(系)男子 ) or Herbivore men. This term also describes young men who have lost their &quot;manliness&quot;.

==Civil status and health==
A person&#x27;s civil status can have an effect on their health. People have different perspectives on the ways in which civil status influences health.

A study in 2000 by the BioMed Central&#x27;s public health journal covering the anti-depressant use of 3,500 Finnish people found an 80% increased risk of depression for those living alone. A 2022 finding published in the August issue of Frontiers in Psychiatry using 2,056 studies and data from 123,859 participants found that living alone increased the chances of depression by 42%.

Paul Dolan, professor in behavorial science at the London School of Economics, explained that &quot;if you&#x27;re a woman, don&#x27;t bother [getting married]&quot;, as a study from the American Time Use Survey found that single women live longer and happier lives than married women.

People who support singleness have different opinions on it, pointing out that not all marriages are created equal. Healthy people, with psychological well-being, have happy relationships with their partners. In contrast, unhappy marriages will have the opposite effect, &quot;A bad marriage can make a person feel more isolated than being single&quot; according to sociologist professor Eric Klinenber at New York University.

A study of more than 10,000 adults found that married couples were more likely to gain weight during their process of romantic ventures than singles. In other words, married couples have a higher risk of weight gain that may be large enough to pose a health risk, as reported by Zhenchao Qian, professor of sociology at Ohio State University.

==Targeting==
Dating services are an especially targeted and advertised service for singles. The growth of the dating services and dating events industry has been so drastic that the phrase &quot;dating–industrial complex&quot; (reminiscent of President Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s term &quot;military industrial complex&quot;) has been coined to capture the amount of money and manpower devoted to dating services for singles.

Singles events have been an area of particular growth in singles-related commerce. Many events are aimed at singles of particular affiliations, interest, or religions. Some of the most strongly attended such events are the Christmas Eve party targeted at young Jewish singles in major cities in North America, particularly the Matzo Ball and its big city competitors. A variety of other religious organizations&#x27; singles events are also very popular. However, dating via religious-sponsored singles events has also been criticized for fostering invasion of daters&#x27; privacy and undue expectations.

Also there is a Single Supplement that adds extra fees to those traveling alone.

In some countries, particular laws may directly or indirectly disadvantage single persons. In the United States, for example, Social Security widow(er) benefits are only available to those persons who have been previously married, and single people in the United States pay more income taxes than married people. In many countries tour and holiday operators impose a penalty (often as much as 100%) on persons who travel alone.

Older singles are also heavily targeted by marketers, for much the same reasons. They are typically divorcees or widowed, perhaps reconciled to being single for the rest of their lives, and looking to make the most of what remains to them. Their children, if any, will typically be financially independent. They may, or may not, be looking for another relationship. There is a whole industry dedicated to making unsolicited telephone calls to this group in the hope of exploiting the ones who cannot distinguish between the honest and the dishonest.

<text>The Joint Institute for Very Long Baseline Interferometry European Research Infrastructure Consortium (JIVE) was established by a decision of the European Commission in December 2014, and assumed the activities and responsibilities of the JIVE foundation, which was established in December 1993. JIVE&#x27;s mandate is to support the operations and users of the European VLBI Network (EVN), in the widest sense.

Very-long baseline interferometry (VLBI) is a type of astronomical interferometry used in radio astronomy. It allows observations of an object that are made simultaneously by many telescopes to be combined, emulating a telescope with a size equal to the maximum separation between the telescopes. Normally the participating radio telescopes function individually, working on their own specific projects. In the case of VLBI, they all observe the same source at the same time, allowing much higher spatial resolution. There are many complex and challenging hurdles that need to be overcome to enable this effort. One challenge is the data processing requirement. JIVE operates the EVN data processor, known as the correlator - a special-purpose supercomputer for astronomical VLBI data correlation.

== Organisation of JIVE ==
JIVE is located in Dwingeloo, the Netherlands and is hosted by the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy (ASTRON).

JIVE has seven members:

* The Netherlands, represented by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) and the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy (ASTRON)
* France, represented by the National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS)
* Latvia, represented by the Ministry of Education and Science (IZM)
* Spain, represented by the Ministry of Transport, Mobility and Urban Agenda (MITMA)
* Sweden, represented by the Swedish Research Council (VR)
* The United Kingdom, represented by the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC)
* Italy, represented by the Istitutio Nazionale di Astrofisica (INAF)

JIVE is also supported by the following participating research institutes:

* National Astronomical Observatories of China (NAOC), China
* Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy (MPIfR), Germany
* National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF), Italy
*National Research Federation (NRF), South Africa

There are currently 22 telescopes in the EVN.

Observations using the EVN can also be carried out in real-time, thus earning the name of e-VLBI (electronic Very Long Baseline Interferometry). The telescopes are then linked via high-speed national research and education networks (NRENs) which overcome some of the performance drawbacks of TCP/IP and UDP/IP (networking protocols) to allow sharing large volumes of data for immediate use. Such high-speed networks eliminate the shipping of disks of data from separate observations for correlation, thus allowing astronomers to respond to events as they happen in real time. The VLBI data are streamed to JIVE, where they are correlated and the final, high-resolution image created.

In a demonstration of e-VLBI as part of 100 Hours of Astronomy in 2009 14 telescopes from Australia, Chile, China, Finland, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Puerto Rico, Spain, Sweden and the UK participated in joint observations of the active galaxy 3C120. The participating telescopes included:

* the 26 meter telescope at Hobart, operated by the University of Tasmania;
* the 22m dish of Mopra, part of the Long Baseline Array, operated by CSIRO;
* the 25m dish of Sheshan near Shanghai, operated by the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory, Chinese Academy of Sciences;
* the 14m Metsähovi dish, operated by the Aalto University;
* the 32m telescope of Toruń;
* the 32m telescope at Medicina, operated by the Instituto Nazionale di Astrofisica;
* the 25m telescope at the Onsala Space Observatory;
* the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope;
* the Yebes 40m, operated by the Observatorio Astronomico Nacional;
* the 300m dish of Arecibo, located in Puerto Rico;
* the 6m dish of TIGO, operated by the Geodätisches Observatorium Wettzell.

<text>C. &amp; J. Clark International Limited (trading as Clarks) is a British footwear manufacturer and retailer founded in 1825 by Cyrus Clark in Street, Somerset, where its headquarters remain. As of October 2023, the brand has 320 stores in the United Kingdom and Ireland, and hundreds of franchises located in the Americas, Europe and the Asia Pacific. The company also sells through third-party distribution.

The Clarks brand is best known for its Desert Boot and Wallabee shoes, as well as its collection of school shoes, particularly for children aged 4–12 years.

Clarks manufactured its products in the United Kingdom until 2005, when it began moving some production to the Far East. The company closed its last domestic factory in 2019 as it reported a £84.4 million loss. In November 2020, it was announced that Clarks would be rescued by the Hong Kong-based private equity firm LionRock Capital, and would enter a company voluntary arrangement. The deal meant the company would be out of the Clark family&#x27;s control for the first time in its history. In February 2023, LionRock Capital sold its remaining indirect stake in Clarks to Viva China Holdings Limited.

==History==

===1825–1862 – Rugs, slippers and prizes===
Origins of C. &amp; J. Clark can be traced back to 1821 when Cyrus Clark (1801–1866) entered into a partnership with a Quaker cousin in the trade of fellmongering, wool-stapling and tanning in Street, Somerset. By 1825, this partnership had been dissolved and Cyrus relocated to a site on the High Street in Street, utilising premises that belonged to his father-in-law to exploit his idea of making rugs out of sheepskins instead of pulling off the wool. C. &amp; J. Clark recognise this as the beginning of their business and continue to occupy the site upon which Cyrus started to this very day.

By 1828, as the business had grown, Cyrus appointed his younger brother James (1811–1906) as an apprentice. Educated away from Street, James was meant to be apprentice to a chemist in Bath, but successfully pleaded with his parents to let him stay in Street and help Cyrus. In 1828 to 1829, whilst serving this apprenticeship, James began utilising the offcuts that were too short for making rugs to produce slippers (known as Brown Petersburgs). The slippers were made using outworkers who collected materials from the factory, assembled footwear in workshops at home and returned the finished product for payment. This trade rapidly evolved, providing James with a legitimate claim to an equal partnership in the business when his apprenticeship was served in 1833. Thereafter, it traded as C. &amp; J. Clark.

The brothers developed national and international trade (Ireland in the 1820s, Canada by the 1830s, Australia in the 1850s) and were notably innovative, winning the gold medal at the Great Exhibition in 1851 for their gutta percha elongated galosh.

===1863–1903 – Riding the storm===

A couple of bad years that combined volatile market conditions, a certain lack of financial rigour and questionable planning brought the business to the brink of bankruptcy in 1863. The local Quaker community stepped in and part of the bailout deal was the nomination of James&#x27; eldest son, William Stephens Clark (1839–1925) to the helm of C. &amp; J. Clark.

William Clark put in place an accelerated repayment plan that saw indebtedness drop considerably to 1873 when he became a partner in the business with his father James. For the first time in Britain, William mechanised the shoemaking process and went on to establish C. &amp; J. Clark both as a pioneer of new technology and as a champion of footwear innovation. James withdrew from the partnership in 1889, to be replaced by his son Francis, William&#x27;s younger brother.

In line with the family&#x27;s Quaker values, the capital was also extended beyond the factory to benefit social initiatives in Street: a school was founded so that young men and women could combine working in the factory with continuing their education, a theatre was opened, a library was built, along with an open-air swimming pool and town hall. Playing fields were established for the benefit of all and low-cost housing was provided by the company for its employees.

===1904–1945 – Style, technology and foot measuring===
In 1903 the partnership arrangement was discontinued in favour of a private limited company. This enabled the succession to the third generation of family members as children of William Stephens Clark became &#x27;life directors&#x27; alongside Francis and himself. Tasked with specific responsibilities, Alice Clark, John Bright Clark and Roger Clark developed distinct roles. Brothers John Bright and Roger Clark studied American making processes and techniques with a view to appointing a suitable candidate experienced in the American factory system that they might bring to Street. John Walter Bostock from Lynn, Massachusetts was recruited in 1904. The implementation was a resounding success and Bostock was made a director of the company in 1928.

A London Office, opened in the West End in 1908, supplemented the shoemaking knowledge with style information. A reputation for high-quality goods available in the latest fashions, was established in the early 1910s, and remained until the Second World War. A premium quality &#x27;Tor&#x27; range was produced on the principles of standard lines, followed by a range of affordable fashionable footwear called &#x27;Wessex&#x27;. The company had its first national press advertisement in 1934 and entered formally into retailing in 1937 through the acquisition of Abbotts chain of shops based around London and the provinces. &quot;Peter Lord&quot; was created by Hugh Bryan Clark as a retail brand to avoid alarming agents or alerting competitors to the company&#x27;s activities. It steadily evolved into a national network of stores. Growing awareness that &#x27;bad feet&#x27; were the product of ill-fitting shoes determined Bostock to devise a new shoe fitting system based on the detailed analysis of thousands of foot measurements taken from local school children. In line with the findings the company launched its new children&#x27;s ranges in 1945 with a choice of four width fittings, simultaneously with the new Clarks foot gauge that acted as a scientific measuring instrument to aid the shop assistant.

===1946–1995 – Growth and challenges===

Expansion of the business post-war was largely initiated by fourth-generation family members: Bancroft Clark, appointed managing director and chairman in 1942 and his cousins, Anthony Clark and Peter Clothier, accountable for Sales/Marketing and Manufacturing respectively.
The start-up or acquisition of additional manufacturing facilities (peaking at 17 domestic factories) across the South West and South East of England and South Wales meant that the company&#x27;s volume market share in the UK increased from 1.1 per cent in 1945 to 9 per cent by 1970.
Foreign manufacturing was also sought through agreements with existing domestic manufacturers: Ireland in the 1930s with Australia, Canada and South Africa added in the 1940s and 1950s. Nathan Clark (younger brother of Bancroft) negotiated a number of these agreements in his capacity as Overseas Manager until 1952.
 Bancroft retired in 1967. His son, Daniel Clark succeeded Peter Clothier as managing director in 1973, with Anthony Clark remaining as chairman. He retired in 1974, when his son, Lance Clark, was appointed managing director of the manufacturing and wholesaling division. In 1974 Clarks bought the fashionable Ravel, Pinet and Mondaine. The company acquired &quot;K&quot; Shoes, based in Kendal, Cumbria to salvage it from a hostile takeover. The closure of factories started in 1978, and continued throughout the 1980s.

Daniel Clark resigned in 1986 replaced by John Clothier (son of Peter) who remained CEO throughout the turbulent buy-out negotiations with Berisford International Plc, a properties commodities group that attempted to take the troubled company public. While the proposal was defeated by shareholders at the EGM convened on 7 May 1993 it was also decided to move away from direct family management to professional managers, who would rationalise the business, and would be more comfortable with making the changes needed for its recovery.

===Since 1996: Worldwide growth and a global brand===
The appointment of Tim Parker as CEO in 1996 was made on the initiation of the newly elected chairman, Roger Pedder. Clarks format was radically changed with the &#x27;Act Your Shoe Size Not Your Age&#x27; Campaign in 1997, which contributed to a freshening of the brand.

Completion of the transition from manufacturing to a wholesaling and branded retailing business was conducted by Parker&#x27;s successor, Peter Bolliger, who became CEO in 2002. Closure of the company&#x27;s remaining manufacturing interests meant that the last Clarks UK factory ceased production in 2005 followed by the last &quot;K&quot; factory in 2006. Production was relocated off-shore, using third party factories, predominantly located in Asia.

Transformation of retail and investment to modernise company infrastructure and systems was also completed. Street consequently remains the epicentre for company operations, a distribution facility having been constructed in the village in 2005 with the capacity to process 1 million pairs of shoes per week.

Former CEO, Melissa Potter, who was appointed in 2010, re-organized the business in four regions Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe and United Kingdom &amp; Republic of Ireland (from February 2013), the re-launch in China, the move into India, the launch of the online business and the increased focus on building a global brand. Melissa Potter stepped down as CEO in September 2015. Non-executive chairman Thomas O’Neill lead the business until 2017 when Mike Shearwood was appointed as the new CEO. Then following Shearwood&#x27;s resignation in June 2018, Stella David was announced as interim CEO. In February 2019, Giorgio Presca was announced as the new CEO, and David returned to her role on the board. 

In May 2018, the company announced that it would build a new production plant next to its headquarters in Street, Somerset. The £3 million factory would see the latest in robot technology and create 80 jobs and produce over 300,000 pairs of Desert Shoes per year.

In November 2020, Clarks announced a rescue plan through a £100 million investment by the Hong Kong–based private equity firm LionRock Capital after a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), a form of insolvency, in which the Clarks family will lose overall control of the company. The CVA requires the agreement of landlords, who would receive a percentage of turnover as rent, and creditors. In January 2021, Viva China Holdings has agreed to acquire 51 per cent of LionRock Capital Partners QiLe Limited, the private equity firm which will own the Clarks brand, for £51 million. The majority owner of Viva China Holdings is entrepreneur Li Ning, a former Olympic gold medal winner for China. This resulted in Victor Herrero, a Spanish executive and former CEO of Guess, being named as the new Clarks CEO in March 2021. Prior to his appointment as CEO, he served as a board member to Clarks since April 2019. Jonathan Ram was named CEO in March 2022 and took the position in April of that year.

Between 2022–2023, Clarks launched a collaboration with English footballer Raheem Sterling. Through the collaboration, Sterling launched his own range of Clarks Wallabies as &quot;Raheem Sterling x Clarks Originals&quot;. The line in the &quot;Raheem Sterling x Clarks Originals&quot; is said to include a nod to Sterling&#x27;s roots in Jamaica, with an &quot;Est 1962&quot; badge included on the design, said to be an acknowledgement of Kingston, the capital of Jamaica, which was founded in 1962. Sterling featured in the companies Back to School campaign in 2023 to launch the &quot;Goal&quot; shoe, a school shoe aimed primarily at primary school children, in an attempt to &quot;capture the attention, consideration, and affection of Millennial parents&quot;. The advertisement campaign was said to &quot;create scenarios based on familiar primary school situations with authentic interactions between real schoolchildren and teachers&quot;. The Raheem Sterling range of school shoes feature a football on the bottom soles, with each shoe featuring half a football which, when both shoes are placed together, form a full football on the bottom. The company claim that the &quot;football inspired playprints sole design lets kids leave their own unique impression on the world&quot;. The interior of the school shoes in the range feature a green insole, with a football themed lining.

==Clarks Companies North America (CCNA)==

The history of C&amp;J Clark&#x27;s representation in America dates back to 1950 and the formation of Clarks of England Inc. Initiated by Bronson Davis, a car salesman, who had seen the Desert Boot at the Chicago Shoe Fair in 1949. Davis established a sales organization covering 150 accounts with outlets that stocked Clarks products, predominantly Desert Boots. He also sponsored advertisements for Clarks shoes in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and &quot;Esquire&quot; magazines. Davis established relations with some of America&#x27;s most prestigious retailers; Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, Neiman-Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue. The coverage for the Desert Boot was consolidated by advertising that targeted the &#x27;campus trade&#x27; of Berkeley, Cornell, Harvard, North Carolina and Yale Universities through ads in &quot;Esquire&quot; and college magazines. A young salesman named Robert (Bob) Cullerton followed Bronson Davis at the lead in America. Appointed President in April 1961, he inherited a business focussed on the provision of men&#x27;s casuals and the Desert Boot. He appointed designer Nancy Knox to create a new range advertised via &quot;Playboy&quot; and &quot;Gentlemen&#x27;s Quarterly&quot;.

In parallel with American developments, C&amp;J Clark Ltd. acquired the Blachford Shoe Manufacturing Co. Ltd. of Toronto in 1952, establishing a foothold in Canada led by Hugh Woods and Harold Hughes. Similarities between the businesses in Canada and North America meant Cullerton, Woods and Hughes quickly collaborated. They developed a clear vision of what women&#x27;s sandals and shoes were required to supplement the demand for men&#x27;s casual offerings. An Italian resourcing programme was started by Woods in 1960 to get more style and variety into the ranges. Offices were opened in the Empire State Building, New York in April 1964. Sales were also buoyed by the introduction of the Wallabee in the late 1960s and expansion towards the West Coast. Wholesaling interests were complemented with retail from the late 1970s through the acquisition of Hanover Shoes Inc. who owned 220 retail shops. At the same time C&amp;J Clark decided to bring together its North American interests under one corporation to operate Hanover, Clarks of England and Clarks Canada. The business grew further in 1979 through the acquisition of Bostonian, a well-respected men&#x27;s dress shoe brand, adding 25 more shop locations as well as entry into 70 leased stores and discounting outlets. Responsibility for Clarks Canada and Clarks of England was transferred to the C&amp;J Clarks HQ in Street in 1986. Clarks of England and Clarks Canada officially merged in 1987 to provide more operational efficiencies and more consistency of product offering for North America.

Bob Infantino became CEO of the North American operations in 1992, taking a key role in consolidating the manufacturing, retailing, and wholesaling activities in America into one company: Clarks Companies North America (CCNA) from 1995. By 1998, CCNA became principally a wholesaling business, serving 170 owned retail locations and 3,600 third party wholesale accounts, representing 14,200 retail outlets. Sales increased by 57 per cent from 1995 to 2001, profits rose five-fold. Infantino left the company in 2010, replaced by Jim Salzano who was at the helm of the North American business until 2013, when CCNA officially became the Americas Region, one of the four regions resulting as part of the re-organization initiated by Melissa Potter. Since March 2016 Gary Champion has led the Americas Region as president, also serving on the Global Leadership Team.

===School shoes===

In the United Kingdom, Clarks has long been a popular choice of parents as a place to purchase school shoes for children to wear upon returning to school following the summer holidays. The Independent UK newspaper ranked Clarks as the number one provider of school shoes in the United Kingdom in 2017, highlighting that it has been providing quality shoes for over 170 years and highlighting the fact that Clarks is one of only a few manufacturers of school shoes to be provided in half sizes. Part of the reason, as well as Clarks school shoes being long-lasting and durable, parents have opted for them as most of Clarks school shoes meet the standards set by most primary and secondary school uniform policies. From the mid-2010s, Clarks mire relaxed shoe designs and stricter school uniform policies has resulted in some schools judging that some models of Clarks school shoes do not comply with its school uniform policy.

In 2016, nationwide attention was gathered after 12-year-old Alfie Ingerfeild from Bristol was sent home from school at the beginning of the new school term in September after wearing a pair of Harlem Spin shoes from Clarks&#x27; Bootleg school shoe range. The school, Mangotsfield School, claimed that the Harlem Spin design was &quot;too much like trainers&quot; and therefore classed them as unacceptable and not complying with the school uniform policy, so much so to the extent that the Deputy Head Teacher of Mangotsfield School said that should the shoes be worn the following school day then the pupil would be asked to remove them and forced to wear shoes from lost property. This is despite the fact that the Harlem Spin shoes were advertised by Clarks as being school shoes—Clarks did not give a statement in regards to the incident and questions over the design of the Harlem Spin shoes.

In 2017, a particular style of Mary Jane shoes called &quot;Dolly Babe&quot; was compared unfavourably to Clarks&#x27; own &quot;Leader&quot; school shoe for boys, with parents and ministers both accusing the company of sexism and gender stereotypes —the Mary Janes in question being viewed as flimsy and stereotypically feminine with a heart-print insole and a heart-shaped charm on the toe box while the boys&#x27; shoe was seen as sturdier. The company soon apologised over the matter and withdrew the shoe from sale. Clarks also issued a statement saying it would commit to designing &quot;gender-neutral&quot; footwear following customer feedback.

In March 2018, two pupils from Kearsley Academy were sent home from school due to their school shoes, both purchased from Clarks, for &quot;looking too much like trainers&quot;. The shoes in question were both purchased from Clarks&#x27; Bootleg range, a designated brand of school shoes from Clarks marketed for older children and teenagers.

From 2023, Clarks began producing school shoes in collaboration with footballer Raheem Sterling, with school shoes in the Raheem Sterling range featuring a bright green insole with football lined padding, as well as featuring half of a football on each sole, representing a football when both shoes are placed together.

===Joyance sandal===

During the 20th century, Clarks established a reputation for quality children&#x27;s footwear. The crepe rubber soled Joyance T-bar sandal for both boys and girls was one of their most popular designs. Launched in 1933, it continued in production until 1972. In 1952, Clarks claimed to be selling more than one million pairs of children&#x27;s sandals in sixty countries.

===Desert Boot===

The company&#x27;s best-known product is the Desert Boot—a distinctive ankle height boot with crepe sole usually made out of calf suede leather traditionally supplied by Charles F Stead &amp; Co tannery in Leeds. Officially launched in 1950 the Desert Boot was designed by Nathan Clark (great-grandson of James Clark).

Nathan Clark was an officer in the Royal Army Service Corps posted to Burma in 1941 with orders to help establish a supply route from Rangoon to the Chinese forces at Chongqing whilst also launching a series of offensives throughout South East Asia. Before leaving home his brother Bancroft had given him the mission to gather any information on footwear that might be of use to the company whilst he was travelling the world. The Desert Boot was the result of this mission.

His discovery of the Desert Boot was made either at Staff College in 1944 or on leave in Kashmir where three divisions of the old Eighth Army (transferred to the Far East from North Africa) were wearing ankle-high suede boots manufactured in the bazaars of Cairo. Nathan sent sketches and rough patterns back to Bancroft, but no trials were made until after he returned to Street and cut the patterns himself.

The Desert Boot was cut on the men&#x27;s Guernsey Sandal last and sampled in a neutral beige-grey 2 mm chrome bend split suede. The company&#x27;s Stock Committee reacted badly to the sample and dismissed the idea as it &#x27;would never sell&#x27;. It was only in his capacity as Overseas Development Manager that Nathan had any success with the shoe after introducing it to Oskar Schoefler (Fashion Editor, &quot;Esquire Magazine&quot;) at the Chicago Shoe Fair in 1949. He gave them substantial editorial credits with colour photographs in &quot;Esquire&quot; in early 1950. Bronson Davies subsequently saw these articles and applied to represent the company in selling them across the US, long before they were available in the UK. The Desert Boot was initially sold in Britain through shops in Regent Street, featuring a Union Jack sewn into the label, targeted at tourists. Lance Clark is widely credited with popularising them in Europe during the 1960s.

The Desert Boot have been manufactured at Shepton Mallet, small scale production having initially occurred at Street. During the course of time, Whitecross factory in Weston-super-Mare was subcontracted to relieve Shepton factory of the manufacture of the Desert Boot, before the Bushacre factory at Locking Road, Weston-Super-Mare was constructed in 1958. The Desert Boot was manufactured there until the closure of the factory in 2001.

Clarks announced in July 2017, it was restarting manufacturing Desert Boots, using a new manufacturing unit featuring &quot;robot-assisted&quot; technology, at its headquarters in Street, Somerset. Up to 300,000 pairs a year of desert boots were to be made at the unit, creating up to eighty technical and managerial jobs. However, in January 2019 the company announced that this unit was to be closed, after failing to meet production targets.

===Wallabee===
Produced by Clarks from 1967 and based on a moccasin called the Grasshopper, launched in 1964, by the German company Sioux, the Wallabee brand was manufactured at the Padmore and Barnes factory based in Kilkenny, Ireland, which Clarks had acquired in 1963 and continued to operate until its closure in 1987, when it was the subject of a management buy-out. Managed by Lance Clark who was responsible for having negotiated the licence to produce the shoes in Kilkenny and arranged for the factory staff to be trained in the production of moccasin shoes, the product took off once the decision was taken to market it in North America in 1968. As General Manager of the factory, Paddy Roberts took the shoe to a trade fair in New York in the same year, whereupon he quickly learnt that the trademark Grasshopper had been licensed. In conjunction with Jack Rose-Smith (Clarks Overseas Shoes Export Manager), Bob Cullerton (the President for Clarks in America/Clarks of England), Hugh Woods (managing director of Clarks Canada), Roberts trademarked the name Wallabee. In New Zealand, they were marketed as Nomads.

===Desert Trek===

Another style associated with the Lance Clark who had seen a Zwartjes version of the shoe on the feet of artist Sonja Landweer in the late 1960s. An artist in residence at the Kilkenny Design Workshops, where she had come into contact with Lance Clark, Landweer&#x27;s shoes became the basis for production of the Trek which was first attempted at Clarks factory in Dundalk. This was more attuned to the construction of stitch-down footwear. The shoe was initially launched in North America in 1971 as Trek, before featuring in the UK range in 1972 where it was renamed Hike, owing to an existing footwear trademark. The &#x27;Trek man&#x27; that first featured on the shoe was drafted by Lance Clark and refined by the advertising manager in Dundalk, Bob Patten.

==Popular culture==

Some Clarks styles (particularly the Desert Boot, Wallabee &amp; Desert Trek) were widely adopted as cultural icons by different subcultures and featured in songs as well as popular films and TV series. The most referenced is the popularity of the Clarks shoes in Jamaica and the association with the Jamaican &quot;rude boys&quot; movement.

According to DJ, producer and cultural historian Al Fingers in his book, &quot;Clarks in Jamaica&quot;, this trend started in the late 1960s when the emerging youth culture of the recently independent Jamaica adopted the Clarks shoes as part of their &quot;uniform.&quot; &quot;The original gangster rude boy dem, a Clarks dem wear,&quot; producer Jah Thomas tells Fingers in the book. &quot;And in Jamaica a rude boy him nah wear cheap ting.&quot; Writes Fingers, &quot;In the early 70s, the rude boy/desert boot association became so strong that young males risked a beating by police simply for wearing a pair. &#x27;You must be a thief,&#x27; the police would say. &#x27;How else would you afford such expensive Clarks?&#x27;&quot; He tells the story of an infamous Kingston police officer called Joe Williams, who carried out a raid on a dance being run by producer and label boss &quot;Sir Coxsone&quot; Dodd. The DJ Dennis Alcapone recalls the arrival of Superintendent Williams: &quot;He tell the DJ to turn the sound down, and he say: &#x27;All who&#x27;s wearing Clarks booty, stand on that side of the dance. And who&#x27;s not wearing Clarks booty stand on this side.&#x27; Because he knows that rude boys wear them, so that is a way of identifying them.&quot; Reggae and dancehall stars Dillinger, Trinity, Ranking Joe, Scorcher, Little John, Super Cat and countless others had sung about Clarks in the past. Some of the most famous songs written about the Clarks shoes in Jamaica are Little John&#x27;s &quot;Clarks Booty&quot; and Vybz Kartel&#x27;s &quot;Clarks&quot; (over 2.6 million hits on YouTube).

While the Clarks Desert Boots became fashionable in the Beatnik Culture in the US, they became popular with youth in the UK after being adopted by Sixties Mods who wore them as part of both smart and casual clothing outfits. While the shoes are appropriate for a unisex look, they were particularly popular with male mods who wore them with military parkas, tailor-made suits with narrow lapels (sometimes made of mohair), thin ties, button-down collar shirts, and wool or cashmere jumpers.

The joint influences of the Beatniks and Mods made the Clarks Desert Boots (&quot;Les Clarks&quot;) popular among the Parisian students who wore them during the 1968 riots.

The Clarks Desert Boots carried on through to the Mod Revival era of the Seventies and Eighties becoming a true Retro Mod Classic. They famously featured quite heavily in the 1979 &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;, Franc Roddam&#x27;s film adaptation of the Who&#x27;s rock opera influencing in turn the Britpop movement of the 1990s.

The Clarks Wallabees in particular were adopted in recent times by the American rapper community. Their appeal can be traced to a wave of Jamaican immigrants who came to New York in the 1970s and paired Clarks shoes with suits. &quot;African-Americans saw it as an alternative to sneakers and jeans and incorporated it into their look,&quot; said Slick Rick, a rapper, whose parents were born in Jamaica and later moved to the Bronx. &quot;It&#x27;s a way to be casual but not look like a scrub. The ladies like that.&quot;

The shoe was long a staple of fashionable West Indians in New York City but towards the 1990s had fallen out of favor in hip-hop circles who tended to gravitate toward Timberland boots or sneakers. The rebirth of the Clarks Wallabees as a cool staple from mid-late 1990s is linked with New York–based hip-hop group the Wu-Tang Clan. Wu members (RZA, GZA, Method Man, Raekwon, Ghostface Killah, Inspectah Deck, U-God, Masta Killa, and the late Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard) and in particular Raekwon and Ghostface Killah wore Wallabees because not only they found them aesthetically pleasing but also since no other rapper was wearing them, they showed that they weren&#x27;t victims of the trends. They even featured the name of the shoe in the lyrics of several songs, engendering a revival of the Wallabees as a hip-hop staple by the mid-late 1990s. This justified Ghostface Killah to call himself Wally Champ and feature custom-dyed Wallabee shoes on the cover of his 1996 &quot;Ironman&quot; album. His 2008 compilation album was also called &quot;The Wallabee Champ&quot;.

In the TV series, &quot;Breaking Bad&quot;, lead character Walter White (played by Bryan Cranston) transforms from a high school chemistry teacher into a powerful drug kingpin with pork pie hat, black sunglasses and goatee, but he still wears Wallabees, the only shoe he wears from the beginning of the five-season series until its completion.

==Heritage==

The Shoe Museum was established in 1950 by Laurence Barber at 40 High Street near the Clarks&#x27; headquarters in Street, Somerset. The museum displayed some 1,500 shoes as well as related exhibits, describing the development of shoes from Roman times and especially detailing the growth of Clarks shoes and shoemaking in Somerset. In 2002, a charity called the Alfred Gillett Trust was established to care for the archives and collections of C&amp;J Clark Ltd and the Clark family. Working closely with The Shoe Museum, the trust&#x27;s collections include family and business archives, catalogues and sale materials, artwork and furniture, costume, film and sound archives, historic shoes and shoe making machinery. The trust is named after Alfred Gillett, a cousin of the company&#x27;s founders and an amateur paleontologist; some of his fossils are included in the trust&#x27;s collection. The trust is based at The Grange, a Grade II listed building close to the museum in Street. In September 2019, it was announced that The Shoe Museum would close and the collection would be transferred to the Alfred Gillett Trust&#x27;s archive. The collection was finally purchased by the Alfred Gillet Trust in 2021, who have since announced their intention to open a public museum at The Grange in 2025.

<text>Alexander Peter &quot;Fats&quot; Delvecchio (born December 4, 1931) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player, coach, and general manager who spent his entire National Hockey League (NHL) career with the Detroit Red Wings. In a playing career that lasted from 1951 to 1973, Delvecchio played in 1,549 games and recorded 1,281 points. At the time of his retirement, he was second in NHL history in number of games played, assists, and points. He won the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy for sportsmanship and gentlemanly conduct three times and helped the Red Wings win the Stanley Cup three times. He is one of three NHL players to spend their entire career with one franchise and play at least 1,500 games with that team (the other two, Steve Yzerman and Nicklas Lidström, also played for the Red Wings). Upon retiring in 1973, Delvecchio was named head coach of the Red Wings and was also named the team&#x27;s general manager in 1974; he served in both roles until 1977. Delvecchio was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1977, and in 2017 was named one of the &quot;100 Greatest NHL Players&quot; in history.

Delvecchio is the last surviving member of the Red Wings&#x27; 1952, 1954, and 1955 Stanley Cup teams.

==Playing career==
In 1950-51 Delvecchio played for the Oshawa Generals of the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) and led the league in assists that year. He made his NHL debut on March 25, 1951, playing against the Montreal Canadiens in the Red Wings&#x27; final game of the season. In 1951–52 he spent six games with the team&#x27;s minor league affiliate, the Indianapolis Capitals of the American Hockey League (AHL), for whom he scored nine points, before joining the Red Wings full-time. He helped the team win the Stanley Cup that year. He went on to excel both at centre and left wing for 22 full seasons and was notable as a member of the &quot;Production Line&quot; with linemates Gordie Howe and Ted Lindsay.

In 1956–57 Delvecchio was laid up by a broken ankle for 22 games, but seldom missed a game thereafter, missing only 14 over the following 16 seasons of his career.

In NHL history Delvecchio is surpassed only by Nicklas Lidström in the number of games played in a career spent with only one team. Despite his impressive career, Delvecchio was never the Red Wings&#x27; leading point scorer in a season, primarily due to Howe&#x27;s presence. The closest he ever came was in the 1969–70 NHL season, where he was just three points behind Howe for the team lead.

==Post-playing career==

Following his retirement as a player in 1973, Delvecchio served two stints as Detroit&#x27;s head coach and one as general manager until leaving hockey in 1977 to go into business. Delvecchio is an &quot;Honored Member&quot; of the Detroit Red Wings Alumni Association and is active in its efforts to raise money for children&#x27;s charities in Metro Detroit. At the time of his retirement, he ranked second only to Howe in nearly every significant offensive category in Red Wings history. He has since been passed in most of those categories by Steve Yzerman and in assists by Nicklas Lidström, but he remains third behind Howe and Lidström in games played as a Red Wing.

<text>The Epping Ongar Railway is a heritage railway in south-west Essex, England, run by a small number of paid staff and a team of volunteers. It was the final section of the Great Eastern Railway branch line, later the London Underground&#x27;s Central line from Loughton via Epping to Ongar, with intermediate stations at North Weald and Blake Hall. The line was closed by London Underground in 1994 and sold in 1998. It reopened between 2004 and 2007 as a preserved railway, offering a volunteer-run Class 117 DMU service between Ongar and Coopersale. A change of ownership in 2007 led to the line being closed for restoration to a heritage steam railway, which opened on 25 May 2012.

== Early workings ==
The line to Ongar was opened in 1865 by the Great Eastern Railway, as an extension to its line from Stratford to Loughton that had been opened in 1856 by its predecessor, the Eastern Counties Railway. The extension was single-track, but whereas the Loughton to Epping section was doubled in the 1890s, the section between Epping and Ongar always remained single, apart from a passing loop at North Weald on opening. The eastern end of the loop was severed in 1888, converting it into a siding. About 14 trains each day went to Ongar; the rest terminated at Loughton or Epping.

This remained the case until 1949, when the London Passenger Transport Board&#x27;s New Works scheme extended the Central line to Epping using electric trains, taking over the railway from British Railways. The Epping-Ongar branch lost its through trains to London, and there was a shuttle service between Epping (to connect with trains to London) and Ongar; for eight years, there was the unusual sight of steam trains and London Underground electric multiple units side by side at Epping. The steam shuttle was hired by London Transport from British Railways, as it was felt there was no justification for electrification to Ongar unless patronage of the branch rose. Upon taking over the branch in 1949, London Transport re-converted the siding at North Weald into a passing loop and built a second platform to serve a new westbound track.

In the 1950s, there were attempts to improve the service on the branch, and it was electrified in 1957. Due to the low-cost electrification, although the branch could support eight-car trains as far as North Weald, a maximum of four cars could run to Ongar. The voltage drop along the end-fed line was too great to support full-length trains, and the short platforms were not long enough for eight-car trains. Hence the Epping to Ongar branch was normally operated as an isolated extension of the Central line, with a few through workings south to Loughton. However, for two days every year there were through trains from London to North Weald, for the North Weald airshow, on the Saturday and Sunday of its opening at the aerodrome almost adjacent to the station. The normal Epping to Ongar shuttle dovetailed with this service, passing the terminating trains on the adjacent line during its westbound journey. The through trains were operated as extra trains on the normal weekend Central line timetables, only four cars long due to the restricted platform length at North Weald.

== Cutbacks and closure ==
From the late 1960s, it became clear that the line&#x27;s patronage was not growing as had been expected, mainly due to restriction of development in what was now designated Metropolitan Green Belt land. Even at its peak in 1971, the 650 passengers daily hardly made the line an economic proposition. London Underground tried to close the entire line in 1980, but a reduced service was implemented instead, along with the closing of Blake Hall on Sundays.

North Weald&#x27;s platform one was closed in 1976; then the passing loop/westbound track was lifted in 1978. Until that time, the station was controlled from the original Eastern Counties Railway signal box, which is still sited on the westbound platform, now fully restored. North Weald was the last section of the London Underground to be signalled with mechanical semaphore signals.

When Blake Hall was closed in 1981, it was said to be handling only six customers a day. The station building survives as a private dwelling.

On 30 September 1994, the line was closed. It was making a loss of £7 for each passenger journey and was in need of some expensive maintenance work. At the time of closure the line was carrying a mere 80 passengers a day. Local lore had it that the line was being kept open in case the Cabinet needed to be evacuated to the Kelvedon Hatch Secret Nuclear Bunker at Doddinghurst. The track was left intact along with the stations, but not maintained.

The last Underground train used on the branch, a three-car unit of 1960 stock, has been preserved by Cravens Heritage Trains. It made a return to the reopened heritage railway in 2014, to mark the 20th anniversary of the line&#x27;s closure by London Underground.

One unusual feature of the line is its continuing nominal importance to the London Underground. In 1971/72 the London Underground was remeasured in kilometres. The then most easterly point, Ongar, was chosen as the zero point, and remains so to the present.

== Purchase and reopening ==

The line was purchased by Pilot Developments (later Epping Ongar Railway Ltd) in 1998. The Ongar Railway Preservation Society entered a £325,000 offer for the line, but Pilot Developments convinced London Underground to accept its slightly higher offer after the bidding deadline. Independent politician Martin Bell described the deal as &quot;the most controversial land deal in the constituency for years&quot;, alleging a conflict of interest with local politicians. The line was reopened by the Epping Ongar Railway Volunteer Society on Sunday 10 October 2004, providing an hourly service between Ongar and North Weald. The line was shortly after extended to Coopersale, although there are no boarding or alighting facilities there.

Between 22 January and 9 April 2006 the line was shut down for engineering works. This involved general station maintenance, rolling stock maintenance and track maintenance. Ongar station remained closed for engineering works and general maintenance and reopened on 28 May 2006 without the use of the station buildings.

On Easter weekend 2007, the railway had the most visitors on a single day since reopening, on the Sunday and Monday. The Teddy Bears&#x27; Picnic, Anniversary of Reopening and Halloween events are also popular.

At the end of 2007, as a result of the awarding of planning permission for the Ongar residential development, the railway was sold to a new private owner who was committed to bringing steam back to the line.

Following the change of ownership in 2007, it was decided to suspend train operations and to concentrate on improving the track. This was done in order to undertake the major engineering works to secure its long-term future and facilitate the return of steam to the line, including restoration of station buildings, run-round loops, full signalling, and coal and water facilities. There have been major changes to the Ongar and North Weald stations.

===Ongar===

The goods yard area (derelict since the 1960s) was purchased by David Wilson Homes, which has built a small collection of houses. The Cattle Dock remains, as does the main station building, which has been repainted in GER colours (1900–1930s). Ongar is the only operational GER station in GER colours. Shop and refreshment facilities are available in the main building.

The milk dock is being restored into a bay platform, which will become Platform 2.

All the track has been lowered to accommodate British Rail mainline rolling stock, and a new signal box has been installed at the end of platform 2 in the style of the original and incorporating the original signal frame, which was saved when the original box was demolished. Most of the points and signals are now connected to this.

===North Weald===
North Weald has been repainted in LNER/BR (E) (1940s–1960s) colours, Brunswick green and cream.

The track height has been lowered to accommodate UK standard stock, and the track has been relaid through the loop and into the bay platform, making three operational platforms; the new signalling allows bi-directional working, gives access to improved siding facilities, and enables safer shunting.

===Epping Forest===

The rail service has been extended from Coopersale to within a few hundred metres of the London Underground station. It is impossible to alight at Epping, but the EOR intends to build a platform at the site.

==Resumption of passenger services==
In March 2012 Epping Ongar Railway announced a resumption of services from 25 May 2012, coinciding with the 150th year since the Great Eastern Railway was formed. On the weekend starting 25 May the railway operated a special service. It now runs train services every weekend and bank holiday in the summer; during the Olympics in July–August 2012 at nearby Stratford, the line operated daily.

EOR runs steam- and diesel-hauled trains between Ongar and North Weald, a diesel shuttle from North Weald to Coopersale Lane, and heritage bus services connecting with surrounding towns and the Central line at Epping.

== Heritage railway operations ==

Between 2004 and 2007, the line ran an hourly service on Sundays and Bank Holidays, on the hour from Ongar, arriving at North Weald at 13 minutes past the hour before departing for Coopersale, and returning to North Weald at 33 minutes past the hour, then leaving for Ongar. The first train left Ongar at 11am, with the last returning at 3:50pm (4:50pm between April and September).

Since reopening in 2012 there have been trains on Saturdays, Sundays, Bank Holidays and some school holiday weekdays. The standard timetable has both a steam hauled train and DMU service in operation, with trains running from approximately 10 to 16:30.

==Current rolling stock==
Reference:

== Plans ==

*North Weald: As part of the infrastructure works the railway is restoring the former goods yard, giving much-needed siding space, and putting back full signalling with both semaphore and colour-light signals. This enables locomotive-hauled trains and gives operational flexibility, enabling increased service frequency. The former Woodford GER latticework footbridge has been completed, replacing the condemned LU concrete structure, which has been demolished and removed.
*Ongar: With the track now relaid, works are progressing to restore the station and install signalling. Focus has turned to helping increase flexibility and service frequency, restoring the former cattle and milk platforms, all as part of the networks towards running passenger trains to Epping.

<text>Dinesh Das (16 September 1913 – 13 March 1985) was a Bengali poet and Communist activist.

== Early life ==
He was born in his maternal home at Chetla in Alipore, a locality on the bank of Adi Ganga creek in a Mahishya family. His father was Rishikesh Das. When he was in Class IX, at around 15 years old, he became involved in secret revolutionary Indian independence movement. He also became involved in Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi&#x27;s Salt Satyagraha movement which hampered his formal education. However, he passed Matriculation Examination in 1930, and I.A. in 1932 from the South Suburban College (now Asutosh College). In 1933, he was admitted to B.A. in Scottish Church College. In 1934, first poem &quot;Sraboney&quot; was published in &quot;Desh&quot;. However, he could not complete his B.A. due to his revolutionary and literary activities. In 1935, he took a job at Khayerbari Tea Estate and moved to Kurseong. There he became disillusioned with Gandhism and on return to Calcutta next year, he became inspired by communism and read writings of Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels and Ralph Fox. In 1937, he created a stir with his poem Kaste (Sickle). He immortalized Kolkata&#x27;s Clive Street in one of his poems:

&lt;poem&gt;Here, in a hundred snake-like veins,
Streams of people come and go.
Through these shrunken veins the blood,
Of the country must flow.
O Mighty City&#x27;s beating heart,
O Clive Street of Bengal,
A thousand dumb veins freeze to make,
The cornerstone of your high hall.&lt;/poem&gt;

<text>Aulus Didius Gallus was a member of the Roman Senate and general active during the 1st century AD. He held a number of offices and imperial appointments, the most important of which were governor of Britain between 52 and 57 AD, proconsul of Asia, and suffect consul in the &quot;nundinium&quot; of September to December 39 as the colleague of Domitius Afer.

==Career==
According to Anthony Birley, Aulus Didius Gallus was considered a &quot;novus homo&quot;, &quot;if not necessarily the first of his family to enter the senate.&quot; A proconsul of Cyprus, Aulus Didius Postumus, might be a close relative.

His career up to 51 can be partly reconstructed from an inscription from Olympia. Didius is attested as quaestor in a &quot;senatus consultum&quot; dated to AD 19, that forbade Senators, eques, and their descendants from actively participating in gladiator games. Birley notes that if this inscription has been correctly restored, &quot;he had the signal honour, for a new man, of being quaestor of Tiberius.&quot; Further, if he achieved this magistrate at the normal age of 25, Gallus would have been born around 8/7 BC. Record of his tenure as plebeian tribune and aedile are missing from the inscription, while the next magistracies whose record survive on the inscription are legate or assistant to the proconsul of Asia, and prefect of cavalry. Birley admits that while &quot;it would be fruitless to speculate on the identity of the proconsul of Asia under whom Gallus served&quot; he observes that during this period only two men were proconsuls when he could have been their legate: Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, ordinary consul AD 6, and Publius Petronius, consul 17, &quot;making it probable that it was one of these two.&quot; As for his commission as prefect of cavalry, while Birley notes it has been thought he held it during the invasion of Britain, he argues it is more likely Didius commanded the cavalry as part of a campaign in Thrace &quot;for it would satisfactorily explain the choice of Gallus to command the Moesian army &quot;c&quot;. 44-5.&quot; 

After these two magistracies, Didius was proconsul of Sicily, which fell during the reign of Tiberius; &quot;given Tiberius&#x27; practice,&quot; Birley comments, his governorship of Sicily &quot;may have lasted more than twelve months&quot;. Didius was &quot;curator aquarum&quot; (superintendent of aqueducts) from 38 to 49, consul in 39, and a member of the &quot;septemviri epulonum&quot;, one of the four most prestigious ancient Roman priesthoods. Birley notes the later &quot;would have had special prominence at the Secular Games in AD 47.&quot; Didius received triumphal regalia as an imperial legate under Claudius, probably in Bosporus: Tacitus records that he commanded forces there that were withdrawn in 49. After this the sortition awarded him the post of proconsular governor of Asia, which Ronald Syme dates to 49/50.

His later career is described by Tacitus. In 52 Didius was made governor of Britain, following the death in office of Ostorius Scapula, at a time when the situation was deteriorating as a result of a string of rebellions. The south-east was securely held, but despite the defeat of Caratacus the previous year, the tribes of what is now Wales, particularly the Silures, continued to hold out. Venutius&#x27; first insurrection against Queen Cartimandua of the Brigantes occurred during Didius&#x27; rule and he despatched troops under Caesius Nasica to aid her.

Didius acted to quell the rebels rather than enlarge the empire during his rule, which lasted until AD 57. While Tacitus criticizes him for being reactive and defensive, Sheppard Frere argues that he was acting on instructions from Claudius who did not consider the benefits of further conquest in difficult terrain to be great enough to warrant the risk. &quot;Provincial legates were carefully selected with an eye to what was to be required of them,&quot; Frere writes, &quot;and will have received careful briefing on appointment; and throughout their tenure they were in close contact with Rome.&quot; Instead, Didius built roads and forts at the borders such as those at Usk to contain the native population. After five years in the post, covering the last two years of the reign of Claudius and the first three of Nero, Didius was replaced by Quintus Veranius.

Quintilian tells us that, after several years of campaigning for a provincial governorship, Didius complained at the province he was offered, although whether this refers to Sicily or Britain is unknown. The orator Domitius Afer sarcastically advised him to think of his country. The tombstone of his successor, Quintus Veranius, states that he took the job &quot;although he did not seek it&quot;, which has been interpreted as a barbed comment on Didius.

==Eponym of Cardiff==
The modern city of Cardiff in Wales is often stated to be named for Didius.

The earliest Welsh name for the city, &quot;Caerdyf&quot; combines the elements Caer (fort) which refers to the Roman fort established around 75 AD, and a second element which is less certain. The antiquarian William Camden recorded the origin of the name as &quot;Caer-Didi&quot; (Didius&#x27; Fort). This derives from local beliefs that Didius had built the fort before the arrival of Frontinus in Britain and his construction of numerous supplementary fortifications in South Wales.

Though most modern linguists dismiss this derivation, the Didius connection has remained popular throughout the centuries, appearing in Camden&#x27;s &quot;Britannia&quot; (1586), &quot;The Beauties of England and Wales&quot; (1815), and the writings of Iolo Morganwg and Taliesin Williams.

==Relatives==
Whom Didius married, or whether he had married at all, is unknown. From his name, experts believe that Aulus Didius Gallus Fabricius Veiento, who was praetor in 62, is somehow related to Didius. Some, such as Edmund Groag and Mario Torelli, thought that Veiento was his son or grandson. Olli Salomies has shown that it is more likely that Veiento was adopted by Didius Gallus, at some point before Veiento became praetor.

Anthony Birley mentions a &quot;less certain&quot; relative, Gaius Pomponius Gallus Didius Rufus, proconsul of Crete and Cyrenaica in 88/89.

<text>The Walden School is an organization which runs summer music education programs. It is based in Dublin, New Hampshire and has a year-round office in San Francisco, California. Since its founding in 1972, the Walden School has operated the Young Musicians Program, a 5-week long summer camp and concert series, which is the only summer program dedicated specifically to young composers in the United States. Students aged 9 to 18 study musical composition, along with a unique curriculum of music theory, specialty electives, and chorus. In 2011 the Walden School began running the Creative Musicians Retreat, an 8-day long program for adult musicians from all backgrounds to study choral music, composition, performance, and pedagogy. Both programs take place on the campus of the Dublin School, and they both feature visiting professional ensembles who help to perform new music written by participants, as well as composers-in-residence who inspire and mentor the participants. The Young Musicians Program also puts on a choral concert at the conclusion of the program. Along with participants from the United States, in recent years attendees have come from countries such as Cyprus, Israel, Mexico, China, India, Estonia, Canada, Serbia, and Venezuela.

==History==
The Walden School was co-founded in 1972 by David Hogan, Pamela Layman Quist, and Lynn Taylor Hebden following the death of Grace Newsom Cushman, the founder of the Junior Conservatory Camp (also commonly referred to as the &quot;JCC&quot;). The JCC was founded in the 1940s in Baltimore, Maryland, and was considered the spiritual predecessor camp of The Walden School. The Walden School, which began in Reisterstown, Maryland, was situated on the campus of the Mountain School from 1976 to 1982, a small rural private boarding school in Vershire, Vermont. In 1983, due to the impending sale of the Mountain School, Walden moved to the Dublin School in Dublin, New Hampshire, where it has been held ever since. On July 17, 1996, David Hogan was one of the victims of the TWA Flight 800 crash.

==Methodology==

===Philosophy===
The Walden academic curriculum and teaching methodology is based on a core philosophy which employs a comprehensive and organic approach to learning music, emphasizing creativity in all aspects of the curriculum. The Walden School&#x27;s general philosophy defines music as &quot;sound organized in time.&quot;

===Musicianship===
In the Walden School&#x27;s Musicianship Course students simultaneously learn singing, playing, writing, and improvising music. The Musicianship course teaches the elements of music more or less in the order that they were developed, and starts with the existential question of &quot;what is music?&quot; Students then proceed through a process of discovery beginning with the overtone series and improvisations inside the piano. This method of teaching musicianship breaks with conventional methods of music education, most notably in The Walden School&#x27;s teaching of intervals and modes before teaching functional harmony. The Walden School has recently published a textbook titled &quot;The Walden School Musicianship Course: A Manual for Teachers&quot; about its methodology.

===Composition ===
Walden School alumni see Walden as a &quot;composition camp&quot;, although technically composition is not at the core of the Walden curriculum. The method employed by composition teachers depends on the level of the student. In beginner classes comprising new and inexperienced students, a more improvisation-oriented approach is taken. More advanced classes take an open-ended approach, in that students are encouraged to compose any style they please while simultaneously receiving guidance from their composition teacher on orchestration and notation techniques.

===Computer music===
Computer music was added to the Walden School Musicianship and Composition curriculum in 2000, when a computer lab was first installed. The lab uses Apple Power Mac computers, each supplied with Digidesign Mbox hardware and Reaper software. Students use a Digital Audio Tape (DAT) recorder with a stereo microphone to record sounds, and then later upload these recordings to the Power Macs and begin composing electronic pieces primarily using Reaper software. Other popular pieces of software used among Walden School students to manipulate the sounds they record are Soundhack. Max/MSP is a more sophisticated digital audio signal processing application and is used exclusively among the Walden School faculty.

=== Faculty Commissioning Project ===
The Walden School Faculty are active composers, performers and educators. The Faculty Commissioning Project offers opportunities for collaborating with resident musicians and premiering new works.

<text>Whitecourt-Ste. Anne was a provincial electoral district in Alberta, Canada mandated to return a single member to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta using the first-past-the-post method of voting from 1993 to 2019.

Communities within the boundaries of the Whitecourt-Ste. Anne electoral district include Mayerthorpe, Onoway and Whitecourt.

==History==
The district was created in 1993 from the previous Whitecourt, Stony Plain and a portion of Barrhead electoral districts.

The 2010 electoral boundary re-distribution saw land north of Alberta Highway 16 from within Stony Plain transferred to this district.

===Boundary history===


===Representation history===

The electoral district was created in 1993 primarily from the districts of Whitecourt and Stony Plain. Long-time Progressive Conservative incumbent Peter Trynchy, who had been in the legislature since 1971 and held numerous cabinet portfolios, ran for re-election that year. Trynchy faced a tough fight to keep his seat from Liberal candidate Jurgen Preugschas. Trynchy ran for his final term in office in the 1997 election. He won a large majority to easily retain his seat.

The second member to represent the riding is George VanderBurg. He was elected to his first term with a landslide majority in the 2001 general election. He won a second term with a greatly reduced margin in the 2004 general election. VanderBurg was appointed to a cabinet portfolio in the Alberta government for the first time in 2006. He won his third term in office with a larger margin against Senator-in-waiting Link Byfield in the 2008 general election. In the 2012 general election, he retained his seat for a fourth term in office by a narrow margin over the Wildrose candidate, Maryann Chichak.

VanderBurg lost the seat in the 2015 general election to Oneil Carlier of the NDP, falling to third place behind Wildrose candidate John Bos. Following his election victory, Carlier was named Minister of Agriculture and Forestry in the new government.

On November 19, 2004, a student vote was conducted at participating Alberta schools to parallel the 2004 Alberta general election results. The vote was designed to educate students and simulate the electoral process for persons who have not yet reached the legal majority. The vote was conducted in 80 of the 83 provincial electoral districts with students voting for actual election candidates. Schools with a large student body that reside in another electoral district had the option to vote for candidates outside of the electoral district then where they were physically located.

<doc id="1169088" wikidata="Q245899" url="?curid=1169088" title="Cypriot Greek">
<text>Cypriot Greek ( or ) is the variety of Modern Greek that is spoken by the majority of the Cypriot populace and Greek Cypriot diaspora. It is considered a divergent dialect as it differs from Standard Modern Greek in various aspects of its lexicon, phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax and even pragmatics, not only for historical reasons but also because of geographical isolation, and extensive contact with typologically distinct languages.

==Classification==
Cypriot Greek is not an evolution of ancient Arcadocypriot Greek, but derives from Byzantine Medieval Greek. It has traditionally been placed in the southeastern group of Modern Greek varieties, along with the dialects of the Dodecanese and Chios (with which it shares several phonological phenomena).

Though Cypriot Greek tends to be regarded as a dialect by its speakers, it is unintelligible to speakers of Standard Modern Greek without adequate prior exposure. Greek-speaking Cypriot society is diglossic, with vernacular Cypriot Greek (the &quot;low&quot; variety) and Standard Modern Greek (the &quot;high&quot; variety). Cypriot Greek is itself a dialect continuum with an emerging koine. Davy, Ioannou &amp; Panayotou (1996) have argued that diglossia has given way to a &quot;post-diglossic [dialectal] continuum [...] a quasi-continuous spread of overlapping varieties&quot;.

==History==
Cyprus was cut off from the rest of the Greek-speaking world from the 7th to the 10th centuries AD due to Arab attacks. It was reintegrated in the Byzantine Empire in 962 to be isolated again in 1191 when it fell to the hands of the Crusaders. These periods of isolation led to the development of various linguistic characteristics distinct from Byzantine Greek.

The oldest surviving written works in Cypriot date back to the Medieval period. Some of these are: the legal code of the Kingdom of Cyprus, the Assizes of Jerusalem; the chronicles of Leontios Machairas and Georgios Boustronios; and a collection of sonnets in the manner of Francesco Petrarca. In the past hundred years, the dialect has been used in poetry (with major poets being Vasilis Michaelides and Dimitris Lipertis). It is also traditionally used in folk songs and (, battle poetry, a form of playing the Dozens) and the tradition of (, bards).

Cypriot Greek had been historically used by some members of the Turkish Cypriot community, especially after the end of Ottoman control and consequent British administration of the island. In 1960, it was reported that 38% of the Turkish Cypriots were able to speak Greek along with Cypriot Turkish. Some Turkish Cypriots of Nicosia and Paphos were also speaking Cypriot Greek as their mother tongue according to early 20th century population records.

In the late 1970s, Minister of Education Chrysostomos A. Sofianos upgraded the status of Cypriot by introducing it in education. More recently, it has been used in music, e.g. in reggae by Hadji Mike and in rap by several Cypriot hip hop groups, such as (DNA). Locally produced television shows, usually comedies or soap operas, make use of the dialect, for example with ( instead of ) or ( being a uniquely Cypriot name). The 2006 feature film &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot; features actor Jimmy Roussounis arguing in Cypriot with another crew member speaking Kibrizlija (Cypriot Turkish) about a captain&#x27;s hat they find in the sea. Peter Polycarpou routinely spoke in Cypriot in his role as Chris Theodopolopoudos in the British television comedy series &quot;Birds of a Feather&quot;. In a July 2014 episode of the American TV series &quot;The Leftovers&quot;, Alex Malaos&#x27;s character uses the dialect saying &quot;&quot; (&#x27;I understood&#x27;). In the American mockumentary comedy horror television series &quot;What We Do in the Shadows&quot;, actress Natasia Demetriou, as the vampiric character Nadja, occasionally exclaims phrases in Cypriot.

Today, Cypriot Greek is the other only variety of Modern Greek apart from Standard Modern Greek with a significant presence of spontaneous use online, including blogs and internet forums, and there exists a variant of Greeklish that reflects its distinct phonology.

==Phonology==
Studies of the phonology of Cypriot Greek are few and tend to examine very specific phenomena, e.g. gemination, &quot;glide hardening&quot;. A general overview of the phonology of Cypriot Greek has ever been attempted only once, by , but parts of it are now contested.

===Consonants===
Cypriot Greek has geminate and palato-alveolar consonants, which Standard Modern Greek lacks, as well as a contrast between and , which Standard Modern Greek also lacks. The table below, adapted from , depicts the consonantal inventory of Cypriot Greek.

Stops and affricate are unaspirated and may be pronounced weakly voiced in fast speech. are always heavily aspirated and they are never preceded by nasals, with the exception of some loans, e.g. &quot;shampoo&quot;. and are laminal post-alveolars. is pronounced similarly to , in terms of closure duration and aspiration.

Voiced fricatives are often pronounced as approximants and they are regularly elided when intervocalic. is similarly often realised as an approximant in weak positions.

The palatal lateral approximant is most often realised as a singleton or geminate lateral or a singleton or geminate fricative , and sometimes as a glide (cf. yeísmo). The circumstances under which all the different variants surface are not very well understood, but appear to be favoured in stressed syllables and word-finally, and before . identifies the following phonological and non-phonological influencing factors: stress, preceding vowel, following vowel, position inside word; and sex, education, region, and time spent living in Greece (where is standard). notes that speakers of some local varieties, notably that of Larnaca, &quot;substitute&quot; the geminate fricative for , but contests this, saying that, &quot; is robustly present in the three urban areas of Lefkosia, Lemesos and Larnaka as well as the rural Kokinohoria region, especially among teenaged speakers ... the innovative pronunciation is not a feature of any local patois, but rather a supra-local feature.&quot;

The palatal nasal is produced somewhat longer than other single nasals, though not as long as geminates. is similarly &quot;rather long&quot;.

The alveolar trill is the geminate counterpart of the tap .

====Palatalisation and glide hardening====
In analyses that posit a phonemic (but not phonetic) glide , palatals and postalveolars arise from (consonant–glide–vowel) clusters, namely:

The glide is not assimilated, but hardens to an obstruent after and to after . At any rate, velar stops and fricatives are in complementary distribution with palatals and postalveolars before front vowels ; that is to say, broadly, are palatalised to either or ; to or ; and to .

====Geminates====
There is considerable disagreement on how to classify Cypriot Greek geminates, though they are now generally understood to be &quot;geminates proper&quot; (rather than clusters of identical phonemes or &quot;fortis&quot; consonants). Geminates are 1.5 to 2 times longer than singletons, depending, primarily, on position and stress. Geminates occur both word-initially and word-medially. Word-initial geminates tend to be somewhat longer. have found that &quot;for stops, in particular, this lengthening affects both closure duration and VOT&quot;, but claim that stops contrast only in aspiration, and not duration. undertook a perceptual study with thirty native speakers of Cypriot Greek, and has found that both closure duration and (the duration and properties of) aspiration provide important cues in distinguishing between the two kinds of stops, but aspiration is slightly more significant.

====Assimilatory processes====
Word-final assimilates with succeeding consonants—other than stops and affricates—at word boundaries producing post-lexical geminates. Consequently, geminate voiced fricatives, though generally not phonemic, do occur as allophones. Below are some examples of geminates to arise from sandhi.
* → &quot;Lucas&quot; (acc.)
* → &quot;[s/he] is here&quot;
* → &quot;from the root&quot;

In contrast, singleton stops and affricates do not undergo gemination, but become fully voiced when preceded by a nasal, with the nasal becoming homorganic. This process is not restricted to terminal nasals; singleton stops and affricates always become voiced following a nasal.
* → &quot;[we] smoke cigars&quot;
* → &quot;even though&quot;
* → &quot;on Sunday&quot;

Word-final is altogether elided before geminate stops and consonant clusters:
* → &quot;[we] bought flowers&quot;
* → &quot;on the head&quot;

Like with , word-final assimilates to following and producing geminates:
* → &quot;let it snow&quot;

Lastly, word-final becomes voiced when followed by a voiced consonant belonging to the same phrase, like in Standard Greek:
* → &quot;of Malta&quot;
* → &quot;race&quot;

===Vowels===
Cypriot Greek has a five-vowel system that is nearly identical to that of Standard Modern Greek.

Close vowels following at the end of an utterance are regularly reduced (50% of all cases presented in study) to &quot;fricated vowels&quot; (40% of all cases, cf. Slavic yers), and are sometimes elided altogether (5% of all cases).

In glide-less analyses, may alternate with or , e.g. &quot;cage&quot; → &quot;cages&quot;, or &quot;&quot; → &quot;koulouria&quot;; and, like in Standard Modern Greek, it is pronounced when found between and another vowel that belongs to the same syllable, e.g. &quot;one&quot; (f.).

===Stress===
Cypriot Greek has &quot;dynamic&quot; stress. Both consonants and vowels are longer in stressed than in unstressed syllables, and the effect is stronger word-initially. There is only one stress per word, and it can fall on any of the last four syllables. Stress on the fourth-last syllable in a word is rare and normally limited to certain verb forms. Because of that possibility, however, when words with antepenultimate stress are followed by an enclitic in Cypriot Greek, no extra stress is added unlike Standard Modern Greek in which stress falls only on one of the last three syllables), e.g. Cypriot Greek , Standard Modern Greek &quot;my bicycle&quot;.

==Grammar==
An overview of syntactic and morphological differences between Standard Modern Greek and Cypriot Greek can be found in .
==Vocabulary==
More loanwords are in everyday use than in Standard Modern Greek. These come from Old French, Italian, Occitan, Turkish and, increasingly, from English. There are also Arabic expressions (via Turkish) like &quot;mashallah&quot; and &quot;inshallah&quot;. Much of the Cypriot core vocabulary is different from the modern standard&#x27;s, e.g. in addition to &quot;I talk&quot;, instead of &quot;I look&quot;, etc. A historically interesting example is the occasional use of archaic instead of for the interrogative &quot;from where?&quot; which makes its closest translation to the English &quot;whence&quot; which is also archaic in most of the English speaking world.
&quot;Ethnologue&quot; reports that the lexical similarity between Cypriot Greek and Demotic Greek is in the range of 84–93%.

==Orthography==
There is no established orthography for Cypriot Greek. Efforts have been made to introduce diacritics to the Greek alphabet to represent palato-alveolar consonants found in Cypriot, but not in Standard Modern Greek, e.g. the combining caron , by the authors of the &quot;Syntychies&quot; lexicographic database at the University of Cyprus. When diacritics are not used, an epenthetic —often accompanied by the systematic substitution of the preceding consonant letter—may be used to the same effect (as in Polish), e.g. Standard Modern Greek → Cypriot Greek , Standard Modern Greek → Cypriot Greek .

Geminates (and aspirates) are represented by two of the same letter, e.g. &quot;today&quot;, though this may not be done in cases where the spelling would not coincide with Standard Modern Greek&#x27;s, e.g. would still be spelt .

Despite the centuries-long existence of Greek Cypriot literature, the dialect wasn&#x27;t widely written until the rise of computer-mediated communication in the 2000s. Online and in text messaging, Cypriot Greek, like Standard Modern Greek, is commonly written in the Latin script, and English spelling conventions may be adopted for shared sounds, e.g. for (and ).

== Some comparisons between Cypriot Greek and Standard Greek ==
Cypriot Greek demonstrates a prevalence of archaic elements. The following comparisons provide a visual representation of this phenomenon.

The tables below do not imply that they were written down the same in Attic Greek but it is simply using the modern Greek alphabet&#x27;s pronunciation system applied on attic Greek for comparison purposes.

The classical attic Greek X was pronounced as an aspirated Κ similar to the English K. Θ = aspirated Τ, Γ = ΓΚ/ΓΓ and Β = ΜΠ. In classical attic Greek Η was pronounced a long Ε and not like the modern Greek I, Y 
αγκρίζω is often confused for an English loan word but it&#x27;s actually derived from the ancient αγρίζω, from άγριος.

<text>The  was a political party in the early Meiji-period Japan from 1875 to 1880.

The Aikokusha was formed in February 1875 by Itagaki Taisuke, as part a liberal political federation to associate his &quot;Risshisha&quot; with the Freedom and People&#x27;s Rights Movement. It was disbanded the same year, when Ōkubo Toshimichi promised Itagaki that the government would draft a constitution.

When no constitution had appeared by September 1878, Itagaki revived the &quot;Aikokusha&quot; and renamed it the League for the Establishment of a National Assembly. Its primary purpose was to petition the government to establish a national assembly. It was renamed Liberal Party, which Itagaki founded in October 1881.

The &quot;Aikokusha&quot; should not be confused with the &quot;Aikoku Kōtō&quot;, or with various later ultranationalist movements with similar names.

<text>Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Music is a compilation album by the the Beatles containing previously released tracks. It was issued on 7 June 1976 in the United States, on Capitol Records (catalogue number SKBO 11537), and on 11 June on Parlophone (PCSP 719) in the United Kingdom. A double album, the 28-track compilation includes 15 Lennon–McCartney songs, one George Harrison composition (&quot;Taxman&quot;), and a dozen cover versions of songs written by significant rock and roll composers of the 1950s, including Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Carl Perkins and Larry Williams. Not counting the 1971 Spanish compilation album, &quot;Por Siempre Beatles&quot;, &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Music&quot; was the first Beatles album to include &quot;I&#x27;m Down&quot;, which had previously only been available as the B-side of the &quot;Help!&quot; single.

==Development and release==
This album is described as &quot;troubled&quot; by Beatles producer George Martin in his autobiography, as he was asked by Bhaskar Menon, the president of Capitol Records at the time, to approve the tapes they intended to use, and he was &quot;appalled&quot; because they were some of the early twin-track mono tapes they had made and were going to be transferred to stereo for the issue. Instead of approving the album as it was presented to him, Martin reworked the already mixed tapes for every song, reversing the left and right channels and slightly narrowing the stereo on the tracks &quot;Twist and Shout&quot;, &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot;, &quot;I Wanna Be Your Man&quot;, &quot;Boys&quot;, &quot;Roll Over Beethoven&quot;, &quot;Drive My Car&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Down&quot;. Some of the song editing is not clean: for instance, the beginning of the crossfade of &quot;Dear Prudence&quot; can be heard during the fade of &quot;Back in the U.S.S.R.&quot;, as originally issued on the &quot;White Album&quot;.

EMI Records refused to use Martin&#x27;s modified Capitol tapes, citing the Beatles&#x27; strict instructions that any reissues had to be exactly as originally recorded. The UK Parlophone double album contained the original UK mixes, including five stereo mixes of songs that had not yet been issued in stereo in the UK: the &quot;Long Tall Sally&quot; EP and &quot;I&#x27;m Down&quot;. In October 1980, the album was divided into two single albums, and released as budget LPs in both the UK and the United States. &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Music: Volume 1&quot; contained the songs on the first half of the original album, while &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Music: Volume 2&quot; consisted of the second half. For these reissues, the UK versions were mastered using George Martin&#x27;s reworked Capitol tapes.

=== Singles ===
In both the United States and Britain, &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Music&quot; was accompanied by a single compiled from songs on the album. The US single (Capitol 4274), was originally planned as &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; on the A-side and &quot;Got to Get You into My Life&quot; on the reverse, but when the &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; TV movie was announced for April 1976, Capitol thought better of the connotations and flipped the sides. &quot;Got to Get You Into My Life&quot; hit number 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The British single (Parlophone R 6016), which consisted of &quot;Back in the U.S.S.R.&quot; backed by &quot;Twist and Shout&quot;, hit number 19.

== Packaging ==
Controversy surrounded the album&#x27;s artwork, which featured an embossed colour portrait of the Beatles against a shiny silver background, with the album&#x27;s title spelled out in what is presumed to be neon lights. Symbols of the 1950s were used on the inside of the album&#x27;s gatefold sleeve, including a jukebox, an outdoor movie screen with a picture of Marilyn Monroe, an ice cream, a 1957 Chevrolet, a cheeseburger, and a glass of Coca-Cola. 1950s nostalgia was at a peak around the time the album was released and Capitol was clearly attempting to cash in on the trend. As the Beatles were a 1960s band, the album cover prompted Ringo Starr to complain to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;: &quot;It made us look cheap and we never were cheap. All that Coca-Cola and cars with big fins was the Fifties!&quot; John Lennon was also critical of the artwork and wrote an angry letter to Capitol Records complaining it &quot;looks like a Monkees reject&quot; and suggested the cover instead use famous photos of the Beatles by Astrid Kirchherr or Jürgen Vollmer, both of whom had photographed the band during their Hamburg days. Lennon had also offered to design the cover himself, but was declined.

The budget-line albums replaced the controversial original artwork with a picture based on a photo of the Beatles in 1964. The US editions of the cover set the group in a crowd, while the British cover eliminated the crowd and placed the group against a stark white background.

==Commercial performance==
Album sales benefited from a rather significant wave of Beatles nostalgia that was taking place during the summer of 1976. Interest in the band was undoubtedly boosted by Paul McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Wings over America&quot; tour, which criss-crossed the United States and Canada shortly after &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Music&quot; was released. In addition, sales were not hurt by the fact that the album included the song &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;, of which a cover version had been spotlighted in a made-for-television movie on the 1969 Charles Manson murders that aired shortly before the album was released. &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Music&quot; hit number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the US (kept off the top spot by McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Wings at the Speed of Sound&quot;), and number 11 on the UK&#x27;s Top 60 Albums Chart. It marked the second time a Beatles album competed with a Paul McCartney album over the top two positions on the Billboard chart. During the week ending June 6, 1970, the Beatles&#x27; album &quot;Let It Be&quot; jumped to the number 2 position from its previous week&#x27;s debut at number 104, while McCartney&#x27;s self-titled debut album &quot;McCartney&quot; held at number 1 for a third straight week. The next week, &quot;Let It Be&quot; bumped up to number 1, while &quot;McCartney&quot; slid to number 2, where both albums remained positioned for four consecutive weeks.

<text>James Oliver Freedman (September 21, 1935 – March 21, 2006) was an American educator and academic administrator. A graduate of Harvard College and Yale Law School, he served as Dean of the University of Pennsylvania Law School from 1979 to 1982, before becoming the 16th president of the University of Iowa from 1982 to 1987, and then the 15th president of Dartmouth College, from 1987 to 1998. At both Iowa and Dartmouth, Freedman sought to create as &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it, &quot;a haven for intellectuals,&quot; with mixed results. Freedman was a member of both the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society.

==Early life and education==
Freedman was born in Manchester, New Hampshire on September 21, 1935. He attended and graduated from Harvard College and then Yale Law School.

==Career==
===University of Iowa presidency===

Freedman&#x27;s tenure at the University of Iowa was marked by his support for a $25 million laser research center. In his words, &quot;The University of Iowa can grasp the opportunity for national and world leadership in laser science.&quot; Freedman argued that the laser would become a magnet for research grants from Federal and International agencies, and the Iowa legislature appropriated the $25 million necessary to build the center. The center was unable to attract significant research funding, however, after it was completed.

===Dartmouth College presidency===

As president of Dartmouth College, a private Ivy League university in Hanover, New Hampshire, Freedman grew the physical campus and strengthening Dartmouth&#x27;s graduate programs and professional schools. A small but vocal number of alumni viewed the initiatives the &quot;Harvardization of Dartmouth.&quot;

President Freedman established or revitalized programs in Latin American, Latino, and Caribbean Studies; Environmental Studies; Jewish Studies; and Linguistics and Cognitive Science. He introduced or restored the teaching of the Arabic, Hebrew, and Japanese languages, founded the Institute of Arctic Studies, and incorporated into the curriculum majors in Women&#x27;s Studies and African and African-American Studies. During his administration, Dartmouth achieved gender parity in the student body. In the professorial ranks the College led the Ivy League with the highest proportion of women among tenured and tenure-track faculty.

Freedman also presided over the largest capital campaign in Dartmouth&#x27;s history, the &quot;Will to Excel&quot; campaign, which raised $568 million, exceeding the original $425 million goal. His administration saw the addition of state-of-the-art buildings for the Computer Sciences, Chemistry, and Psychology, as well as The Roth Center for Jewish Life and the Rauner Special Collections Library.

Shortly before he stepped down in 1998, ground was broken for the Baker-Berry Library project, a pioneering model for access to books and electronic information in the 21st century.

==Book==
Freedman authored &#x27;Idealism and Liberal Education,&quot; and was a spokesman for the importance of the liberal arts.

==Death==
On March 21, 2006, Freedman died of non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

== Criticism ==
The one event in Freedman&#x27;s presidency that garnered the most media coverage was the so-called &quot;Hitler Quote&quot; scandal of &quot;The Dartmouth Review&quot; in 1990. A member of the staff of the controversial conservative weekly student newspaper inserted a quote from &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; into the masthead of an edition of the paper, which was published on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish year. In the same edition, the paper also printed a drawing of Freedman as Hitler. The paper&#x27;s editor discovered the quote three days after the paper was distributed, pulled available copies, and issued a campus-wide apology, but the quotation was seen as the latest in a series of attention-getting stunts that were either provocative or offensive depending on the reader&#x27;s point of view.

Freedman&#x27;s administration undertook the building of the &quot;second Green&quot; in an attempt to create a genuine sense of intellectual community at the college.

George Mason University School of Law professor Todd Zywicki, a Dartmouth alum and trustee, later referred to Freedman as a &quot;truly evil man&quot; whose &quot;agenda was to turn Dartmouth into Harvard.&quot; Former Dartmouth Senior Fellow William C. Dowling, noting that the danger of Dartmouth ever becoming like Harvard was exceedingly remote, characterized Zywicki&#x27;s remark as typical of a &quot;brutal philistinism too often associated with the Dartmouth name.&quot; Dartmouth&#x27;s Board of Trustees publicly repudiated any association with Zywicki&#x27;s sentiments. On December 18, 2007, head of the Board Ed Haldeman (Dartmouth &#x27;70) issued a statement noting that &quot;Mr. Zywicki has apologized to members of the Freedman family and indicated that he would like to retract other parts of his speech.&quot; Zywicki was not reelected to the Board.

<text>Bierstadt is a borough of the city of Wiesbaden, capital of the state of Hesse, Germany. It is located in the eastern part of the city, directly east of downtown Wiesbaden, and has about 12,300 inhabitants. Formerly an independent municipality, the settlement was incorporated into Wiesbaden on April 1, 1928. While &quot;Bierstadt&quot; can be translated &quot;Beer Town,&quot; the name is actually derived from Brigid of Kildare (), patron saint of Bierstadt (&quot;Birgidstadt&quot;).

==History==

The earliest traces of settlement in the Bierstadt area date to the Stone Age. However, Bierstadt was first mentioned in historical records, as &quot;Birgidestad&quot;, in a deed of gift on March 12, 927. The town was founded by Irish monks, who named it after the Irish national saint, Brigid of Kildare. In the 11th–12th centuries, the (now Protestant) Church of St. Nicholas was built. The church is not only the oldest existing church in Wiesbaden, but, after the Roman-era Heathens&#x27; Wall in downtown Wiesbaden, is the second oldest building of any kind in the city.

In the Middle Ages, Bierstadt came under the dominion of Nassau, but was subject to strong influences from the Archbishop of Mainz. In the wake of the Protestant Reformation, Bierstadt came fully under the control of Nassau. After the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the town had only 17 inhabitants. Efforts at reconstruction were set back by a fire in 1691. By the middle of the 18th century, Bierstadt had about 500 residents.

The remains of a medieval watchtower, the &quot;Bierstadter Warte&quot;, are located on a height between Wiesbaden and the borough. The watchtower is now part of the borough&#x27;s coat of arms. In 1898, a large observation tower, the Wiesbaden Bismarck Tower, was planned to be built at this site. A temporary wooden tower was constructed in 1910, but funding for the permanent structure could not be obtained. The temporary tower was demolished in 1918.

During the Third Reich (1933–1945), Nazism dominated Bierstadt. On November 9, 1938, the synagogue, dating to 1827, was completely destroyed. After the Allied victory in World War II, about 1,800 apartments were built for U.S. Air Force personnel. The remaining Aukamm and Crestview U.S. military housing areas, transferred to the Army during the Cold War, are located on the northwest and the west side of Bierstadt, respectively.

==Infrastructure==
Bierstadt has a library and two schools, including one primary school - Grundschule Bierstadt, and a gymnasium named Theodor-Fliedner-Schule which was formerly a middle school. Bierstadt is next to the &quot;Aukammtal&quot; and has access to the German Federal Route 455.

Bierstadt has two churches. In addition to the Protestant church (formerly the church of St. Nicholas), there is the Roman Catholic church of St. Birgid.

<text>Erbenheim is a borough of Wiesbaden, capital of the federal state of Hesse, Germany. It has about 10,000 inhabitants. Formerly an independent municipality, the settlement was incorporated into Wiesbaden on April 10, 1928. &quot;Militärflugplatz-Erbenheim&quot; (Lucius D. Clay Kaserne) is home to U.S. Army Europe and Africa.

== History ==
Erbenheim stands on a historic ground. Especially the archaeological excavations have shown how densely populated the area around the stream &quot;Wäschbach&quot; was already early in its history respectively 5,000 years before Christ. From the 2nd to the 4th century after Christ, the Romans finally settled down in the area of Erbenheim. Many Roman finds and Roman estates along the &quot;Wäschbach&quot; suggest that the Romans lived there until the late 4th century after Christ.

927 Erbenheim is first mentioned in the document for St. Ursula in Cologne, which is also meaningful for some suburbs of Wiesbaden. In 1423, Emperor Sigismund granted the town charter. &quot;Erbenheimer Warte&quot;, part of a series of watchtowers built by the prince-elector of Mainz in the late 15th Century, is a prominent cultural landmark. After the Thirty Years&#x27; War Erbenheim developed itself to an important agricultural community, in which wine-growing and sheep farming is very common. In the Medieval times the strong Saint Paul Lutheran Church was built in the old town of Erbenheim. From 1834 to 1835, today&#x27;s townhall of Erbenheim was initially built as a school. First in 1926 the building became the town hall. The actual school, which is nowadays still in use and called &quot;Justus-von-Liebig-Schule&quot;, was built in 1900.

The electric tram was introduced first in 1906 and available between the city center of Wiesbaden and Erbenheim. At the same time the electric light was enabled in Erbenheim, which could be turned on for the first time in October 1908. In 1937 the tram service was folded. Busses provided the passenger transport from now on. The large taverns in Erbenheim were not only for the inhabitants, but also for the citizens of the surrounding towns always great attractions - not least because the visitors of the famous horse racings in Erbenheim, which was carried out between 1907 and 1910, liked to have stopped off for a pint in one of the many taverns in Erbenheim. The race track of Erbenheim was opened in 1910 and turned into a civilian airport in 1929.

1928 follows the incorporation of the city of Wiesbaden. Besides the above-mentioned &quot;Justus-von-Liebig-Schule&quot;, which is an elementary school, the district Erbenheim has also another school, which is called &quot;Hermann-Ehlers-Schule&quot; and sees itself as an integrated comprehensive school since 1992.

== Geography ==
Adjoining districts are Biebrich, Bierstadt, Igstadt, Mainz-Kastel, Nordenstadt und Südost. Lucius D. Clay Kaserne is located near the districts Delkenheim and Nordenstadt. In the Middle Ages Erbenheim was an autonomous city. The &quot;Erbenheimer Warte&quot;, which is located near Mainz-Kastel, was a medieval watchtower built for the Electorate of Mainz. The former race track of Wiesbaden is barely to perceive, you just can imagine it based on the remaining street &quot;Rennbahnstraße&quot;. Close to the townhall a public scale is situated, which is still in use.

== Economy ==
Erbenheim is the starting point of a road network for bikers. Additionally all the country lanes are almost car-free. A trip on this country lanes is worth seeing. A certain route passes Domäne Mechthildshausen and the military airport up to the Nassau meadow with scattered fruit trees. Starting from this point a road network for bikers is extended towards Hochheim, Kostheim and Kloppenheim. These facilities are regularly used by cyclists, inline-skaters and walkers. In the village itself several catering businesses are established, covering a wide range of products in very different price segments. In the village there are several small shops, several butchers and bakeries, but also big supermarkets and bottle shops. The commercial area &quot;Kreuzberger Ring&quot; provides a direct freeway connection. Here are many service providers located, so that Erbenheim also offers a lot of attractive jobs.

== Infrastructure ==

The Erbenheim train station is located 400 meter West of the town hall and connects the district with the central station in Wiesbaden. Also Niedernhausen in the Taunus is available by this rail connection. As part of the renovation of the railway stations a relocation of the station towards the &quot;Berliner Strasse&quot; took place in order to shorten the distances from the bus stations to the town center. Furthermore, Wiesbaden-Erbenheim has a great connection to the road network. Thus, the federal highway 455 leads through the west of the district. Erbenheim has also convenient access to the Rhine-Main-expressway, a section of the national highway A66, that runs along south-east of Erbenheim and connects it with Wiesbaden and Frankfurt am Main.

== Social services ==
Since 1986, in Erbenheim exists an institution, called &quot;pluspunkt&quot;, which offers in Wiesbaden and the surrounding area a wide range of services for people, who have to deal with the aging process. This work is supported by the Protestant Paul&#x27;s Community Erbenheim and the Protestant Dean of Wiesbaden. There is no denominational boundary or an age limit, everybody is welcome and can introduce his own ideas and desires and get involved.

Erbenheim has had a huge daycare center for children since 1997. It provides care of 116 children at the age of 0.5 years until 12 years. The daycare center offers four different groups for the different age classes. The methodology of the work in this institutions is based on the pedagogy of Maria Montessori in order to rear the children independent.

<doc id="1169131" wikidata="Q2933386" url="?curid=1169131" title="Gaius Volusenus">
<text>Gaius Volusenus Quadratus (&quot;fl.&quot; mid-1st century BC) was a distinguished military officer of the Roman Republic. He served under Julius Caesar for ten years, during the Gallic Wars and the civil war of the 40s. Caesar praised him for his strategic sense and courageous integrity.

==Italian origin==
The name Volusenus may be Etruscan in origin (as &quot;Volasenna&quot;), but some scholars have attributed an Umbrian origin to the family, based on inscriptional evidence.

==Military service==
During the Gallic War Volusenus served as &quot;tribunus militum&quot; in the 12th Legion under the &quot;legatus legionis&quot; Servius Galba, and distinguished himself in battle when Galba was defeated by the Nantuates in 57 BC.

In 55 BC Volusenus was sent out by Caesar in a single warship to undertake a week-long survey of the coast of south eastern Britain prior to Caesar&#x27;s invasion. He probably examined the Kent coast between Hythe and Sandwich. However, when Caesar arrived at Dover with his forces he saw that landing would be impossible. Instead, he travelled north and landed on an open beach, probably near Walmer. Volusenus had evidently failed to find a suitable harbour, which would have prevented the damage Caesar&#x27;s exposed ships would suffer at high tide. The great natural harbour at Richborough, a little further north, was used by Claudius in his invasion just 100 years later, but we do not know whether Volusenus travelled that far, or indeed whether it existed in a suitable form at that time (our knowledge of the geomorphology of the Wantsum Channel that created that haven is limited).

Volusenus later became &quot;Praefectus Equitum&quot; (cavalry commander). In 53 BC, during the revolt of Ambiorix, he was sent ahead by Caesar with cavalry to relieve Quintus Cicero, who was besieged by the Sugambri in Atuatuca, but found it difficult to convince the terrified defenders that the rest of Caesar&#x27;s army was not far behind.

When the legate Titus Labienus suspected Commius, the formerly loyal king of the Atrebates, of conspiring against them in the winter of 54 or 53 BC, he invited him to a meeting and sent Volusenus and some centurions to execute him for his treachery. Commius escaped, but sustained a wound to the head.

In 51 BC Volusenus was serving as commander of cavalry under Mark Antony, and in the winter of that year was ordered by Antony to pursue Commius, who was conducting a campaign of agitation and guerrilla warfare. He defeated him in several skirmishes, and finally destroyed Commius&#x27;s forces in a single engagement, although at the cost of a spear-wound to the thigh. S.P. Oakley sees this encounter as an unusual example of single combat in the Late Republic, echoing duels between Romans and physically superior Celts in the Early Republic. Commius himself escaped and later sued for peace on the condition that he never again had to meet a Roman.

In 48 BC, during the Civil War, an attempt to assassinate Volusenus was made by Aegus and Roscillus, two noble brothers of the Celtic Allobroges who had served in Caesar&#x27;s cavalry throughout the Gallic Wars. The brothers had been caught defrauding their comrades of pay and decided to defect to Pompey&#x27;s side. The death of Volusenus was meant to render Pompey useful service, but the task proved too difficult, and they were forced to defect without any such token.

Ronald Syme noted that Volusenus&#x27;s decade-long tour of duty might have been uncommon for a man of his equestrian social rank, many of whom &quot;owed their commissions less to merit than to the claims of friendship and influence or the hope of procuring gain and political advancement.&quot; The exemplary career of Volusenus, like that of Decidius Saxa, indicates that even in the Late Republic an equestrian might choose to excel as a career officer rather than as a publican or businessman. Volusenus is one of only three ranking officers to whom Caesar ascribes the quality of &quot;virtus&quot;.

==Political career?==
Based on a &quot;hopelessly corrupt&quot; reading of one of Cicero&#x27;s speeches against Mark Antony, Volusenus was sometimes identified by 19th-century scholars as a tribune of the &quot;plebs&quot; in 43 BC. The passage, and Volusenus&#x27;s documented loyalty to Caesar, was thus interpreted to mean that he was a supporter of Mark Antony, but two other manuscripts indicate that the proper noun is in fact a verb &quot;(voluissent)&quot; and neither Cicero nor any other source mentions Volusenus among Antony&#x27;s followers. T.R.S. Broughton does not record a plebeian tribunate for Volusenus in &quot;The Magistrates of the Roman Republic&quot;, confirming only that Volusenus was a military tribune in 56 and held the rank of &quot;praefectus equitum&quot; in 52–51 and again in 48.

<text>Alberto Ruiz-Gallardón Jiménez (born 11 December 1958) is a Spanish politician and former Minister of Justice. He was mayor of Madrid between 2003 and 2011. A stalwart of the conservative People&#x27;s Party (PP), he has previously been a leading figure in various local and national legislative bodies. In December 2011 Ruiz-Gallardón was appointed Minister of Justice in Mariano Rajoy&#x27;s inaugural cabinet. He resigned in September 2014.

==Early life and education==
Ruiz-Gallardón was born in Madrid. His father, José María Ruiz Gallardón, was a member of the leadership of the People&#x27;s Alliance (AP), precursor to the present-day People&#x27;s Party. He attended secondary school in Madrid at the Jesuit School Nuestra Señora del Recuerdo, and then studied law at the Universidad San Pablo CEU.

He is married to María del Mar Utrera, who is the daughter of José Utrera Molina, a former Minister of the Franco regime. They have four sons: Alberto, José, Ignacio and Rodrigo.

Alberto Ruiz-Gallardón is a cousin of Trinidad Jiménez, the former Foreign Affairs Minister of Spain, and Cécilia Attias, former First Lady of France. He is the great-grandchild of the composer Isaac Albéniz.

==Political life==
As a lawyer, Ruiz-Gallardón sat for exams to begin a career as a prosecutor at the age of 23. He attained the position, ranking second in the &quot;twenty eighth year.&quot; He was given a position in the Málaga Provincial Court, where he served for a short time until given leave to take charge of the party&#x27;s legal counsel.

In May 1983 he was elected to Madrid city council. In February 1986, at the party&#x27;s Seventh National Congress, he joined its executive committee. In the same year, he ran unsuccessfully as a Senate candidate for Palencia in the general elections but finished fifth, 301 votes behind the successful PSOE candidate, in a district where four candidates were elected. In the aftermath, the secretary general of his party, Jorge Verstrynge, retired and Ruiz-Gallardón became the interim secretary general until the Party Congress could convene.

His next political position was in December 1986, when the regional leadership of AP in Madrid nominated him as candidate for the presidency of the Autonomous Community of Madrid with no eventual success. In February 1987, the Eighth Extraordinary Congress of the AP appointed Antonio Hernández Mancha as chairman. Ruiz-Gallardón left his interim general secretary position and was named one of the four vice-chairmen of the party.

Ruiz-Gallardón was elected Deputy of the Madrid Assembly on 10 June 1987. Only one month later, he was elected to the Senate in the delegation designated by the Madrid Assembly and named spokesman of the AP Parliamentary Group body. On 22 October 1988 Ruiz-Gallardón resigned his party positions as the result of a misunderstanding with chairman Mancha over an agreement with the Democratic and Social Centre (Spain) regarding Assembly rules. At the party&#x27;s Ninth Congress in January 1989, Mancha was replaced as chairman by Manuel Fraga. The party was re-founded as the People&#x27;s Party (PP), and Ruiz-Gallardón was appointed to the National Executive Committee and became president on the Committee for Conflicts and Discipline.

Following the general elections on 29 October 1989, Ruiz-Gallardón continued serving as a senator for Madrid and, as in the previous legislature, headed the PP Parliamentary Group in the Senate. He returned to the PP&#x27;s National Executive Committee at the Tenth Congress, this time with José María Aznar as party chairman. He also retained his position as president of the Committee on Conflicts. In April 1990, he headed an internal investigation of the &quot;Caso Naseiro&quot;. This investigation resulted in the expulsion of several party officials.

First among his party&#x27;s candidates for the Senate in Madrid in the general elections of 6 June 1993, Ruiz-Gallardón was once again elected to the Senate. He continued as Spokesman of the PP Parliamentary Group, and subsequently resigned his corresponding position in the Madrid Assembly.

==President of the Community of Madrid==
On 28 May 1995 Ruiz Gallardón ran for the presidency of the Community of Madrid on a PP ticket, securing a majority of seats in the Assembly for the first time. He was elected President of the Community of Madrid by the Madrid Assembly one month later. Ruiz Gallardón ran for re-election in the 1999 elections, again securing a majority of seats.

During his tenure as regional president, Ruiz Gallardón garnered a high degree of popularity, because of his apparently moderate attitude, especially compared to several leaders of his party. Following José María Aznar&#x27;s announcement that he would not seek re-election as Prime Minister in 2004, Gallardón was one of the PP leaders that were mentioned as a possible successor by the mainstream media.

==Mayor of Madrid==
Encouraged by the Prime Minister José María Aznar, Gallardón became the PP&#x27;s candidate for the Madrid mayoral election of 2003. He was successful in his bid, obtaining a majority of the votes. One of his first decisions was to increase city taxes as a means to back his future plans for the city.

Nicknamed ironically the &quot;Pharaoh&quot; by many locals, the mayor has created an urban renewal plan for Madrid that included the undergrounding of parts of the M30 motorway, the redevelopment of the Manzanares River bank, a push for the virtual gentrification of dwindling historic downtown areas, and a reform of the existing finance laws. In fact, the Madrid bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics figured as the most ambitious component of his plan despite being planned by his predecessor, José María Álvarez del Manzano. Several other projects, such as the four skyscrapers under construction in the old training grounds of Real Madrid, have boosted his urban plans.

In May 2006, Baroness Carmen Cervera publicly demonstrated against his plan to reform Paseo del Prado, as the baroness feared for the effects on her co-managed Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza.

During Ruiz-Gallardón&#x27;s tenure as mayor, the Madrid City Council in 2005 approved the establishment of a Holocaust memorial in Juan Carlos I Park. Ruiz-Gallardón then attended its dedication in March 2007.

==2008 developments==
Ruiz-Gallardón had been considered as a leading candidate for the future leader of the PP, his moderate views making him one of the most popular politicians in the opinion polls, rivalling the president of the Community of Madrid, Esperanza Aguirre, in the leadership race. In the period leading up to the 2008 general election, Ruiz-Gallardón announced his intention to be placed in the Madrid (Spanish Congress Electoral District) congressional list of the PP. Being a mayor, his inclusion in the list would have been an exceptional move as the Party by-laws ban mayors of cities with over 100,000 inhabitants from running for the Congress of Deputies. This move was not approved by Aguirre who announced her intention to resign as President of Madrid in order to run for National Deputy as well (Members of the regional legislatures are barred from the Cortes Generales). On 15 January 2008 Mr Rajoy (leader of the PP) announced that Mr. Gallardón would not be included in the PP lists for General Elections. Mrs. Aguirre had won the intense internal battle with Mr. Gallardón.
Following this announcement, Mr. Ruiz-Gallardón indicated his intention to retire from politics, although the next day he softened his response, and said he will &quot;reflect&quot; on his political future after the March 2008 General Elections.

==Third term. Mayor and deputy==
Alberto Ruiz-Gallardón again won an absolute majority of 31 seats out of 57 in Madrid City Council in the municipal elections of 2011, defeating the socialist candidate Jaime Lissavetzky, who had been State Secretary for sports until then. IU increased its representation from 5 to 6 seats, PSOE lost 3 of its 18 seats and UPyD, that won 5 seats, become a member of the Madrid City Council for the first time in its history.

Ruiz-Gallardón was elected Deputy to Congress for Madrid in the Spanish general election of 2011. He was placed 4th on the People&#x27;s Party list of candidates, choosing to be fourth on the list as a tribute to his father, who had occupied the same place. Alongside Ruiz-Gallardón, other 18 members of that list won a seat in the Spanish Congress of Deputies.

==Minister of Justice==
On 21 December 2011 he was appointed Minister of Justice by Mariano Rajoy, to form part of the first government of the PP after its victory in the general elections held on 20 November 2011. On the same day he was appointed Minister, on 22 December 2011, he left his office as Mayor of Madrid, being replaced ad interim by the deputy mayor, Manuel Cobo.
On 27 November 2011, with 31 votes for, the Plenary of the Council elected Ana Botella as his successor.

At his first Parliamentary appearance as Minister of Justice, he announced his intention to reform the abortion law approved by the previous Zapatero government, a law based on time limits, the same as the ones existing in most European countries, widely criticized by the Catholic Church and by the People&#x27;s Party (in particular in relation to the group comprising young people aged about 16–18 years, who could legally get an abortion despite the opposition of their parents) to return to the 1985 law, by which a woman had to invoke some reason to justify her decision.

He also announced his intention to change the way the 12 judges called &quot;vocales&quot; of the General Council of the Judiciary were elected, returning to the old direct election system by the judges, dropped in 1995 (with a slight modification passed in 2001 during the former PP government, headed by José María Aznar, thanks to the consensus reached with the PSOE, that established the election by the Courts from a list of 31 candidates submitted by the associations of judges) because the 12 &quot;vocales&quot; were filled up with only one association of judges, the prevalent and conservative Professional Association of Magistrates.

As regards the Same Gender Marriage law, introduced by the former socialist government in 2004 to legalize gay and lesbian couples marriage, very criticized by the Catholic Church and by the People&#x27;s Party, that join the demonstrations promoted &quot;in defense of the family&quot;, Ruiz Gallardón said that the government would await the decision of the Constitutional Court about the appeal lodged by the People&#x27;s Party as soon as the law was passed by the Courts.

On 30 May 2012, the government announces the approval of a draft law, developed by the Ministry of Justice, by which court fees will be raised between 50 and 750 euros. Its purpose is, according to the government, to alleviate the saturation of the courts and, at the same time, to assume the costs of legal aid, as well as to prevent conflicts that could be resolved through other means reach the courts. But, according to the opposition, this rise restricts the access of both middle-income and low-income citizens to judicial administration. The highest increases were registered in the area of the &quot;second instance&quot;, in order, according to the government, to reduce the actions that seeks solely to prolong the procedure, as well as to reduce the burden on judicial organs. Thus, appeals in civil and contentious-administrative matters rises to 500 euros and the matching processes in those same areas are increased from 600 to 1200 euros. With respect to the Labour Court, appeal and cassation cases, which until now were free, will have charges of 500 and 700 euros, respectively.

As for the complaint brought by José Manuel Benítez, member of the General Council of the Judiciary, against his president, Carlos Dívar, for suspected misusing of public funds (he would have spent about 6000 euros on travels to Puerto Banús and hotels, fact that he did not deny, but alleged its official character) finally dismissed, Ruiz Gallardón opposed the petition for the appearance of Dívar before the Congress of Deputies, filed by IU (and also subscribed by the PSOE at the last minute), alleging that there is no reason why the president of the CGDG has to go to the Parliament, because the Parliament is not competent to exercise the political control over the government body of the judiciary, but that the responsibilities of the members of the judiciary must only be required within the General Council of the Judiciary itself.

In November 2012, Gallardón justified the Government&#x27;s amnesty to four members of the Catalan police forces stating that &quot;the right of pardon is power of the Government&quot;. The four policeman had previously been judged and found guilty of torturing a citizen, and sentenced to four years in prison each.

On 23 September 2014 he resigned as Minister of Justice and announced his retirement from politics. His decision came after his controversial bill on abortion had been rejected by the Prime Minister of Spain, Mariano Rajoy. He also renounced to his parliamentary seat at the Congress of Deputies. The vacant seat was taken by Valentina Martínez Ferro.

== Lezo case ==
On 26 April 2018, he was imputed by the judge for his involvement in the corruption scandal Case Lezo, which involves leaders of the PP in the Community of Madrid.
One year later, on 30 May 2019, he was absolved together with eight of his advisors which were also being investigated.

<text>Ernest Martin Hopkins (November 6, 1877 – August 13, 1964) served as the 11th President of Dartmouth College from 1916 to 1945.

== Dartmouth Presidency ==
At the dedication of the Hopkins Center for the Arts in 1962, the speaker, then-Governor of New York Nelson A. Rockefeller, turned to the man for whom the building was named and said, &quot;I came to Dartmouth because of you.&quot;

As a young man growing up in New Hampshire, he worked in a granite quarry and decided to attend Dartmouth for his undergraduate education over the stern objections of his father, who had attended Harvard and wanted his son to also attend Harvard. However, after graduating from Worcester Academy in 1896, Hopkins matriculated to Dartmouth. So strong were the impressions he made in Hanover during his student years that then-President William Jewett Tucker employed him as a clerk and supported him with a scholarship during the depression of the 1890s.

A Dartmouth graduate himself (class of 1901), Ernest Martin Hopkins did not fit the typical mold of a college president when he was selected by the Trustees in 1916. He was not an academic, had never held a teaching position and had spent the bulk of his career in the business world. But any doubts about his leadership qualities were quickly dispelled and he showed himself to be a champion of academic freedom in an era when that basic tenet of scholarship was under attack.

The administration of Ernest Martin Hopkins spanned two world wars, and he was called to serve his country on several occasions. In World War I, he was named Assistant Secretary of War for Industrial Relations and served in the Office of Production and Management at the outset of World War II. President Hopkins was the recipient of at least 15 honorary degrees, and, while president of Dartmouth, declined an invitation to serve as president of the University of Chicago in order, according to a 1964 obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;to continue development of his ideas of what an undergraduate liberal arts education should encompass.&quot; The articulation of these ideas during the Hopkins administration has become an enduring legacy that continues at Dartmouth today.

<doc id="1169156" wikidata="Q549635" url="?curid=1169156" title="Firebox (steam engine)">
<text>In a steam engine, the firebox is the area where the fuel is burned, producing heat to boil the water in the boiler. Most are somewhat box-shaped, hence the name. The hot gases generated in the firebox are pulled through a rack of tubes running through the boiler.

==Steam locomotive fire tube firebox ==

In the standard steam locomotive fire-tube boiler, the firebox is surrounded by water space on five sides. The bottom of the firebox is open to atmospheric pressure, but covered by fire grates (solid fuel) or a firing pan (liquid fuel). If the engine burns solid fuel, like wood or coal, there is a grate covering most of the bottom of the firebox to hold the fire. An ashpan, mounted underneath the firebox and below the grates, catches and collects hot embers, ashes, and other solid combustion waste as it falls through the grates. In a coal-burning locomotive, the grates may be shaken to clean dead ash from the bottom of the fire. They are shaken either manually or (in larger locomotives) by a powered grate shaker. Wood-burning locomotives have fixed grates that cannot be shaken. Wood ash is generally powder which will fall through the grates with no more agitation required than the vibrations of the locomotive rolling down the track. The fire grates must be replaced periodically due to the extreme heat they must endure. Combustion air (primary air) enters through the bottom of the firebox and airflow is usually controlled by damper doors above the ash collection pocket of the ash pan. A locomotive that burns liquid fuel - usually &quot;Bunker C&quot; fuel oil or similar heavy oil - does not have grates. Instead, they have a heavy metal gauge firing pan bolted tight against the bottom of the firebox. The firing pan is covered with firebrick and the firebox has a firebrick lining, usually up to the level of the firebox door, all the way around the firebox. The oil burner is a nozzle containing a slot for the oil to flow out onto a steam jet which atomizes the oil into a fine mist which ignites in the firebox. The oil burner nozzle is usually mounted in the front of the firebox, protected by a hood of firebrick, and aimed at the firebrick wall below the firebox door. Dampers control air flow to the oil fire.
===Brick arch===
There is a large brick arch (made from fire brick) attached to the front wall (boiler throat plate) of the firebox immediately beneath the firetubes. This extends backwards over the front third to half of the firebed. It is supported on arch tubes, thermic syphons, or circulators. The brick arch directs heat, flames, and smoke back over the fire towards the rear of the firebox. Visible smoke contains unburned combustible carbon particles and combustible gasses. The purpose of this redirection is to cause more complete combustion of these particles and gasses which make the locomotive more efficient and causes less visible smoke to be emitted from the stack. Without the arch, flames and visible smoke would be sucked straight into the firetubes without having been fully burned, causing visible smoke to be emitted at the stack. The invention of the brick arch allowed locomotives to burn cheaper coal (which contains volatiles) instead of coke, it having been a legal requirement from the outset for engines to &quot;consume their own smoke&quot;. The brick arch and its supports (arch tubes, thermic syphons, and circulators) require periodic replacement due to the extreme heat they endure. The brick arch also deflects &quot;cold&quot; air being drawn in through the firebox door from directly hitting the rear tube plate of the boiler and cooling it when the boiler is hot.

===Firetubes===
Firetubes are attached to one wall of the firebox (the front wall for a longitudinal boiler, the top for a vertical boiler) and carry the hot gaseous products of combustion through the boiler water, heating it, before they escape to the atmosphere. Firetubes serve the additional purpose of staying the flat tube (flue) sheets (front and rear) so that only the top of the front flue sheet and the bottom of the rear flue sheet must be separately braced.

===Sheets and stays ===
The metal walls of the firebox are normally called &quot;sheets&quot;, which are separated and supported by &quot;stays&quot;. The stays support and brace the &quot;sheets&quot; (plates) against pressure. Ideally, they should be located at right angles to the sheets, but since the outer sheet (wrapper sheet) is often rounded and the top of the firebox (crown sheet) is relatively flat by comparison, such a relationship to both sheets is impossible. The actual location of the stays is a compromise. Since stay breakage is hidden, the stays have longitudinal holes, called &quot;tell-tales&quot;, drilled in them which will blow water and steam, revealing if they are broken. A boiler with more than 5 broken stays, or two next to each other, must be taken out of service and the stays replaced. The fusible plugs, usually located in the highest part of the crown sheet, have a soft metal alloy core which melts out if the water level in the boiler gets too low. Steam and water blowing into the firebox both alerts the locomotive crew to the low water condition and helps put out the fire. Not all locomotives are equipped with fusible plugs. Also, fusible plugs should be replaced at regular intervals, about every three months for a locomotive in regular service, because the soft metal alloy core will slowly melt out over time even if the boiler water is carried at proper levels. The &quot;mudholes,&quot; or washout plugs, allow access to the interior of the boiler for washing and scraping away boiler mud and scale.

The sheets on the left and right are called &quot;side sheets&quot; while the sheet in the front of the firebox is the flue sheet. The &quot;front flue sheet&quot; is in the front of the boiler and at the rear of the smokebox. The &quot;rear sheet&quot; is at the back of the firebox and has the door opening in it. The &quot;crown sheet&quot; is the top of the firebox. The crown sheet must be covered by water at all times. If the water level drops below the crown sheet, it will become overheated and start to melt and deform, usually sagging between the crown stays. If the condition continues, the crown sheet will eventually be forced off the crown stays by the pressure in the boiler, resulting in a boiler explosion. This condition, usually caused by human error or inattention, is the single greatest cause of a locomotive boiler explosion.

===Belpaire firebox===
Normally the top of the boiler (wrapper sheet) over the firebox is radial to match the contour of the boiler; however, due to the problem of placing stays at right angles to both the wrapper sheet and the crown sheet (see above) the Belpaire firebox was developed. In the Belpaire design, the wrapper sheet is roughly parallel with the firebox sheets to allow better placement of the stays. This arrangement gives the firebox end of the boiler a more square shape and is usually made as large as possible within the loading gauge, to offer the greatest heating surface where the fire is hottest. The most notable user of the Belpaire firebox in the United States was the Pennsylvania Railroad. Other railroads, such as the Great Northern and Illinois Central, had locomotives with Belpaire fireboxes. Illinois Central 4-6-0 #382, Casey Jones&#x27; engine, had a Belpaire firebox. Steam is usually collected at the front corners of a Belpaire firebox, allowing for a domeless boiler. The top of the firebox, rather than being horizontal, is visibly higher at the front than at the rear to reduce the risk of water being carried over with the steam.

===Wootten firebox===
The Wootten firebox was very tall and wide to allow combustion of anthracite coal waste. Its size necessitated unusual placement of the crew, examples being camelback locomotives.

===Combustion chamber===

Some fireboxes were equipped with a so-called combustion chamber, this is a distinct component from the firebox and tubes - a large single extension of the firebox space, into the boiler barrel, and above the brick arch and separated from the grate and the fire bed, this placed additional space between the fire and the rear fire tube/flue sheet. 

This allowed more complete combustion (reducing fuel wastage) and increased firebox surface area for greater heat-transfer, these factors Improved both boiler efficiency and fuel economy. The improved combustion (which reduces carbon-soot ejection) reduced the carry over of ash and soot into the fire-tubes and smoke box, reducing the frequency of cleaning required. Soot buildup and scale buildup (on the water side) severely reduce heat transfer through the fire tubes/flues, reducing steam generation and boiler efficiency. 

Buildup of soot and scale can also lead to overheating and subsequent tube failure if not cleaned properly to remove soot (with water, compressed air and cleaning rods) and scale with boiler washouts and water treatment e.g. Porta Treatment (minimizes and virtually prevents scale buildup) is named after the Argentine locomotive engineer Livio Dante Porta, who invented it.

===Fireman&#x27;s duties===
The fireman&#x27;s role on a steam locomotive is to ensure the driver has an adequate supply of steam at his disposal at all times. This is achieved by maintaining a supply of fuel to the fire, monitoring the smoke from the fire and controlling it by the use of primary air through the fire bed/grate and secondary air through the firebox door and maintaining the boiler water level by use of steam injectors so that it covers the firebox crown sheet at all times – otherwise, the latter will overheat and weaken, and a boiler explosion may result. The fireman also assists the driver by spotting signals and keeping a good look out when not attending to the boiler. At the shed after the day&#x27;s work is done, the fireman will fill the boiler with water and either bank or dump the fire (i.e. extinguish the fire) or leave the fire to die back according to company policy, apply the locomotive handbrake and if required chock the driver wheels to prevent the locomotive from moving while it is unattended.

==Road locomotive firebox==
Road locomotives, such as traction engines, usually had fireboxes similar to those on railway locomotives but there were exceptions, e.g. the Sentinel steam waggon which had a vertical water tube boiler.

==Stationary boiler firebox==
There were, and are, many different designs of firebox for stationary boilers. In flue-type boilers (e.g. the Lancashire boiler) the flues themselves form the firebox. In water-tube boilers, the firebox is usually a firebrick-lined compartment below the water tubes.

==Marine boiler firebox==
In marine boilers there are also various types of firebox. The main distinction is, again, between fire-tube types (e.g. the Scotch boiler, with internal firebox) and water-tube types (e.g. the Yarrow boiler, with external firebox).

<text>David Thomas McLaughlin (March 16, 1932 – August 25, 2004) was the 14th President of Dartmouth College, 1981–1987. McLaughlin also served as chief executive officer of Orion Safety Products from 1988 to December 31, 2000. He was chairman of the Aspen Institute from 1987 to 1988 and its president and chief executive officer from 1988 to 1997. He served as chairman and chief executive officer of Toro Company from 1977 to 1981, after serving in various management positions at Toro Company since 1970. McLaughlin served as a director of CBS Corporation from 1979 and as chairman in the late 1990s. He also served as a director of Infininity Broadcasting Corporation until the Infinity merger.

== Education ==

McLaughlin earned his A.B. from Dartmouth College in 1954 and his M.B.A. from the Tuck School of Business in 1955. As a Dartmouth undergraduate, McLaughlin was a member of Phi Beta Kappa and various student organizations such as Green Key, Palaeopitus, Beta Theta Pi fraternity, and Casque and Gauntlet. He was voted as the student holding &quot;the greatest promise&quot; out of his undergraduate class.

== Dartmouth presidency ==

McLaughlin joined the Dartmouth board of trustees in 1971 and became chairman in 1977. The trustees conducted a national search for the successor to then-president John Kemeny before deciding to elect their own chairman to the role in 1981.

McLaughlin&#x27;s tenure as president saw growth in many areas of the college. Several new campus facilities were constructed, including the Rockefeller Center, Hood Museum, Berry Sports Center, and the Dartmouth Rowing Boathouse, along with improvements to classrooms and the Dartmouth Skiway. The John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding and the Institute for the Study of Applied and Professional Ethics were also established. Additionally, Dartmouth&#x27;s professional schools—the Thayer School of Engineering, the Tuck School of Business, and the Dartmouth Medical School—grew and strengthened during this time.

Reflecting his business background, McLaughlin more than doubled Dartmouth&#x27;s endowment, which reached a new high of $521 million. He increased faculty salaries by 43 percent over a five-year period.

Dartmouth experienced political unrest and protests under McLaughlin. In 1985, the college drew national attention when a group of students affiliated with conservative newspaper &quot;The Dartmouth Review&quot; used sledgehammers to destroy a shantytown that had been constructed by students on the college green to protest South African apartheid. McLaughlin also received backlash from students and faculty for reinstating the Reserve Officers Training Corps program.

<text>CSS &quot;Baltic&quot; was an ironclad warship that served in the Confederate States Navy during the American Civil War. A towboat before the war, she was purchased by the state of Alabama in December 1861 for conversion into an ironclad. After being transferred to the Confederate Navy in May 1862 as an ironclad, she served on Mobile Bay off the Gulf of Mexico. &quot;Baltic&quot;″s condition in Confederate service was such that naval historian William N. Still Jr. has described her as &quot;a nondescript vessel in many ways&quot;. Over the next two years, parts of the ship&#x27;s wooden structure were affected by wood rot. Her armor was removed to be put onto the ironclad CSS &quot;Nashville&quot; in 1864. By that August, &quot;Baltic&quot; had been decommissioned. Near the end of the war, she was taken up the Tombigbee River, where she was captured by Union forces on May 10, 1865. An inspection of &quot;Baltic&quot; the next month found that her upper hull and deck were rotten and that her boilers were unsafe. She was sold on December 31, and was likely broken up in 1866.

==Background and description==
During the early 19th century, a large cultural divide had developed between the northern and southern regions of the United States primarily over slavery, which was mainly a southern institution. Northerner Abraham Lincoln won the 1860 presidential election, and due to his anti-slavery position a number of southern states seceded in late 1860 and early 1861, forming the Confederate States of America; by April 1861, the American Civil War had commenced. 

From the beginning of the conflict, the Confederates were at a distinct disadvantage compared to the Union Navy due a lack of available ships, infrastructure, and manufacturing capabilities. Control of the Confederate coastline was important because the Union&#x27;s Anaconda Plan intended to blockade the Confederacy to cut off trade, including imported armaments. After Union victories at the Battle of Forts Hatteras and Clark and the Battle of Port Royal in late 1861, both the Confederate government and the individual Confederate states became more concerned with coastal defense.

&quot;Baltic&quot; was built in 1860 at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Little is known about her, and naval historian Saxon Bisbee describes her as &quot;one of the most obscure Confederate ironclads&quot; and states that &quot;Confederate documents relating to the vessel are almost nonexistent&quot;. According to Bisbee, the vessel was taken to Mobile, Alabama, after her construction by Bragdon, but the &quot;Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships&quot; (DANFS) says that she was built for the Southern Steamship Company. She was used as a towboat and as a cotton lighter in Mobile Bay off the Gulf of Mexico.

On November 8, 1861, the Alabama General Assembly passed legislation appropriating $150,000 for an ironclad that could serve as both a gunboat and as a ram. The state government formed a commission to select a vessel for conversion, and the sidewheel steamer &quot;Baltic&quot; was bought on December 13 at a cost of $40,000. The process of converting her into a casemate ironclad began on December 22 and enlarged the ship&#x27;s dimensions, increasing the length to , the beam to , and her tonnage to 624 tons. To allow her hull to carry the extra weight of the armor and guns, the ship was fitted with hog chains. Bisbee states that the converted ship&#x27;s draft was , the DANFS and naval historian Paul Silverstone state , and naval historian William N. Still Jr. provides a figure of about .

The ship&#x27;s propulsion machinery consisted of two single-cylinder steam engines with a bore of and a stroke. These were fed by four horizontal return-flue boilers; the boilers were either long and had a diameter of either . The two paddle wheels were in diameter and wide. As was normal for steamboats of the time, the vessel could be powered by burning either wood or coal. &quot;Baltic&quot; had a fuel capacity of up to . The changes needed to convert her into an ironclad made her very slow; Silverstone and the DANFS list her speed as , and Bisbee describes it as &quot;not [...] more than a man&#x27;s walking pace&quot;. Most Confederate ironclads were screw steamers instead of paddle steamers; &quot;Baltic&quot; was one of the few paddle steamer ironclads actually completed or converted within the Confederacy, and naval historian Raimondo Luraghi described her propulsion as obsolescent. She also had difficulty steering. She had a crew of 86, whose quarters Luraghi describes as &quot;very poor&quot;. Confederate ironclads frequently had issues with excessive heat below deck, the emission of noxious fumes from the machinery, and poor ventilation; &quot;Baltic″&quot;s crew frequently slept on dry land or in the open air.

Her bow was strengthened so that it could serve as a ram, and she was armed with six cannons: two Dahlgren guns, two 32-pounder guns, and two other pieces that Luraghi refers to as &quot;minor&quot; and the DANFS as &quot;smaller&quot;. Historian Gary D. Joiner notes that the Dahlgrens were likely pieces. Naval historian Donald Canney says that her armament consisted of two Dahlgrens and three 32-pounders or possibly a pair of Dahlgrens plus one 42-pounder and two 32-pounders. &quot;Baltic&quot; was armored with iron plates wide and thick that were bolted to her new wooden superstructure, although the aft portion was only protected by bales of cotton. The layout of the vessel is largely unknown. Few descriptions of &quot;Baltic&quot; post-conversion exist, and Still describes the completed product as &quot;a nondescript vessel in many ways&quot;.

==Service history==

On May 12, 1862, &quot;Baltic&quot; was transferred by the State of Alabama to the Confederate States Navy. The Confederates placed her under the command of Lieutenant James D. Johnston. The vessel was formally commissioned that month. She served on Mobile Bay, the area around Mobile, Alabama, and on the Tombigbee River. By February 1863, the ship was too dilapidated for active service, and she was relegated to placing naval mines to protect Mobile Bay. Prior to CSS &quot;Tennessee&quot;″s completion in February 1864, &quot;Baltic&quot; was the only Confederate ironclad on Mobile Bay. Once &quot;Tennessee&quot; was completed, Johnston was transferred to command her, and Lieutenant Charles Carroll Simms was appointed to command &quot;Baltic&quot;. Through late 1863 and early 1864, &quot;Baltic″&quot;s condition worsened. By March 20, 1864, naval constructor John L. Porter had surveyed the ship&#x27;s condition, judging it to be in such poor condition that he recommended that the iron be removed from her. On May 20, Simms wrote that &quot;Baltic&quot; was very rotten and was &quot;about as fit to go into action as a &quot;.

In July, the vessel was partially dismantled, and some of her armor was removed and placed onto the ironclad CSS &quot;Nashville&quot;. After her armor was removed, Confederate naval officer John Randolph Tucker noted that engineers had declared her boilers to be unsafe and that they were having to be patched. On July 21, Simms was appointed to command &quot;Nashville&quot;, and the rest of &quot;Baltic″&quot;s armor was removed to be put on &quot;Nashville&quot;. By the time of the Battle of Mobile Bay in early August, &quot;Baltic&quot; had been decommissioned. With the end of the war approaching, &quot;Baltic&quot;, &quot;Nashville&quot;, and other vessels were sent up the Tombigbee River. They were captured by Union forces on May 10, 1865, at Nanna Hubba Bluff. The next month, Union authorities surveyed &quot;Baltic&quot; and noted that below the load line she was in good condition, but that the portion of her hull above the load line and the deck were both rotten. Although the engines were in good condition at that time, the boilers were unsafe to use. The surveyors suggested that with repairs, &quot;Baltic&quot; could return to use as a towboat, but this never happened, and she was sold on December 31. Bisbee believes that &quot;Baltic&quot; was probably broken up at some point in 1866 and suggests that the ship&#x27;s known poor condition and the lack of further records relating to her indicate that she was likely not used for any other purposes.

<text>Greatest Hits is a compilation album by the American rock band Journey, originally released in 1988 by Columbia Records. It is the band&#x27;s best-selling career disc, spending 845 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart (more than any other compilation album, except for Bob Marley and the Wailers&#x27; &quot;Legend&quot;, in history). Additionally, as of March 2025, it has logged 1,476 weeks on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Catalog Albums chart.

On 26 January 2024, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; 18× Platinum for sales of 18 million copies in the United States. As of January 2024, it was reported to have been the third-highest certified &quot;greatest hits&quot; package in the United States according to the RIAA, behind similar compilations by only the Eagles and Billy Joel.

&quot;Greatest Hits&quot; continues to be one of the most popular &#x27;best of&#x27; packages, at times selling close to 500,000 copies globally per year. The album has been reissued several times and was digitally remastered for compact disc by Legacy Recordings, issued on August 1, 2006, with &quot;When You Love a Woman&quot; featured as a bonus track. In Japan, the album has been reissued as Open Arms: Greatest Hits with the song &quot;Open Arms&quot; appearing as the first song on the album. A second Journey compilation album, &quot;Greatest Hits 2&quot;, was released in 2011.

<text>In music of the Renaissance and early Baroque eras, a bicinium (pl. bicinia) was a composition for only two parts, especially one for the purpose of teaching counterpoint or singing.

The term has had two usages in music history:

# Recently, the term has come to mean any composition at all from the Renaissance or early Baroque period for two vocal or instrumental parts.
# Historically, a bicinium referred specifically to a two-part composition used as a teaching tool, most often in Protestant, German-speaking areas.

The term was first used in Poland, by Jan z Lublina in a treatise of 1540. Volumes of bicinia were published in the next several decades in Germany, the Low Countries, and even in Italy, as the usefulness of bicinia as teaching aids became apparent. In addition, Martin Luther had strongly expressed that children should learn both music and the psalms: bicinia with German texts from the Psalms fulfilled his purpose.

Students could be expected to master singing a single part in a duet more easily than a part in a larger ensemble. Usually a bicinium was designed to be sung or played by students of the same age and ability, rather than for a single student and a teacher.

This model of moving from two-part study, writing, and singing to three parts and then more was adopted by Heinrich Glarean in his &quot;Dodecachordon&quot; (1547), one of the most influential music theory and pedagogy treatises of the Renaissance.

In a similar manner, present-day music students typically learn counterpoint first by writing in two parts, and then later in three, only moving to four or more parts after mastering the earlier stages.

A similar pedagogical composition for three voices is known as a tricinium (pl. tricinia).

<text>Con Conrad (born Conrad K. Dober; June 18, 1891 – September 28, 1938) was an American songwriter and producer.

==Biography==
Conrad was born in Manhattan, New York, and published his first song, &quot;Down in Dear Old New Orleans&quot;, in 1912. Conrad produced the Broadway show &quot;The Honeymoon Express&quot;, starring Al Jolson, in 1913. By 1918, Conrad was writing and publishing with Henry Waterson (1873–1933). He co-composed &quot;Margie&quot; in 1920 with J. Russel Robinson and lyricist Benny Davis, which became his first major hit. He went on to compose hits that became standards, including:

* &quot;Palesteena&quot; with co-composer and co-lyricist J. Russel Robinson (1920)
* &quot;Singin&#x27; the Blues&quot; with co-composer J. Russel Robinson and lyricists Sam M. Lewis and Joe Young (1920)
* &quot;You&#x27;ve Got to See Mama Ev&#x27;ry Night&quot; with co-composer and co-lyricist Billy Rose (1923)
* &quot;Come on Spark Plug&quot; with co-composer and co-lyricist Billy Rose (1923)
* &quot;Barney Google&quot; with co-composer and co-lyricist Billy Rose (1923)
* &quot;Memory Lane&quot; with lyricist Buddy DeSylva and co-composer Larry Spier (1924)
* &quot;Lonesome and Sorry&quot; with lyricist Benny Davis (1926)
* &quot;Ma! He&#x27;s Making Eyes at Me&quot; with lyricist Sidney Clare (1928)

In 1923, Conrad focused on the stage and wrote the scores for the Broadway shows: &quot;The Greenwich Village Follies&quot;, &quot;Moonlight&quot;, &quot;Betty Lee&quot;, &quot;Kitty’s Kisses&quot; and &quot;Americana&quot;. In 1924 the Longacre Theatre staged the small musical &quot;Moonlight&quot;, with a score by Conrad and William B. Friedlander. The next year Conrad and Friedlander&#x27;s &quot;Mercenary Mary&quot; was presented at the Longacre. In 1929, Conrad moved to Hollywood after losing all of his money on unsuccessful shows. There he worked on films such as &quot;Fox Movietone Follies&quot;, &quot;Palmy Days&quot;, &quot;The Gay Divorcee&quot; and &quot;Here’s to Romance&quot;.

Conrad received the first Academy Award for Best Song for &quot;The Continental&quot; in 1934 with collaborator Herb Magidson. He died four years later in Van Nuys, California at age 47 after a long illness.

His spouse was actress Francine Larrimore.

Conrad was inducted posthumously into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970.

<doc id="1169175" wikidata="Q5416832" url="?curid=1169175" title="EverQuest Online Adventures">
<text>EverQuest Online Adventures (EQOA) is a discontinued 2003 massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) developed and published by Sony Online Entertainment for the PlayStation 2. The game is part of the &quot;EverQuest&quot; franchise and was shut down on March 29, 2012, after nine years of operation.

An expansion pack was launched on November 18, 2003, titled &quot;EverQuest Online Adventures: Frontiers&quot;; it added a playable race—the Ogre—and character class—Alchemist—as well as many quests and items.

==Setting and gameplay==
&quot;EverQuest Online Adventures&quot; was set in the fictional world of Norrath 500 years prior to the original &quot;EverQuest&quot;, in the &quot;Age of Adventure&quot;. The world featured many places familiar to fans of the original and most of the differences were explained in the lore of &quot;EverQuest&quot;. The gameplay focused on character advancement, environment combat, quests, exploration, grouping, and socializing. It also contained a simple PVP system that allowed two players to fight one another.

There were fifteen playable classes and ten races.

==Development==

&quot;EverQuest Online Adventures&quot; was developed and published by Sony Online Entertainment (SOE), and first released on February 11, 2003, in North America. The game was developed so that it did not require a hard disk drive (HDD) like &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; did. Since no HDD for the system was ever released in PAL territories, &quot;EQOA&quot; remained the only MMORPG there.

&quot;EverQuest Online Adventures: Frontiers&quot; was launched on November 18, 2003. &quot;Frontiers&quot; added a playable race—the Ogre—and character class—Alchemist—as well as many quests and items.

The continued development of content after the first expansion was introduced as free content updates instead of additional expansion packs.

&quot;EverQuest Online Adventures&quot; was shut down on March 29, 2012.

<text>The Battle of Ascalon took place on 12 August 1099 shortly after the capture of Jerusalem, and is often considered the last action of the First Crusade. The crusader army led by Godfrey of Bouillon defeated and drove off a Fatimid army.

The Crusaders completed their primary objective of capturing Jerusalem on 15 July 1099. In early August, they learned of the approach of a 20,000-strong Fatimid army under vizier al-Afdal Shahanshah. Under Godfrey&#x27;s command the 10,200-strong Crusader army took the offensive, leaving the city on 10 August to risk everything on a great battle against the approaching Muslims. The Crusaders marched barefoot, carrying the relic of the True Cross with them, accompanied by patriarch Arnulf of Chocques. The army marched south from Jerusalem, approaching the vicinity of Ascalon on the 11th and capturing Egyptian spies who revealed al-Afdal&#x27;s dispositions and strength. (The distance from Jerusalem to Ascalon is about )

At dawn on 12 August, the Crusader army launched a surprise attack on the Fatimid army still sleeping in its camp outside the defensive walls of Ascalon. The Fatimids had failed to post enough guards, leaving only a part of their army capable of fighting. The Crusaders quickly defeated the half-ready Fatimid infantry, while the Fatimid cavalry had little contribution in the fighting. The battle ended in less than an hour. The Crusader knights reached the center of the camp, capturing the vizier&#x27;s standard and personal baggage, including his sword. Some Fatimids fled into the trees and were killed by Crusader arrows and lances, while others begged for mercy at the Crusaders&#x27; feet and were butchered &quot;en masse&quot;. The terrified vizier fled by ship to Egypt, leaving the Crusaders to kill any survivors and gather up a vast amount of loot. Ibn al-Qalanisi estimated 12,700 Fatimid dead, and mentioned that all Muslims with the means to do so chose to emigrate.

The first Muslim attempt to recapture Jerusalem ended in complete defeat, but Godfrey failed to exploit the victory and take Ascalon, whose Fatimid garrison was willing to surrender only to Raymond of Toulouse, a condition Godfrey would not accept. The Fatimid base in Ascalon remained a thorn in the side of the Kingdom of Jerusalem and would not fall until the siege of Ascalon of 1153.

==Background==

In 1097 the Fatimids of Egypt sought an agreement with the crusaders to fight against the Seljuk Empire in Syria. The Fatimids captured Jerusalem from the Seljuks in 1098. The crusaders had negotiated with the Fatimids during their march to Jerusalem, but no satisfactory compromise could be reached—the Fatimids were willing to give up control of Syria but not Palestine, but this was unacceptable to the crusaders, whose goal was the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. Jerusalem was captured from the Fatimids on July 15, 1099, after a long siege, and immediately the crusaders learned that a Fatimid army was on its way to besiege them.

The crusaders acted quickly. Godfrey of Bouillon was named &quot;Defender of the Holy Sepulchre&quot; on July 22, and Arnulf of Chocques, named patriarch of Jerusalem on August 1, discovered a relic of the True Cross on August 5. Fatimid ambassadors arrived to order the crusaders to leave Jerusalem, but they were ignored. On August 10 Godfrey led the remaining crusaders out of Jerusalem towards Ascalon, a day&#x27;s march away, while Peter the Hermit led both the Catholic and Greek Orthodox clergy in prayers and a procession from the Holy Sepulchre to the Temple. Robert II of Flanders and Arnulf accompanied Godfrey, but Raymond IV of Toulouse and Robert of Normandy stayed behind, either out of a quarrel with Godfrey or because they preferred to hear about the Egyptian army from their own scouts. When the Egyptian presence was confirmed, they marched out as well the next day. Near Ramla, they met Tancred and Godfrey&#x27;s brother Eustace, who had left to capture Nablus earlier in the month. At the head of the army, Arnulf carried the relic of the Cross, while Raymond of Aguilers carried the relic of the Holy Lance that had been discovered at Antioch the previous year.

==Battle==
The Fatimids were led by vizier al-Afdal Shahanshah, who commanded perhaps as many as 20,000 troops (other estimates include the exaggerated 200,000 of the &quot;Gesta Francorum&quot;). His army consisted of Seljuk Turks, Arabs, Persians, Armenians, Kurds, and Ethiopians. He was intending to besiege the crusaders in Jerusalem, although he had brought no siege machinery with him; he did however have a fleet, also assembling in the port of Ascalon. The precise number of crusaders is unknown, but the number given by Raymond of Aguilers is 1,200 knights and 9,000 infantry. The highest estimate is 20,000 men but this is surely impossible at this stage of the crusade. Al-Afdal camped in the plain of al-Majdal in a valley outside Ascalon, preparing to continue on to Jerusalem and besiege the crusaders there, apparently unaware that the crusaders had already left to meet him. On August 11 the crusaders found oxen, sheep, camels, and goats, gathered there to feed the Fatimid camp, grazing outside the city. According to captives taken by Tancred in a skirmish near Ramla, the animals were there to encourage the crusaders to disperse and pillage the land, making it easier for the Fatimids to attack. However, al-Afdal did not yet know the crusaders were in the area and was apparently not expecting them. In any case, these animals marched with them the next morning exaggerating the appearance of their army.

On the morning of the 12th, crusader scouts reported the location of the Fatimid camp and the army marched towards it. During the march the crusaders had been organized into nine divisions: Godfrey led the left wing, Raymond the right, and Tancred, Eustace, Robert of Normandy and Gaston IV of Béarn made up the centre; they were further divided into two smaller divisions, and a division of foot-soldiers marched ahead of each. This arrangement was also used as the line of battle outside Ascalon, with the center of the army between the Jerusalem and Jaffa Gates, the right aligned with the Mediterranean coast, and the left facing the Jaffa Gate.

According to most accounts (both Crusader and Muslim), the Fatimids were caught unprepared and the battle was short, but Albert of Aix states that the battle went on for some time with a fairly well prepared Egyptian army. The two main lines of battle fought each other with arrows until they were close enough to fight hand-to-hand with spears and other hand weapons. The Ethiopians attacked the centre of the crusader line, and the Fatimid vanguard was able to outflank the crusaders and surround their rearguard, until Godfrey arrived to rescue them. Despite his numerical superiority, al-Afdal&#x27;s army was hardly as strong or dangerous as the Seljuk armies that the crusaders had encountered previously. The battle seems to have been over before the Fatimid heavy cavalry was prepared to join it. Al-Afdal and his panicked troops fled back to the safety of the heavily fortified city; Raymond chased some of them into the sea, others climbed trees and were killed with arrows, while others were crushed in the retreat back into the gates of Ascalon. Al-Afdal left behind his camp and its treasures, which were captured by Robert and Tancred. Crusader losses are unknown, but the Egyptians lost 10,000 infantry and 2,700 residents of Ascalon, including militia, killed.

==Aftermath==
The crusaders spent the night in the abandoned camp, preparing for another attack, but in the morning they learned that the Fatimids were retreating to Egypt. Al-Afdal fled by ship. They took as much plunder as they could, including the Standard and al-Afdal&#x27;s personal tent, and burned the rest. They returned to Jerusalem on August 13, and after much celebration Godfrey and Raymond both claimed Ascalon. When the garrison learned of the dispute they refused to surrender. After the battle, almost all of the remaining crusaders returned to their homes in Europe, their vows of pilgrimage having been fulfilled. There were perhaps only a few hundred knights left in Jerusalem by the end of the year, but they were gradually reinforced by new crusaders, inspired by the success of the original crusade.

Although the battle of Ascalon was a crusader victory the city itself remained under Fatimid control, and it was eventually re-garrisoned. It became the base of operations for invasions of the Kingdom of Jerusalem every year afterwards, and numerous battles were fought there in the following years, until 1153 when it was finally captured by the crusaders in the Siege of Ascalon.

<text>William Jewett Tucker (July 13, 1839 – September 29, 1926) was an American Congregational minister who served as the 9th President of Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, United States, from 1893 to 1909.

== Dartmouth presidency ==
The &quot;New York City American&quot;, in a September 30, 1926 obituary notice, wrote of William Jewett Tucker that he &quot;was known in New England as &#x27;the great president,&#x27; who brought Dartmouth from the position of a small New Hampshire college to that of a great national educational institution.&quot; One of the college&#x27;s most beloved leaders, William Jewett Tucker was said to have &quot;refounded Dartmouth,&quot; bringing its facilities, its curriculum and every aspect of its organization into the modern era. When he assumed the presidency in 1893, the college was in debt, there were only slightly over 300 students and there was no central physical facilities plant. When he stepped down in 1909 more than 20 new buildings had been erected, including a central steam plant; the student body had grown to over 1,100 students from across the country and around the world; the faculty had increased from 26 to 81; and the curriculum had been broadened.

Tireless in his efforts to build the physical college, President Tucker was also equally devoted to articulating a moral and spiritual dimension for Dartmouth and for higher education nationwide. In numerous books and essays he called for a liberalization of American theology and commitment to public service.

William Jewett Tucker graduated from Dartmouth in 1861 and studied for the ministry at Andover Theological Seminary. Ordained in 1867, he was a Congregational pastor in Manchester, New Hampshire, and, later, in New York City. He returned to Andover in 1879 as professor of sacred rhetoric and became an editor of the &quot;Andover Review&quot; and a founder of The South End House, one of Boston&#x27;s first settlement houses for the poor. At Andover, he was a central figure in the &quot;Andover controversy&quot; of 1886–92, when charges were filed against five professors calling for a liberalization of Congregational views. In 1890, the Supreme Court of Massachusetts declared the proceedings &quot;faulty&quot;; in 1892, all five professors, Tucker included, were &quot;acquitted.&quot;

William Jewett Tucker retired from the Dartmouth presidency in 1909 and became president emeritus. Although retired, he remained an active figure on the public stage and lived in Hanover until his death in 1926.

The William Jewett Tucker Center, commonly known as the Tucker Center, at Dartmouth College, is named after President Tucker.

<doc id="1169181" wikidata="Q137641" url="?curid=1169181" title="Spectacled bear">
<text>The spectacled bear (Tremarctos ornatus), also known as the South American bear, Andean bear, Andean short-faced bear or mountain bear and locally as jukumari (Aymara and Quechua), ukumari (Quechua) or ukuku, is a species of bear native to the Andes Mountains in northern and western South America. It is the only living species of bear native to South America, and the last remaining short-faced bear (subfamily Tremarctinae). Its closest relatives are the extinct &quot;Tremarctos floridanus&quot;, and the giant short-faced bears (&quot;Arctodus&quot; and &quot;Arctotherium&quot;), which became extinct at the end of the Pleistocene around 12,000 years ago. Unlike other omnivorous bears, the diet of the spectacled bear is mostly herbivorous. The species is classified as Vulnerable by the IUCN because of habitat loss.

==Description==

The spectacled bear is the only bear native to South America and is the largest land carnivore in that part of the world, although as little as 5% of its diet is composed of meat. Among South America&#x27;s extant, native land animals, only the Baird&#x27;s tapir, South American tapir and mountain tapir are heavier than the bear.

The spectacled bear is a mid-sized species of bear. Overall, its fur is blackish in colour, though bears may vary from jet black to dark brown and to even a reddish hue. The species typically has distinctive beige or ginger-coloured markings across its face and upper chest, though not all spectacled bears have &quot;spectacle&quot; markings. The pattern and extent of pale markings are slightly different on each individual bear, and bears can be readily distinguished by this. Males are a third larger than females in dimensions and sometimes twice their weight. Males can weigh from , and females can weigh from . Head-and-body length can range from , though mature males do not measure less than . On average males weigh about and females average about , thus it rivals the polar bear for the most sexually dimorphic modern bear. A male in captivity that was considered obese weighed . The tail is a mere in length, and the shoulder height is from . Compared to other living bears, this species has a more rounded face with a relatively short and broad snout. In some extinct species of the Tremarctinae subfamily, this facial structure has been thought to be an adaptation to a largely carnivorous diet, despite the modern spectacled bears&#x27; herbivorous dietary preferences.

The spectacled bear&#x27;s sense of smell is extremely sensitive. They can perceive from the ground when a tree is loaded with ripe fruit. On the other hand, their hearing is moderate and their vision is short.

==Distribution and habitat==
Despite some rare spilling-over into eastern Panama, spectacled bears are mostly restricted to specific regions in northern and western South America. They can range in western Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, western Bolivia, and northwestern Argentina. Its elongated geographical distribution is only wide but with a length of more than .

The species is found almost entirely in the Andes Mountains. Before spectacled bear populations became fragmented during the last 500 years, the species had a reputation for being adaptable, as it is found in a wide variety of habitats and altitudes throughout its range, including cloud forests, high-altitude grasslands, dry forests and scrub deserts. A single spectacled bear population on the border of Peru and Ecuador inhabited as great a range of habitat types as the world&#x27;s brown bears (&quot;Ursus arctos&quot;) now occupy. The best habitats for spectacled bears are humid to very humid montane forests. These cloud forests typically occupy a elevational band between depending on latitude. Generally, the wetter these forests are the more food species there are that can support bears. Occasionally, they may reach altitudes as low as , but are not typically found below in the foothills. They can even range up to the mountain snow line at over in elevation. Therefore, it is well known that bears use all these types of habitats in regional movements; however, the seasonal patterns of these movements are still unknown.

Nowadays, the distribution area of the &quot;Tremarctos ornatus&quot; is influenced by the human presence, mainly due to habitat destruction and degradation, hunting and fragmentation of populations. This fragmentation is mainly found in Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador and Argentina. It represents several problems to this population because, first, their persistence is compromised if they are small, isolated populations, even without facing habitat lost or hunting. Second, the transformation of the landscape represents loss of availability of the type of habitats spectacled bears need. Third, fragmentation exposes bears to hunting and killing due to its accessibility.
==Naming and etymology==
&quot;Tremarctos ornatus&quot; is commonly referred to in English as the &quot;spectacled bear&quot;, a reference to the light colouring on its chest, neck and face, which may resemble spectacles in some individuals, or the &quot;Andean bear&quot; for its distribution along the Andes. The root &quot;trem&quot;- comes from a Greek word meaning &quot;hole&quot;; &quot;arctos&quot; is the Greek word for &quot;bear&quot;. &quot;Tremarctos&quot; is a reference to an unusual hole on the animal&#x27;s humerus. , Latin for &quot;decorated&quot;, is a reference to the markings that give the bear its common English name.

==Phylogeny== 
A 2007 investigation into the mitochondrial DNA of bear species indicates that the subfamily Tremarctinae, which includes the extant spectacled bear, diverged from the Ursinae subfamily approximately 5.7 million years ago. Tremarctinae includes the extinct American giant short-faced and Florida short-faced bears.

==Behaviour and diet==
Spectacled bears are one of four extant bear species that are habitually arboreal, alongside the American black bear (&quot;Ursus americanus&quot;) and Asian black bear (&quot;U. thibetanus&quot;), and the sun bear (&quot;Helarctos malayanus&quot;). In Andean cloud forests, spectacled bears may be active both during the day and night, but 
specimens in the Peruvian desert are reported to bed down under vegetative cover during the day. Their continued survival alongside humans has depended mostly on their ability to climb even the tallest trees of the Andes. They usually retreat from the presence of humans, often by climbing trees. Once up a tree, they may often build a platform, perhaps to aid in concealment, as well as to rest and store food on. Although spectacled bears are solitary and tend to isolate themselves from one another to avoid competition, they are not territorial. They have even been recorded to feed in small groups at abundant food sources. Males are reported to have an average home range of during the wet season and during the dry season. Females are reported to have an average home range of in the wet season and in the dry season.

When encountered by humans or other spectacled bears, they will react in a docile but cautious manner, unless the intruder is seen as a threat or a mother&#x27;s cubs are endangered. Like other bears, mothers are protective of their young and have attacked poachers. There is only a single reported human death due to a spectacled bear, which occurred while it was being hunted and was already shot. The only predators of cubs include cougars (&quot;Puma concolor&quot;) and possibly male spectacled bears. The bears &quot;appear to avoid&quot; jaguars, but the jaguar has considerably different habitat preferences, does not overlap with the spectacled bear in altitude on any specific mountain slope, and only overlaps slightly (900m) in altitude if the entire Cordillera Oriental is considered based upon unpublished data. Generally, the only threat against adult bears is humans. The longest-lived captive bear, at the Salisbury Zoological Park (United States)|Salisbury Zoo, In Salisbury Maryland, in the US, attained a lifespan of 37 years and 11 months. Lifespan in the wild has not been studied, but bears are believed to commonly live to 20 years or more unless they run foul of humans.

Spectacled bears are more herbivorous than most other bears; normally about 5 to 7% of their diets is meat. The most common foods for these bears include cactus, bromeliads (especially &quot;Puya&quot; ssp., &quot;Tillandsia&quot; ssp. and &quot;Guzmania&quot; ssp.) palm nuts, bamboo hearts, frailejon (&quot;Espeletia&quot; spp.), orchid bulbs, fallen fruit on the forest floor, unopened palm leaves, and moss. They will also peel back tree bark to eat the nutritious second layer. Much of this vegetation is very tough to open or digest for most animals, and the bear is one of the few species in its range to exploit these food sources. The spectacled bear has the largest zygomatic mandibular muscles relative to its body size and the shortest muzzle of any living bear, slightly surpassing the relative size of the giant panda&#x27;s (&quot;Ailuropoda melanoleuca&quot;) morphology here. Not coincidentally, both species are known for extensively consuming tough, fibrous plants. Unlike the ursid bears whose fourth premolar has a more well-developed protoconid, an adaptation for shearing flesh, the fourth premolar of spectacled bears has blunt lophs with three pulp cavities instead of two, and can have three roots instead of the two that characterize ursid bears. The musculature and tooth characteristics are designed to support the stresses of grinding and crushing vegetation. Besides the giant panda, the spectacled bear is perhaps the most herbivorous living bear species. These bears also eat agricultural products, such as sugarcane (&quot;Saccharum&quot; ssp.), honey (made by &quot;Apis&quot; ssp.), and maize (&quot;Zea mays&quot;), and have been known to travel above the tree line for berries and more ground-based bromeliads. When food is abundant, such as large corn fields, up to nine individual bears have fed close by each other in a single vicinity.

Animal prey is usually quite small, but these bears can prey on adult deer, llama (&quot;Lama glama&quot;) and domestic cattle (&quot;Bos taurus&quot;) and horses (&quot;Equus caballus&quot;). A spectacled bear was captured on a remote video-monitor predaceously attacking an adult mountain tapir perhaps nearly twice its own body mass, and adult horse and cattle killed by spectacled bears have been even heavier. Animal prey has included rabbits, mice, other rodents, birds at the nest (especially ground-nesting birds like tinamous or lapwings (&quot;Vanellus&quot; ssp.), arthropods, and carrion. They are occasionally accused of killing livestock, especially cattle, and raiding corn fields. Allegedly, some bears become habituated to eating cattle, but the bears are actually more likely to eat cattle as carrion and some farmers may accidentally assume the spectacled bear killed them. Due to fear of loss of stock, bears may be killed on sight.

==Reproduction==

Most of the information available about the reproduction of this species has been through observation of captive animals. In captivity, mating is concentrated in between February and September, according to the latitude, and, in the wild, it has been seen how mating may occur at almost any time of the year, but activity normally peaks in April and June, at the beginning of the wet season and corresponding with the peak of fruit-ripening. The mating pair are together for one to two weeks, during which they will copulate multiple times for 12–45 minutes at a time. The courtship is based on games and non-aggressive fights while intercourse can be accompanied by loud sounds from both animals.

In the wild, births usually occur in the dry season, between December and February. However, in captivity, it occurs all year within the species&#x27; distribution. The gestation period is 5.5 to 8.5 months. From one to three cubs may be born, with four being rare and two being the average. The cubs are born with their eyes closed and weigh about each. Although this species does not give birth during the hibernation cycle as do northern bear species, births usually occur in a small den and the female waits until the cubs can see and walk before she leaves with them, this occurs in between three and four months after birth.

Females grow more slowly than males. The size of the litter has been positively correlated with both the weight of the female and the abundance and variety of food sources, particularly the degree to which fruiting is temporally predictable. The cubs often stay with the female for one year before striking out on their own. This is related to the time mothers breastfeed (1 year), but keep providing maternal care for an additional year. Breeding maturity is estimated to be reached at between four and seven years of age for both sexes, based solely on captive bears. Females usually give birth for the first time when they are 5 years old and their fecundity is shorter than that of the males, who keep fertility almost all their lives. Something that is in favor of the subsistence of the bear population is their longevity, since they are able to raise at least two cubs to adulthood, contributing to population replacement. Wild bears can live for an average of 20 years.

==Conservation==

===Threats===

The Andean bear is threatened due to poaching and habitat loss, attributable to agricultural expansion and illegal mining. Poaching might have several reasons: trophy hunting, pet trade, religious or magical beliefs, natural products trade and conflicts with humans.

Trophy hunting of Andean bear was apparently popular during the 19th century in some rural areas of Latin-America. In the costumbrist novel &quot;María&quot; by Colombian writer Jorge Isaacs, it was portrayed as an activity for privileged young men in Colombia. Tales regarding pet bears are also known from documents about the Ecuadorian aristocracy of that time. These threats might have diminished in recent years, but there are still isolated reports of captive bears confiscated in rural areas, which usually are unable to adapt again to their natural habitat and must be kept in zoological facilities.

Religious or magical beliefs might be motivations for killing Andean bears, especially in places where bears are related to myths of disappearing women or children, or where bear parts are related to traditional medicine or superstitions. In this context, the trade of bear parts might have commercial value. Their gall bladders appear to be valued in traditional Chinese medicine and can fetch a high price on the international market. Conflicts with humans, however, appear to be the most common cause of poaching in large portions of its distribution. Andean Bears are often suspected of attacking cattle and raiding crops, and are killed for retaliation or in order to avoid further damages. It has been argued that attacks to cattle attributed to Andean bear are partly due to other predators. Raiding of crops can be frequent in areas with diminishing natural resources and extensive crops in former bear habitat, or when problematic individuals get used to human environments.

The intensity of poaching can create ecological traps for Andean bears. That is, if bears are attracted to areas of high habitat quality that are also high in poaching risk.

Perhaps the most epidemic problem for the species is extensive logging and farming, which has led to habitat loss for the largely tree-dependent bears. Shortage of natural food sources might push bears to feed on crops or livestock, increasing the conflict that usually results in poaching of individuals. Impacts of climate changes on bear habitat and food sources are not fully understood, but might have potential negative impact in the near future.

As stated, one of the major limitations to the viability of bear populations is human-caused mortality, mainly poaching and habitat loss; but the other big limitation is population size. Therefore, the most effective actions for their viability will be to increase population size and decrease poaching. For these actions to be effective, it is needed to understand where they are carried out, identifying areas where habitat protection and landscape management are realistically capable of maintaining large bear populations.

==== Perception of the Andean bear ====
There are two views of the Andean Bears. One is ex-situ, people that live far from where the bears inhabit; for them, the spectacled bears are usually charismatic symbols of the wilderness, animals that are not aggressive and that are mainly vegetarians.  The other view is in-situ, people that live in areas where the bears inhabit; for them, bears are cattle predators, pests that should be killed as a preventative measure and where any cattle loss is immediately attributed to them, becoming persecuted and hunted.

=== Conservation actions and plans ===
The IUCN has recommended the following courses for spectacled bear conservation: expansion and implementation of conservation land to prevent further development, greater species level research and monitoring of trends and threats, more concerted management of current conservation areas, stewardship programs for bears which engage local residents and the education of the public regarding spectacled bears, especially the benefits of conserving the species due to its effect on natural resources.

National governments, NGOs and rural communities have made different commitments to conservation of this species along its distribution. Conservation actions in Venezuela date back to the early 1990s, and have been based mostly on environmental education at several levels and the establishment of protected areas. The effort of several organisations has led to a widespread recognition of the Andean bear in Venezuelan society, raising it as an emblematic species of conservation efforts in the country, and to the establishment of a 10-year action plan. Evidence regarding the objective effectiveness of these programs (like reducing poaching risk, maintaining population viability, and reducing extinction risk) is subject to debate and needs to be further evaluated.

Legislation against bear hunting exists, but is rarely enforced. This leads to persistence of the poaching problem, even inside protected areas.

In 2006, the Spectacled Bear Conservation Society was established in Peru to study and protect the spectacled bear.

==== Spectacled bear and protected areas ====
To evaluate the protected status of the Andean bears researchers evaluated the percentage of their habitats included in national and protected areas in 1998.  This evaluation showed that only 18.5% of the bear range was located in 58 protected areas, highlighting that many of them were small, especially those in the northern Andes. The largest park had an area of while the median size of 43 parks from Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador was , which may result too small to maintain a sustainable bear population.  Therefore, these researchers stated the importance of the creation of habitat blocks outside protected areas since they might provide opportunities for the protection of these animals.

==== Other suggested conservation strategies ====

Researchers suggest the following spectacled bear conservation strategies:

* Protect high-quality habitats while maintaining connectivity between their different elevational zones. In reality, it is not possible to manage all the undisturbed habitat the bears need in the long term. As such, it is important to identify those high-quality habitats that maximize biodiversity gain.
* Alleviate human-bear conflicts through conflict management, thinking about the spatial configuration of this animal habitat.
* Mitigate human impacts on protected areas through the design of comprehensive management strategies.
* Sustain landscape diversity in the bear conservation study areas to ensure them food and seasonal access to resources in all the habitats they frequent.
* Maintain bear population connectivity, emphasizing those conservation areas that connect different ecosystems, such as the cloud forest and the paramo.
* Rethink roads: where they are built, how and with what purpose, understanding that they define the macro configuration of bear habitat and are a barrier for bear movements and population connectivity.
* Integrate hydrological criteria at a landscape scale will benefit bears and other biotic communities that associate with aquatic environments, including humans. Linking bear habitat conservation and water management can be effective for the development of conservation strategies that benefit all.
*In places where it is almost impossible to establish new protected areas due mainly to the fact that many people already live in the area, the creation of natural corridors is possibly the best tool for the conservation of species with migratory patterns such as the endangered Andean bear.

=== Spectacled bear in Ecuador ===
Spectacled bears in Ecuador live in approximately of paramo and cloud forest habitats. About one-third of this area is part of the National System of Protected Areas and the remaining 67% is located on unprotected, undeveloped areas that have suffered a substantial reduction of approximately 40% from its original distribution.

Due to this land-use conversion to agricultural uses, important amounts of the spectacled bear habitat have been lost. This has fragmented their territory and isolated populations to small areas that might result in extirpations in the long term. Therefore, the distribution of the species in the country is set in numerous habitat patches, from which many are small.

==In popular culture==
*The children&#x27;s character Paddington Bear is a spectacled bear from Peru.
* Stephen Fry authored a book, &quot;Rescuing the Spectacled Bear: A Peruvian Diary&quot;, following two BBC programmes documenting him visiting Peru to participate in rescuing a couple of spectacled bears.

<doc id="1169189" wikidata="Q1585666" url="?curid=1169189" title="King Leodegrance">
<text>King Leodegrance , sometimes Leondegrance, Leodogran, or variations thereof, is the father of Queen Guinevere in Arthurian legend. His kingdom of Cameliard (or Carmelide) is usually identified with Cornwall but may be located in Breton Cornouaille near the town of Carhaix-Plouguer, which is the Carhaise of &quot;L&#x27;Histoire de Merlin&quot; (13th century). 

Leodegrance had served Uther Pendragon, King Arthur&#x27;s biological father and regnal predecessor. Leodegrance was entrusted with the keeping of the Round Table at Uther&#x27;s death. When Guinevere marries Arthur, Leodegrance gives the young king the table as a wedding present. In later romance Leodegrance is one of the few kings who accept Arthur as his overlord. For this, his land is invaded by the rebel king Rience, but Arthur comes to his rescue and expels the enemy. Arthur meets Guinevere for the first time during this excursion, and they develop a love that eventually results in their fateful marriage.

According to the Lancelot-Grail prose cycle, Leodegrance fathered a second daughter out of wedlock; he also names this child Guinevere. The &quot;False Guinevere&quot; later treacherously convinces Arthur&#x27;s court that she is his real wife and her sister is an impostor, forcing the real queen and her lover Lancelot into hiding with their friend Galehaut. Guinevere eventually returns and reclaims her throne.

In Welsh mythology, the father of Gwenhwyfar (Guinevere) is the giant Ogyruan/Ogyrvan or Gogyrfan, who is mentioned in a number of Middle Welsh texts.

==In popular culture==
Leodegrance was portrayed by Patrick Stewart in the 1981 film &quot;Excalibur&quot; and by Daragh O&#x27;Malley in the 2011 television series &quot;Camelot&quot;.
