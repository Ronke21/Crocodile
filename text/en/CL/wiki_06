<text>The nonprofit National Ski Patrol (NSP) is the largest winter education organization in the world. The NSP provides education, outreach, and credentialing related to outdoor recreation and safety. It is currently composed of more than 31,000 members who serve in over 650 patrols. NSP members, both volunteer and paid, ensure the safety of outdoor recreation enthusiasts in ski areas throughout the United States of America and certain military areas of Europe. For its dedication to the promotion of public safety in skiing and other winter sports, the group was granted a congressional charter under Title 36 of the United States Code in 1980.

==History==
The National Ski Patrol was founded in 1938 in Stowe, Vermont, when the president of the National Ski Association, Roger Langley convinced the founder and leader of the Mt. Mansfield Ski Patrol, Charles Minot Dole, to form a national ski patrol. Dole was convinced of the need for a national ski rescue organization due to both the loss of a friend due to injuries suffered in a ski related accident the year prior and an on slope accident in which he himself was seriously injured. With Roger Langley&#x27;s assistance, Charles Minot Dole organized and formed the National Ski Patrol Committee of the National Ski Association. The resulting organization became the National Ski Patrol. Upon his retirement in 1950 as president, Dole had built the NSP into an organization of 300 ski patrols and 4,000 members. Since its founding, the National Ski Patrol has worked closely with other countries in outdoor emergency care education, and has assisted in establishing ski patrol organizations in Canada, Korea, New Zealand, Israel, Turkey, Argentina and Chile, as well as the Victorian Rescue Service in Australia. In addition to its own ski safety programs, works closely with the United States Ski Team, Professional Ski Instructors of America, US Forest Service, National Park Service, and other organizations and agencies in the promotion of skiing and ski safety.

=== Activities During World War II ===
Beginning in February 1940, Charles Minot Dole began writing to officials in the United States Army and the War Department about the need for specialized mountain troops. Dole had been inspired by Finnish efforts during the Winter War, and believed the United States should train specialized soldiers to fight in winter and alpine conditions. Due to the lobbying efforts by Charles Minot Dole, in November 1941 the National Ski Patrol was appointed by the United States Army to recruit and vet soldiers for the 87th Mountain Infantry Regiment. The National Ski Patrol continued in this capacity until February 1944, by which time it had recruited around 8,000 soldiers for the 87th Regiment and eventually the 10th Mountain Division. The National Ski Patrol also assisted in training for the new troops.

==Membership==
Membership within the NSP falls under five individual categories: patrollers, medical associates, alumni members, associate members, and mountain hosts. Patrollers are those members who are actively involved in providing emergency care to injured guests and are members of a local patrol affiliated with the NSP. Medical associates are physicians who volunteer their time to assist with medical training of patrollers. Patrollers who are no longer actively involved in providing emergency care to injured guests are able to maintain their affiliation with the NSP as alumni members. Associate members are personnel who are interested in courses offered by the NSP but are not members of a ski patrol. The mountain host category of membership is reserved for individuals who participate in on mountain customer service, are expected to be able to render first aid, but not part of an organization&#x27;s ski patrol.

==Educational Programs==
Pursuant to its mission of promoting outdoor recreation safety, the NSP has developed a number of educational programs designed to increase safety awareness and injury prevention.

===Outdoor Emergency Care (OEC)===
===Transportation===
The transportation education program is designed to teach members of the NSP safe techniques for the transportation of sick or injured guests from the wilderness to safety. Specific skills taught through the NSP system include safe toboggan handling, ski enhancement, and snowboard enhancement.

===Avalanche Program===
The NSP began instructing ski patrollers and other search and rescue personnel in avalanche safety in 1957, making it the oldest and most experienced provider of avalanche education. In addition to courses designed for the ski patroller and the search and rescue personnel, the NSP offers avalanche education to the general public. NSP avalanche education courses are based on curriculum developed in conjunction with the American Avalanche Association.

===Mountain Travel and Rescue===
Developed to improve safety of non-patroller outdoor enthusiasts, the mountain travel and rescue program emphasizes skills necessary to survive in the wilderness These skills include nutrition, wilderness physiology, weather patterns, survival skills, group dynamics, navigation, and basic search and rescue skills. This program is designed to ensure that those who venture into the wilderness have the necessary skills to do so safely.

==Ski Patrollers==

Patrollers are those members of the NSP who, as part of a ski patrol organization, provide assistance to ill or injured guests at a mountain area. To recognize and develop a continued commitment to patroller education and excellence, the NSP classifies patrollers based on completion of NSP approved courses. The classification schema is as follows:
*Candidate refers to a member who has just joined but not passed the Outdoor Emergency Care (OEC) course. 
*Patroller refers to any member of a patrol organization who has completed the Outdoor Emergency Care (OEC) course. Unlike other classifications, ski or snowboarding skills are not necessary. While patrollers may provide first aid and assistance to ill or injured guests, they are not authorized to transport guests in rescue toboggans.
*Alpine Patroller and Nordic Patroller: are classifications used for patrollers who have passed OEC and have completed transportation education and are authorized to transport ill or injured guests in rescue toboggans. Alpine patroller refers to those patrollers who are authorized to transport patients in rescue toboggans while using alpine skiing (downhill) equipment. Nordic patroller refers to those patrollers who are authorized to transport patients in rescue toboggans while using nordic skiing (cross country) equipment.
*Senior Patroller refers to those patrollers who have completed additional training in emergency management in addition to that taught through OEC. A senior patroller may or may not be authorized to transport ill or injured guests in rescue toboggans. Those that have previously completed transportation education (alpine and nordic patrollers) maintain this ability, whereas those that have not (patrollers) may not transport guests.
*Senior Alpine Patroller and Senior Nordic Patroller are alpine patrollers and nordic patrollers who have completed additional training in emergency management (that taught to senior patrollers) and who have completed additional transportation education and can demonstrate skills not required of the alpine or nordic patroller.
*Certified Patroller and Master Nordic Patroller refer to the highest level of certification offered by the NSP for alpine and nordic patrollers respectively. In addition to emergency management and transportation skills, certified patrollers and master nordic patrollers must demonstrate excellence in all areas of patrol operations including avalanche safety and resort management.
*Young Adult Patroller is a program which provides a learning environment where young adults can develop skills and knowledge to become a Patroller. Young Adult Patrollers (YAP) are NSP members (ages 15 through high school graduation) who complete all of the required training and responsibilities of adult members of their patrol, we well as special training and events geared towards the YAPs within the region.

<text>Leonard Malcolm Saville (21 February 1901–30 June 1982) was an English writer best known for the &quot;Lone Pine&quot; series of children&#x27;s books, many of which are set in Shropshire. His work emphasises location; the books include many vivid descriptions of English countryside, villages and sometimes towns.

==Early life and career==
He was born in Hastings, Sussex, and was educated at Richmond Hill School, in Richmond, Surrey. His working life began at Oxford University Press in 1918, then continued as a publicist with Cassell &amp; Co (1920–1922), Associated Press (1922–1936), and George Newnes Ltd (1936–1941). He was also the associate editor of &quot;My Garden&quot; magazine, before taking over editorship of &quot;Sunny Stories&quot; from Enid Blyton in 1954, when she left to set up her own magazine in direct competition.

Saville&#x27;s writing career, from 1943 to 1982, was initially a diversion from his working life. His first book, &quot;Mystery at Witchend&quot;, was set in Shropshire, a county he had first visited in 1936, and was written when his children had been evacuated to the county from the family home in Hertfordshire. It was adapted for BBC radio broadcast in 1943, and was followed by a further 19 children&#x27;s books in the &quot;Lone Pine&quot; series, the last one published in 1978. Several of his 90 books were serialised for broadcast on radio, many on &quot;Children&#x27;s Hour&quot;, and his 1953 book &quot;The Ambermere Treasure&quot;, part of the Jillies series, was serialised by Associated-Rediffusion, the first commercial television company to broadcast in the United Kingdom, in late 1955 and early 1956; it was therefore one of the first ITV children&#x27;s drama series. Saville also wrote many short stories and magazine articles.

==Personal life==
His marriage to Dorothy (née McCoy) in 1926 produced four children. Saville had strong moral convictions, and was a practising Christian.

He died in Hastings in 1982, aged 81.

<text>Finnish rock (Finnish: &quot;suomirock&quot; or &quot;suomirokki&quot;—also known as Finnsrock, Finnrock or Finrock) is rock music made in Finland. The initial rock and roll boom of the 1950s was preceded by a long tradition of popular culture. &quot;Suomirock&quot; may refer to Finnish rock music in general or more narrowly rock music sung in the Finnish language.

==Timeline==
Finnish rock followed the common trends during the 50s and 60s. Usually Finnish rock bands performed covers or hit songs translated into Finnish. Eero Raittinen and his brother Jussi Raittinen are among the earliest rockers of the 1960s, alongside groups such as Jormas, Topmost and Ernos. The British band The Renegades found their biggest success in the 1960s Finland. Helsinki was the centre of Finnish rock and pop music during this period. Love Records was one of the first domestic record labels dedicated to Finnish rock, even though the label&#x27;s roster also included jazz and political songs. Suomen Talvisota 1939-1940 represented Finnish underground, and their only album &quot;Underground-Rock&quot; (1970) is cited as a big influence among many current Finnish music-makers. Other Finnish underground/psychedelic bands of this era were The Sperm, Apollo and the ground-breaking Blues Section, which spawned Wigwam and Tasavallan Presidentti after its split.

At the beginning of the 1970s new artists emerged. Singer-songwriters such as Hector and Juice Leskinen started writing songs in Finnish, combining shades of irony, poetry and introspection with rock sound. Later in the seventies the new wave and punk brought more artists such as Pelle Miljoona, Eppu Normaali and Hassisen kone. Finnish rock had by now become independent. Names such as Dave Lindholm, Tuomari Nurmio and Ismo Alanko continued with their own styles. Tampere became at the turn of the 1970s and 80s the most vibrant town in rock culture, spawning &quot;Manserock&quot; as rock music by the town&#x27;s artists was called.

Hurriganes, fronted by Remu Aaltonen, was one of the best-known groups in Finland. This 1970s group played hard-hitting, boogie-based simple rock, and their song &quot;Get on&quot; is almost anthemic in Finland. Ex-Hurriganes guitarist Albert Järvinen would later collaborate with the likes of Lemmy Kilmister of Motörhead fame, issuing the &quot;Countdown&quot; 12&quot; single, with Lemmy featuring on lead vocals on the title track, under the name of Albert Järvinen Band. Other seminal groups were Dingo, a pop-rock group idolized by teenagers, and Yö, whose &quot;Joutsenlaulu&quot; remains to the day one of the most played songs in radio and karaoke. Kingston Wall was a cult band of the early 90s, combining psychedelic influences with hard rock, played by power trio and fronted by Petri Walli. J. Karjalainen has also remained popular since the early 1980s. Well-known Finnish band CMX also formed in 1985, transforming from a hardcore punk sound through progressive, metal, and hard rock sounds.

==Success abroad==

The earliest Finnish rock bands to gain any notoriety were progressive rock bands like Tasavallan Presidentti and Wigwam. Though for a time they seemed poised to break through in Europe, international fame eluded them. 1980s bands were similarly unable to find an international following, such as Gringos Locos and Havana Black; one exception to this was Hanoi Rocks, a popular glam rock band. They are still the most respected Finnish group abroad. For example, in Japan there&#x27;s still almost fanatic Hanoi Rocks fans. Though the band collapsed on the verge of final international breakthrough, they were the source of inspiration for glam rock bands of the 1980s including Guns N&#x27; Roses.

Some modern bands who have achieved some mainstream rock success abroad include Leningrad Cowboys, known for performing with the Red Army Choir, surf band Laika &amp; the Cosmonauts and prog-related rock band Von Hertzen Brothers.

22-Pistepirkko has had a cult status in Europe, notably in the Netherlands and Germany. The trio&#x27;s indie-rock incorporates blues and melancholy melodies, with a touch of Tom Waits.

==Heavy metal==
Like much of Scandinavia (or, more accurately Fennoscandia), Finland&#x27;s main contribution to modern popular music may be heavy metal and related fields. Early 80s Finnish hard rock and heavy metal bands of note include Riff Raff, Oz, and Zero Nine while pioneers Tarot, Stratovarius and thrashers Stone would first emerge in the late 80s. Since then the Finnish scene has given rise to bands like Children of Bodom, Amorphis, Nightwish, Apocalyptica, Impaled Nazarene, Beherit, Archgoat, Waltari, Entwine, The 69 Eyes, Sinergy, Sentenced, Sonata Arctica, Am I Blood, Ensiferum, Turisas, Moonsorrow, Korpiklaani, Finntroll, Wintersun, Battlelore, Machine Men, Mannhai, To/Die/For, Battle Beast, Falchion, Beast in Black and Teräsbetoni.

A popular Finnish band abroad is HIM whose music has been labeled &quot;love metal&quot;. HIM and The Rasmus topped album charts in several European countries with their most popular albums. HIM got also a gold record in the USA in 2006. The international success of HIM and The Rasmus during the current decade is wider than any Finnish group has gotten before.

Finland were also the winners of the 2006 Eurovision Song Contest, with the first heavy metal band to enter the competition, Lordi. Lordi won with their Hard Rock Hallelujah composition, sporting elaborate costumes. Since then, they have found success across Europe and limited publicity outside of the continent. Lordi have also competed in Kuorosota, the Finnish version of Clash of the Choirs.

Throughout the Finland and Scandinavian countries there has been an uprising of 80s era &quot;glam metal&quot; bands heavily influenced by bands like Mötley Crüe and Guns N&#x27; Roses with a modern twist like Reckless Love, Santa Cruz, Crashdïet and Hardcore Superstar.

==Extreme metal==
Finland, like its Scandinavian neighbors, also has a vibrant extreme metal scene, which while propagating a more underground and slightly less accessible sound is still notably not only internationally successful but also on a few occasions giving the more mainstream heavy metal bands competition in the nation&#x27;s awards ceremonies. The most famous Finnish bands in extreme metal are most probably Amorphis, Children of Bodom, Beherit, Archgoat, Impaled Nazarene, and the grindcore band Rotten Sound, which recently signed to the renowned American label Relapse Records.

The extreme metal scene in Finland is highly dominated by death metal of various subgenres ranging from melodic death metal such as Omnium Gatherum to more old school traditional death metal bands like Demilich and Convulse, the second of whose first album has been thrice reissued by the aforementioned Relapse Records—most recently in 2013—as well as by Finland’s own Svart Records in both 2018 and 2019.

<text>Hatta () was a Palestinian Arab village of 1,125 inhabitants that was depopulated after a July 17, 1948 assault by Israeli forces of the Givati Brigade during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. Following the war the area was incorporated into the State of Israel and Zavdiel and Aluma were established on the land that had belonged to Hatta.

==Location==
The village was situated in a flat area on the southern coastal plain. It was probably named after the al-Hut tribe, originally from Najd in central Arabia, who camped near the site at the end of the fifth century A.D.

==History==
The Arab geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi (d. 1228) referred to the village as Hattawa and said it was the home of the Islamic scholar ´Amru al-Hattawi.

The village&#x27;s residents came from Egypt, Transjordan and the Hejaz.

===Ottoman era===
Hatta, like the rest of Palestine, was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517, and in the tax registers of 1596 it appeared under the name of &quot;Hatta as-Sajara&quot; as being in the &quot;nahiya&quot; of Gazza, part of the Sanjak of Gaza. It had a population of 15 households, all Muslim. The inhabitants paid a fixed tax rate of 25% on wheat, barley, sesame, goats and/or beehives; a total of 5,600 akçe.

During the 17th and 18th centuries, the area of Hatta experienced a significant process of settlement decline due to nomadic pressures on local communities. The residents of abandoned villages moved to surviving settlements, but the land continued to be cultivated by neighboring villages.

Edward Robinson passed by the village in 1838, and described its houses as being made of adobe bricks. It was also noted as a Muslim village in the Gaza district.

In 1863 Victor Guérin visited the village, which he estimated to have 600 inhabitants. He noticed that beside the well were four barrels of broken columns, three gray-white marble, and the fourth of bluish marble. The latter, placed horizontally at the orifice was deeply furrowed by the rope that animals or men had used to raise the water. In a oualy dedicated to Neby Amran he noticed some stones with the same ancient look.
Around the village were large plantations of tobacco, here and there also stood several groups of beautiful pine, olive and fig trees.

An Ottoman village list of about 1870 showed that Hatta had 78 houses and a population of 211, though the population count included only men.

In 1883 the PEF&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; (SWP) described the village as being surrounded by gardens, some of which contained a few tamarisk trees. SWP also wrote that the name &quot;Hatteh&quot; preserved the name of the Hittites.

===British Mandate era===
In the 1922 census of Palestine, conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Hatta had a population of 570 Muslims, increasing in the 1931 census to 646, still all Muslim, in 140 houses.

In the 1945 statistics Hatta had a population of 970 Muslims, with 5,305 dunams of land, according to an official land and population survey. Of this, 4 dunams were plantations and irrigable land, 5,108 used for cereals, while 45 dunams were built-up land.


===1948 and after===

Hatta was captured on July 17–18, 1948, during Operation Death to the Invader, the last operation of the Ten Days period—the period between the two ceasefires of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Following the war the area was incorporated into the State of Israel and in August 1948 a moshav named Revaha was slated to be built on the site. However, the plan was not implemented until 1953. Another moshav, Zavdiel was established in 1950 on village land, while Aluma was founded on village land in 1965. Qomemiyyut and Rewacha are both close by, but not on village land.
Walid Khalidi described the village site in 1992: &quot;A small portion of the site is covered by a forest, planted by Israelis. The debris of houses are scattered under the trees. Sycamore trees and cactuses also grow on the site. The surrounding lands are cultivated. The British built military airport is still in use.&quot;

<text>São Leopoldo () (Portuguese for &quot;Saint Leopold&quot;) is a Brazilian industrial city located in the south state of Rio Grande do Sul.

==Geography==
It occupies a total area of 103.9 km2 (around 80 km2 urban area) at &quot;circa&quot; 30 km from the State Capital, Porto Alegre. The climate is sub-tropical, with temperatures varying from -2 °C minimum at Winter to more than 40 °C maximum during summer time. Summers are fairly dry.

==History==
Established on July 25, 1824, by German immigrants, São Leopoldo is considered the cradle of German culture in Brazil, that is to say, it is the first official city designed by the national Brazilian governor to start the German plan of immigration in the country. It had, in 2006, a population of approximately 210,000.

São Leopoldo is one of the 13 cities along the Rota Romântica (&#x27;Romantic Route&#x27;), a touristic scenic route that runs from the State Capital towards the Serra Gaúcha.

==Minority language==
Riograndenser Hunsrückisch German is a regional language in South America like Pennsylvania Deitsch is in North America. They are also similar because of their origin in the Rhine region of southwest Germany. As a Brazilian variant of European Moselle Franconian, it is also spoken beyond the state of Rio Grande do Sul, where for almost two hundred years it has been historically centered and where most of its 2 to 3 millions speakers live (there are speakers in neighboring southern Brazilian states, as well as in Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay).

There are many other municipalities with this bilingual profile throughout the state and the German language is experiencing a strong revival: in 2012 the state chamber of deputies voted unanimously in favor of recognizing the Hunsrückisch Germanic dialect of Rio Grande do Sul as an official historical intangible cultural heritage to be preserved.

==Education==
The area had a German school, Instituto Preteologico. The city is the headquarters of Unisinos University.

<text>Daniel Smith (October 29, 1748June 16, 1818) was a surveyor, an American Revolutionary War patriot, and twice a United States Senator from Tennessee.

==Biography==
Smith was born October 29, 1748, in Stafford County, Virginia, the son of Henry Smith and Sarah Ann Crosby. He attended the College of William &amp; Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia. Becoming a surveyor, he moved to Augusta County, Virginia, serving as deputy surveyor of the county in 1773. He owned slaves. In Washington, Virginia on June 10 of that same year he married Sarah Michie (30 Jan 1755 - 2 Apr 1831). She was daughter of George and Elizabeth (Michie) Michie.

As a militia officer, he helped defend the Virginia frontier during Dunmore&#x27;s War and the American Revolution. He became sheriff of Augusta County in 1780 and was commissioned a colonel in the militia, taking part in the later battles of the Revolutionary War, including Guilford Courthouse and Kings Mountain. On October 5, 1781, Smith was appointed &quot;Assistant Deputy Surveyor&quot; in the Southern Department of the Continental Army under Thomas Hutchins.

At the war&#x27;s end, Smith moved to what is now Sumner County, Tennessee, to claim the land grant for his military service. As county surveyor, he surveyed what became the site of the town of Nashville, Tennessee. He was prominent in local affairs and was appointed a brigadier general in the militia. He was a member of the 1789 North Carolina convention which voted to ratify the United States Constitution. In 1790, President George Washington named him Secretary (chief deputy) of the Southwest Territory. Smith was a member of the convention that wrote the Tennessee State Constitution of 1796, which came into effect with its statehood on June 1, 1796. The first official map of Tennessee, drawn by Hugh Williamson and published by Mathew Carey in 1793, credited &quot;surveys by Gen&#x27;l D. Smith and others&quot; as sources.

Smith was later appointed as United States Senator when Andrew Jackson resigned from that position (for the first time), serving from October 6, 1798, to March 3, 1799. He was later elected to his own Senate term, serving from March 4, 1805, to March 31, 1809, when he resigned and returned to his Sumner County estate, Rock Castle in Hendersonville, pursuing his agricultural and business interests until his death there, being interred in an adjacent family plot.

Rock Castle State Historic Site is preserved today as an historical landmark and one of the early examples in Middle Tennessee of a plantation.

<doc id="1154033" wikidata="Q1272213" url="?curid=1154033" title="SilkAir Flight 185">
<text>SilkAir Flight 185 was a scheduled international passenger flight operated by a Boeing 737-300 from Soekarno–Hatta International Airport in Jakarta, Indonesia to Changi Airport in Singapore that crashed into the Musi River near Palembang, Sumatra, on 19 December 1997, killing all 97 passengers and 7 crew members on board.

The investigation into the cause of the crash was led by investigators from the National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC), who were joined by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). The NTSB, which participated in the investigation due to Boeing&#x27;s manufacture of the aircraft in the US, investigated the crash under lead investigator Greg Feith. In its final report, the NTSC found &quot;no concrete evidence&quot; to support the pilot suicide allegation, with the previously suspected Parker-Hannifin hydraulic power control unit (PCU) having already been determined by the manufacturer to be defect-free. The final statement from the NTSC was that they were unable to determine the cause of the crash and was thus inconclusive. On the other hand, in a letter sent to the NTSC, the NTSB found that the crash was most likely the result of deliberate flight-control inputs that were &quot;most likely by the captain&quot;.

Although the NTSB and PCU manufacturer Parker-Hannifin had already determined that the PCU was properly working, and thus not the cause of the crash, a private and independent investigation into the crash for a civil lawsuit tried by jury in Los Angeles County Superior Court, which was not allowed to hear or consider the NTSB&#x27;s and Parker-Hannifin&#x27;s conclusions, concluded that the crash was caused by a defective servo valve inside the PCU based on forensic findings from an electron microscope, which determined that minute defects within the PCU had caused the rudder hard-over and a subsequent uncontrollable flight and crash. The manufacturer of the aircraft&#x27;s rudder controls and the families later reached an out-of-court settlement.

== Incident ==
Carrying 97 passengers and a crew of seven, the Boeing 737 departed Jakarta&#x27;s Soekarno–Hatta International Airport&#x27;s runway 25R at 15:37 local time (08:37 UTC) for an 80-minute flight to Singapore&#x27;s Changi Airport. At the controls were Captain Tsu Way Ming (), 41, of Singapore, a former A-4 Skyhawk pilot, and First Officer Duncan Ward, 23, of New Zealand. Generally fair weather was expected for the route, except for some thunderstorms near Singkep Island, south of Singapore.

The aircraft was cleared to climb to flight level 350, about , and to head directly to Palembang. At 15:47:06, while climbing through , the crew requested clearance to proceed directly to waypoint . At 15:53, the crew reported reaching the cruise altitude of FL350 and was cleared to proceed directly to PARDI, and to report abeam Palembang. The cockpit voice recorder (CVR) ceased recording at 16:05. At 16:10, air traffic controllers informed the flight that it was abeam Palembang and instructed the aircraft to maintain FL350 and to contact Singapore Control upon reaching PARDI. First Officer Ward acknowledged this call. At 16:11, nearly 6 minutes after the CVR ceased recording, the flight data recorder (FDR) also stopped recording.

Flight 185 remained level at FL350 until it started a rapid and nearly vertical dive around 16:12. While descending through , parts of the aircraft, including a great extent of the tail section, started to separate from the aircraft&#x27;s fuselage due to high forces arising from the nearly supersonic dive. about 1 minute later, the aircraft hit the Musi River, near Palembang, Sumatra, killing all 104 people on board. The time it took the aircraft to dive from cruise altitude into the river was less than one minute. The plane was travelling faster than the speed of sound for a few seconds before impact. Parts of the wreckage were embedded into the riverbed.

The aircraft broke into pieces before impact, with the debris spread over a wide area, though most of the wreckage was concentrated in a single area at the river bottom. No complete body, body part, or limb was found, as the entire aircraft and occupants disintegrated upon impact. Only six positive identifications were later obtained from the few recovered human remains.

== Aircraft ==
The aircraft involved was a Boeing 737-36N with serial number 28556, registered as 9V-TRF, and powered by two CFM56-3B2 engines. Having completed its maiden flight on 27 January 1997, the aircraft was delivered to SilkAir on 14 February, 10 months before the crash. At the time of the accident, it was the newest aircraft in SilkAir&#x27;s fleet and had accumulated more than 2,200 flight hours in 1,300 cycles. This is the first and only fatal hull loss for SilkAir in the airline&#x27;s history.

==Passengers and crew==
SilkAir issued a press release on 19 December 1997 with a passenger count by nationality, and another the following day with crew details and a complete passenger manifest.

Among those killed in the crash was Singaporean model and author Bonny Hicks.

==Investigation and final report==

The accident was investigated by the Indonesian NTSC, which was assisted by expert groups from the US, Singapore, and Australia.

Around 73% of the wreckage (by weight) was recovered, partially reconstructed, and examined. Both of the aircraft recorders, the CVR and the FDR, were retrieved from the river and their data were extracted and analyzed.

The investigators tested 20 different simulations for various equipment-failure scenarios, and found that the only scenario that matched the actual radar trajectory of the descent and crash of the flight was a high-speed steep dive commanded by one of the pilots. Furthermore, the investigators had found the trim jackscrew for the horizontal stabilizer, which revealed that flight inputs from one of the pilots had moved the stabilizer from level flight to a full nose-down descent.

First Officer Duncan Ward was initially speculated to have deliberately crashed the aircraft, as he was the only person in the cockpit when the CVR stopped recording, but this was quickly ruled out, as Ward&#x27;s friends, family, and co-workers said that he had not displayed any signs of depression nor suicidality during his career at SilkAir, and was in a good mood on the morning of the accident flight.

At 16:05, the CVR recorded Captain Tsu stating he was leaving the cockpit to get water, followed by a series of metallic snaps (presumed to be the sounds of the captain&#x27;s seatbelt being removed and chair moving); 13.6 seconds later, the CVR stopped recording. Tests indicated that a click would be heard on the CVR recording if the CVR circuit breaker had tripped normally, but not if it had been pulled out manually. As there was no click, Captain Tsu likely pulled out the CVR circuit breaker while leaving the cockpit. At 16:11, the FDR stopped recording. The NTSC and NTSB investigators thought that if Captain Tsu was responsible for the crash, he must have made up some excuse to get the first officer to leave the flight deck before disabling the FDR (which would have immediately triggered a Master Caution on both pilots&#x27; control panels), so that his actions would not be noticed. At 16:12, as recorded by Indonesian ground radar, the aircraft entered a rapid descent, disintegrated, and crashed into the Musi River.

On 14 December 2000, after three years of investigation, the Indonesian NTSC issued its final report. The NTSC chairman Oetarjo Diran overrode the findings of his investigators—that the crash was caused deliberately by pilot input—so that the report stated that the evidence was inconclusive and that the cause of the accident could not be determined.

The American NTSB, which also participated in the investigation, concluded that the evidence was consistent with a deliberate manipulation of the flight controls, most likely by the captain.

In a letter to the NTSC dated 11 December 2000, the NTSB wrote:

Geoffrey Thomas of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; said, &quot;a secret report confirmed that the Indonesian authorities would not issue a public verdict because they feared it would make their own people too frightened to fly.&quot; Santoso Sayogo, an NTSC investigator who worked on the SilkAir 185 case, said that the Indonesian investigators submitted a report which was similar to that of the NTSB&#x27;s conclusion but were overruled by their boss.

===Potential motives===
In the aftermath of the crash, several potential motives for the captain&#x27;s alleged suicide and homicide were suggested, including recent financial losses of $1.2 million (his share-trading showed trading of more than one million shares and his securities-trading privileges had been suspended 10 days before the accident due to nonpayment), his obtaining a $600,000 life insurance policy the previous week, which was to have gone into effect on the day of the accident (though it later emerged that this was a routine policy taken out as part of a mortgage requirement), his receipt of several recent disciplinary actions on the part of the airline (including one that related to improper manipulation of the CVR circuit breaker), and the loss of four squadron mates during his military flight training, 18 years earlier on the exact date of the crash. He had also had several conflicts with Ward and other co-pilots who had questioned his command suitability. Investigations later revealed that his total assets were greater than his liabilities, although his liquid assets could not cover his immediate debts; his monthly income was less than his family&#x27;s monthly expenditure; and he had some outstanding credit card debts.

An official investigation by the Singapore Police Force into evidence of criminal offence leading to the crash found &quot;no evidence that the pilot, copilot, or any crew member had suicidal tendencies or a motive to deliberately cause the crash of [the aircraft]&quot;.

Tsu was formerly a Republic of Singapore Air Force pilot, and had over 20 years of flying experience in the older T/A-4S Skyhawks, as well as the newer T/A-4SU Super Skyhawks. His last appointment was instructor pilot of a Skyhawk squadron.

===CVR and FDR deactivation===
The CVR and FDR stopped recording minutes before the abrupt descent, but not at the same time. The CVR stopped functioning about 6 minutes before the dive as the captain was leaving the cockpit for a short break. The FDR was deactivated 5 minutes later around 1 minute before the dive. Overload and short-circuit tests show that a distinctive 400-Hz tone is recorded by the CVR when the CVR circuit breaker trips. The investigators could not find this sound on Flight 185&#x27;s CVR, which made them conclude that the CVR circuit breaker was manually pulled out. The radio continued to work after the failure of the CVR, which indicates that power failure was not the cause. Testing of the unit by the NTSC found no evidence that a malfunction or failure caused either recorder to stop recording data.

===Servo valve issue===
Starting in 1991, several accidents and incidents involving the Boeing 737 were the result of uncommanded movement of their rudders. On 3 March 1991, United Airlines Flight 585, a 737-200, crashed in Colorado Springs, Colorado, killing 25 people. On 8 September 1994, USAir Flight 427, a 737-300, crashed near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, killing 132 people. Four more incidents occurred where a 737 rudder PCU malfunction was suspected.

The &quot;Seattle Times&quot; devoted a series of 37 articles to Boeing 737 loss-of-control malfunctions. The accident occurred in the middle of a controversy over the NTSB&#x27;s role in accidents caused by the rudder control unit.

During the investigation of Flight 427, the NTSB had discovered that the PCU&#x27;s dual servo valve could jam, as well, and deflect the rudder in the opposite direction of the pilots&#x27; input, due to thermal shock, caused when cold PCUs are injected with hot hydraulic fluid. As a result of this finding, the FAA ordered the servo valves to be replaced and new training protocol for pilots to handle unexpected movement of flight controls to be developed. The FAA ordered an upgrade of all Boeing 737 rudder control systems by 12 November 2002.

==Aftermath==
===Lawsuits===
SilkAir paid USD$10,000 compensation to each victim&#x27;s family, the maximum under the Warsaw Convention. Boeing also paid an undisclosed amount of compensation. In July 2001 six families began court proceedings against SilkAir for damages, based on the allegation that the crash was caused by the pilot, after each had rejected a compensation offer of $200,000 (£143,000). In October 2001 the claims were turned down by a Singapore High Court judge who ruled that &quot;the onus of proving that flight MI185 was intentionally crashed has not been discharged.&quot;

Although the NTSB and Parker-Hannifin had already ruled out the possibility of mechanical failure as a cause to the crash of Flight 185 due to a defective PCU servo valve-unit (manufactured by Parker-Hannifin), an independent and private investigation refocused on and further examined the recovered PCU device whose malfunctioning has been pointed out in other sudden Boeing 737 crashes. The manufacturer&#x27;s records relating to this particular unit revealed that it had failed some routine tests, but they claimed to have corrected these problems. A metals expert, with the use of images from a scanning electron microscope, concluded that the servo valve had &#x27;chip-outs&#x27; and numerous burrs &quot;that could easily have interfered with the smooth operation of the valve&quot;. After this investigation was complete, in 2004, a Los Angeles Superior Court jury in the United States, which was not allowed to hear or consider the NTSB&#x27;s conclusions about the accident, found that the crash was caused by a defective servo valve in the plane&#x27;s rudder. The hydraulic PCU device manufacturer, Parker-Hannifin, was ordered to pay the three families of victims involved in that case US$43.6 million. After threatening to appeal the verdict, Parker-Hannifin later compensated all families involved (although it did not accept liability).

Parker-Hannifin spokesperson Lorrie Paul Crum stated that a federal law disallowed them from using the NTSB final report as evidence in the company&#x27;s favor during the lawsuit. The lawyer representing the plaintiffs, Walter Lack, stated that the law only disallowed using the NTSB report&#x27;s conclusion and suggestions, while statements of fact are admissible. USC §1154 (Discovery and use of cockpit and surface vehicle recordings and transcripts) states: &quot;No part of a report of the Board, related to an accident or an investigation of an accident, may be admitted into evidence or used in a civil action for damages resulting from a matter mentioned in the report.&quot;

===Memorials===
A memorial for the victims was erected at the burial site, which is located within the Botanical Gardens near Palembang. Another memorial is located at Choa Chu Kang Cemetery in Singapore.

===Dramatisation===
The Discovery Channel Canada / National Geographic TV series &quot;Mayday&quot; (also called &quot;Air Crash Investigation&quot; or &quot;Air Disasters&quot;) dramatised the accident in a 2012 episode titled &quot;Pushed to the Limit&quot; (broadcast in some countries as &quot;Pilot Under Pressure&quot;). The episode argues Captain Tsu may have taken the opportunity of leaving the cockpit for tripping the CVR circuit breaker to turn off the CVR. The episode also shows that Tsu is thought to have come up with an excuse to get Ward out of the cockpit. Having done so, he then proceeded to lock his Ward out of the flight deck before disabling the FDR; Tsu is presumed to have done this to ensure that no record would be made of what he was going to do next. The episode further states that the rudder issue had been corrected before construction started on the accident aircraft. Nevertheless, the theory of a rudder malfunction was investigated with the possibility of corrosion, or debris getting stuck in the PCU, and was disproved.

The accident was also featured in a 2006 National Geographic documentary titled &quot;SilkAir 185: Pilot Suicide?&quot;. The documentary claimed that the accident aircraft&#x27;s FDR had failed to record 60 out of the 296 parameters for periods lasting between 10 seconds and 10 minutes in the 25 hours preceding the crash.

=== In popular culture ===
Singaporean singer JJ Lin&#x27;s 2013 song &quot;Practice Love&quot; () from the album &quot;Stories Untold&quot; () is based on this incident, as a close friend of the artist, Xu Chue Fern, was killed on the flight.

<doc id="1154037" wikidata="Q3350588" url="?curid=1154037" title="Haleem">
<text>Haleem is a type of stew that is widely consumed in South Asia, the Middle East and Central Asia. Although the dish varies from region to region, it optionally includes wheat or barley, meat and lentils. It is made by slow cooking the meat in lentils and spices. It is served hot with flat breads or on its own. Popular variations of haleem include keşkek in Turkey, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and northern Iraq; harisa in the Arab world and Armenia; halim in Afghanistan, Iran, West Bengal, in Mauritius, Pakistan and Bangladesh; and khichra in India.

==Preparation==

Haleem is made of four main components:
* Grain: wheat or barley is almost always present. Pulses (such as lentil) and rice are used or not depending on the originating region of a recipe.
* Meat: usually beef or lamb and mutton; goat meat; or chicken
* Spices: containing a wide variety, including cassia and fennel, among others.
* Cooking liquid: either water, milk, or a broth.

This dish is slow-cooked for seven to eight hours and then vigorously stirred or beaten with a pestle-like stirring stick. This results in a paste-like consistency, blending the flavors of spices, meat, barley, and wheat.

In the end, the cooked haleem is garnished with fried onions, julienne-cut ginger, sliced green chillies, coriander leaves, lemon wedges, and chaat masala. However, haleem preparation varies in different regions.

==Origin==
The origin of Haleem lies in the popular Arabian dish known as Harees (also written as Jareesh). According to Shoaib Daniyal, writing in &quot;The Sunday Guardian&quot;, the first written recipe of Harees dates back to the 10th century, when Arab scribe Abu Muhammad al-Muzaffar ibn Sayyar compiled a cookbook of dishes popular with the &quot;kings and caliphs and lords and leaders&quot; of Baghdad. &quot;The version described in his Kitab Al-Tabikh (Book of Recipes), the world&#x27;s oldest surviving Arabic cookbook, is strikingly similar to the one people in the Middle East eat to this day&quot; it reported. The Harees was cooked as the Arab empire was extended to different parts of the world.

Harees was introduced in the Indian subcontinent by the Arab soldiers of the Hyderabad Nizam&#x27;s army to the city. Today, Harees is still available in the Arab quarter of Hyderabad, an area called Barkas, where the dish is called Jareesh. Later on, the people of Hyderabad modified it to suit their palate thus creating modern haleem.

==Cultural history==
Haleem is sold as a snack food in bazaars throughout the year. It is also a special dish prepared throughout the world during the Ramadan and Muharram months of the Muslim Hijri calendar, particularly among Pakistanis and Indian Muslims. Since the name of this dish is the same of one of the names of Allah, specifically &quot;Al Haleem&quot;, some South Asian Muslims have started to refer to this dish as &quot;Daleem&quot;, reasoning that it is more correct since the South Asian version of this dish contains large amounts of &quot;dal&quot;, or lentils. It is mostly still referred to as Haleem.

In India, haleem prepared in Hyderabad during the Ramadan month, is transported all over the world through a special courier service. Haleem is traditionally cooked in large, wood-fired cauldrons.
Haleem is also very popular in Bangladesh, especially during the holy month of Ramadan, when it is a staple dish. However, the Bangladeshi version of halim differs from other areas slightly as the meat and bones are stewed and kept as small pieces instead of mashing them with the lentil soup. In addition, the variety of spices used is also different. One common Bangladeshi version of Halim is called &quot;Shahi Halim&quot;; it is mostly popular in the central part of the country.

In Pakistan, Haleem is available all year round, as well as in most Pakistani restaurants around the world. Haleem is sold as a snack food and street food in Pakistani bazaars throughout the year.

It is a tradition among Persian Jews to eat haleem on Shabbat, since like other Shabbat stews such as cholent and hamin it&#x27;s a slow-cooked dish that can be prepared before the beginning of Shabbat and then cooked overnight at a low temperature.

==Hyderabadi haleem==

Haleem has become a popular dish in the cities of Hyderabad, Telangana and Aurangabad, Maharashtra (Aurangabad, the first capital of Hyderabad State) in India. Originating from an Arabic dish called Harees, Haleem was introduced to the region during the Mughal period by foreign migrants.

In 2010, Hyderabadi haleem was awarded Geographical Indication status by the Indian GI registry office. It became the first meat product of India to receive a GI certification. This means that a dish cannot be sold as Hyderabadi haleem unless it meets the necessary standards laid down for it.

==Khichra==

In the Indian subcontinent, both haleem and khichra are made with similar ingredients. In khichra, the chunks of meat remain as cubes, while in haleem the meat cubes are taken out of the pot, bones are removed, the meat is crushed and put back in the pot. It is further cooked until the meat completely blends with the lentils, wheat and barley mixture.
== Nutrition ==
A high-calorie dish, haleem provides protein from the meat and fibre and carbohydrates from the various combinations of grains and pulses.

==Serving==
Haleem can be served with chopped mint leaves, lemon juice, coriander leaves, fried onions, chopped ginger root or green chilies. In some regions of Pakistan, Haleem is eaten with Naan or with any type of bread or rice. In some parts of Uzbekistan it is served with sugar.

<doc id="1154058" wikidata="Q1064913" url="?curid=1154058" title="Ur-Nanshe">
<text>Ur-Nanshe (, ; ) also Ur-Nina, was the first king of the First Dynasty of Lagash in the Sumerian Early Dynastic Period III. He is known through inscriptions to have commissioned many building projects, including canals and temples, in the state of Lagash, and defending Lagash from its rival state Umma. He was probably not from royal lineage, being the son of Gunidu () who was recorded without an accompanying royal title. He was the father of Akurgal, who succeeded him, and grandfather of Eannatum. Eannatum expanded the kingdom of Lagash by defeating Umma as illustrated in the Stele of the Vultures and continued the building and renovation of Ur-Nanshe&#x27;s original buildings.

He ascended after Lugalshaengur (lugal-ša-engur), who was the ensi, or high priest of Lagash, and is only known from the macehead inscription of Mesilim.

==Temples==
According to the Perforated Relief of King Ur-Nanshe, temples attributed to Ur-Nanshe include Ningirsu&#x27;s temple in Girsu, Nanshe&#x27;s temple in Nina, and Apsubanda. He is known to have originally built the Ibgal of Inanna, because of Eanatum&#x27;s honorary inscriptions left after temple renovation. The Ibgal of Inanna is located in modern-day al-Hiba (ancient city of Lagash). An oval wall surrounds the main mud brick temple and it is located on the southwest edge of the city. This placement within the city is different because temples were usually centrally positioned in ancient Sumer.

==Inscriptions==

Ur-Nanshe has left behind many inscriptions and plaques that depict him, his family, and court.

===The Perforated Relief===
The Perforated Relief of King Ur-Nanshe is on display at the Louvre. The king is portrayed as a builder of temples and canals, thus a preserver of order perceived to be bestowed upon them by the gods. It is a perforated limestone slab that was probably part of a wall as a votive decoration and is inscribed in Sumerian:

The carved illustration is in two registers, top and bottom, both depicting Ur-Nanshe in different roles as king. In the top register he is dressed in a &quot;kaunakes&quot; (tufted wool skirt), carrying a basket of bricks on his head while surrounded by other Lagash elite, his wife, and seven of his sons (though it is possible female figure is instead the king&#x27;s daughter). Inscriptions on their respective garments identify each person. On the bottom register, Ur-Nanshe is at a banquet, which is to celebrate the building of the temple. He is seated on a throne wearing the same outfit as the top register surrounded by other court members. In both registers Ur-Nanshe is shown using hierarchical proportion in which he is considerably larger than everyone surrounding him.

A part of the inscriptions, in front of the seated king, reads: “Boats from the (distant) land of Dilmun carried the wood (for him)”. This is the oldest known written record of Dilmun and importation of goods into Mesopotamia.

===Door socket===

An inscribed door socket from Ur-Nanshe is also known, now in the Louvre Museum. The full inscription of the door socket has been translated as:

===The Plaque of Ur Nanshe===

The Plaque of Ur Nanshe is a limestone plaque currently located at the Louvre Museum that honors Ur Nanshe. The figures displayed are the king and his court standing rigid and wide eyed, paying homage to the god Nanshe. They are dressed in &quot;kaunakes&quot; with their hands clasped together over their chest. Hierarchical scale of the king and the use of cuneiform on the figures to identify them are employed as in the Perforated Relief.

====Additional inscriptions====

There are many other inscriptions found by or mentioning Ur-Nanshe. Some of them include a listing of rulers of Lagash and a hymn to Nanshe.

Excerpt from Ruler of Lagash:

“Ur-Nanše, the son of ..., who built the E-Sirara, her temple of happiness and Niĝin, her beloved city, acted for 1080 years. Ane-tum, the son of Ur-Nanše”

Excerpt from A Hymn to Nanshe:

“There is perfection in the presence of the lady. Lagaš thrives in abundance in the presence of Nanše. She chose the šennu in her holy heart and seated Ur-Nanše, the beloved lord of Lagaš, on the throne. She gave the lofty scepter to the shepherd.”

<text>Tannerus is a small lunar impact crater that is located in the rugged southern highlands of the Moon. It lies within a couple of crater diameters of Asclepi to the northeast, and some distance due east of Jacobi.

The rim of this crater is very close to circular, with only a slight inward bulge along the north edge where it is joined to Tannerus P. The edge is sharp and well-defined, although there are tiny impacts along the rim in the west and south. The crater floor is level and free of markings or features of note.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Tannerus.

<text>Watt is a lunar impact crater that is located in the southeastern part of the Moon. It was named after Scottish inventor James Watt. The northwestern third of the crater rim has been completely overlain by the same-sized Steinheil, leaving much of the interior floor covered with the outer of ejecta from the latter formation. The remainder of the rim of Watt is somewhat jagged in appearance, with an inward bulge along the southeast rim and a pair of small outward projections to the northeast. The rim is otherwise relatively sharply defined, with only a minor amount of wear.

Nearby craters of note include Biela to the south-southeast, Rosenberger to the southwest, and the walled plain Janssen to the northwest past Steinheil.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Watt.

<doc id="1154122" wikidata="Q171683" url="?curid=1154122" title="Jean-Pierre Jarier">
<text>Jean-Pierre Jacques Jarier (born 10 July 1946) is a French former Grand Prix racing driver. He drove for Formula One teams including Shadow, Team Lotus, Ligier, Osella and Tyrrell Racing. His best finish was third (three times) and he also took three pole positions.

==Early career==
Jarier was born at Charenton-le-Pont, near Paris. After competing in Formula France, he moved up to French Formula Three, finishing 3rd overall in 1970, before moving on to the Shell Arnold European Formula Two team in 1971. He peaked with two 3rd places, and also made his Grand Prix debut at Monza when the team rented a March Engineering 701. However, the team dropped him midway through 1972 for financial reasons. For 1973 he signed to the March Engineering Formula Two team, and was also given a Formula One seat by the outfit. Formula One was difficult in the uncompetitive 721G, but Jarier stormed to the Formula Two title with eight wins.

==Formula One==
After his good form in the 1973 F2 European series, Jarier nearly signed for Ferrari, but their established driver Clay Regazzoni insisted on having the young Austrian Niki Lauda as his teammate. In 1974 Jarier drove a full season of Formula One, signing with the Shadow Racing Cars team. He became team leader following the death of Peter Revson, and finished 3rd at the Monaco Grand Prix on his way to 14th overall. As a sports car driver. Jarier led Matra&#x27;s successful defense of its world sports car title, and proved himself the fastest driver of all on the classic road circuits, being faster than Ickx at Nürburgring and the old Spa road circuit and winning three other rounds on GP circuits at Brands Hatch, Watkins Glen and Paul Ricard.

1975 began Jarier putting his Shadow DN5 on pole position for the Argentine Grand Prix, only for a component to break in the warm-up, preventing Jarier from taking the start. He repeated the feat at the Brazilian Grand Prix, and then dominated the race until a fuel metering unit failed, ending his race. Bad luck and poor reliability would curse his season, though the Shadow team fell from the pace as well. His only points-scoring finish was for 4th place in the shortened Spanish Grand Prix.

Jarier spent 1976 with Shadow Racing Cars, qualifying 3rd in an updated version of the previous year&#x27;s car, the DN5B and setting fastest lap at the opening Brazilian Grand Prix, before spinning off and crashing on James Hunt&#x27;s oil whilst running second a few seconds behind Niki Lauda in a Ferrari. Subsequently, the car became uncompetitive, and Jarier failed to score any points.

After this, his career slowed. He switched to the ATS team in 1977, driving a Penske. He scored a point in his first race for the team, and then had one-off drives for Shadow and Équipe Ligier when the German team elected to miss the final races of the year. He also dabbled in sports cars, winning two races in an Alfa Romeo T33 with Arturo Merzario, and coming second at the Le Mans 24 Hours with Vern Schuppan in a Mirage.

His second year at ATS in the in-house HS1, was less successful, and he was fired after an argument with team principal Günter Schmid after failing to qualify the car for the Monaco Grand Prix. He was briefly re-hired for the German Grand Prix, only to miss the grid again, and again argued with Schmid, leaving once more. However, at the end of the year he was signed by Team Lotus to take the seat left by Ronnie Peterson&#x27;s death. He set fastest lap at the United States Grand Prix East at Watkins Glen, running 3rd before he ran out of fuel, and then took pole and dominated at the Canadian Grand Prix at Montreal before an oil leak ended his race.

These showings saw him signed by Tyrrell Racing. He was a regular points-scorer over two seasons with the team, with his best results being two 3rd places, achieved at the 1979 South African Grand Prix and the 1979 British Grand Prix.

He began 1981 with a temporary assignment for Ligier, standing in while Jean-Pierre Jabouille returned to fitness, for two races at Long Beach and Rio de Janeiro. He then drove with Osella beginning midway through the season.

1982 saw a full season with Osella, with Jarier securing the team&#x27;s best-ever finish with 4th at the San Marino Grand Prix (which was boycotted by the majority of British teams). While the rest of the year would be difficult, Jarier was instrumental in keeping the team&#x27;s morale up following the death of Riccardo Paletti at the Canadian Grand Prix.

The following year saw a full season with Equipe Ligier, but after a good run at Long Beach ended with a collision with Keke Rosberg, he finished the season without points, and spent most of the season making other drivers angry because of his blocking tactics as a back marker. One example of this was the Austrian Grand Prix that year. On lap 22, Ferrari driver Patrick Tambay, who had led the race from the start, was held up by Jarier for two corners (the Glatsch-kurve and the Bosch-kurve). As he was being held up, Tambay&#x27;s team-mate René Arnoux was able to pass Tambay on the approach to the Texaco-Schikane by boxing Tambay in behind Jarier. This also allowed Brabham driver Nelson Piquet to come from 3rd to 2nd by nipping past Tambay into the second of the two left-handers, which dropped Tambay to 3rd and denied him the lead he had been preparing to re-take from Arnoux. A furious Tambay waved his fist at Jarier when he finally did pass him.

==Later life==
Following this, Jarier retired from motorsport, but was tempted back to drive in the Porsche Supercup in 1994. This led to several sports car drives, winning the 1998 and 1999 French GT Championships. Jarier contributed major stunt work to the film &quot;Ronin&quot;, directed by John Frankenheimer, who also directed the 1966 &quot;Grand Prix&quot;.

<doc id="1154175" wikidata="Q5287182" url="?curid=1154175" title="Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Labourers' Union">
<text>The Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Labourers Union (DWRGLU), often known as the Dockers&#x27; Union, was a British trade union representing dock workers in the United Kingdom, founded in 1887 and merged into the Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union in 1922.

==History==
The union was founded in 1887 as the Tea Operatives and General Labourers&#x27; Association, to organise opposition to a cut in wages for workers involved in unloading and processing tea at the East and West India Dock Company&#x27;s Cutler Street warehouse. From the start, it included other supportive workers, with secretary Ben Tillett working at nearby Monument Quay Warehouse. Considered part of the New Unionism movement, it grew rapidly, with 2,300 members by the end of 1888.

The union was central to the London dock strike of 1889, many of the participants in the strike joining the union immediately after the strike. By the end of the year, it had 30,932 members, and had been renamed as the &quot;Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Labourers&#x27; Union&quot;, reflecting the broader base of its membership. However, most dock labourers working in the docks on the south bank of the River Thames instead joined a new rival, the South Side Labour Protection League, in protest at the degree of centralisation in the Dockers&#x27; Union, and its refusal to allow branch meetings to take place in pubs.

The Dockers&#x27; Union rapidly became the principal union for dockworkers in London, Bristol, Cardiff, and other ports in the south and south-west. In South Wales it attracted a large following amongst metal-workers. The union was renamed the Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Workers&#x27; Union of Great Britain and Ireland in 1899. By this time, it had lost most of its members in London, but continued to grow as more workers joined elsewhere in the country.

The union was a constituent of the National Transport Workers&#x27; Federation and was keen to amalgamate with other similar unions. Ernest Bevin became a prominent official in the union from 1910, and he initiated the merger process which formed the Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union in 1922.

The union published the &quot;Dockers&#x27; Record&quot; as a monthly report of its activities.

==Election results==
The union sponsored Labour Party candidates in two general elections, some of whom won election:

<doc id="1154184" wikidata="Q175446" url="?curid=1154184" title="Huffyuv">
<text>Huffyuv (or HuffYUV) is a lossless video codec created by Ben Rudiak-Gould which is meant to replace uncompressed YCbCr as a video capture format. The codec can also compress in the RGB color space.

&quot;Lossless&quot; means that the output from the decompressor is bit-for-bit identical with the original input to the compressor. Lossless only occurs when the compression color space matches the input and output color space. When the color spaces do not match, a low loss compression is performed.

Huffyuv&#x27;s algorithm is similar to that of lossless JPEG, in that it predicts each sample and then Huffman-encodes the error. The predictor is intraframe-only.

== Implementations ==

The original implementation was written for Windows by Ben Rudiak-Gould and published under the terms of the GPL. The Huffyuv 1.1 was released in 2000. The implementation is considered very fast, giving a compression throughput of up to 38 megabytes per second on a 416 MHz Celeron. The official Huffyuv has not had a new release since 2002.

Huffyuv 2.1.1 with CCESP patch 0.2.5 was released to address problems particularly for compatibility with Cinema Craft Encoder.

Huffyuv 2.2 is available on some alternative sites, but is reported to have problems on some computer systems.

Huffyuv MT is a multi-threaded version that uses a different FourCC.

There is a currently developed fork of the code named Lagarith which offers better compression at the cost of greatly reduced speed on uniprocessor systems.

The FFmpeg project also contains an implementation of HuffYUV which allows HuffYUV files to be created &amp; played on Linux and Mac OS X. Additionally, this means that many of the applications which use FFmpeg as a base can also play/create HuffYUV files, including VLC media player, MPlayer and ffdshow. FFmpeg also has its own FFmpeg-specific (incompatible with the original) version of HuffYUV which supports a wider variety of colorspaces, including chroma-quartered and high bit depth color spaces up to 48bpp.

<text>Jenkin Whiteside (1772September 25, 1822) was an attorney who served as a United States Senator from Tennessee.

==Biography==
Jenkin Whiteside was born in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. His father, Thomas Whiteside (1742–1823), was born in County Tyrone in Ulster and settled in the Province of Pennsylvania. Jenkin Whiteside studied the law in Pennsylvania and was admitted to the bar there. Moving to Knoxville, Tennessee, he commenced practice there, and in 1801 and 1802 served as a Knoxville commissioner.

In 1809, he was elected by the Tennessee General Assembly to replace Daniel Smith, who had resigned from the United States Senate, serving until his own resignation on October 8, 1811, when he resumed the practice of law.

He was succeeded as senator by George W. Campbell.

==Death==
He died in Nashville in 1821 and was buried in Columbia, Tennessee.

<doc id="1154206" wikidata="Q284890" url="?curid=1154206" title="Ffdshow">
<text>ffdshow is an open-source unmaintained codec library that is mainly used for decoding of video in the MPEG-4 ASP (e.g. encoded with DivX or Xvid) and H.264/MPEG-4 AVC video formats, but it supports numerous other video and audio formats as well. It is free software released under GNU General Public License 2.0, runs on Windows, and is implemented as a Video for Windows (VFW) codec and a DirectShow filter.

==Installation and configuration==
ffdshow does not include a media player or container parsers. Instead, after installation of ffdshow, compatible DirectShow or VFW media players such as Media Player Classic, Winamp, and Windows Media Player will use the ffdshow decoder automatically, thus avoiding the need to install separate codecs for the various formats supported by ffdshow. The user configures ffdshow&#x27;s audio and video settings by launching the ffdshow video decoder configuration program independently of any media player.

For playing transport stream files such as AVC(H.264) an additional mediasplitter should also be installed. There are several free mediasplitters available such as the LAV Filters.

==Format and filter support==
ffdshow can be configured to display subtitles, to enable or disable various built-in codecs, to grab screenshots, to enable keyboard control, and to enhance movies with increased resolution, sharpness, and many other post-processing video filters. It has the ability to manipulate audio with effects like an equalizer, a Dolby decoder, reverb, Winamp DSP plugins, and more. Some of the postprocessing is borrowed from the MPlayer project and AviSynth filters.

ffdshow uses the libavcodec library and several other free, open source software packages to decode video in most common formats, such as:

*MPEG-4 Part 2 (including video encoded with Xvid, 3ivx, and all versions of DivX).
*Flash Video, H.263 and VP6 (used by sites such as YouTube).
*H.264/AVC, Theora, WMV as well as numerous others.

ffdshow also decodes audio, such as:

*MP3,
*AAC,
*Dolby AC3,
*WMA
*FLAC, and
*Vorbis formats, among others.

The post-processing video filters of ffdshow can be used in video editors such as VirtualDub or AviSynth, by configuring the VFW settings. In these editors, ffdshow can also be used to encode MPEG-4 video compatible with Xvid, DivX, or x264 codecs, as well as lossless video and a few other formats supported by libavcodec.

==History==
The first versions of ffdshow were published in May 2002, as an alternative to the DivX ;-) 3.11 and DivX 5.02 (which came bundled with Gator) decoders of the time, and as a way to combine the speed and quality of MPlayer with popular Windows video players. It continues to support more formats, new and old, as FFmpeg developers add support for them.

The main developer was Milan Cutka. When he stopped updating the project in 2006, new maintainers opened the ffdshow tryouts as a fork, where bug-fixes, stability fixes, new features, and codec updates continued. Development of ffdshow tryouts was discontinued in 2012 with users recommended to use LAV Filters instead.

<doc id="1154260" wikidata="Q674528" url="?curid=1154260" title="UA1 experiment">
<text>The UA1 experiment (an abbreviation of Underground Area 1) was a high-energy physics experiment that ran at CERN&#x27;s Proton-Antiproton Collider (SpS), a modification of the one-beam Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS). The data was recorded between 1981 and 1990. The joint discovery of the W and Z bosons by this experiment and the UA2 experiment in 1983 led to the Nobel Prize for physics being awarded to Carlo Rubbia and Simon van der Meer in 1984. Peter Kalmus and John Dowell, from the UK groups working on the project, were jointly awarded the 1988 Rutherford Medal and Prize from the Institute of Physics for their outstanding roles in the discovery of the W and Z particles.

It was named as the first experiment in a CERN &quot;Underground Area&quot; (UA), i.e. located underground, outside of the two main CERN sites, at an interaction point on the SPS accelerator, which had been modified to operate as a collider.
The UA1 central detector was crucial to understanding the complex topology of proton-antiproton collisions. It played a most important role in identifying a handful of W and Z particles among billions of collisions.
After the discovery of the W and Z boson, the UA1 collaboration went on to search for the top quark. Physicists had anticipated its existence since 1977, when its partner — the bottom quark — was discovered. It was felt that the discovery of the top quark was imminent. In June 1984, Carlo Rubbia at the UA1 experiment expressed to the &quot;New York Times&quot; that evidence of the top quark &quot;looks really good&quot;. Over the next months it became clear that UA1 had overlooked a significant source of background. The top quark was ultimately discovered in 1994–1995 by physicists at Fermilab with a mass near 175 GeV.

The UA1 was a huge and complex detector for its day. It was designed as a general-purpose detector.
The detector was a 6-chamber cylindrical assembly 5.8 m long and 2.3 m in diameter, the largest imaging drift chamber of its day. It recorded the tracks of charged particles curving in a 0.7 Tesla magnetic field, measuring their momentum, the sign of their electric charge and their rate of energy loss (dE/dx). Atoms in the argon-ethane gas mixture filling the chambers were ionised by the passage of charged particles. The electrons which were released drifted along an electric field shaped by field wires and were collected on sense wires. The geometrical arrangement of the 17000 field wires and 6125 sense wires allowed a spectacular 3-D interactive display of reconstructed physics events to be produced.

The UA1 detector was conceived and designed in 1978/9, with the proposal submitted in mid-1978.

Since the end of running, the magnet used in the UA1 experiment has been used for other high energy physics experiments, notably the NOMAD and T2K neutrino experiments.

<text>Logtun Church () is a historic, medieval parish church of the Church of Norway in Frosta Municipality in Trøndelag county, Norway. It is located in the village of Logtun. It is one of the churches for the Frosta parish which is part of the Stiklestad prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Nidaros. It is a museum and historic cultural site that was gifted from the parish to the Society for the Preservation of Ancient Norwegian Monuments. The stone church was built in a long church style during the late 12th century by an unknown architect. The church was the main church for the parish of Frosta until the new Frosta Church was built nearby in 1866. After that, the church was not regularly used. During the 1950s, the church was restored and it is now used infrequently as a wedding venue and it holds some summer worship services.

==History==
Logtun is located on the Frosta peninsula close to Tinghaugen, the site of the early Norwegian Frostating court. There was already a church at Logtun at the time of Archbishop Eystein Erlendsson (from 1157 to 1180), but no sources indicate when this particular church was built. It was likely built around the years 1150-1160. The church was constructed with double walls of stone and brick and with lime and sand.

Around the year 1500, the church was completely rebuilt. In 1640, the church underwent extensive interior repair. The church has a special altarpiece that was carved in 1652 and painted in 1655. Johan Bildthugger performed the carpentry and wood carving and Johan Hansen Kontrafeier the painting. The church has had several additions: sacristy, veranda tower, and porches. All these were of wood and were probably built after the Reformation in 1537.

In 1814, this church served as an election church (). Together with more than 300 other parish churches across Norway, it was a polling station for elections to the 1814 Norwegian Constituent Assembly which wrote the Constitution of Norway. This was Norway&#x27;s first national elections. Each church parish was a constituency that elected people called &quot;electors&quot; who later met together in each county to elect the representatives for the assembly that was to meet at Eidsvoll Manor later that year.

In 1857, Frosta Municipality bought the church and at that time it was determined that the church was too small for the parish, so a new church would be built. The nearby Frosta Church was built in 1866 to replace it as the main church for the area. The new church was built near the site of another medieval church that once stood in Frosta. The old church on Logtun was partially demolished two years later with the stone walls remaining, but the timbers for the roof were auctioned off. The church was given to the Society for the Preservation of Ancient Norwegian Monuments in 1903 and began a nearly fifty-year long restoration project. Extensive restoration work on the stone walls took place from 1903-1904. It wasn&#x27;t until 1932 that the church roof was rebuilt. The interior of the church was restored from 1935-1950. In 1950, an Olsok service was the first time the newly restored church was used. The church is a museum, but it is still used for baptisms, wedding ceremonies, some religious services, and concerts.

<text>United Kingdom trade mark law provides protection for the use of trade marks in the UK. A trade mark is a way for one party to distinguish themselves from another. In the business world, a trade mark provides a product or organisation with an identity which cannot be imitated by its competitors.

A trade mark can be a name, word, phrase, logo, symbol, design, image, sound, shape, signature or any combination of these elements. In UK law, as in most common law countries other than the United States and Canada, the term is written as &quot;trade mark&quot; (as in the Trade Marks Act 1994), not &quot;trademark&quot;.

== Conferred rights ==
The owners of a trade mark can legally defend their mark against infringements. To do so, the trade mark must either be registered, or have been used for a period of time so that it has acquired local distinctiveness (Prior Rights).

The extent to which a trade mark is defendable depends upon the similarity of the trade marks involved, the similarity of the products or services involved and whether the trademark has acquired distinctiveness.

A registered trade mark is relatively simple to defend in a court of law. An unregistered trade mark relies on the law of passing off (where one party&#x27;s goods or services are presented in a way that causes confusion between them and the goods or services of another party).

Rights have also been recently extended with regard to well-known trade marks.

The Trade Marks Act 1994 states that &quot;a person infringes a registered trade mark if he uses in the course of trade a sign which is identical with the trade mark in relation to goods or services which are identical with those for which it is registered&quot;. A person may also infringe a registered trade mark where the sign is similar and the goods or services are similar to those for which the mark is registered and there is a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public as a result.

A person also infringes a registered trade mark if he uses in the course of trade a sign which is identical with or similar to the mark, if the trade mark has a reputation in the UK, and its use without due cause takes unfair advantage of, or is detrimental to, the mark&#x27;s distinctive character or reputation.

== Registering trade marks ==
The registration of trade marks in the UK is achieved through the UK Intellectual Property Office (UKIPO). If registration is accepted by the UKIPO, a number of exclusive rights are bestowed upon the trade mark owner. These rights allow the owner to prevent unauthorised use of the mark on products that are identical or similar to the registered mark.

When a trade mark application is made to the UKIPO, it examines the application to decide whether the trade mark that is being applied for is distinctive enough to be a trade mark. Registration usually takes about three and a half to four months. However, this time span can be greatly increased if any objections are raised to the mark&#x27;s registration by owners of similar registered trade marks or by the UKIPO themselves. Once a trademark is registered, it is kept on the register for ten years, after which it needs to be renewed to preserve the owner&#x27;s rights over it. It can also be allowed to lapse.

Trade marks are registered in one or more of 45 classes. There are 34 classes of goods and 11 for services. These classes group products that are deemed to be similar in function, and are identified by their number. For example, the registration of a trade mark for a range of gymnastic and sporting articles is classified by the trademark registry in &quot;class 28&quot;.

== Registrability of a trade mark ==
Some of the main objections that the UKIPO will make when trademarks are submitted for registration are usually related to the &quot;distinctiveness&quot; of the mark. An inherently distinctive mark is the easiest to register, as it has no prior meaning. These marks are not to be found in dictionaries. A good example of such a distinctive trademark is iPod.

Words that appear in the dictionary can still be registered. These arbitrary trademarks are meaningless in the context of their use. For example, &quot;Apple Computer&quot;, or &quot;Apple Corps&quot;.

Suggestive trade marks do not describe a characteristic of the product, but with some imagination, are identifiable with their connected product. For example, &quot;ColdSeal Windows&quot;.

Descriptive trade marks use words that appear in the dictionary that describe the product to which they relate. They are usually difficult to register, and the registrar needs to prove that the mark has become distinctive through its long term use. Descriptive marks can be made distinctive by the addition of other elements to the name or logo.

== Acquired distinctiveness ==

A descriptive trade mark can only be registered if it has &quot;acquired distinctiveness&quot;. This is achievable through its use, although proving that &quot;acquired distinctiveness&quot; has been achieved usually relies on sales figures and advertising budgets.

== Registration exclusions ==
Most countries exclude certain terms and symbols from being registrable. These include emblems, flags, royal insignia, and the rings of the Olympic Games. In addition, marks that are deceptive as to the country of the product&#x27;s origin and marks that are obscene are unregistrable.

== Historical legislation==

The Merchandise Marks Act 1862 (25 &amp; 26 Vict. c. 88) made it a criminal offence to imitate another&#x27;s trade mark &quot;with intent to defraud or to enable another to defraud&quot;.

The Trade Marks Registration Act 1875 (38 &amp; 39 Vict. c. 91) was passed which allowed formal registration of trade marks at the UK Patent Office for the first time. Registration was considered to comprise prima facie evidence of ownership of a trade mark and registration of marks began on 1 January 1876. The first trade mark to be so registered was the red triangle of the Bass Brewery. The 1875 Act defined a registrable trade mark as &quot;a device, or mark, or name of an individual or firm printed in some particular and distinctive manner; or a written signature or copy of a written signature of an individual or firm; or a distinctive label or ticket&quot;. However, any word or name that was in use as a trade mark before the passing of the Act (in August 1875) was entitled to registration, whether or not the mark fulfilled these criteria.


The Patents, Designs, and Trade Marks Act 1883 (46 &amp; 47 Vict. c. 57) substantially revised trade mark law, reducing the cost of application, and included the facility to register &quot;fancy words not in common use&quot; and &quot;brands&quot; as new marks for the first time. Further major trademark acts were passed; the Patents, Designs, and Trade Marks (Amendment) Act 1885 and the Trade Marks Act 1905 (which both further refined definitions of a trade mark), the Trade Marks Act 1914, the Trade Marks Act 1919 (which separated the trade mark register into Parts A and B, each of which had different registration criteria), the Trade Marks (Amendment) Act 1937 and the Trade Marks Act 1938, which remained in force until it was superseded by the Trade Marks Act 1994.

== Recent legislation ==
The current UK Trade Mark legislation is the Trade Marks Act 1994, which implements the European Trade Marks Directive into national law.

The UK Intellectual Property Office radically altered the way UK national trade mark applications were examined in October 2007. Previously, UK national trade mark applications underwent a full examination both on absolute (distinctiveness) and relative (prior rights) grounds. In October 2007, the search which formed a part of the examination of applications on prior rights grounds became an advisory search in a similar fashion to the Community Trade Mark system, bringing into force Section 8 of the Trade Marks Act 1994. No longer will the UKIPO unilaterally be able to prevent the grant of a UK national trade mark application on the basis of an earlier pending application or prior registration for a conflicting mark. Instead, it will be up to the proprietor of that right to oppose the application when it advertised for opposition purposes, although the UKIPO will still advise owners of conflicting application where citations including their marks have been sent to the applicant to assist them in making an opposition.

A fast-track application process has also been available to applicants since 7 April 2008.

Aspects of UK common law also relate to trade marks, most notably the common law tort of passing off.

<text>InvisiClues were hint booklets sold by Infocom to help players solve puzzles in their interactive fiction computer games.

Before Infocom&#x27;s games exploded in popularity, players could request hints by mail and receive a type-written sheet in response. When the number of requests proved unmanageable, the Zork Users Group began a pay-per-hint telephone system. The invention of InvisiClues replaced this system and was revolutionary: a player could often buy a hint book at the same time and at the same location as the game itself.

Questions relating to the game were printed in the book, for example, the InvisiClues for &quot;Zork I&quot; contained the question &quot;How can I kill the songbird?&quot; A series of &quot;empty&quot; boxes located below or following the text contained the answers, printed in invisible ink. The contents of each box could be revealed by using a highlighter-like marker that came with the book. Over time, the ink degraded and the text reverted to invisibility.

To discourage players from accidentally learning what awaited by reading all the questions, each booklet contained a number of plausible-sounding &quot;fake&quot; questions. Revealing these answers usually resulted in a mild scolding. Several &quot;non-puzzles&quot; also had questions, such as the songbird example used above. The answer to these was usually a tersely-worded statement saying &quot;You can&#x27;t do that&quot;, often followed by one or more items reading &quot;This space intentionally left blank&quot; or, on occasion, showed false clues such as &quot;How Do I get off the roof of the House?&quot; the clue being &quot;How did you get up there?&quot;. Even the answers to real questions began with vague hints, so a player could choose to stop short of getting explicit solutions to the puzzles.

The InvisiClues books were very popular. By late 1984 Infocom had sold more than 500,000 copies at $9.95 each for its games, including about 200,000 for the &quot;Zork I&quot; book. Richard E. Snyder of Simon &amp; Schuster amazed InvisiClues author Mike Dornbrook by stating that such volumes made him &quot;one of the bestselling authors on the planet ... In terms of dollars you&#x27;re at Stephen King level!&quot;

For a short time, &quot;The Status Line&quot;, the Infocom Game newsletter, included &quot;Visiclues&quot;. These were just select InvisiClues questions from a couple of newer games, with answers written in a simple cryptogram.

InvisiClues books were almost always packaged with the navigation map for the same given game.
Though InvisiClues, like the games themselves, are no longer available, a few Internet sites have recreated the booklets. Typically, either all the answers are printed normally on the site or the user must &quot;highlight&quot; a section by clicking and dragging the mouse to reveal the hints.

The InvisiClues were included in a hint booklet packaged with &quot;The Lost Treasures of Infocom&quot;. However, the InvisiClues packaged with the &quot;Treasures&quot; were not produced to Infocom&#x27;s high standards:
* The clues were not written in invisible ink, which made it easy to accidentally get answers to puzzles.
* Some of the hints were missing
* There were many errors, such as misspellings, mis-capitalizations, formatting issues, and punctuation errors.

The clues were not included with &quot;The Lost Treasures of Infocom II&quot;. However, there was a pay-per-minute card included. In the Solid Gold line, typing &quot;HINT&quot; twice would allow you to access Invisiclues from in-game.

<doc id="1154340" wikidata="Q1419029" url="?curid=1154340" title="Nuno da Cunha">
<text>Nuno da Cunha (c. 1487 – 5 March 1539) was a Portuguese admiral who was governor of Portuguese possessions in India from 1529 to 1538. He was the governor of Portuguese Asia that ruled for more time in the sixteenth century in a total of nine years. He was the son of Antónia Pais and Tristão da Cunha, the famous Portuguese navigator, admiral and ambassador to Pope Leo X. Nuno da Cunha proved his mettle in battles at Oja and Brava, and at the capture of Panane, under the viceroy Francisco de Almeida. Named by João III ninth governor of Portuguese possessions in India, he served from April 1529 to 1538. He was named to end the government of governor Lopo Vaz de Sampaio (1526–1529) and brought orders, by King John III of Portugal, to send Sampaio in chains for Portugal. This delicate mission by the King was justified by their close connection ever since the king was still a prince.

On his passage to Goa, he subdued the pirates at Mombasa who had been harassing the coast of Portuguese Mozambique. Mozambique had been brought within the Portuguese trading orbit and provided watering stations essential to Portugal&#x27;s lifeline to the west coast of India. Nuno&#x27;s brothers Pero Vaz da Cunha and Simão da Cunha were expected to serve under him as second and third in command, a form of nepotism that was expected in the Portuguese &quot;Estado da Índia.&quot; However, they died on the voyage, and Nuno was forced to rely upon local networks of clientage in Goa during his long rule.

In 1529, Nuno sent an expedition that sacked and burned the city of Damão on the Arabian Sea at the mouth of the Damão River, about 100 miles north of Mumbai in the Muslim state of Gujarat. Forces under his control captured Baxay (now Vasai, often mistaken for Basra in Iraq) from the Muslim ruler of Gujarat, Bahadur Shah, on 20 January 1533. The next year, renamed Bassein, the city became the capital of the Portuguese province of the North, and the great citadel of black basalt, still standing, was begun. (It was completed in 1548.)

Forced to return to Portugal as a result of court intrigues, he was shipwrecked at the Cape of Good Hope and drowned. His first marriage was to Maria da Cunha, and his second marriage was to Isabel da Silveira. The main source for Nuno da Cunha&#x27;s career is the Portuguese historian João de Barros (1496–1570), famous for his history of the Portuguese in their overseas territories. The work, is full of lively detail, with incidents described like the king of Viantana&#x27;s killing of the Portuguese ambassadors to Malacca with boiling water and their bodies thrown to dogs.

<text>Saint Wolbodo (c. 950 – 20 April 1021) was the bishop of Liège from 1018 to 1021.

St. Wolbodo&#x27;s day is celebrated on 21 April.

==Life==
Wolbodo probably descended from a Flemish noble family related to that of the Counts of Flanders. After being educated at the cathedral school in Utrecht, he became a canon of Utrecht Cathedral, and in 1012 scholaster there. He later became provost of the cathedral chapter.

He was appointed to the see of Liège after the death of Baldrick II (29 July 1018), and negotiated the release of Godfrey II, Duke of Lower Lorraine, who had been captured by Dirk III, Count of Holland, at the Battle of Vlaardingen. In November 1018 he was consecrated bishop in Liège by Heribert of Cologne, assisted by Gerard of Cambrai, in the presence of Emperor Henry II.

He named Olbert of Gambloux as head of the Abbey of St James in Liège, and in 1020 deposed Ingobrand as abbot of Lobbes Abbey, replacing him with Richard of Saint-Vanne. In 1020 he also installed Poppo, prior of the Abbey of Saint-Vaast in Cambrai, as abbot of Stavelot Abbey.

He bequeathed his moveables, 300 marks of silver and his lands in Flanders to the Abbey of St Laurence, Liège, and was buried in the abbey&#x27;s crypt. In 1656 his tomb was opened and his remains reburied.

==Veneration==
After his death Wolbodo was honoured as a saint. He is a patron saint of students. In Delft the student society Menschen Vereeniging Wolbodo is named after him.

<text>Shashamane (, ) is a city in southern Ethiopia. Located in the Oromia Region with a 2007 Census population of 100,454, but with an estimated 208,368 inhabitants in mid 2022; the town is known for its Rastafarian community. A couple of years ago, the current town administration made a determined move to speed up the development of the town and answer the questions of the residents and is one of the fast urbanizing urban centers in Oromia Regional State and has seventeen (17) sub-cities. Namely Abosto, Alelu, Arada, Awasho, Dida boqe, Bulchana, Burqa Gudina, Kuyera, Awasho Dhenqu, Aleche Harebate, Edola burqa, Alelu Ilu, Bute filicha, Kerara filicha, Ilala Qorke, Meja Dema, and Bulchana Deneba. The resort of Wondo Genet lies near Shashamane, as does the Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary.

==History==

Following the end of the Italian invasion in 1941 and Emperor Haile Selassie&#x27;s return to the throne, he made plans to grant 500 acres of fertile land to black refugees in 1948 in response to racism in the United States.

Haile Selassie formed the first Ethiopian World Federation (EWF) in Harlem, New York and prepared a series of events to bond with African Americans for the Ethiopian culture before announcing The Land Grants. While one of the female members of the EWF was visiting Jamaica she leaked the information about the Land Grant with the people of Jamaica. The Land Grants were specifically intended for African Americans in return for intervening in favor of the royal family during the second world war. Once information about the possibility of immigration to Ethiopia spread many made plans to immigrate, divisions of the EWF began appearing internationally to take advantage of the Land Grants Haile Selassie left for African Americans. The official letter confirming the &quot;Land Grant&quot; of 1948 was submitted to the members and executives of the Ethiopian World Federation in New York City in 1955.

The first West Indian family and Federation members were James Piper and his wife Helen who arrived that same year as the first Land Grant administrators, returning to make a permanent settlement in 1955 on behalf of the federation. Haile Selassie visited Jamaica one time in an effort to get the natives to focus on uplifting their communities before visiting Ethiopia. By the time he left, the entire community was certain that Haile Selassie was the second coming of Jesus. He encouraged them to take care of the land that they had already been given in their own country. Haile Selassie left specific instructions with the U.S. and Africa pertaining to the Land Grant. African Americans were fed-up, after having fought in two world wars and were still denied land and civil rights in America. They had a very hard time trying to stabilize their families, their citizenship, their equal rights all while figuring out their nationality while America was repairing itself for desegregation. They were promised that the land would be there when they were tired of fighting for civil rights and equality in the United States. Meanwhile, the Rastafarian community in Jamaica was growing and many were planning immigration.

The first Rastafarian that settled in Ethiopia, Gladstone Robinson, was also an official delegate of a division of the EWF that went to Shashamane on behalf of the organization in June 1964, followed by Papa Noel Dyer, who hitchhiked from England to Ethiopia, eventually arriving in September 1965. Mr. Robinson would later be appointed as the Land Grant administrator by a Division of The Federation executive council in 1967 thus replacing Mr. Piper and his wife in Ethiopia.

It was within a couple of years that Rastafari immigration began, with the population swelling past 2,000 at one point. It was reported in 2004 that their numbers had dwindled from more than 2,000 to fewer than 300 according to a recent CNN interview with Robinson and other Rastafari settlers.

Jamaican settlers petitioned Emperor Haile Selassie for Ethiopian citizenship and other benefits several times. Once the Jamaican settlers began having children and inviting more people to the African Americans&#x27; soil, they began asking for more. They eventually grew suspicious of the belief that Haile Selassie was the second coming of Jesus. A few weeks later, the &quot;Jamaican Daily Gleaner&quot; reported that EWF members in Jamaica left for Ethiopia on 5 September to develop the settlement with no money or support from their original country.

After leaders of both Jamaican political parties, Hugh Shearer and Michael Manley, each paid visits to the community in September 1969, Haile Selassie himself again visited and, according to EWF number 37 leader Mortimer Planno, cautioned them against bringing Jamaican politics to Ethiopia. The following year, the Imperial Court ordered ten hectares apiece to be parceled out to twelve &quot;pioneer&quot; Rastafari settlers, as reported in &quot;The Gleaner&quot; on 5 September 1970.

According to the EWF, Haile Selassie again paid a visit on 1 October 1970, asking to speak to the then land grant administrator, James Piper, who was not a Rastafari. Piper declined to appear, claiming it was his Sabbath. This resulted in a change in administration at the settlement. It is reported that due to this and other incidents, Robinson replaced the Pipers as administrators the land prior to the Derg revolution.

Because of the &quot;anti-organization&quot; sentiments of many Rastas of that day, the federation&#x27;s official authority was compromised. Many created other organizations, entities and groups in attempts to further deal with their own ways and means of repatriation. For example, one of the Rasta settlers, Clifton Baugh, was a main representative for the Rasta community in palace discussions on the land grant with minister &quot;Ato&quot; Tesfi, and Baugh also continually delivered the first fruits of their produce to the palace in Addis right up until 1974 when stopped by the Derg Revolution.

When Haile Selassie I was assassinated in 1975, the new government of Mengistu Haile Mariam confiscated by the state due to the new governments Communist policy on privatization in which citizens were not allowed to own land.

In January 2005, there were reports in the media that Bob Marley&#x27;s remains were to be exhumed and reburied at Shashemane. His wife Rita Marley described Ethiopia as his spiritual home, provoking controversy in Jamaica, where his remains still lie. The following month, thousands of fans gathered in Shashamane for a month of celebrations for what would have been Marley&#x27;s 60th birthday. Rita Marley did not perform in Shashemane, Prime Minister Meles Zenawi created a new ethnic federalist parliament which further complicated things in the region. Tribal conflicts soon erupted and the history of Shashamane was undermined by the socialist administration of the Tigray People&#x27;s Liberation Front. Although TPLF had claimed to be socialist during its fight against the Derg regime, it abandoned it when it seized power. 

In January 2007, the settlers organized an exhibition and a bazaar in the city. It was also reported recently prior to the Ethiopian millennium that various pro-Ethiopian World Federation groups, consisting of indigenous Ethiopians and Rastafari, have given support to one of many five-year plans proposed for sustainable development of Shashemane, Ethiopia.

== Demographics ==
The 2007 national census reported a total population for this town of 100,454, of whom 50,654 were men and 49,800 were women. A plurality of the inhabitants practiced Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity, with 43.44% of the population reporting they observed this belief, while 31.15% of the population said they were Muslim, 23.53% of the population were Protestant, and 1.3% were Catholic.

The 1994 national census reported the town had a total population of 52,080, 25,426 of whom were males and 26,654 were females. It had an estimated 208,368 inhabitants in mid 2022.
There are four rivers (Laftu, Melka Oda, Gogeti and Essa) that flow through the town towards Lake Shala. Dhedhaba is another major river that serves as a natural boundary between Shashemene and Arsi Negele.

<doc id="1154363" wikidata="Q3877159" url="?curid=1154363" title="Stiperstones">
<text>The Stiperstones () is a distinctive hill in Shropshire, England. The quartzite rock of the ridge formed some 480 million years ago. During the last Ice Age Stiperstones lay on the eastern margin of the Welsh ice sheet. The hill itself was not glaciated though glaciers occupied surrounding valleys and it was subject to intense freezing and thawing which shattered the quartzite into a mass of jumbled scree surrounding several residual rocky tors. At above sea level it is the second-highest hill in the county, surpassed only by Brown Clee Hill (). Stiperstones&#x27; summit ridge is crowned by several jagged outcrops of rock, which may be seen silhouetted against the sky.

==Geography==

The Stiperstones is noted for its tors of quartzite. The principal ones are named as follows, from north-east to south-west:

* Shepherd&#x27;s Rock ()
* Devil&#x27;s Chair ()
* Manstone Rock ()
* Cranberry Rock ()
* Nipstone Rock ()
* The Rock ()

Manstone Rock is the highest of these at , and is topped with a trig point. The Devil&#x27;s Chair is the largest and best known.

The Stiperstones ridge is a good place to view the upland landscape of the Shropshire Hills, particularly the Long Mynd to the east, and also gives extensive views towards the North Shropshire plain and the hills of Mid Wales.

==Geology==
The tors are formed from heavily faulted Ordovician age, grey-white quartzose sandstones known as the Stiperstones Quartzite Formation. This Arenigian age rock unit which dips steeply to the WNW is between 120 and 325m thick. The western slopes of the hill dropping to Stiperstones village are formed in the overlying Mytton Flag Formation, whereas the eastern slopes are formed in the underlying, and hence older, mudstones of the Shineton Shale Formation. Faulting narrows the outcrop of the Mytton Flags along the southern part of the Stiperstones ridge and the mudstones of the Hope Shale Formation with their interbedded volcaniclastics form much of the afforested ground to the west. The outcrop of the Stipertones Quartzite continues south-southwest to Black Rhadley Hill and peters out just beyond Heath Mynd. To the north-northeast, it continues as far as Pontesbury.

Much of the ground around the tors is covered by head, a gravelly and bouldery deposit arising during the present Quaternary period and deriving from the rocks immediately beneath it. There are also some isolated peat deposits in places. Of particular note is the patterned ground surrounding the tors; some of the best examples of the periglacial features known as stone stripes and polygons in England.

==Wildlife and conservation==

The Stiperstones is a National Nature Reserve and Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). and is within the Shropshire Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. It is a haven for wildlife, with birds that are normally associated with upland areas present, including red grouse, Eurasian curlew, peregrine falcon and the rare ring ouzel.

Recently, a project called Back to Purple has commenced, to clear some of the hill of remaining plantations of coniferous and wooded areas, restoring the land to heather-based heath, with seasonal purple-flowering heather covering the summits around the tors and enhancing the views of the Stiperstones from the surrounding peaks and valleys. Back to Purple is managed by a partnership of Natural England, Forest Enterprise and the Shropshire Wildlife Trust. Their work has so far seen removal of thousands of pine trees and other conifers, including the whole Gatten Plantation (still shown on OS maps) and the previously covered Nipstone Rock has emerged from hiding. Thousands of heather seedlings have been successfully planted to supplement natural regeneration. To balance this out and complement it further work below summit level has also aimed at restoring grasslands, rich in herbs, hay meadows, wet flushes which produce bog cotton, Heath Bedstraw and the rarer Mountain Pansy and natural woodlands.

==Cultural references==
The general area has a long history of lead mining, most notably during the Roman occupation of Britain. Several pigs of lead have been found nearby, and the tradition continued into Victorian times.

The area around the Stiperstones is rich in myths and folklore relating to the rocks of the Devil&#x27;s Chair. According to one legend, the ghost of Wild Edric, a Saxon earl who held lands that were confiscated after 1066 and successfully defied the Normans, for a time at least, rides the hills whenever England is threatened by invasion. The Stiperstones feature in the literary works of Mary Webb, who drew it as The Diafol (translated from Welsh, &quot;Devil&#x27;s&quot;) Mountain in her novel &quot;The Golden Arrow&quot; (1916), of children&#x27;s author Malcolm Saville, and in a jazz work commissioned by Music at Leasowes Bank, written and performed by the Clark Tracey Quintet. D.H. Lawrence used the Stiperstones and the Devil&#x27;s Chair in particular as a setting for his novel &quot;St Mawr&quot; (1925).

The Half Man Half Biscuit album &quot;90 Bisodol (Crimond)&quot; contains a track entitled &quot;Descent of the Stiperstones&quot;.

An exaggerated version of the Stiperstones is included as a location in the 2020 video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla&quot;.

==Bog Mine and Visitor Centre==

Until the early 20th century lead was mined at The Bog, just west of Stiperstones. The mine at The Bog and the adjacent Stiperstones outcrop were only viable because of a geological movement; over time the movement of the tectonic plates landed at this site, combined with the movement of the earth it crumpled the layers and the softest layers were then eroded away. After mining stopped, the undisturbed remnants provided a range of wildlife habitats: birds nest in the old buildings, bats roost in the old mine tunnels, and reservoirs and ponds are ideal for aquatic life.

The Bog Visitor Centre is the main facility for visitors to the Stiperstones. It is housed in the former village school and retains its old interior design. It provides historical information about the past workers, mining, and present-day work to restore the landscape. Facilities at the centre include toilets and car parking (with facilities for the disabled including reserved parking, toilets and ramps). Activities include walking, with two main circular walks called Mucklewick Walk and Flenny Bank Walk and a variety of riding routes.

==2012 fire==
On 25 July 2012 part of the reserve was devastated by fire, said to have been a result of the sudden upturn in dry, hot weather coupled with the large amount of dry heather on the hills. More than 70 firemen battled the fire between 15.00 and 22.00 BST; smoke could be seen up to 10 miles away in the county town of Shrewsbury. Firefighters remained on site throughout the night because of the severity of the fire and the extent of the affected areas.

<text>John Henry Upshur (5 December 1823 – 30 May 1917) was an admiral in the United States Navy who served during the Mexican–American War and the American Civil War.

==Early life==
Upshur—born John Henry Nottingham in Northampton County, Virginia, on December 5, 1823—changed his name at the request of his mother to her maiden name &quot;Upshur&quot;, gratifying her wish, as the Upshur family was conspicuous in naval annals. He was appointed a midshipman on 4 November 1841 and initially served at sea with the Mediterranean Squadron. During the war with Mexico, Upshur was assigned to &quot;St. Mary&#x27;s&quot; as that brig participated in operations against Tampico. He also served ashore with the naval battery during the attacks against Vera Cruz in March 1847. Having completed his training both at sea and in the classroom, Upshur was graduated from the United States Naval Academy on 10 August 1848 as a passed midshipman.

In the years preceding the Civil War, Upshur carried out assignments in the Mediterranean, the West Indian, and the African Squadrons. He also performed brief tours of duty at the Naval Academy and at the Washington Navy Yard as an ordnance officer. From 1853 to 1856, Upshur served in &quot;Supply&quot; during Commodore Matthew Calbraith Perry&#x27;s expeditions to Japan which opened that nation to the west. He was promoted to lieutenant on 14 September 1855.

==Civil War==
Unlike cousin Robert E. Lee, Upshur stayed with the Union military during the American Civil War, resisting much family pressure to choose the Confederacy. He was assigned to the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, and participated in the capture of the Southern forts at Hatteras Inlet 1861 which opened the North Carolina sounds to Union forces. Upshur was executive officer of &quot;Wabash&quot; during the expedition which wrested Port Royal, South Carolina, from Confederate hands. He also commanded four boats in Commander C. R. P Rodgers&#x27;s expedition in the inland coast waters in the vicinity of Port Royal and Beaufort, South Carolina. Promoted to lieutenant commander, 16 July 1862, Upshur served in the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron in charge of the steamer from 1862 to 1863 during operations against Charleston. He returned to the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron in time for the abortive joint expedition against Fort Fisher late in December 1864. Upshur was in the expedition which finally carried the Southern works guarding Wilmington in mid-January 1865. He commanded the squadron flagship from 1863 to 1864 and the steamer USS &quot;A. D. Vance&quot; from 1864 to 1865.

==Post Civil War==
After the Civil War, Upshur served in a succession of sea and shore billets, promoted to commander, 25 July 1866, and given the USS &quot;Frolic&quot;, on the Mediterranean station, in 1865–1867. He also commanded from 1868 to 1870. Promoted to captain, 31 January 1872, Upshur commanded from 1872 to 1873 and , on the South Atlantic station, from 1875 to 1876. He served as a member of the board of inspectors in 1877–1880. He had a leave of absence, during which he visited Europe, in 1880, and upon his return was a member of the board of examiners. Promoted to commodore in July 1880, Upshur served as commandant of the New York Navy Yard from 1882 to 1884. Promoted to rear admiral in October 1884, he ended his service as commander of the Pacific Squadron from 1884 to 1885. Rear Admiral Upshur retired on 1 June 1885 and died from heart disease at his home in Washington, D.C. on 30 May 1917. He was interred at Arlington National Cemetery three days later.

He commissioned the building in 1884, with design by architect Frederick C. Withers, a Queen Anne home, later known as United States Daughters of 1812, National Headquarters.

==Namesake==
USS &quot;Upshur&quot; (DD-144) was named for him. The second USS &quot;Upshur&quot; (T-AP-198) was named for Major General William Peterkin Upshur, USMC.

<doc id="1154366" wikidata="Q2539485" url="?curid=1154366" title="Darkhawk">
<text>Darkhawk (Christopher Powell) is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character first appeared in &quot;Darkhawk&quot; #1 (March 1991), and was created by writer Tom DeFalco and artist Mike Manley. The character appeared in a series of self-titled comics from 1991-1995, then recurred in several limited-run series and multi-title events in the years since. The character&#x27;s origin is based on a link between a human character and an android from another dimension known as Null Space. The character has also appeared in non-speaking roles on television and video games.

==Development==

Writer Tom Defalco, spoke about the creation of the character stating, &quot;If I remember correctly–and I may not–I wanted Marvel to keep introducing new teenage heroes because the majority of our newsstand audience were teenagers or pre-teens. How did Darkhawk originate? I used a rejected bible that I had once prepared for Archie Comic&#x27;s The Fly as a starting point. I ran the proposal [past] Gruenwald and later submitted anonymously to Marvel&#x27;s creative panel…who approved it I wanted to write it myself, but I just couldn&#x27;t find the time… Besides Danny Fingeroth did a much better job than I could have and I still have forgiven him for that affront.&quot;

Co-Creator Mike Manley also spoke about designing the character, &quot;It&#x27;s hard to remember in the fog of time but I remember Howard Mackie asking me if I wanted to try out. I vaguely remember seeing a drawing that looked like a hawk headed Egyptian type guy in the office. I thought it was by Broderick. Anyway I thought it was a mix of Captain Marvel and Spidey. The body replacement thing. My thinking was influenced by that 70&#x27;s black Namor costume and the helmet would have a hawkish shape. The wings pop out so it wouldn&#x27;t look as dumb as Hawkman. I love Kubert and he made anything work but since Darkhawk was an android battle suit I figured it could have different configurations. The hawk claw grapple also a weapon like Wolverines claws made sense. Honey I wasn&#x27;t about all the teen stuff I hoped to do more space stuff. Which we only touched on before I left for DC. If I revisited the character today I still have ideas. But of course that is unlikely to happen since Marvel has never asked me to do anything with him since issue 25.&quot;

==Publication history==
Darkhawk appeared in a self-titled monthly series for 50 issues that was published by Marvel Comics from March 1991 to March 1995, and included three standalone annuals. Although created by DeFalco and Manley, DeFalco was never credited as a writer of the series. The original writer was Danny Fingeroth.

After his own series ended, Darkhawk co-starred or cameoed in other titles over the following years, such as &quot;New Warriors&quot;, &quot;Avengers/JLA&quot;, and &quot;Iron Man&quot;, eventually resurfacing in &quot;Runaways&quot; (vol. 2) #1–6, followed by &quot;Marvel Team Up&quot; (vol. 3) #15 and the short-lived &quot;Loners&quot; series. &quot;The New Warriors&quot; writer Fabian Nicieza said in 1992 that &quot;People keep coming up to me and asking, &#x27;Is Darkhawk a member of the New Warriors or not?&#x27; Well, yes and no. The New Warriors isn&#x27;t an official group with a rule book and charter and the like. They&#x27;re more of a club for super-powered teens. So if Darkhawk wants to hang out on a Friday evening and talk about his powers, then he&#x27;ll stop by the New Warriors&#x27; crash pad.&quot;

Darkhawk appeared within the Secret Invasion tie-in issues of &quot;Nova&quot; (vol. 4) (#17–18) and was the focus of the two-issue mini-series &quot;War of Kings: Darkhawk&quot;, written by C. B. Cebulski, Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning. &quot;War of Kings: Darkhawk&quot; brought closure to Chris Powell&#x27;s earthbound human relationships with his family and fellow Loners team members, and serves to establish a clean slate for the sequel series, &quot;War of Kings: Ascension&quot;, written by Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning.

Darkhawk appeared in &quot;Avengers Arena&quot;, a 2012–13 series by Dennis Hopeless and Kev Walker.

A new &quot;Darkhawk&quot; mini-series was published from 2021 to 2022.

==Fictional character biography==
Christopher Powell was born in Queens, New York. While witnessing his policeman father accept a bribe from a crime boss at an abandoned amusement park, teenager Chris Powell discovered a mysterious amulet. This amulet allowed him to switch places with a powerful android that his mind controlled. Powell vowed to use the amulet as &quot;an edge against crime.&quot; In this role, he worked with other superheroes and battled a number of costumed villains.

Darkhawk soon encountered his first supervillain, the Hobgoblin, and battled him alongside Spider-Man. He next fought Savage Steel, and then Portal. He next battled the U-Foes alongside Captain America. He battled the villain Lodestone, who attempted to remove his amulet. He battled Savage Steel again, this time alongside the Punisher. Darkhawk battled the cyborg Midnight, Thunderball, and the Secret Empire alongside Spider-Man, the Punisher, Night Thrasher, Nova, and Moon Knight. Darkhawk then battled assassins from the Foreigner&#x27;s 1400 Club. He battled Tombstone, who successfully removed his amulet from his chest.

Darkhawk occasionally worked with the New Warriors and was a provisional member of the West Coast Avengers. Darkhawk also battled a number of costumed villains, including the Brotherhood of Mutants.

 Powell discovered that the android was stored and repaired aboard a starship in a dimension called Null Space. When he used the amulet to access the android body, his human body switched places with it. Five Darkhawk amulets were commissioned by alien crime lord Dargin Bokk. The scientists who created the technology eventually used them to assault Bokk. After Bokk destroyed the other scientists two of the scientists beamed their minds to Earth and merged with two Earth scientists there. Byron/Ned Dobbs and Mondu/John Trane created a sixth amulet, which is the one that turned Christopher Powell into Darkhawk.

However, the events of &quot;War of Kings: Ascension&quot; cast doubt on how much of this—even the existence of Bokk himself—was real.

Later, Powell and Darkhawk were separated, with each possessing Powell&#x27;s memories. The Darkhawk body was then transformed into a new shape when it accidentally downloaded data from the ship, later re-emerging so that Powell could change back and forth between the two without teleporting to Null Space.

===Excelsior (the Loners)===
Powell later joined a group of former teenage superheroes who were struggling with their current lot in life called the Loners (formerly known as Excelsior). Members of this group included Phil Urich, Turbo, Lightspeed, and Ricochet. The group was hired by a mysterious benefactor – later revealed to be Rick Jones – to track down the Runaways in Los Angeles.

Powell displayed trouble controlling his anger in his Darkhawk persona, leading to a short skirmish with Turbo. Dismayed with himself, Powell admits to his teammates that he suffered a nervous breakdown. Powell decided to never turn into Darkhawk again, but this decision did not last long, as shortly thereafter the group battled Ultron. Darkhawk delivered the final blow, using a darkforce blast at point blank range to blow Ultron to pieces. Following the battle and the revelation of Jones&#x27; involvement, Excelsior opted to remain together and act as a more traditional superhero team.

Excelsior eventually change their minds about being superheroes and instead become a &#x27;superhero support group&#x27; due to the events of the superhuman Civil War rendering moot their original purpose to dissuade and/or help young superheroes cope with their powers/superhuman identities, as this role was now being officially fulfilled by the U.S. government (though Excelsior&#x27;s new group mission was also fulfilled by the U.S. government). However, a new addition to the group, Mattie Franklin convinces Powell to use his powers to help her take down the Mutant Growth Hormone dealers that moved to Los Angeles. Powell inconsistently displays his rage issues during this time, mostly acting as a peacemaker between Mattie and Ricochet after the three team up to battle crime.

===Secret Invasion===
Deciding to register with the government, Darkhawk is assigned to the position of Security Chief at Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S. During the Skrull invasion, he teams up with his old team-mate Nova for two issues of that character&#x27;s own title, but is also seen in the background of several issues thereafter.

===&quot;War of Kings&quot;===
Darkhawk is involved with the &quot;War of Kings&quot; event in a four-issue series written by Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning called &quot;War of Kings: Ascension&quot;. With the Loners series ending with low sales and unlikely to be followed with a sequel series, series writer CB Cebulski was assigned to write a two-issue &quot;War of Kings: Darkhawk&quot; series, with Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning co-scripting the second issue to ensure it tied into their own &quot;Ascension&quot; series.

A second Darkhawk armor appears near the Powell family home, and the unknown occupant of the armor forces Powell to transform to his own armored form shortly before an explosion rocks the immediate area.

Powell&#x27;s family survives the blast, but his mother is critically injured. The new Darkhawk introduces himself as Talon and claims to be part of the Fraternity of Raptors, an order created as &quot;the curators of history, and the custodians of the future,&quot; of which he and Powell are the last two members. He also explains that Powell&#x27;s anger issues are a direct result of the amulet not being designed to work with humans. Talon offers to assist Powell with the amulet, and after some deliberation he opts to do so; the two then retreat to the Negative Zone.

The story picks up in &quot;War of Kings: Ascension&quot;. Powell and Talon are fighting a group of Chitinauts, bug troops that serve Catastrophus, a lieutenant of Annihilus, but Talon&#x27;s brutal techniques horrify Powell. Later, Powell reveals that he wanted to be just like his friend Nova. Talon explains to him that the Nova Corps are nothing compared to the Fraternity of Raptors, referring to themselves as &quot;architects of fate&quot;. Eventually, after being tricked by Talon into fighting just as lethally, Powell manages to connect to the Datasong of the Null Source, which gives him visions of the true past of the Fraternity—a history of kidnappings and assassinations which lead Powell to conclude that the Fraternity are &quot;the bad guys.&quot; At this point, Talon attacks him, purging Powell&#x27;s consciousness from the armor, which manifests a new persona: Razor.

Talon and Razor then recover the Cosmic Control Rod from Catastrophus, Talon stopping briefly to implant a suggestion in the gestating Annihilus, and proceed onward. Powell&#x27;s personality is revealed not to have been wholly destroyed yet, and a vision of his father tells him that much of what he believed about the armor was false; the prior history, even Evilhawk himself, was a lie made up by his own mind, the other armor a second configuration that took control to cover earlier anger issues. Horrified, Powell&#x27;s psyche breaks free of the prison it was locked in, only for Powell to find himself on a great tree adorned with thousands of amulets like his own, where he encounters gargoyle-like creatures that urge him to return to the one which he has just emerged from. Meanwhile, in the Negative Zone, Talon and Razor offer Blastaar the Cosmic Control Rod in exchange for his assistance influencing the outcome of the War of Kings.

Powell encounters a Skrull on the tree mentioned earlier, who has a relationship with Talon much as Razor has with him. However, the Skrull also confides that humanity, as a newer race, cannot be wholly accounted for or controlled by the Raptors, and that Powell&#x27;s own outbursts of rage have been growing pains in his own control. With this understanding, Powell is able to reassert control over the Darkhawk armor, but not before Razor shoots several Shi&#x27;ar and kills Lilandra.

Powell later confronts Talon, and while he is able to force the other Raptor to release the Skrull temporarily, he is quick to begin asserting control again. The Skrull commits suicide to prevent Talon from manifesting, but not before he charges Powell with destroying the rest of the Raptor amulets before they can bring the Fraternity of Raptors back.

===&quot;Realm of Kings&quot;===
In &quot;Realm of Kings&quot;, the Shi&#x27;ar Imperium declares Darkhawk the &quot;Galaxy&#x27;s Most Wanted,&quot; making Powell an intergalactic fugitive. His old friend Nova, not willing to believe Powell could be a murderer, tracks him to the planet Shard, which is in danger of falling into a rift in space known as the Fault. Nova offers to help Powell clear his name, but they are interrupted by an attacking biomass from the Fault, and by the awakening of another Raptor, named Gyre. All three are trapped on the planet as it is disintegrated by the Fault.

Darkhawk finds himself saved, alongside Nova, by Nova&#x27;s old enemy the Sphinx, who seems unaware of Darkhawk&#x27;s presence. Together, the two heroes join past versions of Reed Richards, Black Bolt, and Namorita in helping the Sphinx combat his younger self. The young Sphinx draws his own warriors, including Gyre, into the battle, and Darkhawk faces and defeats Gyre in single combat, exorcising him from the Kree archaeologist he had possessed. During the fight, Gyre reveals that many more Raptors are re-awakening. Ultimately, the elder Sphinx defeats his counterpart, and mentally controls Darkhawk into giving him his younger self&#x27;s Ka Stone. Nevertheless, the heroes are able to defeat the double-powered Sphinx and return to their proper places in time (except Namorita, who is pulled into Darkhawk and Nova&#x27;s time).

Darkhawk returns to Earth and Project: Pegasus to help Nova fight the evil Quasar from the Cancerverse on the other side of the Fault. The evil Quasar damages Darkhawk so badly that his suit shuts down, leaving him alive but unable to accompany Nova as he goes to warn the universe about the threat posed by the Fault. Nova leaves Darkhawk in the care of Project: Pegasus&#x27;s medical team.

===&quot;Avengers Arena&quot;===
Darkhawk appears in &quot;Avengers Arena&quot; as part of the &quot;Marvel NOW!&quot; event. He is among the young superheroes that are abducted by Arcade and sent to Murderworld despite not being a teenager himself. Arcade expects his captives to fight to the death. Darkhawk is later attacked by an unidentified cybernetic creature, which tears his transformation amulet from his chest. The amulet is found by Chase Stein, who transforms into the new Darkhawk. The attacker was later revealed to be Death Locket (who was in turn controlled by Apex). When Death Locket stumbled into an underground facility, she comes across a room where Christopher Powell&#x27;s body is alongside the others who have died in battle. A few days later, when Death Locket and Apex raid the place, it is revealed Darkhawk is alive and Death Locket releases him. He then attacks and knocks out Arcade. Arcade soon talks Apex into letting the war play out, and she controls Death Locket into shooting Darkhawk in the shoulder. Once the series ended, Darkhawk was taken away to parts unknown, injured but reunited with his amulet.

===&quot;Infinity Countdown&quot;===
After the events of &quot;Avengers Arena&quot; as seen during the &quot;Infinity Countdown&quot; storyline, Powell is shown to have joined the New York Police Department and is engaged to a woman named Miranda, with whom he has shared his history as Darkhawk. He experiences frequent visions of the Tree of Shadows in Null Space despite the Darkhawk amulet being damaged and no longer allowing him to change form. One day, he is sent out to the Wonderland Amusement Park, the place where he first became Darkhawk, to investigate a disturbance. There, he is accosted by two dirty cops and almost attacked when he refuses their offer to take bribes. The group is soon attacked by two members of the Shi&#x27;ar Fraternity of Raptors, with one able to take Powell&#x27;s amulet and use it to change into a heavily damaged Razor. The Razor personality asserts control, defeats the other Shi&#x27;ar, and teleports Powell to the Datasong in a place it calls &quot;The Perch,&quot; where all of the android&#x27;s memories of its time with Powell are stored. Razor, now calling itself Darkhawk, tells Powell that his compassion and dedication to justice have imprinted upon it, with it wants to rejoin with him to stop the Shi&#x27;ar Raptors from releasing the true Fraternity of Raptor androids from Null Space. Powell accepts and becomes Darkhawk once more, merging in both body and mind with the Darkhawk android and gaining a new, more powerful form. Seeking a means to get to space, Darkhawk soon encounters Death&#x27;s Head, who is on Earth to collect a bounty for Darkhawk&#x27;s armor. After a brief scuffle, Darkhawk realizes that Death&#x27;s Head would have a spaceship and moves to strike a deal.

Before he goes, Powell says one last goodbye to Miranda, but upon arriving, the Raptors attack Death&#x27;s Head and swarm Darkhawk to a secret Shi&#x27;ar outpost, easily overpowering him in his Darkhawk armor. The Raptors&#x27; leader Gyre (who escaped the Null Space along with his fellow Raptors) goes on to reveal to Powell that the amulet is really the key to unleashing the Ratha&#x27;kon or Dark Starhawk, which the Shi&#x27;ar intended to be a &quot;predator&quot; to the Phoenix Force. However, to bring it to life, two tributes were required, one who&#x27;s willing and one who&#x27;s forced. Gyre wanted Powell&#x27;s amulet because of how special it was, since Powell actually convinced his amulet&#x27;s persona, Razor, to break free from the Fraternity&#x27;s stronghold, thus developing sentience. Gyre punches through Powell&#x27;s chest, leaving him for dead, and then uses his amulet as the forced tribute to fuse with the willing tribute, who turns out to be none other than Robbie Rider, thus allowing Ratha&#x27;kon to possess the latter&#x27;s body. Gyre then takes the Dark Starhawk and the Raptors to Earth — a place where the Phoenix loves to go — for a mysterious mission.

As Powell dragged himself across the ground, he encountered his other half Razor who revealed to him the origins of the Tree of Shadows, a creation of the Gardner and of the first Raptor who was of primitive Shi&#x27;ar/Skrull descent. After some coaxing from Razor, Powell tapped into his hidden strength and emerged with a new Darkhawk body after fully fusing his mind with the armor. Powell then flew after the Raptors to stop them.

Powell battled the Raptors with help from Death&#x27;s Head and Nova Prime. Nova made it difficult to fight Dark Darkhawk as he preferred to reason with his brother Robbie than fight him. Dark Darkhawk then shockingly turned on Gyre and destroyed him while stating that he would bring order to the universe, not Gyre. The Raptors were eventually stopped when Death&#x27;s Head rigged the power core of the Kree ship the Raptors stole to explode. Only Dark Starhawk survived the explosion, though stunned, allowing Powell to reclaim his Darkhawk Amulet. Dark Starhawk then disappeared in a flash of light after striking his Nega-Bands together. Grieving over the loss of Robbie, Nova angrily told Powell to stay on Earth or he would have him locked up. After Powell returned to Earth, he decided stay out of space for a while. Later that night, he was met by Sleepwalker while he dreamed, telling him that the influence of the Infinity Stones threatened the Mindscape and that the only way he could protect it was to become a Sleepwalker.

===&quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot;===
Chris would later turn up again at a meeting of great and powerful cosmic players set up by Starfox, brother of Thanos. While going over the deceased cosmic brigand&#x27;s last will and testament, this great congruence was attacked by the Black Order. Powell would later find himself stranded in the middle of deep space while being brought into the clutches of the Universal Church of Truth. They had him in a mental simulation where he believed himself to have been separated from Razor, run through and across time and space; seeing past, present and future iterations of himself while in the black hole, only to finally find release in the care of a ship piloted by the Kree, Shi&#x27;ar and Skrulls. Three races whom are known to be the bitterest enemies in the universe, his final hallucination stems to finding himself a child again while adorning his Raptor body. Something, he confirms to his shock and horror when he takes off his helmet only to see his child-like visage staring back at him in the mirror.

==Powers and abilities==
Darkhawk&#x27;s body is a Raptor, a techno-organic construct that possesses enhanced physical abilities, including strength, agility and reflexes, powered by the extraterrestrial amulet embedded in the chest, a seed from the Tree of Shadows in Null Space.

The retractable glider wings under his arms initially only allow him to glide on air currents, but Chris later discovers the ability to outright fly at variable speeds that let him soar from New York to California in a matter of hours. Later still, he has the ability to breach planetary orbit and traverse between planets within seconds. Even major injuries to his Darkhawk body can be repaired by switching back to his human form; his Darkhawk body teleports back to its holding space on the Darkhawk ship within Null Space, where it can be repaired almost instantly. This process does not work for his human body, however. In actuality, the Darkhawk ship does not really exist. Instead, the body currently not inhabited rests at the Tree of Shadows in Null Space. Because of Chris&#x27; incompatible human physiology, he is able to transform back and forth at will and assume control over the Raptor body when the Raptor&#x27;s own consciousness, known as Razor, should have taken control, though the information overload originally affects Chris&#x27; mind in ways such as creating a fantasy regarding the body&#x27;s origins and true nature. After becoming Darkhawk again during the events of &quot;Infinity Countdown,&quot; Chris and Razor become one. Chris discovers that now, whenever he changes into Darkhawk and vice versa, the amulet actually completely deconstructs and rebuilds his body from stored data. As the Darkhawk body is no longer separate from Chris and does not teleport to Null Space when not in use, it is questionable whether it can be repaired as quickly as it once was.

Darkhawk can project energy from the amulet in his chest as a focal point, either as concussive force blasts, or as a circular energy shield. Chris referred to his force blasts as &quot;darkforce blasts,&quot; until he encountered the actual Darkforce Dimension in New Warriors, but still occasionally uses the term. Darkhawk also has telescopic and infra-red vision, and a grappling hook cable/claw weapon on his right arm, which in later forms manifests on both arms.

For a time, Darkhawk was upgraded to a new body design, which gave him greatly enhanced powers. His amulet could project force bubbles in various shapes and he could combine his force fields and force blasts into a giant, hawk-shaped construct around his body. He could fire variable beams of energy from his eyes, be healed by generating an energy pod around his body, and had a single extendable claw on each wrist. He could also mentally communicate with the Darkhawk ship, and could teleport weapons from the ship when he was on Earth. At one point, he was outfitted with additional body armor on top of his android body. At some point after the cancellation of his own series, Darkhawk reverted to his original form under unrevealed circumstances, although he can still summon his second armored form. These abilities, as well as the Darkhawk body&#x27;s new form, are later revealed to actually be a component of the Raptor&#x27;s reconfiguration abilities.

His appearance in &quot;War of Kings&quot; is somewhat more reminiscent of his second costume, and he demonstrates the ability to freely reconfigure the armor into a multitude of forms with abilities that can cope with the current situation. His new forms include Strike Suit mode, featuring heavier armor and weaponry, Warflight mode, which allows for more aerial maneuverability, and Rescue mode, featuring enhanced sensors and the ability to ferry passengers. Since fully merging with Razor, Chris&#x27; Darkhawk form is far stronger and more versatile, able to more freely shift and reconfigure his armor, such as demonstrating the ability to assume a giant mecha-like form that is capable of housing passengers.

A Raptor is techno-mystical in nature, being versed in some forms of arcanum and magic. They can also create their own Stargates to shorten universal distances as well as access other dimensions like the Negative Zone.

The Raptor android body&#x27;s most prolific abilities exist within a hive mind dubbed &quot;The Datasong,&quot; a form of radio-telepathic infonet shared between all Raptors which enables vast clairvoyant and techno-psionic abilities, allowing for the absorption, processing, projection, sharing and manipulation of information and memory that is digitized then broadcast directly between their collective cyberminds as well as the mindscape of organic beings. Darkhawk can potentially use this function to control the minds of others as well as divine the myriad of possible future outcomes based upon differing actions. Powell often weaponized this function to drive out the normally parasitic android intelligence subverting an amulet hosts mind as the supplicant takes their place within their pod on the Tree of Shadows. A special place within the Datasong acts as a memory storage space called The Perch, a place where both the android A.I. and the mind of an amulet holder pool their shared experiences and mental engrams together like a backup drive. Every bit of data is conjoin coded bit by bit into one another, splicing the foreign personalities together whenever they change from robot body to pilot and back.

Darkhawk&#x27;s ability to reconfigure is actually revealed to be conscious self-adaptation rather than an inborn mechanical function. The very first Raptor android showed a spontaneous self-adaptive polymorphous ability gleaned from viewing its surroundings. The avian traits and natural ferocity were gained by imprinting on the early ancestors of the Shi&#x27;ar species. The shape-shifting capabilities were inherited by observing the primordial Skrull race.

In his human form, Chris Powell has no superhuman abilities, though he has taken some karate and kendo classes.

==Other versions==
===House of M===
Darkhawk appears as a member of Wolfpack.

===&quot;U.S. War Machine&quot;===
In the mini-series &quot;U.S. War Machine&quot;, set in an alternate universe, Darkhawk was a psychopathic android, which could only be controlled by running a virtual reality program. The program, a &quot;fiction&quot; within that universe, played out the events where Darkhawk had been a member of the West Coast Avengers within normal Marvel continuity. The program itself also appeared in the final pages of &quot;US War Machine 2.0&quot; in which Tony Stark&#x27;s damaged body is placed inside the Darkhawk program to keep him alive.

===&quot;Marvel Zombies&quot;===
In &quot;Marvel Zombies Dead Days&quot;, Darkhawk is seen in the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier as one of the dozens of heroes who survive the initial outbreak zombie plague. They all work to evacuate civilians to another dimension but this plan falls apart.

===&quot;Marvel Team-Up: League of Losers&quot;===
Darkhawk features in an arc of Robert Kirkman&#x27;s &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot; (vol. 3), featuring a group of C-list heroes dubbed &quot;The League of Losers&quot;. A group of heroes including Darkhawk, Dagger, Araña, Gravity, X-23, Speedball, Sleepwalker and Terror (although Araña dies along the way) go to the future to prevent the villain Chronok from stealing Reed Richards&#x27; time machine, Chronok having come to the present and already having killed all of Marvel&#x27;s major heroes.

It&#x27;s revealed that Chronok is from the same time period as Kirkman&#x27;s Mutant 2099; the group stays with him and his mentor Reed Richards to wait for Chronok. The team defeats Chronok, but at the end of the story, Richards reveals they can&#x27;t go back to their present, due to time-travel and alternate timelines. The group decides to stay in the future, satisfied with the impact they made, however unnoticed. Mutant 2099 suggests reforming the Avengers or the &quot;Fantastic Nine&quot;. Effectively trapped in the future, Chris begins a romantic relationship with Dagger. This team makes a cameo in &quot;Deadpool/GLI Summer Fun Spectacular&quot; (2007) at the end of the issue.

Note that due to the Marvel Universe&#x27;s method for resolving time travel paradoxes, this story occurred in an alternate universe.

Over the course of this adventure, Chris acts as the core of the &quot;League&quot;, serving as their leader and training the mostly novice heroes for their encounter with Chronok. Reed Richards remarks that while he had never thought of Darkhawk as leader material in the past, he is impressed by Chris&#x27; efforts.

During the various battles with Chronok and his army, Chris did not appear prone to irrational violence or uncontrollable anger while in his Darkhawk form, as he had during Excelsior&#x27;s encounter with the Runaways.

<doc id="1154378" wikidata="Q893322" url="?curid=1154378" title="Queensway, London">
<text>Queensway (formerly Queen&#x27;s Road) is a shopping street in Bayswater, an area of west London. It is home to Whiteleys, many restaurants, cafés, pubs, souvenir shops and a few high-street retail chains. Queensway and Westbourne Grove are identified in the London Plan as one of 35 major centres in Greater London. The street is numbered the B411 in the British road numbering scheme. Queensway is currently undergoing a major redevelopment on all sides, with a building on the top of the road being developed for £500m, Whiteleys for £1.2BN and a series of other redevelopments happening at the same time.

==History==
Bayswater and Lancaster Gate were first developed as residential suburbs of London in the early 19th century. Bayswater Road, for example, the road at the Bayswater southern end (Bayswater Road) was already a long-established route across the countryside, and a road roughly following the present Queensway can be seen on early maps running north from Bayswater Road across fields under the name of Black Lion Lane. It was subsequently renamed Queen&#x27;s Road after 1837 in honour of Queen Victoria, who had been born at nearby Kensington Palace: a name, however, which somewhat lacked distinctiveness, for this reason the present name of Queensway was eventually substituted a century later.

Near the northern end of the street was Whiteleys, on the site of London&#x27;s first department store, opened by William Whiteley in 1867. The store was awarded a Royal Warrant by Queen Victoria in 1896. The facade of the current building is from 1911, but the building itself was demolished and rebuilt in 1989.

The church of Our Lady Queen of Heaven, opposite Princess Court, was dedicated as a Roman Catholic church in 1954 by Cardinal Griffin; the Grade II listed neo-Gothic building dates from 1868, and was originally a United Methodist Free Church.

In recent years, Queensway has become a centre for the entertainment and leisure industry in London. London&#x27;s biggest ice rink, the Queen&#x27;s Ice &amp; Bowl in Queensway was recently renovated after investment and development by Robert Bourne (developer) and Bourne Capital. This has led the way for further developments in the area&#x27;s entertainment and leisure industry. Queensway&#x27;s retail industry is also booming with the famous Queensway Market showing significant growth in recent years.

==Modern Development==

It is reported that a Brunei family, in conjunction with Meyer Bergman and others, has acquired a large part of Queensway, which is bordered by the Notting Hill and Kensington areas, in order to re-develop it. The purchases include the Queensway Estate, location of the ice skating rink and Queensway Market, and the Whiteley&#x27;s shopping centre which was purchased from Standard Life Investments.

==Transport links==
Bayswater and Queensway tube stations are on Queensway.

Paddington station (a westbound terminus and set of tube stations), Royal Oak, Westbourne Park, and Notting Hill Gate stations are well within a kilometre. A c. 1916 oil painting of Bayswater tube station, when known as Queens Road (Bayswater), by Walter Sickert features a man seated in a recess and an arrangement of colourful advertisements which appealed to its buyer in 1919.

<text>The Runway bus is a front-side bus developed by Hewlett-Packard for use by its PA-RISC microprocessor family. The Runway bus is a 64-bit wide, split transaction, time multiplexed address and data bus running at 120 MHz. This scheme was chosen by HP as they determined that a bus using separate address and data wires would have only delivered 20% more bandwidth for a 50% increase in pin count, which would have made microprocessors using the bus more expensive. The Runway bus was introduced with the release of the PA-7200 and was subsequently used by the PA-8000, PA-8200, PA-8500, PA-8600 and PA-8700 microprocessors. Early implementations of the bus used in the PA-7200, PA-8000 and PA-8200 had a theoretical bandwidth of 960 MB/s. Beginning with the PA-8500, the Runway bus was revised to transmit on both rising and falling edges of a 125 MHz clock signal, which increased its theoretical bandwidth to 2 GB/s. The Runway bus was succeeded with the introduction of the PA-8800, which used the Itanium 2 bus.

Bus features

* 64-bit multiplexed address/data
* 20 bus protocol signals
* Supports cache coherency
* Three frequency options (1.0, 0.75 and 0.67 of CPU clock — 0.50 apparently was later added)
* Parity protection on address/data and control signal
* Each attached device contains its own arbitrator logic
* Split transactions, up to six transactions can be pending at once
* Snooping cache coherency protocol
* 1-4 processors &quot;glueless&quot; multi-processing (no support chips needed)
* 768 MB/s sustainable throughput, peak 960 MB/s at 120 MHz
* Runway+/Runway DDR: On PA-8500, PA-8600 and PA-8700, the bus operates in DDR (double data rate) mode, 
* resulting in a peak bandwidth of about 2.0 GB/s (Runway+ or Runway DDR) with 125 MHz

Most machines use the Runway bus to connect the CPUs directly to the IOMMU (Astro, U2/Uturn or Java) and memory.
However, the N class and L3000 servers use an interface chip called Dew to bridge the Runway bus to the Merced bus that connects to the IOMMU and memory.

<text>The Lappa Valley Railway is a minimum-gauge railway located near Newquay in Cornwall. The railway functions as a tourist attraction, running from Benny Halt () to East Wheal Rose (), where there is a leisure area with two miniature railways.

==History==

===Treffry&#x27;s Tramway===
In 1843, Joseph Treffry suggested building a tramway between Par and Newquay, with a branch line to the East Wheal Rose silver lead mine, which at the time was entering its most prosperous period. Treffry spent six years trying to overcome public opposition to the tramway and was forced to modify his intended route. The Treffry Tramways were eventually built from Newquay to St. Dennis with the branch line to East Wheal Rose, and the first load of ore left East Wheal Rose on 26 February 1849 in horse-drawn tubs. 1874 saw the Treffry&#x27;s network of tramways taken over by the Cornwall Minerals Railway, who introduced steam locomotives to the line.

===Great Western Railway===

The Great Western Railway took over the Cornish Minerals Railway in 1896, and incorporated the East Wheal Rose branch into a new railway from Newquay to Chacewater via. Perranporth. This new railway was opened in 1905, and enabled passengers to reach the market town of Truro much quicker than they had before. The Newquay to Chacewater branch line also proved popular for holidaymakers. The railway closed on 4 February 1963 under the Beeching cuts.

===Lappa Valley Steam Railway===
The Lappa Valley Steam Railway was established by Eric Booth in the 1970s. The trackbed was cleared of the thick undergrowth that had grown since the closure of the railway in 1963, and gauge track was laid for between Benny Halt and East Wheal Rose. A brand new steam locomotive &quot;Zebedee&quot; was built for the line by Severn Lamb, arriving in early 1974 with 4 locally-built carriages. The railway opened to the public on 16 June 1974. A large boating lake was dug at East Wheal Rose in 1975 to drain the area, and the whole East Wheal Rose area landscaped. More locomotives arrived from Longleat in 1976, with more carriages also being built at the time. In the 1970s a gauge railway was laid around a smaller boating lake, whilst a third railway, of gauge, running a further along the old trackbed was opened in May 1995.

In 2014 a new owner acquired the railway and made various improvements. A new visitor attraction called the &#x27;Engine Shed&#x27; opened in 2021.

==The route of Lappa Valley==
* Benny Halt
* East Wheal Rose

==East Wheal Rose==
At East Wheal Rose, the gauge Newlyn Branch Line and gauge Woodland Railway depart from the top station on the Newlyn Branch Line, where there is another children&#x27;s play area.

There are two lakes, the biggest being the boating lake, the second smaller lake being the wildlife lake, a crazy golf course and many children&#x27;s play areas. Also there are a gift shop and licensed café, and a brick path maze depicting the first steam locomotive built by Richard Trevithick, along with many walks through the valley.

<text>Joost Schmidt (Wunstorf, 5 January 1893 - Nürnberg, 2 December 1948) was a German typographer, a teacher and master at the Bauhaus, and later a professor at the College of Visual Arts, Berlin. He was a visionary typographer and graphic designer who is best known for designing the famous poster for the 1923 Bauhaus Exhibition in Weimar, Germany.

==Studies==
Schmidt studied art at the Grand-Ducal Saxon Academy of Fine Art in Weimar, before becoming a student at the Bauhaus School from 1919–1925, training in the wood-carving workshop. He became the master student of Max Thedy and received his diploma in painting in the winter semester of 1913/1914. When he first came to Bauhaus, Schmidt started a sculpting apprenticeship with Johannes Iiten and Oskar Schlemmer. As time went by, he became very proficient with applied graphics, having his poster displayed at the Bauhaus exhibition in 1923.

==Teaching==
Joost Schmidt taught lettering at the school from 1925–1932; head of the sculpture workshop from 1928-1930. He was also head of the Advertising, Calligraphy, Printing, and Graphic Design department from 1928 to 1932. His focus was on geometry and shapes being included in the overall designs in art. The concepts that he taught were the contrasted theory of both elementary form and bodies being applied to space. In the years of 1929-1930, he taught life and figure drawing classes for upper division work.

==Family==
Joost was one of three children, and endured a difficult upbringing. He pursued his work as a graphic designer despite much resistance from the Nazis. After receiving his diploma in 1914 in painting, he served in the military and was briefly a prisoner of war until he returned to his work in Germany in 1918. In 1925, he married the Bauhaus student Helene Nonne.

<text>The Shade (Richard Swift) is a comic book character developed in the 1940s for National Comics, first appearing in the pages of &quot;Flash Comics&quot; in a story titled &quot;The Man Who Commanded the Night&quot;, scripted by Gardner Fox and illustrated by Hal Sharp. Debuting as a villain, the Shade was best known for fighting against two generations of superheroes, most notably the Golden Age and Silver Age versions of the Flash. He eventually became a mentor for Jack Knight, the son of the Golden Age Starman, Ted Knight, a hero the Shade had also fought.

Though portrayed in Silver Age comics as a thief with a cane that could manipulate shadows, the character was reinvented in 1994 as a morally ambiguous Victorian-era immortal who gained the ability to manipulate shadows and immortality from an unexplained mystical event. In 2009, the Shade was ranked as IGN&#x27;s 89th-greatest villain of all time.

The Shade appeared as a major character from the season 1 finale onwards in &quot;Stargirl&quot;, played by Jonathan Cake.

==Publication history==
The Shade first appeared in &quot;Flash Comics&quot; #33 (September 1942), and was created by Gardner Fox and Harold Sharp.

Shade received a solo series in late 2011, written by Robinson and drawn by Cully Hamner, Darwyn Cooke, Javier Pulido, and others. It deals with Shade and his descendants, flashing back to various points in his life as he travels the globe trying to find who is behind a plot to kill him.

==Fictional character biography==
The &#x27;Shade&#x27; draws his alias from Dante Alighieri&#x27;s epic poem &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot;, specifically its first book, &quot;Inferno&quot;, which describes the Nine Rings of Hell. This poem is the most cited depiction of Hell, and the various characters in the story referred to as &quot;the Shade&quot; are references to the perpetual darkness of Hell itself. Shade uses his power of perpetual night to cast a blanket of darkness over various parts of the world.

===Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot;===
The Shade was introduced in &quot;Flash Comics&quot; #33, as a villain for the original Flash, Jay Garrick. He was portrayed in his first and only Golden Age appearance as a thief with a machine that caused darkness by removing light-reflecting dust particles; in later Silver Age stories he instead used a magical cane which could manipulate shadows. He fought both Garrick and the second Flash, Barry Allen. He was a member of several supervillain teams, including the Injustice Society. Shade was one of three villains used for the first meeting of the two heroes in the &quot;Flash of Two Worlds&quot; story, which reintroduced the Golden Age Flash to the Silver Age. He was jailed along with the Wizard and the Fiddler.

In the &quot;Crisis on Earth-S&quot; story, King Kull paired Shade up with Doctor Light, Joker of Earth-Two, and Weeper of Earth-S to wipe out humanity on Earth-S. With Doctor Light he causes perpetual night and darkness on either side of the planet, but is met by Bulletman and Hawkman.

===Post-&quot;Crisis&quot;===
The Shade returned in print in 1986, as a member of the Wizard&#x27;s new incarnation of the Injustice Society. The Shade&#x27;s next appearance was in a flashback story in &quot;Secret Origins&quot; #50 (1989), which presented a post-&quot;Crisis&quot; retelling of &quot;Flash of Two Worlds&quot;.

===Post-&quot;Zero Hour&quot;===
After &quot;Zero Hour&quot;, the Shade&#x27;s origin was changed drastically. The Shade was retconned to be a 19th-century English man named Richard Swift who gains his powers from an unexplained mystical tragedy and sustains amnesia. Coincidentally, a passerby named Piers Ludlow offers to take in Swift while he recovers. The whole affair is a setup; the Ludlow family is in fact a band of killers and swindlers, who have grown wealthy killing their wealthy business partners and then killing a vagrant in the vicinity to give the impression of a failed robbery/homicide. Before they can make Swift their next scapegoat, he reflexively unleashes his shadows, killing all the present Ludlows. Only a young pair of twins, absent from the excursion, survive.

Decades later, Swift is ambushed by Rupert Ludlow, one of the surviving twins, and kills him. Afterward, he leaves England and becomes an adventurer and assassin. While traveling, he meets Brian Savage (Scalphunter) and visits Opal City for the first time. He establishes himself in Opal, acquiring real estate and generally living well, even encountering Oscar Wilde. During his journeys, he meets a similar immortal born of the same incident and bearing his same powers, a dwarf by the name of Simon Culp, who becomes his mortal enemy.

During all of the Shade&#x27;s escapades, he is pursued by the Ludlows, whom he kills by the dozens. He is nearly killed by one Ludlow, Marguerite Croft, when he falls in love with her in Paris during the 1930s. She tries to kill Shade with poison, but is unsuccessful. Shade survives and is forced to kill Marguerite when she confesses that though she loves him, her loyalty to her family would force her to make more attempts on his life. This leaves Shade with a sense of general depression and the feeling he could never love again. Because of this and the death of Brian Savage, he resumes his activities as an assassin.

During World War II, he leaves America to defend England, and fights Simon Culp again. An exploding bomb causes Culp&#x27;s body to fuse inside Shade&#x27;s body. Unaware of this, the Shade returns to Keystone City. This was the time of the Golden Age of Heroes, and of them all he chooses Jay Garrick, the first Flash, as his adversary. During this time, Culp is able to subtly affect the Shade&#x27;s behavior, and was even able to take over Shade&#x27;s body completely when the latter is tired.

When the Flash retires in the 1950s, a new hero called the Spider takes his place. Shade investigates the Spider&#x27;s background and discovers he is both a criminal (using his role to get rid of the competition) and a Ludlow by birth. Ludlow&#x27;s move to Keystone City was part of his plan to kill the Shade. Shade instead kills the Spider, and rescues Flash and his wife from a murder attempt.

During the 1960s, Shade briefly teams up with Doctor Fate to take down one of Culp&#x27;s criminal ventures, a mystic organization called the Wise Fools, who wished to repeat the ritual that created him by summoning a wild, uncontrolled bubble of shadow (actually Culp&#x27;s shadow, separated from the Shade by Culp). Unaware that Culp&#x27;s consciousness is actually within the Shade, he and Dr. Fate destroy the Wise Fools operation and throw the bubble into an empty dimension (where it continues to grow in power and size). This was all part of Culp&#x27;s larger plan, one which almost culminates in the destruction of Opal City.

===&quot;Starman&quot; (vol. 2)===
James Robinson gave the character a starring role in his new &quot;Starman&quot; series in 1994. In the first story arc, &quot;Sins of the Father&quot;, Jack believes Shade to be his enemy when he kidnaps Jack&#x27;s father, retired Starman Ted Knight, on the orders of the senile Mist, who wishes for a final showdown. Shade later betrays the Mist by allying himself with the O&#x27;Dare family, a clan of police officers who assist Jack in the memory of their father Billy O&#x27;Dare, a policeman who had often assisted the original Starman. Shade, with the O&#x27;Dares, assaults the Mist&#x27;s hideout and rescues Ted Knight. Shade befriends the family&#x27;s &quot;black sheep&quot;, Matt O&#x27;Dare.

Much of the Shade&#x27;s past is revealed through journal entries included in the &quot;Starman&quot; comics, including the flashback issues called &quot;Times Past&quot;. They often deal with different Starmen, including Jack&#x27;s father Ted, as well as other characters from the Starman mythos, such as Brian Savage. There were a total of 10 &quot;Times Past&quot; issues in the 80-issue series. &quot;Excerpts&quot; from the Shade&#x27;s journal often replaced the &quot;Starman&quot; letters column, frequently giving additional background related to the story or background into Shade&#x27;s motivations. These excerpts are written as prose, as opposed to a more traditional comic style, with occasional illustrations, and as journal entries being written by the Shade himself at different points in his existence.

Shade has an active part in an adventure of Jack&#x27;s involving a demon hidden within a poster that can snatch innocent people and drag them into Hell. Shade does not like Merritt, the human guardian of the poster, who has gained immortality for his protection of it, and was the inspiration for Wilde&#x27;s &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;. In a fight for possession of the poster, Matt O&#x27;Dare is dragged within and Shade follows. Inside the poster, Shade, Jack and Matt separately agree to sell their souls in exchange for the liberation of all the souls contained within. The demon, unable to accept a selfless deal, is forced to release everyone (but takes Merritt&#x27;s soul instead). Matt decides to turn over a new leaf and put his crooked past behind him. Shade assists him in his efforts, while influenced by the revelation that O&#x27;Dare is the reincarnated lawman Scalphunter, who happens to be an old friend.

A particularly important point in the life of Shade comes when he meets the demon-lord Neron. Neron offers, as he has done so with many supervillains before him, to enhance Shade&#x27;s power. Shade sees little use in Neron&#x27;s offer, as he has no need to increase his already substantial wealth, sees no way of heightening his shadows&#x27; power and is already immortal. Neron, angered by his rejection, swears vengeance against Shade.

Over the years the Ludlow attacks have dwindled. This lasts until the wife of the last Ludlow calls him to talk her husband out of attempting an attack that would certainly cost him his life. Shade talks Ludlow out of pursuing his family&#x27;s vendetta, burying a legacy of hate that has lasted more than 150 years.

Another notable point during the series&#x27; run came when the Godwave struck the DC universe, depowering almost all superheroes. In a confrontation between Starman, Matt O&#x27;Dare, Green Lantern, and the Infernal Doctor Pip, Pip almost blows up a large section of an Opal skyscraper, but Shade appears at the last minute and draws Pip into the Darklands, which serve as his power source, before the bomb can explode.

At various times, Culp is able to take control over or subtly influence Shade. At one point, Culp takes full control to talk to Jack, in the process making a mistake about the name of a Wilde story. Around the time Jack returns from space in the &quot;Stars, My Destination&quot; story arc, Culp is able to assume full control over Shade&#x27;s body for an extended period of time and imprison or neutralize most of Opal City&#x27;s heroes in a bid to loot and destroy Opal - with seemingly no motive other than to destroy what Shade loves most. Gathering an army of villains whom Jack has battled over the course of the series, Culp absorbs Shade&#x27;s powers, in addition to the shadow force Shade and Dr. Fate had exiled decades before, to cast a spell allowing him to trap Opal City in an impenetrable bubble of shadow and force a confrontation with the city&#x27;s heroes. Many of the supervillains helping Culp have been gathered by either Neron, the still-vengeful daughter of the Mist, or one of the last Ludlows in existence: the son of the false hero the Spider. This story is the climax of the series, told in the &quot;Grand Guignol&quot; story arc.

Shade eventually is able to cast out Culp, while losing his shadow powers in the process. However, Culp underestimates the Shade, and is tricked into allowing a small shadow imp loyal to Shade to be absorbed into his own shadow, leading to a battle of wills in which Shade draws all the darkness into himself, leaving Culp powerless. Culp attempts to buy his freedom by threatening the younger Mist, but is killed by the elder Mist. This is a turning point for Shade, as he now has freedom of choice, and is able to decide whether he wishes to remain a villain or become a true hero. He is present at the final showdown with the Mist and leaves the building with Ralph Dibny, Jack and Theo Kyle Knight.

===Post-&quot;Starman&quot; (vol. 2)===
Since the end of the &quot;Starman&quot; (vol. 2) series, the Shade has made cameo appearances in several comic series, including &quot;Green Arrow&quot; and &quot;JSA&quot; and was listed alongside magical-based villains such as Felix Faust and Circe. He also has a brief appearance in DC&#x27;s &quot;Brave New World&quot; in 2006. During the &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, he is seen using his powers to help Opal citizens by protecting the buildings they are in (though, in a remark full of his trademark cynicism, he comments he is not doing it to save the citizens themselves, but, rather, he is &quot;saving the architecture&quot;).

He shows up in Robinson&#x27;s &quot;Justice League: Cry for Justice&quot;, waiting for his old rival Jay Garrick in his home. He informs Garrick that the insane supervillain Prometheus has ordered a series of attacks on various superheroes (including Batwoman, Barry Allen, Crimson Avenger, and Stargirl) to distract them from a sinister master plan. Shade accompanies Jay to the JLA Watchtower to warn the other heroes of the impending doom. He and Jay arrive at the Watchtower just as Prometheus (who had disguised himself as Freddy Freeman and defeated the entire League) attempts to escape. Though Jay is easily floored, the Shade proves difficult to defeat, and ultimately ends up stopping Donna Troy from killing the supervillain after he has been beaten into submission. The Shade later creates a portal that gives Green Arrow access to Prometheus&#x27; otherdimensional lair, where the archer kills Prometheus in revenge for Star City, the dismemberment of his former protege Red Arrow, and the death of Red Arrow&#x27;s daughter.

During the &quot;Blackest Night&quot; storyline, Shade is in a relationship with Hope O&#x27;Dare, and claims that he is in love with her. After a night of sex, Shade and Hope are confronted by David Knight, reanimated as a Black Lantern. David rips out Shade&#x27;s heart, but, due to his powers, he survives as he is unable to be killed, which allows Shade to resist the call of a black ring that seeks to turn him into another undead Lantern. After David threatens to kill Hope and later Jack, an enraged Shade uses his powers to trap the Black Lantern within the Shadowlands after decrying the Lantern as a mockery and a fake, saying he has &quot;no light of his own&quot;, and uses his own heart as a channel to bind and banish him. Afterwards, Hope admits that she loves Shade as well, and they depart from the scene of the battle.

Shortly after the events of &quot;Blackest Night&quot;, the Shade is approached by Hal Jordan and Barry Allen, and he takes them to the Ghost Zone where they find the rotting corpse of Prometheus.

During &quot;Brightest Day&quot;, Jay Garrick arrives at the Shade&#x27;s home with Doctor Mid-Nite, Sebastian Faust, and Wildcat to enlist his help in tracking down the missing Obsidian, who possesses abilities similar to those of the Shade. After entering the house, the JSA members find Obsidian and Doctor Fate standing over the Shade&#x27;s comatose body. Obsidian, now possessed by a cosmic entity known as the Starheart, tells the heroes that the Shade would have told them his &quot;secrets&quot;, and that the Starheart commanded that he and Fate silence him. Following the defeat of the Starheart, Congorilla mentions that the Shade has been missing since his assault at the hands of Obsidian, and that nobody has been able to contact him.

Shade&#x27;s disappearance is explained shortly after this, when it is revealed that he had been captured and brainwashed by Eclipso. Realizing that Shade could turn the tide of the battle, Saint Walker sends the Atom and Starman inside his body to fight off the effects of Eclipso&#x27;s brainwashing. The heroes narrowly manage to free the Shade&#x27;s mind, and he turns against Eclipso and ultimately helps the Justice League defeat the villain once and for all.

===&quot;The New 52&quot;===
In September 2011, &quot;The New 52&quot; rebooted DC&#x27;s continuity. In this new timeline, a 12-issue series has the Shade survive an assassination attempt, then travel the world to uncover the people behind it. Along the way he deals with his past before the shadows, as well as the encounters he had with his descendants through the years. It is also explained how he first met Culp, and exactly how he gained the shadow powers.

===&quot;DC Rebirth&quot;===
In 2016, DC Comics implemented another relaunch of its books called &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;, which restored its continuity to a form much as it was prior to &quot;The New 52&quot;. Iris West, Barry Allen and Wally West II get sucked into the Shadowlands. Separated from Iris, Barry and Wally meet up with the Shade, who reveals he has lost control of his shadows. His shadows have also kidnapped Hope, and both she and Iris are corrupted by the Shade&#x27;s darkness. The Flashes and Shade are able to free Hope and Iris from the shadows, with the Shade regaining his powers as well as reconciling with Hope O&#x27;Dare.

===Possible futures===
During the &quot;Starman&quot; story arc &quot;Stars, My Destination&quot;, Jack Knight is thrown by a shadowy corridor created by a future Shade across time and space into a future where Shade&#x27;s powers overtake him due to a disease that Culp had infected him with during their final battle. His shadow begins expanding into the universe and threatens areas protected by the Legion of Super-Heroes. Rescuing him, the future Shade explains how Jack may be able to stop it from ever happening by using his cosmic rod on him in the past. He later opens another time portal to allow Jack to journey across time again to reach his destination, Throneworld.

&quot;Starman Annual&quot; #1 shows a possible future for Shade as the protector of a Utopian planet thousands of years from the present. As with the current Shade, he enjoys telling tales of his past. The planet&#x27;s technology and possibly the planet itself seemed to be made almost entirely out of Cosmic Rod technology inspired by Starman and his legacy.

==Powers and abilities==
Shade can channel the power of the Shadowlands, which is a partially sentient, extra-dimensional mass of malleable darkness. He can use it for many effects, both as an absence of light and a solid substance: he can summon and control &quot;demons&quot;, project as shields and conjure areas of complete darkness, create all kinds of constructs out of shadows, transport himself and others through it over great distances, and can use it as a prison dimension. The darkness itself can be dispelled by sufficiently bright blasts of light or energy. Eventually, his experience with the shadows allows him to create corridors through time. The shadows have also granted Shade agelessness and immortality. Dr. Fate once remarked that even the Spectre would have serious difficulty dealing with the Shade, possibly due to the origin of his powers (the former realm of a divine entity on par with God). He is heavily resistant to damage, as seen when a demolition bomb falls on him, leaving him only slightly dazed. Even with his heart torn out of his chest by Black Lantern David Knight, he remained alive and unable to die.

His only weakness is that if he loses his shadow, he becomes vulnerable. However, this can only occur if a survivor from the same event in 1838 drains him of it, or in the event of a light strong enough to completely surround him to the point that he is unable to cast a shadow. Prometheus was briefly able to stun Shade with a brief burst of light.

<text>Winnipegosis is an unincorporated urban community in the Rural Municipality of Mossey River, Manitoba, Canada. It lies at the mouth of the Mossey River on Lake Winnipegosis in west-central Manitoba.

The community was once categorized as a village, but this status was relinquished on 1 January 2015 upon its amalgamation with the RM of Mossey River.

== History ==
The first Europeans to come to the Winnipegosis area were early explorers and fur traders, with the mouth of Lake Winnipegosis&#x27; Mossey River serving as a meeting place for many trappers and traders throughout the year to do business and purchase supplies. The first traders were men of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. Others, who arrived a bit later for trapping and fishing, were English, Scottish, French, and German.

In the late 1700s, the original Fort Dauphin was constructed by descendants of the French explorer LaVérendrye.

The railroad arrived in the area in 1897, whereafter Ukrainians and other Central Europeans came to the area.

In 1898, the community&#x27;s post office name was changed to &quot;Winnipegosis&quot;, when it joined other buildings moved to the new townsite.

In 1900, Icelandic fishermen came by boat, bringing cattle, to settle at Red Deer Point on the west side of the lake, around 20 miles from present-day Winnipegosis.

On March 10, 1915, the Village of Winnipegosis was incorporated as a municipality, with Joseph P. Grenon as the first mayor. The Lieutenant Governor of Canada proclaimed the community as a village the following month.As the fur trade had ended by this time, the community found its main economic activities to be in timber and fishing.

Winnipegosis remained a village until January 1, 2015, when it was amalgamated with the Rural Municipality of Mossey River.

=== Etymology ===
The community takes its name from the lake on which it is situated: Lake Winnipegosis. The lake&#x27;s name, which has evolved through different spellings, came from the Cree word &quot;win-nipi&quot; (meaning &#x27;muddy/murky waters&#x27;) and the suffix &quot;-osis&quot; (meaning &#x27;little&#x27;), as diminutive of Winnipeg, which means &#x27;muddy waters&#x27;.

Mossey River was spelled &quot;Mossy&quot; prior to 1900.

===Commerce===
Various forts of different companies, such as the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC), have stood on this site. The mouth of Mossey River was the site of the original Fort Dauphin fur trading post, constructed by the son of French explorer Pierre Gaultier de Varennes, sieur de La Vérendrye, in the late 18th century.

The peak of the community&#x27;s economic boom occurred during the settler-era fur trade and 20th century timber and fishing industries.

Emil Hartman was the inaugural postmaster from 1896–1905. The Dauphin railway that arrived in late 1897 named the station after the lake. In 1898, the post office name changed from &quot;Mossy River&quot; to &quot;Winnipegosis&quot;, when it joined other buildings moved to the new townsite. That year, the community possessed 2 hotels, 2 boarding houses, 3 general stores, a butcher, a blacksmith, a 30-man sawmill, and 2 larger fish trading companies (North West Fish Co. and The Armstrong Trading Co, subsidiary of Booth Fisheries Co.).

In early 1906, Joseph Grenon Jr. began a mink ranch across the river, from where he sold the animals and furs to Moncton, New Brunswick.

In 1924, Peter McArthur (Standard Lumber Co.) opened the first sawmill that operated until the planer mill burned down. The Albion Hotel, closed 1908–1911, was renamed Hotel Winnipegosis. Fire destroyed the Lake View Hotel in 1914.

Telephone connections came in 1912; the 1915 directory listed five subscribers. A Bank of Ottawa branch, which opened in 1919, became a Bank of Nova Scotia after the merger that year. The first ice-cream parlour possessed the first radio in 1921.

In 1935, schoolteacher Paul Rudiak (–1975) established the Rudiak Flour Mills, for which Jack Mason was the miller.
In 1950, a wooden grain elevator was built at Winnipegosis by National Grain. Around 1956, its initial 55,000-bushel capacity was increased to 85,000 bushels by the construction of a balloon annex on its southern side. Sold to Cargill Grain in 1975, the building was closed in April 1981, and demolished in March 2021.

The Winnipegosis Credit Union, formed in 1953, merged into the Dauphin Plains Credit Union in 1970, and further mergers followed.

===Education, religion, and entertainment===
The school district formed in 1899, and a 120-pupil-capacity school was erected the following year. W.J. Coleman was teacher to the 73 students. Staff increased to two in 1906, three in 1913, and four in 1914. The two-storey brick building, which opened that year, remained in use until 1960. When fire destroyed the former building in 1919, a church provided temporary accommodation, until a new two-classroom building opened in the early 1920s.

The open-air skating rink established in 1935 was replaced 20 years later. Hockey players and the curling club used several rinks, at various locations, from 1903 onward.

In 1955, a new four-classroom building opened for the collegiate (senior school). Secondary education came under the control of Duck Mountain School Division #34 in 1958, and the elementary followed in 1967. In 1960, the elementary school was rebuilt on 14 acres west of the village, and the collegiate was rebuilt on the original campus. Additional classroom space and gyms augmented both campuses in the 1970s.

==== Religion ====
The Dauphin Methodist district added Mossey River to its preaching circuit in 1896. C.T. Currelly, appointed missionary during summer 1899, ministered throughout Valley River, Fork River, and Mossey River. The Winnipegosis church building opened on August 25, 1901. In 1925, the congregation became part of the United Church. Closed in 2012, the property was sold. Anglican missionary Henry Herbert Scrase, based at Fork River, was known to have held church services and Sunday school at the Winnipegosis schoolhouse 1908–1912. A surplus schoolhouse, moved from Fork River in 1927, became the new church building. Closed in 1967, the property was sold in 1969. Over the years, the rectors of St. Paul&#x27;s Dauphin, came to administer the sacraments.
Knox Presbyterian opened in 1901, but only a Sunday school outreach 1913–1925, was served by a series of student ministers, a lay minister 1957–1969, and then the ministers for St. James, Dauphin. With a Roman Catholic presence since 1905, the Corpus Christi Church that opened in 1939 replaced a smaller building. The Ukrainian Catholic Church, built in 1929, is a listed historic place.

The Nordheim Mennonite congregation in Winnipegosis began services in 1931, and formally organized in 1933. The initial building served 1934–1964, until replaced to a more central location. The transition from German to English services occurred in the 1960s. A separate Mennonite Brethren congregation existed 1939–1968.

The Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, that functioned c.1946–1987, moved a building from Valley River in 1966. After meeting for years in homes, the Seventh Day Adventist building opened in 1957. Having met in various facilities the previous year, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church moved a building from Dry River in 1961. Soon too small for the congregation, a new building was erected in 1965.

The Rex Hall, opened in 1915, was the venue for concerts, dances, balls, and various events. Sidney Coffey screened movies at a rented hall, before building the Rex. A tea room, confectionary, and balcony were later added. The theatre, seating about 250, closed in 1967.
===Healthcare and social services===
Dr. A. Ernest Medd (1883–1946) established the first practice in 1909. On marrying Mary Agnes McArthur, they resided the rest of their lives on 2nd St. His patients covered a wide area, and his role as coroner stretched as far as Swan River. Their house has become a museum.

The Sisters of St. Benedict of Winnipeg administered the 20-bed Crerar Hospital 1936–1966 on the grounds of the Corpus Christi Church. The 22-bed Winnipegosis General Hospital opened in 1966, and the 20-bed Personal Care Home in 1980–1981. The Winnipegosis &amp; District Health Centre oversees these facilities.

The Elks Lodge #108 has remained active at least since 1925, before the Manitoba Elks Association formally received its Charter in 1927. The Royal Purple Lodge #86 has operated since 1945. The Marv Elks Memorial Home for seniors opened in the mid-1960s.

The Knights of Columbus #6798 existed from 1975 for about 30 years.

The first ambulance, acquired in 1975, was garaged at the hospital from 1982.

===Public services===
Prior to the 1915 establishment of a police post, serious crime in the community was handled by outside constables. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) was contracted from 1969–1972 and 1982 onward.

The municipal cemetery was created in 1916. At a 1919 commemoration service, returned soldiers placed flowers on the graves of war dead. The next year, the site was staked into plots. The government dock was built in the mid-1920s.

A volunteer fire brigade formed in 1933, and a fire hall was built in 1950, which was replaced in 1980.

In 1937, electric power came and the first street lights were installed.

First Street (Main Street) was widened and paved in 1961. Water and sewerage pipes were installed in 1965. The village purchased the former train station building in 1977 for a museum, leasing the grounds from CN.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Winnipegosis had a population of 945 living in 388 of its 481 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 617. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

== Economy ==
Winnipegosis has an economy including restaurants, museums, gas stations, a hotel, financial institutions, grocery stores, hair dressers, a pharmacy, nine-hole golf course and hardware store. The community also has a Royal Canadian Mounted Police detachment, a volunteer fire department, and ambulance service. Today, ranching, agriculture, fishing, tourism and seniors&#x27; services provides the community with its present and future economic prosperity.

=== Ecology ===
Big game, moose, elk, deer, various fur-bearing animals, game birds, ducks, geese, and every northern species of songbird are indigenous to the region.

The area is a popular place for hunting and fishing. American black bear hunting is a growing industry in the Winnipegosis area. With its proximity to Lake Winnipegosis and many small surrounding lakes, it is a haven for migratory game birds and attracts many ducks and geese. There is both commercial and recreational fishing, as there are walleye and an assortment of other Manitoba freshwater fish.

The first sturgeon in Lake Winnipegosis were brought by Captain Alex Vance from Grand Rapids in 1897. Sturgeon is strictly a Lake Winnipeg fish and do not thrive in the salty water of Winnipegosis.

<text>Himroo is a fabric made of silk and cotton, which is grown locally in Aurangabad. Himroo was brought to Aurangabad in the reign of Mohammad Tughlaq, when he had shifted his capital from Delhi to Daulatabad, Aurangabad. The word himroo originated from Persian word Hum-ruh which means &#x27;similar&#x27;. Himroo is a replication of Kinkhwab, which was woven with pure golden and silver threads in former times, and was meant for the royal families.

Himroo uses Persian designs, and is very characteristic and distinctive in appearance. Himroo from Aurangabad is in demand for its unique style and design. Some historians believe that Himroo was the innovation of local craftsmen with very little Persian influence.

==History==
According to historians this art originated in Persia, though it has not been proved, himroo is associated with the times of Mohammad Tughlaq who ruled in the 14th century. When Mohammad Tughlaq shifted his capital from Delhi to Daulatabad many weavers came and settled here. During the migration, the weavers instead of returning to Delhi chose to stay back here. They did not want to go back to Delhi. During the reign of Malik Ambar many people were attracted to the city and came and settled here from far and wide. Aurangabad during Aurangzeb&#x27;s Governorship and the times of Mughal became the capital and the weavers had a gala time making money and becoming prosperous. The handicraft industry in Aurangabad attracted hundreds of craftsman and artisans. Members of the royal family and an elite few used the famous Aurangabad himroo. Himroo weaving is very characteristic and different. Fabrics and shawls from Aurangabad are much in demand for their unique style and design.

<text>Naram-Sin, also transcribed Narām-Sîn or Naram-Suen (: &quot;DNa-ra-am DSîn&quot;, meaning &quot;Beloved of the Moon God Sîn&quot;, the &quot;𒀭&quot; a determinative marking the name of a god; died 2218 BC), was a ruler of the Akkadian Empire, who reigned –2218 BC (middle chronology), and was the third successor and grandson of King Sargon of Akkad. Under Naram-Sin the empire reached its maximum extent. He was the first Mesopotamian king known to have claimed divinity for himself, taking the title &quot;God of Akkad&quot;, and the first to claim the title &quot;King of the Four Quarters&quot;. His military strength was strong as he crushed revolts and expanded the empire to places like Turkey and Iran. He became the patron city god of Akkade as Enlil was in Nippur. His enduring fame resulted in later rulers, Naram-Sin of Eshnunna and Naram-Sin of Assyria as well as Naram-Sin of Uruk, assuming the name.

== Biography ==

Naram-Sin was a son of Manishtushu. He was thus a nephew of King Rimush and grandson of Sargon and Tashlultum. Naram-Sin&#x27;s aunt was the High Priestess En-hedu-ana. Most recensions of the Sumerian King List show him following Manishitshu but The Ur III version of the king list inverts the order of Rimush and Manishtushu. To be fully correct, rather than Naram-Sin or Naram-Suen &quot;in Old Akkadian, the name in question should rather be reconstructed as Naram-Suyin (more precisely, /narām-tsuyin/) or Naram-Suʾin (/narām-tsuʾin/)&quot;.
Naram-Sin defeated Manium of Magan, and various northern hill tribes in the Zagros, Taurus, and Amanus Mountains, expanding his empire up to the Mediterranean Sea. His &quot;Victory Stele&quot; depicts his triumph over Satuni, chief of Lullubi in the Zagros Mountains. The Sumerian King List gives the length of his reign as 56 years, and at least 20 of his year-names are known, referring to military actions against various places such as Uruk and Subartu. One unknown year was recorded as &quot;the Year when Naram-Sin was victorious against Simurrum in Kirasheniwe and took prisoner Baba the governor of Simurrum, and Dubul the &quot;ensi&quot; of Arame&quot;. Other year names refer to his construction work on temples in Akkad, Nippur, and Zabala. He also built administrative centers at Nagar and Nineveh. In general it is not possible to assign an order to Naram-Sin&#x27;s year name with the exception of his first &quot;The year Naram-Sin received a weapon of heaven/An fr[om] the temple of the god Enlil&quot;. It is, however, possible to divide them into those before his deification and after that event (assumed to be shortly after the &quot;Great Revolt&quot;) based on the presence of a godhood determinant in his name.

During his reign Naram-Sin increased direct royal control of its city-states. He maintained control over the various city-states by the simple expedient of appointing some of his many sons as key provincial governors, and his daughters as high priestesses. He also reformed the scribal system.

A few loyal local governors remained in place. This included Meskigal, as governor of the city-state of Adab and Karsum governor of the unlocated Niqqum. Another was Lugal-ushumgal of Lagash. Several inscriptions of Lugal-ushumgal, who went on to serve the successor of Naram-Sin, Shar-Kali-Sharri, are known, particularly seal impressions, which refer to him as governor of Lagash and at the time a vassal (, &quot;arad&quot;, &quot;servant&quot; or &quot;slave&quot;) of Naram-Sin.
===The Great Revolt===

The pivotal event of Naram-Sin&#x27;s reign was a widespread revolt against the Akkadian Empire. The empire created by his grandfather, Sargon, first ruler of the Akkadian Empire stretched in the west to Syria in places like Tell Brak and Tell Leilan, to the east in Elam and associated polities in that region, to southern Anatolia in the north, and to the &quot;lower sea&quot; in the south encompassing all the traditional Sumerian powers like Uruk, Ur, and Lagash. All of these political entities had long histories as independent powers and would periodically re-assert their interests throughout the lifetime of the Akkadian Empire.
At some point in his reign a widespread uprising occurred, a large coalition of city-states led by Iphur-Kis of Kish (Sumer) and Amar-Girid of Uruk, joined by Enlil-nizu of Nippur, and including the city-states of &quot;Kutha, TiWA, Sippar, Kazallu, Kiritab, [Api]ak and GN&quot; as well as &quot;Amorite [hi]ghlanders&quot;. The rebellion was joined by the city of Borsippa, among others. We know of these events from a number of Old Babylonian copies of earlier inscriptions as well as one contemporary record from the Old Akkadian period. The Bassetki Statue, discovered in 1974, was the base of a life-sized copper statue of Naram-Sin. It reads:
In the aftermath, Naram-Sin deified himself as well as posthumously deifying Sargon and Manishtushu but not his uncle Rimush. The echoes of the revolt were reflected in later Sumerian literary compositions such as the Great Revolt against Naram-Sin, &quot;Naram-Sin and the Enemy Hordes&quot; and &quot;Gula-AN and the Seventeen Kings against Naram-Sin&quot;. 

===Control of Elam===
Elam came under the domination of Akkad in the time of Sargon though it remained restive. The 2nd ruler of Akkad, Rimush, campaigned there afterward adding &quot;conqueror of Elam and Parahsum&quot; to his royal titulary. The 3rd ruler, Manishtushu, conquered the city of Anshan in Elam and also the city of Pashime, installing imperial governors in those places.

Naram-Sin added &quot;commander of all the land of Elam, as far as Parahsum,&quot; to his royal titulary. During his rule, &quot;military governors of the country of Elam&quot; (shakkanakkus) with typically Akkadian names are known, such as Ili-ishmani or Epirmupi. This suggests that these governors of Elam were officials of the Akkadian Empire. Naram-Sin exercised great influence over Susa during his reign, building temples and establishing inscriptions in his name, and having the Akkadian language replace Elamite in official documents.

An unknown Elamite king (sometimes speculated to be Khita) is recorded as having signed a peace treaty, in Old Elamite language written in an Old Akkadian ductus, with Naram-Sin (not deified in the text), stating: &quot;The enemy of Naram-Sin is my enemy, the friend of Naram-Sin is my friend&quot;. Old Elamite is poorly understood (all other texts being very short) as yet making interpretation of the text challenging. The text mentions about twenty gods, mostly Elamite but with a few Sumerian and Akkadian, including Inshushinak, Humban, Nahiti, Simut, and Pinikir. It has been suggested that the formal treaty allowed Naram-Sin to have peace on his eastern borders, so that he could deal more effectively with the threat from Gutium.

===Conquest of Armanum and Ebla===

The conquest of Armanum (location unknown but proposed as Tall Bazi) with its ruler Rid-Adad and Ebla (55 kilometers southwest of modern Aleppo) by Naram-Sin (Ebla was also defeated by his grandfather Sargon) is known from one of his year names &quot;The year the king went on a campaign in Amarnum&quot; and from an Old Babylonian copy of a statue inscription (IM 85461) found at Ur. There are also three objects, a marble lamp, a stone plaque, and a copper bowl, inscribed &quot;Naram-Sin, the mighty, king of the four quarters, conqueror of Armanum and Ebla.&quot;. In 2010 a new stele fragment (IM 221139) describing the campaign was found at Tulul al-Baqarat (thought to be the ancient city of Kesh.

=== Children ===

Among the known sons of Naram-Sin were his successor Shar-Kali-Sharri, Nabi-Ulmaš, who was governor of Tutub, and a Ukin-Ulmash. Excavations at Tell Mozan (ancient Urkesh) brought to light a sealing of Tar&#x27;am-Agade, a previously unknown daughter of Naram-Sin, who was possibly married to an unidentified &quot;endan&quot; (ruler) of Urkesh. A recently found cylinder seal, looted from Urasagrig, shows that the governor there, Sharatigubishin, was also a son. Other known children include Enmenana the &quot;zirru priestess of the god Nanna, spouse of the god N[anna], entu priestess of the god Sin at Ur&quot;, Šumšani ēntum-priestess of Shamash at Sippar, a son who was governor at Marad, an unnamed daughter who was ēntum-priestesses at Nippur, Bin-kali-šarrē, Lipit-ilē (governor at Marad), Rigmuš-ālsu, Me-Ulmaš, and Ukēn-Ulmaš and a granddaughter Lipus-ia-um. One daughter, Tuṭṭanabšum (Tudanapšum), held the position of high priestess of Enlil at Nippur, the most important religious position in the empire. She was also deified, the only female and only non-king to be made a god.

==Victory stele of Naram-Sin==
Naram-Sin&#x27;s Victory Stele depicts him as a god-king (symbolized by his horned helmet) climbing a mountain above his soldiers, and his enemies, the defeated Lullubi led by their king Satuni. The stele was broken off at the top apparently when it was carried away from Sippar and carried off by the Elamite forces of Shutruk-Nakhunte in the 12th century BC along with a number of other monuments. The stele seems to break from tradition by using successive diagonal tiers to communicate the story to viewers, however the more traditional horizontal frames are visible on smaller broken pieces. It has been suggested that it contains the first depictions of battle standards and plate armor. The stele is 200 centimeters tall and 105 centimeters wide and is made from pinkish limestone. For contrast see the Victory Stele of Rimush over Lagash or the Victory stele of Sargon. The stele was found by Jacques de Morgan at Susa, and is now in the Louvre Museum (Sb 4).

The inscription over the head of the king is in the Akkadian language and very fragmentary, but reads:
Shutruk-Nahhunte added his own inscription to the stele, in Middle Elamite:

A similar stele fragment (ES 1027), 57 centimeters high by 42 centimeters wide by 20 deep, depicting Naram-Sin was found a few miles north-east of Diarbekr, at Pir Hüseyin in a well, though this was not its original context. It is said to have been first found Miyafarkin, a village about 75 kilometers northeast of Diarbekr.

Fragments of an alabaster stele representing captives being led by Akkadian soldiers is sometimes attributed to Narim-Sin (or Rimush or Manishtushu) on stylistic grounds. In particular, it is considered as more sophisticated graphically than the steles of Sargon of Akkad or those of Rimush or Manishitshu. Two fragments (IM 55639 and IM 59205) are in the National Museum of Iraq, and one (MFA 66.89) is the Boston Museum. The stele is quite fragmentary, but attempts at reconstitution have been made. Depending on sources, the fragments were excavated in Wasit, al-Hay district, Wasit Governorate, or in Nasiriyah, both locations in Iraq.

It is thought that the stele represents the result of the campaigns of Naram-Sin to Cilicia or Anatolia. This is suggested by the characteristics of the booty carried by the soldiers in the stele, especially the metal vessel carried by the main soldier, the design of which is unknown in Mesopotamia, but on the contrary well known in contemporary Anatolia.

==The Curse of Akkad==

One Mesopotamian myth, a historiographic poem entitled &quot;The curse of Akkad: the Ekur avenged&quot;, explains how the empire created by Sargon of Akkad fell and the city of Akkad was destroyed. The myth was written hundreds of years after Naram-Sin&#x27;s life and is the poet&#x27;s attempt to explain how the Gutians succeeded in conquering Sumer. After an opening passage describing the glory of Akkad before its destruction, the poem tells of how Naram-Sin angered the chief god Enlil by plundering the Ekur (Enlil&#x27;s temple in Nippur.) In his rage, Enlil summoned the Gutians down from the hills east of the Tigris, bringing plague, famine and death throughout Mesopotamia. Food prices became vastly inflated, with the poem stating that 1 lamb would buy only half a &quot;sila&quot; (about ) of grain, half a &quot;sila&quot; of oil, or half a &quot;mina&quot; (about ) of wool. To prevent this destruction, eight of the gods (namely Inanna, Enki, Sin, Ninurta, Utu, Ishkur, Nusku, and Nidaba) decreed that the city of Akkad should be destroyed in order to spare the rest of Sumer and cursed it. The story ends with the poet writing of Akkad&#x27;s fate, mirroring the words of the gods&#x27; curse earlier on:

&quot;Its chariot roads grew nothing but the &#x27;wailing plant,&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Moreover, on its canalboat towpaths and landings,&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;No human being walks because of the wild goats, vermin, snakes, and mountain scorpions&quot;,&lt;br&gt;
&quot;The plains where grew the heart-soothing plants, grew nothing but the &#x27;reed of tears,&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Akkad, instead of its sweet-flowing water, there flowed bitter water,&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Who said &quot;I would dwell in that&quot; found not a good dwelling place,&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Who said &quot;I would lie down in Akkad&quot; found not a good sleeping place.&quot;

==Excavations by Nabonidus circa 550 BC==

A foundation deposit of Naram-Sin was discovered and analysed by king Nabonidus, circa 550 BC. who Robert Silverberg thus characterises as the first archaeologist. Not only did he lead the first excavations which were to find the foundation deposits of the temples of Šamaš the sun god, the warrior goddess Anunitu (both located in Sippar), and the sanctuary that Naram-Sin built to the moon god, located in Harran, but he also had them restored to their former glory. He was also the first to date an archaeological artefact in his attempt to date Naram-Sin&#x27;s temple during his search for it. His estimate was inaccurate by about 1,500 years.

== In popular culture ==
King Naram-Sin is a character in the 2021 video game &quot;House of Ashes&quot;, with the main plot occurring in his personal temple. In the game, he is the self-proclaimed &quot;God King&quot; of Akkad, and is engaged in a war with the Gutians after being cursed by the god Enlil; whom he angered after the sacking his temple. Naram-Sin was voiced and motion captured by Sami Karim.

In the 2021 mobile gacha game Blue Archive, Volume F, the innermost chamber of the large floating quantum supercomputer known as the &quot;Ark of Atra-Hasis&quot; (itself a reference to the Akkadian myth) is named &quot;Throne of Naram-Sin&quot;.

<doc id="1154507" wikidata="Q4759811" url="?curid=1154507" title="André Alexis">
<text>André Alexis is a Canadian writer who was born in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, grew up in Ottawa, and now lives in Toronto, Ontario. He has received numerous awards including the Windham-Campbell Literature Prize, the Giller Prize, the Rogers Writers&#x27; Trust Fiction Prize, and the Trillium Award.

Alexis is best known for his Quincunx Cycle, a series of five novels set in and around Southern Ontario. His second book in that cycle, &quot;Fifteen Dogs&quot;, won the 2015 Giller Prize and brought both Alexis and his work to greater prominence. He has been compared to contemporary American novelist Percival Everett, with one scholar describing Alexis provisionally as &quot;the Canadian Percival Everett.&quot;

==Career==

Alexis began his artistic career in the theatre, and has held the position of playwright-in-residence at the Canadian Stage Company. His short play &quot;Lambton, Kent, and Other Vistas&quot;, first produced and performed in 1995, was published as &quot;Lambton, Kent&quot; in 1999.

His short story collection &quot;Despair and Other Stories of Ottawa&quot; (1994), was short-listed for the Commonwealth Prize (Canada and Caribbean region).

Alexis&#x27; debut novel, &quot;Childhood&quot; was published in 1998. It won the Books in Canada First Novel Award, and was a co-winner of the Trillium Award, which Alexis shared that year with Alice Munro. The book was also shortlisted for the 1998 Giller Prize.

In 2005, Alexis published &quot;Ingrid and the Wolf&quot;, his first work of juvenile fiction. The book was nominated for the Governor General&#x27;s Award for English-language Children&#x27;s Literature in the 2006 Governor General&#x27;s Awards.

His novel &quot;Asylum&quot; was published in 2008, and is set in Ottawa during the government of Brian Mulroney.

In 2010, Alexis published &quot;Beauty and Sadness&quot;, a prose work that one baffled (but still positive) reviewer described as a &quot;collection of non-fiction&quot; featuring &quot;fictional explorations of writers Alexis admires&quot; transposed into small-town Ontario, and concluded that the book as a whole simply &quot;defies categorization.&quot; In his introduction, Alexis says that &quot;Beauty and Sadness&quot; &quot;is a work of geography as much as it is one of &#x27;criticism&#x27;&quot;— provided that &quot;you accept that there are countries named Cocteau, Kawabata, Maupassant, and so on.&quot; (&quot;Beauty and Sadness&quot; xvii) He also warns that the &quot;André Alexis&quot; in this book &quot;is not quite me.&quot; (ibid. xviii)

The following year, Alexis returned to the theatre, with a new play for Toronto&#x27;s Tarragon Theatre: &quot;Name in Vain (Decalogue Two)&quot;, to be directed by Richard Rose (then Artistic Director of Tarragon). The play had its premiere on 4 October 2011, and was described as the first in a planned series of ten works by Alexis, each treating one of the Ten Commandments from Exodus Chapter 20 with a different theatrical or conceptual approach. (Cf. &quot;Dekalog&quot;.) The title refers to what is given as the Second Commandment by St. Augustine and generally in Catholicism (but third in the Talmud, in the Septuagint, and according to Philo): &quot;Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.&quot; (KJV) Alexis&#x27; &quot;nearly wordless&quot; play is set in a monastery with a rule of monastic silence; one monk, in a moment of rage, breaks not only his vow of silence but that commandment as well, throwing the community of brethren into upheaval.

In 2013, Alexis published a novella titled &quot;A&quot;, about a fictional Toronto literary critic named Alexander Baddeley who is obsessed with the work of an elusive poet named Avery Andrews.

Alexis has also written several texts for Canadian composer James Rolfe. Their first collaboration was Rolfe&#x27;s &quot;Fire&quot; (1999), a theatrical piece for four voices (two sopranos and two altos) commissioned by the Queen of Puddings Music Theatre Company. Alexis went on to write the libretti for Rolfe&#x27;s &quot;Orpheus and Eurydice&quot; (2004) and his chamber opera &quot;Aeneas and Dido&quot;, which premiered at Toronto Masque Theatre in 2007.

In 2014 Rolfe and Alexis collaborated again, in a commission for the Canadian Art Song Project. Alexis wrote &quot;a new cycle of six poems that trace the journey of the sleeper from darkness to light&quot; from which Rolfe composed a song cycle, &quot;Moths&quot;, premiered by Canadian baritone Brett Polegato and pianist Steven Philcox.

===The Quincunx Cycle (2014-)===
Also in 2014 Alexis published &quot;Pastoral&quot;, the first in a planned series of five books on philosophical themes called the Quincunx Cycle. Alexis has said that he had planned the cycle and completed &quot;Pastoral&quot; as early as 2009, but was unable to find a publisher until he came to Coach House Books in Toronto.

Alexis has described his plan for the cycle as having been inspired by Thomas Browne&#x27;s &quot;The Garden of Cyrus, or The Quincuncial Lozenge, or Network Plantations of the Ancients, naturally, artificially, mystically considered&quot; (1658). Browne&#x27;s frontispiece features an epigraph from Quintillian&#x27;s Institutio Oratoria (VIII.3.ix) on the planting of fruit trees:

&quot;Fifteen Dogs&quot;, the second book in Alexis&#x27; Quincunx, was published in 2015. It won Alexis the 2015 Scotiabank Giller Prize and the Rogers Writers&#x27; Trust Fiction Prize, was shortlisted for a Toronto Book Award, and went on to win the Canada Reads competition in 2017.

The third book in the cycle, &quot;The Hidden Keys&quot;, was published in 2016, notably labelled &quot;Quincunx 4.&quot;

In 2017, Alexis won the prestigious Windham-Campbell Prize, awarded by the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale University, for his body of work to date. The Windham-Campbell judges praised his “astonishingly clear, supple prose that propels readers through the complex philosophical questions... that have preoccupied him through two decades of work.” Alexis also sat as a juror for that year&#x27;s Scotiabank Giller Prize.

The next book in his cycle, &quot;Days by Moonlight&quot; (Quincunx 5) was published in 2019, winning Alexis his second Rogers Writers&#x27; Trust Fiction Prize. The book was also longlisted for the 2019 Giller Prize. While promoting the book, Alexis suggested that after the final part of the cycle had been published, he would revise the entire cycle.

While completing the cycle, Alexis also wrote &quot;Metamorphosis: a Viral Trilogy&quot;, a three-part audio drama inspired by the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, which was released in conjunction with TO Live, SummerWorks and Canadian Stage. In October 2020, his career-spanning collection of short stories, &quot;The Night Piece&quot;, was published by Penguin Random House Canada.

Alexis published the fifth and final instalment &quot;Ring&quot; (Quincunx 3) in 2021.

In 2022, Alexis published his first post-Quincunx work, &quot;Winter, or A Town Near Palgrave&quot;, about the mysterious hibernation practices of a group of secretive people in a small town called &quot;N___ &quot; near Palgrave, Ontario. However, in an interview later that same year, Alexis confirmed that the Quincunx cycle was as yet unfinished, and that he would rewrite and re-release it as a single volume:

Alexis continues to live and work in Toronto, where he has hosted programming for CBC Radio, reviews books for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, and is a contributing editor for &quot;This Magazine&quot;. He is an adjunct professor in the MA in English and Creative Writing program at the University of Toronto, and was formerly Writer in Residence at the University of Ottawa, and a Barker Fairley Distinguished Visitor in Canadian Studies at University College in the University of Toronto.

<text>A Dhakai (Daccai), often considered as a type of sari (traditional cloth for women of Bengal) is a traditional attire of women in Bengal made with cotton. The name comes from the Dhaka (Dacca)city, capital of Bangladesh, where this type of fabric is usually made.
==History==
The unique hand technique of weaving was called jamdani in the old days, while the weave was called Dhakai. The sensitive weavers and artisans of this art form took inspirations for their weave designs from the life around them, from simple things such as a broken comb to things in the nature such as flora and fauna and traditional Bengali designs known as Alpana.

<text>Wendi Louise Peters (born 29 February 1968) is an English actress. Peters began her acting career in theatre, with appearances in various productions including &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot; (1991), &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; (1991), &quot;Into the Woods&quot; (1992), &quot;Bedroom Farce&quot; (1996) and &quot;Noises Off&quot; (1997). Then from 2003 to 2007 and again in 2014, she portrayed Cilla Battersby-Brown in the ITV soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot;.

After leaving &quot;Coronation Street&quot; to pursue other opportunities, she competed in and reached the final of &quot;Celebrity MasterChef&quot;, before returning to the stage to appear in various touring productions and West End theatre roles. She reprised her role of Cilla in 2014 for a brief stint, before appearing in the CBBC series &quot;Hetty Feather&quot; from 2015 to 2017. Then from 2023 to 2024, Peters appeared as Nina Bulsara in the BBC daytime soap opera &quot;Doctors&quot;.

==Life and career==
===1987–2010: Career beginnings and &quot;Coronation Street&quot;===
As a child, Peters attended dance school and performed in various school plays. She has cited seeing &quot;Annie&quot; on the West End in 1980 as the catalyst for her wanting to pursue acting for her career. Her professional acting career began in 1987 when she performed at the Crucible Theatre, Sheffield. In 1992, she portrayed Red Riding Hood in a stage production of &quot;Into the Woods&quot;, a role Peters described as one of her favourites in a 2021 interview. After various stage roles including &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot; (1991), &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; (1991), &quot;Bedroom Farce&quot; (1996) and &quot;Noises Off&quot; (1997), Peters made her television debut four years later in the BBC medical drama series &quot;Cardiac Arrest&quot;. She then appeared in minor roles in &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; and &quot;Bad Girls&quot;.

In 2003, Peters was cast in the role of Cilla Battersby-Brown in the ITV soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. In January 2006, she competed on ITV&#x27;s &quot;Soapstar Superstar&quot;, raising £35,000 for her chosen charities. In January 2007, it was announced that Peters would be leaving the soap after four years. She made the decision as a result of wanting to spend more time with family alongside pursuing other projects. She reprised the role in 2008 as part of a straight-to-DVD special, &quot;Out of Africa&quot;. Also in 2008, Peters appeared on &quot;Adrenaline Junkie&quot; with Jack Osborne, where she jumped out of a helicopter at 9,000 feet over Table Mountain.

In 2009, Peters was a finalist on &quot;Celebrity Masterchef&quot;. Later that year, she toured Ireland with the one-woman play &quot;Mrs Whippy&quot;, written by Cecelia Ahern. Peters then toured the UK with Jenny Eclair and Susie Blake in &quot;Grumpy Old Women Live 2 – Chin Up Britain&quot; . The production returned for a season at the Novello Theatre in London&#x27;s West End in 2010.

===2010–present: Return to the stage and &quot;Doctors&quot;===
In 2010, Peters played the lead in Northern Broadsides&#x27; production of &quot;The Game&quot; by Harold Brighouse. The play had not been performed in 100 years and her performance garnered critical acclaim. Dominic Cavendish of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; said, &quot;Ma was played with hilarious gruffness and rolling pin obduracy by Wendi Peters. Her performance alone is worth the price of admission&quot;. Peters was described as &quot;simply magnificent&quot; by Michael Billington of &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

In 2011, Peters appeared at Hull Truck Theatre Company to play Bet in John Godber&#x27;s two-hander, &quot;April in Paris&quot;. Peters again received acclaim from the press in the revival. A year later, she played Princess Puffer in Aria Entertainment&#x27;s London revival of &quot;The Mystery of Edwin Drood&quot;, a musical comedy by Rupert Holmes, based on Charles Dickens&#x27; unfinished novel. The production ran at the Landor Theatre and transferred to the Arts Theatre for a limited run. In 2012, she appeared in an episode of &quot;Crime Stories&quot; as Marion Jackson. Then from November 2012 to January 2013, Peters starred in &quot;White Christmas&quot; at the Lowry at Salford Quays. In 2013, Jonathan Miller directed Githa Sowerby&#x27;s &quot;Rutherford and Son&quot; in which Peters starred as Mrs Henderson to critical acclaim. Libby Purves of &quot;The Times&quot; said, &quot;Wendi Peters has a fabulous cameo as a whining petitioner, unsentimentally illustrating the company&#x27;s workforce challenges&quot;. Other press went on to add she was &quot;unforgettable&quot; and wrote that her scene was &quot;formidable&quot;. She reprised the role at the Dominion Theatre in late 2014. Also in 2014, Peters reprised her role of Cilla in &quot;Coronation Street&quot; for a six-week stint.

Peters co-starred with Ian Reddington and Christopher Villiers in the 2015 production of Joan Littlewood&#x27;s musical &quot;Oh, What a Lovely War!&quot;, directed by Terry Johnston, which toured nationally. Also that year, she played the lead role in the new play &quot;Hatched &#x27;n&#x27; Dispatched&quot; at The Park Theatre, London. 2015 also marked her first appearance on the CBBC series &quot;Hetty Feather&quot;, a role she appeared in until 2017. In 2018, Peters took on the role of Cissy Robson in the UK tour of &quot;Quartet&quot;. Peters then starred in a UK tour of &quot;Salad Days&quot; in 2018, followed by a stint as Sylvie in the off-West End run of &quot;Call Me Vicky&quot;. She also appeared in &quot;Big The Musical&quot; for nine weeks.

In March 2021, she appeared in an episode of the BBC soap opera &quot;Doctors&quot; as Nicky Connelly. In 2022, Peters was the voiceover for the Channel 5 series &quot;Happy Campers: The Caravan Park&quot;. A year after her one-episode stint, it was announced that she would be joining the main cast of &quot;Doctors&quot; as Dr. Nina Bulsara. Peters began filming on the soap in October 2022 and began appearing onscreen from February 2023. She announced her exit from the series after 11 months in September 2023.

Peters returned to the stage starring as the Wicked Queen Carabosse in the Stockport Plaza&#x27;s annual pantomime, Sleeping Beauty, for the winter 2024-25 season.

<text>Suzanne Nicole Virdee (born 16 October 1969 in Solihull, Warwickshire, now the West Midlands) is a British journalist and television presenter, working on a freelance basis with UK news organisation ITN.

==Early life==
Virdee was born on 16 October 1969 in Solihull, Warwickshire, now the West Midlands, to an Indian father and an English mother and grew up in Edgbaston. She was educated at Edgbaston&#x27;s Park Grove School and studied at Mander Portman Woodward College.

==Career==
Virdee became a journalist at the age of 18, working as a trainee reporter at the &quot;Solihull Times&quot; in her home town. She passed her journalism exams and switched to television journalism, working for &quot;Central News&quot; in Birmingham. Virdee went on to work for the &quot;Sunday Mercury&quot; and the &quot;Birmingham Mail&quot; (then the &quot;Birmingham Evening Mail&quot;) before a 16-month stint with BBC WM.

She returned to &quot;Central News&quot; as a reporter, presenter and producer before joining the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Midlands Today&quot; programme in April 2001, presenting late night bulletins before becoming a main presenter a year later, alongside Nick Owen. Virdee has also worked as a relief presenter for &quot;BBC Breakfast&quot;.

On 29 March 2012, Virdee left &quot;Midlands Today&quot; after announcing she was unable to sign a five-month contract to continue presenting the programme. The BBC took Virdee off air two days earlier than planned after she released a press statement about her departure.

In August 2016, she joined ITN as a news correspondent for the &quot;ITV Lunchtime News&quot; and early newsreader for &quot;ITV News London&quot;. On 25 May 2017 she made her debut fronting short updates for &quot;5 News&quot; and covered bulletins for ITV news.

==Personal life==
Virdee is married to photographer Andrew Fox. She lives in Redditch, Worcestershire.

<text>Ana Kirby (; born August 14, 1974), known by her stage name Ana Matronic, is an American singer, best known as the co-lead singer for the pop rock band Scissor Sisters.

== Career ==
Matronic joined Scissor Sisters, founded by Jake Shears and Babydaddy, after they played their first live gig at club Knockoff on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.

She has stated that, in her eyes, the objective of the band is &quot;about people displaying their fantasies on the outside, trying to break out of the everyday, and look like their dreams.&quot; In The Scissorhood, the fan community for Scissor Sisters, those fans who hold a special affinity for Ana are known as &quot;nuns&quot;. Fans who are attracted to Ana, even if they might not usually be attracted to women, term themselves &quot;Anasexual&quot;.
In 2005, she was featured on the New Order single &quot;Jetstream&quot;, taken from the band&#x27;s album &quot;Waiting for the Sirens&#x27; Call&quot;. In 2009, Matronic performed on the glass harmonica at the New Museum in NYC in &quot;Auroville&quot;, a multimedia ritual tribute to an experimental community dedicated to the guru Sri Aurobindo. Ana appears as a guest vocalist on the Mark Ronson-produced track &quot;Safe (In the Heat of the Moment)&quot; from the December 21, 2010, release &quot;All You Need Is Now&quot; from the band Duran Duran.

In 2012, Matronic appeared as an advisor on &quot;The Voice UK&quot;, pairing up to assist Jessie J. The following year, she served as commentator of the BBC Three broadcast of the Eurovision Song Contest 2013 semi-finals in Malmö, Sweden, for the United Kingdom, replacing Sara Cox. Matronic returned in 2014 as radio commentator on Radio 2 Eurovision, a pop-up DAB station, for the second semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2014 in Copenhagen, Denmark.

Matronic appeared on &quot;Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two&quot; on November 15, 2013, alongside Jason Donovan and Jodie Prenger.

She presented a weekly show on BBC Radio 2 from 00:00 to 02:00 on Sunday overnights. The show was titled &quot;Disco Devotion&quot; from April 2017, before changing its name to &quot;Dance Devotion&quot;. In 2022, she announced she will be leaving the station due to changes of the weekend schedule; the final edition of &quot;Dance Devotion&quot; aired on June 19. The final show contained &#x27;anything with a repetitive beat&#x27;, songs of which include Deep Inside by Hardrive, You Got The Love by Candi Staton, and Professional Widow by Tori Amos and Armand van Helden. From July 24–27, 2017, she covered for Jo Whiley and presented a special programme alongside Scott Mills on July 29 celebrating the 50th anniversary of the decriminalisation of male homosexual activity in the UK. She performed a live DJ set at Radio 2 Live in Hyde Park on September 10, 2018, and has hosted a New Year&#x27;s Eve 2018 show for the channel. Matronic covers when BBC Radio 2 regular presenters are on holiday.

Her punning stage name is said to be due to &quot;a deep and abiding love of robots&quot;.

In January 2019 she appeared on the BBC TV show &quot;Mastermind&quot; with &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot; as her specialist subject and Beyond Reflections (then known as Chrysalis) as her chosen charity.

The Scissor Sisters announced a reunion in October 2024, but Matronic chose not to take part. Shears told &quot;The Independent&quot;: &quot;I think it just didn&#x27;t line up. It&#x27;s not something that she wanted to do at this moment in time. And I didn&#x27;t want that to keep us from coming out and playing these songs.&quot;

Addressing her absence from the reunion tour, Matronic wrote on Instagram:

People familiar with my story and career arc will know that in the heart of this Showgirl lies a giant Nerd. In the past decade my Nerd self has taken the wheel and is now driving my career. I am currently finishing production on the first season of my history podcast &quot;Good Time Sallies&quot;, which has grown into several long-term research and writing projects. With contracts signed and schedules agreed on these commitments, the timing of a Scissor reunion does not allow me to join my former bandmates for this tour. I wish the band and our fans all the best… I will be there in spirit to kiki with you!

== Book ==
In 2015, she penned a book entitled &quot;Robot Universe: Legendary Automatons and Androids from the Ancient World to the Distant Future&quot;; published by Sterling New York.

== Personal life ==
Matronic described herself as having a &quot;Cornish, Welsh and Irish heritage&quot;. During a performance in Cardiff, Wales, Matronic &quot;Came out&quot; as Welsh stating that &quot;Some people in England have told me I don&#x27;t want to be telling people about it&quot; adding &quot;It&#x27;s true. Generations back the Matronics originally came from Wales. There were just a few more &#x27;w&#x27;s and &#x27;g&#x27;s and &#x27;l&#x27;s in the name in the past.&quot; Matronic has a tattoo on her ankle of a Celtic knot to signify her roots, as well as a large tattoo on her right shoulder of bionic circuitry.

Matronic married her long-time boyfriend and fiancé Seth Kirby in April 2010 at New York City Hall after they had been together for seven years. She has had relationships with women, but stated in a 2013 interview with &quot;Diva&quot; she &quot;[doesn&#x27;t] like identifying as gay or straight or even bisexual&quot; but rather as &quot;a human being&quot;, saying &quot;I believe in human rights. We should treat each other exactly the same whoever we are. The rigid constructs put into place to define us don&#x27;t really work.&quot;

<doc id="1154591" wikidata="Q336479" url="?curid=1154591" title="Arthur Ponsonby, 1st Baron Ponsonby of Shulbrede">
<text>Arthur Augustus William Harry Ponsonby, 1st Baron Ponsonby of Shulbrede (16 February 1871 – 23 March 1946), was a British politician, writer, and social activist. He was the son of Sir Henry Ponsonby, Private Secretary to Queen Victoria, and Mary Elizabeth Bulteel, daughter of John Crocker Bulteel. He was also the great-grandson of The 3rd Earl of Bessborough, The 3rd Earl of Bathurst and The 2nd Earl Grey. The 1st Baron Sysonby was his elder brother.

Ponsonby is often quoted as the author of the dictum &quot;When war is declared, truth is the first casualty&quot;, published in his book &quot;Falsehood in War-time, Containing an Assortment of Lies Circulated Throughout the Nations During the Great War&quot; (1928). However, he uses this phrase in quotation marks as an epigram at the start of the book and does not present it as his own words. Its likely origin is the almost identical line spoken in 1917 by the United States Senator Hiram Johnson: &quot;The first casualty when war comes is truth&quot;.

==Education and early career==
Ponsonby was a Page of Honour to Queen Victoria from 1882 to 1887. From an Anglo-Irish family, he was educated at Eton College. While at Eton, Ponsonby was whipped for organising a steeplechase in his dormitory.

Ponsonby studied at Balliol College, Oxford, before joining the Diplomatic Service and taking assignments in Constantinople and Copenhagen.

==Politics==
At the 1906 general election, Ponsonby stood unsuccessfully as Liberal candidate for Taunton. He was elected as Member of Parliament for Stirling Burghs at a by-election of 1908, succeeding former Prime Minister Henry Campbell-Bannerman, who had died a few weeks earlier.

In Parliament, Ponsonby opposed the British involvement in the First World War and, with George Cadbury, Ramsay MacDonald, E. D. Morel, Arnold Rowntree, and Charles Trevelyan, he was a member of the Union of Democratic Control, which became a prominent antiwar organisation in Britain.

Ponsonby was defeated at the 1918 general election in which he stood as an &quot;Independent Democrat&quot; in the new Dunfermline Burghs constituency. He then joined the Labour Party and returned to the House of Commons at the 1922 general election as member for the Brightside division of Sheffield.

In 1924, Ramsay MacDonald appointed Ponsonby as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and he later served as Under-Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and then as Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport in 1929. Ponsonby was a leader in the antiwar wing of the Labour Party, a champion of &quot;humanitarian pacifism&quot; which held that the First World War was a sort of conspiracy against the ordinary people of the world by capitalist elites who sough to enrich themselves via war. In his 1925 pamphlet &quot;Now is the Time&quot;, he deplored &quot;the millions who have fallen in the war&quot; and denounced the &quot;great conspiracy&quot; by the governments of Europe to plunge the world into war. Ponsonby declared that the defining issue of the day was to establish &quot;democratic&quot; control over diplomacy to end the &quot;great conspiracy&quot; to promote &quot;war mentality&quot; as the prelude to another world war. Like many other British socialists, Ponsonby had a strong dislike of the Foreign Office, which was dominated by the scions of the British aristocracy, as a secretive and elitist group who he believed served only the interests of &quot;the Establishment&quot; instead of ordinary British people.

In 1928, he published the book &quot;Falsehood in Wartime&quot;, an elaboration of the thesis that he presented in &quot;Now is the Time&quot; that the First World War was far from being the crusade against evil that it was presented as in the United Kingdom at the time. Ponosonby argued that the war was instead merely a cynical exercise by the British government to lie to its own people to start and sustain a war intended only to enrich the arms industry. Ponsonby examined the causes of the war and the war aims of the belligerent powers, but his main focus was in rebutting allegations of German atrocities during the war to prove his thesis of the &quot;great conspiracy&quot;. He was especially concerned to rebut the &quot;rape of Belgium&quot; story as he claimed that the reports in British newspapers during the war about widespread German atrocities during the invasion of Belgium in 1914 were all lies and the German Army had behaved in a honourable and noble fashion towards the Belgian people. His book had chapters dedicated to rebutting the stories about the &quot;mutilated nurse&quot;, the &quot;Belgian baby without hands&quot;, the story of the Canadian soldier crucified during the Second Battle of Ypres in April 1915, and the &quot;corpse factory&quot; story of 1917 that claimed the Germans were turning the bodies of slain Allied soldiers into soap. The book concluded that &quot;the international war is a monster born of hypocrisy fed on falsehood, fattened by humbug, kept alive by superstition, directed to the death and torture of millions&quot;.

The Irish historians Alan Kramer and John Horne wrote that the specific examples that Ponsonby cited were true, but that his book ventured into historical negationism with its sweeping claims that all of the stories about German atrocities against French and Belgian civilians were lies. Ponsonby was indeed correct in &quot;Falsehood in Wartime&quot; that the British newspapers during the war had run many false stories about German atrocities with for example the stories that the Germans routinely cut off the hands of Belgian children having no basis in reality. However, Ponsonby was cavalier and callous in dismissing all of the stories about the massacres of Belgian and French civilians by German forces out of hand as lies. Ponsonby&#x27;s methodology in &quot;Falsehood in Wartime&quot; was that if it he could be prove that some of the stories published in the British newspapers about German atrocities in the &quot;Rape of Belgium&quot; were false, then all of the stories about German atrocities must be false. During the war, German newspapers had frequently run stories that accused Belgian and French &quot;francs-tireurs&quot; of atrocities against German soldiers such as cutting off their hands. Ponsonby did not mention in &quot;Falsehood in Wartime&quot; that most of the stories in the German newspapers about atrocities by the &quot;franc-tireurs&quot; were false, thereby leaving the impression it was only the British government and newspapers that had engaged in dishonesty in reporting the news. Ponsonby like many other people in the United Kingdom during the interwar period believed that the Treaty of Versailles was too harsh towards Germany.

The theme in &quot;Falsehood in Wartime&quot; that all of the reports of German atrocities were fabrications suggested that Germany was not the aggressor nor had Germanhy committed war crimes, which in turn was intended to suggest the Treaty of Versailles was morally wrong. Like many other people at the time, Ponsonby represented the Treaty of Versailles as the result of a quasi-judicial process that resulted in a sort of collective criminal conviction for Germany, and the purpose of &quot;Falsehood in Wartime&quot; was to prove that Germany had been wrongly &quot;convicted&quot;. &quot;Falsehood in Wartime&quot; was a best-seller when it was published in 1928 because it fitted into the &quot;zeitgeist&quot; of the 1920s. During the First World War, to justify the sacrifices and suffering imposed by the war, politicians had painted a picture of the post-war world in very utopian terms as the only promise of a better tomorrow provided the necessary hope to sustain the war. When the promised post-war utopia failed to occur after the victory of 1918, there was a strong mood of disenchantment and hurt with the general feeling in the United Kingdom being the expected rewards for wartime suffering had failed to occur and that the promise of a &quot;land fit for heroes&quot; after the war was a cruel joke. In such a climate, a book such as &quot;Falsehood in Wartime&quot; that portrayed the entire war as the product of a cynical public relations campaign based on duplicity and dishonesty struck a chord. The British historian David Reynolds wrote that Ponsonby in &quot;Falsehood in Wartime&quot; professed to condemn both sides equally, but in fact almost all of his book was devoted to debunking allegations of German atrocities in the Allied and especially British newspapers while only a few pages were given over to debunking allegations of Allied atrocities in the German newspapers. Reynolds described &quot;Falsehood in Wartime&quot; as a &quot;polemical&quot; book which despite its claims of neutrality in fact mostly condemned the Allies while portraying Germany as a wronged nation, the victim of lies told by the British newspapers. Reynolds wrote that Ponsonby in &quot;Falsehood in Wartime&quot; was engaged in the same sort of propaganda that he had denounced in others as he sought to deny that Germany had committed war crimes during the invasion of Belgium and France. Reynolds wrote that many of the stories in the British newspapers at the time such as the claim that the Germans cut off the hands of Belgian children were not true, but that the claim the Germans had massacred thousands of innocent civilians in Belgium and France was not, and Ponsonby was completely wrong when he sought to deny that the &quot;rape of Belgium&quot; had occurred. 

In 1930, Ponsonby was raised to the peerage as a hereditary baron, taking the title Lord Ponsonby of Shulbrede from his home at Shulbrede Priory in Sussex. He served as leader of the Labour Party in the House of Lords from 1931 until 1935, resigning because he was opposed to the party&#x27;s support for sanctions against Italy for its invasion of Abyssinia.

In 1937–1938, Ponsonby ran a significant Peace Letter campaign against British preparations for a new war, and from 1936 he was an active member of the Peace Pledge Union, contributing regularly to &quot;Peace News&quot;.

Ponsonby opposed the initiative of Lord Charnwood and Cosmo Gordon Lang, Archbishop of Canterbury, to ask his Majesty&#x27;s Government to react against the genocidal Holodomor policies of the Soviet Government.

From 1935 to 1937, he was Chair of the International Council of the War Resisters&#x27; International. Ponsonby as the leader of the antiwar wing of the Labour Party was opposed to all wars in principle as evil, which led him to oppose British rearmament in the 1930s. During the Danzig crisis, he spoke out against the British &quot;guarantee&quot; of Poland as likely to cause another world war.

==Resignation==
In May 1940, Ponsonby resigned from the Labour Party, opposing its decision to join the new coalition government of Winston Churchill.

He wrote a biography of his father which won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize in 1942: &quot;Henry Ponsonby, Queen Victoria&#x27;s Private Secretary: His Life and Letters&quot;.

==Death==
Ponsonby died on 23 March 1946 and was succeeded by his son Matthew Henry Hubert Ponsonby.

==Personal life and family==
On 12 April 1898, he married Dorothea Parry, daughter of Hubert Parry and Elizabeth Maude Herbert (1851–1933), a daughter of Sidney Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Lea. They had a daughter, Elizabeth (1900–1940), who during the 1920s became well known as a leading figure of the Bright Young People, and a son, Matthew (1904–1976), who became the 2nd Baron.

<text>Shani Mootoo is a Trinidadian-Canadian writer, visual artist and video maker. She was born in Dublin, Ireland, in 1957 to Trinidadian parents. She grew up in Trinidad and relocated at the age of 19 to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. She currently lives in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
At an early age Mootoo showed a talent for drawing, painting, and writing, and expressed interest in becoming an artist at the age of 10. Her early efforts were encouraged by her mother Indra (&quot;née&quot; Samaroo). Her father, Ramesh Mootoo, was a medical family doctor and Trinidadian politician. Much of Shani Mootoo&#x27;s personal and literary life has been focused on political activism. According to Mootoo, her parents were upset by some of her earliest poems because they described love between two men or between two women. She has said that her parents worried for what those themes might mean for her future, which is why she put her words away and chose to paint instead. She claims that she came back to writing accidentally, and expressed a worry that she was not a writer but a painter first. Mootoo has discussed being sexually assaulted by one of her grandfather&#x27;s friends.

Mootoo earned a Fine Arts BFA Degree at the University of Western Ontario in 1980 and an MA in English and Theatre from the University of Guelph, 2010. As a multimedia visual artist in Vancouver and New York City, where she lived from 1994 to 1999, she explored in her paintings, photographs and videos themes of gender, sexuality, and race. The themes of her work resonated with her experiences as an adolescent in Trinidad and as an immigrant adult in Canada. Her visual art and video work have traveled and been acclaimed internationally. She is now teaching the Creative Writing Program at the University of Toronto.

===Visual and video art===
Mootoo&#x27;s visual art and video work have been exhibited internationally, including at the New York Museum of Modern Art. On the topic of her visual work, she has said that as a victim of child abuse she found it safer to use pictures rather than words. Mootoo uses her art as a way to deal with the trauma of her childhood and has discussed feelings of confusion as to why the universe would let child abuse happen, while also claiming that as a survivor, she and all those that have suffered at the hands of abusers must come to terms with the trauma and understand what to do with suffering. Her film and video work was revisited by Rungh in its program &quot;Longing and Belonging: 1990s South Asian Film and Video&quot;, a featured program at the 2019 DOXA Documentary Film Festival. Mootoo reflected on her film and video work in the 1990s in the commissioned article &quot;Streams Coming Together: 1990s video in Vancouver and beyond&quot;.

===Literary career===
Mootoo&#x27;s first literary publication, &quot;Out on Main Street&quot;, a collection of short stories, was solicited by the Vancouver-based feminist publishing house Press Gang in 1993, and was the beginning of her literary career.

Her first full-length novel, &quot;Cereus Blooms at Night&quot;, published by Press Gang in 1996, was shortlisted for the Scotia Bank Giller Prize in 1997, the Ethel Wilson Fiction Prize, and the Chapters Books in Canada First Novel Award. It has been published in 15 countries and won the New England Book Sellers Award in 1998. Set on a tropical island, the novel is narrated by a male nurse and caretaker, and explores trauma, madness and redemption, the legacies of sexual abuse, and the boundaries between heterosexual and homosexual desire.

In 2002, Mootoo followed her first novel with a collection of poetry, &quot;The Predicament of Or&quot;.

Her second full-length novel, &quot;He Drown She in the Sea&quot;, was published in 2005. It made the long list for the International Dublin Literary Award in 2007.

Her 2008 novel, &quot;Valmiki&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, is set in San Fernando, Trinidad, and depicts a father and daughter who struggle to come to terms with secrets. Mootoo has said that the story is about a father trying to help his daughter from leading the same kind of closeted life that he has led. Viveka and her father&#x27;s lives are each underpinned by the constraints of class and race, and most importantly by the sexual conventions of their society. Set against its strongly evoked backdrop of place, the novel charts Viveka&#x27;s coming to terms with the hard understanding that love faces society&#x27;s obstacles, and her knowledge of her certain survival. &quot;Valmiki&#x27;s Daughter&quot; was long-listed for 2009&#x27;s Scotiabank Giller Prize. In an interview, Mootoo explained her realization that she had written about food on almost every page of &quot;Valmiki&#x27;s Daughter&quot; without realizing it. She discusses the importance of food and entertaining people in Trinidadian culture, as well as in her life and her other work.

Mootoo&#x27;s two most recent novels, &quot;Moving Forward Sideways like a Crab&quot; (2014) and &quot;Polar Vortex&quot; (2020), were also shortlisted for the Giller Prize.

Mootoo&#x27;s novels are found on course lists in the Departments of English, Liberal Arts, Women&#x27;s Studies, and Cultural Studies at universities in the Caribbean, Canada, the United States, England, Europe, India, and Australia.

Mootoo&#x27;s literary papers are held at Simon Fraser University Special Collections and Rare Books. The collection contains &quot;printed typescripts of published works with drafts and related working papers, published reviews, drafts of unpublished works, lecture notes, professional correspondence, notebooks and sketchbooks, video productions in VHS format, audio materials and works of visual art&quot;.

In 2022 the Writers&#x27; Trust of Canada awarded Mootoo its Writers&#x27; Trust Engel/Findley Award for her body of work.

===Other projects===
Mootoo has served as writer in residence at the University of Alberta, the University of Guelph and the University of the West Indies, and as a visiting scholar at Mills College in California, US. She frequently speaks and reads internationally. In 2008, the University of the West Indies, Cave Hill, Barbados, hosted a Symposium on the Fictions of Shani Mootoo in the Context of Caribbean Women&#x27;s Writings.

In 2009, she served on the jury for the Dayne Ogilvie Prize, a literary award for emerging LGBT writers in Canada, selecting Debra Anderson as that year&#x27;s prize winner.

Mootoo has spoken out against child abuse. In 1989 she addressed Sex Offenders at Stave Lake Correctional Centre about being a survivor of child abuse and suffering.

<doc id="1154626" wikidata="Q62594511" url="?curid=1154626" title="First Dynasty of Ur">
<text>The first dynasty of Ur (abbreviated Ur I) was a dynasty of rulers from the city of Ur in ancient Sumer who . Ur I is part of the Early Dynastic III period of ancient Mesopotamia. It was preceded by the earlier First Dynasty of Kish and the First Dynasty of Uruk.
==Rule==


According to the &quot;Sumerian King List&quot;, the final ruler of the First Dynasty of Uruk Lugal-kitun was overthrown by Mesannepada of Ur. There were then four kings in the First Dynasty of Ur: Mesannepada, Mes-kiagnuna, Elulu, and Balulu. Two other kings earlier than Mes-Anepada are known from other sources, namely Mes-kalam-du and A-Kalam-du. It would seem that Mes-Anepada was the son of Mes-kalam-du, according to the inscription found on a bead in Mari, and Mes-kalam-du was the founder of the dynasty. A probable Queen Puabi is also known from her lavish tomb at the Royal Cemetery at Ur. The First Dynasty of Ur had extensive influence over the area of Sumer, and apparently led a union of south Mesopotamian polities.

===Ethnicity and language===
Like other Sumerians, the people of Ur were a non-Semitic people who may have come from the east circa 3300 BCE, and spoke a language isolate.
===International trade===
The artifacts found in the royal tombs of the dynasty show that foreign trade was particularly active during this period, with many materials coming from foreign lands, such as Carnelian likely coming from the Indus or Iran, Lapis Lazuli from the Badakhshan area of Afghanistan, silver from Turkey, copper from Oman, and gold from several locations such as Egypt, Nubia, Turkey or Iran. Carnelian beads from the Indus were found in Ur tombs dating to 2600-2450, in an example of Indus-Mesopotamia relations. In particular, carnelian beads with an etched design in white were probably imported from the Indus Valley, and made according to a technique developed by the Harappans. These materials were used into the manufacture of beautiful objects in the workshops of Ur.
The Ur I dynasty had enormous wealth as shown by the lavishness of its tombs. This was probably due to the fact that Ur acted as the main harbour for trade with India, which put her in a strategic position to import and trade vast quantities of gold, carnelian or lapis lazuli. In comparison, the burials of the kings of Kish were much less lavish. High-prowed Sumerian ships may have traveled as far as Meluhha, thought to be the Indus region, for trade.
===Demise===
According to the &quot;Sumerian King List&quot;, the First Dynasty of Ur was finally defeated, and power went to the Elamite Awan dynasty. The Sumerian king Eannatum (c.2500–2400 BCE) of Lagash, then came to dominate the whole region, and established one of the first verifiable empires in history.

The power of Ur would only revive a few centuries later with the Third Dynasty of Ur.
==List of rulers==

===Sumerian King List===
Only the final kings of the First Dynasty of Ur, from Mesannepada to Balulu and possibly 4 unnamed kings, are mentioned in the &quot;Sumerian King List&quot;: 

==Artifacts==

The Royal Cemetery of Ur held the tombs of several rulers of the First Dynasty of Ur. The tombs are particularly lavish, and testify to the wealth of the First Dynasty of Ur. One of the most famous tombs is that of Queen Puabi.

<doc id="1154637" wikidata="Q2748237" url="?curid=1154637" title="Saint John Airport">
<text>Saint John Airport () is a Canadian airport in Saint John, New Brunswick. Located about east northeast of Uptown Saint John, in an area formerly known as Clover Valley, the airport serves the city of Saint John, the Greater Saint John metropolitan area, and the southern region of New Brunswick.

The airport, owned by Transport Canada, has been operated by the private non-profit corporation Saint John Airport Inc. since 1999. It is part of the National Airports System. In 2023, the terminal handled 175,000 passengers.

==Overview==
Saint John Airport was officially opened on January 8, 1952, although several aircraft, including at least one scheduled flight, had already landed at the airport by then. The airport is classified as an airport of entry by Nav Canada and is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). CBSA officers at this location can handle aircraft with no more than 120 passengers.

Part of the National Airports System, it is owned by Transport Canada and operated by Saint John Airport Inc.

== History ==
=== Background ===
Plans for an airport in Saint John date back to 1928, when in July it was decided that the city would be the site of the province&#x27;s first municipal airport. At that time, $100,000 was allocated for initial development, which was to occur shortly thereafter. From 1928 to 1951, the Saint John Municipal Airport, located in Millidgeville, served as the city&#x27;s aviation hub.

By the early 1940s, city councillors recognized the need for a larger airport, evidenced by the increased presence, size, and traffic of aircraft during World War II. They sought help from the provincial government to build a new, larger airport. In 1943, the current airport site underwent an engineering survey, following the creation of a search commission on May 15, 1943. The site, located east of the city, was 719 hectares in size and was purchased by the city on February 26, 1946, for $200,000. In December 1951, the original airport closed, and its land was later used for suburban housing development.

=== Construction and opening ===
In March 1949, construction for the new airport began, although an agreement between the provincial government and the city was not finalized until March 20, 1950. On January 8, 1952, the Saint John Airport officially opened. Located on the eastern side of Loch Lomond Road, the airport was established in an area previously known as Clover Valley, which consisted of farmland and forestry prior to its development. The opening ceremony included preparations for a large air show to take place the following spring. The construction of the airport cost between $5 and $6 million dollars.

<text>The Soldiers and Sailors Monument is a monument erected in Boston Common in downtown Boston, dedicated to soldiers and sailors of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts who died in the American Civil War. Designed by Martin Milmore, construction began in 1874 and the monument was dedicated on September 17, 1877. Union Generals George B. McClellan and Joseph Hooker were among the estimated 25,000 people attending the dedication on Boston Common.

==Overview==

The Soldiers and Sailors Monument is located on a rise called Flag Staff Hill. The monument is neoclassical in design, taking the form of a victory column carved of Hallowell white granite. The monument rises to a height of . The platform is and features four bas-relief bronze tablets. The first tablet is titled &quot;The Departure for the War,&quot; and depicts a regiment marching by the Massachusetts State House. The second bas-relief tablet depicts the medical care on the battlefield and is titled &quot;The Sanitary Commission.&quot; The third tablet depicts Union sailors in an engagement between a Federal man-of-war and a Confederate ironclad (likely CSS &quot;Virginia&quot;). The fourth tablet, entitled &quot;The Return from the War&quot;, shows a regiment of veterans marching by the State House to present their battle flags to Governor John Albion Andrew.

Above the bas-relief tablets at the base of the column are four carved granite figures representing the northern, southern, eastern and western sections of the reunited nation. The bas reliefs feature images of Edgar Allan Poe and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.

Bronze statues stand on the corners of the monument to represent peace, holding an olive branch and facing south; history, holding a book and gazing skyward; a sailor, clad in a navy uniform and gazing toward the sea; and the citizen-soldier, wearing an army uniform and standing at ease. The bases that hold the statues were empty for several years leading to conflicting stories that the monument was never finished or the statues had been stolen or placed in storage. The mystery was solved in 2014 when the statues were returned after restoration at the Daedalus Studios in nearby Watertown.

Surmounting the doric column is a bronze allegorical female figure entitled . She faces south and wears a tiara of thirteen stars. Her left hand holds the United States flag and her right hand clutches a laurel wreath and sword.

<text>John Joliffe Yarnall (1786–1815) was an officer in the United States Navy during the War of 1812 and the Second Barbary War.

== Biography ==
Yarnall was born in Wheeling, Virginia (later West Virginia), Yarnall was appointed midshipman in the Navy on 11 January 1809. Between 1809 and 1812, Yarnall cruised the coastal waters of the United States in &quot;Chesapeake&quot; and &quot;Revenge&quot; performing duty that was tantamount to blockading his own country to enforce President James Madison&#x27;s embargo on trade with the European adversaries during the Napoleonic Wars. In 1813, he was transferred to Oliver Hazard Perry&#x27;s command on the Great Lakes and became the first lieutenant on board Perry&#x27;s flagship, &quot;Lawrence&quot;. He participated in the decisive Battle of Lake Erie on 10 September 1813 and, though wounded, refused to leave his post during the engagement. When Perry shifted his flag to &quot;Niagara&quot; during the battle, Lt. Yarnall assumed command of &quot;Lawrence&quot;. After the battle, he took the squadron&#x27;s wounded on board and carried them back to Erie for medical attention. For his performance in the battle, Yarnall earned Perry&#x27;s commendation as well as a medal expressing the gratitude of Congress and the country.

In the spring of 1815, Yarnall sailed from New York with Stephen Decatur in the frigate &quot;Guerriere&quot; for the Mediterranean Sea to conduct the Second Barbary War. On 17 June, off the Algerian coast, his ship encountered and captured &quot;Mashuda&quot;, the flagship of the Algerian Navy. During that engagement, Yarnall again suffered wounds. In recognition of his role in the battle, and perhaps because of his wounds, Decatur chose Lt. Yarnall to carry the dispatches from Decatur&#x27;s squadron to the government in Washington, D.C.

== Disappearance and death ==
In July 1815, Yarnall embarked in the sloop-of-war &quot;Epervier&quot; for the voyage home. The warship was last seen on 14 July 1815 as she passed through the Strait of Gibraltar and into the Atlantic. Presumably, Yarnall and all others on board went down with her during the transatlantic voyage.

Two ships, USS &quot;Yarnall&quot;, were named for him.

<text>Eden Victoria Lena Robinson (born 19 January 1968) is an Indigenous Canadian author. She is a member of the Haisla and Heiltsuk First Nations in British Columbia, Canada.

== Personal life ==
Robinson was born in Kitamaat, British Columbia, and is a member of the Haisla and Heiltsuk First Nations. Robinson pursued her academic journey, earning a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Victoria, followed by a Master of Fine Arts from the University of British Columbia. 

In 2003, Robinson returned to Kitamaat Village to provide care for her father, who had been battling Parkinson&#x27;s Disease since 1998. However, in 2019, she faced her own health challenge with a diagnosis of Polymyalgia rheumatica.

Her sister, Carla Robinson, is a television journalist for CBC Newsworld.

==Literary works==

Robinson&#x27;s first book, &quot;Traplines&quot; (1995), was a collection of four short stories. The young narrators recount haunting tales of their disturbing relationships with sociopaths and psychopaths. The collection won Britain&#x27;s Winifred Holtby Memorial Prize for the best regional work by a Commonwealth writer. One of the stories, &quot;Queen of the North&quot;, was also published in &quot;The Penguin Anthology of Stories by Canadian Women&quot;. Another of her short stories, &quot;Terminal Avenue&quot;, (which was not included in &quot;Traplines&quot;) was published in the anthology of postcolonial science fiction and fantasy &quot;So Long Been Dreaming&quot;.

Her second book, &quot;Monkey Beach&quot; (2000), is a novel. It is set in Kitamaat territory and follows a teenage girl&#x27;s search for answers to and understanding of her younger brother&#x27;s disappearance at sea while in the retrospective, it tells a story about growing up on a Haisla reserve. The book is both a mystery and a spiritual journey, combining contemporary realism with Haisla mysticism. &quot;Monkey Beach&quot; was shortlisted for the Scotiabank Giller Prize and the Governor General&#x27;s Literary Award, and received the Ethel Wilson Fiction Prize.

In her third book, &quot;Blood Sports&quot; (2006), also a novel, Robinson returns to the characters and urban terrain of her novella &quot;Contact Sports,&quot; from &quot;Traplines&quot;.

Her novel &quot;Son of a Trickster&quot; (2017) is a humorous coming of age novel and the first of a trilogy. It took Robinson eight years to write, and was originally conceived as a short story. The second book in the trilogy is &quot;Trickster Drift&quot; (2018), which follows the main character from Kitamaat to Vancouver. The third book in the trilogy, titled &quot;The Return of the Trickster&quot;, was published March 2, 2021.

&quot;Son of a Trickster&quot; was optioned for a television series, which premiered as &quot;Trickster&quot; on CBC Television in 2020.

==Awards and honors==
Robinson was awarded the Ethel Wilson Fiction Prize in 2001 for &quot;Monkey Beach&quot;, and the Writers&#x27; Trust Engel/Findley Award in 2016 for her body of work. In 2017 she was named a recipient of the $50,000 Writers&#x27; Trust Fellowship.

&quot;Son of a Trickster&quot; was shortlisted for the 2017 Scotiabank Giller Prize. &quot;Trickster Drift&quot; won the Ethel Wilson Fiction Prize at the BC Book Awards on May 11, 2019.

&quot;Son of a Trickster&quot; was selected for the 2020 edition of &quot;Canada Reads&quot;, in which it was defended by actress Kaniehtiio Horn.

<doc id="1154676" wikidata="Q1309241" url="?curid=1154676" title="Swing axle">
<text>A swing axle is a simple type of independent suspension designed and patented by Edmund Rumpler in 1903 for the rear axle of rear wheel drive vehicles. This was a revolutionary invention in automotive suspension, allowing driven (powered) wheels to follow uneven road surfaces independently, thus enabling the vehicle&#x27;s wheels to maintain better road contact and holding; plus each wheel&#x27;s reduced unsprung weight means their movements have less impact on the vehicle as a whole. The first automotive application was the Rumpler Tropfenwagen, another early example was the 1923 Tatra 11 later followed by the Mercedes 130H/150H/170H, the Standard Superior, the pre-facelift Volkswagen Beetle and most of its derivatives, the Chevrolet Corvair, and the roll-over prone M151 jeep amongst others.

Many later automobile rear swing axles have universal joints connecting the driveshafts to the differential, which is attached to the chassis. Swing axles do not have universal joints at the wheels — the wheels are always perpendicular to the driveshafts; the design is therefore not suitable for a car&#x27;s front wheels, which require steering motion. Nevertheless, a simplified variant, wherein the differential remained fixed to one of the halfshafts, was offered optionally on the 1963 Jeep Wagoneer&#x27;s &quot;front&quot; axle, upon its market introduction.

Swing axle suspensions often used leaf springs and shock absorbers, though later Mercedes-Benz applications used coil springs and the VW beetle swing axle was torsion bar sprung.

One problem inherent in the swing axle concept is that it almost inevitably results in a very high roll centre which causes detrimental jacking effects and camber change when cornering and lateral cornering forces are applied. Its simple geometry limits design freedom to a great extent. 

Swing axles can also be used on as a low cost and durable independent suspension solution for non-driven front or rear axles, the Tatra 17 which had swing axles front and rear being an early example. It was also used in early aircraft (1910 or before), such as the Sopwith and Fokker, usually with rubber bungee and no damping.

==Comparison==
===Advantage===
The swing axle suspension has two advantages over the typical live axle:
* It reduced unsprung weight since the differential is mounted to the chassis
* It eliminates sympathetic camber changes on opposite wheels

===Shortcomings===
* A great amount of single-wheel camber change is experienced relative to beam axle designs, since the radius of the jointed half-shaft is less than half that of the whole axle assembly.
* &quot;Jacking&quot; on suspension unloading (or rebound) causes positive camber changes on both sides, which (In extreme cases) can overturn the car.
* Change in camber due to cornering forces can cause loss of rear-wheel adhesion leading to oversteer—a dynamically unstable condition that can cause a vehicle to spin. This is an especially severe problem when a swing axle is used in a rear-engine design, because of the greater side-g forces on the rear wheels from the mass of the engine. Camber changes during deceleration can increase the severity of lift-off oversteer.

===Solutions===
Several engineering options can limit swing axle handling problems, with varying success:
* &quot;Anti-roll bar&quot;: As a design option, a front anti-roll bar which can ameliorate the swing axle car&#x27;s handling—shifting weight transfer to the front outboard tyre, considerably reducing rear slip angles—thereby avoiding potential oversteer.
* Single-pivot point: Mercedes-Benz addressed the handling issues by producing swing axles with a single-pivot point located under the differential, thus well below the axle. This configuration markedly reduced the tendency to &quot;jack-up&quot; and the later low pivot swing-axle equipped cars were praised in contemporary publications for their handling. The low-pivot swing-axle remained in production with Mercedes-Benz W108 280SE and 300SEL until 1972. It was fitted to the 300SEL 6.3, which was during the early 1970s the world&#x27;s fastest production sedan. AMG-modified 6.3s were also raced with the stock swing axle.
* Tyre pressure differential: The Renault Dauphine, Volkswagen Beetle and first generation Chevrolet Corvair (1960–1964) used a &quot;tyre pressure differential&quot; strategy to eliminate oversteer characteristics of their swing axle suspensions—specifically low front and high rear tyre pressure—which induced understeer. The &quot;tyre pressure differential&quot; strategy offered a &quot;significant&quot; disadvantage: owners and mechanics could inadvertently but easily re-introduce oversteer characteristics by over-inflating the front tyres (that is, to typical pressures for other cars with other suspension systems) or by inflating all four tyres to the same pressure. The effectiveness of this option was criticized in lawsuits in the US during the 1960s.
* &quot;Z-bar&quot; and &quot;roll-inducing springs&quot;: Mercedes-Benz introduced, to help their low-pivot swing-axle, a coil spring mounted transversely above the differential, which would transfer load from one side to the other, so as to force down one wheel when the other side went up. This coil spring increases the load bearing capacity of the rear suspension, so a new lower pressure set of springs was substituted for the usual ones to maintain ride suppleness. A similar effect was achieved by VW&#x27;s Z-bar, as opposed to anti-roll bar. Both devices distribute the response of the rear axles to input on one wheel, thus reducing the tendency for excessive camber to occur on one wheel. These solutions represent a compromise between swing axle and beam axle characteristics, at the cost of decreasing ride quality.
* &quot;Camber compensator&quot;: A transverse leaf spring is connected to the outer ends of the half-shafts and below the suspension assembly, resisting positive camber that could result from cornering forces or rebound. This was a successful solution introduced on the 1964 Corvair, and also factory-installed on Porsche 356 Super 90s and some later models. Aftermarket camber compensators are available for Porsche, VW and early Corvairs.

==Safety==
Ralph Nader in his 1965 book &quot;Unsafe at Any Speed&quot; detailed accidents and lawsuits related to the shortcomings in 1960–1963 models of the first generation Chevrolet Corvair&#x27;s swing-axle design. Nader identified a Chevrolet engineer who had fought management after the management had eliminated a front anti-roll bar for cost reasons. The 1964 models were fitted with a front anti-roll bar as standard equipment, in addition to a rear transverse leaf spring, thus improving stability during emergency maneuvering. Second-generation Corvairs (1965–1969) used a true independent rear suspension (IRS) system.

The Hillman Imp designers learned from the problems with the Corvair, having crashed one at a relatively low speed, and they designed their rear-engined car with a semi-trailing arm suspension at the rear. To attain correct handling balance, they actually used swing-axle geometry at the front, with the steering pivots mounted at the outer ends of single swing wishbones. These caused too much understeer and uneven tyre wear, and modifications were made to reduce the positive camber of the front wheels by lowering the swing-axle pivot points. Aftermarket kits were also available to do this, and an inexpensive alternative was to insert a tapered shim to change the inclination of the kingpin carrier relative to the wishbone.

==Replacement==
Swing axles were supplanted in general use by de Dion tube axles in the late 1960s, though live axles remained the most common. Most rear suspensions have been replaced by more modern independent suspensions in recent years, and both swing and de Dion types are virtually unused today.

One exception is the Czech truck manufacturer Tatra, which has been using swing axles on a central &#x27;backbone&#x27; tube since 1923 (model Tatra 11) instead of more common solid axles. This system is claimed to give greater rigidity and better performance on poor quality roads and off-road. There the inherent reduced stability on roads is compensated by an increased stability on rough terrain, allowing for higher off-road speeds, all else being equal. This is especially manifested in long 6+ wheel vehicles where off-road chassis twisting can be a major issue.

==Twin I-Beam==

Another use of the swing axle concept is Ford&#x27;s &quot;Twin I-Beam&quot; front suspension for trucks. This system has solid axles, and may transmit power in four-wheel-drive versions, where it is called &quot;Twin Traction Beam&quot;. It is an independent suspension system, as each tyre rises and falls without affecting the position of the other. Although each tyre still moves in an arc as in a standard swing-axle suspension, the lower control arms effectively are lengthened by attaching the axle pivot point to the bottom of the opposite frame rail (i.e., the left lower control arm pivots on the right frame rail and vice versa). The lowered pivot point and longer arm length reduce the change in camber and the effect is far less hazardous than powered swing axles for the rear wheels listed above, where the pivot point is approximately on the same side frame rail. The Twin I-Beam suspension includes an additional radius arm link on each side to control caster.

Although the camber change is reduced with the Twin I-Beam suspension, the A-arm suspension system constrains the wheel into a parallelogram motion, further minimizing camber changes throughout suspension travel.

The 1956 Series 1 Lotus Eleven sports racers used a swing-axle front suspension, derived from the Ford E93 sedan.

<text>Jabberjaw is an American animated television series created by Joe Ruby and Ken Spears and produced by Hanna-Barbera which aired 16 original episodes on ABC from September 11 to December 18, 1976. Reruns continued on ABC until September 3, 1978.

==Premise==
Jabberjaw, a long amphibious great white shark, is the drummer for The Neptunes, a rock group made up of four teenagers—Biff, Shelly, Bubbles and Clamhead—who live in an underwater civilization. Jabberjaw and The Neptunes travel to various underwater cities where they encounter and deal with assorted megalomaniacs and supervillains who want to conquer the undersea world.

Like a great deal of Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s 1970s output, the format and writing for &quot;Jabberjaw&quot; was similar to that for &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;, &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; and &quot;Speed Buggy&quot;. The show also drew inspiration (in the use of a shark as a character) from the overall shark mania of the mid-1970s caused by the then-recent film &quot;Jaws&quot;. It also shared &quot;The Flintstones&quot;&#x27; penchant for making use of puns as the names of locations, people, etc., in this case, ocean-themed puns (such as &quot;Aqualaska&quot; instead of Alaska). Every episode ended with a musical chase sequence where Jabberjaw and the gang would run from the villains, performing zany cartoon antics in order to escape while a song by The Neptunes played in the background.

==Characters==

* Jabberjaw (voiced by Frank Welker impersonating Curly Howard) is an air-breathing, Brooklyn-accented anthropomorphic great white shark with mannerisms similar to Curly of The Three Stooges. Jabberjaw found it hard to get respect in a society where &quot;shark ejectors&quot; (robots that would guard various buildings or cities from sharks entering) were commonplace. These robots, as well as unpleasant treatment from others, frequently prompt him to utter some variation of his catchphrase (borrowed from the comedian Rodney Dangerfield): &quot;I don&#x27;t get no respect!&quot; He has the unique ability to change his shape or adapt himself to act like various objects such as a trampoline, parachute, jack, throw rug, etc., either to get himself and the gang out of a jam, or just to hide.
* Biff (voiced by Tommy Cook) is an athletic, handsome, brown-haired young man who is the band&#x27;s guitar player and level-headed leader who books all the gigs. In many episodes, his hair is drawn black. His main catchphrase is &quot;Jumpin&#x27; jellyfish!&quot; (occasionally, &quot;Hoppin&#x27; halibut!&quot;)
* Shelly (voiced by Patricia Parris) is a dark-haired young woman who plays tambourine and sings backup vocals for The Neptunes. She is beautiful and intelligent, but haughty, vain, and abrasive (like &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&#x27;&quot; Alexandra) and considers herself to be the star of the band. While she holds a great deal of disdain for Jabberjaw (or &quot;&quot;Blubberhead&quot; as she calls him), she does have some grudging fondness for him deep down and occasionally shows it.
* Bubbles (voiced by Julie McWhirter) is a young woman with blonde curly hair who plays keyboard for The Neptunes. She is extremely ditzy and dimwitted, has a cute giggle, similar to &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&#x27;&quot; Melody. Shelly sometimes nicknames her &quot;Ding-a-Ling&quot; or &quot;Bubblehead&quot;. Whenever she volunteers to help, she usually ends up messing it up.
* Clamhead (voiced by Barry Gordon) is a tall and slim, red-haired young man who plays bass for The Neptunes and is Jabberjaw&#x27;s best friend. His catchphrases are crying out &quot;Abba-abba-abba!&quot; and &quot;Wowee-wow-wow-wow!&quot;&quot; (or some variation, commonly featuring the word &quot;zowie&quot;) whenever he gets excited.

==Broadcast history==
Sixteen 30-minute episodes of &quot;Jabberjaw&quot; were produced, which aired on ABC Saturday Morning from September 11, 1976, to September 3, 1977, and rebroadcast for a second season of reruns on Sunday Morning from September 11, 1977, to September 3, 1978. In the 1980s, repeats resurfaced as part of &quot;USA Cartoon Express&quot; on USA Network, in the 1990s on Cartoon Network and in the 2000s on Boomerang. Reruns of the series started airing on Discovery Family on September 14, 2024. This is one of a number of shows made before the mid-1980s seen on the Cartoon Network and Boomerang to have been taken from PAL prints.

Like many animated series created by Hanna-Barbera in the 1970s, the show contained a laugh track created by the studio.

Broadcast schedules (all EDT):
*September 11, 1976 – November 27, 1976, ABC Saturday 9:00-9:30 AM
*December 4, 1976 – September 3, 1977, ABC Saturday 8:30-9:00 AM
*September 11, 1977 – September 3, 1978, ABC Sunday 10:30-11:00 AM

==Episodes==
==Other appearances==

* Jabberjaw guest starred as an announcer or referee on the &quot;Laff-A-Lympics&quot; segment of &quot;Scooby&#x27;s All-Star Laff-A-Lympics&quot; in the episodes &quot;Mexico and England&quot; (1977), &quot;India and Israel&quot; (1977), &quot;Africa and California&quot; (1977), &quot;New York and Turkey&quot; (1978) and &quot;Louisiana and Atlantis&quot; (1978).
* Jabberjaw made a special guest appearance at a celebrity roast honoring Fred Flintstone on the TV special &quot;Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s All-Star Comedy Ice Revue&quot; (1978). In this appearance, Jabberjaw is voiced by Don Messick.
* Jabberjaw co-starred in the series &quot;Yogi&#x27;s Space Race&quot; (1978) in which he participated in intergalactic racing competitions with Yogi Bear, Huckleberry Hound and other characters; his racing partner was a lazy bloodhound named Buford (from &quot;The Buford Files&quot; of &quot;Buford and the Galloping Ghost&quot;) and their race ship contained a track on which Buford ran to increase speed. Jabber and Buford were both voiced by Frank Welker.

<doc id="1154711" wikidata="Q7500294" url="?curid=1154711" title="Shomer">
<text>In Jewish religious law (&quot;halacha&quot;), a shomer (, pl. , shomrim) is a Jewish legal guardian entrusted with the custody and care of another&#x27;s object.

The laws of &quot;shomrim&quot; (pl. &quot;keepers&quot;; &quot;watchmen&quot;) are derived from the Torah in the Book of Exodus (). It is also discussed in the Talmud in the Bava Kamma and Bava Metzia tractates, which deal with torts, usury, and property law.

There are four types of &quot;shomrim&quot;: an unpaid custodian, a paid custodian, a borrower, and a renter (&#x27;,&#x27;, &#x27;, and&#x27;, respectively). Each &quot;shomer&quot; has distinct laws in &quot;halacha&quot; that apply to it. The two major factors that determine a guardian&#x27;s liability are whether the guardian has the ability to use the item (i.e., a renter or borrower) and whether money is exchanged. In general, having the ability to use the item and being a paid custodian increase the guardian&#x27;s liability, while paying for the use of something (i.e., being a renter) decreases the guardian&#x27;s liability.

==Types of shomrim==

===&quot;Shomer Chinam&quot;===
A &quot;shomer Chinam&quot; (Hebrew: שומר חנם, pl. שומרי חנם, &quot;shomrei chinam&quot;), or unpaid watchman, is one who watches an item without receiving payment for his watching. &quot;Shomrei cḥinnam&quot; are liable only for damages that result from their own negligence. They must pay for damages that result from their negligence.

The &quot;shomer cḥinnam&quot; does not have permission to use the item he or she is entrusted with.

===&quot;Shomer sakhar&quot;===
A &quot;shomer sakhar&quot; (Hebrew: שומר שכר, pl. שומרי שכר, &quot;shomrei sakhar&quot;), or paid watchman, also known as a &quot;noseh sakhar&quot; (Hebrew: נושא שכר, one who receives payment) is one who watches an item in exchange for compensation. In addition to the obligations of the &quot;shomer ḥinnam&quot;, &quot;shomrei sakhar&quot; are liable if the item is stolen. Armed robbery is exempted from this responsibility, however, as it is considered beyond the custodian&#x27;s reasonable control.

&quot;Shomrei shakhar&quot; are also liable if the item is lost or misplaced, even if the loss was not a result of negligence.

In addition to the paid watchman&#x27;s heightened level of liability, in certain ways the &quot;shomer sakhar&quot; is expected to perform a higher level of custodianship. A &quot;shomer sakhar&quot;, for example, cannot watch an item in a way that would only protect it from a reasonable wind, but rather must watch an item in a way as to protect it from any possible wind, and the absence of such would make the &quot;shomer&quot; liable.

The &quot;shomer sakhar&quot; also may not use the item entrusted.

===&quot;Sokher&quot;===
A &quot;sokher&quot; (Hebrew: שוכר) is a renter. The liabilities of a sokher are the same as those of a &quot;shomer sakhar&quot;.

===&quot;Sho&#x27;el&quot;===
A &quot;shoel&quot; (Hebrew: שואל) is a borrower. The &quot;shoel&quot; is liable for the entrusted item in all circumstances, including those that are not the &quot;shoel&#x27;s&quot; fault, known as &quot;Onsim&quot; (Hebrew: אונסים, sing. אונס, Ones). The &quot;shoel&#x27;s&quot; only exemption is for damage resulting from the normal use of the item, for example if a borrowed ox dies as a result of normal plowing.

==Biblical sources for &quot;shomrim&quot;==
The gemara in tractate Bava Metzia discusses the biblical sourcing of each of the categories of &quot;shomrim&quot;. The gemara concludes that refers to the &quot;shomer ḥinnam&quot;, 22:9-12 to the &quot;shomer sakhar&quot;, 22:13-14 to the &quot;shoel&quot;, and 22:14 to the sokher.

==Becoming a &quot;shomer&quot;==
Generally, one must be willing to become a &quot;shomer&quot; in order to assume liability, and as such cannot be forced to watch an item. In certain circumstances, such as when one encounters a lost item, the Torah dictates that until the item is returned, the person assumes the liability and responsibility of a &quot;shomer sakhar&quot;.

==The &quot;Shomrim&#x27;s&quot; Oath==
In order for a &quot;shomer&quot; to verify the circumstances of the entrusted item&#x27;s loss, &quot;shomrim&quot; are required to swear a group of oaths in Beit Din. The oaths required of a &quot;shomer&quot; typically include swearing how the item was lost, swearing that the &quot;shomer&quot; had not been negligent, and swearing that the shomer had not misappropriated the item.

<text>In computing, double data rate (DDR) describes a computer bus that transfers data on both the rising and falling edges of the clock signal and hence doubles the memory bandwidth by transferring data twice per clock cycle. This is also known as double pumped, dual-pumped, and double transition. The term toggle mode is used in the context of NAND flash memory.

The simplest way to design a clocked electronic circuit is to make it perform one transfer per full cycle (rise and fall) of a clock signal. This, however, requires that the clock signal changes twice per transfer, while the data lines change at most once per transfer. When operating at a high bandwidth, signal integrity limitations constrain the clock frequency. By using both edges of the clock, the data signals operate with the same limiting frequency, thereby doubling the data transmission rate.

This technique has been used for microprocessor front-side busses, Ultra-3 SCSI, expansion buses (AGP, PCI-X), graphics memory (GDDR), main memory (both RDRAM and DDR1 through DDR5), and the HyperTransport bus on AMD&#x27;s Athlon 64 processors. It is more recently being used for other systems with high data transfer speed requirements as an example, for the output of analog-to-digital converters (ADCs).

DDR should not be confused with dual channel, in which each memory channel accesses two RAM modules simultaneously. The two technologies are independent of each other and many motherboards use both, by using DDR memory in a dual channel configuration.

An alternative to double or quad pumping is to make the link self-clocking. This tactic was chosen by InfiniBand and PCI Express.

== Relation of bandwidth and frequency ==
Describing the bandwidth of a double-pumped bus can be confusing. Each clock edge is referred to as a &quot;beat&quot;, with two beats (one upbeat and one downbeat) per cycle. Technically, the hertz is a unit of &quot;cycles&quot; per second, but many people refer to the number of &quot;transfers&quot; per second. Careful usage generally talks about &quot;500 MHz, double data rate&quot; or &quot;1000 MT/s&quot;, but many refer casually to a &quot;1000 MHz bus,&quot; even though no signal cycles faster than 500 MHz.

DDR SDRAM popularized the technique of referring to the bus bandwidth in megabytes per second, the product of the transfer rate and the bus width in bytes. DDR SDRAM operating with a 100 MHz clock is called DDR-200 (after its 200 MT/s data transfer rate), and a 64-bit (8-byte) wide DIMM operated at that data rate is called PC-1600, after its 1600 MB/s peak (theoretical) bandwidth. Likewise, 12.8 GB/s transfer rate DDR3-1600 is called PC3-12800.

Some examples of popular designations of DDR modules:
DDR SDRAM uses double-data-rate signalling only on the data lines. Address and control signals are still sent to the DRAM once per clock &quot;cycle&quot; (to be precise, on the rising edge of the clock), and timing parameters such as CAS latency are specified in clock cycles. Some less common DRAM interfaces, notably LPDDR2, GDDR5 and XDR DRAM, send commands and addresses using double data rate. DDR5 uses two 7-bit double data rate command/address buses to each DIMM, where a registered clock driver chip converts to a 14-bit SDR bus to each memory chip.

<text>Jonathan Michael King (born 8 June 1955) is an English singer, musician, songwriter, and Grammy nominated art director, best known as the singer of the post-punk band Gang of Four.

==Biography==
King attended Sevenoaks School, where he was a member of the &#x27;Art Room&#x27; that produced musicians Tom Greenhalgh and Mark White of The Mekons, along with Andy Gill of Gang of Four, documentarian Adam Curtis, and film director Paul Greengrass.

As Gang of Four lyricist and co-songwriter, he sang and played melodica and percussion such as a microwave oven or wooden block (using a baseball bat or a stick), the latter notably on the song &quot;He&#x27;d Send in the Army&quot;. Jon Pareles in &quot;The New York Times&quot; described King&#x27;s lyrics as &quot;bitterly analytical, infused with theories from Marx, Adorno, Baudrillard and Godard, and the band was determined to puncture pop romance with the consciousness that people are manipulated by power, economics, media and marketing.

Jon King co-wrote and co-produced &quot;Entertainment!&quot;, Gang of Four&#x27;s debut album, regularly listed as among the top 100 albums of all time and described by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine as &quot;the best debut album by a British band – punk or otherwise – since the original English release of &quot;The Clash&quot; in 1977.

Referring to the influence of Situationist ideas on Gang of Four&#x27;s work, Jon King remarked, in a 1980 letter to Greil Marcus, that &quot;where I think that Situationism was good was in the development of its revolutionary tactic: &#x27;reinvesting&#x27; the cultural past. Situationism conspicuously used popular imagery in order to subvert it – to make the familiar strange, rather than rejecting the familiar out of hand. The tactic was good, worth ripping off, as in the &quot;Entertainment!&quot; cover, or the original &quot;Damaged Goods&quot; sleeve.&quot; In an interview with NPR the author stated &quot;King&#x27;s lyrics have always meant different things to different people. Some see his words as a reaction to Margaret Thatcher, unemployment in early-&#x27;80s Britain or the unraveling of the unions. But King says he was more interested in &quot;changing the meaning of things by the label&quot;. King said in the same feature: &quot;I remember when I was 15, I got incredibly excited when I found some grubby old book in a secondhand bookshop about the revolution in Paris in 1968 (...) There was a picture, which I still cherish – it was a photograph for some kind of perfume and a very glamorous-looking woman on this poster, and someone had written on it in French: &quot;You know I know I&#x27;m exploiting you, but I&#x27;m not doing it on purpose&quot;. I got terribly excited by the fact ... you can change the meaning of things by the label... I wondered how one could play around with these sorts of ideas in music&quot;.

King was primary lyricist in the band and wrote words to almost all their most influential songs, including &quot;Damaged Goods&quot;, &quot;Natural&#x27;s Not In It&quot;, &quot;I Found That Essence Rare&quot;, &quot;What We All Want&quot;, &quot;I Love a Man in a Uniform&quot;, &quot;Call Me Up&quot; and others. He said of his lyrics, quoted by Michael Hoover: &quot;If you, say, look at the published agenda of music which limits itself to a very small set of subjects and the way it approaches these subjects (which in its most extreme identity is a sort of Bryan Adams-style song), about missing or making up with your girl, driving the car, in some sort of all-white, midwestern high school, which is an incredibly common motif ... I don&#x27;t know anything about that. That is something which is a very specific American topic, but it seems to be exhaustively gone around. I had a chance to describe it the other night, like a dog returning to its own vomit. &quot;The Guardian&quot;, in its citation of &quot;Entertainment!&quot; as one of 100 greatest British albums of all time, said that King&#x27;s &quot;lyrics performed the minor miracle of rendering deconstructionist slogans - Marx and Engels by way of Guy Debord - into telegrammatic rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll rabble-rousing&quot;. &quot;In other words, pop songs as false emotional advertising and ideology as everydayness are themselves grounds for inquiry&quot;, as King told Greil Marcus, because &quot;unless you have an awareness of your views as political manifestations, you won&#x27;t believe you can change them&quot;. A 2014 re-appraisal of &quot;Entertainment!&quot; said, in reference to King&#x27;s lyrics, that they &quot;deal with one of Karl Marx’s theories most widely favoured by the Situationists, the guttansweng [Gattungswesen] (&quot;species-being&quot;). The guttansweng is the idea that people become separated from their human nature and thus become alienated within a capitalist environment... &quot;At Home He&#x27;s a Tourist&quot; is surely inspired by chapter 30 of Guy Debord&#x27;s definitive text &quot;The Society of the Spectacle&quot;, which features the lines &quot;the externality of the spectacle in relation to the active man appears in the fact that his gestures are no longer his but those of another who represent them to him. This is why the spectator feels at home nowhere, because the spectacle is everywhere&quot;. King himself, talking about the same song, said: &quot;Sometimes, you get lucky and a line comes that makes everything easy. Suddenly getting the answer to a question when you turn off and think about something else. Thrown-ness - if that&#x27;s a word at all – was something we puzzled over. Why, if everything is like it is, do so many things seem ersatz, phoney. But it&#x27;s not phoney if you know it&#x27;s phoney, as Truman Capote said of Holly Golightly &quot;she&#x27;s not a phoney because she&#x27;s a real phoney&quot;.

King created the cover art for many of their albums, including the outer sleeve designs for the &quot;Damaged Goods&quot; EP, &quot;At Home he&#x27;s a Tourist&quot;, &quot;Entertainment!&quot;, &quot;Solid Gold&quot; and &quot;A Brief History of the 20th Century&quot;. He was nominated for a Grammy in 2022 for his Art Direction of &quot;Gang of Four 77-81&quot;, a Matador records box-set issued in 2021

King has written music for TV and film, notably title music for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot;, &quot;Scrutiny&quot; and &quot;Westminster Daily&quot;. He co-wrote and produced songs featured on TV and the soundtracks of major movies such as &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; (1984), &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; (2004), and &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot; (2006); &quot;13 Reasons Why&quot; ( Netflix) The OC (HBO); and &quot;Treme&quot; (HBO). &quot;Natural&#x27;s Not in It&quot; (from the album &quot;Entertainment!&quot;) was used for 2012&#x27;s global Xbox ad campaign. He won in 2005 (as Gang of Four) &quot;Mojo&quot; Magazine&#x27;s &quot;Inspiration to Music&quot; MOJO Awards. In 2011 he performed with Gang of Four on &quot;The David Letterman Show&quot; and Jools Holland.

<text>The White House counsel is a senior staff appointee of the president of the United States whose role is to advise the president on all legal issues concerning the president and their administration. The White House counsel also oversees the Office of White House Counsel, a team of lawyers and support staff who provide legal guidance for the president and the White House Office. At least when White House counsel is advising the president on legal matters pertaining to the duties or prerogatives of the president, this office is also called Counsel to the President. 

David Warrington is the current White House counsel, serving since January 20, 2025.

==Responsibilities==
The Office of Counsel to the President and Vice President was created in 1943, and is responsible for advising on all legal aspects of policy questions; legal issues arising in connection with the president&#x27;s decision to sign or veto legislation, ethical questions, financial disclosures; and conflicts of interest during employment and post employment. The counsel&#x27;s office also helps define the line between official and political activities, oversees executive appointments and judicial selection, handles presidential pardons, reviews legislation and presidential statements, and handles lawsuits against the president in his role as president, as well as serving as the White House contact for the Department of Justice.

==Limitations==
Although the White House counsel offers legal advice to the president and vice president, the counsel does so in the president&#x27;s and vice president&#x27;s official capacity, and does not serve as the president&#x27;s personal attorney. Therefore, controversy has emerged over the scope of the attorney–client privilege between the counsel and the president and vice president, namely with John Dean of Watergate notoriety. It is clear, however, that the privilege does not apply in strictly personal matters. It also does not apply to legislative proceedings by the U.S. Congress against the president due to allegations of misconduct while in office, such as formal censures or impeachment proceedings. In those situations the president relies on a personal attorney if he desires confidential legal advice. The office is also distinct from the judiciary, and from others who are not appointed to positions but nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. These would be foremost the attorney general of the United States, and the principal deputy and other assistants, who are nominated by the president to oversee the United States Department of Justice, or the solicitor general of the United States and staff (the solicitor general is the fourth-ranking official in the Justice Department), who argue cases before the U.S. Supreme Court (and in lower federal courts) for the Justice Department when it is a party to the case.

<doc id="1154721" wikidata="Q387524" url="?curid=1154721" title="Doorstop">
<text>A doorstop (also door stopper, door stop or door wedge) is an object or device used to hold a door open or closed, or to prevent a door from opening too widely. The same word is used to refer to a thin slat built inside a door frame to prevent a door from swinging through when closed. A doorstop (applied) may also be a small bracket or 90-degree piece of metal applied to the frame of a door to stop the door from swinging (bi-directional) and converting that door to a single direction (in-swing push or out-swing pull). The doorstop can be a separate part or integrated with a hinge or door closer.

== History ==
Formally-produced doorstops trace their history to the 18th century in Europe, becoming widely manufactured in Europe in the early 19th century. By the mid 19th century, manufacturing had primarily moved to the United States. Despite their early manufacturing, credit for the invention of the doorstop is usually granted to Osburn Dorsey, an American inventor, in 1878. The doorstop was Dorsey&#x27;s most famous invention and he received a US patent, number 210,764, for the invention.

==Usage==

=== Holding doors open ===
A door may be stopped by a doorstop which is simply a heavy solid object, such as a brick, placed in the path of the door. These stops are predominantly improvised. Historically, lead bricks have been popular choices when available. However, as the toxic nature of lead has been revealed, this use has been strongly discouraged.

Another method is to use a doorstop which is a small wedge of wood, rubber, fabric, plastic, cotton or another material. Manufactured wedges of these materials are commonly available. The wedge is kicked into position and the downward force of the door, now jammed upwards onto the doorstop, provides enough static friction to keep it motionless.

A third strategy is to equip the door itself with a stopping mechanism. In this case, a short metal bar capped with rubber, or another high-friction material, is attached to a hinge near the bottom of the door opposite the door hinge and on the side of the door which is in the direction that it closes. When the door is to be kept open, the bar is swung down so that the rubber end touches the floor. In this configuration, further movement of the door towards being closed increases the force on the rubber end, thereby increasing the frictional force which opposes the movement. When the door is to be closed, the stop is released by pushing the door slightly more open, which releases the stop and allows it to be flipped upwards. A newer version of equipping the door with the stopping mechanism is to attach a magnet to the bottom or top of the door on the side which opens outward, which then latches onto another magnet or magnetic material on the wall or a small hub on the floor. The magnet must be strong enough to hold the weight of the door, but weak enough to be easily detached from the wall or hub.

===Preventing damage by doors===
Another type of doorstop is used to prevent doors from opening too far and damaging nearby walls. In this case a rubber cylinder or dome—or a rod or block of rubber-tipped metal, wood or plastic—is screwed into the wall, molding or the floor in the path of the door. If it is attached to the wall, it may be either a few inches above the ground, or at such a height as to meet the doorknob. A short, wall-attached doorstop, usually a rubber dome or cylinder, is sometimes called a wall bumper. Rigid metal springs (also tipped with rubber or plastic) are used to absorb and more widely distribute the kinetic energy of the door swinging. 

On occasion, stops are used that are fitted at the midpoint of the door, as part of the central door-hinge. Such stops are known as a &quot;hinge stops&quot; or &quot;hinge pin&quot; doorstops and are often used to prevent damage to baseboard molding.

===Holding doors closed===
In his 1906 book &quot;The Right Way to Do Wrong&quot;, Harry Houdini recommends the use of a doorstop wedge to prevent a door from being pushed open from the outside, to deter burglars at night.

==Dialect usage==
In various British English dialects, including those in the south-west, north-east and north-west of England, the word &quot;doorstop&quot; is cognate with &quot;doorstep&quot; in standard English, being derived from &quot;door&quot; and &quot;stoop&quot;.

<doc id="1154723" wikidata="Q7758069" url="?curid=1154723" title="President's Council on Bioethics">
<text>The President&#x27;s Council on Bioethics (PCBE) was a group of individuals appointed by United States President George W. Bush to advise his administration on bioethics. Established on November 28, 2001, by Executive Order , the council was directed to &quot;advise the President on bioethical issues that may emerge as a consequence of advances in biomedical science and technology&quot;. It succeeded and largely replaced the National Bioethics Advisory Commission, appointed by President Bill Clinton in 1996, which expired in 2001.

The members of the council were appointed directly by the President; the President also chose the chairperson of the council (last appointed Chair was Edmund D. Pellegrino). Council members, totaling no more than 18, were appointed for a two-year term, after which time they could be reappointed by the President. Individuals appointed could not be officers or employees of the federal government. Executive Order 13237 was renewed in 2003, 2005 and again in 2007.

== Expiration and replacement ==

In June 2009, President Barack Obama&#x27;s administration informed members of the council that their services were no longer needed. Through a spokesperson, Obama made clear that he intended to replace the committee with a body that &quot;offers practical policy options&quot; rather than philosophical guidance.

Executive Order 13521 of November 24, 2009, superseded the previous council by establishing the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues. On November 25, 2009, Obama named Amy Gutmann, the president of the University of Pennsylvania, to chair his new advisory panel on bioethics. James W. Wagner, the president of Emory University, was appointed vice chairperson.

== Criticism ==

Critics have questioned the motives and goals of the PCBE. Elizabeth Blackburn, who was dismissed from the Commission, co-authored an article, citing examples published by other members, suggesting that it was set up to justify President Bush&#x27;s positions on stem cell research and abortion, writing &quot;...our concern is that some of their contents... may have ended up distorting the potential of biomedical research and the motivation of some of its researchers.&quot;

Bioethicist Leslie A. Meltzer accused the council of wrapping &quot;political and religious agendas in the guise of dignity,&quot; and described them as largely Christian-affiliated neoconservatives; philosophers and political scientists rather than bench scientists. Meltzer said that Council members mischaracterized the positions of their opponents and used invective rather than addressing the merits of the arguments.

The response to President Obama&#x27;s decision to disband the council drew both criticism and praise. Colleen Carroll Campbell, a former speechwriter for President Bush and a member of the conservative advocacy group &quot;Ethics and Public Policy Center&quot; predicted that &quot;Obama&#x27;s desire to see his policies backed by expert &#x27;consensus&#x27; more likely will be realized with a new commission composed of like-minded political liberals steeped in utilitarianism than with the brainy, diverse and unpredictable crew that populated the now-defunct council.&quot; In contrast, Jacob M. Appel of New York&#x27;s Mount Sinai Hospital wrote that &quot;the panel itself, far from being an incubator of intellectual ferment, had evolved into a publicly funded right-wing think tank with a handful of token moderates for window dressing&quot; and argued that &quot;Obama was wise to scrap the entire panel and to start over.&quot;

<doc id="1154725" wikidata="Q357644" url="?curid=1154725" title="Gig (boat)">
<text>A gig is a type of boat. It was optimised for speed under oar, but usually also fitted with a sailing rig for appropriate conditions. The type was in use by Deal boatmen in the 18th century. It first occurred as a naval ship&#x27;s boat after Deal boatbuilders recommended a different design to boats ordered from them by the Royal Navy to equip the cutters purchased in the 1760s to combat smuggling. The captains of larger warships soon sought permission to substitute a gig for one of the heavier boats which were then used; some even had a gig built at their own expense. The gig therefore became part of the usual complement of ship&#x27;s boats used in warships.

Gigs also had civilian uses, being employed to take pilots to and from ships, carrying mail and people for vessels waiting at anchor for favourable winds, salvage and lifesavingand for smuggling. They could be found in places like the Mersey, as one of the faster and lighter boat types providing communication with ships anchored off the Norfolk and Suffolk coasts, and also from Deal to the Downs. The West Country is well known for its pilot gigs, with surviving and new-built examples now being raced at a large number of clubs in the region.

Gigs were lightly built, usually of clinker construction. They were narrow for their length. Typically, in naval gigs a beam of was used for hull lengths from propelled by between four, six or eight oars. Exceptions included gigs pulling ten oars. Oars were always single-banked in a gig.

Some would describe larger gigs as a galley, with regional variation on this terminology for civilian craft. Others regard the galley as a similar but different type. In Royal Navy usage of the latter half of the 19th century, the captain&#x27;s gig was always referred to as &quot;the galley&quot;. This contrasts with the US Navy usage: here the &quot;captain&#x27;s gig&quot; was originally the traditional wooden boat, but in recent times a fibre-glass hulled powerboat which provided transport for the captain to and from their ship.

==History==

The Royal Navy had, by the middle of the 18th century, a long-standing relationship with the boat builders of Deal. The Navy bought their clinker-built yawls and cutters which contrasted with the carvel hulls of boats built in the Navy yards. The working boats of Deal were well known to all in the Navy when they came out to warships anchored in the Downs. In 1763, the Navy bought thirty cutters cutter in the sense of the small warship or revenue protection vessel. These were to combat smuggling. To ensure they were properly equipped with boats, a dozen cutters (in the ship&#x27;s boat meaning of the word) were ordered from Deal boatbuilders. A discussion with four of the local boatbuilders ensued, and they gave the firm advice that the ordered boats were not suitable for catching smugglers. (The Deal boatmen had a reputation for involvement in a substantial amount of smuggling at the time.) What was recommended instead was the gig, a type of boat used locally. The Navy accepted the recommendation.

When war started with France again in 1793, naval captains came to prefer smaller, lighter boats than the barges that they were issued with. The barge was meant to match the status of the officer they carried, but something that could be launched quickly and achieve a good speed was much more useful. Some brought on board boats that were their own property. Others just ignored the barges carried and used one of the cutters out of their ship&#x27;s selection of boats. Gigs were the most popular of the private boats; Nelson had one on in 1801. By 1808 it is clear that the Navy had accepted the gig on vessels other than the anti-smuggling cutters. By the end of the Napoleonic Wars Royal Navy gigs were available in six different lengths (18 ft to 26 ft) for issue to British warships.

==Characteristics==
The gigs generally had a high wineglass transom, full keel, straight stem and somewhat rounded sides. There was in general very little rocker in the keel. The gunwales on many were nearly straight from bow to stern.

Howard Chapelle mentions the belief of W.P. Stephens that the gig was the precursor to the Whitehall rowboatbeing built (in New York) by former apprentices in the Navy Yard.

==Today==
Gigs are still built for racing, with five builders who build this type of boat. The Cornish Pilot Gig Association has 88 clubs and more than 8,000 active members. Regular competitive events are held.
==U.S. Navy==
In the U.S. Navy, the boat provided for the transport of the captain is termed the captain&#x27;s gig. Whilst this used to be a wooden, oared vessel of the traditional type, the term was retained as boats powered with engines took over this role.

These powered vessels varied by the size of the ship, with aircraft carriers and, until the mid-1990s when they were decommissioned, battleships, typically assigned a double cabin cruiser that was in length. These boats were typically painted with a white superstructure and gray hull with a red waterline stripe and black hull below the waterline. Because these capital ships also held a dual function as flagships for an embarked admiral, an identical vessel, albeit painted with a black hull and green waterline stripe, functioned as an admiral&#x27;s barge.

Captain&#x27;s gigs were eliminated from all U.S. Navy ships in early 2008 in an economy move.

==In popular culture==
* In science fiction, the term is often used to refer to a small auxiliary spacecraft. In &quot;Star Trek&quot;, the craft is referred to as a &quot;captain&#x27;s yacht&quot;.

<text>John &quot;Jake&quot; Burns (born 21 February 1958) is a singer and guitarist, and is best known as the frontman of Stiff Little Fingers, although he has also recorded with Jake Burns and the Big Wheel, 3 Men + Black, and as a solo artist.

== Early life ==
Burns was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and grew up in Joanmount in Ballysillan. Burns&#x27;s mother was a seamstress, and his father was a machinist in a textile machinery factory/steel foundry, where he was a shop steward, and his socialist views were an influence on Burns. Prior to punk, Burns&#x27;s musical influences included Rory Gallagher, Dr. Feelgood, Graham Parker, and Bob Marley.

== Career ==

=== Stiff Little Fingers ===

Burns started off his career at Belfast Boys&#x27; Model School with a rock covers band, Highway Star, which consisted of Burns, Gordon Blair, Henry Cluney, and Brian Faloon. Gordon Blair subsequently left the group to join Rudi, and Ali McMordie joined, about the time the band discovered punk.

They were briefly named the Fast, but as there was already a group of that name they changed it to Stiff Little Fingers, taken from the song of the same name that had appeared on &quot;Pure Mania&quot;, the 1977 album by the Vibrators. 

Apart from a five-year gap from 1983 to 1987, Stiff Little Fingers have been active since 1977 to the present day and have released ten studio albums.

=== Solo work ===
In 1981, Burns made his acting debut in an episode of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Play For Today&quot; series entitled &quot;Iris in the Traffic, Ruby in the Rain&quot;, written by Belfast-born poet and playwright Stewart Parker, which also featured the rest of Stiff Little Fingers effectively playing themselves as &#x27;The Band&#x27;.

After the breakup of SLF in 1983, Burns formed Jake Burns and the Big Wheel. The band consisted of Burns on vocals and guitar, Steve Grantley on drums, Sean Martin on bass guitar, and Pete Saunders on keyboards. Big Wheel recorded a total of three singles, &quot;On Fortune Street&quot;, &quot;She Grew Up&quot; and &quot;Breathless&quot;. A compilation album, also called &quot;On Fortune Street&quot;, was released after the band&#x27;s demise, in 2002.

In 1987, Burns disbanded Big Wheel, and Stiff Little Fingers reformed, because they were &quot;skint and wanted to make a bit of cash to get back to Ireland for Christmas&quot;.

From about 2001 to 2005, Burns was involved in a side project with Pauline Black of the Selecter, called 3 Men and Black. This involved Black touring with three male artists from the late 1970s, early 1980s doing acoustic versions of songs they are famous for, and talking a little about how they came to write the songs etc. The line up for the concerts was fairly fluid, and has included such people as Bruce Foxton, J. J. Burnel, Eric Faulkner and Nick Welsh.

On 27 March 2006, Burns released a solo album titled &quot;Drinkin&#x27; Again&quot;.

In 2009, Burns formed a Chicago punk rock supergroup called the Nefarious Fat Cats to raise money for local charities. Notable members include John Haggerty (Pegboy, Naked Raygun), Joe Haggerty (Pegboy), Joe Principe (Rise Against), Scott Lucas (Local H), Herb Rosen (Beer Nuts, Right of the Accused) and Mark DeRosa (Dummy). Mr. Burns also contributed guitar and vocals on a track of the Black Sheep Band charity record for Children&#x27;s Memorial Hospital, A Chicago Punk Rock Collaboration for the Kids, Vol 1.

In 2016, Burns joined an acoustic &quot;supergroup&quot; formed by Kirk Brandon, of Spear of Destiny called Dead Men Walking which also included David Ruffy and John &quot;Segs&quot; Jennings, both of Ruts DC.

== Personal life ==
Burns lived in London for over ten years from 1978 after Stiff Little Fingers had relocated there. His first wife lived in Newcastle upon Tyne, and after their marriage, he moved to Newcastle, where he lived for 16 years, becoming a supporter of Newcastle United F.C. He is also an avid supporter of the Northern Ireland national football team.

Burns&#x27;s second wife, Shirley, is American and they have lived in Chicago since 2004. Burns would eventually become a US citizen, partially so he could help vote out Donald Trump.

Johnston&#x27;s &quot;The Custodian of Paradise&quot;, published in 2006, told the story of Sheilagh Fielding, a fictional character originally introduced in &quot;Colony of Unrequited Dreams&quot;.

In 2002, Johnston published &quot;The Navigator of New York&quot;, a historical novel about the race by explorers to reach the North Pole; it was shortlisted for both the Giller Prize and the Governor General&#x27;s Award for fiction. &quot;A World Elsewhere&quot;, published in 2011, was a number one Canadian best seller.

<doc id="1154736" wikidata="Q2448091" url="?curid=1154736" title="Pop Rocks">
<text>Pop Rocks, also known as popping candy, is a type of candy owned by Zeta Espacial S.A. Pop Rocks ingredients include sugar, lactose (milk sugar), and flavoring. It differs from typical hard candy in that pressurized carbon dioxide gas bubbles are embedded inside of the candy, creating a small popping reaction when it dissolves.

==Background and history==
The concept was initially patented by General Foods research chemists Leon T. Kremzner and William A. Mitchell on December 12, 1961 (U.S. patent #3,012,893), with a subsequent patent by General Foods research chemists Fredric Kleiner, Pradip K. Roy, and Michael J. Kuchman on September 15, 1981 (U.S. patent #4,289,794),

The candy was not offered to the public until 1976, before General Foods withdrew it in 1983, citing its lack of success in the marketplace and its relatively short shelf life.

Distribution was initially controlled to ensure freshness; but with its increasing popularity, unauthorized redistribution from market to market resulted in out-of-date product reaching consumers. After that, Kraft Foods licensed the Pop Rocks brand to Zeta Espacial S.A. which continued manufacturing the product under Kraft&#x27;s license. Eventually, Zeta Espacial S.A. became the brand&#x27;s owner and sole manufacturer. Pop Rocks is distributed in the U.S. by Pop Rocks Inc. (Atlanta, Georgia) and by Zeta Espacial S.A. (Barcelona, Spain) in the rest of the world. Zeta Espacial S.A. also sells popping candy internationally under other brands including Peta Zetas, Wiz Fizz, and Magic Gum.

In 2008, Marvin J. Rudolph, who led the group assigned to bring Pop Rocks out of the laboratory and into the manufacturing plant, wrote a history of Pop Rocks development. The book, titled &quot;Pop Rocks: The Inside Story of America&#x27;s Revolutionary Candy&quot;, was based on interviews with food technologists, engineers, marketing managers, and members of Billy Mitchell&#x27;s family, along with the author&#x27;s experience. In the book, Rudolph points out that the Turkish company HLEKS Popping Candy flooded the market with popping candy in the year 2000.

A similar product, &quot;Cosmic Candy&quot;, previously called &quot;Space Dust&quot;, was in powdered form and was also manufactured by General Foods.

In 2012, Cadbury Schweppes Pty. Ltd. (in Australia) began producing a chocolate product named &quot;Marvellous Creations Jelly Popping Candy Beanies&quot; which contains popping candy, jelly beans and &quot;beanies&quot; (candy-covered chocolate). By 2013, Whittakers (New Zealand) had also released a local product (white chocolate with a local carbonated drink Lemon and Paeroa). Prominent British chef Heston Blumenthal has also made several desserts incorporating popping candy, both for the peculiar sensory experience of the popping and for the nostalgia value of using an ingredient popular in the 1970s.

==Manufacturing==
As described by a 1980 patent, the candy is made by dissolving sugars in water and is evaporated at until the water content is 3% by mass. The water and sugar mixture is then cooled to , and while being intensely stirred, it is pressurized with carbon dioxide at . The mixture is then kept under pressure and allowed to cool and solidify, embedding the carbon dioxide bubbles in the candy. The majority of the resultant carbon dioxide bubbles are between in diameter. When the pressure on the cooled and solidified candy is released, it shatters into pieces that vary in size.

==Urban legend==
Rumors persisted that eating Pop Rocks and drinking soda would cause a person&#x27;s stomach to boil and explode. This was, in part, caused by the false assumption that Pop Rocks contain an acid/base mixture (such as baking soda and vinegar) which produces large volumes of gas when mixed through chewing and saliva. One of these myths involved child actor John Gilchrist (playing the character Little Mikey in 1970s Life cereal television commercials), who was falsely rumored to have died after consuming excess amounts of Pop Rocks and Coca-Cola. 

Though the confection had been extensively tested and found safe, the carbonated candy still alarmed residents in Seattle. The Food and Drug Administration set up a hotline there to assure anxious parents that the fizzing candy would not cause their children to choke. General Foods was battling the &quot;exploding kid&quot; rumors as early as 1979. General Foods sent letters to school principals, created an open letter to parents, took out advertisements in major publications and sent the confection&#x27;s inventor on the road to explain that a Pop Rocks package contains less gas (namely, carbon dioxide, the same gas used in all carbonated beverages) than half a can of soda.

The story has appeared in many other forms of media and fiction. On the very first episode of &quot;MythBusters&quot;, Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman put the Mikey rumor to the test by mixing six packs of Pop Rocks and a six-pack of cola inside a pig&#x27;s stomach, complete with enough hydrochloric acid to simulate the acid inside a human stomach. Despite the pig stomach growing to three times its initial size, it did not blow up even after time was allotted for digestion. In another stomach used as an experimental counterpart, only a large amount of sodium bicarbonate along with acid and soda (and without any Pop Rocks) was able to cause a gastric rupture. The broadcast included interview clips with Pop Rocks Inc. vice president Fernando Arguis explaining the candy and the myth, and Savage later alluded to the myth at a presentation at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute by showing that Pop Rocks and soda—albeit in a smaller amount—in his own stomach was not fatal.

<text>A pit latrine, also known as pit toilet, is a type of toilet that collects human waste in a hole in the ground. Urine and feces enter the pit through a drop hole in the floor, which might be connected to a toilet seat or squatting pan for user comfort. Pit latrines can be built to function without water (dry toilet) or they can have a water seal (pour-flush pit latrine). When properly built and maintained, pit latrines can decrease the spread of disease by reducing the amount of human feces in the environment from open defecation. This decreases the transfer of pathogens between feces and food by flies. These pathogens are major causes of infectious diarrhea and intestinal worm infections. Infectious diarrhea resulted in about 700,000 deaths in children under five years old in 2011 and 250 million lost school days. Pit latrines are a low-cost method of separating feces from people.
A pit latrine generally consists of three major parts: a hole in the ground, a concrete slab or floor with a small hole, and a shelter. The shelter is also called an outhouse. The pit is typically at least deep and across. The hole in the slab should not be larger than to prevent children falling in. Light should be prevented from entering the pit to reduce access by flies. This may require the use of a lid to cover the hole in the floor when not in use. The World Health Organization recommends that pits be built a reasonable distance from the house, ideally balancing easy access against smell. The distance from water wells and surface water should be at least to decrease the risk of groundwater pollution. When the pit fills to within of the top, it should be either emptied or a new pit constructed and the shelter moved or re-built at the new location. Fecal sludge management involves emptying pits as well as transporting, treating and using the collected fecal sludge. If this is not carried out properly, water pollution and public health risks can occur.
A basic pit latrine can be improved in a number of ways. One includes adding a ventilation pipe from the pit to above the structure. This improves airflow and decreases the smell of the toilet. It also can reduce flies when the top of the pipe is covered with mesh (usually made out of fiberglass). In these types of toilets a lid need not be used to cover the hole in the floor. Other possible improvements include a floor constructed so fluid drains into the hole and a reinforcement of the upper part of the pit with bricks, blocks, or cement rings to improve stability. In developing countries the cost of a simple pit toilet is typically between US$25 and $60. Recurring expenditure costs are between US$1.5 and $4 per person per year for a traditional pit latrine, and up to three times higher for a pour flush pit latrine (without the costs of emptying). 
As of 2013 pit latrines are used by an estimated 1.77 billion people, mostly in developing countries. About 892 million people (12 percent of the global population) practiced open defecation in 2016, mostly because they have no toilets. Southern Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa have the lowest access to toilets. The Indian government has been running a campaign called &quot;Swachh Bharat Abhiyan&quot; (Clean India Mission in English) since 2014 in order to eliminate open defecation by convincing people in rural areas to purchase, construct and use toilets, mainly pit latrines. As a result, sanitation coverage in India has increased from just 39% in October 2014 to almost 98% in 2019. It is estimated that 85 million pit latrines have been built due to that campaign as of 2018. Another example from India is the &quot;No Toilet, No Bride&quot; campaign which promotes toilet uptake by encouraging women to refuse to marry men who do not own a toilet.
== Definitions ==
Depending on the region, the term &quot;pit latrine&quot; may be used to denote a toilet that has a squatting pan with a water seal or siphon (more accurately termed a pour-flush pit latrine – very common in South East Asia for example) or simply a hole in the ground without a water seal (also called a simple pit latrine) – the common type in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Whilst a dry toilet can be with or without urine diversion, a pit latrine is almost always without urine diversion. The key characteristic of a pit latrine is the use of a pit, which infiltrates liquids into the ground and acts as a device for storage and very limited treatment.

Pit latrines are sometimes also referred to as &quot;dry toilets&quot;. However, some pit latrines do use water for flushing and are therefore not a &quot;dry toilet&quot;. Dry toilets is an overarching term used for several types of toilets, and only refers to the type of user interface, not the storage or treatment part.

=== Improved or unimproved sanitation ===
A pit latrine may or may not count towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) target of increasing access to sanitation for the world&#x27;s population, depending on the type of pit latrine: A pit latrine without a slab is regarded as unimproved sanitation and does not count towards the target. A pit latrine with a slab, a ventilated improved pit latrine and a pour flush pit latrine connected to a pit or septic tank are counted as being &quot;improved sanitation&quot; facilities as they are more likely to hygienically separate human excreta from human contact.

== Design considerations ==

=== Size of the drop hole ===
The user positions themself over the small drop hole during use. The size of the feces drop hole in the floor or slab should not be larger than to prevent children falling in. Light should be prevented from entering the pit to reduce access by flies.

=== Lids on the drop hole or toilet seat ===
A lid on the drop hole keeps light out of the pit and helps to stop flies and odors entering the toilet&#x27;s superstructure. The lid can be made from plastic or wood and is used to cover the hole in the floor when the pit latrine is not in use. In practice, such a lid is not commonly used for squatting type pit latrines but only for sitting type pit latrines with a toilet seat.

=== Squatting pan or toilet seat ===
On top of the drop hole there can either be nothing (this is the simplest form of a pit latrine) or there can be a squatting pan, seat (pedestal) or bench which can be made of concrete, ceramic, plastic or wood.

=== Shelter ===
A shelter, shed, small building or &quot;super-structure&quot; houses the squatting pan or toilet seat and provides privacy and protection from the weather for the user. Ideally, the shelter or small building should have handwashing facilities available inside or on the outside (e.g. supplied with water from a rainwater harvesting tank on the roof of the shelter) although this is rarely the case in practice. In the shelter, anal cleansing materials (e.g. toilet paper) and a solid waste bin should also be available. A more substantial structure may also be built, commonly known as an outhouse.

=== Locating the pit ===
Liquids leach from the pit and pass the unsaturated soil zone (which is not completely filled with water). Subsequently, these liquids from the pit enter the groundwater where they may lead to groundwater pollution. This is a problem if a nearby water well is used to supply groundwater for drinking water purposes. During the passage in the soil, pathogens can die off or be absorbed significantly, mostly depending on the travel time between the pit and the well. Most, but not all pathogens die within 50 days of travel through the subsurface.

The degree of pathogen removal strongly varies with soil type, aquifer type, distance and other environmental factors. For this reason, it is difficult to estimate the safe distance between a pit and a water source – a problem that also applies to septic tanks. Detailed guidelines have been developed to estimate safe distances to protect groundwater sources from pollution from on-site sanitation. However, these are mostly ignored by those building pit latrines. In addition to that, household plots are of a limited size and therefore pit latrines are often built much closer to groundwater wells than what can be regarded as safe. This results in groundwater pollution and household members falling sick when using this groundwater as a source of drinking water.

As a very general guideline it is recommended that the bottom of the pit should be at least 2 metres (6 feet) above groundwater level, and a minimum horizontal distance of 30 metres (98 feet) between a pit and a water source is normally recommended to limit exposure to microbial contamination. However, no general statement should be made regarding the minimum lateral separation distances required to prevent contamination of a well from a pit latrine. For example, even 50 metres (164 feet) of lateral separation distance might not be sufficient in a strongly karstified system with a downgradient supply well or spring, while 10 metres (32 feet) of lateral separation distance is completely sufficient if there is a well developed clay cover layer and the annular space of the groundwater well is well sealed.

If the local hydrogeological conditions (which can vary within a space of a few square kilometres; a square mile or two) are ignored, pit latrines can cause significant public health risks via contaminated groundwater. In addition to the issue of pathogens, there is also the issue of nitrate pollution in groundwater from pit latrines. Elevated nitrate levels in drinking water from private wells is thought to have caused cases of blue baby syndrome in children in rural areas of Romania and Bulgaria in Eastern Europe.

=== Pit lining ===

==== Partial ====


A &quot;partially lined&quot; pit latrine is one where the upper part of the hole in the ground is lined. Pit lining materials can include brick, rot-resistant timber, concrete, stones, or mortar plastered onto the soil. This partial lining is recommended for those pit latrine used by a great number of people – such as a public restroom in rural areas, or in a woodland park or busy lay-by, rest stop or other similarly busy location – or where the soils are unstable in order to increase permanence and allow emptying of the pit without it collapsing easily. The bottom of the pit should remain unlined to allow for the infiltration of liquids out of the pit.

==== Fully ====
A fully lined pit latrine has concrete lining also at the base so that no liquids infiltrate into the ground. One could argue that this is no longer a &quot;pit&quot; latrine in the stricter sense. The advantage is that no groundwater contamination can occur. The major disadvantage is that a fully lined pit latrine fills up very fast (as the urine cannot escape the pit) which results in high costs to empty and maintain the latrine. Increased odour can also be an issue as the pit content is much wetter and emits more odour. This type of pit latrine is used only in special circumstances, e.g. in denser settlements where groundwater protection is paramount.

=== Appropriateness ===
Pit latrines are often built in developing countries even in situations where they are not recommended. These situations include areas which are prone to flooding, unstable or rocky soil and high groundwater levels. There is also the disadvantage that pit latrines have to be outdoors which creates security issues at night. 

In conditions where pit latrines are not suitable, the installations of other types of toilets can be considered, e.g. the urine-diverting dry toilet (UDDT).

== Types ==
Pit latrines collect human feces in a hole in the ground. The principle of a pit latrine is that all liquids that enter the pitin particular urine and water used for anal cleansingseep into the ground (the only exception are fully lined pit latrines, see below).

=== Ventilated improved pit ===
The ventilated improved pit latrine (VIP) is a pit latrine with a black pipe (vent pipe) fitted to the pit and a screen (flyscreen) at the top outlet of the pipe. VIP latrines are an improvement to overcome the disadvantages of simple pit latrines, e.g. fly and mosquito nuisance and unpleasant odors. The smell is carried upwards by the chimney effect and flies are prevented from leaving the pit and spreading disease. Despite their simplicity, well-designed single VIPs can be completely smell free, and more pleasant to use than some other water-based technologies. Flies that hatch in the pit are attracted to the light at the top of the ventilation pipe. When they fly towards the light and try to escape, they are trapped by the flyscreen and die. The ventilation also allows odours to escape and minimizes the attraction for flies.

To ensure that there is a flow of air through the latrine, there must be adequate ventilation of the superstructure. This is usually achieved by leaving openings above and below the door, or by constructing a spiral wall without a door.

Covering the feces with an absorbent decreases smell and discourages flies. These may include soil, sawdust, ash, or lime, among others. In developing countries, the use of absorbents in pit toilets is not commonly practiced.

The vent pipe should have an internal diameter of at least 110 mm (4¼&quot;) and reach more than 300 mm (12&quot;) above the highest point of the toilet superstructure. Typically, the pit is at least 3 metres (10&#x27;) deep and 1 to 1.5 metres (3&#x27; to 5&#x27;) in diameter, depending on the number of users. Deep pits can last up to 20 or more years.

As liquid leaches from the pit and migrates through the unsaturated soil matrix, pathogenic germs are sorbed to the soil surface. In this way, pathogens can be removed prior to contact with groundwater. The degree of removal varies with soil type, distance travelled, moisture and other environmental factors and, thus, it is difficult to estimate the distance necessary between a pit and a water source. A minimum horizontal distance of 30 metres (100&#x27;) between a pit and a water source and 2 metres (6&#x27;) between the bottom of the pit and the groundwater table is normally recommended to limit exposure to microbial contamination.

=== Twin pit designs ===

A further improvement is the use of a second pit which is used in alternation with the first pit. It means that the first pit can rest for the duration of time it takes to fill up the second pit. When the second pit is also full, then the first pit is emptied. The fecal sludge collected in that first pit has in the meantime undergone some degree of pathogen reduction although this is unlikely to be complete. This is a common design for so-called twin-pit pour flush toilets and increases the safety for those having to enter the pit. Also VIP latrines are sometimes built with two pits, although for VIP toilets one problem can be that the users may not stick to this alternation method and fill up both pits at the same time.

The pits are of an adequate size to accommodate a volume of waste generated over one or two years. This allows the contents of the full pit enough time to transform into a partially sanitized, soil-like material that can be manually excavated. Twin pits are constructed 1 metre (3&#x27;) apart from each other to minimize cross-contamination between the maturing pit and the one in use. Also pits are constructed over 1 metre (3&#x27;) from any structural foundation as leachate can negatively impact structural supports. Water within the pit can impact its stability. Therefore, the full depth of the pit walls are lined to prevent collapse and the top 30 cm (12&quot;) are fully mortared to prevent direct infiltration and to support the superstructure.

There is a risk of groundwater pollution when pits are located in areas with a high or variable water table, and/or fissures or cracks in the bedrock. As soil and groundwater properties are often unknown, it is difficult to estimate the distance necessary between a pit and a water source. It is normally recommended to have a minimum horizontal distance of 30 metres (yards) between them to limit exposing the water source to microbial contamination. To ensure that only one of the two pits is used at any time, the idle pipe of the junction connecting to the out-of-use pit is closed (e.g. with cement or bricks).

Twin pit toilets are commonly used in rural India. the Government&#x27;s Swachh bharat Mission primarily used twin pit toilets since they were easier and safer to remove and clean. Once removed the waste is used as manure to grow crops 

=== Pour-flush pit latrine ===
In a pour-flush pit latrine, a squatting or pedestal toilet with a water seal (U-trap or siphon) is used over one or two offset pits. These types of toilets do require water for flushing but otherwise share many of the same characteristics as simple pit latrines. One to three liters (quarts) of water is used per flush, and they often have two pits that are used one after the other (&quot;twin pit pour flush pit latrine&quot;). For this reason they are subsumed under the term &quot;pit latrine&quot;. The fecal sludge that is removed from the full pits of twin-pit pour-flush pit latrines is somewhat safer to handle and reuse than the fecal sludge from single pit pour-flush latrines. However, significant health risks for the workers who are emptying the pits remain in either case.
An alternative to U-trap or siphon designs is to incorporate a counter-weighted trap door mechanism that provides an air-tight water seal in the closed position. The addition of a small amount of water (generally less than 500 ml; 1 pint) overcomes the counterweight and allows the fecal matter to enter the pit. The devices are sold under the name of &quot;SaTo pan&quot; for as little as US$1.85, and more than 800,000 of them have been installed worldwide since their introduction in 2013.

=== Cat hole ===
A cat hole is a one-time-use pit toilet often utilized by campers, hikers and other outdoor recreationalists. Also referred to as the &quot;cat method,&quot; it is formed by simply digging a hole in the ground just large enough to hold the feces from one defecation event. After use, the hole is refilled with the soil that was dug out.

== Maintenance ==


The requirements for safe pit emptying and fecal sludge management are often forgotten by those building pit latrines, as the pit will only fill up in a few years time. However, in many developing countries safe fecal sludge management practices are lacking and causing public health risks as well as environmental pollution.

=== Pit emptying ===

When the pit is full, the toilet is no longer usable. The time it takes to fill the pit depends on its volume, the number of users, the soil permeability and groundwater level. It can typically take between one and ten years or even longer in some exceptional cases. At that point, the pit can be covered and abandoned, and a new pit latrine built if space on the property permits this. The new pit latrine may reuse the shelter (superstructure) if the shelter can be moved without collapsing. 

In peri-urban or urban areas, full pits are not abandoned but rather emptied by sanitation workers or the household members themselves so that the toilets can continue to be used at the same location after the emptying has taken place. The emptying can be done manually with shovels and buckets, with manually powered pumps or with motorized pumps mounted on a vacuum truck which carries a tank for storage. For the fecal sludge to be pumpable, water usually needs to be added to the pit and the content stirred up, which is messy and smelly. 

Procedures for safe emptying of fecal sludge from pit latrines is a priority for many developing countries where many new pit latrines have been built in rural areas in recent years, such as in Bangladesh.

Fecal sludge that has been removed from pits manually or with vacuum tankers is often dumped into the environment indiscriminately, leading to what has been called &quot;institutionalized open defecation&quot;.

=== Sludge management ===

The fecal sludge may be transported by road to a sewage treatment facility, or to be composted elsewhere. There are numerous licensed waste hauling companies providing such service in areas where it is needed in developed countries, although in developing countries such services are not well regulated and are often carried out by untrained, unskilled and unprotected informal workers.

When managed and treated correctly to achieve a high degree of pathogen kill, fecal sludge from pit latrines could be used as a fertilizer due to its high nitrogen, phosphorus and organic matter content. However, it is hard to ensure that this is done in a safe manner. The number of viable helminth eggs is commonly used as an indicator organism to make a statement about the pathogen load in a fecal sludge sample. Helminth eggs are very persistent to most treatment methods and are therefore a good indicator.

=== Pit additives ===
A range of commercial products are available which claim to help reduce the volume of feces in the pit and reduce odor and fly problems. They are collectively described as a pit additive and many of them are based on the concept of effective microorganisms. The intention is to add specific strains of microbes to aid the decomposition process – but their effectiveness is disputed and recent research found no effect in scientific test conditions.

Wood ash, leaves, soil, compost, or sawdust can be sprinkled on top of the feces to decrease the smell in the case of pit latrines without a water seal. This is however not common practice for users in developing countries. Users often do not expect a pit latrine to be odour free, and endure the smell.

== Advantages ==
Advantages of pit latrines may include:
* Can be built and repaired with locally available materials
* Low (but variable) capital costs depending on materials and pit depth
* Small land area required

Measures to improve access to safe water, sanitation and better hygiene, which includes the use of pit latrines instead of open defecation, is believed to be able to prevent nearly 90% of deaths due to infectious diarrhea.

== Disadvantages ==
Disadvantages of pit latrines may include:
* Flies and odours are normally noticeable to the users
* The toilet has to be outdoors with the associated security risks if the person is living in an insecure situation
* Low reduction in organic matter content and pathogens
* Possible contamination of groundwater with pathogens and nitrate
* Costs to empty the pits may be significant compared to capital costs
* Pit emptying is often done in a very unsafe manner
* Sludge (called fecal sludge) requires further treatment and/or appropriate discharge
* Pit latrines are often relocated or re-built after some years (when the pit is full and if the pit is not emptied) and thus need more space than urine-diverting dry toilets for example and people are less willing to invest in a high-quality super-structure as it will have to be dismantled at some point.

== Costs ==

=== Construction ===
In developing countries the construction cost for a simple pit toilet is between about . This cost figure has a wide range because the costs vary a lot depending on the type of soil, the depth and reinforcement of the pit, the superstructure that the user is willing to pay for, the type of toilet squatting pan or toilet seat chosen, the cost of labour, construction materials (in particular the cost of cement can differ a lot from one country to the next), the ventilation system and so forth.

Rather than looking only at the construction cost, the whole of life cost (or life-cycle cost) should be considered, as the regular emptying or re-building of pit latrines may add a significant expense to the households in the longer term.

In India, Japan&#x27;s LIXIL Group has supplied tens of thousands of twin pit toilet systems that costs $10 or less apiece (in 2018).

=== Recurrent expenditure ===
Recurring expenditure costs are between US$1.5 and $4 per person per year for a traditional pit latrine. This includes operational and minor expenditure, capital maintenance expenditure and expenditure on direct support but does not include pit emptying costs. The total recurrent expenditure for more &quot;upmarket&quot; pit latrines has been estimated to be $2.5–8.5 for a VIP-type pit latrine and $3.5–11.5 for a pour-flush pit latrine.

== Society and culture ==
===Names===

There are numerous colloquial names for pit latrines, such as &quot;long drop&quot;, &quot;dunny&quot;, &quot;privy&quot;.

=== User experiences ===
Pit latrines may or may not be an enjoyable experience to use. Problems may occur when the pit latrine is shared by too many people, is not cleaned daily and not emptied when the pit is full. In such cases, flies and odour can be a major nuisance. Also, pit latrines are usually dark places which are difficult to keep clean. Often, handwashing facilities are missing. For these reasons, shared pit latrines can be very uncomfortable to use in developing countries.

=== Alternative to open defecation ===
About 892 million people, or 12 percent of the global population, practised open defecation in 2016, mostly because they have no toilets. Southern Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa have the lowest access to toilets. Pit latrines are a low-cost toilet option that do not require expensive infrastructure. As such, many government agencies and NGOs promote the construction of pit latrines in rural areas (groundwater pollution can be an issue). 

The community-led total sanitation approach results in the spontaneous construction and sustained use of pit latrines rather than open defecation.

===India example===
The Indian government has been running the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Mission) since 2014 in order to eliminate open defecation and to convince people in rural areas to purchase, construct and use toilets, mainly pit latrines. This campaign is a combination of building new toilets and encouraging behavior change. It is estimated that 50 million additional pit latrines have been built due to that campaign between 2014 and 2017. 

Another example is the campaign that took place in Haryana with slogans such as &quot;No Toilet, No Bride&quot; or &quot;No loo, no &#x27;I do. This campaign promotes the construction of toilets (usually pour flush pit latrine toilets). In rural India, there are sometimes cultural preferences for open defecation and these may be difficult to overcome with unattractive toilet designs, such as pit latrines.

<doc id="1154751" wikidata="Q1179415" url="?curid=1154751" title="De Dion suspension">
<text>A de Dion axle is a form of non-independent automobile suspension. It is a considerable improvement over the swing axle, Hotchkiss drive, or live axle. Because it plays no part in transmitting power to the drive wheels, it is sometimes called a &quot;dead axle&quot;.

A powered de Dion suspension uses universal joints on both ends of its driveshafts (at the wheel hubs and at the differential), and a solid tubular beam to hold the opposite wheels in parallel. Unlike an anti-roll bar, a de Dion tube is not directly connected to the chassis, and is not intended to flex. In suspension geometry it is a beam axle suspension.

==History==
The de Dion axle was named after Comte Jules-Albert de Dion, founder of French automobile manufacturer De Dion-Bouton. The axle, however, was invented around 1894 by co-founder Charles Trépardoux, Georges Bouton&#x27;s brother-in-law, for use on the company&#x27;s steam tricycles.

=== Advantages and disadvantages ===
Advantages:
#Reduced unsprung weight compared to the Hotchkiss drive (live axle), since the differential and half-shafts are connected to the chassis.
#Unlike most fully independent suspension there are no camber changes on axle loading and unloading (or rebound). Fixing the camber of both wheels at 0° assists in obtaining good traction from wide tires and also tends to reduce wheel hop under high power operations compared to an independent suspension.
#The choice of shock absorbers and springs is made easier.
#The two wheels may be individually aligned, allowing for independent camber (vertical) and track (horizontal) alignment.

Disadvantages:
#A pair of CV or universal joints is required for each wheel, adding complexity, cost, and weight.
#If coil springs are used, then a lateral location link (usually either a Panhard rod or Watt&#x27;s linkage) is required, plus additional torque links on each side (five link suspension) or a combination of lower trailing links and an upper transverse wishbone. None of these additional links are required if leaf springs are used, but ride can be compromised due to the leaves having to do double duty as both locating links and springs. The torque links are not required if the setup uses inboard brakes, like in the Pegaso 1502, Rover P6, all Iso cars and Alfa Romeo type 116 (and derivatives), as the wheels do not transmit torque to the suspension.
#Sympathetic camber changes on opposite wheels are seen on single-wheel suspension compression, just as in a Hotchkiss drive or live axle. This is not important for operation on improved surfaces but is more critical for rough road or off-road use.

==Use in production cars==
===Older cars===
Alfa Romeo is probably the most famous adopter of this technology, using it on the Alfa Romeo Alfetta, GT, GTV, GTV6, Giulietta, Alfa 6, 90, 75/Milano, SZ/RZ. Other production vehicles using this suspension include the Lancia Aurelia (fourth series onwards) and Flaminia, first and second generation Prince Gloria, the original Mazda Cosmo, Volvo 300-series, Rover P6, Chrysler minivans (all wheel drive versions from 1991 to 2004), DAF 46, DAF 66, all Iso cars (Iso Rivolta IR 300, Iso Grifo, Iso Fidia, Iso Lele) and early Bizzarrini 5300 GT Stradas, some of the largest Opels, such as the Opel Diplomat &quot;B&quot; of 1969, all Aston Martins from 1967 to 1989, Ferrari 375 and 250TR, first generation Maserati Quattroporte, Bugatti Type 251, Mercedes-Benz W125 and W154 as well as Auto Union Type D.

===Recent vehicles===
The Smart Fortwo (and Smart Roadster before) micro-compact cars produced by Daimler AG, Mitsubishi i kei car produced by Mitsubishi Motors and the Caterham 7 (a development of the Lotus Seven after Lotus sold the design rights to Caterham Cars), are the only cars recently in production that use this arrangement, as well as the products of some kit car companies. A recent vehicle to use this suspension coupled with leaf springs was the Ford Ranger EV. The American-built MV-1 van by VPG, produced from 2010 to 2016, also used this suspension in the rear with leaf springs. 4WD variants of the Honda Fit and Honda HR-V subcompact SUV have been reported as using a de Dion style suspension; however, these vehicles actually have a twist-beam rear suspension, with the cross beam element located even further forward (and thus even more like a trailing arm and less like the beam axle of a de Dion) than the 2WD variants. The Mitsubishi Fuso eCanter uses a De Dion rear axle with leaf springs.
The 2024 Mercedes-Benz EQG (G580 EQ) also uses a De Dion type rear axle, with double universal joint driveshafts transferring drive propulsion from the electric motors and incorporating slip joints to equalize the length.

==Other notable uses==
Most models of the Kawasaki MULE line of utility vehicles feature a leaf-sprung de Dion rear suspension with a distinctively curved tube axle that clears the rear subframe to provide 50mm (2 inches) of wheel travel. Benefits include simplicity, durability, compactness and a relatively low liftover height for the cargo bed.

Walter Snow Fighter plow trucks produced by the Walter Truck Company of Long Island, New York throughout the mid 20th century used de Dion axles with portal gear hubs for both the front and the rear suspension, allowing the use of large differentials for durability without increasing unsprung weight or reducing ground clearance. Forged steel axles were used instead of tubes.

And Mowag Duro.

UC San Diego’s Formula SAE team, Triton Racing, has employed the use of de Dion rear suspension in their vehicles since 2015. They are one of the few teams in the competition to do so.

Ferrari also used this type of suspension on its 1976 F1 model 312T6, which had the peculiarity of mounting four wheels at the rear, two on each side and therefore only one axle.

<text>A ballroom or ballhall is a large room inside a building, the primary purpose of which is holding large formal parties called balls. Traditionally, most balls were held in private residences; many mansions and palaces, especially historic mansions and palaces, contain one or more ballrooms. In other large houses, a large room such as the main drawing room, long gallery, or hall may double as a ballroom, but, a good ballroom should have the right type of flooring, such as hardwood flooring or stone flooring (usually marble or stone).. For most styles of modern dance, a wooden sprung floor offers the best surface.

In later times the term ballroom has been used to describe nightclubs where customers dance, the Top Rank Suites in the United Kingdom for example were also often referred to as ballrooms. The phrase &quot;having a ball&quot; has grown to encompass many events where person(s) are having fun, not just dancing.

Ballrooms are generally quite large, and may have ceilings higher than other rooms in the same building. The large amount of space for dancing, as well as the highly formal tone of events have given rise to ballroom dancing. The largest balls are now nearly always held in public buildings, and many hotels have a ballroom. They are also designed large to help the sound of orchestras carry well throughout the whole room.

A special case is the annual Vienna Opera Ball, where, just for one night, the auditorium of the Vienna State Opera is turned into a large ballroom. On the eve of the event, the rows of seats are removed from the stalls, and a new floor, level with the stage, is built.

Sometimes ballrooms have stages in the front of the room where the host or a special guest can speak. That stage can also be used for instrumentalists and musical performers.

<doc id="1154762" wikidata="Q720609" url="?curid=1154762" title="Rowing at the Summer Olympics">
<text>Rowing has been part of the Summer Olympics since its debut in the 1900 Games. Rowing was on the program at the 1896 Summer Olympics but was cancelled due to bad weather. Only men were allowed to compete until the women&#x27;s events were introduced at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal which gave national federations the incentive to support women&#x27;s events and catalysed growth in women&#x27;s rowing. Lightweight rowing events (which have weight-limited crews) were introduced to the games in 1996. 
Qualifying for the rowing events is under the jurisdiction of the World Rowing Federation. World Rowing predates the modern Olympics and was the first international sport federation to join the modern Olympic movement.

==Summary==
==Events==
At the 2020 and 2024 Olympics, the following 14 events were contested for both men and women: Single sculls, Double sculls, Quadruple sculls, lightweight double sculls, Coxless pair, Coxless four, Eight.

The lightweight events were first threatened in 2002 when the Programme Commission of the IOC recommended that, outside combat sports (boxing and wrestling, but not fencing, shooting, and archery) and weightlifting, there should not be weight-category events. The 2024 Olympics were the last where lightweight rowing will be included.

Other non-Olympic boatclasses, which still compete in World Championships, are currently: men&#x27;s &amp; women&#x27;s lightweight single sculls, lightweight quadruple sculls and lightweight coxless pair.

=== Men&#x27;s events ===
=== Women&#x27;s events ===
==Race distances==
From 1912 to 2024, all men&#x27;s races have been over a 2000m course, except for London 1948, where the course was 1850m. In 2024, World Rowing announced that Rowing at the 2028 Olympics will take place over 1500 meters due to limitations of the Long Beach Marine Stadium. This would be shortest ever used for men&#x27;s Olympic rowing. 

Before 1912, it was raced over various distances: the course in Paris in 1900 was 1750m, in St. Louis in 1904 it was 3218m, and in London in 1908 it was 2414m. The 1908 and 1948 events were held over the Henley Royal Regatta course.

Women&#x27;s races were raced over 1000m until 1988, when they were changed to 2000m.

Early Games featured match races between two or three boats, until the modern six boat side-by-side format was first adopted at the 1936 Olympic Games. With the exception of the 1952 Olympic Games (races between four or five boats), it has been the standard since.

==Qualification==
There is a limited number of crews permitted to race, so World Rowing holds qualification events in order to determine who competes at the Olympic Games. At the Olympic Games, each National Olympic Committee can only have one boat per event.

The main qualification comes from the previous year&#x27;s World Rowing Championships. Other qualifying events are called &quot;Continental Qualification Regattas&quot;, of which four are held during the year preceding the games - Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Final (open to everyone else). Each year FISA issues details of how many crews qualify at each regatta.

At the World Championships, the top finishing boats guarantee a place for that country - the rowers in the crew can be changed before the games. At the qualification regattas, it is the crew that wins that qualifies for the Olympics, and if members of that crew race in the Olympics they must race in that event.

==Medal table==
The numbers below are after the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris.

<text>Koodiyattam (; IAST: kūṭiyāṭṭaṁ; ) is a traditional performing art form in the state of Kerala, India. It is a combination of ancient Sanskrit theatre with elements of &quot;Koothu&quot;, an ancient performing art from the Sangam era. It is officially recognised by UNESCO as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.

==Origin==

Koodiyattam, meaning &quot;combined acting&quot; in Malayalam, combines Sanskrit theatre performance with elements of koothu. It is traditionally performed in temple theatres known as &quot;koothambalams&quot;. It is the only surviving art form that uses drama from ancient Sanskrit theatre. It has a documented history of a thousand years in Kerala, but its origins are not known. Koodiyattam and Chakyar koothu were among the dramatized dance worship services in the temples of ancient India, particularly Kerala. Both koodiyattam and Chakyar koothu originated from the ancient art form koothu, which is mentioned several times in Sangam literature, and the epigraphs of the subsequent Pallava, Pandiyan, Chera, and Chola periods. Inscriptions related to koothu can be seen in temples at Tanjore, Tiruvidaimaruthur, Vedaranyam, Tiruvarur, and Omampuliyur. They were treated as an integral part of worship services, alongside the singing of Tevaram and Prabandam hymns.

Ancient kings are among those listed as authors of works for these services. There is evidence of these across the ancient subcontinent during the Chola and Pallava periods. A Pallava king called Rajasimha has been credited with authoring the play &quot;Kailasodharanam&quot; in Tamil, which has the topic of Ravana becoming subject to Siva&#x27;s anger and being subdued mercilessly for this.

It is believed that Kulasekhara Varma, a medieval king of the Chera Perumal dynasty, reformed koodiyattam, introducing the local language for Vidusaka and structuring the presentation of the play into well-defined units. He himself wrote two plays, &quot;Subhadradhananjayam&quot; and &quot;Tapatisamvarana&quot; and made arrangements for their presentation on stage with the help of a Brahmin friend (&quot;Thozhan&quot;). These plays are still performed. Apart from these, the plays traditionally presented include &quot;Ascaryacudamani&quot; of Saktibhadra, &quot;Kalyanasaugandhika&quot; of Nilakantha, &quot;Bhagavadajjuka&quot; of Bodhayana, &quot;Nagananda&quot; of Harsa, and many plays ascribed to Bhasa, including &quot;Abhiseka&quot; and &quot;Pratima&quot;.
== Instruments ==

Traditionally, the main musical instruments used in koodiyattam are the mizhavu, kuzhitalam, edakka, kurumkuzhal, and sankhu. The mizhavu, the most prominent of these, is a percussion instrument that is played by a person of the Ambalavas Nambiar caste, accompanied by Nangyaramma playing the kuzhithalam (a type of cymbal).

== Performance style ==

Traditionally, koodiyattam has been performed by Chakyars (a subcaste of Kerala Hindus) and by Nangyaramma (women of the Ambalavasi Nambiar caste). The name &quot;koodiyattam&quot;, meaning playing or performing together, is thought to refer to the presence of multiple actors on stage who act in rhythm with the beats of the mizhavu drummers. Alternatively, it may also be a reference to a common practice in Sanskrit drama where a single actor who has performed solo for several nights is joined by another.

The main actor is a Chakyar who performs the ritualistic koothu and koodiyattam inside the temple or in the koothambalam. Chakyar women, Illotammas, are not allowed to participate. Instead, the female roles are played by Nangyaramma. Koodiyattam performances are often lengthy and elaborate, ranging from 12 to 150 hours spread across several nights. A complete Koodiyattam performance consists of three parts. The first of these is the &quot;purappadu&quot; where an actor performs a verse along with the nritta aspect of dance. Following this is the &quot;nirvahanam&quot; where the actor, using abhinaya, presents the mood of the main character of the play. Then there is the &quot;nirvahanam&quot;, a retrospective, which takes the audience up to the point where the actual play begins. The final part of the performance is the &quot;koodiyattam&quot;, which is the play itself. While the first two parts are solo acts, koodiyattam can have as many characters as are required to perform on the stage.

The elders of the Chakyar community traditionally taught the artform to their youngsters. It was performed only by Chakyars until the 1950s. In 1955, Guru Mani Madhava Chakyar performed Kutiyattam outside the temple for the first time, for which he faced many problems from the hardline Chakyar community. In his own words:

In 1962, under the leadership of art and Sanskrit scholar V. Raghavan, Sanskrit Ranga of Madras invited Guru Mani Madhava Chakyar to perform koodiyattam in Chennai. Thus for the first time in history koodiyattam was performed outside Kerala. They presented over three nights koodiyattam scenes from the plays &quot;Abhiṣeka&quot;, &quot;Subhadrādhanañjaya&quot; and &quot;Nāgānda&quot;.

In the early 1960s Maria Christoffer Byrski, a Polish student doing research in Indian theatres at Banaras Hindu University, studied koodiyattam with Mani Madhava Chakyar and became the first non-Chakyar/nambiar to learn the art form. He stayed in Guru&#x27;s home at Killikkurussimangalam and studied in the traditional Gurukula way.

==Noted artists==

*Mani Madhava Chakyar
*Ammannur Madhava Chakyar, who in the 1980s became one of the first koodiyattam performers to present this art to an international audience.
*Moozhikkulam Kochukuttan Chakyar, who in 1981 became the first Residential Guru at Margi, an institution promoting traditional art forms of Kerala. He was a cousin of Ammannur Madhava Chakyar.
*Mani Damodara Chakyar, who is Mani Madhava Chakkiar&#x27;s disciple and nephew, is also a performer of traditional devotional koodiyattams.

== Decline ==
Koodiyattam traditionally was an exclusive art form performed in special venues called &quot;koothambalams&quot; in Hindu temples and access to these performances was restricted to only caste Hindus. Also, performances can take up to forty days to complete. The collapse of the feudal order in the nineteenth century in Kerala curtailed the patronage of koodiyattam artists, and they faced serious financial difficulties. Following a revival in the early twentieth century, Koodiyattam is once again facing a lack of funding, leading to a crisis in the profession. UNESCO has called for the creation of a network of koodiyattam institutions and gurukalams to promote the transmission of the art form to future generations and for the development of new audiences besides fostering greater academic research in it. Natanakairali in Irinjalakuda is one of the most prominent institutions in the field of koodiyattam revival. The Margi Theatre Group in Thiruvananthapuram is another organisation dedicated to the revival of kathakali and koodiyattom in Kerala. Also, Nepathya is an institution promoting koodiyattam and related art forms at Moozhikkulam. The Sangeet Natak Akademi, India&#x27;s National Academy for Music, Dance and Drama, has awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award, the highest award for performing artists, to kutiyattam artists like Kalamandalam Sivan Namboodiri (2007), Painkulam Raman Chakyar (2010) and Painkulam Damodara Chakyar (2012).

<text>Snailbeach is a village in Shropshire, England, located near Shrewsbury at . The population details taken at the 2011 census can be found under Worthen. The village was formerly home to a large lead mine.

==History==
===Early history===
A village was built for workers at the local lead mine – Snailbeach Mine, which reputedly dates back to Roman times. The mine has some of the best-preserved surface buildings of a lead mine left standing in Britain including a Cornish Engine House. It is managed by the Shropshire Mines Trust. Snailbeach Mine was the biggest lead mine in Shropshire and it is reputed to have yielded the greatest volume of lead per acre of any mine in Europe. Although the miners mainly extracted lead ore (galena) from the mine, smaller quantities of barytes, calcite, fluorspar, silver and zinc were also obtained.

===Late 20th century===
Underground mining ceased in Snailbeach in 1955. Since 1955 only some reworking of the spoil heaps for spar, to use as pebble dash on buildings, has occurred. Barytes from here was sent to the Windscale nuclear reactor to smother fuel cells after an accident. Locals carried on working the tips until the 1970s. Although some ore is said to have been left standing in the mine, it does not seem likely that the mine will reopen. The old miners were very thorough in their working and rarely left much ore for later generations. Once a mine has been allowed to flood and the machinery removed the cost of reopening the mine increases dramatically and the prospect usually becomes too expensive. Any large amounts of lead remaining in the area are likely to be below the Ritton Castle area. Unfortunately miners would probably have to dig at least 1,000 feet down before they reach the top of the lead deposits, if they could find them. This is too deep and too expensive so lead mining in Shropshire is unlikely to become a major industry ever again.

The Shropshire County Council, using government grants, did extensive work in the early 1990s to make some of the shallow workings safe for the villagers. At the same time, they acquired many of the surface buildings and preserved these or restored them from a semi-derelict condition. The white spoil tip on the northern edge of the village, which had been a local landmark, was landscaped and planted with trees as part of the mining reclamation works.

==Lead mine site==
The Shropshire Mines Trust manages the Snailbeach Countryside Site on behalf of Shropshire Council, which owns many of the mine buildings and much of the land and gives free access to visit the publicly-owned sites; guided tours can include such features otherwise not accessible.

==Village facilities==
Snailbeach contains a Church of England church, St Luke&#x27;s, a Methodist Chapel and cemetery, and, a village hall. The latter contains a circular war memorial tablet to the local men who died serving in the Second World War.

<doc id="1154798" wikidata="Q708338" url="?curid=1154798" title="Münchner Kindl">
<text>Münchner Kindl, meaning &quot;Munich child&quot; in the Bavarian dialect, is the name of the symbol on the coat of arms of the city of Munich.

==History==
This symbol has been the coat-of-arms of Munich since the 13th century. The figure portrayed was originally a monk (or friar) holding a Bible, but by the 16th century it evolved in different portrayals into the figure of a small child wearing a pointed hood, often shown holding a beer mug and a radish. It has been theorized that the name for the city of Munich (&quot;München&quot; in German) comes from the term or &quot;Cloister for Monks&quot; due to the Imperial Abbey of Tegernsee--a Benedictine Monastery near which the original town of Munich was built. 

The image in its different configurations has appeared on countless different objects, from atop the city hall in Munich to manhole covers and even beer steins. The gender of the figure has also changed over the years: from a clearly male, to a gender-neutral child, to a small girl. Nowadays when the kindl is portrayed by a person - for instance, as a mascot for Oktoberfest - it is usually enacted by a young woman.

<text>The Singapore Police Force (SPF) is the national and principal law enforcement agency responsible for the prevention of crime and law enforcement in the Republic of Singapore. It is the country&#x27;s lead agency against organised crime; human and weapons trafficking; cyber crime; as well as economic crimes that goes across domestic and international borders, but can be tasked to investigate any crime under the purview of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and is accountable to the Parliament of Singapore.

SPF&#x27;s main geographical area of responsibilities covers the entire country, consisting of five regions which are further divided into 55 planning areas. The organisation has various staff departments with specific focuses. These include the Airport Police Division (APD), which covers policing of Singapore&#x27;s main civilian airports of Changi and Seletar, or the Police Coast Guard (PCG), which protects and enforces areas under Singapore&#x27;s territorial waters and its ports.

Formerly known as the Republic of Singapore Police (RSP; ), the SPF is a uniformed organisation. The SPF has declared its mission and vision as to &quot;prevent, deter and detect crime to ensure the safety and security of Singapore&quot;. It is Singapore&#x27;s point of contact for foreign agencies such as Interpol and other international law enforcement agencies. The organisational structure of the SPF is split between staff and line functions, which is roughly modelled after the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF).

The SPF currently consists of sixteen staff departments, four specialist staff departments, eighteen specialist and line units as well as seven land divisions. Its headquarters are located at one of the blocks of the New Phoenix Park building in the Novena district, which is located directly adjacent to a twin block occupied by the MHA. Situated within the headquarters are the Police Heritage Centre (PHC), which is open to the public and showcases the SPF&#x27;s history through its various exhibits and multimedia displays.

As of 2023, the SPF has a strength of approximately 11,500 personnel: 10,400 sworn officers and 1,100 civilian staff. The SPF has generally been credited as being the forefront in keeping crime in Singapore low, as well as being relatively transparent in its policing. Accordingly, Singapore has been considered as being one of least corrupt and safest countries in the world. The SPF also works closely with the Internal Security Department (ISD) and the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB). As of 2022, the current Minister of Home Affairs is K Shanmugam, while the current commissioner of the SPF is Hoong Wee Teck.

==History==

===Early years===
The Singapore Police Force was founded in 1820, starting with just 11 men under the command of Francis James Bernard, the son-in-law of William Farquhar. With no background nor knowledge on policing, Bernard had to work from scratch, as well as occasionally turning to Farquhar for help. In addition, he held multiple roles as magistrate, chief jailer, harbour master, marine storekeeper, as well as personal assistants to Farquhar. Farquhar informed Raffles that he had provisionally introduced licences for opium and alcohol sales that would raise $650 per month, with $300 of this sum being used to run a small police department.

As the department took form, Bernard became in charge of a writer, one jailor, one &quot;jemadar&quot; (sergeant) and eight &quot;peada&quot; (constables) by May 1820. Raffles approved these arrangements by August 1820 and cemented the formal establishment of a police force in Singapore. Manpower constraints meant that the men had to perform a wide range of roles, and required the help of headmen among the various ethnic communities to maintain orderliness on the streets.

Many laws that were enacted during this time remains in force today. These include the passing of Singapore&#x27;s first arms law in March 1823, which heavily restricts the ability to bear arms. Nearly two centuries later, these anti-arms laws continue to be strictly enforced, resulting in a society relatively free from firearms-related criminal offences.

===1965–present===
The SPF remains the sole policing force in Singapore after its independence. The country has one of the lowest murder rates in the world, as well as the lowest firearm-related death rates. The major crimes that tend to affect the Singaporean populace in the 21st century are usually cybercrimes, such as scams that are often based overseas. In 2020, cybercrimes made up almost half of all crimes in Singapore.

==Organisational structure==
===Leadership===
===Staff departments===
===Specialist staff departments===
===Specialist and land units===
Land divisions are given designations according to the NATO phonetic alphabet.

Defunct land divisions include:
* Toa Payoh Police Division (&#x27;B&#x27; Division), merged with Tanglin Police Division
* Geylang Police Division (&#x27;C&#x27; Division), merged with Bedok Police Division

==Finances==
The Singapore Police Force receives the highest budget allocation annually as compared to the various departments of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), typically accounting for about 50% of its annual budget. For the fiscal year of 2013 (for the year beginning 1 April 2013), S$3.89 billion was budgeted to the MHA, of which 47.8% or S$1.86 billion was allocated for the Police Programme. Actual expenses in the 2013 fiscal year were S$2.04 billion, of which S$1.88 billion was spent on operating expenditure (against the budgeted S$1.79 billion) and S$159.1 million on development expenditure (budgeted at $71.83 million). Manpower costs amounting to S$1.16 billion continue to dominate the SPF&#x27;s expenditure, accounting for 61.7% of its operating expenditure and 56.9% of total expenditure in FY2013.

The latest budget for fiscal year 2015, S$2.47 billion was allocated to the Police Programme, or 49.5% of MHA&#x27;s total budget of S$5 billion (the Ministry of Defence, in comparison, received a S$13.12 billion budget allocation). This includes S$2.26 billion for Operating Expenditure and $210.93 million for Development Expenditure. The main Development Expenditures expected in FY2015 included the construction of new buildings such as the Woodlands Police Divisional HQ as well as the acquisition of new patrol craft for the Police Coast Guard and the installation of police cameras at more HDB blocks and multi-storey car parks.

==Manpower==
, the total strength of the force stands at 43,600. Manpower trends in recent years are as follows:

===Regulars===
Regulars, or uniformed, full-time officers, constitute about 20% of the police&#x27;s total workforce and number approximately 9,000 in strength. Basic entry requirements for police officers include normal fitness levels, good eyesight, and at least five passes in the GCE Ordinary level or a NITEC from the Institute of Technical Education, although those with lower qualifications may still be considered. Those joining the senior police officers require a basic degree from a recognised university. Alternatively, police officers from the junior ranks may also be considered for promotion into the senior ranks. Officers serving in the force as national servicemen are also regularly considered for absorption into the regular scheme. Basic training for all officers are conducted at the Home Team Academy, under the purview of the Police Training Command. It takes about six months and nine months to train a new police officer and senior police officer respectively.

As is the case with many other civil service positions in Singapore, the salaries of police officers are reviewed in accordance to market rates. Salaries are kept competitive as part of anti-corruption measures. Gross starting salaries for police officers may range from S$1,820 to S$2,480, and that of senior police officers from S$3,400 to S$4,770, depending on entry qualifications, relevant/useful work experiences and National Service.

Police officers commence their careers as Sergeants (Full GCE &#x27;A&#x27; level or Diploma holders), while senior police officers start as Inspectors (bachelor&#x27;s degree). Reviews of an officer&#x27;s performance for promotion consideration are conducted annually.

===Police National Servicemen (PNS)===
When full-time National Service (NS) was first introduced in Singapore in 1967, it was initially solely aimed and geared towards the building-up of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF). Meanwhile, in Singapore Police Force, NS was not extended to that of compulsory full-time service, with police NS being only part-time, unlike that of the SAF. There was little urgency and pressure for the police force to increase its overall manpower-strength until the Laju incident of 1974, Singapore&#x27;s first encounter with international terrorism, demonstrated the need for additionally trained reserve-officers who could be called up at short-notice in the event of a national crisis or a major and serious public emergency. Singapore&#x27;s full-time National Service policy was thus extended to the Singapore Police Force in 1975, which stemmed from the then-primary aim of guarding and protecting key and vital public installations, such as sensitive ones like power substations and petrochemical industries, and to act as a swift-response reserve unit. Subsequent expansion of this NS scheme, along with changing security needs and requirements and the trend in outsourcing key-installation protection (such as to the various local auxiliary police forces) has expanded the role of police national servicemen to more varied functions, which may range from mainstream administration and operations (such as the role of Staff Assistants (SAs) based in offices), to basic police investigation (like the Ground Response Force (GRF) of the SPF&#x27;s Land Divisions) and front line policing (as seen in the Police Coast Guard), alongside their regular counterparts.

===Volunteers===

Formed in 1946, The Volunteer Special Constabulary (VSC) is an important component of the Singapore Police Force, contributing more than fifty years of volunteer service to the nation.

The VSC is composed of volunteers from all walks of life in Singapore, from businessmen to blue-collar executives to even bus captains, bonded with the same aspiration to serve the nation by complementing the Singapore Police Force. They are vested with equal powers of a police officer to enforce law and order in Singapore. VSC Officers don the same police uniform and patrol the streets, participate in anti-drug operations and sometimes even high-speed sea chases.

Previously headquartered at the Eu Tong Sen Street Police Station and Toa Payoh Police Station, it relocated to the new Police Cantonment Complex in the year 2000.

===Civilian staff===
Civilian staff in the Police Force are deployed in areas such as technology, logistics, human resource, and administrative and financial services as well as investigation, planning and intelligence.
The civilian staff schemes fall under the general civil service schemes managed by the Public Service Division. These schemes include:
* Commercial Affairs Officer (CAO) Scheme for Accountancy, Law, Business Administration, Business or Economics degree holders
** Commercial Affairs Officer
* Home Team Specialist (HTS) Scheme for degree and diploma holders
** Home Team Specialist
* Home Affairs Senior Executive (HASE) Scheme for degree holders
** Management Executive (MX)
* Management Support Scheme for diploma holders and below
** Management Support Officer (MSO)
** Corporate Support Officer (CSO)
* Technical Support Scheme for diploma holders and below
** Technical Support Officer (TSO)

The civilisation of non-core police functions has accelerated over the years in order to free up additional manpower for redeployment into Police Divisions. Other changes include the deployment of contract staff through organisations such as Ministry of Finance&#x27;s VITAL.org for administrative staff and partners such as ST Engineering and Cyber Security Agency for technical support.

===Staff welfare===
* Aquatic Club
* Home United Basketball Club (HUBC)
* Home United Football Club (HUFC)
* JOM – Clubhouse for Police Officers
* Polwel Co-operative Society Limited
* Police Sports Association (PSA)
* Police Welfare Division
* Senior Police Officers&#x27; Mess (SPOM)
* Singapore Police Co-operative Society Limited

==Uniforms==
Dark blue is the organisational colour of the Singapore Police Force and has remained so continuously since 1969. Derivatives of the standard blue uniform (collectively called the No. 3 uniform) was adopted for specialised forces and for all officers in various occasions which calls for more formal or casual attire.
The Traffic Police Department adopted a short-sleeved white tunic, dark blue breeches, a black leather Sam Browne belt, and riding boots for its officers performing mobile squad duties. A white crash helmet is worn when on the move, while a new dark blue jockey cap with chequered white and dark blue patterns around its circumference is worn when convenient while performing static duty. Members of the Vigilante Corps are also attired by a white short-sleeved top similar in design to the dark blue version for normal officers, gold-coloured buttons and badges, and a dark blue beret in place of the peaked cap.

Combat uniforms have also been adopted for specialist units such as those from the Special Operations Command and the Police Coast Guard (PCG), collectively known as the No. 4 uniforms. These involve the replacement of metal buttons with sewn-on plastic ones, the avoidance of all other metallic accruements which are deemed potentially hazardous to the officer or to others and the use of long-sleeved shirts.

The SPF introduced new uniforms made of 98% polyester and 2% spandex with better stretchable, perspiration absorption, and faster drying characteristics, as &quot;part of ongoing efforts to improve officers&#x27; operational effectiveness and support them in their work&quot;. The word &quot;police&quot; is embroidered above the name tag of the new uniforms and the metallic buttons replaced with concealed plastic buttons for better comfort to allow officers put on the body vests over their uniforms. Riveted buttons are also fixed on the shoulders to allow the attachment of a body worn camera.

==Ranks==
The following rank structure is used throughout the police force:
The rank of corporal (CPL) was abolished in 1972, but reinstated in 1976. In 1997, the location of all rank devices was shifted from the sleeves to the shoulder epaulets except for the Gurkha Contingent. Also in the same year, the station inspector rank insignia was changed from collar pips to a coat of arms of Singapore with upward-pointing chevrons above and an arc below, a design similar to that of the warrant officers of the Singapore Armed Forces, while the rank of senior station inspector (SSI) was also introduced. In 1998, the senior station inspector (2) (SSI(2)) rank was introduced, and changes were made to the SI, SSI, and SSI(2) rank designs. The rank of lance corporal was abolished in 2002. In 2006, the Gurkha Contingent adopted embroidered ranks as part of an overhaul of its combat dress, but are worn on the right chest pocket.

In July 2016, a revamped rank overhaul was done with the retirement of the ranks of staff sergeant, senior station inspector (1) and senior station inspector (2), as well as the abolishment of the separation line between junior officers and senior officers, to unify a unified rank-scheme. In addition, the sergeant rank has three different grades noted by a number from &quot;1&quot; to &quot;3&quot; placed in parentheses and suffixed to the rank abbreviation; namely, SGT(1), SGT(2), and SGT(3).

===Former ranks===
==Equipment==
===Weapons===
Police officers in the various divisions are armed when conducting regular uniformed patrols and plainclothes duties. Officers from different units are issued with different weapons.

The five-shot .38 Taurus Model 85 with 3-inch barrel featuring a laser sight by Crimson Trace is the standard issued sidearm of the Singapore Police Force with 10 rounds of ammunition. In 2015, the SPF purchased a number of CZ P-07 semi-automatic pistols. From 2016, selected officers were issued with the pistols as a trial. In 2019, it was announced that the Glock 19 was chosen as a replacement to the Taurus revolver. In addition to the use of the handguns, the police also use the Heckler &amp; Koch MP5 sub-machine gun and the Remington 870 shotgun.

Extendable batons were initially used by specialist units such as Security Command and Special Operations Command, however, it has since been used by officers from other front-line units, replacing the Monadnock PR-21 side-handle baton. Sabre Red pepper spray canisters are exclusively equipped to the officers of Police Coast Guard and Police Tactical Unit. A pair of handcuffs is issued to the officers as restraints.

The Taser X26E stun gun was procured in the late 2000s and is part of the officers&#x27; equipment, which provides another non-lethal means of subduing suspects. Despite safety concerns due to incidents experienced by foreign police forces, the weapon was deemed suitable for use by trained personnel, and was rolled out across other NPCs. In 2018, the Taser X26E was replaced with the X26P model.

===Vehicles===

Land division officers typically patrol and respond to calls in vehicles known as the Fast Response Car (FRC). Car models that have been used by the SPF include the Subaru Impreza TS 1.6.

In 2005, the SPF introduced the new Fast Response Vehicle (FRV), consisting of modified Toyota Hi-Lux sport utility vehicles with a back compartment to carry equipment.

In 2009, the SPF introduced Forward Command Vehicles. These were replaced in 2017 by Division Command Vehicles with greater mobility designed to enhance command, control and coordination. In addition, the SPF introduced new unmanned aerial vehicles with red and blue siren lights, a searchlight, a high-definition camera and an audio warning system. The UAVs are controlled by two-man teams (consisting of a pilot and a safety officer) and are designed to conduct search and rescue operations, attending public order incidents, traffic management, hostage situations and crowd monitoring.

Police from the Community Policing Units may also patrol in residential neighbourhoods on bicycles. At the 2007 Singapore National Day Parade, the Singapore Police Force unveiled a Tenix S600 APC (Armored Personnel Carrier) had been purchased for its operations for the Special Operations Command, and in NDP 2015, the Achleitner HMV Survivor and the Gurkha MPV by Terradyne Armored Vehicles Inc was unveiled.

==Dealing with offences committed by officers==
Police officers are governed by the Police Force Act (Chapter 235) and its Police Regulations (Chapter 235, Section 28 and 117) of the Singapore Statutes. The disciplinary offences can be found in its schedule. Misfeasance and malfeasance such as blue wall of silence, conduct prejudicial to good order and discipline, corruption, misconduct and malicious prosecution are referred to the Internal Affairs Office (IAO). The Attorney-General&#x27;s Chambers (AGC) can be consulted to advise the police on its disciplinary proceedings. Police officers can whistleblow their colleagues&#x27; official misconducts and wrongdoings by filing official police reports themselves to officially open investigation papers against other officers. Full-time police national servicemen are also subjected to the Police (Special Constabulary) Regulations (Chapter 235, Section 85).

SPF HQ spokesperson routinely issues official statements stating that its officers are not only expected to uphold the law, but also to maintain the highest standards of conduct and integrity. The spokesperson added that SPF deals severely with officers who break the law, including charging them in court. Also, SPF usually commence disciplinary proceedings against the officers involved, and as well as suspend them pending internal investigations.

===Notable cases===
In March 1976, one of Singapore&#x27;s top prominent senior lawyers, the late Subhas Anandan, was arrested by a corrupt policeman for suspected involvement in a secret society under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act. He was remanded without trial in a prison for a few months. Subhas was exonerated and acquitted in November of the same year, following an investigation probe by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau.

On 10 July 2013, ex-policeman Senior Staff Sergeant Iskandar Rahmat — a 14-year veteran award-winning investigation officer — killed a car workshop owner and the man&#x27;s son, and has since been on the death row from 2017 onward, after failing in his appeal and president clemency against the death sentence. The case was known as the Kovan double murders in Singapore media. On 5 February 2025, Iskandar was executed after his appeals to court &amp; clemency to the president unsuccessful.

On 21 July 2023, police sergeant Uvaraja Gopal committed suicide following workplace harassment and racial discrimination. He had a history of mentally unstable behaviour, leading to him being relieved of carrying firearms in February 2023. He was being investigated after allegedly assaulting his brother a few days prior, and a report was filed by his mother saying she feared for her safety. The case garnered national attention and outrage, with calls for an independent inquiry due to beliefs of a coverup.

==Media outreach efforts==
Through the Public Affairs Department, SPF has collaborated with the media industry to produce content that supports and promote the mission and brand of the organisation.

<text>Sandro Mario Corsaro is an American producer, animator, and author. He is the head of global creative &amp; content of Wayfair and the former SVP and CCO of Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango. He is the creator of the Disney XD animated series &quot;Kick Buttowski: Suburban Daredevil&quot;.

== Early life ==
Growing up in Stoneham, Massachusetts, Corsaro began showing interest in drawing at age 3 while attending St. John’s Preparatory School in Danvers, MA., and continued to pursue this passion throughout his adolescence. His father, Mario, owned a shoe store in the North End.

Like his show&#x27;s protagonist, Corsaro often performed downhill stunts via skateboards, bikes, and toboggans. However, a leg injury from one bike trick required him to be hospitalized at Lahey Hospital.

== Career ==
In 1999, he moved across to the West Coast to attend the University of Southern California, where he majored in both Fine Arts and Animation. While still in college, he worked as a production associate on &quot;The Iron Giant&quot;. After graduating, he was a development intern on &quot;Osmosis Jones&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shvorin/Correspondent&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

While working as an animator in 2002, Corsaro came up with his show&#x27;s titular protagonist, which he then named &quot;Kid Knievel.&quot; He allotted time, often at 4 A.M., to work an animated pitch introducing characters from the proposed show. His hometown of Stoneham inspired the fictional town in &quot;Kick Buttowski,&quot; evident from landmarks including the Stoneham library, the town square, and streets including Broadway, Main Street, Bear Hill Road, and Kenneth Terrace.

In 2006, his proficiency in Flash helped him become creative director of Disney Online.

After finishing the animated short, he hired an agent to help him pitch the cartoon to Disney. After 8 years of concept and pitching, with many rejections, it was officially picked up in 2010 and the protagonist&#x27;s name was changed from Kid Knievel to Kick Buttowski.

Corsaro has worked at numerous entertainment companies and is also an author. In his books, he shares his distinctive techniques for applying traditional animation principles in the digital environment. Sandro has spoken at Siggraph, NAB, Flashforward, and on G4. He also served as a consultant to Adobe.

In 2013, Corsaro became Chief Creative Executive at Fandango.

<doc id="1154811" wikidata="Q7109099" url="?curid=1154811" title="Ottan Thullal">
<text>Ottan Thullal (or &quot;Ottamthullal&quot;) is a recite-and-dance art-form of Kerala, India. It was introduced in the eighteenth century by Kunchan Nambiar, one of the Prachina Kavithrayam (three famous Malayalam-language poets). The folksy performance, often laced with humour intended at criticism of society, is accompanied by a mridangam (a barrel-shaped double-headed drum) and/or the handy idakka besides a pair of ilathalam cymbals.

== History ==

Like most Indian performing art forms, Ottamthullal has its principles influenced by the Natya Shastra (). The word &quot;Thullal&quot; means &quot;to jump&quot; or &quot;leap about&quot; in the Malayalam language.
Legend has it that Nambiar, the poet, fell asleep while playing the mizhavu drum for a Chakyar Koothu performance, inviting ridicule from the chakyar. In response, Nambiar developed Ottamthullal, which raised prevalent sociopolitical questions and made a satire of human pedigrees and prejudices. The chakyar complained about Nambiar&#x27;s production to the king of Chembakassery. The king banned performances of Ottamthullal from the Ambalapuzha temple complex. Closely related art forms are Seethankan thullal and Parayan thullal. Mathur Panikkar popularized Ottamthullal for modern audiences. Ottamthullal competitions are held and the art form may be used to spread a social message.

== Performers ==
In Ottamthullal, a solo performer, with green makeup and a colourful costume (decorated with a long red and white band and painted wooden ornaments), acts and dances while reciting dance &quot;(Thullal)&quot; (lyrics). A chorus or one or more artists repeats each sentence as it is completed. More recently, Ottamthullal has been performed with a solo female actor and with an ensemble cast.

== Theme ==
Nambiar parodies the ways of landlords and other prominent citizens, sometimes even the king. For example, the character of Bhima from the epic the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; is portrayed as an oaf. Higher castes including Brahmin are not spared.

== Language ==
Ottan thullal is performed in Malayalam, which pleases local audiences. Old sayings and elements of folklore are used.

== Works ==
There may be 64 or more Ottamthullal works. Examples include:
* &quot;Kallyana Sougandhikam&quot; (a rare flower), Bhima is searching for the flower and has a long conversation with his older brother, Hanuman.
* &quot;Kiratham,rukmini swayamvaram, keechakavadham,Garudagarva bhangam, Santhanagopalam, Ghoshayathra etc...&quot;

<text>Albano Laziale (;; ) is a &quot;comune&quot; (municipality) in the Metropolitan City of Rome Capital, on the Alban Hills, in the Italian region of Lazio. Rome is distant. It is bounded by other communes of Castel Gandolfo, Rocca di Papa, Ariccia and Ardea. Located in the &quot;Castelli Romani&quot; area of Lazio. It is sometimes known simply as Albano.

Albano is one of the most important municipalities of the Castelli Romani, and a busy commercial centre. It has been also a suburbicarian bishopric since the 5th century, a historic principality of the Savelli family, and from 1699 to 1798 the inalienable possession of the Holy See. It now houses, among other things, the Praetor of the district court of Velletri. The territory of Albano is partially included in the Parco Regionale dei &quot;Castelli Romani&quot;.

==Geography==

===Territory===

The territory of Albano Laziale is and one of the largest of Colli Albani; sixth after Velletri at , Lanuvio at , Rocca di Papa at , Rocca Priora at and Marino at . According to the classification given by the Geological Survey of Italy most of the territory is similar to other areas of the Colli Albani, from lands classified as v 2.

====Hydrography====
The main hydrographic feature is Lake Albano, whose full name is actually Lake Albano and Castel Gandolfo. In fact, most coastal lakes are relevant to the town of Castel Gandolfo, while the remainder are in the Albanense territory. The lake basin is run by the Metropolitan City of Rome.
Some small streams, often dry, start from the north:
*&quot;Fosso of Santa Palomba&quot;, originates from springs from the hills of the Colli Albani area of the old town, and flows westwards to the town of Santa Palomba, in the municipality of Rome and Pomezia.
* &quot;Fosso of Chancellor&quot;, originates from springs from the Chancellor resort, in Ariccia common, about above sea level, and continues to flow in a south-south-west to the Tyrrhenian Sea.
*&quot;Fosso di Valle Caia&quot;, originates from the Quarto Negroni, bordering with the municipality of Ariccia at of National Road 207 Nettunense and continues its path towards the Tyrrhenian Sea in the west.
* &quot;Fosso di Montagnano&quot;; originates from drain water that is collected in the local mountains, between the towns of Albano, Ariccia and Ardea, and continues to the arm for the west the Tyrrhenian Sea.

====Topography====

The highest peak of the town of Albano is the Colle dei Cappuccini, located at 615 m above sea level. From the hill, which houses a pine forest adjacent to the Capuchin Monastery, there is a remarkable overview of Lake Albano, Agro Romano and Monte Cavo.
The historic center of Albano has a maximum gradient of 11%, or 47 metres, 435, taking into consideration the distance between the Cathedral of San Pancrazio (384 m asl) and the St. Paul&#x27;s Church (431 m asl). Other altitudes through the center of town are Villa Altieri, at kilometre 25 of the State Road 7 Via Appia (363 m asl) and the Church of Stella (391 m asl).
The hill town of Castel Savelli is 280 m above sea level, while the underlying fraction of Pavona is built at 110 m above sea level. The village of Cecchina at the railway station is located at 212 m above sea level.

===Climate===
In terms of climate, the area falls within the domain of the temperate Mediterranean climate with mild winters, with temperatures higher than those autumnal spring, summer breezes. In the area of Colli Albani, so even at Albano, presents the phenomenon called TSUE, which is the reduction of water vapour in the clouds as the ground rises. So there will be more rainfall on the foothills of the hills, facing the sea, south southwest, and to the north. Albano, lying on the trajectory of the current wet Tyrrhenian, is fairly rainy with 900–1000 mm annual precipitation. The winds blow mainly from the south and west, more rarely from the north and east. Summer is hot and dry, with a mild and rainy winter with snow quite rarely and only in the presence of a marked generalised cold. In summer, temperatures can reach with peaks of in rare cases. The temperature never reached .

==Etymology==

The name Albano is still a source of debate. In Roman times, the territory of Latium was called Albanum: Albanum (Pompeians Domitiani, etc.).The estate of the wealthy Romans on the Colli Albani (Ager Albanus) and Castra Albana was the name of the camp built by Septimius Severus, within the confines of the fund Albanum previously owned by Domitian, to accommodate the Legio II Parthica. This place-name hypothesis is considered the most reliable as the root of these ties in Indo-European * alb / * alp indicating a high location, the Mons Albanus (now Monte Cavo) in this case, while it was the centre of worship and common pasture (compascuo). Other assumptions, however, considered valid are the Latin place-name adjective albus (&quot;white&quot;) or Greek αλαβα (&quot;ash&quot;). Etymologically proposed Albanum / Castra Albana is the same as being proposed for Alba Longa, whose location is not known with certainty, but placed in a medieval tradition of urban core areas of modern Albano Laziale . The second part of the Latium name of was used in 1873 to distinguish the city from Albano Sant&#x27;Alessandro (Bergamo), Albano Vercellese (Vercelli province) and Albano di Lucania (Potenza province).

==History==

===Ancient age ===
The first recorded evidence of human settlement in the town of Albano Laziale dates from the beginning of the first millennium BC with the remains of settlements of Tor Paluzzi, Castel Savelli and Colle dei Cappuccini. The human presence in these locations, is maintained even in later times, while from Laziale IIB period (830 BCE – 730 BCE) start to appear due to traces of the mythical foundation Latin capital of Alba Longa.
Most modern historians seems inclined to place the site of Alba Longa in between the towns of Marino, Rocca di Papa and Ariccia on the eastern side of Lake Albano, which is opposite to the present city of Albano.

Albano is located in the area in which, according to the legend, Aeneas&#x27;s son, Ascanius, founded Alba Longa. Today the coat of arms of Albano still sports the white (Latin: Alba) boar dreamed of by Ascanius before the founding of the city. Alba Longa was one of the main cities of the Latins and, again according to the legend, the birthplace of Romulus and Remus, the mythical founders of Rome.
Albanense in the territory, were then subjected to a large extent the wealthy of Aricia, which built several suburban villas built by the leading exponents of the Roman nobility. Pompey had a villa, the Albanum Pompeii, whose ruins have been found inside of the Villa Doria Pamphili. A villa belonging to the Seneca would be identified within the ruins found on the south ridge of Lake Albano, bordering the town of Ariccia. All of these residences, at the time of Emperor Domitian were combined into a single fund owned by the Emperor&#x27;s Albanum Cesaris, within which erected a monumental imperial residence, with the ruins mostly contained in the Villa Barberini at Castel Gandolfo. The Emperor Septimius Severus around 202 had installed in place of the old town of the Legio II Parthica. Thus were born the Castra Albana, which were huge camps that remained in operation until the end of 3rd century. Albano developed from this settlement, as is shown by the main streets, which still follow the ancient decumanus and cardo. Remains of the large baths built by Septimius&#x27; son, Caracalla, are still visible.

=== Middle Ages and early Modern era (476–1699)===

In 326, Emperor Constantine I, according to an established tradition, ordered the founding of the Albanense cathedral dedicated to St. John the Baptist. According to sources, Constantine donated to the newly formed cathedral, various sacred vessels and several estates and funds in Ager Albanus. During the Gothic War, Albano was reduced from municipium to oppidulum, a small fortified city.

In 964, Emperor Otto I conferred the investiture at Albano to Virginio Savelli, his captain in Rome. Pope Paschal II in 1118 took refuge in Albano as a hostile insurgency occupied Rome, and found that Albanensi loyalty be granted perpetual exemption from taxes of milling wheat.

During the schism of anti-pope Anacletus with Pope Innocent II in 1137 the anti-pope marched on Lazio Albano and other locations to extend its domain, but these territories were taken over by Innocent II. In the Year 1142, Albano was sacked by the Saracens.
After the Battle of Monte Porzio, in 1168, the Roman people thought it well to take revenge on Albano, who had sided with the city &#x27;s Emperor Frederick Barbarossa against Rome, and so the town was looted and razed. Given the state of abandonment, Pope Innocent III gave the monastery of St. Paul Outside the Walls the Palatium with the churches of Santa Maria Minor and St. Nicholas and their dependencies. In 1436 it was razed along with Castel Savelli by Cardinal Giovanni Maria Vitelleschi, by order of Pope Eugenius IV. In 1697 Albano switched to direct control of the Holy See.

===Feudal era (1699–1798)===
Pope Pius VI in 1780 began the rearrangement of the Via Appia, to achieve a fast link between Rome and Terracina, where there was intense work on the reclamation of the Pontine Marshes. The first route of the new &quot;National Road&quot; arrived to follow the Via Appia Antica, only to stray from the path along the ridge of ancient Vallericcia to arrive at Genzano, avoiding the sharp uphill to reach Ariccia. Only with the construction of the Ariccia bridge under the pontificates of Pope Gregory XVI and Pius IX (1839–1849) will outline the current route of State Road 7 Via Appia. The opening of the new route of the Via Appia undoubted benefited Albano and locations along its course.
During the first French occupation and the events tied to the French Revolution in the Papal States, on February 18, 1798, Albano, along with Frascati, Velletri and later Marino, proclaimed itself a &quot;sister republic&quot; to the nascent Roman Republic. Following the uprising the Albanensi rebelled against the French, Albano was occupied and looted by the troops of Murat. The following year, however, at Albano, installs Fra Diavolo, commanding Neapolitan column.

===Contemporary era (1798–1944)===

With the motu proprio of July 6, 1816, by Pope Pius VI elevated Albano back in the Papal States with the Restoration of the Government seat.

In 1870 Albano became part of the Kingdom of Italy. It became the seat of the district court, by merging the offices of Marino.

On February 1, 1944, during World War II, Allied bombing of Albano and Ariccia severely affected the city&#x27;s historic center, among targets hit were the cloistered convent of Poor Clares of Piazza Pia and structures of the Porta Pretoria Castra Albana.

On the morning of Sunday September 21, 2008 Pope Benedict XVI travelled to Albano on a pastoral visit, starting from the Pontifical Villas of Castel Gandolfo, with the opportunity to re-consecrate the Basilica Cathedral of St. Pancras after the restorations of 2008.

* Walls and gates. The fortification of the old town of Albano was now almost completely dismantled at the end of the 18th century for the enlargement of Via Appia. At the time of the Gothic War (535-554), Albano was an &quot;oppidulum&quot;, then a small fortified settlement. Presumably, the fortifications suffered the vicissitudes of the various destruction and subsequent rebuilding of the city. The complex was the originally fortified Savelli palace, dates back to the 13th century. Portals in the fortification retain much historical and ornamental significance:
**&quot;Porta Romana&quot; or &quot;Porta di San Rocco&quot; is situated on the Via Appia towards Rome, flanked by the Doria palace and the church of San Rocco, the final appearance was given in the 18th century. All ornaments, coats of arms and the plaque on the door are now in the atrium of Palazzo Savelli.

===Archaeological sites===
The Castra Albana contains one of the largest concentrations of Roman ruins outside Rome in the Castelli Romani. It consists basically of a few major monuments, dating in general to the time of Septimius Severus:

*&quot;Santuario di Santa Maria della Rotonda&quot;, built probably as a garden &quot;nympheum&quot; at the Villa of Domitian at Castel Gandolfo, was later incorporated in the complex of Castra Albana by Septimius Severus and eventually became, around the 7th century, a Christian shrine. Similar to the Pantheon of Rome but reduced in scale, it is now preserved after the restoration erased the Baroque changes.

Inside a picturesque medieval village, with the Church of San Pietro. During the Middle Ages, until the modern age, it was believed they were the remains of a fabulous palace of Ascanio. The old building was transformed into a stronghold in medieval times and later occupied by civilians.
*The Amphitheater of Albano is the only pattern found in the Castelli Romani belonging to or even pre-existing Castra Albana. It was the place of martyrdom for Christians, as might be inferred from two small Christian chapels, painted in the niches of vomitoria.

Albano&#x27;s economy is historically linked to wine production, active primary importance in an area such as the Alban Hills known for its wines since Roman times as the Castelli name of Albanum.

In 1995, at the Albano wholesale vegetable market sold 127,060 tons of vegetables (cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, potatoes, onions, pomdori and salads) and 1932 tons of domestically sourced from abroad. Also 326,957 tons artichokes were sold, while 84,747 tons of fresh fruits (apples, pears, peaches, grapes) and 14,831 tons were sold, and finally 43,073 tons citrus fruits were sold.

===Industry===
In 1995 the local units of industry in the town of Albano was 475, one of the ten most massive concentration of industrial activity in the southern quadrant of the Metropolitan City of Rome.
There are no mining of minerals in the territory Albanense, but in Roman times, peperino was mined and known as lapis Albanus, since this particular type of stone is found mainly on the shores of Lake Albano. Despite the historic city of Albano situated on a flow of lava stone, the extraction of this stone has never been a thriving, unlike what happened in neighbouring Ariccia and Marino.

Finally, companies that operate in the construction industry were 209: this sector given the large urban expansion in Albano in recent decades has been steadily growing, as demonstrated by the data on the licensing of builders.

===Services===
The town of Albano Laziale is historically subject to a difficult situation in terms of water supply: the lack of important sources of water has forced the municipality since the 17th century to use water from the nearby territories Ariccia and Nemi. In recent management of water supply was the responsibility of the municipality of Albano Laziale, who in 1994 made it known that on a global consumption of 137 litres of water per second, 102 were from wells located within the municipal area, 6 from source of Nemi and 29 by the water of the Consortium of Simbrivio the following year, water consumption had risen to 146 litres per second and the extraction wells was increased to 116 litres. Since 2008 the water service is managed by the municipal company of the City of Rome.

===Tourism===
Albano has considerable tourism potential, which have been stepped up in recent years, due to the archaeological Castra Albana, the natural beauty of the Colle dei Cappuccini and the shores of Lake Albano.

<text>Emperor Zhezong of Song (4 January 1077 – 23 February 1100), personal name Zhao Xu, was the seventh emperor of the Song dynasty of China. His original personal name was Zhao Yong but he changed it to &quot;Zhao Xu&quot; after his coronation. He reigned from 1085 until his death in 1100, and was succeeded by his younger half-brother, Emperor Huizong, because his son died prematurely.

Emperor Zhezong was the sixth son of Emperor Shenzong. He ascended the throne at the age of nine under the supervision of his grandmother, Grand Empress Dowager Gao.

== Reign ==
Emperor Zhezong lowered taxes, stopped negotiations with the Tangut-led Western Xia state, and resumed armed conflict which eventually forced Western Xia to enter a more peaceful stance with the Song Empire. However, Emperor Zhezong was unable to stop fighting between conservative members of his government and the more liberal members who supported Wang Anshi&#x27;s reforms and in fact, the fighting intensified during Emperor Zhezong&#x27;s reign. This split would eventually contribute to the Northern Song dynasty&#x27;s demise in the 12th century.
== Yuanyou era (1086-1093) ==
===Empress Gao&#x27;s regency===
Empress Gao may have engineered 8-year-old Zhezong&#x27;s enthronement to make herself regent. As regent, Empress Dowager Gao appointed conservatives such as Sima Guang as Chancellor, who halted the New Policies set forth by Wang Anshi before dying in 1086. The conservatives achieved some success in reversing the reforms.

Emperor Zhezong was powerless and it was not until Grand Empress Dowager Gao&#x27;s death in 1093 that the emperor was able to reinstate Wang Anshi&#x27;s reforms and reduce the late Sima Guang&#x27;s influence. By then, factionalism was a greater concern than the practicality of the reforms themselves; both the conservatives and the reformists engaged in infighting.

Cheng Yi, a founder of Neo-confucianism and one of Zhezong&#x27;s tutors, proposed that Li (principle) was an innate property that could provide moral guidance.

== Shaosheng era (1094-1098) ==
In 1094, Zhezong changed the era name to Shaosheng (紹聖), meaning &quot;continuing sagacity&quot;, to signify the continuation of Shenzong&#x27;s reforms (partly due to Zhezong&#x27;s sense of filial piety). He promptly named the reformist Zhang Dun as grand chancellor. The ensuing policy and personnel debates sharply polarized the bureaucracy. Zhang Dun systematically purged the conservatives and silenced dissent while maintaining a relatively pragmatic revival of the New Policies. The reformists took revenge for the earlier exile of their fellow partisan Cai Que to Lingnan by using the Korean Affairs Institute to exile many conservatives to the same area. Meanwhile, a blacklist of 37 conservatives barred them and their descendants from serving in the government.
===Personal philosophy===
Zhezong&#x27;s modifications to the imperial examinations required candidates to support a reformist stance. He argued that Empress Gao&#x27;s conservative restoration (which had repealed many of the New Policies) harmed the people and the government. Zhezong preferred the sages of antiquity (such as Yao and Shun) and rejected the Han dynasty and Tang dynasty models of governance.
===War against the Western Xia===
During the renewed war against the Western Xia, the Song military consolidated borders, constructed fortifications, and slowly took territory from the Xia. This successful strategy expanded the Song dynasty to its greatest territorial extent.

==Yuanfu era (1098-1100)==
On May 18, 1099, Zhezong became ill in which the symptoms were constant coughing and constipation. Zhezong did not get any better, even though he had taken many medications and so Zhezong asked his councilors to recommend physicians. Geng Yu, a physician, advised Zhezong and even though Zhezong followed his directions, there were no signs of him getting better.

In July, his constipation was replaced by severe diarrhea and Zhezong could not get up from his bed to receive medicine. Geng recommended spleen-warming pills, an action Zhezong&#x27;s mother supported.

The coolness of the weather improved Zhezong&#x27;s health; making him well enough to attend the celebration of his son Zhao Mao on August 8. But his illness returned so Zhezong cancelled his audiences for two days. When he saw his councillors on August 14, he told them that Geng gave him medicine to induce vomiting. He was slightly better but his appetite was gone and his belly constantly ached. Zhezong attended the banquet in honor of his son, in which he was in a very good mood and that his younger brother Zhao Ji also attended. However, Zhao Mao became sick. Zhezong, now in a bad mood due to his son&#x27;s illness told his councillors that the royal doctors were treating Zhao Mao. On September 26, Zhao Mao was getting better but soon died making Zhezong cancelling his audiences for three days. His birthday was a great celebration but was cut short when after the birthday party, he fell ill and was vomiting all day long. He also contracted laryngitis and could only speak with great effort. By December 21, Zhezong was close to death; he had a weak pulse.

Emperor Zhezong died on February 23, 1100, in Kaifeng at the age of 23 and was succeeded by his younger brother, Emperor Huizong. Huizong&#x27;s mother, Empress Xiang, led a conservative restoration in court.

<doc id="1154830" wikidata="Q1133157" url="?curid=1154830" title="Planimetrics">
<text>Planimetrics is the study of plane measurements, including angles, distances, and areas.

==History==
To measure planimetrics a planimeter or dot planimeter is used. This rather advanced analog technology is being taken over by simple image measurement software tools like, ImageJ, Adobe Acrobat, Google Earth Pro, Gimp, Photoshop and KLONK Image Measurement which can help do this kind of work from digitalized images.

==In geography==
Planimetric elements in geography are those features that are independent of elevation, such as roads, building footprints, and rivers and lakes. They are represented on two-dimensional maps as they are seen from the air, or in aerial photography. These features are often digitized from orthorectified aerial photography into data layers that can be used in analysis and cartographic outputs.

A &quot;planimetric map&quot; is one that does not include relief data.

<text>Robert Fry Engle III (born November 10, 1942) is an American economist and statistician. He won the 2003 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, sharing the award with Clive Granger, &quot;for methods of analyzing economic time series with time-varying volatility (ARCH)&quot;.

==Biography==
Engle was born in Syracuse, New York into a Quaker family and went on to graduate from Williams College with a BS in physics. He earned an MS in physics and a PhD in economics, both from Cornell University, in 1966 and 1969 respectively. After completing his PhD, Engle became an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1969 to 1977. He joined the faculty of the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) in 1975, wherefrom he retired in 2003. He now holds positions of Professor Emeritus and Research Professor at UCSD. He currently teaches at New York University, Stern School of Business where he is the Michael Armellino professor in Management of Financial Services. At New York University, Engle teaches for the Master of Science in Risk Management Program for Executives.

Engle&#x27;s most important contribution was his path-breaking discovery of a method for analyzing unpredictable movements in financial market prices and interest rates. Accurate characterization and prediction of these volatile movements are essential for quantifying and effectively managing risk. For example, risk measurement plays a key role in pricing options and financial derivatives. Previous researchers had either assumed constant volatility or had used simple devices to approximate it. Engle developed new statistical models of volatility that captured the tendency of stock prices and other financial variables to move between high volatility and low volatility periods (&quot;Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity: ARCH&quot;). These statistical models have become essential tools of modern arbitrage pricing theory and practice.

Engle was the central founder and director of NYU-Stern&#x27;s Volatility Institute which publishes weekly date on systemic risk across countries on its V-LAB site. He was awarded a Doctor Honoris Causa by the Comillas Pontifical University in Spain in 2024.

<text>The National Medical Association (NMA) is the largest and oldest organization representing African American physicians and their patients in the United States. As a 501(c)(3) national professional and scientific organization, the NMA represents the interests of over 30,000 African American physicians and their patients, with nearly 112 affiliated societies throughout the nation and U.S. territories. Through its membership, professional growth, community health education, advocacy, research, and collaborations with public and private organizations, the organization is dedicated to enhancing the quality of health among minorities and underprivileged people. Throughout its history, the NMA has primarily focused on health issues related to African Americans and medically underserved populations. However, its principles, goals, initiatives, and philosophy encompass all ethnic groups

==History==
During the Jim Crow era in the southern part of the United States, state laws and social customs mandated the racial segregation of medical societies, medical facilities, and medical education. The NMA was organized by twelve black doctors attending the Cotton States and International Exposition in Atlanta, Georgia. The first president was Robert F. Boyd, and Daniel Hale Williams served as the vice president.

=== National health insurance ===
The NMA, dedicated to promoting the interests of those of &quot;African Descent&quot;, contributed to the national health insurance dialogue from 1900 to 1950. Despite its rather marginal size, starting in the mid-1910s, the NMA advocated compulsory health insurance. Primarily, the association sought any means that provided medical care for African Americans. As an association, however, it also sought to promote the interests of the African American physicians themselves.

From the mid-1910s to the late 1940s, the American Medical Association (AMA) acted as the mainstream medical profession&#x27;s voice. Yet numerous African American doctors were unable to join the AMA due to the lack of county medical societies and because of local bigoted practices, thereby limiting the number of African American AMA members. To exacerbate matters further, the NMA&#x27;s leadership continued to support compulsory health insurance while AMA members largely distanced themselves from such a scheme due to (a) the red scare, (b) the belief in U.S. health superiority to other nations with national health insurance schemes and (c) the argument that national health insurance would potentially ruin the &quot;sacred&quot; practitioner-patient relationship. Struggling between providing medical care for African Americans as well as maintaining the voice of African American physicians, the NMA was internally divided on these issues from the late 1930s-early 1950s.

During this time period, the NMA leadership repeatedly stated their support for a national health insurance scheme through the Journal of the National Medical Association as well as newspapers like the Chicago Defender. At the same time, rank-and-file members, desirous to practice medicine, supported the AMA&#x27;s proposals. Indeed, during the height of the health insurance debates from 1946 to 1950, the AMA often sent guest speakers to the NMA&#x27;s conferences. Such AMA officials promised the NMA membership in their ranks as well as the right to practice medicine. Yet the NMA&#x27;s leadership largely resisted the AMA&#x27;s efforts. NMA presidents like Drs. E. L. Robinson, C. Austin Whitter and J. G. Gathings opposed the AMA&#x27;s proposals on the grounds that the AMA had previously excluded African American patients from their care as well as African American physicians from their ranks. Furthermore, the AMA&#x27;s support of Abraham Flexner&#x27;s Report of 1910 witnessed the closure of numerous African American and women&#x27;s hospitals across the country. How could, the NMA leadership argued, African American doctors support the AMA when the AMA was, in fact, the origin of some of African American&#x27;s most severe issues (indeed, NMA member Dr. Cobb compared the AMA&#x27;s tactics to the KKK during 1946–50).

By the early 1950s, the NMA still did not possess a consensual platform concerning health insurance. Internally torn about the best methods to promote their own professional ambitions as well as the interests of African American patients, the health insurance topic remained a divisive one. Still, members of the NMA offered resistance to the AMA&#x27;s promotion of voluntary health insurance when few medical practitioners dared to.

In the late 1950s, the NMA took a more active interest in civil rights under the leadership of its president, T. R. M. Howard, a surgeon from Mississippi. In the months after his election as president, Howard had played a key role in the search for evidence and witnesses in the Emmett Till murder case and led the largest civil rights organization in the state, the Regional Council of Negro Leadership. In 1957, under his leadership, the NMA organized the Imhotep National Conference on Hospital Integration which publicized and challenged continuing hospital segregation in both the North and South.

==NMA Convention and Scientific Assembly==

Nearly every year since its founding in 1895, the NMA has held the Annual Convention &amp; Scientific Assembly, which is regarded as the nation&#x27;s foremost forum on medical science and African American health. The NMA is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education to sponsor continuing medical education.

Through the presentation of CME programs at the national and regional conventions, as well as at state and local society meetings, NMA members are able to meet Category 1 requirements for the Physician&#x27;s Achievement Award of the NMA and the Physician&#x27;s Recognition Award of the American Medical Association (AMA). The NMA offers CME programs in 23 specialties—from aerospace medicine to urology.

==Program awareness==
The NMA has conducted national consumer awareness programs in cancer, women&#x27;s health, radon, secondhand smoke, smoking cessation and immunizations. Further, the work of the NMA and its members has received national exposure on NBC, ABC, FOX and CNN television stations, as well as numerous radio and major print media each year.

==&quot;Journal of the National Medical Association&quot;==
The official journal of the National Medical Association, Journal of the National Medical Association, began publication in 1908 soon after the founding of the NMA with C. V. Roman as first editor. Currently under the leadership of Editor-in-Chief Edith P. Mitchell, MD, MACP, FCPP, it is a peer-reviewed publication whose purpose is to address medical care disparities of persons of African descent.

<text>The RBC Bronwen Wallace Award for Emerging Writers is a Canadian literary award, presented annually by the Writers&#x27; Trust of Canada to a writer who has not yet published his or her first book. Formerly restricted to writers under age 35, the age limit was removed in 2021, with the prize now open to emerging writers regardless of age.

Named in memory of Bronwen Wallace, a Canadian writer who died of cancer in 1989, the award was created in 1994 by her literary executor Carolyn Smart to honour Wallace&#x27;s work as a creative writing instructor and mentor to young writers. The Royal Bank of Canada stepped in as the award&#x27;s corporate sponsor in 2012, through its Emerging Artists Project.

The prize has a monetary value of $10,000, with finalists receiving $2,500. The prize formerly alternated every other year between poetry and short fiction; in 2020 the Writers&#x27; Trust announced that they would present annual awards in both categories. In October 2024, the Writers&#x27; Trust announced that a third award category for creative non-fiction will be added to the awards in 2025.

==Winners==
Note that at present, the Writers Trust&#x27;s awards database does not provide the titles of winning or nominated works prior to 2008. Before that date, titles are provided below where known from other sources; from 2008 on, all titles are listed.

<doc id="1154841" wikidata="Q6690960" url="?curid=1154841" title="Love Life (musical)">
<text>Love Life is a musical written by Kurt Weill (music) and Alan Jay Lerner (book and lyrics). 

The musical opened at the 46th Street Theatre on Broadway (now the Richard Rodgers) on October 7, 1948, and closed on May 14, 1949, after having played 252 performances. The original production starred Ray Middleton and Nanette Fabray, was directed by Elia Kazan, and choreographed by Michael Kidd. Fabray won the Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical for her performance. 

==Synopsis==
The show told the story of a married couple, Sam and Susan Cooper, who never age as they progress from 1791 to 1948, encountering difficulties in their marriage (and thus the very fabric of marriage) as they struggle to cope with changing social mores. One of the earliest examples of the concept musical, the action of &quot;Love Life&quot; was interspersed with vaudeville-style numbers that commented on the story, in a way very similar to &quot;Cabaret&quot; (which opened in 1966).

== Revivals ==
In 2017 &quot;Love Life&quot; was staged at Theater Freiburg using a German-language translation of Lerner&#x27;s libretto by Rüdiger Bering. His translation was approved of by the Kurt Weill Foundation and was praised for successfully &quot;striking a tone reminiscent of the great song and operetta lyricists of the German and Viennese interwar years, such as Marcellus Schiffer and Fritz Löhner-Beda&quot;.

The show will be revived twice in 2025, by Opera North in Leeds, UK (the show&#x27;s UK premiere and first UK recording), and by New York City Center in 2025 as part of their Encores series starring Kate Baldwin and Nicholas Christopher.

The January 2025 Opera North production should provide the first cast recording.

The song &quot;I Remember it Well&quot; is the original version of a lyric Lerner revised for use in the 1958 film, &quot;Gigi&quot;.

<text>The Charleston Daily Mail was a newspaper based in Charleston, West Virginia. On July 20, 2015, it merged with the &quot;Charleston Gazette&quot; to form the &quot;Charleston Gazette-Mail&quot;.

==Publishing history==
The &quot;Daily Mail&quot; was founded in 1914 by former Alaska Governor Walter Eli Clark and remained the property of his heirs until 1987. Governor Clark described the newspaper as an &quot;independent Republican&quot; publication. The newspaper published in the afternoons, Monday–Saturday, with a Sunday morning edition, until 1961, when the paper entered into a Joint Operating Agreement with the morning &quot;Charleston Gazette&quot; and the new Sunday &quot;Charleston Gazette-Mail&quot; was substituted and the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; began a six-day afternoon publishing schedule.

In 1987, the Clark heirs sold the paper to the Toronto-based Thomson Newspapers. The new owners moderated the political views of the paper to some degree. In 1998, Thomson sold the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; to the Denver-based MediaNews Group.

In May 2004, MediaNews sold the paper to the Daily Gazette Company, the owners of the morning newspaper. The new owner reduced the staff and canceled its Saturday edition, publishing Monday–Friday afternoons from 2004 to 2009. It also began to market the paper in an uncompetitive manner in an attempt to drive its circulation down to the point it could be closed. The United States Department of Justice filed suit under antitrust laws almost immediately. In the course of the lawsuit it was discovered that the Daily Gazette Company had presented a business plan to the United Bank which projected a shutdown of the paper no later than 2007.

In January 2009, the paper was switched to a morning publication.

On January 20, 2010, the Daily Gazette Company and the Justice Department settled relative to violations in the purchase of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and the Daily Gazette Company&#x27;s management of it. Under the announced terms of the settlement, the previous owner, the Media News Group, held a perpetual option to re-purchase 20% of the paper, had two of five seats on the management board, and determined the size of the budget for its news staff and choose its editorial content. The Daily Gazette was required to seek government permission to cease publication of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and the intellectual property of the paper passed to the Media News Group when it shut down. This intellectual property once included the domain name dailymail.com which the newspaper beat the larger London paper in registering in 1996, but in January 2014 it was reported that the British company had paid over £1m (US$1.7m) for the domain name for its Mail Online service.

The newspaper was merged with the &quot;Charleston Gazette&quot;, without prior notice on July 20, 2015, to form the &quot;Charleston Gazette-Mail&quot;.

== Awards ==
The &quot;Daily Mail&quot; has won awards in many fields. J. D. Maurice, its editor of many years until his retirement in 1978, won the Sigma Delta Chi Award for editorial writing in 1958 and the Pulitzer Prize for distinguished editorial writing in 1975.

<doc id="1154851" wikidata="Q5323112" url="?curid=1154851" title="EIA-608">
<text>EIA-608, also known as &quot;Line 21 captions&quot; and &quot;CEA-608&quot;, is a standard for closed captioning for NTSC TV broadcasts in the United States, Canada and Mexico. It was developed by the Electronic Industries Alliance and required by law to be implemented in most television receivers made in the United States.

It specifies an &quot;Extended Data Service&quot;, which is a means for including a VCR control service with an electronic program guide for NTSC transmissions that operates on the even Line 21 field, similar to the TeleText based VPS that operates on line 16 which is used in PAL countries.

EIA-608 captions are transmitted on either the odd or even fields of Line 21 with an odd parity bit in the non-visible active video data area in NTSC broadcasts, and are also sometimes present in the picture user data in ATSC transmissions. It uses a fixed bandwidth of 480 bit/s per Line 21 field for a maximum of 32 characters per line per caption (maximum four lines) for a 30 frame broadcast. The odd field captions relate to the primary audio track and the even field captions related to the SAP or secondary audio track which is generally a second language translation of the primary audio, such as a French or Spanish translation of an English-speaking TV show.

Raw EIA-608 caption byte pairs are becoming less prevalent as digital television replaces analog. ATSC broadcasts instead use the EIA-708 caption protocol to encapsulate both the EIA-608 caption pairs as well as add a native EIA-708 stream. EIA-608 has had revisions with the addition of extended character sets to fully support the representation of the Spanish, French, German languages, and cross section of other Western European languages. EIA-608 was also extended to support two byte characters for the Korean and Japanese markets. The full version of EIA-708 has support for more character sets and better caption positioning options; however, because of existing EIA-608 hardware and revisions to the format, there has been little or no real world use of the format besides simple 608 to 708 inline conversions.

==Channels==
EIA-608 defines four channels of caption information, so that a program could, for example, have captions in four different languages. There are two channels, called 1 and 2 by the standard, in each of the two fields of a frame. The channels are often presented to users numbered simply as CC1-2 for the odd field and CC3-4 for the even field. Due to bandwidth limitations on either field, CC1 and CC3 are the only ones used, meaning that there has been little use for the second channel. Early Spanish SAP captioned broadcasts first used the second channel CC2 because the original caption decoders only read the first odd field, but later switched to using CC3 for bandwidth reasons. Due to the same bandwidth reasons XDS was never used by Spanish-speaking stations.

Within each channel, there are two streams of information which might be considered sub-channels: one carries &quot;captions&quot; and the other &quot;text&quot;. The latter is not in common use due to the lack of hardware support and bandwidth available. Text is signaled by the use of text commands and can be used for a formatted URL string with a 16-bit checksum that designates a web site that the captions relate to or a local station communication channel.

This layering is based on the OSI Protocol Reference Model:
==DVD GOP user data insertion==
The user data structure that follows a H.262 GOP header is as follows (the same would apply after an ISO/IEC 14496-2 GOP header):
bslbf: bit string, left bit first ; uimsbf: unsigned integer, most significant bit first

Caption blocks are inserted after the sequence and GOP headers, so each block is for one second of video which would end up being one or two long lines or three to four short lines of text. Also that means if the caption_block_count is greater than 30 then the block contains both interleaved caption fields and one could devise the framing rate from the caption_block_count. However since the data is grouped together the framing rate will almost always be 30/1.001, unlike the ATSC method that inserts one byte pair for each field after the picture header making framing rates of 24/1.001 possible for HD content. Since when a decoder does a 3:2 pull-down for NTSC output the captions will remain in sync.

==DVB transport insertion==
The packet-ed structure that is inserted before the H.222 video packet is as follows for a frame of associated video:
bslbf: bit string, left bit first ; uimsbf: unsigned integer, most significant bit first

This structure was designed for any digital VBI data and was optimized to carry three or more 43-byte Teletext packets. e.g. a page header and two associated lines. For Teletext subtitles, the data_unit_id is set to 3. In this form, captions have to be separated into byte pairs spread over frames in one second of video rather than grouped into one block as with the DVD structure. The same is true for Teletext subtitles with more than one line of text.

==SDI/MXF SMPTE 291M insertion==
The packet-ed structure that is inserted before the SMPTE 259M active video frame or MXF essence video packet is coded as follows for a frame of associated video:
bslbf: bit string, left bit first ; uimsbf: unsigned integer, most significant bit first

This structure was designed for any digital audio or metadata that is to be synchronized with a video frame. SDI transports every eight bits in a 10 bit aligned packet, unlike MXF which is byte aligned and the ancillary flag bytes are replaced by 128 bit header.

==Extended Data Service==

The EIA-608 data stream format includes Extended Data Service (XDS), a variety of information about the transmission. It is all optional,:
* 
* program name
* offensiveness rating (violence, sex, etc.)
* program category (drama, game show, etc.)

==Characters==
There are three sets of characters that the EIA-608 stream can direct the receiver to display: basic characters, special characters, and extended characters. A single two-byte EIA-608 command (represented by a single VBI line) can specify two basic characters, one special character, or one extended character.

Extended characters are a later addition to the standard and their decoding is optional.

EIA-608 provides controls for the color of the foreground and background of the text, underlining, blinking, and italics. The default color scheme is white characters on a black background, all opaque.

The Transparent Space special character implies a transparent background even in the absence of any background control commands. As the foreground of this character is a blank space, it really means a gap in the close caption text.

In these examples
===Non-caption data===
This is used to either pad out the field line when no captions are sent or for the eXtended Data Service.
===Basic North American character set===
A command with bits 13 or 14 on directs the receiver to display two basic characters at the current cursor position for the current mode (closed caption or text). Each character is a code point (identifies the character to display), as follows.
The code is almost identical to ASCII; the exceptions are shown in red.

In the table, SB represents a solid block. The apostrophe (code 27), which may originally have been intended to be a neutral apostrophe as in ASCII, is recommended to be rendered as a right single quotation mark (Unicode U+2019). For a neutral single quote/apostrophe, the plain single quote from the extended character set should be used.

===Special North American character set===
The only typical use in North America of this set is the use of the eighth note character to denote changes from spoken dialogue to singing or musical only scenes.

It is an acceptable broadcast engineering practice when translating EIA-608 to Teletext for PAL compatible countries to substitute this character for a number sign because of its similarity to a sharp.

A command to display a special character has a first byte of 0x11 or 0x19 (depending upon channel). The second byte is a code point in the range 0x30–0x3F as follows.


TM is short for unregistered trademark and should be represented in superscript (like the Unicode character ). TS in the table above represents a &quot;transparent space&quot; or non-breaking space. Finally, the Eighth note (♪) is used to denote singing or background music in captions.

===Extended Western European character set===
These extended character sets are rarely used due to most European countries using the BBC Ceefax based Teletext system.

The Ceefax system is more prone to character errors due to the greater number of data bits (337 versus 16) encoded per VBI field, these errors occur either on noise prone analog transmissions or connections.

* A command to display an extended Spanish/French or miscellaneous character has a first byte of 0x12 or 0x1A (depending upon channel).
* A command to display an extended Portuguese/German/Danish character has a first byte of 0x13 or 0x1B (depending upon channel).

The second byte is a code point in the range 0x20-0x3F is as follows

|

SM is short for service mark and should be represented in superscript (like Unicode character ). The single quote mark is a curly left and double quote marks are curly left and right. The plus signs refer to top left, top right, lower left and lower right corners for box drawing.

==Non-Western Norpak character sets==
When used all standard and extended character sets are unused in favor of the following predefined sets, care must be taken to not emulate any control commands. This is an extension submitted to the CEC by Norpak who made a similar extension to the Teletext format for the Chinese market. The main use has been to provide double byte code point captioning to the Japanese, Taiwanese and South Korean markets. A command to switch character sets has a first byte of 0x17 or 0x1F (depending upon channel). The second byte is a character set reference in the range 0x24-0x2A as follows

==Control commands==
Bits 15 and 7 are always odd parity bits. Bit 11 is always the channel bit.

Preamble address code with masking bit 15,11 and 7 as already defined above
can be interpreted from following table
 
The row bits specify which of the fifteen screen rows should contain the caption text: row 11 (0000), 1 (0010), 2 (0011), 3, 4, 12, 13, 14, 15, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 (1111).

The attributes bits allow 16 possibilities, which are: white (0000), green, blue, cyan, red, yellow, magenta, italics, indent 0, indent 4, indent 8, indent 12, indent 16, indent 20, indent 24, indent 28 (1111).

For a midrow code these are as follows: Bits 14, 13, 10, 9, 6 and 4 are always 0, bits 12, 8 and 5 are always 1. Bits 3, 2 and 1 form the color attribute 0001X10X(see the listing of attributes). Bit 0 indicates underline.

For other control codes these are as follows: Bits 14, 13, 9, 6 and 4 are always 0, bits 12, 10 and 5 are always 1. Bit 8 chooses between Line 21 and 284. Bits 3, 2, 1 and 0 identify the particular action.

The command bits allow 16 possibilities, which are: resume caption loading (0000), backspace (0001), delete to end of row (0100), roll-up captions 2-rows, roll-up captions 3 rows, roll-up captions 4-rows, flash on (0.25 seconds once per second), resume direct captioning, text restart, resume text display, erase displayed memory, carriage return, erase nondisplayed memory, end of caption (1111).

For tabs these are as follows: Bits 14, 13, 6, 4, 3, 2 are always 0, bits 12, 10, 9, 8, 5 are always 1. Bits 1 and 0 determine the number of tab offsets.

Considering parity bit already ignored hex value have of 2 byte data is following command:

<text>Pyrosequencing is a method of DNA sequencing (determining the order of nucleotides in DNA) based on the &quot;sequencing by synthesis&quot; principle, in which the sequencing is performed by detecting the nucleotide incorporated by a DNA polymerase. Pyrosequencing relies on light detection based on a chain reaction when pyrophosphate is released. Hence, the name pyrosequencing.

The principle of pyrosequencing was first described in 1993 by, Bertil Pettersson, Mathias Uhlen and Pål Nyren by combining the solid phase sequencing method using streptavidin coated magnetic beads with recombinant DNA polymerase lacking 3´to 5´exonuclease activity (proof-reading) and luminescence detection using the firefly luciferase enzyme. A mixture of three enzymes (DNA polymerase, ATP sulfurylase and firefly luciferase) and a nucleotide (dNTP) are added to single stranded DNA to be sequenced and the incorporation of nucleotide is followed by measuring the light emitted. The intensity of the light determines if 0, 1 or more nucleotides have been incorporated, thus showing how many complementary nucleotides are present on the template strand. The nucleotide mixture is removed before the next nucleotide mixture is added. This process is repeated with each of the four nucleotides until the DNA sequence of the single stranded template is determined.

A second solution-based method for pyrosequencing was described in 1998 by Mostafa Ronaghi, Mathias Uhlen and Pål Nyren. In this alternative method, an additional enzyme apyrase is introduced to remove nucleotides that are not incorporated by the DNA polymerase. This enabled the enzyme mixture including the DNA polymerase, the luciferase and the apyrase to be added at the start and kept throughout the procedure, thus providing a simple set-up suitable for automation. An automated instrument based on this principle was introduced to the market the following year by the company Pyrosequencing.

A third microfluidic variant of the pyrosequencing method was described in 2005 by Jonathan Rothberg and co-workers at the company 454 Life Sciences. This alternative approach for pyrosequencing was based on the original principle of attaching the DNA to be sequenced to a solid support and they showed that sequencing could be performed in a highly parallel manner using a microfabricated microarray. This allowed for high-throughput DNA sequencing and an automated instrument was introduced to the market. This became the first next generation sequencing instrument starting a new era in genomics research, with rapidly falling prices for DNA sequencing allowing whole genome sequencing at affordable prices.

==Procedure ==

&quot;Sequencing by synthesis&quot; involves taking a single strand of the DNA to be sequenced and then synthesizing its complementary strand enzymatically. The pyrosequencing method is based on detecting the activity of DNA polymerase (a DNA synthesizing enzyme) with another chemoluminescent enzyme. Essentially, the method allows sequencing a single strand of DNA by synthesizing the complementary strand along it, one base pair at a time, and detecting which base was actually added at each step. The template DNA is immobile, and solutions of A, C, G, and T nucleotides are sequentially added and removed from the reaction. Light is produced only when the nucleotide solution complements the first unpaired base of the template. The sequence of solutions which produce chemiluminescent signals allows the determination of the sequence of the template.

For the solution-based version of pyrosequencing, the single-strand DNA (ssDNA) template is hybridized to a sequencing primer and incubated with the enzymes DNA polymerase, ATP sulfurylase, luciferase and apyrase, and with the substrates adenosine 5´ phosphosulfate (APS) and luciferin.
# The addition of one of the four deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) (dATPαS, which is not a substrate for a luciferase, is added instead of dATP to avoid noise) initiates the second step. DNA polymerase incorporates the correct, complementary dNTPs onto the template. This incorporation releases pyrophosphate (PPi).
# ATP sulfurylase converts PPi to ATP in the presence of adenosine 5´ phosphosulfate. This ATP acts as a substrate for the luciferase-mediated conversion of luciferin to oxyluciferin that generates visible light in amounts that are proportional to the amount. The light produced in the luciferase-catalyzed reaction is detected by a camera and analyzed in a program.
# Unincorporated nucleotides and ATP are degraded by the apyrase, and the reaction can restart with another nucleotide.

The process can be represented by the following equations:
* PPi + APS → ATP + Sulfate (catalyzed by ATP-sulfurylase);
* ATP + luciferin + O2 → AMP + PPi + oxyluciferin + + hv (catalyzed by luciferase);
where:
* PPi is pyrophosphate
* APS is adenosine 5-phosphosulfate;
* ATP is adenosine triphosphate;
* O2 is oxygen molecule;
* AMP is adenosine monophosphate;
* is carbon dioxide;
* hv is light.

==Limitations==

Currently, a limitation of the method is that the lengths of individual reads of DNA sequence are in the neighborhood of 300-500 nucleotides, shorter than the 800-1000 obtainable with chain termination methods (e.g. Sanger sequencing). This can make the process of genome assembly more difficult, particularly for sequences containing a large amount of repetitive DNA. Lack of proof-reading activity limits accuracy of this method.

==Commercialization==

The company Pyrosequencing AB in Uppsala, Sweden was founded with venture capital provided by HealthCap in order to commercialize machinery and reagents for sequencing short stretches of DNA using the pyrosequencing technique. Pyrosequencing AB was listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange in 1999. It was renamed to Biotage in 2003. The pyrosequencing business line was acquired by Qiagen in 2008. Pyrosequencing technology was further licensed to 454 Life Sciences. 454 developed an array-based pyrosequencing technology which emerged as a platform for large-scale DNA sequencing, including genome sequencing and metagenomics.

Roche announced the discontinuation of the 454 sequencing platform in 2013.
