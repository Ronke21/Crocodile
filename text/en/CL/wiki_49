<text>Mr. Peabody is an anthropomorphic cartoon dog who appeared in the late 1950s and early 1960s television animated series &quot;The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends&quot;, produced by Jay Ward. Peabody appeared in the &quot;Peabody&#x27;s Improbable History&quot; segments created by Ted Key, and he was voiced by Bill Scott. In 2014, he was featured in the animated film, &quot;Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman&quot;. From 2015 to 2017, he appeared in a television series based on the film.

Mr. Peabody&#x27;s first name is never given or referred to in the cartoons, but, in an animated promotion for the &quot;Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle&quot; Savings Stamp Club, he tells Sherman that it is &quot;Hector&quot;.

==&quot;Peabody&#x27;s Improbable History&quot;==
===Plot===
The cartoons are about Peabody, who is the smartest being in existence, having graduated from Harvard when he was 3 years old. (&quot;Wagna cum laude&quot;). Peabody has accomplished many things in his life as a business magnate, inventor, scientist, Nobel laureate, gourmand, and two-time Olympic medalist.

In the first episode, Peabody meets an orphan named Sherman (portrayed by Walter Tetley) whom he saves from some bullies. He adopts Sherman after a court appearance that also involved him having to get the President and the government to help him out. Upon inventing the Wayback Machine and doing different upgrades, Peabody and Sherman meet various historic figures and help out with their plights. Each installment ends with Peabody making a pun on something revolving around the episode&#x27;s time-traveling trip. An example of such a pun is &quot;Marie Antoinette could have avoided trouble by making an edict for the people to eat cake, but she could not have her cake and edict too.&quot;

==Film==

An animated feature film based on the characters of Mister Peabody and Sherman had been in development at DreamWorks Animation since 2007. The feature was directed by Rob Minkoff, who is known for co-directing &quot;The Lion King&quot; for Disney. In January 2011, it was announced that an animated film titled &quot;Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman&quot; would be released on March 14, 2014. Robert Downey Jr. was announced to voice Mr. Peabody, but in March 2012, was replaced by Ty Burrell. Max Charles, the actor who played young Peter Parker in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; voiced Sherman. In June 2012, it was reported that &quot;Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman&quot;&#x27;s release date had been moved up to November 8, 2013. Stephen Colbert voiced Paul Peterson, Penny&#x27;s father; Leslie Mann voiced Peterson&#x27;s wife, Patty, and Ariel Winter (Burrell&#x27;s &quot;Modern Family&quot; co-star) voiced their daughter Penny. Also joining the cast were Allison Janney and Stephen Tobolowsky. In September 2012, the release date was moved up for a week to November 1, 2013. It finally had an official release on March 7, 2014. The film was produced by Alex Schwartz and Denise Cascino, and written by Craig Wright.

The film focused much more on Mr. Peabody and Sherman&#x27;s personal lives that prompt a series of time-traveling mishaps with the WABAC machine, forcing the pair to put things on track before the space-time continuum is irreparably destroyed.

Unlike the show, Mr. Peabody treats Sherman as a beloved son, whom he adopted as an infant rather than as a pet and assistant, and the machine is more futuristic with an autonomous aircraft function. Also, a third member of the team is introduced, Penny, who is Sherman&#x27;s rival and later, best friend and love interest.

==&quot;The Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman Show&quot;==

An animated television series, starring Mr. Peabody and Sherman, premiered in October 2015, on Netflix. It takes the form of a talk show named &quot;The Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman Show&quot;, with Mr. Peabody and Sherman hosting historical guests. The series is inspired by the 1960s short segments, including their hand-drawn animation and comedy, and it also integrates some elements from the 2014 film. Mr. Peabody is voiced by Chris Parnell, while Max Charles reprises his role as Sherman from the film. In this series, Peabody&#x27;s family is further explored, with his foster parents appearing in the first season&#x27;s episode nine, and his distant Uncle Duke appearing in a time travel adventure in the fourth season&#x27;s episode six.

==Appearances==

===Television shows===
*In &quot;The Simpsons&quot;&#x27; fifth Halloween special (&quot;Treehouse of Horror V&quot;), in the &quot;Time and Punishment&quot; segment, Homer Simpson finds himself able to travel through time by means of a magic toaster and claims he is the &quot;first non-Brazilian person to travel backwards through time&quot;. He then comes across Mr. Peabody (voiced by Dan Castellaneta) and Sherman (voiced by Nancy Cartwright). Mr. Peabody then corrects Homer, saying he is actually the second. Sherman then agrees with him, only for Mr. Peabody to respond with &quot;Quiet, you&quot;. The characters Kang and Kodos later take on Peabody&#x27;s and Sherman&#x27;s appearances (though still in their helmets and with their tentacles) due to Homer&#x27;s meddling with the time stream.
*In &quot;Time Squad&quot;, the character Otto is modeled on Sherman, and Larry partially on Peabody.
*In the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;The Kiss Seen Around the World&quot;, Peter Griffin and Brian Griffin travel back in time to see Christopher Columbus. The two don similar looks to Mister Peabody and Sherman; the flashback also parodies the format of the show, with the two going back in time and Brian (Mr. Peabody) teaching Peter (Sherman).
* In the &quot;Wander Over Yonder&quot; episode, &quot;The Time Bomb&quot;, a dog resembling Mr. Peabody appears as one of the racers in the Galactic Conjunction 6000 race. 
*He and Sherman made a small cameo in the first chapter of &quot;Moosebumps!&quot; in &quot;The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot;.

===Tribute===
* The 1985 film &quot;Back to the Future&quot; included a 1955 character named Otis Peabody with a son named Sherman, a tribute to the animated characters. Unlike the famed duo, this Sherman and Mr. Peabody are hostile toward Marty McFly and his time machine, mistaking Marty for an evil alien and his DeLorean time machine for a spaceship.
* The Wayback Machine, which records extant Internet webpages on https://archive.org (USA), is named after Mr. Peabody&#x27;s WABAC machine.
* The comic series &#x27;Gold Digger&#x27; by Fred Perry includes a long running villain based loosely on this show. Dr Alfred Peachbody and his trained attack-boy Benji are trying to change history to enable their dominance over the humans from their alternative future with their first appearance in the comic involving them trying to sabotage the person who invented the dog whistle. They also take part in a crossover event with Ben Dunn&#x27;s Ninja High School comic.

<text>Nedumbassery () is a census town within the Nedumbassery gram panchayat in the Aluva taluk of Ernakulam district, Kerala, India. Situated between Angamaly and Aluva, it is home to Cochin International Airport.

==Location==

As per the 2011 census, Nedumbassery is classified as a census town (CT). It is located within the Nedumbassery gram panchayat in the Parakkadavu block panchayat of Aluva taluk in Ernakulam district, Kerala, India. The panchayat comprises two villages—Nedumbassery and Chengamanad. Nedumbassery is part of the Chalakudy Lok Sabha constituency and Aluva Assembly constituency.

==History==
The rice paddy fields in and around Nedumbassery were once a granary to the people of Kerala. The paddy fields are fertile as a result of the nearby Periyar river and its branches which fertile the land with abundant crops. The paddy fields of Nedumbassery were selected for study by Government of India for the Japanese delegation who conducted study of paddy cultivation at Nedumbassery in the 1960s. The Japanese agricultural scientist recorded in detail the cultivation techniques of the people in Nedumbassery for their research.

Nedumbassery is also the home town of Jacobite Syrian Bishop late &#x27;Gewargis Mor Gregorios, BA, LT of Vayaliparambil Pynadath family(1899–1966),
a leader, agriculturist and an educationalist who managed &quot;High school to an Engineering college&quot; (1960s) and started a silent educational revolution in India as early as 1939 in pre-independent British India. HG.Mor Gregorios Vayaliparambil was the first Chairman of Mor Athanasious College Association, Kothamangalam.

The sites of Mor Sabor and Afroth Jacobite Syrian Orthodox Cathedral were built in 825 AD and named after two Syrian Orthodox bishops who arrived India in 825 AD, Mor Sabor and Mor Afroth. The Patriarchs of Antioch who visited India have visited this ancient cathedral in Nedumbassery starting with HH.Patriarch Ignatious Peter IV of Antioch in 1876. Malankara Metropolitan Bishop St. Athanasius Paulose Pynadath (1918–53) of Jacobite Syrian Orthodox Church frequently visited Mor Sabor and Mor Afroth Jacobite Church in Nedumbassery as it was his home parish. This church was a decision making centre of Jacobite Syrian Church of India as all Indian bishops and middle East Syriac bishops routinely visited here..

==Education==
An English High school was built at Nedumbassery in 1939 by Jacobite Syrian Bishop H.E. Mor Gregorios Vayaliparambil (also the first chairman of Mor Athanasious College Association, Kothamangalam) and was known as &#x27;Mor Athanasious High School&#x27;. This school provided education to all people in the nearby areas including Angamaly and Perumbavur. The school has been a source of education to all classes of people and has produced many IAS officers and top bureaucrats for India. In 1949 Mor Gregorios Vayaliparambil Pynadath constructed a new church in Nedumbassery, opposite his school known as St.George Jacobite Syrian Church.

==Economy==
There was a manufacturing unit built using Japanese collaboration functioning here in the late 1960s called &#x27;Toshiba Anand&#x27; which was since then decommissioned. A state-owned heavy agro machinery industry called &#x27;KAMCO&#x27; (Kerala Agro Machinery Corporation Ltd) is also functioning here. The Japanese delegation of agricultural scientist had conducted study of paddy cultivation in Nedumbassery in a joint venture with Government of India in the 1960s. Nedumbassery was historically used for rice cultivation and large paddy fields - prior to airport land acquisition.

There is a Panchayat office and post office at Kariyad in Nedumbassery.

=== Cochin International Airport ===

Nedumbassery is the location of Cochin International Airport, the first airport in India built from a P3 development portfolio. It also houses the airport&#x27;s solar plant, making it the first fully solar powered airport in India and the world. Due to its location, the airport is colloquially referred to as Nedumbassery Airport among the local populace. As a result of the previous geography of Nedumbassery, the entire airport was built by filling vast paddy fields with special government permission.

The airport has since has been the principal airport serving Kerala, being key contributor to the economic growth of Nedumbassery and Greater Kochi, since initial civil operations were transferred from the &quot;INS Garuda&quot; naval enclave within the city east of Kochi. In addition, it has become the eighth largest airport in terms of passenger movement within India as of 2024.

A new approach road has been built exclusively from the NH544 to the airport and new hotels and businesses have come up on the sides on the new road with a bridge above the railway underpass, in alignment with aerotropolis design plans of Nedumbassery.

<doc id="1170701" wikidata="Q1423180" url="?curid=1170701" title="Winterland Ballroom">
<text>Winterland Ballroom (more commonly known as Winterland Arena or simply Winterland) was an ice skating rink and music venue in San Francisco, California, United States. The arena was located at the corner of Post Street and Steiner Street. It was converted for exclusive use as a music venue in 1971 by concert promoter Bill Graham and became a popular performance location for many rock acts. Graham later formed a merchandising company called Winterland Productions, which sold concert shirts, memorabilia, and official sports team merchandise.

==History==
The venue was opened on June 29, 1928, as the &quot;New Dreamland Auditorium&quot;. It served as an ice skating rink that could be converted into a seated entertainment venue. Sometime in the late 1930s the building&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Winterland&quot;, and it successfully operated through the Great Depression. It was built in 1928 for $1 million (equivalent to $ million in ). The New Dreamland was built on the site of the Dreamland Rink (midway on the west side of Steiner between Post and Sutter) and Sid Grauman&#x27;s &quot;National Theatre&quot; (on the corner of Post and Steiner).

In 1936, Winterland began hosting the Shipstads and Johnson Ice Follies. Impresario Clifford C. Fischer staged an authorized production of the Folies Bergère, the &quot;Folies Bergère of 1944&quot;, at the Winterland Ballroom in November 1944. The Ballroom hosted opera, boxing and tennis matches.

==As a music venue==
Starting on September 23, 1966, with a double bill of Jefferson Airplane and the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, Bill Graham began to occasionally rent the venue, which had an audience capacity of 5,400, for larger concerts that his nearby Fillmore Auditorium could not properly accommodate. After closing the Fillmore West in 1971, he began to hold regular weekend shows at Winterland.

Various popular rock acts played there, including such bands and musicians as Bruce Springsteen, the Rolling Stones, the J. Geils Band, the Who, Black Sabbath, James Gang, Kansas, Mahogany Rush, Quicksilver Messenger Service, UFO, REO Speedwagon, Queen, Slade, Boston, Cream, Yes, Fleetwood Mac, Kiss, the Doors, Jimi Hendrix, Steppenwolf, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Styx, Van Morrison, the Allman Brothers Band, Grateful Dead, the Band, Big Brother and the Holding Company (with Janis Joplin), Dan Hicks and His Hot Licks, Neil Young, Jethro Tull, Pink Floyd, Ten Years After, Wishbone Ash, Rush, Electric Light Orchestra, David Bowie, Genesis, Santana, Jefferson Airplane, Sons of Champlin, Sex Pistols, Traffic, Golden Earring, Grand Funk Railroad, Humble Pie, Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band, Robin Trower, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, Sha Na Na, Loggins and Messina, Lee Michaels, Heart, Journey, Deep Purple, J.J. Cale, Spirit, the Chambers Brothers, Alice Cooper, Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention, Foghat, Mountain, B.B. King, Montrose, George Thorogood and the Delaware Destroyers and Elvis Costello. Led Zeppelin first performed their song &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; there.

The Tubes headlined New Year&#x27;s Eve 1975 with Flo and Eddie.

Many of the best-known rock acts from the 1960s and 1970s played at Winterland or played two blocks away across Geary Boulevard at the original Fillmore Auditorium. Peter Frampton recorded parts of the fourth-best-selling live album ever, &quot;Frampton Comes Alive!&quot;, at Winterland. The Grateful Dead made Winterland their home base, and The Band played their last show there on Thanksgiving Day 1976. That concert, featuring numerous guest performers including Neil Young, Eric Clapton, Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, and many others, was filmed by Martin Scorsese and released in theaters and as a soundtrack under the name &quot;The Last Waltz&quot;. Winterland also hosted the Sex Pistols&#x27; final show, on January 14, 1978.

==Final concerts==
During Winterland&#x27;s final month of existence, shows were booked nearly every night. Acts included the Sex Pistols, the Tubes, the Ramones, Smokey Robinson, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, and on December 15–16, 1978, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band. Springsteen&#x27;s December 15 show was broadcast on local radio station KSAN-FM.

Winterland closed on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1978 / New Year&#x27;s Day 1979 with a concert by the Grateful Dead, New Riders of the Purple Sage, and the Blues Brothers. The show lasted over eight hours, with the Grateful Dead&#x27;s performance — documented on DVD and CD as &quot;The Closing of Winterland&quot; — lasting nearly six hours, beginning at midnight with Bill Graham&#x27;s favorite Dead song, &quot;Sugar Magnolia&quot;. After the show, the crowd was treated to a hot, buffet-style champagne breakfast. The final show was simulcast live on radio station KSAN-FM and the local PBS TV station KQED.

Winterland was eventually razed in 1985 and replaced by apartments.

<text>John Smyth (c. 1554 – c. 28 August 1612) was an English Anglican, Baptist, then Mennonite minister and a defender of the principle of religious liberty.

==Early life==
Smyth is thought to have been the son of John Smyth, a yeoman of Sturton-le-Steeple, Nottinghamshire. He was educated locally, most likely under Rev Quipp at Sturton though at the grammar school in Gainsborough has also been suggested. Then he attended in Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he became a Fellow in 1594. Smyth was ordained as an Anglican priest in 1594 in England. 
==Ministry==
He preached in the city of Lincoln in 1600 to 1602. During his time as Lecturer, he held somewhat moderate Puritan views, accepting the set forms of prayer as well as both vocal and instrumental music in church. He was concerned with the influence of recusants throughout the parish, and wrote in support of the Crown&#x27;s authority to govern the church and appoint ecclesiastical magistrates.

In 1607, he broke with the Church of England and left for Holland where he, Thomas Helwys and his small congregation began to study the Bible ardently. He briefly returned to England. In the beginning, Smyth was closely aligned with his Anglican heritage. As time passed, his views evolved. Smyth&#x27;s education at Cambridge included the &quot;trivium&quot; and &quot;quadrivium&quot; which included a heavy emphasis upon Aristotelian logic and metaphysics. Smyth&#x27;s evolving ecclesiology was due to his applying biblical truth about the truth into numerous logical syllogisms.

It was in Holland that Smyth discovered Anabaptist theology and retained its principles, notably on believer&#x27;s baptism by immersion, opposed to infant baptism and the memorial of the last Supper, opposed to consubstantiation and transubstantiation.

In 1608, he published &quot;The Differences of the Churches&quot;, in which he explained the characteristics of a biblical church:

First, Smyth insisted that true worship comes from the heart and that there should be no books other than the Bible in worship. Praying, singing and preaching should be spontaneous only. He did not read the Bible translation during worship, preferring the original language version.

Second, Smyth introduced a twofold church leadership, that of pastor and deacon and said that a church could have several pastors.

Third, the financial support of the church should come only from the members and not from the government, because that would mean giving them control over the church.

In 1609, Smyth, and Thomas Helwys, along with a group in Holland, came to believe in believer&#x27;s baptism (thereby rejecting infant baptism) and they came together to form one of the earliest Baptist churches. He was utterly convinced that believer&#x27;s baptism and a free church gathered by covenant were foundational to the church.

Having been baptized as infants, like the Anabaptists of the Radical Reformation they came to believe they would need to be re-baptized. Since there was no other minister to administer baptism, Smyth baptized himself in 1609 (for which reason he was called &quot;the Se-baptist,&quot; from the Latin word &#x27;[one]self&#x27;) and then with Thomas Helwys proceeded to baptize the Church.

John Clifford as cited in the &quot;General Baptist Magazine&quot;, London, July 1879, vol. 81) records that &quot;[I]n 1606 on March 24. . .this night at midnight elder John Morton baptized John Smyth, vicar of Gainsborough, in the River Don. It was so dark we were obliged to have torch lights. Elder Brewster prayed, Mister Smith made a good confession; walked to Epworth in his cold clothes, but received no harm. The distance was over two miles. All of our friends were present. To the triune God be praise.&quot; This account was later revealed to have been a forgery connected with the rebuilding of the Baptist Church at Crowle, where the church (now closed) still bears a plaque falsely claiming to have been founded in 1599.
It has been suggested by W. T. Whitley that Smyth may have coined such well-known theological terms as Pedobaptist.

In February 1610, Smyth and other church members wrote a letter to a Mennonite community in Waterland to join their movement. This resulted in his excommunication from the church by Thomas Helwys. Smyth and part of the church joined a Mennonite church, while Helwys and part of the church returned to England to found the first permanent Baptist church there, in 1612. The churches that descended from Helwys were of the General Baptist persuasion. Baptist historian Tom J. Nettles argues that Helwys and his group &quot;earned the name General Baptists&quot; because they &quot;claimed that Christ died for all men rather than for the elect only&quot;. This is seen as a step away from fully Calvinist commitments.

==Death==
He died from dysentery on 28 August 1612 in Amsterdam.

<text>Sir Ian Kershaw (born 29 April 1943) is an English historian whose work has chiefly focused on the social history of 20th-century Germany. He is regarded by many as one of the world&#x27;s foremost experts on Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany, and is particularly noted for his biographies of Hitler.

He was a follower of the German historian Martin Broszat, and until his retirement, he was a professor at the University of Sheffield. Kershaw has called Broszat an &quot;inspirational mentor&quot; who did much to shape his understanding of Nazi Germany. Kershaw served as historical adviser on numerous BBC documentaries, notably &quot;The Nazis: A Warning from History&quot; and &quot;War of the Century&quot;. He taught a module titled &quot;Germans against Hitler&quot;.

==Background==
Ian Kershaw was born on 29 April 1943 in Oldham, Lancashire, England, to Joseph Kershaw, a musician, and Alice (Robinson) Kershaw. He was educated at Counthill Grammar School, St Bede&#x27;s College, Manchester, where he was taught by Father Geoffrey Burke the University of Liverpool (BA), and Merton College, Oxford (DPhil). He was originally trained as a medievalist but turned to the study of modern German social history in the 1970s. At first, he was mainly concerned with the economic history of Bolton Abbey. As a lecturer in medieval history at Manchester, Kershaw learned German to study the German peasantry in the Middle Ages. In 1972, he visited Bavaria and was shocked to hear the views of an old man he met in a Munich café who told him: &quot;You English were so foolish. If only you had sided with us. Together we could have defeated Bolshevism and ruled the earth!&quot;—adding in for good measure that &quot;The Jew is a louse!&quot; As a result of this incident, Kershaw became keen to learn how and why ordinary people in Germany could support Nazism.

His wife, Dame Betty Kershaw, is a former professor of nursing and dean of the School of Nursing Studies at the University of Sheffield.

==Bavaria Project==
In 1975, Kershaw joined Martin Broszat&#x27;s &quot;Bavaria Project&quot;. During his work, Broszat encouraged Kershaw to examine how ordinary people viewed Hitler. As a result of his work in the 1970s on Broszat&#x27;s &quot;Bavaria Project&quot;, Kershaw wrote his first book on Nazi Germany, &quot;The &quot;Hitler Myth&quot;: Image and Reality in the Third Reich&quot;, which was first published in German in 1980 as &quot;Der Hitler-Mythos: Volksmeinung und Propaganda im Dritten Reich&quot;. This book examined the &quot;Hitler cult&quot; in Germany, how it was developed by Joseph Goebbels, what social groups the Hitler Myth appealed to and how it rose and fell.

Also arising from the &quot;Bavaria Project&quot; and Kershaw&#x27;s work in the field of &quot;Alltagsgeschichte&quot; (&#x27;everyday history&#x27;) was &quot;Popular Opinion and Political Dissent in the Third Reich&quot;. In this 1983 book, Kershaw examined the experience of the Nazi era at the grass-roots in Bavaria. Kershaw showed how ordinary people reacted to the Nazi dictatorship, looking at how people conformed to the regime and to the extent and limits of dissent. Kershaw described his subject as ordinary Bavarians: the muddled majority, neither full-hearted Nazis nor outright opponents, whose attitudes at one and the same time betray signs of Nazi ideological penetration and yet show the clear limits of propaganda manipulation. Kershaw went on to write in his preface:I should like to think that had I been around at the time I would have been a convinced anti-Nazi engaged in the underground resistance fight. However, I know really that I would have been as confused and felt as helpless as most of the people I am writing about.

Kershaw argued that Goebbels failed to create the &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot; (people&#x27;s community) of Nazi propaganda, and that most Bavarians were far more interested in their day-to-day lives than in politics during the Third Reich. Kershaw concluded that the majority of Bavarians were either antisemitic or more commonly simply did not care about what was happening to the Jews. Kershaw also concluded that there was a fundamental difference between the antisemitism of the majority of ordinary people, who disliked Jews and were much coloured by traditional Catholic prejudices, and the ideological and far more radical &quot;völkische&quot; antisemitism of the Nazi Party, who hated Jews.

Kershaw found that the majority of Bavarians disapproved of the violence of the &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; pogrom, and that despite the efforts of the Nazis, continued to maintain social relations with members of the Bavarian Jewish community. Kershaw documented numerous campaigns on the part of the Nazi Party to increase antisemitic hatred, and noted that the overwhelming majority of antisemitic activities in Bavaria were the work of a small number of committed Nazi Party members. Overall, Kershaw noted that the popular mood towards Jews was indifference to their fate. Kershaw argued that during World War II, most Bavarians were vaguely aware of the Holocaust, but were vastly more concerned about and interested in the war than about the &quot;Final Solution to the Jewish Question&quot;, making the notable claim that &quot;the road to Auschwitz was built by hate, but paved with indifference.&quot;

Kershaw&#x27;s assessment that most Bavarians, and by implication Germans, were &quot;indifferent&quot; to the &quot;Shoah&quot; faced criticism from the Israeli historian Otto Dov Kulka and the Canadian historian Michael Kater. Kater contended that Kershaw downplayed the extent of popular antisemitism, and that though admitting that most of the &quot;spontaneous&quot; antisemitic actions of Nazi Germany were staged, argued that because these actions involved substantial numbers of Germans, it is wrong to see the extreme antisemitism of the Nazis as coming solely from above.

Kulka argued that most Germans were more antisemitic than Kershaw portrayed them in &quot;Popular Opinion and Political Dissent in the Third Reich&quot;, and that rather than &quot;indifference&quot; &quot;passive complicity&quot; would be a better term to describe the reaction of the German people to the &quot;Shoah&quot;.

==&quot;The Nazi Dictatorship&quot;==
In 1985, Kershaw published a book on the historiography of Nazi Germany, &quot;The Nazi Dictatorship: Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation&quot;, in which he reflected on the problems in historiography of the Nazi era. Kershaw noted the huge disparity of often incompatible views about the Nazi era such as the debate between:
* those who see the Nazi period as the culmination of &quot;Deutschtum&quot; (Germanism) and Marxists who see Nazism as the culmination of capitalism
* those who argue for a &quot;Sonderweg&quot; (distinct path of German post-medieval development), and those who argue against the &quot;Sonderweg&quot; concept
* those who see Nazism as a type of totalitarianism, and those who see it as a type of fascism
* those historians who favour a &quot;functionalist&quot; interpretation with the emphasis on the German bureaucracy and the Holocaust as an &quot;ad hoc&quot; process, and those who favour an &quot;intentionalist&quot; interpretation with the focus on Hitler and the argument that the Holocaust had been something planned from early on in Hitler&#x27;s political career.

As Kershaw noted, these divergent interpretations such as the differences between the functionalist view of the Holocaust as caused by a process and the intentionalist view of the Holocaust as caused by a plan are not easily reconciled, and that there was in his opinion the need for a guide to explain the complex historiography surrounding these issues.

If one accepts the Marxist view of Nazism as the culmination of capitalism, then the Nazi phenomenon is universal, and fascism can come to power in any society where capitalism is the dominant economic system, whereas the view of Nazism as the culmination of &quot;Deutschtum&quot; means that the Nazi phenomenon is local and particular only to Germany. For Kershaw, any historian writing about the period had to take account of the &quot;historical-philosophical&quot;, &quot;political-ideological&quot; and moral problems associated with the period, which thus poses special challenges for the historian. In &quot;The Nazi Dictatorship&quot;, Kershaw surveyed the historical literature and offered his own assessment of the pros and cons of the various approaches. In the 2015 edition of &quot;The Nazi Dictatorship&quot;, Kershaw, although he acknowledged plausible objections to the application of a common &quot;totalitarianism&quot; paradigm to both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, agreed with those who have generally made these criticisms &quot;that it is in itself a wholly legitimate exercise, whatever essential differences existed in ideology and socio-economic structures, to compare the forms and techniques of rule in Germany under Hitler and the Soviet Union under Stalin&quot;.

In a 2008 interview, Kershaw lists as his major intellectual influences Martin Broszat, Hans Mommsen, Alan Milward, Timothy Mason, Hans-Ulrich Wehler, William Carr, and Jeremy Noakes. In the same interview, Kershaw expressed strong approval of Mason&#x27;s &quot;Primacy of Politics&quot; concept, in which it was German Big Business that served the Nazi regime rather than the other way around, against the orthodox Marxist &quot;Primacy of Economics&quot; concept. Despite his praise and admiration for Mason, in the 2000 edition of &quot;The Nazi Dictatorship&quot;, Kershaw was highly skeptical of Mason&#x27;s &quot;Flight into War&quot; theory of an economic crisis in 1939 forcing the Nazi regime into war.

In the &quot;Historikerstreit&quot; (Historians&#x27; Dispute) of 1986–1989, Kershaw followed Broszat in criticising the work and views of Ernst Nolte, Andreas Hillgruber, Michael Stürmer, Joachim Fest and Klaus Hildebrand, all of whom Kershaw saw as attempting to white-wash the German past in various ways. In the 1989 edition of &quot;The Nazi Dictatorship&quot;, Kershaw devoted a chapter towards rebutting the views of Nolte, Hillgruber, Fest, Hildebrand, and Stürmer. In regard to the debate between those who regard Nazism as a type of totalitarianism (and thus having more in common with the Soviet Union) versus those who regard Nazism as a type of fascism (and thus having more in common with Fascist Italy), Kershaw, though feeling that the totalitarianism approach is not without value, has argued that in essence, Nazism should be viewed as a type of fascism, albeit fascism of a very radical type. Writing of the &quot;Sonderweg&quot; debate, Kershaw finds the moderate &quot;Sonderweg&quot; approach of Jürgen Kocka the most satisfactory historical explanation for why the Nazi era occurred. In the 2000 edition of &quot;The Nazi Dictatorship&quot;, Kershaw wrote a scathing criticism of Gerhard Ritter&#x27;s claim that one &quot;madman&quot; (i.e. Hitler) &quot;single-handedly&quot; caused the Second World War in Europe, and added that he found the historical approach of Ritter&#x27;s arch-enemy Fritz Fischer to be a far better way of understanding and recoiling German history. Along the same lines, Kershaw criticised the 1946 statement by the German historian Friedrich Meinecke that Nazism was just a particularly unfortunate &quot;Betriebsunfall&quot; (industrial accident) of history.

Kershaw was later in a 2003 essay to criticise Ritter and Meinecke, stating that by their promotion of the &quot;Betriebsunfall&quot; theory or by blaming everything upon Hitler, they were seeking to white-wash the German past. Writing of the work of the German historian Rainer Zitelmann, Kershaw has argued that Zitelmann has elevated what were merely secondary considerations in Hitler&#x27;s remarks to the primary level, and that Zitelmann has not offered a clear definition of what he means by &quot;modernization&quot;.

With regard to the Nazi foreign policy debate between &quot;globalists&quot; such as Klaus Hildebrand, Andreas Hillgruber, Jochen Thies, Gunter Moltman and Gerhard Weinberg, who argue that Germany aimed at world conquest, and the &quot;continentalists&quot; such as Hugh Trevor-Roper, Eberhard Jäckel and Axel Kuhn, who argue that Germany aimed only at the conquest of Europe, Kershaw tends towards the &quot;continental&quot; position. Kershaw agrees with the thesis that Hitler did formulate a programme for foreign policy based on an alliance with Britain to achieve the destruction of the Soviet Union, but has argued that a British lack of interest doomed the project, thus leading to the situation in 1939, where Hitler went to war with Britain, the country he wanted as an ally, not as an enemy, and the country he wanted as an enemy, the Soviet Union, as his ally. At the same time, Kershaw sees considerable merit in the work of such historians as Timothy Mason, Hans Mommsen, Martin Broszat and Wolfgang Schieder, who argue that Hitler had no &quot;programme&quot; in foreign policy, and instead contend that his foreign policy was simply a kneejerk reaction to domestic pressures in the economy and his need to maintain his popularity.

Regarding the historical debates about &quot;Widerstand&quot; (resistance) in German society, Kershaw has argued that there are two approaches to the question, one of which he calls the &quot;fundamentalist&quot; (dealing with those committed to overthrowing the Nazi regime) and the other the &quot;societal&quot; (dealing with forms of dissent in &quot;everyday life&quot;). In Kershaw&#x27;s view, Broszat&#x27;s &quot;Resistenz&quot; (immunity) concept works well in an &quot;Alltagsgeschichte&quot; approach, but works less well in the field of high politics, and by focusing only on the &quot;effect&quot; of one&#x27;s actions, fails to consider the crucial element of the &quot;intention&quot; behind one&#x27;s actions. Kershaw has argued that the term &quot;Widerstand&quot; should be used only for those working for the total overthrow of the Nazi system, and those engaging in behaviour that was counter to the regime&#x27;s wishes without seeking to overthrow the regime should be included under the terms opposition and dissent, depending upon their motives and actions. In Kershaw&#x27;s opinion, there were three bands ranging from dissent to opposition to resistance. Kershaw has used the Edelweiss Pirates as an example of a group whose behavior initially fell under dissent, and who advanced from there to opposition and finally to resistance.

In Kershaw&#x27;s view, there was much dissent and opposition within German society, but outside of the working class, very little resistance. Although Kershaw has argued that the &quot;Resistenz&quot; (immunity [against indoctrination]) concept has much merit, he concluded that the Nazi regime had a broad basis of support and it is correct to speak of &quot;resistance without the people&quot;.

The debate in the late 1980s between Martin Broszat and Saul Friedländer over Broszat&#x27;s call for the &quot;historicization&quot; of Nazism, Kershaw wrote that he agreed with Friedländer that the Nazi period could not be treated as a &quot;normal&quot; period of history, but he felt that historians should approach the Nazi period as they would any other period of history. In support of Broszat, Kershaw wrote that an &quot;Alltagsgeschichte&quot; approach to German history, provided that it did not lose sight of Nazi crimes, had much to offer as a way of understanding how those crimes occurred.

During the &quot;Goldhagen Controversy&quot; of 1996, Kershaw took the view that his friend, Hans Mommsen, had &quot;destroyed&quot; Daniel Goldhagen&#x27;s arguments about a culture of &quot;eliminationist antisemitism&quot; in Germany during their frequent debates on German TV. Kershaw wrote that he agreed with Eberhard Jäckel&#x27;s assessment that &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Willing Executioners&quot; was &quot;simply a bad book&quot;. Though Kershaw had little positive to say about Goldhagen, he wrote that he felt that Norman Finkelstein&#x27;s attack on Goldhagen had been over-the-top and did little to help historical understanding. Kershaw later went on to recommend Norman Finkelstein and Ruth Bettina Birn&#x27;s extremely critical assessment of Goldhagen&#x27;s book, &quot;A Nation on Trial: The Goldhagen Thesis and Historical Truth&quot;; stating that &quot;Finkelstein and Birn provide a devastating critique of Daniel Goldhagen&#x27;s simplistic and misleading interpretation of the Holocaust. Their contribution to the debate is, in my view, indispensable&quot;.

==Structuralist views==
Like Broszat, Kershaw sees the structures of the Nazi state as far more important than the personality of Hitler (or any one else) as an explanation for the way Nazi Germany developed. Kershaw subscribes to the view argued by Broszat and the German historian Hans Mommsen that Nazi Germany was a chaotic collection of rival bureaucracies in perpetual power struggles with each other. In Kershaw&#x27;s view, the Nazi dictatorship was not a totalitarian monolith, but rather an unstable coalition of several blocs in a &quot;power cartel&quot; comprising the NSDAP, big business, the German state bureaucracy, the Army and SS/police agencies (and each of the &quot;power blocs&quot; was divided into factions). In Kershaw&#x27;s opinion, the more &quot;radical&quot; blocs such as the SS/police and the Nazi Party gained increasing ascendancy over the other blocs after the 1936 economic crisis, and then increased their power at the expense of the other blocs.

For Kershaw, the real significance of Hitler lies not in him, but rather in the German people&#x27;s perception of him. In his biography of Hitler, Kershaw presented him as the ultimate &quot;unperson&quot;; a boring, pedestrian man devoid of even the &quot;negative greatness&quot; attributed to him by Joachim Fest. Kershaw rejects the great man theory of history and has criticised those who seek to explain everything that happened in Nazi Germany as the result of Hitler&#x27;s will and intentions. Kershaw has argued that it is absurd to seek to explain German history in the Nazi era solely through Hitler, as Germany had sixty-eight million people and to seek to explain the fate of sixty-eight million people solely through the prism of one man is in Kershaw&#x27;s opinion a flawed position.

Kershaw wrote about the problems of an excessive focus on Hitler that &quot;even the best biographies have seemed at times in danger of elevating Hitler&#x27;s personal power to a level where the history of Germany between 1933 and 1945 becomes reduced to little more than an expression of the dictator&#x27;s will&quot;. Kershaw has a low opinion of those who seek to provide &quot;personalized&quot; theories about the Holocaust and/or World War II as due to some defect, medical or otherwise, in Hitler. In his 2000 edition of &quot;The Nazi Dictatorship&quot;, Kershaw quoted with approval the dismissive remarks made by the German historian Hans-Ulrich Wehler in 1980 about such theories. Wehler wrote

Does our understanding of National Socialist policies really depend on whether Hitler had only one testicle? ... Perhaps the Führer had three, which made things difficult for him, who knows? ... Even if Hitler could be regarded irrefutably as a sadomasochist, which scientific interest does that further? ... Does the &quot;Final Solution of the Jewish Question&quot; thus become more easily understandable or the &quot;twisted road to Auschwitz&quot; become the one-way street of a psychopath in power?

Kershaw shares Wehler&#x27;s opinion, that, besides the problem that such theories about Hitler&#x27;s medical condition were extremely difficult to prove, they had the effect of personalising the phenomena of Nazi Germany by more or less attributing everything that happened in Nazi Germany to one flawed individual.

Kershaw&#x27;s biography of Hitler is an examination of Hitler&#x27;s power; how he obtained it and how he maintained it. Following up on ideas that he had first introduced in a 1991 book about Hitler, Kershaw has argued that Hitler&#x27;s leadership is a model example of Max Weber&#x27;s theory of charismatic leadership. Kershaw&#x27;s 1991 book &quot;Hitler: A Profile in Power&quot; marked a change for him from writing about how people viewed Hitler to writing about Hitler. In his two-volume biography of Hitler published in 1998 and 2000, Kershaw stated, &quot;What I tried to do was to embed Hitler into the social and political context that I had already studied.&quot; Kershaw finds the picture of Hitler as a &quot;mountebank&quot; (opportunistic adventurer) in Alan Bullock&#x27;s biography unsatisfactory, and Joachim Fest&#x27;s quest to determine how &quot;great&quot; Hitler was senseless. In a wider sense, Kershaw sees the Nazi regime as part of a broader crisis that afflicted European society from 1914 to 1945. Though in disagreement with many of their claims (especially Nolte&#x27;s), Kershaw&#x27;s concept of a &quot;Second Thirty Years&#x27; War&quot; reflects many similarities with Ernst Nolte, A. J. P. Taylor and Arno J. Mayer who have also advanced the concept of a &quot;Thirty Years&#x27; Crisis&quot; to explain European history between 1914 and 1945.

===Functionalism–intentionalism debate===
In the functionalism versus intentionalism debate, Kershaw has argued for a synthesis of the two schools, though leaning towards the functionalist school. Despite some disagreements, Kershaw has called Mommsen a &quot;good personal friend&quot; and an &quot;important further vital stimulus to my own work on Nazism&quot;. Kershaw has argued in his two-volume biography of Hitler that Hitler did play a decisive role in the development of policies of genocide, but also argued that many of the measures that led to the Holocaust were undertaken by many lower-ranking officials without direct orders from Hitler in the expectation that such steps would win them favour. Though Kershaw does not deny the radical antisemitism of the Nazis, he favours Mommsen&#x27;s view of the Holocaust being caused by the &quot;cumulative radicalization&quot; of Nazi Germany caused by the endless bureaucratic power struggles and a turn towards increasingly radical antisemitism within the Nazi elite.

Despite his background in the functionalist historiography, Kershaw admits that his account of Hitler in World War II owes much to intentionalist historians like Gerhard Weinberg, Hugh Trevor-Roper, Lucy Dawidowicz and Eberhard Jäckel. Kershaw accepts the picture of Hitler drawn by intentionalist historians as a fanatical ideologue who was obsessed with social Darwinism, &quot;völkisch&quot; antisemitism (in which the Jewish people were viewed as a &quot;race&quot; biologically different from the rest of humanity rather than a religion), militarism and the perceived need for &quot;Lebensraum&quot;.

In a 1992 essay, &quot;Improvised genocide?&quot;, in which Kershaw traces how the ethnic cleansing campaign of &quot;Gauleiter&quot; Arthur Greiser in the Warthegau region annexed to Germany from Poland in 1939 led to a campaign of genocide by 1941, Kershaw argued that the process was indeed &quot;improvised genocide&quot; rather than the fulfilment of a master plan. Kershaw views the Holocaust not as a plan, as argued by the intentionalists, but rather a process caused by the &quot;cumulative radicalization&quot; of the Nazi state as articulated by the functionalists. Citing the work of the American historian Christopher Browning in his biography of Hitler, Kershaw argues that in the period 1939–1941 the phrase &quot;Final Solution to the Jewish Question&quot; was a &quot;territorial solution&quot;, that such plans as the Nisko Plan and Madagascar Plan were serious and only in the latter half of 1941 did the phrase &quot;Final Solution&quot; come to refer to genocide. This view of the Holocaust as a process rather than a plan is the antithesis of the extreme intentionalist approach as advocated by Lucy Dawidowicz, who argues that Hitler had decided upon genocide as early as November 1918, and that everything he did was directed towards that goal.

==&quot;Working Towards the Führer&quot; concept==
Kershaw disagrees with Mommsen&#x27;s &quot;Weak Dictator&quot; thesis: the idea that Hitler was a relatively unimportant player in Nazi Germany. He has agreed with his idea that Hitler did not play much of a role in the day-to-day administration of the government of Nazi Germany. Kershaw&#x27;s way of explaining this paradox is his theory of &quot;Working Towards the Führer&quot;, the phrase being taken from a 1934 speech by the Prussian civil servant Werner Willikens:

Everyone who has the opportunity to observe it knows that the Fuhrer can hardly dictate from above everything which he intends to realize sooner or later. On the contrary, up till now, everyone with a post in the new Germany has worked best when he has, so to speak, worked towards the Fuhrer. Very often and in many spheres, it has been the case—in previous years as well—that individuals have simply waited for orders and instructions. Unfortunately, the same will be true in the future; but in fact, it is the duty of everybody to try to work towards the Fuhrer along the lines he would wish. Anyone who makes mistakes will notice it soon enough. But anyone who really works towards the Fuhrer along his lines and towards his goal will certainly both now and in the future, one day have the finest reward in the form of the sudden legal confirmation of his work.

Kershaw has argued that in Nazi Germany officials of the German state and Party bureaucracy usually took the initiative in initiating policy to meet Hitler&#x27;s perceived wishes, or alternatively attempted to turn into policy Hitler&#x27;s often loosely and indistinctly phrased wishes. Though Kershaw does agree that Hitler possessed the powers that the &quot;Master of the Third Reich&quot; thesis championed by Norman Rich and Karl Dietrich Bracher would suggest, he has argued that Hitler was a &quot;lazy dictator&quot;, an indifferent dictator who was really not interested in involving himself much in the daily running of Nazi Germany. The only exceptions were the areas of foreign policy and military decisions, both areas that Hitler increasingly involved himself in from the late 1930s.

In a 1993 essay &quot;Working Towards the Führer&quot;, Kershaw argued that the German and Soviet dictatorships had more differences than similarities. Kershaw argued that Hitler was a very unbureaucratic leader who was highly averse to paperwork, in marked contrast to Joseph Stalin. Kershaw argued that Stalin was highly involved in the running of the Soviet Union, in contrast to Hitler whose involvement in day-to-day decision making was limited, infrequent and capricious. Kershaw argued that the Soviet regime, despite its extreme brutality and ruthlessness, was basically rational in its goal of seeking to modernise a backward country and had no equivalent of the &quot;cumulative radicalization&quot; towards increasingly irrational goals that Kershaw sees as characteristic of Nazi Germany. In Kershaw&#x27;s opinion, Stalin&#x27;s power corresponded to Max Weber&#x27;s category of bureaucratic authority, whereas Hitler&#x27;s power corresponded to Weber&#x27;s category of charismatic authority.

In Kershaw&#x27;s view, what happened in Germany after 1933 was the imposition of Hitler&#x27;s charismatic authority on top of the &quot;legal-rational&quot; authority system that had existed prior to 1933, leading to a gradual breakdown of any system of ordered authority in Germany. Kershaw argues that by 1938 the German state had been reduced to a hopeless, polycratic shambles of rival agencies all competing with each other for Hitler&#x27;s favour, which by that time had become the only source of political legitimacy. Kershaw sees this rivalry as causing the &quot;cumulative radicalization&quot; of Germany, and argues that though Hitler always favoured the most radical solution to any problem, it was German officials who, for the most part, in attempting to win the Führer&#x27;s approval, carried out on their initiative, increasingly &quot;radical&quot; solutions to perceived problems like the &quot;Jewish Question&quot;, as opposed to being ordered to do so by Hitler. In this, Kershaw largely agrees with Mommsen&#x27;s portrait of Hitler as a distant and remote leader standing in many ways above his system, whose charisma and ideas served to set the general tone of politics.

As an example of how Hitler&#x27;s power functioned, Kershaw used Hitler&#x27;s directive to the &quot;Gauleiters&quot; Albert Forster and Arthur Greiser to &quot;Germanize&quot; the part of north-western Poland annexed to Germany in 1939 within the next 10 years with his promise that &quot;no questions would be asked&quot; about how this would be done. As Kershaw notes, the different ways Forster and Greiser sought to &quot;Germanize&quot; their &quot;Gaue&quot; – with Forster simply having the local Polish population in his &quot;Gau&quot; signing forms saying they had &quot;German blood&quot;, and Greiser carrying out a program of brutal ethnic cleansing of Poles in his &quot;Gau&quot; – showed both how Hitler set events in motion, and how his &quot;Gauleiters&quot; could use different methods in pursuit of what they believed to be Hitler&#x27;s wishes. In Kershaw&#x27;s opinion, Hitler&#x27;s vision of a racially cleansed &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot; provided the impetus for German officials to carry out increasingly extreme measures to win his approval, which ended with the Holocaust.

The Israeli historian Otto Dov Kulka has praised the concept of &quot;working towards the Führer&quot; as the best way of understanding how the Holocaust occurred, combining the best features and avoiding the weaknesses of both the &quot;functionalist&quot; and &quot;intentionalist&quot; theories.

For Kershaw, Hitler held absolute power in Nazi Germany due to the &quot;erosion of collective government in Germany&quot;, but his power over domestic politics became more challenging to exercise due to his preoccupation with military affairs, and the rival fiefdoms of the Nazi state fought each other and attempted to carry out Hitler&#x27;s vaguely worded wishes and dimly defined orders by &quot;Working Towards the Führer&quot;.

<doc id="1170714" wikidata="Q3671775" url="?curid=1170714" title="Fore!">
<text>Fore! is the fourth studio album by American rock band Huey Lewis and the News, released on August 20, 1986. The album was a commercial success, peaking at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and went on to score five top-ten &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles, including the number-one hits &quot;Stuck with You&quot; and &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot;. The album was certified three-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.

== Music and lyrics ==
&quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot; was originally meant for a Bruce Hornsby album that Huey Lewis was producing. Hornsby did not like the arrangement his band played, and it was given to Lewis.

&quot;Doing It All for My Baby&quot; was written by Mike Duke and Phil Cody. Duke wrote the song and then recorded vocals himself (the band playing backing parts and instruments), with the intention of getting a record contract for his own solo career. When that plan fell through, Lewis decided to record a version with his own vocals for the album.

Lewis stated he originally wrote the lyrics for &quot;Hip to Be Square&quot; in a third person perspective, &quot;He used to be a renegade...&quot; He referenced the book &quot;Bobos in Paradise&quot; in describing the song&#x27;s inspiration, explaining that the song was about the &quot;phenomenon where people from the &#x27;60s started to drop back in, cut their hair, work out, that kind of crap, but they kept their bohemian tastes. ... bourgeois bohemians.&quot; Lewis later modified the lyrics to be in the first person as he believed it would enhance the joke, but stated this had unintentionally led to the interpretation of the song as an &quot;anthem for square people&quot;.

According to Lewis, the album track &quot;Forest for the Trees&quot; was written for and about kids struggling with life issues as an uplifting message for them. Lewis based it off the letters he received from young fans at the time who would talk about how important his music was to them.

&quot;The Power of Love&quot;, originally from the soundtrack of the 1985 film &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, is included as a bonus track on international editions of the album. The song was the band&#x27;s first chart-topper on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The critical reception of the album was mixed with Glenn O&#x27;Brien in Spin noting that &#x27;what saves it for me is that songs are good songs. And Huey still sings with heart and soul&#x27;.

==Album cover==
The wall that Lewis and the members of the band stand against on the album&#x27;s cover is a wall from Tamalpais High School in Mill Valley, California. Band members Bill Gibson, Sean Hopper and Mario Cipollina went to this school together.

== In popular culture ==
The album is referenced in the film &quot;American Psycho.&quot; The main character Patrick Bateman, while talking to one of his potential victims, gives a review of the album, discussing the band&#x27;s viewpoint, intent, and how specifically the song &quot;Hip to Be Square&quot; espouses &quot;the pleasures of conformity&quot; but with a catchy 1980s beat, going on to state it is &quot;the group&#x27;s most accomplished album&quot;.

<doc id="1170723" wikidata="Q34097" url="?curid=1170723" title="Tokelauan language">
<text>Tokelauan () is a Polynesian language spoken in Tokelau and historically by the small population of Swains Island (or Olohega) in American Samoa. It is closely related to Tuvaluan and is related to Samoan and other Polynesian languages. Tokelauan has a co-official status with English in Tokelau. There are approximately 4,260 speakers of Tokelauan, of whom 2,100 live in New Zealand, 1,400 in Tokelau, and 17 in Swains Island. &quot;Tokelau&quot; means &quot;north-northeast&quot;.

Loimata Iupati, Tokelau&#x27;s resident Director of Education, has stated that he is in the process of translating the Bible from English into Tokelauan.
While many Tokelau residents are multilingual, Tokelauan was the language of day-to-day affairs in Tokelau until at least the 1990s, and is spoken by 88% of Tokelauan residents. Of the 4600 people who speak the language, 1600 of them live in the three atolls of Tokelau – Atafu, Nukunonu and Fakaofo. Approximately 3000 people in New Zealand speak Tokelauan, and the rest of the known Tokelauan speakers are spread across Australia, Hawaii, and the West Coast of the United States. The Tokelauan language closely resembles its more widely spoken and close genealogical relative, Samoan; the two maintain a degree of mutual intelligibility.

== Tokelauan language documentation ==
Horatio Hale was the first person to publish a Tokelauan dictionary of sorts, which he did in 1846. Rather than being the accepted definition of dictionary, it was a reference that only contained 214 entries of vocabulary. Hale&#x27;s publication remained the only published Tokelauan reference until 1969. However, Tokelauan had been instituted into schools in the late 1940s; prior to the publication, there was not much headway made in the teaching of the language. In 1969, the New Zealand Department of Education published D. W. Boardman&#x27;s Tokelau-English Vocabulary. This second, more advanced reference was a collection of around 1200 vocabulary entries. In the times that passed after the second publication, the necessity of a more detailed and in depth reference to the language for the purpose of education with the Tokelauan community was realized by Hosea Kirifi (who later became the first Tokelau Director of Education) and J. H. Webster. In the year 1975, Kirifi and Webster published the first official precursory Tokelauan dictionary, which contained an estimated 3000 items, called the Tokelau-English Dictionary. This entire movement was based on the fact that the Tokelauan people take a great deal of pride in their language. Tokelauan schools lacked an abundance of resources and materials that could be used to educate their children on the language. It has a high place in their culture, and the revitalization and renewal of the language for their younger generation had eventually reached a point where action had to be taken. One year after the publication of the 1975 Tokelau-English Dictionary, the government approved the installation of Ropati Simona who was to head the Tokelau Dictionary Project. This eventually led to the publication of the first comprehensive Tokelauan dictionary, Tokelau Dictionary by the Office of Tokelau Affairs in 1986.

== Tokelauan background ==
Tokelau is a dependency of New Zealand and has three main parts, which consist of atolls: Atafu, Nukunonu, and Fakaofo. Together these three atolls lie about two hundred sixty nautical miles away from Samoa. The three atolls of Tokelau are also known as the Duke of York, Duke of Clarence, and D&#x27;Wolf or Bowditch, respectively (on old maps). Together, they are known as The Union Islands, The Union Group, and as the Tokelau Islands. Tokelau&#x27;s language, Tokelauan, belongs to the Austronesian language family and is considered to be part of the subgroup of Polynesian languages. More than half of the speakers of the Tokelauan language reside in New Zealand, about thirty percent live in either Atafu, Nukuonono, or Fakaofo, and a minority live in Australia (geographically close to New Zealand) and states in the United States that touch the Pacific Ocean (Hawaii and other western states part of the mainland). Since Tokelau lies very close to Samoa, it is common to think that the Tokelauan language has some Samoan language influences, but due to the lack in extensive documentation, it is inaccurate to assume such a thing. Tokelauan was still only considered to be a spoken language up until the 1960s. During the 1960s schools began teaching their peoples how to read and write their own language. Short works were also produced in Tokelauan. Additionally, it was common for adults to be fluent in Samoan and Tokelauan. The Tokelauan language is small, and has always been fairly small, even before the Europeans invaded, because of the limited resources that each atoll had, which limited the number of people that could be supported on each.

==Phonology and orthography==
To indicate whether a vowel is read short or long, Tokelauan language denotes a long vowel with a macron over the letter symbol. A macron is a horizontal line.

However, not all Tokelauan speaking peoples agree with the use of the macron. Those residing in the three atolls of Tokelau are known to have shown much resistance to the macron, while the Tokelauan speakers of New Zealand are more open and accepting of adopting the use of this linguistic symbol.


There are some phonetic similarities between sounds in the language, such as /h/ and /ɸ/, which results in some variation in orthographic practice. For example, and both mean goodbye but can be pronounced differently. The sounds for h, s, f and wh can all be used interchangeably. There are two dialects in Polynesia, which has shaped the Tokelauan language to sound how it does. The h and wh sounds are from the older dialect, while the f and s sounds are from the newer one. The fact that all these sounds are interchangeable regardless of when it arrived at the islands suggests that no one dialect surpassed the other. Although Tokelauan is closely related to the Samoan language, there is a distinct difference between their pronunciation of words. For example, Samoan words containing the k sound can sound like g with words such as often mistakenly heard as . Tokelauan language does not allow the k&#x27;s to drop.

Tokelauan is written in the Latin script, albeit using only 15 letters: 
A, E, I, O, U, F, G, K, L, M, N, P, H, T, and V.

Although there is not a lot of available systemic data for Tokelauan word stressing, linguistics have developed three rules relating word stress and vowels based upon some previous evidence. The first rule is that a long vowel will receive the main stress. Secondly, with some exceptions to rule number one, the second to last vowel would bear the main stress (if the long vowel is not the main stress). And thirdly, words do not lose their normal stress when compounded with another word. Furthermore, monosyllabic grammatical morphemes are left unstressed.

== Types of sentences ==
Similarly to English, each Tokelauan clause has a predicate. There are five types of predicate including verbal, locative, existential, possessive, and nominal. Each predicate is available for an interrogative and declarative statement, and can also have multiple predicates conjoined.

=== Verbal Predicates ===

A verbal phrase will follow a verbal clause.

(An evaluative predicate can and usually does occur with no argument.)

=== Locative Predicates ===

Preposition and a noun phrase following a tense-aspect particle.

== Possessive pronouns ==
Below is a table displaying the predicative possessive pronouns in the Tokelauan language.


Shown below is a table showing Tokelauan premodifying possessive pronouns.


== Articles == 
There are two articles that are used in the English language. These articles are &quot;the&quot; and &quot;a/an&quot;. The usage for the word &quot;the&quot; when speaking of a noun is strictly reserved for the case in which the receiver of the word should be aware of its context, or if said item has been referred to previously. This is because in English, the word &quot;the&quot; acts as what is known as a definite article, meaning that a defined object or person is being spoken of. However, in the case of definite article usage in Tokelauan language, if the speaker is speaking of an item in the same manner as the English languages uses &quot;the&quot;, they need not to have referred to it previously so long as the item is specific. The same can be said for the reference of singular being. Because of the difference in grammatical ruling, although the definite article in the Tokelauan language is &quot;te&quot;, it is very common for it to translate to the English indefinite article &quot;a&quot;. An indefinite article is used when there is no specification of the noun being referred to. The usage of the word &quot;he&quot;, the indefinite article in Tokelauan is &#x27;any such item&#x27;. In negative statements the word &quot;he&quot; is used because that is where it is most often found, as well as when phrasing a question. However, it is important to remember that just because these two types of statements are where &quot;he&quot; occurs the greatest it does not mean that &quot;he&quot; does not occur in other types of statements as well. Examples of both &quot;te&quot; and &quot;he&quot; are as such:

: Tokelauan: &quot;Kua hau te tino&quot;
: English: &#x27;A man has arrived&#x27; or &#x27;The man has arrived&#x27;
: (Notice how te in Tokelauan has been translated to both a and the in English.)

: Tokelauan: &quot;Vili ake oi k&#x27;aumai he toki&quot;
: English: &#x27;Do run and bring me an axe&#x27;

The use of &quot;he&quot; and &quot;te&quot; in Tokelauan are reserved for when describing a singular noun. When describing a plural noun, different articles are used. For plural definite nouns, &quot;nā&quot; is the article that is used. However, in some cases, rather than using &quot;nā&quot;, plural definite nouns are subject to the absence of an article represented by &quot;0&quot;. The absence of an article is usually used if a large amount or a specific class of things are being described. An example of an exception to this commonality would be if one was describing an entire class of things, but in a nonspecific way. In this case, rather than &quot;nā&quot; as the article, the singular definite noun te would be used. The article &quot;ni&quot; is used for describing a plural indefinite noun. Examples of &quot;nā&quot;, a &quot;0&quot; exception, and &quot;ni&quot; are as such:

: Tokelauan: &quot;Vili ake oi k&#x27;aumai nā nofoa&quot;
: English: &#x27;Do run and bring me the chairs&#x27;

: Tokelauan: &quot;Ko te povi e kai mutia&quot;
: English: &#x27;Cows eat grass&#x27;
: (&#x27;Ko&#x27; in this sentence acts as a preposition to &#x27;te&#x27;.)

: Tokelauan: &quot;E i ei ni tuhi?&quot;
: English: Are there any books?

(Notice that this is the use of an indefinite article in an interrogative statement. As mentioned above, the use of indefinite articles in these types of statements is very common.)

== Particles ==
The particles of the Tokelauan language are &quot;ia&quot;, &quot;a&quot; (or ā), &quot;a te&quot;, and &quot;ia te&quot;. When describing personal names as well as the names of the month, pronouns (the use here is optional and it is most commonly used when there are words in between the pronoun and verb), and collaborative nouns that describe a group of people working together the most common particle is used. This particle is &quot;ia&quot;, which is used so long as none of the nouns listed above follow the prepositions &quot;e&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, or &quot;ko&quot;. When the subject of a sentence is a locative or name of a place, &quot;ia&quot; is also used as the particle in those particular, as well as other specific instances. The particle &quot;a&quot; is used before a person&#x27;s name as well as the names of months and the particle &quot;a te&quot; is used before pronouns when these instances are following the prepositions &quot;i&quot; or &quot;ki&quot;. If describing a pronoun and using the preposition &quot;mai&quot;, the article that follows is &quot;ia te&quot;.

==Morphology==
There are four main classes of lexemes in the Tokelauan language, and are as follows:

# Noun - A lexeme formed directly after a determiner or possessive pronoun to create a noun phrase
#* These can only function as nouns. Pronouns are a subset of nouns, so they cannot be combined with determiners.
#** He loi - an ant
#** Tona vaka - his canoe
# Verb - A lexeme that comes directly after a verbal particle and expresses tense or aspect.
#* ka - future
#* ka fano - will go
#* koi - present continuous
#* Koi ola - still alive
#* A few lexemes are used only as a verb and do not attach to form a different phrase - ex. Galo = be lost, disappear
# Locative - A lexeme that forms directly after the preposition (i, ki, or mai), without an additional determiner
#* luga - above
#* lalo - beneath
#* loto - inside
#* Place names and months have some characteristics of locatives
# Small class of “other” lexemes that don&#x27;t fit into the other three classes
#* ananafi - yesterday
#* āpō - yesterday
#* ātaeao - tomorrow morning
Majority of the lexemes can be used in both position 1 &amp; 2, meaning they can function as nouns and verbs, depending on the context.

==Complements==
&lt;section begin=&quot;list-of-glossing-abbreviations&quot;/&gt;
COMP:complementizer
TA:tense/aspect
&lt;section end=&quot;list-of-glossing-abbreviations&quot;/&gt;

The Tokulauan language makes use of complementizers pe, ke, oi, and ona. The complementizer pe is used for indicative complements, while ke, oi, and ona are used for non-indicative complements.

Pe: Complement used in sentences pertaining to knowledge.
Ke: Complement used in sentences pertaining to purpose.
Ona: Complement used in sentences pertaining to “phasal, modal, and commentative predicates.”
Oi: Complement used in sentences pertaining to items of sequence.
The Tokelauan language also must take into mind the systematics of its complements. There is a bonding hierarchy between the complements and its sentences. According to Hooper&#x27;s research, there are four elements that in Tokelauan semantics that determine the strength of the bond between the complement and rest of the sentence. In the binding system, the complements act inversely to the verb of the sentence. Therefore, if the strength of the verb is higher on the binding scale, the complement is unlikely to appear as its own separate clause. The four elements are: Subject/agent case marking, Verb modalities, Fusion or co-lexicalization, and Separation.

# Subject/agent case marking: “&#x27;The higher the main verb is on the binding scale, the less likely is the subject/agent of the complement to display the case-marking characteristics of subjects/agents of main clauses.&#x27;” (Quoted from Givón)
# Verb modalities: “&#x27;The higher the main verb is on the binding scale, the less likely is the complement verb to display the tense-aspect-modality markings characteristics of main-clause verbs.&#x27;” (Quoted from Givón)
# Fusion or co-lexicalization: “&#x27;The higher the main verb is on the binding scale, the more likely is the complement verb to co-lexicalize with the main verb.&#x27;” (Quoted from Givón)
# Separation: “&#x27;The higher the main verb is on the binding scale, the less likely it is that a subordinating morpheme would separate the complement clause from the main clause.&#x27;” (Quoted from Givón)

==Shifting==
Tokelauan is a quite free flowing language as the sentence structures can vary greatly. Although there is a preferred method of ordering the phrase (i.e., argument, subject, case complement), the language allows for different variations. There are certain rules when it comes to sentence permutations when it comes to “subject shifting” or “case scrambling.” Generally, across these sentence permutations, the parts of speech, such as argument, subject, and case complements, have to stay together. Meaning, the argument is one section that would shift together and subject is its own unit.

Subject shift:

Case scramble:

==Affinities with other languages==
Tokelauan is mutually intelligible with the Tuvaluan language. Samoan literature is recognised mostly due to the early introduction of Christian Samoan missionaries to which the Samoan language was held as the language of instruction at school and at church. It also has marked similarities to the Niuafo&#x27;ou language of Tonga.

==Words and phrases==
== Numbers ==

==Kinship terms==
The Tokelau kinship terms are used to define family organizations within the community. Tokelau has adopted the Hawaiian-type kinship system and modified distinctions in sibling terms. The language has specific words for different members of the family, and some of these terms have multiple meanings.

=== Terms ===
There are three terms that showcase the distinction of same-sex and opposite-sex sibling terms: Sibling of own sex (male or female); sibling of opposite sex (male); and sibling of opposite sex, (female). For example, &#x27;mother&#x27;s sister,&#x27; &#x27;male cousin&#x27;s brother&#x27; and &#x27;sister&#x27;s nephew&#x27; are all different terms in the Tokelauan language. In Tokelau, the term most closely translated to “incest” is &quot;holi kāiga&quot; which is made up of two words: holi meaning &#x27;to tread&#x27; and also &#x27;to desecrate&#x27; or &#x27;violate&#x27;. The word &quot;Kāiga&quot; means &#x27;kinship&#x27;. The term holi kāiga can be applied to not only a &#x27;desecration of kinship&#x27; but in any cases that the order of kinship is changed, for example a child defying an elder. The most common use of the term, however, is used when speaking about the sexual contact between individuals. In the Tokelauan language, &quot;Kāiga&quot; has both adjectival and nominal linguistic functions:
* e kāiga ki mā &#x27;we two are related&#x27;
* ko īa he kāiga e o oku &#x27;he/she is a kinsman of mine&#x27;
* i nā aho iēnā nae hē lahi nā kāiga &#x27;in those days there were not many kingroups&#x27;
When the word is used nominally, it may imply a diverse variety of social units that all have a shared ancestor. The Tokelau languages contains terms for affinal relationships, however, there is no single word that can be transcribed as &#x27;affinity&#x27;. The term opposite of kāiga (&#x27;kin&#x27; or &#x27;related&#x27;) is he kāiga (&#x27;not kin&#x27; or &#x27;unrelated&#x27;), and that only those who are he kāiga should be wedded. Violating the kinship relationship means breaching not only the current relationship but the whole kinship of all descendants.

== Language endangerment ==
With fewer than 5000 speakers, the Tokelauan language is endangered. There is a struggle to teach a language that is spoken by only handful of people, when learning a widely known language such as English has a much greater benefit in their society. The heritage language of the community starts to diminish as parents stray away from teaching their children the local language, in hopes that they will succeed in learning the more dominant language, and as Tokelauan speakers intermarry with non-speakers. Older generations of people living in Tokelau speak both Tokelauan and Samoan, but the younger generation, due to the newer schooling system, are apt to speak English rather than Samoan. In a census in 2001 in New Zealand, only 44 percent of the people with a Tokelauan background could hold a conversation in the language, compared to 53 percent in 1996. Comparably, a meager 29 percent of New Zealand-born Tokelauans reported being able to speak the language, compared to the 71 percent born in the three atolls.

<doc id="1170764" wikidata="Q3661760" url="?curid=1170764" title="Five Patients">
<text>Five Patients is a non-fiction book by Michael Crichton that recounts his experiences of hospital practices during the late 1960s at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and describes the changes he anticipates in healthcare in coming years. It is his first non-fiction book.

The book describes each of five patients through their hospital experience and the context of their treatment. Crichton notes in the foreword of the 1994 reprint of this book that medical practices (both the culture, technology, and finances) have changed significantly since the book was written, but that the text was left as is to give a more complete glimpse into the past.

The five patients were Ralph Orlando, a construction worker seriously injured in a scaffold collapse; John O&#x27;Connor, a middle-aged dispatcher suffering from fever that has reduced him to a delirious wreck; Peter Luchesi, a young man who severs his hand in an accident; Sylvia Thompson, an airline passenger who suffers chest pains; and Edith Murphy, a mother of three who is diagnosed with a life-threatening disease.

Crichton recounts a brief history of medicine until 1969 to help contextualize hospital culture and practice and mentions national healthcare, drug prices, healthcare costs, and healthcare politics. The increasing cost of healthcare is a major theme – then at 15% per year.

He quotes Dr. James Howard Means, who is critical of the American Medical Association: &quot;every attempt has been made by liberally-minded groups to improve medical care and make it more accessible...the AMA has attacked with ever increasing truculence... They forget perhaps that medicine is for the people, not for the doctors. They need some enlightenment on this point.&quot;

<text>Logan Square is an official community area, historical neighborhood, and public square on the northwest side of the City of Chicago. The Logan Square community area is one of the 77 city-designated community areas established for planning purposes. The Logan Square neighborhood, located within the Logan Square community area, is centered on the public square that serves as its namesake, located at the three-way intersection of Milwaukee Avenue, Logan Boulevard and Kedzie Boulevard.

Logan Square is, in general, bounded by the Metra/Milwaukee District North Line railroad on the west, the North Branch of the Chicago River on the east, Diversey Parkway on the north, and the 606 (also known as the Bloomingdale Trail) on the south. The area is characterized by the prominent historical boulevards, stately greystones and large bungalow-style homes.

==History==
===Name and Centennial Monument===
Logan Square is named after General John A. Logan, an American soldier and political leader. The square itself is a large public green space (designed by architect William Le Baron Jenney, landscape architect Jens Jensen and others) formed as the grand northwest terminus of the Chicago Boulevard System and the junction of Kedzie and Logan Boulevards and Milwaukee Avenue. At the center of the square is the Illinois Centennial Monument, built in 1918 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Illinois&#x27; statehood (geographic coordinates as shown above for this article). The monument, designed by Henry Bacon, famed architect of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. and sculpted by Evelyn Beatrice Longman, is a single 70-foot (25-meter) tall &quot;Tennessee-pink&quot; marble Doric column, based upon the same proportions as the columns of the Parthenon in Ancient Greece, and topped by an eagle, in reference to the state flag and symbol of the state and the nation. The monument was funded by the Benjamin Ferguson Fund. Reliefs surrounding the base depict allegorical figures of Native Americans, explorers, Jesuit missionaries, farmers, and laborers intended to represent Illinois contributions to the nation through transportation as a railroad crossroads for passengers and freight (represented by a train extending across the arm of one of the figures), education, commerce, grain and commodities, religion and exploration, along with the &quot;pioneering spirit&quot; during the state&#x27;s first century.

===Development===
Originally developed by early settlers like Martin Kimbell (of Kimball Avenue fame) in the 1830s, forming around the towns of &quot;Jefferson,&quot; &quot;Maplewood,&quot; and &quot;Avondale&#x27;, the vicinity was annexed into the city of Chicago in 1889 and renamed Logan Square. Many of its early residents were English or Scandinavian origin, mostly Norwegians and Danes, along with both a significant Polish and Jewish population that followed.

Milwaukee Avenue, which spans the community, is one of the oldest roads in the area and remains both a cultural and commercial artery. The road traces its origins prior to 1830 as a Native American trail and became known as &quot;Northwest Plank Road&quot; when it was constructed with wooden boards in 1849. In 1892, a streetcar line was extended along Milwaukee Avenue and, in 1895, the electrified elevated rail line (today&#x27;s Blue Line) was built alongside the road up to Logan Square itself, stimulating a new building boom. Milwaukee Avenue was finally paved in 1911 to accommodate motor cars. A baseball stadium at the corner of Milwaukee and Diversey hosted the Logan Square Baseball Club, which defeated both the Chicago Cubs and White Sox, who had just played each other in the crosstown 1906 World Series.

===Present===
Today, the neighborhood is home to a diverse population including an established Latino community (primarily Mexican and Puerto Rican, with some Cuban), a number of ethnicities from Eastern Europe (mostly Poles), and a growing number of Millennials, due to gentrification. Additionally, the increase in housing costs in nearby Wicker Park, Lincoln Park, and the other Lakefront communities has led to many of Chicago&#x27;s aspiring artists and restaurateurs to call Logan Square home. Residents are attracted to the community for its beautiful park-like boulevards, part of Chicago&#x27;s 26-mile Chicago park and boulevard system. Known as the &quot;Logan Square Boulevards District&quot;, the area was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985 and became a protected Chicago Landmark in 2005. Additional development includes the partnerships between residents and the city to support the Comfort Station at Logan Square, new and renewed parks (See Palmer Square Park, below), the Bloomingdale Trail (an elevated &quot;rails to trails&quot; project), Logan Plaza, and sensitive developments (e.g. The Green Exchange and Chicago Printed String Building), along with the preservation of numerous historic buildings (historic commercial, industrial and residential structures) and several other important sustainable and green projects.

==Churches==

Logan Square has many churches along its boulevards including Minnekirken, the historic Norwegian Lutheran Memorial Church located on the public square, and a meeting house of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints one block west. Just south of the square on Kedzie Avenue, Armitage Baptist Church is located in the former Masonic Temple, and to the east of the square on Logan Boulevard are the Episcopal Church of the Advent, a new Seventh-day Adventist Church and St. John Berchmans Catholic Church.

St. Luke&#x27;s Lutheran Church of Logan Square, previously located just north of Logan Boulevard on Francisco Ave., sold their historic building in 2015 to New Community Covenant Church. St. Luke&#x27;s now meets in the same building as Grace Methodist Church. Bucktown has three of the city&#x27;s most noted &quot;Polish Cathedrals&quot; – the former All Saints Cathedral, St. Hedwig&#x27;s in Chicago, and St. Mary of the Angels. On Fullerton just east of Milwaukee is a Christian Science church offering services in Spanish. On Ridgeway, just north of Fullerton, is Our Lady of Grace Catholic Church and School.

Palmer Square, a large rectangular-shaped historic public space and park that is also part of the Logan Square community, is home to St. Sylvester Catholic Church and School and the Serbian Orthodox Church of the Holy Resurrection. Also, Grace Methodist Church stands at the corner of Kimball and Wrightwood Avenues, as does a Spanish Pentecostal church, across the street.

Kimball Avenue Church, whose 103-year-old building once stood at the corner of Kimball and Medill Avenues, continues to meet in Logan Square and has rehabilitated the land on which the church once stood into a corner garden. In 2015 the church began raising funds to use a portion of the land as the future site of a prayer labyrinth.

== Neighborhoods ==

=== Belmont Gardens ===
Belmont Gardens spans the Chicago Community Areas of Logan Square and Avondale like neighboring Kosciuszko Park, located within its northwest portion, where the Pulaski Industrial Corridor abuts these residential areas. The boundaries of Belmont Gardens are generally held to be Pulaski Road to the East, the Union Pacific/Northwest rail line to the West, Belmont Avenue to the North, and Fullerton Avenue to the South.

Most of the land between Fullerton Avenue and Diversey Avenue as well as Kimball to the Union Pacific/Northwest rail line was empty as late as the 1880s, mostly consisting of the rural &quot;truck farms&quot; that peppered much of Jefferson Township. This began to change with the annexation of this rustic hinterland to the city in 1889 in anticipation of the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition that would focus the country&#x27;s eyes on Chicago just a few years later in 1893.

Belmont Gardens&#x27; first urban development began thanks to Homer Pennock, who founded the industrial village of Pennock, Illinois. Centered on Wrightwood Avenue, which was originally laid out as &quot;Pennock Boulevard&quot;, the area was planned to be a hefty industrial and residential district. The development was so renowned that the village was highlighted in a &quot;History of Cook County, Illinois&quot; authored by Weston Arthur Goodspee and Daniel David Healy. Thwarted by circumstances as well as the decline of Homer Pennock&#x27;s fortune, this district declined to the point that the Chicago Tribune wrote about the neighborhood in an article titled &quot;A Deserted Village in Chicago&quot; in 1903. The original name of the Healy Metra Station was originally named after this now lost settlement.

While Homer Pennock&#x27;s industrial suburb failed, Chicago&#x27;s rapid expansion transformed the area&#x27;s farms into clusters of factories and homes. At the turn of the 20th century as settlement was booming, Belmont Gardens and Avondale were at the northwestern edge of the Milwaukee Avenue Polish Corridor - a contiguous stretch of Polish settlement which spanned this thoroughfare all the way from the southern tip of Wicker Park&#x27;s Polonia Triangle at the intersection of Milwaukee, Division Street and Ashland Avenue, north to Irving Park Road.

Belmont gardens offered more than just a less congested setting for its new residents. Due to its proximity to rail along the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad, the area developed a plethora of industry that still survives in the city&#x27;s Pulaski Industrial Corridor. It was adjacent to his own factory that Mr. Walter E. Olson built what the Chicago Tribune put at the top of its list of the &quot;Seven Lost Wonders of Chicago&quot;,

The Olson Park and Waterfall Complex, a 22-acre garden and waterfall remembered by Chicagoans citywide as the place they fondly reminisce heading out to for family trips on the weekend. The ambitious project took 200 workers more than six months to fashion it out of 800 tons of stone and 800 yards of soil.

Latino settlement in the neighborhood began in the 1980s. Today the area still retains its blue collar feel as much of surrounding Logan Square and Avondale undergo increased gentrification.

=== Bucktown ===
Bucktown is a neighborhood located in the east of the Logan Square community area in Chicago, directly north of Wicker Park, and northwest of the Loop. Bucktown gets its name from the large number of goats raised in the neighborhood during the 19th century when it was an integral part of the city&#x27;s famed Polish Downtown. The original Polish term for the neighborhood was &quot;Kozie Prery&quot; (Goat Prairie). Its boundaries are Fullerton Avenue to the north, Western Avenue to the west, Bloomingdale or North Avenue to the south, and the Kennedy Expressway to the east. Bucktown&#x27;s original boundaries were Fullerton Avenue, Damen Avenue (formerly Robey Street), Armitage Avenue and Western Avenue.

Bucktown is primarily residential, with a mix of older single family homes, new builds with edgy architecture, and converted industrial loft spaces. Horween Leather Company has been on North Elston Avenue in Bucktown since 1920. The neighborhood&#x27;s origins are rooted in the Polish working class, which first began to settle in the area in the 1830s. A large influx of Germans began in 1848 and in 1854 led to the establishment of the town of Holstein, which was eventually annexed into Chicago in 1863. In the 1890s and 1900s, immigration from Poland, the annexation of Jefferson Township into Chicago and the completion of the Logan Square Branch of the Metropolitan Elevated Lines contributed to the rapid increase in Bucktown&#x27;s population density. Three of the city&#x27;s most opulent churches designed in the so-called &quot;Polish Cathedral style&quot; - St. Hedwig&#x27;s, the former Cathedral of All Saints and St. Mary of the Angels - date from this era.

The early Polish settlers had originally designated many of Bucktown&#x27;s streets with names significant to their people – Kosciusko, Sobieski, Pulaski and Leipzig (after the Battle of Leipzig). Chicago&#x27;s City Council, prompted by a Bucktown-based German contingent with political clout, changed these Polish-sounding names in 1895 and 1913. In its place the new names for these thoroughfares bore a distinct Teutonic hue – Hamburg, Frankfort, Berlin and Holstein. Anti-German sentiment during World War I brought about another name-change that left today&#x27;s very Anglo-Saxon sounding names: McLean, Shakespeare, Charleston, and Palmer.

Polish immigration into the area accelerated during and after World War II when as many as 150,000 Poles are estimated to have arrived in Polish Downtown between 1939 and 1959 as Displaced Persons. Like the Ukrainians in nearby Ukrainian Village, they clustered in established ethnic enclaves like this one that offered shops, restaurants, and banks where people spoke their language. Milwaukee Avenue was the anchor of the city&#x27;s &quot;Polish Corridor&quot;, a contiguous area of Polish settlement that extended from Polonia Triangle to Avondale&#x27;s Polish Village. Additional population influxes into the area at this time included European Jews and Belarusians.

Latino migration to the area began in the 1960s with the arrival of Cuban, Puerto Rican, and later Mexican immigrants. Puerto Ricans in particular concentrated in the areas along Damen and Milwaukee Avenues through the 1980s after being displaced by the gentrification of Lincoln Park that started in the 1960s. The local Puerto Rican community lent heavy support for the Young Lords and other groups that participated in Harold Washington&#x27;s victorious mayoral campaign. In the last quarter of the 20th century, a growing artists&#x27; community led directly to widespread gentrification, which brought in a large population of young professionals. In recent years, many trendy taverns and restaurants have opened in the neighborhood. There also have been a considerable number of &quot;teardowns&quot; of older housing stock, often followed by the construction of larger, upscale residential buildings.

Bucktown has a significant shopping district on Damen Avenue, extending north from North Avenue (in Wicker Park) to Webster Avenue. The neighborhood is readily accessible via the Blue Line and has multiple access points to the elevated Bloomingdale Trail, also known as the 606.

=== Kosciuszko Park ===

Kosciuszko Park (correctly pronounced &quot;Ko-shchoosh-coe&quot; in Polish) spans the Chicago Community Areas of Logan Square and Avondale like neighboring Belmont Gardens, located within its northwest portion, where the Pulaski Industrial Corridor abuts these residential areas. Colloquially known by locals as &quot;Koz Park&quot;, or even the &quot;Land of Koz&quot;, the area is a prime example of a local identity born thanks to the green spaces created by Chicago&#x27;s civic leaders of the Progressive Era.

The boundaries of Kosciuszko Park are generally held to be Central Park Avenue to the East, Pulaski Road to the West, George Street to the North, and Altgeld to the South.

Kosciuszko Park and Avondale were at the Northwestern edge of the Milwaukee Avenue &quot;Polish Corridor&quot;—a contiguous stretch of Polish settlement which spanned this thoroughfare all the way from Polonia Triangle at Milwaukee, Division and Ashland to Irving Park Road.

Adjacent to Kosciuszko Park&#x27;s border with Avondale proper near the intersection of George Street and Lawndale Avenue is St. Hyacinth Basilica, which began in 1894 as a refuge for locals to tend to their spiritual needs. A shrine, St. Hyacinth&#x27;s features relics associated with Pope John Paul II, as well as an icon with an ornate jeweled crown that was blessed by the late pontiff. Other institutions further enriched the institutional fabric of the Polish community in the area. In 1897, the Polish Franciscan Sisters began building an expansive complex on Schubert and Hamlin Avenues with the construction of &quot;St. Joseph Home for the Aged and Crippled&quot;, a structure that would also serve as the motherhouse for the order. When it opened in 1898, it became the city&#x27;s first and oldest Catholic nursing home. One of the industries the nuns took upon themselves to support these charitable activities was a church vestment workshop which opened in 1909 on the second floor. Many of these Polish nuns were expert seamstresses, having learned these skills in the Old World. In 1928 the Franciscan Sisters further expanded the complex by building a new &quot;St. Joseph Home of Chicago&quot;, a structure that stood until recently at 2650 North Ridgeway. Designed by the distinguished firm of Slupkowski and Piontek who built many of the most prestigious commissions in Chicago&#x27;s Polish community such as the Art Deco headquarters of the Polish National Alliance, the brick structure was an imposing edifice. One of the building&#x27;s highlights was a lovely chapel with a masterfully crafted altar that was dedicated to the Black Madonna. The entire complex was sold to a developer who subsequently razed the entire complex, while the new &quot;St. Joseph Village&quot; opened in 2005 on the site of the former Madonna High School and now operates at 4021 W. Belmont Avenue. The park later became home to one of the two first Polish language Saturday schools in Chicago. While the school has since moved out of their small quarters at the park fieldhouse, the &quot;Tadeusz Kościuszko School of Polish Language&quot; continues to educate over 1,000 students to the present day, reminding all of its origins in Kosciuszko Park with its name.

It was the park of Kosciuszko Park however that wove together the disparate subdivisions and people into one community. Dedicated in 1916, Kosciuszko Park owes its name to the Polish patriot Tadeusz Kosciuszko. Best known as the designer and builder of West Point, Kosciuszko fought in the American Revolution and was awarded with U.S. citizenship and the rank of brigadier general as a reward. Kosciuszko was one of the original parks of the Northwest Park District which was established in 1911. One of the ambitious goals of the Northwest Park District that was in keeping with the spirit of the Progressive Movement popular at the time was to provide one park for each of the ten square miles under its jurisdiction. Beginning in 1914, the district began to purchase land for what would eventually become Mozart, Kelyvn, and Kosciuszko Parks, and improvement on these three sites began almost immediately. For Kosciuszko, noted architect Albert A. Schwartz designed a Tudor revival-style fieldhouse, expanded in 1936 to include an assembly hall, just two years after the 22 separate park districts were consolidated into the Chicago Park District. The park complex expanded during the 1980s with the addition of a new natatorium at the corner of Diversey and Avers.

The green space afforded by the park quickly became the backdrop for community gatherings. Residents utilized the grounds at Kosciuszko Park for bonfires, festivals and neighborhood celebrations, and for a time, even an ice skating rink that would be set up every winter. Summertime brought the opportunity for outdoor festivities, peppered with sports and amateur shows featuring softball games, social dancing, a music appreciation hour, and the occasional visit by the city&#x27;s &quot;mobile zoo&quot;.

Today &quot;The Land of Koz&quot; is a diverse neighborhood, and becoming even more so as gentrification advances further northwest. New people are entering Kosciuszko Park and joining earlier residents whose roots trace back to Latin America and Poland. Yet the park that lent the neighborhood its name still serves its residents, where through play, performance, and even the occasional outdoor film screening it functions as the venue where the community can come together.

=== Logan Square ===

Logan Square is a neighborhood located in the north-central portion of the Logan Square community area in Chicago. The neighborhood boundaries of Logan Square were originally held to be Kimball Avenue on the west, California Avenue to the east, Diversey Parkway on the north, and Fullerton Avenue to the south. However, as memory of the village and later neighborhood of Maplewood has receded, the boundaries have grown beyond these streets, with eastern boundary has now shifted to the North Branch of the Chicago River and the northern border past Diversey Avenue.

The area is characterized by the prominent historical boulevards and large bungalow-style homes. At one time, Logan Square boasted a large Norwegian-American population, centered along the historic boulevards. With relatively inexpensive housing and rent available, this neighborhood was a favorite for immigrants and working-class citizens. Logan Square was the site of the Norwegian-American cultural center, Chicago Norske Klub. Many elaborate, stylish, and expensive houses and mansions line historic Logan and Kedzie Boulevards where the club was once situated. Norwegian Lutheran Memorial Church (Norwegian: &quot;Den Norske Lutherske Minnekirke&quot;), also known as Minnekirken, is also located on Kedzie Boulevard in Logan Square.

=== Palmer Square ===
The Palmer Square neighborhood of Chicago is a pocket neighborhood located within the Logan Square community, directly west of Bucktown, north of Humboldt Park, and northwest of Wicker Park. Although there is no clear consensus on this neighborhood&#x27;s exact boundaries, the City of Chicago Neighborhoods Map shows that it is generally bound by Fullerton Avenue (2400 N) to the north, Armitage Avenue (2000 N) to the south, Kedzie Boulevard (3200 W) to the west, and Milwaukee Avenue to the east.

The neighborhood takes it name from the Palmer Square Park (pictured to the left) that sits near the western edge of the neighborhood and is the namesake of John McAuley Palmer (1817–1900), a lawyer and Civil War General who served as the 15th Governor of Illinois, a United States Senator, and at age 79, was a candidate for president in 1896. Palmer was an avowed abolitionist, friend and supporter of Abraham Lincoln, and, as the Military Governor of Kentucky in 1865–1866, aggressively commanded Federal forces to root out the remnants of slavery in that state.

As the bicycle craze swept Chicago beginning in the mid-1880s, the then-called Palmer Place oval became a popular track for bicycle-riding &quot;wheelmen&quot;, also known as &quot;scorchers&quot;, who competed with pedestrians and horse-drawn carriages. Ignaz Schwinn (1860–1948), founder of the Schwinn Bicycle Company, lived at the corner of W. Palmer St. and N. Humboldt Blvd.

The City of Chicago in 2005 received a matching grant from the Illinois Department of Natural Resources to develop a children&#x27;s play space, walking trails, soft surface jogging trail, open lawn areas, lighting, seating, and landscaping in Palmer Square. After extensive community input and prolonged design and construction periods, the Chicago Park District (CPD) finished construction of the park and opened it to the public in July 2009.

A series of live music performances in Palmer Square Park takes place each Sunday during the summer of 2021.

Palmer Square&#x27;s location places its residents within walking distance to a growing number of shops, coffee houses, bars, and restaurants, in particular, on the major streets which form the borders of the neighborhood. The heart of Palmer Square is mainly leafy residential streets. Easy access to the highways and the public transportation system also makes it a popular neighborhood for commuters to the Chicago Loop and for students who attend colleges nearby, such as DePaul University. The neighborhood has easy access to four entrances to the Kennedy Expressway (routes I-90/94) and is served by the and stations of the CTA&#x27;s Blue Line for a quick ride to Chicago&#x27;s downtown and . The CTA&#x27;s bus routes codice_1, codice_2, codice_3, and codice_4 also run through this neighborhood.

==Public libraries==

The Chicago Public Library operates one branch located in the Logan Square community area, the Logan Square Branch at 3030 W. Fullerton. Although the branch in Kosciuszko Park was one of the system&#x27;s most utilized branches, it was closed by the 1950s.

==Cultural organizations==

Logan Square has a number of diverse cultural centers, such as The Comfort Station, an art gallery and event space, and AnySquared Projects, a nonprofit art collective; St. Hedwig&#x27;s in Chicago, a strong cultural and civic institution for Chicago&#x27;s Multiethnic Catholic Community; the Hairpin Arts Center is managed by the Logan Square Chamber of Arts, located in nearby Avondale; as well as Chicago&#x27;s Polish Village. The Lincoln Lodge on Milwaukee Avenue presents live comedy most nights of the week. Next door is the office of In These Times, an independent magazine founded in 1976 which focuses on social justice.

Media organizations making their home in Logan Square include the Community TV Network—a youth media organization—and the Chicago Independent Media Center. The neighborhood is covered by a number of neighborhood news blogs, including LoganSquarist.

A comprehensive redevelopment of the historic Congress Theater was approved by the Chicago City Council in March, 2019. On June 28, 2021, David Baum announced that Baum Revision had taken over the project and planned to redevelop the landmark theater, the surrounding apartments, and retail space, using the already approved plan (although excluding the associated 72-unit apartment building). On June 9, 2022, the project was approved by the city&#x27;s Permit Review Committee.
 In early December, 2024, the Commission on Chicago Landmarks approved $6.2 million in Class L tax incentives for the first 12 years of project. Assuming approval by the full City Council, construction is slated to begin the first quarter of 2025 with completion by the end of 2026. The following week workmen began installing safety fencing on the roof in preparation for the first stage of restoration work to begin. Final plans call for a full restoration of the 3,500 seat theater as a performance venue, 13,000 square feet of restored retail spaces on the ground floor, and 16 affordable apartments on the upper levels.

==Government and infrastructure==
The Roberto Clemente Post Office is located in Logan Square.

Logan Square is served by three stops on the CTA&#x27;s Blue Line: Western, California, and Logan Square. All three stations provide 24/7 service to O&#x27;Hare International Airport, downtown, and Forest Park.

==Education==
Residents are zoned to Chicago Public Schools.

The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago runs Our Lady of Grace School in Logan Square, St. John Berchmans School on Logan Boulevard and St. Sylvester School on Palmer Square.

==Politics==
The Logan Square community area has supported the Democratic Party in the past two presidential elections. In the 2016 presidential election, Logan Square cast 27,987 votes for Hillary Clinton and cast 2,435 votes for Donald Trump (86.99% to 7.57%). In the 2012 presidential election, Logan Square cast 22,608 votes for Barack Obama and cast 3,362 votes for Mitt Romney (83.88% to 12.47%).

<text>Roquel &quot;Billy&quot; Davis (July 11, 1932 – September 2, 2004), of Detroit, was an American songwriter, record producer, and singer. Davis was also known as a writer/producer of commercial jingles, mostly for Coca-Cola. He was also known as Tyran Carlo on writing credits.

Early in his career in Detroit, Davis sang and wrote with an early version of the Four Tops called &quot;The Four Aims&quot;, which included his cousin Lawrence Payton. In the late-1950s, he collaborated with Berry Gordy, the Motown Records founder, to write a number of hit songs for Jackie Wilson. The most notable of these was &quot;Lonely Teardrops&quot;, written by Davis, Gordy, and Gordy&#x27;s sister Gwen, who was Davis&#x27;s girlfriend at the time. Davis and Gwen Gordy later founded Anna Records, which was the distributor of the early singles from Berry Gordy&#x27;s newly formed Tamla label. The two also wrote &quot;Reet Petite (The Finest Girl You Ever Want to Meet)&quot; for Wilson, which was a top 10 hit for the singer in the UK and later topped the British charts in 1986 when re-released. Another success for the two was Marv Johnson&#x27;s major hit in 1959, &quot;You Got What It Takes&quot; (#2 R&amp;B, No. 10 Pop), as the two continued to work together.

In the early 1960s, Davis left Detroit and moved to Chess Records in Chicago, after being persuaded by label owner, Leonard Chess to take charge of the A&amp;R and creative departments, bringing in and supervising in-house songwriters, arrangers and producers, who were aiming now at the soul and crossover pop markets. During this period, he wrote and produced for many artists, including Etta James, The Dells, Billy Stewart, Little Milton, Jackie Ross, Mitty Collier, Fontella Bass, Chuck Berry, and Jackie Wilson.

Davis quit Chess towards the end of 1968, some months before the record company was eventually sold, with his success at the label gaining him a position writing and producing jingles at the McCann Erickson advertising agency in New York City. He eventually rose to Senior Vice-President and Music Director. While at McCann-Erickson, Davis&#x27;s primary client was The Coca-Cola Company, for which he produced the famous jingle &quot;I&#x27;d Like to Teach the World to Sing (In Perfect Harmony)&quot;, used in a 1971 Coca-Cola television advertisement. He also produced other jingles such as &quot;It&#x27;s the Real Thing&quot;, &quot;Things Go Better with Coke&quot; and &quot;Country Sunshine&quot; for Coca-Cola (with country singer Dottie West, who recorded the song), and &quot;If You&#x27;ve Got the Time&quot; for Miller Beer.

The Coca-Cola advertisement Hey Kid, Catch!, starring Mean Joe Greene, included the song &quot;Have a Coke and Smile&quot; produced by Davis. Hey Kid, Catch! won the Clio and Cannes Gold Lion awards. It is also seen as one of the greatest Super Bowl ads of all time.

Davis introduced both Aretha Franklin and Ray Charles to singing songs for advertising, and both artists sang songs produced by Davis for Coca-Cola commercials. In 2007, Davis was inducted into the Advertising Hall of Fame.

Davis died of natural causes in New Rochelle, New York, in September 2004. He was 72 years old.

<text>Small World is the fifth studio album by American rock band Huey Lewis and the News, released in 1988. It was the band&#x27;s last album release on Chrysalis Records in the United States.

Although it reached the top 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart, &quot;Small World&quot; did not sell as well as the band&#x27;s previous albums, &quot;Sports&quot; and &quot;Fore!&quot;. However, Huey Lewis himself stated in a &quot;Behind the Music&quot; interview that the recording process for &quot;Small World&quot; had the most favorable working conditions.

==Recording==
The album track &quot;Slammin&#x27;&quot; was written for the purpose of being used for highlights for the San Francisco 49ers NFL football team, which the band and especially Lewis are big fans of. &quot;We thought it&#x27;d be a cool idea to have an instrumental on the record. Very old school,&quot; Lewis recalled. Lewis joked that the song should&#x27;ve just been called &quot;49er Highlights&quot;. The team used the song for game highlights.

<doc id="1170784" wikidata="Q7602298" url="?curid=1170784" title="Stars (M. C. Escher)">
<text>Stars is a wood engraving print created by the Dutch artist M. C. Escher in 1948, depicting two chameleons in a polyhedral cage floating through space.

The compound of three octahedra used for the central cage in &quot;Stars&quot; had been studied before in mathematics, and Escher likely learned of it from the book &quot;Vielecke und Vielflache&quot; by Max Brückner. Escher used similar compound polyhedral forms in several other works, including &quot;Crystal&quot; (1947), &quot;Study for Stars&quot; (1948), &quot;Double Planetoid&quot; (1949), and &quot;Waterfall&quot; (1961).

The design for &quot;Stars&quot; was likely influenced by Escher&#x27;s own interest in both geometry and astronomy, by a long history of using geometric forms to model the heavens, and by a drawing style used by Leonardo da Vinci. Commentators have interpreted the cage&#x27;s compound shape as a reference to double and triple stars in astronomy, or to twinned crystals in crystallography. The image contrasts the celestial order of its polyhedral shapes with the more chaotic forms of biology.

Prints of &quot;Stars&quot; belong to the permanent collections of major museums including the Rijksmuseum, the National Gallery of Art, and the National Gallery of Canada.

==Description==
&quot;Stars&quot; is a wood engraving print; that is, it was produced by carving the artwork into the end grain of a block of wood (unlike a woodcut which uses the side grain), and then using this block to print the image. It was created by Escher in October 1948. Although most published copies of &quot;Stars&quot; are monochromatic, with white artwork against a black background, the copy in the National Gallery of Canada is tinted in different shades of turquoise, yellow, green, and pale pink.

The print depicts a hollowed-out compound of three octahedra, a polyhedral compound composed of three interlocking regular octahedra, floating in space. Numerous other polyhedra and polyhedral compounds float in the background; the four largest are, on the upper left, the compound of cube and octahedron; on the upper right, the stella octangula; on the lower left, a compound of two cubes; and on the lower right, a solid version of the same octahedron 3-compound. The smaller polyhedra visible within the print also include all of the five Platonic solids and the rhombic dodecahedron. In order to depict polyhedra accurately, Escher made models of them from cardboard.

Two chameleons are contained within the cage-like shape of the central compound; Escher writes that they were chosen as its inhabitants &quot;because they are able to cling by their legs and tails to the beams of their cage as it swirls through space&quot;. The chameleon on the left sticks out his tongue, perhaps in commentary; H. S. M. Coxeter observes that the tongue has an unusual spiral-shaped tip.

==Influences==

Escher&#x27;s interest in geometry is well known, but he was also an avid amateur astronomer, and in the early 1940s he became a member of the Dutch Association for Meteorology and Astronomy. He owned a 6 cm refracting telescope, and recorded several observations of binary stars.

The use of polyhedra to model heavenly bodies can be traced back to Plato, who in the &quot;Timaeus&quot; identified the regular dodecahedron with the shape of the heavens and its 12 faces with the constellations of the zodiac. Later, Johannes Kepler theorized that the distribution of distances of the planets from the sun could be explained by the shapes of the five Platonic solids, nested within each other. Escher kept a model of this system of nested polyhedra, and regularly depicted polyhedra in his artworks relating to astronomy and other worlds.

Escher learned his wood engraving technique from Samuel Jessurun de Mesquita. He illustrated the octahedral compound of &quot;Stars&quot; in the beveled wire-frame style that had been used by Leonardo da Vinci in his illustrations for Luca Pacioli&#x27;s 1509 book, &quot;De divina proportione&quot;.

The stella octangula (Latin for &quot;eight-pointed star&quot;) in the upper right of &quot;Stars&quot; was first described by Pacioli, and later rediscovered by Kepler, who gave it its astronomical name. H. S. M. Coxeter reports that the shape of the central chameleon cage in &quot;Stars&quot; had previously been described in 1900 by Max Brückner, whose book &quot;Vielecke und Vielflache&quot; includes a photograph of a model of the same shape. Coxeter, believing that Escher was not aware of this reference, wrote &quot;It is remarkable that Escher, without any knowledge of algebra or analytic geometry, was able to rediscover this highly symmetrical figure.&quot; However, George W. Hart has documented that Escher was familiar with Brückner&#x27;s book and based much of his knowledge of stellated polyhedra and polyhedral compounds on it.

==Analysis==
Martin Beech interprets the many polyhedral compounds within &quot;Stars&quot; as corresponding to double stars and triple star systems in astronomy. Beech writes that, for Escher, the mathematical orderliness of polyhedra depicts the &quot;stability and timeless quality&quot; of the heavens, and similarly
Marianne L. Teuber writes that &quot;Stars&quot; &quot;celebrates Escher&#x27;s identification with Johannes Kepler&#x27;s neo-Platonic belief in an underlying mathematical order in the universe&quot;.

Alternatively, Howard W. Jaffe interprets the polyhedral forms in &quot;Stars&quot; crystallographically, as &quot;brilliantly faceted jewels&quot; floating through space, with its compound polyhedra representing crystal twinning.
However, R. A. Dunlap points out the contrast between the order of the polyhedral forms and the more chaotic biological nature of the chameleons inhabiting them. In the same vein, Beech observes that the stars themselves convey tension between order and chaos: despite their symmetric shapes, the stars are scattered apparently at random, and vary haphazardly from each other. As Escher himself wrote about the central chameleon cage, &quot;I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it wobbles a bit.&quot;

==Related works==
A closely related woodcut, &quot;Study for Stars&quot;, completed in August 1948, depicts wireframe versions of several of the same polyhedra and polyhedral compounds, floating in black within a square composition, but without the chameleons. The largest polyhedron shown in &quot;Study for Stars&quot;, a stellated rhombic dodecahedron, is also one of two polyhedra depicted prominently in Escher&#x27;s 1961 print &quot;Waterfall&quot;.

The stella octangula, a compound of two tetrahedra that appears in the upper right of &quot;Stars&quot;, also forms the central shape of another of Escher&#x27;s astronomical works, &quot;Double Planetoid&quot; (1949). The compound of cube and octahedron in the upper left was used earlier by Escher, in &quot;Crystal&quot; (1947).

Escher&#x27;s later work &quot;Four Regular Solids (Stereometric Figure)&quot; returned to the theme of polyhedral compounds, depicting a more explicitly Keplerian form in which the compound of the cube and octahedron is nested within the compound of the dodecahedron and icosahedron.

==Collections and publications==
&quot;Stars&quot; was used as cover art for the 1962 anthology &quot;Best Fantasy Stories&quot; edited by Brian Aldiss,
and for a 1971 Italian edition of occult guidebook &quot;The Morning of the Magicians&quot;. It also formed the frontispiece for a 1996 textbook on crystallography.

As well as being exhibited in the Escher Museum, copies of &quot;Stars&quot; are in the permanent collections of the Rijksmuseum, National Gallery of Art,
Mildred Lane Kemper Art Museum,
Boston Public Library,
and the National Gallery of Canada.

<doc id="1170787" wikidata="Q5077772" url="?curid=1170787" title="Charles Francis Colcord">
<text>Charles Francis Colcord (August 18, 1859 – December 10, 1934) was a cattle rancher, U.S. Marshal, chief of police, businessman, and pioneer of the Old West. The community of Colcord, Oklahoma, is named for him.

Colcord&#x27;s life spanned the American Civil War, the taming of the west, the cattle drives, the Land Runs, the Wright brothers&#x27; flight, World War I, Wiley Post, Will Rogers and Charles Lindbergh, the Roaring Twenties, the Great Depression, and the transition of Oklahoma City from a frontier prairie to a booming metropolis with skyscrapers, oil fields and airplanes. On December 30, 1934, a resolution adopted by the Oklahoma City Chamber of Commerce stated,
&quot;Affluence came to him but left unspoiled his native gentleness and simplicity. Always he was modest, humble, democratic, generous, just and kind. He remembered the less fortunate friends of his early days.&quot;

==Early years==
Charles Colcord was born near Cane Ridge, Paris, Bourbon County, Kentucky to Col. William Rogers Colcord (November 26, 1827 – January 10, 1901) and Maria Elizabeth Clay (March 1832, Paris, KY – ?, Denver CO). His father was a son of Charles B. Colcord and Louisa Metcalfe Bristow with deep roots in Kentucky, as attested by his brother&#x27;s biography:
This interesting and gentlemanly proprietor of Burr Oak farm, [Frank P. Colford] is a son of C. B. Colcord and Louisa Metcalf, who was a niece of the honored George Metcalf. The father of our subject settled in 1813 at Middletown, this county, from the State of New Hampshire, he being then about twenty-seven years of age, and soon after engaged in business at that place with an older brother who accompanied him to his new settlement. Their spirit of business adventure, however, was not to be satisfied in a village traffic, but they engaged in extensive speculation which proved remunerative, C. G.[sic] Colcord being the first man who ever took a drove of mules to New Orleans by land from Bourbon County; he was married to Miss Metcalf in 1824, and by that union were born six children, only two of whom grew to maturity; viz: William R., born Nov. 26, 1827; married in the vicinity of Middletown, now residing in Wichita, Ka., where he is extensively engaged in the stock business. Our subject was born Sept. 17, 1829; received a liberal education, attending the Western Military Institute in 1849 and &#x27;50, then located at Middletown; one of his preceptors and intimate friends being the Honorable James G. Blaine, Secretary of State. Mr. Colcord is an enterprising, thrifty farmer, with 432 acres of choice land, about eight miles from Paris, which he has well stocked, and conducts in a successful manner. He was never married, but enjoys an independent life with his pleasant surroundings.

His mother&#x27;s parents were William Green Clay and Patsy Bedford of Paris. His maternal grandfather was General Green Clay of Paris, Kentucky, a cousin of Sen. Henry Clay and father of abolitionist Cassius Marcellus Clay.

For much of his young childhood his father was an officer fighting for the Confederacy in the Civil War, and moved his family to Georgia and New Orleans. After the war, the senior Colcord sold his interest in the family farm to his brother and used the proceeds to purchase a sugar plantation north of New Orleans. When son Charley, then about ten, contracted malaria from a nearby swamp, his father sent him to the ranch owned by his friend Charles Sanders near Banquete, Texas, so that he could recover. When W. R. Colcord opened a ranch near Corpus Christi, Texas, to raise horses, Charley ran away to work as a cowboy. In 1875, he was sent on a cattle drive to Baxter Springs followed by a buffalo hunt on the western prairies. There he learned of the need for horses in central Kansas, which he reported back to his father.

==Cattle rancher==
In 1876 W. R. teamed up with Hines Clark to trail 1200 mares north to pens in the Cherokee Outlet; Charley was among the half-dozen riders. They decided to stay in Kansas and lived near Medicine Lodge in Comanche County.

In the fall of 1877, father moved the rest of the family up from Texas and we built three or four fine big dugouts for them... near the mouth of Red Fork, about five miles from the head of Jug Mott Creek, three miles from Evansville, and about twenty-five miles southeast of ... where Coldwater, Kansas, was afterward built.
The senior Colcord teamed up with neighbors R. C. Campbell, Bob Campbell, Billy Carter and Frank Thornton to form the Jug Cattle Company, with Charley employed as range boss. The Jug livestock brand (pictured here), became famous throughout Kansas and Oklahoma.

Colcord&#x27;s father joined about fourteen of his neighbors to form the Comanche Pool, one of the first corporate ranches in the southwest. Starting with about 26,000 head of cattle around Evansville, Kansas, the pool grew to control nearly shipping over 20,000 cattle to market each year.

This Comanche Pool was the biggest outfit anywhere. It had from sixty to eighty thousand head of cattle belonging to the various pool members, which ran all over the country; in our annual roundup we used to come as far south as Sacred Heart Mission on the Little River, sometimes even to the Red River, ... west as far as the west end of the Panhandle.

In 1879, outlaws John Middleton and Henry Brown left Billy the Kid&#x27;s gang and stayed at Colcord&#x27;s camp in the Cherokee Outlet for several weeks. On December 18, 1879, Middleton married Colcord&#x27;s 15-year-old sister, Maria &quot;Birdie&quot; Colcord, but the marriage only lasted about a year.

During the 1880s, cattle prices remained high and the members of the Comanche Pool continued building their herd. In 1882 a lease was negotiated for over of land for ten years at an annual rent of two cents an acre, payable semi-annually in advance. By the fall of 1885, the Pool cattle numbered nearly 84,000 head. But by then, reacting to allegations of bribery and fraud, President Cleveland voided the leases that were never approved by the federal government, and ordered all cattle removed from the reservation within forty days. 210,000 head of cattle were moved to the already overstocked ranges of the adjoining states.

An unusually dry summer in 1885 was followed by a bad winter; nearly 85 percent of the cattle died during an 18-month span, reducing Pool assets to a mere 13,000 head. Most of the ranchers were wiped out and moved elsewhere. The Colcord family continued with the Pool until its final collapse. Charley, now married (see below) and his brother William moved to Arizona to manage a ranch, followed by their mother, younger brother and now-divorced sister Birdie.

==Oklahoma years==
Then the Oklahoma land run was announced. According to one account, Charles made the run on April 22, 1889, then traded his $66 investment in a team and wagon for a shack and lot. By the end of the excitement, a noisy tent city had sprung up, and Colcord was its leading citizen, with his lot becoming Lot Number 1, Block Number 1, Oklahoma City. Another source indicates that Colcord first staked a claim in Hennessey, then immediately sold his claim and arrived in Oklahoma City on April 23, 1889.

In either event, as Oklahoma boomed he served for two years as Chief of Police, then Oklahoma City&#x27;s first Sheriff (essentially the army left what was a territory, declared it a state, and gave Charlie the stockade and a gun.) He later became a deputy US Marshal for five years, serving with Bill Tilghman. He worked hard to control a lawless, wild area, fighting Bill Doolin, Bill &quot;Tulsa Jack&quot; Blake, the Dalton Gang, Richard &quot;Little Dick&quot; West, and others. He personally rounded up five members of the Dalton Gang and supervised their hanging.

He also participated in the 1893 Cherokee Strip land run and built a home there. During the run his horse ran into the horse of an old friend, Sheriff George Parker of Lincoln County, when George&#x27;s mount stepped into a prairie dog hole. George said &quot;Stay down, Charlie, that&#x27;s a corner lot!&quot; and Charlie staked his claim where he fell. In six hours Perry, Oklahoma, had a population of 15,000, and Colcord was appointed marshal.

In 1898 he returned to Oklahoma City and established the Colcord Investment Company and the Colcord Park Corporation, the latter of which developed Delmar Gardens southwest of downtown. He organized and headed the Commercial National Bank of Oklahoma City, was vice president of the State National Bank, president of the Oklahoma City Building &amp; Loan Association, and director of the Oklahoma State Fair Association.

==Oil exploration==
Colcord also became involved in oil exploration. After Dr. Fred Clinton and Dr. J.C.W. Bland drilled a successful well in 1901 north of Red Fork, 2,500 people were attracted to the area, including Colcord and Robert T. Galbreath who had been partners in a real estate venture. Colcord and Galbreath organized the Red Fork Oil and Gas Co. and drilled the first wells in the town limits of Red Fork. Colcord later drilled in Healdton, Loco and Duncan fields.

Then, on a hunting trip in 1905 with Galbreath and Frank Chesley, Colcord&#x27;s two Kentucky wolfhounds chased after a wolf and disappeared. A search for the dogs brought them to a farm owned by a Creek Indian named Ida Glenn. While searching for the dogs with Galbreath and Chesley, Chesley discovered a spot where oil was seeping from some rocks. Along with John O. Mitchell, the men eventually secured the right to drill on the land. On November 22, 1905, a discovery well gushed oil, leading to the discovery of the Glenn Pool oil field, which became one of the world&#x27;s largest known oil fields. Glenpool produced over 340 million barrels of oil over the next century and put Tulsa on the map, by 1907, as the Oil Capital of the World. Galbreath became known as the &quot;Oil King of the Southwest&quot; and was &quot;rated the richest man in Oklahoma.&quot; With his share of the profits, Colcord invested $750,000 in the Colcord Building in 1912.

==Later years and death==

By the 1920s, Colcord was a wealthy man. He learned of opportunities for cattle ranching in southern Delaware County, Oklahoma, and built a ranch there. Nearby a little community was springing up that was named after the rancher in February 1930. Mr. Colcord employed many local residents of Colcord, Oklahoma, and was very important to the spirit and economy of the growing town.

In 1933, Colcord had his last episode with lawbreakers. A close friend of his, Charles Urschel, was kidnapped by Machine Gun Kelly and his gang and held for ransom, not uncommon in those Depression days. Colcord called a meeting at the Colcord Building of the richest men in Oklahoma City and put together a large reward. Kelly was eventually captured, and Charles Urschel was returned unharmed.

A Democrat in politics, Colcord was president of the Oklahoma City Chamber of Commerce in 1914 and president of the Oklahoma Historical Society during the 1920s and 1930s until his death. He was inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame in 1929 and had achieved the thirty-second degree of the Masonic Order. He was also a member of the Oklahoma Consistory of the Valley of Guthrie, the Indian Temple, Ancient Arabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine, and the Golf and Country Club.

A few months before his death, as president of the Historical Society, Oklahoma&#x27;s &quot;First Citizen&quot; gave an address at a reunion of the Medicine Lodge Peace Treaty pioneers that gave remarkable insight into the history of the Great Plains.

He died in 1934 at age 75 at his Delaware County ranch; with a police honor guard, his body lay in state in the rotunda of the Oklahoma Historical Society building. At his death, his estate was unofficially valued at $1.5 million, the equivalent of about $24 million in 2009. He is buried in Oklahoma City&#x27;s Fairlawn Cemetery.

His tombstone reads:

&lt;poem&gt;
His life was gentle, and the elements
So mix&#x27;d in him, that Nature might stand up —
And say to all the world, &quot;This was a man&quot;.&lt;/poem&gt;

==Family==
Over her family&#x27;s objections, Charles Francis Colcord married Harriet Scoresby (August 1865, Iowa – June 26, 1951, Oklahoma City), in Hutchinson, Kansas on February 9, 1885. She was the daughter of Rev. Thomas Smith Scoresby, a Methodist Episcopal minister born in England.

They moved to Flagstaff, Arizona, before participating in the Run. They had seven children:

* Ray Colcord (born September 12, 1886, died February 1971, St. Petersburg FL), married Rena Piner
* Charles F. Colcord Jr. (born June 12, 1888, in Kansas, died August 23, 1900, in Oklahoma City)
* Marguerite Colcord (Mrs. Lee Dudley) Callahan, died May 1980 in Oklahoma City).
* Caroline Colcord (Mrs. John Wesley) Bates, b. August 8, 1895, Oklahoma Territory, died October 13, 1995, Tulsa)
* Sidney Colcord (born February 17, 1898, in Oklahoma Territory, died December 22, 1969, in Tulsa)
* Cadijah Colcord (Mrs. Walter H.) Helmerich (1899–1990)
* Harriet Colcord White (born September 2, 1901, died June 1979, Oklahoma City)

==Legacies==
Colcord built the Colcord Building, now known as the Colcord Hotel, which was the first skyscraper in Oklahoma City. It was also the first steel-reinforced concrete building in Oklahoma, because Colcord had seen the devastation to lesser buildings in San Francisco following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and resulting fires. Originally designed with two wings, only the east wing and connecting elevator/stair segment were constructed. Architect William A. Wells was a protégé of Louis Sullivan, a founder of the Chicago School style of architecture. Sullivan designed the molds for the decorative terra cotta ornamentation on the first, second, and twelfth floors of the Colcord. The building survived Oklahoma City&#x27;s Urban Renewal efforts and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Developer Paul Coury, with the help of investors including Beck Design and Manhattan Construction, have transformed the office building into a boutique hotel adjacent to what will be the state&#x27;s tallest building, the new 51-story, 274 metres/900 feet Devon Tower. The Colcord Building is now owned by Devon Energy. Colcord also built the Commerce Exchange Building and the Biltmore Hotel.

When he died Oklahoma City named the new Civic Center after him. His dedication to the city and his cowboy origins landed him in the Cowboy Hall of Fame.

Colcord built one of Oklahoma City&#x27;s first great mansions in 1901 at 421 Northwest 13th Street, beginning the development of what was soon Oklahoma City&#x27;s finest &quot;suburban&quot; neighborhood. Colcord&#x27;s three-story pillared Georgian home with its beveled-glass windows, mirrored ballroom, and carriage house was demolished in 1965 and replaced by a now-failed insurance company building. Alarm of the demolition of the Colcord mansion led to the establishment of a historical preservation district in what became known as &quot;Heritage Hills&quot; and the preservation of the nearby Henry Overholser mansion and other monuments to the early days of the city. In their book, &quot;Vanished Spendor&quot;, Jim Edwards and Hal Ottaway (Abalache Book Shop Publishing Co. 1982), gives the following description of the home:

Built and designed by William A. Wells, this mansion was almost an exact replica of Mr. Colcord&#x27;s father&#x27;s home in Kentucky. It had twenty-five rooms, besides halls, nooks, closets, and baths.

In 1959, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum.

<doc id="1170791" wikidata="Q1347196" url="?curid=1170791" title="Thomas Helwys">
<text>Thomas Helwys (c. 1575 – c. 1616), an English minister, was one of the joint founders, with John Smyth, of the General Baptist denomination. In the early 17th century, Helwys was the principal formulator of a demand that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law, so that individuals might have a freedom of religious conscience. He was an advocate of religious liberty at a time when to hold to such views could be dangerous. He died in prison as a consequence of the religious persecution of Protestant Dissenters under King James I.

==Early life==
Helwys was born in Gainsborough, England, to Edmund and Margaret Helwys who were descendants of an old Norman family. Edmund had sold his land in Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire and had taken a lease on Broxtowe Hall in Bilborough parish. In 1590 when his father died, Thomas assumed control of the estate, but in 1593 he left the care of the estate in the hands of his father&#x27;s friends and began studies in law at Gray&#x27;s Inn, one of the four Inns of Court in London. His family was on the rise in London. Geoffrey Helwys, his uncle, was a successful merchant, an alderman and the sheriff of London. His cousin Gervase was knighted by King James before becoming lieutenant of the Tower of London. After completing his studies at Gray&#x27;s Inn in 1593, Helwys spent some time in the capital.

Helwys married Joan Ashmore at St Martin&#x27;s Church, Bilborough, in 1595. They had seven children over the next twelve years and lived at Broxtowe Hall. During this time, the Helwyses&#x27; home became a haven for radical Puritans (Dissenters within the Church of England), and it is likely that Helwys contributed financially to their mission.

In 1606, when Archbishop Richard Bancroft was forcing ministers to submit to the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, Helwys took part in conference of radical Puritans in Coventry discussing whether to quit the Church of England and become Brownists. The conference included John Smyth, John Robinson, Richard Bernard and Arthur Hildersham. Helwys developed a close bond with Smyth, and he and his wife became committed members of Smyth&#x27;s Separatist or Brownist congregation in Gainsborough. The 60 or 70 Separatists in Gainsborough were allowed to meet in secret in Gainsborough Old Hall by the hall&#x27;s sympathetic owner Sir William Hickman.

==Ministry==
As Separatism was illegal, the Gainsborough and Scrooby Dissenters were arrested and their houses raided. Joan Helwys was imprisoned in York Castle by the Archbishop of York in 1607. Between 1607 and 1608, Helwys, Smyth, Robinson and many others from the Gainsborough and Scrooby congregations fled to the safety of Amsterdam in the more tolerant Dutch Republic. Helwys organised the Gainsborough group&#x27;s emigration—according to Robinson, &quot;If any brought oars, he brought sails.&quot; Assuming their safety, Helwys allowed his family to remain in England. His wife was soon arrested, and after refusing to take the oath in court she was imprisoned. It is likely that she was banished after three months in prison.

It was in the Dutch Republic that a distinctive Baptist faith first emerged amongst the English émigrés, and Helwys was one of the leaders of the foundation of the first Baptist church in 1609. Taking the Brownist idea that church membership was only for believers to its logical conclusion, Smyth became convinced that baptism into the church should be for Christian believers only and not for infants. In January 1609, Smyth baptised himself first then the rest of his followers, starting with Helwys. The other English Separatists in Amsterdam rejected this new teaching. Later that year, the group led by Smyth and Helwys started renting a meeting house from Dutch Mennonites and were persuaded by them to abandon the doctrine of predestination. Some of the Baptists accepted Mennonite Christology, that Jesus did not take his flesh from Mary, but Smyth and Helwys did not, so those Baptists left the church.

In 1610, Smyth and Helwys fell out after Smyth decided he had been wrong to baptise himself and applied to join the Mennonites and be re-baptised. Helwys and about ten others split from Smyth&#x27;s church. Helwys formulated the earliest Baptist confession of faith. This &quot;confession&quot; became the 27 Articles in 1611. In the next twelve months or so, Helwys wrote three important works: an argument for Arminianism (&quot;A Short and Plain Proof, By the Word and Works of God, That God&#x27;s Decree Is Not the Cause of Any Man&#x27;s Sin or Condemnation: And That All Men Are Redeemed by Christ; As Also That No Infants Are Condemned&quot;), a polemic explaining his differences with the Mennonites (&quot;An Advertisement or Admonition to the Congregations, which Men Call the New Fryelers, in the Lowe Countries&quot;), and, most importantly, &quot;A Short Declaration on the Mistery of Iniquity&quot;.

&quot;The Mistery of Iniquity&quot; was a critique of the failings of Catholicism, state-church Protestantism and Brownism. It was the first English book to defend the principle of religious liberty. For Helwys, religious liberty was a right for everyone, whether Protestants, Catholics, Jews, Muslims or atheists. The book also argued that Separatist leaders such as Smyth and Robinson had been wrong to take their churches overseas to escape persecution and that they should return to England. The historian of Separatism, Stephen Tomkins, describes &quot;The Mistery of Iniquity&quot; as the most radical and outspoken book of the age and &quot;the most far-reaching declaration of universal religious freedom yet seen in English&quot;, but adds: &quot;It is a pity that this most ground-breaking treatise of the Separatist movement should also be its most mean-spirited.&quot;

Despite the obvious risks involved, in 1613 Helwys and 12 Baptist émigrés returned to England and founded the first Baptist congregation in England in Spitalfields, east London. They brought &quot;The Mistery of Iniquity&quot; with them, and one copy of it was delivered to King James, with a handwritten inscription arguing for liberty of conscience. &quot;The King&quot;, Helwys said, &quot;is a mortal man, and not God, therefore he hath no power over the mortal soul of his subjects to make laws and ordinances for them and to set spiritual Lords over them.&quot; Helwys and other Baptists were thrown into Newgate Prison, where they wrote a petition to the king. &quot;Persecution for Religion Judg’d and Condemn’d&quot; was written in Newgate in 1616, either by Helwys or his follower John Murton. 

== Death and legacy ==
Helwys died around 1616 at about the age of forty. Helwys&#x27; presentation copy of &quot;A Short Declaration of the Mistery of Iniquity&quot; is preserved in the Bodleian Library. Helwys is honoured with the Helwys Hall at Regent&#x27;s Park College, Oxford. Thomas Helwys Baptist Church in Lenton, Nottingham, is named after him. Broxtowe Hall, the Helwys&#x27; family home, is now only a remnant, but in nearby Bilborough Baptist Church there is a simple plaque to his memory.

<doc id="1170793" wikidata="Q849523" url="?curid=1170793" title="Calcination">
<text>Calcination is thermal treatment of a solid chemical compound (e.g. mixed carbonate ores) whereby the compound is raised to high temperature without melting under restricted supply of ambient oxygen (i.e. gaseous O2 fraction of air), generally for the purpose of removing impurities or volatile substances and/or to incur thermal decomposition.

The root of the word calcination refers to its most prominent use, which is to remove carbon from limestone (calcium carbonate) through combustion to yield calcium oxide (quicklime). This calcination reaction is CaCO3(s) → CaO(s) + CO2(g). Calcium oxide is a crucial ingredient in modern cement, and is also used as a chemical flux in smelting. Industrial calcination generally emits carbon dioxide (). 

A calciner is a steel cylinder that rotates inside a heated furnace and performs indirect high-temperature processing (550–1150 °C, or 1000–2100 °F) within a controlled atmosphere.

== Etymology ==
The process of calcination derives its name from the Latin &quot;calcinare&quot; &#x27;to burn lime&#x27; due to its most common application, the decomposition of calcium carbonate (limestone) to calcium oxide (lime) and carbon dioxide, in order to create cement. The product of calcination is usually referred to in general as &quot;calcine&quot;, regardless of the actual minerals undergoing thermal treatment.

==Industrial processes==

Calcination is carried out in furnaces or reactors (sometimes referred to as kilns or calciners) of various designs including shaft furnaces, rotary kilns, multiple hearth furnaces, and fluidized bed reactors.

Examples of calcination processes include the following:
*decomposition of carbonate ores, as in the calcination of limestone to drive off carbon dioxide;
*decomposition of hydrated minerals, as in the calcination of bauxite and gypsum, carbonate ore to remove water of crystallization as water vapor;
*decomposition of volatile matter contained in raw petroleum coke;
*heat treatment to effect phase transformations, as in conversion of anatase to rutile or devitrification of glass materials;
*removal of ammonium ions in the synthesis of zeolites;
*defluorination of uranyl fluoride to create uranium dioxide and hydrofluoric acid gas;
*heat treatment of anthracite through electrically fired calcining furnace or gas calcination which results in development of graphitic structure.

==Reactions==
Calcination reactions usually take place at or above the thermal decomposition temperature (for decomposition and volatilization reactions) or the transition temperature (for phase transitions). This temperature is usually defined as the temperature at which the standard Gibbs free energy for a particular calcination reaction is equal to zero.

===Limestone calcination===

In limestone calcination, a decomposition process that occurs at 900 to 1050°C, the chemical reaction is
: CaCO3(s) → CaO(s) + CO2(g)

Today, this reaction largely occurs in a cement kiln.

The standard Gibbs free energy of reaction in [J/mol] is approximated as Δ&quot;G&quot;°&quot;r&quot; ≈ 177,100 J/mol − 158 J/(mol*K) *&quot;T&quot;. The standard free energy of reaction is 0 in this case when the temperature, &quot;T&quot;, is equal to 1121K, or 848 °C.

===Oxidation===
In some cases, calcination of a metal results in oxidation of the metal to produce a metal oxide. In his essay &quot;Formal response to the question, why Tin and Lead increase in weight when they are calcined&quot; (1630), Jean Rey notes that &quot;having placed two pounds six ounces of fine English tin in an iron vessel and heated it strongly on an open furnace for the space of six hours with continual agitation and without adding anything to it, he recovered two pounds thirteen ounces of a white calx&quot;. He claimed &quot;That this increase in weight comes from the air, which in the vessel has been rendered denser, heavier, and in some measure adhesive, by the vehement and long-continued heat of the furnace: which air mixes with the calx (frequent agitation aiding) and becomes attached to its most minute particles: not otherwise than water makes heavier sand which you throw into it and agitate, by moistening it and adhering to the smallest of its grains&quot;, presumably the metal gained weight as it was being oxidized.

At room temperature, tin is quite resistant to the impact of air or water, as a thin oxide film forms on the surface of the metal. In air, tin starts to oxidize at a temperature of over 150 °C: Sn + O2 → SnO2.

Antoine Lavoisier explored this experiment with similar results time later.

==Alchemy==
In alchemy, calcination was believed to be one of the 12 vital processes required for the transformation of a substance.

Alchemists distinguished two kinds of calcination, &quot;actual&quot; and &quot;potential&quot;. Actual calcination is that brought about by actual fire, from wood, coals, or other fuel, raised to a certain temperature. Potential calcination is that brought about by &quot;potential&quot; fire, such as corrosive chemicals; for example, gold was calcined in a reverberatory furnace with mercury and salammoniac; silver with common salt and alkali salt; copper with salt and sulfur; iron with salammoniac and vinegar; tin with antimony; lead with sulfur; and mercury with nitric acid.

There was also &quot;philosophical calcination&quot;, which was said to occur when horns, hooves, etc., were hung over boiling water, or other liquor, until they had lost their mucilage, and were easily reducible into powder.

According to the obsolete phlogiston theory, the &#x27;calx&#x27; was the true elemental substance that was left after phlogiston was driven out of it in the process of combustion.

<text>:&quot;This unit should not be confused with the 5th Rifle Division (II Polish Corps in Russia).&quot;

Polish 5th Siberian Rifle Division (, ; also known as the Siberian Division [, Сибирский Дивизион] and Siberian Brigade [&quot;Brygada Syberyjska&quot;, Сибирский Бригада]) was a Polish military unit formed in 1919 in Russia during the aftermath of World War I. The division fought during the Polish-Soviet War, but as it was attached to the White Russian formations, it is considered to have fought more in the Russian Civil War. Its tradition was continued in the Polish Army as the 30th Infantry Division.

== History ==

=== Early days ===
During World War I Russia entered a period of rapid decline. Internal problems led to an outbreak of the Russian Revolution of 1917. Initially the revolutionists promised new world order and putting a bloody war to an end. However, their rule provoked many protests and uprisings led by a variety of generals and political parties, from monarchists through anarchists to republicans.

In the turmoil of the Russian Civil War many nations started to form their own military units. Among them was a large number of Czechs and Slovaks that defected on the Russian front or were taken POW and formed the Czechoslovak Legion. The unit started an armed rebellion in Siberia and managed to effectively liberate much of the area from the Reds. At the same time Poles present in Russia also started to form their own units. In accordance with treaties with France signed the year before, the units formed in Russia were to be a part of the Allied Polish Army.

The action of forming a new unit was started on July 1, 1918, by major Walerian Czuma, a veteran from the 2nd brigade of the Polish Legions who was taken POW during World War I. Soon a new division was formed. The unit was composed of three infantry regiments, supported by an assault battalion, Uhlans regiment, artillery regiment, battalion of engineers, tabors and medical corps. The volunteers came from a variety of places: the core of the new unit was formed of POWs of the former Austro-Hungarian Army and local Poles. Some of the latter were descendants of Poles forcibly resettled to Siberia after failed November Uprising, January Uprising and other struggles with Imperial Russia.

Since the division was formally a part of the Blue Army (Polish Army in France), it was named the 5th Polish Rifle Division. The other Polish divisions at that time were 1st, 2nd and 3rd fighting with the Blue Army formed by general Józef Haller de Hallenburg in France and the Polish 4th Rifle Division of general Lucjan Żeligowski fighting in Kuban River region in southern Russia.

===Civil War in Russia===

The newly formed division joined the ranks of the White Guard of admiral Alexander Kolchak. Together with the White Russians, and elements of the Czechoslovak Legion, the unit defended Siberia against the Red Army. In defence of the Trans-Siberian Railway that was vital to counter-revolutionist supply, the division fought numerous battles against the Red forces. The unit of Major Walerian Czuma also had to fight with the harsh winter and logistic problems. Matériel and food transports were scarce, but the Poles made up lack of supplies with ingenuity, constructing three armoured trains. Also, several vessels were turned into patrol boats and artillery monitors to defend the Ob River crossings. These were the first ships flying the banner of the Polish Navy since 1863 and the first Polish warships since 1792.

The division was first formed in Samara. After the Czechs and Slovaks had taken Ufa, the headquarters was moved there. Finally, the division finished its training in Buguruslan. Since the volunteers for the division were mostly uneducated (Polish language and Polish history were banned from schools in all Russian Empire), Major Czuma ordered organisation of public schools, libraries and theatres for the recruits. There were also Scouting groups organised for the children of the local Polish diaspora. On August 15, 1918, the first regiment was named after Tadeusz Kościuszko and the following day was moved to the front. The other regiments joined soon afterwards.

The offensive of Admiral Kolchak ended with a failure in the summer of 1919. When the Red Army seized Petropavlovsk at the beginning of November 1919, the front was broken open and the Siberian Army began to disintegrate. Kolchak&#x27;s government hastily ordered the evacuation of Omsk 6 November 1919, but this quickly turned into a disorderly rout along the Trans-Siberian Railway. The Entente had determined the order of the withdrawal, with the echelons of the Allied Forces first—Czechs, Serbs Romanians and Poles, and then the masses of Russian refugees and remaining White Armies. However the trains soon crawled to a halt in icy conditions of a terrible Siberian winter and began to break down.

As the forces of the Red Army approached the log jam of trains backed up before Novo-Nikolaevsk (Novosibirsk) in early December, the Poles had to put down a local revolt by White troops. Soon after this the last Polish forces left the area and joined the withdrawal. At Taiga 22 December 1919 the Polish Legion made a stand against the Red Army but were badly beaten losing many of their trains. After this defeat the Polish Legion began to disintegrate. Many of their trains began to break down, and the Poles were forced to abandon them and join the exodus that streamed along the frozen tracks beside the railway. Fights broke out between the Poles, Romanians and Serbs for any engines that still worked. As the remaining trains limped towards Krasnoyarsk, the town was occupied by the Siberian Partisans of Shchetinkin 4 January 1920, even though the Poles still controlled the station. The leading echelons got away but ran out of fuel and supplies at Klyukvennaya (now Uyar) east of Krasnoyarsk. The Czechs were better equipped and strong enough to later fight their way through Kansk to Irkutsk, where in conference with the Allies and the new Soviet they were allowed to withdraw without further destruction of the railway (17 February 1920). However the Polish Legion had no choice but to negotiate with the Red Army and asked to be allowed to return to Poland through Russia, but the Bolsheviks demanded that they surrender. Some then mutinied and went over to the Red Army, others who had wives and children surrendered: formal surrender of the remaining 5000 strong force was agreed 8 January 1920, and all the trains that had left Krasnoyarsk were captured by the Reds. The Poles were interned at the Viona Gorodock P.O.W camp at Krasnoyarsk, where many subsequently died in the typhus epidemic that was devastating Siberia at that time. The Soviet authorities put them to work clearing the railway yards of refuse. Others were marched off to perish in forced labour in the mines. Those that survived were later repatriated under the terms of the Treaty of Riga in March 1921.

=== Evacuation ===
A large part of the once 16,000 men strong division were taken as POWs. However a group of about 900 led by Colonel Kazimierz Rumsza managed to evade capture and reached Irkutsk and from there escaped to Manchuria arriving at Harbin (February 21, 1920) and Irkutsk, from where they found safe passage to the port of Vladivostok and various ports of China and Manchuria. On June 1, 1920, the first organised group of Polish soldiers arrived to the port of Gdańsk. After three months on-board British ships, 120 officers and more than 800 soldiers and NCOs reached Poland. Some of them saw it for the first time.

===Polish-Bolshevik War===

The General Staff of the Polish Army initially wanted to demobilise all the veterans. However, all of them volunteered and were finally accepted. They were transferred to Greater Poland, where they were formed into an infantry battalion and an &quot;Officers Legion&quot;. Soon they were joined by approximately 5 000 volunteers from Kalisz, Kutno, Łódź, Włocławek and other towns of Western Poland and the &quot;Officers Legion&quot; became a core of the reformed Siberian Brigade () formed on July 12, 1920.

The new unit was composed of two regiments: the 1st Siberian Infantry Regiment under Franciszek Dindorf-Ankowicz and the 2nd Siberian Infantry Regiment under Józef Werobej. The brigade was put under command of one of the Siberian veterans, colonel Kazimierz Rumsza.

Although the training of the new recruits was not finished, the extremely difficult situation on all fronts of the Polish-Bolshevik War forced the General Staff to transfer it to the front. The brigade was transferred to the area of the Modlin Fortress and on August 13 joined the 5th Army under general Władysław Sikorski. The Siberian Brigade became a core of the Polish defence lines in the area and managed to hold out all assaults on the fortress organised by the Red Army. After the Battle of Warsaw the brigade started a pursuit after the fleeing enemy forces and broke through the enemy front in the battles of Borków, Zawady and Joniec. Between August 22 and August 24, 1920, the brigade fought heavy battles against the Red 4th Army and 3rd Cavalry Corps under Gay Dimitrievich Gay. Its elements took part in the later Battle of the Niemen and several skirmishes with Lithuanian forces occupying the region of Suwałki.

===Interbellum===

After the Peace of Riga had been signed the 2nd regiment was demobilised, while the 1st regiment remained in the Polish Army. On August 22, 1921, it was renamed to 82nd Siberian Infantry Regiment (). It was stationed in Brześć Litewski. In 1937 the name of Tadeusz Kościuszko, the original patron of the regiment, was added to the name of the unit.

===World War II===

Before the outbreak of World War II the 82nd regiment was attached to the Polish 30th Infantry Division commanded by Brigadier General Leopold Cehak. It was secretly mobilized between March 23 and March 27, 1939, and moved to the village of Szczerców where it formed a defensive line at the Widawka River. After the outbreak of the Polish Defensive War of 1939 it was attacked on September 2.

The regiment fought in the ranks of the &quot;Piotrków Corps&quot; of the Polish Łódź Army under general Juliusz Rómmel.

<text>The Apatani people are an ethnic group who live in the Ziro valley of Arunachal Pradesh&#x27;s Lower Subansiri region.

== Customs and lifestyle ==
Their wet rice cultivation system and their agriculture system are extensive even without the use of any farm animals or machines. So is their sustainable social forestry system. UNESCO has proposed the Apatani valley for inclusion as a World Heritage Site for its &quot;extremely high productivity&quot; and &quot;unique&quot; way of preserving the ecology.

The Apatanis, one of the major ethnic groups of eastern Himalayas, have a distinct civilization with systematic land-use practices and rich traditional ecological knowledge of natural resources management and conservation, acquired over the centuries through informal experimentation. The tribe is known for their colorful culture with various festivals, intricate handloom designs, skills in cane and bamboo crafts, and vibrant traditional village councils called &quot;bulyañ&quot;. This has made the Ziro Valley a good example of a living cultural landscape where humans and the environment have harmoniously existed together in a state of interdependence even through changing times, such co-existence being nurtured by the traditional customs and spiritual belief systems.
==Festivals==
They have two major festivals – Dree and Myoko. In July, the agricultural festival of Dree is celebrated with prayers for a bumper harvest and prosperity of all humankind. Paku-Itu, Daminda, Piree dance, etc., are the main cultural programmes performed in the festival. Myoko is celebrated to commemorate the intervillage friendship that has been passed down by the forefathers for generations until present. This special bond is carried forward in the succeeding generation by the current members. The main celebration occurs in the mid of March but the rituals associated with the festival starts much earlier in the preceding month and ends in next month of April. During this period a huge amount of food and drinks are being served and distributed by the host village.

<text>City Stages was a three-day arts and music festival in downtown Birmingham, Alabama, that took place in and around Linn Park from 1989 to 2009. After losses in 2009 amounted to nearly half a million dollars, the organization running City Stages announced on June 25, 2009 that the event would not return the next year.

City Stages&#x27; organizers announced in November 2007 that they hired AC Entertainment, one of the co-producers for the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival in Manchester, Tennessee, to help produce the Birmingham festival and advise them for the next three years.

The final City Stages was held on June 13–15, 2009, on Father&#x27;s Day Weekend. Ticket sales were hampered by inclement weather, a struggling economy, and a perceived low-quality artist lineup. After the event, organizers announced that the total debt had surpassed $1 million, and that no further City Stages events would be produced. As of 2021, no plans have been made to revive the festival, though the nostalgia for it has grown.

<text>Cumbemayo or Cumbe Mayo is an archaeological site located 20 kilometers southwest of the city of Cajamarca in Peru at 3,500 meters of elevation. Built around 1500 B.C.E, it comprises aqueducts, a grotto and petroglyphs; all within an area of rock formations.

==History==
The aqueduct and the petroglyphs at Cumbemayo are thought to be built circa 1500 - 1000 BC, the petroglyphs being similar to those of Chavín culture.

==Aqueduct==
One of the main attractions of Cumbemayo, or &quot;Narrow River&quot; in Cajamarca Quechua, is the aqueduct. This is a canal of approximately 9 km in length, carefully carved in volcanic rock to divert the water from the hills to cultivation fields and a large reservoir; which is presumably originally at the foot of the Santa Apolonia Hill.

Heading towards the aqueduct one can observe some stairways sculpted in stone, and a carved stone which had been used as a ceremonial altar. Also prominent is the Sanctuary a huge cliff resembling a man&#x27;s head, whose mouth would be a grotto, where interesting but undecipherable petroglyphs have been found. The caves and shelters of the area evidence other stone engravings, where visitors claim to see anthropomorphic images.

The aqueduct winds down the hills toward the city of Cajamarca, stretching out over about in length. The canals brought water from the high grounds to the valleys below, which was especially valuable during times of water scarcity. A number of petroglyphs are also scattered around the aqueduct and in surrounding caves. These symbols provide additional insight into the people who constructed the canals.

==Los Frailones==

Los Frailones are massive volcanic pillars, some stretching as high as . The stone forests suddenly appear from the landscape, starkly contrasting the flat, grass-covered plains around Cajamarca. The erosive forces of wind and rain likely carved out the pillars.

Many of the pillars, carved by wind and rain have taken on new shapes, resembling hands and even animals, and allowing the mind to wander in the pristine Peruvian setting. Their impressive and rare geological formations, where some will identify the shapes of monks forming part of procession (hence the name &quot;frailones&quot;, Spanish for friars).

<doc id="1170852" wikidata="Q2143425" url="?curid=1170852" title="Stiction">
<text>Stiction (a portmanteau of the words &quot;static&quot; and &quot;friction&quot;) is the force that needs to be overcome to enable relative motion of stationary objects in contact.
Any solid objects pressing against each other (but not sliding) will require some threshold of force parallel to the surface of contact in order to overcome static adhesion. Stiction is a &quot;threshold&quot;, not a continuous force. However, stiction might also be an illusion made by the rotation of kinetic friction.

In situations where two surfaces with areas below the micrometer scale come into close proximity (as in an accelerometer), they may adhere together. At this scale, electrostatic and/or Van der Waals and hydrogen bonding forces become significant. The phenomenon of two such surfaces being adhered together in this manner is also called stiction. Stiction may be related to hydrogen bonding or residual contamination.

==Automobiles==
Stiction is also the same threshold at which a rolling object would begin to slide over a surface rather than rolling at the expected rate (and in the case of a wheel, in the expected direction). In this case, it&#x27;s called &quot;rolling friction&quot; or &quot;μ&quot;r.

This is why driver training courses teach that, if a car begins to slide sideways, the driver should avoid braking and instead try to steer in the same direction as the slide. This gives the wheels a chance to regain static contact by rolling, which gives the driver some control again. Similarly, when trying to accelerate rapidly (particularly from a standing start) an overenthusiastic driver may &quot;squeal&quot; the driving wheels, but this impressive display of noise and smoke is less effective than maintaining static contact with the road. Many stunt-driving techniques (such as drifting) are done by deliberately breaking and/or regaining this rolling friction.

A car on a slippery surface can slide a long way with little control over orientation if the driver &quot;locks&quot; the wheels in stationary positions by pressing hard on the brakes. Anti-lock braking systems use wheel speed sensors and vehicle speed sensors to determine if any of the wheels have stopped turning. The ABS module then briefly releases pressure to any wheel that is spinning too slowly to not be slipping, to allow the road surface to begin turning the wheel freely again. Anti-lock brakes can be much more effective than cadence braking, which is essentially a manual technique for doing the same thing.

==Examples==
===Engineering===
Stiction refers to the characteristic of start-and-stop–type motion of a mechanical assembly. Consider a mechanical element slowly increasing an external force on an assembly at rest that is designed for the relative rotation or sliding of its parts in contact. The static contact friction between the assembly parts resists movement, causing the spring moments in the assembly to store mechanical energy. Any part of the assembly that can elastically bend, even microscopically, and exert a restoring force contributes a spring moment. Thus the &quot;springs&quot; in an assembly might not be obvious to the eye. The increasing external force finally exceeds the static friction resisting force, and the spring moments, released, impulsively exert their restoring forces on both the moving assembly parts and, by Newton&#x27;s Third Law, in reaction on the external forcing element. The assembly parts then impulsively accelerate with respect to each other, though resisted by dynamic contact friction (in this context very much less than the static friction). However, the forcing element cannot accelerate at the same pace, fails to keep up, and loses contact. The external force on the moving assembly momentarily drops to zero for lack of forcing mechanical contact even though the external force element continues its motion. The moving part then decelerates to a stop from the dynamic contact friction. The cycle repeats as the forcing element catches up to contact again. Stick, store spring energy, impulsively release spring energy, accelerate, decelerate, stop, stick. Repeat.

Stiction is a problem for the design and materials science of many moving linkages. This is particularly the case for linear sliding joints, rather than rotating pivots. Owing to simple geometry, the moving distance of a sliding joint in two comparable linkages is longer than the circumferential travel of a pivoting bearing, thus the forces involved (for equivalent work) are lower and stiction forces become proportionally more significant. This issue has often led to linkages being redesigned from sliding to purely pivoted structures, just to avoid problems with stiction. An example is the Chapman strut, a suspension linkage.

===Surface micromachining===
During surface micromachining, stiction or adhesion between the substrate (usually silicon-based) and the microstructure occurs during the isotropic wet etching of the sacrificial layer. The capillary forces due to the surface tension of the liquid between the microstructure and substrate during drying of the wet etchant cause the two surfaces to adhere together. Separating the two surfaces is often complicated due to the fragile nature of the microstructure. Stiction is often circumvented by the use of a sublimating fluid (often supercritical CO2, which has extremely low surface tension) in a drying process where the liquid phase is bypassed. CO2 displaces the rinsing fluid and is heated past the supercritical point. As the chamber pressure is slowly released the CO2 sublimates, thereby preventing stiction.

<doc id="1170859" wikidata="Q576322" url="?curid=1170859" title="Webmin">
<text>Webmin is a web-based server management control panel for Unix-like systems. Webmin allows the user to configure operating system internals, such as users, disk quotas, services and configuration files, as well as modify and control open-source apps, such as BIND, Apache HTTP Server, PHP, and MySQL.

== History ==
Webmin, written by Jamie Cameron, was first released as version 0.1 in October 1997. It was originally written during the time that Cameron administered a DNS server and needed an easy-to-use interface to allow users to make changes to the DNS records without giving them root access to the server. Over time, various themes, a dashboard that displays CPU, RAM, and disk space usage with visual gauges, and a sidebar with a search function were also added.

Financial support for the Webmin project came from the Linux distribution companies Caldera and MSC Linux, as well as many user contributions of code patches, hundreds of modules, language translations, and user suggestions.

In 2019, a backdoor was discovered which would allow a remote attacker to execute malicious commands with root privileges on the machine running Webmin. This backdoor exploit was present on versions 1.882-1.921, when a network admin would enable the password expiration policy. Developers of Webmin believed that the backdoor being introduced was the result of a malicious injection to the code via the online source code repository SourceForge.

Since its release, the Webmin user interface, its appearance, and its many features have changed dramatically using code that has been completely rewritten over the subsequent versions.This includes the overhaul brought by Webmin 2.0, which enforced strict HTTP Strict Transport Security policy for SSL, and gave options to users upgrading from older versions.

== General description ==
Webmin is largely based on Perl, running as its own process and web server. It defaults to TCP port 10000 for communicating, and can be configured to use SSL if OpenSSL is installed with additional required Perl modules. Webmin is built around over 110 standard modules, which have an interface to the configuration files and the Webmin server, which makes it simple to add new functionality. Due to Webmin&#x27;s modular design, it is possible for anyone who is interested to write plugins for desktop configuration. Webmin allows for controlling many machines through a single interface, or seamless login on other Webmin hosts on the same subnet or LAN.

Webmin is released under the BSD license.

If a plugin for certain tasks is not available, it is possible to open a terminal and perform various task through a command line interface (CLI). This is especially useful if using SSH (or similar) is not an option.

== Inclusion in distributions ==
While Webmin was included in the official repositories of some Linux distributions (Debian and Ubuntu), it was removed from those because Webmin was not compatible with the way that the distributions&#x27; packages handled configuration files and caused unexpected issues with systems.

== Installation == 
Pre-requisite: 
# System that supports Ubuntu 18.04 or Ubuntu 20.04 
# User account with sudo privileges.
# Access to the terminal window.

To install Webmin on Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04, first we need to update the package list with sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade -y, then install necessary dependencies with sudo apt install software-properties-common apt-transport-https -y. When the dependencies installations has been finished then add Webmin’s GKP key and repository using wget -q -O- | sudo apt-key add - and sudo add-apt-repository &quot;deb [arch=amd64]
 sarge contrib&quot;.

Next, proceed with installation of Webmin using sudo apt install webmin –y and verify the installation using sudo systemctl status webmin.

After installation is finished, configure the firewall to allow Webmin’s default TCP port 10000 using the command sudo ufw allow 10000/tcp &amp;&amp; sudo ufw reload. 

In-case, UFW is disabled, enable it using sudo ufw enable. Open a browser and insert https://[your-server-IP]:10000/ to access the Webmin. By default, Webmin generate its own self-signed certificate, so the browser may warn you “Your connection is not private”, click on Advanced and proceed. After that login using the system’s root credentials.

For security purposes, change the Webmin root password using sudo /usr/share/webmin/changepass.pl /etc/webmin root [new password]. After successful login, the Webmin dashboard can be accessed with features like system logs, user accounts, updates and configurations.

== Related software ==
Webmin can be expanded by installing modules, which can be custom made. Aside from this, there are two other major projects that extend the functionality of Webmin:

# Usermin presents and controls a subset of the features available in Webmin, such as webmail and other user-level tasks, rather than administrator-level tasks.
# Virtualmin, which is a web hosting control panel. Virtualmin enables users to host websites under domains, and gives the server admin and the end user a simple interface for managing their websites.

Webmin released Minecraft Server Module 1.0 in January 2013, and version 1.1 in March 2013. The module presents a very basic GUI for server administration. The Webmin Minecraft server is free and open source with no limitations on simultaneous players.

<doc id="1170863" wikidata="Q16274965" url="?curid=1170863" title="Aubrey">
<text>Aubrey () is a traditionally male English name. It was quite common in the Middle Ages, but had lost favour for a time before experiencing a resurgence of popularity in the 19th century.

In the United States, following the 1973 release of the song &quot;Aubrey&quot;, by the band Bread, &quot;Aubrey&quot; began to be commonly used as a given name for girls, potentially influenced by its similarity to &quot;Audrey&quot;. In 2023, &quot;Aubrey&quot; was the 101st most popular girls&#x27; name in the United States.

==Etymology==

&quot;Aubrey&quot; is from the Norman French derivation &quot;Aubry&quot; of the Germanic given name &quot;Alberic&quot; / Old High German given name &quot;Alberich&quot;, which consists of the elements &quot;alb&quot; &#x27;elf&#x27; and &quot;ric&quot; &#x27;power&#x27; or &#x27;ruler&#x27;, Before being largely replaced by &quot;Aubrey&quot; after the Norman Conquest of England, the Anglo-Saxons used the native form &quot;Ælfrīc&quot;.

The mediaeval feminine name &quot;Aubrée&quot;, independently derived from the Germanic name &quot;Alberada&quot;, was common in Normandy and Post-Conquest England. However, it had fallen out of use entirely by the 15th century and appears to be unconnected with modern usage of &quot;Aubrey&quot;.

<text>The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC; ) is an agency of the Government of Canada that is responsible for public health, emergency preparedness and response, and infectious and chronic disease control and prevention.

==History==
The PHAC was formed because of a series of official inquiries about the SARS crisis in Canada which was particularly severe. For example, the province of Ontario inquiry and the National Advisory Committee on SARS and Public Health both recommended that a new organisation be formed. It was so instantiated, by Order in Council in 2004 under the Minister of State for Public Health (Canada) of the Martin government and subsequently by legislation that came into force on December 15, 2006 under the Harper government. It is part of the federal government&#x27;s Health Portfolio (along with Health Canada, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, and other organizations).

At the time of its creation in 2004, most of the agency&#x27;s staff were located in the former Gandalf Technologies building in Nepean, south of Ottawa, and were part of Health Canada&#x27;s Population and Public Health Branch. The first President of the PHAC and Chief Public Health Officer was David Butler-Jones.

In 2009, when the 2009 swine flu pandemic episode occurred, the PHAC had already been chartered for three years. In Canada, roughly 10% of the populace were infected with the virus, with 363 confirmed deaths (as of December 8); confirmed cases had reached 10,000 when Health Canada stopped counting in July. Canada began its vaccination campaign in October and vaccinated a higher proportion of its citizens than any other country. The pandemic was the subject of a review document, issued in November 2010.

The CPHO position was left vacant for 16 months until Dr Gregory W. Taylor was elevated to the post on 24 September 2014. Taylor had filled the position on an interim basis since the departure of David Butler-Jones.

===Changes towards a bicameral management structure (2014)===
In the November 2014 omnibus budget bill, the 28th Canadian Ministry of Stephen Harper decided to reorganise the management structure of PHAC. Whereas formerly the deputy civil servant charged with the operation of the PHAC was identical to the CPHO, the omnibus budget bill instituted a parallel Presidential structure to govern the organisation that then could be staffed by non-medical and non-scientific personnel. The NDP health critic said at the time that: &quot;To bury it in an omnibus bill says to me that they don&#x27;t want people to know about it and they don&#x27;t want questions,&quot; while Health Minister Rona Ambrose said that &quot;the idea for the new structure came from the agency itself.&quot;

===Official languages is a question of public health (2016)===
On 28 September 2016, the Commissioner of Official Languages (at the time Graham Fraser) told the Executive Committee of the PHAC that &quot;official languages leadership is also a question of public health&quot; in a speech authorized by President Siddika Mithani.

===GPHIN &quot;completely disbanded&quot; (2019)===
In 2015, CPHO Taylor left vacant a Beijing position, which had until 2015 &quot;stationed a Canadian doctor in the Chinese capital as a direct point of connection to Chinese health officials (and an independent observer). In the absence of its own early-warning system, Canada was forced to rely more heavily on the WHO.&quot; Adjunct professor at the University of Ottawa and national security critic Wesley Wark laments that vacancy, and said &quot;What we didn&#x27;t have was the capacity – our own independent capacity – to verify&quot; the state of affairs in China, which was the source of the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak from which was drawn the raison-d&#x27;etre of the PHAC. This state of affairs came to light in various media at various times during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.

On 24 May 2019, the Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN) of PHAC was completely disbanded and a &quot;department edict that all such alerts had to be approved by senior managers&quot; of PHAC was issued. On 30 July 2020, the auditor general of Canada took notice of a &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; report in which whistleblowers had participated and launched an investigation into the scandal. The GPHIN had been part of Canada&#x27;s contribution to the WHO, which described GPHIN as &quot;a cornerstone&quot; and &quot;the foundation&quot; of global early warning. In fact &quot;approximately 20 per cent of the WHO&#x27;s epidemiological intelligence&quot; had come from GPHIN before it was silenced.

===Resignation of senior managers (2020)===
On September 18, 2020 while Parliament was prorogued, Tina Namiesniowski, who was then the President of the PHAC resigned 17 months into her five-year tenure, which had begun on May 6, 2019. Her resignation followed the resignation of Vice-President in charge of the pandemic early warning system and emergency stockpile who had resigned earlier in the week. Iain Stewart was transferred from the National Research Council of Canada to head up the troubled division.

===Disgrace of Chinese scientists (2019-2021)===
The PHAC controls and funds the National Microbiology Laboratory BSL4 lab at which Xiangguo Qiu and her husband Keding Cheng performed their research into dangerous infectious diseases like Ebola and the West Nile virus. In July 2019 the Chinese nationals were fired from their &quot;non-salaried&quot; positions at the University of Winnipeg and &quot;an unknown number of her [UW] students from China were removed from the lab on July 5&quot; after the RCMP was called in May 2019 to investigate the curious affair of a trans-Pacific shipment of BSL4-grade viruses; at the time the PHAC was not identified by the CBC as other than an interested party although her LinkedIn page does list her employer since 2003 as the PHAC. In May 2021, it came to light that the PHAC had employed the pair until their dismissal in January 2021. As of May 2021 the PHAC &quot;has repeatedly declined to divulge to the House of Commons special committee on Canada-China relations&quot; the reason for their dismissal, a situation which puzzles certain Parliamentarians because Parliament through their agent the Cabinet funds the PHAC. In the event of continued rebuff from the President of the PHAC, the Parliamentarians have already voted to send the issue to the House from which they were delegated. The President has legal advice from government solicitors in which he is advised against disclosure, but the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs named Rob Oliphant broadcast his non-confidence in the legal advice of the government of which he is a member. The Canadian Security Intelligence Service had &quot;urged the removal of the security clearances&quot; of the Chinese pair, the event of which brought the matter to public light in July 2019. Stewart said March 2021 that the January 2021 termination of the scientists was due to a &quot;number of review processes&quot; initiated by the PHAC in 2018, &quot;relating to possible breaches of security protocols&quot;.

It later came to light that a soldier from the People&#x27;s Liberation Army of China named Feihu Yan had worked at the NML, co-authored six scholarly papers with Qiu while s/he was employed by the Chinese Academy of Military Medical Sciences, and furthermore had been paid by the PHAC for parts of this five-year collaboration which began before &quot;early 2016&quot;. Qiu has co-authored at least eight publications with Yan. A retired CSIS director observed that Canadian researchers are subject to stringent security checks and that this national security procedure somehow appeared to have been bypassed by the Chinese soldier. Feihu participated in studies of Ebola, Lassa fever and Rift Valley fever. As of June 2021, the CBC had informants inside the NML who had seen &quot;the Chinese military scientist&quot; Feihu &quot;at the NML&quot;,

It was revealed in June 2021 that, during the initial RCMP investigation, &quot;several computers had been seized, a lab log book was missing and Qiu&#x27;s regular trips to China were suspended.&quot; The CBC reporter was under the impression that two clearances are required to work at the NML: one under the HPTA and another &quot;secret level clearance&quot;, but she does not disclose the name nor the controller of this latter clearance.

The CBC reported in June 2021 that they had seen government documents through the Access to Information Act that revealed Qiu to have been funded by a third-party not PHAC for her Chinese travels, of which there were &quot;at least five trips&quot; during 2017 and 2018. The identity of the funder had been redacted by government.

Qiu appears to have defected, since she has published 32 academic papers since she was escorted from the NML in July 2019, although Qiu was on the payroll of PHAC until January 2021. The CBC had actually asked Wang Wenbin of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (China) in June 2021 at his weekly press conference &quot;if Qiu and Cheng were involved in espionage on behalf of the Chinese government.&quot; Meanwhile the Trudeau government sent the matter to the NSICOP, which was created in 2017 by Justin Trudeau to review matters relating to national security or intelligence.

A former Crown prosecutor saw parallels to the 20th century Project Sidewinder, a joint RCMP-CSIS effort which found that &quot;the Chinese government and Asian criminal gangs had been working together in drug smuggling, nuclear espionage and other criminal activities that constituted a threat to Canadian security&quot;, an inconvenient truth that the Chretien government wanted to silence. Christian Leuprecht, an academic at the Royal Military College says this reveals larger security issues at the NML: &quot;This would also explain why you haven&#x27;t charged them, because once you charge them, then eventually you have to put people on trial. And when you put people on trial, then you have to disclose the evidence that you have. So the government might quite intentionally trying to keep this sort of relatively below the radar as much as it can,&quot; not to mention the fact that there is no facility in Canadian law which allows trial in absentia.

== COVID-19 ==
The PHAC has played a central leadership role in Canada&#x27;s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

=== Clinical Pharmacology Task Group ===
In 2020, the PHAC convened the COVID-19 Clinical Pharmacology Task Group. The CPTG was an ad-hoc advisory committee composed of experts in the fields of infectious disease, microbiology, clinical pharmacology and pharmaceutical sciences. The group&#x27;s work concluded on March 30, 2021, and their statements removed from the government website. Membership of the CPTG included:
* Marina Salvadori, Public Health Agency of Canada (Co-chair)
* Michael Rieder, University of Western Ontario (Co-chair)
* Marie Lordkipanidze, Université de Montréal
* Richard Hall, Dalhousie University
* Micheline Piquette-Miller, University of Toronto
* Abby Collier, University of British Columbia
* Srinivas Murthy, University of British Columbia
* Jonathan Kimmelman, McGill University

The CPTG released several statements regarding COVID-19 treatments, advising against hydroxychloroquine while advocating for dexamethasone in hospitalized patients. Considering remdesivir, the group recommended only administering the drug as a part of a clinical trial.

==Organizational structure==

The president is a Governor in Council appointment for a term of five years. While in early years of the PHAC the President of the organization was identical to the Chief Public Health Officer, who is required by law to be a scientist, the Harper government innovated to manage the organization via the more malleable civil service, and a split personality developed with the twin agencies of President and CPHO.

The post of President is presently held by Iain Stewart, who was appointed on 21 September 2020 to replace Tina Namiesniowski. Vice-president of the Health Security Infrastructure Branch Sally Thornton was also dismissed on 15 September in the midst of controversy over the disbandment of the GPHIN system.

The chief public health officer (CPHO) is Canada&#x27;s lead health professional. The CPHO is also a Governor-in-Council appointment whose role is to provide advice both to the Minister of Health and to the President of the PHAC. Dr. Theresa Tam was named CPHO on June 26, 2017.

The &quot;Public Health Agency of Canada Act&quot; empowers the CPHO to communicate with other levels of government, voluntary organizations, the private sector and Canadians on public health issues. Each year, the CPHO is required to submit a report to the Minister of Health on the state of public health in Canada.

The PHAC houses several bureaucrats:
* Chief Public Health Officer
* Chief Science Officer
* Senior Assistant Deputy Minister—Population and Public Health Integration Branch
* Assistant Deputy Minister—Infectious Disease and Emergency Preparedness
* Deputy CPHO—Health Protection and Chronic Disease Prevention Branch
* Vice-President, Health Promotion and Chronic Disease Prevention Branch
* Executive Director—Corporate Secretariat
* Vice-President, Health Security Infrastructure Branch
* Vice-President, Strategic Policy and Planning Branch

Because the portfolio at the PHAC crosses so many boundaries, and especially jurisdictional ones, the civil servants have evolved what are known as Special Advisory Committees (SAC), which include Federal/Provincial/Territorial (FPT) officials such as deputy ministers of health, so as to attempt to ensure a timely response to the needs of Canadians.

The Public Health Network Council (PHNC) is an FPT committee that is co-chaired by the deputy CPHO, Dr Howard Njoo. The PHNC is populated by an array of directors, deputies, chiefs, experts and coordinators, from far and wide the public health guardians of Canada.

The FPT SAC on Public Health Response Plan for Biological Events has been in place since at least October 2017:
==Headquarters and leadership==
The PHAC headquarters are located in two pillars—one is in Ottawa, and the other is the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, Manitoba, the location of Canada&#x27;s only Level 4 microbiology lab for human health. Both the President and the CPHO officiate from Ottawa. The President is ranked above the CPHO in the departmental org chart.

;President:
# Dr. David Butler-Jones until June 2013
# Dr. Gregory W. Taylor appears to have acted as President from June 2013
# On 24 October 2014, Krista Outhwaite was appointed by the Harper government.
# Siddika Mithani was appointed President by Justin Trudeau on 11 April 2016, until her departure for the Presidency of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency on 25 February 2019.
# Kristina Namiesniowski was named President by Justin Trudeau on 26 April 2019, and took the reins on 6 May 2019.
# Iain Stewart took the helm on 21 September 2020. He was reportedly &quot;an extremely strategic thinker&quot;.

;CPHO:
# Dr. David Butler-Jones was the agency&#x27;s first joint CPHO and President, until his retirement in June 2013.
# Dr. Gregory W. Taylor appears to have acted as CPHO from June 2013
# Dr. Gregory W. Taylor held the position of CPHO from September 2014 until his retirement in December 2016, at which time his deputy was appointed to act in his stead.
# Dr. Theresa Tam was appointed CPHO on 26 June 2017. Tam also was acting president during the interregnum between the departure of Mithani and the appointment of Namiesniowski.

==Responsibilities==
The PHAC is the locus of control for several systemic healthcare defences, amongst which are included:
* National Emergency Stockpile System
* National Antiviral Stockpile
* Infectious Disease Prevention and Control Branch
* Prion Diseases Program
* Disease Control and Detection
* Health Safety
** Travel Alerts
** Immunization and Vaccines
** Emergency Preparedness
** Health Promotion
** Injury Prevention
* Research and Statistics
* Health Education

As well as the above, the PHAC houses the Centre for Emergency Preparedness and Response (CEPR), Canadian Field Epidemiology Program (CFEP) and the Canadian Public Health Service (CPHS).

=== Centre for Emergency Preparedness and Response ===
The CEPR is responsible for possible health risks from:
* natural events and disasters such as floods, earthquakes, fires and highly dangerous infectious diseases; and
* accidents or criminal and terrorist acts involving explosives, chemicals, radioactive substances or biological threats.

=== Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Surveillance System ===
The PHAC houses the Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Surveillance System (CJDSS) at its Ottawa headquarters.

=== Canada Communicable Disease Report ===

&quot;The Canada Communicable Disease Report (CCDR) is a bilingual, peer-reviewed journal on infectious diseases.&quot; It appears &quot;on the first Thursday of each month, with combined issues in March/April and July/August. CCDR publishes surveillance reports, outbreak reports, original research, rapid communications, advisory committee statements and more... The journal has been in continuous publication since 1975,&quot; first by Health Canada. Since the 2004 bouleversement it has been published by PHAC. As of May 2020, the duties of Editor-in-Chief were delegated to Michel Deilgat, who resided in the Office of the Chief Science Officer at the Infectious Disease Prevention and Control Branch. The French title of the publication is &quot;Relevé des maladies transmissibles au Canada.&quot;

The past Editor-in-Chief who had the office from 2013 to 2019 was named Patricia Huston.

===Canadian Notifiable Disease Surveillance System===
The Canadian Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (CNDSS) &quot;collects, validates and maintains basic surveillance data on approximately 60 nationally notifiable diseases, dating back to 1924. Nationally notifiable diseases are infectious diseases that have been identified by the federal government and provinces and territories as priorities for monitoring and control efforts. Provinces and territories voluntarily submit annual notifiable disease data, which are used to produce national disease counts and rates. Age-group and sex breakdown are presented from 1991 onward.&quot; &quot;Case definitions for nationally notifiable diseases are intended to support public health activities rather than clinical diagnosis. Standardized case definitions for NND were first developed through a federal/provincial/territorial process in 1991, with subsequent editions in 2000 and 2009. Following the 2009 revision, the decision was taken to make future updates on a case-by-case basis.&quot;

=== Canadian Adverse Events Following Immunization Surveillance System (CAEFISS) ===
The Canadian Adverse Events Following Immunization Surveillance System (CAEFISS) is a &quot;federal, provincial and territorial (FPT) public health post-market vaccine safety surveillance system&quot; managed by PHAC. CAEFISS receives passive reports of Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) as well as engages in active monitoring of marketed vaccines in Canada. Pharmacovigilance related to AEFI is a shared responsibility between Health Canada and PHAC.

==Annual reports==
The PHAC produces numerous reports, amongst which are the annual CPHO reports to the public as well as the annual departmental results summary which is provided for a Parliamentary audience.
===CPHO reports===
The CPHO produces yearly public health reports which &quot;summarize evidence on high-priority public health issues and provide a way forward to improve the health of Canadians.&quot;

<text>PANDORA, or Pandora, is a national web archive for the preservation of Australia&#x27;s online publications. Established by the National Library of Australia in 1996, it has been built in collaboration with Australian state libraries and cultural collecting organisations, including the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, the Australian War Memorial, and the National Film and Sound Archive. It is now one of three components of the Australian Web Archive.

The name, PANDORA, is a bacronym which describes its purpose: Preserving and Accessing Networked Documentary Resources of Australia.

==History==

The National Library of Australia (NLA) began selecting suitable online publications at the beginning of 1996, after recognising &quot;the need to preserve Australia&#x27;s documentary heritage in online formats as well as in the traditional formats of its existing collections&quot;. After investigating the landscape of &quot;Australian electronic publications&quot; between 1993 and 1996, staff (initially four) were committed to the PANDORA program. Following a six-month period of testing and experimentation, the NLA committed to collecting materials in online formats. A system to store, manage and provide access to these online publications was built by the NLA, which includes PANDORA, a set of policies and procedures and a technical infrastructure.

The first two titles were downloaded in October 1996. By June 1997 the archive contained 31 titles. With the sheer volume of content that needed archiving, it was essential to collaborate with other organisations, and in 1998 the State Library of Victoria came on board. By 2000, 600 titles had been archived, at which time the website was redesigned. The new site added subject-level access to titles and included documents relating to the PANDORA project.

In August 1998 the State Library of Victoria became a participant in adding content. In 2000, ScreenSound Australia (now National Film and Sound Archive) joined as a collaborating partner. By 2003, all of the mainland State libraries, the Northern Territory Library, the National Film and Sound Archive, the Australian War Memorial and the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) had become participants. The State Library of Tasmania has not participated in PANDORA, at the time of inception running its own web archiving project called &quot;Our Digital Island&quot;.

==Description==

===Selection criteria===
The PANDORA archive collects certain Australian web resources according to a specified selection policy, preserves them, and makes them available for viewing. Content must be about Australia, and is selected based on its cultural significance and research value; and must be &quot;on a subject of social, political, cultural, religious, scientific or economic significance and relevance to Australia and be written by an Australian author; or be written by an Australian recognised authority and constitute a contribution to international knowledge&quot;.

The provision for legal deposit of digital format publications was added to the &quot;Australian Copyright Act 1968&quot; in 2016 so the National Library of Australia may copy Australian websites without acquiring permission. They do notify publishers before copying a website to the PANDORA archive, and may request publisher assistance if required.

Selection also gives priority to six categories of publication:
*Commonwealth and ACT government publications
*Publications of tertiary education institutions
*Conference proceedings 
*E-journals
*Titles referred by indexing and abstracting agencies
*Topical sites in nominated subject areas, collected on a rolling three-year basis, and those documenting issues of current social or political interest (such as elections, Sydney Olympics)

As time and staff resources permit, high quality sites outside these categories may be included, within certain guidelines, for instance, &quot;Personal sites will usually only be selected if they provide information of outstanding research value unavailable elsewhere or if they are of exceptional quality or particular interest&quot;.

===Software===
The archival management system called PANDAS (PANDORA Digital Archiving System) is used to add a title into PANDORA. This was developed and is maintained by the National Library of Australia. The latest version is PANDAS 3, which was deployed in mid-2007.

==Current and future status==
In March 2019 it became part of larger the Australian Web Archive, which comprises the PANDORA Archive, the Australian Government Web Archive (AGWA) and the National Library&#x27;s &quot;.au&quot; domain collections, using a single interface in Trove which is publicly available.

, there were 62,959 archived titles, using 49.63 TB of data.

<text>Adrian Maxwell Sherwood (born 20 January 1958) is an English record producer specialising in the genre of dub music. He has created a distinctive production style based on the application of dub effects and dub mixing techniques to other forms of electronic dance music and popular music outside of the genre. Adrian has been credited as a pioneer in the emerging genre of ReggaeEDM. He has worked extensively with a variety of reggae artists as well as the musicians Keith LeBlanc, Doug Wimbish and Skip McDonald. Sherwood has remixed tracks by Coldcut, Depeche Mode, The Woodentops, Primal Scream, Pop Will Eat Itself, Sinéad O&#x27;Connor, and Skinny Puppy. In his role as a record producer he has worked with a variety of record labels; however, his best-known label is On-U Sound Records which he founded in 1979. Sherwood has been a member of the band Tackhead. He considers himself tone deaf, and focuses on making sounds and noises rather than melody.

==Career==
Sherwood was co-founder of Carib Gems and Pressure Sounds, and founder of Hitrun Records as well as Green Tea Records and Soundboy Records. He is also the fourth member of industrial hip-hop outfit Tackhead, credited as &quot;mixologist&quot;.

During the early 1980s he brought together many Jamaican artists under the collective name of Singers and Players, including Prince Far I, Mikey Dread, Bim Sherman and many others; this helped promote the individual artists at the same time as promoting the On-U Sound Records label. He also worked with Suns of Arqa on many of their early records.
In 1982, Adrian produced an EP, Hot Sagas, with a version of Love for Sale sung by Anne Pigalle, released on Illuminated Records. Together with Style Scott he formed the band Dub Syndicate, which went on eventually to produce over a dozen albums.

In 1986, he began working with Jamaican dub producer and singer Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry. They produced the album &quot;Time Boom X De Devil Dead&quot;.

He made contributions to the industrial genre in his remix of Einstürzende Neubauten&#x27;s song &quot;Yü Gung&quot; on the album &quot;Halber Mensch&quot;, as well as his production work with Ministry, Skinny Puppy, Cabaret Voltaire, KMFDM, Terminal Power Company and Nine Inch Nails. Sherwood has also delved into the blues, producing Little Axe&#x27;s Real World Records release &quot;Champagne &amp; Grits&quot; in 2006.

In 2003, Sherwood supported Blur at Wolverhampton Civic Hall. The same year, Sherwood released his first album as a solo artist, &quot;Never Trust a Hippy&quot;, which featured collaborations with various artists such as Sly &amp; Robbie, Steven &quot;Lenky&quot; Marsden, Carlton &quot;Bubblers&quot; Ogilvie and Jazzwad.

In 2006 he released his second album &quot;Becoming a Cliché&quot;, again with numerous artists such as Perry, the late Bim Sherman, Dennis Bovell, Little Roy, LSK, Samia Farah, Raiz and Mark Stewart. A limited edition, 2-disc version was released simultaneously with the second disc titled &quot;Dub Cliché&quot;.

On beginning a solo career, Sherwood stated: &quot;I wanted to do some of my own writing and make something that was challenging for me... As a producer, it&#x27;s my job to satisfy the artist foremost. I wanted to make something that was a little more aggressive and modern. I wanted to paint a picture that was contemporary, one that specifically showed where my brain was at. I&#x27;ve got to the point in my life where it&#x27;s time for me to call all of the shots.&quot;

He produced the original score for the 2006 independent film &quot;Johnny Was&quot;, starring Vinnie Jones, Roger Daltrey and Samantha Mumba. Since 2015, Sherwood commissioned an album from Bristol dubstep artist Pinch; which he twiddled a few knobs on and released under the moniker &quot;Sherwood and Pinch&quot;.

On 21 September 2022, American rock band Spoon announced &quot;Lucifer on the Moon&quot;, a track-by-track dub reworking of &quot;Lucifer on the Sofa&quot;, with all remixes by Adrian Sherwood. The album was released on November 4, 2022.

<text>David Butler-Jones is a Canadian physician and public servant who served as the first chief public health officer of Canada from the position&#x27;s formation in October 2004 until stepping down in June 2013. 

== Biography &amp; career ==
Butler-Jones was born in Toronto. In 1978, he graduated with a doctorate of medicine from the University of Toronto. He completed his residency in family medicine at Queens University, obtaining his Canadian College of Family Medicine certification in 1980. He also obtained a master of health science degree in community health and epidemiology from the University of Toronto.

Having worked as a physician for a time in Newfoundland and Labrador, in March 1983 the Algoma Health Unit appointed him the medical officer of health for the district of Algoma in northern Ontario, including Sault Ste. Marie. In 1985, he helped to lead referenda to add fluoride to municipal drinking water. While voters in the town of Wawa approved the plan, voters in Sault Ste. Marie rejected it for a third time.

In Algoma, he also helped to create a community psychiatric program to provide support for adults with mental illness in their own homes to prevent what he called &quot;the revolving door syndrome&quot; where people coping with chronic mental illness would repeatedly find themselves in hospital.

In September 1986, Butler-Jones became the medical officer of health for Simcoe County.

From 1995 to 2002, Butler-Jones served as the chief medical health officer and executive director of the Population Health and Primary Health Services branches for the province of Saskatchewan.

Previously, he taught at both the undergraduate and graduate levels and was involved as a researcher in public health issues. He was a professor in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Manitoba as well as a clinical professor with the Department of Community Health and Epidemiology at the University of Saskatchewan&#x27;s College of Medicine.

===Public Health Agency of Canada===
As the chief public health officer, Butler-Jones was both the lead health professional in the government and the deputy minister for the Public Health Agency of Canada. Over the course of his career, he worked in many parts of Canada in both public health and clinical medicine.

The chief public health officer was the head of PHAC until the 2014 omnibus budget bill, in which the government of Stephen Harper decided to reorganize the management structure of PHAC to institute a parallel presidential structure to govern the organization that then could be staffed by non-medical and non-scientific personnel.

After a stroke in 2012, Butler-Jones stepped down as chief public health officer in June 2013 to focus on rehabilitation. He was succeeded by Gregory Taylor. 

Following his recovery, Butler-Jones has worked in a variety of roles, speaking, teaching and serving on boards, as well as advising on public health and health system issues, especially as they relate to indigenous health.

===Professional organizations===

In professional organizations, he has served as president of the Canadian Public Health Association; vice president of the American Public Health Association; chair of the Canadian Roundtable on Health and Climate Change; international regent on the board of the American College of Preventive Medicine; member of the Governing Council for the Canadian Population Health Initiative; chair of the National Coalition on Enhancing Preventive Practices of Health Professionals; and co-chair of the Canadian Coalition for Public Health in the 21st Century.

==Honours==

In recognition of his work in the field of public health, York University&#x27;s Faculty of Health and Carleton University have awarded him an honorary doctor of laws degree. 

The University of Waterloo conferred a doctor of science degree on him in 2017. 

He is also a recipient of The Canadian Public Health Association&#x27;s R D Defries Award, its highest honour. 

He has also been recognized by the College of Family Physicians and Scotiabank Family Medicine Lectureship and received the Medal of Service from the Canadian Medical Association for &quot;his outstanding and exceptional contribution to health care in Canada&quot; as well as the President&#x27;s Award of the Public Health Physicians of Canada.

<text>John A. C. Menton (September 4, 1866 – December 24, 1947) was an American politician, the only Socialist mayor of Flint, Michigan (1911–1912). Menton was not only a member of the Socialist Party of America, he was also secretary-treasurer of the Central Labor Council and president of the local Cigar Makers&#x27; Union, one of the largest in the city. In 1906 and 1910 he ran unsuccessfully as a Socialist candidate for U.S. Representative from Michigan, 6th District.

Due to a coalition of the Democratic Party, Republican Party, General Motors Corporation and Charles S. Mott in the so-called Independent Citizen&#x27;s Party, Menton was decisively defeated in the 1912 election, never to serve again.

<text>Artyom Andreyevich &quot;Artemis&quot; Chubarov (; born December 13, 1979) is a Russian former professional ice hockey player. He last played with HC Dynamo Moscow of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). He also played for the Vancouver Canucks of the National Hockey League (NHL) and for their minor league affiliates in both the International Hockey League and American Hockey League.

==Playing career==
Artyom Chubarov was selected 31st overall in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft. He was the 2nd selection for the Vancouver Canucks. Prior to this, he spent four years playing in Russian ice hockey leagues, including the Torpedo organization in Nizhny Novgorod and HC Dynamo Moscow. Chubarov would spend one final season with Dynamo, which was highlighted by playing for the gold-medal-winning Russian team at the 1999 World Junior Championships in Winnipeg. Chubarov scored the winning goal in overtime of the final game against Canadian goaltender Roberto Luongo in the final game to give his team a 3–2 victory.

He then joined the Canucks for most of the 1999–2000 season, spending the rest with Syracuse of the AHL. He missed most of the 2000–01 season, playing only one game, after a shoulder injury while with Kansas City of the IHL.

Between the 1999–2000 and 2001–02 seasons, Chubarov would switch from the Canucks to their farm teams, playing for Syracuse, Kansas City, and Manitoba. He set a new NHL record by becoming the first player in NHL history to begin his career with four consecutive game-winning goals.

By the 2002–03 season, he finally earned a permanent spot with the Canucks as a faceoff specialist and defensive centre, helping them to the playoffs in both 2002–03 and 2003-2004.

With the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Chubarov joined his former team Dynamo Moscow. At the end of the lockout, it was reported he had refused to rejoin the Canucks, instead choosing to play in Russia. On August 22, 2005, he was signed by Avangard Omsk of the Super League, leaving Dynamo.

Chubarov joined Torpedo Nizhny Novgorod of the newly formed KHL to start the 2008–09 season.

==International play==



Chubarov won the gold medal with Russia at the 1999 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, scoring the tournament-winning goal in overtime. He later took part in 2004 World Cup of Hockey.

<text>The chief public health officer of Canada (CPHO; ) is the lead health professional and primary spokesperson on public health related matters for the Government of Canada. The chief public health officer provides advice to the minister of health and the president of the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), works in collaboration with the agency president in the agency&#x27;s leadership and management, and works with other departments and levels of government on public health matters. PHAC, along with the CPHO post was established in 2004 amidst the SARS crisis.

The third and current chief public health officer of Canada is Theresa Tam, who was appointed in June 2017. 

== Overview ==
The CPHO position was created by Carolyn Bennett in her position as Minister of State for Public Health (Canada) in 2004, along with the Public Health Agency of Canada. Per the &quot;Public Health Agency of Canada Act&quot; (2006), the CPHO holds office &quot;during pleasure for a term not exceeding five years&quot;. The CPHO can be reappointed for additional terms.

The CPHO is selected through an open and transparent national competitive process, and is appointed by the Governor-in-Council. The process is merit-based: as per the &quot;Public Health Agency of Canada Act&quot;, the CPHO must be a qualified public health professional.

== Responsibilities ==
The CPHO is responsible for:

* Providing public health advice to the minister of health and to the president of the Public Health Agency of Canada, and, as appropriate, work with other federal departments and agencies, provincial/territorial governments, the international community, health practitioners and Canadians on public health issues;
* Giving the minister of health an annual report on Canadian public health;
* Providing leadership of the Public Health Agency of Canada;
* Taking a leadership/advocacy role in national public health matters and citizen engagement in public health;
* Taking accountability for health provisions related to official acts (eg. the &quot;Quarantine Act,&quot; the &quot;Department of Health Act,&quot; the &quot;Public Health Agency of Canada Act,&quot; and the &quot;Human Pathogens and Toxins Act&quot;); and
* Assuming the role of the federal government spokesperson on public health issues, in particular, during public health emergencies.

During public health emergencies, such as outbreaks or natural disasters, the CPHO is responsible for:
* Working with relevant professionals and officials to plan responses and to provide Canadians with information about plan outbreak responses and how to protect themselves;
* Providing briefings and advice to the president of the Public Health Agency, the minister of health, and others; and
* Communicating public health information to Canadians via different channels.

The chief public health officer was the head of the Public Health Agency of Canada until 2014, in which government of Prime Minister Stephen Harper reorganized the management structure of PHAC through a 2014 omnibus budget bill and instituted a parallel presidential-structure and position to govern the organization, that then could be staffed by non-medical and non-scientific personnel. The NDP health critic said at the time that: &quot;To bury it in an omnibus bill says to me that they don&#x27;t want people to know about it and they don&#x27;t want questions,&quot; while Health Minister Rona Ambrose said that &quot;the idea for the new structure came from the agency itself,&quot; which was led at the time on an interim basis for the previous 16 months by Gregory W. Taylor.

== Areas of focus ==

=== 2017–present ===
Theresa Tam, who has held the position since June 26 2017, released a vision statement in early 2018. She wishes to pay particular attention to the reduction of health discrepancies in the country, which includes collaborating with and reducing the socioeconomic gap of Indigenous Peoples. Her six areas of focus are currently:
# The risks of antimicrobial resistance and the correct use of antibiotics;
# Building healthy environments that reduce health discrepancies;
# The championing of youth health;
# The reduction of blood-borne and sexually transmitted infections;
# The reduction of Tuberculosis in at-risk populations; and
# Promoting education on substances (especially alcohol, opioids and marijuana), particularly their effects on youth

As CPHO, Tam wrote &quot;Fifteen years post-SARS: Key milestones in Canada&#x27;s public health emergency response&quot;, in which she remarked somewhat presciently as it turns out that:
==Chief public health officers==
Theresa Tam is the third and present CPHO. Initially taking on the role in an acting capacity on December 16, 2016 following the retirement of Gregory Taylor, Tam was formally appointed on June 26, 2017, and led the Government of Canada&#x27;s COVID-19 response in 2020.

<text>Jay Ferguson (born October 14, 1968) is a Canadian musician and a member of the rock band Sloan. 

== Biography ==
When Ferguson was 12 years old, he was given a job at Ol&#x27;Dan&#x27;s Records, a secondhand record store. Before joining Sloan, Ferguson was in a band with Chris Murphy from 1987 to 1990 called Kearney Lake Road. In 1991, Ferguson and Murphy started Sloan along with Patrick Pentland and Andrew Scott. Ferguson plays rhythm guitar and occasionally bass and drums. Some of Ferguson&#x27;s songwriting contributions, each of which he sings lead vocals on, are &quot;I Hate My Generation&quot; from the album &quot;Twice Removed&quot;, &quot;The Lines You Amend&quot; from &quot;One Chord to Another&quot;, &quot;Who Taught You to Live Like That?&quot; from the album &quot;Never Hear the End of It&quot;, &quot;Witch&#x27;s Wand&quot; from the album &quot;Parallel Play&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;ve Got A Lot On Your Mind&quot; from the album &quot;Commonwealth&quot; and &quot;Right To Roam&quot; from the 2018 album &quot;12&quot;.

In December 2005, Ferguson began hosting a show on CBC Radio 3 with Sloan bandmate Chris Murphy. Their show broadcasts Saturday and Sunday on Sirius Satellite Radio station (channel 94).

Ferguson also collaborates with other musicians and can be heard on Gentleman Reg&#x27;s 2004 release &quot;Darby &amp; Joan&quot;. He also occasionally DJs at Toronto area clubs.

In 2005, Halifax musician Mary Cobham released an album about the Sloan member called &quot;Songs in the Key of Jay&quot;, which explores themes of Teenie-Bop magazines and her long-standing crush on Jay Ferguson.

==Personal life==
Ferguson is the only member in Sloan originally from Nova Scotia.

<doc id="1170928" wikidata="Q6692217" url="?curid=1170928" title="Lovell House">
<text>The Lovell House or Lovell Health House is an International style modernist residence designed and built by Richard Neutra between 1927 and 1929. The home, located at 4616 Dundee Drive in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, was built for the physician and naturopath Philip Lovell. It is considered a major monument in architectural history, and was a turning point in Neutra&#x27;s career.

It is often described as the first steel frame house in the United States, and also an early example of the use of gunite (sprayed-on concrete). Neutra was familiar with steel construction due to his earlier work with the Chicago firm Holabird &amp; Roche. Neutra served as the contractor for the project because no residential contractors were willing to construct a steel frame home due to the industry&#x27;s unfamiliarity with and outright distaste for industrial materials employed for residential work.

==History==
Philip Lovell was enchanted with the house and praised his architect publicly. Lovell had previously commissioned architect Rudolf Schindler to build the landmark Lovell Beach House in 1926. Neutra and Schindler were contemporaries in Europe and the Neutras lived with the Schindlers (Schindler House) when they first settled in Los Angeles in 1925. Lovell chose Neutra instead of Schindler to build his Los Angeles home while they were living under the same roof. Neutra was known for his relationships with his clients—he thought of himself as a therapist and the client his patient. He spent time getting to know his clients and analyzed their needs.

Philip Lovell&#x27;s unconventional health philosophies heavily influenced the design and purpose of the Lovell House. Known for his advocacy of natural living, Lovell emphasized the integration of health-focused features such as outdoor spaces for sunbathing, a rooftop solarium, and rooms designed to maximize UV exposure. The home was one of the first in Los Angeles to include spaces dedicated to nude sunbathing, outdoor exercise, and vegetarian meal preparation, aligning with his belief in heliotherapy and drug-free living.

Lovell&#x27;s health-oriented ideals extended beyond architecture; he was a naturopath and a prominent health columnist for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. His columns, lectures, and radio broadcasts popularized alternative health practices in California, and the Lovell House became a physical manifestation of his lifestyle beliefs. This combination of health and architecture marked a significant departure from traditional residential designs of the time.

The Lovell house was an expensive house during the time. Lovell paid his contractor $58,672.32. Leah and Philip Lovell had differing views on what they remembered the cost estimate to be. Philip recalled $37,000, while Leah thought, $48,000. There was still an outstanding fee of $413 for Richard Neutra in 1930, which was part of the estimated total of $5863. 

The Lovell House was purchased in 1961 by Morton and Betty Topper. It was added to the list of Registered Historic Places in Los Angeles in 1971.

In 2021, art dealers Iwan and Manuela Wirth purchased the property for $8.75 million, &quot;with plans to bring back its original lustre.&quot;

==Design==
The Lovell House underwent multiple design iterations before its final construction. Early designs included an L-shaped structure descending a hillside in three levels, connected by a long balcony on the third floor. These designs emphasized stepped masses and earth ramps leading to a tennis court, reflecting the natural integration central to Richard Neutra&#x27;s architectural philosophy. Despite its later designation as the &quot;Health House,&quot; none of the initial designs included the extensive exercise facilities originally envisioned by Lovell.

In its final form, the house incorporated innovative structural elements, such as open-web steel joists and four-inch-square steel posts spaced at five-foot intervals, emphasizing Neutra&#x27;s mastery of steel construction techniques. While the steel cantilevers appear freestanding, they are supported by the roof structure. The exterior design features horizontal bands of metal lath and white stucco, creating visual rhythm by juxtaposing vertical and horizontal lines. These bands are further enhanced by the interplay of steel-framed windows and screens, which create a modular appearance emblematic of modernist principles.

The , three-story house aesthetically follows many of the principles of the International Style. It was included in the 1932 exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art in New York that retrospectively defined the style. In essence it reflects Neutra&#x27;s interest in industrial production, and this is most evident in the repetitive use of factory-made window assemblies. In fact, Neutra&#x27;s apprentice Harwell Hamilton Harris suggested that Neutra was drawn to America because of Henry Ford.

The Lovell House design incorporates functional spaces that reflect both modernist principles and the needs of its inhabitants. The main staircase, described as wide and open, connects the living quarters with a spacious area featuring floor-to-ceiling plate glass windows, providing sweeping views of the ocean and city. A centrally positioned fireplace in this space allows guests to simultaneously enjoy warmth and the dramatic evening skyline, exemplifying Neutra&#x27;s focus on blending comfort with scenic integration.

A dedicated library space for over a thousand volumes showcases adjustable shelving, direct and indirect lighting through a 52-foot trough, and natural materials such as mouse gray carpeting and natural-colored drapes. The library&#x27;s design includes a cozy corner with access to an outdoor patio and features built-in telephones and furnishings that highlight the forerunner of modern American interior finishes.

The interior reflects Neutra&#x27;s interest in Cubism, transparency, and hygiene. The &quot;minimal&quot; detailing shows the influence of Irving Gill. In another nod to industrial production, Neutra installed two Ford Model-A headlights in the main stairwell. (The headlights were provided by Neutra apprentice Gregory Ain.) The Historic American Buildings Survey described the Lovell House as &quot;a prime example of residential architecture where technology creates the environment.&quot;

The exterior consisted of a lightweight steel frame construction. The building used standard sections that related to the unit plan. The porches and balconies hung down from the roof level. This was done in order to avoid scattering the depth. The walls outside were 3.6&quot; expanded metal reinforced with 1 1/4&quot; of dense concrete walls (using spray-on concrete). The entrance of the house is on the top story, through a terrace. Upon entry, there is a framed view of an extravagant stairway. The main level of the house enclosed the living, dining, and guest rooms. The main level also had the kitchen while the top floor consisted of the family bedrooms. 

==In film productions and photography==
The house was used in the 1997 film &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; as the home of Pierce Morehouse Patchett, played by David Strathairn. It was also depicted in the film &quot;Beginners&quot; (Mike Mills, 2010) as the home of Oliver (Ewan McGregor) and his father Hal (Christopher Plummer). The house was first photographed by Willard Morgan (1900-1967). Photographs of the building were regarded highly so that the building could be seen by many other people. These images were included in the &quot;Modern Architecture&quot; exhibition of 1932 at the New York&#x27;s Museum of Modern Art (MOMA).

<text>In geometry, the augmented sphenocorona is the Johnson solid that can be constructed by attaching an equilateral square pyramid to one of the square faces of the sphenocorona. It is the only Johnson solid arising from &quot;cut and paste&quot; manipulations where the components are not all prisms, antiprisms or sections of Platonic or Archimedean solids.

== Construction ==
The augmented sphenocorona is constructed by attaching equilateral square pyramid to the sphenocorona, a process known as the augmentation. This pyramid covers one square face of the sphenocorona, replacing them with equilateral triangles. As a result, the augmented sphenocorona has 16 equilateral triangles and 1 square as its faces. The convex polyhedron with its faces are regular is the Johnson solid; the augmented sphenocorona is one of them, enumerated as formula_1, the 87th Johnson solid.

== Properties ==
For the edge length formula_2, the surface area of an augmented sphenocorona is by summing the area of 16 equilateral triangles and 1 square:
formula_3
Its volume can be calculated by slicing it into a sphenocorona and an equilateral square pyramid, and adding the volume subsequently:

<doc id="1170947" wikidata="Q5014316" url="?curid=1170947" title="CSS Manassas">
<text>CSS &quot;Manassas&quot;, formerly the steam icebreaker &quot;Enoch Train&quot;, was built in 1855 by James O. Curtis as a twin-screw towboat at Medford, Massachusetts. A New Orleans commission merchant, Captain John A. Stevenson, acquired her for use as a privateer after she was captured by another privateer (later gunboat) . Her fitting out as &quot;Manassas&quot; was completed at Algiers, Louisiana; her conversion to a ram of a radically modern design made her the first ironclad ship built for the Confederacy.

==Description==
Covered with iron plating, her above-water hull was reshaped into a curved &quot;turtle-back&quot; form; at its lowest when fully loaded, the hull projected only feet above the waterline, not counting her smokestacks (surviving accounts and period illustrations vary showing &quot;Manassas&quot; was equipped with either a single or two side-by-side smokestacks, possibly slanted back at a rakish angle). The convex shape of her iron-plated topside was intended to cause cannon shot to glance off harmlessly. She was in length, overall, and had a hull beam and draught. Her bow was fitted with a pointed iron ram to stave holes in Union vessels, and she also carried a forward-firing cannon behind a single gun port with an armored shutter. Her low profile made her a difficult target, while her curved armor iron plate protected her against all but the most well-directed Union cannon fire. Lying low in the water, she looked like a floating cigar or egg and was described by Union intelligence as a &quot;hellish machine.&quot;

==Service history==
Commissioned as a Confederate privateer on 12 September 1861, &quot;Manassas&quot; was seized soon afterwards by Flag Officer George N. Hollins, CSN, for use in the lower Mississippi River. With Lieutenant A. F. Warley, CSN, in command, she participated in Flag Officer Hollins&#x27; surprise attack on the Federal blockading squadron at Head of Passes on 12 October 1861, the action being known as the Battle of the Head of Passes. In the action &quot;Manassas&quot; rammed , but the impact was partly absorbed by a coal barge tied alongside. &quot;Manassas&quot;, however, suffered the loss of her iron prow and smokestack(s) and had one of her two engines unseated from its mounts, temporarily putting it out of commission. She managed to retire under heavy fire from and &quot;Richmond&quot;, whose shells glanced off her armor. Two months after this engagement, &quot;Manassas&quot; was purchased for direct ownership and re-commissioned in the CSN by the Confederate Government.

Under Lieutenant Warley, CSS &quot;Manassas&quot; joined the force of Captain John K. Mitchell, CSN, commanding Confederate naval forces in the lower Mississippi. She participated in the Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip, during which Commodore David Farragut, USN, on his way to New Orleans, ran his fleet past the Confederate forts of Fort Jackson and Fort St. Philip. In the action &quot;Manassas&quot; attempted to ram , which turned in time to avoid the heavy blow and delivered a full broadside at close range. &quot;Manassas&quot; then ran into more murderous fire from the whole line of the Union fleet. She then charged and delivered a long glancing blow to her hull, also firing her single cannon as she rammed. Next she rammed , again firing her cannon, injuring her deeply, but not fatally.


After this action &quot;Manassas&quot; followed the Union fleet quietly for a while, but as she drew closer &quot;Mississippi&quot; furiously turned on her and made an attempt to ram the ironclad. &quot;Manassas&quot; managed to dodge the blow but ran aground in the process. Her crew managed to escape as &quot;Mississippi&quot; poured heavy broadsides into the stranded Confederate ram. Now on fire, &quot;Manassas&quot; slipped off the bank and drifted down the river past the Union mortar flotilla. Commander David Dixon Porter, USN, in command of the mortar boats, tried to save her as an engineering curiosity, but &quot;Manassas&quot; exploded and immediately plunged under water, a total loss. In 1981, the National Underwater and Marine Agency located the suspected wreckage of the &quot;Manassas&quot; under a current levee on the bank of the Mississippi. 

Years after the war, in the book &quot;Battles and Leaders of the Civil War&quot;, there was a claim that a &quot;Manassas&quot; crewman was knocked off the ironclad by a Union sailor; however Lieutenant Warley reported no casualties among his &quot;Manassas&quot; crew in an official report dated 13 August 1863.

==Clipper==
Manassas is a similarly-named clipper, formerly the U.S. Revenue Cutter &quot;Afinot&quot;, was seized by the Confederates at New Bern, North Carolina, on 27 August 1861. With the launches &quot;Mosquito&quot; and Sand &quot;Fly,&quot; she was placed under Lt. W. H. Murdaugh, CSN, who was seriously wounded in the Federal attack on Fort Hatteras the next day, and was unable to assume his command. &quot;Manassas&quot; was active on the coast of North Carolina during 1861-62 and then dismantled by the Confederates.

<text>Jonathan Routh, born John Reginald Surdeval Routh, (24 November 1927 – 4 June 2008) co-starred in the British version of the television show &quot;Candid Camera&quot; (1960–67) and co-starred with Germaine Greer and Kenny Everett in a later attempt at a revival, &quot;Nice Time&quot; (1968). He published a number of humorous books, and also painted for many years.

==Background==
Routh was born on 24 November 1927 in Gosport, Hampshire, the son of a British Army colonel, and spent much of his early childhood in Palestine. He was educated at Uppingham School and Emmanuel College, Cambridge where he read history.

Routh had two sons from his first marriage (to the film designer Nandi Heckroth, in 1948), had a relationship in 1969 with the wife of Paul Hamlyn, and then another with the oil heiress Olga Deterding. He died in Jamaica on 4 June 2008.

==Television work==
Following a success with a British version of &quot;The Candid Microphone&quot; on Radio Luxembourg, Routh started a British version of its television successor &quot;Candid Camera&quot; around 1961 for ABC Weekend TV. Following a long dispute with the American lawyers of Allen Funt as to who held the rights to &quot;Candid Camera,&quot; Routh moved on to new fields, working with John Birt, later director general of the BBC, for Granada TV, along with Germaine Greer and Kenny Everett in &quot;Nice Time.&quot; He also worked in television advertising on spots such as J. Walter Thompson&#x27;s for Smarties and Kellogg&#x27;s Corn flakes, appearing also in some spots himself, for example Newcastle Brown Ale. The British version of &quot;Candid Camera&quot; returned in 1974, starring Peter Dulay, Arthur Atkins and Sheila Bernette. In 1976, Routh returned to the pranks and the show was retitled &quot;Jonathan Routh &amp; Candid Camera&quot;.

==Guidebooks created with John Glashan==

With John Glashan, Routh created an unusual set of small guidebooks: &quot;The Good Loo Guide&quot; and &quot;The Good Cuppa Guide&quot; (both about London), &quot;The Guide Porcelaine to the Loos of Paris&quot;, and &quot;The Better John Guide&quot; (about New York City). The humour owed much to the apparent seriousness, and to the affectionate parody of the connoisseurship of &quot;The Good Food Guide&quot; (then as now a trove of information on fine eating).

===&quot;The Good Loo Guide&quot;===
The &quot;Good Loo Guide&quot;, a compact fifty-page booklet subtitled &quot;Where to Go in London&quot;, written with Brigid Segrave and &quot;conveniently illustrated&quot; by John Glashan, was the first of the series, published in London by Wolfe in 1965. A note on the copyright page sets the tone:

This is an impartial guide. Our visits to loos have been anonymous. We have not declared ourselves even after making use of the establishment&#x27;s facilities. Nor have we at any time accepted hospitality, but paid cash for all chargeable facilities we have used.

Loos are rated by the application of stars, three-star establishments being &quot;worth travelling out of your way to experience&quot;. The illustrations are numerous as well as convenient, with Glashan&#x27;s characters (typically bearded men) experiencing various adventures and misadventures.

In the &quot;completely new &amp; revised&quot; edition of 1968, more is included, and ten establishments earn a new award, the &quot;Good Loo Royal Flush&quot;.

Two decades later, Routh (but not Glashan) would re-examine this issue with the &quot;Initial Good Loo Guide&quot;, on which see below.

===&quot;The Good Cuppa Guide&quot;===
The &quot;Good Cuppa Guide: Where to Have Tea in London&quot;, published in 1966, was &quot;blended&quot; by Routh and &quot;milked and sugared&quot; by Glashan. The format and charm (and, in its day, usefulness) are those of the &quot;Good Loo Guide&quot;. Providers of cuppas are rated with a maximum of five stars.

===&quot;Guide Porcelaine to the Loos of Paris&quot;===
Its title echoing that of the &quot;Guide Michelin&quot;, &quot;Guide Porcelaine to the Loos of Paris&quot; (1966) was similar to the London guide but additionally provided convenient phrases for the nervous British tourist. An example: &quot;Donnez-moi les ordres simples pour atteindre le pissoir le plus pres d&#x27;ici; et, s&#x27;il vous plait, sans les gesticulations sauvages et tumultueuses&quot;, i.e. &quot;Please direct me to the nearest loo in simple terms and without waving your hands in too dangerous a manner.&quot;

A French translation also appeared: &quot;Guide porcelaine des &quot;lieux&quot; de Paris&quot; (Editions de la Jeune Parque, 1967).

===&quot;The Better John Guide&quot;===
Unlike the three-and-sixpenny (3s 6d, 17½p) booklets described above, &quot;The Better John Guide: Where to Go in New York&quot; (New York: Putnam, 1966) was a $2.50 hardback. Written with Serena Stewart, it had &quot;graffiti&quot; by Glashan, largely recycled from the &quot;convenient&quot; illustrations of &quot;The Good Loo Guide&quot;. Some of the text was recycled too — understandably so, as neither work was likely to have been known in the other city.

==Art==
Routh also painted for many years, concentrating on depicting the Queen Victoria of his imagination and nuns, as he claimed to be unable to paint faces, arms or legs. He exhibited regularly in Jamaica, Italy and the United States; as of early 2008, his paintings were also on display in what had been his favourite restaurant, San Lorenzo in Beauchamp Place, London. In March 2008, Routh issued limited editions of his original paintings through Chisholm Gallery. Jonathan Routh has been represented by Chisholm Gallery, LLC for over 35 years.

Routh&#x27;s paintings of nuns and Queen Victoria were turned into a number of books:

* &quot;Jamaica Holiday: The secret life of Queen Victoria.&quot; London: Harmony Hall, 1984. Originally featured in The Secret Life of Queen Victoria. Her Majesty&#x27;s Missing Diaries. London: Sidgwick and Jackson Ltd. 1979.
* &quot;The Nuns Go to Africa.&quot; London: Methuen, 1971.
* &quot;The Nuns Go to Penguin Island.&quot; London: Methuen, 1971.
* &quot;The Nuns Go East.&quot; London: Methuen, 1972.
* &quot;The Nuns Go West.&quot; London: Methuen, 1972.

==Other books by Routh==

* &quot;The Little Men in My Life.&quot; London: Barrie, 1953. (Reissued in 1962 as &quot;An Exhibition of Myself&quot;.)
* &quot;Captain d&#x27;Arcy&#x27;s Filthy Picture Book.&quot; London: Wolfe, 1967.
* &quot;Dr. Crocker&#x27;s Exercise Book.&quot; London: Wolfe, 1967.
* &quot;The Hangover Book: Prevention, preparation, treatment and cure.&quot; London: Wolfe, 1967.
* &quot;So You Think You&#x27;ve Got Problems: A book of disasters.&quot; London: Wolfe, 1967.
* &quot;Routh&#x27;s Weekend Guide.&quot; London: Anthony Blond, 1969.
* &quot;Leonardo&#x27;s Kitchen Notebooks&quot; with Shelagh Routh. London: Collins 1987. A humorous book made up from a fictional notes from Leonardo Da Vinci called &quot;Codex Romanoff&quot;. Over time, the information in the book has been taken as fact by people, such as the claim that Da Vinci invented the Napkin.
* &quot;Jonathan Routh&#x27;s Initial Good Loo Guide: Where to &quot;go&quot; in London.&quot; London: Banyan, 1989. . Illustrated by Enzo Apicella, this paperback is considerably larger than the earlier work by Routh and Glashan. The odd title derives from the book&#x27;s sponsorship by Initial Textile Services, a company that serviced loos.

<doc id="1170949" wikidata="Q2483934" url="?curid=1170949" title="Cnidoglanis macrocephalus">
<text>Cnidoglanis macrocephalus is a species of catfish (order Siluriformes) of the family Plotosidae, and is the only species of the genus Cnidoglanis. It is commonly known as the cobbler, estuary cobbler, deteira, estuary catfish, South Australian catfish, or Swan River catfish.

==Distribution==
The cobbler is found from Main Beach, Queensland to Jervis Bay, New South Wales, and Kingston SE, South Australia to Houtman Abrolhos Islands, Western Australia and Duck River, Tasmania, in near-shore and reef habitats.

==Description==
Like other eeltail catfish, the cobbler resembles a catfish in front, but an eel behind. It can grow up to 91.0 centimetres (35.6 in) SL, 2,500 grams (5.5 lb). They may live up to 13 years. The dorsal and pectoral fins have sharp, venomous spines that can inflict painful wounds.

==Treatment==
Treatment of injuries by submersion of the wound in hot water is suggested though the role of heat in denaturation of toxins is debated.

However, despite this study, hot water immersion is still the recommended first aid treatment for envenomation.
==Ecology==
The estuary cobbler is an inshore marine species which lives in shallow bays and sandy inlets near river mouths. It is found most frequently over sand, rocks, and weeds in the clear to turbid waters. By day, the estuary cobbler is most often found in holes and on ledges in banks. Estuary cobblers stay in holes and under ledges during the day, then come out at night to feed. They are opportunistic feeders, primarily feed on molluscs (bivalves and gastropods), crustaceans (prawns and amphipods), polychaete worms, algae, and organic debris. Juveniles eat more crustaceans, often from among drifting macrophytic algae, while adults feed mainly on molluscs and polychaetes. They are prey to birds such as cormorants and pelicans.

<text>Maharashtra State Electricity Board (or MSEB) (Marathi:महाराष्ट्र राज्य विद्युत मंडळ) is a state government electricity regulation board operating within the state of Maharashtra in India. The MSEB was formed on 20 June 1960 under Section 5 of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948. In 1998 it was the second largest electricity generating utility in India after National Thermal Power Corporation.

==History==

The company&#x27;s predecessor was the Bombay Electricity Board which was formed on 6 November 1954 and operated up to 31 March 1957 when it was renamed to Maharashtra State Electricity Board which operated until 19 June 1960.
The result of a collaboration between the MSEB and Enron was the Ratnagiri power plant.

===Restructuring===
In accordance with Electricity Act 2003 of the Government of India, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board was restructured into 4 companies in 2005. These companies were registered with Company Registrar in Mumbai on 31 May 2005 as follows:
*MSEB Holding Company Limited.
*Maharashtra State Power Generation Company Limited, Mahanirmiti or Mahagenco, MSPGCL.
*Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission Company Limited, Mahapareshan or Mahatransco, MSETCL.
*Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited, Mahavitaran or Mahadiscom, MSEDCL.

Mahavitaran−MSEDCL is responsible for distribution of electricity throughout the state by buying power from either Mahanirmiti−MSPGCL power plants, or from other state electricity boards and private sector power generation companies.

The holding company entity, MSEB Holding Company Limited, holds all the stake in the other three companies. All these 3 companies are engineers dominated.

==Capacity and non-renewable resources==
Maharashtra constitutes 13% of the total installed electricity generation capacity in India, which is mainly produced from non-renewable resources, using fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas.

<text>Grammatophyllum, sometimes abbreviated in horticultural trade as Gram, is a genus of 13 currently known orchid species. The name is derived from the Greek words &#x27;gramma&#x27; (a line or streak or mark) and &#x27;phyllon&#x27; (leaf), referring to the parallel leaf veins or the markings of the perianth. This epiphytic genus occurs in dense rainforest from Indo-China, to Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, New Guinea, and the Southwest Pacific islands.

The species produce several racemes, arising from the base of the pseudobulb, with many yellow-green to olive-green, waxy flowers with dark purplish-red marks. The pseudobulbs are enveloped by sheaths.

These are medium-sized to very large orchids, including the giant orchid (&quot;Grammatophyllum speciosum&quot;), believed to be the largest orchid species in existence. Its pseudobulbs can grow to a length of 2.5 m. Plants can develop into gigantic clusters weighing from several hundred kilograms to one ton. The roots form spectacular bundles.

The more modest bell orchid (&quot;Grammatophyllum scriptum&quot;) is another well-known species, with pseudobulbs of 20 cm, from which originate 3 to 4 stout leaves with a length of 1 m.

&quot;Grammatophyllum multiflorum&quot; is one of the longest-blooming orchids in existence: it can be in bloom for nine months. See also &quot;Dendrobium cuthbertsonii&quot;, whose flowers have been reported to last up to ten months each.

&quot;Grammatophyllum&quot; &#x27;Tiger&#x27;s paw&#x27; is a hybrid from &quot;G. elegans&quot; and &quot;G. fenzlianum&quot;.

<doc id="1170973" wikidata="Q953270" url="?curid=1170973" title="Dack Rambo">
<text>Norman Jay &quot;Dack&quot; Rambo (November 13, 1941 – March 21, 1994) was an American actor, widely known for his role as Walter Brennan&#x27;s grandson Jeff in the series &quot;The Guns of Will Sonnett&quot;, as Steve Jacobi in the soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot;, as cousin Jack Ewing on &quot;Dallas&quot;, and as Grant Harrison on the soap opera &quot;Another World&quot;.

==Early life==
Norman Jay Rambo was born on November 13, 1941, in Earlimart, California, to William Lester and Beatrice A. (née Rossi) Rambo. He was a middle child in a family of four children. His siblings were William Donald Rambo; identical twin Orman Ray &quot;Dirk&quot; Rambo (died 1967), and sister Beverly Jean Rambo. Beatrice Rambo outlived two of her three sons.

==Career==
After moving to Los Angeles in the 1960s, the 20-year-old twins were discovered by actress Loretta Young in 1962 and cast in her CBS series &quot;The New Loretta Young Show&quot;. On February 5, 1967, Dirk Rambo was killed in a road accident at the age of 25.

Later that same year, Dack Rambo landed the role of Jeff Sonnett on &quot;The Guns of Will Sonnett&quot; and co-starred in the short-lived &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; spin-off &quot;Dirty Sally&quot;, with Jeanette Nolan. During the 1970s and 1980s, he made guest appearances on &quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.&quot;, &quot;House Calls&quot;, &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;, &quot;The Rookies&quot;, &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;Hotel&quot; and &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;. He played Steve Jacobi on &quot;All My Children&quot; in the early 1980s. He also acted the lead role in &quot;Sword of Justice,&quot; which lasted for 10 installments in 1978–79. Rambo may be best remembered on television for playing Jack Ewing in 51 episodes of the soap opera &quot;Dallas&quot; from 1985 to 1987. Rambo also played Wesley Harper on the 1984 short-lived TV series soap opera &quot;Paper Dolls&quot;.

Rambo promoted a line of men&#x27;s underwear trademarked in 1987 as &quot;Under Ware by dack rambo&quot; [sic]. While working on &quot;Another World&quot;, Rambo learned that he was infected with HIV in August 1991. He quit the series shortly thereafter and retired from acting. Rambo then made his HIV infection and his bisexuality public, revealing that he had been in relationships with both men and women since his 20s.

==Personal life==
For most of his life, Rambo was closeted about his bisexuality. He later said he had been bisexual for most of his life, and had a &quot;spicy&quot; sex life that never included safe sex.

Rambo learned he was HIV-positive on August 30, 1991, while preparing to tape scenes for &quot;Another World&quot;. After finishing work, he told the producers that he had HIV and that he wished to leave the show. He never returned to acting. Rambo issued a press release on October 1, 1991, publicly disclosing his seroconversion status. His announcement came three weeks after actor Brad Davis died of AIDS and a month before basketball star Magic Johnson announced he had HIV.

Rambo came out as bisexual in an interview with &quot;The Washington Post&quot; on November 25, 1991.

The actor admitted in November 1991 that he had an addiction to alcohol and prescription drugs for several years. His time on &quot;Dallas&quot; was not a happy one, and his addiction significantly worsened after he left the show. He entered the Betty Ford Center for treatment in the summer of 1991 and became sober. Rambo denied he had ever been an intravenous drug user.

==Death==
Dack Rambo died on March 21, 1994, at the age of 52 of complications from AIDS.

<doc id="1170978" wikidata="Q7936617" url="?curid=1170978" title="Visual processing">
<text>Visual processing is the brain&#x27;s ability to use and interpret visual information from the world. The process of converting light energy into a meaningful image is a complex process that is facilitated by numerous brain structures and higher level cognitive processes.

On an anatomical level, light energy first enters the eye through the cornea, where the light is bent. After passing through the cornea, light passes through the pupil and then the lens of the eye, where it is bent to a greater degree and focused upon the retina. The retina is where a group of light-sensing cells called photoreceptors are located. There are two types of photoreceptors: rods and cones. Rods are sensitive to dim light, and cones are better able to transduce bright light. Photoreceptors connect to bipolar cells, which induce action potentials in retinal ganglion cells. These retinal ganglion cells form a bundle at the optic disc, which is a part of the optic nerve.

The two optic nerves from each eye meet at the optic chiasm, where nerve fibers from each nasal retina cross. This results in the right half of each eye&#x27;s visual field being represented in the left hemisphere and the left half of each eye&#x27;s visual fields being represented in the right hemisphere. The optic tract then diverges into two visual pathways, the geniculostriate pathway and the tectopulvinar pathway, which send visual information to the visual cortex of the occipital lobe for higher level processing (Whishaw and Kolb, 2015).

==Top-down and bottom-up representations==

The visual system is organized hierarchically, with anatomical areas that have specialized functions in visual processing. Low-level visual processing is concerned with determining different types of contrast among images projected onto the retina whereas high-level visual processing refers to the cognitive processes that integrate information from a variety of sources into the visual information that is represented in one&#x27;s consciousness. Object processing, including tasks such as object recognition and location, is an example of higher-level visual processing. High-level visual processing depends on both top-down and bottom-up processes. Bottom-up processing refers to the visual system&#x27;s ability to use the incoming visual information, flowing in a unidirectional path from the retina to higher cortical areas. Top-down processing refers to the use of prior knowledge and context to process visual information and change the information conveyed by neurons, altering the way they are tuned to a stimulus. All areas of the visual pathway except for the retina are able to be influenced by top-down processing.

There is a traditional view that visual processing follows a feedforward system where there is a one-way process by which light is sent from the retina to higher cortical areas, however, there is increasing evidence that visual pathways operate bidirectionally, with both feedforward and feedback mechanisms in place that transmit information to and from lower and higher cortical areas. Various studies have demonstrated this idea that visual processing relies on both feedforward and feedback systems (Jensen et al., 2015; Layher et al., 2014; Lee, 2002). Various studies that recorded from early visual neurons in macaque monkeys found evidence that early visual neurons are sensitive to features both within their receptive fields and the global context of a scene. Two other monkey studies used electrophysiology to find different frequencies that are associated with feedforward and feedback processing in monkeys (Orban, 2008; Schenden &amp; Ganis, 2005). Studies with monkeys have also shown that neurons in higher level visual areas are selective to certain stimuli. One study that used single unit recordings in macaque monkeys found that neurons in middle temporal visual area, also known as area MT or V5, were highly selective for both direction and speed (Maunsell &amp; Van Essen, 1983).

==Disorders of higher-level visual processing==

There are various disorders that are known the cause deficits in higher-level visual processing, including visual object agnosia, prosopagnosia, topographagnosia, alexia, achromatopsia, akinetopsia, Balint syndrome, and astereopsis. These deficits are caused by damage to brain structure implicated in either the ventral or dorsal visual stream (Barton 2011).

== Processing of face and place stimuli ==
Past models of visual processing have distinguished certain areas of the brain by the specific stimuli that they are most responsive to; for example, the parahippocampal place area (PPA) has been shown to have heightened activation when presented with buildings and place scenes (Epstein &amp; Kanwisher, 1998), whereas the fusiform face area (FFA) responds mostly strongly to faces and face-like stimuli (Kanwisher et al., 1997).

=== Parahippocampal Place Area (PPA) ===
The parahippocampal place area (PPA) is located in the posterior parahippocampal gyrus, which itself is contained in the medial temporal lobe with close proximity to the hippocampus. Its name comes from the increased neural response in the PPA when viewing places, like buildings, houses, and other structures, and when viewing environmental scenes, both indoors and outdoors (Epstein &amp; Kanwisher, 1998). This is not to say that the PPA does not show activation when presented with other visual stimuli – when presented with familiar objects that are neither buildings nor faces, like chairs, there is also some activation within the PPA (Ishai et al., 2000). It does however appear that the PPA is associated with visual processing of buildings and places, as patients who have experienced damage to the parahippocampal area demonstrate topographic disorientation, in other words, unable to navigate familiar and unfamiliar surroundings (Habib &amp; Sirigu, 1987). Outside of visual processing, the parahippocampal gyrus is involved in both spatial memory and spatial navigation (Squire &amp; Zola-Morgan, 1991).

=== Fusiform Face Area (FFA) ===
The fusiform face area is located within the inferior temporal cortex in the fusiform gyrus. Similar to the PPA, the FFA exhibits higher neural activation when visually processing faces more so than places or buildings (Kanwisher et al., 1997). However, the fusiform area also shows activation for other stimuli and can be trained to specialize in the visual processing of objects of expertise. Past studies have investigated the activation of the FFA in people with specialized visual training, like bird watchers or car experts who have adapted a visual skill in identifying traits of birds and cars respectively. It has been shown that these experts have developed FFA activation for their specific visual expertise. Other experiments have studied the ability to develop expertise in the FFA using &#x27;greebles&#x27;, a visual stimulus generated to have a few components that can be combined to make a series of different configurations, much like how a variety of slightly different facial features can be used to construct a unique face. Participants were trained on their ability to distinguish greebles by differing features and had activation in the FFA measured periodically through their learning – the results after training demonstrated that greeble activation in the FFA increased over time whereas FFA responses to faces actually decreased with increased greeble training. These results suggested three major findings in regards to FFA in visual processing: firstly, the FFA does not exclusively process faces; secondly, the FFA demonstrates activation for &#x27;expert&#x27; visual tasks and can be trained over time to adapt to new visual stimuli; lastly, the FFA does not maintain constant levels of activation for all stimuli and instead seems to &#x27;share&#x27; activation in such a way that the most frequently viewed stimuli receives the greatest activation in the FFA as seen in the greebles study (Gauthier et al., 2000).  

===Development of the FFA and PPA in the brain===
Some research suggests that the development of the FFA and the PPA is due to the specialization of certain visual tasks and their relation to other visual processing patterns in the brain. In particular, existing research shows that FFA activation falls within the area of the brain that processes the immediate field of vision, whereas PPA activation is located in areas of the brain that handle peripheral vision and vision just out of the direct field of vision (Levy et al., 2001). This suggests that the FFA and PPA may have developed certain specializations due to the common visual tasks within those fields of view. Because faces are commonly processed in the immediate field of vision, the parts of the brain that process the direct field of vision eventually also specialize in more detailed tasks like face recognition. The same concept applies to place: because buildings and locations are often viewed in their entirety either right outside of the field of vision or in an individual&#x27;s periphery, any building or location visual specialization will be processed within the areas of the brain handling peripheral vision. As such, commonly seen shapes like houses and buildings become specialized in certain regions of the brain, i.e. the PPA.

<text>Castlegar is a community in the West Kootenay region of British Columbia, Canada. In the Selkirk Mountains, at the confluence of the Kootenay and Columbia Rivers, it is a regional trade and transportation centre, with a local economy based on forestry, mining and tourism.

Castlegar is home to Selkirk College, a regional airport, a pulp mill, and several sawmills. Its population of 8,338 includes many Doukhobors, who were largely responsible for much of the town&#x27;s early development and growth.

The area which became Castlegar was an important centre for the Sinixt (Lakes) Peoples. Outside the city limits are the small surrounding communities of Ootischenia, Brilliant, Robson, Robson West, Raspberry, Tarrys, Thrums, Glade, Shoreacres, Fairview, Genelle, Pass Creek and Krestova, and the much smaller communities of Deer Park, Renata, and Syringa on Lower Arrow Lake. These outlying areas have a further population of about 8,000 people.

==History==
On 5 September 1811, David Thompson arrived in the area of present-day Castlegar, and camped near the mouth of the Kootenay River. A plaque dedicated to him is on the east bank of the Columbia River overlooking the town.

The area&#x27;s first settlement was West Waterloo, now known as South Castlegar. With widespread provincial interest in gold prospecting in the late 19th century, by 1895 there were 40 houses in Waterloo. The town boomed until the end of the century when interest in the local mines declined.

Castlegar takes its name from Castlegar Estate, the ancestral home of townsite founder Edward Mahon, near Ahascragh in County Galway, Ireland. Castlegar, BC was planned in 1897. Around 1902, the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) built the bridge there and laid the wide-gauge railway tracks to Trail. They built a boxcar station at the old Waterloo Trail crossing and named it Kinnaird Station in honour of Lord Kinnaird, a CPR shareholder.

There was little in Castlegar until after the completion of the CPR bridge. A Mr. Farmer built the first store, housing both the post office and town hall. William Gage built the Castlegar Hotel in 1908, which stood until 1982 when it was destroyed by fire. Also in 1908, the first schoolhouse was built by a few local residents. A dance pavilion, garage, tourist cabins and a slaughterhouse were established by 1925.

On 30 October 1946, Castlegar was incorporated into a village; and in 1966, became a town. It amalgamated with neighbouring Kinnaird into a city on 1 January 1974, effectively doubling its population. On 20 May 2004, the city&#x27;s boundary was extended to include the Blueberry Creek Irrigation District.

===Indigenous peoples history===

Castlegar is in the border area between the Sinixt (Interior Salish) and Ktunaxa Indian bands. Experts cannot agree where one band&#x27;s range ended and the other&#x27;s began, as there was much overlapping of cultural and territorial activity between them. Most recent information suggests that the Sinixt were the area&#x27;s original people, and that the Kootenai arrived several hundred years ago from central Canada.

&quot;Kp&#x27;itl&#x27;els&quot; was an Indigenous settlement on the north side of the Kootenay River, just above the junction with the Columbia River. Implements such as arrowheads and pestles have been found along the nearby Arrow Lakes. A reconstructed kekuli dwelling was discovered on Zuckerberg Island, at the confluence of the Kootenay and Columbia rivers.

===Doukhobor history===

The Doukhobors operated a ferry near Brilliant on the Kootenay River in 1910, and the Christian Community of Universal Brotherhood (CCUB) applied to CPR for a railway station and siding to that point. Brilliant was the centre of the CCUB commercial enterprises, including the Brilliant Jam Factory, a grain elevator, and a flax mill.

==Demographics==

==Climate==

Castlegar has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;) or an inland oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;), bordering an inland warm-summer mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Csb&quot;). Summers are warm and sunny, with late summer being quite dry, while winters are cool and frequently unsettled. Precipitation peaks in the winter months when the Aleutian Low is strongest, and a range of precipitation is experienced, sometimes in short time periods. Castlegar is wetter than most places in the Southern Interior of BC, and the city receives around 400 mm more precipitation than nearby Kelowna, Penticton and Kamloops (which are in the drier Okanagan region of British Columbia, while Castlegar is in the Kootenay region).

The highest temperature ever recorded in Castlegar is on 30 June 2021, which exceeded the previous mark of , recorded on 2 July 1924 and 11 July 1926. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on 30 December 1968.

==Airport==

The West Kootenay Regional Airport is owned and operated by the City of Castlegar, and provides regular service to Vancouver International Airport. The other nearest airport is Trail Airport, to the south.

==Schools==

Castlegar is part of School District 20 Kootenay-Columbia. There are four elementary schools in the town:
* Castlegar Primary School
* Kinnaird Elementary School
* Robson Community School 
* Twin Rivers Elementary School

There is one high school, Stanley Humphries Secondary School.

Selkirk College&#x27;s main campus is also in Castlegar.

==Recreation==
Dozens of walking trails in and near Castlegar are maintained by the Castlegar Parks and Trails Society. The area attracts retirees and tourists for its summer and winter sports.

The Columbia River flows through Castlegar. Along the river to the west are Scotties Marina and Syringa Provincial Park, with boating and camping amenities.


==Sports==
The city&#x27;s collegiate hockey team is the Selkirk College Saints of the BCIHL, who, as of 2016, are four-time defending league champions.
The Castlegar Rebels of the KIJHL are the city&#x27;s Junior &quot;B&quot; level hockey team.

There are local lacrosse, golf, curling, tennis, volleyball and basketball programs. Many other fitness programs (including yoga) are offered at the Castlegar Community Complex.

==Geography==
Castlegar&#x27;s main business street, Columbia Avenue, runs the length of the city. It becomes Highway 22 at its south end, and the Robson Bridge at its north end. Most of Castlegar&#x27;s local businesses are located there. There are several neighbourhoods in Castlegar, including Downtown, Southridge, Oglow Subdivision, Woodland Park, Grosvenor, Kinnaird, and Blueberry Creek. The city&#x27;s outskirts include the neighbourhoods of Robson, Robson West, Brilliant, Raspberry, Pass Creek, Ootischenia, Tarrys, Thrums and Genelle.

==Transportation==

Castlegar is a transportation hub for its region. In addition to its airport (above), it is at the junction of highways 3A, 3 and 22. Highway 22, known locally as Columbia Avenue, runs the length of the city. At its north end, Columbia meets the Robson Bridge, carrying traffic to the rural suburb of Robson, accessed via Broadwater Road.

There is a small highway interchange where the Robson Access Road meets Highway 3A towards Nelson. Highway 3 bisects Castlegar, providing the main access to the Grovesnor area, and crossing the Columbia River at the Kinnaird Bridge, to Ootischenia. Highway 3 and 3A provide routes through Ootischenia, and Highway 22 also connects to Blueberry. To the north, Highway 3A heads to Nelson. To the south, Highway 22 leads to Trail. To its east, Highway 3 leads to Salmo, and to Grand Forks to its west.

<doc id="1170988" wikidata="Q7627832" url="?curid=1170988" title="Student financial aid in the United States">
<text>Student financial aid in the United States is funding that is available exclusively to students attending a post-secondary educational institution in the United States. This funding is used to assist in covering the many costs incurred in pursuing post-secondary education. Financial aid is available from federal and state governments, educational institutions, and private organizations. It can be awarded through grants, loans, work-study, and scholarships. To apply for federal financial aid, students must first complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).

The financial aid process has been criticized for its part in enrollment management, whereby students are awarded money not based on merit or need, but on the maximum the student families will pay.

==Types of financial aid==
===Grants===
In the United States, grants come from a wide range of government departments, colleges, universities or public and private trusts. Grant eligibility is typically determined by financial need. The application process is set by the agency providing the funds and often relies on data submitted via the FAFSA.

While the terms &quot;grant&quot; and &quot;scholarship&quot; are frequently used interchangeably, there is a difference. Scholarships may have a financial need component but rely on other criteria as well. Some private need-based awards are confusingly called scholarships and require the results of a FAFSA (the family&#x27;s EFC). However, scholarships are often merit-based, while grants tend to be need-based.

Some examples of grants commonly applied for in the U.S.: 
* Federal Pell Grant, the largest of the federal grant options and based exclusively on an individual&#x27;s Expected Family Contribution as calculated using the FAFSA data.
* For students attending a University or Cal State in the state of California there are also resources like the Cal Grant award that is awarded every year. Cal Grants help students choose an institution that best suits them and not based on what they can afford. There are different types of grants that the California Student Aid Commission awards to different students. For example, Cal Grant A provides full mandatory tuition and feeds to students. Funds from Cal Grant B are given to eligible low-income and underprivileged students. For first-year students, an amount of up to $1,648 for books and living expenses were provided in the school year 2023-24. The California Student Aid Commission awards different amounts depending on the student&#x27;s need.
* Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG), a federal grant program that is need-based, but directed towards students whose FAFSA results exhibit exceptional financial need, such as being among the lowest Expected Family Contribution (EFC).
* The Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant requires taking certain classes to get the grant, followed by performing a specific job, sometimes in a specific location, to keep the grant from becoming a loan.
* Institutional Grants, grants provided by educational institutions. Some institutional grants are based on academic achievement (merit awards or merit scholarships), while others are based on financial need, and some are a combination of the two. 
* Private and Employer Grants, grants provided by the private sector, for students who meet specific criteria for eligibility related to the private organization. 
* State Grants, are public funds received from state agencies that are completely separate from those listed in the federal sector. These grants vary by state and are awarded based on financial need.

===Education loans===

An education loan is a loan taken out by the student (or parent) to pay for educational expenses. Unlike scholarships and grants, this money must be repaid with interest. Educational loan options include federal student loans, federal parent loans, private loans, and consolidation loans.

====Federal student loan programs====
Federal student loans are loans directly to the student; the student is responsible for repayment of the loan. These loans typically have low interest rates and do not require a credit check or any other sort of collateral. Student loans provide a wide variety of deferment plans, as well as extended repayment terms, making it easier for students to select payment methods that reflect their financial situation. There are federal loan programs that consider financial need.

===== Direct subsidized loans =====
Direct subsidized loans are the most sought, as they have few requirements other than enrollment and demonstration of financial need. However, the amount that can be borrowed is determined by the school and may not exceed the financial need, which is based on the EFC using information from FAFSA. It is not required to begin repaying these loans while the student are in school at least part-time. They also have a six-month grace period after leaving the school. These loans also offer a deferment period in some cases.

===== Direct unsubsidized loans =====
Direct Unsubsidized Loans are available to all undergraduate and graduate students, with no requirement to demonstrate financial need. The school determines how much can be borrowed based on the cost of attendance and adjust for any other financial aid the student is receiving. However, the interest must be paid on these loans even during school. Interests that are not paid during enrollment accrue and are added to the principal amount of the loan.

===== Parent loans =====
Federal parent loans are a federally funded loan option if the student is dependent on his or her parents. Parent loans allow parents to take out student loans, the repayment of which will be their responsibility. The parents use these loans to pay for educational expenses on behalf of the student. For undergraduate students, there is the parent loan for undergraduate students or PLUS Loan. This loan allows parents to borrow up to the total cost of attendance, minus any other financial aid the student receives. Eligibility will be determined upon review of the parent&#x27;s credit history.

==== Private loans ====
Private student loans are offered by private lenders (financial institutions). These loans typically have much higher interest rates, have fewer repayment/deferment options, cannot be discharged through bankruptcy, and are not supervised by any agency.

==== Consolidation loans ====
Consolidation loans combine two or more student and/or parent loans into one loan. They are an option for those who find themselves struggling with multiple student loan payments. Consolidation loans are available for most federal loan types, and some private lenders offer private consolidation loans for private education loans.

===Work-study===

The Federal Work-Study Program is a form of financial aid. Work-study jobs allow students to get campus jobs, when possible within their field of interest, and are more flexible than off-campus part-time jobs because they are designed to accommodate student schedules. In 2022, Williams College became the first institution of higher education in the United States to eliminate work-study (along with loans) from their financial aid programs by offering an &quot;all grant&quot; financial aid package.

===Scholarships===

While the terms &quot;grant&quot; and &quot;scholarship&quot; are frequently used interchangeably, there is a difference. Scholarships may have a financial need component but rely on other criteria as well. Some private need-based awards are confusingly called scholarships and require the results of a FAFSA (the family&#x27;s EFC). However, scholarships are often merit-based, while grants tend to be need-based.

Scholarships, similar to grants, do not need to be repaid. Scholarships come from state, educational institutions, and private agencies. Scholarships can be awarded based on merit, financial need, student characteristics (such as gender, race, religion, family and medical history, and the like), creativity, career field, college, and athletic ability, among other categories.

There are search engines available to find scholarships such as Peterson&#x27;s, Unigo, Fastweb, Cappex, Chegg, The College Board, and Niche (formerly known as College Prowler).

==Financial aid application process==
===The student&#x27;s financial &quot;need&quot;===
In the college financial aid process in the United States, a student&#x27;s &quot;need&quot; is a figure that colleges use when calculating how much financial aid to offer a student. It is determined by taking the college&#x27;s Cost of Attendance, which current rules require each college to specify. Then it is subtracted the student&#x27;s Expected Family Contribution, based on the student&#x27;s income and assets, and calculated by the U.S. Department of Education under rules set by Congress and processed using the FAFSA system. For unmarried students under 24, Congress mandates that parental income and assets be included. The resulting figure is the student&#x27;s &quot;need&quot;. Colleges attempt to provide students with enough financial aid to meet all student need, but in most cases are unable to do so completely. The result is &quot;unmet need&quot;.

Under federal law, if there are special circumstances such as loss of a job or large medical expenses, college financial aid offices have considerable liberty to lower a student&#x27;s calculated need, thus resulting in a larger aid award.

===Application process for need-based aid===

To qualify for need-based aid a student must have a significant amount of financial need, which is determined by the federal government based on the FAFSA. Using the information submitted on the FAFSA, the U.S. Department of Education calculates a figure called the Expected Family Contribution (EFC). If the EFC is less than the cost of attending a college, the student has a financial need (as the term is used in the U.S. financial aid system).

Students can file an appeal with their college financial aid office to seek additional financial aid, though the information about the process is not always clear or available online. SwiftStudent, a free service, provides template letters for college students.

Some well-to-do colleges have need-based aid of their own to distribute, in addition to federal and state aid (if any). These colleges require, in addition to the FAFSA, the CSS Profile financial form, which goes into greater detail.

===Need-based aid===
Need-based financial aid is awarded based on the financial need of the student. The &quot;need&quot; of each student is a figure determined separately for each student. The Free Application for Federal Student Aid application (FAFSA) is generally used for determining federal, state, and institutional need-based aid eligibility. At private institutions, a supplemental application may be necessary for institutional need-based aid.

A recent trend shows that what is purely need-based aid is not entirely clear. According to the National Postsecondary Aid Survey (NPSAS), SAT scores affect the size of institutional need-based financial aid. If a student has a high SAT score and a low family income, they will receive larger institutional need-based grants than a student with a low family income that has low SAT scores. In 1996, public higher education institutions gave students with high SAT scores and a low family income $1,255 in need-based grants. However, only $565 in need-based grants were given to students with low SAT scores who had low family incomes. The lower a student&#x27;s SAT score, the smaller the amount of need-based grants a student received no matter what their family income level was. The same trend holds true for higher education private institutions. In 1996, private institutions gave students with high SAT scores and a low family income $7,123 versus $2,382 for students with low SAT scores and a low family income. Thus, &quot;institutional need-based awards are less sensitive to need and more sensitive to &#x27;academic merit&#x27; than the principles of needs analysis would lead us to expect.&quot; It has been found that increasing an SAT score in the range of 100-200 points can result in hundreds of dollars more in institutional grants and on average substantially more if one is attending a private institution.

While providing financial information to the government is a reasonable expectation to calculate a student&#x27;s financial need, it does not necessarily follow that colleges should have access to this information. Providing that information to schools may be problematic because schools learn about students&#x27; other sources of funding and may adjust their financial aid packages accordingly. There is an asymmetric information problem since schools have full knowledge of their customers&#x27; ability to pay while students and their families have little information about costs that colleges face to provide their services. That is, when planning for the next academic year, a school will know its current and projected costs as well as each student&#x27;s ability to pay after receiving state and federal grants. According to the Center for College Affordability and Productivity (CCAP), &quot;If the federal or state authorities increase financial support per student, the institution has the opportunity to capture part or all of that increased ability to pay by reducing institutional grants and/or raising their charges for tuition, fees, room, or board.&quot; Importantly, it also notes that &quot;the exception to this general pattern is modest aid targeted at only low-income students, like the Pell grant.&quot; The center uses data about net proceeds (tuition plus room, board and other fees) as a percentage of median income to show that financial aid practices have not been effective in decreasing prices in an effort to increase access. Net proceeds at public four-year institutions rose from 15% to 20% of median income from 1987 to 2008. In that same time, productivity has declined in the form of lighter teaching loads for professors and increased expenditures on administrative staff.

===Non-need-based financial aid===

Non-need-based loans are available for students and families who cannot afford to pay the entire cost of college. These loans are directed toward those individuals and families who did not qualify for need-based loans due to the amount of their personal assets. There is usually a higher interest rate associated with non-need-based loans. Because these loans are not need-based, the U.S. government does not pay the interest for the student while enrolled in school; they are often referred to as unsubsidized loans. The Unsubsidized Stafford Loan and Grad PLUS loans are non-need-based loans available for both undergraduate and graduate students who do not qualify for need-based financial aid.

Even though these loans are not subsidized, interest rates are set by Congress, the programs are closely supervised, and they provide many protections that private loans rarely offer.

Some non-need-based grants and scholarships consider merit rather than financial need. These awards are granted by the college or university as well as outside organizations. Merit-based scholarships are typically awarded for outstanding academic achievements and maximum SAT or ACT scores. However, some scholarships may be awarded due to special talents like athletic scholarships, leadership potential, and other personal characteristics. To be considered for such awards some institutions require an additional application process while others automatically consider all admitted students for their merit-based scholarships.

===Non-need-based aid versus need-based aid===
With the yearly rising cost of tuition, room and board, and fees among schools across the nation, low-income students are finding it harder to pay for their education. In an attempt to help students meet the high, costly demands of college, schools have increased merit-based grants, for students with outstanding academic positions, involvement in organizations, or high athletic talent. The issue is that these reasons for awarding scholarships take away from low-income students who often do not meet these merit standards. In other words, funds for merit-based scholarships are taking away from the already small amount of federal aid available to low-income students who simply cannot pay for college without some kind of financial aid.

In recent years, the government has responded to the financial crisis students are facing and therefore passed legislation that boosted the value of grants for low-income students and trimmed subsidies for private education lenders. Schools have also taken action for the sake of students. Harvard University, a well-known costly but wealthy institution that had previously cut tuition for students whose families earned less than $60,000 a year, proceeded to cut costs by nearly fifty percent for those students whose families earned between $120,000 and $180,000 a year. Institutions will consider students&#x27; financial needs as well as their academic merit standing when applying for financial aid. Merit-based aid and need-based aid have been linked together for many financial aid scholarships. This relationship is beneficial as it underlies that one form of financial aid, particularly merit-based, is not completely taking over need-based aid. Statistics do show results of studies performed from 1992–2000 that the increase in financial aid awarded was based entirely on merit. However, when viewing numbers of both merit-based and need-based aid closely, the differences are not significant.

==Graduate and professional students==
The following types of federal financial aid are available to graduate and professional students. Aid for these students is primarily loans.
* The William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan (Direct Loan) Program: Eligible students may borrow up to $20,500 per school year. These loans are unsubsidized; Congress has determined that subsidized loans (no interest while enrolled) are only available to undergraduates. Graduate and professional students enrolled in certain health profession programs may receive additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan amounts each academic year. These federal loans, although unsubsidized, are far superior in interest rate and repayment terms to private student loans.
* Federal Perkins Loan (Perkins Loan) Program: This is a school-based loan program for eligible students with exceptional financial need. Students may qualify for a Perkins Loan of up to $8,000 each year depending on financial need, the amount of other aid received, and the availability of funds at the school. Each college has a set amount of Perkins Loans for its students; there has been controversy over the formula that is used to apportion the loans to colleges.
* Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant: The TEACH Grant Program provides grants of up to $4,000 a year to students who are completing or plan to complete coursework needed to begin a career in teaching. The TEACH Grant is different from other federal student grants in that it requires students to take certain kinds of classes to get the grant, and then to do a certain kind of job to keep the grant from turning into a loan.
* Federal Work-Study (FWS) Program: The Work-Study Program provides part-time jobs for undergraduate and graduate students with financial need. This program allows students to earn money to help pay education expenses. The program encourages community service work and work related to a student&#x27;s course of study.
* Federal Pell Grant: A Pell Grant, unlike a loan, does not have to be repaid. Most graduate and professional students are not eligible for Pell Grants, but those enrolled in a post-baccalaureate teacher certification program are eligible.

Graduate students may also be eligible for these financial aid programs:
* Aid from other federal agencies (i.e., research grants or fellowships)
* State aid (i.e., state loans) 
* Institutional aid (i.e., institutional scholarships or graduate assistantships/fellowships)
* Non-institutional scholarships

==International students==

There is little financial aid available for foreign students, with the unique exception of Canadian and Mexican students. A majority of aid is awarded as grants, scholarships, and loans that come through public and private sources which restrict their awards to American citizens. That being said there is financial aid still available for international students.

Some colleges and universities offer aid to international students. To find out if the school in question offers such assistance inquire of the financial aid office of the institution. Some schools offer grants, loans, and jobs, and give anywhere from 15 to 150 awards to foreign students. For example, schools such as Harvard, Princeton, University of Pennsylvania, University of Miami, Ithaca College, Cornell University, Johns Hopkins, University of Chicago, University of Oregon, and Williams College all offer packages to foreign students. Graduate students may have more luck with financial aid. This is because graduate and teaching assistantships are offered based on academic achievement, regardless of citizenship. Although International students are not eligible for the US government aid programs like the Pell Grant, SEOG Grant, Stafford Loan, Perkins Loan, PLUS Loan, and Federal Work study, many schools will ask international students to submit a FAFSA so that they may use the data for assessing financial need.

There is also assistance a student can seek from their native country. Canadian students attending colleges in the US may obtain loans through the Canadian government&#x27;s Ministry of Skills, Training, and Labour. Alternative loans Canadian international students may apply for are the Canadian Higher Education Loan Program, Global Student Loan Corporation (GLSC), and International Student Loan Program (ISLP). Financial Aid for European Students can be looked by using Noopolis, a database in Italy run by CNR (the Italian equivalent of the US&#x27;s National Science Foundation). It has information regarding financial aid for Italian citizens to study abroad. There are also U.S. Educational Advising Centers throughout the world that assist prospective students by answering the questions they have about studying in the United States.

One more option for students is to seek financial support from private foundations such as Ford Foundation, and non-profit organizations such as American Association of University Women (AAUW) and Margaret McNamara Education Grants (MMEG). Each organization has its own application process and eligibility criteria detailed on respective websites.

== College cost calculators ==

Post-secondary institutions post a Cost of Attendance or Price of Attendance, also known as a &quot;sticker price.&quot; However, that price is not how much an institution will cost an individual student. To make higher education costs more transparent before a student actually applies to college, federal law requires all post-secondary institutions receiving Title IV funds (federal funds for student aid) to post net price calculators on their websites by October 29, 2011.

As defined in The Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008, the net price calculator&#x27;s purpose is: 
&quot;…to help current and prospective students, families, and other consumers estimate the individual net price of an institution of higher education for a student. The net price calculator shall be developed in a manner that enables current and prospective students, families, and consumers to determine an estimate of a current or prospective student&#x27;s net price at a particular institution.&quot;

The law defines estimated net price as the difference between an institution&#x27;s average total Price of Attendance (the sum of tuition and fees, room and board, books and supplies, and other expenses including personal expenses and transportation for first-time, full-time undergraduate students who receive aid) and the institution&#x27;s median need- and merit-based grant aid awarded.
Elise Miller, program director for the U.S. Department of Education&#x27;s Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) stated the idea behind the requirement: &quot;We just want to break down the myth of sticker price and get beyond it. This is to give students some indication that they will not necessarily be paying that full price.&quot;

The template was developed based on the suggestions of an IPEDS&#x27; Technical Review Panel (TRP), which met on January 27–28, 2009, and included 58 individuals representing federal and state governments, post-secondary institutions from all sectors, association representatives, and template contractors. Mary Sapp, Ph.D., assistant vice president for planning and institutional research at the University of Miami, served as the panel&#x27;s chair. She described the mandate&#x27;s goal as &quot;to provide prospective and current undergraduate students with some insight into the difference between an institution&#x27;s sticker price and the price they will end up paying.&quot;
To meet the requirement, post-secondary institutions may choose between a basic template developed by the U.S. Department of Education or an alternative net price calculator that offers at least the minimum elements the law requires. A report issued by The Institute for College Access and Success, &quot;&quot;Adding it all up 2012: are net price calculators easy to find, use and compare?&quot; found key issues with the implementation of the net price calculator requirement. In &quot;Adding it all up,&quot; the authors state, &quot;this report takes a more in-depth look at the net price calculators from 50 randomly selected colleges. While we found some positive practices that were not evident at the time of our previous report, net price calculators are still not reliably easy for prospective college students and their families to find, use, and compare.&quot;

After the requirement came into effect, Abigail Seldin and Whitney Haring-Smith launched the free website College Abacus, which hosted a system that would allow students to enter their personal information once, and then use and compare net prices of multiple schools. The Gates Foundation&#x27;s College Knowledge Challenge announced College Abacus as one its winners in January 2013; the $100,000 grant from the Gates Foundation enabled College Abacus to expand from its beta version with 2500+ schools to a fully comprehensive version with all the colleges and universities in the United States.

==Debt vs. grants==

===No-loan financial aid===
In 2001, Princeton University became the first university in the United States to eliminate loans from its financial aid packages. Since then, many other schools have followed in eliminating some or all loans from their financial aid programs. In 2022, Williams College became the first institution of higher education in the United States to eliminate both loans and work-study contributions from their financial aid programs. Many of these programs are aimed at students whose parents earn less than a certain income — the figures vary by college or university. These new initiatives were designed to attract more students and applicants from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, reduce student debt loads, and provide the offering institutions with an advantage over their rivals in attracting commitments from accepted students. Most students prefer no-loan financial aid as a way to relieve the amount of debt they are in after college

The following colleges and universities offer such no-loan financial aid packages as of March 2008:

===Loan cap ===
Some universities have opted to have a &quot;loan cap&quot; program, which is a maximum loan — either per year or for four years combined — designed to reduce the cost of attendance for low-income and middle-class students. The following schools have a loan cap program:
==Effect of financial aid on enrollment, persistence, and degree attainment==

Studies examining the effects of financial aid on postsecondary outcomes have generally found positive effects. For instance, a study reviewing the literature on the effects of grant aid on enrollment finds that grant aid positively increases college enrollment, with approximately a 3 to 4 percentage points increase in the likelihood of enrollment for a $1,000 reduction in costs. Similarly, a systematic review and meta-analysis by Tuan Nguyen and colleagues examining the effects of grant aid find that, across more than 40 studies, grant aid increases the probability of students persisting from year to year and of completing their degree by 2 to 3 percentage points, and an additional $1,000 of grant aid improves year-to-year persistence and degree attainment by 1.5 to 2 percentage points. This comprehensive study also finds that grant aid programs with additional non-monetary supports such as academic support and advising have larger effects, and that grant aid effects are weaker for merit-based aid than for need-based aid.

In a study on the correlation between the price of higher education and enrollment rates, Donald Heller finds that the amount of financial aid available for students is a strong factor in enrollment rates.

Different factors have different effects on financial aid:

* Decreases in the amount of financial aid lead to decreases in enrollment. However, different types of financial aid have differing effects. Grant awards tend to have a stronger effect on enrollment rates.
* Changes in tuition and financial aid affect poorer students more than they affect students with higher incomes.
* In terms of race, changes in financial aid affect black students more than it affects white students.
* Changes in financial aid affect students from community colleges more than students from four-year schools.

===Need-blind admissions===
Need-blind admissions do not consider a student&#x27;s financial need. In a time when colleges are low on financial funds, it is difficult to maintain need-blind admissions because schools cannot meet the full needs of the poor students that they admit.

There are different levels of need-blind admissions. Few institutions are fully need-blind. Others are not need-blind for students who apply after certain deadlines, international students, and students from a waitlist. Some institutions are moving away from need-blind admissions so that they can fulfill the full needs of the students that are admitted. Meeting the full need will probably increase the funds for financial aid. For example, Wesleyan University is only need-blind if it has enough money to satisfy the full needs of admitted students.

<doc id="1170995" wikidata="Q1054271" url="?curid=1170995" title="Steam car">
<text>A steam car is a car (automobile) propelled by a steam engine. A steam engine is an external combustion engine (ECE), whereas the gasoline and diesel engines that eventually became standard are internal combustion engines (ICE). ECEs have a lower thermal efficiency, but carbon monoxide production is more readily regulated.

The first experimental steam-powered cars were built in the 18th and 19th centuries, but it was not until after Richard Trevithick had developed the use of high-pressure steam around 1800 that mobile steam engines became a practical proposition. By the 1850s there was a flurry of new steam car manufacturers.

Development was hampered by adverse legislation (the UK Locomotive Acts from the 1860s as well as the rapid development of internal combustion engine technology in the 1900s) leading to the commercial demise of steam-powered vehicles. Relatively few remained in use after the Second World War. Many of these vehicles were acquired by enthusiasts for preservation.

The search for renewable energy sources has led to an occasional resurgence of interest in using steam technology to power road vehicles.

==Technology==

While gasoline-powered ICE cars have an operational thermal efficiency of 15% to 30%, early automotive steam units were capable of only about half this efficiency. A significant benefit of the ECE is that the fuel burner can be configured for very low emissions of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and unburned carbon in the exhaust, thus avoiding pollution.

The greatest technical challenges to the steam car have focused on its boiler. This represents much of the total mass of the vehicle, making the car heavy (an internal combustion-engined car requires no boiler), and requires careful attention from the driver, although even the cars of 1900 had considerable automation to manage this. The single largest restriction is the need to supply feedwater to the boiler. This must either be carried and frequently replenished, or the car must also be fitted with a condenser, a further weight and inconvenience.

Steam-powered and electric cars outsold gasoline-powered cars in the United States prior to the invention of the electric starter, since internal combustion cars relied on a hand crank to start the engine, which was difficult and occasionally dangerous to use, as improper cranking could cause a backfire capable of breaking the arm of the operator. Electric cars were popular to some extent, but had a short range, and could not be charged on the road if the batteries ran low.

Once working pressure was attained, early steam cars could be instantly driven off with high acceleration, but they typically take several minutes to start from cold, plus time to get the burner to operating temperature. To overcome this, development has been directed toward flash boilers, which heat a much smaller quantity of water to get the vehicle started, and in the case of Doble cars, spark ignition kerosene burners.

The steam car does have advantages over internal combustion-powered cars, although most of these are now less important than in the early 20th century. The engine (excluding the boiler) is smaller and lighter than an internal combustion engine. It is also better-suited to the speed and torque characteristics of the axle, thus avoiding the need for the heavy and complex transmission required for an internal combustion engine. The steam car is also quieter, even without a silencer.

== History ==

=== Early history ===


The first steam-powered vehicle was supposedly built in 1679 by Ferdinand Verbiest, a Flemish Jesuit in China. The vehicle was a toy for the Chinese Emperor. While not intended to carry passengers and therefore not exactly a car but a carriage, Verbiest&#x27;s device is likely to be the first ever engine powered vehicle. Also it seems that the Belgian vehicle served as an inspiration for the Italian Grimaldi (early 1700) and the French Nolet (1748) steam carriage successor. A French inventor, Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot, built the first working self-propelled land based mechanical vehicle in two versions, one in 1769 and one in 1771 for use by the French Army. William Murdoch built and operated a steam carriage in model form in 1784. In 1791 he built a larger steam carriage which he had to abandon to do other work. Also William Symington built a steam carriage in 1786. There is an unsubstantiated story that a pair of Yorkshiremen, engineer Robert Fourness and his cousin, physician James Ashworth had a steam car running in 1788, after being granted a British patent No.1674 of December 1788. An illustration of it even appeared in Hergé&#x27;s book (Casterman, 1953). The &quot;London Steam Carriage&quot; was built by Richard Trevithick in 1803 and ran successfully in London, but the venture failed to attract interest and soon folded up. An amphibious steam car was built by Oliver Evans in 1805. The first substantiated steam car for personal use was that of Josef Božek in 1815. He was followed by Julius Griffith in 1821, Timothy Burstall and John Hill in 1824 and Thomas Blanchard in 1825. Over thirty years passed before there was a flurry of steam cars from 1850s onwards with Dudgeon, Roper and Spencer from the United States, Leonard and Taylor from Canada, Rickett, Austin, Catley and Ayres from England, Bordino and Manzetti from Italy, others followed with Bollée and Lejeune from France, Thury from Switzerland and Kemna from Germany.

This early period also saw the first repossession of an automobile in 1867 and the first getaway car the same year, both by Francis Curtis of Newburyport, Massachusetts.

The 1880s saw the rise of the first larger scale manufacturers, particularly in France, the first being Bollée (1878) followed by De Dion-Bouton (1883), Whitney (1885), Olds (1886), Serpollet (1887) and Peugeot (1889).

===1890s Commercial Manufacture===
The 1890s were dominated by the formation of numerous car manufacturing companies. The internal combustion engine was in its infancy, whereas steam power was well established. Electric powered cars were becoming available but suffered from their inability to travel longer distances.

The majority of steam-powered car manufacturers from this period were from the United States. The more notable of these were Clark from 1895 to 1909, Locomobile from 1899 to 1903 when it switched to gasoline engines, and Stanley from 1897 to 1924. As well as England and France, other countries also made attempts to manufacture steam cars: Cederholm of Sweden (1892), Malevez of Belgium (1898–1905), Schöche of Germany (1895), and Herbert Thomson of Australia (1896–1901).

Of all the new manufacturers from the 1890s, only four continued to make steam cars after 1910. They were Stanley (to 1924) and Waverley (to 1916) of the United States, Buard of France (to 1914), and Miesse of Belgium (to 1926).

===Volume Production 1900 to 1913===
There were a large number of new companies formed in the period from 1898 to 1905. Steam cars outnumbered other forms of propulsion among very early cars. In the U.S. in 1902, 485 of 909 new car registrations were steamers. From 1899, Mobile had ten branches and 58 dealers across the U.S. The center of U.S. steamer production was New England, where 38 of the 84 manufacturers were located. Examples include White (Cleveland), Eclipse (Easton, Massachusetts), Cotta (Lanark, Illinois), Crouch (New Brighton, Pennsylvania), Hood (Danvers, Massachusetts, lasted just one month), Kidder (New Haven, Connecticut), Century (Syracuse, New York) and Skene (Lewiston, Maine, the company built everything but the tires). By 1903, 43 of them were gone and by the end of 1910 of those companies that were started in the decade those left were White which lasted to 1911, Conrad which lasted to 1924, Turner-Miesse of England which lasted to 1913, Morriss to 1912, Doble to 1930, Rutherford to 1912, and Pearson-Cox to 1916.

Assembly line mass production by Henry Ford dramatically reduced the cost of owning a conventional automobile, was also a strong factor in the steam car&#x27;s demise as the Model T was both cheap and reliable. Additionally, during the &#x27;heyday&#x27; of steam cars, the internal combustion engine made steady gains in efficiency, matching and then surpassing the efficiency of a steam engine when the weight of a boiler is factored in.

===Decline 1914 to 1939===
With the introduction of the electric starter, the internal combustion engine became more popular than steam, but the internal combustion engine was not necessarily superior in performance, range, fuel economy and emissions. Some steam enthusiasts feel steam has not received its share of attention in the field of automobile efficiency.

Apart from Brooks of Canada, all the steam car manufacturers that commenced between 1916 and 1926 were in the United States. Endurance (1924–1925) was the last steam car manufacturer to commence operations. American/Derr continued retrofitting production cars of various makes with steam engines, and Doble was the last steam car manufacturer. It ceased business in 1930.

===Air Pollution, Fuel Crises, Resurgence and Enthusiasts===
From the 1940s onward, various steam cars were constructed, usually by enthusiasts. Among those mentioned were Charles Keen, Cal Williams&#x27; 1950 Ford Conversion, Forrest R Detrick&#x27;s 1957 Detrick S-101 prototype, and Harry Peterson&#x27;s Stanley powered Peterson. The Detrick was constructed by Detrick, William H Mehrling, and Lee Gaeke who designed the engine based on a Stanley.

Charles Keen began constructing a steam car in 1940 with the intention of restarting steam car manufacturing. Keen&#x27;s family had a long history of involvement with steam propulsion going back to his great-great-grandfather in the 1830s, who helped build early steam locomotives. His first car, a Plymouth Coupe, used a Stanley engine. In 1948 and 1949, Keen employed Abner Doble to create a more powerful steam engine, a V4. He used this in La Dawri Victress S4 bodied sports car. Both these cars are still in existence. Keen died in 1969 before completing a further car. His papers and patterns were destroyed at that time.

In the 1950s, the only manufacturer to investigate steam cars was Paxton. Abner Doble developed the Doble Ultimax engine for the Paxton Phoenix steam car, built by the Paxton Engineering Division of McCulloch Motors Corporation, Los Angeles. The engine&#x27;s sustained maximum power was . A Ford Coupe was used as a test-bed for the engine. The project was eventually dropped in 1954.

In 1957, Williams Engine Company Incorporated of Ambler began offering steam engine conversions for existing production cars. When air pollution became a significant issue for California in the mid-1960s the state encouraged investigation into the use of steam-powered cars. The fuel crises of the early 1970s prompted further work. None of this resulted in renewed steam car manufacturing.

Steam cars remain the domain of enthusiasts, occasional experimentation by manufacturers, and those wishing to establish steam-powered land speed records.

====Impact of Californian legislation====
In 1967, California established the California Air Resources Board and began to implement legislation to dramatically reduce exhaust emissions. This prompted renewed interest in alternative fuels for motor vehicles and a resurgence of interest in steam-powered cars in the state.

The idea for having patrol cars fitted with steam engines stemmed from an informal meeting in March 1968 of members of the California Assembly Transportation Committee. In the discussion, Karsten Vieg, a lawyer attached to the committee, suggested that six cars be fitted with steam engines for testing by California District Police Chiefs. A bill was passed by the legislature to fund the trial.

In 1969, the California Highway Patrol initiated the project under Inspector David S. Luethje to investigate the feasibility of using steam engined cars. Initially General Motors had agreed to pay a selected vendor $20,000 ($ in dollars) toward the cost of developing a Rankine cycle engine, and up to $100,000 ($ in dollars) for outfitting six Oldsmobile Delmont 88s as operational patrol vehicles. This deal fell through because the engine manufacturers rejected GM&#x27;s offer.

The plan was revised and two 1969 Dodge Polaras were to be retrofitted with steam engines for testing. One car was to be modified by Don Johnson of Thermodynamic Systems Inc. and the other by industrialist William P. Lear&#x27;s Lear Motors Incorporated. At the time, the California State Legislature was introducing strict pollution control regulations for automobiles and the Chair of the Assembly Transportation Committee, John Francis Foran, was supportive of the idea. The committee also was proposing to test four steam-powered buses in the San Francisco Bay Area that year.

Instead of a Polara, Thermodynamic Systems (later called General Steam Corp), was given a late-model Oldsmobile Delmont 88. Lear was given a Polara but it does not appear to have been built. Both firms were given 6 months to complete their projects with Lear&#x27;s being due for completion on August 1, 1969. Neither car had been completed by the due date and in November 1969, Lear was reported as saying the car would be ready in 3 months. Lear&#x27;s only known retrofit was a Chevrolet Monte Carlo unrelated to the project. As for the project, it seems to have never been completed, with Lear pulling out by December.

In 1969, the National Air Pollution Control Administration announced a competition for a contract to design a practical passenger-car steam engine. Five firms entered. They were the consortium of Planning Research Corporation and STP Corporation, Battelle Memorial Institute, Columbus, Ohio, Continental Motors Corporation, Detroit, Vought Aeronautical Division of Ling-Temco-Vought, Dallas and Thermo Electron Corporation, Waltham, Massachusetts.

General Motors introduced two experimental steam-powered cars in 1969. One was the SE 124 based on a converted Chevrolet Chevelle and the other was designated SE 101 based on the Pontiac Grand Prix. The SE 124 had its standard gasoline engine replaced with a 50 hp Besler steam engine V4, using the 1920 Doble patents, the SE 101 was fitted with a 160 hp steam engine developed by GM Engineering. Power was transferred via a Toric automatic gearbox. The results was disappointing. The steam engine was heavy and weighted 300 kg more than a standard V8 and gave about half the power.

In October 1969, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the California Institute of Technology put out a challenge for a race August 1970 from Cambridge, Massachusetts to Pasadena, California for any college that wanted to participate in. The race was open for electric, steam, turbine power, and internal combustion engines: liquid-fueled, gaseous-fueled engines, and hybrids. Two steam-powered cars entered the race. University of California, San Diego&#x27;s modified AMC Javelin and Worcester Polytechnic Institute&#x27;s converted 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle called the &quot;tea kettle&quot;. Both dropped out on the second day of the race.

The California Assembly passed legislation in 1972 to contract two companies to develop steam-powered cars. They were Aerojet Liquid Rocket Company of Sacramento and Steam Power Systems of San Diego. Aerojet installed a steam turbine into a Chevrolet Vega, while Steam Power Systems built the Dutcher, a car named after the company&#x27;s founder, Cornelius Dutcher. Both cars were tested by 1974 but neither car went into production. The Dutcher is on display at the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles.

====Indy Cars====
Both Johnson and Lear had contemplated constructing steam-powered cars for the Indianapolis 500, Johnson first in the early 1960s when with Controlled Steam Dynamics and in 1968 with Thermodynamic Systems and Lear in 1969. A third steam racing car was contemplated by a consortium of Planning Research Corporation and Andy Granatelli of STP Corporation. Lear proceeded with the idea and constructed a car, but ran out of funds while trying to develop the engine. The car is thought to be at the National Automobile and Truck Museum of the United States in Auburn, Indiana. Johnson was also noted as working on a steam-powered helicopter.

William D Thompson, 69-year-old retired San Diego automotive engineer, also announced he planned to enter a steam-powered race car. Thompson was working on a $35,000 ($ in dollars) steam-powered luxury car and he intended to use the car&#x27;s engine in the race car. He had claimed that he had almost 250 orders for his cars. By comparison, Rolls-Royces cost about $17,000 ($ in dollars) at that time.

====Donald Healey Steam Car====
With Lear pulling out of attempting to make a steam car, Donald Healey decided to make a basic steam car technology more in line with Stanley or Doble and aimed at enthusiasts. He planned to have the car in production by 1971.

====Ted Pritchard&#x27;s Falcon Steam Car====
Edward Pritchard created a steam-powered 1963 model Ford Falcon in 1972. It was evaluated by the Australian Federal Government and was also taken to the United States for promotional purposes.

====Saab Steam Car and Ranotor====
As a result of the 1973 oil crisis, SAAB started a project in 1974 codenamed ULF (short for utan luftföroreningar, Swedish for Without Air Pollution) headed by Dr. Ove Platell which made a prototype steam-powered car. The engine used an electronically controlled 28-pound multi-parallel-circuit steam generator with 1-millimeter-bore tubing and firing rate which was intended to produce of continuous power, and was about the same size as a standard car battery. Lengthy start-up times were avoided by using air compressed and stored when the car was running to power the car upon starting until adequate steam pressure was built up. The engine used a conical rotary valve made from pure boron nitride. To conserve water, a hermetically sealed water system was used.

The project was cancelled and the project engineer, Ove Platell, started a company named Ranotor, with his son Peter Platell to continue its development. Ranotor is developing a steam hybrid that uses the exhaust heat from an ordinary petrol engine to power a small steam engine, with the aim of reducing fuel consumption by 20%. In 2008, truck manufacturers Scania and Volvo were said to be interested in the project.

====Pelland Steamer====
In 1974, the British designer Peter Pellandine produced the first Pelland Steamer for a contract with the South Australian Government. It had a fibreglass monocoque chassis (based on the internal combustion-engined Pelland Sports) and used a parallel twin cylinder double acting compound engine. It has been preserved at the National Motor Museum at Birdwood, South Australia.

In 1979, the Pelland Mk II Steam Car was built, this time by Pelland Engineering in the UK. It had a three-cylinder double-acting engine in a &#x27;broad-arrow&#x27; configuration, mounted in a tubular steel chassis with a Kevlar body, giving a gross weight of just . Uncomplicated and robust, the steam engine was claimed to give trouble-free, efficient performance. It had huge torque () at zero engine revs, and could accelerate from in under 8 seconds.

Pellandine made several attempts to break the land speed record for steam power, but was thwarted by technical issues. Pellandine moved back to Australia in early 1991 where he continued to develop the Steamer in Tasmania. The latest version is the Mark IV.

====Enginion Steamcell====
From 1996, a R&amp;D subsidiary of the Volkswagen group called Enginion AG was developing a system called ZEE (Zero Emissions Engine). It produced steam almost instantly without an open flame, and took 30 seconds to reach maximum power from a cold start. Their third prototype, EZEE03, was a three-cylinder unit meant to fit in a Škoda Fabia automobile. The EZEE03 was described as having a &quot;two-stroke&quot; (i.e. single-acting) engine of displacement, producing up to (). Exhaust emissions were said to be far below the SULEV standard. It had an oilless engine with ceramic cylinder linings using steam instead of oil as a lubricant. However, Enginion found that the market was not ready for steam cars, so they opted instead to develop the Steamcell power generator/heating system based on similar technology.

== Notable manufacturers ==
=== Cederholm steam car ===
In 1892, painter Jöns Cederholm and his brother, André, a blacksmith, designed their first steam car, a two-seater, introducing a condenser in 1894. They planned to use it for transportation between their home in Ystad and their summer house outside town. Unfortunately the automobile was destroyed in Sweden&#x27;s first automobile accident but the Cederholm brothers soon built a second, improved version of their steam car reusing many parts from the first one. The car is preserved in a museum in Skurup.

=== Locomobile Runabout ===

What is considered by many to be the first marketable popular steam car appeared in 1899 from the Locomobile Company of America, located in Watertown, Massachusetts, and from 1900 in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Locomobile manufactured several thousand of its &quot;Runabout&quot; model in the period 1899–1903, designed around a motor design leased from the Stanley Steamer Company. The company ceased producing steam cars in 1903 and changed to limited-production, internal combustion powered luxury automobiles. In 1922, it was acquired by Durant Motors and discontinued with the failure of the parent company in 1929.

=== Stanley Steamer ===

Perhaps the best selling and best known steam car was the Stanley Steamer, produced from 1896 to 1924. Between 1899 and 1905, Stanley outsold all gasoline-powered cars and was second only to the electric cars of the Columbia Automobile Company in the U.S. It used a compact fire-tube boiler to power a simple double acting two cylinder engine. Because of the phenomenal torque available at all engine speeds, the steam car&#x27;s engine was typically geared directly to the rear axle, with no clutch or variable speed transmission required. Until 1914, Stanley steam cars vented their exhaust steam directly to the atmosphere, necessitating frequent refilling of the water tank; after 1914, all Stanleys were fitted with a condenser, which considerably reduced their water consumption.

In 1906, the Land Speed Record was broken by a Stanley steam car, piloted by Fred Marriott, which achieved at Ormond Beach, Florida. This annual week-long &quot;Speed Week&quot; is still run, headed by the Daytona 500 stock car race This record was not exceeded by any car until 1910.

=== Doble Steam car ===

Attempts were made to bring more advanced steam cars on the market, the most remarkable being the Doble Steam Car which shortened start-up time very noticeably by incorporating a highly efficient monotube steam generator to heat a much smaller quantity of water along with effective automation of burner and water feed control. By 1923, Doble&#x27;s steam cars could be started from cold with the turn of a key and driven off in 40 seconds or less. When the boiler had achieved maximum working pressure, the burner would cut out until pressure had fallen to a minimum level, whereupon it would reignite; by this means the car could achieve around 15 miles per gallon (18.8 liters/100 km) of kerosene despite its weight in excess of . Ultimately, despite their undoubted qualities, Doble cars failed due to poor company organization and high initial cost.

=== Toledo steam car ===
In 1900, the American Bicycle Co. of Toledo, Ohio, created a 6.25 hp Toledo steam carriage (a description from the &quot;Horseless age&quot;, December 1900). The American Bicycle Co was one of the enterprises within Col. Albert Pope&#x27;s large conglomerate of bicycle and motor vehicles manufacturers. The Toledo Steam carriage was a very well-made, high-quality machine where every component, bar the tires, bell, instruments and lights were made within the dedicated 245,000 sq ft factory in Toledo, Ohio. The Toledo is considered to be one of the best steam cars produced at the time. The engine was particularly robust and the 2, 3&quot; diameter x 4&quot; stroke pistons employed piston style valves instead of &#x27;D&#x27; valves thus insuring better balance and reduced leakage of steam. In September 1901 two Toledo steamers, one model B (a model A machine but with the foul-weather gear designating it as a model B) and one class E (public delivery vehicle), were entered by the American Bicycle Co. into the &quot;New York to Buffalo Endurance Contest&quot; of mid-September 1901. There were 36 cars in class B and three in class E, the class B Toledo won the Grosse Point race. On 4 January 1902, a specially built Toledo steam carriage was the first automobile to forge a trail from Flagstaff, Arizona to the South Rim of The Grand Canyon, a distance of 67 miles. As a publicity exercise the trip was to assess the potential of starting a steam bus service but the anticipated afternoon journey took three days due to problems with supplies of the wrong fuel. Though the Toledo towed a trailer filled with additional fuel and water supplies, the four participants omitted to take any food, one, the journalist Winfield Hoggaboon, wrote up an amusing article in the &quot;Los Angeles Herald&quot; two weeks later. In December 1901, the company changed from the American Bicycle Company to the newly formed International Motor Car Company to concentrate on steam- and gasoline-driven models, with electric vehicles being made by the separate Waverly Electric Co. Both steam and gasoline models were manufactured, but, as the public favored the gasoline models and steam carriage sales were slow, steam carriage production ceased in July 1902 and gasoline-driven models were then made under the name Pope-Toledo. Total production of the steamers was between 285 and 325 units, as confirmed by a letter from the International Motor Car Co bookkeeper to the firms&#x27; accountant in June 1902.

=== White Steamer ===

The White Steamer was manufactured in Cleveland, Ohio, from 1900 until 1910 by the White Motor Company.

=== Endurance Steam car ===
The Endurance Steam car was a steam car manufactured in the United States from 1922 until 1924. The company had its origins in the Coats Steam Car and began production on the East Coast before shifting operations to Los Angeles in 1924. There, one single touring car was made using a 1923 Elcar 6-60 body before the factory moved again, this time to Dayton, Ohio, where one more car was built, a sedan, before the company folded.

== Land speed record attempts ==

=== Stanley Run Surpasses Serpollet ===

=== Autocoast Vaporizer ===
In the fall of 1968, Ernest Kanzler, the owner of Autocoast, approached Ross(Skip) Hedrich with an ambitious project: to install a steam engine in Hedrich&#x27;s 1964 Indy car in hopes of breaking the steam car speed record set in 1906. Hedrich took the lead on the project, while Richard J. Smith provided expertise on the engine and steam generator system for Autocoast.

The team aimed to debut the car at the 1969 Bonneville Speed Week. However, the vehicle ended up being too heavy and wide for the steam engine&#x27;s capabilities. As fate would have it, an unexpected rainstorm rendered the salt flats too soggy for racing, providing an unintentional but convenient excuse for the delay.

=== Barber-Nichols Engineering ===
In 1985, Barber-Nicholas Engineering from Denver set out to break the steam-powered land speed record using a steam turbine they had developed for Lear and the Los Angeles city bus program. Over several years at Bonneville Speed Week, they managed to achieve a measured speed of 145.607 mph during one run on the Bonneville Salt Flats . Unfortunately, a fire prevented them from making the required return run. As a result, the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA) did not recognize the speed, as FIA regulations require an average of two runs in opposite directions within an hour of each other, a standard that differs from the original record set by Stanley.

=== British Steam Car Challenge ===
On August 25, 2009, Team Inspiration of the British Steam Car Challenge set a new record for steam vehicles, surpassing the long-held record established by a Stanley Steamer in 1906. The team achieved a speed of 139.843 mph (225.055 km/h) at Edwards Air Force Base in California&#x27;s Mojave Desert. Charles Burnett III drove the car, reaching a maximum speed of 136.103 mph(219.037 km/h) on his first run, followed by an impressive 151.085 mph(243.148 km/h) on the second run, surpassing all previous single-run records. The following day, August 26, the same vehicle, driven by Don Wales-grandson of Sir Malcolm Campbell-averaged 148.308 mph(238.679 km/h) over two consecutive runs over a kilometer. Although Wales surpassed the mile record, he deferred that achievement to Burnett. This performance was officially recorded and later rectified by the FIA.

=== Steam Speed America ===
On September 6, 2014, Chuk Williams of Steam Speed America made an attempt to break the world record with their steam-powered streamliner. During the first run, the car reached a speed of 147 mph(236.57 km/h). However, the attempt ended in disaster when the braking chutes failed to deploy, causing the vehicle to flip and cash. Williams sustained injuries in the accident, and the car was left severely damaged.

<doc id="1170996" wikidata="Q1973819" url="?curid=1170996" title="Rossland, British Columbia">
<text>Rossland is in the West Kootenay region of south central British Columbia. High in the Monashee Mountains, the city lies immediately east of the intersections of BC highways 3B and 22. The facilities provide a winter base for the nearby multi-peak ski hills of the Red Mountain Resort. In the non-winter months Rossland is frequented by mountain bikers, with golf and fishing options nearby as well.

==History==
===Name origin===

The Sinixt First Nation called the Rossland area &quot;kEluwi&#x27;sst&quot; or &quot;kmarkn&quot;. As to the word meanings, suggestions have included an &quot;important temporary camp&quot; or &quot;up in the hills&quot; for the former, and &quot;smooth top&quot; for the latter, referring to Red Mountain. Once mining claims were staked, the area became known as Trail Creek camp, the creek name derived from the Dewdney Trail.

The final naming acknowledged Ross Thompson, who preempted 160 acres in 1892. He subdivided the land into lots in 1894 to become the townsite of Thompson. A few months later, the name changed to Rossland. The postal authorities may have requested the amendment to avoid confusion with similarly named places.

===First claims===
In July 1890, partners Joe Bourjouis and Joe Morris staked claims on Red Mountain, but the assays were disappointing. Since an individual could register only two claims, the pair paid the $2.50 per claim to register the Center Star, War Eagle, Idaho and Virginia. For $10, they gave their Le Wise claim to the Deputy Recorder of Mines, &quot;Colonel&quot; Eugene Sayre Topping, to register for himself as Le Roi. Leaving government service, Topping joined a Spokane syndicate that purchased 53 per cent of the property from him for $16,000 that November. The following spring, several tons of ore went by mule down the mountain and along the Dewdney Trail to Trail Creek Landing at the creek mouth. Following boat transport to Little Dalles, Washington, the Spokane Falls and Northern Railway (SF&amp;N), and connecting lines, railed the product to the Colorado Smelting and Mining Company Works at Butte, Montana.

===Wagon roads &amp; deals===
During 1891, a patchwork of mines operated on the mountain, Le Roi Mining and Smelting Company was incorporated, and Topping sold his remaining interest for $30,000. Late the next year, a ferry across the river from the SF&amp;N station at Northport, Washington connected with Oliver Durant&#x27;s new wagon road from Red Mountain. A fleet of 40 wagons to Northport largely replaced the mule trains to Trail. That year, Bourjouis and Morris sold their Center Star and War Eagle mines, which with the Le Roi, produced 96 per cent of the mountain&#x27;s 1,500,000 tons of ore to 1903. In 1893, an wide wagon road was graded along Trail Creek, to win back traffic for Trail. The mountain output of 18,500 tons in 1894 increased ten-fold the next year.

===Early railways &amp; consolidation===
In June 1896, the first loaded ore train ran along the initial section of Heinze&#x27;s Columbia and Western Railway (C&amp;W) from Red Mountain to the Trail smelter arbitration (1938–1942). After a delay over a US right-of-way, Corbin&#x27;s Red Mountain–Northport railway, comprising the Red Mountain Railway (RMR) (BC section) and Columbia &amp; Red Mountain Railway (C&amp;RM) (WA section), opened in December 1896. The next year, Le Roi&#x27;s contract to exclusively supply the Trail smelter expired. When Le Roi owners opened the Northport smelter in January 1898, competition further intensified. That March, Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) purchased the C&amp;W and Trail smelter. That July, the Northern Pacific Railway (NP) acquired the RMR, C&amp;RM, and Northport smelter. That August, British America Corporation completed its purchase of Le Roi holdings.

===Early community===
Since miners did not own the land upon which their tents or shacks stood, many acquired freehold lots in town for permanent residences. In February 1895, the first edition of the Rossland Record listed a blacksmith, a tinsmith, a cobbler, a customs agent, a baker, a land surveyor, a lawyer, two sawyers, two barbers, three doctors, four bartenders, four hoteliers, and a justice of the peace. Months later, strict John (Jack) Kirkup became the constable. A ten-passenger coach ran to Trail Creek Landing. Presbyterian, Methodist and Roman Catholic churches, and a school, were soon established. In January 1896, a small electricity generator came on line, and was later upgraded. In 1898, West Kootenay Power became the supplier from Bonnington Falls dam.

In March 1897, Rossland became a city. The eight doctors, 17 legal firms, and 42 saloons served an estimated 7,000 residents. This peak aligned with the 1901 census count of 6,000. A string of newspapers followed, the Rossland Miner being the most enduring. The fire of August 1902 consumed both sides of upper Spokane Street, leaving only the old International Hotel standing. A December 1905 explosion wrecked roofs and shattered windows. The fires of January 1927, and March 1929, levelled the wooden buildings of Columbia Street. Depleting mines, World War I, and the Great Depression shrank the population.

===Early Map===

===Mining diminishes===
Industrial disputes, strikes and lockouts plagued the mines. Whenever possible, mine owners substituted non-union labour. Militant unions achieved an 8-hour workday in 1899, and protection of unions and their members in subsequent years. Collapsing copper prices, making mine operations unviable, compelled workers to trade job security for wage rollbacks in 1907.

In 1906, the Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company of Canada (CM&amp;S), a consortium comprising the smelter and several Red Mountain mines at Rossland, was formed. CP had a 54 per cent holding. In 1911, CM&amp;S bought Le Roi mine, gaining a virtual monopoly over mountain ore. Under new owners, the Northport smelter worked part-time during World War I, permanently closing in 1921. Service frequency on the railway line to Northport diminished during this period, with the last run in July 1921, and abandonment the next year.

===Later facilities===
When Le Roi mine closed in 1929, big ore trains ceased on the CP Rossland–Trail section. About 60 independent properties remained in operation on the mountain. In 1933, 10,000 tons were extracted, reducing to 335 tons in 1937. World War II ended mining on the mountain. By then, Rossland had become a bedroom community for Trail. Highway improvements ended rail passenger service with Trail in 1936. However, the three times a week freight train continued. Frequency progressively reduced until the line was lifted in 1966. In 1951, CP rebuilt the original station, but this replacement was demolished in 1973.

Formerly the only access was Highway 22, with Trail northeastward, and the US border southward. In 1964, Highway 3A opened northward, with paving the following year.

<text>The Rich&#x27;s Great Tree, now the Macy&#x27;s Great Tree (and briefly the Great Tree at Macy&#x27;s), was a large tall cut pine Christmas tree that had been an Atlanta tradition since 1948. As of 2013, the tree has been replaced by a much smaller artificial one in the parking lot, which was then moved back to the roof for 2014. Before ending the tradition in December 2023.

==History==
Beginning in 1948, the Rich&#x27;s department store put a large pine tree atop its flagship downtown Atlanta store, lighting it on Thanksgiving night. The idea was conceived by head of advertising Frank Pallotta. Later, the tree was perched atop the four-story &quot;Crystal Bridge&quot; that connected the original Rich&#x27;s department store with a new building addition on the opposite side of Forsyth Street. With the tree on the roof of the complex, combined with its tall height, the Great Tree could be seen for tens of miles outside the downtown district of Atlanta. It was visible for decades, until Rich&#x27;s downtown store closed in mid-1991 and the tree was moved to a smaller, less-imposing spot in Underground Atlanta. From there it was later moved to Lenox Square mall, but neither location provided as spectacular a view of the tree as when it stood on the Crystal Bridge.

As the tree became an Atlanta tradition, more was added to the display to create an attraction in its own right. This included Santa&#x27;s Workshop, complete with reindeer on loan from the Stone Mountain Park Petting Zoo that parents and children would walk through on the way to visit with Santa Claus. Also, inside the store, was &quot;Santa&#x27;s Secret Shop&quot;. Off-limits to the adults, children entered an enclosed mini shopping area. All of this &quot;spirit of Christmas&quot; started at the street level with animated window displays such as angels playing violins in the windows.

The Rich&#x27;s department store chain was sold to Federated Department Stores in 1975. After years of contraction, Federated closed Rich&#x27;s main downtown store in the 1990s and moved the tree to nearby Underground Atlanta. In 2000, the tree was relocated once again to the rooftop of Rich&#x27;s Lenox Square mall store, in the Buckhead () community, located north of the downtown and the midtown districts. Federated began a merger of the R.H. Macy&#x27;s department stores with Rich&#x27;s in the early 2000s, with the remaining Rich&#x27;s stores being renamed Rich&#x27;s-Macy&#x27;s. On January 1, 2006, the Rich&#x27;s name was dropped altogether in favor of the nationally known Macy&#x27;s moniker. The 2005 holiday season was known as the last year of &quot;Rich&#x27;s Great Tree&quot;, even though the tradition continued as &quot;The Great Tree at Macy&#x27;s&quot; (after two years as the Rich&#x27;s-Macy&#x27;s Great Tree).

After two years of incidents involving the tree (the 2011 tree snapped upon installation, and the crane removing the 2012 tree collapsed, causing damage to the store), Macy&#x27;s announced in November 2013 that the Great Tree would be replaced with a smaller artificial tree and placed in the corner of the mall parking lot, officially ending 65 years of Atlanta tradition. Atlantans can expect the new tree to grow higher with years, as Macy&#x27;s is planning to keep adding tree footage with the years to come as its budget allows, since they can acquire three-foot (nearly one-meter) sections locally from the Alpharetta-based manufacturer.

2020 brought changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic: officials had set up the tree behind closed doors.

In December 2023 Macy&#x27;s announced they ended the yearly tradition of the tree lighting.

==The original tree==
Each year through 2012, the tree itself was an eastern white pine, usually around tall, and contained several miles of electrical wiring, thousands of stringed lights, hundreds of basketball-sized ornaments and mirror balls, and dozens of strobe lights for effect. It also had a huge lighted tree topper seven feet (two meters) in diameter, previously a snowflake, and now a color-changing LED star since becoming Macy&#x27;s. For 2009, it also had 125 snowflake ornaments and 125 metallic red Macy&#x27;s stars, similar to the décor used inside its stores for the Christmas shopping season. It required hundreds of gallons of water (well over a thousand liters) each day (depending on the weather and humidity), along with bottles of aspirin to keep the tree fresh (though it is unclear how effective aspirin actually is). It was secured so as to withstand wind gusts of up to .

The tree was selected over a year before it was actually intended to be cut and used, so that it could be used as the backup should something happen to the tree that was previously selected. It was generally picked from somewhere in north Georgia. The 2009 tree was planted in late 1983 after being used indoors as a family&#x27;s first Christmas tree.

==The Pink Pig==

The Pink Pig was an amusement park ride of sorts that was a miniature suspended monorail sized for children. Adults would be hard-pressed to fit inside the enclosed cars that the children sat in as the ride operated. The original ride &quot;flew&quot; from the ceiling of the toy department. The pig was then moved outside the building to a rooftop Christmas village that surrounded the Great Tree. The Pink Pig started outside under the tree, returned indoors to fly over the toy department before returning to its starting point. The original Pink Pig was named Priscilla. A second pig, named Percival was later added to meet the high demand to ride the pig. After completing their journey, riders received a sticker that said &quot;I rode the Pink Pig&quot;.

The ride moved to the Festival of Trees event in the 1990s, and resided at the Atlanta History Center. The ride was brought back to Rich&#x27;s in 2004 when it reappeared at the Rich&#x27;s at Lenox Square mall, the new location for the Great Tree. The new version of the Pink Pig was a conventional Zamperla Rio Grande storyline train ride with a miniature pink pig locomotive pulling a set of pink child-sized passenger cars at ground level, instead of the original suspended monorail design. It had been speculated that the original monorail was retired because it could not be maintained as a viable and safe children&#x27;s ride. 

The ride went on hiatus in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and in 2021 Macy&#x27;s announced the ride was being retired.

==Fame of the Great Tree==
The tree and the bridge were featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 1961.

During the time the Great Tree was at the downtown Rich&#x27;s store, it was undeniably the biggest Christmas-time attraction in the southeastern United States. Parents from around the South brought their children to downtown Atlanta expressly to experience this attraction and have their picture taken with the Rich&#x27;s store Santa Claus. Millions of children and their parents made the annual migration during its tenure. The Pink Pig was an immensely popular attraction in its own right. Decades after the original Pink Pig was retired, many Atlanta natives who rode the pig as children fondly reminisce about their rides in the pig. The ride inspired the 2004 book &quot;I Rode the Pink Pig: Atlanta&#x27;s Favorite Christmas Tradition&quot; (). Today, much memorabilia can be found in the homes of Atlantans.

==The Lighting of the Great Tree==
Through 2014, the grand illumination ceremony occurred on Thanksgiving night, no matter the weather. Since the 1980s, it has been regularly aired on television station WSB-TV, which now shows it in high definition. Christmas carols are sung by various music celebrities and local groups, and at least one is usually chimed by a bell choir. The tree is lit near the very end of the hour on the highest note of &quot;O Holy Night&quot; (during the line &quot;O Night Divine&quot;), and remains lit every night at least through New Year&#x27;s Eve. Since at least 2012, a fireworks display immediately follows the lighting.

For years the ceremony had been held from 7:00 to 8:00 PM, but for 2013 it was moved an hour earlier due to the store opening. For 2014, it was moved another hour earlier, so that it was not yet even completely dark during the lighting, with local sunset occurring at 5:30pm. For 2015, the store will open even earlier, which would force the lighting into the afternoon. For this reason, the 67-year Thanksgiving tradition was abandoned, pushing the lighting to the Sunday before.

Originally, four choirs sang from the north face of the Crystal Bridge, which connected all but the lower two levels of the downtown Rich&#x27;s over Forsyth Street. Each of the four floors of choirs, ordered from bottom to top, sang during the program. stained glass panels (still used by Macy&#x27;s) were put in the bridge&#x27;s windows on either side (left and right) of each choir, giving the ceremony an almost church-like effect. Street lights were turned off in the area below so there was no glare for the thousands of spectators that gathered every year regardless of the weather. The host/storyteller of those earlier days was Bob van Camp of WSB Atlanta radio and television, and once the organist at the Fox Theatre.

The ceremony, in those days, was based on the reading of the traditional birth of Christ, i.e. the &quot;Christmas Story&quot;, unlike today&#x27;s more generic &quot;holiday&quot; themes and music.

Over the years the crowds grew. The venue expanded to include the south side of the bridge. Thus, four more choirs were added. Although heard by everyone, the ceremony of choirs alternated between the bridge facings. For the conclusion of the ceremony, all of the bridge choirs (of both musical eras) were lighted on every floor, and leading towards the soloist&#x27;s highest note in &quot;O Holy Night&quot;, at which point the lights on the great tree burst alive to shine on downtown Atlanta.

Before rock and roll became the predominant form of popular music in the 1970s, the Christmas carols were sung in a traditional, even classical manner, but in more modern times, nearly all of them have tended to be performed in a gospel music style, including &quot;O Holy Night&quot;. In earlier years, for example, &quot;O Holy Night&quot; was performed by an operatic soprano, while in 2006, it was performed by LeAnn Rimes. The 2009 concert included country music singer Josh Turner and gospel singer Mandisa (who sang the keynote), and dance crew SoReal Cru using remixed versions of classic Christmas songs from &quot;Merry Mixmas&quot; and other albums.

Beginning in 2015 the lighting of Macy&#x27;s Great Tree, that year the &quot;68th edition of the Great Tree&quot;, was changed from Thanksgiving night to the Sunday before Thanksgiving, at 7:00PM This returned the ceremony to its traditional time, well after sunset at the western edge of the Eastern time zone. When asked specifically about the reason for the move from Thursday to Sunday, a Macy&#x27;s spokesperson claimed &quot;It&#x27;s what our customers want.&quot; However, the apparent reason behind the move is so that Macy&#x27;s could start their Black Friday sale even earlier on Thanksgiving. From 2015 through 2019, the ceremony was held on the Sunday before Thanksgiving. In 2020, it was again moved, to the Thursday a week before Thanksgiving. The 2020 ceremony was restricted to a small invitation-only private event, due to COVID. The 2021 ceremony was also private, by invitation only. The 75th ceremony will take place Thursday, November 17, 2022.

==Other history==

===Transition from Rich&#x27;s to Macy&#x27;s===
After an announcement was made in 2004, Rich&#x27;s stores became Rich&#x27;s-Macy&#x27;s in early 2005, and for Christmas that year and the next, the Rich&#x27;s Great Tree became the &quot;Great Tree at Macy&#x27;s&quot;.
In 2007, the still-new name was dropped in favor of &quot;Macy&#x27;s Great Tree&quot;, after all Rich&#x27;s stores became Macy&#x27;s, eliminating the retailer after 140 years. The only visible reminders of Rich&#x27;s are the Great Tree, and the façade of the original (1924) part of the Rich&#x27;s building, now attached to the Sam Nunn Atlanta Federal Building via another four-story bridge where the Crystal Bridge was. ()

===Trees that snapped===
In 2004, the tree from Snellville snapped about two-thirds of the way up while workers were attempting to use a crane to lift it from the ground to the roof. Since the tree was rather late in being set up to begin with (November 14 was only 11 days before Thanksgiving that year), a replacement tree (always selected in case of an emergency such as this) was being rushed in from nearby Lithia Springs. In 2003, it took eight workers three weeks to accomplish the massive decorating task. The tree also snapped in 1974, the year before Federated bought Rich&#x27;s from the Rich family. In 2011, the tree from Douglasville cracked when being lifted off the flatbed truck, after being picked in the first contest to select the tree. Citing safety concerns, another tree from near the first was to be brought in, leaving barely over a week until Thanksgiving for the tree to be decorated.

===Crane collapse===
The day after New Year&#x27;s Day 2013, the arm of the crane removing the tree buckled and collapsed, sending the trunk of the tree crashing partially through the roof and into the third-floor men&#x27;s department. That portion of the store sustained extensive water damage due to broken fire sprinkler pipes. Nobody was injured, as it was being removed early in the morning, before the store opened. Workers had to cut the tree apart after removing lights and giant ornaments, which were still on the tree as it was being removed.

<text>Mount Tamalpais (; ; Miwok: &quot;Támal Pájiṣ&quot;), known locally as Mount Tam, is a peak in Marin County, California, United States, often considered symbolic of Marin County. Much of Mount Tamalpais is protected within public lands such as Mount Tamalpais State Park, the Marin Municipal Water District watershed, and National Park Service land, such as Muir Woods.

==Toponym==
The name &quot;Tamalpais&quot; was first recorded in 1845. It comes from the Coast Miwok name for this mountain, &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;west hill&quot;.

Various different folk etymologies also exist, but they are unsubstantiated. One holds that it comes from the Spanish &quot;Tamal país&quot;, meaning &quot;Tamal country,&quot; &quot;Tamal&quot; being the name that the Spanish missionaries gave to the Coast Miwok people. Another holds that the name is the Coast Miwok word for &quot;sleeping maiden&quot; and is taken from the &quot;Legend of the Sleeping Maiden&quot;. Supposedly, the legend is that the mountain&#x27;s contour reflects the reclining profile of a young Miwok girl who was saved from a rival tribe by the shuddering of the mountain. However, this legend actually has no basis in Coast Miwok myth and is instead a piece of Victorian-era apocrypha. The &quot;Sleeping Lady&quot; story was the creation of playwright Dan Totheroh, who wrote the first play performed at Mt. Tamalpais&#x27; Mountain Theater about Tamelpa, the Mountain Queen. Another suggests a tie to the Eurasian origins of the Miwoks, where &quot;pais&quot; means place and &quot;tamal&quot; is a tribe in Siberia.

==Geography==
Mount Tamalpais is the highest peak in the Marin Hills, which are part of the Northern California Coast Ranges. The elevation at the West Peak, where a radar dome currently stands, is between and . It stood over before the summit was flattened for the radar dome construction. The East Peak is at . The mountain is clearly visible from parts of San Francisco and the East Bay.

The majority of the mountain is contained in protected public lands, including Mount Tamalpais State Park, Muir Woods National Monument, and the Mount Tamalpais Watershed. It adjoins the Golden Gate National Recreation Area (which in turn adjoins Point Reyes National Seashore) as well as several Marin County Open Space Preserves. This provides nearly of continuous publicly accessible open space. Some of the lower slopes of Mount Tamalpais fall within several cities and unincorporated communities of Marin County, including Mill Valley, Tamalpais-Homestead Valley, Stinson Beach, and Kentfield. These areas are generally developed, consisting of mostly low-density single-family homes.

==Natural history==

===Geology and soils===
Like the rest of the California Coast Ranges, Mount Tamalpais is the result of uplift, buckling, and folding of the North American Plate as it slides along the Pacific Plate near the San Andreas Fault zone.

In 2004, a team of Penn State geoscientists suggested that a blind thrust fault, like the one that caused the infamous Northridge earthquake, lies beneath Mount Tamalpais. This idea was partly based on the steepness of Mount Tamalpais and of nearby Bolinas Ridge, such steepness on the visible surface often being the result of blind thrust faults. Another reason for the suggestion was that the San Andreas Fault creeps more slowly south of Mount Tamalpais than it does in its sections north of Mount Tamalpais and in the Olema Valley, and that the existence of a blind thrust fault may explain the different creeping velocities. If a blind thrust fault does exist under Mount Tamalpais, and if it ruptures, it could be potentially devastating to the North Bay, San Francisco, and any other nearby locale resting on unstable earth and loose fill.

Major Mount Tamalpais rockforms include serpentine, particularly evident in outcroppings near the summit and on the north side. A number of serpentine endemic plants grow in the serpentine soils in this part of the mountain.

===Hydrology===

Since the steep slopes of Mount Tamalpais force out moisture from passing storms and/or fog, the mountain supports several year-round streams like Redwood Creek on the southern face of the mountain down into Muir Woods. The steep southeastern slopes of Mount Tamalpais drain to Arroyo Corte Madera del Presidio, which in turn discharges to Richardson Bay.

===Climate===

With its height, various faces, and proximity to the ocean and bay, the mountain contains many microclimates, ranging from cool and foggy in lower ocean-facing valleys with their redwood forests, to hot and dry on the manzanita slopes, cool and breezy at the summit, and shady on the heavily Douglas-fir-forested north slopes near Alpine Lake.
Annual precipitation around Mount Tamalpais varies greatly from around 27.5–31.5 inches (700–800 mm) in the drier, eastern foothills to about 59 inches (1,500 mm) near the Bolinas Ridge, close to the Pacific Ocean. Both Mount Tamalpais and the Bolinas Ridge force moisture out of the air efficiently, since the air is cooled rapidly as it ascends the steep mountain faces and thus Mount Tamalpais&#x27;s western part is heavily forested with tall redwoods and Douglas firs. The same fact holds for the steep, south-facing bowl canyon that Muir Woods is located in, with precipitation in Redwood Canyon at around 39.4–47.2 inches (1,000–1,200 mm).

As in San Francisco, most of the annual precipitation falls during the winter months. During cold, wet winter storms, the mountain also regularly gets some snowfall, sometimes as much as overnight, as observed in February 2001, March 2006, February 2011, February 2019, and February 2023. The region sometimes gets hit with strong Pacific storms that may topple trees, and bring hurricane-force winds to exposed, barren areas like the Bolinas Ridge and the summit of Mount Tamalpais. In summer, the area gets almost no precipitation, except for fog drip that occurs in Muir Woods, the Bolinas Ridge and the western end of Mount Tamalpais, where summer fog and oceanic breezes are more prevalent. In contrast, the eastern foothills, sheltered from the oceanic breezes and fog, are drier, since the foothills force little moisture out of the air. This leads to the fact that the eastern slopes contain only oak, pine, chaparral shrub, coastal sage scrub, grassland and sparse Douglas-fir forest. Coastal sage scrub also occurs on some of the exposed coastal slopes.

Temperatures on top of Mount Tamalpais are generally somewhat cooler than places next to the San Francisco Bay or the ocean due to elevation. In summer, however, the top of Mount Tamalpais may actually be warmer than the middle, foggy elevations due to a thermal inversion. The summer fog and breezes make locations on Mount Tamalpais, closer to the ocean, cooler than the blazing hot interior valleys.

===Plant communities===
Hardwood woodland types are generally subtypes of California oak woodland, including oak-bay-madrone forest, oak woodland, and oak savannah. Oak-bay-madrone forests are found in areas with moderate moisture and particularly favor north-facing slopes. They are dominated by one or more of three hardwood tree species – Coast Live Oak, California bay, and madrone. Coast live oak tends to be dominant in somewhat drier areas, while bay is more dominant in shadier, moister areas; madrone is abundant in certain soil types in both moist and dry spots. Oak woodlands are a more open-canopy forest dominated by coast live oak, while oak savannah has a completely open canopy and represents a mixture of coast live oak woodland and grassland.

The great diversity of microclimates on Mount Tamalpais ensures a wide variety of plant communities as well. Plant communities on the mountain include various types of hardwood and coniferous forests, coastal scrub, chaparral, grassland, and wetland vegetation. Wholly or partially coniferous forest types are found in the moistest areas of Mount Tamalpais. Coast redwood forests are restricted to areas where the particular ecological needs of redwood are met: areas characterized by high overall moisture, low elevations below the fog line, and deep soils. Muir Woods is the most extensive and best-known redwood forest of the Mount Tamalpais area. Mixed evergreen forests of various combinations of tanoak, madrone, coast and canyon live oak, and Douglas-fir are found in moist areas on middle to high elevations on the mountain. Very moist areas of mixed evergreen forest may also include bay, redwood, and California torreya. Areas in which mixed evergreen forests are predominant include areas of Fairfax-Bolinas Road and Ridgecrest Boulevard and around Alpine Lake.
Various kinds of scrub communities are also widespread. Low-elevation areas below the fog line with relatively low overall rainfall or thin soils are often the site of a northern coastal scrub community characterized by coastal sage-coyote brush association, with lesser amounts of poison-oak, bush monkeyflower, California blackberry, western bracken fern, and various species of grasses and forbs. Chaparral is predominant in areas characterized by thin, rocky soils and little moisture. Two main types of chaparral are found the mountain chamise chaparral and manzanita chaparral. Chamise is dominant in the hottest, most xeric areas of the mountain, particularly on south- and west-facing slopes, while manzanita is dominant in other xeric areas, particularly on east-facing slopes and forest borders. Areas of mixed chamise-manzanita chaparral occur in relatively more mesic areas; &quot;Ceanothus&quot; and dwarfed interior live oak may also predominate on such sites. Areas in which various kinds of chaparral communities are dominant include areas along Old Railroad Grade.

Grassland areas are also common on Mount Tamalpais. Native perennial bunchgrass species were originally dominant, but most of these grasslands are now dominated by invasive annual grasses of European origin. Native grasslands, still found in a few isolated areas, are of two types. Northern coastal prairie is found below the fog line and is characterized by a &quot;Festuca&quot;-&quot;Danthonia&quot; association, while valley grassland, found in drier areas, is dominated by &quot;Nassella pulchra&quot;, with &quot;Elymus glaucus&quot; and &quot;Leymus triticoides&quot; also being common.
Wetland vegetation types found on Mount Tamalpais include coastal riparian forests, wet meadows, and some marsh areas. Coastal riparian forest is predominant along the valley streams of Mount Tamalpais. Red and white alder (&quot;Alnus rubra&quot; and &quot;Alnus rhombifolia&quot;) and arroyo and yellow willow (&quot;Salix lasiolepis&quot; and &quot;S. lasiandra&quot;) are dominant in these types of woodland, with bigleaf maple (&quot;Acer macrophyllum&quot;), box-elder (&quot;Acer negundo&quot; ssp. &quot;californicum&quot;), and California bay also being common. Wet meadows are present in several high-elevation spots on the mountain, while High Marsh represents a rare example of a marsh community on the mountain.
Serpentine soils have a high rate of endemism and are the site of several unique subtypes of the above plant communities. Serpentine grasslands are some of the few grasslands in which native perennial grasses are still relatively dominant. Serpentine chaparral forms a unique plant community, dominated by dwarfed leather oak (&quot;Quercus durata&quot;), Jepson ceanothus (&quot;Ceanothus jepsonii&quot;), Tamalpais manzanita (&quot;&quot;), and Sargent cypress (&quot;Cupressus sargentii&quot;). On the upper slopes of the mountain, small groves of Sargent cypress trees up to 50 feet (15 m) tall can be found in serpentine areas.

Several species of endemic plants are found only on serpentine soils; these species may be widespread, but only occur on serpentine soils, or the may be more restricted, only growing in a few other places besides Mount Tamalpais, or may even be restricted just to Mount Tamalpais. The Mount Tamalpais thistle (&quot;Cirsium hydrophilum&quot; var. &quot;vaseyi&quot;), for example, is a rare variety of thistle known only from the serpentine seeps of the mountain. The Mount Tamalpais jewelflower (&quot;Streptanthus batrachopus&quot;) is also limited to the area.

===Wildlife===
Mount Tamalpais provides one of the last remaining wildlife refuges in the Bay Area. Urbanization has invaded wildlife habitat, forcing many fauna in southern Marin County to retreat up onto Mount Tamalpais, Muir Woods, and the Bolinas Ridge. A wide variety of avifauna, amphibians, arthropods and mammals are found on Mount Tamalpais, including a number of rare and endangered species. Mt. Tamalpais and the neighboring Golden Gate Recreation Area together encompass over 115 square miles (298 square kilometers) of land, forming one of the largest preserved parklands located near a U.S. urban center.

==History==

The Coast Miwok are said to have believed that an evil witch dwelled at the top of Mount Tamalpais and therefore never set foot on the peak.

Tamalpais was home to the Mount Tamalpais and Muir Woods Railway, also known as &quot;The Crookedest Railroad in the World,&quot; a railroad which wound its way from downtown Mill Valley up to the mountain&#x27;s East Peak, starting in 1896. An auto road was constructed to the peak as automobiles gained popularity in the 1920s. The 8-mile standard-gauge railroad used conventional rails but required mountain-climbing geared steam locomotives and operated from 1896 to 1930.

Early wireless towers were constructed on the mountain in the early 20th century, only to be destroyed by one of the periodic hurricane-force windstorms.

In late November 1944, a US Navy plane crashed into the mountain after developing engine trouble shortly after takeoff from Alameda Naval Air Station. All eight aviators on board were killed.

The U.S. Weather Bureau operated a weather station at the site of the now defunct Mill Valley Air Force Station for many years.

The peak and its surrounding areas are the birthplace of mountain biking in the 1970s, where early mountain bikers such as Gary Fisher, Charlie Kelly, and Joe Breeze were active.

British philosopher Alan Watts owned a cabin on Mount Tamalpais later in his life where he ultimately died in his sleep of heart failure on November 16, 1973.

On top of the East Peak is a fire lookout station, staffed during the summer months by volunteers with the Marin County Fire Department.

==Recreation==
Mount Tamalpais is a hiking, picnicking, mountain and road cycling, horseback riding, and hang-gliding destination for residents of the San Francisco Bay Area, with over of trails and fire roads. With numerous trailheads, a well-networked trail and road system, and hikes of greatly varying length and difficulty, the mountain offers a compelling range of attractions. Marin Municipal Water District maintains several reservoirs on the north slopes of Mount Tamalpais, including Alpine Lake, Kent Lake, Bon Tempe Lake, Phoenix Lake, and Lake Lagunitas.

The western slopes of the mountain descend to the Pacific Ocean at Stinson Beach. The annual Dipsea Race traverses the mountain from Mill Valley to Stinson Beach. Though backpack camping isn&#x27;t allowed, walk-in camping exists at the Pantoll and Bootjack campgrounds. The historic Bootjack Campground was established in the early 1920s by the Tamalpais Conservation Corps, and the Civilian Conservation Corps further refined the campground facilities in the 1930s. Showing substantial signs of overuse, the campground was closed by State Parks in 1969. The Bootjack Campground and Trail were reopened on Thursday, June 5, 2014.

Trailhead parking within Mt. Tamalpais State Park is available generally with a self-service fee ($8). The scenic Ridgecrest Blvd. running along the ridgeline between the Rock Spring trailhead and Fairfax-Bolinas Road, with panoramic views of the summit, Pacific, San Francisco, Bolinas, and Point Reyes, is featured in many automobile and other advertisements, as well as being the local hang-gliding launch point. Mount Tam is also home to the Edgewood Botanic Garden and to the Sidney B. Cushing Amphitheatre where Broadway musical productions are performed every year by the Mountain Play Association. Monthly astronomy viewings and lectures are held at Rock Spring and Mountain Theater April through October by Mt Tam Astronomy.

===Hiking and mountain biking===

Since the Mount Tamalpais area contains large expanses of undeveloped, natural land, there are many trails and trailheads that criss-cross the area. Many of these trails are used by hikers and bikers seeking refuge from the urban landscape of the San Francisco Bay Area. Some of these trails, including the mountaintop or ridgetop trails, have views of the San Francisco Bay and Pacific Ocean. Other trails, usually lower elevation valley trails, lead into natural, dense groves of mature Douglas-fir and redwood trees, clear, open grassland, and shrublands. All roads leading to the many trailheads around Mount Tamalpais are usually open, but during fire season some of these roads may be closed due to high fire risk.

The many roads, paved and unpaved, that cross the Mount Tamalpais region are used by mountain bikers, especially on weekends. Mount Tamalpais played an instrumental role in the birth of mountain biking many years ago, with pioneer frame builders such as Tom Ritchey, Gary Fisher, and Joe Breeze setting up shops in nearby towns. There has been considerable controversy over trail access for mountain bikes, both in terms of environmental impact and the safety of other trail users. As a result, bicycles have been banned from the majority of narrow, single-track trails, though bicycles are still allowed on fire roads. The fire roads on Mt. Tam are mixed-use and they are commonly used as running, hiking, biking and horseback riding routes.

The Dipsea Race, the oldest cross-country trail running race in the U.S., is held in the area and part of the trail traverses the mountain from Mill Valley to Stinson Beach.

===Theater===

Broadway musicals are performed outdoors, several times each summer, in the stone open air Cushing Memorial Amphitheatre on the southern side of Mt. Tam.

<doc id="1171007" wikidata="Q844931" url="?curid=1171007" title="Kashiwa Reysol">
<text>is a Japanese professional football club based in Kashiwa, Chiba Prefecture, part of the Greater Tokyo Area. The club plays in the J1 League, which is the top tier of football in the country. Their home stadium is Sankyo Frontier Kashiwa Stadium, also known as &quot;Hitachidai&quot;. &quot;Reysol&quot; is a portmanteau of the Spanish words &quot;Rey&quot; and &quot;Sol&quot;, meaning &quot;Sun King&quot;. The name alludes to their parent company Hitachi, whose name means &quot;rising sun&quot; in Japanese.

The club was formed in 1940 and was a founding member (&quot;Original Eight&quot;) of the Japan Soccer League (JSL) in 1965. Since the league&#x27;s inception, they have spent the majority of their existence in the top tier of Japanese football. They have been Japanese League champions twice in 1972 and 2011, and have won three League Cups in 1976, 1999 and 2013, and three Emperor&#x27;s Cups in 1972, 1975 and 2012.

==History==
===Hitachi SC (1939–1992)===
The club started in 1939 and was officially formed as the company team, Hitachi, Ltd. Soccer Club in 1940 in Kodaira, Tokyo. The club formed the Japan Soccer League (JSL) in 1965, along with today&#x27;s Urawa Reds, JEF United Chiba, Cerezo Osaka, Sanfrecce Hiroshima and three other clubs (&quot;Original Eight&quot;). They had some successes during the mid-1970s, winning Emperor&#x27;s Cups and JSL titles and contributing several players to the Japanese national team.

The club relocated from Kodaira to Kashiwa in 1986, but it took a while to adapt to the new town, as they were relegated to the JSL Division 2 at end of the 1986. They made it back to the top flight in 1989–90, but dropped back in 1990–91 and returned again in 1991–92. As the J.League was formed while they were not strong enough, the club abandoned any attempt to once again be a founding member of the newly formed professional league. Instead, the club joined the Japan Football League Division 1 in 1992, the second tier of the Japanese football hierarchy at the time, below the J.League.

=== Kashiwa Reysol (1993–) ===
The club changed its name to Kashiwa Reysol in 1993. Reysol added Careca of the Brazil national football team to their squad in the autumn of this year with the aim of winning the JFL champion and winning promotion to the J1 League. The club struggled in the 1993 season. However, with the help of Careca and Brazilian manager Zé Sérgio, they secured the 2nd place in the JFL in 1994, earning promotion to the top league.

Reysol debuted in the J1 League in 1995. In 1998 they welcomed Akira Nishino, the former manager of Japan&#x27;s Olympic team as their new manager, along with player Hristo Stoichkov of the Bulgaria national football team. In 1999 Hong Myung-bo of the Korea national football team was added to the squad. The team won the J.League Cup in 1999, their first title as Kashiwa Reysol.

However, their next manager, Englishman Steve Perryman, unsettled the team and the club struggled over the next several seasons. After finishing at the 16th place out of 18 clubs in 2005, the club lost the J.League promotion / relegation series against Ventforet Kofu, the 3rd placed team in the J2 League that year, and was relegated to the J2 League.

A new manager, Nobuhiro Ishizaki, led an almost entirely new squad in 2006 and the club secured automatic promotion to the J1 League in the last game of the season.

The club was relegated again at the end of 2009. However, in 2010 they won the J2 League led by Nelsinho Baptista in and returned to the top flight. The club immediately won the J1 League in 2011 with talented footballers such as Hiroki Sakai, Junya Tanaka, Jorge Wagner and Leandro Domingues, and became the first Japanese club to win the second tier and the top tier back to back. The club qualified for the FIFA Club World Cup as the host nation&#x27;s league champion and became a semifinalist after defeating Auckland City and Monterrey.

During the period from 2010 through 2014, Reysol won six different titles in five consecutive seasons; the J2 League in 2010, the J1 League in 2011, the Emperor&#x27;s Cup and the Super Cup in 2012, the J.League Cup in 2013 and the Suruga Bank Championship in 2014.

== Rivalries ==

=== Marunouchi Gosanke ===
Historically, Kashiwa Reysol&#x27;s fiercest rivals have been JEF United Chiba and the Urawa Reds, both close neighbors. The three were co-founders of the Japan Soccer League (JSL) in 1965, and spent most seasons in the top tier through the JSL era. Because of their former parent companies&#x27; headquarters all being based in Marunouchi, Tokyo, the three clubs were known as the &quot;Marunouchi Gosanke&quot; (丸の内御三家, &quot;Marunouchi Big Three&quot;) and fixtures among them were known as the Marunouchi derbies.

=== Chiba derby ===
Reysol and JEF United Chiba first met in 1941 in the ancient Kanto regional football league. The two clubs are both now based in Chiba Prefecture, and their rivalry is known as the Chiba derby. They play a pre-season friendly match every year, popularly known as the Chibagin Cup (i.e., &quot;Chiba Bank Cup&quot;) since 1995.

=== Others ===
Reysol also has a rivalry with Kashima Antlers (commonly called Tonegawa clásico), FC Tokyo (commonly called Kanamachi derby) and Omiya Ardija (commonly called Nodasen derby).

== Anthem ==
Kashiwa Reysol&#x27;s anthem is We Are Reysol, which is sung by anime singer Hironobu Kageyama. The song released in 1994, the same year Reysol got promoted to J1.

<doc id="1171015" wikidata="Q2093611" url="?curid=1171015" title="Stoned Love">
<text>&quot;Stoned Love&quot; is a 1970 hit single recorded by The Supremes for the Motown label. It was the last &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop Top Ten hit for the group, peaking at number seven, and their last &quot;Billboard&quot; number-one R&amp;B hit as well, although the trio continued to score top ten hits in the UK into 1972. In the UK, it was the post-Ross Supremes&#x27; biggest hit, reaching number 3 in the singles chart. The single spent six weeks in the UK top ten and five weeks in the US top ten. The BBC ranked &quot;Stoned Love&quot; at number 99 on &quot;The Top 100 Digital Motown Chart&quot;, which ranks Motown releases solely on their all time UK downloads and streams.

==History==
===Song information===
A plea for love and peace similar to those recorded by Sly &amp; the Family Stone in the late 1960s, the lyrics of &quot;Stoned Love&quot; were a plea for the people of the world to end conflict and animosity between each other, specifically the Vietnam War. Writer Kenny Thomas chose the term &quot;stone love&quot; to define the concept of an unchanging bond between one another. The same phrase appeared more than sixteen years later in Kool &amp; the Gang&#x27;s title &quot;Stone Love&quot; and in a slight variant two years later in The Stylistics&#x27; title &quot;I&#x27;m Stone in Love with You&quot;.

Thomas was a Detroit teenager who had entered some of his songs into a local radio talent show, which record producer Frank Wilson happened to tune into. Wilson arranged a meeting with the young musician at Thomas&#x27; house, where he proceeded to play a number of songs on a guitar that only had two strings. One of the songs he played was an unfinished version of &quot;Stoned Love.&quot; Wilson was very much impressed with the song and came back to Thomas&#x27; house a few days later with, to Thomas&#x27; delight and surprise, Supremes member Mary Wilson (no relation to Frank).

After a few lines of the song were revised by the producer, &quot;Stoned Love&quot; was recorded during the spring of 1970. The instrumental track was recorded with The Funk Brothers and at least 30 other session musicians in Detroit at Motown Studio B (the former Golden World studio), while Jean Terrell, Mary Wilson, and Cindy Birdsong recorded their vocals in New York. The song was originally written and recorded as &quot;Stone Love&quot;, but during the process of mixing and releasing, it was mislabeled as &quot;Stoned Love&quot;.

===Release and controversy===
Many people saw the song as a coded reference to drug use, and many radio station owners were at first apprehensive to play the record. Motown founder Berry Gordy was also said to have hated the song, and label executive Barney Ales had to arrange for the RKO radio stations to agree to play &quot;Stoned Love&quot; before releasing the single. Fearing that the song was indeed a reference to drug use, CBS cut a live performance of the song from a November 1970 episode of &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot;.

The Supremes&#x27; album &quot;New Ways but Love Stays&quot;, released in October 1970, spawned only &quot;Stoned Love&quot; as a single. The song also appears in the 1994 film &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; starring Tom Hanks. In 2004 neo soul singer Angie Stone covered the tune as the intro to her &quot;Stone Love&quot; album.

===In other media===
Manchester band The Stone Roses used the song as their intro track before taking to the stage for each night of their hugely successful 2012 reunion tour.

==Notes==
*1 Kenny Thomas&#x27; writing credit on &quot;Stoned Love&quot; is listed as &quot;Yennek Samoht&quot;; his name spelled backwards (with an extra &quot;e&quot; to aid pronunciation). He did this both to emulate Stevie Wonder (who recorded an instrumental album under the name &quot;Eivets Rednow&quot;) and because he thought &quot;Samoht&quot; was close to the last name of his idol Nina Simone.

==Personnel==
* Lead vocals by Jean Terrell
* Background vocals by Jean Terrell, Mary Wilson and Cindy Birdsong
* Instrumentation by the Funk Brothers
* Arranged by David Van De Pitte

<doc id="1171017" wikidata="Q133793" url="?curid=1171017" title="Brassia">
<text>Brassia is a genus of orchids classified in the subtribe Oncidiinae. It is native to Mexico, Central America, the West Indies, and northern South America, with one species (&quot;B. caudata&quot;) extending into Florida.

The genus was named after William Brass, a British botanist and illustrator, who collected plants in Africa under the supervision of Sir Joseph Banks. Its abbreviation in the horticultural trade is Brs.

== Description ==
&quot;Brassia&quot; species and its popular hybrids are common in cultivation, and are notable for the characteristic long and spreading tepals (in some clones longer than 50 cm), which lend them the common name spider orchid. The grex Eternal Wind is a recipient of the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

This epiphytic genus occurs in wet forests from sea level to altitudes under 1500 m, with the Peruvian Andes as its center of diversity. Occurrence is mostly restricted to a certain area, but &quot;Brassia caudata&quot; can be found over the whole geographic area.

They have large elliptic-oblong pseudobulbs with one or two leaves at the apex, lateral, unbranched many-flowered inflorescences with small floral bracts. The lip is not attached to the column. The pollinarium shows a narrow stipe. There are two distichous, foliaceous sheaths around the base, from which the inflorescence emerges.

&quot;Brassia&quot; has a very specific method for pollination; it uses entomophily - pollination by insects - and in this case specifically by female spider-hunter wasps of the genera &quot;Pepsis&quot; and &quot;Campsomeris&quot;. Mistaken by the mimicry of &quot;Brassia&quot;, the wasp stings the lip, while trying to grasp its prey without any success. By these movements the wasp comes into contact with the pollinarium, that then sticks to its head. By flying to another &quot;Brassia&quot; flower, this flower gets pollinated.

<text>Fisheries science is the academic discipline of managing and understanding fisheries. It is a multidisciplinary science, which draws on the disciplines of limnology, oceanography, freshwater biology, marine biology, meteorology, conservation, ecology, population dynamics, economics, statistics, decision analysis, management, and many others in an attempt to provide an integrated picture of fisheries. In some cases new disciplines have emerged, as in the case of bioeconomics and fisheries law. Because fisheries science is such an all-encompassing field, fisheries scientists often use methods from a broad array of academic disciplines. Over the most recent several decades, there have been declines in fish stocks (populations) in many regions along with increasing concern about the impact of intensive fishing on marine and freshwater biodiversity.

Fisheries science is typically taught in a university setting, and can be the focus of an undergraduate, master&#x27;s or Ph.D. program. Some universities offer fully integrated programs in fisheries science. Graduates of university fisheries programs typically find employment as scientists, fisheries managers of both recreational and commercial fisheries, researchers, aquaculturists, educators, environmental consultants and planners, conservation officers, and many others.


==Fisheries research==
Because fisheries take place in a diverse set of aquatic environments (i.e., high seas, coastal areas, large and small rivers, and lakes of all sizes), research requires different sampling equipment, tools, and techniques. For example, studying trout populations inhabiting mountain lakes requires a very different set of sampling tools than, say, studying salmon in the high seas. Ocean fisheries research vessels (FRVs) often require platforms which are capable of towing different types of fishing nets, collecting plankton or water samples from a range of depths, and carrying acoustic fish-finding equipment. Fisheries research vessels are often designed and built along the same lines as a large fishing vessel, but with space given over to laboratories and equipment storage, as opposed to storage of the catch. In addition to a diverse set of sampling gear, fisheries scientists often use scientific techniques from many different professional disciplines.

Other important areas of fisheries research are population dynamics, economics, social studies and genetics.

<text>Tolaga Bay () is both a bay and small town on the East Coast of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island located 45 kilometres northeast of Gisborne and 30 kilometres south of Tokomaru Bay.

The region around the bay is rugged and remote, and for many years the only access to the town was by boat. Because the bay is shallow, a long wharf – the second longest in New Zealand (600m) after the Tiwai Point wharf at Bluff (1,500m) – was built in the 1920s to accommodate visiting vessels. The last cargo ship to use the wharf loaded a cargo of maize in 1967.

The town is a popular holiday spot. Its population is predominantly Māori, a centre of the Te Aitanga-a-Hauiti hapū and home of Ariki – Te Kani a Takirau and Tohunga – Rangiuia.

==Geography==
The Ūawa River reaches the Pacific Ocean in the middle of Tolaga Bay. There is a bar at the river mouth with around 2 metres of water at high tide. The Ūawa River is called the Hikuwai further up. Tributaries include the Waiau and the Mangaheia. In 2018 heavy rains washed huge amounts of discarded forestry timber (or slash) down the Ūawa River, which choked up the estuary, covered the beach, and caused extensive damage to farms and houses.

An island in the bay was originally named Spöring Island by Cook, after his expedition&#x27;s assistant naturalist and instrument maker, Herman Spöring, a Finnish botanist. It is however today again known by its Māori name, Pourewa.

The bay has an arched rock, sometimes known as Spörings Arch, which was illustrated by Herman Spöring Jr. in James Cook&#x27;s voyage in October 1769.
===Parks===

Uawa Reserve is the settlement&#x27;s local sports ground.

==History==

Tolaga Bay was named by Lt. James Cook in 1769. Described as &quot;an obvious corruption of a Maori name&quot;, the exact derivation of the name is unclear. It may have been a misunderstanding of &quot;teraki&quot; or &quot;tarakaka&quot;, referring to the local south-westerly wind rather than the place. The original Māori name is Uawa Nui A Ruamatua (shortened to Uawa), and some local residents now refer to the area as Hauiti, and themselves as Hauitians from the local hapū Te Aitanga-a-Hauiti.

At the time of Cook&#x27;s visit, according to Anne Salmond, here &quot;a famous school of learning (Known as Te Rawheoro) that specialized in tribal lore and carving was sited...&quot; Tupaia, the Raiatean navigator accompanying Cook since Tahiti, met with the &quot;tohunga&quot;, priest, of this &quot;whare wananga&quot;. Tupaia exchanged news of the &quot;Māori island homelands, known to Māori as &#x27;Rangiatea&#x27; (Ra&#x27;iatea), &#x27;Hawaiki&#x27; (Havai&#x27;i, the ancient name for Rai&#x27;iatea), and &#x27;Tawhiti&#x27; (Tahiti).&quot; The Māori viewed Tupaia as a tohunga, and many children born during his visit bore his name. Additionally, Tupaia made a sketch within the rock shelter of Opoutama (&#x27;Cook&#x27;s Cove&#x27; or &#x27;Tupaia&#x27;s Cave&#x27;), according to Joel Polack.

In the 1830s there was a thriving flax trade involving early European traders like Barnet Burns. By 1998, the wharf had deteriorated and was in danger of being closed. In response, the Tolaga Bay Save the Wharf Trust raised funds and gained technical help to restore it. The wharf has now been re-opened and the refurbishment project finished in May 2013.

==Marae==

Two marae are located south of the main township:
* Te Rawheoro Marae and Te Rawheoro meeting house is a meeting place of the Ngāti Porou hapū of Ngāti Patu Whare, Te Aitanga a Hauiti and Ngāti Wakarara.

<doc id="1171033" wikidata="Q1457823" url="?curid=1171033" title="Plumbers Don't Wear Ties">
<text>Plumbers Don&#x27;t Wear Ties is an adult-oriented &quot;romantic comedy&quot; video game developed by United Pixtures and published by Kirin Entertainment in September 1994 for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer. Although the game did have a Microsoft Windows version in 1993, it had very limited distribution and was published by United Pixtures itself. The game stars Edward J. Foster and Jeanne Basone as John and Jane, two people who are being pressured by their respective parents to go out and find a spouse. The player&#x27;s task is to get John and Jane together.

&quot;Plumbers Don&#x27;t Wear Ties&quot; received overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics for its lackluster production value, nonsensical storyline, poor acting and humor, and for primarily being presented as a slideshow despite being advertised as a full motion video game. The game is considered one of the worst video games of all time.

At E3 2021, a re-release of the game for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S was announced by Limited Run Games, which was released in March 2024.

==Gameplay==
The only interaction is where the player gets to choose the storyline (two to three choices at a time) in a DVD menu-style manner, although there are only one to two right choices. The player will use the D-pad (or mouse in the PC version) to make a choice and then will press the A button to see what will happen for choosing that option. At certain points in the game, the player has the opportunity to choose what actions John or Jane will do; making the right choices will bring the characters together while making the wrong choices will result in commentary from the game&#x27;s two narrators, who sometimes fight with each other. If enough bad choices are made, the player is given the choice to restart the game or try to make the right choice.

==Plot==
A full motion video clip features the character Jane introducing the player to the main objective and basic rules of the game. From that point onwards the entire format is that of still photographs with actors reading the dialogue. The narrator also changes once during the game, before being changed back to the original a few scenes later.

In the early 1990s, Los Angeles locals John (Edward J. Foster) and Jane (Jeanne Basone), are both being pressured by their respective parents to find a suitable spouse. John, a plumber, is told by his mother (Violetta Gevorkian, voiced by Samantha Eggersoll) to go to her house with the girl she had set a date up with, Amy, for dinner at 6:00 pm. College student Jane, meanwhile, who is considered a &quot;daddy&#x27;s girl&quot;, is going to a job interview, having disliked her coworkers at her previous job.

John and Jane both meet in a parking lot by 8:00 AM and John instantly falls in love with Jane, calling her &quot;perfect&quot;. John decides not to go to work and stays in the parking lot to wait for Jane to leave from her job interview so he can meet Jane again, thinking it is more important than his job, possibly due to the fact his mother&#x27;s wanting of a spouse for him. Around this time, it is revealed that the game is narrated by Harry Armis (who also played Jane&#x27;s father).

When Jane is at the interview, her prospective boss, Paul Mark Thresher (Paul Bokor), tells her that, despite her outstanding qualifications and recommendations, her position was canceled an hour before. When Jane gets very upset about this, Thresher says that &quot;something can be worked out, after all,&quot; and asks her to take her clothes off, which appears to be an attempt to lead Jane to have sex with him to get a job. However, when Jane refuses, Thresher attempts to rape her, and eventually, Jane (still partially undressed) runs away from him. John sees Thresher chasing Jane and dashes off to save her. After a long chase sequence through the streets of Los Angeles, the three find themselves in an abandoned building. Around this time, Harry Armis is replaced by a female narrator named Wilma (Thyra Metz). Later, she is shot multiple times by Armis, who then returns as narrator.

After the chase, Thresher offers to pay Jane $5 million for sex. Jane refuses after John confesses his feelings for her. John and Jane both walk out of the house with Thresher having a date with somebody else (Samantha Eggersoll) as a consolation to lose Jane to John, and asking to call the police, while John and Jane return to the parking lot where they first met.

As a reward for being honorable, Jane decides to treat John to dinner and they travel to her place on John&#x27;s bike. While he attempts to tell her that his profession is that of a plumber, Jane believes he is joking, then replies, &quot;Plumbers don&#x27;t wear ties.&quot;

Bad endings include the following:

* If John doesn&#x27;t chase after Thresher in the parking lot, Thresher will seduce John, and the two will suddenly become a couple before the game tells the player that they should try again.
* If Jane accepts Thresher&#x27;s offer of money, John is forced into marrying Amy and having 3 kids to please his mother, and Jane becomes a prostitute.
* If &quot;Gimme Something Completely Different&quot; is selected after Thresher is dealt with, Jane confesses to John that she is still a virgin and plans to become a nun, much to John&#x27;s surprise. After failing to talk her out of it, John is forced to return home to have dinner with his mother, who arranges a shotgun wedding between him and Amy.

==Development==
&quot;Plumbers Don&#x27;t Wear Ties&quot; was published by Fremont, California-based game company Kirin Entertainment, a subsidiary of Digital Stuff Inc. It was developed and produced by Michael Anderson. The musical score was provided by Martin Golnick and the Audio Micro music production library.

==Release==
The Windows version of the game was released before the 3DO version; however, due to a limited number of copies being made, it faded into obscurity. In 2017, a user looking to test an old laptop discovered a listing for the PC version of the game, and after searching through WorldCat, discovered one copy at the Ball State University library. Through Reddit, users were able to obtain the game and made a version emulated through DOSBox for users to try, then later uploaded . In comparison to the 3DO version, the Windows version of the game features higher-quality audio than the 3DO version and uncensored cutscenes without the use of a code.

Limited Run Games announced during E3 2021 that they would be porting the game to the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5 and Microsoft Windows, with both digital and physical releases. It was announced to be released in 2022. On July 12, 2023, Limited Run Games announced a release date of September 2023. Preorders for the physical release of the game opened on September 22, 2023, with the digital release of the game releasing on March 5, 2024. The new release includes additional features such as save states, an in-game gallery, documentary footage, and a dungeon crawler mode through which the player unlocks bonus content. Limited Run Games also released a novelization of the game, written by Mike Drucker.

==Reception==

Though the game was an obscure title due to the 3DO format, it gained attention through James Rolfe&#x27;s coverage of it as part of his &quot;Angry Video Game Nerd&quot; series in 2009 (episode 74).

&quot;Plumbers Don&#x27;t Wear Ties&quot; is widely considered to be one of the worst games of all time. It received negative attention mainly due to much of the game being presented as a slideshow despite being advertised as a full motion video game (only its introduction was FMV) where it uses mostly still images instead of full motion graphics as well as random, out-of-place color filters. Other criticisms focused on its &quot;surreal&quot; storyline and poor voice acting. It has been also cited as one of the primary reasons for the commercial failure of the 3DO game system.

In giving the game a 15% rating, Diego Antico wrote: &quot;It&#x27;s hard to determine where &quot;Plumbers Don&#x27;t Wear Ties&quot; is at its most horrendous. Is it in the pathetic music department? The graphics (or its lack thereof)? The awful gameplay?&quot; Allgame gave the game one star. The site made note of how despite it being advertised as a full motion video, the game was simply a slideshow. &quot;Video Games &amp; Computer Entertainment&quot; magazine criticized the game for being all just &quot;still pictures of the director&#x27;s friends acting like goofballs and delivering bad voiceovers&quot;, also stating: &quot;Not even the promise of some naked pictures could save this disc from becoming a joke around here. Avoid this one at all costs, it looks like a bad Public Access show and that&#x27;s the pits.&quot; &quot;PC Gamer&quot;, giving the game a 3%, said that the game was funny for only 30 seconds, calling the game an &quot;irksome and yobbishly executed pseudo-pornographic photo story with the wit and charm of an elephant&#x27;s arse&quot;. &quot;PC Format&quot; rated the game a 4%, the lowest rating the magazine had ever given to a video game.

In 1997, &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; listed &quot;Plumbers Don&#x27;t Wear Ties&quot; as the fourth worst console video game of all time. &quot;PC Gamer&quot; dubbed it a &quot;shallow, hateful waste of a game, [that] may very well be responsible for having killed the 3DO, interactive fiction, and the whale&quot;, naming it #1 on its &quot;Must NOT Buy&quot; list in May 2007. It was #27 in UGO Network&#x27;s 102 &quot;Worst Video Games of All Time&quot;, concluding &quot;If you have the patience, check out a video walkthrough online of either the worst storyline in gaming history, or a post-modern masterpiece&quot;, and #4 in Screen Play&#x27;s, calling the game a &quot;hilariously dodgy FMV adventure with actors who make &quot;Home and Away&quot; look like Shakespeare&quot;. The game was put in &quot;411mania.com&quot;″s 2008 &quot;Hall of Shame&quot;, with writer Vincent Chiucchi stating &quot;By Jove, this could very well be the worst game ever!&quot; It was included among the worst games of all time by &quot;GamesRadar&quot; in 2014.

The game&#x27;s cover art was one of &quot;1UP.com&quot;″s &quot;Worst Videogame Box Covers&quot;, criticizing its use of clip art and fonts. &quot;IGN&quot; has cited &quot;Plumbers Don&#x27;t Wear Ties&quot; as &quot;a symbol for everything that was wrong with giving a license to anyone that wanted one&quot;, referring to the fact that 3DO publishers only needed to pay a $3 royalty per disc and did not have to join a stringent licensing program like other game consoles, which led to many low-quality adult-oriented video games being released for the system.

<doc id="1171036" wikidata="Q1050436" url="?curid=1171036" title="Business judgment rule">
<text>The business judgment rule is a case-law-derived doctrine in corporations law that courts defer to the business judgment of corporate executives. It is rooted in the principle that the &quot;directors of a corporation ... are clothed with [the] presumption, which the law accords to them, of being [motivated] in their conduct by a bona fides regard for the interests of the corporation whose affairs the stockholders have committed to their charge.&quot; The rule exists in some form in most common law countries, including the United States, Canada, England and Wales, and Australia.

To challenge the actions of a corporation&#x27;s board of directors, a plaintiff assumes &quot;the burden of providing evidence that directors, in reaching their challenged decision, breached any one of the triads of their fiduciary duty — good faith, loyalty, or due care.&quot; Failing to do so, a plaintiff &quot;is not entitled to any remedy unless the transaction constitutes waste ... [that is,] the exchange was so one-sided that no business person of ordinary, sound judgment could conclude that the corporation has received adequate consideration.&quot;

== Basis ==
Given that the directors cannot ensure corporate success, the business judgment rule specifies that the court will not review the business decisions of directors who performed their duties (1) in good faith; (2) with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances; and (3) in a manner the directors reasonably believe to be in the best interests of the corporation. As part of their duty of care, directors have a duty not to waste corporate assets by overpaying for property or employment services. The business judgment rule is very difficult to overcome and courts will not interfere with directors unless it is clear that they are guilty of fraud or misappropriation of the corporate funds, etc.

In effect, the business judgment rule creates a strong presumption in favor of the board of directors of a corporation, freeing its members from possible liability for decisions that result in harm to the corporation. The presumption is that &quot;in making business decisions not involving direct self-interest or self-dealing, corporate directors act on an informed basis, in good faith, and in the honest belief that their actions are in the corporation&#x27;s best interest.&quot; In short, it exists so that a board will not suffer legal action simply from a bad decision. As the Delaware Supreme Court has said, a court &quot;will not substitute its own notions of what is or is not sound business judgment&quot; if &quot;the directors of a corporation acted on an informed basis, in good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the company.&quot;

==Duty of care and duty of loyalty==

Although a distinct common law concept from duty of care, duty of loyalty is often evaluated by courts in certain cases dealing with violations by the board. While the business judgment rule is historically linked particularly to the duty of care standard of conduct, shareholders who sue the directors often charge both the duty of care and duty of loyalty violations. 

This forced the courts to evaluate duty of care (employing the business judgment rule standard of review) together with duty of loyalty violations that involve self-interest violations (as opposed to gross incompetence with duty of care). Violations of the duty of care are reviewed under a gross negligence standard, as opposed to simple negligence. 

Consequently, over time, one of the points of review that has entered the business judgment rule was the prohibition against self-interest transactions. Conflicting interest transactions occur when a director, who has a conflicting interest with respect to a transaction, knows that she or a related person is (1) a party to the transaction; (2) has a beneficial financial interest in, or closely linked to, the transaction that the interest would reasonably be expected to influence the director&#x27;s judgment if she were to vote on the transaction; or (3) is a director, general partner, agent, or employee of another entity with whom the corporation is transacting business and the transaction is of such importance to the corporation that it would in the normal course of business be brought before the board.

==Standard of review==
The following test was constructed in the opinion for &quot;Grobow v. Perot&quot;, 539 A.2d 180 (Del. 1988), as a guideline for satisfaction of the business judgment rule. Directors in a business should:
*act in good faith;
*act in the best interests of the corporation;
*act on an informed basis;
*not be wasteful;
*not involve self-interest (duty of loyalty concept plays a role here).

==Rationale==
Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, the business judgment rule is the offspring of the fundamental principle, codified in Del. Code Ann. tit. 8, § 141(a), that the business and affairs of a Delaware corporation are managed by or under its board of directors. In carrying out their managerial roles, directors are charged with an unyielding fiduciary duty to the corporation. The rationale for the rule is the recognition by courts that, in the inherently risky environment of business, Boards of Directors need to be free to take risks without a constant fear of lawsuits affecting their judgment.

The presumption raised by the business judgement rule may be rebutted by the plaintiff. &quot;The business judgment rule is a presumption that in making a business decision, the directors of a corporation acted on an informed basis, in good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the company. Thus, the party attacking a board decision as uninformed must rebut the presumption that its business judgment was an informed one.&quot; Further, rebuttal typically requires a showing that the defendants violated duty of care or loyalty (with courts assuming director&#x27;s good faith otherwise). 

If the plaintiff can show that an action should not be protected by the business judgment rule (such as when a director decides to give over a certain percentage of the company&#x27;s profits to charity (duty of care violation) or lines his/her own pockets with company&#x27;s money (self-interest/duty of loyalty violation)), then the burden will shift to the defendant to show that the action meets the burden of good faith/rational decision. In many cases, it is relatively easy for a director to find some rational reason for his actions and, with the courts using the business judgment rule, the case will likely be dismissed (U.S. courts disdain getting involved in business matters). All directors must have the option of vetoing the decision.

Frequently, the winning cases for plaintiffs involving the business judgment rule involve acts constituting corporate waste. Also, note that some Board decisions lie outside the business judgment rule. For instance, in the takeover context, courts will apply the more stringent &quot;Unocal&quot; test, also called intermediate scrutiny. Illegal decisions are also not protected by the business judgment rule. 

One of the earliest cases, &quot;Dodge v. Ford Motor Co.&quot;, ruled, for example, that &quot;courts of equity will not interfere in the management of the directors unless it is clearly made to appear that they are guilty of fraud or misappropriation of the corporate funds, or refuse to declare a dividend when the corporation has a surplus of net profits which it can, without detriment to its business, divide among its stockholders, and when a refusal to do so would amount to such an abuse of discretion as would constitute a fraud, or breach of that good faith which they are bound to exercise towards the stockholders.&quot;

<doc id="1171040" wikidata="Q2986412" url="?curid=1171040" title="Canadian Dairy Commission">
<text>The Canadian Dairy Commission (CDC) () is an Ottawa-based Government of Canada Crown Corporation that provides a framework for managing Canada&#x27;s dairy industry.

The CDC&#x27;s mandate is to &quot;ensure fair compensation to producers and provide consumers with access to a quality product.&quot;

Canada&#x27;s dairy industry operates under a supply management system, so among the most important roles of the CDC are to plan national production (including by the allocation of producer milk quotas), to set farmgate milk prices, and to control dairy imports.
The CDC also coordinates federal and provincial dairy policies.
==History==
The Canadian federal government has been active in supporting the dairy industry since 1890, when the first Dominion Dairy Commissioner was appointed.

In 1967 the government of Canada passed the &quot;Canadian Dairy Commission Act&quot; which established the Canadian Dairy Commission (CDC).

The Canadian Milk Supply Management Committee, whose members include the CDC and representatives of provincial producer marketing boards, was set up in 1970 to administer the national Market Sharing Quota.
In 1972, the &quot;Farm Products Agencies Act&quot; authorized the establishment of supply management, which can restrict production by use of quotas.
==Mandate, implementation, and administration==
The CDC&#x27;s mandate is to &quot;Provide efficient producers of milk and cream with the opportunity to obtain a fair return for their labour and investment&quot; and to &quot;Provide consumers of dairy products with a continuous and adequate supply of dairy products of high quality.&quot;
The CDC aims to avoid depending on government subsidies and the dumping of surpluses into third markets.

To achieve its mandate to ensure efficient producers receive a sufficient return, the CDC (working with provincial marketing boards) sets a &quot;support price&quot; for milk producers. This support price is high enough that some domestic and foreign producers are willing to supply dairy products at a lower price. Therefore, to prevent this additional supply from reaching the market, the CDC uses supply management. That is, it issues a limited quantity of quotas, which are a type of licence authorizing the quota-holder to sell a given volume of dairy products.
By restricting domestic supply and imports, the support price is maintained.

===How the support price is determined===
The CDC sets support prices for milk components (butterfat and skim milk). 
Provincial marketing boards use the CDC-determined price as a benchmark to set prices in each province.

Milk support prices are changed typically once a year using a formula determined by the industry.
The price adjustment formula is based on the cost of milk production, as determined by a randomized and anonymous survey of roughly 200 farms.
The CDC formula includes cash costs, capital costs, and labour costs, but does not include the cost to purchase milk production quota.

In determining the support price, the CDC consults producers, processors, restauranteurs, retailers, and consumers.
The CDC can set aside the formula in &quot;exceptional circumstances,&quot; which, as of 2022, it had done four times since 2017.
Exceptional circumstances criteria include if there is an unexpected event, which may arise given the lags in implementing price changes. (The price adjustment for 1 February 2022 was calculated in the fall of 2021 using 2020 data.)

The CDC regulates only the price of milk received by farmers, however, some provinces (such as Quebec) regulate the retail price of fluid milk.

===Other roles===
The CDC monitors production and demand for milk, and it adjusts the national milk production target as necessary.
When production exceeds demand, the CDC oversees the removal from the market of surplus butter and skim milk powder for export or later sale.

The CDC promotes consumer awareness and programs to stimulate demand for Canadian dairy products.
In collaboration with the private sector, the CDC monitors the seasonal domestic supply of milk to maintain a balance between supply and demand.

==Issues and debates==
===Governance===
Sylvain Charlebois, professor of food distribution and policy and the director of the Agri-Food Analytics Lab at Dalhousie University, expressed concern that the CDC, &quot;owned by all Canadians, is controlled by three people, all with dairy connections. Processors, retailers and, most importantly, consumers, are not represented.&quot;
Restaurants Canada has long asked for a seat on the CDC board.

===Transparency===
Calls to improve communication and increase transparency surrounding CDC activities were made by Restaurants Canada, the Retail Council of Canada, the Dairy Processors of Canada, and the Minister of Agriculture when the CDC initially refused to release data on employee bonuses.
These calls were prompted when the CDC received $4.7 million from taxpayers in 2020-21, a 21% increase from $3.9 million the previous year, which it used to fund &quot;increased salary expenses.&quot; 
Perhaps in response to public pressure, in 2022 the CDC was more open when it made a thorough presentation and responded to media questions alongside its annual price hike announcement. (In previous years it simply posted an abstract on its website announcing the price increase).

In 2023 and 2024, the CDC was urged to provide more transparency on the extent of &quot;milk dumping,&quot; a method used by some Canadian producers to dispose of over-quota milk supply. 
Between 2012 and 2021, the Canadian dairy industry discarded on farms an estimated 7% of all milk produced (over 6.8 billion liters of raw milk, valued at $6.7 billion).

===Product quality===
Although Canadians pay high dairy prices, quality is not assured according to Dalhousie University professor Sylvain Charlebois. He pointed to Buttergate which revealed the practice of feeding cows with palmatite, an imported palm oil derivative, which affects butter&#x27;s hardness.

===Milk price setting formula===
After a 8.4% milk price increase in 2022 – the largest since the CDC was created in 1967 – a C.D. Howe Institute commentary said not only are such large price rises undesirable for consumers, but they could be detrimental to the dairy industry if they lead to more illegal milk entering the market from the United States.
The study said the CDC&#x27;s price setting formula would benefit from having an external competent review.

===Impact on family farms===
The CDC uses quotas to limit the supply of milk entering the market, so the value of milk quota licences is high. The high cost of quotas means that it has become difficult for younger people to enter the industry.
(The quota price was capped in 2010 in Ontario and Quebec at $25,000 per kilogram of butterfat per day – which is approximately the production of one cow. However, the price reached $58,000 in Alberta in 2022. The estimated national total quota was valued at $32.6 billion in 2014.)
As a consequence, newspaper columnist Andrew Coyne says CDC policy was enacted &quot;in the name of saving the family farm&quot; but it has instead &quot;led to its near extinction.&quot;
The number of dairy farms in Canada in 2024 was approximately 9,000, compared to more than 145,000 when the CDC was established in the early 1970s.
===The consumer cost of dairy products=== 
The CDC limits the supply of milk entering the market, which keeps the price to consumers among the most expensive in the Western world. 

Milk farmers are required to participate in the supply management price-fixing system, an arrangement that would be illegal in almost any other sector of the Canadian economy (the Competition Bureau in 2018 brought a case against retailers for fixing the price of bread).

Also, the high cost has a disproportionate impact on low-income Canadians, since a greater proportion of their incomes are spent on dairy products.

==Change of era==
* 1278 : The new era name was created to mark an event or a number of events. The previous era ended and a new one commenced in &quot;Kenji&quot; 4. The era name comes from the &quot;Veritable Records of the Emperor Taizong of Tang&quot; and combines the characters (&quot;broad&quot;) and (&quot;peaceful&quot;). It should not be confused with the later Kōan era of 1361–62, which used a different character for &quot;kō&quot; (, &quot;peace&quot;).

==Events of the &quot;Kōan&quot; era==
* August 15, 1281 (&quot;Kōan 4, 7th day of the intercalary 7th month&quot;): Battle of Kōan -- The second Mongol invasion of Japan is foiled, as a large typhoon – famously called a &quot;kamikaze&quot;, or divine wind – destroys much of the combined Chinese and Korean fleet and forces, numbering over 140,000 men and 4,000 ships.
* November 27, 1287 (&quot;Kōan 10, 21st day of the 10th month&quot;): In the 14th year of Go-Uda&quot;-tennō&quot;″s reign (後宇多天皇14年), the emperor abdicated; and the succession (‘‘senso’’) was received by his cousin. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Fushimi is said to have acceded to the throne (‘‘sokui’’).

<text>High-energy nuclear physics studies the behavior of nuclear matter in energy regimes typical of high-energy physics. The primary focus of this field is the study of heavy-ion collisions, as compared to lighter atoms in other particle accelerators. At sufficient collision energies, these types of collisions are theorized to produce the quark–gluon plasma. In peripheral nuclear collisions at high energies one expects to obtain information on the electromagnetic production of leptons and mesons that are not accessible in electron–positron colliders due to their much smaller luminosities.

Previous high-energy nuclear accelerator experiments have studied heavy-ion collisions using projectile energies of 1 GeV/nucleon at JINR and LBNL-Bevalac up to 158 GeV/nucleon at CERN-SPS. Experiments of this type, called &quot;fixed-target&quot; experiments, primarily accelerate a &quot;bunch&quot; of ions (typically around 106 to 108 ions per bunch) to speeds approaching the speed of light (0.999&quot;c&quot;) and smash them into a target of similar heavy ions. While all collision systems are interesting, great focus was applied in the late 1990s to symmetric collision systems of gold beams on gold targets at Brookhaven National Laboratory&#x27;s Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) and uranium beams on uranium targets at CERN&#x27;s Super Proton Synchrotron.

High-energy nuclear physics experiments are continued at the Brookhaven National Laboratory&#x27;s Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. At RHIC the programme began with four experiments— PHENIX, STAR, PHOBOS, and BRAHMS—all dedicated to study collisions of highly relativistic nuclei. Unlike fixed-target experiments, collider experiments steer two accelerated beams of ions toward each other at (in the case of RHIC) six interaction regions. At RHIC, ions can be accelerated (depending on the ion size) from 100 GeV/nucleon to 250 GeV/nucleon. Since each colliding ion possesses this energy moving in opposite directions, the maximal energy of the collisions can achieve a center-of-mass collision energy of 200 GeV/nucleon for gold and 500 GeV/nucleon for protons.

The (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) detector at the LHC at CERN is specialized in studying Pb–Pb nuclei collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 2.76 TeV per nucleon pair. All major LHC detectors—ALICE, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb—participate in the heavy-ion programme.

==History==
The exploration of hot hadron matter and of multiparticle production has a long history initiated by theoretical work on multiparticle production by Enrico Fermi in the US and Lev Landau in the USSR. These efforts paved the way to the development in the early 1960s of the thermal description of multiparticle production and the statistical bootstrap model by Rolf Hagedorn. These developments led to search for and discovery of quark-gluon plasma. Onset of the production of this new form of matter remains under active investigation.

===First collisions===
The first heavy-ion collisions at modestly relativistic conditions were undertaken at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL, formerly LBL) at Berkeley, California, U.S.A., and at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, Moscow Oblast, USSR. At the LBL, a transport line was built to carry heavy ions from the heavy-ion accelerator HILAC to the Bevatron. The energy scale at the level of 1–2 GeV per nucleon attained initially yields compressed nuclear matter at few times normal nuclear density. The demonstration of the possibility of studying the properties of compressed and excited nuclear matter motivated research programs at much higher energies in accelerators available at BNL and CERN with relativist beams targeting laboratory fixed targets. The first collider experiments started in 1999 at RHIC, and LHC begun colliding heavy ions at one order of magnitude higher energy in 2010.

==CERN operation==
The LHC collider at CERN operates one month a year in the nuclear-collision mode, with Pb nuclei colliding at 2.76 TeV per nucleon pair, about 1500 times the energy equivalent of the rest mass. Overall 1250 valence quarks collide, generating a hot quark–gluon soup. Heavy atomic nuclei stripped of their electron cloud are called heavy ions, and one speaks of (ultra)relativistic heavy ions when the kinetic energy exceeds significantly the rest energy, as it is the case at LHC. The outcome of such collisions is production of very many strongly interacting particles.

In August 2012 ALICE scientists announced that their experiments produced quark–gluon plasma with temperature at around 5.5 trillion kelvins, the highest temperature achieved in any physical experiments thus far. This temperature is about 38% higher than the previous record of about 4 trillion kelvins, achieved in the 2010 experiments at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. The ALICE results were announced at the August 13 &quot;Quark Matter 2012&quot; conference in Washington, D.C. The quark–gluon plasma produced by these experiments approximates the conditions in the universe that existed microseconds after the Big Bang, before the matter coalesced into atoms.

==Objectives==
There are several scientific objectives of this international research program:
* The formation and investigation of a new state of matter made of quarks and gluons, the quark–gluon plasma QGP, which prevailed in early universe in first 30 microseconds.
* The study of color confinement and the transformation of color confining = quark confining vacuum state to the excited state physicists call perturbative vacuum, in which quarks and gluons can roam free, which occurs at Hagedorn temperature;
* The study the origins of hadron (proton, neutron etc.) matter mass believed to be related to the phenomenon of quark confinement and vacuum structure.

==Experimental program==
This experimental program follows on a decade of research at the RHIC collider at BNL and almost two decades of studies using fixed targets at SPS at CERN and AGS at BNL. This experimental program has already confirmed that the extreme conditions of matter necessary to reach QGP phase can be reached. A typical temperature range achieved in the QGP created
:formula_1
is more than times greater than in the center of the Sun. This corresponds to an energy density 
:formula_2.
The corresponding relativistic-matter pressure is
: formula_3

<text>Mindy Newell (born October 24, 1953) is an American comic book writer and editor, best known for her work with DC Comics.

== Early life ==
Born in Brooklyn, New York, Newell graduated from high school in 1971. She then attended the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center to study nursing. Following her nursing schooling, Newell enrolled at Quinnipiac University and studied biology while working as a nurse.

==Biography==
A longtime fan of comics, particularly of Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man, Mindy Newell sent submissions to DC Comics in 1983 at a time when the company was actively looking for new talent. Her first professional work was her creation of the character Jenesis, which appeared in three issues of &quot;New Talent Showcase&quot;. Editor Karen Berger called her in for an interview four days after DC received her submission.

Hired by editors Dick Giordano and Karen Berger, Newell wrote fill-in issues for &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; and &quot;Action Comics&quot;. While working as part of the new talent program, Newell became the writer of &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;. She was the first credited woman to write the &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; series in an ongoing capacity but was limited in what she could write due to editorial mandates. In 1986, Newell and artist Gray Morrow collaborated on a &quot;Lois Lane&quot; limited series which dealt with the subject of missing children. In addition, Newell wrote &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; and &quot;Her Sister&#x27;s Keeper,&quot; a seminal &quot;Catwoman&quot; limited series. Newell also briefly worked on First Comics&#x27;s &quot;American Flagg&quot; and Eclipse Comics&#x27;s &quot;The New Wave&quot;.

Newell has always maintained a career as a nurse while writing comics, and has since returned to that occupation full-time.

== Personal life ==
Newell is a full-time nurse and mother, while still contributing to comics and other projects. Her former husband, John Higgins, is a British comic book writer, illustrator, and letterer.

<text>Frank Enrico Pastore (; August 21, 1957 – December 17, 2012) was an American Major League Baseball player and radio host. He pitched for the Cincinnati Reds from 1979 until 1985 and for the Minnesota Twins in 1986, and was in the Texas Rangers organization in 1987.

==Playing career==
Pastore was born in Alhambra, California, and was valedictorian of the 1975 class of Damien High School in La Verne, California. That year, Pastore went to the Cincinnati Reds in the second round of the amateur draft. Pastore continued to be promoted within the organization, with an impressive 3.28 ERA in the minor leagues. He made his major league debut on April 4, 1979, at Riverfront Stadium, pitching three scoreless innings in a loss to the San Francisco Giants. Used equally as a reliever and starter during his rookie season, he then moved full-time to the starting rotation in 1980.

Pastore&#x27;s best statistical season came in 1980 with the Reds, as he posted a record of 13 - 7 with an ERA of 3.27 in 27 appearances. Pastore was hit on the elbow with a batted ball on June 4, 1984. That injury caused him to appear in only 41 games in the 1984 and 1985 seasons combined. He was then released by the Reds in 1986 following spring training. However, Pastore quickly signed with the Minnesota Twins, and spent the entire season coming out of the bullpen. Following the season, he signed with the Texas Rangers and was assigned to the AAA Oklahoma City 89ers. However, Pastore started four disappointing games with the team (compiling a 1–3 record and 8.46 ERA) before retiring.

==Later life==

After baseball, Pastore went back to school, graduating with a degree in business administration from National University in 1989. He then spent the next two years with the national leadership of Athletes in Action, the sports ministry of Campus Crusade for Christ. He then attended the Talbot School of Theology at Biola University, graduating &quot;summa cum laude&quot; with an MA in philosophy of religion and ethics in 1994. In 2003, Pastore completed his second master&#x27;s degree, in political philosophy and American government, from Claremont Graduate School.

On January 5, 2004, Pastore became the host of &quot;The Frank Pastore Show&quot; on KKLA-FM in Los Angeles, which became one of the largest Christian talk shows in the United States.

In 2011, Pastore authored &quot;Shattered: Struck Down, But Not Destroyed&quot;, a book recounting how he became a born-again Christian during recovery from his 1984 pitching arm injury.

Pastore once held the record for the fastest time to finish eating the famous 72-oz steak dinner, &quot;The Texas King&quot;, at the Big Texan Steak Ranch. Pastore&#x27;s record of 9 minutes 30 seconds stood for 21 years, until being broken by Joey Chestnut in 2008.

==Death==

On November 19, 2012, during his radio show while discussing how his faith affects his view of death, Pastore said:

You guys know I ride a motorcycle, don’t you? So, at any moment, especially with the idiot people who cross the diamond lane into my lane, all right, without any blinkers -- not that I’m angry about it, but at any minute I could be spread out all over the 210 [Freeway].
That same day, he was critically injured on the Foothill (210) Freeway in Duarte, California, when a woman from Glendora, California, driving a Hyundai Sonata, collided with his Honda VTX 1800, throwing him off the motorcycle. He was hospitalized in critical condition with serious head injuries.

Less than a month later, on December 17, 2012, Pastore died from pneumonia and other complications of his injuries. Pastore was survived by his wife, Gina, children Frank Jr. and Christina, and one grandchild.

<text>Arthur Phillips (September 12, 1930 – March 29, 2013) served as the 32nd mayor of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada from 1973 to 1977. Prior to being elected to this post, he founded the Vancouver investment firm of Phillips, Hager &amp; North. Phillips was instrumental in founding a reform-minded, centrist municipal-level political party, TEAM (The Electors&#x27; Action Movement), in 1968. Also in that year, he was elected as an alderman to Vancouver City Council.

Under Phillips&#x27; mayoral leadership, the city of Vancouver took a more cautious approach to real estate and related development and ensured that environmental and quality-of-life concerns were addressed by city planners.

Phillips was elected to the Parliament of Canada in 1979 as a Liberal, but was defeated the following year in his bid for re-election. After Phillips&#x27; defeat, he returned to private life at his investment firm. By 2007, Phillips, Hager &amp; North had become a leading investment firm on the west coast, with over $66 billion of assets under management.

His wife, Carole Taylor, served as a Vancouver alderman in the 1980s and then as chair of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. In the 2005 British Columbia election she won election to the British Columbia Legislative Assembly as a Liberal and was subsequently appointed Minister of Finance in Gordon Campbell&#x27;s cabinet.

During his undergraduate years at the University of British Columbia (B.Com., 1953), Phillips was a member of the British Columbia Alpha chapter of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity and was their chapter President in 1950.

<text>Southern Heritage Festival was a two-day music, arts, and culture festival dedicated to the African American population of Birmingham, Alabama. It was held from 2004 to 2006. The festival took place on the site of the future Railroad Reservation Park along Birmingham&#x27;s &quot;Railroad Reservation&quot; corridor on the first weekend of August. Music styles include hip hop, Old school hip hop, classic R&amp;B, and Gospel.

== History ==
The Southern Heritage Festival originally began in the 1960s, but ceased to exist by the early 1990s. It was replaced by the now-defunct Birmingham Heritage Festival, which was basically an all-music festival that targeted mostly younger audiences. But in July 2004 the Southern Heritage Festival was revived and given a second chance, with a new name, The Original Southern Heritage Festival, by John Ray, the festival&#x27;s original organizer.

In 2004 the event was held at the Alabama State Fairgrounds () , but attendance was disappointing. In 2005 the event was moved to Kelly Ingram Park () in Birmingham&#x27;s Civil Rights District. The 2006 festival was planned for the Railroad Reservation site used successfully by the Schaeffer Eye Center Crawfish Boil. 2006 performers included Patti LaBelle, Buddy Guy, Koko Taylor, Bobby &quot;Blue&quot; Bland, Clarence Carter, and the Little Memphis Blues Orchestra.

<text>The Canadian Grain Commission (CGC; ) is an agency of the Canadian government responsible for regulation of the grain-handling industry in Canada, as well as to protect producers&#x27; rights and ensure the integrity of grain transactions.

==Overview==
The Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food is responsible for the Canadian Grain Commission. The Commission is governed by the Canada Grain Act (R.S.C. 1985, c. G-10), which provides for the appointment of three commissioners by the federal cabinet, one of whom is named chief commissioner. The CGC is headed by a Chief Operating Officer (COO), who reports to the chief commissioner.

Its headquarters are located in Winnipeg, Manitoba. As of 2013, the commission has two regional offices which provide a full range of inspection, weighing, analytical, and entomology services, namely, Montreal and Vancouver.

The function of the CGC is, among other things, to
*

== History ==
In 1971, the Canadian Grain Commission replaced the Board of Grain Commissioners for Canada, which was created in 1912 by the Conservative government of Robert Borden. Even then it was colloquially known as the &quot;Canadian grain commission&quot;.

The 1912 legislation provided &quot;that all owners and operators of elevators, warehouses and mills and certain traders in grain, shall be licensed; for supervision of the handling and storage of grain in and out of elevators, etc.; and prohibits persons operating or interested in a terminal elevator from buying or selling grain. It contains, also, provisions for inspection and grading.&quot;

In 1922, the Davies court ruled that the criminal provisions of the CGA fell without the ambit of the &quot;in any case whatever&quot; section 36 provisions of the &quot;Supreme Court Act&quot; of 1906, and that therefore the legislators could and did draw up a statute which limited the power of the Supreme Court of Canada (SCC). The defendant, a Manitoba elevator, was convicted for selling grain on commission without a licence, in contravention of section 215 of the &quot;Canada Grain Act&quot; of 1912. His conviction was quashed by the Court of Appeal, which held section 215 of the &quot;Grain Act&quot; to be ultra vires of the Dominion Parliament, and the prosecution was handcuffed by the concurrence of highest court.

In 1925, the power of the Federal government to enact a tax policy whereby &#x27;if at the end of any crop year in any terminal elevator &quot;the total surplus of grain is found in excess of one-quarter of one per cent of the gross amount of the grain received in the elevator during the crop year&quot; such surplus shall be sold for the benefit of the Board&#x27; was denied by the Anglin court of the SCC. They ruled that the federal government had encroached into provincial jurisdiction.

In 1971 and in the era of the Canadian Wheat Board (CWB), the power of the federal government to declare a private grain elevator works constructed after the passage of the legislation as &quot;works for the general advantage of Canada&quot;, thus gathering them under its control under section 92.10.c of the &quot;BNA Act&quot;, was contested in the Supreme Court. The Fauteux court ruled it be intra vires.

In 1975, a private rapeseed elevator was declared by the Laskin court to be a &quot;grain elevator&quot; and thus under the control of the CGC and CWB.

In 1980, the defendant corporation in a case of illicentious sale of grain contended in front of the Laskin court that its employee, the manager of a grain elevator, could not be compelled to testify against it by virtue of an extension of the right to silence. It failed and a trial de novo was ordered. The court held, &quot;grosso modo&quot;, that the employee was not bound to the body corporate to such an extent, and the doctrines about self-incrimination did not apply.

==Building==

===Architecture===

Ernest J. Smith of Smith Carter was the principal architect of the Grain Commission&#x27;s current headquarters, nicknamed the &quot;mushroom building&quot;, the structure itself is a notable example of a Canadian skyscraper displaying Brutalist elements. The building&#x27;s &quot;extended cap&quot; was designed because of a space needed between the upper and lower floors for specialized mechanical equipment used to transport grain to an upper-level flour mill and test brewery. Smith remarked on the challenges involved:Mixing two different functions in a vertical building is difficult. Normally construction would be separated horizontally. In this case, we worked out two separate modules for offices and lab space, [and] found we needed greater depth in the lab and rationalised the present form.

===Sculpture in the forecourt===

In 1976, John Cullen Nugent&#x27;s &quot;No. 1 Northern&quot;, a large steel abstract sculpture was unveiled, a work intended to be a metaphor for fields of wheat, represented in multi-layer rectangular shapes and painted the &quot;brilliant&quot; yellow of harvest wheat, and designed to represent Canada&#x27;s hardy top grade, red spring wheat hybrid of the same name. The work was so disliked by some officials, employees of the Commission, the press, and the public, that it was removed in 1978 over the artist&#x27;s objections and attempts at litigation. In 1997, after a second installation and removal from another federal building in Winnipeg, Nugent&#x27;s sculpture was reinstalled in front of the Grain Commission building.

<text>Plan XVII () was the name of a &quot;scheme of mobilisation and concentration&quot; which the French (the peacetime title of the French ) developed from 1912 to 1914, to be put into effect by the French Army in the event of war between France and Germany. The plan was for the mobilisation, concentration and deployment of the French armies to make possible an invasion either of Germany or of (neutral) Belgium or of both, before Germany completed the mobilisation of its reserves simultaneous with an expected Russian offensive.

The French generals implemented the plan from 7 August 1914, with disastrous consequences for their armies, which suffered defeat in the Battle of the Frontiers at a cost of The French armies (and the British Expeditionary Force) in Belgium and northern France were forced into a retreat as far as the Marne river, where at the First Battle of the Marne the German armies were defeated and forced to retreat to the Aisne river, eventually leading to the Race to the Sea.

==Background==

===Concentration plans 1871–1911===

After the French defeat in the Franco-Prussian War 1870–1871, from 1874–1880, General Raymond Adolphe Séré de Rivières oversaw the construction of the Séré de Rivières system, a line of fortresses long from Belfort to Épinal and another line of similar length from Toul to Verdun, about back from the frontier. The River Meuse flows northwards from Toul to Verdun, Mézières and Givet on the Belgian border and a tributary of the Moselle between Belfort and Épinal, near parallel to the 1871–1919 French-German border. The (Charmes Gap), wide, between Épinal and Toul was left unfortified and the fortress city of Nancy was to the east, from the German frontier. A second series of fortifications, to prevent the main line being outflanked, was built in the south, from Langres to Dijon and in the north from La Fère to Rheims and from Valenciennes to Maubeuge, although for financial reasons these defences were incomplete in 1914.

During the 1870s, the French army drew up concentration plans according to a defensive strategy, which exploited the Meuse and branches of the Moselle parallel to the 1871 border. The completion of the fortress lines between Belfort and Verdun in the late 1880s and railway building from the interior to the border, then gave the French army the means to contemplate a defensive-offensive strategy, in which a German attack would be repulsed and then followed up by a counter-attack. In August 1891, Plan XI was completed, with an option for an offensive as well as a defensive strategy from the start, to exploit the opportunity created by the improvement in relations between the Third Republic and the Russian Empire. The Franco-Russian Alliance led to Plan XII in February 1892, in which an immediate invasion of Germany was considered possible. But from Plan XI to Plan XVI, the strategy remained defensive-offensive, French attacks being expected after the repulse of a German invasion.
In 1888, the French began to study a possible German offensive north of Verdun or through Belgium and Plan XII was written with a contingency for a German breach of Belgian neutrality. In 1904, this was given more attention after a German ( [The Avenger]) sold a copy of the German concentration plan to French intelligence and described mobilisation methods and war plans. Using this windfall and other sources of information, the French adapted Plan XV of 1906, to be ready for a German invasion of Belgium and later plans contained increases in the forces to be assembled to the north and north-east of Verdun. Plan XVI of March 1909, anticipated a German enveloping manoeuvre through Luxembourg and Belgium, after the findings of a 1908 analysis by General Henri de Lacroix, in which he dwelt on the German preference for enveloping manoeuvres and predicted that two German armies would march through eastern Belgium, around the northern flank of the French fortress zone, one to emerge from the Ardennes at Verdun and the other at Sedan. Lacroix wanted to improve the prospects of the usual defensive-offensive strategy by assembling a new Sixth Army near Châlons-sur-Marne, (now Châlons-en-Champagne), west of Verdun, easily to move towards Toul in the centre, Verdun on the left or to the vicinity of Sedan and Mézières behind the northern flank.

==Prelude==

===Concentration plans, 1911–1914===
General Victor-Constant Michel, Vice-President of the in 1910, was more convinced than Lacroix of a German move through Belgium, because of the obstacle of French defences in Lorraine, the terrain in eastern Belgium and German railway building. Michel thought that the Germans would make their main effort in central Belgium and that covering a longer front would need the organisation of French reserve units and integration with the active army. The council rejected his view in 1911, which caused Michel to resign as he considered that deployment from Belfort to Mézières and an offensive towards Antwerp, Brussels and Namur as the only possible way to respond. Joseph Joffre was eventually appointed and the functions of Vice-President of the Council and Chief of Staff of the army were combined. In October 1911, a strategic assessment was delivered as part of a comprehensive review conducted from 1911–1912.

Joffre had rewritten Plan XVI by 6 September, increasing the number of troops on the Belgian frontier (although not by as much as Michel had advocated), by shifting forces from the Italian border and incorporating second line and reserve units into the front line. The Fifth Army was to assemble further left to Mézières and the Sixth Army was to move closer to Verdun and the Belgian border west of Luxembourg. The amended version of Plan XVI put seven corps close to Belgium, which guarded against a German advance around Verdun or as far as Verdun or Mézières and Joffre increased emphasis on an immediate offensive. Joffre continued to work on the plan and the possibility of a German move through Belgium, in which three alternatives were inferred, that the Germans would respect Belgian and Luxembourgeois neutrality and attack the Belfort–Épinal and Toul–Verdun lines or advance through Luxembourg in the vicinity of Verdun, then make a smaller attack into Belgium or defend in Lorraine and attack through Belgium. The third possibility was considered likely, because the French knew that a recent German war game had used the German fortifications around Metz and Thionville. German improvements to the fortifications at Metz and Thionville, led Joffre to believe that the Germans certainly would attack through Belgium and also that Belgium was the only place where France could fight a decisive battle against Germany.
On 9 January 1912, the agreed that the French army could enter Belgium but only when news had arrived that the Germans had already done so. The council also considered industrial mobilisation and the slow speed of the development of heavy artillery and agreed to increase the ammunition stock from -per-gun Soon afterwards, command of the French army was centralised by abolishing the army Chief of Staff and vesting the powers in Joffre as Chief of the General Staff but Joffre&#x27;s attempts to gain permission to ignore Belgian neutrality were rebuffed. An offensive strategy required an adequate field of operations and Belgium was the only place where the terrain was suitable but Belgian and British sensitivities remained paramount. French politicians feared that violating Belgian sovereignty would force Belgium to join Germany in the event of war and cause Britain to withdraw from its military commitments.

Despite the matter of Belgian neutrality, Joffre remained favourable to an offensive (rather than defensive-offensive) strategy and the benefit of compelling the Germans to fight against both France and Russia. Since 1894, the alliance with Russia had included a convention that both countries would treat Germany as the principal enemy, which was reaffirmed in 1910 and in subsequent staff talks. Joffre indicated that the French army would attack in the north-east and the desirability of a concurrent Russian offensive but still considered a French attack in Lorraine a possibility. For political purposes, Joffre hid his intentions from the French government, the Plan XVII included deployments near southern Belgium but did not explicitly prepare to cross the Belgian frontier. Joffre considered an advance into Belgium to be &#x27;France&#x27;s &quot;most desireable&quot; course of action&#x27;.

==Plan XVII==
After the changes to Plan XVI in September 1911, Joffre and the staff took eighteen months to revise the French concentration plan, the concept of which was accepted on 18 April 1913. Copies of Plan XVII were issued to army commanders on 7 February 1914 and the final draft was ready on 1 May. It &#x27;was, in fact, no more than a plan for the mobilisation and initial concentration and deployment of the French army&#x27;. The document was not a campaign plan but it contained a statement that the Germans were expected to concentrate the bulk of their army on the Franco-German border and might cross before French operations could begin. The instruction of the Commander in Chief was that

and that to achieve this, the French armies were to concentrate, ready to attack either side of Metz–Thionville or north into Belgium, in the direction of Arlon and Neufchâteau. An alternative concentration area for the Fourth and Fifth armies was specified, in case the Germans advanced through Luxembourg and Belgium but an enveloping attack west of the Meuse was not anticipated; the gap between the Fifth Army and the North Sea was covered by Territorial units and obsolete fortresses. Beyond force concentration, the plan left &#x27;an enormous amount of control over the use and deployment of armed forces&#x27; to Joffre at the start of war.

==Aftermath==

===Battle of the Frontiers===
When Germany declared war, France began Plan XVII with five initiatives, later named the Battle of the Frontiers. The German deployment plan, II, included the massing of German forces (less 20 per cent to defend Prussia and the German coast) on the German–Belgian border. The force was used to execute an offensive into Belgium, to force a decisive battle on the French army on territory further north than the fortified Franco-German border. The French began to implement Plan XVII with a deployment for an offensive into Alsace-Lorraine and Belgium. French strategy required the Russians to be brought into action as quickly as possible: &#x27;to do so Joffre had promised to launch his own attack at the earliest opportunity [and] had no choice but to attack across the common frontier in Alsace and Lorraine&#x27;.

The French attack into Alsace-Lorraine was defeated because of inadequate tactics, a lack of artillery-infantry co-operation and by the fighting capacity of the German armies, which inflicted huge numbers of casualties. French formations moved forward with insufficient reconnaissance. The attacks in southern Belgium were conducted with negligible reconnaissance or artillery support and were repulsed without preventing the western manoeuvre of the German armies in the north. While the attacks in the Ardennes starting on 22 August achieved strategic surprise in heavy fog, the French columns advancing were themselves unprepared and surprised by German presence in the area and were unable to attack due to a breakdown in command and control.

Within a few days the French were back in their starting positions, having suffered a costly defeat. The Germans advanced through Belgium and northern France against the Belgian, British and French armies and reached an area to the north-east of Paris but failed to trap the Allied armies and force a decisive battle on them. The German advance outran its supplies and slowed; Joffre was able to use French railways to move the retreating armies and re-group behind the river Marne and within the Paris fortified zone, faster than the Germans could pursue. The French defeated the faltering German advance with a counter-offensive at the First Battle of the Marne, assisted by the British. Helmuth von Moltke the Younger, Chief of the German General Staff, had tried to apply the offensive strategy of I (a plan for a Franco–German war, with all German forces deployed against France), to the inadequate western deployment of II (only 80 per cent of the army assembled in the west), to counter the French offensive of Plan XVII. In 2014, Terry Holmes wrote,

===Analysis===
The French offensive was defeated in a few days; on the right the First and Second armies advanced on 14 August and were back at their jumping-off points on 20 August. The offensive of the Third and Fourth armies was defeated from 21 to 23 August and the Fifth Army was defeated on the Sambre and forced to retreat during the same period. Joffre&#x27;s strategy had failed due to an underestimation of the German armies and the dispersion of the French offensive effort. With a large German force operating in Belgium, the German centre had appeared to be vulnerable to the Third and Fourth armies. The mistaken impression of the size of the German force in Belgium or its approach route, was not as significant as underestimates on the strength of the German armies opposite the Third and Fourth armies near Luxembourg. When the offensives failed, Joffre laid blame on his subordinates, finding &#x27;grave shortcomings on the part of commanders&#x27; and claimed that the French infantry had failed to show offensive spirit, despite outnumbering the German armies at their most vulnerable point, a claim that Robert A. Doughty called &quot;pure balderdash&quot;.

The reality was that many of the French casualties were said to have come from an excess of offensive vigour and on 23 August, General Pierre Ruffey concluded that the infantry had attacked without artillery preparation or supporting-fire during the battle. Early on 24 August, Joffre ordered a withdrawal to a line from Verdun to Mézières and Maubeuge and began to transfer troops from the east, opposite the German border, to the western flank. The French armies were to destroy railway facilities and inflict as many casualties as possible on the German armies while retreating, preparatory to resuming the offensive. Two strategic alternatives were possible, to attack the eastern flank of the 1st Army or to envelop the western flank of all the German armies. On 25 August, Joffre issued General Instruction No. 2, for a withdrawal to a line from Verdun to Reims and Amiens and the assembly of two corps and four reserve divisions near Amiens, to carry out the envelopment operation. Joffre called for much greater integration of the infantry and artillery and for more tactical dispersal of infantry to nullify German fire power.

The assumptions of Joffre&#x27;s pre-war strategy were proved wrong. Joffre assumed that the Germans would not push westward across Belgium into the French rear, confining themselves to eastern Belgium and that the Germans would not integrate reserve battalions into their front line units. The German advance across Belgium forced the French into hurried redeployments. German integration of reserve battalions also meant that the German extension across Belgium would not weaken the German centre as Joffre expected, &quot;instead of encountering a weakened center in eastern Belgium... French forces struck large enemy units in strong defensive positions&quot;. Joffre&#x27;s need to comply with the terms of the Franco-Russian alliance forced him to launch offensives into the Vosges, splitting his forces and weakening any possible offensive manoeuvre.

===Casualties===
In &quot;The World Crisis&quot; (1923–1931), Winston Churchill used data from French 1920 parliamentary records for French casualties from 5 August to 5 September 1914, which recorded wounded and missing. Churchill gave German casualties from August to November as and British casualties from August to September of By the end of August, the French Army had suffered of whom been killed on 22 August. French casualties for the first month of the war were which during the last four days of the Battle of the Frontiers. In 2009, Holger Herwig recorded German casualties in the 6th Army for August of killed, along with in September, them killed. The 7th Army had in August, with killed and in September with killed. In the 1st Army in August there were including killed and in the 2nd Army In the last ten days of August, the 1st Army had and the 2nd Army suffered Herwig wrote that the French army did not publish formal casualty lists but that the French Official History gave casualties of for August and September.

<text>Robert Arthur Morton Stern (born May 23, 1939) is a New York City–based architect, educator, and author. He is the founding partner of the architecture firm, Robert A. M. Stern Architects, also known as RAMSA. From 1998 to 2016, he was the Dean of the Yale School of Architecture.

His firm&#x27;s major works include the classically styled New York apartment building, 15 Central Park West; two residential colleges at Yale University; Philadelphia&#x27;s Museum of the American Revolution; and the modernist Comcast Center skyscraper in Philadelphia. In 2011, Stern was honored with the Driehaus Architecture Prize for his achievements in contemporary classical architecture. Schwarzman College was designed by Stern; the 200,000 square foot campus houses one of the most advanced higher-education facilities in the world and is one of the first LEED Gold-certified academic buildings in China. 

==Early life and education==
Born in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, in 1939 to a Jewish family, Stern spent his earliest years with his parents in the nearby Manhattan borough. After 1940, they moved back to Brooklyn, where Stern grew up. Stern received a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Columbia University in 1960 and a master&#x27;s degree in architecture from Yale University in 1965. Stern has cited the historian Vincent Scully and the architect Philip Johnson as early mentors and influences.

==Career==
After graduating from Yale, Stern worked as a curator for the Architectural League of New York, a job he gained through his connection to Philip Johnson. While at the League, he organized the second &quot;40 Under 40&quot; show, which featured his own work alongside work of then-little-known architects Charles Moore, Robert Venturi and Romaldo Giurgola, all of whom were featured in the influential issue of &quot;Perspecta&quot; that Stern edited a year before at Yale. Upon leaving the Architectural League in 1966, Stern worked briefly as a designer in the office of the architect Richard Meier, then worked for two and a half years at New York City&#x27;s Housing and Development Administration, after which he established Stern &amp; Hagmann with John S. Hagmann, a fellow student from his days at Yale. In 1977 he founded its successor firm, Robert A.M. Stern Architects, now known as RAMSA. Stern remains a partner at RAMSA, and has indicated he has no plans to retire.

===Educator===
Stern was the dean of the Yale School of Architecture from 1998 to 2016, and has continued to teach there since the end of his tenure. Previously, he taught at Columbia University, in the Columbia Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation, and from 1984 to 1988 was the director of Columbia&#x27;s Temple Hoyne Buell Center for the Study of American Architecture.

===Other activities===
A prolific writer, Stern has authored, co-authored, and edited numerous books about architecture, including five volumes about New York City&#x27;s architectural history, each focusing on a different period. In 1986, he hosted &quot;Pride of Place: Building the American Dream&quot;, an eight-part documentary series that aired on PBS. The series featured Peter Eisenman, Leon Krier, Philip Johnson, Frank Gehry and other notable architects. &quot;Pride of Place&quot; was well received by the public.

==Work==
Many of Stern&#x27;s early works were private houses in the New York metropolitan area, including in the Hamptons and in Westchester County. Early commercial commissions included projects for Walt Disney World such as Disney&#x27;s Yacht Club Resort, Disney&#x27;s Beach Club Resort and the masterplan for Celebration, Florida, and from 1992−2003, Stern served on the board of the Walt Disney Company.

Stern is now better known for his large-scale condominium and apartment building projects in New York City, which include 20 East End Avenue, The Chatham, The Brompton and 15 Central Park West. The latter was, at the time of its completion, one of the most financially successful apartment buildings ever constructed, with sales totaling $2 billion.

Stern has designed some of the tallest structures in the United States, including the glass-clad Comcast Center, the second tallest building in both Philadelphia and Pennsylvania. The Driehaus Prize committee (commenting on a preliminary, stone-clad, pyramidal-topped scheme) characterized the design as &quot;[carrying] forward the proportions of the classical obelisk&quot;. The scheme, along with Stern&#x27;s 15 Central Park West, and his master plan for Celebration, were cited as contributing factors in his having won the award. More recently, Stern has designed three skyscrapers in New York City, 220 Central Park South, 520 Park Avenue and 30 Park Place, which will be among the tallest buildings in the city and the United States when complete. In 2017 RAMSA completed a major addition to the campus of Yale University, with two new residential colleges, Pauli Murray College and Benjamin Franklin College, both designed in a Collegiate Gothic style.

===Style===
In the 1970s, and early 1980s, Stern developed a reputation as a postmodern architect for integrating classical elements into his designs for contemporary buildings, but in the mid-1980s, his work became more traditional, more in keeping with the then emerging New Classical architectural movement. Stern, however, has rejected such characterizations, arguing that his projects draw on vernacular context and local traditions. In recent years, the work of Stern&#x27;s office has ranged from traditional to modernist, depending on the building type and project location, and is best characterized as eclectic and contextual.

===Notable projects===
==Personal life==
Stern owns an apartment in The Chatham, a building he designed in New York City. In 1966, he married photographer Lynn Gimbel Solinger, the daughter of David Solinger and the granddaughter of Bernard Gimbel, a marriage that ended by divorce in 1977. They had one son, Nicholas S. G. Stern, who manages the boutique construction and planning firm Stern Projects.

<doc id="1171111" wikidata="Q642626" url="?curid=1171111" title="Eeltail catfish">
<text>The eeltail catfish are a family (Plotosidae) of catfish whose tails are elongated in an eel-like fashion. These catfishes are native to the Indian Ocean and western Pacific from Japan to Australia and Fiji. The family includes about 41 species in 10 genera. About half of the species are freshwater, occurring in Australia and New Guinea.

These fish have eel-like bodies. Their tails are pointed or bluntly rounded. Most species have four pairs of barbels. The adipose fin is absent. The tail fin is formed by the joining of the second dorsal fin, the caudal fin, and the anal fin, forming a single, continuous fin.

Some of these catfishes can inflict painful wounds; stings from &quot;Plotosus lineatus&quot; may cause death, however stings from other types of eeltail catfish causes stinging which usually resides up to two weeks from when the person was penetrated by its dorsal spines. They are bottom feeders and use the barbels around their mouths to detect food.

Unlike most marine teleosts, eeltails have an extra-branchial salt-secreting dendritic organ for osmoregulation. The dendritic organ is likely a product of convergent evolution with other vertebrate salt-secreting organs. The role of this organ was discovered by its high NKA and NKCC activity in response to increasing salinity. However, the Plotosidae dendritic organ may be of limited use under extreme salinity conditions, compared to more typical gill-based ionoregulation.

<doc id="1171112" wikidata="Q813411" url="?curid=1171112" title="Beaumaris, Victoria">
<text>Beaumaris ( ) is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 20 km south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Bayside local government area. Beaumaris recorded a population of 13,947 at the 2021 census.

Beaumaris is located on Port Phillip Bay and is bounded by Reserve Road and Weatherall Road in the north, Charman Road in the east, the Port Phillip Bay foreshore in the south, and McGregor Avenue, Fifth Street, Keating Street, Iluka Street, Fairleigh Avenue and Royal Melbourne Golf Club in the west.

==Geology==

The blunt V-shaped intrusion of land into the Bay that is spearheaded by Table Rock Point is referred to as the Beaumaris &#x27;Peninsula&#x27;. The Beaumaris cliffs to the north east of Table Rock are formed by the steeply folded rock layers known as the Beaumaris Monocline, which is considered to be of Tertiary age overlying older structures. These include the underlying Silurian rock known as the Fyansford formation above which is the 15 m thick darker Beaumaris Sandstone, overlain by yellowish Red Bluff Sandstone, as outcrops in the cliffs, ferruginised, with hard ironstone in the upper sections, extending to the platform, and as small reefs parallel to the coastline. A thin calcareous sandstone is overlain by fine sandy marl and sandstone with calcareous concretions. At the base of the sandstone is a thin gravelly bed that includes concretionary nodules of phosphate and iron of which detached nodules may be found around the cliff base.

The Monocline can be seen where the cliffs of Beaumaris are locally parallel to the turnover of the monocline, which forms a drainage divide between the Gardners Creek-Dandenong Creeks systems and the Carrum Swamp. Layers in the cliff are almost horizontal, but fold downward almost 30º toward the vertical south-easterly and out to sea. Jagged remains of the strata can be seen off-shore at low tide from the cliff-top walk at the end of Wells Road.

Behind Keefer&#x27;s Fishermens Wharf the lower level of the cliffs is a fossil site of international significance. Shells, sea urchins, crabs, foraminifera, remains of whales, sharks, rays and dolphins, and also birds and marsupials, dating back to the Late Miocene to Early Pliocene (12 to 6 million years ago) can be found, and have been the subject of a number of papers.

==History==
===Indigenous occupation===

The Bunurong (or Boon Wurrung) peoples of the Kulin nation lived along the Eastern coast of Port Philip Bay for over 20,000 years before white settlement. Their mythology preserves the history of the flooding of Port Phillip Bay 10,000 years ago, and its period of drying and retreat 2,800–1,000 years ago. Visible evidence of their shell middens and hand-dug wells remain along the cliffs of Beaumaris, but by the 1850s most withdrew to the Mordialloc Aboriginal Reserve established in 1852, and after the 1860s, to Coranderrk.

===European settlement===

One of the first white settlers was James Bickford Moysey in 1845, who, along with several other local settlers had Welsh roots, and he gave the name &#x27;Beaumaris&#x27; to his pastoral run after the Welsh Town of Beaumaris (Welsh: &quot;Biwmares&quot;) on the Isle of Anglesey in the Menai Strait, called &#x27;beaux marais&#x27; by Norman-French builders of the castle there, a name which translates as &quot;beautiful marshes&quot;. Moysey eventually purchased 32 hectares for his farm. There is a monument on the foreshore opposite the hotel where Moysey had built a house.

===Beaumaris cemetery===
The first Cheltenham settlers, Stephen and Mary Ann Charman, donated land in 1854 that was the first cemetery of the area, established in the churchyard of the small timber Wesleyan Church at the western corner of what is now Balcombe Road and Bickford Court. There, two of the Charman&#x27;s own babies were buried in 1855 and 1859. Soon reaching capacity, this small cemetery operated for only 11 years with the last known burial in 1866. Other faiths traveled to Brighton to bury their dead. The church building on the site was sold in 1893 and moved to Langwarrin and the land turned over to grazing. In 1954 the Moorabbin Council, faced with growing population and ramping land values, granted a permit to the Methodist Church to subdivide the land. Everest Le Page, Moorabbin Councillor and Cheltenham resident, believing that the previous burial sites may not have been relocated following the closure of the church, argued unsuccessfully against sub-division and seven lots of land were sold and houses built there. Researcher Shirley Joy was unable to find evidence in 1998 that the church burials at the site had been relocated prior to the subdivision and development of the land Responding to her efforts Mayor of Bayside, Cr Graeme Disney, had a commemorative bronze plaque set into the footpath at the corner of Balcombe Road and Bickford Court, Beaumaris.

===Establishment of the suburb===
Current day Beaumaris covers two early estates in the parish of Moorabbin developed by Josiah Holloway from 1852. Named Beaumaris Town and Beaumaris Estate after the Moysey holding, the lots comprising them were marketed by Mr. Holloway&#x27;s suggesting that the railway was imminent and a canal would be built. Advertising for an auction on 13 March 1876 of blocks of land at &quot;Dalgety&#x27;s Paddock&quot; between Balcombe Road and the beach, Beaumaris, portion no. 48, Parish of Moorabbin, describes the area as &quot;The Ramsgate of Victoria,&quot; after the seaside town in East Kent.

A Beaumaris Post Office was opened on 1 March 1868, but was renamed Gipsy Village (now Sandringham) office at the end of that month. The township developed slowly, with Beaumaris Hotel, the first shop and civic hall being built in the 1880s. Beaumaris Post Office did not reopen until 1925. In 1957, this was renamed Beaumaris South when a new Beaumaris office opened in the current location. In 1954, Cromer Post Office opened to the north of the suburb.

The &#x27;Great Southern&#x27; hotel was built in 1889 as a seaside resort, then in the 1920s, was renamed the Beaumaris Hotel. The original structure survived in the Beaumaris bushfires of 1944, only to be extensively rebuilt and extended in 1950 as &#x27;The Beaumaris&#x27;. In 2014, the hotel was converted into 58 apartments.

===Beaumaris Tram Company===
==== Horse tramway ====

At the height of the Victorian land boom in 1887, the Brighton railway line was extended to Sandringham. Thomas Bent, Chairman of Moorabbin Shire Council, keen to stimulate development south of Sandringham sought and received permission to build two tramways from Sandringham station along the coast road to Beaumaris, and from there to Cheltenham railway station, with a branch from Beaumaris continuing down the coast road to Mordialloc; more than 15 kilometres of tramline in total.

The Shire Council contracted the Beaumaris Tramway Company (BTC) in February 1888 for a horse tramway with a 30-year operating lease. The Sandringham to Cheltenham route cost £20,000 and opened that Christmas. At the February 1891, half-yearly meeting of the Beaumaris Tramway Company Limited the chairman Mr. H. Byron Moore reported that a recent doubling of traffic was coupled to the increasing popularity of cheap rail return tickets to Sandringham issued by the Victorian Railways, nearly 17,000 of which had been issued. Holiday-makers were offered moonlight tram rides during summer that year and artists of the Victorian Sketching Club used the service. The Mordialloc branch line was never built, and after the land boom bubble burst in 1891, development beyond Black Rock ceased for several decades. Holiday traffic kept the business afloat until in 1912 the Beaumaris to Cheltenham section closed, and in 1914, the BTC ceased operation.

There are no remains of the line to be found, but it is remembered by the name of the suburban street that it once used; Tramway Parade, Beaumaris.

==== Electric trams ====

Development from the first decade of the twentieth century of the area between Sandringham and Black Rock prompted formation of a public association to lobby for extension of the Sandringham railway that gained Parliamentary support in 1910, though it was vetoed over the high cost of land resumptions. In both 1913 and 1914, proposals were put forward for an electric tramway from Sandringham to Black Rock but using an inland route to preserve the visual amenity of the coastal reserves. In November 1914, an Act enabled this tramway to be owned and operated by Victorian Railways, on standard gauge to cater for any future connection to the main Melbourne system. The line, almost entirely double track, was opened on 10 March 1919 with a small three-road depot at Sandringham railway station yard connecting with the down track in Bay Street. Six crossbench cars with six trailers operated on the tramway, with Elwood Depot maintaining track and rolling stock, joined in 1921 by four new bogie tramcars.

Beaumaris residents&#x27; lobbying for an extension of the Black Rock service was considered by the Parliamentary Standing Committee in 1916 and again in 1919, but it was not until 1925 that an agreement was struck between VR and Sandringham City Council for the latter to provide a £2,000 annual operating subsidy to the proposed extension for a period of five years. As a result, construction of the Beaumaris extension commenced, and the single-track line was opened on 1 September 1926. The line ran from the end of Bluff Road in Black Rock, along Ebden Avenue, Fourth Street, Haydens Road, Pacific Boulevard, Reserve Road, Holding Street, and to the end of Martin Street almost up to the intersection of Tramway Parade, where a switch allowed the tram to make the reverse trip. As the anticipated residential development did not occur, the &#x27;Bush Tramway&#x27;, as it came to be known, ran at a heavy loss despite the £2,000 operating subsidy, and exactly five years after opening, the Beaumaris extension closed on 31 August 1931. Until the 1960s when roads were surfaced, traces of the asphalt and timber foundations of the tramway remained in the centre of Holding Street.

===Sea baths===
Sea baths were constructed in Beaumaris and used for more than thirty years from 1902 to 1934.

In the 1890s, there were proposals to build fenced and netted baths with changing facilities in the sea at Beaumaris, like those at Sandringham and Brighton Beach, and others at Mentone and Mordialloc which were operated by the Shire of Moorabbin.

Support for the idea came in 1896 from the proprietor of the Beaumaris Hotel Mrs. Finlay, who offered £20 per year for use of the baths by her boarders free of charge, and John Keys, the Shire Secretary and Engineer envisaged additional income to the council of £15 from its lease. By August that year, Cr. Smith reported that residents would raise a subscription and requested that plans be drawn up and tenders called. An alternative proposal was to use the hulk &quot;Hilaria&quot; floated off-shore to house the baths. That caused some dispute but came to nothing, delaying progress until 1902 when tenders were finally called for a conventional bath.

Charles Keefer was ultimately successful in his bid for £105 to build, with additional rooms, the structure planned for a site beneath the cliffs east of Beaumaris Hotel, and it was he who was accepted to lease the baths at a rent of £15. Charges were £1 per annum per person, or a monthly ticket of five shillings, while a single bath cost three pence. Keefer managed both the Beaumaris Baths and a boat hire facility operated from a jetty he constructed nearby until, on 30 November 1934, a storm destroyed the baths, which were never rebuilt. The same storm&#x27;s destruction of bathing boxes appears in paintings by Beaumaris artist Clarice Beckett.

===Factory village===
In 1939, Dunlop Rubber Company purchased 180 hectares of land in Beaumaris, intending to build a large factory and model village in an area bounded by Balcombe Rd., Beach Rd., Gibbs St. and Cromer Rd. Plans were shelved a month later with the outbreak of World War II.

===1944 bushfires===

In the midst of WW2 and a severe drought, came disastrous bushfires on 14 January 1944, which killed 51 people across Victoria. The maximum temperature in Melbourne that day was 39.5 °C with gusty hot northerly winds driving two fire fronts across the heavily wooded suburb. The number of homes destroyed in sparsely populated Beaumaris was reported at between 63 and 100, leaving &#x27;a square mile&#x27; burnt out, and 200 homeless. Hundreds of volunteers, including many from the city, with fire brigades from neighbouring suburbs and soldiers who were trucked in, could not control the flames. Householders and holidaymakers cut fire-breaks, but fire leapt every gap, leaving 7 caravans and 5 cars gutted in the caravan park.
Scores of people sheltered in the sea for hours from fierce flames in the cliff-top ti-tree, with many suffering exposure as a result and some with severe burns also contracting pneumonia.

Although everyone who had lost their homes had been provided with temporary accommodation by the Red Cross and Salvation Army, many in rooms, lounges and corridors of the Beaumaris Hotel that was one of the few buildings left standing, more permanent accommodation was difficult to provide. Damage estimated by the office of the Town Clerk at Sandringham at £50,000 (not including clothing, furniture and other personal effects lost) was done to buildings. The Premier Albert Dunstan convened a special meeting of Cabinet to consider relief measures and, with Sandringham Lord Mayor Councillor Nettlefold, inaugurated a State-wide appeal.

===Road surfacing, 1960s===
In 1949, architect Robin Boyd in a regular column in Melbourne&#x27;s &quot;The Age&quot; noted that: 
 The appearance of the original &#x27;tracks&#x27; were recorded in an album by W.L. Murrell, photographer and Hon. Librarian of the Beaumaris and District Historical Trust. Most of the &quot;ti-tree tracks&quot; that roughly followed the street grid of Beaumaris remained unmade until the City of Sandringham realigned and surfaced them in asphalt between concrete kerbs in a campaign during 1961–67. The tree-clearing required was opposed by many residents, but their protests were successful only in Point Avenue, which remained an unmade private road.

==Education==



Elementary education for Beaumaris children in the mid-1800s was provided by the closest &#x27;common school&#x27;; a private school started by Frederick and Fanny Meeres in 1855 in a single-room wooden dwelling near the Cheltenham Railway Station.  The school was first named the Beaumaris Wesleyan School. In 1863, it became a public school under the control of the National Schools Board, and in 1864, Henry Wells, George Beazley, and Samuel Munby were appointed by the Board to the &#x27;Beaumaris School&#x27; on its committee. A Church of England Cheltenham school had also been established on 1 October 1854 in an area 25 minutes walk away and east of Point Nepean Road and north of Centre Dandenong Road. Due to their proximity in 1869, it was to be amalgamated with the &#x27;Beaumaris&#x27; school, though the former raised religious objections. The Meeres school was relocated onto Crown Land in Charman Road, Cheltenham and in 1872 renamed Beaumaris Common School No. 84. Amongst several others for works in the city and suburbs, the lowest tender at £1055 from Mr George Evans of Ballarat, was publicly accepted in November 1877 by the Education Department for the construction of a brick school at the current site. There it continued as the &#x27;Beaumaris&#x27; school until 1885, when it finally became State School No. 84 Cheltenham, the name it retains.

As population in Beaumaris increased so came demands that a school be established within the suburb, so that small children would not need to walk 3.6 km to Charman Road. Subsequently, in May 1915, Beaumaris State School, no.3899, was opened for 41 pupils in the old hall built in the heyday of the 1880s land boom and situated between Martin Street and Bodley Street on the site currently occupied by Beaumaris Bowls Club. The 432sq. metre brick and timber theatre hall had an upper circle and rooms below the stage. The first teacher, from May 1915, was Mrs Fairlie Taylor (née Aidie Lilian Fairlam). It moved in 1917 to its current site in Dalgetty Road as the population of the school grew. Beaumaris North Primary School first opened in 1959 followed by Stella Maris Primary School (Roman Catholic), once attended by Member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly for Sandringham Brad Rowswell. Beaumaris High School, which opened in 1958, became the Beaumaris Campus of Sandringham College, catering to years 7–10, from 1988 until 2015. A new high school catering for years 7–12, Beaumaris Secondary College, was built on the same site at the corner of Reserve Road and Balcombe Road and opened in January 2018. Beaumaris Primary School administration building and some of the classrooms were damaged by fire in 1994. Beaumaris Primary school was centre of a inquiry into Child Sexual abuse offences in the 1960 and 1970&#x27;s.

==Transport==
Major thoroughfares in Beaumaris include Balcombe Road, Reserve Road, Beach Road, Haydens Road and Charman Road.

Beaumaris is serviced regularly by bus routes to St Kilda, Dandenong, Moorabbin and Westfield Southland.

Beaumaris is accessible from the Frankston and Sandringham railway lines.

==Ricketts Point==

The most prominent landmarks of this suburb are on its coastline, and include the Beaumaris Cliff, from Charman Road to Table Rock, which is of international importance as a site for marine and terrestrial fossils, and Ricketts Point, which adjoins a 115 hectare Marine Sanctuary and popular beach area. The coastal waters from Table Rock Point in Beaumaris to Quiet Corner in Black Rock and approximately 500 metres to seaward formally became the Ricketts Point Marine Sanctuary under state legislation passed in June 2002.

Marine Care Ricketts Point Inc., a volunteer organisation concerned with the preservation of the marine sanctuary, is active at Ricketts Point.

Beaumaris Conservation Society Inc. was founded in 1953 as the Beaumaris Tree Preservation Society and has been active since then in championing the conservation of the substantial amount of remaining indigenous vegetation in Beaumaris and its other significant environmental qualities. It is campaigning against a proposal for a large private marina proposed for the Beaumaris Bay Fossil Site.

Ricketts Point is also home to the Beaumaris Life Saving Club, which holds yearly Life Saving Carnivals in the summer.

==People==
===Artists===

====Heidelberg school====

From the late 19th century Beaumaris and its coastal scenery attracted artists. Near Ricketts Point, there is a monument commemorating the first encounter of Arthur Streeton and Heidelberg school artists Tom Roberts, and Fred McCubbin who rented a house over the summer of 1886/7. McCubbin later painted &quot;A ti-tree glade&quot; there in 1890. Their associate, Charles Conder also painted idyllic scenes on the beach at Rickett&#x27;s Point before he left for Europe in 1890. These paintings of Beaumaris are featured on plaques at the sites which they depict in the City of Bayside Coastal Art Trail.

====Barbizon====
Michael O&#x27;Connell (1898–1976), a British soldier returned from the Western Front, between 1924 and 1926 built Barbizon (named after the French art school), on a bush block in Tramway Parade near Beach Road. The house was constructed from hand made concrete blocks on a simple cruciform plan and regarded by some as an early Modernist design. It became a meeting place for Melbourne&#x27;s alternative artists and designers including members of the Arts and Crafts Society. During the 1920s O&#x27;Connell focussed on School of Paris inspired textile design with his wife Ella Moody (1900–1981). Michael and Ella returned to England for a visit in 1937 but with the outbreak of war remained there and never returned to Australia. Barbizon was destroyed by the bushfire of 1944.

====Clarice Beckett====
Clarice Beckett (1887–1935) now highly regarded as an original Australian modernist, moved with her elderly parents from Bendigo to &quot;St. Enoch&#x27;s,&quot; 14 Dalgetty Rd., Beaumaris in 1919 to care for them in their failing health, a duty that severely limited her artistic endeavours so that she could only go out during the dawn and dusk to paint her landscapes. Nevertheless, her output was prodigious; she exhibited solo shows every year from 1923 to 1933 and with groups, mainly at Melbourne&#x27;s Athenaeum Gallery, from 1918 to 1934. Many of her works depict still recognisable places along the coast as well as everyday 1920s suburban street scenes. While painting the wild sea off Beaumaris during a big storm in 1935, Beckett developed pneumonia and died four days later in Sandringham hospital, at age 48. In the municipal council, the Beckett ward is named in her memory.

====The Boyd family====
In 1955 Arthur and Yvonne Boyd moved from Murrumbeena to Beaumaris before setting out in 1959 for a nine-year residency in England. Robert Beck (1942-), the second son of Henry Hatton Beck and Lucy Beck (née Boyd), and his wife Margot (1948- ) set up a pottery at the Boyd&#x27;s Surf Avenue house where his parents had returned from the UK to live. The two couples worked closely together over this period, making a range of decorated wares and many of their most remarkable ceramic tiles.

====Architects and designers====


In the post-war period those returned from the military purchased land in the area, and after the bushfires there was much demand for new housing. Eric Lyon noted over 50 architects living in Beaumaris in the 1950s and a 1956 publication from the Royal Victorian Institute of Architects attributed to Robin Boyd the statement that Beaumaris had &quot;the greatest concentration of interesting houses in the metropolitan area&quot;. Some of the earliest homes by Australia&#x27;s best known architects are in Beaumaris: Grounds Romberg &amp; Boyd, Peter McIntyre, Neil Clerehan, Chancellor and Patrick, Yunken Freeman, John Baird, Mockridge Stahle Mitchell, McGlashan Everist, Anatol Kagan, David Godsell and Peter Carmichael amongst others.

In that immediate post-war period modest architect-designed timber dwellings, and &#x27;beach houses,&#x27; were erected in Beaumaris which have come to be styled collectively &quot;Beaumaris Modern&quot;. With rectilinear, box-like volumes and typically small-scale, they were usually single-storey, of light construction on a minimalist plan, with flat or raking roofs, broad eaves supported on timber beams left visible in interiors, and with painted fascias. Timber cladding between brick pylons or planar walls, left space for Mondrian-esque bays of timber-framed, often full-height windows or a Stegbar Window Wall of Boyd design. Garages were incorporated into the structure (often half-basement) or were in the form of simple, attached flat-roofed carports. Surrounding gardens in the fast-draining sandy soil were of indigenous plants amongst existing ti-tree, gums and banksia.

Some were built by designers while in the course of their architecture degrees, such as the single-storey gable-roofed weatherboard house at 10 Hardinge Street, Beaumaris, attributed to David Brunton, Bernard Joyce and John Thornes-Lilly, but mostly the work of Brunton, who erected the house for his own use.

Beaumaris houses often incorporate bold experimentation in materials, forms and structural systems, such as Peter McIntyre&#x27;s bowstring truss houses; influences of the Prairie School style of Frank Lloyd Wright and his contemporaries; extending to the 1970s in early examples of dwellings in the Brutalist style characterised by chunky forms with bold diagonal elements and raw concrete finishes first used in civic and institutional buildings in Australia from the mid-1960s and applied to domestic architecture such as the award-winning Leonard French House in Alfred Street, Beaumaris. A long-time resident of Beaumaris, David Godsell was responsible for a number of buildings in the City of Bayside, the most important being Godsell&#x27;s own 1960 house at 491 Balcombe Road, Beaumaris, a multi-level Wrightian composition now included on the heritage overlay. He also designed several buildings that were never built, including a remarkable Wright-influenced  clubhouse for the Black Rock Yacht Club and a star-shaped Beaumaris house with a hexagonal module. Though, like many modernist homes in the district, several of his houses have been demolished since, surviving examples are simpler, more minimalist designs with planar face brick walls and floating flat roofs. Only the Grant House, 14 Pasedena Ave Beaumaris; the Godsell House, Balcombe Rd, Beaumaris; and the Johnson House, 451 Beach Rd Beaumaris, are under heritage protection.

The Norman Edward Brotchie (1929–1991) pharmacy designed in the 1950s by architect Peter McIntyre featured boldly distinctive floor-to-ceiling coloured tile murals. The design by an unknown artist of overlapping cubist apothecary jars and bottles in yellow, brick-red, yellow and black covered sides of the facade and the interior walls of the premises at the southwest corner of Keys Street, Beaumaris. They were demolished during renovations in 2007.

Significant mid-century industrial design and fittings emerged from Beaumaris in the same period; Donald Brown&#x27;s aluminium BECO (a.k.a. Brown Evans and Co.) light fittings featured in many houses (particularly those by Robin Boyd) in the 1950s and 60&#x27;s, while the designer of the famous Planet lamp Bill Iggulden, was a resident of Beaumaris.

====Beaumaris Art Group====
In 1953, when Beaumaris still retained a village character, a small band of resident artist friends, including painter Inez Hutchinson (1890–1970), sculptor Joan Macrae (1918–2017) and ceramicist Betty Jennings staged an exhibition which led to their establishing the Beaumaris Art Group, a not-for-profit organisation, later that year.

An exhibition in 1961 of five women artists including June Stephenson, Sue McDougall, Grace Somerville, Margaret Dredge and Inez Green raised funds for the Art Group. They continued to meet and exhibit at the Beaumaris State School, before purchasing land and building studios in 1965 designed by local architect C. Bricknell at 84–98 Reserve Rd, which were opened by director of the National Gallery of Victoria, Dr. Eric Westbrook, who also launched the Inez Hutchinson awards in 1966. Further structural additions by John Thompson were added in 1975/76. Current President is Cate Rayson.

Since 2016 Council and the BAG committee had discussed redevelopment of the BAG Studios in regard to safety and spatial requirements and a decision to demolish the building was made in May 2019. Community and heritage concerns caused this proposal to be rescinded in February 2020. A heritage report was commissioned in late 2019 as part of the ‘Mid-Century Modern Heritage Study—Council-owned Places’ (the ‘Heritage Study’) in which 8 Council-owned, mid-twentieth-century buildings were assessed for their heritage potential. It concluded that the BAG building was sound and demolition should be avoided.

====Galleries====
Beaumaris Art Group houses a small gallery and display cases in its premises in which it displays its annual shows, open days and work by members. In the 1950s before construction of its own quarters in 1965, its first annual exhibitions were held at the State School.

Clive Parry Galleries, managed by Russell. K. Davis, operated from 1966 until 1979 at 468 Beach Road, near the junction of Keys St., and exhibited paintings, drawings, textiles, woodcraft, ceramics, jewellery, and graphics by artists including Margaret Dredge, Robert Grieve, Wesley Penberthy, Mac Betts, Kathleen Boyle, Colin Browne, Ian Armstrong, Noel Counihan, Wladyslaw Dutkiewicz, David Dridan, Judi Elliot, Vic Greenaway, Tim Guthrie, Ann Graham, Erica McGilchrist, Warren Breninger, Max Middleton, Millan Todd, Douglas Stubbs, Alfred Calkoen, Lynne Cooke, Peter Glass, Noela Hjorth, Bruno Leti, Charles Billich, Barbara Brash, Dorothy Braund, Murray Champion, Peter Jacobs, Marcella Hempel, Kevin Lincoln, Judy Lorraine, Mary MacQueen, Helen Maudsley, Jason Monet, Tim Moorhead, Victor O&#x27;Connor, Elizabeth Prior, Anne Judell, Paul King, Nornie Gude, Norman Lindsay, Ailsa O&#x27;Connor, Jack Courier, Alan Sumner, Howard Arkley, Alan Watt, Tina Wentcher and William Dargie. In June 1975, 1976 and 1977 it hosted the Inez Hutchinson Award presented by the Beaumaris Art Group.

Other venues more recently have included the Ricketts Point Tea House

====Creative professionals====
Beside architects, other creative professionals who were residents of Beaumaris include fashion designers Sally Brown, Linda Jackson, Prue Acton and Geoff Bade; architect and historian Mary Turner Shaw; graphic designers Frank Eidlitz and Brian Sadgrove; flag designer and canvas goods manufacturer Ivor William Evans (1887–1960); journalist and nature writer Donald Alaster Macdonald (1859?–1932) whose memorial is in Donald MacDonald reserve, and whose ideas were continued in 1953 when the Beaumaris Tree Preservation Society (now Beaumaris Conservation Society) was formed to conserve bushland against accelerating land clearances for housing and to encourage planting of indigenous vegetation. Musicians include Colin Hay, and Brett and Sally Iggulden (children of Bill Iggulden who designed the Series K Planet Lamp in 1962) who were founders and members, with others from the district, of The Red Onion Jazz Band in the 1960s.

<text>Little Italy is an area in the eastern part of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It is in the Grandview–Woodland neighbourhood, and is often synonymous with the Commercial Drive area.

Historically this area was an enclave of ethnic Italians and Italian businesses. Today, after a period of steady decline, it is again a multi-cultural, vibrant commercial centre.

==History==
Prior to the 1930s, most Italian immigrants settled in what is today the Strathcona district; however, by the 1940s and 1950s most Italian immigrants to Vancouver settled in the northern Commercial Drive area, and were widely credited with revitalizing the neighbourhood. Most Italian Canadian businesses and cultural facilities are located along Commercial Drive and, since Italians were in the majority in the adjacent residential areas, Little Italy became a true ethnic Italian enclave. By the 1960s, many Italian businesses also sprang up in the Hastings and Nanaimo areas, but the cultural core remained on Commercial Drive. Ethnic Italians were very influential in this area from the 1940s until the mid-1970s.

By the mid-1970s, a combination of cultural assimilation, non-Italian immigration, movement to the suburbs, and a schism within the Italian community led to the decline of Italian influence and concentration in Little Italy. Today, the area is again a vibrant cultural and business centre in eastern Vancouver, but after a succession of other immigrant and cultural groups, the Italian influence has greatly diminished.

On April 6, 2016, the Vancouver City Councillors voted unanimously to declare the area Little Italy. A ribbon-cutting ceremony was held on June 12 to officially recognize an eight-block stretch of Commercial Drive as Little Italy.

==Italians in Metro Vancouver today==
Today, there are still many Italian businesses and cultural organizations in Vancouver, and people of Italian ancestry living in the Greater Vancouver area number about 75,000. However, no particular single area is predominantly Italian in concentration.

Burnaby Heights is not predominantly Italian, but Italian-Canadians have a distinct presence in the neighbourhood. East Hastings Street, between Boundary and Duthie, is another commercial hub for the Italian community. There are many Italian cafes, delis, and restaurants along the street, including stores which import goods from Italy. Two Roman Catholic churches offering masses in Italian, St. Helen&#x27;s and Holy Cross, are located nearby. Older, first-generation Italians often congregate in nearby Confederation Park to play Bocce.

<text>Elissa Landi (born Elisabeth Marie Christine von Kühnelt; December 6, 1904 – October 21, 1948) was an Austrian-American actress born in Venice, who was popular as a performer in Hollywood films of the 1920s and 1930s. She &quot;claims descent from Empress Elizabeth of Austria-Hungary&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;gettyimages/502327509&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and was noted for her alleged aristocratic bearing.

==Biography==
Landi was born Elizabeth Marie Christine von Kühnelt in Venice, Italy, to Austrian military officer Richard Kühnelt and his wife Caroline (later, &quot;Countess Caroline Zanardi Landi&quot;). She was raised in the village of Kleinhart in Lower Austria near Vienna until the divorce of her parents. Later on she was educated in England. From 1928 to 1936, she was married to John Cecil Lawrence, and from 1943 to 1948 to Curtis Kinney Thomas.

Landi&#x27;s first ambition was to be an author. She wrote her first novel at the age of twenty, and returned to writing during lulls in her acting career. She debuted on stage in &quot;Dandy Dick&quot; (1923). She joined the Oxford Repertory Company at an early age, and appeared in many successful British and American stage productions. In 1926 she starred in Dorothy Brandon&#x27;s &quot;Blind Alley&quot; in the West End. 

During the 1920s she appeared in British, French, and German films before traveling to the United States to appear in a Broadway production of &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; (1930). Her other Broadway credits included &quot;Empress of Destiny&quot; (1938), &quot;Apology&quot; (1943), and &quot;Dark Hammock&quot; (1944).

She was signed to a contract by Fox Film Corporation (later 20th Century Fox) in 1931. She was paired successfully with some of the major leading men, including David Manners, Charles Farrell, Warner Baxter, and Ronald Colman, in romantic dramas such as &quot;Body and Soul&quot; (1931, which also featured Humphrey Bogart).

In 1931, she starred in the Fox feature &quot;The Yellow Ticket&quot; along with a young Laurence Olivier, Lionel Barrymore, and Boris Karloff. Raoul Walsh directed. The film was based on Michael Morton&#x27;s 1914 play and was about a young Jewish girl who obtains a prostitute&#x27;s passport during a period when Jews were not allowed such freedom so that she can travel in Czarist Russia to visit her sick father.

Fox loaned her to Paramount in 1932 to play Mercia, the female lead in Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s &quot;The Sign of the Cross&quot; adapted from the play of the same name. DeMille said he chose her for the role because &quot;[t]here is the depth of the ages in her eyes, today in her body and tomorrow in her spirit.&quot;

Landi traveled with Katharine Hepburn.&lt;ref name=&quot;gettyimages/515143330&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

She starred in the box office hit &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; (1934) with Robert Donat.

Her contract with Fox was abruptly cancelled in 1936 when she refused a particular role. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer signed her, and after a couple of romantic dramas, she played the cousin of Myrna Loy in &quot;After the Thin Man&quot; (1936). She retired from acting in 1943, after making only two more films.

Landi became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1943 and dedicated herself to writing, producing six novels and a series of poems. She had published her first novel as early as age nineteen. She continued writing novels at the height of her movie fame and for the rest of her short life.

She died&lt;ref name=&quot;cdnc/MT19481021.2.24&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; from cancer in Kingston, New York, at age 43 and was buried at Oak Hill Cemetery in Newburyport, Massachusetts. 

Landi has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her contributions to Motion Pictures, at 1611 Vine Street.&lt;ref name=&quot;projects.latimes/walk/elissa-landi&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

<text>René Joachim Henri Dutrochet (14 November 1776 – 4 February 1847) was a French physician, botanist and physiologist. He is best known for his investigation into osmosis.

==Early career==
Dutrochet was born on Néons to a noble family, soon ruined in the French Revolution. In 1799 he entered the military marine at Rochefort, but soon left it to join the Vendean army. He then left it to tend to his family&#x27;s manor in Touraine. There, he was a keen addition to the scientific nation.

In 1802 he began to study medicine at Paris, and was subsequently appointed chief physician to the hospital at Burgos, in Spain. After an attack of typhus he returned in 1809 to France, where he devoted himself to the study of the natural sciences.

==Contributions==
His scientific publications were numerous, and covered a wide field, but his most noteworthy work was embryological. His &quot;Recherches sur l&#x27;accroissement et la reproduction des végétaux&quot;, published in the &quot;Mémoires du museum d&#x27;histoire naturelle&quot; for 1821, procured him in that year the French Academy&#x27;s prize for experimental physiology. In 1837 appeared his &quot;Mémoires pour servir a l&#x27;histoire anatomique et physiologique des végétaux et des animaux&quot;, a collection of all his more important biological papers.

He investigated and described osmosis, respiration, embryology, and the effect of light on plants. He has been given credit for discovering cell biology and cells in plants and the actual discovery of the process of osmosis. His early researches into the voice introduced the first modern concept of vocal cord movement.

The Mauritian plant genus &quot;Trochetia&quot; was named in his honour.
