<text>Albert Gleizes (; 8 December 1881 – 23 June 1953) was a French artist, theoretician, philosopher, a self-proclaimed founder of Cubism and an influence on the School of Paris. Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger wrote the first major treatise on Cubism, &quot;Du &quot;Cubisme&quot;&quot;, 1912. Gleizes was a founding member of the Section d&#x27;Or group of artists. He was also a member of &quot;Der Sturm&quot;, and his many theoretical writings were originally most appreciated in Germany, where especially at the Bauhaus his ideas were given thoughtful consideration. Gleizes spent four crucial years in New York, and played an important role in making America aware of modern art. He was a member of the Society of Independent Artists, founder of the Ernest-Renan Association, and both a founder and participant in the Abbaye de Créteil. Gleizes exhibited regularly at Léonce Rosenberg&#x27;s &quot;Galerie de l’Effort Moderne&quot; in Paris; he was also a founder, organizer and director of Abstraction-Création. From the mid-1920s to the late 1930s much of his energy went into writing, e.g., &quot;La Peinture et ses lois&quot; (Paris, 1923), &quot;Vers une conscience plastique: La Forme et l’histoire&quot; (Paris, 1932) and &quot;Homocentrisme&quot; (Sablons, 1937).

==Early life==
Born Albert Léon Gleizes and raised in Paris, he was the son of a fabric designer who ran a large industrial design workshop. He was also the nephew of Léon Comerre, a successful portrait painter who won the 1875 Prix de Rome. The young Albert Gleizes did not like school and often skipped classes to idle away the time writing poetry and wandering through the nearby Montmartre cemetery. Finally, after completing his secondary schooling, Gleizes spent four years in the 72nd Infantry Regiment of the French army (Abbeville, Picardie) then began pursuing a career as a painter. Gleizes began to paint self-taught around 1901 in the Impressionist tradition. His first landscapes from around Courbevoie appear particularly inspired by Alfred Sisley or Camille Pissarro. Although clearly related to Pissarro in technique, Gleizes&#x27; particular view-points as well as the composition and conception of early works represent a clear departure from the style of late Impressionism. The density with which these works are painted and their solid framework suggest affinities with Divisionism which were often noted by early critics.

Gleizes was only twenty-one years of age when his work titled &quot;La Seine à Asnières&quot; was exhibited at the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts in 1902. The following year Gleizes exhibited two paintings at the Salon d&#x27;Automne. In 1905 Gleizes was among the founders of &quot;l&#x27;Association Ernest-Renan&quot;, a union of students opposed to military propaganda. Gleizes was in charge of the &quot;Section littéraire et artistique&quot;, organizing theater productions and poetry readings. At the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Lyon (Salon de la Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts, 1906), Gleizes exhibited &quot;Jour de marché en banlieue&quot;. Tending towards 1907 his work evolved into a Post-Impressionist style with strong Naturalist and Symbolist components.

Gleizes and others decided to create an &quot;association fraternelle d&#x27;artistes&quot; and rent a large house in Créteil. The Abbaye de Créteil was a self-supporting community of artists that aimed to develop their art free of any commercial concerns. For nearly a year, Gleizes along with other painters, poets, musicians and writers, gathered to create. A lack of income forced them to give up their cherished Abbaye de Créteil in early 1908 and Gleizes moved to 7 rue du Delta near Montmartre, Paris, with artists Amedeo Modigliani, , Maurice Drouart and Geo Printemps.

In 1908 Gleizes exhibited at the &quot;Toison d&#x27;Or&quot; in Moscow. The same year, showing a great interest in color and reflecting the transient influence of Fauvism, the work of Gleizes became more synthetic with a proto-Cubist component.

Gleizes&#x27; Fauve-like period was very brief, lasting several months, and even when his paint was thickest and color brightest, his concern for structural rhythms and simplification was dominant. His geometric simplifications at this time were more akin to Pont-Aven School and Les Nabis principles than to Paul Cézanne. His landscapes of 1909 are characterized by the reducing of forms of nature to primary shapes.

During the summer of the same year his style became linear and stripped, broken down into multiple forms and facets with attenuated colors, close to that of the painter Henri Le Fauconnier. In 1910 a group began to form which included Gleizes, Metzinger, Fernand Léger and Robert Delaunay. They met regularly at Henri le Fauconnier&#x27;s studio on rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs, near the Boulevard de Montparnasse. These soirées would often included writers such as Guillaume Apollinaire, , , Paul Fort, Pierre-Jean Jouve, Alexandre Mercereau, Jules Romains and André Salmon. Together with other young painters, the group wanted to emphasise a research into form, in opposition to the Neo-Impressionist emphasis on color. From 1910 onwards, Albert Gleizes was directly involved with Cubism, both as an artist and a principal theorist of the movement.

==Cubism==

===The crucial years===
Gleizes&#x27; involvement in Cubism saw him exhibit at the twenty-sixth Salon des Indépendants in 1910. He showed his &quot;Portrait de René Arcos&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Arbre&quot;, two paintings in which the emphasis on simplified form had already begun to overwhelm the representational interest of the paintings. The same tendency is evident in Jean Metzinger&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of Apollinaire&quot; in the same Salon. When Louis Vauxcelles wrote his initial review of the Salon, he made a passing and imprecise reference to Gleizes, Jean Metzinger, Robert Delaunay, Fernand Léger and Henri le Fauconnier, as &quot;ignorant geometers, reducing the human body, the site, to pallid cubes.&quot;

Guillaume Apollinaire, in his account of the same salon at the Grand Palais (in &quot;L&#x27;Intransigeant&quot;, 18 March 1910) remarked &quot;with joy&quot; that the general sense of the exhibition signifies &quot;La déroute de l&#x27;impressionnisme,&quot; in reference to the works of a conspicuous group of artists (Gleizes, Delaunay, Le Fauconnier, Metzinger, André Lhote and Marie Laurencin). In Gleizes&#x27; paintings of the crucial year 1910, writes Daniel Robbins, &quot;we see the artist&#x27;s volumetric approach to Cubism and his successful union of a broad field of vision with a flat picture plane. [...] The effort to grasp the intricate rhythms of a panorama resulted in a comprehensive geometry of intersecting and overlapping forms which created a new and more dynamic quality of movement.

Gleizes exhibited at the 1910 Salon d&#x27;Automne with the same artists, followed by the first organized group showing by Cubists, in &quot;Salle 41&quot; of the 1911 Salon des Indépendants (&quot;La Femme aux Phlox (Woman with Phlox)&quot;) together with Metzinger, Delaunay, Le Fauconnier and Léger. The result was a public scandal which brought Cubism for the first time to the attention of the general public (in contrast, Picasso and Braque were exhibiting in a private gallery and selling to a small circle of connoisseurs). In a review of the 1911 Indépendants published in Le Petit Parisien (23 April 1911), critic Jean Claude writes:
:Then there is Le Fauconnier, who, jealous of the Cubist Metzinger, became trapezoid… and painted something of the sort he titled, I think, &quot;L’Abondance&quot;… Metzinger himself painted nudes thatlook like puzzles, the pieces of which are cubes of various sizes; F. Léger lacking originality, adopted stove pipes [tuyau de poêle] as a means of reproduction of the human figure… The other, which I have never been able to guess the name, uses small checkerboards, gray and white, white and black, gray and brown, pink and black, and painted an Eiffel Tower flanked on the ground undoubtedly to crush houses, which, while dancing the cancan, stuffed their chimneys through the windows. A talented artist, Albert Gleizes, also allowed himself to try a trianguliste representation of the human figure. This is sad, deeply.

At the 1911 Salon d&#x27;Automne (room 8), Gleizes exhibited his &quot;Portrait de Jacques Nayral&quot; and &quot;La Chasse (The Hunt)&quot;, with, in addition to the group of &quot;Salle 41&quot;, André Lhote, Marcel Duchamp, Jacques Villon, Roger de La Fresnaye and André Dunoyer de Segonzac. In the fall of that year, though the intermediary of Apollinaire, he met Pablo Picasso for the first time and joined the Puteaux Group which held meetings in the studio of Jacques Villon (Gaston Duchamp) and also included Villon&#x27;s brothers, Raymond Duchamp-Villon and Marcel Duchamp, amongst others. Many of these artists also frequented the cafés Le Dôme, La Closerie des Lilas, La Rotonde, Le Select, and La Coupole in Montparnasse.

&quot;People crowded into our room, they shouted, they laughed, they got worked up, they protested, they luxuriated in all kinds of utterances&quot;. (Albert Gleizes, on the Salon d&#x27;Automne exhibition of 1911)

Gleizes exhibited his &quot;Les Baigneuses (The Bathers)&quot; at the 1912 Salon des Indépendants; a show marked by Marcel Duchamp&#x27;s &quot;Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2&quot;, which itself caused a scandal even amongst the Cubists (Duchamp removed the painting before the opening of the exhibition). This was followed by a group show at the Galeries Dalmau in Barcelona, the first exhibition of Cubism in Spain, another exhibit in Moscow (Valet de Carreau), the Salon de la Société Normande in Rouen, and the Salon de la Section d&#x27;Or, October 1912 at the Galerie de la Boétie in Paris.

From 1911 through 1912, drawing to some extent on theories of Henri Poincaré, Ernst Mach, Charles Henry and Henri Bergson, Gleizes began to represent &quot;the object, no longer considered from a specific point of view, but rebuilt following a selection of successive viewpoints&quot; (i.e., as if viewed simultaneously from numerous viewpoints, and in four-dimensions). This technique of relative motion is pushed to its highest degree of complexity in the monumental &quot;Le Dépiquage des Moissons (Harvest Threshing)&quot; (1912). This ambitious work, with Delaunay&#x27;s &quot;La Ville de Paris&quot; (&quot;City of Paris&quot;), is one of the largest paintings in the history of Cubism.
At the Salon d&#x27;Automne of 1912 Gleizes exhibited &quot;L&#x27;Homme au Balcon (Man on a Balcony)&quot;, now at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The Cubist contribution to the 1912 Salon d&#x27;Automne created a controversy in the Municipal Council of Paris, leading to a debate in the Chambre des Députés about the use of public funds to provide the venue for such barbaric art. The Cubists were defended by the Socialist deputy, Marcel Sembat. Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger, in preparation for the Salon de la Section d&#x27;Or, published a major defence of Cubism, resulting in the first theoretical essay on the new movement, entitled &quot;Du &quot;Cubisme&quot;&quot; (published by Eugène Figuière in 1912, translated to English and Russian in 1913).

===Theory===

In &quot;Du &quot;Cubisme&quot;&quot; Gleizes and Metzinger wrote: &quot;If we wished to relate the space of the [Cubist] painters to geometry, we should have to refer it to the non-Euclidean mathematicians; we should have to study, at some length, certain of Riemann&#x27;s theorems.&quot; Cubism itself, then, was not based on any geometrical theory, but corresponded better to non-Euclidean geometry than classical or Euclidean geometry. The essential was in the understanding of space other than by the classical method of perspective; an understanding that would include and integrate the fourth dimension. Cubism, with its new geometry, its dynamism and multiple view-point perspective, not only represented a departure from Euclid&#x27;s model, but it achieved, according to Gleizes and Metzinger, a better representation of the real world: one that was mobile and changing in time. For Gleizes, Cubism represented a &quot;&quot;normal evolution of an art that was mobile like life itself&quot;.&quot;
In contrast to Picasso and Braque, Gleizes&#x27; intent was not to analyze and describe visual reality. Gleizes had argued that we cannot know the external world, we can only know our &quot;sensations&quot;. Objects from daily life⎯guitar, pipe or bowl of fruit⎯ did not satisfy his complex idealistic concepts of the physical world. His subjects were of vast scale and of provocative social and cultural meaning. Gleizes&#x27; iconography (as of Delaunay, Le Fauconnier and Léger) helps to explain why there is no period in his work corresponding to analytic Cubism, and how it was possible for Gleizes to become an abstract painter, more theoretically in tune with Kandinsky and Mondrian than Picasso and Braque, who remained associated with visual reality.

Gleizes&#x27; intent was to reconstitute and synthesize the real world according to his individual consciousness (&quot;sensations&quot;), through the use of volumes to convey the solidity and structure of objects. Their weight, placement and effects upon each other, and the inseparability of form and color, was one of the principal lessons of Cézanne. Forms were simplified and distorted, each shape and color modified by another, rather than splintered. His concern was to establish weight, density and volumetric relationships among sections of a broad subject. Gleizes himself characterized the 1910–11 phase of his work as an &quot;analysis of volume relationships,&quot; though it bears little relation to the traditional use of the word &quot;analytical&quot; in our understanding of Cubism.

&quot;We laugh out loud when we think of all the novices who expiate their literal understanding of the remarks of a cubist and their faith in absolute truth by laboriously placing side by side the six faces of a cube and both ears of a model seen in profile.&quot; (Albert Gleizes, Jean Metzinger)
A central theme of &quot;Du &quot;Cubisme&quot;&quot; was that access to the true essence of the world could be gained by &quot;sensations&quot; alone. The sensation offered by classical painting was very limited: to only one point of view, from a single point in space and frozen in time. But the real world is mobile, both spatially and temporally. Classical perspective and the formulations of Euclidean geometry were only &quot;conventions&quot; (to use Poincaré&#x27;s term) that distance us from the truth of our sensations, from the truth of our own human nature. Man sees the world of natural phenomena from a multitude of angles that form a continuum of sensations in perpetual and continuous change. The Cubists&#x27; aim was to completely eschew absolute space and time in favor of relative motion, to grasp through sensory appearances and translate onto a flat canvas the dynamical properties of the four-dimensional manifold (the natural world). Only then could one achieve a better representation of the mobile reality of our living experience. If Gleizes and Metzinger write in Du &quot;Cubisme&quot; that we can only know our sensations, it is not because they wish to disregard them, but, on the contrary, to understand them more deeply as the primary source for their own work. In reasoning this way, Gleizes and Metzinger demonstrate that they are successors to Cézanne, who insists that everything must be learnt from nature: &quot;Nature seen and nature felt... both of which must unite in order to endure.&quot;

===1913–1918===



In February 1913, Gleizes and other artists introduced the new style of European modern art to an American audience at the Armory Show (International Exhibition of Modern Art) in New York City, Chicago and Boston. In addition to &quot;Man on a balcony (l&#x27;Homme au Balcon)&quot; no. 196, Gleizes exhibited at the Armory Show his 1910 &quot;Femme aux Phlox (Woman with Phlox)&quot;, Museum of Fine Arts, Houston.

Gleizes published an article in Ricciotto Canudo&#x27;s &quot;Montjoie!&quot; entitled &quot;Cubisme et la tradition&quot;. It was through the intermediary of Canudo that Gleizes would meet the artist Juliette Roche; a childhood friend of Jean Cocteau and daughter of Jules Roche, an influential politician of the 3rd Republic.

With the outbreak of World War I, Albert Gleizes re-enlisted in the French army. He was put in charge of organizing entertainment for the troops and as a result was approached by Jean Cocteau to design the set and costumes for the William Shakespeare play, &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, along with Georges Valmier.

Discharged from the military in the fall of 1915, Gleizes and his new wife, Juliette Roche, moved to New York, where they would meet regularly with Francis Picabia, Man Ray, Marcel Duchamp and Jean Crotti (who would eventually marry Suzanne Duchamp). It is at this time that Gleizes witnessed, with a critical eye, the readymades of Marcel Duchamp. After a short stay at the Albemarle Hotel Gleizes and his wife settled at 103 West Street, where Gleizes painted a series of works inspired by jazz music, skyscrapers, luminous signs and the Brooklyn Bridge. Here Gleizes met Stuart Davis, Max Weber, Joseph Stella, and participated in a show at Montross Gallery with Duchamp, Crotti and Metzinger (who remained in Paris)

From New York City, the couple sailed to Barcelona where they were joined by Marie Laurencin, Francis Picabia and his wife. The group spent the summer painting at the resort area of Tossa de Mar and in November Gleizes opened his first solo exhibition, at the Galeries Dalmau in Barcelona, 29 November – 12 December 1916. Returning to New York city in 1917, Gleizes began writing poetic sketches in verse and in prose, some of which were published in Picabia&#x27;s Dada periodical 391. Both Gleizes and his wife traveled from New York to Bermuda in September 1917, where he painted a number of landscapes. When the war in Europe ended they returned to France where his career evolved more towards teaching through writing and he became involved with the committee of the &quot;Unions Intellectuelles Françaises&quot;.

During the winter of 1918 at the Gleizes&#x27; rented house in Pelham New York, writes Daniel Robbins, Albert Gleizes came to his wife and said, &quot;A terrible thing has happened to me: I believe I am finding God.&quot; This new religious conviction resulted not from any mystical visions but instead from Gleizes&#x27; rational confrontation of three urgent problems: collective order, individual differences and the painter&#x27;s role. Although Gleizes did not join the Church until 1941, his next twenty-five years were spent in a logical effort not only to find God but also to have faith.

From 1914 and extending to the end of the New York period, Gleizes&#x27; nonrepresentational paintings and those with an apparent visual basis existed side by side, differing only, writes Daniel Robbins, in &quot;the degree of abstraction hidden by the uniformity with which they were painted and by the constant effort to tie the plastic realization of the painting to a specific, even unique, experience.&quot; Gleizes approached abstraction conceptually rather than visually and in 1924 his intricate dialectic caused him to produce two amusing paintings which departed from his usual subject matter: the Imaginary Still Lifes, Blue and Green. In effect, writes Robbins, &quot;Gleizes would have inverted Courbet&#x27;s &quot;Show me an angel and I will paint you an angel&quot; to be &quot;As long as an angel remains an unembodied ideal and cannot be shown to me, I&#x27;ll paint it.&quot;

==Interwar period==

By 1919 the pre-war sense of the Cubist movement had been virtually shattered. Paris was overshadowed by a strong reaction against those visions of common effort and revolutionary construction which Gleizes continued to embrace, while the avant-garde was characterized by the anarchic and, to him, destructive spirit of Dada. Neither alternative held any appeal for him and, with the Salons dominated by a return to classicism, his old hostility to Paris was constantly nourished. Gleizes&#x27; attempt to resuscitate the spirit of the Section d&#x27;Or was met with great difficulty, despite support by Alexander Archipenko, Georges Braque and Léopold Survage. His own organizational efforts were directed towards the re-establishment of a European-wide movement of abstract artists in the form of a large travelling exhibition, the &quot;Exposition de la Section d’Or&quot;, in 1920; it was not the success he had hoped for. Cubism was passé for younger artists, although Gleizes, on the contrary, felt that only its preliminary phase had been investigated.

It was the revival of the Section d&#x27;Or which ensured that Cubism in general and Gleizes in particular would become Dada&#x27;s preferred target. Similarly, an effort to organize an artists&#x27; cooperative received the support of Robert Delaunay, but of no other major artists. The polemic resulted in the publication of &quot;Du cubisme et des moyens de le comprendre&quot; by Albert Gleizes, followed in 1922 by &quot;Painting and its Laws (La Peinture et ses lois)&quot;, within which appear the notion of &quot;translation&quot; and &quot;rotation&quot; that would ultimately characterize both the pictorial and theoretical aspects of Gleizes&#x27; art. His post-Cubist style of the twenties—flat, forthright, uncompromising—is virtually Blaise Pascal&#x27;s &quot;Spirit of Geometry.&quot;

Gleizes was in nearly every sense a maverick Cubist, perhaps the most unyielding of them all; both in his paintings and writings (which had a big impact on the image of Cubism in Europe and the United States). He developed a single-minded, thoroughly uncompromising Cubism without the diversion of a classical alternative. During the 1920s Gleizes worked on a highly abstract brand of Cubism. In addition to his shows at Léonce Rosenberg&#x27;s L&#x27;Effort Moderne, the dealer-publisher Povolozky printed his writings. His art was indeed backed by a prodigious theoretical effluence, most notably in &quot;La Peinture et ses lois&quot; (first published in &quot;La Vie des Lettres&quot;, October 1922). Gleizes fused aesthetic, metaphysical, moral and social priorities to describe the status and function of art.

===Painting and its Laws===
In &quot;La Peinture et ses lois&quot; writes Robbins, &quot;Gleizes deduced the rules of painting from the picture plane, its proportions, the movement of the human eye and the laws of the universe. This theory, later referred to as &quot;translation-rotation&quot;, ranks with the writings of Mondrian and Malevich as one of the most thorough expositions of the principles of abstract art, which in his case entailed the rejection not only of representation but also of geometric forms.&quot; Flat planes were set in motion simultaneously to evoke space by shifting across one another, as if rotating and tilting on oblique axes. Diagrams entitled &quot;Simultaneous movements of rotation and shifting of the plane on its axis&quot; were published to illustrate the concept.

Gleizes undertook the task of writing the characterizations of these principles in &quot;Painting and its Laws&quot; (&quot;La Peinture et ses lois&quot;), published by gallery owner Jacques Povolozky in the journal &quot;La Vie des lettres et des arts&quot;, 1922–23, as a book in 1924, and reproduced in Léonce Rosenberg&#x27;s &quot;Bulletin de l&#x27;Effort moderne&quot;, no. 13, March 1925, no. 14, April 1925.

One of Gleizes&#x27;s primary objectives was to answer the questions: How will the planar surface be animated, and by what logical method, independent of the artists &quot;fantaisie&quot;, can it be attained?

The approach:
Gleizes bases these laws both on truisms inherent throughout the history of art, and especially on his own experience since 1912, such as: &quot;The primary goal of art has never been exterior imitation&quot; (p. 31); &quot;Artworks come from emotion... the product of individual sensibility and taste&quot; (p. 42); &quot;The artist is always in a state of emotion, sentimental exaltation [ivresse]&quot; (p. 43); &quot;The painting in which the idea of abstract creation is realized is no longer an anecdote, but a concrete fact&quot; (p. 56); &quot;Creating a painted artwork is not the emission of an opinion&quot; (p. 59); &quot;The plastic dynamism will be born out of rhythmic relations between objects... establishing novel plastic liaisons between purely objective elements that compose the painting&quot; (p. 22).

Continuing, Gleizes states that the &#x27;reality&#x27; of a painting is not that of a mirror, but of the object... issue of imminent logic (p. 62). &#x27;The subject-pretext tending toward numeration, inscribed following the nature of the plane, attains a tangent intersections between known images of the natural world and unknown images that reside within intuition&#x27; (p. 63).

Defining the laws:
Rhythm and space are for Gleizes the two vital conditions. Rhythm is a consequence of the continuity of certain phenomena, variable or invariable, following from mathematical relations. Space is a conception of the human psyche that follows from quantitative comparisons (pp. 35, 38, 51). This mechanism is the foundation for artistic expression. It is therefore both a philosophical and scientific synthesis. For Gleizes, Cubism was a means to arrive not only at a new mode of expression but above all a new way of thinking. This was, according to art historian , the foundation of both a new species of painting and an alternative relationship with the world; hence another principle of civilization.

The problem set out by Gleizes was to replace &quot;anecdote&quot; as a starting point for the work of art, by the sole means of using the elements of the painting itself: line, form and color.

Beginning with a central rectangle, taken as an example of elementary form, Gleizes points out two mechanical ways of juxtaposing form to create a painting: (1) either by reproducing the initial form (employing various symmetries such as reflectional, rotational or translational), or by modifying (or not) its dimensions. (2) By displacement of the initial form; pivoting around an imaginary axis in one direction or another.

The choice of position (through translation and/or rotation), though based on the inspiration of the artist, is no longer attributed to the anecdotal. An objective and rigorous method, independent of the painter, replaces emotion or sensibility in the determination the placement of form, that is through &quot;translation&quot; and &quot;rotation&quot;.

Schematic illustrations:

Space and rhythm, according to Gleizes, are perceptible by the extent of movement (displacement) of planar surfaces. These elemental transformations modify the position and importance of the initial plane, whether they converge or diverge (&#x27;recede&#x27; or &#x27;advance&#x27;) from the eye, creating a series of new and separate spatial planes appreciable physiologically by the observer.

Another movement is added to the first movement of translation of the plane to one side: Rotation of the plane. Fig. I shows the resulting formation that follows from simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the initial plane produced on the axis. Fig II and Fig. III represent the simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the rectangle, inclined to the right and to the left. The axis point at which movement is realized is established by the observer. Fig. IV represents the simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the rectangle plane, with the position of the eye of the observed displaced left of the axis. Displacement toward the right (though not represented) is straightforward enough to imagine.

With these figures Gleizes attempts to present, under the most simple conditions possible (simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the plane), the creation of a spatial and rhythmic organism (Fig. VIII), with practically no initiative taken on the part of the artist who controls the evolutionary process. The planar surfaces of Fig. VIII are filled with hatching espousing the &#x27;direction&#x27; of the planes. What emerges in the inert plane, according to Gleizes, through the movement followed by the eye of the observer, is &quot;a visible imprint of successive stages of which the initial rhythmic cadence coordinated a succession of differing states&quot;. These successive stages permit the perception of space. The initial state, by consequence of the transformation, has become a spatial and rhythmic organism.

Fig. I and Fig. II obtain mechanically, Gleizes writes, with minimal personal initiative, a &quot;plastic spatial and rhythmic system&quot;, by the conjugation of simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the plane and from the movements of translation of the plane to one side. The result is a spatial and rhythmic organism more &quot;complex&quot; than shown in Fig. VIII; demonstrating through mechanical, purely plastic means, the realization of a material universe independent of intentional intervention by the artist. This is sufficient to demonstrate, according to Gleizes, the &quot;possibilities of the plane&quot; to serve spatially and rhythmically by its own power. [&quot;L&#x27;exposé hâtif de cette mécanique purement plastique aboutissant à la réalisation d&#x27;un univers matériel en dehors de l&#x27;intervention particulière intentionnelle, suffit à démontrer la &quot;possibilité du plan&quot; de signifier spatialement et rythmiquement par sa seule puissance&quot;].

Gleizes&#x27; painting of 1920–1922, submitted to the same rigor, were not Cubist in any conventional sense; but they &quot;were&quot; Cubist in their concern with planimetric space, and in their relationship (synthesis) with subject-matter. Indeed, the abstract appearance of these compositions is misleading. Gleizes had always remained committed to synthesis. He described how artists had freed themselves from the &#x27;subject-image&#x27; as a pretext to work from the &#x27;subjectless-image&#x27; (nebulous forms) until they came together. The images known from the natural world combined with those nebulous forms were made &#x27;spiritually human&#x27;. Though Gleizes considered his works as initially nonrepresentational and only afterwards as denotational.

Before World War I, Gleizes had always been identified as a Cubist avant-garde. And during the twenties he continued to hold a prominent position, but he was no longer identified with the avant-garde since Cubism had been superseded by Dada and Surrealism. Even after historians began their attempts to analyze the vital role played by Cubism, the name of Albert Gleizes was always mentioned because of his early and important participation in the movement. Gleizes had never ceased to call himself a Cubist and theoretically a Cubist he remained. In many ways his theories were close to those developed by Mondrian, though his paintings never submitted to the discipline of primary colors and the right angle; they were not Neo-Plastic (or De Stijl) in character. In fact, his works from the late 1920s through the 1940s looked like nothing else that was being done, and indeed, they were rarely seen in the art world because Gleizes deliberately distanced himself from extensive participation in the Parisian scene.

Gleizes realized that his evolution towards &#x27;purity&#x27; carried with it the risk of alienation from the &#x27;mentality of the milieu&#x27;, but he saw it as the sole means of arriving at a new type of art that could reach a mass audience (just as the French murals of the 11th and 12th centuries). In &quot;Du Cubisme et les moyens de comprendre&quot; (1920), Gleizes went so far as to envisage the mass-production of painting; as a means of undermining the market system and thus the status of artworks as commodities. &#x27;The multiplication of pictures,&#x27; Gleizes wrote, &#x27;strikes at the heart of the understanding and the economic notions of the bourgeois.&#x27;

===1920s–1930s===

After World War I, with the support given by the dealer Léonce Rosenberg, Cubism returned as a central issue for artists. With the Salons dominated by a return to classicism, Gleizes attempted to resuscitate the spirit of the Section d&#x27;Or in 1920 but was met with great difficulty, despite support by Fernand Léger, Alexander Archipenko, Georges Braque, Constantin Brâncuși, Henri Laurens, Jacques Villon, Raymond Duchamp-Villon, Louis Marcoussis and Léopold Survage. Gleizes&#x27; organizational efforts were directed towards the establishment of a European-wide movement of Cubist and abstract art in the form of a large traveling exhibition; the &quot;Exposition de la Section d’Or&quot;. The idea was to bring together a collection of works that revealed the complete process of transformation and renewal that had taken place. It was not the success he had hoped for. Cubism was seen as passé for emerging artists and other established artists such as Marcel Duchamp and Picabia, although Gleizes, on the contrary, felt that only its preliminary phase had been investigated.

In addition to Cubists works (which already represented a wide variety of styles), the second edition of the Section d&#x27;Or held at the Galerie La Boétie from 5 March 1920 included De Stijl, Bauhaus, Constructivism and Futurism. It was the revival of the Section d&#x27;Or which ensured that Cubism in general would become Dada&#x27;s preferred target. The new polemic resulted in the publication of &quot;Du cubisme et des moyens de le comprendre&quot; by Gleizes, followed in 1922 by &quot;La Peinture et ses lois&quot;.

Following the death of Jules Roche, the Gleizes&#x27; had enough independent income and real estate to pursue their goals without bowing to material considerations, unlike many other artists. The Gleizes&#x27; spent more and more time at the family home in Serrières, in Cavalaire, and an even quieter location on the French Riviera, both associating with people more sympathetic to their social ideas. Gleizes became active in the &quot;Union Intellectuelle&quot; and lectured extensively in France, Germany, Poland and England, while continuing to write. In 1924–25 the Bauhaus (where certain ideals analogous to his own were practiced) requested a new book on Cubism (as part of a series which included Wassily Kandinsky&#x27;s &quot;Point and Line to Plane&quot;, Paul Klee&#x27;s &quot;Pedagogical Notebooks&quot;, and Kasimir Malevich&#x27;s &quot;The Non-Objective World&quot;). Gleizes, in response, would write &quot;Kubismus&quot; (published in 1928) for the collection of Bauhausbücher 13, Munich. The publication of Kubismus in French the following year would bring Gleizes closer to Delaunay. In 1924 Gleizes, Léger and Amédée Ozenfant opened &quot;Académie Moderne&quot;.

In 1927, still dreaming of the communal days at the Abbaye de Créteil, Gleizes founded an artist&#x27;s colony at a rented house called the &quot;&quot; in Sablons near his wife&#x27;s family home in Serrières in the Ardèche département in the Rhône Valley.

Léonce Rosenberg, in 1929, commissioned Gleizes (replacing Gino Severini) to paint decorative panels for his Parisian residence, which would be installed in 1931. The same year Gleizes was part of the committee of Abstraction-Création (founded by Theo van Doesburg, Auguste Herbin, Jean Hélion and Georges Vantongerloo) that acted as a forum for international non-representational art, and counteracted the influence of the Surrealist group led by André Breton. By this time, his work reflected the strengthening of his religious convictions and his 1932 book, &quot;Vers une conscience plastique, La Forme et l’histoire&quot; examines Celtic, Romanesque, and Oriental art. On tour in Poland and Germany, he gave lectures titled &quot;Art et Religion, Art et Production&quot; and &quot;Art et Science&quot; and wrote a book on Robert Delaunay but it was never published.
In 1934 Gleizes began a series of paintings that would continue for several years, in which three levels are identified: &quot;static translation&quot;, corresponding to his researches of the 1920s; &quot;mobile rotation&quot;, corresponding to his researches into coloured cadences of the late 1920s and early 1930s; and &quot;simple grey arcs&quot; which, Gleizes argues, gives the &#x27;form&#x27; or unifying &#x27;rhythm&#x27; of the painting. The level of &#x27;translation&#x27; is generally a geometrical figure evoking a representational image, unlike the work of the early 1930s. These works no longer articulate the strict non-representation of &quot;Abstraction Création&quot;. Léonce Rosenberg—who had already published Gleizes extensively in his &quot;Bulletin de l&#x27;Effort Moderne&quot;, but had not previously shown much enthusiasm for his painting—was deeply impressed by Gleizes&#x27; paintings (which followed from his 1934 research) at the Salon d&#x27;Automne. This was the beginning of a close relationship with Gleizes, which continued through the 1930s and is reflected in a stream of correspondence.

In 1937, Gleizes was commissioned to paint murals for the Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne at the Paris World&#x27;s Fair. He collaborated with the Delaunays in the &quot;Pavillon de l&#x27;Air&quot; and with Léopold Survage and Fernand Léger for the &quot;Pavillon de l&#x27;Union des Artistes Modernes&quot;. At the end of 1938, Gleizes volunteered to participate in the free seminars and discussion groups for young painters set up by Robert Delaunay at his Paris studio. Then Gleizes, in collaboration with Jacques Villon, conceived the idea of executing a mural for the auditorium of the École des Arts et Métiers; the latter was rejected by the school authorities as too abstract, but immense panels by Gleizes survive as &quot;Four Legendary Figures of the Sky&quot; (San Antonio, TX, McNay A. Inst.). Other examples of this ambitious public style include &quot;The Transfiguration&quot; (1939–41; Lyon, Mus. B.-A.).
In the late 1930s, the wealthy American art connoisseur Peggy Guggenheim purchased a great deal of the new art in Paris including works by Albert Gleizes. She brought these works to the United States which today form part of the Peggy Guggenheim Collection.

===Religious Influence===
 Despite his admiration for the Western Christian tradition and the early medieval church, Gleizes did not join the Roman Catholic Church until 1941. Gleizes believed that the church had lost its &quot;spirit&quot; since the rise of scholastic philosophy and representational art in the thirteenth century. However, in 1941, he soon came to believe that the sacraments were still true and effective, despite some intellectual deviations. 

===World War II and after===
During World War II, Gleizes and his wife remained in France under the German occupation. In 1942 Gleizes began the series of &quot;Supports de Contemplation&quot;, large scale, entirely non-representational paintings that are both very complex and very serene. Materials being difficult to obtain during the war, Gleizes painted on burlap, sizing the porous material with a mixture of glue and paint. He had used burlap in some of his earliest paintings and now found it favorable to his vigorous touch, for it took the most powerful strokes even while preserving the matte surface he so valued. In 1952, Gleizes realized his last major work, a fresco titled &quot;Eucharist&quot; that he painted for a Jesuit chapel in Chantilly.

Albert Gleizes died in Avignon in the Vaucluse département on 23 June 1953 and was interred in his wife&#x27;s family mausoleum in the cemetery at Serrières.

==Art market==
In 2010, &quot;Le Chemin (Paysage à Meudon)&quot; (1911), oil on canvas, 146.4 x 114.4 cm, sold for 1,833,250 GBP ($2,683,878, or 2,198,983 Euros) at Christie&#x27;s, London.

==Legacy==
&quot;Gleizes&#x27; individual development, his unique struggle to reconcile forces,&quot; writes Daniel Robbins, &quot;made him one of the few painters to come out of Cubism with a wholly individual style, undeflected by later artistic movements. Although he occasionally returned to earlier subjects... these later works were treated anew, on the basis of fresh insights. He never repeated his earlier styles, never remained stationary, but always grew more intense, more passionate. [...] His life ended in 1953 but his paintings remain to testify to his willingness to struggle for final answers. His is an abstract art of deep significance and meaning, paradoxically human even in his very search for absolute order and truth.&quot; (Daniel Robbins, 1964)

==Commemoration==
In celebration of the 100th anniversary of the publication of &quot;Du &quot;Cubisme&quot;&quot; by Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger, the Musée de La Poste in Paris presented a show entitled &quot;Gleizes – Metzinger. Du cubisme et après&quot;, from 9 May to 22 September 2012. Over 80 paintings and drawings, along with documents, films and 15 works by other members of the Section d&#x27;Or group (Villon, Duchamp-Villon, Kupka, Le Fauconnier, Lhote, La Fresnaye, Survage, Herbin, Marcoussis, Archipenko...) were included in the show. A catalogue in French and English was published for the event. A French postage stamp is issued representing works by Gleizes (&quot;Le Chant de Guerre&quot;, 1915) and Metzinger (&quot;L&#x27;Oiseau Bleu&quot;, 1913). This is the first time that a museum has organized an exhibit showcasing both Gleizes and Metzinger together.

<text>Esther Delisle (born 1954) is a Canadian historian and author.

== Biography ==
Born and raised in Quebec City, she completed her BA and MA in political science at Université Laval and taught political theory at a CEGEP, and also worked as a researcher for &quot;The Fifth Estate&quot; on CBC Television. She then studied for three years at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel before returning to Laval to complete her doctorate, following which she did post-doctoral studies at the department of history at McGill University.

== Delisle–Richler controversy ==
Her doctoral thesis, in which she adduced evidence of a history of antisemitism and support for European fascism among Quebec nationalists of the 1930s, was controversial long before it was published. The book was strongly critical of the nationalist historian Lionel Groulx and the newspaper &quot;Le Devoir&quot;. The normal time for a thesis at Université Laval to be approved was three months; her committee delayed a decision for almost two years, until articles about the delay and the controversy surrounding her work had appeared in the French- and English-language press.

In 1993, she published a book based on her doctoral political science thesis, short-titled &quot;The Traitor and the Jew&quot;. The book aroused considerable hostility; when she appeared at one Quebec bookstore, the manager of the shopping mall cut the electricity to the bookstore in order to interfere with her book signing. (Different versions of this incident appear in Sara Scott, &quot;The Lonely Passion of Esther Delisle&quot;, &quot;Elm Street&quot;, April 1998, p. 97, and Sheli Teitelbaum, &quot;Quebec and French Nazis&quot;, &quot;The Canadian Jewish News&quot;, December 15, 1994, reprinted from &quot;The Jerusalem Report&quot;.) A 2002 documentary film by Eric R. Scott titled &quot;Je me souviens&quot; recounts Delisle&#x27;s story using rare archival footage with speeches and commentaries by some of Quebec&#x27;s leading nationalist figures of the time.

The controversy over whether or not Quebec society is or was antisemitic simplifies her thesis and has obscured the more important themes of her work. For Delisle, Quebecers were not uniformly antisemitic; antisemitism was a disease of Quebec intellectuals rather than of the common people, part and parcel of their condemnation of the vices of liberalism, modernity, urbanism, not to mention movies and jazz music and other aspects of American culture, all of which they saw as dangers to their conception of the ideal Quebec society. She attacks as myth the beliefs put forward by historians such as Lionel Groulx that the Québécois are a racially and ethnically homogeneous group of pure descent from French Catholics who immigrated to New France. She argues that the Quebec intellectuals of the 1930s and 1940s were far less isolated and more deeply influenced by the intellectual currents in Europe, particularly the nationalism of the extreme right, than is described in most Quebec histories of the period.

In 1998, Delisle published, &quot;Myths, Memories and Lies&quot;, an account of how some members of Quebec&#x27;s elite, nationalist and federalist, supported the French Nazi collaborator military officer Philippe Pétain and his Vichy government within German-occupied France during World War II and also helped bring other French collaborators to safety in Quebec after the conflict ended in Europe.

==Criticism==
Historian Gérard Bouchard, who also published a book critical of Lionel Groulx, has been very critical of &quot;The Traitor and the Jew&quot;. In a letter to &quot;Le Devoir&quot;, published on May 1, 2003, he contended that only 14 of 58 quotes of Lionel Groulx in Delisle&#x27;s thesis are accurate, and that the 44 other quotes contain 56 irregularities, including additions and amputations of the text, word replacements that change the meaning, and quotes that are not found in the text where Delisle claims they are. He asserts that the magnitude of inaccuracy discourages him from even considering Delisle&#x27;s work as a basis for his own criticism of Groulx (&quot;Les Deux Chanoines – Contradiction et ambivalence dans la pensée de Lionel Groulx&quot;, 2003). Delisle admitted to 13 irregularities in the references of her book and later corrected citations for some of the disputed quotations.

Bouchard and Delisle agree that Groulx expressed antisemitic opinions. For Bouchard, these opinions do not taint Groulx&#x27;s scholarship or secular Quebec nationalism because Groulx&#x27;s antisemitism is seen as a personal bias unrelated or peripheral to his academic work. Delisle, by contrast, argues that antisemitism is an integral component of Groulx&#x27;s race-based nationalism and his enthusiasm for right-wing authoritarian governments.

<text>Dian Parkinson (born Diana Lynn Batts; November 30, 1944) is an American former actress, model and beauty pageant titleholder. She represented the United States at Miss World 1965 in London, where she placed 1st runner-up. From 1975 to 1993, Parkinson served as a model on &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;.

==Career history==
In 1965, while living in Falls Church, Virginia, Parkinson won the Miss District of Columbia USA title and competed as Diana Batts in the Miss USA 1965 pageant, where she placed fourth runner-up. Parkinson won the 1965 Miss USA World contest. She went on to represent the United States in the international Miss World 1965 contest, and was first runner-up to Lesley Langley of the United Kingdom.

Parkinson travelled during 1965 with the Bob Hope USO Show, including performances in Vietnam during late December 1965, and also served as Queen of the 1965 Bob Hope Desert Classic golf tournament.

In 1975, Parkinson was a guest star on &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; (&quot;Ted&#x27;s Moment of Glory&quot;).

In 1978, Parkinson appeared in the pilot of the TV series &quot;Vega$&quot;.

From 1975 to 1993, Parkinson was a model on the US television game show &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;. Her 18-year tenure on the show was among the longest of any of the models, tied for third with Holly Hallstrom, and third only to Rachel Reynolds, who has been with the show since 2003 and Janice Pennington, who was with the show for more than 28 years.

===Departure from &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;===
Parkinson left the show in 1993, supposedly to &quot;pursue other interests&quot;, as host Bob Barker announced during her final taping, which aired on June 18, 1993.

In 1994, Parkinson filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court (case no. BC106366) against Barker for sexual harassment. The suit was withdrawn in April 1995, with Parkinson claiming it was too costly and had taken a toll on her health.

===&quot;Playboy&quot;===
Parkinson was the cover girl of &quot;Playboy&quot; in December 1991 at the age of 47 and again in May 1993. In 1993, Parkinson was featured exclusively in a &quot;Playboy&quot; &quot;Newsstand Edition&quot; photo magazine entitled &quot;Playboy Presents Dian Parkinson&quot;. Also in 1993, the video &quot;Playboy Celebrity Centrefold: Dian Parkinson&quot; was released.

===&quot;EZ Krunch&quot;===
In 1993, Parkinson was the official spokesperson for the home exercise equipment machine &quot;EZ Krunch&quot;.

===&quot;Space Ghost: Coast to Coast&quot;===
In 1994, Parkinson appeared as a guest on the animated talk show &quot;Space Ghost: Coast to Coast&quot; (&quot;Punch&quot;).

== Personal life ==
In November 2019, Parkinson listed a residence in Westlake Village, California.

<doc id="1162218" wikidata="Q237821" url="?curid=1162218" title="Robert Fogel">
<text>Robert William Fogel (; July 1, 1926 – June 11, 2013) was an American economic historian and winner (with Douglass North) of the 1993 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. As of his death, he was the Charles R. Walgreen Distinguished Service Professor of American Institutions and director of the Center for Population Economics (CPE) at the University of Chicago&#x27;s Booth School of Business. He is best known as an advocate of new economic history (cliometrics) – the use of quantitative methods in history.

==Life and career==
Fogel was born in New York City, the son of Ukrainian Jewish immigrants from Odessa (1922). His brother, six years his senior, was his main intellectual influence in his youth as he listened to him and his college friends intensely discuss social and economic issues of the Great Depression. He graduated from the Stuyvesant High School in 1944. Upon his graduation he found himself with a love for literature and history and aspired for a career in science, but due to an extreme pessimism about the economy in the second half of the 1940s, he shifted his interest towards economics. He was educated at Cornell University, where he majored in history with an economics minor, and became president of the campus branch of American Youth for Democracy, a communist organization. After graduation in 1948, he became a professional organizer for the Communist Party. After working eight years as a professional organizer, he rejected communism as unscientific and attended Columbia University, where he studied under George Stigler and obtained an MA in economics in 1960. He received a PhD from Johns Hopkins University in 1963.

He began his research career as an assistant professor at the University of Rochester in 1960. In 1964 he moved to the University of Chicago as an associate professor. From 1968 to 1975 he was also a visiting professor at Rochester in autumn semesters. During this time he completed some of his most important works, including &quot;Time on the Cross&quot; (in collaboration with Stanley Engerman). He also mentored a large group of students and researchers in economic history, including his colleague Deirdre McCloskey at Chicago. In 1975 he left for Harvard University, and from 1978 on he worked as a research associate under the National Bureau of Economic Research in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 1981 he returned to the University of Chicago, where he directed the newly created Center for Population Economics at the Booth School of Business.

Fogel researched and wrote on numerous fields in his career, including not only economic history but also demographics, physiology, sociology of the family, nutrition, China&#x27;s economic development, philosophy of science, and other related fields. He integrated insights from such diverse fields in his attempts to explain important historical phenomena such as the dramatic fall in mortality rates from the 18th to the 20th century. His former colleague Deirdre McCloskey credits Fogel with &quot;reuniting economics and history&quot;. He advised many students who went on to become prominent economic historians, so that many economic historians in the United States trace their academic lineage to him.

Fogel was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1972, the National Academy of Sciences in 1973, and the American Philosophical Society in 2000. 

Fogel married Enid Cassandra Morgan, an African-American woman, in 1949 and had two children. The couple faced significant difficulties at the time due to anti-miscegenation laws and prevalent sentiments against interracial marriages.

He died on June 11, 2013, in Oak Lawn, Illinois, of a short illness, aged 86.

==Contributions==

===Cliometrics and &quot;Railroads and American Economic Growth&quot;===
Fogel&#x27;s first major study involving cliometrics was &quot;Railroads and American Economic Growth: Essays in Econometric History&quot; (1964). This tract sought to quantify the railroads&#x27; contribution to U.S. economic growth in the 19th century. Its argument and method were each rebuttals to a long line of non-numeric historical arguments that had ascribed much to expansionary effect to railroads without rigorous reference to economic data. Fogel argued against these previous historical arguments to show that onset of the railroad was not indispensable to the American economy. Examining the transportation of agricultural goods, Fogel compared the 1890 economy to a hypothetical 1890 economy in which transportation infrastructure was limited to wagons, canals, and natural waterways. Fogel pointed out that the absence of railroads would have substantially increased transportation costs from farms to primary markets, particularly in the Midwest, and changed the geographic location of agricultural production. Despite this consideration, the overall increase in transportation costs, i.e., the &quot;social savings&quot; attributable to railroads, was small – about 2.7% of 1890 GNP. The potential for substitute technologies, such as a more extensive canal system or improved roads, would have further lowered the importance of railroads. The conclusion that railroads were not indispensable to economic development made a controversial name for cliometrics.

===Slavery and &quot;Time on the Cross&quot;===
Fogel&#x27;s most famous and controversial work is &quot;Time on the Cross&quot; (1974), a two-volume quantitative study of American slavery, co-written with Stanley Engerman. In the book, Fogel and Engerman argued that the system of slavery was profitable for slave owners because they organized plantation production &quot;rationally&quot; to maximize their profits. Due to economies of scale, (the so-called &quot;gang system&quot; of labor on cotton plantations), they argued, Southern slave farms were more productive, per unit of labor, than northern farms. The implications of this, Engerman and Fogel contended, is that slavery in the American South was not quickly going away on its own (as it had in some historical instances such as ancient Rome) because, despite its exploitative nature, slavery was immensely profitable and productive for slave owners. This contradicted the argument of earlier Southern historians.

A portion of &quot;Time on the Cross&quot; focused on how slave owners treated their slaves. Engerman and Fogel argued that because slave owners approached slave production as a business enterprise, there were some limits on the amount of exploitation and oppression they inflicted on the slaves. According to Engerman and Fogel, slaves in the American South lived better than did many industrial workers in the North. Fogel based this analysis largely on plantation records and claimed that slaves worked less, were better fed and whipped only occasionally – although the authors were careful to state explicitly that slaves were still exploited in ways which were not captured by measures available from records. This portion of &quot;Time on the Cross&quot; created a firestorm of controversy, although it was not directly related to the central argument of the book – that Southern slave plantations were profitable for the slave owners and would not have disappeared in the absence of the Civil War. Some criticisms mistakenly considered Fogel an apologist for slavery. In fact, Fogel objected to slavery on moral grounds; he thought that on purely economic grounds, slavery was not unprofitable or inefficient as previous historians such as Ulrich B. Phillips had argued.

===&quot;Without Consent or Contract: The Rise and Fall of American Slavery&quot;===
In 1989 Fogel published &quot;Without Consent or Contract The Rise and Fall of American Slavery&quot; as a response to criticism stemming from what some perceived as the cold and calculating conclusions found in his earlier work, &quot;Time on the Cross&quot;. In it he very clearly spells out a moral indictment of slavery when he references things such as the high infant mortality rate from overworked pregnant women, and the cruel slave hierarchies established by their masters. He does not write so much on what he had already established in his previous work, and instead focuses on how such an economically efficient system was threatened and ultimately abolished. Using the same measurement techniques he used in his previous work, he analyzed a mountain of evidence pertaining to the lives of slaves, but he focuses much more on the social aspects versus economics this time. He both illustrates how incredibly hard and life-threatening the work of a slave was, as well as how they were able to form their own culture as a resistance to slavery. His main point ultimately comes across, though, as he explains how a small group of very vocal and committed Evangelical Christian reformers led the fight against slavery until it became a political force that captured the attention of the President of the United States. His book delves deeply into why some of America&#x27;s most widely respected leaders went from seeing slavery as a highly profitable workforce (which his findings indicate as true) to something that must be abolished on moral grounds.

===&quot;The Fourth Great Awakening&quot;===
In 2000 Fogel published &quot;The Fourth Great Awakening and the Future of Egalitarianism&quot; in which he argued that America has been moving cyclically toward greater equality, largely because of the influence of religion, especially evangelicalism. Building on his work on the demise of slavery, he proposed that since evangelicalism was largely responsible for ending the institution he found to be economically profitable, that religion would continue to fuel America&#x27;s moral development. Fogel diagrammed four &quot;Great Awakenings&quot;, called (by others) &quot;The Fogel Paradigm.&quot; &quot;Fogel&#x27;s paradigm is drawn from what he believes are cycles of ethical challenges America has undergone provoked by technological innovations that create moral crises that, in turn, are resolved by evangelical awakenings.&quot;

===Later work: The Technophysio Evolution===
Fogel was the director of the Center for Population Economics (CPE) at the University of Chicago and the principal investigator of the NIH-funded &quot;Early Indicators of Later Work Levels, Disease and Death&quot; project, which draws on observations from military pension records of over 35,000 Union Army veterans.

Much of Fogel&#x27;s late writing incorporated the concept of technophysio evolution, a process that he described as &quot;the synergism between rapid technological change and the improvement in human physiology.&quot; By using height as a proxy for health and general well-being, Fogel observed dramatic improvements in health, body size, and mortality over the past 200 years. This phenomenon is examined more fully in &quot;The Escape from Hunger and Premature Death, 1700–2100: Europe, America, and the Third World&quot; and &quot;The Changing Body: Health, Nutrition, and Human Development in the Western World since 1700&quot; (both published by Cambridge University Press).

The work of Fogel was largely influenced by the McKeown thesis. Since 1955, the British public health scientist Thomas McKeown had developed a theory that the growth of population since the 18th century can be attributed to a decline in mortality from infectious diseases, largely to a better standard of living, particularly to better nutrition, but later also to better hygiene, and only marginally and late to medicine. The work of Fogel and collaborators provided the necessary evidence that more and better food was the main drive for the reduction in mortality from infectious diseases. As summarized by Noble laureate Angus Deaton (2013, pp 91–92):

==The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences==
In 1993, Robert Fogel received, jointly with fellow economic historian Douglass C. North, the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences &quot;for having renewed research in economic history by applying economic theory and quantitative methods in order to explain economic and institutional change&quot;. In his Nobel lecture, titled &quot;Economic growth, population theory, and physiology: the bearing of long-term processes on the making of economic policy&quot;, he emphasises his work done on the question of nutrition and economic growth.

<text>There are over thirty hospitals located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Many of them are also medical research facilities and teaching schools affiliated with the University of Toronto. Most hospitals are grouped under administrative networks that serve particular neighbourhoods and communities and share a number of medical services. The largest of the networks is University Health Network, which governs four of Canada’s largest research hospitals located across Downtown Toronto. Some hospitals in Toronto operate independently, attracting large funding and public donation due to historic brand value and overall clinical standards.

<doc id="1162222" wikidata="Q505949" url="?curid=1162222" title="Arturo Uslar Pietri">
<text>Arturo Uslar Pietri (16 May 1906 in Caracas – 26 February 2001) was a Venezuelan intellectual, historian, writer, television producer, and politician.

== Life ==
Born on 16 May 1906 in Caracas, Venezuela, his parents were general Arturo Uslar Santamaría and Helena Pietri de Uslar.

The last name Uslar is of German origin and can be traced back to Johann von Uslar, who fought for the rebel cause during Venezuela&#x27;s independence wars. 

As a young boy and then teenager, Arturo lived in various cities in the comparatively urbanised central northern valleys of the country. He moved back to Caracas in 1924 to read political sciences at the Central University of Venezuela, where he graduated Doctor of Political Sciences in 1929. That same year he obtained a law degree.

Uslar led a remarkably fruitful life, influential in Venezuelan politics, historical analysis and literature, and as an educator. His period of activity spanned the last years of Venezuelan Caudillismo, the transition to democracy and most of the democratic era of 1958 - 1999. He held posts such as Secretary for the Venezuelan Delegation at the League of Nations, delegate at the International Labour Organization, minister of education, minister of finance, contributor to the Act of Constitution of the New Democratic Government (1958), ambassador to the United States, professor of Latin American literature at Columbia University, professor of political economics at the Central University of Venezuela, chief editor of a main newspaper, candidate for the Presidency and member of the Royal Spanish Academy.

Uslar Pietri had a lifetime involvement in the Venezuelan media as a cultural figure. He wrote regionally influential essays and novels, of which &quot;The Red Lances&quot;, an account of life during the Venezuelan War of Independence from various social perspectives is arguably the most famous. In his works he championed mestizaje, or miscegenation, as a valuable feature of Latin American culture. His literary output was recognised in 1990 with a Prince of Asturias Award. He was several times nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature.

Uslar Pietri died on 26 February 2001 in Caracas. He had announced his retirement as an author in 1998 and last figured prominently in political debate in 1993.

<text>In statistical mechanics, the Potts model, a generalization of the Ising model, is a model of interacting spins on a crystalline lattice. By studying the Potts model, one may gain insight into the behaviour of ferromagnets and certain other phenomena of solid-state physics. The strength of the Potts model is not so much that it models these physical systems well; it is rather that the one-dimensional case is exactly solvable, and that it has a rich mathematical formulation that has been studied extensively.

The model is named after Renfrey Potts, who described the model near the end of his 1951 Ph.D. thesis. The model was related to the &quot;planar Potts&quot; or &quot;clock model&quot;, which was suggested to him by his advisor, Cyril Domb. The four-state Potts model is sometimes known as the Ashkin–Teller model, after Julius Ashkin and Edward Teller, who considered an equivalent model in 1943.

The Potts model is related to, and generalized by, several other models, including the XY model, the Heisenberg model and the N-vector model. The infinite-range Potts model is known as the Kac model. When the spins are taken to interact in a non-Abelian manner, the model is related to the flux tube model, which is used to discuss confinement in quantum chromodynamics. Generalizations of the Potts model have also been used to model grain growth in metals, coarsening in foams, and statistical properties of proteins. A further generalization of these methods by James Glazier and Francois Graner, known as the cellular Potts model, has been used to simulate static and kinetic phenomena in foam and biological morphogenesis.

== Definition ==

=== Vector Potts model ===
The Potts model consists of &quot;spins&quot; that are placed on a lattice; the lattice is usually taken to be a two-dimensional rectangular Euclidean lattice, but is often generalized to other dimensions and lattice structures.

Originally, Domb suggested that the spin takes one of formula_1 possible values , distributed uniformly about the circle, at angles
: formula_2
where formula_3 and that the interaction Hamiltonian is given by
: formula_4
with the sum running over the nearest neighbor pairs formula_5 over all lattice sites, and formula_6 is a coupling constant, determining the interaction strength. This model is now known as the vector Potts model or the clock model. Potts provided the location in two dimensions of the phase transition for formula_7. In the limit formula_8, this becomes the XY model.

=== Standard Potts model ===
What is now known as the standard Potts model was suggested by Potts in the course of his study of the model above and is defined by a simpler Hamiltonian:
: formula_9
where formula_10 is the Kronecker delta, which equals one whenever formula_11 and zero otherwise.

The formula_12 standard Potts model is equivalent to the Ising model and the 2-state vector Potts model, with formula_13. The formula_14 standard Potts model is equivalent to the three-state vector Potts model, with formula_15.

=== Generalized Potts model ===
A generalization of the Potts model is often used in statistical inference and biophysics, particularly for modelling proteins through direct coupling analysis. This generalized Potts model consists of &#x27;spins&#x27; that each may take on formula_1 states: formula_17 (with no particular ordering). The Hamiltonian is,
: formula_18
where formula_19 is the energetic cost of spin formula_20 being in state formula_21 while spin formula_22 is in state formula_23, and formula_24 is the energetic cost of spin formula_20 being in state formula_21. Note: formula_27. This model resembles the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model in that couplings can be heterogeneous and non-local. There is no explicit lattice structure in this model.

== Physical properties ==
=== Phase transitions ===
Despite its simplicity as a model of a physical system, the Potts model is useful as a model system for the study of phase transitions. For example, for the standard ferromagnetic Potts model in formula_28, a phase transition exists for all real values formula_29, with the critical point at formula_30. The phase transition is continuous (second order) for formula_31 and discontinuous (first order) for formula_32.

For the clock model, there is evidence that the corresponding phase transitions are infinite order BKT transitions, and a continuous phase transition is observed when formula_33. Further use is found through the model&#x27;s relation to percolation problems and the Tutte and chromatic polynomials found in combinatorics. For integer values of formula_34, the model displays the phenomenon of &#x27;interfacial adsorption&#x27; with intriguing critical wetting properties when fixing opposite boundaries in two different states .

=== Relation with the random cluster model ===

The Potts model has a close relation to the Fortuin-Kasteleyn random cluster model, another model in statistical mechanics. Understanding this relationship has helped develop efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for numerical exploration of the model at small formula_1, and led to the rigorous proof of the critical temperature of the model.

At the level of the partition function formula_36, the relation amounts to transforming the sum over spin configurations formula_37 into a sum over edge configurations formula_38 i.e. sets of nearest neighbor pairs of the same color. The transformation is done using the identity 
: formula_39 
This leads to rewriting the partition function as 
: formula_40
where the FK clusters are the connected components of the union of closed segments formula_41. This is proportional to the partition function of the random cluster model with the open edge probability formula_42. An advantage of the random cluster formulation is that formula_1 can be an arbitrary complex number, rather than a natural integer.

Alternatively, instead of FK clusters, the model can be formulated in terms of spin clusters, using the identity 
: formula_44
A spin cluster is the union of neighbouring FK clusters with the same color: two neighbouring spin clusters have different colors, while two neighbouring FK clusters are colored independently.

== Measure-theoretic description ==
The one dimensional Potts model may be expressed in terms of a subshift of finite type, and thus gains access to all of the mathematical techniques associated with this formalism. In particular, it can be solved exactly using the techniques of transfer operators. (However, Ernst Ising used combinatorial methods to solve the Ising model, which is the &quot;ancestor&quot; of the Potts model, in his 1924 PhD thesis). This section develops the mathematical formalism, based on measure theory, behind this solution.

While the example below is developed for the one-dimensional case, many of the arguments, and almost all of the notation, generalizes easily to any number of dimensions. Some of the formalism is also broad enough to handle related models, such as the XY model, the Heisenberg model and the N-vector model.

=== Topology of the space of states ===
Let &quot;Q&quot; = {1, ..., &quot;q&quot;} be a finite set of symbols, and let
: formula_45
be the set of all bi-infinite strings of values from the set &quot;Q&quot;. This set is called a full shift. For defining the Potts model, either this whole space, or a certain subset of it, a subshift of finite type, may be used. Shifts get this name because there exists a natural operator on this space, the shift operator τ : &quot;Q&quot;Z → &quot;Q&quot;Z, acting as
: formula_46

This set has a natural product topology; the base for this topology are the cylinder sets
: formula_47
that is, the set of all possible strings where &quot;k&quot;+1 spins match up exactly to a given, specific set of values ξ0, ..., ξ&quot;k&quot;. Explicit representations for the cylinder sets can be gotten by noting that the string of values corresponds to a &quot;q&quot;-adic number, however the natural topology of the q-adic numbers is finer than the above product topology.

=== Interaction energy ===
The interaction between the spins is then given by a continuous function &quot;V&quot; : &quot;Q&quot;Z → R on this topology. &quot;Any&quot; continuous function will do; for example
: formula_48
will be seen to describe the interaction between nearest neighbors. Of course, different functions give different interactions; so a function of &quot;s&quot;0, &quot;s&quot;1 and &quot;s&quot;2 will describe a next-nearest neighbor interaction. A function &quot;V&quot; gives interaction energy between a set of spins; it is &quot;not&quot; the Hamiltonian, but is used to build it. The argument to the function &quot;V&quot; is an element &quot;s&quot; ∈ &quot;Q&quot;Z, that is, an infinite string of spins. In the above example, the function &quot;V&quot; just picked out two spins out of the infinite string: the values &quot;s&quot;0 and &quot;s&quot;1. In general, the function &quot;V&quot; may depend on some or all of the spins; currently, only those that depend on a finite number are exactly solvable.

Define the function &quot;Hn&quot; : &quot;Q&quot;Z → R as
: formula_49

This function can be seen to consist of two parts: the self-energy of a configuration [&quot;s&quot;0, &quot;s&quot;1, ..., &quot;sn&quot;] of spins, plus the interaction energy of this set and all the other spins in the lattice. The limit of this function is the Hamiltonian of the system; for finite &quot;n&quot;, these are sometimes called the finite state Hamiltonians.

=== Partition function and measure ===
The corresponding finite-state partition function is given by
: formula_50
with &quot;C&quot;0 being the cylinder sets defined above. Here, β = 1/&quot;kT&quot;, where &quot;k&quot; is the Boltzmann constant, and &quot;T&quot; is the temperature. It is very common in mathematical treatments to set β = 1, as it is easily regained by rescaling the interaction energy. This partition function is written as a function of the interaction &quot;V&quot; to emphasize that it is only a function of the interaction, and not of any specific configuration of spins. The partition function, together with the Hamiltonian, are used to define a measure on the Borel σ-algebra in the following way: The measure of a cylinder set, i.e. an element of the base, is given by
: formula_51

One can then extend by countable additivity to the full σ-algebra. This measure is a probability measure; it gives the likelihood of a given configuration occurring in the configuration space &quot;Q&quot;Z. By endowing the configuration space with a probability measure built from a Hamiltonian in this way, the configuration space turns into a canonical ensemble.

Most thermodynamic properties can be expressed directly in terms of the partition function. Thus, for example, the Helmholtz free energy is given by
: formula_52

Another important related quantity is the topological pressure, defined as
: formula_53
which will show up as the logarithm of the leading eigenvalue of the transfer operator of the solution.

=== Free field solution ===
The simplest model is the model where there is no interaction at all, and so &quot;V&quot; = &quot;c&quot; and &quot;Hn&quot; = &quot;c&quot; (with &quot;c&quot; constant and independent of any spin configuration). The partition function becomes
: formula_54

If all states are allowed, that is, the underlying set of states is given by a full shift, then the sum may be trivially evaluated as
: formula_55

If neighboring spins are only allowed in certain specific configurations, then the state space is given by a subshift of finite type. The partition function may then be written as
: formula_56
where card is the cardinality or count of a set, and Fix is the set of fixed points of the iterated shift function:
: formula_57

The &quot;q&quot; × &quot;q&quot; matrix &quot;A&quot; is the adjacency matrix specifying which neighboring spin values are allowed.

=== Interacting model ===
The simplest case of the interacting model is the Ising model, where the spin can only take on one of two values, &quot;sn&quot; ∈ and only nearest neighbor spins interact. The interaction potential is given by
: formula_58

This potential can be captured in a 2 × 2 matrix with matrix elements
: formula_59
with the index σ, σ′ ∈ {−1, 1}. The partition function is then given by
: formula_60

The general solution for an arbitrary number of spins, and an arbitrary finite-range interaction, is given by the same general form. In this case, the precise expression for the matrix &quot;M&quot; is a bit more complex.

The goal of solving a model such as the Potts model is to give an exact closed-form expression for the partition function and an expression for the Gibbs states or equilibrium states in the limit of &quot;n&quot; → ∞, the thermodynamic limit.

== Applications ==
=== Signal and image processing ===
The Potts model has applications in signal reconstruction. Assume that we are given noisy observation of a piecewise constant signal &quot;g&quot; in R&quot;n&quot;. To recover &quot;g&quot; from the noisy observation vector &quot;f&quot; in R&quot;n&quot;, one seeks a minimizer of the corresponding inverse problem, the &quot;Lp&quot;-Potts functional &quot;P&quot;γ(&quot;u&quot;), which is defined by
: formula_61

The jump penalty formula_62 forces piecewise constant solutions and the data term formula_63 couples the minimizing candidate &quot;u&quot; to the data &quot;f&quot;. The parameter γ &gt; 0 controls the tradeoff between regularity and data fidelity. There are fast algorithms for the exact minimization of the &quot;L&quot;1 and the &quot;L&quot;2-Potts functional.

In image processing, the Potts functional is related to the segmentation problem. However, in two dimensions the problem is NP-hard.

<text>Red Lobster Hospitality, LLC is an American casual dining restaurant chain headquartered in Orlando, Florida. The company has operations across most of the United States (including Puerto Rico), and Canada, as well as in Ecuador, Japan, Mexico, and Thailand. Golden Gate Capital was Red Lobster&#x27;s parent company after it was acquired from Darden Restaurants on July 28, 2014. Seafood supplier Thai Union acquired a 25 percent stake in the company in 2016 for a reported $575 million and in 2020 purchased the remaining portion from GGC.

In May 2024, Red Lobster closed at least 99 of its restaurants and then filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after securing over $100 million in financing commitments from its lenders. The company has also entered a stalking horse agreement to sell itself and have its lenders manage it.

==History==
===Formation and growth===
The first Red Lobster restaurant was opened on January 18, 1968, in Lakeland, Florida, by entrepreneurs Bill Darden and Charley Woodsby. The oft-quoted date of March 27, 1968, is based on the incorporation date of Red Lobster Inns of America, Inc. (now GMRI, Inc.) in the Florida Secretary of State&#x27;s Office.

Originally billed as the &quot;Harbor for Seafood Lovers&quot;, the first restaurant was followed by four others throughout the American South. In 1970, General Mills acquired Red Lobster as a five-unit company and with new backing, the chain expanded rapidly in the 1980s.
Red Lobster entered Canada in the 1980s, in many cases by buying Ponderosa Steakhouse locations. Currently, Red Lobster generally maintains between 25 and 30 locations in Canada, the bulk in larger urban centres in Ontario (across Southern Ontario (from Southwestern Ontario through Golden Horseshoe and southern to Eastern Ontario) plus one in Sudbury, in northern Ontario and Barrie, Ontario in Central Ontario) with a smaller number in larger urban centres in all three Prairie provinces (Calgary, Edmonton, Regina, Saskatoon and Winnipeg). It exited the Quebec market (14 locations including Vanier and Montreal) in September 1997, due to financial losses, and was entirely absent from the Maritime provinces, British Columbia and the Arctic territories.

In 1991, Red Lobster introduced its now famous garlic cheese biscuits (given the name Cheddar Bay Biscuits in 1996) developed by culinary leader Kurt Hankins.

On March 29, 1994, Bill Darden died, after an extended illness, at the age of 75.

In 1995, Red Lobster (along with Olive Garden and other sister chains), became part of Darden Restaurants, Inc. During that time, General Mills decided to release Darden into an independent, publicly traded corporation.

===2009 prototype and sale===
In 2009, Red Lobster debuted its new Bar Harbor restaurant prototype modeled after coastal New England architecture. The new exterior features include shingle and stone towers, signal flags, and Adirondack-style benches. The interior updates include dark wood paneling, warm-toned fabrics, soft lighting, and nautical decor and artwork.

On December 19, 2013, Darden Restaurants announced plans to sell or spin off the Red Lobster brand, citing pressure from stock investors. This was in direct response to Darden&#x27;s going over budget on a new digital platform.

On May 12, 2014, Darden announced that as part of its spinoff of Red Lobster, it was converting the co-located Red Lobster and Olive Garden locations into standalone Olive Garden locations. On May 16, 2014, Darden announced it would be selling the Red Lobster seafood restaurant chain to Golden Gate Capital for US$2.1 billion. Darden announced the completion of the sale of Red Lobster on July 28, 2014. As part of the sale, a sale/leaseback of the real estate for 500 restaurants was completed to American Realty Capital Partners for $1.5 billion to finance the purchase. By 2023, rents totaled $200 million per year and was a factor in the 2024 bankruptcy filing.

On August 6, 2014, Red Lobster announced its new headquarters location in CNL Center City Commons in Orlando. On March 6, 2015, Red Lobster officially opened the Restaurant Support Center. Seafood supplier Thai Union acquired a 25 percent stake in the company in 2016 for a reported $575 million, and in 2020 purchased the remaining portion from GGC.

===Restructuring and bankruptcy===
In March 2024, Jonathan Tibus was hired as the company&#x27;s new CEO. Tibus previously was CEO during the bankruptcy of Kona Grill and the chief restructuring officer of Krystal. Officials deemed Red Lobster as a &quot;zombie brand&quot; and said that they were exploring options to save the company, including a restructuring turnaround, fire sale, or a possible bankruptcy filing. Red Lobster also announced that it was searching for a new buyer, and if one could not be found, the company may file for bankruptcy within the coming months.

On April 16, 2024, Bloomberg reported that Red Lobster was preparing to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, highlighting leases and labor costs among the issues. The company plans to exit some underperforming leases as well as address other long-term contracts and rising labor costs. The company expected to continue operating normally during the bankruptcy procedure while discussing a possible bankruptcy debt reduction plan with its creditors.

On May 13, 2024, Red Lobster abruptly closed some restaurants in 28 states. This included all of its Buffalo-area locations and most of its Orlando-area locations. TAGeX Brands conducted liquidation auctions for restaurant fixtures and supplies at the closed locations and concluded them by May 16.

On May 14, 2024, Red Lobster announced that it was preparing to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection before Memorial Day weekend, planning to restructure agreements with its landlords and creditors in efforts to shed some of its debt. On May 20, 2024, Red Lobster filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after securing over $100 million in financing commitments from its lenders. The company has also entered a stalking horse agreement to sell itself and have its lenders manage it, which will allow for the company to receive financing and shed some of its $1 billion debt. On May 23, 2024, Red Lobster announced that their Canadian operations would also be declaring bankruptcy by no later than May 28. The company will close some underperforming Canadian locations during the proceedings.

On June 6, 2024, Red Lobster announced that if their bankruptcy plan ends up getting approved, up to 129 additional locations would be permanently shut down. One of these locations included their restaurant at Times Square in Manhattan. On June 12, hip hop rapper Flavor Flav was hired by the company to be the spokesperson of Red Lobster commercials, after he previously ordered the entire Red Lobster menu in order to save the company. In his first commercial, he would announce that CrabFest would be returning to restaurants nationwide.

On June 14, it was reported that Fortress Investment Group, a Wall Street investment firm co-founded by the Milwaukee Bucks co-owner Wesley Edens, was interested in saving Red Lobster out of bankruptcy. The company evaluated which regions would fit Red Lobster&#x27;s attempted comeback and revival. That same day, Red Lobster Canada announced that it would ask the Ontario court to recognize its stalking horse bid and approve a sales process as soon as next week. This procedure would allow the company to preserve their operations in Canada, as the bid would allow for lenders avoid the risk of assets being sold for a lower price. On June 18, an Ontario court approved the sale procedure for Red Lobster Canada.

On August 25, 2024, Red Lobster announced the closure of 23 additional restaurants, all of which were set to be shuttered by August 31. On August 26, Damola Adamolekun was appointed CEO of Red Lobster, replacing Tibus.

On September 5, 2024, a court approved Red Lobster&#x27;s bankruptcy plan. RL Investor Holdings, a private group of investors consisted of TCW Private Credit, Blue Torch and funds managed by Fortress Investment Group, acquired the company after court approval on September 16. Red Lobster officially exited Chapter 11 bankruptcy that day.

==Promotions==

In 2003, Red Lobster offered an endless snow crab leg promotion, the second in its history. The promotion resulted in its parent company, Darden Restaurants, taking a $3 million charge to third-quarter earnings, resulting in president Edna Morris&#x27;s departure from the company.

The ill-timed promotion was launched amid high wholesale crab leg prices. The chain also underestimated how many times a customer would order more. Further complicating matters at the restaurant level was the time customers spent table-side in the restaurant cracking crab legs. This resulted in increased waiting times in the lobby and overall diminished customer capacity per hour.

Red Lobster introduced a new Daily Deals menu in 2020, featuring Endless Shrimp Mondays and more deals.

In June 2023, Red Lobster reintroduced Ultimate Endless Shrimp, normally run as a limited-time promotion during autumn, as a permanent addition to their menu. For $20, guests could order two shrimp dishes to start, and keep ordering until they were full. This resulted in a $11 million loss for Red Lobster in its third quarter earnings for that year, as the company underestimated the amount of customers taking advantage of a deal that had low profit margins. In response, Red Lobster raised the prices on the deal twice, from $20 to $22, and then to $25.

==Menu==
The brand specializes in seafood, including crab, fish, lobster, mollusks, and shrimp. It also serves chicken, desserts, pasta, and steak. 

=== Lobster bisque controversy ===
In February 2016, &quot;Inside Edition&quot; reported that Red Lobster used a mix of less expensive langostino along with Maine lobster in its lobster bisque recipe.

==Locations==
As of February 13, 2025, the company had 514 locations worldwide. These locations span 44 US states, Canada, Ecuador, Japan, Mexico, and Thailand. 

==In popular culture==
In 2007, writer Stewart O&#x27;Nan published the novella &quot;Last Night at the Lobster&quot; about the closing of a Red Lobster restaurant in Connecticut.

In February 2016, singer Beyoncé referenced Red Lobster in her single &quot;Formation&quot;. After unexpectedly releasing the single and performing it during the Super Bowl 50 halftime show, Red Lobster reported a 33% sales increase.

<doc id="1162230" wikidata="Q569815" url="?curid=1162230" title="Technologic">
<text>&quot;Technologic&quot; is a song by French duo Daft Punk from their third studio album, &quot;Human After All&quot; (2005). It was released as the second single on 14 June 2005. The music video for &quot;Technologic&quot; was directed by Daft Punk.

==Composition==

In the song, an electronically transposed voice chants technological commands. For example, &quot;Touch it, bring it, pay it, watch it, turn it, leave it, start, format it&quot; are spoken in rhythm to a beat.

A portion of the vocals were altered and sampled in the Busta Rhymes single &quot;Touch It&quot;, produced by Swizz Beatz. Subsequently, elements of both &quot;Technologic&quot; and &quot;Touch It&quot; were featured in Daft Punk&#x27;s live album &quot;Alive 2007&quot;.

A portion of the vocals were also altered for the Hannah Wants single &quot;Rhymes&quot;, which reached number 13 on the UK Singles Chart in 2015.

A portion of the vocals were sampled in Dua Lipa&#x27;s performance of her song, &quot;Hallucinate&quot;, during her Studio 2054 livestream concert on 27 November 2020. and later on her Future Nostalgia Tour performance of the same song.

==Music video==

The music video for &quot;Technologic&quot; is the third directed by Daft Punk, following &quot;Fresh&quot; and &quot;Robot Rock&quot;. The video features Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter on a pyramid-themed stage playing the bass guitars shown in the single cover. The lyrics flash as individual words of text on a television monitor set on the stage. The video features a robot character that appears to chant the lyrics of the song. The character is situated in front of the flashing screen between the duo and later appears in a darkened room watching itself on television. The robot was created by Tony Gardner and his team at Alterian, Inc. The music video is included in the CD and DVD edition of the album &quot;Musique Vol. 1 1993–2005&quot;.
The pyramid design used in the video is similar to the scheme used in Daft Punk&#x27;s live performances during the Alive 2006/2007 tour. The flashing lyrical text is integrated with the live version of &quot;Technologic&quot; on a large light-emitting diode display used for their shows. Homem-Christo stated, &quot;In the &#x27;Technologic&#x27; video, this little robot [is] in the pyramid and we thought it would be funny to have the two of us in the bigger pyramid.&quot;

==Other media==
The song was featured in an iPod advertisement shown in the summer of 2005. It was also featured in an ad for the Motorola E398 mobile-phone, aired in early 2005 in Brazil. Additionally, the song was featured in an episode of &quot;The O.C.&quot;. In 2009, it was used in a Lincoln MKS commercial, and in a series of TV advertisements for the Alfa Romeo MiTo. It is a playable track on the iOS games &quot;Tap Tap Revenge&quot; and &quot;Tap Tap Dance&quot;, and was sampled for the video game DJ Hero. In an episode of the TV show &quot;America&#x27;s Best Dance Crew&quot;, crew Kaba Modern performed to a master mix of this song on 7 February 2008. &quot;Technologic&quot; was also featured in the game &quot;Dance Central 2&quot;. 

The song is interpolated in the 2024 single &quot;Guess&quot; by Charli XCX.

<text>Okill Massey Learmonth, VC, MC (20 February 1894 – 19 August 1917), was a Canadian soldier. Learmonth was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to Commonwealth forces. Learmonth served in the Canadian Expeditionary Force during World War I, and was awarded his medal posthumously for actions at the Battle of Hill 70.

==Details==

Learmonth was 23 years old, and an acting Major in the 2nd (Eastern Ontario) Battalion, Canadian Expeditionary Force, during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 18 August 1917 east of Loos, France, during a determined counter-attack on our new positions, Major Learmonth, when his company was momentarily surprised, instantly charged and personally disposed of the attackers. Later, although under intense barrage fire and mortally wounded, he stood on the parapet of the trench, bombing the enemy and on several occasions he actually caught bombs thrown at him and threw them back. When unable to carry on the fight, he still refused to be evacuated and continued giving instructions and invaluable advice, finally handing over all his duties before he was moved to hospital where he died.

==Further information==
Born in Quebec City, Canada, he was elected a member of the Literary and Historical Society of Quebec in March 1914. He is buried at Noeux-les-Mines Communal Cemetery, France, 2 miles northwest of Lens (plot 11, row K, grave 9). Learmonth Street in Quebec City, Canada is named after him. Major Learmonth&#x27;s VC is held by the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa, on loan from the Governor General&#x27;s Foot Guards who perpetuate the 2nd Battalion, CEF.

<doc id="1162243" wikidata="Q7640993" url="?curid=1162243" title="Sunraysia">
<text>Sunraysia is a region located in northwestern Victoria and southwestern New South Wales in Australia. The region is renowned for its sunshine, intensive horticulture including grapes and oranges. Its main centre is Mildura, Victoria.

The area of Victoria to the west of Sunraysia is known as the Millewa, the main distinction being that Sunraysia is the irrigated area and the Millewa is the dryland cropping area.

Sunraysia is mostly contained in the Murray Darling wine region.

Sunraysia is sometimes incorrectly referred to as an economic region. 

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Sunraysia&quot; derives from a contest that entrepreneur Jack De Garis held in 1919, as part of a promotion on behalf of the Australian Dried Fruits Association. The public were invited to submit a name to describe the dried fruits grown in the Mildura area. The winning name was &quot;Sun-Raysed&quot;, which was modified as &quot;Sunraysia&quot; to describe the district as a whole. In 1920, De Garis started a newspaper in Mildura called the &quot;Sunraysia Daily&quot;, helping to establish the name.

==Pest Free Area==
The Greater Sunraysia district forms part of the Fruit Fly Free Exclusion Zone, a Pest Free Area (PFA) that was created in 2007 located between north-west Victoria and south-west New South Wales. It is renowned for the production of high value horticultural crops including citrus, table grapes and stone fruit. The PFA is aligned to this production area to provide greater fruit fly control measures. The Victorian Department of Environment and Primary Industries (DEPI) and New South Wales Department of Primary Industries (DPI) have implemented stringent legislative controls on the movement of host fruit and vegetables into the PFA to keep it free from the Queensland fruit fly (QFF) and maintain high value markets, which are worth millions of dollars to local industries. The PFA enables commercial horticultural products to be marketed without postharvest chemical treatments for QFF. The PFA follows the course of the Murray River from Kerang to and the Darling River from Wentworth to Pooncarie.

==Major settlements==
In addition to Mildura, the other major settlements in the district are Robinvale, Irymple, Red Cliffs, Merbein, Wentworth, Dareton and Buronga-Gol Gol.

==Education facilities==

The Mildura campuses of Sunraysia Institute of TAFE (SuniTAFE) and La Trobe University are located on Benetook Ave between 11th and 14th Streets. SuniTAFE has an additional site in Cardross. The Coomealla Campus of TAFE NSW is in Dareton.

==Media==
The main newspaper that services the region is the &quot;Sunraysia Daily&quot;, and is published on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday. Sunraysia was also serviced by two free papers; the &quot;Sunraysia Life&quot; and the &quot;Mildura Weekly&quot; were published on Fridays. The &quot;Mildura Independent&quot; was another free weekly, published on Sundays from 1982 to 2007. &quot;My Mildura&quot; was a free monthly magazine. There are also a number of paid weeklies covering smaller areas within Sunraysia.

Local radio stations include ABC Mildura Swan Hill, RIVER1467 (1467AM 3ML), Triple M 97.9, Hit 99.5, and Hot FM.

Television stations in Sunraysia include ABC Victoria, Channel Nine Mildura (part of the WIN Television network), and 7 Mildura.

<doc id="1162252" wikidata="Q5349166" url="?curid=1162252" title="Eighty Four, Pennsylvania">
<text>Eighty Four is a census-designated place in Somerset, Nottingham, North Strabane, and South Strabane townships in Washington County, Pennsylvania. It lies approximately 25 miles (40 km) southwest of Pittsburgh and is in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. The population was 645 at the 2020 census.

Eighty Four contains the 84 Lumber company&#x27;s headquarters. Eighty Four is a part of the Canon-McMillan, Trinity, Ringgold, and Bentworth school districts.

Eighty Four is accessible via PA Route 519 and PA Route 136 and interstates 79 and 70. The closest international airport is the Pittsburgh International Airport approximately northwest of Eighty Four in Findlay Township, Pennsylvania.

== Origin of name ==

Eighty Four was originally named Smithville. Due to postal confusion with another town of the same name, its name was changed to &quot;Eighty Four&quot; on July 28, 1884. The origin of the name is uncertain. It has been suggested that the town was named in honor of Grover Cleveland&#x27;s 1884 election as President of the United States, but that occurred after the town was named. Another possibility is the town&#x27;s mile marker on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. Another is that the town was named after the year the town&#x27;s post office was built, by a postmaster who &quot;didn&#x27;t have a whole lot of imagination.&quot;

==Education==
The census-designated place is divided between the following school districts, based on the townships: Trinity Area School District (South Strabane Township), Canon-McMillan School District (North Strabane Township), and Bentworth School District (Somerset Township).

<text>Narendra Krishna Karmarkar (born circa 1956) is an Indian mathematician. Karmarkar developed Karmarkar&#x27;s algorithm. He is listed as an ISI highly cited researcher.

He invented one of the first provably polynomial time algorithms for linear programming, which is generally referred to as an interior point method. The algorithm is a cornerstone in the field of linear programming. He published his famous result in 1984 while he was working for Bell Laboratories in New Jersey.

==Biography==
Karmarkar received his B.Tech in Electrical Engineering from IIT Bombay in 1978, M.S. from the California Institute of Technology in 1979, and Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of California, Berkeley in 1983 under the supervision of Richard M. Karp.
Karmarkar was a post-doctoral research fellow at IBM research (1983), Member of Technical Staff and fellow at Mathematical Sciences Research Center, AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories (1983–1998), professor of mathematics at M.I.T. (1991), at Institute for Advanced study, Princeton (1996), and Homi Bhabha Chair Professor at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Mumbai from 1998 to 2005. He was the scientific advisor to the chairman of the TATA group (2006–2007). During this time, he was funded by Ratan Tata to scale-up the supercomputer he had designed and prototyped at TIFR. The scaled-up model ranked ahead of supercomputer in Japan at that time and achieved the best ranking India ever achieved in supercomputing. He was the founding director of Computational Research labs in Pune, where the scaling-up work was performed. He continues to work on his new architecture for supercomputing.

== Work ==

===Karmarkar&#x27;s algorithm===
Karmarkar&#x27;s algorithm solves linear programming problems in polynomial time. These problems are represented by a number of linear constraints involving a number of variables. The previous method of solving these problems consisted of considering the problem as a high-dimensional solid with vertices, where the solution was approached by traversing from vertex to vertex. Karmarkar&#x27;s novel method approaches the solution by cutting through the above solid in its traversal. Consequently, complex optimization problems are solved much faster using the Karmarkar&#x27;s algorithm. A practical example of this efficiency is the solution to a complex problem in communications network optimization, where the solution time was reduced from weeks to days. His algorithm thus enables faster business and policy decisions. Karmarkar&#x27;s algorithm has stimulated the development of several interior-point methods, some of which are used in current implementations of linear-program solvers.

====Galois geometry====
After working on the interior-point method, Karmarkar worked on a new architecture for supercomputing, based on concepts from finite geometry, especially projective geometry over finite fields.

<doc id="1162264" wikidata="Q7755959" url="?curid=1162264" title="The Palm (restaurant)">
<text>The Palm is an international chain of American fine-dining steakhouses that began in 1926. The original location was in New York City at 837 Second Avenue (between East 44th Street and East 45th Street) in Manhattan.

Since its beginnings, management has opened additional restaurants throughout the United States, Puerto Rico, and Mexico. The Palm is notable for steak, lobster, traditional Italian dishes, and the caricatures of celebrities on its walls.

== History ==
Italian immigrants Pio Bozzi and John Ganzi opened the first Palm restaurant in 1926. It was originally intended to be named La Parma, but a city licensing clerk misunderstood the thick Italian accent of the founders. The owners found it was easier to change the name than to get the license reissued.
The Palm served as a luncheon and dinner club for members of the city&#x27;s newspapers for many years. The &quot;New York Daily Mirror&quot; and King Features (cartoon syndicated) were located on 45th Street between Second and Third Avenues; the &quot;Daily News&quot;, United Press (later United Press International) and United Features (cartoon syndicate) were located in the Daily News Building on 42nd Street and Second Avenue. The Herald Tribune was on 41st Street and Third Avenue and the World Telegram was on 49th Street and Third Avenue. The proximity of the cartoon syndicates led to the colorful caricatures on the walls. The original Palm consisted of one room at 837 Second Avenue, then it expanded to the second room and eventually to the second floor before opening across the street.

=== Cuisine ===
When the Palm opened, it operated as a conventional Italian restaurant offering fare similar to that found in New York&#x27;s Little Italy neighborhood. Early in its history, however, Bozzi and Ganzi fielded a request for steak and the owners broiled it after retrieving meat from a Second Avenue butcher. As related in the Palm cook book, the first request led to others and the items were put on the menu.

Later, the Palm added Nova Scotia lobsters and aged USDA Prime beef, often served bone-in, as well as a selection of salads.

It opened a restaurant in London employing Jason Wallis as executive head chef in 2009. It has since closed. It was opened on the site of Drones, a former Marco Pierre White restaurant.

=== Caricatures ===

A defining feature of the restaurant&#x27;s brand has been the celebrity walls of caricatures drawn directly on the walls. Those depicted include celebrities, politicians, and sports and media figures.

The Palm&#x27;s historical materials contend that the caricature tradition began as a twist on the phrase &quot;sing for your meal&quot; where an artist who enjoyed the fare would pay for his meal by drawing a portrait on the wall. Featured celebrities have often provided an autograph next to their portrait.

Later, as the brand expanded, this tradition continued at other locations.

=== Expansion ===

The Palm opened its second location in Washington, D.C. in December 1972. According to the company&#x27;s web site, the prodding of former U.S. President George H. W. Bush, then U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, encouraged the families to open the second location. Bush often quipped that there was a &quot;lack of good American fare&quot; in the capital city.

In 1973, the restaurant&#x27;s third location, the &quot;Palm Too,&quot; opened across the street from the original New York location. During the 1970s the restaurants also expanded to three other cities, Los Angeles, Houston and East Hampton, NY.
In 2000, The Palm opened a location in downtown Nashville, TN, situated across from the Nashville Predators Bridgestone Arena.

During the summer of 2011, the Palm underwent a brand refresh, which included new tableware, uniforms, signage, and an updated visual identity manifested in a new website and a new ad campaign. The chain incorporated a number of new dishes into its menu to coincide with the brand refresh. The restaurant&#x27;s motto is &quot;the place to see and to be seen.&quot;

=== Diversification ===
In 1980, the company took over the management of two historic hotels, the Huntting Inn and the Hedges Inn, both located in East Hampton, New York. The company also operated its own wholesale meat company, JORM, though now the Company purchases meat from a third party.

== The Palm today ==
In February 2020, Houston-based restaurant operator Landry&#x27;s acquired The Palm steakhouse chain out of bankruptcy for $50 million.

Today The Palm has approximately 30 locations in cities throughout the United States as well as locations in Puerto Rico and Mexico.

In 2020, Landry&#x27;s began the process of terminating The Palm&#x27;s previous loyalty program, the 837 Club, and replacing it with Landry&#x27;s own program which is in place at all of their restaurants. Landry&#x27;s program only provides a cash reward program, which essentially awards 10% of a guest check toward future meals (redeemable in $25 increments). The 837 Club generally provided 7.5% of a guest check toward future meals, but also included more valuable awards at higher redemption levels, including a caricature and party at the Palm to unveil it, and vacation escapes. In addition, guests who spent at least $1,000 at the Palm annually received a free 3lb lobster for their birthday. Landry&#x27;s is eliminating these longstanding traditions—their own birthday award is simply a $25 credit—which has upset many 837 Club members (many of whom have been members and customers for decades).

Tony Kornheiser, co-anchor of ESPN&#x27;s Emmy-winning sports television show &quot;Pardon the Interruption&quot; and former journalist for &quot;Newsday&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, visits the Washington location frequently. In recent years, fans of his eponymous D.C. radio show—who refer to themselves as &quot;Littles&quot;—have been known to send or leave notes for Kornheiser at the restaurant, many of which he reads on the air. Additionally, several of the fan-written parody songs that Kornheiser has featured as part of the show&#x27;s mailbag segment have centered around the Palm and its prominent role in the host&#x27;s life.

<text>Raj Chandra Bose (or Basu) (19 June 1901 – 31 October 1987) was an Indian American mathematician and statistician best known for his work in design theory, finite geometry and the theory of error-correcting codes in which the class of BCH codes is partly named after him. He also invented the notions of partial geometry, association scheme, and strongly regular graph and started a systematic study of difference sets to construct symmetric block designs. 
He was notable for his work along with S. S. Shrikhande and E. T. Parker in their disproof of the famous conjecture made by Leonhard Euler dated 1782 that for no &quot;n&quot; do there exist two mutually orthogonal Latin squares of order 4&quot;n&quot; + 2.

==Early life==
Bose was born in Hoshangabad, India; he was the first of five children. His father was a physician and life was good until 1918 when his mother died in the influenza pandemic. His father died of a stroke the following year. Despite difficult circumstances, Bose continued to study securing first class in both the Masters examinations in Pure and Applied mathematics in 1925 and 1927 respectively at the Rajabazar Science College campus of University of Calcutta. His research was performed under the supervision of the geometry Professor Syamadas Mukhopadhyaya from Calcutta. Bose worked as a lecturer at Asutosh College, Calcutta. He published his work on the differential geometry of convex curves.

==Academic life==
Bose&#x27;s course changed in December 1932 when P. C. Mahalanobis, director of the new (1931) Indian Statistical Institute, offered Bose a part-time job. Mahalanobis had seen Bose&#x27;s geometrical work and wanted him to work on statistics. The day after Bose moved in, the secretary brought him all the volumes of &quot;Biometrika&quot; with a list of 50 papers to read and also Ronald Fisher&#x27;s &quot;Statistical Methods for Research Workers&quot;. Mahalanobis told him, &quot;You were saying that you do not know much statistics. You master the 50 papers ... and Fisher&#x27;s book. This will suffice for your statistical education for the present.&quot; With Samarendra Nath Roy, who joined the ISI a little later, Bose was the chief mathematician at the Institute.

He first worked with multivariate analysis where he collaborated with Mahalanobis and Roy. In 1938–39 Fisher visited India and talked about the design of experiments. Roy had the idea of using the theory of finite fields and finite geometry to solve problems in design. The development of a mathematical theory of design would be Bose&#x27;s main preoccupation until the mid-1950s.

In 1935 Bose had become full-time at the Institute. In 1940 joined the University of Calcutta where C. R. Rao and H. K. Nandi were in the first group of students he taught. In 1945 Bose became Head of the Department of Statistics.
University authorities in the United States told him he needed to have a doctorate. So he submitted his published papers on multivariate analysis and the design of experiments and was awarded a D. Litt. in 1947.

In 1947 Bose went to the United States as a visiting professor at Columbia University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He received offers from American universities and he was also offered positions in India. The Indian jobs involved very heavy administration, which he saw as the end of his research work and in March 1949 he joined the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill as Professor of Statistics.

In the years at Chapel Hill Bose made important discoveries on coding theory (with D.K. Ray-Chaudhuri) and constructed (with S. S. Shrikhande and E. T. Parker) a Graeco-Latin square of size 10, a counterexample to Euler&#x27;s conjecture that no Graeco-Latin square of size 4&quot;k&quot; + 2 exists. In 1971, he retired at the age of 70. He then accepted a chair at Colorado State University of Fort Collins from which he retired in 1980. His final doctoral student finished after this second retirement.

Bose died in Colorado, aged 86, in 1987. He is survived by two daughters. The elder, Purabi Schur, is retired from the Library of Congress and the younger, Sipra Bose Johnson, is retired as a professor of anthropology from the State University of New York at New Paltz.

<doc id="1162268" wikidata="Q1773384" url="?curid=1162268" title="Pennyroyal Tea">
<text>&quot;Pennyroyal Tea&quot; is a song by the American rock band Nirvana, written by vocalist and guitarist Kurt Cobain. It is the ninth track on the band&#x27;s third and final studio album, &quot;In Utero&quot;, released in September 1993.

In November 1993, the song was remixed by Scott Litt, who had earlier remixed the songs &quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot; and &quot;All Apologies&quot; for the album, in preparation for its release as a single. The Litt remix was included on the censored version of &quot;In Utero&quot;, released in March 1994.

The &quot;Pennyroyal Tea&quot; single, which would have been the third commercial single from the album, was set for release in April 1994, but cancelled following Cobain&#x27;s death the same month. A few copies survived the recall, and have become among the most sought-after and expensive collectables in Nirvana&#x27;s catalogue. A planned music video for the song was also cancelled following Cobain&#x27;s death.

The &quot;Pennyroyal Tea&quot; single was re-released, on limited edition 7 inch vinyl, for Record Store Day in April 2014, and reached number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Singles Sales chart.

==Early history==
According to Michael Azerrad&#x27;s 1993 Nirvana biography, &quot;Come as You Are: The Story of Nirvana&quot;, &quot;Pennyroyal Tea&quot; was written by Cobain in 1990 in an Olympia, Washington apartment he shared with Nirvana drummer, Dave Grohl. &quot;Dave and I were screwing around on a 4-track,&quot; Cobain explained, &quot;and I wrote that song in about thirty seconds. And I sat down for like half-an-hour and wrote the lyrics and then we recorded it.&quot; 

&quot;Pennyroyal Tea&quot; was first performed live on April 17, 1991 at the OK Hotel in Seattle, Washington, the show at which Nirvana also debuted their breakthrough single, &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;. Footage of both songs from this performance was released on the DVD of the Nirvana rarities box set, &quot;With the Lights Out&quot;, in November 2004.

Two unfinished takes of the song, both lacking vocals, were recorded by Jack Endino on October 26, 1992, at Word of Mouth in Seattle, Washington.

==&quot;In Utero&quot;==

The final studio version of &quot;Pennyroyal Tea&quot; was recorded by Steve Albini at Pachyderm Studios in Cannon Falls, Minnesota, in February, 1993, and officially released on &quot;In Utero&quot; in September 1993. 

The song was first attempted on February 14, with the first take being an instrumental. In a 2013 interview for the audio series &quot;Spotify Landmark&quot;, Albini revealed that &quot;Pennyroyal Tea&quot; and the album&#x27;s eventual first single, &quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot;, were the only two songs recorded during the sessions that required &quot;more than a couple of takes&quot;, saying that both were &quot;recorded several times in several aerations.&quot; Albini also explained that Grohl&#x27;s bass drum was replaced on &quot;Pennyroyal Tea&quot;, as well as &quot;Dumb&quot;, with a small one &quot;with a full-front head on it, so that it had a very sort of bouncy, jazzy sound, as opposed to the sort of more percussive, more hard rock sound on the rest of the record.&quot;

===Remix===

Cobain was ultimately dissatisfied with the recording, telling David Fricke in a 1993 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview that the song &quot;was not recorded right. There is something wrong with that. That should have been recorded like &quot;Nevermind&quot;, because I know that&#x27;s a strong song, a hit single. We&#x27;re toying with the idea of re-recording it or remixing it.&quot; 

The song was remixed by Scott Litt, who had remixed the singles &quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot; and &quot;All Apologies&quot; prior to the album&#x27;s release, on November 23, 1993 at Bad Animals in Seattle, Washington. This version appeared on the censored Wal-Mart and Kmart versions of &quot;In Utero&quot;, released in March 1994. It was also the mix used on the recalled &quot;Pennyroyal Tea&quot; single, and became widely available when it appeared on the band&#x27;s first greatest hits compilation, &quot;Nirvana&quot;, in November 2002.

==Post-&quot;In Utero&quot;==

On November 18, 1993, Cobain performed a solo, acoustic version of the song during Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; appearance at Sony Music Studios in New York City. 

A full band version, featuring second guitarist Pat Smear, was recorded in Paris, France on February 4, 1994, during Nirvana&#x27;s appearance on the French television show, &quot;Nulle Part Ailleurs&quot;.

The band had planned to perform the song on the UK TV show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; later in 1994, as revealed by the discovery of a Digital Audio Tape containing three instrumental mixes of the song. The show allowed musicians to mime live vocals over pre-recorded instruments, and first featured Nirvana in November 1991, when Cobain mocked the show&#x27;s format by singing &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; in a lower key.

&quot;Pennyroyal Tea&quot; was performed for the last time live at Nirvana&#x27;s final concert, on March 1, 1994, at Terminal Eins in Munich, Germany.

==Composition and lyrics==

The song&#x27;s title refers to the tea made from boiling the leaves of the plant &quot;Mentha pulegium&quot;, or pennyroyal, which is used as an abortifacient, among other things, in traditional medicine. In Cobain&#x27;s unused liner notes for &quot;In Utero&quot;, published posthumously in &quot;Journals&quot; in 2002, the entry for &quot;Pennyroyal Tea&quot; simply reads: &quot;herbal abortive... it doesn&#x27;t work, you hippie.&quot;

In an interview in the October 1993 issue of &quot;Impact&quot;, Cobain gave greater insight into the song, saying that it was about a person suffering from severe depression: 

In a 1995 interview, Cohen told &quot;Addicted to Noise&quot; correspondent Peter Howell, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry I couldn&#x27;t have spoken to the young man. I see a lot of people at the Zen Centre, who have gone through drugs and found a way out that is not just Sunday school. There are always alternatives, and I might have been able to lay something on him. Or maybe not.&quot;

==Release==

The &quot;Pennyroyal Tea&quot; single was recalled shortly after Cobain&#x27;s death in April 1994. The single&#x27;s cancellation may have been in part due to the title of one of the b-sides, &quot;I Hate Myself and Want to Die&quot;, although it may have been cancelled regardless of this, so as not to capitalize on Cobain&#x27;s death. In the United Kingdom, the single was scheduled to be released on May 3, 1994, but this was scrapped with &quot;Music Week&quot; reporting that sales of Nirvana releases had rocketed but that MCA did not want to cash-in on Cobain&#x27;s death.

At the time, only retail versions of the CD single made in Germany had been manufactured and distributed. The singles were recalled and destroyed by the record label or retailers, but some copies were put aside, which is apparently the source of surviving copies. Some copies may have been sold by retailers, despite the recall. 

Sleeves for the single&#x27;s United Kingdom release, on 7 inch vinyl and cassette, were manufactured, but the single itself was not pressed in the UK prior to the recall. As with all Nirvana artwork, it had been produced in the United States, although there were no plans to release the single in the US. However, the song did receive some airplay on US rock and alternative radio in 1994-95.

A promotional CD single for the song was manufactured in the UK and exists in even smaller numbers than the German retail CD. It features only the title track, misspelled as &quot;Penny Royal Tea&quot;. In 2019, it was reported that the promotional single had appeared twice on Discogs with prices of $1,120 and $1,199.

In a March 2020 &quot;Goldmine&quot; article, journalist and Nirvana expert Gillian G. Garr reported a range of $346 to $1,100 as recent prices of the single, and &quot;upwards of $1,000&quot; for the promotional single, with one recently on sale for $2,597.

===Single artwork===

Unlike the artwork for the previous &quot;In Utero&quot; singles, &quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot; and &quot;All Apologies&quot;/ &quot;Rape Me&quot;, the artwork for the &quot;Pennyroyal Tea&quot; single featured no input from Cobain. &quot;We got it done and I don&#x27;t know that Kurt was around to approve it or not,&quot; recalls designer Robert Fisher. &quot;I think it might just have been shot to management to approve or something.&quot; The single&#x27;s cover features a teacup on a table next to a used ashtray, a cream pitcher and animal crackers.

===2014 Record Store Day re-release===
On April 19, 2014, the &quot;Pennyroyal Tea&quot; single was re-released on 7-inch vinyl for Record Store Day 2014, limited to only 6000 copies. It was the top-selling vinyl single of Record Store Day in the US, reaching number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Singles Sales Chart.

===Critical reception===

Reviewing &quot;In Utero&quot; for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Fricke wrote, &quot;In the sepulchral folk intro of &#x27;Penny Royal Tea,&#x27; Cobain almost sounds like Michael Stipe at the beginning of R.E.M.&#x27;s Drive&#x27;—before the heaving, fuzz-burnt chorus comes lashing down with a vengeance.&quot; In his review of the album for the &quot;NME&quot;, John Mulvey wrote that &quot;Pennyroyal Tea&quot; was &quot;a terrific song – straightforward, insidious, oddly moving,&quot; but that &quot;the guitars don&#x27;t scream enough, the chorus doesn&#x27;t tower like it should, and overall it&#x27;s the one real &#x27;Call Butch Vig&#x27; moment.&quot;

===Legacy===

In 2004, the &quot;NME&quot; ranked &quot;Pennyroyal Tea&quot; at number six on their list of the &quot;20 Greatest Nirvana Songs Ever.&quot; The same year, &quot;Q&quot; erroneously included the song on their list of &quot;12 Album Tracks That Should Have Been Singles, But Weren&#x27;t,&quot; at number two. In 2015, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed it at number 11 on their ranking of 102 Nirvana songs. Stephen Thomas Erlewine ranked it at number 17 on his list of Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;30 greatest songs&quot; for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; in 2023.

==Live promotional versions==

A live version of &quot;Pennyroyal Tea,&quot; from the band&#x27;s show at the Great Western Forum in Inglewood, California, on December 30, 1993, was released as a streaming single in September 2023, to promote the 30th anniversary reissue of &quot;In Utero&quot;, set to be released in October 2023. The &quot;Super Deluxe&quot; version of the reissue will feature the complete concert. 

==Cancelled music video==
Dutch director Anton Corbijn was asked to direct a music video for &quot;Pennyroyal Tea&quot;, but he refused, saying he did not believe he could make a video better than the one he had made for &quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot;, the first single from &quot;In Utero&quot;. American director Jeffery Plansker was enlisted as the director instead, but the planned video was abandoned after Cobain&#x27;s death in April 1994.

==&quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; version==
Featuring only Cobain on vocals and guitar, the &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; version of &quot;Pennyroyal Tea&quot; was the only solo performance of the concert. The band had tried different approaches to the song during the rehearsal earlier that day, performing it in a different key and with Smear on backing vocals. However, during the show Cobain decided to attempt it on his own, asking, &quot;Am I going to do this by myself?&quot; to which Grohl replied, &quot;Do it by yourself&quot; Cobain joked that &quot;if it sounds bad, these people are just going to have to wait.&quot; The song was performed in the same arrangement as the &quot;In Utero&quot; version but without the guitar solo, and Cobain paused before the third verse, then completed the song. Cobain biographer Charles Cross called this version Cobain&#x27;s &quot;single greatest moment onstage&quot;, writing that &quot;like all the high-water marks of his career, it came at a time when he seemed destined to fail.&quot;

This version was officially released on the album &quot;MTV Unplugged in New York&quot; in November 1994. Footage of the performance, as well as from the rehearsals, were released on the &quot;MTV Unplugged in New York&quot; DVD in November, 2007.

*The second of the two instrumental takes recorded at Word of Mouth in Seattle, on October 26, 1992, was released on the 20th anniversary &quot;Deluxe&quot; and &quot;Super Deluxe&quot; versions of &quot;In Utero&quot; in September 2013.

*A third mix of the studio version, done by Albini in 2013, also appeared the 20th anniversary &quot;Deluxe&quot; and &quot;Super Deluxe&quot; versions of &quot;In Utero&quot;.

*A live version, recorded at Pier 48 in Seattle, on December 13, 1993 for MTV, was released on the live video, &quot;Live and Loud&quot;, in September 2013. An edited version of the concert, including &quot;Pennyroyal Tea&quot;, first aired on MTV on December 31, 1993. The &quot;Live and Loud&quot; DVD also featured rehearsal footage of the song for the show, recorded earlier that day at the same venue, as bonus material.

*The live version recorded during the band&#x27;s appearance on &quot;Nulle Part Ailleurs&quot; in Paris, on February 4, 1994, appeared as bonus material on the &quot;Live and Loud&quot; DVD.

*In addition to the Great Western Forum concert, the &quot;Super Deluxe&quot; reissue of &quot;In Utero&quot; will feature the band&#x27;s complete show at the Seattle Center Arena in Seattle on January 7, 1994, which also featured a version of &quot;Pennyroyal Tea.&quot;

===Unreleased versions===

*The 4-track version recorded by Cobain and Grohl in Olympia in 1990 was leaked on the internet in 2015, but has never appeared on an official release. Michelle Geslani of &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; described this recording as &quot;darker [and] more slow-burning&quot; than the final studio version, and wrote that it &quot;features Cobain adapting a guttural growl not unlike Leonard Cohen (interesting, given the lyrics).&quot;

<text>Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf () is a subsidized private, previously Jesuit French-language educational institution offering secondary school and college-level instruction in Quebec. It was originally a boys&#x27; school, became partially mixed in 1968 and, since 2014, opened its doors fully to girls.

The school is located at 3200 Côte-Sainte-Catherine Road in Montreal. Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf is also a boarding school for college students wishing to reside at the college from Monday to Friday, and also during weekends.

Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf is commonly seen as one of the foremost schools in Quebec, and it has the seventh place in the Fraser Institute School Ranking as of 2020. In addition to government subsidies of roughly $4,500 per student every year, the school is able to maintain low tuition due to large class sizes.

With alumni Pierre Trudeau and Justin Trudeau, Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf is the secondary education institution that has produced the most Canadian prime ministers in the country. It also was the alma mater of Quebec Premiers Robert Bourassa and Pierre-Marc Johnson, and of Leaders of the Official Opposition of Quebec such as, André Boisclair and Pierre-Karl Péladeau.

== History ==
Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf was founded by the Jesuits in 1928. The college was named after Catholic missionary and martyr Jean de Brébeuf.
The college traces its origins to the merger of several institutions which became public ones in 1967, when the Quebec system of public colleges was created. Built in 1928, the campus was designed by Dalbé Viau and Alphonse Venne.

It began accepting girls for secondary 1 to 5 starting from 2013 because of a need of funding. However, boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; classes take place in separate parts of the college before secondary 5. The school has been secular since 1986.

On May 4, 2016, a college student celebration on campus got overly rowdy: smoke bombs were thrown into hallways and some classroom windows were broken.

== Programs ==
Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf offers a number of two-year pre-university programs (unlike public colleges, it does not offer technical programs, which typically take around three years to complete and lead directly to certification for a specific trade or profession). Pre-university college degrees cover subject matter roughly equivalent to that of the additional year of high school given elsewhere in Canada in preparation for a chosen field of study in university.

Post-secondary students attending Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf can choose one of several programs of study, depending on the concentrations required for the university program in which they intend to pursue their studies. The college offers programs in Social Science, Literature &amp; Communications, Health Science, Pure and Applied Science and Arts &amp; Sciences.

In addition to the standard Diploma of College Studies, students in certain programs are also awarded a &quot;Sciences, Lettres et Arts (FR)&quot; diploma (all-rounded preparatory for all university majors except music and dance, known as &quot;Arts and Science&quot; in English-language colleges).

Subjects taught in the secondary part of the school include Mathematics, French, English, Ethics and religious culture, Gym, Art, Sciences, Geography and History. From secondary 1 to 4, three separate programs are offered to students: additional Sports, Latin, and Spanish. In secondary 5, in addition to the common core courses (i.e., the compulsory courses that all secondary 5 students must take), students choose from a combination of two optional courses: either physics and chemistry (the science combination) or modern European history and 20th century history (the history combination). Students must obtain a grade of 75% or above in science and mathematics in secondary 4 to be eligible for the science combination.

The secondary school curriculum has strong ties to the Cours classique (FR), the long-standing education system that was used in Quebec prior to the creation of the current system in the mid-1960s. Most notably, the study of Latin and the emphasis on logic and rhetoric still present in Brébeuf&#x27;s curriculum are evidence of these ties.
=== Reputation ===
Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf is widely regarded as one of the best and most prestigious secondary schools in Quebec. It has ranked number 1, tied with a few others, continuously for several years, and has consistently received high rankings (10/10) from the Fraser Institute for academic achievement. It is also placed as one of the best schools in the entire country.

=== Athletics ===
The school is known for being very competitive in basketball, [[lacrosse], Soccer and [[fencing]], having won provincial titles in basketball and Soccer several times and having many of its former students fence at international levels. The last successful Cup run for the Varsity Intercollegiate Soccer Team tracks back to 2023, with a dramatic win in a Penalty Shootout against historic rivals Collège André-Grasset. Headcoach René Sarr, assistant coach Luigi Michel Larose and 2023 MVP Tuan Quoc Tran who finished the season with over 20 goals can be proud of their feats. The school also competes at provincial and regional level [[ice hockey|hockey]], [[volleyball]], [[cheerleading]], [[broomball]], [[cross country running]], [[badminton]] and [[Rugby football|rugby]] competitions. The school&#x27;s lacrosse team has been in the finals for the four years it has played and has won the title three consecutive years.

<text>Lacroix is a crater that is located in the southwest part of the Moon, to the northwest of the large walled plain Schickard. The most notable feature of this crater is the smaller crater Lacroix J that overlies the southern rim. The surviving rim of Lacroix is nearly circular, with a slightly worn inner wall. The interior floor is relatively featureless.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Lacroix.

<text>Waterfall is an unincorporated community on the west coast of Prince of Wales Island in Prince of Wales-Hyder Census Area, Alaska, United States, approximately west of Ketchikan. The primary industry was Waterfall Cannery, built in 1912 as a salmon processing facility. The cannery closed in 1973 and was renovated into the Waterfall Resort, a sport fishing lodge.

Waterfall is not connected to the island&#x27;s road system; visitors to the resort arrive by floatplane from Ketchikan.

<text>The 1948 Saskatchewan general election, the eleventh in the history of the province, was held on June 24, 1948, to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan. The Co-operative Commonwealth Federation government of Premier Tommy Douglas, first elected in 1944, was re-elected with a majority in the legislature.

== Summary ==
Tommy Douglas&#x27; Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) was re-elected with a reduced majority. While the CCF had won an outright majority of the popular vote in the 1944 election, the party won a large plurality in 1948, while seeing their seat share fall to 31 out of 51 in the Assembly.

Although the share of the popular vote won by Walter Tucker&#x27;s Liberal Party fell by almost five percentage points, the party increased its representation in the legislature from 5 seats to 19.

The Social Credit Party, which had won 2 seats and 16% of the popular vote in the 1938 election—only to disappear in the 1944 election—returned to win over 8% of the vote, but no seats.

The Progressive Conservative Party, led by Rupert Ramsay, continued to decline, and was also shut out of the legislature.

In some ridings, the Progressive Conservatives and Liberals ran joint candidates in failed attempts to defeat the CCF. These candidates ran as Liberal-PC or Conservative Liberal candidates. The lone successful such candidate—Alex &quot;Hammy&quot; McDonald—immediately joined the Liberal caucus upon being sworn in as an MLA.

==Results==

<text>The 1952 Saskatchewan general election, the twelfth in the history of the province, was held on June 11, 1952, to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan. The Co-operative Commonwealth Federation government of Premier Tommy Douglas was re-elected for a third term with a majority government.

== Summary ==
Tommy Douglas&#x27; Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) was re-elected with an increased majority and their highest share of the popular vote, an outright majority of 54.1%. This was the highest share of the vote won by any government since Thomas Walter Scott&#x27;s Liberals took 57% of the vote in the 1912 election. After the 1952 election, the CCF held 42 of 53 seats in the Assembly.

The Liberal Party of Walter Tucker increased its share of the popular vote to almost 40%, but lost 9 of the seats it had held in the previous legislature.

The Social Credit and Progressive Conservative parties continued to lose support, securing less than 6% of the vote between them.

This election was held using a mixture of single-member districts and multi-member districts. Regina elected three members, while Saskatoon and Moose Jaw City elected two each. Every voter in those districts could cast as many votes as there were seats to fill in the district (Block Voting). Each multi-member district elected a one-party sweep of the district&#x27;s seats. There was no proportionality.

<text>Planet Stories was an American pulp science fiction magazine, published by Fiction House between 1939 and 1955. It featured interplanetary adventures, both in space and on some other planets, and was initially focused on a young readership. Malcolm Reiss was editor or editor-in-chief for all of its 71 issues. &quot;Planet Stories&quot; was launched at the same time as &quot;Planet Comics&quot;, the success of which probably helped to fund the early issues of &quot;Planet Stories&quot;. &quot;Planet Stories&quot; did not pay well enough to regularly attract the leading science fiction writers of the day, but occasionally obtained work from well-known authors, including Isaac Asimov and Clifford D. Simak. In 1952 &quot;Planet Stories&quot; published Philip K. Dick&#x27;s first sale, and printed four more of his stories over the next three years.

The two writers most identified with &quot;Planet Stories&quot; are Leigh Brackett and Ray Bradbury, both of whom set many of their stories on a romanticized version of Mars that owed much to the depiction of Barsoom in the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs. Bradbury&#x27;s work for &quot;Planet&quot; included an early story in his &quot;Martian Chronicles&quot; sequence. Brackett&#x27;s best-known work for the magazine was a series of adventures featuring Eric John Stark, which began in the summer of 1949. Brackett and Bradbury collaborated on one story, &quot;Lorelei of the Red Mist&quot;, which appeared in 1946; it was generally well-received, although one letter to the magazine complained that the story&#x27;s treatment of sex, though mild by modern standards, was too explicit. The artwork also emphasized attractive women, with a scantily clad damsel in distress or alien princess on almost every cover.

Although science fiction (sf) had been published before the 1920s, it did not begin to coalesce into a separately marketed genre until the appearance in 1926 of &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, a pulp magazine published by Hugo Gernsback. By the end of the 1930s the field was undergoing its first boom. Fiction House, a major pulp publisher, had run into difficulties during the Depression, but after a relaunch in 1934 found success with detective and romance pulp titles. Fiction House&#x27;s first title with sf interest was &quot;Jungle Stories&quot;, which was launched in early 1939; it was not primarily a science fiction magazine, but often featured storylines with marginally science fictional themes, such as survivors from Atlantis. At the end of 1939, Fiction House decided to add an sf magazine to its lineup; it was titled &quot;Planet Stories&quot;, and was published by Love Romances, a subsidiary company that had been created to publish Fiction House&#x27;s romance titles. The first issue was dated Winter 1939. Two comics were launched at the same time: &quot;Jungle Comics&quot; and &quot;Planet Comics&quot;; both were published monthly, whereas &quot;Planet Stories&quot; was quarterly, and it is quite likely that the success of the comics funded the early issues of the pulps.

Malcolm Reiss edited &quot;Planet Stories&quot; from the beginning, and retained editorial oversight and control throughout its run, though he was not always the named editor on the masthead; when other editors were involved, his title was &quot;managing editor&quot;. The first of these sub-editors was Wilbur S. Peacock, who took over with the Fall 1942 issue and remained until Fall 1945, after which he was replaced by Chester Whitehorn for three issues, and then by Paul L. Payne, from Fall 1946 to Spring 1950.

With the Summer 1950 issue the editorship passed to Jerome Bixby, who was already editing &quot;Jungle Stories&quot;. Soon thereafter &quot;Planet Stories&quot; switched from a quarterly to bimonthly schedule. Bixby lasted a little over a year; Malcolm Reiss took over again in September 1951, and three issues later, in March 1952, Jack O&#x27;Sullivan became editor. A contemporary market survey records that in 1953, payment rates were only one to two cents per word; this was substantially less than the leading magazines of the day. &quot;Planet Stories&quot; returned to a quarterly schedule beginning with the Summer 1954 issue, but the pulp market was collapsing, and the Summer 1955 issue was the final one.

==Contents and reception==
Fiction House apparently made the decision to launch &quot;Planet Stories&quot; so quickly that there was little time for Reiss to obtain new stories, so he worked with Julius Schwartz and other authors&#x27; agents to fill the first issue. The results were unremarkable, but Reiss was energetic, and was able to improve the quality of fiction in succeeding issues, though he occasionally apologized to the readers for printing weak material. The magazine was exclusively focused on interplanetary adventures, often taking place in primitive societies that would now be regarded as &quot;sword and sorcery&quot; settings, and was aimed at a young readership; the result was a mixture of what became known as space opera and planetary romances—melodramatic tales of action and adventure on alien planets and in interplanetary space. &quot;Planet Stories&quot; relied on a few authors to provide the bulk of its fiction in the early years, with Nelson Bond providing eight lead stories, some of them novels. Fourteen more were written by Ray Cummings and Ross Rocklynne; and Leigh Brackett was also a regular contributor, with seventeen stories in total published over the lifetime of the magazine.

The letter column in &quot;Planet Stories&quot; was titled &quot;The Vizigraph&quot;; it was very active, with long letters from an engaged readership. It often printed letters from established writers, and from fans who would go on to become well known professionally: Damon Knight&#x27;s letters are described by sf historian Mike Ashley as &quot;legendary&quot;; and Robert Silverberg commented in a letter in the Summer 1950 issue that Ray Bradbury &quot;certainly gets some original ideas, if not good ones&quot;. The editors put a good deal of effort into keeping the letter column friendly and lively; contemporary writer and editor Robert Lowndes recalls that &quot;Reiss was sincere and urbane; Wilbur [Peacock] enjoyed taking his coat off and being one of the crowd&quot;.

Despite the focus on melodramatic space adventure, the fiction in &quot;Planet Stories&quot; improved over the next few years, largely due to the work of Brackett and Bradbury. Both writers set many of their stories on a romanticized version of Mars that owed much to the Barsoom of Edgar Rice Burroughs. Brackett&#x27;s writing improved during the 1940s from formulaic pulp adventure to a more mature style, and she became the most accomplished writer of planetary romances of her day. She wrote a well-received series of stories featuring adventurer Eric John Stark, which began in the Summer 1949 &quot;Planet Stories&quot; with &quot;Queen of the Martian Catacombs&quot;. Her work had a strong influence on other writers, in particular Gardner F. Fox, Lin Carter and Marion Zimmer Bradley, Brackett later argued that &quot;the so-called space opera is the folk-tale, the hero-tale of our particular niche in history&quot;. Also arguing in support of &quot;Planet Stories&quot;, science fiction critic John Clute has commented that &quot;the content was far more sophisticated than the covers&quot;.

Bradbury&#x27;s work for &quot;Planet Stories&quot; included two of the stories that he later incorporated into &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot;, including &quot;The Million Year Picnic&quot;; only one other story in the series had appeared before this. He also collaborated on a story with Brackett, &quot;Lorelei of the Red Mist&quot;, based on an idea of hers, which appeared in the Summer of 1946. His stories for &quot;Planet&quot; demonstrate his reservations about the advance of technology, in particular &quot;The Golden Apples of the Sun&quot; (November 1953), and &quot;A Sound of Thunder&quot; (January 1954, reprinted from the June 28, 1952 issue of &quot;Collier&#x27;s Weekly&quot;). Bradbury&#x27;s work in &quot;Planet Stories&quot; is regarded by one pulp historian, Tim de Forest, as &quot;the magazine&#x27;s most important contribution to the genre&quot;.

Several other well-known writers appeared in &quot;Planet Stories&quot;, including Isaac Asimov, Clifford Simak, James Blish, Fredric Brown and Damon Knight. Asimov&#x27;s story, originally titled &quot;Pilgrimage&quot;, appeared in 1942; Asimov had been unable to sell the piece elsewhere, and rewrote it numerous times for different editors, adding a religious element at John Campbell&#x27;s request, and removing it again when Malcolm Reiss asked for further changes. Reiss bought it but changed the name to &quot;Black Friar of the Flame&quot;.

Jerome Bixby, who took over as editor in 1950, was a published writer and was knowledgeable about sf, though he had primarily written western fiction. In his short tenure he did much to improve the magazine, persuading the established writers to produce better material and finding unusual variations on the interplanetary adventure theme such as Poul Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Duel on Syrtis&quot; in March 1951, about an Earthman tracking an alien on Mars, and Theodore Sturgeon&#x27;s &quot;The Incubi on Planet X&quot;, about aliens who kidnap Earth women. After Bixby&#x27;s departure in 1952, &quot;Planet Stories&quot;″ major contribution to the genre was the discovery of Philip K. Dick, whose first sale, &quot;Beyond Lies the Wub&quot;, appeared in the July 1952 issue. Dick went on to sell another four stories to &quot;Planet Stories&quot; over the next two years, including &quot;James P. Crow&quot;, in which a human suffers discrimination in a world of robots.

&quot;Planet Stories&quot; clearly targeted a young readership, and the simultaneous launch in 1939 of &quot;Planet Comics&quot; may have been instrumental in attracting young readers to science fiction, but Ashley suggests that it is more likely that &quot;Planet Stories&quot; attracted experienced readers of the genre who &quot;still yearned for the early days of sf&quot;. Critic and sf historian Thomas Clareson has commented that &quot;&quot;Planet&quot; seemed to look backward towards the 1930s and earlier&quot;, an impression that was strengthened by the extensive use of interior artwork by Frank Paul, who had been the cover artist for the early Gernsback magazines in the 1920s. Paul&#x27;s distinctive style was strongly associated with the early years of the field. The cover art was also melodramatic, with beautiful women—sometimes human, sometimes princesses from other planets—and threatening aliens. The subheading on the cover read &quot;Strange Adventures on Other Worlds – The Universe of Future Centuries&quot; until the end of 1946.

Although almost every story that appeared in &quot;Planet&quot; could be described as space opera, there was some variety of approach to the basic themes. Earth was sometimes threatened, but more often the action took place on other worlds, bringing Earthmen into local conflicts. This often involved beautiful native princesses, though the romantic storylines were stereotyped. Some respite from these depictions of women was provided by Leigh Brackett, who described her own heroines as &quot;usually on the bitchy side—warm-blooded, hot-tempered, but gutty and intelligent&quot; (with &quot;bitchy&quot; intended as a compliment). During World War II, it was in &quot;Planet Stories&quot; that a reader was most likely to come across a female character who could fight, instead of merely being fought over. Sex itself had long been taboo in the pulp magazines, but some stories in &quot;Planet&quot; depicted sexuality more directly than the competing magazines would. The readers were not always accepting; one reader in a letter in 1949 supported &quot;jettisoning the taboos&quot;, but a letter writer in 1946 objected to &quot;Lorelei of the Red Mist&quot;, saying that he needed &quot;a pint of Listerine to wash the dirty taste out of my mouth&quot;. The cover artwork generally emphasized sex as well, with what sf author and critic Harry Harrison sardonically referred to as &quot;sexual dimorphism in space&quot;: heavy, functional spacesuits for the men, and transparent suits through which bikinis or swimsuits could be seen for the women.

Hannes Bok contributed much of the interior artwork, and the covers were often by Allen Anderson during the early years. Later, Kelly Freas became a frequent cover artist. One of the best artists to work on &quot;Planet&quot; was Alexander Leydenfrost, whose work, according to Clareson, &quot;epitomized much of what &quot;Planet Stories&quot; represented in the 1940s&quot;, though his cover artwork was less impressive than his black-and-white interior illustrations. Artist and sf historian David Hardy has described Leydenfrost&#x27;s black and white illustrations as &quot;almost Rembrandtian in his use of light and shade&quot;.

==Bibliographic details==
The editorial succession at &quot;Planet&quot; was:
* Malcolm Reiss: Winter 1939 – Summer 1942.
* Wilbur S. Peacock: Fall 1942 – Fall 1945.
* Chester Whitehorn: Winter 1945 – Summer 1946.
* Paul L. Payne: Fall 1946 – Spring 1950.
* Jerome Bixby: Summer 1950 – July 1951.
* Malcolm Reiss: September 1951 – January 1952.
* Jack O&#x27;Sullivan: March 1952 – Summer 1955.

&quot;Planet Stories&quot; was a pulp-sized magazine for all of its 71 issues. It was 128 pages for most of its existence, and was priced at 20 cents. With the November 1950 issue the page count was cut to 112, and the price went up to 25 cents. The page count was reduced to 96 for one issue in March 1952, but then returned to 112 until Summer 1954, when it was again reduced to 96 pages for the last five issues.

&quot;Planet&quot; began as a quarterly. A brief attempt was made to switch to a bimonthly schedule in 1943; a March and May issue appeared, but the next issue was titled Fall 1943, inaugurating another quarterly period. The Fall 1950 issue was followed by November 1950, and this began a bimonthly period that lasted until May 1954, which was followed by a Summer 1954 issue. A quarterly schedule resumed until the end; unusually, the winter issue that year was dated Winter 1954/55, rather than with a single year. The volume numbering was consistent throughout the magazine&#x27;s publication, with five volumes of 12 issues and a final volume of 11, but there were three errors in the volume numbering printed on the spine (though not on the masthead): issue 5/10 was given as 5/8 on the spine; issue 5/11 was given as 6/3 on the spine; and issue 6/11 was given as 6/12 on the spine.

A British reprint edition appeared between March 1950 and September 1954; the issues were numbered but not dated, and were heavily cut, with only 64 to 68 pages. There are twelve issues known; a thirteenth has been rumored but not seen by any sf bibliographers. The publisher was Pembertons, though some sources indicate that Streamline Publications was the publisher of the first issue. Issues 7 and 8 of the British edition also contained nonfiction material reprinted from &quot;Startling Stories&quot; and &quot;Thrilling Wonder&quot;. A Canadian edition was published by American News Co., from Fall 1948 to March 1951 (a total of twelve issues); these were identical to the corresponding U.S. editions.

===Related publications===
In the summer of 1950 Fiction House launched a companion magazine to &quot;Planet&quot;. It was titled &quot;Two Complete Science-Adventure Books&quot;; the policy was to print two novels in a single magazine. It appeared three times a year and lasted until the spring of 1954. In 1953 Fiction House launched a reprint magazine, &quot;Tops in Science Fiction&quot;, selecting the contents from the backfile of stories that had appeared in &quot;Planet&quot;. It only lasted for two issues, the second of which received almost no distribution.

A derivative anthology, &quot;The Best of Planet Stories&quot; #1, appeared in 1975 from Ballantine Books, edited by Leigh Brackett, containing seven stories reprinted from between 1942 and 1952. It was intended to be the first of a series, but no further volumes appeared.

<text>The 1956 Saskatchewan general election, the thirteenth in the province&#x27;s history, was held on June 20, 1956, to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan. The Co-operative Commonwealth Federation government of Premier Tommy Douglas was re-elected to a fourth consecutive majority government.

==Summary==
Tommy Douglas&#x27; Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) secured a majority government, despite its share of the popular vote decreasing close to 10%. The party won 6 fewer seats than it had in the 1952 election. The election victory secured a fourth term in office.

The Liberal Party of Alexander H. McDonald also lost votes, but picked up an additional three seats.

The Social Credit Party rebounded from its poor results in previous elections, surging to win over 21% of the popular vote. However, because this vote was widely distributed across the province, the party won only 3 seats in the legislature under the British parliamentary first-past-the-post system.

<text>The 1960 Saskatchewan general election was held on June 8, 1960, to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan.

The Co-operative Commonwealth Federation of Thomas C. Douglas campaigned promising Medicare, a public medical insurance and delivery plan for all of Saskatchewan, and it was re-elected with a slightly increased majority. The CCF won despite organized opposition from the College of Physicians and Surgeons, which told voters that Medicare would take freedom of choice away from patients and would cause doctors to leave the province.

A year later, Douglas passed legislation making Saskatchewan the first province in Canada to have Medicare. The same year, Douglas resigned as leader of the CCF to become leader of the federal New Democratic Party, handing over the premiership to Woodrow Lloyd.

==Campaigns==
In addition to the elections campaigns led by the four main political parties, the College of Physicians and Surgeons launched a full-scale campaign against Medicare.

===CCF===
The Saskatchewan CCF, led by Douglas, proposed &quot;a province-wide medical care program.&quot; Douglas assured voters that the only thing that would change about the medical system would be that the doctor would bill the medical care plan instead of billing the patient. The CCF won the election, with 37 seats, one more than in the previous election in 1956.

===Progressive Conservatives===
The Progressive Conservative Party of Saskatchewan, led by Martin Pederson, a 38-year-old farmer, won considerable support in the cities (Regina and Saskatoon), but they were not able to win any seats in the legislature. The 15 federal Progressive Conservative Members of Parliament from Saskatchewan campaigned for the provincial party. The main issue for the party was not Medicare but farm prosperity. It promised farmers grant of a $1 per acre ($247/km2) from the province, with a maximum of $100. It claimed that this program would be made possible by assistance from the federal government of Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, from Saskatchewan himself and a former leader of the Saskatchewan PCs. On Medicare, it only proposed a Royal Commission.

===Liberals===
The Liberal Party of Saskatchewan, led by Ross Thatcher of Moose Jaw, claimed that Pederson&#x27;s promise of land payments was tantamount to bribery. It won 17 seats, and formed the official opposition. Thatcher, a former member of the CCF, was concerned about the economic problems in the province. He was neutral on Medicare and stated that it would be up to the people of Saskatchewan to decide whether or not the province would implement it. The party was also in favour of pre-paid medical insurance.

The Liberals were concerned that the economic development of Saskatchewan had lagged behind the rest of Canada during the Douglas era. They were also concerned about the proposed merger of the CCF and the Canadian Labour Congress, which later led to the formation of the New Democratic Party.

===Social Credit===
The Social Credit Party of Saskatchewan was led by the 38-year-old Martin Kelln, who had strong views about monetary reform and the social credit movement, and was viewed by many as a serious threat to the ruling CCF government. However, the party was unable to win any seats. It was the only party openly opposed to Medicare.

===College of Physicians and Surgeons===
The College of Physisicans and Surgeons ran a campaign against Medicare. Almost all doctors in Saskatchewan were against it, and many had pamphlets available in their offices. The college paid for anti-Medicare ads in newspapers and on television. The college used scare tactics to frighten the public by claiming, for example, that patients would just be numbers and that patients would be assigned new doctors based on their names or that the government would be able to pass on medical secrets of patients.

==Electoral system==
In this election, Saskatchewan used a mixture of single-member districts, electing through First past the post, and multiple-member districts, electing through Plurality block voting.

==Results==

Notes:
1Compared to Labor-Progressive Party in 1956.
2One seat declared void.

<text>The 1964 Saskatchewan general election was held on April 22, 1964, to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan.

The Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) government of Premier Woodrow Lloyd was defeated by the Liberal Party, led by Ross Thatcher. The CCF had governed Saskatchewan since the 1944 election under the leadership (until December 1961) of Tommy Douglas.

By 1964 the provincial Social Credit Party had collapsed, nominating only two candidates. In another morale hit, the federal Social Credit Party endorsed the Liberals during the election. While the CCF held on to nearly all of their vote from the previous election and only trailed the Liberals by 0.1%, most of the shift in Social Credit support went to the Liberals and proved decisive in helping to push Thatcher to a majority government.

The Progressive Conservative Party also picked up some support at the expense of Social Credit but won only one seat in the legislature, that of leader Martin Pederson.

==Election campaign==

Douglas&#x27; government was the first social democratic government in North America, and had introduced the medicare system in Canada. This led to a 23-day strike by the province&#x27;s physicians. Universal public health care, however, was not an issue in the campaign. In fact, following its successful introduction, the opposition Liberals were for expanding Medicare even more. The only provincial party to advocate eliminating Medicare was the small Social Credit Party.

The Social Credit party nominated only two candidates in the election, and they were hurt by statements by the federal Social Credit party leader, Robert N. Thompson, supporting the Saskatchewan Liberals. The Socreds&#x27; leader, Martin Kelln, chose not to spend much time on the campaign, in part because of the recent death of his mother.

The Progressive Conservatives returned to the Legislative Assembly for the first time since 1934. They won only one seat despite winning almost 19% of the popular vote. The Tories promised to keep Medicare in place, but opposed the Liberals&#x27; plans to expand it. They argued that the Liberals were too radical, and that the CCF government was not doing enough to develop the province&#x27;s natural resources.

The Liberals were able to capitalize on the collapse of Social Credit and were more effective than the Tories in drawing the &quot;anti-socialist&quot; (anti-CCF) vote. Yet the campaign was not marked by any major issues.

There was, however, considerable animosity between the Liberals and the CCF. The Liberals employed what were called &quot;Madison Avenue campaign tactics&quot; and spent a lot of money on campaign advertising, especially television advertising. They tried to characterize the election as being a choice between socialism and private enterprise-oriented reform. The Saskatchewan Liberals ran well to the right of the federal Liberals and claimed that the CCF government was stagnating.

A warning sign came in the 1962 federal election. The federal CCF had merged with the Canadian Labour Congress to form the New Democratic Party, though the Saskatchewan branch kept the CCF name. Douglas resigned as premier and party leader to become the NDP&#x27;s first leader, and was succeeded by then-Treasurer Woodrow Lloyd, a former teacher. However, the NDP was completely shut out in Saskatchewan, and Douglas lost by almost 10,000 votes in his bid for a Regina-area riding.

The CCF campaigned heavily on its 17-year record in government. Lloyd attacked the Liberal campaign, stating that they had resorted to &quot;hucksterism, the kind of sales attempts that one usually associates with useless pills, second hand cars and body deodorants.&quot;

Lloyd faced several challenges: taxes in Saskatchewan were among the highest in Canada; spending on health care, welfare and education were high; and he lacked the popular support Douglas had enjoyed. However, Saskatchewan had the second highest per capita income in Canada and the lowest unemployment rate in Canada.

==Electoral system==
In this election, Saskatchewan used a mixture of single-member districts, electing through First past the post, and multiple-member districts, electing through Plurality block voting.

Before the next election, Saskatchewan switched to consistent single-member districts.

<doc id="1162309" wikidata="Q3586444" url="?curid=1162309" title="1967 Saskatchewan general election">
<text>The 1967 Saskatchewan general election was held on October 11, 1967, to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan.

The Liberal Party of Saskatchewan, led by Premier Ross Thatcher, was re-elected with a slightly larger majority in the legislature and a larger share of the popular vote.

The Co-operative Commonwealth Federation had changed its name to the New Democratic Party to match the change that had already been made at the federal level. Still led by former Premier Woodrow Lloyd, the NDP also won an increased share of the popular vote but lost one of the seats that the CCF had won in the previous election.

The Liberal and NDP gains in the popular vote came at the expense of the Progressive Conservative Party of Saskatchewan of Martin Pederson, which lost about half of its votes. Pederson finished third in the constituency he had won three years earlier, and no other PC members were elected. However, a PC candidate finished second in Athabasca.

It was the first election in which the cities of Regina, Saskatoon and Moose Jaw were divided into two or more ridings instead of having a single city-wide multiple-member district for each city. Previously those cities had elected their MLAs through Plurality block voting, but starting in this election, the city MLAs began to be elected through First past the post.

It was the last election, as of 2020, in which the leaders of both the government and the opposition in Saskatchewan represented rural constituencies. It was also the last election contested by the Social Credit Party, which nominated six candidates. To date this is the last election in which the Saskatchewan Liberal Party won a majority of seats.

<text>James Manuel Costa (born April 13, 1952) is an American politician serving as the U.S. representative for since 2023. He previously represented the 20th congressional district from 2005 to 2013 and the 16th congressional district from 2013 to 2023. A member of the Democratic Party, his district includes most of Fresno.

Costa served in the California State Assembly from 1978 to 1994, and then in the California State Senate from 1994 until 2002. During his time in the Assembly, he served as Majority Caucus Chair. Costa chaired the Blue Dog Coalition in the U.S. House of Representatives during the 116th Congress and chaired the Subcommittee on Livestock and Foreign Agriculture during the 117th Congress.

==Early life and education==
Costa was born on April 13, 1952, in Fresno, California. His parents were Manuel and Lena Cardoso Costa. His grandparents immigrated from the Azores, a Portuguese archipelago in the North Atlantic, in the early 20th century. Three of them were unable to read or write and initially found work as laborers on dairy farms before eventually establishing their own. His parents grew up speaking Portuguese and did not learn English until they started school. He grew up working on the family farm.

Costa attended San Joaquin Memorial High School, a private Catholic school in Fresno, where he graduated in 1970. He then enrolled at California State University, Fresno (commonly known as Fresno State), earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1974. While in college, he was a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon and interned in the office of U.S. Representative B. F. Sisk. 

Following his graduation, Costa worked as an aide to U.S. Representative John Krebs, assisting in policy matters related to California&#x27;s Central Valley. He later became chief of staff to California State Assemblyman and future U.S. Representative Rick Lehman.

==California Legislature==
In 1978, Costa was elected to a seat in the California State Assembly. At the time of his election to the Assembly, he was the youngest member of the state legislature at age 26. He represented part of Fresno County in the legislature for 24 years, serving in the state Assembly for 16 years (1978–1994) and in the state Senate for eight years (1994–2002). He was a sponsor of the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, a bill signed into law in 1995 that prohibits rent control on single-family homes, condominiums, and any rental unit constructed after February 1, 1995.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===

==== 2004 ====

In 2004, Costa entered the Democratic primary for the 20th Congressional District, which was opened up by the retirement of Cal Dooley, its seven-term incumbent. Dooley endorsed his chief of staff, Lisa Quigley, as his successor, but most of the state&#x27;s Democratic Party establishment, including Senator Dianne Feinstein, endorsed Costa, who won the bruising primary and faced Republican state senator Roy Ashburn in November.

The 20th District at the time was a heavily Democratic, 63% Latino-majority district; it gave Al Gore his highest vote total outside the state&#x27;s two large conurbations (Sacramento and the San Francisco Bay Area in the north and Los Angeles and San Diego in the south). Nonetheless, the Republicans spent a substantial amount of money on the race. Ashburn&#x27;s campaign made plays on Costa&#x27;s name (&quot;Costa&#x27;s going to cost ya&quot;) and linked him to former governor Gray Davis, calling them &quot;two taxing twins&quot;. Costa won the election with 54% of the vote to Ashburn&#x27;s 46%. Ashburn kept the margin within single digits by winning heavily Republican Kings County.

==== 2006 ====

In 2006, Costa was unopposed for re-election. The Democrats won control of the House in that election, and Costa became chair of the Natural Resources Committee&#x27;s Energy and Mineral Resources Subcommittee. He is a member of the House Agriculture Committee.

==== 2008 ====

Costa was re-elected in 2008 with 74% of the vote, the highest percentage for a Democratic incumbent outside Sacramento, the Bay Area, and Southern California.

==== 2010 ====

In 2010, Costa was challenged for re-election by Republican Andy Vidak. In his closest race yet, the race was officially called for Costa nearly three weeks after election day, with the unofficial final tally standing at 45,806 votes (51.8%) for Costa and 42,773 (48.2%) for Vidak.

==== 2012 ====

For his first four terms, Costa represented a district including most of the majority-Latino portions of Fresno and Bakersfield. Redistricting after the 2010 census renumbered his 20th district as the 21st and made it slightly more Republican. In February 2012, Costa announced that he would run in the newly formed 16th district, a much more compact district that included most of Fresno as well as most of Merced. That district had previously been the 19th, represented by freshman Republican Jeff Denham. Denham&#x27;s home had been drawn into the neighboring 10th district (formerly the 18th), and he sought re-election there. While most of Costa&#x27;s old territory remained in the 21st, the new 16th absorbed most of the old 20th&#x27;s share of Fresno County, including his home.

Costa faced Republican Brian Whelan in the general election. After the new districts were announced, it was reported that the NRCC considered Costa vulnerable, but had the district existed in 2008, Barack Obama would have carried it with 57% of the vote.

In November 2011, the League of Conservation Voters ran a series of television ads in Costa&#x27;s district criticizing his environmental record. Costa was reelected with 54% of the vote.

==== 2014 ====

Costa faced an unexpectedly close race in 2014 against Republican Johnny Tacherra, a dairy farmer from rural Fresno County. On election night, Tacherra led by 736 votes, a margin that grew to 1,772 a few days later. Tacherra&#x27;s lead narrowed as counting continued, and Costa ultimately defeated him by 1,319 votes. While Tacherra carried the district&#x27;s portions of Merced and Madera counties, Costa defeated him in Fresno County by 9,600 votes.

==== 2016 ====

In 2016, Costa was the sole Democratic candidate in the &quot;top two&quot; primary, and received 50,917 votes (55.9%). In the general election he again faced Tacherra, who had received 30,342 votes (33.1%) in the primary. Costa was reelected with 58% of the vote to Tacherra&#x27;s 42%.

==== 2018 ====

In the 2018 &quot;top two&quot; primary, Costa defeated the only Republican candidate, Elizabeth Heng, 53% to 47%. He was re-elected that fall in a Democratic &quot;wave&quot; in California, 57.5% to 42.5%.

==== 2020 ====

Costa and Republican challenger Kevin Cookingham, a former Clovis Unified School District educator, advanced through the &quot;top two&quot; primary in 2020, besting two Democratic challengers. Costa then won the general election with 59.4% of the vote to Cookingham&#x27;s 40.6%.

==== 2022 ====

For 2022, Costa was redistricted to District 21. In the general election, he defeated the Republican nominee, former FBI agent Michael Maher, with 54.2% of the vote to Maher&#x27;s 45.8%.

==== 2024 ====

Costa and Maher met in a rematch in 2024. Maher again lost, but made the race closer—he finished with 47.4% of the vote to Costa&#x27;s 52.6%.

==Political positions==
===Abortion===

===Agriculture===
Costa co-sponsored the bipartisan Agricultural Certainty for Reporting Emissions (ACRE) Act. The act would strip provisions from Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), which was responsible for ensuring cleanup of industrial toxic waste dumps, oil spills, and chemical tank explosions environmental regulations on farmland. If enacted, the act would reduce transparency by protecting livestock farmers from changes to waste storage and disposal methods. Another provision would protect farmers from strict water laws, regulated under the Clean Water Act.

===District of Columbia rights===
Costa supports DC statehood. He was a co-sponsor and voted for Washington, D.C. Admission Act, which would grant statehood to the residential areas of the current District of Columbia as the State of Washington, Douglass Commonwealth.

On February 9, 2023, Costa, along with 30 other Democrats, voted with House Republicans to reject the Revised Criminal Code Act of 2022, passed by the Council of the District of Columbia.

===Foreign affairs===

Costa was one of five House Democrats to vote to continue selling arms to Saudi Arabia and to support the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen.

Costa voted to provide Israel with support following the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.

====Armenia–Azerbaijan conflict====
Costa accused Turkey, a NATO member, of inciting the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh, saying, &quot;Azerbaijan has continued to fuel this fire by failing to recognize the sovereignty of the Republic of Artsakh, while Turkey has helped enable this aggression.&quot; On October 1, 2020, he co-signed a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that condemned Azerbaijan&#x27;s offensive operations against the Armenian-populated Republic of Artsakh, denounced Turkey&#x27;s role in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and called for an immediate ceasefire.

====Ukraine-Russia War====
In February 2023, during the Russo-Ukrainian War, Costa signed a letter advocating for President Biden to give F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine. Costa has been a regular attendee of the Yalta European Strategy annual meetings founded and sponsored by Ukrainian oligarch Victor Pinchuk.

===Health care===
Costa was reportedly a holdout vote on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, in March 2010. He ultimately voted in favor of the legislation. To gain Costa&#x27;s vote, the House leadership reportedly promised Costa and Dennis Cardoza funding for a medical school for California&#x27;s Central Valley.

===Immigration===
He is an original co-sponsor of the American Dream and Promise Act, which provides a pathway to citizenship for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients. He was instrumental in crafting the bipartisan Farmworker Modernization Act, which would give undocumented farmworkers and their family members a path to legal immigration status.

In 2025, Costa was one of 46 House Democrats who joined all Republicans to vote for the Laken Riley Act.

===Infrastructure and transportation===

In 2008, Costa wrote a piece in &quot;Capitol Weekly&quot; calling for high-speed rail in California. He advocated creating a high-speed rail system that would go up and down California as well as across the nation at speeds of 225 miles per hour. He introduced different bills to support these rails. Costa&#x27;s longtime colleague George Miller compared rail projects to President Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s highway expansion and pleaded to Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood and President Barack Obama for help with this project.

In 2015, Costa was one of 28 House Democrats to vote to build the Keystone XL pipeline.

In 2021, Costa joined a group of conservative Democrats, dubbed &quot;The Unbreakable Nine&quot;, who threatened to derail the Biden administration&#x27;s $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation package meant to tackle the nation&#x27;s infrastructure.

===Military===
In December 2017, Costa introduced legislation to allow some Hmong- and Laotian-American veterans to be buried in U.S. national cemeteries. The legislation applies to Hmong and Laotian veterans who fought alongside the U.S. against North Vietnamese forces in the 1960s and 1970s. The bill, which does not allow for burials at Arlington National Cemetery, applies only to veterans who pass away on or after the bill&#x27;s enactment. The bill was enacted in March 2018 as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018.

<text>The 1971 Saskatchewan general election was held on June 23, 1971, to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan.

Under the leadership of Allan Blakeney, the New Democratic Party of Saskatchewan returned to power after seven years in opposition. The NDP won a majority government, increasing its share of the popular vote by over 10 percentage points.

The Liberal government of Premier Ross Thatcher more or less held its share of the popular vote, but lost a significant number of seats in the legislature in part because of the continuing decline in the share of the vote won by the Progressive Conservative Party, now led by Ed Nasserden.

Ross Thatcher died on July 22, 1971, just shy of a month since losing the election.

<text>The 1975 Saskatchewan general election was held on June 11, 1975, to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan. Blakeney and the NDP were re-elected to a majority government.

Both the New Democratic government of Premier Allan Blakeney and the opposition Liberal Party, led by David Steuart, dropped in support to the resurgent Progressive Conservative Party. The Tories, who were a minor force in the previous election, drew over a quarter of the 1975 electorate.

== Campaign ==
One of the main issues of the campaign was natural resources management. At the onset of the campaign, Saskatchewan was facing court challenges and a capital strike from multinational resource extraction companies. The potash industry was opposed to the new provincial reserve tax that Blakeney&#x27;s government had introduced on that mineral the previous year. The federal government under Pierre Trudeau supported the companies&#x27; court challenges, and announced in the November 1974 federal budget that it would end the deduction of provincial royalties from federal tax.

Under these circumstances, the opposition Liberal and PC parties proposed lower natural resource royalty payments to ease the companies&#x27; concerns and bring investments back to the province. They were fiercely opposed to public ownership in the extraction and refinement of natural resources. On the other hand, Blakeney&#x27;s NDP ran on the slogan &quot;New Deal &#x27;75&quot;. The platform promised to increase royalties, and more direct government participation in the natural resources sector, especially for the development and exploration of energy resources like oil, gas, coal and uranium; and minerals like potash.

<text>The 1978 Saskatchewan general election was held on October 18, 1978, to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan.

The New Democratic government of Premier Allan Blakeney was returned for a third consecutive term with an increased majority in the legislature, and a larger share of the popular vote.

The Progressive Conservative Party of Richard Collver continued to increase its share of the popular vote in this election. They were the only other party to win seats and became the official opposition to the Blakeney government.

Fierce political infighting in the Liberal Party after the resignation of leader David Steuart led to electoral disaster in 1978. The Liberals had lost two of the 15 seats they won in 1975 to by-elections and two more Grits crossed the floor to the Tories prior to the 1978 election. Under the disputed leadership of Ted Malone, the Liberals lost all of the 11 seats they still held in the legislature and more than half the votes it had won in the 1975 election.

<text>The 1982 Saskatchewan general election was held on April 26, 1982, to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan.

The Progressive Conservative Party, led by Grant Devine, defeated the New Democratic Party government of Premier Allan Blakeney, which had governed the province since the 1971 election. The Tories won over half the popular vote, and a large majority in the legislature – the first time that the party had won an outright majority, and making Devine only the second Tory premier in the province&#x27;s history. The only other time that the Tories had ever led a government was after the 1929 election, when James Anderson led a coalition government of Conservatives, Progressives and independents.

The NDP vote fell to its lowest level since 1938, and the party lost 35 of its 44 seats in the legislature – the second-worst defeat of a sitting government in the province&#x27;s history, behind only the Saskatchewan Liberal Party&#x27;s 38-seat loss in 1944. The highest-profile casualty was Deputy Premier Roy Romanow, who was ousted by Tory challenger Jo-Ann Zazelenchuk as part of the Tories&#x27; sweep of Saskatoon.

This election included the Aboriginal People&#x27;s Party, a party focused on issues affecting Saskatchewan&#x27;s First Nations. The APP&#x27;s best showing would be in the Cumberland district of northeast Saskatchewan, finishing third – ahead of the Liberal candidate.

Popular feelings of alienation in Saskatchewan from Ottawa reached a high point in 1982. The provincial wing of the Western Canada Concept movement won more votes than the Saskatchewan Liberal Party candidate in over a third of Saskatchewan&#x27;s constituencies; in three ridings the WCC candidate captured more than 1,000 votes. The WCC would disappear by 1988, and be replaced by the Western Independence Party, and later the Buffalo Party, in the 21st century.

<text>The 1986 Saskatchewan general election, the twenty-first in the history of the province, was held on October 20, 1986, to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan.

== Summary ==
The Progressive Conservative government of Premier Grant Devine was returned for a second term with a reduced majority in the legislature.

While the New Democratic Party managed to significantly increase its share of the popular vote and its presence in the legislature, former Premier Allan Blakeney&#x27;s attempt to return to power was unsuccessful. Despite winning more votes than the Tories, much of the NDP margin was seen in landslides in the major urban centres of Regina and Saskatoon—while the party won eight seats in each of those cities, the NDP won only nine seats throughout the rest of the province. As a result, they were consigned to Official Opposition status for another term.

The Liberal Party captured almost 10% of the popular vote, but elected only one member—party leader Ralph Goodale—to the legislature.

<text>The 1991 Saskatchewan general election was held on October 21, 1991, to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan.

The Progressive Conservative government of Premier Grant Devine was defeated by the New Democratic Party, led by former provincial Attorney General Roy Romanow. A major source of dissatisfaction with the Grant Devine government was the &quot;Fair Share Saskatchewan&quot; program, a scheme to distribute public service jobs more evenly across the province; a plan especially unpopular with workers scheduled to be relocated from Regina to rural districts. The Devine government was also notorious for a home construction and renovation relief program which reimbursed homeowners who did their own renovations. Another factor was the unpopularity of the federal Progressive Conservatives under then Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.

The NDP was able to win more than half of the popular vote, and an overwhelming majority in the legislature. The Tories lost almost three-quarters of the seats they had held in the legislature, and a significant share of the popular vote. Their loss in vote percentage resulted in 30 third-place finishes; this was more than their 26 second-place finishes or their ten seats won.

The Liberal Party – led by Lynda Haverstock – was able to attract a substantial share of disaffected Tory voters. However, despite winning almost one-quarter of the vote, their support was too spread out across the province to translate into seats. Haverstock was the only Liberal returned to the legislature.

<doc id="1162324" wikidata="Q1193847" url="?curid=1162324" title="The General in His Labyrinth">
<text>The General in His Labyrinth (original Spanish title: ) is a 1989 dictator novel by Colombian writer and Nobel laureate Gabriel García Márquez. It is a fictionalized account of the last seven months of Simón Bolívar, liberator and leader of Gran Colombia. The book traces Bolívar&#x27;s final journey from Bogotá to the Caribbean coastline of Colombia in his attempt to leave South America for exile in Europe. Breaking with the traditional heroic portrayal of Bolívar , García Márquez depicts a pathetic protagonist, a prematurely aged man who is physically ill and mentally exhausted. The story explores the labyrinth of Bolívar&#x27;s life through the narrative of his memories, in which &quot;despair, sickness, and death inevitably win out over love, health, and life&quot;.

Following the success of &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot; (1967) and &quot;Love in the Time of Cholera&quot; (1985), García Márquez decided to write about the &quot;Great Liberator&quot; after reading an unfinished novel by his friend Álvaro Mutis. He borrowed the setting—Bolívar&#x27;s voyage down the Magdalena River in 1830—from Mutis. García Márquez spent two years researching the subject, encompassing the extensive memoirs of Bolívar&#x27;s Irish aide-de-camp, Daniel Florencio O&#x27;Leary, as well as numerous other historical documents and consultations with academics.

Its mixture of genres makes &quot;The General in His Labyrinth&quot; difficult to classify, and commentators disagree over where it lies on the scale between novel and historical account. García Márquez&#x27;s insertion of interpretive and fictionalized elements—some dealing with Bolívar&#x27;s most intimate moments—initially caused outrage in parts of Latin America. Many prominent Latin American figures believed that the novel portrayed a negative image to the outside world of one of the region&#x27;s most important historic figures. Others saw &quot;The General in His Labyrinth&quot; as a tonic for Latin American culture and a challenge to the region to deal with its problems.

== Background ==

The initial idea to write a book about Simón Bolívar came to García Márquez through his friend and fellow Colombian writer Álvaro Mutis, to whom the book is dedicated. Mutis had started writing a book called about Bolívar&#x27;s final voyage along the Magdalena River, but never finished it. At the time, García Márquez was interested in writing about the Magdalena River because he knew the area intimately from his childhood. Two years after reading , García Márquez asked Mutis for his permission to write a book on Bolívar&#x27;s last voyage.

García Márquez believed that most of the information available on Bolívar was one-dimensional: &quot;No one ever said in Bolívar&#x27;s biographies that he sang or that he was constipated ... but historians don&#x27;t say these things because they think they are not important.&quot; In the epilogue to the novel, García Márquez writes that he researched the book for two years; the task was difficult, both because of his lack of experience in conducting historical research, and the lack of documentary evidence for the events of the final period of Bolívar&#x27;s life.

García Márquez researched a wide variety of historical documents, including Bolívar&#x27;s letters, 19th-century newspapers, and Daniel Florencio O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s 34 volumes of memoirs. He engaged the help of various experts, among them geographer Gladstone Oliva; historian and fellow Colombian Eugenio Gutiérrez Celys, who had co-written a book called with historian Fabio Puyo; and astronomer Jorge Perezdoval—García Márquez used an inventory drawn up by Perezdoval to describe which nights Bolívar spent under a full moon. García Márquez also worked closely with Antonio Bolívar Goyanes, a distant relative of Bolívar, during the extensive editing of the book.

=== Historical context ===
The novel is set in 1830, at the tail end of the initial campaign to secure Latin America&#x27;s independence from Spain. Most of Spanish America had gained independence by this date; only Cuba and Puerto Rico remained under Spanish rule.

Within a few decades of Christopher Columbus&#x27;s landing on the coast of what is now Venezuela in 1498, South America had been effectively conquered by Spain and Portugal. By the beginning of the 19th century, several factors affected Spain&#x27;s control over its colonies: Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Spain in 1808, the abdication of Charles IV, Ferdinand VII&#x27;s renouncement of his right to succeed, and the placement of Joseph Bonaparte on the Spanish throne. The colonies were virtually cut off from Spain, and the American and French Revolutions inspired many creoles—American-born descendants of Spanish settlers—to take advantage of Spanish weakness. As a result, Latin America was run by independent &quot;juntas&quot; and colonial self-governments.

The early 19th century saw the first attempts at securing liberation from Spain, which were led in northern South America by Bolívar. He and the independence movements won numerous battles in Venezuela, New Granada and present-day Ecuador and Peru. His dream of uniting the Spanish American nations under one central government was almost achieved. However, shortly after the South American colonies became independent of Spain, problems developed in the capitals, and civil wars were sparked in some provinces; Bolívar lost many of his supporters and fell ill. Opposition to his presidency continued to increase, and in 1830, after 11 years of rule, he resigned as president of Gran Colombia.

== Plot summary ==

The novel is written in the third-person with flashbacks to specific events in the life of Simón Bolívar, &quot;the General&quot;. It begins on May 8, 1830, in Santa Fe de Bogotá. The General is preparing for his journey towards the port of Cartagena de Indias, intending to leave Colombia for Europe. Following his resignation as President of Gran Colombia, the people of the lands he liberated have now turned against him, scrawling anti-Bolívar graffiti and throwing waste at him. The General is anxious to move on, but has to remind the Vice-president-elect, General Domingo Caycedo, that he has yet to receive a valid passport to leave the country. The General leaves Bogotá with the few officials still faithful to him, including his confidante and aide-de-camp, José Palacios. At the end of the first chapter, the General is referred to by his full title, General Simón José Antonio de la Santísima Trinidad Bolívar y Palacios, for the only time in the novel.

On the first night of the voyage, the General stays at Facatativá with his entourage, which consists of José Palacios, five aides-de-camp, his clerks, and his dogs. Here, as throughout the journey that follows, the General&#x27;s loss of prestige is evident; the downturn in his fortunes surprises even the General himself. His unidentified illness has led to his physical deterioration, which makes him unrecognizable, and his aide-de-camp is constantly mistaken for the Liberator.

After many delays, the General and his party arrive in Honda, where the Governor, Posada Gutiérrez, has arranged for three days of fiestas. On his last night in Honda, the General returns late to camp and finds one of his old friends, Miranda Lyndsay, waiting for him. The General recalls that fifteen years ago, she had learned of a plot against his life and had saved him. The following morning, the General begins the voyage down the Magdalena River. Both his physical debilitation and pride are evident as he negotiates the slope to the dock: he is in need of a sedan chair but refuses to use it. The group stays a night in Puerto Real, where the General claims he sees a woman singing during the night. His aides-de-camp and the watchman conduct a search, but they fail to uncover any sign of a woman having been in the vicinity.

The General and his entourage arrive at the port of Mompox. Here they are stopped by police, who fail to recognize the General. They ask for his passport, but he is unable to produce one. Eventually, the police discover his identity and escort him into the port. The people still believe him to be the President of Gran Colombia and prepare banquets in his honor; but these festivities are wasted on him due to his lack of strength and appetite. After several days, the General and his entourage set off for Turbaco.

The group spend a sleepless night in Barranca Nueva before they arrive in Turbaco. Their original plan was to continue to Cartagena the following day, but the General is informed that there is no available ship bound for Europe from the port and that his passport still has not arrived. While staying in the town, he receives a visit from General Mariano Montilla and a few other friends. The deterioration of his health becomes increasingly evident—one of his visitors describes his face as that of a dead man. In Turbaco, the General is joined by General Daniel Florencio O&#x27;Leary and receives news of ongoing political machinations: Joaquín Mosquera, appointed successor as President of Gran Colombia, has assumed power but his legitimacy is still contested by General Rafael Urdaneta. The General recalls that his &quot;dream began to fall apart on the very day it was realized&quot;.

The General finally receives his passport, and two days later he sets off with his entourage for Cartagena and the coast, where more receptions are held in his honor. Throughout this time, he is surrounded by women but is too weak to engage in sexual relations. The General is deeply affected when he hears that his good friend and preferred successor for the presidency, Field Marshal Sucre, has been ambushed and assassinated.

The General is now told by one of his aides-de-camp that General Rafael Urdaneta has taken over the government in Bogotá, and there are reports of demonstrations and riots in support of a return to power by Bolívar. The General&#x27;s group travel to the town of Soledad, where he stays for more than a month, his health declining further. In Soledad, the General agrees to see a physician for the first time.

The General never leaves South America. He finishes his journey in Santa Marta, too weak to continue and with only his doctor and his closest aides by his side. He dies in poverty, a shadow of the man who liberated much of the continent.

== Characters ==

===The General===
The leading character in the novel is &quot;the General&quot;, also called &quot;the Liberator&quot;. García Márquez only once names his protagonist as Simón Bolívar, the famous historical figure, whose full title was General Simón José Antonio de la Santísima Trinidad Bolívar y Palacios, on whom the General&#x27;s character is based. The novel&#x27;s portrait of a national and Latin American hero, which challenges the historical record, provoked outrage in some quarters on its publication.

At the beginning of the novel, the General is 46 years old and slowly dying on his last journey to the port of Cartagena de Indias, where he plans to set sail for Europe. As Palencia-Roth notes, &quot;Bolívar is cast here not only as a victim but as an agent of Latin America&#x27;s tragic political flaws&quot;. The fortunes of the historical Simón Bolívar began to decline in 1824 after the victory of his general Antonio José de Sucre at Ayacucho. The novel draws on the fact that the historical Bolívar never remarried after the death of his wife, María Teresa Rodríguez del Toro y Alayza. García Márquez uses other documented facts as starting points for his fictional portrait of Bolívar–for example, his dedication to the army above all else, his premature aging, and his bad temper. Of the latter, Bolívar&#x27;s aide-de-camp O&#x27;Leary once remarked that &quot;his imperious and impatient temperament would never tolerate the smallest delay in the execution of an order&quot;.

In an interview with María Elvira Samper, García Márquez has admitted that his portrayal of Bolívar is partly a self-portrait. He identifies with Bolívar in many ways, since their method of controlling their anger is the same and their philosophical views are similar: neither &quot;pays much attention to death, because that distracts one from the most important thing: what one does in life&quot;.

===José Palacios===
The novel begins with the name of José Palacios, who, here as with the historical figure of the same name, is Bolívar&#x27;s &quot;long-serving mayordomo&quot;. As literary critic Seymour Menton observes, Palacios&#x27;s &quot;total identification with Bolívar constitutes the novel&#x27;s frame&quot;. Palacios constantly waits on the General, and at certain times he alone is allowed in the General&#x27;s room. He has learned to live with his master&#x27;s unpredictability and does not presume to read his thoughts. Simultaneously, however, Palacios is also the General&#x27;s closest confidante, the person best able to read his moods and share in his emotions. Born a slave, the character is six years younger than the General, and has spent his entire life in his service. Throughout the novel, Palacios provides the General with clarifications or reminders of dates and events during the General&#x27;s time of disillusion. According to one critic, Palacios&#x27;s ability to recall past events in Bolívar&#x27;s life is essential for García Márquez&#x27;s recreation of the character, as it allows the Bolívar of official history to be placed within the context of everyday life.

===Manuela Sáenz===
Manuela Sáenz is the General&#x27;s long-time lover, his last since the death of his wife, 27 years earlier. Her character is based on Simón Bolívar&#x27;s historical mistress Doña Manuela Sáenz de Thorne, whom Bolívar dubbed &quot;the liberator of the liberator&quot; after she helped save him from an assassination attempt on the night of September 25, 1828. García Márquez&#x27;s fictional portrait stimulated a reassessment of this historical figure, who is increasingly seen, according to Venezuelan historian Denzil Romero, &quot;not just as a mistress but as the intelligent, independent, forceful woman she was&quot;. In the novel, she is described as &quot;the bold Quiteña who loved him but was not going to follow him to his death&quot;. The General leaves Manuela Sáenz behind, but throughout the novel he writes to her on his journey. She also attempts to write letters to him with news of the political situation, but the mail carriers have been instructed not to accept her letters. Like the historical figure on whom she is based, the fictional Manuela Sáenz is married to Dr. James Thorne, an English physician twice her age. The historical Manuela Sáenz left Thorne after Bolívar wrote declaring his undying love for her. In the novel she is characterized as astute and indomitable, with &quot;irresistible grace, a sense of power, and unbounded tenacity&quot;.

===General Francisco de Paula Santander===
As he reflects on the past, the General often thinks and dreams about his former friend Francisco de Paula Santander. The historical Francisco de Paula Santander was a friend of Simón Bolívar, but was later accused of complicity in a plot to assassinate him and sent into exile. In the novel, the General remembers that he had once appointed Santander to govern Colombia because he believed him to be an effective and brave soldier. He formerly regarded Santander as &quot;[his] other self, and perhaps [his] better self&quot;, but by the time of the events in &quot;The General in His Labyrinth&quot; Santander has become the General&#x27;s enemy and has been banished to Paris after his involvement in the assassination attempt. The General is depicted as tormented by the idea that Santander will return from his exile in France; he dreams, for example, that Santander is eating the pages of a book, that he is covered in cockroaches, and that he is plucking out his own eyeballs.

===Field Marshal Antonio José de Sucre===
Field Marshal Antonio José de Sucre is portrayed as an intimate friend of the General. The historical Antonio José de Sucre, the Field Marshal of Ayacucho, had been the most trusted general of Simón Bolívar. García Márquez describes him as &quot;intelligent, methodical, shy, and superstitious&quot;. The Field Marshal is married to and has a daughter with Doña Mariana Carcelén. In the first chapter of the novel, the General asks Sucre to succeed him as President of the Republic, but he rejects the idea. One of the reasons Sucre gives is that he wishes only to live his life for his family. Also at the beginning of the novel, Sucre&#x27;s death is foreshadowed. Sucre tells the General that he plans on celebrating the Feast of Saint Anthony in Quito with his family. When the General hears that Sucre has been assassinated in Berruecos on his way back to Quito, he vomits blood.

===Minor characters===
The novel revolves around the fictionalized figure of Bolívar and includes many minor characters who are part of the General&#x27;s travelling party, whom he meets on his journey or who come to him in his memories and dreams of his past. Sometimes they are identified by particular quirks or tied to small but significant events. They include, for instance, General José María Carreño, a member of the entourage, whose right arm was amputated after a combat wound, and who once revealed a military secret by talking in his sleep. At other times, they are prostheses for the General&#x27;s now failing powers: Fernando, for example, the General&#x27;s nephew, is &quot;the most willing and patient of the General&#x27;s many clerks&quot;, and the General wakes him &quot;at any hour to have him read aloud from a dull book or take notes on urgent extemporizations&quot;. One of the least developed of the minor characters is the General&#x27;s wife, María Teresa Rodríguez del Toro y Alayza, who had died, readers are told, in mysterious circumstances shortly after their marriage. The General has &quot;buried her at the bottom of a water-tight oblivion as a brutal means of living without her&quot;; she only fleetingly enters his memories in the book&#x27;s last chapter. According to Menton, she is &quot;upstaged&quot; by Manuela Sáenz, whose later history García Márquez recounts as if she instead were the General&#x27;s widow. María Teresa&#x27;s death, however, marked the General&#x27;s &quot;birth into history&quot;, and he has never tried to replace her.

== Major themes ==

=== Politics ===
In &quot;The General in His Labyrinth&quot;, García Márquez voices his political views through the character of the General. For example, Alvarez Borland points out that in the scene where the General responds to the French diplomat, his words closely reflect García Márquez&#x27;s 1982 Nobel Address. The diplomat is critical of the barbarism in Latin America and the brutal means used in attempting to achieve independence. Bolívar replies by pointing out that Europe had centuries to progress to its current state, and that South America should be left to experience its &quot;Middle Ages in peace&quot;. Similarly García Márquez remarks in his Nobel Speech that &quot;venerable Europe would perhaps be more perceptive if it tried to see [Latin America] in its own past. If only it recalled that London took three hundred years to build its first city wall ...&quot;.

The novel was published in 1989, when the Soviet Union was disintegrating and the political map was being radically redrawn. Reviewing &quot;The General in His Labyrinth&quot; in 1990, the novelist Margaret Atwood pointed to another instance of García Márquez raising political issues through the character of the General. He has him tell his aide that the United States is &quot;omnipotent and terrible, and that its tale of liberty will end in a plague of miseries for us all&quot;.
Atwood noted the contemporary relevance of this sentiment, since &quot;the patterns of Latin American politics, and of United States intervention in them, have not changed much in 160 years.&quot; She suggested that García Márquez&#x27;s fictionalization of Bolívar is a lesson &quot;for our own turbulent age ... Revolutions have a long history of eating their progenitors.&quot; The central character is a man at the end of his life, who has seen his revolution and dream of a united Latin America fail.

=== Figural labyrinth ===
According to literary critic David Danow, the labyrinth of the novel&#x27;s title refers to &quot;a series of labyrinths that are contingent upon matters of history, geography, and biography ... that consistently and conclusively result in a dead end&quot;—in this case, the General&#x27;s own death. His final voyage along the Magdalena River involves a doubling back and forth from one location to another that leads him and his followers nowhere. The labyrinth does not lead to happiness; instead, it results in madness from constant pondering on the past and an impossible future. At the end of his life, the General is reduced to a spectre of his former self. The labyrinth also recalls the labyrinth built to imprison the minotaur in Greek mythology, and the endless travelling and searching of ancient Greek heroes. In Danow&#x27;s view, &quot;The Labyrinth mirrors the wanderings and travails of the hero in search for meaning and resolution to the vicissitudes of life&quot;.

García Márquez depicts the General&#x27;s body itself as a labyrinth. His doctor observes that &quot;everything that enters the body, adds weight, and everything that leaves it is debased.&quot; The General&#x27;s body is described as a &quot;labyrinth coming to a literal dead end&quot;. The labyrinth is also expressed in geographical and architectural imagery. The country&#x27;s destiny is imagined as a break-up, a folding of north into south. The seas offer the hope of a new life and a new world, but the closer the General is to Colombia, the less chance he has of moving on. García Márquez describes buildings as &quot;daunting, reverberating (if not exactly reiterating) with the echoes of a bloody past&quot;. The portrayal of the General&#x27;s world as a labyrinth is underlined by his constant return to cities and towns he has visited before: each location belongs to the past as well as to the present. &quot;The General in his Labyrinth&quot; blurs the lines between perdition in a man-made world and wandering in the natural world.

===Fate and love===
Bolívar&#x27;s fate is known from the beginning, and García Márquez constantly uses images which foreshadow this ending. For instance, a clock stuck at seven minutes past one, the exact time of the General&#x27;s death, appears repeatedly in the novel. This sense of fate is introduced in the epigraph, which comes from a letter written by the historical Bolívar to General Santander on August 4, 1823: &quot;It seems that the devil controls the business of my life.&quot; As Palencia-Roth points out, the word used for devil here is rather than the more familiar . derives from the Greek word , which can equally mean divine power, fate, or destiny. Accordingly, the General succumbs to his fate and accepts his death as destiny.

The theme of love is central to the novel. Bolívar had a reputation as a womanizer, and books have been written on his philandering; but as depicted in this novel, during the last seven months of his life, the General could no longer engage in the activities that had fueled that reputation. García Márquez mentions a woman every few pages, many of whom are his own invention, exploring love through the General&#x27;s memories. Palencia-Roth notes that the presence of these women &quot;allows a labyrinthine exploration of his life before his final journey&quot; and suggests that García Márquez uses love as a barometer of the General&#x27;s heart and health. Although Bolívar is usually thought to have died from tuberculosis, Palencia-Roth believes that for the author, the General dies from the lack of love. &quot;Despised by many of his countrymen, abandoned by all but a few aides and associates, left—during the final seven months of his life—without even the companionship of his longtime mistress Manuela Saenz, Bolívar had no choice but to die of a broken heart.&quot;

===Numbers and religious symbols===
Numbers are an important symbolic aspect of the novel. The book is divided into eight chapters, almost all of equal length, which represent the eight-year love affair between the General and Manuela Sáenz. The General&#x27;s last hours are marked by an octagonal clock. Allusions to the number three are even more common in the novel. As García Márquez scholar Isabel Rodríguez Vergara notes, the number three—the Trinity which occupies a vital place in the symbology of the Catholic Mass—is repeated 21 times throughout the book. She quotes Mircea Eliade: &quot;In the novel it represents a symbolic sacrifice aimed at redeeming humankind—that of Bolívar, a misunderstood redeemer sacrificed by his own people.&quot;

Rodríguez Vergara observes that the General is like a supernatural being, simultaneously dying and being surrounded by symbolic circumstances such as rain, fiestas, and the plague. The novel begins with Bolívar immersed in purifying waters, in a state of ecstasy and meditation that suggests a priestly ritual. One of the women with whom the General sleeps, Queen Marie Louise, is described as a virgin with the profile of an idol—an allusion to the Virgin Mary. The General rides a mule into the last towns on his journey towards death, echoing Christ&#x27;s entry into Jerusalem. He dies of mysterious and unknown causes, and the people burn his belongings in fear of catching his illness. In Rodríguez Vergara&#x27;s view, &quot;Bolívar was sacrificed as a scapegoat to purge the guilt of the community.&quot;

René Girard has interpreted the recurrence of rain in the novel as one of the purifying rituals the community must undergo in order to wash away the contagion of violence. The fiestas may represent another ritual of purification and also symbolize war. Fiestas are held to honour the General when he arrives at a town, but at other times, political demonstrations against the General are mistaken for a fiesta. According to Rodríguez Vergara, this shows how &quot;information is manipulated&quot; and &quot;depicts an atmosphere where fiesta and war are synonymous&quot;.

===Melancholy and mourning===
Latin American cultural theorist Carlos J. Alonso, drawing on Freudian theory, argues that the novel is essentially a therapeutic device, designed to help move Latin America past its problematic experience of modernity. He compares this to the way the healing state of mourning replaces grief in the process of recovering from a death. Both activities are mechanisms for dealing with loss. Alonso believes that &quot;The General in his Labyrinth&quot;, by almost entirely centering the novel on the General&#x27;s death, forces the reader to confront the horror of this process. In Alonso&#x27;s view, the reader is meant to pass from &quot;a melancholy relationship vis-a-vis the figure of Bolívar to a relationship that has the therapeutic qualities of mourning instead&quot;.

Latin America&#x27;s history and culture, Alonso suggests, began with the loss of Bolívar&#x27;s dream of a united continent and as a result has developed under a melancholy shadow ever since. Thus, by forcing the reader to return to the origin of modernity in Latin America and confront its death in the most horrific way, García Márquez compels the reader to move from melancholy to mourning, &quot;so that the phantom of the lost object of modernity may cease to rule the libidinal economy of Spanish American cultural discourse and historical life&quot;.

===Challenging history===
García Márquez comments on the nature of historical fact by drawing attention to the way history is written. The novel recreates a time in Bolívar&#x27;s life that has no historical precedent, as there is no record of the last 14 days of his life. In García Márquez&#x27;s account readers observe Bolívar intimately, seeing his human qualities. In the view of critic Isabel Alvarez Borland, by choosing to fictionalize a national hero in this way, García Márquez is challenging the claim of official history to represent the truth. In the &quot;My Thanks&quot; section of the novel, García Márquez asserts ironically that what he is writing is more historical than fictional, and he discusses his own historical methodology in detail. By posing in the role of a historian, he challenges the reliability of written history from within the writing process. According to Alvarez Borland, this serves to &quot;remind us that a claim to truth is not the property of any text; rather it is the result of how a historian (as a reader) interprets the facts&quot;.

&quot;The General in His Labyrinth&quot; also confronts the methods of official historians by using an oral style of narration. The narration can be considered an oral account in that it is woven from the verbal interactions of everyday people. Alvarez Borland explains that the advantage of this technique, as discussed by Walter Ong, is that &quot;the orality of any given culture, residing in the unwritten tales of its peoples, possesses a spontaneity and liveliness which is lost once this culture commits its tales to writing.&quot; The oral style of narration therefore provides a truthfulness which official history lacks. Alvarez Borland concludes that &quot;The General in His Labyrinth&quot; suggests new ways of writing the past; it takes account of voices that were never written down as part of official history.

The historian Ben Hughes commented on the novel: &quot;The Liberator&#x27;s British confidants, including Daniel O&#x27;Leary, were amongst the closest figures to the general in this period. Nevertheless, they are ignored in the novel. Instead, Márquez uses the character of a fictional Colombian servant, José Palacios, as The Liberator&#x27;s final sounding board, thereby neatly sidestepping the more complex reality.&quot; In Hughes&#x27;s view, modern South American literature has played a role in cleansing the national memory of British soldiers&#x27; assistance to The Liberator.

==Comparisons with other García Márquez novels==
In an interview published in the Colombian weekly on March 20, 1989, García Márquez told María Elvira Samper, &quot;At bottom, I have written only one book, the same one that circles round and round, and continues on.&quot; Palencia-Roth suggests that this novel is a &quot;labyrinthine summation ... of García Márquez&#x27;s long-standing obsessions and ever-present topics: love, death, solitude, power, fate&quot;.

Like the Patriarch in García Márquez&#x27;s &quot;The Autumn of the Patriarch&quot;, Bolívar was an absolute dictator. The Patriarch is never identified by name; Bolívar, too, is identified chiefly by his title. Bolívar also invites comparison with Colonel Aureliano Buendía in &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot;: both characters believe the wars they have waged have been fruitless and overwhelming, and both face numerous attempts on their lives, but eventually die of natural causes. In his belief that life is controlled by fate, the General resembles Buendía in &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot; and Santiago Nasar in &quot;Chronicle of a Death Foretold&quot;.

Palencia-Roth notes that critics have been struck by the humorless elegiac style of &quot;The General in His Labyrinth&quot;; its dark mood and somber message is similar to that of &quot;The Autumn of the Patriarch&quot;. Love is a theme common to both &quot;Love in the Time of Cholera&quot; and &quot;The General in His Labyrinth&quot;, but the latter is considered a tragedy. These two novels have been used to demonstrate the range of García Márquez&#x27;s work.

Isabel Alvarez Borland, in her essay &quot;The Task of the Historian in &quot;, claims that &quot; ... while is in many ways a continuation of García Márquez&#x27;s criticism of Latin America&#x27;s official history seen in his earlier works, the novel contrasts sharply with his previous fictions&quot;. In &quot;Chronicle of a Death Foretold&quot;, according to Alvarez Borland, the narrator challenges the truth of official language. However, &quot;The General in His Labyrinth&quot; &quot;differs from these [earlier works] in employing narrative strategies which seek to answer in a much more overt and didactic fashion questions that the novel poses about history&quot;.

In a summary of Edward Hood&#x27;s book , García Márquez is characterized as an author who uses repetition and (intertextuality between the works of a single author) extensively in his fiction, including in &quot;The General in His Labyrinth&quot;. Hood points out some obvious examples of repetition in García Márquez&#x27;s works: the themes of solitude in &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot;, tyranny in &quot;Autumn of the Patriarch&quot;, and the desire for a unified continent expressed by Bolívar in &quot;The General in His Labyrinth&quot;. An example of intertextuality can be seen in the repetition of patterns between books. For example, both Jose Arcadio Buendia in &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot; and Bolívar in &quot;The General in his Labyrinth&quot; experience labyrinthian dreams.

==Genre==
Critics consider García Márquez&#x27;s book in terms of the historical novel, but differ over whether the label is appropriate. In his review of &quot;The General in his Labyrinth&quot;, Selden Rodman hesitated to call it a novel, since it was so heavily researched, giving Bolívar&#x27;s views &quot;on everything from life and love to his chronic constipation and dislike of tobacco smoke&quot;. On the other hand, reviewer Robert Adams suggested that García Márquez had &quot;improved on history&quot;. According to critic Donald L. Shaw, &quot;The General in His Labyrinth&quot; is a &quot;New Historical Novel&quot;, a genre that he argues crosses between Boom, Post-Boom, and Postmodernist fiction in Latin American literature: &quot;New Historical Novels tend either to retell historical events from an unconventional perspective, but one which preserves their intelligibility, or to question the very possibility of making sense of the past at all.&quot; Shaw believes that this novel belongs to the first category. García Márquez is presenting both a historical account and his own interpretation of events.

David Bushnell, writing in &quot;The Hispanic American Historical Review&quot;, points out that the work is less a pure historical account than others suggest. García Márquez&#x27;s Bolívar is a man &quot;who wanders naked through the house, suffers constipation, uses foul language, and much more besides.&quot; He argues that documentation does not support many of these details. Bushnell suggests, however, that the fact that the novel is not entirely historically accurate does not necessarily distinguish it from the work of professional historians. The main difference, Bushnell believes, is that García Márquez&#x27;s work &quot;is far more readable&quot; than a pure history.

== Reception ==
&quot;The General in His Labyrinth&quot; was relatively poorly received by the general public in the United States, despite the praise of critics. Critic Ilan Stavans, who himself praised the book as &quot;one of the writer&#x27;s most sophisticated and accomplished&quot;, attributes this to the novel&#x27;s time period and to its profusion of historical information, neither of which proved attractive to English-speaking readers. Isabel Alvarez Borland notes that, like Stavans, &quot;critics in the United States have largely celebrated García Márquez&#x27;s portrait of this national hero and considered it a tour de force&quot;; but she also observes that in Latin America the book received more mixed reviews, ranging from &quot;outrage to unqualified praise&quot;.

The novel generated huge controversy in Latin America: some Venezuelan and Colombian politicians described its depiction of Bolívar as &quot;profane&quot;. According to Stavans, they accused García Márquez of &quot;defaming the larger-than-life reputation of a historical figure who, during the nineteenth century, struggled to unite the vast Hispanic world&quot;. The novel&#x27;s publication provoked outrage from many Latin American politicians and intellectuals because its portrayal of the General is not the saintly image long cherished by many. Mexico&#x27;s ambassador to Austria, Francisco Cuevas Cancino, wrote a damning letter, which was widely publicized in Mexico City, objecting to the portrayal of Bolívar. He stated: &quot;The novel is plagued with errors of fact, conception, fairness, understanding of the [historical] moment and ignorance of its consequences ... It has served the enemies of [Latin] America, who care only that they can now denigrate Bolívar, and with him all of us.&quot; Even the novel&#x27;s admirers, such as the leading Venezuelan diplomat and writer Arturo Uslar Pietri, worried that some facts were stretched. García Márquez believes, however, that Latin America has to discover the General&#x27;s labyrinth to recognize and deal with its own maze of problems.

More positively, Nelson Bocaranda, a Venezuelan TV commentator, considers the novel to be a tonic for Latin American culture: &quot;people here saw a Bolívar who is a man of flesh and bones just like themselves&quot;. Mexican author Carlos Fuentes agrees with Bocaranda saying: &quot;What comes across beautifully and poignantly in this book is a man dealing with the unknown [world of democratic ideas]&quot;. García Márquez realistically portrays a ridiculous figure trapped in a labyrinth, magnifying the General&#x27;s defects, and presenting an image of Bolívar contrary to that instilled in classrooms. However, the novel also depicts Bolívar as an idealist and political theorist who predicted many problems that would obstruct Latin American advancement in the future. García Márquez depicts a figure who was aware of the racial and social friction in Latin American society, feared debt, and warned against economic irresponsibility. He has the General warn his aide-de-camp, Agustín de Iturbide, against the future interference of the United States in the internal affairs of Latin America.

Novelist and critic Bárbara Mujica comments that the book&#x27;s English translator, Edith Grossman, fully captures the multiple levels of meaning of the text, as well as García Márquez&#x27;s modulations in tone. García Márquez himself has admitted that he prefers his novels in their English translations.

==Publication history==
The original Spanish version of &quot;The General in His Labyrinth&quot; was published simultaneously in Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, and Spain in 1989. The first American edition was listed as a best seller in &quot;The New York Times&quot; the following year.

The novel has been translated into many languages since its first publication in Spanish, as detailed by Sfeir de González in 2003.

<doc id="1162325" wikidata="Q2630193" url="?curid=1162325" title="Planetary romance">
<text>Planetary romance (other synonyms are sword and planet, and planetary adventure) is a subgenre of science fiction or science fantasy in which the bulk of the action consists of adventures on one or more exotic alien planets, characterized by distinctive physical and cultural backgrounds. Some planetary romances take place against the background of a future culture where travel between worlds by spaceship is commonplace; others, particularly the earliest examples of the genre, do not, invoking flying carpets, astral projection, or other methods of getting between planets. In either case, it is the planetside adventures that are the focus of the story, not the mode of travel.

A significant precursor of the genre is Edwin L. Arnold&#x27;s &quot;Lieut. Gullivar Jones: His Vacation&quot; (1905).

In &quot;Science Fiction: The 100 Best Novels&quot; (1985), editor and critic David Pringle named Marion Zimmer Bradley and Anne McCaffrey as two &quot;leading practitioners nowadays&quot; for the planetary romance type of science fiction.

==Comparison with other subgenres==
&quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; mentions two caveats as to the usage of the term. First, while the setting may be in an alien world, if &quot;the nature or description of this world has little bearing on the story being told,&quot; as in &quot;A Case of Conscience&quot;, then the book is not a planetary romance. Second, hard science fiction tales are excluded from this category, where an alien planet, while being a critical component of the plot, is just a background for a primarily scientific endeavor, such as Hal Clement&#x27;s &quot;Mission of Gravity&quot;, possibly with embellishments. Allen Steele writes that while the label &quot;space opera&quot; has been posted on any story away from Earth, it stands apart from &quot;planetary romance&quot;, which he describes as a &quot;close cousin&quot; of &quot;space opera&quot;.

<doc id="1162326" wikidata="Q4721520" url="?curid=1162326" title="Alexis Rockman">
<text>Alexis Rockman (born 1962) is an American contemporary artist known for his paintings that provide depictions of future landscapes as they might exist with impacts of climate change and evolution influenced by genetic engineering. He has exhibited his work in the United States since 1985, including a 2004 exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum, and internationally since 1989. He lives with his wife, Dorothy Spears in Warren, CT and NYC.

==Life==
Rockman was born and raised in New York City. Rockman&#x27;s stepfather, Russell Rockman, an Australian jazz musician, brought the family to Australia frequently. As a child, Rockman frequented the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, where his mother, Diana Wall, worked briefly for anthropologist Margaret Mead.

Growing up, Rockman had an interest in natural history and science, and developed fascination for film, animation, and the arts. From 1980 to 1982, Rockman studied animation at the Rhode Island School of Design, and continued studies at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan, receiving a BFA in fine arts in 1985.

Aside from his art career, Rockman has taken on requests from conservation groups, including the Riverkeeper project and the Rainforest Alliance. He lives with his wife, Dorothy Spears in Warren, CT and NYC.

==Career==

===Early career 1985–1993===
Rockman began exhibiting his work at the Jay Gorney Modern Art gallery in New York City in 1986 and was represented by the gallery from 1986 to 2005. Rockman also had exhibitions at galleries in Los Angeles, Boston, and Philadelphia in the late 1980s.

Early work was inspired by natural history iconography. In &quot;Phylum&quot;, Rockman draws upon the work of Ernst Haeckel, an artist and proponent of Darwinism. A series of works by Rockman in the early 1990s, including &quot;Barnyard Scene&quot; (1990), &quot;Jungle Fever&quot; (1991), and &quot;The Trough&quot; (1992), use dark humor in depicting different species mating with one another. In &quot;Barnyard Scene&quot;, Rockman depicts a raccoon mating with a rooster, and &quot;Jungle Fever&quot; shows a praying mantis mating with a chipmunk. In 1993, Rockman created &quot;Still Life&quot;, a still life depiction of a pile of fish and marine specimens, evoking reference to 1935 horror James Whale film &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot; and films by Luis Buñuel. In &quot;Still Life&quot;, Rockman alludes to the &quot;Wunderkammer&quot;, placing &quot;aberrant contents&quot; amidst a Baroque still life scene, which traditionally is abundant with wealth and goods from Dutch and Spanish colonies.

In 1992, Rockman painted his first large scale painting, &quot;Evolution,&quot; which was exhibited at Sperone Westwater Gallery in 1992, the Carnegie Museum of Art and the Venice Biennale in 1993.

The &quot;Biosphere&quot; series, referencing Douglass Trumbull&#x27;s seminal 1971 film &quot;Silent Running&quot;&#x27;, envisions a situation where the Earth has become too toxic for human life, and the last vestiges of nature are placed in geodesic domes on space ships roaming the outer reaches of our solar system. &quot;Biosphere&quot; also references the quasi-scientific experiment &quot;Biosphere 2&quot; in Arizona&quot;.&quot; 

=== Second Nature ===
Illinois State University, University Galleries, Normal Illinois, August 17- September 29, 1995.

Curated by Barry Blinderman, this is the first museum survey of Rockman&#x27;s paintings featuring thirty works ( 18 large scale paintings and 12 smaller works) from 1986 to 1994, with catalog essays by Barry Blinderman, Douglas Blau, Stephen Jay Gould, Prudence Roberts, and Peter Ward. The exhibition traveled to the Portland Art Museum (June 5 - July 23, 1995), Cincinnati Art Museum(Oct. 22 - Dec. 31, 1995), the Tweed Museum of Art (Feb. 6 - March 17, 1996) and The Cranbrook Art Museum (September 20 - October 27, 1996).

===Travels===
Many of Alexis Rockman&#x27;s works have been inspired by his travels around the world, including to Costa Rica, Brazil, Madagascar, Guyana, Tasmania, the Galapagos and Antarctica. Rockman traveled to Guyana in 1994 with fellow artist Mark Dion, resulting in numerous paintings of the flora and fauna that he observed. For the 1994 trip, he strictly painted works that depicted what he saw, with particular interest in various types of insects. &quot;Neblina&quot; (1995), one of the last works resulting from the Guyana trip, was painted after the collapse of a tailings dam at the Omni gold mine in Guyana, resulting in cyanide leaking into the waterway. &quot;Neblina&quot; shows wildlife huddled together high in tree branches. Rockman returned to Guyana in 1998, and his works from that trip focused on aspects of ecotourism. Rockman traveled to Antarctica in 2008 with Dorothy Spears, and works resulting from this voyage were featured in the &quot;Badlands: New Horizons in Landscape&quot; exhibit at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art.

=== Dioramas 1996-97 ===
&quot;Dioramas&quot; involved a pointed move away from painting: each of the nine works in the exhibition combines paint with collage elements, including photographs, readymade and found objects ( dead animals, etc.), each encases in a block of transparent Envirotex resin between three and a quarter and five inches thick.

===The Farm, Wonderful World and Future Evolution 1999–2004===

Rockman&#x27;s painting &quot;The Farm&quot; was commissioned by Creative Time and exhibited at the Exit Art Gallery in New York City in 2000, as part of the &quot;Paradise Now: Picturing Genetic Revolution&quot; exhibition. The work depicts domestic and agricultural animals and plants, and how they may appear in the future, as a result of genetic engineering. The work examines how our culture perceives and interacts with plants and animals and the role culture plays in impacting the direction of natural history. In his painting, &quot;The Farm&quot;, rows of soybean plants extend toward the horizon. &quot;The way I constructed it is that, as in a lot of Western cultures, we read things from left to right.&quot;. &quot;On the left side of the image are the ancestral species of the chicken, the pig, the cow, and the mouse&quot;; on the right, their contemporary versions. Farther to the right are &quot;permutations of what things might look like in the future.&quot; The choice of a soybean field as his subject is fitting since soybeans are the most common, genetically modified crop. A pig becomes obese with images of a heart, lungs, and liver imposed on its side. A tiny hairless mouse scavenges while a human ear grows out of its back. A rooster sits upon a fence pole, its six wings pressed against its side. For this work, Rockman consulted with molecular biologist Rob DeSalle at the American Museum of Natural History. &quot;The Farm&quot; lead to a residency and a body of work of four other 8x10&#x27; paintings called &quot;Wonderful World&quot;, which was shown at the Camden Art Center in London in 2004.

In Rockman&#x27;s wonderful world series he describes a possible future of the Pet Store, Sea World, Hot House and Soccer.

Rockman&#x27;s interest in science lead to a book collaboration with paleontologist and author Peter Douglass Ward &quot;Future Evolution&quot;, in 2001. Rockman and Ward co-authored the project, with Ward writing the text and Rockman creating the images. Rockman and Ward portray the future as abundant with plants and animals, that are descendants of weedy species or feral domestics.

In 2004, the Monacelli Press publishes an exhaustive monograph with essays by Stephen Jay Gould, Jonathan Crary, David Quammen, and an interview with Dorothy Spears.

=== &quot;Manifest Destiny&quot; 2004 ===
In 2004, the Brooklyn Museum featured &quot;Manifest Destiny&quot;, an 8-by-24-foot oil-on-wood painting by Rockman as a centerpiece for the second-floor Mezzanine Gallery and marking the opening of the renovated Grand Lobby and plaza at the museum. &quot;Manifest Destiny&quot; imagines the Brooklyn waterfront several hundred years in the future, after climate change has caused catastrophic sea level rise. Rockman sketched out initial ideas for the painting in January 2000, and Brooklyn Museum director Arnold L. Lehman officially requested the painting in 2002. Rockman began work on the mural in March 2003, consulting with experts in various fields, including Peter Ward, James Hansen and Cynthia Rosenzweig and scientists at Columbia University&#x27;s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, as well as architects Diane Lewis and Chris Morris. Rockman shows the outcome several hundred years in the future, depicting both tropical migrants and invasive plants and animals amidst the ruins of the Brooklyn Bridge, the wrecks of a Dutch sailing ship and a 20th-century submarine, a myriad of failed sea walls and other infrastructure designed to mitigate the rising waters. Rockman&#x27;s project suggests what the remote geological, botanical, and zoological future might bring, predicting the ecosystem of the area. This painting was exhibited at the Brooklyn Museum (April 17–September 12, 2004), at Grand Arts in Kansas City (14 January – 26 February 2005), at the Addison Gallery of American Art in Andover, MA (12 March – 5 June 2005) at the RISD Museum in Providence, RI(June 17 - September 18, 2005) and was reproduced at scale at the Wexner Center for the Arts ( October 2005 - February 2006). It is now in the collection of the Smithsonian American Art Museum.

=== American Icons (2005-2006) ===
In this series, Rockman imagines some of America&#x27;s most famous landmarks and monuments as ruins overtaken by the implications of climate change- sea level rise, ravaged by sand and dust storms and invasive plants and animals.

===Baroque Biology 2007===
Cincinnati&#x27;s Contemporary Arts Center hosted a two-person show with works by Rockman and Tony Matelli in the 2007 exhibition, &quot;Baroque Biology&quot;. In &quot;Romantic Attachments&quot;, Rockman portrays, a male &quot;Homo georgicus&quot; together with a female human in a romantic encounter. The &quot;Homo georgicus&quot; dates from 1.8 million years ago, intermediate in the evolutionary timeline between &quot;Homo habilis&quot; and &quot;H. erectus&quot;. I Rockman references Gian Lorenzo Bernini&#x27;s sculpture &quot;Ecstasy of Saint Theresa&quot;, depicting the torch-bearing male &quot;Homo georgicus&quot; in place of Bernini&#x27;s spear-bearing androgynous angel hovering over a female, who in both Bernini&#x27;s and Rockman&#x27;s work is portrayed erotically. Sculptor and paleoartist Viktor Deak created two reference models for Rockman of a male &quot;Homo georgicus&quot;.

===Smithsonian American Art Museum exhibition===
In November 2010, the Smithsonian American Art Museum mounted a survey &quot;Alexis Rockman: A Fable for Tomorrow&quot;, from November 2010 to May 8, 2011, which traveled to Wexner Center for the Arts in Columbus, OH (September 29 - December 30, 2011). The exhibition, presented 47 paintings by Rockman. The title of the exhibition refers to the title of the first chapter of Rachel Carson&#x27;s book &quot;Silent Spring&quot;.

=== Rubicon (2012-2014) ===
A series of oil paintings and watercolors depicting an apocalyptic, post- human New York City, Rockman shows that human disasters, though often tragic, occasionally offer opportunities for other creatures. Imagining a post human cityscape where the dark past, present and future ecologies collapse, the Bronx Zoo, the New York City sewer system, Newtown Creek and the Gowanus Canal reveal their cryptic secrets.

===Life of Pi===
in 2005, Ang Lee asked Rockman to be an &quot;Inspirational Artist&quot; in his adaptation of Life of Pi.(2012) Over the course of three years, he completed several dozen watercolor concept paintings and developed, with associate producer Jean Castelli, the &quot;Tiger Vision&quot; sequence. Rockman&#x27;s watercolors for the Life of Pi &quot;served as the backbone for much of the film’s aesthetic.&quot; 

=== Battle Royale 2011 ===
&quot;Battle Royale&quot; was executed for the international show &quot;Prospect 2&quot; and conceived specifically for the city of New Orleans. The painting depicts fifty-four native and invasive species fighting for dominance in a Louisiana swamp. Non-native plants and animals are placing increasing stress on the state&#x27;s ecosystems, and the warfare Rockman depicts is quietly taking place all over the state. It is in the permanent collection of the New Orleans Museum of Art.

=== Works on Paper: Watercolors and Weather Drawings ===
From his earliest watercolors in the 1980s, often of hybrid and mutated animals, the ominously beautiful and apocalyptic oil on paper &quot;Weather Drawings&quot;, painterly works on paper relating to his epic &quot;The Great Lakes Cycle&quot;, Rockman&#x27;s works on paper have been ongoing. The artist&#x27;s graphic work is as critical to the understanding of a visionary oeuvre made at the intersection of art, nature and science as his paintings.

=== Field Drawings ===
Rockman&#x27;s Field Drawings, which first started in Guyana in 1994, have led him around the world from New Mexico, Tasmania, La Brea Tar Pits, Madagascar, Central Park, Antarctica and The Great Lakes. These drawings are not created on site, but are &quot;of&quot; the site. Over the years, Rockman has collected samples of organic material, sand, leaves, soil as well as less predictable material such as wombat fecal matter or sperm whale spermaceti.  Selected species of flora and fauna relating directly to each site are depicted, some long extinct, some on the brink, while others have a bright future as invasive species.

=== Great Lakes Cycle ===
The Great Lakes Cycle is a series of  five monumental paintings and six large format watercolors and 28 Field Drawings investigating the past, present and future of these bodies of water. &quot;I wanted to do a sort of populist project about the Great Lakes and how precious they are. And how little we really consider them, in terms of what a valuable resource they have been and how incredibly valuable they will be in the future&quot; Each 6 x 12 foot painting is read from left to right, chronicling geologic time from the past to the present, continuing to visions of the near future. That future might be challenging as the Great Lakes have long been affected by human activity,  and the impact of cities, fishing, industry, farming and invasive species is likely to increase. Rockman traveled extensively around the Great Lakes region doing research, collecting source imagery, and learning about important issues affecting the lakes on the ground. The series, curated by Dana Friis Hansen, director of the Grand Rapids Art Museum, has traveled from The Grand Rapids Art museum (January 27 – April 29, 2018), to the Chicago Cultural Center (June 2—October 1, 2018),  the Museum of Contemporary Art, Cleveland (October 19, 2018 — January 27, 2019), The Haggerty Museum of Art at Marquette University, Milwaukee (February 8 to May 19, 2019), the Weisman Art Museum at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis (October 11, 2019 - January 5, 2020) and the Flint Institute of Arts ( June 11 - September 27, 2020). Each painting explores one aspect of the lakes’ history and ecology from the ice age, some 15,000 years ago, to the near future.

===Film and animation===
Rockman is fascinated by film and animation, and has admiration for the work of various film designers. Rockman admires the work of Syd Mead, fantasy art and science fiction illustrator Chesley Bonestell, and stop motion animators including Willis O&#x27;Brien, Ray Harryhausen, Brothers Quay, Jan Švankmajer and Phil Tippet ; and various Eastern European avant-garde filmmakers.

===Other influences===
Charles R. Knight has a special place in Rockman&#x27;s heart, as he almost single-handedly created the genre of reconstructions of extinct ecosystems. Rockman also drew inspiration from Chesley Bonestell&#x27;s 1950 &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; magazine illustration &quot;Atom Bombing of New York City&quot;, which depicts Manhattan amidst destruction and a glowing orange aura of an atomic bomb.

<text>The 1995 Saskatchewan general election was held on June 21, 1995 to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan.

The New Democratic Party government of Premier Roy Romanow was re-elected for a second term, although with a reduced majority.

The Liberal Party – led by Lynda Haverstock – increased its share of the popular vote; adding 9 seats in the legislature to the two seats it held previously, and became the official opposition.

Saskatchewan voters continued to punish the Progressive Conservative Party in the wake of prosecutions of former Progressive Conservative politicians for expense account fraud. Under the leadership of Bill Boyd the party continued to lose votes, and its caucus was reduced from 10 members to 5.

<text>The 1999 Saskatchewan general election was held on September 16, 1999 to elect members of the 24th Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan. The new Saskatchewan Party took more votes than any other party but the NDP took more seats, taking half the seats in the Saskatchewan Legislature. The NDP formed a coalition with four elected Liberal Party MLAs to hold majority government.

Polls during the campaign indicated strong levels of support for the New Democratic Party government. However, facing the fallout of a poor crop growing season and a scandal involving the Crown Corporation electric utility SaskPower (Channel Lake), the New Democrat government of Premier Roy Romanow – challenged by the newly created Saskatchewan Party – lost a significant share of the popular vote; winning exactly half of the fifty eight seats in the legislature.

The right-wing Saskatchewan Party was created during the sitting of the 23rd Assembly when much of the Progressive Conservative caucus joined forces with conservative Liberals who were unhappy with the leadership of Jim Melenchuk.

The new party was led by Elwin Hermanson, a former Reform Party federal Member of Parliament. In this election, it won 39.61% of the popular vote – slightly more than the NDP&#x27;s 38.73%. However, this was only enough for 25 seats, five short of making Hermanson premier. This was mainly because it was almost nonexistent in the province&#x27;s more urban areas; it was completely shut out in Regina and won only one seat in Saskatoon.

The NDP was able to continue to govern with the support of some Liberal Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs).

Some NDP members unhappy with the government of Roy Romanow left to form the New Green Alliance, an environmentalist party. This party won about 1% of the popular vote, and no seats in the legislature.

What remained of the Progressive Conservatives fielded 14 paper candidates – all in NDP strongholds – in order to preserve their status as a registered political party. The Tories did not actively campaign and won only a few votes.

To date, this is the most recent general election to return MLAs who were members of neither the NDP nor the Saskatchewan Party.

==Wood River controversy==
The Wood River electoral district in the wake of the 1999 general election endured a nine-month crisis where it went without representation. 
On election night returns came back in favour of Saskatchewan Party candidate Yogi Huyghebaert who defeated incumbent Glen McPherson by just seven votes in unofficial returns. The close election results were challenged in the courts.

After five months a judicial decision came down and the results were certified on January 27, 2000. Saskatchewan Liberal Party incumbent Glen McPherson was declared by a judge the winner by a single vote defeating Yogi Huyghebaert from the Saskatchewan Party. The Saskatchewan Party decided to challenge the judicial decision, and it was overturned and dissolved based on irregularities in the absentee ballots.

The seat was dissolved and a by-election was called by Premier Roy Romanow on May 29, 2000. McPherson did not run in the subsequent by-election, choosing to reject the NDP-Liberal coalition. His candidacy for the Liberal party was replaced by Gerry Ruehs. Huyghebaert ended up winning the by-election.

<text>The Social Credit Party of Saskatchewan, originally known as the Social Credit League of Saskatchewan, was a political party in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan that promoted social credit economic theories from the mid-1930s to the mid-1970s.

== History ==
Social Credit first appeared in Saskatchewan in the 1935 federal election, when the party received 20% of the popular vote and won two seats in Kindersley and The Battlefords. The party fought its first provincial campaign in the 1938 election. With Social Credit (Socreds) having taken power in neighbouring Alberta in 1935, the governing Liberals and opposition Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) both saw the Saskatchewan Socreds as a threat, and campaigned against the party, even characterizing Alberta Social Credit Premier William Aberhart as a &quot;despot intent on ruling the province from Edmonton&quot;. In Saskatchewan, the Socreds, nominally under the leadership of Social Credit Member of Parliament Joseph Needham—Needham served as president of the Saskatchewan Party into the 1940s—earned 15.9% of the popular vote, but only two candidates were elected to the Legislature. The Liberals remained in power with the CCF in Opposition—it is likely that the success of the CCF, which largely represented the agrarian movement in Saskatchewan, tempered the prospects for Social Credit in the province. In fact, in the subsequent election in 1944, Social Credit virtually disappeared, nominating only one candidate, who received only 249 votes, while the CCF won a large majority government.

The Saskatchewan Socreds, led by Joshua Haldeman, recovered somewhat in the 1948 provincial election, nominating 36 candidates and winning 8.1% of the popular vote, though no candidates were elected. The party surged in the 1956 provincial election, earning 21.5% of the popular vote and having three of its candidates elected.

The Social Credit vote fell to 12.4% in the 1960 election. Although the party nominated a few candidates in the two subsequent elections, it could not win more than 0.4% of the popular vote or win a seat. The party did not contest elections after 1967.

=== Failed merger ===
Ed Nasserden, leader of the Progressive Conservative Party, called for a merger with Social Credit in November 1970, and the two parties entered into talks. The move was mostly supported by the Progressive Conservatives, but some members of the Social Credit Party were, according to former leader Lloyd Avram, &quot;...skeptical of our ability to get our views of monetary reform across in a merged party.&quot;
Social Credit members ultimately voted against the merger in February 1971. Following the vote, Social Credit emerged as a divided party, and did not contest the 1971 and 1975 provincial elections. During that period, Social Credit was without a leader, and chose to focus on educating the people of Saskatchewan about the party&#x27;s beliefs and values. However, the party dissolved, never contesting another provincial election.

==Election results==
Social Credit contested every provincial election between 1938 and 1967, though the party ran only leader Joseph Needham in 1944. The party received the third highest vote share among parties on four occasions, achieving a high-water mark of 21.5% of the vote in 1956; however, only twice were any members elected to the Legislature—two in 1938, and three in 1956.

<text>Aberfeldy () is a burgh in Perth and Kinross, Scotland, on the River Tay. A small market town, Aberfeldy is located in Highland Perthshire. It was mentioned by Robert Burns in the poem &quot;The Birks of Aberfeldy&quot; and in the Ed Sheeran song &quot;The Hills of Aberfeldy&quot;.

== Etymology ==
Aberfeldy means &#x27;mouth of the Peallaidh&#x27;. The first element of the name is the Pictish word &quot;aber&quot; &#x27;river mouth&#x27;. The river-name perhaps incorporates the name of a water-sprite known as Peallaidh, which in Gaelic means &#x27;shaggy&#x27;. Aberfeldy is recorded in 1526 as &quot;Abrefrally&quot; and in 1552 as &quot;Abirfeldy&quot;.

==History==
Beyond its association with Burns, who mentioned Aberfeldy in his poem &quot;The Birks of Aberfeldy&quot;, the town is known for Wade&#x27;s Bridge, built in 1733 and designed by architect William Adam, father of Robert Adam. General George Wade considered this bridge to be his greatest accomplishment. Aberfeldy is also mentioned in the traditional &quot;Loch Tay Boat Song&quot;.

While working in the 1880s as a hired farmhand for Robert Menzies of Tirinie, near Aberfeldy, South Uist seanchaidh Angus MacLellan learned that a Mass stone had stood in the middle of Menzies&#x27;s farmfield since the days when Catholic Church in Scotland and its priests were outlawed. A nearby high cross, Menzies added, marked the site of an important college of learning from the days of the Celtic Church. Menzies explained that, even though the local population had long since switched to Presbyterianism, former Catholic religious sites were still viewed with superstitious awe and were never tampered with. Menzies further explained that the term for Mass stones, in the Perthshire dialect of the Scottish Gaelic language, was &quot;Clachan Ìobairt&quot;, meaning &quot;Offering Stones&quot;. John Lorne Campbell, to whom MacLellan dictated his memoirs, confirmed the latter&#x27;s memories by interviewing Robert Menzies&#x27; descendants in Aberfeldy. Following Catholic Emancipation in 1829, the Catholic population of Aberfeldy was served by priests visiting from Strathtay, who would offer the Tridentine Mass at the site now known as &quot;Tigh an Tuir&quot;, lit. &quot;the house of the death-dirge&quot;. Since it was first built as a tin tabernacle paid for by the Marquess of Bute in 1884, Our Lady of Mercy Catholic Church has stood at the same location and has been part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Dunkeld.

Between 1960 and 1991, the burgh was the location of a Royal Observer Corps monitoring bunker, to be used in the event of a nuclear attack. It remains mostly intact. 

The town includes a memorial to the Black Watch, an 9-hole golf course, a children&#x27;s park, and a town square (laid out in 1806) which features stores, restaurants and art galleries. In 2002, Aberfeldy was granted Fairtrade Town status, which was renewed by the Fairtrade Foundation on 15 December 2003.

The Aberfeldy Footbridge over the River Tay is constructed entirely of composite materials. It initially connected two sections of the town&#x27;s golf course on either side of the River Tay, but the course on the north side of the river has since been removed and the bridge is now used by pedestrians and cyclists to cross the river.

==Geography==


Aberfeldy is situated in Strath Tay on the upper reaches of the River Tay, which begins up-strath from Aberfeldy at Loch Tay and carries on south and east from Aberfeldy until it discharges at its estuary east of Perth at the Firth of Tay. Lying in an u-shaped strath common to Scotland&#x27;s glaciated landscape, the terrain in and around Aberfeldy is gently undulating. Farming and agriculture border the town in the strath. Areas further outside of Aberfeldy (particularly to the north and west) give way to the extensive Grampian Mountains, with scenic peaks such as Creag Odhar, Farragon Hill, Schiehallion, Ben Lawers and Sron Mhor punctuating the landscape.

Aberfeldy lies at the intersection of two A roads, the A826 to Crieff and the A827, which leads east and south towards the main A9 trunk road. Aberfeldy is easily reached from southern locations by taking the A9 to the Ballinluig exit, then the A827 to get to the town. Owing to its location off the A9 trunk road, Aberfeldy is less geared toward tourists than its cousin Pitlochry.

From July 1865 until May 1965, the town was served by a Highland Railway branch from Ballinluig. Although most of the trackbed leading into the town is still extant, the site of the station has vanished under modern housing developments.

The entrance to the Birks of Aberfeldy – a gorge and scenic walk – lies on the southern outskirts of Aberfeldy on the A826. The Birks is classified as a &quot;Site of Special Scientific Interest&quot; and contains many varieties of flora and fauna, some of which are protected.
Glen Lyon, regarded as one of Scotland&#x27;s most stunning and least-visited glens, lies about 8 kilometres from the outskirts of Aberfeldy. Evidence of fort construction by Roman legions more than 1,600 years ago is a testament to the region&#x27;s historical as well as geographical relevance. At the mouth of Glen Lyon lies the village of Fortingall, falsely claimed to be the birthplace of Pontius Pilate and home to the Fortingall Yew Tree, reputed to be more than 5,000 years old (though recent research suggests its age to be closer to 2,500).

==Education, culture and the arts==
The town is home to Breadalbane Academy. Based in Aberfeldy since the nineteenth century, Breadalbane Academy is an all-through, mixed English and Gaelic-medium school catering to children from the ages of three to eighteen years. The nursery and primary departments serve pupils from Aberfeldy and its immediate surroundings. The secondary department is the main secondary school for the whole of Highland Perthshire. It is the primary centre for Gaelic-medium education in Highland Perthshire for children from Glenlyon, Grandtully, Kenmore, Kinloch Rannoch and Dunkeld all receive their secondary education in Aberfeldy. In fifth and sixth, pupils from the Pitlochry catchment area also attend Breadalbane Academy to study for their Highers and Advanced Highers.

Fully rebuilt in the early years of the twenty-first century, the school re-opened in December 2010 as a community campus. As well as nursery, primary and secondary departments, the new Breadalbane Community Campus includes a library, a swimming pool, squash courts, a gym, a cafe and a range of other facilities. These amenities are open to the public throughout the day. Only access to the school areas is restricted to authorised personnel.

Aberfeldy Parish Church meets in the former Breadalbane Church building in Taybridge Road, which was the first new building of the Free Church after the Disruption of 1843. It reunited with the former parish church, St Andrew&#x27;s in Crieff Road, built in 1884, and for a while was used as halls for the united congregation, until 2005 when the Crieff Road building was closed and a modern interior and suite of halls was added to the Taybridge Road building, providing excellent facilities for adult and youth work. There is also a Roman Catholic parish in Home Street. The buildings formerly used as Congregational, Free, and Episcopal churches are now all used for other purposes. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses meet in the local Kingdom Hall. The town is also home to the award-winning Aberfeldy Watermill Bookshop Gallery and Cafe.

Aberfeldy does not have a theatre or a music hall. However it does have two community venues, used regularly for music and drama, Aberfeldy Town Hall and the Locus Centre. These are managed by Locus Breadalbane, a community charity. The nearest venues are the Pitlochry Festival Theatre, the Perth Theatre or the Perth Concert Hall. The new Community School has an auditorium.

The Birks Cinema, built in the very heart of the town in 1939 in a late Art Deco style, closed in the early 1980s for lack of business. It then turned into an amusement hall, for which purpose the entire interior was demolished. The amusement hall closed in 2004 and the building stood as an empty shell for several years. In 2009 it was bought by the &quot;Friends of the Birks&quot; with a grant from the Scottish Government&#x27;s Town Centre Regeneration Fund with plans to refurbish and reopen as a new 92-seat cinema and café-bar. The Friends are now a formal company limited by guarantee and registered as a charity. In spring 2011, the Birks project was awarded £658,520 by the Scotland Rural Development Programme - half the sum needed to carry out the building work. Match funding for the SRDP grant has now been raised - notably through a Big Lottery grant of £539,950 announced on 9 February 2012. Building work began in April 2012 and opened in Spring 2013. The patron of the project is the actor Alan Cumming, who was born in the town.

Aberfeldy is the location of the poem &quot;The Birks of Aberfeldy&quot; by Robert Burns:

In 2001, the author J.K. Rowling purchased the nearby 19th-century Killiechassie House, on the banks of the River Tay.

==Baryte mining==
The Precambrian Dalradian geological formations in the Highlands north of Aberfeldy contain substantial deposits of the mineral baryte, which is mostly used as a weighting agent for drilling fluids to prevent blow-outs in oil and gas exploration wells. There are three locations with exploitable quantities of it. The Foss Mine, some NW of Aberfeldy at has been operational since 1984 and production averages 50,000 tonnes per annum. So far some 525,000 tonnes have been extracted there by M-I SWACO. In 1990, a locally based company began opencast extraction near the summit of Ben Eagach, due north of Aberfeldy. Approximately 25,000 tonnes were mined from a series of small pits which have now been abandoned.

The largest formation, containing a 7.5-million-tonne reserve is at Duntanlich, some due north of Aberfeldy, south of Loch Tummel. In 1994, an application by MI Great Britain Ltd for an underground operation to mine the deposits was turned down. In 2000, M I Drilling Fluids UK unfolded new plans to establish a mine at Duntanlich to take six million tonnes from the deposit over the next 50 years and began preliminary talks with Perth &amp; Kinross Council and Scottish Natural Heritage. However, it was decided at that time not to take these proposals forward.

==Demographics==
The Scottish Census of 2001 recorded the town&#x27;s population as 1,895. Perth and Kinross Council estimates the current population to be 2,292, which is forecasted to grow to over 2,800 by 2028.

==Sport==
Breadalbane Cricket Club, founded in 1869, play home matches at Victoria Park in Aberfeldy. The team are the Perthshire Cup Winners for 2007 and 2008, and Strathmore Cricket Union Division One Champions in 2006 &amp; 2007, Division Two Champions in 2014 &amp; 2018, and Perthshire Indoor League Champions 2013, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020. The town also has a rugby union side Aberfeldy RFC that plays in the league at the town&#x27;s Wade Park.

==Namesake==
Aberfeldie, the suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia was named, indirectly, after the town, as was the locality of Aberfeldy, Victoria.

<text>Maurice Pascal Alers Hankey, 1st Baron Hankey, (1 April 1877 – 26 January 1963) was a British civil servant who gained prominence as the first Cabinet Secretary and later made the rare transition from the civil service to ministerial office. He is best known as the highly-efficient top aide to Prime Minister David Lloyd George and the War Cabinet, which directed Britain during the First World War.

In the estimation of his biographer John F. Naylor, Hankey held to the &quot;certainties of a late Victorian imperialist, whose policies sought to maintain British domination abroad and to avoid as far as possible British entanglement within Europe. His patriotism stands inviolable, but his sensitivity to processes of historical change proved limited&quot;. Naylor found, &quot;Hankey did not altogether grasp the virulence of fascism ... except as a military threat to Britain; nor did he ever quite comprehend the changing face of domestic politics which Labour&#x27;s emergence as a party of government entailed. ... In these shortcomings Hankey was typical of his generation and background; that his responsibility was greater lay in the fact that he was better informed than nearly any of his contemporaries&quot;.

==Personal life==
The third son of R. A. Hankey, Maurice Hankey was born at Biarritz in 1877 and educated at Rugby School. He joined the Royal Marine Artillery, was promoted to captain and served in successive roles, including as coastal defence analyst in the War Division of the Naval Intelligence Department (1902–1906). His youngest brother, Donald Hankey, was a soldier best known for a series of essays that he wrote while he served on the Western Front in World War I. Donald died in action at Battle of the Somme.

Around Christmas 1902, Hankey met Adeline de Smidt. They married in September 1903. The couple had a strong and supportive relationship, with Adeline frequently accompanying him to social engagements with prominent figures, and to significant events such as the Paris Peace Conference and the Genoa Conference. They had four children: Robert (born 1905), Ursula (born 1909), Christopher (born 1911) and Henry (born 1914). A fifth child was stillborn in 1916. The Hankey family moved several times while their children were young, living in Malta for a year in 1907 before eventually settling in Highstead near Limpsfield, Surrey.

Lord Hankey died in 1963, aged 85, and was succeeded in his barony by his eldest son, Robert.

== Career in government ==
In 1908, Hankey was appointed Naval Assistant Secretary to the Committee of Imperial Defence. He became Secretary to the Committee in 1912, a position that he would hold for 26 years. In November 1914, he took on the additional duty of Secretary of the War Council. In that function, he took notice of the ideas of Major Ernest Swinton to build a tracked armoured vehicle and brought them to the attention of Winston Churchill on 25 December 1914. This led to the eventual creation of the Landship Committee.

In December 1916, David Lloyd George became Prime Minister and greatly changed how the government was run. A small War Cabinet was instigated, and Hankey was appointed as its Secretary and served as Secretary of the Imperial War Cabinet, which also incorporated representatives of the Colonies and Dominion governments. He gained such a reputation for strong competency that when the full Cabinet was restored in 1919, the secretariat was retained, and Hankey then served as Secretary to the Cabinet for 19 years.

In 1923, he acquired the further position of Clerk of the Privy Council. During his long tenure, he would also often serve as British Secretary to many international conferences and Secretary-General of many Imperial Conferences. John Cairncross, one of the Cambridge Spies, briefly served as his secretary. 

In August 1938, Hankey retired from government and became a British Government Director of the Suez Canal Company, a post that he would hold for only one year. Hankey remained a respected figure and was often consulted by ministers and civil servants for advice. In August 1939, he advised Neville Chamberlain about the formation of a new War Cabinet and, the following month, became another of Chamberlain&#x27;s many non-party political appointments when he was made Minister without Portfolio and a member of the War Cabinet. Hankey was reluctant to take on the task but agreed to do so. He became Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster when Chamberlain was succeeded by Winston Churchill in May 1940 but was left out of Churchill&#x27;s War Cabinet.

In July 1941, Lord Hankey was moved to the position of Paymaster General, but the following year, he was dropped from the government altogether. He continued to hold other positions in both the public and private sectors until his death.

==Post-war writings==
After World War II, Hankey emerged as a leading critic of the war crimes trials, and in his 1950 book &quot;Politics, Trials and Errors&quot;, he argued that the Allies had no right to convict German and Japanese leaders of war crimes. Hankey kept a series of handwritten diaries throughout most of his years as a civil servant, including during his time as Secretary to the War Council and Imperial War Cabinet of the First World War. The diaries are currently held at the Churchill Archives Centre in Cambridge, England, and can be read by the public.

==Honours==
In the 1912 Birthday Honours, Hankey was appointed to the Order of the Bath as a Companion. He was then promoted within the same order as a Knight Commander in 1916 and as a Knight Grand Cross in 1919. In the 1929 Birthday Honours, Sir Maurice was appointed to the Order of St Michael and St George as a Knight Grand Cross. In the 1934 New Year Honours, Sir Maurice was appointed to the Royal Victorian Order as a Knight Grand Cross.

In the 1939 New Year Honours, he was raised to the peerage as &quot;Baron Hankey, of The Chart in the County of Surrey&quot;. The same year, he was also appointed to the Privy Council. In 1942, he was elected to the Royal Society as a Fellow under Statute 12 for those &quot;who have rendered conspicuous service to the cause of science, or are such that election would be of signal benefit to the Society&quot;.

<text>Judge William Fleming (July 6, 1736 – February 15, 1824) was an American lawyer, jurist and political figure from Cumberland County, Virginia. He is often confused with his contemporary, Colonel William Fleming, who briefly served as Governor of Virginia during the American Revolution.

==Biography==
Judge Fleming received his education at The College of William &amp; Mary, after which he started practicing law before the county courts. In 1772, he became a member of the House of Burgesses, representing Cumberland County as his father John Fleming had done before him, and remained in this position until that body was terminated by the revolution. When the new state government of Virginia was instituted, he went back to Williamsburg as a member of the first House of Delegates.

On December 10, 1778, he was elected a member of Continental Congress, but it was April 1779 before he reported there. In September, he took a leave of absence and returned to Virginia and the House of Delegates. In 1781, he was elected and began serving as a judge of the Virginia general court. Governor Beverley Randolph subsequently appointed Fleming to the Supreme Court of Appeals. When the court was reorganized in 1788, he was one of the five judges chosen for the new court. He became president and chief justice of the Court in 1809, a position he held until his death on February 15, 1824.

==Summerville==
In 1777, William Fleming moved from his plantation, Mt. Pleasant, in Cumberland County (changed to Powhatan County in that year), to neighboring Chesterfield County where he had bought another plantation called Summerville from Robert Moseley. This was to be his home for the remainder of his life. During his ownership, Summerville&#x27;s land acreage increased from 528 acres to 906 acres. In 1781, while Richmond was being raided by Benedict Arnold, then Governor Thomas Jefferson stayed at Summerville for a night with his college friend William Fleming. Both Jefferson and Fleming had attended the College of William &amp; Mary. Summerville was a working plantation in Virginia and as such, it had a number of slaves attending to it. In the 1820 United States census, William Fleming is reported as having 13 slaves, 9 males and 4 females. Many of these slaves died at Summerville and were buried in the burial grounds. On February 15, 1824, Judge Fleming died at his house at Summerville and was buried there as well. Summerville continued to be a prosperous plantation up until the end of the Civil War, at which point all of the slaves were emancipated. This caused the plantation to go to ruin and it appears that the Summerville house was abandoned. In the late 1980s most of the Summerville tract was built over by a housing development, including the area where the house would have stood and most likely the burial grounds of the slaves and William Fleming.

<text>The Wensleydale Railway is a heritage railway in Wensleydale and Lower Swaledale in North Yorkshire, England. It was built in stages by different railway companies and originally extended to Garsdale railway station on the Settle-Carlisle line. Since 2003, the remaining line has been run as a heritage railway. The line runs between Northallerton West station, about a fifteen-minute walk from station on the East Coast Main Line, and .

Regular passenger services operate between Leeming Bar and , with a shuttle to Scruton, occasional freight services and excursions travel the full length of the line.

The line formerly ran from Northallerton to on the Settle-Carlisle Railway but the track between Redmire and Garsdale has been lifted and several bridges have been demolished, although one of the stated aims of the Wensleydale Railway is to reinstate the line from Redmire to Garsdale. Additionally, a separate proposal exists to link Hawes to Garsdale with a view to providing commuter and tourist services rather than heritage services.

==History==
On 26 June 1846, an act of Parliament (the Great North of England and Bedale Branch Railway Act 1846) authorised the Newcastle &amp; Darlington Junction Railway, and its successor the York, Newcastle and Berwick Railway, to build a line between Northallerton and Bedale. The section between Northallerton and Leeming Lane opened on 6 March 1848. The section between Leeming Bar and Bedale that was authorised by the act was not built, due to the collapse of George Hudson&#x27;s railway interests. This left the railway to terminate just west of the Great North Road in Leeming Bar, with passengers for Bedale being conveyed on the last section by horse and cart.
The Bedale and Leyburn Railway, financed by local landowners, was an extension between Leeming Bar and Leyburn that was authorised on 4 August 1853; the section between Leeming Bar and Bedale station opened on 1 February 1855 and the remainder on 28 November 1855 for goods and minerals and 19 May 1856 for passengers. The York, Newcastle and Berwick had become a founder member of the North Eastern Railway (NER) on 31 July 1854, and the Bedale and Leyburn was absorbed into this larger company in 1859.

The Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle upon Tyne Junction Railway had been proposed in the mid-1840s railway mania to link Settle, Hawes and Askrigg, and the (9 &amp; 10 Vict. c. xc) gave permission for a main line from Elslack, on the Leeds and Bradford Railway, to Scorton on the Richmond branch of the Great North of England Railway, and a branch line to Hawes, but this scheme failed.

In the late 1860s, several competing railways proposed to serve the agricultural land around Hawes. Eventually, an Act of Parliament raised by the Midland Railway that mostly related to the Settle and Carlisle line but included a branch off this line between Garsdale and Hawes was authorised on 16 July 1866. An Act of Parliament raised by the North Eastern Railway for a railway between Leyburn and Hawes was authorised on 4 July 1870, though work did not start until 1874. The section of this railway between Leyburn and Askrigg opened on 1 February 1877; the section between Askrigg and Hawes was opened for goods on 1 June 1878. The Hawes branch of the Settle and Carlisle line was opened for goods on 1 August 1878; the sections between Askrigg and Hawes and between Hawes and Garsdale were both opened for passengers on 1 October 1878. The delays in the section between Hawes Junction and Hawes was down to the heavier engineering required on this section (one tunnel and two viaducts) with steeper gradients. In the months before the section opened, a landslip at Mossdale required extra work to excavate from the line.

At this point, there was a through route between Northallerton and Garsdale. Both companies had running powers over each others&#x27; lines; the NER ran passenger trains westwards from Hawes (but no freight) and the Midland only exercised their right to run trains eastwards to Leyburn with occasional excursion traffic.

===Rationalisation===
The line remained a single track branch line, except for the double track section between Leeming Bar and Bedale. Chief commodities transported on the line were coal, milk, and stone. One passenger train each way was operated between Garsdale and Hawes until 14 March 1959 at which point this part of the line closed to all traffic, however, freight continued from Northallerton to Hawes until 1964. On 27 April 1964, the line between Redmire and Hawes closed completely. The track west of Redmire was lifted and many bridges on this section of the line were demolished in 1965. Most freight traffic on the line ceased in 1982, with the exception of the limestone traffic from Redmire to Teesside for steel-making, though this freight flow ceased in December 1992 when British Steel switched its limestone source to Hardendale in Cumbria. As a result of the removal of all but the one daily train, Leyburn loop and signal box were closed. Some excursion tours ran to Redmire in the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s particularly the DalesRail services in 1977 which prompted interest in a renewed passenger service on the line.

==Services==
At the opening of the railway to Leyburn in 1856, services consisted of either five or six return journeys. With the eventual opening of the line by 1878, the NER rans five trains per day between Northallerton and Garsdale, with the Midland Railway running an additional daily return train from Hellifield to Hawes, known colloquially as &quot;Bonnyface&quot;. In the 1880s, the Midland Railway ran two stopping passengers trains on the Settle-Carlisle Line, which would connect with the NER local trains to Northallerton from Hawes Junction (Garsdale). The Midland (and later the LMS) ran a second early morning train to Hawes on a Tuesday only, this was the day of the cattle market in Hawes. The 1896 timetable shows five workings from Northallerton to Hawes, four of which continued on to Hawes Junction. The return number down the valley towards Northallerton was the same; five in total, with four originating at Hawes Junction.

In 1914, services amounted to five daily return trips on the full length of the line. A further two trains went part way; Northallerton to Bedale arriving at 10:07 am, and Northallerton to Leyburn, arriving at 11:47 pm. In the other direction, the two extra trains were Leyburn to Northallerton leaving at 6:10 am and Hawes to Northallerton leaving at 9:05 am. By 1939, three trains ran the full length of the line in both directions, with two extra services either terminating, or starting from Leyburn and Hawes. By 1942, only two trains ran the whole length of the line, but the third service was reinstated by 1950.

After services ceased running eastwards from Hawes in 1954, the &quot;Bonnyface&quot; became a once-daily train connecting Hawes with Hellifield.

==Restoration==
 




The Wensleydale Railway Association (WRA) was formed in 1990 with the main aim of restoring passenger services. When British Rail decided to try to sell the line between Northallerton and Redmire following cessation of the quarry trains to Redmire, the WRA decided to take a more proactive role and aimed to operate passenger services itself. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) had an interest in using the line between Northallerton and Redmire to transport armoured vehicles to/from Catterick Garrison. The MoD paid for repairs and restoration of the line and the installation of loading facilities at Redmire, and did not object to WRC taking over the line. A trial train ran in November 1993 and full MoD operations started in July 1996. These military transport trains continue to this day.

In 2000, WRA formed a separate operating company, the Wensleydale Railway plc (WRC), and issued a share offer to raise funds. £1.2 million was raised through this method. Railtrack agreed to lease the line between Northallerton and Redmire to WRC and a 99-year lease was signed in 2003. Passenger services restarted on 4 July 2003 with the stations at Leeming Bar and Leyburn being reopened. In 2004, the stations at Bedale, Finghall and Redmire were reopened. A passing loop was opened at the site of the former Constable Burton station, which enabled the railway to introduce a 2-train service when required.

In 2014, station was reopened and a new station built at , enabling passenger services to be extended east of Leeming Bar, but this section was closed to passengers again in August 2016 following a collision between a train and a car at a level crossing near Yafforth. It is hoped to recommence services at a future date once work to upgrade level crossing equipment is complete.

In 2016, it was reported that the railway carries over 50,000 people a year and that for every £1 spent on the railway, £4 is spent at one of the towns or villages on the route.

The company&#x27;s longer-term aim is to reopen the of line west from Redmire via Castle Bolton, Aysgarth, Askrigg, Bainbridge, Hawes and Mossdale to join up with the Settle-Carlisle Railway Route at Garsdale. A study commissioned by the railway indicated that an initial extension to Aysgarth from Redmire (), would generate an extra income of £3.1 million per year into the local economy with an additional £500,000 in annual ticket sales for the railway. The sale of Aysgarth Station and trackbed to a private individual in 2017 allowed the release of funds and the short term plan is to extend some to a brand new station serving Castle Bolton. This has been costed at £2 million and is listed in a five-year plan. In order to achieve this, the missing bridge that used to span Apedale Beck to the west of Redmire station will need to be replaced. There was a plan to do so utilising a redundant bridge from the Catterick branch line that was removed during the A1 to A1(M) upgrade in 2015 and stored in Redmire Station car park. However the bridge was subsequently found to be unsuitable and it has been cut up and removed.

In January 2019, Campaign for Better Transport released a report identifying the line which was listed as Priority 2 for reopening. Priority 2 is for those lines which require further development or a change in circumstances (such as housing developments).

In 2019, services were suspended between Leyburn and Redmire due to the deterioration of the track infrastructure. As of 2024, services are still to hopefully resume between the two stations with trains terminating at Leyburn. A fundraising appeal is currently taking place to fund the replacement of the life-expired track with a view to re-opening by September 2025.

===Upper Wensleydale Railway===
In late 2019/early 2020, a separate organisation, the Upper Wensleydale Railway, was formed to campaign to reinstate the line between and . The group&#x27;s objective is to have a timetabled year-round service run by a train operating company, rather than a heritage service. This scheme was shortlisted for funding in the second round of the government&#x27;s &quot;Reverse Beeching Fund&quot;, in June 2020.

==Company structure==

The Wensleydale Railway plc is responsible for the operation, maintenance and development of the railway line and passenger services. The company has a mixture of employed and volunteer staff.

The Wensleydale Railway Association (Trust) Ltd is a membership organisation and a registered charity that supports the development of the railway through fund raising, volunteer working, providing training and supporting work on heritage structures such as Scruton station and Bedale signal box.

==Locomotives==

Class 9F No. 92219 was removed from the railway in December 2020 to a private site in Tebay, subsequently moving to the Strathspey Railway in 2023. Other locos were also moved from the Wensleydale Railway at the same time due to the railway being overcrowded and needing space to operate.
The railway also has an 0-6-0 Sentinel Shunter and a Tyne and Wear Metro Shunter WL4.

Both 20169 and 37674, were moved from the Wensleydale Railway in December 2020.

Previously stored or unused locomotives, numbers No. 25313 (D7663), No. 31454, No. 37503 (D6717), No. 60086, and No. 60050 were all cleared from the railway in spring 2021.

In the autumn of 2020, BR Class 144 Nos. 144004 and 144016, were temporarily stored at the railway, awaiting onward transport by road to the Aln Valley Railway. They departed the Wensleydale Railway in December 2020.

==Incidents==
*15 February 1867 – two trains collided on a single line section west of Newton-le-Willows station. The westbound train was in the process of moving forward to reverse shunt into the siding to allow the eastbound train to enter the station. Both trains were signalled onto the single line section at the same time and so collided head-on. Injuries were only to passengers in the eastbound train. An inquiry recommended that a passing loop and a second platform be installed.
*24 December 1894 – the ex-Hawes goods train was shunting the yard at Bedale when a heavy goods train arriving from Darlington collided with it. One of the wagons went down an embankment, but there were no injuries. However, passengers had to detrain and walk through the station to rejoin trains on either side of the accident to continue their journeys.
*6 December 1900, a landslip north of Bedale Signal Box derailed a train so that it ended up in Bedale Beck. The fireman was scalded badly and taken to Northallerton Cottage Hospital, where he later died.
*1988 – a limestone train from Redmire derailed on the level crossing outside Bedale railway station, damaging the track and station. Rotten wooden sleepers were attributed as the cause, with the resultant accident taking over 48 hours to clear-up and causing chaos on the local road network.
*30 June 2011 – a tractor was hit by a train on Flood Bridge user-worked crossing (UWC).
*1 August 2011 – a car was hit by a train on Fox Park level crossing between and stations. No injuries were reported.
The above two accidents required the heritage railway to update and improve its safety management practices.
*20 October 2012 – a car was hit by a locomotive on Fox Park level crossing.
*30 January 2013 – a car was struck by a train at Aiskew level crossing, which took the A684 road over the railway (the A684 has bypassed this road since 2014).
*3 August 2016 – a heritage train heading west from Northallerton West railway station struck a car on the level crossing near to the village of Yafforth. The lights and audible alarms were determined to have been in good working order. The car driver and two passengers on the train were injured.

<doc id="1162381" wikidata="Q642995" url="?curid=1162381" title="Robert J. Lang">
<text>Robert James Lang (born May 4, 1961) is an American physicist who is also one of the foremost origami artists and theorists in the world. He is known for his complex and elegant designs, most notably of insects and animals. He has studied the mathematics of origami and used computers to study the theories behind origami. He has made great advances in making real-world applications of origami to engineering problems.

==Education and early occupation==

Lang was born in Dayton, Ohio, and grew up in Atlanta, Georgia. Lang studied electrical engineering at the California Institute of Technology, where he met his wife-to-be, Diane. He earned a master&#x27;s degree in electrical engineering at Stanford University in 1983, and returned to Caltech for a Ph.D. in applied physics, with a dissertation titled &quot;Semiconductor Lasers: New Geometries and Spectral Properties.&quot;

Lang began work for NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 1988. Lang also worked as a research scientist for Spectra Diode Labs of San Jose, California, and then at JDS Uniphase, also of San Jose.

Lang has authored or co-authored over 80 publications on semiconductor lasers, optics, and integrated optoelectronics, and holds 46 patents in these fields. In 2001, Lang left the engineering field to be a full-time origami artist and consultant. However, he still maintains ties to his physics background: he was the editor-in-chief of the &quot;IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics&quot; from 2007 to 2010, and has done part-time laser consulting for Cypress Semiconductor, among others. Lang currently resides in Altadena, California.

==Origami==
Lang was introduced to origami at the age of six by a teacher who had exhausted other methods of keeping him entertained in the classroom. By his early teens, he was designing original origami patterns. Lang used origami as an escape from the pressures of undergraduate studies. While studying at Caltech, Lang came into contact with other origami masters such as Michael LaFosse, John Montroll, Joseph Wu, and Paul Jackson through the Origami Center of America, now known as OrigamiUSA.

While in Germany for postdoctoral work, Lang and his wife were enamored of Black Forest cuckoo clocks, and he became a sensation in the origami world when he successfully folded one after three months of design and six hours of actual folding.

In 1990, Lang first attempted to write computer code that would solve origami problems, and the result was his first version of &quot;Tree Maker&quot;. Lang takes full advantage of modern technology in his origami, including using a laser cutter to help score paper for complex folds.

Lang is recognized as one of the leading theorists of the mathematics of origami. He has developed ways to algorithmetize the design process for origami, and is the author of the proof of the completeness of the Huzita–Hatori axioms.

Lang specializes in finding real-world applications for the various theories of origami he has developed. These included designing folding patterns for a German airbag manufacturer. He has worked with the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, California, where a team is developing a powerful space telescope, with a 100 m (328 ft) lens in the form of a thin membrane. Lang was engaged by the team to develop a way to fit the tremendous lens, known as the Eyeglass, into a small rocket in such a way that the lens can be unfolded in space and will not suffer from any permanent marks or creases. Lang is the author or co-author of eight books and many articles on origami. Lang also designed the Google Doodle for Akira Yoshizawa&#x27;s 101st birthday, which was used by Google on March 14, 2012.

==Awards and honors==
In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.

<doc id="1162391" wikidata="Q334543" url="?curid=1162391" title="Henry Wellesley, 1st Baron Cowley">
<text>Henry Wellesley, 1st Baron Cowley GCB (20 January 1773 – 27 April 1847) was an Anglo-Irish diplomat and politician. He was the younger brother of the soldier and politician the first Duke of Wellington. He is known particularly for his service as British Ambassador to Spain during the Peninsular War where he acted in cooperation with his brother to gain the support of Cortes of Cádiz. His later postings included being Ambassador in Vienna where he dealt with Metternich and British Ambassador to France during the reign of Louis Philippe I.

His career was closely connected with that of his elder brothers Arthur and Richard Wellesley, who served as Foreign Secretary between 1809 and 1812. He became embroiled in a public scandal in 1809 when his wife Charlotte eloped with Henry Paget who as Lord Uxbridge was later to serve as cavalry commander under his brother at the Battle of Waterloo.

==Background and education==

Wellesley was the fifth and youngest son of Garret Wesley, 1st Earl of Mornington, by Anne Hill-Trevor, eldest daughter of Arthur Hill-Trevor, 1st Viscount Dungannon, both families of Anglo-Irish descent. He was the younger brother of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley, and William Wellesley-Pole, 3rd Earl of Mornington. He was educated at Eton and at the court of the Duke of Brunswick. He purchased an ensigncy in the 40th Foot in 1790.

==Diplomatic career==
Wellesley&#x27;s diplomatic career began in 1791 when he was appointed attaché to the British embassy at The Hague. The next year, he became Secretary of Legation in Stockholm. In 1791, he exchanged into the 1st Foot Guards and in 1793, he purchased a Lieutenancy. In 1794, while on a trip home from Lisbon with his sister Anne, he was captured by the French, and remained in prison during the height of the terror, escaping only in 1795. Later that year, he sat for the Trim constituency in the Irish House of Commons.

At the 1807 general election he was elected to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom as a Member of Parliament both for the Athlone constituency in Ireland, and for Eye constituency in England.
He chose to sit for Eye, and held the seat until his resignation in 1809 by taking the Chiltern Hundreds.

In 1797, Wellesley accompanied Lord Malmesbury as secretary on his unsuccessful mission to negotiate peace with the French at Lille. Later that year, he travelled to India, where he became private secretary to his oldest brother, Lord Mornington, the new governor-general. He was in India between 1797 and 1799, and again from 1801 to 1802, and was a useful assistant to his brother in a variety of diplomatic capacities, negotiating treaties with Mysore and Oudh.

In 1802 he returned to Europe, and the next year married Lady Charlotte Cadogan, by whom he had three sons and a daughter before she abandoned him in 1809, running off with Lord Paget, a talented cavalry officer. They divorced in 1810. Although, at first, Paget&#x27;s career was badly affected by the affair, as he was later unable to serve under Wellesley&#x27;s brother Wellington in the Peninsular Campaign due to the bad blood, Paget later distinguished himself under Wellington at Waterloo.

In 1809, Wellesley became the British envoy to Spain – his eldest brother, by now Marquess Wellesley, was now Foreign Secretary, while his brother Arthur (now Viscount Wellington) was the commander of the Anglo-Portuguese forces in the Iberian Peninsula. Together, the three brothers helped to make the Peninsular campaign a success, and in 1812 Wellesley was knighted. He remained Ambassador to Spain until 1821, but found time to marry again, this time to Lady Georgiana Cecil, daughter of the Marquess of Salisbury. 

In 1823, Wellesley became Ambassador to Austria, where he remained until 1831. Although he was close acquaintances with Foreign Secretary George Canning, who had asked Wellesley to serve as his second in his duel with Lord Castlereagh, Wellesley felt that Canning did not appreciate his services, feeling him to be too conciliatory.

In January 1828, Wellesley was created Baron Cowley, of Wellesley in the County of Somerset, due to his brother Wellington&#x27;s influence with the prime minister, Lord Goderich. His final diplomatic service was in Paris, where he served as British ambassador to France during Robert Peel&#x27;s administrations in 1835 and 1841–46. In 1846, Cowley retired, but remained in Paris, where he died the next year.

==Family==
Cowley married Lady Charlotte, daughter of Charles Cadogan, 1st Earl Cadogan in 1803, but they divorced in 1810 after she ran away with Henry Paget, Lord Paget, later 1st Marquess of Anglesey. He later remarried, to Lady Georgiana Cecil, daughter of James Cecil, 1st Marquess of Salisbury.

His eldest son, Henry Richard Charles Wellesley, followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps as a diplomatist, holding the Paris embassy for fifteen years, and was eventually created Earl Cowley. Another son, Gerald Valerian Wellesley, became Dean of Windsor. His second son William became a captain in the Royal Navy.

<doc id="1162392" wikidata="Q1454319" url="?curid=1162392" title="Liberty pole">
<text>A liberty pole is a wooden pole, or sometimes spear or lance, surmounted by a &quot;cap of liberty&quot;, mostly of the Phrygian cap. The symbol originated in the immediate aftermath of the assassination of the Roman dictator Julius Caesar by a group of Rome&#x27;s Senators in 44 BCE. Immediately after Caesar was killed the assassins, or Liberatores as they called themselves, went through the streets with their bloody weapons held up, one carrying a pileus (a kind of skullcap that identified a freed slave, not in fact a Phrygian cap) carried on the tip of a spear. This symbolized that the Roman people had been freed from the rule of Caesar, which the assassins claimed had become a tyranny because it overstepped the authority of the Senate and thus betrayed the Republic.
The liberty pole was not thereafter part of the normal Roman depiction of Libertas, the Roman goddess of liberty, who is very often shown holding out a pileus, and carrying a pole or rod. Both refer to the ceremony granting freeman status to a slave, where the subject was touched with the rod, and given the hat. But the hat raised on the end of the pole was shown as an attribute held by Libertas on some coins of the emperor Antoninus Pius, which was enough, with the literary references, to bring it to the attention of Renaissance antiquarians. The pileus itself was shown between two daggers, with the inscription &quot;Ides of March&quot;, on some very famous coins made by the assassins of Julius Caesar in the civil war following the assassination.

After the Renaissance, the liberty pole became a common element in the depiction of liberty, initially in a small version carried by personifications, and also later as a larger actual physical object planted in the ground, used as a type of flagstaff.

==Revival from the Renaissance onwards==

When the motif was revived during the 16th century it was mostly carried by national or political personifications. Its first appearance as an attribute of Liberty in an Italian emblem book was in 1556, later followed by many others. In his &quot;Apotheosis of Venice&quot; (1585) in the Doge&#x27;s Palace, Paolo Veronese has the ascendant Republic of Venice (personified as a woman) flanked by several symbolic persons, one of whom represents Liberty, dressed as a peasant hoisting a red Phrygian cap on a spear.

The Dutch Maiden, national personification of the Dutch United Provinces fighting to escape from Spanish rule, often carries a hat on a pole. In these cases, the hat is the normal contemporary respectable man&#x27;s hat, usually with a broad and stiff brim. With considerable cheek, Louis XIV of France had a medal cast in 1678, after the Treaty of Nijmegen ended the war started by his invasion of the Netherlands; this showed the Maiden &quot;standing beside Peace, and receiving the instructions of Prudence&quot;.

The imagery was introduced to Britain, partly by the Dutch William III of England, who in one medal presents a cap of liberty to the kneeling England, Scotland and Ireland. When Britannia was pictured as &quot;British Liberty&quot;, she usually exchanged the trident she normally carried for a liberty pole. An example of this is a large monument, originally called the &quot;Column of British Liberty&quot;, now usually just the &quot;Column to Liberty&quot;, begun in the 1750s on his Gibside estate outside Newcastle-on-Tyne by the hugely wealthy Sir George Bowes, reflecting his Whig politics. Set at the top of a steep hillock, the monument itself is taller than Nelson&#x27;s Column in London, and topped by a bronze female figure, originally gilded, carrying a cap of liberty on a pole.

During the 18th century, the Roman pileus was confused with the Phrygian cap, and this mis-identification then led to the Phrygian cap, familiar from other uses in Roman sculpture, becoming the standard shape when a cap of liberty was used as a political symbol.

;Liberty poles carried by personifications
The image of Libertas holding a liberty pole can be found on the seals of some British American colonies, notably those of Trustee Georgia and North Carolina.

==American Revolution==

Liberty poles were often erected in town squares in the years before and during the American Revolution (e.g. Concord, Massachusetts; Newport, Rhode Island; Caughnawaga, New York; Savannah, Georgia and Englewood, New Jersey). Some colonists erected liberty poles on their own private land (such as in Bedford, Massachusetts since 1964 and Woburn, Massachusetts—the pole raising there is reenacted annually). An often violent struggle over liberty poles erected by the Sons of Liberty in New York City raged for 10 years. The poles were periodically destroyed by the royal authorities (see the Battle of Golden Hill), only to be replaced by the Sons with new ones. The conflict lasted from the repeal of the Stamp Act in 1766 until the revolutionary New York Provincial Congress came to power in 1775. The liberty pole in New York City had been crowned with a gilt vane bearing the single word, &quot;Liberty&quot;. Under the Sedition Act of 1798, authorities indicted several men in Massachusetts for erecting a liberty pole bearing the inscription &quot;No Stamp Act, No Sedition Act, No Alien Bills, No Land Tax, downfall to the Tyrants of America; peace and retirement to the President; Long Live the Vice President&quot;.

In some locales—notably in Boston—a liberty tree rather than a pole served the same political purpose.

During the Siege of Boston on August 1, 1775, a tall liberty pole was erected on Prospect Hill, a fortified high-ground overlooking the road to British-occupied Boston. Both the &quot;Appeal to Heaven&quot; Pine Tree Flag and Grand Union Flag (aka Continental Colors) are reported to have flown on Prospect Hill. The 76 foot long liberty pole was originally a ship&#x27;s mast that had been recently captured from the British armed schooner HMS &quot;Diana&quot; (1775), in the aftermath of the Battle of Chelsea Creek on May 27 and 28, 1775.

When an ensign was raised (usually red) on a liberty pole, it would be a calling for the Sons of Liberty or townspeople to meet and vent or express their views regarding British rule. The pole was known to be a symbol of dissent against Great Britain. The symbol is also apparent in many seals and coats of arms as a sign of liberty, freedom, and independence.

==Other uses==
During the Whiskey Rebellion, locals in western Pennsylvania would erect poles along the roads or in town centers as a protest against the federal government&#x27;s tax on distilled spirits, and evoke the spirit embodied by the liberty poles of decades earlier.

The &quot;&quot; (&quot;liberty trees&quot;) were a symbol of the French Revolution, mostly living trees newly planted. The first was planted in 1790 by a pastor of a Vienne village, inspired by the 1765 Liberty Tree of Boston. One was also planted in front of the City Hall of Amsterdam on 4 March 1795, in celebration of the alliance between the French Republic and the Batavian Republic. In 1798, with the establishment of the short-lived Roman Republic, a liberty tree was planted in Rome&#x27;s Piazza delle Scole, to mark the legal abolition of the Roman Ghetto. After resumption of Papal rule, the Vatican reinstated the Roman ghetto.

The liberty pole can also be seen on the coat of arms of Argentina.
The image of Liberty holding a pole topped by a Phrygian cap appears on many mid- and late-19th-century U.S. silver coins. These are broadly classified as United States Seated Liberty coinage.

===Dedham Liberty Pole===

Residents in Dedham, Massachusetts awoke one October morning in 1798 to find a large wooden pole had been erected on the Hartford Road in Clapboard Trees parish. At the top was a hand painted sign declaring
No Stamp act; no sedition; no alien bill; no land tax.
Downfall to the tyrants of America; peace and 
retirement to the President; long live the vice
President and the minority; May moral government
be the basis of civil government.
This liberty pole was erected by David Brown, an itinerant veteran of the American Revolution who traveled from town to town in Massachusetts, drumming up subscribers for a series of political pamphlets he had written. Brown was assisted by Benjamin Fairbanks and about 40 others. Brown held the ladder while another, presumably Fairbanks, put up the sign. Nathaniel Ames was also very likely involved. When it appeared, Fisher Ames and the rest of Dedham&#x27;s Federalist community were enraged. 

Fairbanks, a prosperous farmer and former Selectman but also an &quot;impressionable, rather excitable man,&quot; was quickly arrested and charged with violating the Sedition Act of 1798. Brown, on the other hand, eluded authorities until March 1799, when he was caught in Andover, 28 miles away. 

When the trial came, Fairbanks was brought before the court first. Fairbanks, facing the &quot;powerful forces&quot; arrayed against him, confessed on June 8. Justice Samuel Chase sentenced Fairbanks to six hours in prison and a fine of five dollars, plus court costs of 10 shillings, the lightest sentence ever given for any of the Sedition Act defendants.

On June 9, Brown also pled guilty, but he was not shown the same mercy as Fairbanks. Chase accepted the guilty plea, but insisted on trying the case anyway so that the &quot;degree of his guilt might be duly ascertained.&quot; Chase offered Brown a chance to reduce his sentence by naming everyone involved with his &quot;mischievous and dangerous pursuits,&quot; and the names of all those who subscribed to his pamphlets. Brown refused, saying, &quot;I shall lose all my friends.&quot; 

Brown was sentenced to 18 months in prison and a $480 fine, the harshest sentence ever imposed under the Sedition Act. As he did not have the money, and had no way of earning it while in prison, Brown petitioned President John Adams for a pardon in July 1800, and then again in February 1801. Adams refused both times, keeping Brown in prison. When Thomas Jefferson became president, one of his first acts was to issue a general pardon for any person convicted under the Sedition Act.

<text>Anthony Sanneh (born June 1, 1971) is an American former professional soccer player who played as a defender or midfielder.

==Club career==

===Youth and college===
Tony Sanneh was born in Saint Paul, Minnesota to an African father from Gambia and an American mother from Wisconsin. He attended the St. Paul Academy and Summit School and played for the local soccer team, St. Paul Blackhawks. He graduated in 1990 having been selected twice to the All State team. He went on to play college soccer for the NCAA Division I Milwaukee Panthers, where, as a striker, he became the school&#x27;s all-time scoring leader, with 53 goals and 32 assists from 1990 to 1993. He was named an NCAA Second-Team All-American in 1993.

===Professional===
In 1994, his first year out of college, Sanneh played with USISL&#x27;s Milwaukee Rampage, where he scored 14 goals and 14 assists while teaming up with Brian McBride. His partnership with McBride was highlighted by a goal that the latter scored during the opening 2002 World Cup match against Portugal, which originated from a cross by Sanneh. During the winter 1994 season, Sanneh joined the indoor soccer Chicago Power of the National Professional Soccer League (NPSL). He played 34 games, scoring 27 goals in the 1994–95 season. He also played goalkeeper in four games for a total of 79:15 minutes. In the 1995–96 indoor season, he played in only nine games, scoring four goals, but also played 4:19 minutes as a goalkeeper. In 1995, he played with a former Milwaukee Panthers teammate, Manny Lagos, on the Minnesota Thunder, amassing 18 goals and 22 assists with the team. He also played the 1995–96 indoor season with the Milwaukee Wave. In 1996, midway through the inaugural MLS season, Sanneh was signed by D.C. United. Originally a forward, Tony played a variety of positions for United, mostly at right midfield. He went on to score goals in the first two MLS Cups, leading D.C. to consecutive titles. Sanneh ended his original MLS stay after the 1998 season, signing with Bundesliga club Hertha BSC in January 1999.

Sanneh spent the next three years with Hertha, where he was a starter when healthy. His playing time was limited at times due to many injuries and a national team tug of war. He scored just one goal in league play, and is remembered for assisting on Ali Daei&#x27;s first UEFA Champions League goal in a 2–1 victory over Chelsea. He transferred to 1. FC Nürnberg in 2001, where he played nearly every game the first year and a half leading the back line until he sustained a back injury that kept him out of action for 13 months. During his injury layoff Nürnberg was demoted to the second league. Upon his return Sanneh started the last seven games, winning five in a row, to give Nürnberg promotion and the second Bundesliga crown. He tallied a total of five goals. In 2004, he came back to MLS, signing with the Columbus Crew, to play alongside long-time friend, college and Thunder teammate Manny Lagos. The crew finished the season with the league&#x27;s best record and a 19-game unbeaten streak but lost in the playoffs after they missed two penalty kicks, one of which marred Sanneh&#x27;s time there. Sanneh was traded following the end of the season to the Chicago Fire, in exchange for Ante Razov and part of an allocation. He played out the 2006 season assisting on the final goal of the Fire&#x27;s 3–1 Open Cup win over the L.A. Galaxy. Sanneh&#x27;s MLS league totals stand at 16 goals and 27 assists.

However, following the 2006 season, Sanneh and the Fire failed to reach a new agreement on his contract, prompting his release from the team. On July 24, 2007, USL First Division team Minnesota Thunder announced that they had signed Sanneh. The Colorado Rapids then acquired his rights from the Fire. He made his debut for the Rapids on August 16, 2007, against the New England Revolution at Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods Park. He played in 10 out of their final 12 games but did not agree to terms the following season.

After sitting out the 2008 season, he signed with Los Angeles Galaxy in February 2009. He made 13 appearances with the Western Conference champions (including five starts) but struggled with injuries the latter half of the season and was not invited to 2010&#x27;s training camp.

==International career==
Sanneh made his debut for the United States national team on January 29, 1997, in a 2–1 loss to China but failed to make Steve Sampson&#x27;s final squad and was left out of the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France.

Sanneh then had very good seasons from there on out, enough to impress new U.S. coach Bruce Arena scoring his first international goal in a shock 3–0 win over Germany. Eventually, he became an important part of the team by the time the 2002 FIFA World Cup came around and was one of the US best players in the tournament, playing every minute of every game. In the US first game of the tournament, a 3–2 upset of Portugal, his precise cross from the right side of the field provided an assist to Brian McBride&#x27;s goal. He was also instrumental, both defensively and offensively, in the US narrow 1–0 loss to Germany in the quarterfinals, barely missing an equalizing goal on two occasions in the 47th and 89th minute.

After the 2002 FIFA World Cup, Sanneh was rarely picked due to injury and an influx of young talent into the national team pool. However, after playing impressively for the Columbus Crew and Chicago Fire in MLS, he was recalled for the 2005 CONCACAF Gold Cup, starting in group games against Cuba and Costa Rica. The US later won the tournament upon beating Panama in the final. Following the tournament he was never called back into the national team and Sanneh finished his career for the US national team with three goals in 43 appearances.

==Post-playing career==
Sanneh operates his own soccer camp system in the Midwest and U.S. Virgin Islands. He also is a coach and consultant for the club soccer team Minneapolis United. In addition to overseeing youth development, he is the founder and executive director of his own charitable foundation headquartered in St. Paul (www.thesannehfoundation.org) which, among other initiatives, aims to help urban youth and also assists in recovery efforts in Haiti.

As of 2013, Sanneh has been playing with Brits Pub FC a local recreational team in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

In the summer of 2013, Sanneh formed a Minnesota Thunder Legends team for a match against the Stegman&#x27;s Old Boys of Minneapolis in partnership with The Free Beer Movement to help raise money for The Sanneh Foundation.

Sanneh has also been an active participant in the Sports Diplomacy Sports Envoy program for the U.S. Department of State. In this function, he has traveled to Bahrain, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Cyprus, Haiti, and Malaysia, where he worked with to conduct soccer clinics and events that reached more than 3000 youth from underserved areas. In so doing, Sanneh helped contribute to Sports Diplomacy&#x27;s mission to reach out to youth populations in order to promote growth and a mutual understanding through sports.

In November 2014, Sanneh received the Athletes in Excellence Award from The Foundation for Global Sports Development, in recognition of his community service efforts and work with youth.

In 2017, Sanneh was inducted into the United States Amateur Soccer Association (USASA) Hall of Fame.

In February 2018, Sanneh received the Community Advocate for Change Award from Saint Mary&#x27;s University of Minnesota.

<text>Hornazo () is a Spanish meat pie eaten in the provinces of Salamanca and Ávila. It is made with flour and yeast and stuffed with pork loin, spicy chorizo, and hard-boiled eggs.

In Salamanca, it is traditionally eaten in the field during the &quot;Monday of the Waters&quot; (&quot;Lunes de aguas&quot;) festival. The name of this unique festival supposedly comes from a twisting of the word &quot;&quot; (&quot;petticoat&quot;), which the prostitutes of the town used to wear under their dresses. According to tradition, during Lent the prostitutes were sent to the other side of the Tormes River so that the men of the town were not distracted during the religious observances. On Easter Monday, the students of the town threw a party on the banks of the river to celebrate the return of the women, and ate hornazo as part of the celebration.

==Hornazo in other parts of Spain==
In other places in the country there are dishes similar to hornazo that contain hard-boiled eggs as a primary ingredient. In some parts of Spain a &quot;bollo de hornazo&quot; is a sweet and dry bread which is decorated with hard-boiled eggs. These dishes are also traditionally consumed in and around Easter. This may be because long ago, eggs were considered a sort of meat, and were therefore prohibited during Lent, a fact that did not stop the chickens from laying eggs. The eggs were preserved by hard-boiling them, and then used for cooking in dishes like hornazo. From this tradition it is probable that Easter eggs came into being, but their exact origins are unknown.

<text>Peak Rail is a preserved railway in Derbyshire, England, which operates a steam and heritage diesel service for tourists and visitors to both the Peak District and the Derbyshire Dales.

The preserved railway line is over in length and, , operates train services from Matlock station (shared with Derwent Valley Line services from Derby via Ambergate) via the site of Matlock Riverside and Darley Dale to Rowsley South.

Peak Rail intends to extend its operational services northward to when resources allow, extending to a total of 4¼ miles (6.8 km). Beyond Bakewell, the railway trackbed is used by the Monsal Trail.

== History ==

===First preservation attempts with the Buxton Steam Centre===

In 1975, the Peak Railway Preservation Society was established and opened a site at the now-closed Buxton Steam Centre with restoration facilities and a 300-yard operating line. Proposals were put forward to extend the operating line onto the single track freight line towards Peak Forest, but were not met with success. However, a bridge was purchased and installed over Charles Street to reconnect to British Rail&#x27;s Ashwood Dale route. The bridge was never used as the whole site was sold to Buxton Water who built a factory shortly after Peak Rail moved to Darley Dale using funds from the sale. The factory was demolished in 2011 and the site is vacant again and so available should Peak Rail ever reach Buxton.

The BBC reported in 2014 that the station site was proposed for redevelopment.

The &quot;Buxton Advertiser&quot; reported in June 2019 that Peak Rail intended to reoccupy the Buxton site and start a new Buxton Branch within two months with the first priority being to clear the site. The Peak Rail Association news quotes the support of the local MP however the builder of a new development is causing difficulties with access.

=== Closure of the Buxton Steam Centre and relocation to Darley Dale ===
In the 1980s, Peak Rail relocated its headquarters to Darley Dale and by 1991 the railway had reopened the section of line between and .

In 1997, the line was extended within a half-mile south of the Derbyshire village of Rowsley itself. A new station was constructed next to the site of the former loco shed at Rowsley South. The station was capable of holding long incoming charter trains and had a car park to accommodate a large number of cars and other vehicles. The station at Rowsley South has also been used for local charity events and cycle races, as well as steam and vintage vehicle rallies. 
With its location on the edge of the Peak District, the railway joins other attractions in the area, including Bakewell, Haddon Hall, Chatsworth House, the Rowsley shopping village, the village of Rowsley and the Cauldwell&#x27;s Mill museum.

===Extension to Matlock (Network Rail) station===
After the construction of the Matlock by-pass, and the new Sainsburys supermarket in the former Cawdor Quarry, a new track alignment and track layout was installed between Matlock Riverside and Matlock (Network Rail) station to provide a new connection to the national network.

Discussions regarding access to the Matlock down platform have resulted in an agreed 50-year lease, including the re-connection of the Network Rail and Peak Rail metals. The rails were originally disconnected due to a rearrangement of Network Rail track as a part of other redevelopments in the area south of the present Matlock Riverside station. The extension to Matlock re-opened on 2 July 2011.

==Future developments==

In 2004, Derbyshire County Council published a study which concluded that reopening the former line for a local service was technically feasible and that the track bed should remain clear of development, but it was not an economic possibility in the near future.

===Expansion towards Bakewell===
*Phase 1 would restore and re-lay track to the site of Rowsley station in Rowsley itself.
*Phase 2 would be reinstating a bridge over the A6 road joining up to Rowsley viaduct, along with restoration of both the viaduct and trackbed as far as a proposed Haddon Halt.
*Phase 3 would then be restoring both the old Haddon Tunnel and Coombes Road viaduct to former use before relaying track into the old station site and restoring the site to its former use.

Negotiations for the lease of the mile of trackbed to the north have resulted in the offer of a 99-year lease, from Rowsley South to Rowsley village. However, the extension is dependent on the required finance being raised or bequeathed.

===Monsal Trail===
Derbyshire County Council and the Peak Planning Board supported a scheme to develop the trackbed from Bakewell to Blackwell Mill as a cycle track, the Monsal Trail. With a stated aim to extend to Rowsley as part of the White Peak Loop Trail, the plans make no mention of the proposed railway extension beyond Rowsley village toward Bakewell.

== Signalling on the railway ==
There are four signal boxes on the route. Two boxes control the only two level crossings on the old Midland Railway main line route from Manchester to London St Pancras. The crossings are both in the Darley Dale area on the Peak Rail line. The third signal box at Rowsley is being commissioned to control the sidings and be a public viewing exhibit. This is the former Bamford signal cabin from the Hope Valley. There are plans at Rowsley South railway station for refurbishment and future operational use. The fourth cabin at Riverside came from Luffenham. It controls the Matlock connection to the national network.
*Matlock Riverside: an original British Rail cabin, formerly located at Luffenham junction. The restored cabin is mounted on a non prototypical stone-block base with an internal staircase to protect the box from vandalism, required due to its isolated location. The 19-lever frame was recovered from Glendon North Junction near Kettering. Mechanical interlocking allows the signals exiting and entering the loop via the Darley Dale end to be cleared in opposing directions when the cabin is switched out via the King locking lever.
*Darley Dale Crossing: controls the section from Darley Dale to Matlock Riverside under the one train staff key, as well as the other gated level crossing at Station Road. Based on an L.M.S. ground level design, it was erected in 2007 to replace the older Midland style replica cabin which had become life-expired.
*Darley Dale station: the passing loop at Darley Dale is worked using the Absolute Block method, with the signal box at the other end releasing the signal of the adjacent signal box to allow trains to enter the applicable up or down loop line. Due to the small length of the loop all signals are Home Starter combined signals, rather than the traditional separate distant, home and starter arrangements.

*Church Lane Crossing: controls the section from Darley Dale to Rowsley South under the electric key token block method, as well as the traditionally gated level crossing at Churchtown. Originally this signal box came from Gorsey Bank level crossing on the nearby Wirksworth branch. The signals here are Midland Railway lower quadrant examples on wooden posts dating from 1927. The signal box operates the first preserved example of a &quot;Josslock&quot; motor point, an electro-hydraulically worked electro-pneumatic point machine, whereby a standard electro-pneumatic point is driven by a hydraulic power pack.

*Rowsley South: The Cabin was originally located at before it was moved to the up platform at Darley Dale initially, though it was never commissioned. Eventually it was moved to Rowsley in January 2014, whereafter restoration began. It will be used to control the loco shed sidings and yard exits as a shunt frame using a unique now in the UK, though still widely used in Europe, double wire driven point operation using the ex Barrow Hill sidings turnover style lever frame kindly donated by the National Railway Museum and point operating gear which has now been installed at Rowsley.

===Two train running===
In late February 2007, the railway&#x27;s &#x27;Two-Train Running&#x27; project was completed and approved by HM Railway Inspectorate. Through improvements to infrastructure and signalling, this project allows &quot;two&quot; trains in steam on the line, using a refurbished and extended passing loop at . Each section of the railway is worked by a train staff, each with a key to operate the ground frames and electrical signal releases at the signal boxes and the ground frames at Rowsley South, Rowsley North, Darley South Yard sidings and Matlock Riverside.

== Darley Dale footbridge ==
In mid-2009, the original ex-Midland Railway Darley Dale footbridge was purchased from the Midland Railway - Butterley with an aim towards restoration and eventual repositioning at its original location at Darley Dale. Part of this project requires the removal of the unused signal box structure to facilitate the erection of the footbridge. Fundraising for this project began in late 2009 and continues.

== Operating groups at the railway ==

Several railway preservation groups are based at the railway, often working in support of and in co-operation with Peak Rail. These include:

*The Heritage Shunters Trust, which has a large collection of former British Railways and private company shunters.
*The now defunct Derbyshire Dales Narrow Gauge Railway, which operated narrow gauge trains over a short running line by the picnic ground at Rowsley. The track was lifted and stock sold between 2018 and 2019.
*The LMS Carriage Association, which restore examples of L.M.S and other coaching stock.
*The Renown Repulse Locomotive Group, responsible for the restoration of two former British Rail Class 50 locomotives.
*Andrew Briddon, who has several of his locomotives based upon the railway.
*Waterman Railway Heritage Trust which is setting up an engineering business at Rowsley to include apprenticeships
*Other locomotive and stock owners who are restoring wagons and stock upon the line

<text>Colonel the Right Honourable Sir Reginald Hugh Dorman-Smith, GBE, PC (10 March 1899 – 20 March 1977) was an Anglo-Irish diplomat, soldier and politician in the British Empire.

==Early life and politics==

Dorman-Smith was educated at Harrow School and the Royal Military College at Sandhurst. After serving in the army, he continued his career with a strong interest in agriculture, becoming president of the National Farmers Union (the NFU) at the age of 32, and then later Minister of Agriculture. He was first elected as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Petersfield in the 1935 general election as one of a handful of MPs sponsored by the NFU and served as the Union&#x27;s president for the following few years. As an MP, Dorman-Smith was a member of the English Mistery and its successor, English Array. English Mistery was a mystical &quot;back-to-the-land&quot; movement that sought to discover the &quot;lost secrets&quot; of the English as way as bringing about some sort of neo-feudal political and social order. In September 1938, Dorman-Smith spoke at the English Array&#x27;s annual rally held at Farleigh Wallop, urging that Britain not to go war with Germany over the Sudetenland crisis.Ý

In the late 1930s, the British Government&#x27;s agricultural policy came in for heavy criticism from the NFU, Parliament and the Press and in January 1939 Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain took the bold step of appointing Dorman-Smith as Minister of Agriculture. As benefitting a former president of the National Farmers Union, Dorman=Smith was very close to the farmers&#x27; lobby and represented their interests in the cabinet. In October 1939, Dorman-Smith instigated the Government&#x27;s Dig for Victory campaign, aimed at increasing food production from allotments. During the war, Dorman-Smith was opposed to the &quot;nutritional&quot; approach under which university-educated experts would instruct farmers in how to obtain maximum yields from their lands, saying in November 1939 &quot;once we fall into the nutrition trap we are sunk&quot;. In general, Dorman-Smith tended to champion traditional farming methods and was opposed to pasteurised milk under the grounds that British people had drunk unpasteurised milk for thousands of years, and he saw no reason for any change. In the winter of 1939–1940, Dorman-Smith had &quot;different conclusions&quot; about agriculture with the First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, who favored the scientific &quot;nutritional&quot; approach to farming. From Churchill&#x27;s viewpoint, increasing agricultural production would lessen the threat of an U-boat caused famine in Britain and free up shipping for other uses. When Chamberlain fell, Dorman-Smith was not included in the government of his successor, Winston Churchill.

Dorman-Smith was referred to in the book &quot;Guilty Men&quot; by Michael Foot, Frank Owen and Peter Howard (writing under the pseudonym &#x27;Cato&#x27;), published in 1940 as an attack on public figures for their failure to re-arm and their appeasement of Nazi Germany. Foot, Owen and Howard had singled out Dorman-Smith as one of the &quot;guilty men&quot;, blaming him for low agricultural productivity as a minister of agriculture at a time when the U-boat campaign threatened Britain with a famine. The British historian Andrew Marr wrote that Dorman-Smith was a &quot;bizarre target&quot; in &quot;Guilty Men&quot; as he was never very close to Chamberlain and was not particularly involved in Chamberlain&#x27;s foreign policy, and moreover had only joined the cabinet in January 1939 after the Munich Agreement.

==Governor of Burma==
===Arrival in Burma===
Dorman-Smith was appointed Governor of Burma from 6 May 1941 to 31 August 1946, and was therefore in office at the time of the Japanese invasion - and was expelled from the country by the Japanese. Burma was a turbulent colony as the Bamar had never really accepted the British conquest of Burma and the Great Depression by collapsing the price of rice had devastated Burma&#x27;s economy. The thesis beyond British rule in Burma was an implicit social contract under which the Burmese economy would grow in exchange for the acceptance of colonial rule; most Bamar took the viewpoint that the Great Depression had put a contract to the social contract, a viewpoint not shared by the British. The British historian Michael Leigh wrote: &quot;Dorman-Smith was complicated. Urbane, thoughtful, and fair, he was prepared to defend the underdog and could be intensely loyal to his friends...Perhaps he was not thick-skinned enough to be a great colonial administrator for he could be crippled by personal criticism and often grappled with a tender conscience. This rendered him indecisive and even self-delusional at times. He was neither a strong nor a weak leader, but his anxiety to do the right thing and to please people made him extremely vulnerable&quot;. 

In July 1941, Claire Lee Chennault arrived in Rangoon seeking transit rights to use the Burma Road for the American Volunteer Group (AVG), an ostensible group of mercenary pilots who had been hired by Chiang Kai-shek to provide China with an air force that was in fact a thinly disguised American intervention in the Sino-Japanese War. On 23 July 1941, Chennault met with Dorman-Smith who was highly supportive of the AVG and promised Chennault everything he asked for. Dorman-Smith gave Chennault permission to train his pilots in Burma before going on to China; to use the Burma Road to bring supplies for the AVG; the right to install guns on his aircraft and to conduct live-fire training in Burma; observation posts in Burma; and the right to use the remote Royal Air Force airfield at Toungoo. Chennault described Dorman-Smith as a man who was very sincere in wanting to help the AVG. On 26 July 1941, Dorman-Smith reported to the India &amp; Burma Office in London that he was &quot;anxious to meet Chenault&#x27;s wishes&quot; and he expected no opposition from the Burmese ministers. On 27 July 1941, Dorman-Smith&#x27;s agreement with Chennault was vetoed by Air Marshal Robert Brooke-Popham, the Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in the Far East who told Dorman-Smith that he exceeded his authority in giving Chennault permission to install guns on his airplanes and conduct gunnery exercises in Burma. Chennault went to Singapore to seek to change Brooke-Popham&#x27;s mind, but the matter was settled by a directive from the War Office on 30 July 1941 that ruled in favour of Brooke-Popham.. On 21 August 1941, Churchill intervened to rule in favour of Dorman-Smith. As the Burma Road was the only way by this point for Westerners to reach China, Dorman-Smith found himself entertaining a number of American visitors on their way to China. Clare Boothe Luce wrote in his diary that Dorman-Smith was the &quot;big, handsome, able, dark, young governor&quot;. 
Dorman-Smith had a strong liking for the Burmese prime minister, U Saw (like most Bamar, U Saw had only one name). He complained most of the Burmese politicians were corrupt, petty men who preached a highly chauvinistic version of Bamar nationalism. He especially disliked Ba Maw who had instigated bloody riots against the Indian minority in 1938, seeing him as a perfect example of the jingoistic Barmar nationalist. Dorman-Smith called U Saw a &quot;true patriot&quot; and a &quot;likeable rogue&quot; whose private army, the Galon, could be used for the defence of Burma. In October 1941, Dorman-Smith arranged for U Saw to go to London to discuss Dominion status for Burma with Leo Amery, the India Secretary, and Winston Churchill, the prime minister. The talks were inconclusive as Churchill met U Saw only once and while Amery told U Saw that nothing could be done about granting Burma Dominion status until after the war. On 7 December 1941, Japan attacked the British empire. On his way home in December 1941, U Saw stopped by the Japanese embassy in Lisbon to offer his support for Burma joining the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere. The British had broken the Japanese diplomatic code and were aware of U Saw&#x27;s offer, leading for Amery to send a telegram to Dorman-Smith saying that U Saw had just committed &quot;a treacherous act&quot; and was to be arrested immediately upon his return to Burma. U Saw was arrested upon his arrival in Rangoon and was exiled to Uganda for the rest of the war. 
===Invasion and evacuation===
The forces defending Burma were inadequate with the 17th Indian Division - which had been assigned to defend Burma - being considered one of the worse divisions in the British Indian Army. Despite the fact that Thailand had allowed Japanese forces transit rights, British planners had assumed wrongly that the jungles on the Burmese-Thai border were &quot;impenetrable&quot;, hence the decision to assign one Indian Army division and a particularly bad one at that to defend Burma. Burma had some of the most productive rice fields in Asia; was rich in oil, rubber and other raw materials; and the port of Rangoon was one of the largest ports in Asia which led the Japanese to make the conquest of Burma a priority. Furthermore, one of the central Japanese objectives to sever the Burma road which linked India to China, and by 1940 was the only route by which arms had reached China. The Japanese saw the conquest of Burma as the means to finally win the war against China which they had been fighting since 1937; by contrast British military planners in London did not seem to understand the Japanese obsession with severing the Burma Road and assumed the Japanese would not attempt an invasion of Burma from Thailand. Finally, reflecting the &quot;Germany First&quot; grand strategy, the Royal Air Force aircraft assigned to Burma were all obsolete, leading for the Japanese to have complete air superiority. Only the American Volunteer Group (AVG) under the command of General Claire Lee Chennault which on their way to China when the Japanese invaded were the only force capable of defending the skies above Burma as the AVG had modern aircraft, but even then the AVG was heavily outnumbered. On 23 December 1941 the Japanese bombed Rangoon for the first time and returned for a second time on 25 December 1941. At the sound of the air raid siren, Dorman-Smith retired to the air raid shelter under the Government House and stayed there until the all clear was given. Dorman-Smith went on to personally inspect the damage and reported that hundreds of people had been killed in the bombing. The second bombing raid did even more damage and set off dozens of fires all over Rangoon. Archibald Wavell had just arrived in Rangoon minutes before the second bombing raid started, and after greeted by Dorman-Smith at the Government House was forced to join him in the air raid shelter after the Japanese again bombed Rangoon. Dorman-Smith and his wife, Lady Dorman-Smith, were forced to spent Christmas Day and Boxing Day visiting hospitals to offer moral support for those injured by the Japanese bombing raids. The Dufferin Hospital was destroyed in the bombing raid, and the surviving patients had to be taken to Rangoon General Hospital, which itself was overfilled with bomb victims. Dorman-Smith complained that the doctors had all fled Rangoon and there were only three nurses to tend to the wounded. 

Burma was a highly multicultural and diverse colony. The business and commercial life of Burma was dominated by Indian and Chinese merchants who were extremely unpopular with the Bamar majority who resented the economic success of the Chinese and Indian merchants. The results of the 1941 census were destroyed by a Japanese bombing raid. The 1931 census, which survives, reported of the 14,647,497 people living in Burma, 1,017,825 were Indians. Virtually all of the doctors in Burma under British rule were Indians, which fueled resentment by the Bamar; even more damagingly was the fact that virtually of the policemen in British Burma were Indians, which led the Bamar to identity the entire Indian minority with British rule. When the Japanese invaded Burma in January 1942, the Indian merchants were the victims of attacks by the Bamar who looted their homes and stores while &quot;roughing up&quot; the Indians. Both the Chinese and Indian communities of Burma were convinced that the Bamar would massacre them all once the Japanese arrived, especially that they had already been anti-Indian and anti-Chinese pogroms in 1930 and 1938, stirred up by chauvinistic Bamar politicians who charged the Chinese and Indians were taking all of the middle class jobs at the expense of the Bamar majority. A delegation of the most wealthy Indian merchants visited Dorman-Smith to ask for his help in arranging protection for the Indian community, only to be told that there was little that could be done as most of the Indian policemen had deserted and fled back to India, leading to anarchy all over Burma. More out of fear of the Bamar than the Japanese, as the British retreated from Burma there was an exodus of the Indians in Burma into India. The flight of the Indians took place amid much suffering, and Indian newspapers frequently featured stories about the British authorities placing the evacuation of British families ahead of the Indians, and that the British colonial authorities were generally indifferent to the plight of the Indians. Such policies were the norm in the British colonies in Asia. The evacuation of Hong Kong in December 1941 was limited to those of &quot;purely British descent&quot; which excluded the Chinese population along with the Anglo-Chinese of Hong Kong and a similar policy was applied to Malaya and Singapore. In Burma, members of the Anglo-Indian and Anglo-Burmese communities found themselves excluded from the evacuation under the grounds that they not of &quot;purely British descent&quot;. The evacuation created much frustration within the Anglo-Burmese and Anglo-Indian communities who found themselves to be too much British for the Japanese and Bamar while being too Burmese and too Indian for the British colonial civil servants. The structure of Burma as a colony with in effect home rule proved to be a major complication as Dorman-Smith often stressed that he was no autocrat and instead had to deal with the Burmese prime minister, Sir Paw Tun, and the Burmese parliament. Paw Tun loyally supported the British war effort, but much of his cabinet along with the Burmese parliament did not. The Bamar considered the Indians and the Chinese to be &quot;foreigners&quot; and the Burmese parliament did not want to vote for money for their evacuation, and instead much preferred to vote money for building air raid shelters, which benefitted the Bamar. 

The bombing of Rangoon was deeply demoralising to people of Rangoon. The bombing of Rangoon started a mass flight out of Burma, which was to hamper the defense of Burma and caused much suffering. The Chinese community of Burma fled northwards towards China while the Indian community of Burma fled west towards India. At the port of Rangoon, thousands of Indians waited in huge lines for ships to take them to India, only to be told there was no barely any shipping available. Starting with the first bombing of Rangoon, a desperate competition to board any ships bound for India began with violence at the port becoming common as people pushed each other out of the lines, leading to frequent fights; touts sold tickets for any ship for India at immensely inflated prices; and bribery became rampant as the richer Indians sought to literally buy their way out of Burma at the expense of the poorer Indians. Making the competition even worse was divisions within the Indian community as Hindus and Muslims refused to travel together and within the Hindu community, the Brahmins and other higher caste Hindus refused to travel together with the untouchables and the other lower caste Hindus. So many Indians fled Rangoon in an attempt to walk out to India that the town of Prome soon had a vast open air refugee camp of least 20, 000 people sleeping outside. Sanitation did not exist in the &quot;ad hoc&quot; camp and soon cholera broke out. In early January 1942, Dorman-Smith visited Prome to ask the refugees to return to Rangoon, saying that with cholera raging it was unsafe for them to drink the water, and promised them they would be evacuated in an orderly fashion. On 14 January 1942, a civil servant, Robert Hutchings, told Dorman-Smith that there were about 40,000 Indians waiting impatiently at the port who were going to riot soon and that Dorman-Smith must tell the Royal Navy (which had taken control of the port) to allow at least some of the Indians to board ships. On 16 January 1942 after much lobbying by Dorman-Smith, the Royal Navy agreed that the Indians could sail as deck passengers on ships bound for India. During the invasion, relations between British civil and military officials in Burma were often strained, though Dorman-Smith had cordial relations with General Thomas Jacomb Hutton and General Archibald Wavell. Dorman-Smith appointed a &quot;civil defence expert&quot; to manage the refugee problem strained relations with the British officers who charged that the expert was ignorant, and many officers complained that massive columns of refugees on the roads hindered their ability to move troops and supplies forward to the front. On 20 January 1942, the Fifty-fifth Division of the Imperial Japanese Army based in Thailand invaded Burma and proved adept at using jungle trails to bypass the Indian troops. General Sir John Smyth, the GOC of the 17th Indian Division, thought that the Japanese would aim for Rangoon and stationed most of his forces in southern Burma; in fact, the Japanese were more concerned with severing the Burma Road and invaded northern Burma, which caught the British off-balance. Dorman-Smith came to serve as a scapegoat for all of the failures of British policy in Burma in 1942, with the journalists blaming him for the loss of Burma. Leigh wrote that Dorman-Smith meant well, but that he conflated the need to build air-raid shelters with the need to evacuate a million plus people to India and assigned both tasks to a relatively young man, De Graaf Hunter, as Civil Defense Commissioner who to focus on building air-raid shelters at the expense of evacuation.

Outside of the Government House, the residence of the Governor of Burma, thousands of Indians gathered outside looking for his help in fleeing Burma. Dorman-Smith told the Indians that he would do his best to arrange for their safe return to India, but was faced with a bureaucracy that constantly sabotaged his orders to do more to help the Indians. On 17 February 1942, Dorman-Smith sent his two teenage daughters, Patti and Jacqueline, out on one of the last trans to Calcutta. Every time, the train stopped, it was besieged by thousands of desperate Indians who attempted to clamor abroad, only to be beaten off. As most of the policemen had deserted their posts, crime reached unprecedented heights in Burma and the Indian and the Chinese merchants who the victims of the most serious looting complained that Dorman-Smith was slow in proclaiming martial law. The most serious and the dangerous of the looters were gangs whom the British and Indians alike referred to &quot;dacoits&quot; after the bandits that plagued the Indian countryside. Despite their name, the &quot;dacoits&quot; in Rangoon were mostly Bamar from the Rangoon underworld. Dorman-Smith argued that proclaiming martial law would tie down soldiers who could be used for the defense of Burma and that the police were more familiar with conditions in Burma than the Anglo-Indian forces committed to defending Burma, but finally was forced to proclaim martial law on 20 February 1942 to put a stop to the looting. The soldiers of the Gloucestershire Regiment, were deployed as a &quot;ad hoc&quot; police force with orders to shoot-on-sight any looters. From his window of the Government House, Dorman-Smith was confronted with an apocalyptic scene as the skyline was blackened with smoke caused by the fires started by the Japanese bombing raids; sirens wailed as ambulances to pick up the wounded; and the sound of gunfire was heard as the Gloucestershire regiment fought with the dacoits. Dorman-Smith wrote: &quot;It is no ordinary affair to be compelled to decide whether or not to cede to the enemy a capital city of an Empire-country and to destroy much of what went to make it a great and important city. For us it was a ghastly day&quot;. On 11:30 am on 20 February, he told his wife to that is time for her to leave Rangoon, and at about 3: 00 pm, she left the city in the Governor&#x27;s Rolls Royce. She described leaving a city ruined by fire and looting, full of burned-out buildings and streets covered with debris. On the same time, the news broke that 1, 300 criminals and &quot;lunatics&quot; had released from the jails and insane asylums of Rangoon, which was often used to attack Dorman-Smith as incompetent. He blamed &quot;sensation-hunting journalists&quot; for such unflattening stories as &quot;Convicts are loose and lunatics too&quot;. Dorman-Smith defended the releases, which had been ordered by Burma civil servant, J. Fielding-Hall, who argued that it was inhumane to keep people locked up while being impossible to provide them with food and water. Fielding-Hall ordered the release of the most &quot;harmless lunatics&quot; to their families under the grounds that they would die of starvation and/or dehydration while also ordering the release of a number of petty criminals under the grounds it would be impossible to move them to Mandalay. Inspired by the stories of the mentally ill and criminals being released, entirely spurious stories of that the animals from the Rangoon zoon were being allowed to wander about the streets appeared, which contributed to Dorman-Smith&#x27;s image of a governor who had lost control of his colony. 

On 23 February 1942, the last merchant ship bound for India, the SS &quot;Jalligopal&quot; left Rangoon harbour. The &quot;Jalligopal&quot; left Rangoon without 500 Indian nurses and hospital staff who stayed at their posts because of a promise from the Burma civil servant, J.S. Vorley, that the British would take back them to India. Vorley told Dorman-Smith it was dishonorable to leave these people behind, and he agreed with him, giving orders to the Royal Navy commodore in charge of the port to find any ship to take them to India. After much argument, Dorman-Smith was able to have 300 of Vorley&#x27;s hospital staff boarded onto a warship while the remaining 200 were put abroad one of the last trains to India. Dorman-Smith described the port of Rangoon as being a hellishly chaotic scene with thousands of desperate Indians pressing forward to board any ship that was leaving the port; there was much looting of the warehouses next to the port; drunken sailors were &quot;rolling, staggering, some crawling, some flat out dead drunk&quot;; and people were shooting up in the air with the guns they had looted from the warehouses. When the last ship left the port, the Indian refugees charged forward in an attempt to board the ship, leaving for the crew to cut the ropes and let the gangway crash into the sea. Dorman-Smith later estimated that between 20 January-23 February 1942 about 25, 000 people were evacuated via the sea from Rangoon. The closure of the port of Rangoon due to the danger of Japanese air and naval attacks was a huge blow to Burma&#x27;s economy. Dorman-Smith later calculated that the closing the port of Rangoon had meant that 3 million tons of rice, 300, 000 tons of teak, 6, 400 tons of tin, 5, 400 tons of wolfram; 1 million tons of oil, and 1, 500 tons of rubber would not exported out of Burma that year. 

Thousands of Indians died of heat exhaustion, starvation, disease or were killed by Bamar gangs while trying to walk though what were called Burma&#x27;s &quot;jungles of death&quot; to reach the safety of India. Dorman-Smith came to face much criticism for the massive numbers of Indians who died while attempting to escape Burma. American newspaper correspondents covering the war in Burma were less bound by British censorship and were especially vocal in condemning Dorman-Smith for the mismanagement of the campaign and of the evacuation of the Indians. The war correspondent Leland Stowe of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; was one of Dorman-Smith&#x27;s most vociferous critics, whom he had lacerated in his articles as a bumbling buffoon hopelessly out of touch with reality, and gave him the unflattening nickname of &quot;Doormat-Smith&quot;. Much of the rage of the American war correspondents and to lesser extent the British war correspondents as well was due to Dorman-Smith&#x27;s tendency to put the most positive gloss on the news, which was sharply contradicted by the fact it was clear that the Japanese were winning in Burma. Dorman-Smith disliked the war correspondents, whom he called &quot;vultures&quot; who made their living by presenting the horrors of the war in Burma to the public in the United Kingdom and the United States, which made for adversarial relationship between the governor and the war correspondents. 

As Governor, Dorman-Smith was forced to join the retreat out of Burma. Dorman-Smith wrote in the third person when he heard of the fall of Singapore in February 1942 that his &quot;Mistery training stood him in good stead throughout the crisis and gave him the strength to carry on&quot;. On 1 March 1942, Dorman-Smith and his family fled the Government House in Rangoon to escape the advancing Japanese, and thereafter lived on the run on what Dorman-Smith called the &quot;inglorious retreat&quot; from Burma. Dorman-Smith later wrote that most people in Britain did not understand what it felt to be invaded, and that &quot;only those who been the victims of an invasion can realise what it means to have a rutheless enemy ever pressing forward&quot;. On 1 March 1942, Dorman-Smith left the Government House in the early morning and flew out to Magwe. In March 1942, Dorman-Smith greeted General Che&#x27;en, the GOC of the Chinese 55th Division which had sent to help keep the Burma Road open. The stories that appeared in the Indian newspapers about the British colonial authorities putting the evacuation of British civilians from Burma ahead of Indian civilians, and that thousands of Indians had died while trying to walk out of Burma caused a firestorm of criticism in India. Much of the coverage was based upon reality. The British population of Burma had tried as much as possible to segregate themselves from &quot;the natives&quot; before the war and even in the emergency of 1942 refused any kind of shared accommodation with the Indian community, insisting the buses, lorries, ships and aeroplanes that were to take them to India not have any Indians abroad. On 30 March 1942, Dorman-Smith wrote a letter to Cordell Hull, the American Secretary of State, asking for American aircraft to fly out the 70, 000 Indian refugees who had arrived Mandalay, many of whom he noted were women, old people and children who would probably die if they tried to walk out to India. In response, he received a letter from Hull on 6 April telling them that starting on 16 April the U.S. Army Air Corps would make available five or six planes to fly out the refugees and promised that a total of 75 planes would be available by October 1942, which Dorman-Smith noted was too little, too late. As he retreated into Upper Burma, Dorman-Smith felt much guilt about the sufferings of the Indian refugees and often promised to stay until all of the Indians were evacuated. He finally arrived in Myitkyina, a city where he became lost in what he called &quot;outer darkness&quot;, which was his term for depression. 

On 30 April 1942, Dorman-Smith sent a telegram to Churchill asking him &quot;to scrounge up a few more aeroplanes&quot; to fly him and his family out of the jungle in Burma where they were staying to the safety of India. On 1 May 1942, Dorman-Smith received a telegram from the India Secretary, Leo Amery, saying that the &quot;News Chronicle&quot; had run a story saying the British colonial authorities had prevented Indians from boarding flights out of Burma and refused to allow Indian refugees to cross into India. Amery was due to face hostile questions about the &quot;News Chronicle&quot; story in the House of Commons on 7 May 1942, and he demanded Dorman-Smith either confirm or rebut the story. As Dorman-Smith was in the jungle with no records waiting impatiently to be flown out of Burma, he send Amery a rambling telegram noted for its grammatical errors that did not answer his questions. General Harold Alexander, the GOC of the British forces in Burma asked that Dorman-Smith leave Burma at once before he captured by the Japanese as he stated he did not want the governor&#x27;s capture &quot;to add to my anxieties&quot;. 

Dorman-Smith&#x27;s mood swung erratically from one option to another on a hourly basis as he declared he would stay in Burma until the Indians were evacuated; demanded that a plane be sent to fly him out; or that would walk out of Burma via the Hukawng Valley as a way of showing support for the Indians who walked out via the same route. Amery told him that walking out was a &quot;crackpot&quot; idea and Dorman-Smith was forced to concede the Hukawng Valley was &quot;no route for obese governors&quot;. Finally, Dorman-Smith decided to &quot;clear out by air&quot;, but expressed concern that he &quot;took up a seat that could be used by a refugee&quot;. On 2 May 1942, he telegrammed Amery asking that for &quot;a Blenheim [bomber] in India which be used&quot; to allow him to escape. He seemed not to understand reserving an entire bomber to fly him might look worse than taking up a seat for a refugee. Dorman-Smith spent all of 3 May 1942 in Myitkyina waiting anxiously amid a tropical downpour while being assailed by mosquitos for an airplane to arrive to pick him up, saying he felt &quot;thoroughly trapped&quot; as no plane arrived and he was resigned to &quot;capture by the Japanese&quot; as the Imperial Japanese Army continued it&#x27;s advance to Myitkyina. Very late on the evening of 3 May, what Dorman-Smith called &quot;two RAF types&quot; knocked on his door to tell him that they had been sent to fly him to India. The officers had with them a letter from Churchill telling him that he was to leave Burma at once as there was nothing for him to do and &quot;the above is to taken as an order&quot;. Sir Shenton Thomas, the governor of the Straits Settlements, had been captured by the Japanese when Singapore fell on 15 February 1942 and had been paraded through the streets of Singapore as a prisoner as a way to show the power of Japan; Churchill was determined to prevent another British governor in Asia from being humiliated in the same way, telling Dorman-Smith that he did not want to see him paraded through the streets of Rangoon as a Japanese prisoner. Dorman-Smith wrote he could &quot;not bear the thought of getting out myself and leaving thousands of Burmans, Anglo-Indians and Indians to the tender mercies of the Japanese&quot;.

On 4 May 1942, the first anniversary of Dorman-Smith being sworn in as Governor of Burma in 1941, Dorman-Smith boarded a Blenheim bomber that flew him to India. On 9 May 1942, Amery sent another telegram to Dorman-Smith demanding answers to four &quot;simple questions&quot;, namely what arrangements had Dorman-Smith made for the evacuation of the Indians from Burma; how many Indians had been evacuated since January; how were the Indians treated in the refugee camps along the India-Burma border; and what had happened to the Indian refugees who walked along the Tamu route to India? Dorman-Smith did not answer this telegram, and instead the Viceroy of India, Lord Linlithgow replied on his behalf, to say that 40,000 Indian refugees had been received since January. In his hideaway in the Burmese jungle, Dorman-Smith was haunted by a sense of guilt over the chaotic and badly managed evacuation of Burma. In 1942, it is estimated that about 600, 000 people fled Burma to India and about 80, 000 of them died in the &quot;jungles of death&quot;, mostly of starvation and/or disease.

===Governor-in-exile===

Between May 1942 and Oct 1945, he was in exile at Simla, India. His reputation was badly damaged by a bestselling book in the United States, &quot;A Million Died: A Story of the War in the Far East&quot; by the American journalist Alfred Wagg, that had been published in the Autumn of 1942 that blamed Dorman-Smith for the botched evacuation from Burma. Wagg had covered the campaign in Burma in 1942 and was outraged by the sight of so many Indians dying while trying to walk through the &quot;jungles of death&quot;. Wagg came to have a deep hatred of Dorman-Smith, whom he personally held responsible for fall of Burma along with the suffering of the Indians the &quot;jungles of death&quot;. Dorman-Smith was sympathetic to Bamar nationalists and looked forward to the day when Burma would be granted Dominion status to join the British Commonwealth. The Burmese politicians he chose to work in exile in Simla tended to the more moderate Bamar nationalists who saw Britain as a possible ally who help Burma after the war. The Bamar had a deep suspicion of China, whom they regarded as an overbearing neighbour, and some of the Bamar politicians saw Britain as an ally. Tin Tut wrote to Dorman-Smith in April 1943 that after the war it was clear: &quot;that Burma will need a powerful friend and where better can she find one than in an England who will prove her generosity and disinterestedness by the grant of Dominion Status?&quot;

In April 1943 Dorman-Smith together with Amery met with Churchill to discuss the post-war future of Burma. Churchill committed himself to the restoration of British rule together with a promise of aid to rebuild Burma, but refused to make further commitments such as Dominion status for Burma, claiming that the time was not right. Both Amery and Dorman-Smith believed that for Churchill the time would never be right and he intended Burma to be a British colony forever. On 1 July 1943, Dorman-Smith wrote to Amery: &quot;I can not help thinking that it would be a bad thing politically actually to do away with the office of Governor of Burma, if only because it would be a welcome propaganda point for the Japanese who would doubtless use it to demonstrate
either that we have given up all hopes of retaking Burma or that we visualise setting up a Military Government in Burma.&quot; In July 1943, Amery recalled Dorman-Smith to London for more meetings on the future of Burma. On 12 July 1943, Dorman-Smith wrote to Lord Linlithgow: &quot;This home visit does not fill me with any great joy though it may serve the useful purpose of clarifying things a bit. But I am forced to wonder whether the position of a Governor without a country, whose country anyway has declared war on us does not in fact completely beggar clarification.&quot; Churchill was enraged by a speech Dorman-Smith had given in New Delhi where he said: &quot;Burma belonged to the Burmese, and when the time came for full self-government, &#x27;we must try to hand over the country for which we have done a good job of work!&quot; Churchill wrote about Dorman-Smith&#x27;s speech to Amery: &quot;He seems to have been talking a lot of nonsense about our handing over Burma, etc. Let me have a full report of the speech.&quot; For his part, Paw Tun, the leader of the Burmese government-in-exile wrote to Dorman-Smith asking to press Churchill for a promise of independence, saying the recent statements about restoring Burma as a colony would &quot;create a deep sense of despair&quot; among the Bamar people. Paw Tun observed that the Japanese had created a puppet Burmese state headed by Ba Maw, and that many Bamar would conclude that the Japanese empire offered the Burmese more than the British empire. Tin Tut, another pro-British Burmese politician in exile in India, wrote to Dorman-Smith that most Burmese could see the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere was a sham, but wanted the British to make a firm promise of independence after the victory over Japan. Tin Tut noted that President Franklin D. Roosevelt had given a firm promise that the United States would grant independence to the Philippines after the defeat of Japan, and wanted Churchill to make a similar promise for Burma. In October 1943, Dorman-Smith made a speech in London before the East Indian Association. His speech lamented the fact that while the British had talked for years about self-government and reform in Asia, they had delivered very little of it which had damaged their credibility. He said:

&quot;Neither our word nor our intentions are trusted in that part of the globe ... We have fed such countries as Burma on political formulae until they are sick at the very sight and sound of a formula, which has come, as far as my experience shows, to be looked upon as a very British means of avoiding a definite course of action.&quot;

The speech said that pre-war British policy on these subjects was discredited and a new credible approach was required after the war. In March 1944, Dorman-Smith compared the Bamar to the Irish, writing that like the Irish the Bamar are &quot;&quot;a romantic people, fed from childhood on the pristine greatness of their country; superstitious...and very gullible but being mostly a nation of peasants they have the cunning and shrewdness of the eternal peasant...The honesty of their politicians and minor officials may be open to question but I have seen too much of the ways of politicians and officials in other countries to be over-shocked by such petty graft as went on in Burma.&quot; Extending his comparison, Dorman-Smith wrote that Burma had been conquered by the British in 1885 and the Bamar had never accepted British rule, writing &quot;the fact is that they never really accepted our rule any more than the Irish accepted it...they never ceased to be ardent and active nationalists.&quot; Dorman-Smith noted that Burma had been a major power in Southeast Asia for centuries before the British arrived, and that because Burma had been annexed to the British empire in 1885, the older Bamar could remember when Burma was still independent, making for a difficult relationship between the British rulers and the Bamar ruled. He concluded the reason why the Bamar welcomed the Japanese as liberators in 1942 was because the British had lied to the Bamar too many times about possible independence, writing &quot;we signally failed to rouse their enthusiasm for our cause&quot;. Dorman-Smith was resolutely opposed to making any sort of deal with the Bamar ultra-nationalists who served as Japanese collaborators, and dismissed the Burma Independence Army formed by the Japanese as the &quot;Burma Traitor Army&quot;. Likewise, Dorman-Smith favored having an independent Burma being a federation under the account that Burma had sizable minority groups such as the Shan, the Karen, the Chin, the Mon, the Karenni, the Kachin, the Mon, and so forth who would not welcome an unitary state dominated by the Bamar. By contrast, Admiral Louis Mountbatten, the GOC of Southeast Asia Command, was more open to making a deal with General Aung San who by 1944 was complaining that the Japanese treated the Bamar worse than the British and that he was prepared to defect with his army. 

Major-General Sir Hubert Rance, the British military commander, took control of the country for the military after the liberation of Rangoon, but Dorman-Smith returned as governor in 1945. On 16 October 1945, Dorman-Smith sailed into Rangoon abroad the cruiser HMS &quot;Cleopatra&quot; to resume his duties as governor. There were no cheering crowds and Dorman-Smith and his wife found a city badly damaged by the war and a sullen population that did not welcome their return. Dorman-Smith made a tour of Burma while Lady Dorman-Smith was occupied with various social events as visiting orphanages and hospitals. The people whom attended parties hosted by the Dorman-Smiths at the Government House tended to be people outside of Burma as few Burmese wanted to associate with them. Dorman-Smith much to his discomfort discovered for the Bamar the hero of the hour was General Aung San who first fought for the Japanese before defecting and fighting for the British. Aung San made it clear to Dorman-Smith he only supported the British to expel the Japanese from Burma, and now that Japan was defeated, he expected the British to leave Burma as soon as possible, making a great show of being rude to the governor to emphasise that he wanted to see Dorman-Smith gone. Dorman-Smith found himself out of favor with everyone as the new Labour government did not trust him; Churchill regarded him as a &quot;liability&quot;; Aung San saw him as an enemy; the British media were hostile towards him; and the returning Indians blamed him for the botched evacuation of 1942. Dorman-Smith considered arresting Aung San for a murder he committed in 1942. In that year, Aung San had stabbed the restrained headman of Thebyugone village to death in front of a large crowd. Dorman-Smith was convinced by his superiors not to carry out the arrest.

While Dorman-Smith was back in the UK for medical reasons, he was replaced by Rance, who was supported by Lord Mountbatten of Burma and fully backed a policy of immediate unconditional independence for Burma under the leadership of the AFPFL. In June 1946, Dorman-Smith returned to his house in the village of Stodham in the Hampshire countryside for rest and relaxation. On 3 August 1946, he learned that he would not be returning to Burma as the prime minister Clement Attlee had decided to replace him with Rance. Lady Dorman-Smith wrote in her diary &quot;it was a mean way to treat Reg&quot; with Attlee and Moutbatten discussing the merits of replacing Dorman-Smith with Rance for weeks without anyone telling Dorman-Smith he was considered a failure as governor. One British Army public relations officer stated that Dorman-Smith was the victim of intrigue as senior officers who had &quot;decided to use Dorman-Smith as a scapegoat for the collapse of Burma in 1942...so as to divert attention from the Army&#x27;s failures&quot;.

==Simla Conference 1944==

As the Governor of Burma, Sir Reginald Dorman-Smith met with Anglo-Burmese leaders in Simla in 1944, to discuss the future of the Anglo-Burmese community after the war.

The Anglo-Burmese delegates were:

*Mr. G. Kirkham
*Mr. H.J. Mitchell B.Fr.S.
*Mr. J. Barrington I.C.S.
*Mr. K.W. Foster B.C.S.
*Mr. E.A. Franklin I.C.S
*Mr. W.A. Gibson
*Mrs. K. Russell
*Mr. H. Elliott
*Mr. C.H. Campagnac
*Mr. J.A. Wiseham
*Mr. J.F. Blake

One result of the conference was an assurance to the Anglo-Burmese community that they would be allowed to preserve their freedom of worship and allowed to teach their own religion, freedom to continue their own customs, and maintain their own language of English.

After leaving Burma, Dorman-Smith continued to take an interest in its affairs. He believed that if London had not intervened, he could have influenced the course of events in Burma so as to prevent the country from leaving the British Commonwealth.

==Family==

Dorman-Smith was born to a Protestant Anglo-Irish father and an Irish Catholic mother at Bellamont House, Cootehill, County Cavan, Ireland, and was educated at Harrow and Sandhurst. He served briefly in the British Indian Army before being invalided out, then joined a volunteer battalion of the Queen&#x27;s Royal Regiment.

One of Dorman-Smith&#x27;s two brothers, Eric Dorman-Smith, was a major-general in the British Army in the Second World War. After falling out with the British establishment, he became an Irish republican sympathiser and changed his name to Eric Dorman O&#x27;Gowan. His other brother, Victor Dorman-Smith, was a Royal Navy captain who served as a member of Combined Operations HQ during World War One.

His daughter Patricia married the novelist Gwyn Griffin in 1950.

<text>The University of the West Indies (UWI), originally University College of the West Indies, is a public university system established to serve the higher education needs of the residents of 18 English-speaking countries and territories in the Caribbean: Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, The Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Montserrat, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago, and Turks and Caicos Islands.
Each country is either a member of the Commonwealth of Nations or a British Overseas Territory. 

The university has five major university centres: UWI Mona, (Jamaica), UWI Cave Hill (Barbados), UWI St. Augustine (Trinidad and Tobago), UWI Five Islands (Antigua and Barbuda), and the regional UWI Global Campus in the UWI-funding Caribbean nations. The UWI campus in Mona, Jamaica, serves as the headquarters of the University of the West Indies. 

The aim of the university is to help &quot;unlock the potential for economic and cultural growth&quot; in the West Indies, thus allowing improved regional autonomy. The university was originally instituted as an independent external college of the University of London.

== History ==

The university was founded in 1948, on the recommendation of the Asquith Commission through its sub-committee on the West Indies, chaired by Sir James Irvine. The Asquith Commission had been established in 1943 to review the provision of higher education in the British colonies. Initially in a special relationship with the University of London, the then University College of the West Indies (UCWI) was seated at Mona, about five miles from Kingston, Jamaica. The university was based at Gibraltar Camp, used by evacuated Gibraltarians during the war.

Seeking to address a need for medical care, the first faculty established a medical school. The foundation stone for a hospital was added in 1949, and the University College Hospital of the West Indies opened in 1953. On 18 January 1953, Sir Winston Churchill visited the hospital and unveiled a plaque in recognition of the contribution made by the government of the United Kingdom to the hospital. The hospital was renamed the University Hospital of the West Indies in 1967 when the university gained full university status. In addition to patient care, the hospital facilitates research and teaching, along with the Medical Services department of the Mona campus of the University of the West Indies.

The University College achieved independent university status in 1962. The St. Augustine Campus in Trinidad, formerly the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture (ICTA), was established in 1960, followed by a school established along University Row, at the Deep Water Harbour of Barbados in 1963, later seated at the present Cave Hill Campus in 1967. The Open Campus, University Centres, headed by a Resident Tutor, were established in each of the other 13 contributing territories thereafter.

In 1950, Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone, Queen Victoria&#x27;s last surviving granddaughter, became the first Chancellor of the University College of the West Indies.

Sir William Arthur Lewis was the first Vice-Chancellor under the UWI&#x27;s independent Charter. A native of St Lucia, he served as the first West Indian Principal of the UCWI from 1958 to 1960 and as Vice-Chancellor from 1960 to 1963. He was succeeded by Sir Philip Sherlock (a Jamaican and one of UWI&#x27;s founding fathers) who served as Vice-Chancellor from 1963 to 1969. Sir Roy Marshall, a Barbadian, was the next Vice-Chancellor, serving from 1969 to 1974. He was succeeded in that year by Aston Zachariah Preston, a Jamaican, who died in office on 24 June 1986. The fifth Vice-Chancellor was Sir Alister McIntyre, who served from 1988 to 1998, followed by alumnus and Professor Emeritus Rex Nettleford, who served from 1998 to 2004. The current Vice-Chancellor is Professor Sir Hilary Beckles, who succeeded Professor E. Nigel Harris in May 2015.

The University of the West Indies Museum catalogues and exhibits some of the university&#x27;s history.

== University of the West Indies system ==
The UWI is the largest, longest-serving education provider in the Commonwealth Caribbean, with five constituent campuses:

The following are the satellite campuses of the university system:
* Mount Hope Campus in Mount Hope, Trinidad and Tobago (houses the Faculty of Medical Sciences of UWI St. Augustine)
* St. Augustine South Campus at Debe in the Penal–Debe region, Trinidad and Tobago (extension campus of UWI St. Augustine)
* Western Jamaica Campus in Montego Bay, Jamaica (extension campus of UWI Mona)
* Centre for Hotel and Tourism Management in Nassau, Bahamas (extension campus of UWI Mona)
* School of Clinical Medicine and Research in Nassau, Bahamas (extension of the medical programme at UWI St. Augustine)

The other contributing countries are served by the Open Campus.

=== Proposed additions ===
There have been various proposals to add one or more campuses in other nations, including a campus at Hope, Grenada or even Suzhou, China.

=== Articulation and franchised programmes ===
In addition to programmes offered directly by one of the faculties of the university, the UWI extends accessibility to its programmes through articulation agreements and franchise arrangements with regional institutions. In many of these arrangements, students are able to study in their home countries for the first one or two years before going to a landed campus for the third (and fourth) year. In the case of articulation agreements, the local institution develops its own programme and the UWI agrees to recognise it as equivalent to the first year or two of a specific UWI programme. In the case of a franchise programme, the local institution delivers exactly the programme as offered by UWI. This is usually the first year or two, but can be the full bachelor&#x27;s degree on occasion.

== Global initiatives ==
The University of the West Indies has initiated several international partnerships. In 2016, UWI and the Global Institute for Software Technology (GIST) established the UWI-China Institute for Information Technology. Starting in the summer of 2018, students in the programme on the Cave Hill and Mona campuses will travel to Suzhou, China for two years to study software engineering and Mandarin.

The UWI-SUNY Center for Leadership and Sustainable Development (CLSD) was established in 2017 on SUNY&#x27;s Empire State campus in Manhattan.
The centre is designed to assist the Commonwealth Caribbean in meeting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. In addition to research and advocacy, plans were underway as of 2019 to offer a joint master&#x27;s degree in sustainability and leadership.&lt;ref name=&quot;VCAR2016/2017&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the University of Lagos (UNILAG) and the UWI established the UNILAG-UWI Institute of African and Diaspora Studies. The institute conducts research and offers a master&#x27;s degree in African and Diaspora Studies.

Also in 2017, UWI and the University of Johannesburg (UJ) signed a memorandum of agreement (MoA) to establish the Institute for Global Africa Affairs. The institute was launched in 2018 and will offer a joint master&#x27;s degree in Global African Studies.

In 2020, UWI and the University of Havana inked an agreement to jointly establish the Institute for the Sustainable Development of the Caribbean. UWI Mona will lead the initiative from the UWI side, with the deans of the Faculty of Science and Technology and the dean of the Faculty of Medical Sciences taking the lead.

In 2021 the Inter-American Development Bank decided to become a stakeholder of UWI under Cuban-American President Mauricio Claver-Carone as a public-private partnerships, [PPP).

== Faculties ==
The University of the West Indies is a multi-campus, international university with several faculties and schools, some of which are replicated on all four physical main campuses. The Open Campus does not have a faculty structure. The distribution of the faculties (called schools at Five Islands) is listed below.

A new Faculty of Culture, Creative and Performing Arts was approved to be established on 1 August 2020 at the Cave Hill Campus.

=== Faculty of Medical Sciences ===
Prior to the establishment of a medical school in the Caribbean, most doctors were trained in the United Kingdom, with a smaller group trained in the United States. This was costly, not attuned to the specific needs of the communities the doctors would serve, and risked the trained doctors remaining in their countries of training.

The Faculty of Medical Sciences was the first faculty to be established in the then University College. This was because of the pressing need for more (locally trained) doctors to treat conditions such as tuberculosis, yaws, tetanus, typhoid, infant malnutrition and illnesses related to diarrhea. The establishment of medical schools in the colonies was replicated in the Gold Coast, Nigeria, Rhodesia and Uganda. The inaugural entering class in 1948 consisted of 33 students from across the Caribbean, selected from more than 600 or almost 800 applicants. As the university college was then affiliated with the University of London, the curriculum reflected University of London&#x27;s curriculum, with the addition of preventative and tropical medicine. Degrees were awarded under the University of London name until 1962, reflective of the role the university played in administering the programme and providing the teaching staff. In addition to the standard five-year course, a pre-course science year was required for students without adequate preparation in that area. The University Hospital of the West Indies, an acute tertiary hospital, provided the initial context for clinical education.

Expansion of the capacity of the Faculty followed several steps. In addition to population growth, the exodus of medical graduates to North America, never to return, exacerbated the need to increase the output of doctors. In the 1960s, it was possible to complete the clinical clerkship element of training in Trinidad and Tobago (at the Port of Spain General Hospital) and in Barbados (at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital), as well as in Jamaica. In 1989, the medical school at the St. Augustine campus opened. However, rather than adopt the &#x27;traditional&#x27; existing curriculum at the Mona school, it adopted a problem-based approach. Mona, which had already carried out some curricular reform due to World Health Organization recommendations to place greater emphasis on community health promotion and protection, and St. Augustine, had different medical school curricula, though the graduates took the same qualifying exams. Moreover, St. Augustine&#x27;s Faculty of Medical Sciences included not just a School of Medicine, but also Schools of Dentistry, Veterinarian Medicine, Nursing and Pharmacy, which necessitated some sharing of resources. In 2008, the clerkships in Barbados were fully developed into a medical school at the Cave Hill campus. Around the same time, the UWI School of Clinical Medicine and Research was established from an existing programme allowing clerkships to be undertaken in Nassau, under the direction of the St. Augustine campus. The School offers the final two years of the five-year programme.

==== Specialist medical training ====
Similar to the general training, specialist training was progressively made available through the UWI. For example, anaesthesia was initially provided by untrained doctors, nurses, and pharmacists, leading to high morbidity and mortality rates. Initially, doctors were sent overseas for a year of post-graduate training. While the Faculty was established in 1948, the one-year post-graduate diploma in anaesthetics did not begin until 1966 at the Mona Campus. St. Augustine and Cave Hill added the diploma in 1976. However, Mona was already moving towards a four-year Doctor of Medicine Anaesthetics degree, first offered in 1974. Eventually, this more specialised degree (extended to include &quot;intensive care&quot;) was extended to the other two campuses in 1984 while the one-year programme was discontinued in 1994.

While improvements were being made to the training of physicians as anaesthesiologists, there continued to be a shortage of trained personnel in rural areas. In Jamaica, an initiative to train nurse anaesthetists started, with nurses first sent to the US and to Cuba, followed by the establishment of the Jamaica School of Nurse Anaesthetists in 1981, which continues to this day (2019) with the Ministry of Health. This is in addition to specialised additional training for nurses in intensive care which began in 1969.

==== Dentist training ====
Two of the three faculties of medical sciences offer dentistry. The St. Augustine campus was the first to offer a dental school. It opened in 1989, the first dental school in the anglophone Caribbean. The inaugural class of roughly 20 students was mostly from Trinidad and Tobago, with a couple of students each from Jamaica and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. The initial curriculum was modeled on that found in the UK, with the intention to seek recognition from British authorities. It is possible to the exam for membership of the Faculty of Dental Surgery of the Edinburgh-based Royal College of Surgeons.

==== Accreditation ====
Starting in 2004, the medical programmes in the Caribbean ceased to be accredited by the United Kingdom-based General Medical Council, as the UK re-focussed more on integration with Europe. UWI was a key player in the establishment of the Caribbean Accreditation Authority for Education in Medicine and other Health Professions (CAAM-HP). The three UWI medical schools are accredited together, despite differences in curriculum, and are currently accredited with conditions. The dental school at St. Augustine is probationary accredited while the dental school at Mona has accreditation with conditions. The veterinarian medical school at St. Augustine is also accredited with conditions. Efforts are underway to align the curriculum and admission standards of the three medical schools.

==== Regional competition ====
Even with expansion, the UWI medical schools are facing new competition. Many for-profit medical schools have been established in the Caribbean region, with the first established in Grenada in 1976. Generally, these schools cater to students from the United States but they sometimes offer scholarships to local students, providing an alternative to UWI programmes or going abroad for medical education to Canada, the United Kingdom or the United States. The quality of these offshore medical schools differ, though some are accredited by the CAAM-HP.

==== Research ====
The Faculty of Medicines has a research arm called the Caribbean Institute for Health Research (CAIHR), formerly the Tropical Medicine Research Institute (TMRI). The CAIHR comprises the George Alleyne Chronic Disease Research Centre, based on the Cave Hill Campus, and three units all based on the Mona Campus: the Tropical Metabolism Research Unit, the Sickle Cell Unit and the Epidemiology Research Unit. Continuing medical education is provided in different ways among the various countries with the medical associations taking the lead in some countries and the medical schools in others.

=== Faculty of Law ===
Prior to the establishment of the Faculty of Law at the UWI, residents of the anglophone Caribbean would travel primarily to the United Kingdom to study. There, a prospective lawyer would join one of the Inns of Court, receiving lodging and training and undergoing examinations. The training focused on the legal system and social context of England, which did not correspond to legal practice in the Caribbean. It was also expensive. For the legal profession in England, the influx of prospective lawyers from around the British Commonwealth was beginning to strain resources. Efforts were underway to limit foreign students in legal studies in England, and this was another reason to establish legal training in the Caribbean.

The Faculty of Law was initially established in 1970 at the Cave Hill Campus, in Barbados, but the first year of the degree was available at each campus (and the University of Guyana in Guyana). This structure served, &quot;inter alia&quot;, to create a regional institution (the Faculty) and a regional identity within the profession. Incrementally, courses from the second and third year of the law programmes were introduced at St. Augustine and Mona, allowing students to take more and more of the degree on those campuses, rather than having to study at Cave Hill. It is now possible to complete the law degree at each campus.

Following completion of the UWI law degree, graduates who intend to practice must complete a two-year practical professional training programme at one of three law schools in the Caribbean. The Eugene Dupuch Law School in The Bahamas is normally for citizens of the Bahamas, the British Virgin Islands and the Turks and Caicos Islands. The Norman Manley Law School in Jamaica has allocated citizens from Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Belize, Jamaica, Montserrat, and St. Kitts and Nevis. The Hugh Wooding Law School in Trinidad and Tobago serves Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago. The three schools were established by the Caribbean Council of Legal Education. Ironically, despite the Faculty of Law having been founded in Barbados, that country does not have a law school, though one has been suggested.

The first law students, beginning studies in October 1970, consisted of 24 students in Jamaica, nineteen in Trinidad and Tobago, 35 in Barbados, and thirteen Guyana. Two years later, almost 300 students were enrolled in the Faculty. The first graduates entered the profession in 1975.

Access to the Faculty of Law and to the Law Schools are controlled by the institutions. However, costs can vary depending on whether the applicant&#x27;s country has paid contributory grants to the Faculty or the School. Not all countries did. Therefore, applicants from non-contributing countries would be considered after those from contributing countries and their fees would be higher.

=== Faculty of Sport ===
Launched in 2017, the UWI Faculty of Sport integrates teaching and research, professional development, community partnerships, and co- and extra-curricular student sport through three main units: Professional Programmes, Outreach &amp; Projects Unit, Co-curricular &amp; Intramural-Activity Unit and the Academic Programme &amp; Activity Unit. The faculty is made up of four Academies of Sport: Cave Hill Academy of Sport, Open Campus Academy of Sport, Mona Academy of Sport and St Augustine Academy of Sport.

== UWI Press ==
Founded in 1992, the University of the West Indies Press is a department within The University of the West Indies system located in Jamaica. Supported by a regionally assembled board or directors, UWI Press acts as the overall publishing arm of the main UWI campuses, and its faculty and student body of the Open Campus where it additionally serves the diverse network of 17 countries and territories. As an entity that caters to a readership around the world, UWI Press maintains a main commitment to traditional fields of: Caribbean history, social sciences, political science and cultural studies.

== Rankings ==

In the 2021 Times Higher Education World University Rankings, UWI ranked in the 401-500th band. and in 2023, ranked in the top 150 best universities in the world for best research impact. The 2021-2022 Times Higher Education ranking ranked UWI in the top 20 when compared with Latin American University rankings, and ranked UWI first in the Caribbean.

<text>Line Lunde Østvold (7 November 1978 – 19 September 2004) was a Norwegian professional snowboarder who specialized in snowboard cross (downhill obstacle) events.

In 2001, she was ranked the number one World Female Boardercross Athlete as well as ESPN Winter X Games Boardercross Champion. After a bruised collarbone injury in 2002, she decided to retire, but when it was announced that her event would be included in the 2006 Winter Olympics, she re-entered the sport.

On 14 September 2004, Østvold was practicing with the Norwegian national snowboard team in Valle Nevado in Chile, in preparation for an FIS World Cup race. She fell on a technical section of the course called the double rollers, suffering head and neck injuries which proved to be fatal. She was flown to a specialty clinic in Santiago de Chile, but never regained consciousness and died five days later, at the age of 25.

Her father Dag Bjørn Østvold and her maternal grandfather Johnny Lunde were alpine skiers on a national level. She hailed from Haugsbygda near Hønefoss.

<text>Alice Sophie Cocéa or Cocea (28 July 1899 – 2 July 1970) was a Romanian-born French actress and singer. 

==Early life==
Alice Cocéa was born in Sinaia, Prahova County on 28 July 1899. She was a daughter of Romanian Land Forces General Dimitrie Cocea. Among her siblings were sister, Florica (who married Bressy), and a brother, Nicolae D. Cocea, a socialist journalist and novelist who was the father of actresses Dina and Tantzi Cocea.

==Career==

Although born in Romania, Cocéa came to France as a young teen before making her professional debut on the stage. She worked before, during, and after her marriage to Count Stanislas but announced her retirement shortly after her fiancé&#x27;s death in 1932, stating that she would join a convent. She worked as the manager of the Théâtre des Ambassadeurs, before returning to the screen in the 1960s.

During World War II, Cocéa was arrested as a Nazi collaborator, and later released. Her memoirs, &quot;Mes amours que j&#x27;ai tant aimées&quot; (&quot;The Loves I So Loved&quot;), were published in 1958.

==Personal life==
She was married in 1926 to Count &quot;Stanislas&quot; Édouard François Marie de La Rochefoucauld (1903–1965), only son and heir apparent of Édouard de La Rochefoucauld, Duke of Bisaccia. His father opposed the marriage, going so far as to seeking a court order preventing them from marrying, but the French Court ruled in the young couples favor. They marriage ended in divorce in 1931, and Count Stanislas later married Princess Jeanne of San Felice de Viggiano (a granddaughter of Prince Paul de Bauffremont and Countess Valentine de Riquet de Caraman-Chimay), in 1947.

In 1932 her fiancé, Lt. Victor Point, a French explorer and nephew of Philippe Berthelot, killed himself in Agay (a village in Saint-Raphaël in the French Riviera) when Cocéa declined to marry him; he died after shooting himself in the mouth. They had been involved for three years, and she had promised to become his wife once her divorce from Rochefoucauld had been settled.

She was reportedly the mistress of Roger Capgras, who rose from being a vegetable dealer to head of a major newspaper during the Nazi Occupation and later a fascist-leaning theatrical figure.

She died in Boulogne-Billancourt on 2 July 1970.

<doc id="1162429" wikidata="Q5347239" url="?curid=1162429" title="Effective Cycling">
<text>Effective Cycling is a trademarked cycling educational program designed by John Forester, which was the national education program of the League of American Wheelmen for a number of years until Forester withdrew permission for them to use the name. 
It is also the name of Forester&#x27;s book (first published in 1976 and revised numerous times since then) on the topic. 
The program consists of textbooks and training courses (for both students and instructors) and a training video for students. The central teaching of the program is vehicular cycling practices. The primary recommendation is that a bicyclist, as an operator of a pedal vehicle, should follow the rules of the road that are common to all vehicle types. Forester argues that behaving otherwise actually increases the likelihood of collisions with other vehicles.

==Principles==

Forester summarizes the rules of the road for vehicle operation in five principles:
#Use the correct half of the road, and not the sidewalk.
#Yield to other traffic as required.
#Yield when moving laterally across the road.
#Choose the correct lane and position within the lane at intersections and their approaches, based on your destination. For example, a cyclist planning to go straight through an intersection should avoid getting stuck in a right-turn-only lane, where it is easy to get clobbered by a right-turning car; a cyclist in a through-traffic lane may get a few surprised looks but will probably not get hit. Choosing the correct lane and position often involves taking the lane when the lane is not wide enough for a car and a bike side by side.
#Between intersections move away from the curb based on speed relative to other traffic and effective lane width.

Forester sums up Effective Cycling with what he calls the vehicular cycling (VC) principle: &quot;Cyclists fare best when they act and are treated as drivers of vehicles.&quot; This injunction is consistent with the rules of the road, which generally apply to all types of drivers of vehicles. The VC principle is often misunderstood to mean &quot;act like you&#x27;re a car&quot;. At most, it means to act like a driver of a low-powered motorcycle. Forester&#x27;s injunction speaks not only to cyclist behavior but also to the way cyclists should be treated by motorists, police, and road engineers.

==Opposition to segregated cycling==

Forester generally opposes segregated cycle facilities (such as bicycle lanes) which he contends encourage behavior that is contrary to the vehicular cycling practices. This contention is challenged by those who believe that such facilities increase cyclist safety, such as the authors of a meta-study on cycle infrastructure safety research at the University of British Columbia, who have publicly stated that &quot;In comparison to cycling on bicycle-specific infrastructure (paths, lanes, routes), on-road cycling appears to be less safe.&quot;
However, that study also concludes that &quot;sidewalks and multi-use trails pose the highest risk&quot; and Forester has published a reply.

Forester&#x27;s contention is also supported by some studies in Europe and the US, including a 2012 evaluation of bicycle facilities by the District of Columbia Department of Transportation, which found that crashes increased by up to a factor of two after installing bicycle tracks. The Transport Research Laboratory&#x27;s 2011 literature review found that &quot;evidence suggests that the points at which segregated networks intersect with highways offer heightened risk, potentially of sufficient magnitude to offset the safety benefits of removing cyclists from contact with vehicles in other locations.&quot; A 2008 study commissioned by the Copenhagen Municipality noted that &quot;cycle tracks constructed have resulted in increases in accidents and injuries of 9-10% on the reconstructed roads.&quot; A Danish 2008 study conducted by the Traffic Research Group of Aalborg University&#x27;s Department of Development and Planning concluded that &quot;the main results are that bicycle paths impair traffic safety and this is mainly due to more accidents at intersections.&quot; This, however, may be due to an overall increase in bicycle traffic, another consequence of the installation of segregated cycling facilities.

<text>The Jeep Liberty is a four door unibody compact SUV manufactured and marketed by Jeep for model years 2002–2012 over two generations, internally designated the KJ (2002–2007) and KK (2008–2012), respectively. Both generations were marketed globally, including as the Jeep Cherokee outside North America.

Introduced as a replacement for the Cherokee (XJ), the Liberty was priced between the Wrangler and Grand Cherokee and was the smallest of the 4-door Jeep SUVs until the car based 4-door Compass and Patriot arrived for 2007. Both generations were assembled at the Toledo North Assembly Plant in the United States and other countries including Egypt and Venezuela. The KK generation was manufactured alongside the closely related Dodge Nitro. Production ended in August 2012. 

The Liberty was superseded by the Jeep Cherokee.

==First generation (KJ; 2001–2007)==

Inspired by styling from the &quot;Dakar&quot; and &quot;Jeepster&quot; concept vehicles, the Liberty replaced the discontinued Jeep Cherokee. 

The Liberty was the first Jeep vehicle to use rack and pinion steering, and was the first Jeep to use the two then-new &quot;PowerTech&quot; engines; the 2.4 L straight-4, which was discontinued in 2006, and the 3.7 L V6, as well as a short-lived 2.8 L VM Motori turbo diesel (2005-2006 only). The Liberty was also the first Jeep vehicle to use an independent front suspension since the 1963-1965 Jeep Wagoneer. 

Three trim levels were initially offered; &quot;Limited&quot;, &quot;Renegade&quot; and the base &quot;Sport&quot;. All were made available with either 2WD or 4WD. In 2005, all models received a minor facelift. The 2005, 2006 &quot;Renegade&quot; and 2005 &quot;Rocky Mountain Edition&quot; Liberties received an exclusive flat hood and taller grille. In 2007, the &quot;Renegade&quot; trim level was replaced with the &quot;Latitude&quot; and lost the &quot;Renegade&quot; trim&#x27;s unique hood and grill. The Liberty was nominated for the North American Truck of the Year award for 2002, though safety recalls persisted.

==Second generation (KK; 2007–2012)==
The Jeep Liberty received a complete redesign for the 2008 model year and was marketed along with the closely related Dodge Nitro. The 2008 Liberty debuted at the 2007 New York International Auto Show.

With the smaller Patriot and Compass crossover SUVs now available to cater to economy-conscious buyers, the four-cylinder engine was dropped from the Liberty&#x27;s offerings. The iron-block, aluminum-head V6 was the only engine available for 2008. Towing capacity was . Jeep discontinued the Liberty CRD for the American market because it could not meet tougher 2007 emissions standards for diesel engines. Transmission choices were both carry-overs: a six-speed manual or a four-speed automatic. Standard equipment included electronic stability control with roll mitigation, traction control, and anti-lock brakes with brake assist. Jeep offered a rare 2WD version on the &quot;Jet&quot; model. New Features included standard side airbags. Optional features are rain-sensing wipers, Sirius Satellite Radio, Bluetooth, a navigation system, and the MyGig entertainment system complete with a 30GB hard drive.

<doc id="1162434" wikidata="Q5036337" url="?curid=1162434" title="Capsela">
<text>Capsela is a construction toy brand consisting primarily of gears and motors in spherical plastic capsules that can be connected to form various static or dynamic toys suitable for land or water. The capsules typically have six hollow octagonal connectors protruding, where an octagonal sleeve piece bridges between two capsules. The hollow connection pegs on a capsule can have electrical or rotary adapters inside, reaching into the next capsule. There are electric motor capsules, gear capsules, switch capsules, pontoon capsules, and others; there are also battery holders, wheels, propellers, impellers, lights, wires, and miscellaneous supporting pieces.

Capsela products were originally manufactured by the Mitsubishi Pencil Company. The series was then licensed out to Play Jour and has since been produced by VTech, Kidology, and other subsidiaries. The range was re-released in Japan by Bandai, adding new colors to the basic range of transparent spheres. In the U.S., the Capsela line was purchased by Educational Insights, a manufacturer of learning toys and educational materials for school classroom, which has discontinued the line.

==Product line==
Capsela products were originally sold in at least four ranges:

* A series of increasingly complex generic construction sets, similar in style to Meccano or Lego Technic. (Sets 135, 150, 200, 250, 400, 450, 500, 700 and 1000, ranging from 30 to 108 parts.)
* Capsela Computer, the flagship range, based around a multi-function computer capsule capable of controlling motors and lights. Sets CRC2000 and ICR5000, the latter featuring an infrared remote control.
* Capsela Voice Command systems (3000 and 6000) have a small computer capable of responding to a number of voice commands. The 6000 system has a rudimentary wireless infrared remote control.
* A sister product branded as SpaceLink, has no motorized parts (with the exception of spring powered wheel units) and instead focuses on science fiction-themed accessories (cockpits, small action figures, rockets, etc.). This range appears to have been designed to be more appealing to children than the more educational original products. This includes sets 330, 345, 360, 610, 650, 670, 690, 805, 820, 835, 850, 860 and 895, ranging from 8 to 53 parts.
* Capsela Powertram, a series designed to bridge Capsela and Spacelink, containing motor-driven construction components and Spacelink accessories. The Powertram unit is a motor-driven platform which houses its own batteries and allows land vehicles to be constructed without the need for a separate switch box, battery compartments, wires and motors. This includes sets 275 and 375, with 26 and 42 parts, respectively.
* Robot (set 204) – this set comes with a worm gear capsule with a larger gear ratio.

==Robotic Workshop==
In January 1987, Access Software announced The Robotic Workshop, a kit designed for home computers that used a range of Capsela parts. The kit includes more than 50 Capsela parts, including two motors, gears, wheels, and sensors. The kit also includes an electronic control unit that plugs into the user port of a Commodore 64, an instruction manual with 50 tutorial projects, and special programming software on a floppy disk. It was later released for Apple, Atari, and IBM computers.

==Use in schools==
Capsela has been used in school science technology classes, and to promote technical careers in engineering, robotics, and mechatronics to younger high school students, sometimes specifically targeting girls.

==Reception==
&quot;Games&quot; magazine included &quot;Capsela&quot; 700 Series in their top 100 games two years in a row. For their &quot;Top 100 Games of 1980&quot;, one of their editors described it as &quot;just the best construction set he&#x27;s ever played with.&quot; In the &quot;Top 100 Games of 1981&quot;, they praised it as a &quot;construction set that is more than child&#x27;s play&quot; and noting that &quot;The transparent parts make it easy to learn about motors, gear ratios, and transmission of energy.&quot;

<text>Barmen is a former industrial metropolis of the region of Bergisches Land, Germany, which merged with four other towns in 1929 to form the city of Wuppertal. 

Barmen, together with the neighbouring town of Elberfeld founded the first electric suspended monorail tramway system, the Schwebebahn &quot;floating tram&quot;.

==History==
Barmen was a pioneering centre for both the early Industrial Revolution on the European mainland, and for the socialist movement and its theory. It was the location of one of the first concentration camps in Nazi Germany, KZ Wuppertal-Barmen, later better known as Kemna concentration camp.

Oberbarmen (Upper Barmen) is the eastern part of Barmen, and Unterbarmen (Lower Barmen) the western part.

One of its claims to fame is the fact that Friedrich Engels, co-author of &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot;, was born in Barmen. Another of its claims is the fact that Bayer AG was founded there by Friedrich Bayer and master dyer Johann Friedrich Weskott with the express purpose to erect and operate a dyeworks.

==Legacy==
The asteroid 118173 Barmen is named in its honour, celebrating the 1934 Synod which issued the Barmen Declaration defining Protestant opposition to National-Socialist ideology.

<doc id="1162444" wikidata="Q303783" url="?curid=1162444" title="Bring Me to Life">
<text>&quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; is the debut single by American rock band Evanescence from their debut studio album, &quot;Fallen&quot; (2003). It was released by Wind-up as the album&#x27;s lead single on January 13, 2003, following its inclusion in of the film &quot;Daredevil&quot;. The song was written by Amy Lee at age 19 about having been desensitized in an abusive relationship and realizing things she had been missing in life. Guitarist Ben Moody and David Hodges share songwriting credits on the song, which features guest vocals from Paul McCoy of the band 12 Stones. Produced by Dave Fortman, &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; is primarily a nu metal song. The male vocals were forced by the label against Lee&#x27;s wishes in order to market it in the musical landscape of the time.

The song received a generally positive reception, with critics praising Lee&#x27;s vocals and melody. It charted in the top ten of over 20 countries, reaching number five in the US and number one in the UK. One of Evanescence&#x27;s most commercially successful songs, &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; was certified triple-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in 2019. It won the Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance and was also nominated for Best Rock Song. Directed by Philipp Stölzl, the music video shows Lee singing and climbing on a skyscraper while having nightmares in her room. The song was re-worked and re-recorded on Evanescence&#x27;s orchestral-electronica fourth studio album, &quot;Synthesis&quot; (2017).

== Composition and recording ==
Lee wrote &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; at age 19, after a then-acquaintance (who later became her husband) asked her if she was happy; Lee was in an abusive relationship and in turmoil, and was shocked the person saw through her facade as she felt she &quot;was completely outwardly acting normal&quot;. &quot;I felt like he could just see straight into my soul. That inspired the whole song&quot;, she explained. The song is about &quot;open-mindedness&quot; and &quot;waking up to all the things you&#x27;ve been missing for so long&quot;. After the moment that inspired her to write it, she &quot;realized that for months I&#x27;d been numb, just going through the motions of life.&quot; In 2022, Lee noted that she was finding her voice lyrically while making the album, realizing &quot;how the more honest I was, the more powerful I felt&quot;; the song was &quot;in a broader way about breaking free from something I knew I had the power to if I was brave enough&quot;, and represented &quot;true desires, unspoken frustrations and fears, standing up to the bullshit around me [that] I was just on the cusp of being able to defeat&quot;. It expressed a &quot;cry for help&quot;, while &quot;Going Under&quot;, which she wrote after &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot;, was the next stage of her &quot;coming to the realization that I was going to stand up for myself and make a change.&quot; Moody and David Hodges share writing credits on the track. 

With pressure from the label to refine its production, Evanescence ultimately made around 10 demos of the song, which included changing the synths for the opening piano part, and the addition of real strings by David Campbell, an &quot;expense&quot; Lee &quot;fought hard for over a less expensive synthetic alternative&quot;. Most of the song was recorded for the &quot;Daredevil&quot; soundtrack at Ocean Studios in Burbank, California. It was mixed by Jay Baumgardner in his studio, NRG Recording Studios in North Hollywood, on an SSL 9000 J. A 22-piece string section was recorded by Mark Curry in Seattle, and mixed at the Newman Scoring Stage and Bolero Studios in Los Angeles.

&quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; is stylistically a nu metal-rap rock song. In order to market it, the label forced them to add the male rapping vocal, which Lee did not want, or the song and album would not be released. The male vocal was a compromise after the label originally demanded they include a rap on eight of the songs on the album. During an interview, Lee stated: &quot;It was presented to me as, &#x27;You&#x27;re a girl singing in a rock band, there&#x27;s nothing else like that out there, nobody&#x27;s going to listen to you. You need a guy to come in and sing back-up for it to be successful.&#x27;&quot; Lee wrote Paul McCoy&#x27;s part. On the chorus, Lee sings the lines &quot;&#x27;Call my name and save me from the dark&#x27; over &quot;surging guitars&quot;, and McCoy raps the lines &quot;Wake me up/ I can&#x27;t wake up/ Save me!&quot;. The song is set in common time and performed in a moderate tempo of 95 beats per minute. It is written in the key of E minor, and Lee&#x27;s vocal range for the song runs from the low note of A3 to the high note of D5.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Kirk Miller said that the song is stylistically a &quot;case of mistaken identity&quot;, dooming the band to Linkin Park comparisons &quot;thanks to [its] digital beats, clean metal-guitar riffs, scattered piano lines and all-too-familiar mix of rapping and singing.&quot; Blair R. Fischer of MTV called it a &quot;ubiquitous rap-rock confection&quot;. Richard Harrington from &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described its sound as &quot;crunching metallic&quot;. Ann Powers from the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said that &quot;with its lyrical drama and crunchy guitars, [the song] branded the band as overdone nu-metal.&quot; &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; has also been classified as hard rock, alternative rock, and &quot;Blender&quot; writer Nick Catucci described it as a &quot;crossover goth-metal smash&quot;. Nick Catucci of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; wrote that &quot;piano tinkles, Lee&#x27;s breathless keen, dramatic pauses, guitars like clouds of locusts, [and] McCoy&#x27;s passing-12-kidney-stones guest vocals&quot; characterize the song, which &quot;sounds like church-burning, brain-eating European dark metal.&quot; Vik Bansal of &quot;MusicOMH&quot; said the track contains &quot;Lee&#x27;s temptress vocals, pseudo-electronic beats à la Linkin Park, understated but menacing metallic riffs in the background, and a ripping, radio-friendly rock chorus.&quot; MTV described it as &quot;an unrelenting paean that begins as hauntingly delicate before piling on crumpled guitar lines and a rap&quot; while &quot;Lee&#x27;s vocals soar above the whole sludgy mixture&quot;.

== Release ==
&quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; first appeared in a scene of the film &quot;Daredevil&quot; and was included on the , released in February 2003. The song was released as &quot;Fallen&quot;″s first single on April 7, 2003. Wind-up Entertainment president Ed Vetri revealed that when the label first introduced the song to radio, radio programmers rejected it, saying, &quot;A chick and a piano? Are you kidding? On rock radio?&quot; Some program directors would hear the female voice and piano at the start of the song and turn it off without listening to the rest of the song. A female voice on rock radio was a rarity, and the song was considered for airplay only after there was a male vocal on it. After the song was released on the &quot;Daredevil&quot; soundtrack, listeners began requesting air play for it, compelling radio stations to reconsider Evanescence.

Lee said that with the success of the single they &quot;went from playing clubs to arenas in a matter of months&quot; and &quot;people in other countries were listening to it&quot;. On its international success, she stated: 

The single includes &quot;Farther Away&quot; as a B-side. The first pressing of the Australian single contained the track &quot;Missing&quot; as a B-side, but this was omitted from later pressings and later released as a bonus track on the band&#x27;s first live album, &quot;Anywhere but Home&quot;. An acoustic version was recorded and released on the &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; DVD. In 2003, the song served as the official theme song for WWE&#x27;s 2003 No Way Out event.

== Reception and accolades ==
AllMusic&#x27;s Johnny Loftus called the song &quot;misleading&quot; due to the vocal duet but &quot;flawless&quot;. Kelefa Sanneh of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; &quot;floats like a butterfly, stings like a bee and then hits like a brick.&quot; Writing for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Ann Powers wrote that it is a &quot;mix of voluptuous singing and metallic guitar (the latter enhanced by McCoy&#x27;s rap-rock declamations)&quot;. Joe D&#x27;Angelo of MTV said the song is an &quot;unrelenting paean that begins as hauntingly delicate before piling on crumpled guitar lines and a rap&quot; and Lee&#x27;s &quot;vocals soar above the whole sludgy mixture to keep it from sinking into tired mediocrity.&quot; Adrien Bengrad from &quot;PopMatters&quot; called it a &quot;quality single&quot; although hearing it more led him to find it &quot;nothing more than a bombastic distraction from the usual dreck&quot; despite &quot;the refreshing dose of melody&quot;. Christopher Gray of &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; deemed it &quot;one of the more curious offerings to be had on the airwaves right now and lingers in the memory like the remnants of a particularly vivid nightmare&quot;.

Bryan Reeseman of &quot;Mix&quot; described &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; as &quot;grandiose and moody&quot;. Nick Catucci of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; deemed it a &quot;fabulous breakthrough single&quot; that sounds like &quot;church-burning, brain-eating European dark metal.&quot; Writing for &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, Mike Rampton found the &quot;manly rap&quot; forced by their label to be &quot;not good&quot;. John Hood of the &quot;Miami New Times&quot; said it is a &quot;huge, heavy, and mightily histrionic&quot; track that pits Lee&#x27;s &quot;soaring voice both with and against the rap-infused gruff of McCoy&quot;. In his review of Evanescence&#x27;s second album, Don Kaye of Blabbermouth.net criticized the song for containing &quot;annoying faux-rapping&quot; as a &quot;key component&quot;. For NPR, Suzy Exposito wrote that McCoy &quot;came in to insulate chauvinistic rock listeners from Lee&#x27;s operatic subjectivity&quot;. Melissa Maerz of &quot;Spin&quot; said that Lee thematically tackles death on the song with &quot;grandeur&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called it &quot;haunting, moody and cinematic&quot;. 

&quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance at the 46th Grammy Awards, where it was also nominated in the category Best Rock Song. At the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards the band was nominated in the category for Best New Artist for &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot;. The song received a nomination at the 2003 MTV Europe Music Awards for Best Song. At the 14th annual &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards, it won the award for Soundtrack Single of the Year. &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; ranked number 69 on VH1&#x27;s 100 Greatest Songs of the 2000s. In 2018, NPR named it one of the 200 greatest songs by 21st century women. In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the song at number 43 on their &quot;100 Greatest Heavy Metal Songs of All Time&quot; list.

== Music video ==
The music video for &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; was directed by Philipp Stölzl. Stölzl stated: 

According to Joe D&#x27;Angelo of MTV News, Lee&#x27;s &quot;teetering on a ledge&quot; in the video shows a &quot;distressed and emotionally wrought heroine.&quot; Ann Powers from the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote: &quot;You might not immediately recognize Amy Lee&#x27;s name, but you would know her if she plummeted past you from the top floor of a tenement building.&quot; Corey Moss of MTV felt that &quot;as intense as a superhero movie, the sequence also gives a nice visual to the song&#x27;s most memorable lyric, &#x27;Save me.&#x27;&quot; John Hood of &quot;Miami New Times&quot; wrote that the video&#x27;s &quot;gothopolis backdrop&quot; would &quot;make Tim Burton green with envy&quot;.

The music video peaked at number nine on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Total Request Live&quot; in April 2003. It was nominated at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards for Best Rock Video, but lost to Linkin Park&#x27;s &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot;. On February 1, 2022, it surpassed 1 billion views on YouTube, becoming the first Evanescence music video to reach this milestone.

== Live performances ==
A live performance from the &quot;Fallen&quot; tour filmed at Le Zénith in Paris is included on Evanescence&#x27;s first live album and concert DVD &quot;Anywhere but Home&quot; (2004). The live recording contains a piano and vocal solo before the song&#x27;s intro. McCoy&#x27;s studio vocals were performed by tour guitarist John LeCompt during the tour. 

In October 2011, the band performed the song at the Rock in Rio festival. Lee performed the song with Japanese band Wagakki Band in February 2020, at Osaka-jō Hall in Osaka, Japan. Evanescence performed the song live with singer Sonny Sandoval in September 2022, and at Rock am Ring festival with guest singer Jacoby Shaddix in June 2023.

== 2017 &quot;Synthesis&quot; arrangement ==
In 2017, an orchestral and electronic version of the song was recorded for the band&#x27;s fourth studio album &quot;Synthesis&quot;. It was made available for digital download and streaming on August 18, 2017; it was also made available for instant download for concertgoers of the band&#x27;s Synthesis Tour. The &quot;Synthesis&quot; version of &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; replaces the drums and guitar from the &quot;Fallen&quot; version with string arrangements accompanied by crashing cymbals, &quot;tension-building&quot; timpani drums and various electronic elements throughout. It also removes McCoy&#x27;s vocal feature. Several critics described its new arrangement as &quot;dramatic&quot;, with &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Sadie Bell deeming it &quot;just as rich&quot; as the original and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Brittany Spanos calling it a &quot;cinematic take&quot;. Lee described the song as &quot;new&quot; to her again as she incorporated musical elements and vocals which she had &quot;heard in [her] head&quot; since its release.

<text>Seven Kings is an area of Ilford in Greater London, England, part of the London Borough of Redbridge. Situated approximately two miles from Ilford town centre, Seven Kings forms part of the Ilford post town. Historically part of Essex, it was part of the Municipal Borough of Ilford until 1965 when it was incorporated into Greater London.

==History==
The earliest recorded use of the name is as &quot;Sevekyngg&quot; or &quot;Sevekyngges&quot; in 1285, possibly meaning &#x27;settlement of the family or followers of a man called Seofoca&#x27;.

Seven Kings has not historically formed a parish or other division; instead it was part of the ancient parish of Ilford in the Becontree hundred of the county of Essex, which formed from 1894, the Ilford Urban District (later municipal borough). Seven Kings is situated next to the ancient Roman road between London and Colchester and was rapidly developed during the 19th century following construction of the Great Eastern Main Line railway.

In 1965, the Ilford parish and municipal borough were abolished by the London Government Act 1963, and the area of Essex including Seven Kings has since formed part of Greater London.

==Education==

Located in the immediate area are Mayfield High School, The Palmer Catholic Academy, Seven Kings High School and Isaac Newton Academy secondary school. Primary schools in this area include Downshall Primary School, Farnham Green Primary School, South Park Primary School, Seven Kings Primary School, Isaac Newton Academy primary school, and Eastcourt Independent School.

==Transport==
The area is served by Seven Kings railway station on the Great Eastern Main Line to/from Liverpool Street station. Train services are operated by the Elizabeth line.

The nearest London Underground station is Newbury Park on the Central line.

==Recreation==

The area contains many green spaces including Seven Kings Park, a large open space containing sports facilities such as tennis courts, cricket facilities, a sports ground, and a bandstand. There is also Westwood Park, a smaller open space and playground on Meads Lane. Thomas McCurtains GAA are based in Seven Kings Park, it&#x27;s free to join and offer Camogie, football (male and female teams), hurling and kids sports

<text>Philip James Elliot (October 8, 1927 – January 8, 1956) was an American Christian missionary and one of five people killed during Operation Auca, an attempt to evangelize the Huaorani people of Ecuador.

==Early life ==
Elliot was born in Portland, Oregon, to Fred and Clara Elliot. Fred was of Scottish heritage; his grandparents were the first of his family to settle in North America. Clara&#x27;s parents moved near the turn of the 20th century from Switzerland to eastern Washington, where they operated a large ranch. They met in Portland, where Clara was studying to be a chiropractor and Fred, having devoted himself to Christian ministry, was working as a traveling preacher with the Plymouth Brethren movement. Robert, their first child, was born in 1921 while they were living in Seattle, and he was followed by Herbert, Jim, and Jane, all three of whom were born after the family moved to Portland. Elliot&#x27;s parents had firm Christian beliefs, and they raised their children accordingly, taking them to church and reading the Bible regularly. Elliot professed faith in Jesus at the age of six and grew up in a home where obedience and honesty were enforced. The Elliot parents encouraged their children to be adventurous, and encouraged them to &quot;live for Christ&quot;.

In 1941, Elliot entered Benson Polytechnic High School, studying architectural drawing. There he participated in numerous activities, including the school newspaper, the wrestling team, school plays, and the public-speaking club. His acting ability led some of the teachers in the school to suggest that he pursue acting as a career, and his oratorical skills were similarly lauded—after Elliot prepared and delivered a speech in honor of President Franklin D. Roosevelt hours after his death, a faculty member praised it.

Elliot used his speaking ability regularly. A classmate recounts how Elliot quoted the Bible to the president of the student body as an explanation for his refusal to attend a school party. Another time, Elliot risked expulsion from the public-speaking club by refusing to give a political speech, believing that Christians were not to involve themselves in politics. A pacifist, he rejected the idea of using force to eliminate slavery in Africa, and he was prepared to stand as a conscientious objector had he been drafted to serve in World War II.

==Leaving for Ecuador==
In the summer of 1950, while at Camp Wycliffe (Cameron Townsend&#x27;s linguistics training camp in Oklahoma), Elliot practiced the skills necessary for writing down a language for the first time by working with a former missionary to the Quechua people. The missionary told him of the Huaorani – also called the &quot;Auca&quot;, the Quichua word for &quot;savage&quot; – a group of Ecuadorian indigenous people considered violent and dangerous to outsiders. Elliot remained unsure about whether to go to Ecuador or India until July. His parents and friends wondered if he might instead be more effective in youth ministry in the United States, but considering the home church &quot;well-fed&quot;, he felt that international missions should take precedence.

After the completion of his linguistic studies, Elliot applied for a passport and began to make plans with his friend Bill Cathers to leave for Ecuador. However, two months later Cathers informed him that he planned to marry, making it impossible for him to accompany Elliot as they had planned. Instead, Elliot spent the winter and spring of 1951 working with his friend Ed McCully in Chester, Illinois, running a radio program, preaching in prisons, holding evangelistic rallies, and teaching Sunday school.

McCully married later that summer, forcing Elliot to look elsewhere for an unmarried man with whom he could begin working in Ecuador. That man turned out to be Pete Fleming, a graduate of the University of Washington with a degree in philosophy. He corresponded frequently with Elliot, and by September he was convinced of his calling to Ecuador. In the meantime, Elliot visited friends on the east coast, including his future wife, Elisabeth. In his journal he expressed hope that they would be able to be married, but at the same time felt that he was called to go to Ecuador without her. Elliot returned to Portland in November and began to prepare to leave the country.

==Ecuador==
Elliot and Fleming arrived in Ecuador on February 21, 1952, with the purpose of evangelizing Ecuador&#x27;s Quechua people. They first stayed in Quito, and then moved to the jungle. They took up residence at the Shandia mission station. On October 8, 1953, he married fellow Wheaton alumna and missionary Elisabeth Howard. The wedding was a simple civil ceremony held in Quito. Ed and Marilou McCully were the witnesses. The couple then took a brief honeymoon to Panama and Costa Rica, then returned to Ecuador. Their only child, Valerie, was born February 27, 1955. While working with the Quechua, Elliot began preparing to reach the Huaorani.

Elliot and his group (Ed McCully, Roger Youderian, Pete Fleming, and their pilot, Nate Saint) made contact from their Piper PA-14 airplane with the Huaorani using a loudspeaker and a basket to pass down gifts. After several months, the men decided to build a base a short distance from the Amerindian village, along the Curaray River. There they were approached one time by a small group of Huaorani and even gave an airplane ride to one curious Huaorani whom they called &quot;George&quot; (his real name was Naenkiwi). Encouraged by these friendly encounters, they began plans to visit the Huaorani. Their plans were preempted by the arrival of a larger group of about 10 Huaorani warriors, who killed Elliot and his four companions on January 8, 1956. Jim Elliot was the first of the five missionaries killed when he and Peter Fleming were greeting two of those attackers. Elliot&#x27;s body was found downstream, along with those of the other men. Ed McCully&#x27;s body was found even farther downstream.

==Legacy==

&quot;Life&quot; magazine published a ten-page article on Elliot&#x27;s and his friends&#x27; mission and deaths. After his death, his wife Elisabeth Elliot and other missionaries began working among the Huaorani, where they continued evangelistic work. She later published two books, &quot;Shadow of the Almighty: The Life and Testament of Jim Elliot&quot; and &quot;Through Gates of Splendor&quot;, which describe the life and death of her husband. In 1991, the Jim Elliot Christian School was created in Denver, Colorado. In 1997, the Jim Elliot Christian High School was founded in Lodi, California.

In 2002, a documentary based on the story was released, entitled &quot;Beyond the Gates of Splendor&quot;. In 2003, a musical based on the story of Jim and Elisabeth Elliot, entitled &quot;Love Above All&quot;, was staged at the Victoria Concert Hall in Singapore by Mount Carmel Bible-Presbyterian Church. This musical was staged a second time in 2007 at the NUS University Cultural Centre. In 2006, a theatrical movie was released, entitled &quot;End of the Spear&quot;, based on the story of the pilot, Nate Saint, and the return trip of Saint&#x27;s son, Steve Saint, attempting to reach the natives of Ecuador.

Susan Martins Miller in her book Jim Elliot: Missionary to Ecuador gives a quote from Jim Elliot which he wrote during his years at Wheaton College. &quot;He is no fool who gives what he cannot keep to gain what he cannot lose&quot;. The actual quote is “He is no fool who gives what he cannot keep to gain that which he cannot lose.”

<doc id="1162451" wikidata="Q4768878" url="?curid=1162451" title="Anne Westfall">
<text>Anne Westfall is an American video game programmer and software developer, known for 1983&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, originally written for the Atari 8-bit computers. Westfall and her spouse, fellow game developer Jon Freeman, together founded Free Fall Associates. 

==Career==
Westfall began computer programming at the age of 30. Before moving into the video game industry, Westfall worked as a programmer for a civil engineering firm Morton Technology, where she developed the first microcomputer-based program designed to help lay out subdivisions.

In 1981, Westfall and her husband, Jon, left Epyx, the video game developer and publisher her husband co-founded just three years earlier. Westfall cited a desire to learn assembly language and to work on the Atari 800 as one reason for their departure from Epyx.

Together with game designer Paul Reiche III, they started Free Fall Associates to make computer games free of the politics existing at the now larger Epyx. Together with Jon and Reiche, she helped develop the two award-winning and highly acclaimed games &quot;&quot; and &quot;Archon II&quot;, handling the brunt of the programming work.

For six years, Westfall was on the board of directors of the Computer Game Developers Conference.

==Personal==
Westfall met Jon at the West Coast Computer Faire in 1980 while demonstrating her surveying program she wrote for the TRS-80. Her booth was next to that of Automated Simulations—later Epyx—where Jon was working. After dating for about six months, Freeman convinced Westfall to move closer and come to work at his company.

<text>Kambja () is a small borough () in Tartu County, Estonia. It is the administrative centre of Kambja Parish.

Earlier there was located Vastse-Kambja manor (&quot;Neu-Kamby&quot;).

== St. Martin&#x27;s Church ==
Kambja Church burned down several times, but was always rebuilt. The first mention of Kambja and the church at its present location dates to as early as 1330. After the first fire in 1558, it took 84 years to rebuild the church. Again was it destroyed in 1704 during the Great Northern War. Renovation were finished in 1721 and those walls are the basis for the present building. In 1874 an extension was built; there were ten thousand members in the parish around that time. In 1937 a new northern tower with staircases was built.

During World War II, on 19 August 1944, the church was bombed by the invading Russian troops. The new Soviet regime did not allow the church to be rebuilt, and the congregation was forced to close. The church remained in ruins until 1987, when the times started to change and on the initiative of Ivar Tedrema, the state farm director at that time, and with the help of school principal Madis Linnamägi, Toivo Traksmaa and many others, the renovation began. The Lutheran congregation was re-established in 1994.

==Notable people==
Notable people that were born or lived in Kambja include the following:
*Felix Johannes Oinas (1911–2004), folklorist, linguist, and translator

<doc id="1162472" wikidata="Q3267965" url="?curid=1162472" title="USS Cubera">
<text>USS &quot;Cubera&quot; (SS-347), a submarine, was a ship of the United States Navy named for the cubera, a large fish of the snapper family found in the West Indies.

&quot;Cubera&quot; (SS-347) was launched 17 June 1945 by Electric Boat Co., Groton, Conn.; sponsored by Mrs. J. Taber; commissioned 19 December 1945 and reported to the Atlantic Fleet.

After shakedown training off New London, &quot;Cubera&quot; arrived at Key West, Fla., 19 March 1946. She tested sonar equipment, provided services to experimental antisubmarine warfare development projects in the Florida Straits, and joined in fleet exercises until 4 July 1947 when she sailed to Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for an extensive GUPPY II modernization.

Returning to Key West 9 March 1948 &quot;Cubera&quot; continued to operate locally out of this port, as well as taking part in fleet exercises in the Caribbean and Atlantic until 3 July 1952 when she arrived at Norfolk, her new home port.

&quot;Cubera&quot; appeared in Ray Harryhausen&#x27;s &quot;It Came from Beneath the Sea&quot; (1955), playing an &quot;atomic sub&quot; used to dispatch the film&#x27;s giant octopus.

Through 1957 &quot;Cubera&quot; conducted local operations, and participated in fleet exercises in the Caribbean, as well as cruising to Sydney, Nova Scotia, in June 1955. During 1959 and 1960, she was assigned to Task Force Alfa, a force conducting constant experiments to improve antisubmarine warfare techniques. With this group she cruised the western Atlantic from Nova Scotia to Bermuda.

== ARV &quot;Tiburon&quot; (S-12) ==

&quot;Cubera&quot; was decommissioned and sold under the Security Assistance Program to Venezuela 5 January 1972. The Venezuelan Navy renamed her ARV &quot;Tiburon&quot; (S-12) (&quot;Tiburon&quot; means shark in Spanish). She was subsequently scrapped by Venezuela in 1989.
