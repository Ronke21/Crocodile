<text>Friedrich von Mellenthin (30 August 1904 – 28 June 1997) was a German general during World War II. A participant in most of the major campaigns of the war, he became known afterwards for his memoirs &quot;Panzer Battles&quot;, first published in 1956 and reprinted several times since then.

Mellenthin&#x27;s works were part of the exculpatory memoirs genre that fed the post-war revisionist narrative, put forth by former Wehrmacht generals. &quot;Panzer Battles&quot; was instrumental in forming the misconceptions that influenced the U.S. view of Eastern Front military operations up to 1995, when Soviet archival sources became available to Western and Russian historians.

== Biography ==
Mellenthin was born in Breslau; his brother Horst von Mellenthin was also a World War II general. In 1924, Friedrich von Mellenthin enlisted in the &quot;Reichsheer&quot;; in 1932 he married Ingeborg von Aulock. He was assigned to the Prussian Military Academy in 1935. Between 1937 and June 1941, Mellenthin held several general staff positions in the Army; in June 1941, Mellenthin was posted to North Africa, where he served as a staff officer in the &quot;Afrika Korps&quot; until September 1942.

Until May 1944, Mellenthin served as chief of staff of the XXXXVIII Panzer Corps in the occupied Soviet Union, under General Hermann Balck, including during the Battle of Kursk, the Battle of Kiev, and the spring 1944 retreat through the western Ukraine. In September 1944, Mellenthin followed Balck to the 4th Panzer Army and then to Army Group G in eastern France. On 28 December, Mellenthin was given command of 9th Panzer Division, which was then engaged in the Battle of the Bulge. From March to May 1945 he was chief of staff of the 5th Panzer Army.

Mellenthin surrendered to the British Army on 3 May 1945 and spent two and a half years in an internment camp. After his release, Mellenthin emigrated to South Africa, founded Trek Airways, worked together with Luxair and represented Lufthansa in Africa from 1961 until 1969. He died in Johannesburg in 1997.

==Authorship and reception==

Mellenthin&#x27;s book &quot;Panzerschlachten&quot;, translated into English as &quot;Panzer Battles&quot;, documents Wehrmacht&#x27;s campaigns that he participated in. The book was reprinted six times in the U.S. between 1956 and 1976 and continues to be popular among readers who romanticize the German war effort. The veracity of Mellenthin&#x27;s &quot;Panzer Battles&quot; and other works has been called into question over the years. The historian Wolfram Wette lists Mellenthin in the group of German generals who authored apologetic, uncritical studies on World War II, alongside Ferdinand Heim, Kurt von Tippelskirch, Waldemar Erfurth and others.

Critics point out that Mellenthin tends to downplay Wehrmacht&#x27;s failures while extolling the fighting qualities of the German soldier. The historians Ronald Smelser and Edward J. Davies have characterized Mellenthin&#x27;s works as part of the &quot;exculpatory memoirs&quot; genre that fed the post-war revisionist narrative, alongside books by Erich von Manstein, Heinz Guderian, Hans Rudel and Hans von Luck. Mellenthin blames Wehrmacht&#x27;s defeat solely on the Soviet advantages in men and materiel, describing the Red Army as a &quot;ruthless enemy, possessed of immense and seemingly inexhaustible resources&quot;. As a result, according to Mellenthin, the &quot;endless waves of men and tanks&quot; eventually &quot;submerged&quot; the supposedly superior Wehrmacht.

Wehrmacht&#x27;s adversaries on the Eastern Front are consistently depicted in derogatory and racial terms, including in a section dedicated to the &quot;Psychology of the Russian Soldier&quot;. According to Mellenthin, &quot;Russian soldier&quot; is a &quot;primitive being&quot;, characterised by &quot;mental sluggishness&quot; and lacking a &quot;religious or moral balance&quot;. He describes them as &quot;primitive&quot; &quot;Asiatics&quot;.

&quot;Panzer Battles&quot; was instrumental in forming the misconceptions which influenced the U.S. view of Eastern Front military operations up to 1995, when Soviet archival sources became available to Western and Russian historians. The historian Robert Citino notes the influential nature of Mellenthin&#x27;s works in shaping the perceptions of the Red Army in the West as &quot;a faceless and mindless horde&quot; whose idea of military art was to &quot;smash everything in its path through numbers, brute force and sheer size&quot;. Citino includes &quot;Panzer Battles&quot; among the German officers&#x27; memoirs that are &quot;at best unreliable and at worst deliberately misleading&quot;.

<text>The Kitāb al-Taṣrīf (), known in English as The Method of Medicine, is a 30-volume Arabic encyclopedia on medicine and surgery, written near the year 1000 by Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (Abulcasis). It is available in translation.
The took al-Zahrawi over 50 years to complete. It contains information about a wide variety of illnesses, injuries, medical conditions, treatments, and surgical procedures. It describes over 200 different surgical instruments. Surgeons continued to rely on the well into the 1700s.

== Summary ==
The work covers a broad range of medical topics, including on surgery, medicine, orthopaedics, ophthalmology, pharmacology, nutrition, dentistry, childbirth, and pathology. The last treatise and the most celebrated one is about surgery. Al-Zahrawi stated that he chose to discuss surgery in the last volume because surgery is the highest form of medicine, and one must not practice it until he becomes well-acquainted with all other branches of medicine.

==&quot;On Surgery and Instruments&quot;==
&quot;On Surgery and Instruments&quot; is the 30th and last volume of . In it, al-Zahrawi draws diagrams of each tool used in different procedures to clarify how to carry out the steps of each treatment.

Al-Zahrawi claims that his knowledge comes from careful reading of previous medical texts as well as his own experience: “…whatever skill I have, I have derived for myself by my long reading of the books of the Ancients and my thirst to understand them until I extracted the knowledge of it from them. Then through the whole of my life I have adhered to experience and practice…I have made it accessible for you and rescued it from the abyss of prolixity”.

In the beginning of his book, al-Zahrawi states that the reason for writing this treatise was the degree of underdevelopment surgery had reached in the Islamic world, and the low status it was held by the physicians at the time. Al-Zahrawi ascribed such decline to a lack of anatomical knowledge and a misunderstanding of the human physiology.

Noting the importance of anatomy, he wrote: 

Innovative surgical techniques discussed by al-Zahrawi in the volume include crushing bladder stones with a sort of lithotrite he called &quot;michaab&quot;, and using forceps for extracting a dead fetus. The text also contains a number of innovations in dentistry, including using gold and silver wires to ligate loosened teeth, extracting and replanting teeth, and scaling the calculus from the teeth to prevent periodontal disease.

Al-Zahrawi depicted over 200 surgical instruments, some of which he created himself. Instruments in the &quot;al-Tasrif&quot; include different kinds of scalpels, retractors, curettes, pincers, specula, and also instruments designed for his favoured techniques of cauterization and ligature. He also invented hooks with a double tip for use in surgery.

==Latin translation and legacy==

The book was translated into Latin in the 12th century by Gerard of Cremona. It soon found popularity in Europe and became a standard text in universities like those of Salerno and Montpellier. It remained the primary source on surgery in Europe for the next 500 years, and as the historian of medicine, Arturo Castiglioni, has put it: al-Zahrawi&#x27;s treatise &quot;in surgery held the same authority as did the Canon of Avicenna in medicine&quot;.

<text>William Armstrong (July 28, 1822 – June 9, 1914) was a Canadian artist and one of the early professional artists of Toronto, Ontario.

==Life and work==
William Armstrong was born in Dublin, Ireland on July 28, 1822. He studied art in Ireland, then completed an apprenticeship in England with the Midland Railway to become a railway engineer. He immigrated to Canada in 1851, settling in Toronto and began work with the railway. He found a market for his artwork with the illustrated news who covered the events in the colonies. His watercolours of local events and scenes were reproduced as monochrome wood engravings so they could be included in these weekly periodicals.
Armstrong added photography to his skills and in 1855 he started Armstrong and Beere with his nephew Daniel Manders Beere (1833-1909). Humphrey Lloyd Hime (1833-1903) joined them two years later to form Armstrong, Beere and Hime. The company was responsible for completing a 360 degree panorama sequence of the City of Toronto in 1856-1857 to support the city&#x27;s bid to become the capital of Canada. The company ceased operation in 1861.

Armstrong marketed his skill as a draftsman as an asset to those who were interested in expanding Canada westward. Beginning in 1859, Armstrong made a number of trips west accompanying various survey expeditions. His drawings were used to report the activities of the expeditions as well as the terrain and human activity observed. 

In 1870, Armstrong accompanied the Wolseley Expedition to the Red River Colony, recording the incredible effort required to move the military force through the Canadian wilderness. One of his compositions, &quot;Red River Expedition, Purgatory Landing&quot; was reproduced as a wood engraving on the cover of the Canadian Illustrated News on July 9, 1970 to accompany their coverage of the expedition&#x27;s progress.

He won numerous prizes as an artist at provincial exhibitions, and his work was displayed at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1855, and at the Dublin International Exhibition, 1865. He exhibited with the Ontario Society of Artists and was a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts until 1887, when he resigned.

In 1864 Armstrong began to teach drawing at the Toronto Normal School. He taught at the University of Toronto from 1872 to 1877. He retired in 1897 but continued teaching art from his home until his death. He died in Toronto on 9 June 1914.

A number of his watercolour landscapes of the Great Lakes may be found in collections such as the Art Gallery of Ontario, the National Gallery of Canada, the Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec and the Thunder Bay Historical Museum. He painted the watercolour &quot;The Arrival of the Prince of Wales at Toronto&quot; (1860) which hangs in the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, Ontario. Armstrong depicted grim working conditions inside Victorian Toronto&#x27;s industrial plants in his pastel drawing &quot;Toronto Rolling Mills&quot; (1864), which forms part of the Toronto Public Library&#x27;s J. Ross Robertson Collection. His watercolour painting, &quot;Thunder Cape, Lake Superior&quot; (1867), hangs in the National Archives of Canada.

<text>Charles Arthur Feathers (June 12, 1932 – August 29, 1998) was an American musician most associated with the rockabilly scene of the 1950s. Although not initially recognized for his contributions to rockabilly, over time his presence would become greatly elevated and he has been cited as an influence by a number of musicians.

==Biography==
Feathers was born in Holly Springs, Mississippi, United States.

He started out as a session musician at Sun Studios, playing any side instrument he could in the hopes of someday making his own music there. He eventually played on a small label started by Sam Phillips called Flip records which got him enough attention to record a couple of singles for Sun Records and Holiday Inn Records. By all accounts the singer was not held in much regard by Phillips, but Feathers often made the audacious claim that he had arranged &quot;That&#x27;s All Right&quot; and &quot;Blue Moon of Kentucky&quot; for Elvis Presley. He also claimed that his &quot;We&#x27;re Getting Closer (To Being Apart)&quot; had been intended to be Elvis&#x27; sixth single for Sun. He did, however, get his name on one of Elvis&#x27; Sun records, &quot;I Forgot to Remember to Forget&quot; when the writer Stan Kesler asked him to record a demo of the song.

He then moved on to Meteor Records and then King Records where he recorded his best-known work. His 1950s singles included &quot;Peepin&#x27; Eyes&quot;, &quot;Defrost Your Heart&quot;, &quot;Tongue-Tied Jill&quot; and &quot;Bottle to the Baby&quot;. When his King contract ran out he still continued to perform, although Feathers thought there was a conspiracy to keep his music from gaining the popularity it deserved.

In the mid-1980s, he performed at times at new music nightclubs like the Antenna Club in Memphis, Tennessee, sharing the bill with rock-and-roll bands like Tav Falco&#x27;s Panther Burns, who, as devoted fans of Feathers, had introduced him to their label&#x27;s president.

He released his &quot;New Jungle Fever&quot; album in 1987 and &quot;Honkey Tonk Man&quot; in 1988, featuring the lead guitar work of his son, Bubba Feathers. These later albums of original songs penned by Feathers were released on the French label New Rose Records, whose other 1980s releases included albums by Johnny Thunders, Alex Chilton, Roky Erickson, The Cramps, The Gun Club, and others.

He died on August 29, 1998, of complications from a stroke-induced coma. He was buried at Forest Hill Cemetery South in Memphis.

== Style and influences ==

Charlie Feathers studied and recorded several songs with Junior Kimbrough, whom he called &quot;the beginning and end of all music&quot;. His childhood influences were reflected in his later music of the 1970s and 1980s, which had an easy-paced, sometimes sinister, country-blues tempo, as opposed to the frenetic fast-paced style favored by some of his rockabilly colleagues of the 1950s. Feathers was known for being a master of shifting emotional and sonic dynamics in his songs. His theatrical, hiccup-styled, energetic, rockabilly vocal style inspired a later generation of rock vocalists, including Lux Interior of The Cramps.

Feathers&#x27; song, &quot;That Certain Female&quot; was featured on the soundtrack to Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s 2003 film, &quot;Kill Bill: Volume 1&quot;. His &quot;Can&#x27;t Hardly Stand It&quot; was featured on the follow-up &quot;Kill Bill: Volume 2&quot; soundtrack, as well as the highly successful video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot;. A brief bit of &quot;Can&#x27;t Hardly Stand It&quot; was also featured in the 2013 film &quot;Only Lovers Left Alive&quot;.
Charlie Feathers&#x27; pioneering contribution to the genre has been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. Bob Dylan has featured Charlie Feathers on the second season of his XM satellite radio show &quot;Theme Time Radio Hour&quot;, playing Feathers&#x27; records &quot;One Hand Loose&quot; (on the &quot;Countdown&quot; show, Dec. 12, 2007) and &quot;Defrost Your Heart&quot; (on the &quot;Cold&quot; show, April 2, 2008). His song &quot;Can&#x27;t Hardly Stand It&quot; is featured in the video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot; on the game&#x27;s radio station, Rebel Radio. Feathers is an inductee in the Mississippi Musicians Hall of Fame.

<text>Marcel Lajos Breuer ( ; ; 21 May 1902 – 1 July 1981) was a Hungarian-German modernist architect and furniture designer. He moved to the United States in 1937 and became a naturalized American citizen in 1944.

At the Bauhaus he designed the Wassily Chair and the Cesca Chair, which &quot;The New York Times&quot; have called some of the most important chairs of the 20th century. Breuer extended the sculpture vocabulary he had developed in the carpentry shop at the Bauhaus into a personal architecture that made him one of the world&#x27;s most popular architects at the peak of 20th-century design. His work includes art museums, libraries, college buildings, office buildings, and residences. Many are in a Brutalist architecture style, including the former IBM Research and Development facility which was the birthplace of the first personal computer. He is regarded as one of the great innovators of modern furniture design and one of the most-influential exponents of the International Style.

==Life, work and inventions==

Commonly known to his friends and associates as Lajkó ( ; the diminutive of his middle name), Breuer was born in Pécs, Hungary, to a Jewish family. He was forced to renounce his faith in order to marry Marta Erps due to anti-Semitism in Germany at the time.

===Bauhaus===
Marcel Breuer left his workplace at the age of 18 in search of artistic training and, after a short period spent at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna, became one of the first and youngest students at the Bauhaus – a radical arts and crafts school that Walter Gropius had founded in Weimar just after the First World War. He was recognized by Gropius as a significant talent and was quickly put at the head of the Bauhaus carpentry shop. Gropius was to remain a lifelong mentor for a man who was 19 years his junior.

After the school moved from Weimar to Dessau in 1925, Breuer returned from a brief sojourn in Paris to join older faculty members such as Josef Albers, Wassily Kandinsky, and Paul Klee as a Master, eventually teaching in its newly established department of architecture.

Recognized for his invention of bicycle-handlebar-inspired tubular steel furniture, Breuer lived off his design fees at a time in the late 1920s and early 1930s when the architectural commissions he was looking for were few and far-between. The structural characteristics of his wooden furniture showed the influence of Dutch designers Gerrit Rietveld and Theo van Doesburg. He was known to such giants as Le Corbusier and Mies van der Rohe, whose architectural vocabulary he was later to adapt as part of his own, but hardly considered an equal by them who were his senior by 15 and 16 years. Despite the widespread popular belief that one of the most famous of Breuer&#x27;s tubular steel chairs, the Wassily Chair was designed for Breuer&#x27;s friend Wassily Kandinsky, it was not; Kandinsky admired Breuer&#x27;s finished chair design, and only then did Breuer make an additional copy for Kandinsky&#x27;s use in his home. When the chair was re-released in the 1960s, it was named &quot;Wassily&quot; by its Italian manufacturer, who had learned that Kandinsky had been the recipient of one of the earliest post-prototype units.

It was Gropius who assigned Breuer interiors at the 1927 Weissenhof Estate. In 1928 he opened a practice in Berlin, devoted himself to interior design and furniture design and in 1932 he built his first house, the Harnischmacher in Wiesbaden. The house was white, with two floors and a flat roof; part of it and the terraces rose freely on supports.

===London===
In 1935, at Gropius&#x27;s suggestion, Breuer relocated to London.

While in London, Breuer was employed by Jack Pritchard at the Isokon company, one of the earliest proponents of modern design in the United Kingdom. Breuer designed his Long Chair as well as experimenting with bent and formed plywood, inspired by designs by Finnish architect Alvar Aalto. Between 1935 and 1937, he worked in practice with the English Modernist F. R. S. Yorke, with whom he designed a number of houses. After a brief time as the Isokon&#x27;s head of design in 1937, he emigrated to the United States.

===Massachusetts===
In 1937, Gropius accepted the appointment as chairman of Harvard&#x27;s Graduate School of Design and again Breuer followed his mentor to join the faculty in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The two men formed a partnership that was to greatly influence the establishment of an American way of designing modern houses – spread by their great collection of wartime students including Paul Rudolph, Eliot Noyes, I. M. Pei, Ulrich Franzen, John Johansen, and Philip Johnson. One of the most intact examples of Breuer&#x27;s furniture and interior design work during this period is the Frank House in Pittsburgh, designed with Gropius as a Gesamtkunstwerk.

Breuer broke with his father-figure, Walter Gropius, in 1941 over a very minor issue but the major reason may have been to get himself out from under the better-known name that dominated their practice. Breuer had married their secretary, Constance Crocker Leighton, and after a few more years in Cambridge, moved down to New York City in 1946 (with Harry Seidler as his chief draftsman) to establish a practice that was centered there for the rest of his life. He became a naturalized American citizen in 1944.

===New York City===

The Geller House I of 1945 (demolished in 2022) was one of the first to employ Breuer&#x27;s concept of the &#x27;binuclear&#x27; house, with separate wings for the bedrooms and for the living / dining / kitchen area, separated by an entry hall, and with the distinctive &#x27;butterfly&#x27; roof (two opposing roof surfaces sloping towards the middle, centrally drained) that became part of the popular modernist style vocabulary. Breuer built two houses for himself in New Canaan, Connecticut: one from 1947 to 1948, and the other from 1951 to 1952. A demonstration house set up in the MoMA garden in 1949 caused a flurry of interest in the architect&#x27;s work, and an appreciation written by Peter Blake. When the show was over, the &quot;House in the Garden&quot; was dismantled and barged up the Hudson River for reassembly on the Rockefeller property, Kykuit, in Pocantico Hills, New York. In 1948, Ariston Club, Breuer&#x27;s only work in Latin America, was built in Mar del Plata, Argentina.

His first two important institutional buildings were the UNESCO Headquarters in Paris, finished in 1955, and the monastic Master Plan and Church at Saint John&#x27;s Abbey in Minnesota in 1954 (again, in part, on the recommendation of Gropius, a &quot;competitor&quot; for the job, who told the monks they needed a younger man who could finish the job.) These commissions were a turning point in Breuer&#x27;s career: a move to larger projects after years of residential commissions and the beginning of Breuer&#x27;s adoption of concrete as his primary medium.

Breuer was a supporter of the Council for the Advancement of the Negro in Architecture (CANA) and employed Beverly Lorraine Greene, the first African-American woman to be licensed as an architect in the United States. She is credited as draftsperson on a number of projects Breuer worked on in the 1950s including the Grosse Pointe Public Library.

In 1966, Breuer completed the Whitney Museum of American Art at 945 Madison Avenue on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper East Side. The Whitney collection maintained its home in the Breuer-designed building from 1966 to 2014, before moving to a new building designed by Renzo Piano at 99 Gansevoort Street in the West Village/Meatpacking District neighborhoods of Lower Manhattan.

Breuer designed the Washington, D.C., headquarters building for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, which was completed in 1968. While the building received some initial praise, in recent decades it has received widespread criticism. Former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Jack Kemp once described the building as &quot;10 floors of basement.&quot; Another former Secretary, Shaun Donovan, has noted that &quot;the building itself is among the most reviled in all of Washington—and with good reason.&quot; Many critics have argued that Breuer&#x27;s design is unoriginal, and essentially mimics the UNESCO Headquarters and IBM Research Center which he designed several years earlier.

Throughout the almost 30 years and nearly 100 buildings that followed, Breuer worked with a number of partners and associates with whom he openly and insistently shared design credit: Pier Luigi Nervi at UNESCO; Herbert Beckhard, Robert Gatje, Hamilton Smith and Tician Papachristou in New York, Mario Jossa and Harry Seidler in Paris. Their contribution to his life work has largely been credited properly, though the critics and public rightly recognized a &quot;Breuer Building&quot; when they saw one.

Breuer&#x27;s architectural vocabulary moved through at least four recognizable phases:

#The white box and glass school of the International style that he adapted for his early houses in Europe and the USA: the Harnischmacher House, Gropius House, Frank House, and his own first house in Lincoln, Massachusetts.
#The punctured wooden walls that characterized his famous 1948 &quot;House in the Garden&quot; for MoMA and a series of relatively modest houses for knowledgeable university faculty families in the 50s. This included the first of his houses in New Canaan, Connecticut, with its balcony hung off a cantilever.
#The modular prefabricated concrete panel façades that first enclosed his favorite IBM Laboratory in La Gaude, near Nice, France, and went on to be used in many of his institutional buildings plus the whole town at Flaine. Some critics spoke of repetitiveness but Breuer quoted a professional friend: &quot;I can&#x27;t design a whole new system every Monday morning.&quot;
#The stone and shaped concrete that he used for unique and memorable commissions: his best-known project, the Met Breuer (formerly the Whitney Museum of American Art), the St. Francis de Sales and St. John&#x27;s Abbey Churches, the Atlanta Central Library, and his second house in New Canaan.

Breuer was awarded the Gold Medal of the American Institute of Architects at their 100th annual convention in 1968 at Portland, Oregon. In an ironic timing of events, it coincided with general criticism of one of America&#x27;s favorite architects for his willingness to design a multi-story office building on top of Grand Central Terminal. The project was never built. It cost him many friends and supporters although its defeat by the US Supreme Court established the right of New York and other cities to protect their landmarks. During his lifetime, Breuer rarely acknowledged the influence of other architects&#x27; work upon his own but he had certainly picked up the use of rough board-formed concrete from Le Corbusier and the noble dignity of his second New Canaan house seems to have directly descended from Mies&#x27; Barcelona Pavilion. Shortly before his death, he told an interviewer that he considered his principal contribution to have been the adaptation of the work of older architects to the needs of modern society. He died in his apartment in Manhattan in 1981, leaving his wife Connie (died 2002) and his son Tamas. With his permission, his partners kept offices going in his name in Paris and New York for several years but, with their eventual retirement, both are now closed.

==Breuer&#x27;s work==

Breuer donated his professional papers and drawings to Syracuse University library beginning in the late 1960s. The remainder of his papers, including most of his personal correspondence, were donated to the Archives of American Art, Washington, D.C., between 1985 and 1999 by Breuer&#x27;s wife, Constance.

==Legacy==
The National Building Museum in Washington, D.C., held an exhibition in 2007–2008 dedicated to the work of Marcel Breuer titled &quot;Marcel Breuer: Design and Architecture&quot;.

Filmmaker James Crump has directed &quot;Breuer&#x27;s Bohemia&quot;, a feature documentary film that examines Breuer&#x27;s experimental house designs in New England following the Second World War.

Breuer was a partial inspiration for the character of László Tóth in Brady Corbet&#x27;s film &quot;The Brutalist&quot;. Several of Tóth&#x27;s furniture designs in the film are highly reminiscent of Breuer&#x27;s work, including the Cesca Chair and Long Chair.

<text>Confidential was an American magazine considered a pioneer in scandal, gossip and exposé journalism. Founded by Robert Harrison, it was published quarterly from December 1952 to August 1953 and then bi-monthly until it ceased publication in 1978.

==Origins==

===&quot;New York Graphic&quot;===
Following World War II, Robert Harrison, a New York City publisher of men&#x27;s magazines, decided to return to investigative journalism. He was previously a reporter on the &quot;New York Evening Graphic&quot; (1924–1932), an ancestor of the supermarket tabloids that would emerge in the 1960s. Called &quot;The Porno-Graphic&quot; by detractors for its emphasis on sex, crime and violence, it provided many of the themes that Harrison would use as publisher of &quot;Confidential&quot;. When Harrison started as a copyboy at the paper, he met the theater critic, Walter Winchell, who would later promote the future magazine.

===&quot;Motion Picture Herald&quot;===
After the &quot;New York Graphic&quot; shut down, Harrison moved to the editorial staff of the &quot;Motion Picture Herald&quot;, a film trade publication whose conservative Catholic owner, Martin Quigley, Sr., helped create the Motion Picture Production Code. Though Harrison was more interested in Broadway and New York social life, his tenure at the &quot;Herald&quot; would bias the direction of the future &quot;Confidential&quot; toward Hollywood.

Having learned from Quigley what he could get away with legally, Harrison struck out on his own with a series of non-pornographic &quot;cheesecake&quot; magazines. His first was &quot;Beauty Parade&quot; (1941–1956), started in October 1941. Using the facilities of Quigley Publishing surreptitiously at night, Harrison used publicity photos collected from a visit to the company&#x27;s Hollywood offices to paste together his galleries. When he was caught and fired on Christmas Eve 1941, his sisters Edith Tobias and Helen Studin rallied around him and raised several thousand dollars in capital, $400 of it from his favorite niece, Marjorie Tobias, who would later become a central figure in his most famous enterprise. Harrison had great success with &quot;Beauty Parade&quot; and five sister magazines, but their circulation declined in the post-war years. Harrison had a distaste for full nudity and refused to follow the trend of magazines such as &quot;Playboy&quot;. By early 1952 his accountant told him that he was broke.

===&quot;Eyewitness&quot;===
In 1947, Harrison &quot;mocked up a &#x27;fact&#x27; magazine called &quot;Eyewitness&quot;,&quot; which was never published. It would not be until 1952 that financial pressure forced Harrison to put serious effort in a new magazine. Harrison spent six months reworking the format of another factual magazine. He would later say: &quot;I must have ripped that thing apart three times before I published it, and it still wasn&#x27;t right.&quot; Supposedly inspired by Virginia Hill&#x27;s testimony to the Kefauver Committee hearings, Harrison finally launched his tabloid-style gossip magazine: &quot;Confidential&quot;. &quot;The name came from a series of exposé books by Lee Mortimer and Jack Lait.&quot; As with the earlier &quot;New York Graphic&quot;, it concentrated on exposing the substance abuse habits, criminal records and hidden political and sexual preferences of celebrities. Though Harrison would publish non-show business stories involving &quot;racketeering, consumer scams and politicians&#x27; peccadilloes,&quot; like Quigley Publishing that he previously worked for, the emphasis was Hollywood, but with a twist—&quot;exposés of star secrets&quot; became &quot;Confidential&quot;″s prime focus.

==Early years==
===Begins publication===
The first &quot;Confidential&quot; issue was dated December (released November) 1952 under the caption &quot;The Lid Is Off!&quot; Its circulation was 250,000 copies. But when the breakup of Marilyn Monroe&#x27;s marriage to Joe DiMaggio was reported in the August 1953 issue (&quot;Why Joe DiMaggio Is Striking Out with Marilyn Monroe!&quot;), the circulation jumped to 800,000. The quarterly magazine then became bimonthly and was the fastest growing magazine in the United States at the time. Harrison would claim its circulation reached four million, and because every copy was estimated to be read by ten persons, it might have reached a fifth of the US population.

&quot;The &quot;Confidential&quot; house style was laden with elaborate, pun-inflected alliteration and allowed stories to suggest, rather than state, the existence of scandal.&quot; But if Harrison had sworn affidavits or photographic/audio proof, the story would go beyond innuendo (unlike an earlier Hollywood scandal publisher, Frederic Girnau of the &quot;Coast Reporter&quot;—who was tried for libeling Clara Bow—Harrison usually protected himself with signed affidavits). Film historian Mary Desjardins described &quot;Confidential&quot;″s editorial style as using &quot;research methods and writing techniques that recycled old stories or created &#x27;composite&#x27; facts as the basis of new ones.&quot; Robert Harrison himself described it thus: &quot;Once we establish the star in the hay and that&#x27;s documented, we can say anything we want and I think we make them a hell of a lot more interesting than they really are. What&#x27;s a guy gonna do, sue us and admit he was in the hay with the dame, but claim he didn&#x27;t do all the other things we dress the story with?&quot; After the &quot;facts&quot; of an article were assembled, a staff of four (headed by associate editor Jay Breen) would rewrite it several times to achieve &quot;Confidential&quot;″s &quot;toboggan ride&quot; style: &quot;racy and free of embroidery, keeps the reader on the edge of his seat.&quot; The final product would be read aloud at a staff meeting for euphony.

When Harrison published &quot;Winchell Was Right About Josephine Baker!&quot;, he came out in support of his childhood mentor at the &quot;Graphic&quot; during the Stork Club controversy. Winchell returned the favor by mentioning &quot;Confidential&quot; in his newspaper column and television and radio broadcasts.

Harrison would rent 4,000 square feet of office space at 1697 Broadway in New York City, but never had more than 15 staff members, mostly family relations of whom the most important were his sisters Edith Tobias and Helen Studin. He would also move into an even more luxurious apartment at the Hotel Madison cooperative on East 58th Street. From his two new headquarters, Harrison developed a Hollywood network of informants—prostitutes, hotel employees, down-on-their-luck actors and vengeful celebrities—working with local detective agencies such as the Fred Otash Detective Bureau and H. L. Von Wittenburg&#x27;s Hollywood Detective Agency. Among the informants were minor actresses such as Francesca De Scaffa (ex-wife of Bruce Cabot) and Ronnie Quillan (ex-wife of screenwriter Joseph Quillan). According to Harrison, Barbara Payton would stop by &quot;Confidential&quot;″s Hollywood office and sell a story whenever she was short of cash. However, the informants could rise to the level of prominent Hollywood columnists such as Florabel Muir and in some cases, all the way up to a producer such as Mike Todd or even a studio head such as Harry Cohn. Money, publicity, revenge or blackmail was the lure.

Contrary to the popular legend that the magazine double-checked its facts before publishing its articles, as well as being vetted by &quot;Confidential&quot;″s lawyers as &quot;suit-proof,&quot; the later 1957 court case would show otherwise. Despite spending over $100,000 a year having a Manhattan law firm, &quot;Becker, Ross, and Stone to vet each story,&quot; Harrison would still ignore the lawyers&#x27; warnings, as in the case of the article on Maureen O&#x27;Hara. But Harrison had further safeguards in place. In addition to articles being vetted by lawyers and sworn affidavits or photographic/audio proof of claims, Harrison compartmentalized both the printing and distribution channels. Though the editorial content was prepared in the New York offices, the magazine itself was printed in Chicago by an independent contractor (Kable Publishing of Mount Morris, Illinois). The copies were sold before they came off the presses and neither Confidential Inc. nor the printer had any corporate connection to the chain of &quot;distributors, wholesalers and retailers that provided &quot;Confidential&quot; to all those people who claimed they only read it at the beauty parlor or the barbershop.&quot;

===Success===
Harrison soon started making approximately $500,000 per issue. By 1955, &quot;Confidential&quot; had reached a circulation of five million copies per issue with larger sales than &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;, &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot;, &quot;Look&quot;, &quot;The Saturday Evening Post,&quot; or &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;. That year Harrison shut down all his men&#x27;s magazines except &quot;Beauty Parade&quot; and &quot;Whisper&quot;. &quot;Beauty Parade&quot; would cease the next year and &quot;Whisper&quot; would continue as &quot;Confidential&quot;″s sister publication, which recycled variants of &quot;Confidential&quot;″s stories.

===Rushmore===
A former film reviewer for the communist &quot;Daily Worker&quot;, Howard Rushmore was fired for a too-favorable review of &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot;. He moved to the &quot;New York Journal-American&quot; and became an active anti-communist. He later became director of research for Senator Joseph McCarthy&#x27;s Subcommittee on Investigations in 1953. After a dispute with the subcommittee&#x27;s chief counsel, Roy Cohn, Rushmore resigned. At the &quot;Journal-American&quot;, Rushmore criticized Cohn in print and was fired from the paper. Then his mentor, Walter Winchell, gained for him a new editorial job. Under Winchell&#x27;s sponsorship, Howard Rushmore became the chief editor of &quot;Confidential.&quot;

Rushmore, having earned the enmity of McCarthyite papers like those of the Hearst chain, found himself cut off from his usual employment. Rushmore hoped to use &quot;Confidential&quot; as a new venue to expose communists, though he often had to settle for suspected Hollywood fellow travellers, who were implied in stories to be sexual &quot;deviates.&quot; While his anti-communist hit pieces were bylined under his own name, he used a host of pseudonyms for Hollywood exposés, such as &quot;Juan Morales&quot; for &quot;The Lavender Skeletons in TV&#x27;s Closet&quot; and &quot;Hollywood—Where Men Are Men, and Women, Too!&quot;, or &quot;Brooks Martin&quot; for the Zsa Zsa Gabor story &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Fooled by the Glamour Pusses.&quot; Beside Rushmore-authored pieces unmasking communists and homosexuals in Washington and Hollywood, he also wrote how-to articles on divorce and conducting extra-marital affairs, echoing his past relationships with his two wives.

In January 1955, Rushmore flew to Los Angeles to confer with old Harrison informants like De Scaffa and Quillan. He also recruited new ones like Mike Connolly of the &quot;Hollywood Reporter&quot; and Agnes Underwood of the &quot;Los Angeles Herald Express&quot;. One of Rushmore&#x27;s most prolific discoveries was United Press columnist Aline Mosby. Despite his high salary, Rushmore was repelled by the informants and Harrison. Rushmore considered his employer a &quot;pornographer,&quot; though Rushmore himself was a collector of erotica. Harrison communicated with his West Coast network by telegram and phone. But in the rising face of legal threats from the film industry, Harrison would make his boldest move yet.

===Hollywood Research Inc.===
Hollywood Research Inc. was the new intelligence-gathering front of &quot;Confidential&quot;, run by Marjorie Meade, Robert Harrison&#x27;s now 26-year-old niece. Despite her youth and red-headed beauty, she was one of the most feared persons in Hollywood after her arrival in January 1955. John Mitchum, the younger brother of Robert Mitchum, tried to infiltrate Hollywood Research under the guidance of attorney Jerry Giesler. John, pretending to have scandalous information on his brother, described a visit to Fred Otash, where he was taken to &quot;a ground floor apartment in a luxury apartment building in Beverley Hills, the offices, it turned out, of Hollywood Research Inc., command central for &quot;Confidential&quot;″s fact-gathering and surveillance agents. The place was filled with big, tough looking guys, and some of them looked like they were packing heat. There were desks around the apartment topped with phones and recording and listening devices and files and photographs. John was taken to the head tough guy and recognized him—it was Fred Otash, a notorious ex-Los Angeles policeman turned private eye, Hollywood fixer, problem solver, leg breaker, a big mean Lebanese, looked like Joe McCarthy with muscle.&quot; The Harrison enterprise had evolved into a &quot;quasi-blackmail operation.&quot; Once a proposed story was assembled, it could be published outright. Or more typically, either Meade or an agent would visit the subject and present a copy as a &quot;buy-back&quot; proposal, or the story be held back for in exchange for information on other celebrities. But instead of paying the magazine not to publish an article about themselves or implicating others, two actors, Lizabeth Scott and Robert Mitchum, sued. Their attorney was Jerry Giesler, who also represented tobacco heiress Doris Duke.

===Two hoaxes===
On July 8, 1955, Rushmore appeared on &quot;The Tom Duggan Show&quot; in Chicago. He claimed on air that he was on a secret mission to uncover the communist assassins of former Secretary of Defense James Forrestal. Rushmore told the viewers that the leader of the &quot;Chicago Communist Party,&quot; whose name was given as &quot;Lazarovich,&quot; was in hiding and that Rushmore needed their help in locating him. Rushmore later disappeared from his hotel room, leading to a nationwide manhunt by the FBI. As the nation speculated that Rushmore was either kidnapped or murdered by communists, he was discovered hiding under the name &quot;H. Roberts&quot; at the Hotel Finlen in Butte, Montana. Meanwhile, news reporters found &quot;Lazarovich&quot; living in Manhattan under his real name of William Lazar. Associate Director of the FBI, Clyde Tolson, wrote in the margin of a report on the disappearance: &quot;Rushmore must be a &#x27;nut.&#x27; We should have nothing to do with him.&quot; J. Edgar Hoover added in the margin: &quot;I certainly agree.&quot;

Rushmore&#x27;s second marriage was deteriorating. In addition to Rushmore&#x27;s amphetamine habit, he became an alcoholic as did his wife. On Monday, September 5, 1955, Frances Rushmore jumped into the East River in a suicide attempt, but was rescued by an air terminal worker. Meanwhile, Rushmore tried to get Harrison to publish a story about former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt having an alleged affair with her African American chauffeur. When Harrison refused, Rushmore quit. By early February 1956, Rushmore was reportedly an editor at the &quot;National Police Gazette&quot;.

The next spring, despite Giesler&#x27;s reassurances to the press, the legal effort against &quot;Confidential&quot; would go nowhere. Since the magazine was domiciled in New York State, and the plaintiffs were California residents who initiated the suits in their own state, the suits were stopped. On March 7, 1956, Los Angeles Supreme Court judge Leon T. David quashed Lizabeth Scott&#x27;s suit on grounds that the magazine was not published in California. Despite this setback, in addition to Scott&#x27;s suit, &quot;Giesler said he also would refile in New York a $2 million suit by actor Robert Mitchum against the magazine if it also is quashed here.&quot; Though Giesler&#x27;s initial attack failed, lawsuits from other actors continued to pile up—they would eventually total $40 million.

In September 1956, Harrison generated front-page headlines around the world when he allegedly was shot in the shoulder during a safari in the Dominican Republic by Richard Weldy, a travel agency owner and former executive for Pan American Grace Airways. Harrison claimed to be searching for Paga Palo (Rhynchosia pyranzidalis)—a vine used to restore virility in males, which was the subject of a January 1957 &quot;Confidential&quot; article. The shooter, Weldy, variously described as a &quot;jungle trapper and guide&quot; or &quot;a big game hunter,&quot; purportedly harbored a grudge over a &quot;Confidential&quot; story about his ex-wife, Pilar Pallete, a Peruvian actress who was then married to John Wayne. The nonexistent &quot;Confidential&quot; article depicted Pallete as having an affair with Wayne while married to Weldy. According to newspaper accounts, Weldy fled the scene, leaving Harrison to die alone in the jungle with his blonde girlfriend; the two were eventually rescued by either the Dominican Army or local police and boy scouts. Newspapers reported that Weldy was later arrested by police. But Harrison refused to press charges against Weldy and the two publicly reconciled. Later the whole story was revealed to be a hoax—the shooting never took place. Photos of a wounded Harrison in a hospital were staged, complete with an actor playing a physician. Even the &quot;girlfriend&quot; was an actress that Harrison hired for the publicity stunt. During a television interview with Mike Wallace, Harrison fooled the CBS film crew into thinking that a birthmark on his back was the bullet wound.

===1957 California Criminal Libel Prosecution===
The movie industry was constantly engaged in ways to suppress the stream of stories coming from &quot;Confidential&quot;. They approached a California District Attorney about prosecuting the publication for criminal libel, which was a misdemeanor in California at the time. Criminal libels trials were rare, and have since been eliminated by the courts. &quot;Confidential&quot; was charged with conspiracy to commit criminal libel, which was a felony even though the underlying crime was a misdemeanor. This distinction helped the prosecution to enforce subpoenas and extradition requests which were not available for misdemeanor charges.

Back in New York, Rushmore used his severance pay from &quot;Confidential&quot; to buy an air ticket to California, where he contacted Giesler&#x27;s office. Rushmore offered to become a witness in exchange for a job in Hollywood, but Giesler refused. Then Rushmore became a witness for California Attorney General Pat Brown. On Wednesday, May 15, 1957, a Los Angeles grand jury investigating &quot;Confidential&quot; indicted 11 individuals—Robert Harrison (publisher and sole owner of &quot;Confidential&quot; Inc.), Francesca De Scaffa, Harrison&#x27;s niece Marjorie Meade (president and sole owner of Hollywood Research Inc.) and her husband Fred Meade (secretary-treasurer of Hollywood Research Inc.), Harrison&#x27;s sister Edith Tobias (Harrison&#x27;s secretary) and her son Michael Tobias (vice-president of Hollywood Research), Harrison&#x27;s sister Helen Studin (office manager of &quot;Confidential&quot;) and her husband Daniel Studin (circulation manager of &quot;Confidential&quot;), and &quot;Confidential&quot; managing editor A. P. Govani. In addition, two Illinois publishing executives, Robert Kable and Richard Cox of Kable Publishing, which printed Harrison&#x27;s magazines under contract, were also indicted.

The five corporations listed in the indictments were Confidential Inc., Whisper Inc., Publishers Distributing Corp. of New York, Kable Publishing Inc. of Illinois and Hollywood Research Inc. of Los Angeles. But the magazines and main distributor were ensconced in New York state, and New York refused to let Brown extradite Harrison and the others to California. Illinois also refused to cooperate with the Attorney General. Brown eventually put Marjorie and Fred Meade on trial.

The Meades were actually in New York City at the time of the grand jury indictments and originally intended not to participate in the California trial—libel was not an extraditable offense under New York state law. But Harrison, seeing an opportunity of a lifetime for front-page headlines, wanted to avoid a trial in absentia and encouraged the Meades to return to Los Angeles with defense attorney Arthur Crowley to plead their case. Crowley&#x27;s strategy was simple: put subjects of &quot;Confidential&quot;″s stories on the witness stand and ask them under oath if the stories were true. Film industry executives, who previously tried to convince Pat Brown to charge Robert Harrison with conspiracy to publish criminal libel, now tried to backpedal for fear of adverse publicity from what would be &quot;heralded by the press as the &#x27;Trial of a Hundred Stars&#x27;.&quot; But Brown would have none of it—on August 7, 1957, &quot;The People of the State of California v. Robert Harrison et al.&quot; trial began. It would eventually involve over 200 members of the film industry, most of whom fled California to avoid defense subpoenas.

Rushmore, now the state&#x27;s star witness, testified that the magazine knowingly published unverified allegations, despite the magazine&#x27;s reputation for double-checking facts: &quot;Some of the stories are true and some have nothing to back them up at all. Harrison many times overruled his libel attorneys and went ahead on something.&quot; According to Rushmore, Harrison told the attorneys, &quot;I&#x27;d go out of business if I printed the kind of stuff you guys want.&quot; Rushmore even fingered Aline Mosby, who was in the press galleries covering the trial for the newspaper wire service called United Press. It was revealed that Mosby wrote more than 24 stories for &quot;Confidential&quot;. United Press replaced the disgraced Mosby with another reporter.

During the trial, two witnesses for the defense unexpectedly died. Private detective Polly Gould was found dead in her apartment of disputed causes. She was a former investigator for &quot;Confidential&quot; and &quot;Whisper&quot;. The previous week, Mae West&#x27;s alleged love interest in &quot;Confidential&quot;″s &quot;Mae West&#x27;s Open Door Policy&quot;, Chalky Wright, was found dead in a bathtub before he could testify that the story was factual.

Harrison&#x27;s attorneys tried to give witnesses (who were also plaintiffs in other lawsuits against Harrison) a face-saving exit with token out-of-court settlements, such as the May 1957 $10,000 settlement with Dorothy Dandridge. After cashing Harrison&#x27;s check, Dandridge testified for the prosecution anyway. Three of the most prominent witnesses for the prosecution—Liberace, Errol Flynn and Maureen O&#x27;Hara—refused to settle out-of-court. O’Hara and Dandridge were the only actors who testified, and a daily newspaper called the &quot;Los Angeles Examiner&quot; ran a photograph of them shaking hands in a hallway of the courthouse.

At the end of the trial the jury was sequestered at the five star Mayflower Hotel. The jury set a new state record in deliberation time while enjoying Mayflower&#x27;s amenities. After 15 days it was declared that the jury could not reach a verdict. After a mistrial was declared on October 1, 1957, Liberace, Flynn and O&#x27;Hara would give up on their own individual lawsuits. But Pat Brown preempted &quot;Confidential&quot;″s win by calling for a retrial. Harrison was rattled. To spare his niece another ordeal—and the danger of three-years&#x27; imprisonment—Harrison promised the Attorney General to publish only positive stories.

===Later years===
Harrison&#x27;s publicity stunt backfired. The deal with Brown became the effective end of &quot;Confidential&quot; and &quot;Whisper&quot;, as the magazines were no longer able to publish their usual scandalous stories. The magazines&#x27; one and only trial cost Harrison over $500,000—in addition to legal fees of $500,000 and a $5,000 fine for each magazine, Maureen O&#x27;Hara settled out-of-court for an undisclosed sum on July 1, 1958; Errol Flynn settled on July 8, 1958 for $15,000; and on July 16, 1958, Liberace settled for $40,000, an amount that the pianist might typically exceed with one or two performances. In addition to the legal fees and settlements, Harrison gave the Meades $150,000 as a gift. Harrison was still a multimillionaire.

But the Hollywood informant network was in a shambles, mainly due to Howard Rushmore&#x27;s courtroom revelations. Characteristically of Harrison, he bore no ill will toward Rushmore, who by 1957 was reduced to writing occasional articles on hunting for outdoors magazines. In December 1957, Rushmore chased his wife Frances and teenaged step-daughter Lynn out of their Manhattan home with a shotgun. While Frances was under psychiatric care since the East River incident, Howard himself was now under psychiatric care.

On January 3, 1958, at 6:15 pm, the Rushmores met in a final attempt at a reconciliation inside the lobby of their apartment building. An argument broke out between the couple and Frances exited the lobby and hailed a taxi. Simultaneously, Howard entered the cab. As the two continued arguing, the cab driver raced to the 23rd Precinct at Third and 104th. Suddenly, the driver heard three gunshots fired inside the cab. Rushmore had shot his wife in the right side of the head and neck then put the pistol to his temple and shot himself. Harrison heard about the murder-suicide when a taxicab picked him up at Idlewild Airport. The driver told Harrison that the publisher of &quot;Confidential&quot; just killed himself and his wife, momentarily confusing the unmarried Harrison. Later Harrison refused to believe the suicide narrative and thought Howard Rushmore was murdered. He remained loyal to Rushmore even after the California trial and the Rushmores&#x27; scandalous deaths.

The once biggest-selling magazine in the United States plunged to a circulation of 200,000, smaller than its December 1952 début. The rights to &quot;Whisper&quot; and &quot;Confidential&quot; were sold off in May 1958 for $25,000. The buyer, Hy Steirman, further toned down the content of both magazines. But Harrison remained in publishing. In 1963 he started a much smaller magazine called &quot;Inside News&quot; (in which he authored &quot;Who Really Killed Howard Rushmore?&quot;), as well as one-shot publications like &quot;New York Confidential&quot;. Harrison continued to live in New York City during the next two decades under an assumed name, while plotting a comeback. But lacking the financial pressures that drove Harrison to create his previous magazines, he was essentially retired, living his remaining years at &quot;the Delmonico Hotel, at 59th Street and Park Avenue.&quot; Robert Harrison died in 1978 with his long-time mistress, Regi Ruta, at his side; that same year &quot;Confidential&quot; was shut down.

== Legal activity ==
* Following a highly-unflattering article about Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista, an attempt was made to ban the magazine from sale in Cuba.
* In the May 1955 issue of &quot;Confidential&quot;, &quot;Doris Duke and Her African Prince&quot; appeared. The story alleged that Doris Duke had an affair with a &quot;Negro handyman and chauffeur,&quot; whom the article said she once employed. In July 1955, Doris Duke sued the magazine for $3 million, claiming libel.
* In August 1955, US Postmaster General Arthur Summerfield barred &quot;Confidential&quot; from the mails. &quot;Post Office officials objected to among other things, a racy description of a stripteaser&#x27;s gyrations and a &#x27;questionable&#x27; cheesecake photograph of Hollywood Starlet Terry Moore,&quot; originally appearing in the Istanbul, French-language newspaper, &quot;Millyet&quot;.
* Frank Sinatra, subject of a May 1956 &quot;Confidential&quot; story, &quot;Open Letter To General Mills: Here&#x27;s Why Frank Sinatra Is The Tarzan Of The Boudoir,&quot; threatened to sue &quot;Confidential&quot; for a story about how Wheaties allegedly enhanced his sex life.
* The July 1957 issue featured a cover story on Liberace headlined &quot;Why Liberace&#x27;s theme song should be &#x27;Mad About The Boy&#x27;.&quot; It alleged that the actor had a homosexual dalliance with a press agent in Dallas. Liberace testified before the Los Angeles grand jury but was not called to testify at the actual 1957 trial.
* Tab Hunter, subject of a September 1955 &quot;Confidential&quot; story, &quot;The Lowdown On That &#x27;Disorderly Conduct&#x27; Charge Against Tab Hunter!&quot; was &quot;on &#x27;two-hour call status&#x27; for the duration of the trial,&quot; but was not called to testify.
* Maureen O&#x27;Hara, subject of a March 1957 &quot;Confidential&quot; story, &quot;It was the hottest show in town when Maureen O&#x27;Hara Cuddled in Row 35,&quot; testified before the Los Angeles grand jury. She and Dorothy Dandridge were the only subjects of &quot;Confidential&quot; stories who were called to testify at the 1957 trial.

== Impact ==
Due to &quot;Confidential&quot;″s success, competing magazines soon were created—&quot;Exclusive&quot;, &quot;Exposed&quot;, &quot;Hush-Hush&quot;, &quot;Inside&quot;, &quot;On The Q.T.&quot;, &quot;Rave&quot;, &quot;Revealed&quot;, &quot;Side Street&quot;, &quot;The Lowdown&quot;, and &quot;Uncensored.&quot; All of these magazines had striking slogans in the &quot;Confidential&quot; &quot;Uncensored And Off The Record&quot; tradition: &quot;All The Facts...All The Names&quot; (&quot;Exposed&quot; and &quot;Uncensored&quot;), &quot;What You Don’t Know About The People You Know&quot; (&quot;Hush-Hush&quot;), &quot;Stories The Newspapers Won’t Print!&quot; (&quot;On The Q.T.&quot;), &quot;Great Moments of Passion!&quot; (&quot;Side Street&quot;), &quot;The Facts They Dare Not Tell You&quot; (&quot;The Lowdown&quot;). Today, the only &quot;Confidential&quot;-inspired supermarket tabloids in the U.S. that remain are &quot;National Enquirer&quot;, &quot;Globe&quot;, &quot;InTouch Weekly&quot;, &quot;OK!&quot;, and &quot;Life &amp; Style&quot;. Television tabloid shows such as &quot;A Current Affair&quot; and &quot;Hard Copy&quot; are also inspired by the tabloid, as well as the celebrity news and gossip website TMZ.

==Portrayal in other media==
Film historians usually assume that &quot;Confidential&quot; inspired the name of James Ellroy&#x27;s novel &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot;, although the magazine that is portrayed in the story is &quot;Hush-Hush&quot;. The novel became the basis of the film of the same title. 

The graphic design of the 1994 album Gratuitous Sax and Senseless Violins by Sparks is an homage to Confidential.

In July 2014, the New York Musical Theatre Festival opened &quot;Mr. Confidential&quot;, a musical starring Kevin Spirtas as Robert Harrison. The play&#x27;s title derived from Samuel Bernstein&#x27;s Robert Harrison biography of the same title.

<doc id="1174560" wikidata="Q908550" url="?curid=1174560" title="Open reading frame">
<text>In molecular biology, reading frames are defined as spans of DNA sequence between the start and stop codons. Usually, this is considered within a studied region of a prokaryotic DNA sequence, where only one of the six possible reading frames will be &quot;open&quot; (the &quot;reading&quot;, however, refers to the RNA produced by transcription of the DNA and its subsequent interaction with the ribosome in translation). Such an open reading frame (ORF) may contain a start codon (usually AUG in terms of RNA) and by definition cannot extend beyond a stop codon (usually UAA, UAG or UGA in RNA). That start codon (not necessarily the first) indicates where translation may start. The transcription termination site is located after the ORF, beyond the translation stop codon. If transcription were to cease before the stop codon, an incomplete protein would be made during translation.

In eukaryotic genes with multiple exons, introns are removed and exons are then joined together after transcription to yield the final mRNA for protein translation. In the context of gene finding, the start-stop definition of an ORF therefore only applies to spliced mRNAs, not genomic DNA, since introns may contain stop codons and/or cause shifts between reading frames. An alternative definition says that an ORF is a sequence that has a length divisible by three and is bounded by stop codons. This more general definition can be useful in the context of transcriptomics and metagenomics, where a start or stop codon may not be present in the obtained sequences. Such an ORF corresponds to parts of a gene rather than the complete gene.

==Biological significance==
One common use of open reading frames (ORFs) is as one piece of evidence to assist in gene prediction. Long ORFs are often used, along with other evidence, to initially identify candidate protein-coding regions or functional RNA-coding regions in a DNA sequence. The presence of an ORF does not necessarily mean that the region is always translated. For example, in a randomly generated DNA sequence with an equal percentage of each nucleotide, a stop-codon would be expected once every 21 codons. A simple gene prediction algorithm for prokaryotes might look for a start codon followed by an open reading frame that is long enough to encode a typical protein, where the codon usage of that region matches the frequency characteristic for the given organism&#x27;s coding regions. Therefore, some authors say that an ORF should have a minimal length, e.g. 100 codons or 150 codons. By itself even a long open reading frame is not conclusive evidence for the presence of a gene.

===Short open reading frames===
Some short open reading frames, also named small open reading frames, abbreviated as sORFs or smORFs, usually &lt; 100 codons in length, that lack the classical hallmarks of protein-coding genes (both from ncRNAs and mRNAs) can produce functional peptides. They encode microproteins or sORF‐encoded proteins (SEPs). The 5’-UTR of about 50% of mammal mRNAs are known to contain one or several sORFs, also called upstream ORFs or uORFs. However, less than 10% of the vertebrate mRNAs surveyed in an older study contained AUG codons in front of the major ORF. Interestingly, uORFs were found in two thirds of proto-oncogenes and related proteins. 64–75% of experimentally found translation initiation sites of sORFs are conserved in the genomes of human and mouse and may indicate that these elements have function. However, sORFs can often be found only in the minor forms of mRNAs and avoid selection; the high conservation of initiation sites may be connected with their location inside promoters of the relevant genes. This is characteristic of SLAMF1 gene, for example.

==Six-frame translation==
Since DNA is interpreted in groups of three nucleotides (codons), a DNA strand has three distinct reading frames. The double helix of a DNA molecule has two anti-parallel strands; with the two strands having three reading frames each, there are six possible frame translations.
==Software==

===Finder===
The ORF Finder (Open Reading Frame Finder) is a graphical analysis tool which finds all open reading frames of a selectable minimum size in a user&#x27;s sequence or in a sequence already in the database. This tool identifies all open reading frames using the standard or alternative genetic codes. The deduced amino acid sequence can be saved in various formats and searched against the sequence database using the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) server. The ORF Finder should be helpful in preparing complete and accurate sequence submissions. It is also packaged with the Sequin sequence submission software (sequence analyser).

===Investigator===
ORF Investigator is a program which not only gives information about the coding and non coding sequences but also can perform pairwise global alignment of different gene/DNA regions sequences. The tool efficiently finds the ORFs for corresponding amino acid sequences and converts them into their single letter amino acid code, and provides their locations in the sequence. The pairwise global alignment between the sequences makes it convenient to detect the different mutations, including single nucleotide polymorphism. Needleman–Wunsch algorithms are used for the gene alignment. The ORF Investigator is written in the portable Perl programming language, and is therefore available to users of all common operating systems.

===Predictor===
OrfPredictor is a web server designed for identifying protein-coding regions in expressed sequence tag (EST)-derived sequences. For query sequences with a hit in BLASTX, the program predicts the coding regions based on the translation reading frames identified in BLASTX alignments, otherwise, it predicts the most probable coding region based on the intrinsic signals of the query sequences. The output is the predicted peptide sequences in the FASTA format, and a definition line that includes the query ID, the translation reading frame and the nucleotide positions where the coding region begins and ends. OrfPredictor facilitates the annotation of EST-derived sequences, particularly, for large-scale EST projects.

ORF Predictor uses a combination of the two different ORF definitions mentioned above. It searches stretches starting with a start codon and ending at a stop codon. As an additional criterion, it searches for a stop codon in the 5&#x27; untranslated region (UTR or NTR, &quot;nontranslated region&quot;).

===ORFik===
ORFik is a R-package in Bioconductor for finding open reading frames and using Next generation sequencing technologies for justification of ORFs. 

=== orfipy ===
orfipy is a tool written in Python / Cython to extract ORFs in an extremely and fast and flexible manner. orfipy can work with plain or gzipped FASTA and FASTQ sequences, and provides several options to fine-tune ORF searches; these include specifying the start and stop codons, reporting partial ORFs, and using custom translation tables. The results can be saved in multiple formats, including the space-efficient BED format. orfipy is particularly faster for data containing multiple smaller FASTA sequences, such as de-novo transcriptome assemblies.

<doc id="1174562" wikidata="Q5161352" url="?curid=1174562" title="Conneaut Lake">
<text>Conneaut Lake is the largest natural lake in Pennsylvania by surface area. It is located in western Crawford County near a town with the same name. Its has a surface area of approximately 925 acres. The site of the lake is actually in adjacent Sadsbury Township and nearby Summit Township. During the summer season, it is heavily populated with people vacationing to the lake area, some from the area spending time in their houses on the lake, and many others from the surrounding area that like to spend the summer away from home, many of these people being residents of the Pittsburgh area. Other than the lake itself, the largest draw to the area has long been a popular resort known as Conneaut Lake Park, long known for its amusement park.

==Geography==
Conneaut Lake was formed as a kettle lake at the end of the Pleistocene. A large block of ice broke off the receding ice front and was surrounded by accumulating sediment. After the ice melted, the resulting depression was filled with water forming the lake. Water flows into Conneaut Lake through Inlet Run, a small stream on the north end of the lake. Water exits through the Conneaut Outlet, a larger creek which flows to the south through the Conneaut Marsh. The Conneaut outlet flows into French Creek, making it part of the Mississippi River drainage.

=== Depth ===

Conneaut Lake&#x27;s depth has a wide range. Most of the lake is shallow near the shoreline, before quickly dropping off to greater depths near the center. In most areas the lake is around deep, with an average depth of . There are several pockets around the lake with greater depths (referred to as &quot;deeps&quot; on local maps) reaching over deep. The lake&#x27;s maximum depth is generally approximated to be around , although some maps show a maximum depth of .

==History==
Before the early 19th century, Conneaut Lake was conspicuously absent from maps of the region, while much smaller nearby lakes were shown. The first recorded account of the lake was on May 5, 1791. A settler named Cornelius Van Horn was captured by Wyandots or their allies near what is today Meadville, Pennsylvania. He was taken on a path through the forest and bound to a tree near the lake&#x27;s outlet. Van Horn managed to free himself using a small knife.

The Lake level was raised about in the 1820s to permit the construction of the Beaver and Erie Canal. In the 1870s, canals were made obsolete by railroads, and the lake was returned to its natural elevation, though a dam remains for flood control. Before the construction of large reservoirs, Conneaut was the largest lake in Pennsylvania other than Lake Erie. The advent of rail travel made it a popular place for recreation. An amusement park, Conneaut Lake Park, was built on its western shore. The lake is notable as a site of early motorboat racing. The deep, cold waters of the lake allow it to stay frozen relatively late into the spring. This made Conneaut Lake a vital source of ice, prior to mechanical refrigeration.

During the later part of the 20th century, Conneaut Lake&#x27;s prominence as a tourist destination began to decline. Automobile and air travel allowed people to travel further from the cities for their vacations/weekend leisure. Streams were dammed, forming several reservoirs larger than Conneaut Lake throughout the area. Despite this, the lake remains popular in Western Pennsylvania thanks in part due to its lack of power restrictions which continues to draw powerboats, along with a reputation for being an excellent lake for fishing.

Between the two settlements on the lake (the town and the CDP), approximately 3,000 people live around Conneaut Lake.

<text>Kevin John Richard Nicholls (born 2 January 1979) is an English former footballer who played in midfield.

He most recently played for Luton Town, a club where he spent eight years at in two separate spells. At the beginning of his second stint at Luton in 2008, in which he dropped two divisions to play, Nicholls stated that his main motivation for returning was his love for the club. A long-term knee injury sustained in 2009 led to him volunteering to be released from his contract on 27 August 2010 and he subsequently retired from professional football.

Nicholls is one of Luton&#x27;s most successful captains, having won two promotions and the Football League Trophy during his tenure.

==Club career==

===Charlton Athletic===
Born in Upton Park, London, Nicholls began his playing career at Charlton Athletic, making his debut in the 1996–97 season as a substitute in a 2–1 loss to Ipswich Town. He scored his first and what turned out to be only goal for the club in a 2–2 draw at home to Barnsley on 15 February 1997. After a serious knee injury ruled him out of most of the 1997–98 season, he failed to break into the team in 1998–99 season and was loaned to Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, who promptly sent him back after four games despite scoring on his debut against Leyton Orient.

===Wigan Athletic===
After a short period back at Charlton, Nicholls was transferred to Wigan Athletic, then in the Second Division, in the summer of 1999 for £250,000, rising to £650,000 based on appearances. In the 1999–2000 season he was injured on his Wigan debut in October and would not play again for another six months, making a total of just 8 appearances over the course of the campaign. Nicholls played in 26 games in the 2000–01 season, scoring his only goal for Wigan in the 2–1 defeat to Reading in the play-off semi-final.

===Luton Town===
In the summer of 2001, Joe Kinnear signed Nicholls for Luton Town for an initial fee of £25,000, rising to £150,000 depending on appearances. He was a pivotal player in Luton&#x27;s promotion season of 2001–02, becoming the club captain and playing in 42 games. At Luton, Nicholls managed for several seasons to avoid the injuries that dogged him at previous clubs and became the &quot;heart and soul of the team&quot; according to Kinnear. In the 2003–04 season he became injured and missed 5 months of the campaign. After the injury he returned to his preferred central midfield position and contributed to Luton&#x27;s 10th-place finish.

In the 2004–05 season Nicholls was voted Player of the Year by Luton supporters as the club won the League One championship. It was Nicholls who lifted the championship trophy following a 4–2 victory against Brentford in April. He scored 14 goals, most of which came, crucially at times, from the penalty spot.

Nicholls was a vital part of the Luton side that not only finished 10th in the Championship in their first season, but in the match against Liverpool in the FA Cup; a game in which the Hatters went into a 3–1 lead courtesy of Nicholls, once again, with a penalty. The Hatters eventually fell short of the quality to see out the game, losing 5–3, but many of the players, such as Nicholls, who had spent the majority of their careers in the lower leagues, were now in the public eye.

===Leeds United===
On 26 July 2006, Nicholls signed for Leeds United for a fee of £700,000. In his first training session with Leeds, he damaged his knee ligaments but hoped to be fit within three months. Nicholls&#x27; quick rehabilitation allowed him to make his debut for the club as a substitute in Leeds&#x27; match against Sunderland on 13 September 2006, over a month before he was due back.

Nicholls picked up another injury on 30 September 2006 against West Bromwich Albion, which kept him out until December. On 26 October 2006, he was made the new captain of Leeds United by new manager Dennis Wise, with Shaun Derry being appointed his deputy.

Nicholls returned from injury on 16 December 2006, starting in the 1–0 loss against Ipswich Town. This was his first game as captain of Leeds and it ended with a red card in the dying minutes. Leeds manager Dennis Wise decided not to appeal against the decision, so Nicholls missed Leeds&#x27; following three matches over the Christmas period. Nicholls returned to the side once his suspension had been served in a 2–1 victory over Coventry City.

On 3 March 2007, Nicholls was dropped for Leeds&#x27; home match against Sheffield Wednesday. In his post-match interview, Wise stated that Nicholls had asked to leave the club and return to his former club Luton Town. However, Wise demanded that he would not allow Nicholls to return to Luton unless the original fee of £700,000 was to be paid back to Leeds. It was also stated that Nicholls had been stripped of the captaincy. He has since become somewhat of a hate figure amongst Leeds fans. He ended the season having made just 15 appearances in all competitions, with his last game for the club coming in late February.

===Preston North End===
On 29 June 2007, Nicholls left Leeds and agreed to sign a contract to move to Preston North End for a fee of £750,000. He officially moved to Preston on 5 July 2007, due to Leeds&#x27; administration status forcing them to delay all trading until that date.

Nicholls&#x27; spell at Preston was initially successful. He was a regular fixture in the starting line-up under manager Paul Simpson in the first few months of the season, but featured little following the arrival of new manager Alan Irvine, falling behind Paul McKenna, Darren Carter and new signing Richard Chaplow. On 2 August 2008, it was announced that Preston North End and Nicholls had come to an agreement to release him from his contract.

===Luton Town return===
On 2 August 2008, Nicholls signed a three-year contract with former club Luton Town, stating that he will always support Luton and loves the club. He returned as club captain, taking over from Keith Keane. Nicholls missed much of the 2008–09 season as a result of recurring injury problems, but returned fully fit in the final run-in of games. On 24 March 2009, he was given a five-game ban and £1,000 fine for supposedly applauding Luton fans for throwing missiles at the referee after a controversial 3–3 draw with Bradford City.

On 5 April 2009, Nicholls captained Luton to a 3–2 victory over Scunthorpe United at Wembley Stadium in the Football League Trophy final, picking up the man-of-the-match award for his performance in the heart of midfield. He played for Luton in their 0–0 draw with Chesterfield on 13 April, which saw them lose their Football League status and suffer relegation to the Conference Premier.

Despite a recurrence of his knee problem, Nicholls played in 23 league games during the 2009–10 season. It was later revealed by Luton director Gary Sweet that Nicholls had deliberately downplayed the seriousness of this injury to lead the team, &quot;playing through excruciating pain and ultimately risking his long term health&quot;. Surgery on this knee in early March 2010 ruled Nicholls out for up to eight months. Ultimately, this injury proved to be the end of his playing career. On 27 August 2010, he left the club by &quot;respectful, mutual consent&quot; after volunteering to be released from his contract, citing that he did not want to take money out of the club while not contributing on the pitch owing to his injury. In a club statement, managing director Gary Sweet branded Nicholls a Luton Town &quot;legend&quot; and &quot;arguably the club&#x27;s most successful captain&quot;.

==Post-playing career==
On 6 November 2010, it was confirmed by Rushden &amp; Diamonds that Nicholls had joined the club&#x27;s coaching staff. Rushden manager Justin Edinburgh said of him: &quot;He didn&#x27;t feel his body could train and play anymore... I think he&#x27;s got good knowledge and will probably give us a different perspective... the players will learn from him and I feel if I can give someone the opportunity it&#x27;s the right thing to do.&quot; Rushden &amp; Diamonds were liquidated in June 2011 after entering financial difficulty and Nicholls left the club.

He is works in player recruitment for a footballing agency, alongside former Luton defender Marvin Johnson.

==International career==
He was capped once and then sent off for the England under-20 team.

<doc id="1174573" wikidata="Q7734805" url="?curid=1174573" title="The Forever Hero">
<text>The Forever Hero is a trilogy of science fiction novels by American writer L. E. Modesitt, Jr. These books were some of the first novels L. E. Modesitt ever published. Like most of his early work, the books are characterised by heavy usage of onomatopoeia, and a tendency to describe the characters by their physical appearance rather than name. The books have been published as both an omnibus and separately. The three novels are &quot;Dawn for a Distant Earth&quot; (1987), &quot;The Silent Warrior&quot; (1987), and &quot;In Endless Twilight&quot; (1988).

In this series, Earth has been destroyed almost totally by overpopulation and the ensuing ecological collapse. Only a fragment of its population survive, and those that survive live in the most primitive conditions. The protagonist, Gerswin, is a primitive, a &#x27;devilkid&#x27; who is (inadvertently) captured by the interstellar government and trained in the military. Unique genetic mutations, and the effects of hundreds of years of Natural selection in an exceptionally harsh environment have left Gerswin with exceptional reflexes, enormous physical stamina, as well as, at least initially, a superb memory and incisive intelligence. He is also almost immortal. 
His goal is to salvage Earth and return it to its primeval state. He eventually does, and in the process, he destroys an interstellar empire, creates the greatest mercantile empire in history, and instigates the development of biological technology.

<doc id="1174583" wikidata="Q59653365" url="?curid=1174583" title="O Holy Night">
<text>&quot;O Holy Night&quot; (original title: &#x27;) is a sacred song about the night of the birth of Jesus Christ, described in the first verse as &quot;the dear Saviour&quot;, and frequently performed as a Christmas carol. Based on the French-language poem Minuit, chrétiens&quot;&quot;&#x27;, written in 1843 by poet Placide Cappeau, it was set to music by composer Adolphe Adam. The English version, with small changes to the initial melody, is by John Sullivan Dwight.

In recent times the song has been covered by many popular performers.

==Origin and composition==
&quot;O Holy Night&quot; is derived from the poem &quot;Minuit, chrétiens&quot;, written by poet Placide Cappeau in 1847, a wine commissionaire and a part-time poet. Cappeau wrote &quot;Minuit, chrétiens&quot; in celebration of recent stained glass renovations at a local church in Roquemaure, France. It was a church he frequently attended, and it was written per the request of the church&#x27;s parish priest Maurice Gilles, to be premiered at their Midnight Mass. Cappeau was friends with Emily Laurey a singer, and Laurey had connections to the famous opera composer Adolphe Adam (he had written his most famous work, &quot;Giselle&quot;, just a few years prior). The plan was to refer the writing to Adam upon Cappeau&#x27;s arrival to Paris while on a business trip, where Adam was located. As such, Cappeau wrote &quot;Minuit, chrétiens&quot; on 3 December 1847, during a stagecoach ride from Mâcon to Dijon, about a six-hour trip.

Cappeau&#x27;s understanding of Christian theology was derived from Jesuit educators at the Collège de France in Paris. The words are based on the Nativity of Jesus, specifically from the Gospel of Luke, and were inspired by the hypothesis of being a witness of the moment. His poem was generally anthemic, reflective of Cappeau&#x27;s socialist and abolitionist views. &quot;Minuit, chrétiens&quot; spoke commands to kneel and demonstrate humility before God. Its opening line, which spawned early controversy for the song adaptation, reads: &quot;Midnight, Christian! It is the solemn hour when the Man-God descended unto us, to erase original sin, and to stop the wrath of his Father.&quot; The original French text more directly refers to the Christian gospel message.

Cappeau was proud of his work on &quot;Minuit, chrétiens&quot;, and requested Adolphe Adam set the poem to music within the same trip. His exact beliefs regarding Christianity are unknown, although it is known that he was raised in a non-Christian environment, and he would frequently play organ in churches within Paris and had a Catholic funeral. The composition was completed within a few days of the original request, and Cappeau referred to the new carol as &quot;Cantique de Noël&quot;.

The most popular English rendition of &quot;Cantique de Noël&quot; was translated by American music critic and minister John Sullivan Dwight in 1855. An ordained Unitarian, he soon departed from the vocation of ministry to instead pursue a career in music and teaching. Dwight was influenced by the works of Ralph Waldo Emerson. Although there is some margin of translation error, it is accepted that Dwight took some creative liberties with some major line alterations. &quot;O hear the angel voices [...] O night divine&quot; is derived from &quot;Await your deliverance [...] Behold the Redeemer&quot; and &quot;With all our hearts we praise his holy name&quot; is derived from &quot;It is for us that he was born, that he suffered and died.&quot; An additional English translation of the song, &quot;O Night Divine&quot; was done by American musician Hart Pease Danks, who was influenced by Dwight&#x27;s version as early as 1885, and both competed in popularity.

=== Lyrics ===


== History ==
&quot;Cantique de Noël&quot; was first sung at the Midnight Mass of 1847 in Roquemaure. &quot;Within a generation or so&quot;, according to Christmas carol historian William Studwell, &quot;Cantique de Noël&quot; has been translated into many languages and received many renditions. One of the earliest publications was an organ arrangement published around 1855. The song saw large popularity throughout France as early as 1864, where the Catholic music journal &quot;Revue de Musique Sacrée&quot; stated that the song &quot;has been performed at many churches during Midnight Masses&quot; and &quot;is sung in the streets, at social gatherings, and at bars with live entertainment.&quot; In 1848 France underwent a revolution; &quot;Cantique de Noël&quot; was praised by the French poet Alphonse de Lamartine as &quot;a religious Marseillaise&quot;, in reference to the 1792 revolutionary song that became the national anthem of France, which worried some amidst the revolution. Additionally, many leaders within the Christian church criticized the song&#x27;s &quot;militant tone and dubious theology&quot;, according to &quot;America&quot; magazine. They particularly opposed the line &quot;Et de son Père arrêter le courroux” (&quot;to cease the wrath of his Father&quot;), which they felt depicted an angry and vengeful God in contrast to Jesus. This resulted in the song&#x27;s exclusion from Catholic hymnals. Most of the song&#x27;s criticism was however directed at its lyricist and composer. Catholic music critics derided Cappeau as a socialist and a drunk, and his apostasy from Christianity in his later years also garnered criticism; And Adam received criticism when false rumors spread about him supposedly being Jewish. A notable example of this was in 1930, when the composer Vincent d’Indy wrote an article that erroneously included Adam&#x27;s name in a list of Jewish composers and declared they were motivated purely by financial gain, as opposed to the article&#x27;s subject, Richard Wagner.

&quot;Revue de Musique Sacrée&quot; declared &quot;Cantique de Noël&quot; &quot;debased and degenerated&quot; in 1864, recommending that the song &quot;go its own way, far from houses of religion, which can do very well without it.&quot; This did not however prevent the song&#x27;s popularity increasing internationally. The Canadian composer and folklorist Ernest Gagnon first heard the song performed at a Midnight Mass at the Church of Saint-Roch, and imported it to Canada in 1858, starting in Quebec at a Midnight Mass performance by the eldest daughter of René-Édouard Caron. Although some concern about the song began in ecclesiastic circles there as well, the song became very popular in the country, and it became a tradition for soloists to perform the song at Midnight Masses. On 22 September 1936, the Catholic Church in Canada banned &quot;O Holy Night&quot; from being performed in churches, along with other songs and wedding marches, the Canadian national anthem, and many versions of &quot;Ave Maria&quot;, including those by composers such as Franz Schubert, Charles Gounod, Pietro Mascagni, and Jules Massenet. According to the secretary of the archbishop, the reason for the ban of these songs was the desire for the promotion and exclusive use of Gregorian chant and Gregorian music.

John Sullivan Dwight first discovered &quot;O Holy Night&quot; while researching songs to critique for his publication &quot;Dwight&#x27;s Journal of Music&quot;. Dwight praised the song, but as an abolitionist, also resonated with its themes of equality: &quot;Truly He taught us to love one another; His law is love, and His gospel is peace. Chains shall He break, for the slave is our brother, and in His name all oppression shall cease!&quot; This perfectly captured views of abolishing slavery, which was the primary source of opposition amidst the ongoing American Civil War. His publishing of &quot;O Holy Night&quot; saw high levels of popularity in the United States, especially within the North. Although disputed due to a lack of formal documentation, the first song played over a radio broadcast is usually attributed to inventor Reginald Fessenden&#x27;s performance of &quot;O Holy Night&quot; on violin in 1906.

Meanwhile, it was still common to be discriminatory of the song in France after World War II; French composer Auguste Sérieyx notably would rebuke those who performed the song on organ and in choirs, and the priests who &quot;tolerate or encourage them.&quot; By 1956 the song was &quot;expunged from many dioceses due to the emphatic aspect of its lyrics as much as the music itself, and the contrast they provide with the holiday liturgy&quot;, according to Paris publication &quot;Le Dictionnaire du Foyer Catholique&quot;.

Since the song&#x27;s creation, there have been demonstrations of spiritual usage of the song within Christian circles. One legend states that in 1870, French troops sung the song on Christmas Eve during the Franco-Prussian War during trench warfare, and combat temporarily ceased. In 2004, the song was sung by a Catholic priest to a dying American Marine soldier while deployed in Fallujah, Iraq.

== Modern usage ==
William Studwell stated in his book &quot;The Christmas Carol Reader&quot; that &quot;O Holy Night&quot; is &quot;the most popular carol in France and belongs in the upper echelon of carols on an international basis.&quot; It is common tradition in French and Canadian culture to have a solo performance at Midnight Mass. Its difficult higher registers result in anticipation that its wide range of notes be sung on pitch.

In recent history the song has been covered in a variety of Christmas album collections, across a range of genres and song styles. Popular covers of the song include renditions by Michael Crawford, Mariah Carey, NSYNC, Trans-Siberian Orchestra, Josh Groban, Celine Dion, Ella Fitzgerald, Carrie Underwood, Andrea Bocelli, Jennifer Hudson, and Kelly Clarkson. In a 2010 survey conducted by Zogby International, &quot;O Holy Night&quot; was ranked as the most popular Christmas song, ahead of &quot;White Christmas&quot; and &quot;The Christmas Song&quot;.

<text>The Seven Mountains () are seven mountains that surround the centre of the city of Bergen in Vestland county, Norway. Bergen is often called &#x27;the city between the seven mountains&#x27;.

== Selection ==
Playwright Ludvig Holberg (1684–1754) felt so inspired by the Seven hills of Rome, he decided that his home town must also be blessed with a corresponding seven mountains. Which mountains belong to the group is unclear, due to its origin (based on the mythical status of the number seven), and the fact that several of the mountains are part of the same mountain massif.

Since there are many mountains surrounding Bergen, the definition of the &quot;seven mountains&quot; varies depending on who is defining it. The Bergen Mountain Hiking Association, which organizes an annual 7-mountain hike defines it as Ulriken, Løvstakken, Fløyfjellet, Damsgårdsfjellet, Lyderhorn, Rundemannen, and Sandviksfjellet. The list always includes these four main mountains plus three others:
*Ulriken, 
*Løvstakken, 
*Fløyfjellet, 
*Damsgårdsfjellet, 
* plus three from this list:
**Askøyfjellet, 
**Blåmanen, 
**Lyderhorn, 
**Rundemanen, 
**Sandviksfjellet,

<doc id="1174594" wikidata="Q4942787" url="?curid=1174594" title="Booches">
<text>Booches is a bar, restaurant, and pool hall on 9th Street in downtown Columbia, Missouri. Established in 1884, it is the oldest pool hall in Columbia. It is located near the University of Missouri and has traditionally been frequented by college students. In 2016, Booches was inducted into the Boone County Hall of Fame by the Boone County Historical Society.

The hamburgers that the restaurant produced were listed in &quot;USA Today&quot; as one of the best in the country in 2000. They were also praised by the publication again in 2005 and by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; in 2019.

==Overview==
Booches, established in 1884, has had six locations in downtown Columbia. Since 1928 it has been on 18th and has been on 9th Street. It is the oldest pool hall in Columbia and has full-sized pool, snooker, and three cushion billiards tables. Booches serves food, as its hamburgers, which are served on wax paper, were listed in a 2000 report in &quot;USA Today&quot; as one of the best 25 in the United States. In 2005, Jerry Shriver of &quot;USA Today&quot; included Booches&#x27; hamburger on the list of top 25 dishes from his &quot;Down-home Dining&quot; project. In 2019, Joan Niesen and Laken Litman of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; named Booches&#x27; hamburgers as the &quot;#1 Greatest College Town Eats&quot; in the nation.

Booches is named after its founder, Paul Blucher Venable, who was nicknamed &quot;Booch&quot; as a child by writer Eugene Field. Opened as a male-only establishment, during the times of racial segregation in the United States, the establishment would not serve African Americans. By the 1970s it would serve both, and the venue gained a liquor license in 1982.

During the mid to late 1970s, the then-owners of Booches edited and published four issues of the &quot;Review la Booche&quot;, a nationally published literary journal. The journal featured poetry, prose, sketches, and photographs by John Ciardi, William Stafford, Elton Glaser, Frank Stack, and Richard Eberhart, along with local and regional contributors. The review was revived in 1990 for a fifth and final issue.

Booches is located close to the University of Missouri, and it has traditionally been used by University of Missouri and St. Louis Cardinals sports fans. It has been described by some in contemporary times as a dive bar and a melting pot. Booches was inducted into the Boone County Historical Society Hall of Fame at the Walters-Boone County Historical Museum in 2016.

==In popular culture==
Booches was included in the film &quot;Norm&quot;, which aired on ESPN&#x27;s SEC Network. &quot;Norm&quot; depicted the career of the former University of Missouri basketball coach Norm Stewart, who was a regular patron of the establishment.

<text>The Soul of a Horse (Mare With Foal) was an award-winning 1963 photo taken by the German photojournalist and &quot;Stern&quot; magazine staffer Peter Thomann.

In the mid-1970s the Kentucky Horse Park near Lexington opened to the public, using a logo based on the photograph. The icon of the dark colored mare and a light colored foal in mid-run was used on the Kentucky 1988 base license plate. Thomann sued the state for use of the image. Kentucky could not continue producing the plate while in litigation, so a plain blue on white design was used until resolution of the lawsuit.

<text>Guido &quot;Wedo&quot; Georgetti (May 18, 1911 – December 12, 2005) was an American painter, etcher, lithographer and sculptor.

==Biography==
He was born in Marche, Italy, and came to the United States in 1913 when he turned two. Wedo Georgetti spent many years travelling as a merchant seaman before he gained significant recognition as an artist. He also studied art in New York City. It is believed that he used experiences and images from his extensive travels as inspiration for his art. Although in the 1940s Georgetti was well known for his watercolor art and prints, Georgetti was blacklisted by the government during the McCarthy era. He was not convicted, but it shed a negative light on his art, making it harder for him to sell his works. Despite this, Georgetti kept pursuing his artistic efforts, primarily painting in oils and watercolor, and gave his unsold works to his friends and family. Georgetti&#x27;s work is in the collection of the National Gallery of Art.

Georgetti died at his home in Sausalito, California on December 12, 2005.

==Playing career==

===College and amateur===
After attending Jordan High School in Durham, North Carolina, Pause played college soccer at the University of North Carolina from 2000 to 2002. After a 2002 season in which he co-captained the Tar Heels and played everywhere from central defense to attacking midfield due to injuries, Pause signed a Project-40 contract with MLS. During the 2002 collegiate off-season, Pause played for the Raleigh CASL Elite of the fourth division Premier Development League.

===Professional===

With the additions of Arévalo Ríos and Jeff Larentowicz in the 2013 MLS season, Pause saw a reduction in playing time, appearing in only 15 matches and starting 11 of those. Following the season&#x27;s conclusion Pause was made available in the 2013 MLS Re-Entry Draft but eventually agreed to new a contract ahead of the 2014 season.

Logan Pause has retired at the end of 2014 MLS season. He has spent his entire 12-year professional career playing for Chicago Fire.

<doc id="1174635" wikidata="Q1518999" url="?curid=1174635" title="Auxerre Cathedral">
<text>Auxerre Cathedral () is a Roman Catholic church, dedicated to Saint Stephen, located in Auxerre, Burgundy, France. It was constructed between the 13th and 16th centuries, on the site of a Romanesque cathedral from the 11th century, whose crypt is found underneath the cathedral. It is known for 11th century Carolingian frescoes found in the crypt, and for its large stained glass windows. Since 1823 it has been the seat of a diocese united with that of Sens Cathedral.

== History ==
The first Christian diocese in Auxerre was established at the end of the 3rd century by its first bishop, Germanus of Auxerre. The original Romanesque cathedral was completed in 1057. The crypt of that structure was immense, with three naves and six traverses. It also featured a new architectural element, a disambulatory, a passage which permitted pilgrims to circulate and visit the tombs in the crypt without disturbing the religious services attended by the clergy.

The construction of the Gothic cathedral was begun in about 1215, led by Bishop Robert de Seignelay. He set an example by contributing heavily and consistently from his own resources, and continued to bequeath funds after his transfer to the see of Paris in 1220.
The new Cathedral, along with that of Dijon Cathedral, became models of the Burgundian Gothic style.

Most of this portion of the cathedral was finished by 1233. After this, the work slowed down considerably. The chevet, or east end, was completed by De Seignelay&#x27;s successor, Henri de Villeneuve (1220–34); he left 1000 &quot;livres&quot; for the project, but construction slowed after his death, hampered by a shortage of funds. The construction of the west front did not begin until the end of the 13th century. The south transept was not completed until 1358. Most of the nave walls were finished by 1395, but the nave vaults were not completed until the beginning of the 15th century. 
Construction resumed in the 16th century with the north tower, built in the richly ornamented Flamboyant Gothic style, completed in 1543. However, the Wars of Religion led to the devastation of the cathedral in 1567. The planned south tower was never constructed. 

The transepts were also completed in the 16th century; the rose window called the Virgin of the Litanies in the north arm of the transept, made by Germain Michel, was finished in 1528, while the rose window of the south transept, by Guillaume Cornouvaille, was installed in 1550.

In 1567, during the Wars of Religion, Protestant bands pillaged the city, and caused considerable damage to the cathedral. The damage was largely repaired by 1576 under Bishop Jacques Amyot.

In 1764 the very ornate Gothic rood screen, or choir grill, put in place under King Francois I of France, was destroyed, in keeping with a new Vatican anti-Reformation doctrine to make the interior more appealing to ordinary churchgoers. It was replaced by a lacelike iron grill made by the Paris iron craftsman Dhumier, with gates by sculptor Sébastien Slodtz to a design by Claude-Nicolas Ledoux.

== Exterior ==
The narrative sculptural program of the portals on the west end are noted for their extent and variety.

The stimulus was provided about 1270 by Jean de Châlons-Rochefort, who had recently become Count of Auxerre, having supported the Duke of Burgundy against his own brother, by marrying Alix, the heiress of Auxerre. He was the largest fief-holder in the duchy and commemorated the new status of his fief of Auxerre by enriching the front of its chief ornament, the cathedral, whose Carolingian nave had been erected by his ancestor Hugh de Châlons, 10th-century bishop of Auxerre. Its program of sculpture was carried through long after his death and completed in the early 15th century.

== North Tower ==

The construction of the north tower began in about 1250, and reached the completion of the portal at its base, but then practically ceased for nearly two centuries. The work did not resume the beginning of the 16th century. The upper portions were built largely in the ornate flamboyant Gothic style, and were completed in about 1543.

The tower contains the belfry of the cathedral, within the fifth, or top level. It is approximately the same height as the towers of Notre-Dame de Paris. The three levels above the portal are decorated with niches covered by gables. The roof has a small terrace surrounded by a balustrade. The tower is given a more graceful silhouette by the prolongation of the buttresses at the angles. The buttresses are also ornamented and prolonged by slender spires. On the northeast side of the tower is attached a slender octagonal tower with narrow windows, which serves as a stairway from the base of the tower to the summit. At the top it has its own Renaissance-style belfry and a lantern, adorned with a cross marking the highest point of the cathedral.

A south tower similar to the north tower was planned, and the base and buttresses for the tower were constructed, with walls two meters thick, next to the narthex, and a second level above, but it went no higher. Later in the 16th century The cathedral chapter decided to rebuild the oratory to house a statue of the Virgin Mary rather than building the tower higher. The unfinished tower base reaches as far into the interior as the first traverse of the nave. A spiral staircase is encased in the massive stone construction. To the right of the north tower base are the vestiges of the chapel of Notre-Dame-des-Vertus, built in the 16th century but demolished in 1780.

== Nave and Choir ==

The choir, built atop the Romanesque crypt, was begun first in about 1215, in a plan similar to another Burgundian church, Dijon Cathedral. The elevation has three levels; large arcades with pillars at the bottom; a narrow triforium, or passageway, above, with windowless arches and decoration by slender colonettes; and on the top level, double lancet windows below circular rose windows, with a narrow passageway along the wall at their base.

The nave was originally planned to have a ceiling of six-part rib vaults, supported by alternating massive pillars and columns, but this plan was modified to have the more modern and stronger four-part rectangular rib vaults.

Another notable architectural feature is the junction between the axial chapel at the east end with the disambulatory, the interior passage the surrounds the east end interior, allowing visitors to circulate while services were going on in the choir. In this disambulatory, the six-part vaults are supported by slender columns twenty-five centimetres in diameter, which give unity of style and animation to the end of the church.

== Crypt ==

The crypt beneath the choir was constructed between by Bishop Hugues de Chalon, when he rebuilt the earlier Romanesque structure. It features an early disambulatory, allowing circulation by pilgrims around the tombs without disturbing services in the center. It contains the oldest art in the cathedral, including frescoes of Christ at the time of the Apocalypse commissioned by Bishop Humbaud, and a later fresco of Christ in Majesty from the end of the 13th century.

== Stained glass ==

The cathedral has an important collection of 13th century stained glass. This includes some sixty windows made between 1235 and 1250, mostly found in the Chapel of Notre-Dame and in the ambulatory. They are known for the deep, rich blues and reds of the thick pieces of glass, assembled like parts of a mosaic. The windows in the bays of the nave date from the 15th century, and are in the Renaissance style. The rose windows of the transept date from the 16th century. 

=== Rose windows ===

The north portion of the transept was completed, along with its flamboyant rose window, in 1528. The south transept and rose window were completed in 1550. The south rose window has an oculus in the centre representing God the father, over eight lancet windows depicting the life of Moses. The windows were made by Guillaume Cornovaille.

== Art and decoration ==

The cathedral has a very rich collection of sculpture, particularly in the arches over the main portal on the west front. This collection of densely-packed sculptures includes both religious figures and allegorical figures of the wives of Hercules and the sleeping goddess Eros. 

An important decorative feature of the interior is the elaborate wrought iron choir screen, which replaced the old rood screen in 1764. It was made by the Paris iron craftsman Dhumier, with gates by the royal sculptor Sébastien Slodtz to a design by Claude-Nicolas Ledoux.

The cathedral choir has a remarkable collection of misericordes, the sculpted wood medallions on the seat backs in the choir, which provided a resting place when the clergy had to stand for long periods of time.

== The organ ==
The grand organ of the cathedral was built in the 19th century, and installed in a Neo-Gothic style case. It was entirely rebuilt between 1979 and 1986 by Dominique Oberthür de Saintes, who transformed it into a modern instrument, with forty-six stops, four manual keyboards, and mechanical transmission by carbon fibres. Following damage from a storm in 2005, it received further restoration between 2011 and 2012 and was given additional stops, including stops En chamade, which sound directly outward, like trumpets, to the nave. 
== The bells ==
The bell tower contains the four major bells of the cathedral:

* Thérèse: the bourdon, or largest and deepest bell: 4,750 kilograms (1836)
* Marguerite: 2,500 kilograms (1841) by Jean-Claude II Burdin at Lyon
* Marie-Félicité 1.800 kilograms (1841), by Jean-Claude II Burdin at Lyon 
* Marie-Anne: 550 kilograms (1841) by Jean-Claude II Burdin at Lyon

Rung altogether, they create a harmony in G major.

==The diocese==

Auxerre was formerly an important diocese in Gaul, with a bishop as early as the 3rd century; the diocese was suppressed in 1821. A council held at Auxerre in 585 (or 578) under bishop Annacharius formulated forty-five canons, closely related in context to canons of the contemporary first and second Councils of Lyon and the Council of Mâcon. &quot;They are important as illustrating life and manners among the newly-converted Teutonic tribes and the Gallo-Romans of the time&quot;, the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; asserts. Many of the decrees were directed against remnants of paganism and non-Christian customs; others bore witness to the persistence in the early Middle Ages in France of certain ancient Christian customs. The canons of the council of 695 or 697 were concerned chiefly with the Divine Office and ecclesiastical ceremonies.

<doc id="1174652" wikidata="Q93596" url="?curid=1174652" title="Chain pickerel">
<text>The chain pickerel (Esox niger) is a species of freshwater fish in the pike family (family Esocidae) of order Esociformes. The chain pickerel and the American pickerel (&quot;E. americanus&quot;) belong to the &quot;Esox&quot; genus of pike.

==Taxonomy==
French naturalist Charles Alexandre Lesueur described the chain pickerel in 1818. Its species name is the Latin word &quot;niger&quot; &quot;black&quot;.

Nicknames include the &quot;southern pike&quot;, &quot;grass pike&quot;, &quot;jack&quot;, &quot;jackfish&quot;, &quot;gunny&quot; and &quot;eastern pickerel&quot;. In central Florida the chain pickerel is known locally as &quot;Gatorfish&quot; 

==Description==
The chain pickerel has a distinctive, dark, chain-like pattern on its greenish sides. There is a vertical dark marking underneath the eye, which helps to distinguish the chain pickerel from redfin pickerel (&quot;Esox americanus americanus&quot;) and grass pickerel (&quot;E. americanus vermiculatus&quot;), in which the mark curves posteriorly. Its body outline resembles that of the northern pike (&quot;E. lucius&quot;). Unlike northern pike, however, the opercles and cheeks of chain pickerel are entirely scaled. It may reach up to long only on rare occasions. The average size for chain pickerel, however, is 24 in (61 cm) and 3 lb (1 1/2 kg). (The average chain pickerel caught by fishermen is under 2 lb). It lives around 8 yr. In some places the pickerel is known as a &quot;gunfish&quot;, &quot;gunny&quot; or &quot;slime dart&quot;, due to its characteristic slime coating.

A blue color morph lacking the usual reticulated pattern has been described in a New York population.

==Distribution==
Its range is along the eastern coast of North America from southern Canada to Florida, and west to Texas. On the Atlantic Coast, in Maine, New Hampshire, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia although it is considered an invasive species in Nova Scotia, the chain pickerel extend as far as 46°N. The fish inhabits fresh and brackish water from the Mississippi Valley. It also is commonly found in Lake Michigan and the lower portion of the Great Lakes. It is considered invasive in northern areas.

==Habitat==
Chain pickerel live in a variety of habitats, including pools within creeks or rivers, lakes with vegetation cover, swamps and other wetlands. Chain pickerel are tolerant of brackish water with salinity levels of up to 22 ppt. They are also acid tolerant to a pH of 3.8.

==Diet==

Like the northern pike, the chain pickerel feeds primarily on smaller fish, until it grows large enough to ambush large fish from cover with a rapid lunge and to secure it with its sharp teeth. Chain pickerel are also known to eat frogs, snakes, worms, mice, other small mammals, crayfish, insects, and a wide variety of other foods. It is not unusual for pickerel to leap out of the water at flying insects, or even at dangling fishing lures. Raney (1942) studied chain pickerel in a New York pond and found that golden shiners were found in the stomachs of 47.3% of the 234 chain pickerel examined. Brown bullheads were found in 13.8%, and pumpkinseed sunfish were found in 13.2%. Crayfish of the genus &quot;Cambarus&quot; were present in 42% of the chain pickerel.

==Reproduction==
Spawning occurs in flooded vegetation at the end of winter or beginning of spring when the water temperature is between . A secondary fall spawning has been reported in Pennsylvania. Fertilization is external and eggs and sperm are mixed by the adults&#x27; tail movements. Up to 50,000 eggs may be released by the female. No parental care is provided, and the eggs hatch between six and twelve days after they are laid. The fry possess adhesive glands on their snouts that they use to attach to vegetation. It takes six to eight days for the fry to absorb their yolk sac, at which point they begin to actively hunt.

==Angling==
The chain pickerel is a popular sport fish. It is an energetic fighter when hooked. Anglers have success with live minnows, spinnerbaits, spoons, topwater lures, plugs, and flies, usually tied with some kind of feather or bucktail material. If the angler intends to release a fish, it is advisable use pliers to flatten the barbs on the lure&#x27;s hooks. Chain pickerel can swallow an entire lure, so it will be much easier to free a deeply hooked fish and get it back into the water as soon as possible.
Practically any bass lure can be effective for pickerel, although like most pike, they seem to be particularly susceptible to flashy lures which imitate small forage fish. Dragging a plastic worm, lizard, frog, or other soft imitation can also be extremely effective. A Texas rig method is recommended with these soft baits for productive fishing in the weeds.

A steel leader is necessary for sharp-toothed and active fish at two to three pounds. The angler would also do well to use 12- to 17-lb-test line on an open-faced spinning reel. Methods are similar to those for bass, such as dragging a lure through weeds in shallow water and jerking it side-to-side to give it the look of injured prey. Chain pickerel are voracious and opportunistic feeders, and will attack most any fodder that moves into their range of vision.

The International Game Fish Association (IGFA) all-tackle world record chain pickerel is a fish, caught in Homerville, Georgia on February 17, 1961 by angler Baxley McQuaig, Jr., while the IGFA all-tackle length world record is long, caught in Henderson Harbor, Lake Ontario, New York on November 4, 2019 by angler Burnie Haney.

<doc id="1174663" wikidata="Q833957" url="?curid=1174663" title="Brown bullhead">
<text>The brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus) is a fish of the family Ictaluridae that is widely distributed in North America. It is a species of bullhead catfish and is similar to the black bullhead (&quot;Ameiurus melas&quot;) and yellow bullhead (&quot;Ameiurus natalis&quot;). It was originally described as &quot;Pimelodus nebulosus&quot; by Charles Alexandre Lesueur in 1819, and is also referred to as &quot;Ictalurus nebulosus&quot;.

The brown bullhead is also widely known as the &quot;mud pout&quot;, &quot;horned pout&quot;, &quot;hornpout&quot;, or simply &quot;mud cat&quot;, a name also used with the other bullhead species.

The brown bullhead is important as a clan symbol of the Ojibwe people. In their tradition, the bullhead or is one of six beings that came out of the sea to form the original clans.

==Appearance==
The brown bullhead grows to be approximately in length and is a darker brown-green dorsally, growing lighter green and yellow towards the ventral surface. The belly is off-white or cream, and the fish has no scales. Additionally, there are darker, brown-black speckles along the entire surface of the fish. The brown bullhead has a dorsal fin that bears a spine, a single adipose fin posterior to the dorsal fin, abdominal pelvic fins, and an anal fin with 21 to 24 rays. The tail is only slightly notched, with the dorsal and ventral lobes angling inward. The pectoral fins have spines that bear five to eight serrated teeth on their posterior edge. The fish has eight barbels around its mouth. The barbels on the chin are black to yellowish brown. Juvenile brown bullheads are similar in appearance, but are more likely to be of a single solid color.

The brown bullhead&#x27;s mouth is terminal or slightly subterminal, with the upper jaw projecting slightly past the lower jaw. This position enables bottom feeding. The brown bullhead may be distinguished from flathead catfish (&quot;Pylodictis olivaris&quot;) by the absence of lateral posterior extensions on the tooth patch of the brown bullhead&#x27;s upper jaw. Adult brown bullheads range in size from and weigh between and (in extreme cases). Brown bullheads are ectothermic, heterothermic, and bilaterally symmetrical. Brown bullheads can be distinguished from black and yellow bullheads by their yellow-black chin barbels, the absence of a hypopigmented bar at the base of the tail (which is present in black bullheads), and their 21–24 anal fin rays.

==Distribution==
The native range of the brown bullhead is in the Atlantic and Gulf Slope drainages. More specifically, it is found from Nova Scotia and New Brunswick to Mobile Bay, Alabama, and in the Great Lakes, Hudson Bay, and Mississippi River basins (from Quebec to Saskatchewan, south to Louisiana, and west to Texas). However, there is evidence that the brown bullhead was historically absent from the Gulf Coast west of the Apalachicola River and east of the Mississippi River. The species is also abundant in many regions as a result of stocking for food or sport. These locations include Georgia, Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Virginia, and Washington. Brown bullheads are a social non-migratory species that are known to form schools.

==Habitat==
The brown bullhead thrives in a variety of habitats, including lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams with low oxygen or muddy conditions. In many areas of the United States, brown bullheads are opportunistic bottom feeders. The species has few natural predators and is not popular with anglers in most areas (albeit very popular in some such as the Oneida Lake area of Upstate New York, where it is featured each spring by local restaurants), so it has thrived. Catfish are found in a variety of habitats, from lakes or murky ponds to drainage ditches. They are scarce during the day, but come out at night to feed, searching the bottom of a lake or river for food. They eat insects, leeches, snails, fish, clams, and many plants. They are also known to eat corn, which can be used as bait. Similarly to other catfish, they spawn only after the temperature of the water has reached in June and July. However, cooler temperatures are required before brown bullheads will spawn in the northern US.
 Brown bullheads can withstand a wide range of water temperatures and low oxygen levels. Brown bullheads can survive waters with heavy pollution and dissolved oxygen values as low as 0.2ppm. Because of bullheads&#x27; tolerance of low oxygen levels, they are less threatened by and are capable of surviving in relatively extreme environments.

==Fishing==
This catfish is easily caught with natural bait such as worms and chicken livers. They have a scrappy but not unusually strong fight. Anglers often catch them by fishing off the bottom. When caught in very clear water when the flesh is firm and reddish to pinkish, the hornpout is quite edible and delicious. Nevertheless, its genial cousins such as the channel catfish and the blue catfish are better known for their use as food. In most areas, they will not exceed two pounds in weight, with a current International Game Fish Association world record of .

==Life cycle and reproduction==

Brown bullheads typically live between six and eight years, but have been recorded as old as fifteen in captivity. The species spawns between April and June. For the duration of each breeding season, females will be monogamous. There are no consistent behaviors of mate attraction. The females lay eggs in dark locations such as under rocks and inside logs, where they are externally fertilized by the male. The fish face opposite one another during the fertilization process. Nests are primarily created by females, but the eggs are protected by both sexes. An egg cluster in a nest may contain between 50 and 10,000 eggs. The eggs usually take six days to hatch, but may take up to 13 days. Both parents generally care for their offspring for an additional five days after the eggs hatch. The young are kept in a school by a parent for up to one month. They will remain in schools as juveniles.

Brown bullheads, both male and female, will reach sexual maturity around age three. Brown bullheads have occasionally been recorded eating their own eggs.

==As an invasive species==
The fish has been introduced into many European countries, such as Poland, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Romania, Estonia, Hungary, Serbia, and Croatia. Brown bullheads have also been introduced to western North America, Chile, Puerto Rico and New Zealand.
 Countries who have reported adverse effects from the introduction of the brown bullhead species include Iran and Turkey.

==Diet==
Brown bullheads are omnivorous benthic bottom feeders. Their diet consists of algae, leeches, worms, mollusks, crustaceans, insects, crayfish, other smaller fish species and fish eggs. Brown bullheads are typically nocturnal feeders, but have been reported to feed diurnally. Bullheads have poor eyesight and are heavily reliant on their sensitive barbels to locate their food. The fish are omnivorous and will reportedly eat almost anything that fits in their mouth.

==Predation==
Brown bullheads are the most susceptible to predators in their developmental stages, primarily as eggs. They are prey to the following species: northern pike, muskellunge, walleye, snapping turtles, water snakes, green herons, yellow perch, and sunfish. Additionally, brown bullheads are used for small-scale commercial fishing, recreational fishing, and more specifically for consumption and research. Predation by other fish and coexisting species is only a realistic threat to bullheads under four inches, while the biggest threat to adult bullheads is humans. Brown bullheads have protective coloration to avoid predation. As a mode of physical defense against predators, bullhead species have a sharp spine on the leading edge of their dorsal and pectoral fins. To use this adaptation as a defense mechanism, bullheads will stiffen the spine while being attacked, impeding the predator&#x27;s ability to swallow while simultaneously releasing a venom to sting and burn the predator.

==Conservation==
Brown bullheads hold no special status on the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, the United States Endangered Species Program, or under the CITES appendix. Brown bullheads can tolerate very low dissolved oxygen levels that result from industrial and domestic pollution, aiding in their overall high rate of survivorship. Brown bullheads are the most abundant species in many lakes and streams across the continent.

In Missouri, the brown bullhead is listed as a Species of Conservation Concern and is threatened by habitat destruction, particularly the drainage of swamps in the Missouri Bootheel for conversion into farmland.

<doc id="1174665" wikidata="Q494158" url="?curid=1174665" title="SK Group">
<text>SK Group () is a South Korean multinational manufacturing and services conglomerate headquartered in Seoul. A chaebol (Korean family-owned conglomerate), SK Group is the second largest such conglomerate by revenue in South Korea, after Samsung Group. Through a number of subsidiaries, it is engaged in various businesses, including manufacture of chemicals and petrochemicals, semiconductors, flash memory and miscellaneous information technology, as well providing telecommunications services worldwide among its other less notable ventures.

The conglomerate is composed of 186 subsidiaries and affiliates that share the SK brand name and the group&#x27;s management culture, named SKMS (SK Management System). It changed its name from Sunkyong Group () to SK Group in 1998. The group is controlled by estate of Chey Tae-won through a holding company, SK Inc. The cornerstone of SK Group is its energy and chemicals division.

While its largest businesses are primarily involved in the energy, petroleum, and chemical industries, the group also owns the nation&#x27;s largest wireless mobile phone service provider SK Telecom, and provides services in construction, marketing, local telephone communications, high-speed internet, and wireless broadband WiBro. Since 2012, SK Hynix, one of the world&#x27;s largest random access memory and semiconductor manufacturers, has also been majority owned by the group.

== History ==
===Formation and early production===
As with many other chaebols, SK Group&#x27;s chairmanship was &#x27;inherited&#x27; from father to son: from its founder the late Chey Jong-hyon to its present chairman Chey Tae-won (eldest son). Chey Tae-won was married to the daughter of the former South Korean President Roh Tae-woo until 2015.

SK Group began when the current founders acquired Sunkyong Textiles (founded during the Japanese rule as a joint venture between two Japanese companies, Senman Chutan and Kyoto-based Kyoto Orimono Company) from South Korean government as abandoned property of Japan in 1953. In 1958, the company manufactured Korea&#x27;s first polyester fiber on company grounds. It established Sunkyong Fibers Ltd. in July 1969, and started to produce original yarn. In 1973, SK then established Sunkyong Oil, beginning a vertical integration strategy to manage production, &quot;From Petroleum to Fibers&quot;. That same year, the company acquired the Walkerhill Hotel.

In 1976, Sunkyong Corporation received an international trading company license from the Indian government. In December 1980 SK purchased privately run Korea National Oil, making it Korea&#x27;s fifth largest conglomerate.

In January 1988, crude oil was imported for processing to Korea from Yemen&#x27;s Marib oil field.

===1990s to 2000s===
In June 1994, SK entered Korea&#x27;s telecommunications business by becoming Korea Mobile Telecommunication Service&#x27;s largest shareholder. In January 1996, SK Telecom launched Korea&#x27;s first commercial CDMA cellular phone service in Incheon and Bucheon.

In 1998, Management re-branded Sunkyong to SK. In 1999, SK Chemicals developed third-generation (non cross resistant) platinum-complex anti-cancer agent. Also, by focusing its research and development efforts on life sciences, SK Corporation developed YKP1358, a new drug candidate for schizophrenia, in 2003.

In 2002, SK Telecom successfully launched the world&#x27;s first commercial CDMA 1X EV-DO technology, allowing it to offer 3G telecommunications service. In 2004, SK Telecom enabled satellite DMB service by deploying the world&#x27;s first DMB satellite. Moreover, in 2006, SK began revitalizing the 3.5-generation mobile phone market and in the following year, completed the construction of the national HSDPA network. In May 2006, SK Telecom started the world&#x27;s first commercial 3.5-generation HSDPA service, featuring high-quality video telephony and data transmission, and global roaming access.

In 2005, SK Networks opened China&#x27;s first two wholly foreign-owned, gas stations in Shenyang. Then, after exploring Brazilian mining area BM-C-8, SK Corporation developed an oil field where it confirmed the existence of more than 50 million barrels of oil deposits.

SK Gas began developing resources overseas when it participated in two mining areas to the west of Russia&#x27;s Kamchatka peninsula in March 2006. In early 2006, SK Networks also developed Ecol-Green, a biodegradable plastic material. Incheon Oil officially started operations using the SK name in March 2006. SK Energy is currently engaged in 27 oil fields in 15 countries worldwide

SKC imported propylene oxide (PO, a chemical used in manufacturing polyurethane) production technology from Germany in May 2006. It is scheduled to produce 100,000 tons of PO from 2008.

At the end of 2005, SK Corp. developed a lithium-ion battery separator (LiBS) for the first time in Korea, and started selling the product in 2006. In July 2007, SK Group adopted a holding company structure.
Under the re-organization, SK&#x27;s main entity, SK Corporation, was split into an investment company, now SK Inc. and an operating company, now SK Energy. The subsidiary companies that now operate under the central SK Inc. umbrella include: SK Energy, SK Telecom, SK Networks, SKC, SK E&amp;S, SK Shipping and K Power.

SK acquired Hynix for US$3 billion in February 2012, rebranding it to SK Hynix.

===Recent history===
In February 2017, SK acquired the polyethylene acrylic acid business of Dow Chemical Company for $370 million, and planned to increase battery production capacity from 1.9 to 3.9 GWh per year at the end of 2018, supplying Kia and Mercedes.

In July 2022, SK Group announced a $22 billion investment in the United States semiconductor, green energy bioscience and other technology industries. In total, SK Group will invest over $52 billion in the United States by 2025.

SK Networks said August 20, 2024 it has sold its rental car unit for 820 billion won (US$618 million) to a Singapore-based private equity fund.

In November 2024, SK Group Chairman Chey Tae-won was appointed chairman of the board of directors of Soldigm, SK Hynix&#x27;s U.S.-based NAND flash memory unit.

On Dec. 23, 2024, SK sold 85 percent of its subsidiary SK Specialty to Hahn &amp; Company, a domestic private equity fund (PEF). The value of the stake in the sale is worth about W2.7 trillion.

<doc id="1174669" wikidata="Q6276430" url="?curid=1174669" title="Jordan Cila">
<text>Jordan Rodin Cila (born April 11, 1982) is an American former soccer midfielder/forward. He played for the Duke Blue Devils men&#x27;s soccer team, and played 39 games in Major League Soccer. He also played in the Under-17 and Under-20 United States national teams.

==Youth ==
Cila is Jewish, the son of Brazilian soccer defensive midfielder Renato Cila and Sherry Rodin who married in 1979, and the grandson of New York Arrows, Rochester Lancers and Baltimore Blast owner Bernie Rodin. His father played in the old North American Soccer League (NASL) as well as the Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL) for both the Baltimore Blast and New York Arrows in the MISL. Cila&#x27;s younger siblings are Sam and Gabriella.

He was born and raised in Jericho, New York, and attended Jericho High School, for which he played soccer during his sophomore and junior years. As a junior Cila was a Parade All-American and led the team to their first-ever county finals, and in his three years playing for the team he had 67 goals and 38 assists.

Cila attended Bradenton Academy from January till December 1999, and trained at the academy with the Under-17 United States national team, with such players as Landon Donovan, DaMarcus Beasley, and Bobby Convey. He played for the United States in the 1999 FIFA U-17 World Championship in New Zealand. He also played for the Under-20 US national team.

==College==
Afterwards, Cila opted to attend Duke University and play college soccer for the Duke Blue Devils men&#x27;s soccer team while many of his teammates turned professional as teenagers. After scoring 13 goals and 9 assists during his freshman season, tying him for second on Duke&#x27;s all-time freshman scoring list as he became a second team All-Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) selection Cila&#x27;s scoring output declined every year as he moved from forward to deeper and deeper midfield positions. He scored 17 goals and 26 assists in his last three seasons combined. In 2001, he was again a second team All-ACC selection, and in 2002 he led the team with 22 points and 10 assists. As a senior, he tied for second among ACC assists leaders while he had 14 points on three goals and eight assists, and he ended his career ranked number five on the all-time ACC assists list, with 35. In 76 career games, Cila had 30 goals and 95 points while helping the team reach the NCAA Division I Men&#x27;s Soccer Tournament two times.

==Professional career==
Upon graduating, Cila went undrafted in the 2004 MLS SuperDraft. He received a trial with the Colorado Rapids on the insistence of two of his former Bradenton teammates, Kyle Beckerman and Seth Trembly, and surprised coach Tim Hankinson by earning a developmental contract with the team. Cila earned playing time at his old striker position, scoring several key goals, and eventually earned a starting spot. Although he was moved further back towards the end of the season, Cila finished 2004 with 21 appearances and 15 starts, scoring four goals and two assists as one of the league&#x27;s biggest rookie surprises.

Cila&#x27;s old coach at Bradenton, John Ellinger, acquired him for Real Salt Lake for the club&#x27;s inaugural 2005 season. He scored three goals in 12 games.

In 2006, he was sent to the New York Red Bulls, for whom he played four games scoring one goal, for a 4th round supplemental draft pick in 2006. Cila retired from playing soccer in 2006, at 24 years of age.

==Career post-soccer==
After playing soccer, Cila has worked in interest rate sales at Goldman Sachs. In 2014, &quot;Business Insider&quot; named him one of The 20 Best Soccer Players Working In Finance. Jordan Cila is now the head of Fixed Income Sales for Americas and EMEA for Citadel Securities.

<text>Jeffrey Francis Williams (born 6 June 1972) is an Australian-born former left-handed pitcher who played for the Hanshin Tigers baseball team. He was a specialist set-up pitcher, or closer.

==Olympics==
Williams pitched for the Australian Olympic baseball team in the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. The team placed 7th overall in the competition.

Williams again pitched for the Australian Olympic baseball team in the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece. The Australian team was awarded the Silver Medal in the competition after losing in the final to the team from Cuba. Willams was credited with two saves during the tournament, including the semi-final game against Japan where he prevented the Japanese team from scoring, preserving the 1–0 win.

==Professional career==
Williams was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Los Angeles Dodgers in . Williams began his Major League Baseball career in September with the Los Angeles Dodgers, and pitched for the Dodgers until September . While with the Dodgers in and , the tandem of Williams and fellow Australian Luke Prokopec gained considerable popularity in the Los Angeles area. However, the attention was short-lived, as both moved on to other franchises.

In , Williams signed with the Hanshin Tigers, and earned 25 saves as a closer (52 games), helping the Tigers win their first Central League championship in 18 years.

In , he pitched in 51 games, earning 14 saves. In , he reverted to the role of set-up pitcher, appearing in 75 games for the Hanshin Tigers, who won the championship.

Williams pitched for the Tigers for seven years through the 2009 season. He appeared in a total of 371 games and recorded 47 saves.

His performance as a set-up pitcher, combined with his set-up and closing pitcher teammates Kyuji Fujikawa and Tomoyuki Kubota respectively, was well known by fans and other teams. Their formation was given the nickname JFK by their team, using their initials from their pitching order (Jeff, Fujikawa, Kubota). The trio&#x27;s efforts were crucial to the Tigers&#x27; success, especially when the starting pitching was not good. For example, in 2007 Hanshin&#x27;s starting pitchers had a cumulative ERA of 4.45, the worst in the league, but their overall ERA was 3.56, best in the league.

After his retirement, Williams signed with the Tigers as a scout on 2 March 2011.

==Collegiate career==
Williams played college ball for Southeastern Louisiana University in Hammond, Louisiana, from 1992 to 1996. In his senior year, Williams was selected as an NCAA Division I All-American; that year, he registered 125 strikeouts and 12 wins. In 2004, he was inducted into the SLU Lions Hall of Fame.

==Mitchell Report==
On 13 December 2007, Williams was named as a player linked to performance-enhancing drug use in the Mitchell Report for Major League Baseball. In the report, Kirk Radomski claims he sold the steroids oxandrolone and metandienone to Williams. The document includes a photocopy of a February 2004 check from Williams to Radomski in the amount of $1,820 and mentions that Williams address and phone number were in Radomski&#x27;s address book. Williams did not respond to a request to meet with Mitchell to address these accusations.

After the Mitchell Report became public, Hanshin Tigers club president Nobuo Minami defended Williams stating&quot;I trust him, He (Williams) flatly denied the use of any banned substances and said he is ready to accept fresh checkups at any time.&quot;

In Olympic competition and while playing in Japan, where they conform with Olympic testing standards, Williams has never tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs.

<doc id="1174672" wikidata="Q9022084" url="?curid=1174672" title="National Minimum Drinking Age Act">
<text>The National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984 () was passed by the United States Congress and was later signed into law by President Ronald Reagan on July 17, 1984. The act punished any state that allowed persons under 21 years to purchase alcoholic beverages by reducing its annual federal highway apportionment by 10 percent. The law was later amended, lowering the penalty to 8 percent from fiscal year 2012 and beyond.

Despite its name, this act did not outlaw the &quot;consumption&quot; of alcoholic beverages by those under 21 years of age, just their purchase or public possession. However, Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, New Hampshire, and West Virginia, extended the law into an outright ban. The minimum purchase and drinking ages is a state law, and most states still permit &quot;underage&quot; consumption of alcohol in some circumstances. In some states, no restriction on private consumption is made, while in other states, consumption is only allowed in specific locations, in the presence of consenting and supervising family members, as in the states of Colorado, Maryland, Montana, New York, Texas, Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. Some states even allow persons under 21 years of age to drink alcohol in public places, such as in Ohio, Texas, Massachusetts and Louisiana as long as the parent or guardian consents to it and is the one that buys the alcohol and is at least 21 years old. The act also does not seek to criminalize alcohol consumption during religious occasions (e.g., communion wines, Kiddush).

The act was expressly upheld as constitutional in 1987 by the United States Supreme Court in &quot;South Dakota v. Dole&quot;.

==History==
Legislation concerning the legal minimum drinking age in the United States can be traced back to the days of Prohibition. In 1920, the Eighteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution declared it illegal to manufacture, transport, or sell intoxicating liquors. This was repealed with the passing of the Twenty-first Amendment in 1933, which was followed by the adoption of minimum legal drinking age policies in all states, with most states electing a minimum legal drinking age (MLDA) of 21. Between 1970 and 1975, 29 states lowered the MLDA from 21 to 18, 19, or 20. This was primarily due to the passing of the Twenty-sixth Amendment, which lowered the required voting age from 21 to 18.

During the 1960s, both Congress and the state legislatures came under increasing pressure to lower the minimum voting age from 21 to 18. This was in large part due to the Vietnam War, in which many young men who were ineligible to vote (or legally drink) were conscripted to fight in the war, thus lacking any means to influence the people sending them off to risk their lives. &quot;Old enough to fight, old enough to vote,&quot; was a common slogan used by proponents of lowering the voting age. The slogan traced its roots to World War II, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt lowered the military draft age to 18. With the lowering of the voting age to 18, the minimum legal drinking age (MLDA) was similarly lowered under the notion that by being able to vote (and for males, be subject to being involuntarily drafted into the enlisted ranks of the military), one should also be able to legally consume alcoholic beverages.

However, these changes were soon followed by studies showing a significant increase in motor vehicle fatalities attributable to the decreased MLDA. In response to these findings, many states raised the minimum legal drinking age to 19 (and sometimes to 20 or 21). In 1984, the National Minimum Legal Drinking Act, written by Senator Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ) and influenced by Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), required all states to set their minimum purchasing age to 21. Any state that chooses not to comply with the act would have up to 10 percent of its federal highway funds withheld. 

As the MLDA was still left to the discretion of the state, the act did not violate the Twenty-first amendment which reserved the right to regulate alcohol for all responsibilities not specifically appointed to the federal government to the states. However, as the act controlled the distribution of anywhere from $8 million to $99 million, depending on the size of the state, the act gave a strong incentive for states to change the drinking age to 21. By 1995, all 50 states, two permanently inhabited territories, and D.C. were in compliance, but Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands (and Guam until 2010) remained at 18 despite them losing 10% of federal highway funding.

Professor of law Tim Jost noted that the Roberts Court ruling in &quot;NFIB v. Sebelius&quot;, though upholding &quot;South Dakota v. Dole&quot;, had serious implications for future laws that incentivize state action.

The Court expressly distinguished &quot;South Dakota v. Dole&quot;, the drinking age case, because only a small portion of highway funds were at risk. ... There will certainly be future litigation when other federal programs are changed and all of the funding for the existing program is at risk, however.

Constitutional lawyer Adam Winkler disagrees saying

The health care decision on Medicaid is likely to be limited to its facts. ... Where a state&#x27;s budget is truly dependent on federal dollars to survive, then conditional spending offers will be called into question. The health care decision doesn&#x27;t purport to call into question any previous conditional spending law. And it&#x27;s not likely to have much impact because there&#x27;s no clear majority opinion establishing new limits.

The Conservative Party of New York opposed the passage of the law in 1984. In 2001, New York State Assembly member Félix Ortiz introduced a bill that would lower the drinking age back to 18. He cited unfairness and difficulty with enforcement as his motivations.

In 1998, the National Youth Rights Association was founded, in part, to seek to lower the drinking age back to 18. In 2004, the president of Vermont&#x27;s Middlebury College, John McCardell, Jr. wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that &quot;the 21-year-old drinking age is bad social policy and terrible law&quot; that has made the college drinking problem far worse. Groups that oppose the 21 minimum include Choose Responsibility, the Amethyst Initiative, and Students for Sensible Drug Policy.

Organizations that support upholding the 21 minimum age limit include Mothers Against Drunk Driving, American Medical Association, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the American Board of Pediatrics. 

A key cluster of philosophical opposition to the minimum lies in the natural human need for education and experience; young adults do not receive the opportunity to educate themselves and drink responsibly before the age of 21. A related line of thought emphasizes the importance of individual rights and freedoms. Another cluster comes from pragmatism, emphasizing the reality that young people are unlikely to stop drinking, and point to statistics on underage drinking as a reason to institute a lower drinking age, which would provide the opportunity to help &quot;young people learn to make healthy and responsible choices&quot;. Social environmental theories are also cited; making alcohol a forbidden fruit may encourage more dangerous drinking than would occur if the drinking age were lowered. With a lower drinking age, young people would have access to &quot;publicly moderated drinking environments&quot;, rather than &quot;model their behavior after the excessive consumption typical of private student parties&quot;, though the perception of excessive drinking on college campuses is often overstated.

When brewing magnate Pete Coors raised the drinking age as a campaign issue during the 2004 U.S. Senate race in Colorado, Republican leaders praised his stand on states&#x27; rights but distanced themselves from apparent self-interest.

==Application on college campuses==
College campuses across the nation continue to struggle with issues of underage drinking, despite the nationwide MLDA of 21. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) took special interest in this issue, and compiled a list of recommendations for colleges to implement in order to combat underage drinking on campus. However, few schools have actually implemented these recommendations, and according to a recent study, most of the intervention programs currently in place on college campuses have proven ineffective. Underage drinking is nearly impossible to prevent on college campuses because access to alcoholic beverages is extremely easy.

Though it is not the only factor that contributes to student drinking, liquor&#x27;s contraband status seems to imbue it with mystique. As a result, use and abuse of liquor is seen as sophisticated and is expected.

Of the colleges surveyed, 98% offered alcohol education programs to their students. Only 50% of surveyed colleges offered intervention programs, 33% coordinated efforts with the surrounding community to monitor illegal alcohol sales, 15% confirmed that surrounding establishments offered responsible beverage service training, and 7% restricted the number of alcohol outlets within the community. Special services for &quot;problem drinkers&quot; were available at 67% of the surveyed schools; 22% of the schools referred problem drinkers to off-campus resources, and 11% offered no intervention program whatsoever. 34% of the surveyed schools were located in communities that actively instituted compliance checks, but 60% of these checks occurred without university involvement. One-fifth of surveyed schools were altogether unaware of the NIAAA&#x27;s recommendations.

Many factors may explain colleges&#x27; failure to implement the NIAAA&#x27;s recommendations to control underage drinking on campus: a lack of university funding, a lack of time, a perceived lack of authority or jurisdiction within the community, or even a lack of interest on the part of the university, many universities even see the program as a waste of resources. Whatever the reasons may be, a multitude of options are available should colleges choose to institute programs to decrease instances of underage drinking on campus. These options include, but are not limited to, alcohol education programs, social norms campaigns, substance-free housing, individual interventions, parental notification policies, disciplinary procedures for alcohol-related violations, and amnesty policies to protect the health and safety of students.

==Effects==

The Institute of Medicine reviewed a large number of studies on the minimum legal drinking age, including peer-reviewed academic reviews, and largely viewed the policy as a success—so much so that they argued for similar restrictions on tobacco. For example, they quote a study by Kypri and colleagues stating that &quot;No traffic safety policy, with the possible exception of motorcycle safety helmet laws, has more evidence for its effectiveness than do the minimum legal drinking age laws.&quot; In contrast, several studies, including a 2011 review, showed data that went against the idea that raising the drinking age to 21 actually saved lives in the long run. For example, Miron and Tetelbaum (2009) found that when the federally coerced and non-coerced states were separated out, any lifesaving effect is no longer statistically or practically significant in the coerced states, and even in the voluntary-adopting states the effect does not seem to last beyond the first year or two. They also find that the 21 drinking age appears to have only a minor impact on teen drinking. There is also some evidence that traffic deaths were merely shifted from the 18-20 age group to the 21-24 age group rather than averted. Additionally, Canada, Australia, the UK, and several other nations saw similar or faster declines in traffic fatalities than the USA did since the early 1980s despite not raising their drinking ages to 21.

<text>In computing, Internet geolocation is software capable of deducing the geographic position of a device connected to the Internet. For example, the device&#x27;s IP address can be used to determine the country, city, or ZIP code, determining its geographical location. Other methods include examination of Wi-Fi hotspots.

==Data sources==
An IP address is assigned to each device (e.g. computer, printer) participating in a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. The protocol specifies that each IP packet must have a header which contains, among other things, the IP address of the sender.

There are a number of free and paid subscription geolocation databases, ranging from country level to state or city—including ZIP/post code level—each with varying claims of accuracy (generally higher at the country level). These databases typically contain IP address data, which may be used in firewalls, ad servers, routing, mail systems, websites, and other automated systems where a geolocation may be useful. An alternative to hosting and querying a database is to obtain the country code for a given IP address through a DNSBL-style lookup from a remote server.

Some commercial databases have augmented geolocation software with demographic data to enable demographic-type targeting using IP address data.

The primary source for IP address data is the regional Internet registries which allocates and distributes IP addresses amongst organizations located in their respective service regions:

* African Network Information Centre (AfriNIC)
* American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN)
* Asia-Pacific Network Information Centre (APNIC)
* Latin American and Caribbean Internet Address Registry (LACNIC)
* RIPE Network Coordination Centre (RIPE NCC)

The registries allow assignees to specify country and geographical coordinates of each assigned block. Starting from 2021 RFC 9092 allows assignees to specify location of any IP subnetwork they own.

Secondary sources include:

* Data mining or user-submitted geographic location data:
** Website-submitted, e.g. a weather website asking visitors for a city name to find their local forecast or pairing a user&#x27;s IP address with the address information in their account profile.
** Wi-Fi positioning system through the examination of neighborhood Wi-Fi BSSID. E.g. Mozilla Location Service.
** Examination of neighborhood Bluetooth devices.
** Pairing a user&#x27;s IP address with the GPS location of a device that&#x27;s using such an IP address.
* Data contributed by Internet service providers.
* Guesstimates from adjacent Class C range and/or gleaned from network hops.
* Network routing information collected to the end point of the IP address.
* Analysis of linguistic data from the device, using pre-trained models that show that some term is frequently mentioned in a certain location (e.g. &quot;the T&quot; vs &quot;the El&quot; vs. &quot;the subway&quot;).

Accuracy is improved by:
* Data scrubbing to filter out or identify anomalies.
* Statistical analysis of user submitted data.
* Utilizing third-party tests conducted by reputable organizations.

===Errors===
If geolocation software maps IP addresses associated with an entire county or territory to a particular location, such as the geographic center of the territory, this can cause considerable problems for the people who happen to live there, as law enforcement authorities and others may mistakenly assume any crimes or other misconduct associated with the IP address to originate from that particular location.

For example, a farmstead northeast of Potwin, Kansas became the default site of 600 million IP addresses when the Massachusetts-based digital mapping company MaxMind changed the putative geographic center of the contiguous United States from 39.8333333,-98.585522 to 38.0000,-97.0000. Since 2012, a family in Pretoria, South Africa, has been regularly visited by police or angry private citizens who believed their stolen phones were to be found in the family&#x27;s backyard. This was also the result of geolocation by MaxMind. The company used the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency&#x27;s coordinates for Pretoria, which pointed to the family&#x27;s house, to represent IP addresses associated with Pretoria.

==Privacy==
A distinction can be made between &quot;co-operative&quot; and &quot;oppositional&quot; geolocation. In some cases, it is in the interest of users to be accurately located, for example, so that they can be offered information relevant to their location. In other cases, users prefer not to disclose their location for privacy or other reasons.

Technical measures for ensuring anonymity, such as proxy servers, can be used to circumvent restrictions imposed by geolocation software. Some sites detect the use of proxies and anonymizers, and may either block service or provide non-localized content in response.

==Applications==
Geolocation technology has been under development only since 1999, and the first patents were granted in 2004. The technology is already widely used in multiple industries, including e-retail, banking, media, telecommunications, education, travel, hospitality, entertainment, health care, online gaming and law enforcement, for preventing online fraud, complying with regulations, managing digital rights and serving targeted marketing content and pricing. Additionally, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has proposed that geolocation software might be leveraged to support 9-1-1 location determination.

An IP address or the related unique URL may also be investigated with basic functions, typing from the keyboard two instructions: ping and traceroute. In Unix-like systems, they are available as a command line tool. In the same way, Microsoft Windows has the prompt of DOS working with those instructions.

===Criminal investigations===

Banks, software vendors and other online enterprises in the US and elsewhere became subject to strict &quot;know your customer&quot; laws imposed by the USA PATRIOT Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, the US Treasury Department&#x27;s Office of Foreign Assets Control and other regulatory entities in the US and Europe from the early twenty-first century. These laws are intended to prevent money laundering, trafficking with terrorist organizations, and trading with banned nations. When it is possible to identify the true location of online visitors, geolocation can protect banks from participating in the transfer of funds for illicit purposes. More and more prosecuting bodies are bringing cases involving cyber-crimes such as cyber-stalking and identity theft. Prosecutors often have the capability of determining the IP address data necessary to link a computer to a crime.

===Fraud detection===
Online retailers and payment processors use geolocation to detect possible credit card fraud by comparing the user&#x27;s location to the billing address on the account or the shipping address provided. A mismatch – an order placed from the US on an account number from Tokyo, for example – is a strong indicator of potential fraud. IP address geolocation can be also used in fraud detection to match billing address postal code or area code. Banks can prevent &quot;phishing&quot; attacks, money laundering and other security breaches by determining the user&#x27;s location as part of the authentication process. Whois databases can also help verify IP addresses and registrants.

Government, law enforcement and corporate security teams use geolocation as an investigatory tool, tracking the Internet routes of online attackers to find the perpetrators and prevent future attacks from the same location.

===Geomarketing===

Since geolocation software can get the information of user location, companies using geomarketing may provide web content or products that are famous or useful in that specific location. Advertisements and content on a website that uses geolocation software in the form of an API (also referred to as &quot;IP API&quot; or &quot;IP address geolocation API&quot;) may be tailored to provide the information that a certain user wants.

===Regional licensing===
Internet movie vendors, online broadcasters who serve live streaming video of sporting events, or certain TV and music video sites that are licensed to broadcast their videos of episodes/music videos are permitted to serve viewers only in their licensed territories. By geolocating viewers, they can be certain of obeying licensing regulations. Online gambling websites must also know where their customers violate gambling laws, or risk doing so.

Jim Ramo, chief executive of movie distributor Movielink, said studios were aware of the shortcomings going in and have grown more confident now that the system has been shown to work.

===Gaming===
A location-based game is a type of pervasive game for smartphones or other mobile devices in which the gameplay evolves and progresses via a player&#x27;s real-world location which is typically obtained by GPS functionality from the device.

<doc id="1174686" wikidata="Q210491" url="?curid=1174686" title="Cristian Chivu">
<text>Cristian Eugen Chivu (; born 26 October 1980) is a Romanian professional football coach and former player who is the current head coach of Serie A club Parma.

A defender, he began his career with hometown club CSM Reșița before moving to FC Universitatea Craiova in 1998, leaving Romania to join Dutch club Ajax a season later. His performances as the captain of Ajax inspired an €18 million transfer to Roma in 2003. Chivu won the Coppa Italia in his last of four seasons in Rome before a transfer to Inter Milan, where he spent the rest of his career before retiring in 2014. After recovering from a fractured skull, Chivu wore a distinctive protective headgear, similar to Petr Čech&#x27;s, from 2010 onwards. His honours at Inter included a treble of the Italian league, domestic cup, and the UEFA Champions League in 2010.

Chivu earned 75 international caps for Romania between 1999 and 2010 and was part of the squads for UEFA European Championships in 2000 and 2008. After retiring, he became a football pundit for Italian television stations Sky Sport and Fox Sports. He is also a technical observer for UEFA.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Chivu&#x27;s first professional club was CSM Reșița. After moving to FC Universitatea Craiova, his reputation began to rise and his performances sparked interest from some larger clubs outside of Romania. Dutch club Ajax was particularly impressed with Chivu and signed him in 1999.

===Ajax===
At Ajax, Chivu developed a reputation as a reliable fullback and a free-kick specialist. Then-manager Ronald Koeman appointed him as captain of the club. With Chivu as captain, Ajax dominated the Dutch Eredivisie with an exciting young squad. Playing alongside Chivu were future stars such as Rafael van der Vaart, Wesley Sneijder, Johnny Heitinga, Zlatan Ibrahimović, Steven Pienaar and Maxwell. Chivu played a pivotal role for Ajax in their UEFA Champions League run in the 2002–03 season, when they came to within a minute of the semi-finals. That season, Chivu was in a quintet of Ajax players – himself, Zlatan Ibrahimović, Maxwell, Wesley Sneijder and Andy van der Meyde – who all went on to later join Inter Milan.

===Roma===
In 2003, Roma expressed their interest in signing Chivu. At the time, Roma had an enormous debt and there were questions raised over Roma&#x27;s ability to pay any proposed fees. Seeking to silence the increasing doubt over their financial situation, Roma sought a bank guarantee, which was subsequently denied. After much speculation, however, Roma finally completed the purchase of Chivu in September, ending the long and protracted saga. The fee was €18 million. Though he became a regular in defence, he made limited appearances due to injuries. He won the 2006–07 Coppa Italia in his last season with Roma. During the summer transfer window, he was once again a subject of transfer speculation, with newly crowned La Liga champions Real Madrid reportedly making a formal bid, while Barcelona and Inter Milan were also interested in signing the defender.

===Inter Milan===

Chivu was reported to be in the middle of a tug-of-war between Barcelona and Real Madrid during the 2007 summer transfer window. After a four-year spell which yielded a Coppa Italia, Chivu left Roma and signed a five-year contract with Serie A rivals Inter on 27 July 2007. The transfer fee was €16 million, which €3 million of the transfer fee paid via defender Marco Andreolli moved to Roma in a co-ownership deal. His first season with the defending Serie A champions was a successful one, as he won the Serie A title that had eluded him during his time at Roma.

During the Champions League match at home to Manchester United in the 2008–09 season, Chivu had a terrific game, denying Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo many times, and won Man of the Match ahead of Inter goalkeeper Julio César.

Chivu was a regular at left back during the 2009–10 season, as Walter Samuel and Lúcio became the preferred centre back pairing. On 6 January against Chievo, Chivu was stretchered off early in the second half after colliding heads with Chievo striker Sergio Pellissier. He was in two hours of surgery for a skull fracture and later cleared of any danger. Although it was initially thought he might be out for the rest of the season, he returned to Serie A on 24 March. After this, he needed to wear a headguard in matches. A month later, Chivu scored his first goal for Inter in a game against Atalanta, a terrific 30-yard strike. On 22 May 2010, he was in Inter&#x27;s starting line-up in the UEFA Champions League final against Bayern Munich, which Inter won 2–0.

He scored his second goal for Inter in the 2010–11 season against Cesena which turned out to be the game winner in a 3–2 win for Inter. He also scored the winning penalty for Inter in their 2010–11 Coppa Italia win over Napoli on 26 January 2011.

Chivu left Inter after his contract was terminated by mutual consent on 31 March 2014. The very same day he announced his retirement from football on his Facebook page.

==International career==
In 1999, Chivu was chosen to represent the Romania national under-21 team and quickly made the step up to play for the full side. In 2001, he won Cyprus International Football Tournament 2001. 
He represented his country at both UEFA Euro 2000 and Euro 2008. Despite being capped only four times prior to the Euro 2000, he started all four matches and scored his first international goal.

At Euro 2008, he earned plaudits for his performance, keeping previous FIFA World Cup champions Italy and runners-up France at bay, despite being played in a less familiar role as a holding midfielder. He captained Romania through World Cup qualification, but they failed to make the play-offs, finishing fifth in their group. On 21 May 2011, Chivu announced his retirement from the national team.

==Managerial career==
In August 2019, Chivu enrolled in the UEFA Pro Licence courses at Coverciano.

In July 2021 he was announced as new head coach of Inter Milan &quot;Primavera&quot;.

In 18 February 2025 he was appointed as new head coach of Serie A club Parma, by signing a contract until June 2026.

==Personal life==
Chivu speaks Italian, Dutch, Spanish and English, as well as his native Romanian.

His father, Mircea was also a footballer and a coach, the Mircea Chivu Stadium from Reșița is named in his honor. He played as a right back for CSM Reșița and Universitatea Craiova winning the 1973–74 Divizia A with the team from Craiova. Mircea was coach at CSM Reșița when Cristian started his career. According to &quot;Calcio Italia&quot; magazine, Chivu has been involved in opening football schools around Romania for the past few years, and he said &quot;I hope that he is proud when he looks down on me&quot; in reference to his father who died in 1998.

He is married to Adelina Elisei who on 12 February 2009 gave birth to their first child, a daughter named Natalia.

<text>Jonathan &quot;Nate&quot; Jaqua (born October 28, 1981, in Eugene, Oregon) is an American former soccer player.

==Career==

===High school===
Jaqua is a graduate of South Eugene High School, where he led his team to two Midwestern League titles and one co-championship with North Bend in 1996. South Eugene lost to South Medford High School in the Oregon Class 4A state title in 1998. He was named a Parade All-American twice and named Oregon 4A Player of the Year twice.

===College===
Jaqua played college soccer at the University of Portland from 2000 to 2002. He totaled 29 goals and 22 assists in his three years there was named West Coast Conference freshman of the year.

===Professional===
After his 2002 season, Jaqua signed a Project-40 contract with Major League Soccer and entered the 2003 MLS SuperDraft, where he was selected third overall by Chicago Fire. Although Jaqua was expected to fill the hole in the Fire&#x27;s lineup left by Josh Wolff, Damani Ralph quickly took that position, and Jaqua was relegated to a reserve role, starting only five games, scoring two goals and two assists. Although Jaqua remained blocked at forward by Ralph and Ante Razov in the 2004 season, DaMarcus Beasley&#x27;s departure to PSV Eindhoven left an open spot in the Fire midfield, which Jaqua soon took. He finished the season having started 21 games for the team, while scoring four goals and two assists. Thereafter, Jaqua continued to be used as an outside midfielder from time to time, however the majority of his appearances came as a forward.

Jaqua was chosen to participate in the 2006 MLS All-Star Game, taking on Chelsea F.C. in an exhibition match at the Fire&#x27;s home field, Toyota Park. Jaqua played well in the event, which the MLS side won in shocking fashion, 1–0.

After the 2006 season, Jaqua was not protected by Chicago in the 2006 MLS Expansion Draft. Expansion side Toronto FC selected Jaqua in the November 17, 2006, draft but weeks later traded him to Los Angeles Galaxy in exchange for a partial player allocation. On July 2, 2007, Los Angeles traded Jaqua to Houston Dynamo in exchange for Kelly Gray and a second-round pick in the 2008 MLS SuperDraft.

He signed with Austrian side SC Rheindorf Altach on January 28, 2008, but was released despite performing well with the club. On July 13, 2008, he re-signed with Houston Dynamo. However, on November 26 of that year, he was selected by Seattle Sounders FC in the first round of the 2008 MLS Expansion Draft.

Jaqua stayed with Seattle through the 2011 season. At season&#x27;s end, the club declined his 2012 contract option and he entered the 2011 MLS Re-Entry Draft. Jaqua was selected by New England Revolution in stage two of the draft on December 12, 2011. He was offered a contract but did not sign with New England.

===International===
Jaqua has played for the U-18, U-20, and U-23 United States national teams. He got his first cap for the senior team on January 29, 2006, against Norway and nearly scored in the U.S. victory.

<text>Carroll Cloar (January 18, 1913 – April 10, 1993) was a nationally known 20th-century painter born in Earle, Arkansas, who focused his work on surreal views of Southern U.S. themes and on poetically portraying childhood memories of natural scenery, buildings, and people, often working from old photographs found in his family albums.

Guy Northrop, in his introduction on page 24 to &quot;Hostile Butterflies and Other Paintings by Carroll Cloar&quot; (1977), quoted Cloar describing his images as &quot;American faces, timeless dress and timeless customs ... the last of old America that isn&#x27;t long for this earth.&quot; His &quot;Panther Bourne&quot; work depicted a surreal, Southern-mythic nature scene. Cloar employed pointillism in his painting &quot;Waiting up for Lettie,&quot; creating over 800 works in his lifetime.

He moved to Memphis in 1930, attending Southwestern at Memphis (later known as Rhodes College) as an English major. His recurrent themes of a &quot;homecoming,&quot; implying that the essential beauty of a locale is best understood by one who has left a beloved place behind and then returned, are echoed in his own personal experience of traveling abroad for years and then returning to the South. He began his travels in Europe after college, before returning to Memphis to study at Memphis College of Art. He studied at the Art Students League of New York from 1936 to 1940.

A series of lithographs he created in that period of the landscape and people of his Earle, Arkansas, hometown led to his receipt of a McDowell Traveling Fellowship in 1940. Cloar traveled throughout the western United States and Mexico until World War II began. He then joined the Army Air Forces for the war effort.

Cloar visited Mexico on a 1946 Guggenheim Fellowship. He traveled around Central and South America until 1950. His first one-man show was held in 1953 in Memphis. He moved permanently to Memphis in 1955, after determining the direction of his art was rooted in his Southern U.S. experience.

Cloar then completed 14 works in 1955, including the representative work, &quot;My Father Was Big as a Tree.&quot; A New York showing in 1956 helped establish his career nationally. Tennessee museums later held more than 10 exhibitions of his works, while he also displayed his work in New York showings.

Cloar died in Memphis in 1993.

<doc id="1174701" wikidata="Q504483" url="?curid=1174701" title="Black caiman">
<text>The black caiman (Melanosuchus niger) is a crocodilian reptile endemic to South America. With a maximum length of around and a mass of over , it is the largest living species of the family Alligatoridae, and the third-largest crocodilian in the Neotropical realm. True to its common and scientific names, the black caiman has a dark greenish-black coloration as an adult. In some individuals, the pigmentation can appear almost jet-black. It has grey to brown banding on the lower jaw; juveniles have a more vibrant coloration compared to adults, with prominent white-pale yellow banding on the flanks that remains present well into adulthood (more than most other species). The banding on young helps with camouflage by breaking up their body outline, on land or in water, in an effort to avoid predation. The morphology is quite different from other caimans but the bony ridge that occurs in other caimans is present. The head is large and heavy, an advantage in catching larger prey. Like all crocodilians, caimans are long, squat creatures, with big jaws, long tails and short legs. They have thick, scaled skin, and their eyes and noses are located on the tops of their heads. This enables them to see and breathe while the rest of their bodies are underwater.

A carnivorous animal, the black caiman lives along freshwater habitats, including slow-moving rivers, lakes and seasonally flooded savannas, where it preys upon a variety of fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Being an apex predator and potentially a keystone species, it is generalist, capable of taking most animals within its range, and might have played a critical role in maintaining structure of the ecosystem. Although merely few specific ecological studies have been conducted, it is observed that this species has its own niche which allows coexistence with other competitors.

Reproduction takes place in the dry season. Females build a nest mound with an egg chamber, protecting the eggs from predators. Hatchlings form groups called pods, guarded by the presence of the female. These pods may contain individuals from other nests. Once common, it was hunted to near extinction primarily for its commercially valuable hide. It is now making a comeback, listed as Conservation Dependent. Overall a little-known species, it was not researched in any detail until the 1980s, when the leather-trade had already taken its toll. It is a dangerous species to humans, and attacks have occurred in the past.

==Classification==
Although the black caiman is the sole extant (living) species of the genus &quot;Melanosuchus&quot;, two fossil species found in South America have been described: &quot;Melanosuchus fisheri&quot; in 1976, and &quot; Melanosuchus latrubessei&quot; in 2020, although the status of &quot;M. fisheri&quot; is in doubt. The black caiman is a member of the caiman subfamily Caimaninae, and is one of six living species of caiman. It is most closely related to the caimans of the genus &quot;Caiman&quot;, as shown in the cladogram below, based on molecular DNA-based phylogenetic studies:
==Distribution==
The black caiman largely inhabits areas of Amazonia, living in rivers, swamps, wetlands, and lakes. It is found in Brazil, eastern Ecuador and Peru, northern Bolivia, eastern French Guinea, and southern Guyana.

==Characteristics==
The black caiman has dark-coloured, scaly skin. The skin coloration helps with camouflage during its nocturnal hunts, but may also help absorb heat (see &quot;thermoregulation&quot;). The lower jaw has grey banding (brown in older animals), and pale yellow or white bands are present across the flanks of the body, although these are much more prominent in juveniles. This banding fades only gradually as the animal matures. The bony ridge extending from above the eyes down the snout, as seen in other caiman, is present. The eyes are large, as befits its largely nocturnal activity, and brown in colour. Mothers on guard near their nests are tormented by blood-sucking flies that gather around their vulnerable eyes, leaving them bloodshot.
The black caiman is structurally dissimilar to other caiman species, particularly in the shape of the skull. Compared to other caimans, it has distinctly larger eyes. The snout is relatively deep, and the skull (given the species&#x27; considerably larger size) is much larger overall than other caimans. Black caimans are relatively more robust than other crocodilians of comparable length. There appears to be varying skull morphology in this species depending on the age and particular individual animal, which is not uncommon in other modern crocodilians, and by gender, with adult males typically having much more massive skulls relative to their size than like-age females. Due to the differences, males have a stronger bite force and likely exploit a different, and larger, prey base than females. Young black caimans can be distinguished from large spectacled caimans by their proportionately larger head, as well as by the colour of the jaw, which is light coloured in the spectacled caiman and dark with three black spots in the black caiman. A , black caiman was found to have a bite force of .

===Size===

The black caiman is the largest predator in the Amazon basin and the largest member of the Alligatoridae family, making it one of the largest extant reptiles. It is also significantly larger than other caiman species. Most adult black caimans are in length, with a few old males exceeding . Sub-adult male specimens of around will weigh roughly , around the same size as a mature female, but will quickly increase in bulk and weight. The average size of adult females at their nests was found to be . Mid-sized mature males of weigh approximately , while large mature specimens exceed , being relatively bulky crocodilians. Very large, old males can exceed in length, and weigh up to . A relatively small adult male of a total length of weighed while an adult male considered fairly large at a length of weighed approximately . Another sampling of sub-adult males found them to range in length from , averaging , and that they weighed from , averaging . In a study conducted in Rupununi River, Guyana, sub-adult and adult black caimans ranged from in length and weighed between . In some areas (such as the Araguaia River) this species is consistently reported at in length, although specimens this size are uncommon. Several widely reported but unconfirmed (and probably largely anecdotal) reports claim that the black caiman can grow to over in length and weigh up to . While it is unclear what the sources for this maximum size are, many scientific papers accept that this species can attain extreme sizes as such. In South America, two other crocodilians reportedly reach similar sizes: the American crocodile (&quot;Crocodylus acutus&quot;) and the Orinoco crocodile (&quot;C. intermedius&quot;).

==Biology and behaviour==

===Hunting and diet===
Black caimans are apex predators with a generalist diet, and can take virtually any terrestrial and riparian animal found throughout their range. Similar to other large crocodilians, black caimans have even been observed catching and eating smaller species, such as the spectacled caiman and sometimes cannibalizing smaller individuals of their own kind. Hatchlings mostly eat small fish, frogs, and invertebrates such as molluscs, crustaceans, arachnids, and insects, but with time and size graduate to eating larger fish, including piranhas, catfish, and perch, as well as molluscs, which remain a significant food source for all black caimans. Dietary studies have focused on young caimans (due both to their often being more common than large adults and to their being easier to handle), the largest specimen examined for stomach contents in one study being only notably under sexually mature size, which is at a minimum in smaller females. Although diverse prey is known to be captured by young black caimans, dietary studies have shown snails often dominate the diet of young caiman, followed by quite small fish. Fish were the main prey of black caimans of over subadult size in Manú National Park, Peru. Various prey will be taken by availability, includes snakes, turtles, birds and mammals, the latter two mainly when they come to drink at the river banks. Mammalian prey mostly include common Amazonian species such as various monkeys, sloths, armadillos, pacas, porcupines, agoutis, coatis, and capybaras. Large prey can include other species of caimans, deer, peccaries, tapirs, anacondas, giant otters, Amazon river dolphins and domestic animals including pigs, cattle, horses, and dogs. Although rare predations on cougars or even jaguars have been reported, very little evidence exists of such predation, and cats are likely to avoid ponds with large adult black caimans, suggesting that adults of this species are higher in the food chain than even the jaguar. Where capybara and white-lipped peccary herds are common, they are reportedly among the most common prey item for large adults. Evidence has suggested fairly large river turtles can be counted among the prey of adult black caimans, the bite force of which is apparently sufficient to shatter a turtle shell. Large males have even been observed to cannibalize other Black Caimans. Compared to the smaller caiman species, the black caiman more often hunts terrestrially at night, using its acute hearing and sight. As with all crocodilian species, their teeth are designed to grab but not chew, so they generally try to swallow their food whole after drowning or crushing it. Large prey that cannot be swallowed whole are often stored so that the flesh will rot enough to allow the caiman to take bites out of the flesh.
===Reproduction===
At the end of the dry season, females build a nest of soil and vegetation, which is about across and wide. They lay up to 65 eggs (though usually somewhere between 30 and 60), which hatch in about six weeks, at the beginning of the wet season, when newly flooded marshes provide ideal habitat for the juveniles once hatched. The eggs are quite large, averaging in weight. Unguarded clutches (when the mother goes off to hunt) are readily devoured by a wide array of animals, regularly including mammals such as South American coatis (&quot;Nasua nasua&quot;) or large rodents, egg-preying snakes and birds such as herons and vultures. Occasionally predators are caught and killed by the mother caiman. Hatching is said to occur between 42 and 90 days after the eggs are laid. It is well documented that, as with other crocodilians, caimans frequently move their young from the nest in their mouths after hatching (whence the erroneous belief that they eat their young), and transport them to a safe pool. The mother will assist chirping, unhatched young to break out of the leathery eggs, by delicately breaking the eggs between her teeth. She will try to look after her young for several months but the baby caimans are largely independent and most do not survive to maturity. Baby black caimans are subject to predation even more regularly after they hatch, facing many of the same mesopredators, as well any other crocodilian (including those of their own species), large snake or large, carnivorous fish that they encounter. Predation is so common that black caimans count on their young to survive via safety in numbers. The female black caiman only breeds once every 2 to 3 years, and doesn&#x27;t become sexually mature until 20 years of age. During the dry season throughout the Black Caimans reproduction season, they will give off a sound that closely resembles like rumbling thunder in order to communicate with others.

===Interspecific predatory relationships===
Many predators, including various fish, mammal, reptile and even amphibian species, feed on caiman eggs and hatchlings. The black caiman shares its habitat with at least 3 other semi-amphibious animals considered apex predators, usually able to co-exist with them by focusing on different prey and micro-habitats. These are giant otters which are social and are obligate aquatic foragers and piscivorans, green anacondas which are predators of other caiman species, alongside sizable individuals of this caiman (albeit not regularly), and jaguars, which are the most terrestrial of these and focus their diet mainly on relatively larger mammals and terrestrial reptiles. Black caimans eat more or less all the same prey as the other species. They are possibly the most opportunistic but, despite being the largest predator of the area, can metabolically live off of their food longer and thus may not need to hunt as frequently. Usually, each predator avoids encounters with adults of the others but battles, which can be lost by nearly any side, may rarely occur. Green anaconda, jaguars and black caiman arguably sit atop this food chain. Once the black caiman attains a length of a few feet, it has few natural predators. Large anacondas may occasionally take smaller caiman of this species. The jaguar (&quot;Panthera onca&quot;), being a known predator of all other caiman species, is another primary predatory threat to juvenile and subadult black caimans, with several records of predation on young black caimans and eggs. However, adult black caimans have no natural predators, as is true of other similarly-sized crocodilian species given the size, weight, bite force, thick hide, and immense strength. Even though females and smaller individuals may be preyed on by jaguars, larger males may themselves prey upon jaguars in exceptional cases.

==Conservation status and threats==

Humans hunt black caimans for leather or meat. This species was classified as Endangered in the 1970s due to the high demand for its well-marked skin. The trade in black caiman leather peaked from the 1950s to 1970s, when the smaller but much more common spectacled caiman (&quot;Caiman crocodilus&quot;) became the more commonly hunted species. Local people still trade black caiman skins and meat today at a small scale but the species has rebounded overall from the overhunting in the past. That black caimans lay, on average, around 40 eggs has helped them recover to some degree. Perhaps an equal continuing threat is habitat destruction, since development and clear-cutting is now epidemic in South America. Spectacled caimans have now filled the niche of crocodilian predator of fish in many areas. Due to their greater numbers and faster reproductive abilities, the Spectacled populations are locally outcompeting black caimans, although the larger species dominates in a one-on-one basis. Persistent management is needed to control caiman-hunting and is quite difficult to enforce effectively. After the depletion of the black caiman population, piranhas and capybaras, having lost perhaps their primary predator, reached unnaturally high numbers. This has, in turn, led to increased agricultural and livestock losses.

Compounding the conservation issues it faces, this species occasionally preys on humans. Most tales are poorly documented and unconfirmed but, given this species&#x27; formidable size and strength, attacks on humans are quite often fatal.

The species is uncommon in captivity and breeding it has proven to be a challenge. The first captive breeding outside its native range was at Aalborg Zoo in 2013.

<doc id="1174712" wikidata="Q5271705" url="?curid=1174712" title="Dianne Walker">
<text>Dianne Walker (born March 8, 1951), also known as Lady Di, is an American tap dancer. Her thirty-year career spans Broadway, television, film, and international dance concerts. Walker is the artistic director of TapDancin, Inc. in Boston, Massachusetts.

==Career==
She began her dance training in Boston with Mildred Kennedy-Bradic and later studied with Leon Collins, Jimmy &quot;Sir Slyde&quot; Mitchell, and Jimmy Slyde. In 1979, she began a professional dance career. She later performed with Collins &amp; Company and became one of the Directors of the Leon Collins Dance Studio, Inc. in Brookline, Massachusetts.

She is considered a pioneer in the resurgence of tap dancing. The &quot;Boston Herald&quot; has called her &quot;America&#x27;s First Lady of Tap.&quot; Prominent contemporary tap dancer Savion Glover and his peers affectionately call her &quot;Aunt Dianne&quot; in acknowledgment of her unique place as a mentor, teacher, and confidante.

She is often seen in jazz clubs and festivals around the US. A memorable appearance was at the Rainbow Room in New York City with Ruth Brown, Grady Tate, Al McKibbon, and Sir Roland Hanna. Jazz Festival appearances include North Sea (The Hague), Pouri (throughout Europe), Chicago Jazz Festival and Montreal Jazz Festival with Gregory Hines. Dianne was featured in both the original Paris production and the two year Broadway run of Claudio Segovia and Hector Orezzoli&#x27;s musical &quot;Black and Blue&quot;. She is also in the PBS production of &quot;Black and Blue&quot; directed by Robert Altman. She was the only female to dance in the famed &quot;Hoofers Line&quot; which included Jimmy Slyde, Ralph Brown, Buster Brown, Lon Chaney, Chuck Green, Bunny Briggs, and Savion Glover.

While on Broadway, she performed &quot;Memories of You&quot;, a soft shoe choreographed by Cholly Atkins. She was also Assistant Choreographer and Dance Captain for the show&#x27;s Tony Award winning choreography and recreated choreography for a European tour of &quot;Black and Blue&quot;. She was featured in Fascinating Rhythms, a thirteen-city Dance Umbrella tour with Jimmy Slyde, Savion Glover, and bucket drummers Drummin Too Deep. She has appeared at the Smithsonian on several occasions honoring such distinguished artists as Cholly Atkins and Jeni Le Gon, and a special lecture/performance entitled &quot;Women in Tap.&quot; She also completed a year-long engagement of Savion Glover&#x27;s Concert Tour, entitled &quot;Footnotes,&quot; with Jimmy Slyde, Buster Brown, and Cartier Williams.

She is featured in the motion picture &quot;Tap&quot; starring Gregory Hines and Sammy Davis Jr., PBS Great Performances&#x27; &quot;Tap Dance in America&quot;, the documentary &quot;Honi Coles: The Class Act of Tap&quot;, the documentary &quot;Songs Unwritten...Leon Collins&quot;, and most recently as the principal commentator in the PBS release &quot;JUBA&quot;.

Ms. Walker holds a master&#x27;s degree in education. She has taught at numerous colleges, including Harvard, Williams College, the University of Michigan, and UCLA. She has been the recipient of grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, Massachusetts Cultural Council Jacobs Pillow, and the New England Foundation for the arts. She was a participant in the Dance USA Task Force on Dance Education and in 1997 represented the United States as an adjudicator for the World Tap Dance Championships held in Dresden, Germany. She is on the board of several tap dance organizations and was appointed, by the governor of Massachusetts, to a seat on the board of the Massachusetts Cultural Council, a post she has held since 1996.

She is quick to recognize her debt to many of the tap legends that have given to her so generously throughout her career, such as Honi Coles, Cholly Atkins, Eddie Brown, the Nicholas Brothers, Peg Leg Bates, Steve Condos, Henry LeTang, Prince Spencer, Gregory Hines, LaVaughn Robinson, and many others. Leon Collins died in 1985, leaving Dianne to continue as one of the directors of his school (1982–1995).

==Awards==
In 1997 in Boston, she was presented with the Tapestry Award for excellence in teaching from Thelma Goldberg of the Dance Inn in Lexington, Massachusetts. In 1998, she became the youngest dancer and first woman to receive the Living Treasure in American Dance Award from Oklahoma City University. She received the &quot;Savion Glover Award for Keeping the Beat Alive&quot; in St. Louis, Missouri in 2000. In 2003, she received a Flo-Bert Award, presented by the New York Committee To Celebrate National Tap Dance Day, in recognition of her lifetime achievement regarding tap dancing. In 2006, Dianne&#x27;s lifetime achievements were honored at a luncheon in Flint, Michigan. This award ceremony was sponsored by Tapology, Artistic and executive director, Alfred Bruce Bradley and the Mott Foundation. In 2005, she received another lifetime achievement recognition (Rhythm Bound) from director Sas Selford of the Vancouver Tap Dance Society. In 2004, Walker received the Hoofers Award from Tap City NYC and was also presented with an award in Los Angeles, in memory of Gregory Hines. That same year she was presented with The Humanitarian Award from Jason Samuels Smith of the Debbie Allen Dance Academy.

<doc id="1174715" wikidata="Q6494612" url="?curid=1174715" title="Last Rights (album)">
<text>Last Rights is the seventh studio album by Canadian electro-industrial band Skinny Puppy. It was released in March 1992 as the group&#x27;s final record distributed through Nettwerk. &quot;Last Rights&quot; saw the band experimenting with two opposite extremes: cacophonous heavy music and gloomy melodies, resulting in moments of industrial weight as well as moments of uncharacteristic softness. Along with containing some of the band&#x27;s most impenetrable walls of sound and an eleven-minute track composed almost entirely of manipulated and distorted samples, &quot;Last Rights&quot; also features Skinny Puppy&#x27;s first ballad.

The album&#x27;s production was troubled both internally and externally, involving tension within the band and threatened litigation from without. After its release, it was followed by Skinny Puppy&#x27;s last tour for twelve years. Despite &quot;Last Rights&quot;&#x27; difficulties, it was well-received and named by &quot;Alternative Press&quot; as one of the best albums of the 1990s. It spawned two singles, &quot;Inquisition&quot; in 1993 and &quot;Left Handshake&quot; (distributed under the title &quot;Track 10&quot;) in 2000, and was the band&#x27;s first release to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

==Background and production==
After Skinny Puppy released &quot;Too Dark Park&quot; in 1990, internal stress began to take its toll on the band. cEvin Key and Dwayne Goettel believed that vocalist Nivek Ogre was more interested in pursuing his solo career than maintaining Skinny Puppy, and his abuse of drugs (specifically injected cocaine and heroin) exacerbated the schism. Manager Mark Jowett recalled the time, saying, &quot;They internally combusted to some degree&quot;. Though the band was still functional and able to record music, much of the friendliness was gone when it came time to work on &quot;Last Rights&quot;. Dave Ogilvie, longtime producer and temporary member of Skinny Puppy during the 1988 &quot;VIVIsectVI&quot; sessions, acted as a middleman between the two halves of the band. First, he would record with Goettel and Key, and afterwards he would bring Ogre in and work with him in isolation. This disconnect between &quot;Last Rights&quot;&#x27; instrumental composition and vocal recording would prove vital to its discordant sound.

Ogre conceived of and recorded all of his lyrics in the studio with minimal planning. He considered the vocals a &quot;train of consciousness&quot; that powerfully reflected him in the moment. Key and Goettel also recorded their part of the music in-studio; about the process, Key said, &quot;I think with [&quot;Last Rights&quot;], it was our opportunity to just let the album create itself by the collective energies involved&quot;. Because the band had access to new equipment, Key and Goettel spent more time on the post-production of &quot;Last Rights&quot; than on any other Skinny Puppy album, specifically on noisy and complicated songs like &quot;Scrapyard&quot; and &quot;Download&quot;.

Many of the songs on the second half of &quot;Last Rights&quot; are either instrumental or feature protracted instrumental segments. According to Key, Ogre intended to finish more vocals than he did, but the state of him and the band cut the sessions short. Ogre reached the apex of his &quot;functional drug addiction&quot; during the album&#x27;s recording, and Key and Goettel were fearful for his life. Ogre experienced vivid, drug- and insomnia-induced hallucinations in the studio, leading to what he called the &quot;best sessions&quot; of recording. Often these intense experiences would end with him being taken to the hospital. After his third seizure, which occurred while he was recording background vocals to the song &quot;Knowhere?&quot;, and after contracting Hepatitis A, Ogre decided to drop narcotics and check himself into rehab. He remained there until Skinny Puppy embarked on a tour of North America. Following the release of &quot;Last Rights&quot; (which Ogre considered a document of his collapse) and its subsequent tour, Ogre was clean and the band was functioning, but the future of Skinny Puppy remained unclear.

===&quot;Left Handshake&quot;===
&quot;Last Rights&quot;&#x27; production encountered more problems when its tenth track was faced with legal action. The song in question, &quot;Left Handshake&quot;, featured vocal samples of Timothy Leary from his 1967 release &quot;Turn On, Tune In, Drop Out&quot;. Because so much of the album&#x27;s lyrics were about drugs and drug abuse, Key wanted the final statement of &quot;Last Rights&quot; to be his and Goettel&#x27;s take on the issue. Key considered &quot;Left Handshake&quot; as a &quot;last argument&quot; that &quot;really rounded off the album&quot;. What resulted was a sort of back-and-forth between the cut samples and the vocals of Ogre, who construed the sound bites as an attack on his addiction. The band obtained Leary&#x27;s permission to use his voice, but Henry G. Saperstein, owner of the copyright, threatened to sue Skinny Puppy if they released the song. As a result, &quot;Left Handshake&quot; was taken off &quot;Last Rights&quot;, and many releases of the album preserve the tenth track slot as blank. Despite this, the song was a staple of 1992&#x27;s live sets. &quot;Left Handshake&quot; would not see a release until eight years later when it was distributed in a limited capacity under the title &quot;Track 10&quot;.

==Composition and content==
Often described as Skinny Puppy&#x27;s darkest and most experimental work, &quot;Last Rights&quot; is a notably heavy, bleak, and dense album. It still retains the band&#x27;s electro-industrial roots and even has some dance aspects, but those elements give way to a heavy emphasis on walls of noise, atonal and highly distorted percussion, Ogre&#x27;s agonized screaming, and, alternatively, moments of unusual melodicism. The phrase &quot;audio sculpture&quot; has been used to refer to the sound of &quot;Last Rights&quot;. On the album, the group&#x27;s employment of samples was refined and, according to Tim DiGravina of AllMusic, put to better use than on past releases. Compared to Skinny Puppy&#x27;s previous work, &quot;Last Rights&quot; is a more internal and personal album, with some publications seeing it as prophetic of the band&#x27;s eventual demise. Ogre called the release his &quot;document of delusion&quot; and said that it captured the absolute height of the worst, most painful moments of his life. Because of the close nature of Ogre&#x27;s contributions, no lyrics were printed on the liner notes.

The album begins with the track &quot;Love in Vein&quot;, which was intended to be a 12-inch single but never saw individual release. Musically, the song starts with reversed and slow-motion samples before transitioning into a driving drum machine loop underlain with Ogre&#x27;s rasped vocals. As with much of the album, &quot;Love in Vein&quot; features a number of aural layers, such as samples from &quot;Revolution 9&quot; by the Beatles. Halfway through the song, extremely distorted and downtuned clips of Ogre&#x27;s vocals are introduced. &quot;Last Rights&quot;&#x27; second song and Skinny Puppy&#x27;s first ballad, &quot;Killing Game&quot;, is one of the group&#x27;s more well-known and atypical tracks, and Ogre said it rivaled 1989&#x27;s &quot;Worlock&quot; as the best Skinny Puppy song. It features melodic piano, a slow tempo with pounding percussion, and mournful vocals. Despite not being released as a single, &quot;Killing Game&quot; was the only song off of the album to receive a music video.

The album&#x27;s third track, &quot;Knowhere?&quot;, is one of Skinny Puppy&#x27;s darkest and heaviest. Sputnikmusic wrote that the percussion at the beginning of the song &quot;seems to be created through the combination of an explosion and a gunshot&quot;. Though almost all of the industrial metal influence that Al Jourgensen brought into Skinny Puppy with the 1989 album &quot;Rabies&quot; is absent on &quot;Last Rights&quot;, &quot;Knowhere?&quot; includes slow, chugging electric guitar buried beneath the distorted drums and shrieked vocals. The track peaks at a moment when the instruments build to complete, nearly indiscernible noise. In 1992, Sandra Garcia of &quot;B Side&quot; magazine wrote that the song &quot;stopped her dead three times&quot;, making her put the album down. She continued, saying, &quot;With the fourth try I realized it really was listening to someone going through hell&quot;. The next song, &quot;Mirror Saw&quot;, is a quieter, more morose track built around stilted drum clips and warbling, distant synthesizer sounds. It began as a demo recorded by Goettel to which the rest of the band later added live drums and additional sounds.

&quot;Inquisition&quot; marks &quot;Last Rights&quot;&#x27; midpoint and stands as its primary single. Despite being a propulsive, sample-heavy, pounding industrial dance track, it still acts as a lull from the album&#x27;s chaos. AllMusic&#x27;s John Bush saw the song as the album&#x27;s pinnacle, calling it a &quot;heart-stopping single whose production contributed just as much to the air of menace as Ogre&#x27;s vocals&quot;. Jon Selzer of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; described the song as a &quot;utopian lament&quot;. The sixth song, &quot;Scrapyard&quot;, is another assault of unconventional noises with jarring rhythmic stops, contrasting periods of acoustic guitar with growled vocals and relentlessly pounding kick drums. Key considered &quot;Scrapyard&quot; one of the album&#x27;s more exciting tracks. It features a sample from John Hughes&#x27; 1989 film &quot;Uncle Buck&quot;. &quot;Riverz End&quot;, the album&#x27;s first instrumental piece, combines two tracks from &quot;Rabies&quot;, &quot;Rivers&quot; and &quot;Choralone&quot;. Key intended the song to be one more break from cacophony, and Selzer deemed it another instance of hopeful sorrow. Diana Valois of &quot;The Morning Call&quot; called &quot;Riverz End&quot; pretty but compared it to a foul pool spiked with needles and rusted junk in the same breath.

&quot;Lust Chance&quot;, another largely instrumental song, provides an eerie combination of pornographic audio samples, reverberating and repetitious bass drums, and manipulated electronic sounds. Like &quot;Scrapyard&quot;, &quot;Lust Chance&quot; contains a sample from &quot;Uncle Buck&quot;, as well as one from Vancouver radio station CKLG 730. &quot;Last Rights&quot;&#x27; ninth and penultimate track, &quot;Circustance&quot;, begins with more gloomily optimistic sounds and quickly descends into loud percussion drowning out Ogre&#x27;s agonized mumbles. About this song, Valois wrote, &quot;carnival and cartoon giddiness, pig-like snorts and speedway radio static blip by, only to end in a soothing mantra of wind blowing over glass bottles or Peruvian pan pipes.&quot; Like many tracks from the album, &quot;Circustance&quot; spawned from an in-studio jam. The last song of the album, &quot;Download&quot;, stands in place of the original closing track, &quot;Left Handshake&quot;. It is entirely derived from manipulated samples and features little to no rhythm. Ogre compared &quot;Download&quot; to a flatline. Key and Goettel went on to form the band Download, which expanded upon the song&#x27;s early experimentation. About the track, Key said, &quot;Dwayne and Anthony [Valcic] sat up for like fourteen hours just editing, and that’s not including the manufacturing of the sounds they did. They had collected that over a period of two months. So there’s a lot of work where people might think ‘oh, that’s just a synthesizer or a patch.’ But it&#x27;s actually several hundred synthesizer patches.&quot;

==Live performances==
In May 1992, Skinny Puppy embarked on a North American tour with Godflesh and Thought Industry as opening acts. The stage show for &quot;Last Rights&quot; was less overtly violent and grotesque than on previous Skinny Puppy tours, focusing instead on coming to terms with negative emotions. During 1990&#x27;s &quot;Too Dark Park&quot; tour, the band played clips from Japanese snuff films in the &quot;Guinea Pig&quot; series and were surprised by the audience reactions; apparently, many perceived the gruesome images as real. Ogre, dismayed by fans who enjoyed the explicit gore for the wrong reasons, wanted to shift the band&#x27;s live tone to something more conceptual and introspective. He considered the &quot;Last Rights&quot; tour as a maturation, and thought of those 1992 performances as dark inward looks. Tim Gore, the band&#x27;s manager and assistant in designing the &quot;Too Dark Park&quot; shows, helped Ogre come up with the more nuanced set of theatrics, resulting in Skinny Puppy&#x27;s most ambitious and prop-heavy tour.

In preparation for the upcoming &quot;Last Rights&quot; shows, Ogre and William Morrison recorded and edited sixty-six minutes of backing video to sync up with the live performances. This footage was recorded at the same time as the &quot;Killing Game&quot; music video, which was intended to be a sample of the live show. Meanwhile, Gore was designing and fabricating the tour&#x27;s many props and Ogre&#x27;s many costumes. The two main elements, a virtual reality machine and a spinning display of severed heads called the Tree of No Cares, were set up on either side of the stage. The VR apparatus, into which Ogre occasionally went throughout the performance, represented his addiction and eventually came to mutate him. The backing film was timed so that whenever Ogre entered the machine, his face would appear onscreen and the audience could watch as something attacked and tortured him. Each time Ogre emerged from the apparatus, he would be altered. Gore also designed an elaborate full-body suit known as the Guiltman. Only appearing for the performance of &quot;Left Handshake&quot; at the end of each show, the Guiltman combined imagery of drug abuse and deformed sexuality to represent Ogre at the lowest point of addiction.

On June 8, 1992, at a concert in Boston, a number of people in the crowd jumped on stage and stole some of Ogre&#x27;s props. Gore pursued a thief and was himself punched by a security guard. Gore, who had difficulty breathing after the impact, was taken to the hospital, and the guard was fired.

==Release==
In March 1992, &quot;Last Rights&quot; was released. Much like the album&#x27;s production, its launch was fraught with issues. Initial pressings of the disc in Australia were flawed in that the track divisions were off by four seconds, meaning the first four seconds were missing from the album and the last four were silent. Other copies released in North America had the same issue, but heightened to thirty-nine seconds, resulting in wholly nonsensical track divisions. Nettwerk and Capitol Records quickly distributed a corrected run of copies with &quot;Quality Controlled&quot; stickers. Some Canadian prints of &quot;Last Rights&quot; mistakenly featured the CD art from &quot;Tormentor&quot; (1990), a single off of Skinny Puppy&#x27;s previous album, &quot;Too Dark Park&quot;. Despite these troubles, &quot;Last Rights&quot; was the group&#x27;s first album to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, peaking at position 193 and becoming Skinny Puppy&#x27;s most popular release at the time.

&quot;Last Rights&quot;&#x27; release was preceded by the &quot;Inquisition&quot; single, which came out on March 24, 1992, and included a B-side, &quot;Lahuman8&quot;, which was created at the request of the dance group La La La Human Steps. &quot;Love in Vein&quot; was planned as the album&#x27;s second single and prepared for release, complete with remixes and B-sides, but was ultimately canceled. Some of the material intended for the 12-inch was later released on Skinny Puppy&#x27;s 1996 compilation &quot;&quot;. Ultimately, &quot;Last Rights&quot; did not receive a second single until 2000, when &quot;Left Handshake&quot;, the song cut from the album due to legal concerns, was issued in a limited capacity under the title &quot;Track 10&quot;. One thousand copies were pressed, and they were sold at Skinny Puppy&#x27;s reformation concert in Germany.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Last Rights&quot; was met with positive reception. John Bush of AllMusic considered the album Skinny Puppy&#x27;s technical and artistic peak, going so far as to call it a &quot;sonic masterpiece&quot; that was &quot;ten years ahead of its time&quot;. Writing for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Jim Farber praised the album&#x27;s ugly intensity as well as its rare moments of melody. Jonathan Gold of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that Skinny Puppy &quot;plays dance music that nobody dances to and bellows gloomy manifestos that no one understands&quot;. Gold went on to call &quot;Last Rights&quot; an &quot;enormously ambitious work&quot; that mostly pulls it off. Sputnikmusic appreciated how challenging the album was and admired that the band, despite being on the brink of dissolution, managed to pull together such an impressive work. Jon Selzer of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; called &quot;Last Rights&quot; &quot;morbidly fascinating, unaccountably beautiful, and their best album yet.&quot; Writing for &quot;The Morning Call&quot;, Diana Valois said that if &quot;Last Rights&quot; closed Skinny Puppy&#x27;s career, it would be an admirable conclusion. In 1998, &quot;Alternative Press&quot; ranked &quot;Last Rights&quot; as the 58th best album of the 1990s. However, not all critics were taken with the album&#x27;s assault of sound. Dave Morrison of &quot;Select&quot; called the album &quot;a huge stir-fried noise that&#x27;s genuinely astonishing at times, but generally unfocused, often collapsing under its own weight&quot;.

<text>Pedro de Mendoza () (c. 1487 – June 23, 1537) was a Spanish &quot;conquistador&quot;, soldier and explorer, and the first &quot;adelantado&quot; of New Andalusia.

== Setting sail ==
Pedro de Mendoza was born in Guadix, Grenada, part of a large noble family that was preeminent in Spain. His family settled in Guadix after its reconquest by the Christians in 1489. He was a page at the Spanish court of Emperor Charles V and accompanied the sovereign on his trip to England. In 1524 he received the title of knight of the Order of Alcántara and later, through the influence of his father — the knight Fernando de Mendoza Guadix — entered the Order of Santiago. He later fought in the Italian Wars against the French, in which he participated in the Sack of Rome in 1527.

In 1529, he offered to explore South America at his own expense and establish colonies. Thanks to the efforts of his mother, María de Mendoza, in 1534 his offer was accepted: he was made &quot;adelantado&quot; governor, captain general, and chief justice over New Andalusia. This grant allowed him authority over as much land as he could conquer, within 200 leagues of the southern limit of New Toledo. Although this was measured along the Pacific coast, it was understood that his efforts would be directed towards the Río de la Plata on the Atlantic. The Emperor gave Mendoza 2000 men and 13 ships on the condition that within two years Mendoza should transport 1000 colonists, build roads into the interior, and construct three forts. He was to have half the treasure of the chiefs killed and nine-tenths of the ransom. The office of Governor was also, in theory, made hereditary.

That year, he set sail with a considerable fleet, but a terrible storm scattered it off the coast of Brazil. Here his lieutenant, Juan de Osorio, was assassinated, according to some authorities by the orders of Mendoza himself because of suspected disloyalty. Mendoza sailed up the Río de la Plata in 1535 and founded Buenos Aires on February 2, 1536.

Although Mendoza is said to be the founder of Rio de la Plata (and Buenos Aires), he was not a very effective leader because he was debilitated by a severe case of syphilis. He spent half of his time ill in bed, but he put as much effort as he could into the expedition. No notable campaigns occurred in the River Plate during this time, and the only chronicler was a German soldier named Ulderico Schmidt (or Ulrico Schmidl). Schmidt came over to the River Plate with Don Pedro and stayed there for eighteen years, fighting in almost every battle. His account of this early history of the River Plate region is the most important document from that time period.

== Battling the natives along the Rio de la Plata ==

At the Río de la Plata, the Spaniards encountered a group of roughly three thousand natives dispersed throughout the surrounding area known as the Querandíes, who shared with them their food, however scarce. In spite of this, the Spaniards soon took the natives and their generosity for granted and as a result, the Querandíes ended relations with the white men and relocated further away from the Spanish settlement. Angered by the sudden hostility, Mendoza sent his brother to lead a force against the natives.

Even though hundreds of natives were killed, Mendoza&#x27;s brother was slain as well, along with thirty of his men and several horses at the Battle of the Luján River. The natives were driven off after that bloody battle and their provisions were taken, but the fight was very costly to the Spaniards.

From &quot;The Devastation of the Indies: A Brief Account&quot; by Bartolomé de las Casas (a Spanish religious), written in 1542, published in 1552, under the subheadings &quot;The Rio de la Plata&quot; wherein de las Casas writes of &quot;A tyrannical Governor&quot;, the endnote #48 refers to this person as &quot;a certain Pedro de Mendoza&quot; and goes on to say,
 &quot;...ordered some of his men to go to a certain village for food...put to the sword more than 5,000 souls...&quot; Further, another group of &quot;Indians&quot; &quot;As they were killed, they cried out: &#x27;We came in peace to serve you, and you kill us! Our blood spattered on these walls will remain as a witness to our unjust death and to your cruelty!&#x27;&quot;

== Difficulties ==

The colonists&#x27; city was surrounded by a hastily made thick adobe wall made of mud. Every time it rained the wall partially dissolved. Along with this occasionally deteriorating wall, the colonists had to deal with another problem: famine. Food eventually became scarce, and the residents had to resort to eating rats, mice, snakes, lizards, rawhide boots, and even the bodies of those who died.

In addition to these difficulties, a coalition of the natives formed. They attacked the city again and again, many times leaving the city almost completely burned to the ground. Still suffering from syphilis, Mendoza appointed Juan de Ayolas to succeed him as captain-general.

Ayolas dealt with the problem by sailing up the Parana River with a large part of the remaining force. They defeated the Guaraní, made a treaty of friendship with them, and then Ayolas founded the city of Asunción (in current-day Paraguay) in 1537.

== Mendoza heads home ==
While all of this was going on, Mendoza, disappointed and broken in health, embarked for Spain in 1537. He died during the voyage. He promised to send aid to his forces that he left behind in Buenos Aires. Although he begged Spain to send more men and provisions to save his city in his will, the help that was sent was not sufficient.

In 1541, the settlers abandoned Buenos Aires and moved to Asunción. Domingo Martínez de Irala was elected as the third (though temporary) governor by these men. With Buenos Aires in ruins, Asunción became the base for the reconquest of the Rio de la Plata region.

<doc id="1174737" wikidata="Q2441812" url="?curid=1174737" title="Jacquet of Mantua">
<text>Jacquet of Mantua (Jacques Colebault, dit Jachet de Mantoue) (1483 – October 2, 1559) was a French composer of the Renaissance, who spent almost his entire life in Italy. He was an influential member of the generation between Josquin and Palestrina, and represents well the transitional polyphonic style between those two composers.

== Life ==

Jacquet was born in Vitré (Ille-et-Vilaine) and probably went to Italy at an early age. He was in Modena in 1519, working for the Rangoni family, and in 1525 was in Ferrara at the Este court, where he formed a close friendship with Adrian Willaert, the founder of the Venetian School. The next year he moved to Mantua, where he spent the rest of his life. He became &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; at the cathedral of Saint Peter, where his employer was Cardinal Ercole Gonzaga, the Bishop of Mantua. Cardinal Ercole Gonzaga was fond of Jacquet, and the relationship was mutually beneficial; when Gonzaga became the president of the Council of Trent, and the most enthusiastic supporter of the Counter-Reformation, he was a forceful advocate for the music of his favorite composer.

In addition to being recognized by his employer, the Medici popes Leo X and Clement VII also praised his music. Much of Jacquet&#x27;s music circulated widely, especially his motet &quot;Aspice Domine&quot; which appeared in over 30 contemporary sources.

Jacquet seems to have died in debt, a strange occurrence for one so well-connected and esteemed, especially by the Medici; however his family received a pension from Cardinal Ercole.

== Music ==

Jacquet wrote almost exclusively sacred vocal music. He was attentive to the trends of the time, and his music shows a clear stylistic progression from an early reliance on late 15th century practices to a later grasp of the pervasive imitation used by the generation of composers after Josquin. His craftsmanship is careful, and his counterpoint is fluid and graceful; parts are well-balanced, and occasional homophonic sections break the prevailing polyphonic texture. Most of his music is full-textured, with all voices singing.

He wrote 23 masses which have survived, and well over 100 motets. Many of the motets are for state occasions: arrivals of dignitaries, marriages, tributes, laments and so forth. Only three secular works have survived, and those are most likely early compositions; the more zealous leaders of the Counter-Reformation had a low opinion of secular music, and Jacquet seems to have obliged them.

In his later years, his music was simpler, and he wrote many hymns. The tendency of the Council of Trent at this time was to encourage relatively simple music in which the words could be clearly understood; Jacquet was both following this trend, and showing the natural development of a style which had embraced complex polyphony early, and which later sought simplicity and clarity.

<text>Kurt Moll (11 April 19385 March 2017) was a German operatic bass singer who enjoyed a widely renowned international career.

His voice was notable for its range, a true basso profondo, including full, resonant low and very-low notes with relaxed vibrato; also for its unusual combination of extreme volume-capacity and a purring, contrabassoon-like timbre. Although he had a powerful voice and stamina adequate for the most demanding parts, he was not a thunderer, and never performed as Wagner&#x27;s vocally athletic, bellowing bassos Hagen, Hans Sachs, nor Wotan. His interpretations tended to be restrained and intelligent, even in comedic roles like Osmin in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Die Entführung aus dem Serail&quot; and Baron Ochs in &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot;.

== Career ==
Moll was born in Buir, near Cologne, Germany. As a child, he played the cello and hoped to become a great cellist. He sang in the school choir whose conductor encouraged him to concentrate on singing. He studied voice at the Musikhochschule Köln. He joined the Cologne Opera at age 20 and remained a member of the ensemble until 1961. He then sang for three years at the Mainz Opera and five years at the Wuppertal Opera. In 1969, he accepted an engagement with the Hamburg State Opera, and then performed in major opera houses of Europe.

He made his Bayreuth Festival debut in 1968 as the nightwatchman in &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot;, and sang there for several years as Fafner in &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot;, Marke in &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; and Pogner in &quot;Die Meistersinger&quot;.

He made his American debut with the San Francisco Opera as Gurnemanz in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Parsifal&quot; in 1974, a role he reprised with the company in 2000. He made his debut at the Metropolitan Opera on the opening night of the 1977–78 season, appearing as the Landgrave in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;. He also sang there as Rocco in Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Fidelio&quot; and Sparafucile in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Rigoletto&quot;.

He made many recordings of opera, sacred music, Charpentier&#x27;s &quot;Te deum&quot; H.146, Magnificat H.74 in 1990 with Neville Mariner and lieder. Moll can be heard as Ochs in seven complete recordings of &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot;, as Sarastro in six recordings of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot;, as Marke in six sets of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;, and as the Archangel Raphael in three recordings of Haydn&#x27;s &quot;Die Schöpfung&quot;. His recording for the Orfeo label of Schubert&#x27;s philosophical &quot;Lieder für Bass&quot; set a new standard for these songs; he also recorded Schubert&#x27;s song-cycle &quot;Winterreise&quot;, and an album of dramatic/heroic ballads by Carl Loewe. Besides German, Italian, and Latin, he recorded a few roles in Russian, including Pimen in &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; and the Old Convict in &quot;Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District&quot; by Shostakovich. He can be seen in many roles on commercial video, including Sarastro (twice), Osmin, the Commendatore, Bartolo, Hunding in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Die Walküre&quot; (three times), Fafner in &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; and &quot;Siegfried&quot;, in Gurnemanz in &quot;Parsifal&quot;, and Ochs (three times).

==Awards and honors==

He won three Grammy Awards (1981, 1985, and 1989) for various opera CDs, and a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Classical Music/Dance for his performance as Hunding on the PBS television series &quot;Live from the Metropolitan Opera&quot; (also known as &quot;The Metropolitan Opera Presents&quot;), in 1991. In Germany he held the prestigious title Kammersänger. Moll was Bayerischer, Hamburger und Wiener Kammersänger.

==Retirement==

Moll retired from the stage in 2006, after singing the Nightwatchman at the Bavarian State Opera in Munich. He gave a master class in January 2011 at Carnegie Hall.

Moll lived in Cologne with his family until his death.

<text>SsangYong Group () was a South Korean chaebol (a Korean family-controlled conglomerate). Tracing its origins to 1939, by the 1970s it was one of the largest enterprise groups in the country, before disintegrating in the wake of the 1997 Asian financial crisis. Internationally, the group was best known as the parent of Ssangyong Engineering and Construction, SsangYong Cement, SsangYong Paper, Ssangyong Oil Refining, Ssangyong Investment &amp; Securities, and SsangYong Motor Company among its many interests.

The name &quot;SsangYong&quot; is taken from the Hanja characters 雙龍, which translate literally to &quot;Double Dragon.&quot;

==History==
Kim Sung-kon established his first manufacturing business, Samkong Fat Ltd., in his native North Gyeongsang Province in 1939, profiting greatly. Kim used the profits to help charter the Koryo Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Company in 1947, through which he acquired the Chosun Spinning Company&#x27;s factory in Anyang, Gyeonggi, which became the Kumsung Textile Company. This factory was destroyed in the Korean War in 1950, but Kim rebuilt it in 1954 with assistance from the United Nations Korean Reconstruction Agency. By the end of the decade, Kumsung was the second largest textile manufacturer in the country.

===Political influence===
Kim was well-connected politically to the Syngman Rhee regime and was elected to the National Assembly in 1958 with Rhee&#x27;s Liberal Party. After the May 16, 1961 coup which brought Park Chung Hee to power, however, he swiftly pivoted. In 2015, the &quot;JoongAng Ilbo&quot; published an account by Kim Jong-pil, first director of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency and later prime minister, which stated that Kim Sung-kon had requested that records of his earlier involvement with a leftist group in Daegu be suppressed in exchange for his loyalty to Park. Kim Jong-pil agreed to this, and Kim Sung-kon soon became a leading member of Park&#x27;s Democratic Republican Party (DRP).

Kim became the leader of the so-called &quot;TK group&quot; in the DRP, consisting of himself (as party finance chair), Baek Nam-uck (policy director), Gil Jae-ho (secretary general), and Kim Jin-man (floor leader in the National Assembly). Named for their collective origins in Taegu and Kyongbuk (the spellings of Daegu and North Gyeongsang in the McCune–Reischauer romanization scheme), the TK group were highly influential in implementing Park&#x27;s industrial policies during the Third Republic of Korea, channeling lucrative government contracts and adopting policies favorable to associates.

===Expansion===
Notably, Kim sold Kumsung Textiles in 1962 to invest in cement manufacturing in Gangwon Province. The SsangYong Cement Industrial Company, Ltd. would soon become Kim&#x27;s most important holding, and the plant in Donghae City would expand into the largest cement factory in the world. Kim made further investments in support of the cement concern, purchasing Samwha Paper to package the cement and founding Kumsung Shipping to deliver it, companies which later became SsangYong Paper Co. and SsangYong Shipping Co.

After the 1973 oil crisis, Kim negotiated a joint venture with Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran, to build an oil refinery in South Korea. The Korea-Iran Petroleum Co., Ltd. was incorporated in 1976 and began construction of its refinery at Ulsan. The facility received its first oil tanker in 1980, and later that year the company changed its name to the Ssangyong Oil Refining Co., Ltd.

===Final years of Kim Sung-kon===
In his role as DRP finance chair, Kim pressured Gulf Oil to make contributions to the party. In 1975 testimony before the U.S. Senate, Gulf Oil chair Bob Dorsey revealed that Gulf had paid $1 million in 1966 and another $3 million in 1970; Kim had originally demanded $10 million in 1970. The 1970 payment was transferred to UBS and there is no indication these funds ever reached South Korea.

Kim&#x27;s political career came to an end in 1971, when the TK group and Kim Jong-pil, by then prime minister, joined the opposition New Democratic Party in a motion to dismiss Oh Chi-sung, the minister of home affairs and a rival of Kim&#x27;s. The TK group believed Park would not discipline them as they had backed the constitutional amendment that allowed Park to stand in the 1971 South Korean presidential election, but he summoned Kim and the others who had voted for the motion to the Blue House and had them beaten, leading to their resignation from the party and thus the National Assembly. According to some accounts, Gil Jae-ho was forced to use a cane after the torture, and Kim Sung-kon was further humiliated by having his mustache plucked out.

After the October Restoration self-coup, when Park assumed near-dictatorial powers, the Heavy-Chemical Industry Drive was adopted as national industrial policy, which heavily favored the chaebol, including SsangYong. In a partial rapprochement, Park appointed Kim president of the Korea Chamber of Commerce, but Kim died of a stroke in 1975 at the age of 62.

===Second generation===
The chairmanship of SsangYong passed first to Kim Sung-kon&#x27;s eldest son, Kim Suk-won, who was only 29. The younger Kim continued SsangYong&#x27;s aggressive expansion into new industries including construction, motor vehicles, and securities. Sales grew more than 18,000%, to ₩14.6 trillion in 1994, when he stepped down to attempt a political career, from ₩79.7 billion in 1974, the year before he took control.

His younger brothers Kim Suk-joon and Milton Kim were also deeply involved in the company&#x27;s operations. Suk-joon became president of Ssangyong E&amp;C in 1983, chairman and CEO of SsangYong Motor in 1994, and group chairman in 1995. Youngest brother Milton began as an assistant manager at SsangYong Investment &amp; Securities in 1990, and rose to CEO in 1995. The brothers sometimes clashed on matters of management and strategy, Suk-won following the traditional business practices of their father and other chaebol, Milton introducing Western practices such as merit pay.

===Automotive investments===

Kim Suk-won was deeply interested in entering the auto manufacturing industry, and in 1986 the SsangYong Group acquired Dong-A Motor, which traced its history to Ha Dong Hwan Motor, founded in 1954. Dong-A manufactured jeeps for the U.S. military, as well as trucks and buses, and had acquired jeep manufacturer Keohwa in 1983. The following year, SsangYong purchased Panther Westwinds from the Jindo Corporation, and in 1988 the group was rebranded as SsangYong Motor Company.

In 1991, Kim Suk-won began a $2.5 billion expansion into SUVs and four-wheel drive vehicles. Over the next five years, however, the unit proved to be a financial drag, making ₩505 billion in losses and accumulating ₩3.4 trillion in debt. Cash flow was so tight that production of its first sedan, the SsangYong Chairman, was delayed 20 days, while development of other products was frozen.

===Breakup===
Kim Suk-joon, then chairman, began looking to sell parts of the conglomerate to raise cash, including negotiations with Samsung and later Daewoo for the automotive unit. He sold SsangYong Paper Co. to Procter &amp; Gamble in 1997 to raise cash. This infuriated Kim Suk-won, who resigned from the National Assembly and resumed chairmanship, but the Asian financial collapse made it impossible for the chaebol to refinance their debts, putting the South Korean economy in crisis and leading to a $60 billion IMF bailout. Late in 1997, SsangYong Motor was sold to rival Daewoo, as Milton pushed Suk-won to sell the securities firm as well. Daewoo itself would collapse after bankruptcy and a related corruption scandal, and control would pass to a succession of corporate owners until KG Group acquired it in 2022.

SsangYong Group continued its restructuring over the next several years, selling its Riverside Cement unit to Texas Industries in 1998, and a share of SsangYong Oil Refining to Saudi Aramco in 1999. Two hotels and the Yongpyong Resort, which SsangYong had acquired in 1983, were also put on the block. Even a share of the cement company was sold, in 2000, to Tokyo-based Taiheiyo Cement.

Since the aggressive restructuring, the Kim family has continued to run SsangYong E&amp;C, even after its acquisition by the Korea Asset Management Company (KAMCO) in 2002 and subsequent sale to the Investment Corporation of Dubai in 2015. They however were forced to relinquish control of SsangYong Cement, with Kim Suk-won stepping down in 2004.

<text>The Dilley sextuplets (born May 25, 1993) are the United States&#x27; first set of surviving sextuplets, born to Becki and Keith Dilley in Indianapolis, Indiana, United States. They are, in birth order:
==Biography==
The siblings were the first surviving sextuplets to be born in the USA.

The parents of the sextuplets, Becki and Keith Dilley, met as co-workers at a Wendy&#x27;s restaurant in Indiana. They married and attempted to conceive for 5 years without results. Following consultation with a doctor, they were told they had little chance of conceiving naturally. Following several more years of trying to conceive, they underwent fertility treatment using the drug Pergonal. The sextuplets were conceived as a result of this.

Throughout the pregnancy, all ultrasounds showed five babies. After five had been delivered the doctor reached in to retrieve the placenta and grabbed a foot instead, and said, &quot;There&#x27;s a sixth baby.&quot; Everyone initially thought she was kidding, but she wasn&#x27;t. The sixth was hiding behind the mother&#x27;s spleen.

The Dilley children have appeared on a few television segments, but say that they don&#x27;t want to live life &quot;under a microscope&quot;.

From 1997 the family have lived in Northeastern Indiana.

==Popular culture==
*An American film telling the story of the sextuplets&#x27; parents prior, and a few years after their births, called &quot;Half a Dozen Babies&quot; featuring real-life husband and wife Scott Reeves and Melissa Reeves was made in 1999 for ABC.

<text>Kurt Böhme (5 May 1908 – 20 December 1989) was a German bass.

He was born in Dresden, Germany, where he studied with Adolf Kluge at the Dresden Conservatory. He made his debut in 1930 in Bautzen in Der Freischütz, singing both Kaspar (a signature role he was to perform roughly 350 times) and, following a 3-minute costume change, the Hermit. From 1930–1950, he was a member of the Dresden State Opera, 1949 he became a member of the Munich State Opera and in 1955 a member of the Vienna State Opera. In the 1950s and 1960s he became known worldwide because of his acting talents, performing the buffo role of Baron Ochs (more than 500 performances) as well as the &#x27;heavies&#x27;: Kaspar (1954 with Wilhelm Furtwängler), Fafner (1958–1964 with Georg Solti), and &quot;Matteo&quot; in Fra Diavolo (Dresden November 1944).

He was best known for his interpretations of Wagnerian roles, and Mozart&#x27;s big bass roles (Osmin, Sarastro, and the Commendatore), and Baron Ochs von Lerchenau in Strauss&#x27; Der Rosenkavalier. His repertoire grew to 120 roles, including an impressive list of premieres that include Strauss&#x27; &quot;Arabella&quot; (1933) and &quot;Die schweigsame Frau&quot; (1935), Sutermeister&#x27;s &quot;Romeo und Julia&quot; (1940) and &quot;Die Zauberinsel&quot; (1942), Werner Egk&#x27;s &quot;Irische Legende&quot; (1955), Rolf Liebermann&#x27;s &quot;Schule der Frauen&quot; (1957) und Isang Yun&#x27;s &quot;Sim Tjon&quot; (1972).

He can be heard on numerous CDs, and seen on video in a speaking-only role (videotaped when he was 75 years old): the Third Priest in &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; (a performance from the &quot;Bayerischen Staatsoper&quot;, 1983, conducted by Wolfgang Sawallisch and featuring Lucia Popp, Francisco Araiza, and Kurt Moll). One of his earliest recorded performances, forty-two years earlier (1941), was in the role of the Speaker of the Temple of Wisdom in the same opera.

<text>The Omaha Community Playhouse, located at 6915 Cass Street in Omaha, Nebraska, United States, is a nationally recognized community theater.

Founded in 1924, the Playhouse&#x27;s first president was Alan McDonald, architect of the Joslyn Art Museum, and its first play, directed by Greg Foley in April 1925, was &quot;The Enchanted Cottage&quot;, which starred Dodie Brando, the mother of Marlon Brando.

When, later in the Playhouse&#x27;s first season, the need arose for a young man to play the lead for &quot;You and I&quot;, Dodie Brando suggested that twenty-year-old Henry Fonda, son of her friend Herberta Fonda, contact the director. The Playhouse would later see the acting debut of Marlon Brando, Dorothy McGuire, and Julie Wilson, and appearances by Letitia Baldrige, Glenn Cunningham, and Lenka Peterson.

The Nebraska Theatre Caravan, the playhouse&#x27;s touring unit, was founded in 1976.

The Playhouse experienced tremendous growth throughout the 1980s and 1990s under the direction of Charles Jones.

<text>The Firth of Thames () is a large bay located in the north of the North Island of New Zealand. It is the firth of the rivers Waihou and Piako, the former of which was formerly named the Thames River, and the town of Thames lies on its southeastern coast.

Its Maori name is &quot;Tikapa&quot;. In traditional legend, the firth and the greater Hauraki Gulf are protected by a taniwha named Ureia, who takes the form of a whale.

The firth lies at the southern end of the Hauraki Gulf, southeast of the city of Auckland. It occupies a rift valley or graben between the Coromandel Peninsula and Hunua Ranges, which continues into the Hauraki Plains to the south.

==Conservation==
The Firth of Thames is an important site for waders or shorebirds, and is listed as a wetland of international importance under the Ramsar Convention. The Miranda Shorebird Centre, operated by the Miranda Naturalists&#x27; Trust, is located on the Seabird Coast, on the western shore of the bay at Miranda.

However, the firth overall is severely damaged by man-made influences, especially dairy-farm run-off, and has not recovered from large-scale mussel dredging over 40 years after the practice ceased (more information in the Hauraki Gulf article).

Whales such as southern right whales (one of two of the first confirmed birth records in main islands waters since the end of commercial and illegal whaling was observed in Browns Bay region in 2012) and Bryde&#x27;s whales can be seen in the bay to calve and rest.

<doc id="1174800" wikidata="Q1761526" url="?curid=1174800" title="Wanderland">
<text>Wanderland is the second studio album by American singer Kelis, released on October 17, 2001, by Virgin Records. The album&#x27;s only single, &quot;Young, Fresh n&#x27; New&quot;, peaked at number 32 on the UK Singles Chart. As of October 2004, &quot;Wanderland&quot; had sold 17,000 copies in the United Kingdom.

==Background and release==
According to Kelis, Virgin Records did not understand &quot;Wanderland&quot;. She subsequently left the label around the time of the album&#x27;s European release, and as a result, the album was not released in the United States. &quot;Wanderland&quot; was officially released in the US to digital retailers on May 31, 2019, and to streaming services on June 5.

The song &quot;Flash Back&quot; (retitled &quot;Flashback&quot;) was included on Kelis&#x27; subsequent album &quot;Tasty&quot;, while a new version of &quot;Popular Thug&quot;, which replaced Pusha T of Clipse with Nas, appears on The Neptunes&#x27; 2003 compilation album &quot;Clones&quot;.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Wanderland&quot; received generally positive reviews from music critics. &quot;The Guardian&quot; critic Alexis Petridis described the music as &quot;clever, exhilarating and original&quot; and praised the album as The Neptunes&#x27; &quot;most adventurous work to date&quot;. Mark Bautz of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; commented that &quot;Kelis&#x27; brash blend of Curtis Mayfield soul, techno-Zeppelin funk, Jobim-lite bossa nova, and ultrasmooth R&amp;B shows a more coherent artistry than many recent boundary-busting experiments.&quot; Rupert Howe of &quot;Blender&quot; found that &quot;[t]he best thing about &quot;Wanderland&quot; is that [Kelis] seems finally to have begun celebrating her eccentricities&quot;, adding, &quot;Aside from the idiosyncratic lyrics [...] she switchbacks from parodying &#x27;70s mack-stylin&#x27; (the Funkadelic &#x27;Daddy&#x27;) to an &#x27;80s soul croon (&#x27;Scared Money&#x27;).&quot; At entertainment.ie, Andrew Lynch commended Kelis&#x27; &quot;aggressive vocal delivery and intriguing, if sometimes confusing lyrical imagery&quot;, while calling the album itself &quot;[b]rilliantly produced&quot; and &quot;strikingly original&quot;.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Barry Walters noted that, musically, &quot;Wanderland&quot; &quot;doesn&#x27;t venture far from its predecessor, &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot;: The Neptunes are still matching jaunty beats to techno sonics. But her pen is busier now, and the result is smarter, more nuanced but no less confrontational.&quot; Andy Kellman of AllMusic stated that &quot;the album&#x27;s first three songs—&#x27;Young, Fresh n&#x27; New,&#x27; &#x27;Flash Back,&#x27; and &#x27;Popular Thug&#x27;—are on an even standing with the best of the singer&#x27;s debut [...] After that solid beginning, the album continually loses steam and gains it back.&quot; Stephen Dalton of &quot;NME&quot; viewed the album as &quot;a solid sophomore effort&quot;, but felt that &quot;there is way too much filler here for a hotly hyped alterna-soul princess with her eyes on the big prize.&quot; Sal Cinquemani of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; opined that the album is &quot;far from rote, but the Neptunes&#x27;s rehashed retro beats and synths are beginning to sound derivative of Britney Spears&#x27;s &#x27;I&#x27;m a Slave 4 U.&#x27; Much of the disc&#x27;s hooks are unchallenging and repetitive at best.&quot; In &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), Ernest Hardy and Arion Berger were critical of the album, writing that &quot;[t]he beats that brought &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; to life are gone, and only Kelis&#x27; hippieish and overly self-aware songwriting remains.&quot;

<doc id="1174802" wikidata="Q3482303" url="?curid=1174802" title="White (political adjective)">
<text>White or White- (белый, бело-), was a political term used as an adjective, noun or a prefix by Bolsheviks to designate their real and alleged enemies of all sorts, by analogy with the White Army.

*White-Guardist (&quot;белогвардеец&quot;): a member of the &quot;White Guard&quot;. The members of the White movement never applied the term &quot;White Guardist&quot; to themselves. Also, White-Guardists were called simply &quot;Whites&quot; (&#x27;белые&#x27;, &#x27;беляки&#x27;) by their opponents.
*[[White émigré]] (белоэмигрант): any citizen of the Tsarist Russian Empire who left the country during the Russian Revolution or the Russian Civil War (1917-1922). White emigrants were perceived as a threat to the Soviet state, a source of espionage and counter-revolutionary plots.
*White Poles (белополяки): a term that appeared during the Polish–Soviet War, and later reemerged during the annexation of a part of Poland in World War II.
*[[White Guard (Finland)|White-Finn]] (белофинн): a term introduced during the unsuccessful attempt to initiate a revolution in Finland in 1917-1918, and reintroduced as part of the propaganda related to the preparation of the Winter War against Finland. the term continued to be in the subsequent use, e.g., in the context of the East Karelian uprising.
*White-Chinese (белокитаец): a term denoting Chinese forces that fought together with the White Army in Siberia and the Russian Far East, as well as anti-communist Chinese (such as the Kuomintang) during the Chinese Civil War.
*White-Czechs (белочехи): members of the Czechoslovak Legion.
*White-Cossacks (белоказаки): cossack military that fought against the Bolsheviks during the Civil War.
*White-Esers (белоэсеры): the supporters of the anti-Bolshevik Eser party (as opposed to Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, which split by the end of 1917 and sided with Bolsheviks during the Civil War). The term was widely used in, though not limited to, Siberia, where they led the regionalist Provisional Siberian government, and were known as &#x27;right Esers&#x27; or simply &#x27;the Esers&#x27; elsewhere.
These terms were supposed to distinguish, e.g., &quot;good Poles&quot; from &quot;bad Poles&quot;, and usually bore a derogatory gist.

<doc id="1174808" wikidata="Q556858" url="?curid=1174808" title="José Cura">
<text>José Luis Victor Cura Gómez (born 5 December 1962) is an Argentine operatic tenor, conductor, director, scenographer and photographer known for intense and original interpretations of opera characters, notably &quot;Otello&quot; in Verdi’s &quot;Otello&quot;, &quot;Samson&quot; in Saint-Saëns’ &quot;Samson et Dalila&quot;, &quot;Canio&quot; in Ruggero Leoncavallo&#x27;s &quot;Pagliacci&quot;, &quot;Stiffelio&quot; in Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Stiffelio&quot; and many others.

2007 saw the world-premiere of &quot;La Commedia è finita&quot;. The show, designed and directed by José Cura – in which he also sang the lead role of Canio – marked the beginning of his career as a director and scenographer. He followed this with his productions of &quot;Samson et Dalila&quot; at the Badisches Staatstheater in 2010 (in which he also sang the title role) as well as &quot;La Rondine&quot; at the Opéra national de Lorraine (in which he also conducted) and &quot;Cavalleria Rusticana and Pagliacci&quot; at the Opéra Royal de Wallonie, both in 2012 – singing the roles of &quot;Turiddu&quot; and &quot;Canio&quot; in both as well.

==Early life==
José Cura was born in Rosario, Argentina. At the age of 12 he was playing guitar under Juan di Lorenzo&#x27;s guidance; at 15 he made his debut as a choral director; and at 16 he began studies in composition with Carlos Castro and piano with Zulma Cabrera.

In 1982, he entered the Music School at the Universidad Nacional de Rosario to continue his musical education; the following year he became assistant conductor of the university choir. At 21, he won a grant to study at the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires, where he remained for six months.

Cura continued to sing in the opera chorus while focusing on composition and conducting until 1988, when he began working with Horacio Amauri to develop his singing technique.
Determined to make a career in opera, José Cura moved to Italy in 1991 and began voice training with Vittorio Terranova. In February 1992 he made his debut in Verona as the father in Henze&#x27;s &quot;Pollicino&quot;. In Genoa he played Le Remendado in Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot; and the Capitano de ballestrieri in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Simon Boccanegra&quot;.

==Career as opera singer==

Cura&#x27;s first starring role came in 1993 in &quot;Signorina Julia&quot; by Bibalo at the Teatro Lirico Giuseppe Verdi in Trieste, Italy.

He began 1994 with a series of highly successful debuts: Ismaele in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Nabucco&quot; in Genoa and Don Alvaro in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;La Forza del Destino&quot; in Turin were followed with Ruggero in the world premiere of the third version of Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La Rondine&quot; (Turin) and Roberto in the same composer&#x27;s rarely performed first opera, &quot;Le Villi&quot; (Martina Franca); the latter performance is particularly noteworthy for providing Cura&#x27;s first complete opera recording.

In the same year Cura won the first prize of Plácido Domingo&#x27;s Operalia competition.

In November, he made his US debut in Chicago as Loris Ipanov in Giordano&#x27;s &quot;Fedora&quot;, opposite Mirella Freni; he subsequently reprised the role in Trieste in 1995, in London in 1996, in Vienna in 1997 and 1998, and in Tokyo, Zurich and Lecce, Italy, in 1998.

===1995–2000===
He continued adding roles to his expanding repertoire in 1995. In February, he returned to Italy to star as Paolo il Bello in the Palermo production of Zandonai&#x27;s &quot;Francesca da Rimini&quot;. In June Cura debuted in London&#x27;s Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in the title role of &quot;Stiffelio&quot; on the opening night of the Verdi Festival.

In 1996, Cura built upon his burgeoning reputation and solidified his position as one of the most promising tenors of his generation. Following his portrayal of Osaka in Mascagni&#x27;s allegorical opera &quot;Iris&quot; at the Rome Opera in January, he returned to London to star in Saint-Saëns&#x27; &quot;Samson et Dalila&quot;, a role for which he has received international acclaim. For his debuts in Los Angeles and San Francisco, Cura added two roles to his repertoire, Pollione in Bellini&#x27;s &quot;Norma&quot; and Don José in &quot;Carmen&quot;.

Other key roles included &quot;Le Villi&quot;, Leoncavallo&#x27;s &quot;Pagliacci&quot; and Giordano&#x27;s &quot;Andrea Chénier&quot; at Opernhaus Zurich, Mascagni&#x27;s &quot;Cavalleria Rusticana&quot; at the Ravenna Festival (conducted by Riccardo Muti and broadcast on Italian television), and &quot;Pagliacci&quot; at Amsterdam&#x27;s Concertgebouw (conducted by Riccardo Chailly and televised live). In December, he starred in the Puccini segment of the BBC &quot;Great Composers&quot; documentary, telecast in December 1997.

Cura&#x27;s debut at Milan&#x27;s La Scala came in January 1997, when he starred as Enzo in Ponchielli&#x27;s &quot;La Gioconda&quot;. Cura returned to La Scala in June 1998 as Des Grieux in Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot; and again in February 1999 for &quot;La Forza del Destino&quot;, both conducted by Riccardo Muti.

In 1997, José Cura sang duets with the famous classical crossover soprano Sarah Brightman, singing &quot;Just Show Me How to Love You&quot;, and &quot;There For Me&quot;, songs released in her album &quot;Time to Say Goodbye&quot;.

With a growing international reputation and increased critical interest, José Cura made a pivotal career decision in 1997: at Turin&#x27;s Teatro Regio, at age 34, Cura debuted in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Otello&quot;, telecast live on Italian television. Under the baton of Claudio Abbado La Nazione ran the headline &quot;José Cura: a new Otello is born!&quot; Opera houses around the world agreed, offering Cura the opportunity to take his Moor to London, Washington, Madrid, Trieste, Munich, Buenos Aires, Nice, Paris, Vienna, Zurich, Warsaw, Tokyo, and Florence – making him one of the most eagerly sought-after Otellos of his generation.
Following his &quot;Otello&quot; debut, Cura starred in &quot;Cavalleria Rusticana&quot; in Bologna, &quot;Tosca&quot; in Torre del Lago, &quot;Fedora&quot; in Vienna, and in an acclaimed &quot;Samson et Dalila&quot; in Turin. He made his first appearance as leading man at the Arena di Verona in summer of 1997 in &quot;Carmen&quot;. He headlined in a Night of the Stars Gala in London and concluded the year with a series of sensational concerts in Germany.

It was followed in 1998 when he first appeared in &quot;Aida&quot; at the inaugural season of the New Imperial Theatre in Tokyo.

Firmly entrenched as one of the great modern voices, in 1999 José Cura returned to Paris for &quot;Carmen&quot; Milan for &quot;La Forza del Destino&quot; and Verona for &quot;Aida&quot; (televised – the first opera ever to be broadcast live over the internet). The year ended with his debuts at New York&#x27;s Metropolitan Opera in &quot;Cavalleria Rusticana&quot; as only the second tenor in the Met&#x27;s history to make his debut on opening night (the other having been Caruso in 1903) and at Madrid&#x27;s Teatro Real in &quot;Otello&quot; conducted by his long-time friend and mentor, Maestro Luis Antonio García Navarro.

===2000–2005===

In 2000, José Cura sang &quot;Otello&quot; in Washington and starred as Alfredo in &quot;La Traviata a Paris&quot; a groundbreaking production staged in authentic Paris settings while being telecast live around the world.

In 2001 José Cura appeared in numerous special performances and opera productions honoring the Centenary of Verdi&#x27;s death, including &quot;Otello&quot; at the Wiener Staatsoper on 27 January (the date of Verdi&#x27;s death), Paris&#x27; Theatre du Chatelet, London&#x27;s Covent Garden, Trieste&#x27;s Teatro Verdi and the Zurich Opera House. He sang in performances of &quot;Aida&quot; in Greece and Japan and created a memorable Don Carlo in Zurich. He gave two concerts with soprano Daniela Dessi celebrating Verdi&#x27;s art at the Barbican Centre in London and shared the concert stage with Renato Bruson in Parma for an evening of Verdi arias and duets.

Cura continued his stellar run of Verdi productions into 2002, when he starred as Manrico in the ROH (ROH) production of &quot;Il Trovatore&quot;, reprised &quot;Otello&quot; in Zurich, and brought his Moor to Warsaw for a special, one-time-only performance. He also appeared in Tokyo in &quot;Tosca&quot;, Vienna in &quot;Pagliacci&quot;, and London in &quot;Samson et Dalila&quot; in a concert version at the Barbican Centre under the baton of Sir Colin Davis. Other important concerts in 2002 included four outdoor venues: Dalhalla, Sweden; Lodz, Poland; Herod Atticus, Athens, Greece; and Hyde Park, London, where Cura entertained an audience estimated at 40,000. Other notable venues included the National Concert Hall in Taipei, the Pavilhao Atlantico in Lisbon, and the Kremlin in Moscow.

Operas performed in early 2003 included &quot;Otello&quot; (Tokyo), &quot;Don Carlo&quot; (Zurich) and &quot;Tosca&quot; (Vienna). In June, Cura debuted as Calaf in the Arena di Verona production of Puccini&#x27;s fantasy opera, &quot;Turandot&quot;.

Cura began the 2003/2004 with his debut at the Wiener Staatsoper as the prophet Jean in Massenet&#x27;s rarely performed &quot;Hérodiade&quot;. In November 2003, Cura returned to the Verdi repertoire to reprise his role of &quot;Don Carlo&quot; and Alfredo in &quot;La Traviata&quot;, both in Zurich.

In December and January (2004) he made his return to the US, starring in the Lyric Opera of Chicago&#x27;s production of &quot;Samson et Dalila&quot;; in March he reprised the role at the Royal Opera House in London. In Vienna, he introduced an intensely personal &quot;Andrea Chénier&quot;. In Zurich, Cura triumphed as Dick Johnson in Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La fanciulla del west&quot;. In April, Cura conducted &quot;Madame Butterfly&quot; in Warsaw.

José Cura has been a strong advocate for making classical music accessible to the masses, as demonstrated in his participation in two spectacular events in early 2004. In February, Maestro Cura took up the baton to conduct Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot; in Piacenza, Italy, in a unique, modern production held in a vast public exhibition hall, designed to open the performance to the widest possible audience. In May, he traveled to Seoul for several performances of &quot;Carmen&quot;, an extravagant experiment in bringing opera to the people of Asia. Held in an outdoor arena seating 37,000 spectators and performed on a 120-meter long stage outfitted with a video screen the size of a football field. Cura finished the 2003/2004 opera season with &quot;Otello&quot; in Hamburg and &quot;Carmen&quot; in Warsaw.

In September 2004, José Cura returned to Zurich for a revival of &quot;Otello&quot;, followed by the house premiere of &quot;Stiffelio&quot; in the title role.
Cura returned to Lisbon at the end of October to headline a special evening of music for the Associacao Portuguesa Contra a Leucemia. With his eclectic mix of American Spirituals, operatic favorites and Argentine songs, as well as his conducting of Orff, Rachmaninov, and Borodin. Switching hats for the second act, Cura became the consummate pop star, sharing the stage with some of the nation&#x27;s most recognizable singers in duets of familiar Portuguese songs.

On 2 November he hosted the night of ten tenors at the Royal Festival Hall in London. Cura did double-duty as tenor and maestro: he delivered some of opera&#x27;s most well-known arias, then he stepped onto the podium to display not only his conducting skills but also his innate sensitivity to the needs of his nine young soloists.

===2005–2010===
Cura opened the calendar year of 2005 with a concert-version of &quot;Il Corsaro&quot; in Barcelona followed with Samson et Dalila at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City.
In spring 2005, Cura focused his considerable talents on portraying Canio in Berlin and Piacenza in two very different productions. In June, Cura returned to Verona as Radames for two performances of &quot;Aida&quot; in a Franco Zeffirelli production. In July, he traveled to Munich for two performances of &quot;Otello&quot;. José Cura ended his 2005 opera season with a run of &quot;Turandot&quot; at the Arena di Verona.
Cura&#x27;s first concert of 2005 featured the star soprano Anna Netrebko; both performed before a crowd of 8,000 at the Cologne arena (Lanxess Arena). In July, Cura took part in the opening ceremonies of the World Games in Duisburg, Germany.

Cura started the 2005/2006 season in London starring as Puccini&#x27;s outlaw hero Dick Johnson in the much-anticipated ROH production of &quot;La fanciulla del west&quot; (September). Cura then reprised the role of Roberto in Puccini&#x27;s rarely staged first opera, &quot;Le Villi&quot; in Vienna (October). In January 2006, Cura returned to the stage in the title role in &quot;Andrea Chénier&quot; at Teatro Comunale di Bologna. In February, José Cura re-introduced the audience at the Liceu of Barcelona to Verdi&#x27;s masterpiece, &quot;Otello&quot;, after an eighteen-year absence.

After reprising his Alfredo in &quot;La Traviata&quot; and &quot;Stiffelio&quot; in the much-neglected Verdi opera of the same name, Cura became the first tenor to bring Calaf to life in the Zurich Opera&#x27;s avant garde production of Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Turandot&quot;. Cura reprises the role in Zurich in the 2006/2007 season and will again in 2007/2008. From Zurich, Cura traveled to Vienna to star in &quot;Le Villi&quot;, and conduct &quot;Madame Butterfly&quot; at the Vienna State Opera. In June, Cura returned to Japan to reprise the lead role in &quot;Andrea Chénier&quot; with the Teatro Comunale di Bologna. His performance was greeted with enthusiastic applause led by the Japanese Prime Minister, Junichiro Koizumi, a noted opera lover.
Cura&#x27;s summer took an unexpected turn when he arrived in Verona for the first of several performances as Canio in &quot;Pagliacci&quot;: the tenor scheduled for the role of Turiddu in the double-header &quot;Cavalleria Rusticana&quot; was forced to withdraw at the last minute, leaving the Arena di Verona without a world-class tenor to sing the role. Cura responded immediately. Stepping onto the ancient Roman stones in brutal summer heat, still suffering the effects from jet-lag and trying to recall the role he had not sung in over six years, he repaid a debt of honor to the theater that first opened its arms to him in 1992. It was not an offer made lightly Cura became only the third tenor in 84 years of Arena history to undertake this daunting challenge. In mid-July, Cura traveled to Rijeka, Croatia, for a summer night of music making. Following an early September 2006 engagement in Vienna as Roberto in Le Villi, Cura traveled to Berlin to end the month in the Deutsche Oper&#x27;s revival of &quot;La fanciulla del west&quot;. In October, Cura made a return to Turin to star as Calaf in an innovative staging of &quot;Turandot&quot;.

Cura returned to the United States at the end of October for a series of performances at the Metropolitan Opera and two very different concerts. He first starred as Mario Cavaradossi in the lavish Franco Zeffirelli production of &quot;Tosca&quot;.
Then, Cura found time during his brief stay in New York to fly to Miami as special guest of the Orquestra de São Paulo for a night of Latin-accented music.
Cura also took part in the Richard Tucker Music Foundation Gala, a prestigious annual event that features outstanding opera singers performing arias and scenes.
In a rare treat for fans of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Don Carlo&quot;, Cura reprised his acclaimed portrayal of the tortured, insecure Infant in Zurich at the end of November and then brought an entirely different &quot;Don Carlo&quot; to Vienna, where he shared the stage with some of today&#x27;s most distinguished performers.

Cura emerged from a brief holiday for three opera galas and a reprise of his &quot;Pagliacci&quot; in Berlin. In Zurich, he closed out the year with his &quot;Turandot&quot;; in Palermo, he presented his heroic Mario Cavaradossi in a controversial &quot;Tosca&quot;; and in Karlsruhe, he graciously filled in at the last minute for a colleague in a production of the same opera before returning to Berlin to perform his Canio.
Following a fund-raising gala in Lisbon for the Associacao Portuguesa contra a Leucemia, Cura offered a one-night-only presentation of his acclaimed &quot;Otello&quot; in Mannheim before traveling to Shanghai with the Zurich Opera for &quot;Turandot&quot; and a special Valentine&#x27;s Day orchestral concert. Cura also took time out to hold an extensive master class for a select group of international singers and a follow-up concert in Devon in his role of Patron to the New Devon Opera.
In June, Cura pulled off an exciting tour de force when he returned to Rijeka, Croatia, wearing a coat of many fabrics—director, set designer and playwright in his production of &quot;La Commedia è finita&quot;.

What had been planned as a summer sabbatical with his family turned into a triumphant professional return to Argentina in June. He began with his participation in the rededication of the Monument to the Flag in his hometown (where he was introduced as one of the 50 extraordinary lights Rosario had sent into the world), then offering a series of semi-staged, rapturously received performances of &quot;Samson et Dalila&quot;, an unforgettable, intimate concert where he unveiled new compositions based on the poetry of Pablo Neruda, and ended with a master class held for aspiring local singers.
José Cura ended the hot summer months in Cortona, Italy, with two concerts at the prestigious Tuscan Sun Festival; Cura led the Russian National Orchestra in an evening full of gems from the Russian orchestral repertoire and followed up with a vocal concert featuring some of the most popular pieces from Leoncavallo, Puccini, Verdi, and Bizet.
He followed with a concert performance in Halle, sharing the stage once more with soprano Anna Netrebko in an evening of arias and duets in front of a sold-out audience of over 8,000.

Cura then returned to Barcelona for a month-long run of &quot;Andrea Chénier&quot; at the Liceu. Following a gala concert in Lisbon once more in support of Associacao Portuguesa Contra a Leucemia, Cura traveled to Cologne to headline in the famous verismo double-bill of Cav/Pag.
Between performances in Cologne, Cura presented two concerts in Eindhoven (the second added by popular demand).

In January 2008 José Cura offered opera lovers a wonderful gift when he starred in Massenet&#x27;s rarely performed &quot;Le Cid&quot; at the Zurich opera – his father, Oscar Cura, had died on the morning of the premiere back in his native Argentina, and despite the tremendous weight of the personal tragedy, the tenor still performed that night, to solidary tears and a standing ovation from all those present that night. Cura dedicated the performance to his father, and flew to his native town of Rosario, Argentina, the next day.

In early February, Cura took time out from his run of &quot;Le Cid&quot; in Zurich to conduct Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot; for the Hungarian charity Salva Vita, an organization dedicated to helping handicapped citizens gain increased independence through vocational education. After conducting at the Deutsche Oper in Berlin in March, Cura made his much anticipated return the United States in &quot;Pagliacci&quot; at the San Diego Opera – the first time he had performed Canio in North America.
Returning to Europe, Cura sang &quot;Otello&quot; at the Staatsoper in Hannover for a single gala performance. He followed that performance with a gala concert in Düsseldorf and offered his Cavaradossi in &quot;Tosca&quot; in Karlsruhe.
The month of June found that Cura was firmly entrenched in Italian theater, returning to Bologna for one of his signature roles, Samson, and then on to Turin for Puccini&#x27;s rarely performed &quot;Edgar&quot; in an early celebration of the 150th anniversary of Puccini&#x27;s birth.

Cura rounded up the summer months with a brief return to Zurich for two performances of &quot;Turandot&quot; and performed in concert at the Festival of Toledo and at the Tuscan Sun Festival in Cortona – where he also presented an exhibition of his photography in advance of the release of his first collection, Espontáneas: Photography by José Cura. Cura finished the summer season with &quot;Samson et Dalila&quot; in Santander, Spain.

The start of the 2008/2009 season saw Cura engaged in a labor of love: presenting a master class for the New Devon Opera, a charity for which he is Patron. In mid-September, he returned to the Royal Opera House to reprise Dick Johnson in &quot;La Fanciulla del West&quot;.
Cura followed his run of Fanciulla performances with two notable concerts, one in Zagreb and the second in Nancy. The latter performance came a year after his celebrated master class for Nancy Opera Passion and in advance of his 2010 masterclass in the same city.

The Auditorio de Tenerife hosted Cura in November when he brought his &quot;Otello&quot; to the Atlantic Island for the fall festival. He then closed the month of November in Mannheim starring in the verismo twins. Cura sang his first Calaf in Verona in 2003; nearly six years later, he brought his dangerous and controversial prince to Covent Garden.

Cura continued the 2008/2009 season with symphonic concerts in Bologna, and Budapest, &quot;Stiffelio&quot;, &quot;Carmen&quot;, and &quot;Tosca&quot; in Vienna, &quot;Cavalleria Rusticana&quot; and &quot;Pagliacci&quot; at the Met in New York, and &quot;Turandot&quot;, &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot; and &quot;Pagliacci&quot; in Zurich.

===2010–present===
Cura continues to tour concert halls and opera houses around the world, performing his signature roles of Otello, Samson, Canio, Turiddu, Don José, Stiffelio, Cavaradossi, Dick Johnson, Calaf, Edgar etc. – debuting in &quot;La Bohème&quot; as Rodolfo at the Zurich Opera House in 2010.

He took his &quot;Otello&quot; to the Met in 2013, not before saving the last performance of &quot;Carmen&quot; at the same opera house, a favour which he had been asked to do the very moment he landed in New York, jet-lagged, from Europe. Without rehearsals and very little sleep, Cura performed the role of Don José.

His performance of Otello at the Salzburg Easter festival in 2016 was in the opinion Giacomo Parini of the Milano Gazzetto to be &quot;one of the most vulgar performances of Otello in memory. Verdi and all proponents of beautiful singing are rolling in their graves.&quot;

===Career as conductor===
Originally trained as an orchestral conductor, his vocal talents were unrecognised until 1988.

He became the first artist to sing and conduct simultaneously (both in concert and on recordings) and the first to combine singing with symphonic works in a ‘half and half’ concert format.

Cura made operatic history when he first conducted &quot;Cavalleria Rusticana&quot; and then stepped on stage after intermission to sing Canio in &quot;Pagliacci&quot; at the Hamburg State Opera in February 2003.

He accepted a three-year assignment as principal guest conductor of Sinfonia Varsovia, a position previously held by the late Lord Yehudi Menuhin, in early 2001. Cura inaugurated his partnership with a concert in Warsaw in November.

Cura subsequently led his orchestra in a series of highly acclaimed performances of such symphonic works as Respighi&#x27;s &quot;Pines of Rome&quot;, Rachmaninov&#x27;s Second Symphony and Beethoven&#x27;s Choral Symphony No. 9. His recordings of Rachmaninov&#x27;s Symphony No. 2 and &quot;Aurora&quot;, a collection of opera arias, feature Cura conducting the Polish ensemble. A favorite guest conductor of orchestras across Europe, he conducted a New Year&#x27;s concert in Budapest to bring the year to a close.
As a concert performer, José Cura has successfully integrated the roles of singer and conductor as demonstrated in his performance in the Vienna Konzerthaus in November 2002, seamlessly moving from singing arias from his new album, &quot;Aurora&quot;, to conducting the Rachmaninov Symphony No. 2.

On 18 September he conducted Sinfonia Varsovia in Beethoven&#x27;s monumental 5th Symphony as part of the VI European Festival in Jelenia Góra. Cura next traveled to Sofia to conduct the Bulgaria Philharmonic Orchestra on 28 September in an evening of music that included Respighi&#x27;s &quot;Pini di Roma&quot;, Borodin&#x27;s &quot;Polovtsian Dances&quot; and Tchaikovsky&#x27;s 5th Symphony.

In October 2003, he returned to Prague for a standing-room-only concert featuring an inspired selection of Puccini arias coupled with the 9th Symphony from the Czech Republic&#x27;s most famous composer, Antonín Dvořák. Cura&#x27;s final public concert of the year was in Budapest, during which the maestro led the Matàv Hungarian Symphony Orchestra in a rendition of Dvořák&#x27;s 9th-recorded live and released by Cura&#x27;s Cuibar label.

In April 2004, Cura conducted &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; in Warsaw.

Maestro Cura also proved his versatility on the podium throughout the year 2006. In June, Cura returned to his roots to conduct two sacred works at the Miskolci Opera Fesztival in Hungary. The program, which opened with the somber beauty of Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Stabat Mater&quot;, was highlighted by the conductor&#x27;s interpretation of Zoltán Kodály&#x27;s &quot;Te Deum&quot;. In September, Cura traveled to Plymouth, England, to conduct the Ten Tors orchestra in a Gala Opera Concert. The Maestro led his ensemble in numbers from Rossini (&quot;William Tell Overture&quot;), Tchaikovsky (&quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;), Gershwin (selections from &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;), Verdi (&quot;I vespri Siciliani&quot; overture), and Dvořák (Hymn to the Moon from &quot;Rusalka&quot; and the final movement from Symphony No. 9).

Cura traveled to Italy in December for a month-long immersion in conducting, interrupted only when he raised his voice in support of charity during the annual Muscular Dystrophy Telethon. Concerts with the L&#x27;orchestra della Fondazione Arturo Toscanini in Busseto and Piacenza featured Rachmaninov&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 2 in C minor and Symphony No. 2 in E minor and Kodály&#x27;s &quot;Dances of Galanta&quot;. The Maestro ended the month in Mantova conducting Verdi&#x27;s &quot;I vespri Siciliani&quot;.

===Directing and scenography===
José Cura directed and designed the sets of &quot;La Commedia è finita&quot; in 2007.

In May 2008, he produced &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot; for the Köln Staatstheater.

He later followed suit in his production of &quot;Samson et Dalila&quot; at the Badisches Staatstheater in 2010 (in which he also designed the costumes) as well as &quot;La Rondine&quot; at the Opéra national de Lorraine and &quot;Cavalleria Rusticana and Pagliacci&quot; at the Opéra Royal de Wallonie, both in 2012.

In 2012, he was the first artist to have designed the scenography and costumes as well as directing and conducting an opera. This was &quot;La Rondine&quot;, at the Opéra de Lorraine, in Nancy, France.

===Photography===
In 2008, he published his first photography book &quot;Espontáneas&quot; () followed by an exhibition at the Tuscan Sun Festival in Cortona, Italy.

==Principal recordings==
Cura&#x27;s discography and filmography covers his main repertoire as well as many concert performances and conducting works.

In 2002 he created Cuibar Phono Video (CPV). The same year, CPV released Rachmaninoff’s Symphony No. 2 with Sinfonia Varsovia, which Cura conducted. He continues to release his works through his company at present.

He has given many masterclasses and taught at different institutions throughout the years. Most notably, for Nancy Opéra Passion, which focuses on launching new young talents onto the international stage.

==Charity work==
Cura hosted the annual Muscular Dystrophy Telethon in Italy in 2005.

In August 2007, he was awarded the Socio Fundador Honorario by the Associacao Portuguesa contra a Leucemia (APCL) for his on-going support of the association in its efforts to find a cure for Leukemia.

Since 2008, he has been collaborating the Salva Vita Foundation in Hungary.

<text>William Lawrence Mitchell (March 1, 1928 – January 5, 2010) was an American trumpeter, bandleader, soul, R&amp;B, rock and roll, pop and funk record producer and arranger who ran Royal Studios in Memphis, Tennessee. He was best known for his Hi Records label of the 1970s, which released albums by a large stable of popular Memphis soul artists, including Mitchell himself, Al Green, O. V. Wright, Syl Johnson, Ann Peebles and Quiet Elegance.

==Biography==
Born and raised in Ashland, Mississippi, Mitchell moved to Memphis when he was in high school. He attended Rust College. At the age of eight, he began to play the trumpet. While in high school, he was a featured player in popular local big bands. He later formed his own combo, which from time to time included musicians such as trumpeter Booker Little, saxophonists Charles Lloyd, and George Coleman, and pianist Phineas Newborn, Jr.

Mitchell landed a job with the Home of the Blues record label as a producer, then left to join Hi Records as both a recording artist and a producer.

Known at the recording studio as &quot;Papa Willie&quot;, Mitchell earned his nickname by taking over the reins of Hi Records in 1970 and guiding it through its most successful period. Mitchell&#x27;s productions have been much noted for featuring a hard-hitting bass drum sound (usually played by pioneering Memphis drummer Al Jackson, Jr. of Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s).

A trumpeter and bandleader in his own right, Mitchell released a number of popular singles for Hi Records as an artist in the 1960s, including &quot;Soul Serenade.&quot; It peaked at number 43 in the UK Singles Chart in April 1968.

Through the 1980s, Mitchell ran his own independent record label, Waylo Records. Acts on the label included Billy Always and Lynn White.

In 1987, Joyce Cobb recorded several singles for Waylo, one of which made it to No. 3 on the British R&amp;B chart: &quot;Another Lonely Night (Without You)&quot;, while in 1987, Mitchell worked on a version of Wet Wet Wet&#x27;s debut album, which was issued in 1988 as &quot;The Memphis Sessions&quot;.

He and Al Green revived their successful recording partnership in 2003 when Green recorded &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stop&quot;, his first collaboration with Mitchell since 1985&#x27;s &quot;He is the Light&quot;. Their 2005 follow-up project was &quot;Everything&#x27;s OK&quot;.

Mitchell died in Memphis on January 5, 2010, from a cardiac arrest.

His final work was producing the final Solomon Burke studio album, &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Impossible&quot;, released in June 2010.

<text>Paul Aussaresses (; 7 November 1918 – 3 December 2013) was a French Army general, who fought during World War II, the First Indochina War and Algerian War. His actions during the Algerian War—and later defense of those actions—caused considerable controversy.

Aussaresses joined the Free French Forces in North Africa during the Second World War. In 1947 he was given command of the 11th Shock Battalion, a commando unit that was part of France&#x27;s former external intelligence agency, the External Documentation and Counter-Espionage Service, the SDECE (replaced by the Direction Générale de la Sécurité Extérieure (DGSE)).

Aussaresses provoked controversy in 2000 when, in an interview with the French newspaper &quot;Le Monde&quot;, he admitted and defended the use of torture during the Algerian war. He repeated the defense in an interview with CBS&#x27;s &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, further arguing that torture ought to be used in the fight against Al-Qaeda, and again defended his use of torture during the Algerian War in a 2001 book; &quot;The Battle of the Casbah&quot;. In the aftermath of the controversy, he was stripped of his rank, the right to wear his army uniform and his Légion d&#x27;Honneur. A 2003 documentary revealed that, after moving to Brazil in 1973, Aussaresses had advised South American dictators on the use of torture widely used against leftist opponents to the military regimes in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Aussaresses also admitted to advising the CIA for the Americans&#x27; Vietnam era Phoenix Program, which utilized torture.

Aussaresses, recognizable by his eye patch, lost his left eye due to a botched cataract operation.

==Biography==

===Early life and military career===
Aussaresses was born on 7 November 1918, just four days before the end of World War I, in Saint-Paul-Cap-de-Joux, Tarn department, in Languedoc. His father, Paul Aussaresses senior, was serving in the French military at the time of his son&#x27;s birth because of the war.

In 1941, Aussaresses served a year as an officer cadet in Cherchell, Algeria. The next year, in 1942, he volunteered for the special services unit in France. He a member of a Jedburgh team and member of Team CHRYSLER which parachuted into France behind the German lines in August 1944. The Jedburghs worked clandestinely behind enemy lines to harness the local resistance and coordinate their activities with the wishes of the Allied Commanders. CHRYSLER deployed from Algeria via an American aircraft to work with the local French Resistance in Ariège. On 1 September 1946 he joined the 11th Choc Battalion and commanded the battalion from 1947 until 1948, when he was replaced by Yves Godard. Later, he served in the First Indochina War with the 1st Parachute Chasseur Regiment.

===Philippeville===

In 1955 he was transferred to Philippeville, Algeria to be part of the 41st Parachute Demi-Brigade as an intelligence officer. He restarted his demi-brigade&#x27;s intelligence unit, which had been disbanded during peacetime but was deemed necessary by the French Army, which wanted to quell the insurgency of the Algerian rebels. On 20 August 1955 the FLN (Algerian National Liberation Front) staged an attack against the police of Philippeville. Aussaresses states that he had information about this attack well beforehand and was therefore able to prevent much bloodshed. The members of the FLN had forced many of the men, women and children of the countryside to march in front of them, without weapons, as human shields. Aussaresses reports that his battalion killed 134 of these men, women and children, and that hundreds more had been wounded. He reports that two men from his own side also died, and that around one hundred others had been wounded. (Aussaresses, p. 41)

===The Suez Operation===
In the spring of 1956, he attended a top-secret training camp in Salisbury, England for a one-month training to prepare for the battle at Suez Canal. He returned to Bône, Algeria in May 1956 to continue exercises with paratroopers on their way to the Suez Canal. On 1 June 1956 he received a spinal fracture from a parachuting exercise, which prevented him from participating in the Suez operation.

===Working with Massu in Algiers===
General Jacques Massu, who had noted Aussaresses&#x27; work against the insurrections in Philippeville, ordered Aussaresses to work under him in Algiers as an agent to control the FLN in Algiers. Aussaresses reported for duty in Algiers on 8 January 1957. He was the main executioner and intelligence collector under Jacques Massu during the Battle of Algiers. On 28 January, he broke a citywide strike organized by the FLN using repressive measures. Soldiers forcibly dragged all public utilities workers to their jobs. Store fronts were torn open so that the owners had to open the store for fear of being looted. Later in 1957, he ordered his men to hang Larbi Ben M&#x27;Hidi, an important member of the FLN, as if he had committed suicide. In a separate incident he ordered that an officer throw Ali Boumendjel, an influential Algerian attorney, from the 6th floor of the building he was held prisoner in, claiming that Boumendjel had committed suicide. France decreed that both deaths were suicides, but Aussaresses admitted both assassinations in 2000.

===Status of torture in the French government===
Aussaresses contends, in his book, that the French government insisted that the military in Algeria &quot;liquidate the FLN as quickly as possible&quot;.

Subsequently, historians debated whether or not this repression was government-backed or not. The French government has always claimed that it was not, but Aussaresses argues that the government insisted upon the harsh measures he took against Algerians - measures which included summary executions of many people, hours of torture of prisoners, and violent strike-breaking.

Aussaresses was quite candid in his interview in &quot;Le Monde&quot; forty years later (May 3, 2001):

Concerning the use of torture, it was tolerated, if not recommended. François Mitterrand, the Minister for Justice, had, indeed, an emissary with Massu in judge Jean Bérard, who covered for us and who had complete knowledge of what went on in the night.

Aussaresses justified the use of torture by saying how shocked he was by the FLN&#x27;s massacre at the El Halia mine. He suggested that torture was a small but necessary evil that had to be used to defeat a much larger evil of terrorism. Aussaresses also claimed that he used these methods because it was a quick way to obtain information. He also defended its use by saying that the legal system was meant to deal with a peacetime France, not a counter insurgency war that the French army was faced with in Algeria. In 2001, Aussaresses during an interview stated:

The FLN were involved in a savage terrorist movement. My role in Algeria was a struggle against unbridled terrorism — blind attacks against the innocent. The conflict was not Algerians vs. French. The fight was not a political one nor was it an ideological one. That holds no interest for me. Most Algerians, as well, were not interested in political problems. They only wanted to be able to go out on the streets and live in peace. I, who judge no one … often ask, considering what happens in a city today — with those blind attacks which decimate the innocent — why someone does not understand within a few weeks that the high authorities must utilize all means in order to put an end to the terror?...I am a patriot. I take full responsibility for my actions. I do not seek to justify my actions but simply try to explain that from the moment when a nation demands of its army to fight an enemy that terrorizes the population and forces it into submission, it is impossible for the army not to resort to extreme means...In the interest of my country I had clandestinely carried out operations unacceptable to the ordinary moral standards, had often circumvented the law: stolen, assassinated, vandalized, and terrorized. I had learned how to pick locks, kill without leaving traces, lie, be indifferent to my suffering and to that of others, had forgotten and made others forget. All for France.

In an interview to Marie-Monique Robin, Aussaresses described the methods used, including the creation of death squads (&quot;escadrons de la mort&quot;), the term being created at this time.

===Trial===

Following Aussaresses&#x27; revelations, which suggested that torture had been ordered by the highest levels of the French state hierarchy, Human Rights Watch sent a letter to President Jacques Chirac (RPR) to indict Aussaresses for war crimes, declaring that, despite past amnesties, such crimes, which may also have been crimes against humanity, may not be amnestied. The Ligue des droits de l&#x27;homme (LDH, Human Rights League) filed a complaint against him for &quot;apology of war crimes,&quot; as Paul Aussaresses justified the use of torture, claiming it had saved lives following the Necessity Defense [AKA: Choice of Evils] and/or the Self-Defense (although he did not explicitly use this expression). He was condemned to a 7,500 Euros fine by the Tribunal de grande instance de Paris, while Plon and Perrin, two editing houses who had published his book in which he defended the use of torture, were sentenced each to a 15,000 Euros fine. The judgement was confirmed by the Court of Appeal in April 2003. The Court of Cassation rejected the intercession in December 2004. The Court of Cassation declared in its judgment that &quot;freedom to inform, which is the basis of freedom of expression&quot; does not lead to &quot;accompany the exposure of facts ... with commentaries justifying acts contrary to human dignity and universally reproved,&quot; &quot;nor to glorify its author.&quot; Aussaresses had written in his book: &quot;torture became necessary when emergency imposed itself.&quot;

===After Algeria===
Aussaresses had a successful military career after the war. Unlike many of his fellow officers, he did not choose to join the OAS militant group to continue the fight in Algeria after the French military began to withdraw their forces. In 1961 he was appointed as a military attaché of the French diplomatic mission in the USA, along with ten veterans of the Algerian War formerly under his charge. In the USA, he also served at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, USA, alongside the 10th Special Forces Group, a military unit that specialized in tactics of unconventional warfare. There he taught the lessons of the Battle of Algiers, which allegedly included counter-insurgency tactics, interrogation, and torture.

According to Aussauresses, he specifically taught lessons from Colonel Trinquier&#x27;s book on &quot;subversive warfare&quot; (Aussaresses had served under Trinquier in Algeria). The Americans&#x27; Vietnam era Phoenix Program, which utilized torture (including electric torture, simulated drowning, and rape) against those suspected of Viet Cong membership, was inspired by these American students of Aussaresses, after they had sent a copy of Trinquier&#x27;s book to CIA agent Robert Komer. U.S. Army Colonel Carl Bernard later recalled that &quot;starting with that book [&quot;Modern Warfare&quot;] Project Phoenix was conceived&quot;. However, Robert L. Miller, in a foreword to Aussaresses&#x27; later book, has stated that American officers actually rejected Aussaresses&#x27; instructions that torture and summary execution were useful in defeating insurgencies.

Aussaresses located to Brazil in 1973 during the military dictatorship, where he maintained very close links with the military. According to General Manuel Contreras, former head of the Chilean DINA, Chilean officers trained in Brazil under Aussaresses&#x27; orders and advised the South American juntas on counter-insurrection warfare and the use of torture that was widely used against leftist opponents to the military regimes in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay.

==Popular culture==
The character of Julien Boisfeuras in the novels &quot;The Centurions&quot; and &quot;The Praetorians&quot; by Jean Larteguy was according to Larteguy not based on anyone, but many believe that he was at least partially inspired by Aussaresses and Roger Trinquier.

An inmate in the asylum for &#x27;noble executioners&#x27; in the Jens Bjørneboe novel Powderhouse shares the same biography as Aussaresses; he is described as having served in Algiers and later teaching his methods to South American death squads.

<text>Strat-O-Matic is a game company based in Glen Head, New York, that develops and publishes sports simulation games. It produces tabletop baseball, American football, basketball, and ice hockey simulations, as well as personal computer adaptations of each, but it is primarily known for its baseball game.

==History==
Strat-O-Matic began as a company in 1961, when Hal Richman, a Bucknell University mathematics student, began selling an early version of his baseball tabletop game out of his basement, buying advertising space in &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; to aid sales. Richman lost money until 1963, when his decision to release a game containing one card for each player in Major League Baseball resulted in greatly increased sales. Richman later released a football game in 1968, an &quot;advanced&quot; baseball game in 1972, a basketball game in 1973, and a hockey game in 1978.

Strat-O-Matic&#x27;s statistical research and game development methods are implemented with the intent of replicating athletes&#x27; abilities as accurately as possible, giving the gamer the feel of making managerial decisions.

In February 2011, Strat-O-Matic celebrated its 50th anniversary with an opening day event at the Community Church of New York. This was a change from the normal opening day festivities of fans lining up outside the company&#x27;s headquarters in Glen Head to pick up their new baseball products. At this event, over 500 people attended and heard from panelists including Doug Glanville, Rick Peterson and STATS, Inc. founder John Dewan.

In March 2011, Richman was inducted into the National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame.

==How it works==
In a Strat-O-Matic game, each athlete is represented by a player card, on which are printed various ratings and result tables for dice rolls. A player, who may play solitaire or against another player, is in charge of making strategic and personnel decisions for their team, while determining the results of in game decisions by cross-referencing dice rolls with a system of printed charts and tables.
The basic scheme may be understood in connection with the adjoining images, representing the baseball game. One die selects which column is used on either the batter or the pitcher card, while the other two dice specify the outcome within the column.

The results on the player cards are determined by a combination of the respective athlete&#x27;s real-life statistics for the previous year and (mostly in the case of the baseball game) independent research of news articles and scouting reports. All Strat-O-Matic games offer a &quot;basic&quot;, &quot;advanced&quot;, and &quot;super-advanced&quot; version; the more advanced versions give more strategic options to players while taking into account additional nuances of an athlete&#x27;s abilities (e.g., in baseball, differences in hitting vs. left-handed or right-handed pitchers). The computer adaptations essentially rely on the same algorithms as the tabletop games, but they have the additional advantages of faster play and statistics compilation.

When the new Strat-O-Matic baseball cards are released each year in late January or early February -- an event that hundreds of players commemorate by showing up in the cold at the company&#x27;s headquarters—controversy soon follows over the deservedness of such statistics.
Additionally, there also is an Internet version of the Strat-O-Matic Baseball game. This was formerly hosted by &quot;The Sporting News&quot;, and is now hosted by the Strat-O-Matic Company.

==Influence==

Strat-O-Matic games have been played by a wide variety of sports fans, including professional athletes themselves. Former major leaguer Doug Glanville is an avid Strat-O-Matic player and advocate of the company, and his ex-teammate and noted gamer Curt Schilling also plays. Former New York Mets teammates Keith Hernandez and Lenny Dykstra also have proclaimed their devotion. After homering in the ninth inning of Game 3 of the 1986 National League Championship Series, Dykstra said that the last time he had done such a thing was when he played Strat-O-Matic against his brother.

Broadcaster Bob Costas often played Strat-O-Matic in his youth, and credits the game with teaching him about baseball, for instance the importance of on-base percentage and slugging percentage. Author Buzz Bissinger says that &quot;Strat-O-Matic changed my life.&quot;

The EMSBL (East Meadow Strat-O-Matic Baseball League), founded in 1972, is believed to be the oldest continuously playing fantasy sports league in the world. The league&#x27;s 2022 season marked the league&#x27;s 51st consecutive year of play. Based in East Meadow, N.Y., the league was founded by its first commissioner, Jim Drucker, who later became the commissioner of the Continental Basketball Association (1978–86) and Arena Football League (1994–96). 

Games of Strat-O-Matic were shown being played in the Spike Lee film &quot;Crooklyn&quot;.

Computer sports game designers and producers such as Trip Hawkins and Richard Hilleman have been lifelong Strat-O-Matic players, indirectly influencing the development of rival computer baseball simulation games. In the book &quot;Magic the Gathering: The Pocket Players&#x27; Guide&quot;, it was mentioned that Strat-O-Matic was a strong influence in the game design work of Richard Garfield.

<doc id="1174827" wikidata="Q117048" url="?curid=1174827" title="Kaleidoscope (Kelis album)">
<text>Kaleidoscope is the debut studio album by American singer Kelis. It was released on December 7, 1999, by Virgin Records, and was produced entirely by the Neptunes. Despite underperforming in the United States, the album saw mild success in certain international markets, including the United Kingdom, where it charted at number 43 and was certified gold.

&quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; was reissued on February 21, 2020, in celebration of its 20th anniversary. The extended digital release features edits and club remixes, including a Neptunes extended remix of &quot;Caught Out There&quot;. The physical edition was pressed to translucent orange vinyl and was released in a two-set on March 6, 2020.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; received widespread acclaim from music critics. AllMusic editor Jaime Sunao Ikeda remarked that the album &quot;showcases the development of a great talent [...] It&#x27;s when Kelis and her production team create tracks that best fit her voice and uniqueness that the end results are outstanding. Although comparisons to Neneh Cherry are inevitable, she does carve out a niche for herself, armed with undeniable talent.&quot; &quot;Music Week&quot; gave the album a positive review saying that it was, &quot;A strong debut from one of the brightest female faces to appear on the R&amp;B scene in recent years&quot;; overall, they felt it would be unfair to just concentrate on Caught out there, &quot;as the whole album displays talent&quot;. &quot;NME&quot; called &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; a &quot;futuristic, visionary, multi-layered work of R&amp;B, funk, soul and rap, furnished with an inspirational, psychedelic spirituality, rarely seen but desperately needed in these cynical times&quot; and concluded: &quot;Uplifting, magical, genre-bending music, if there’s a better debut album this year, bring it on. We need more like this.&quot; &quot;Q&quot;″s Kerry Potter described &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; as &quot;an album that packs punches of the Mike Tyson variety and oozes confidence from every beat [...] &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; isn&#x27;t just a promising debut, it&#x27;s an inspired one.&quot;

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Britt Robson found that the album &quot;fleshes out her persona with petulant sass and roller-rink whimsy, pegging her romantic maturity halfway between Brandy and Mary J. But what lingers are the minimalist staccato beats from production duo the Neptunes.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Arion Berger wrote that &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; was &quot;too musically adventurous and emotionally ambivalent to employ any one attitude. Plumbing retro styles is the easy resort of the hip-hop eclecticist, but somehow Kelis&#x27; background in jazz, gospel, rock and R&amp;B; brings a deeply felt sonic futurism to her debut album [...] The Neptunes makes this interplanetary power-girl mix sound both danceably down-to-earth and shockingly new.&quot; In 2020, the magazine ranked the album at number 391 on their updated list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;.

==Commercial performance and singles==
&quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; peaked at number 144 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and as of November 2006, it had sold 249,000 copies in the United States. The album fared better in Europe, where all three singles—&quot;Caught Out There&quot;, &quot;Good Stuff&quot;, and &quot;Get Along with You&quot;—attained moderate commercial success. &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; reached number 43 on the UK Albums Chart and was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). By October 2004, the album had sold 167,000 copies in the United Kingdom.

After reaching number 52 on the UK Singles Chart on imports alone, &quot;Caught Out There&quot; was given a proper release in the UK, eventually peaking at number four. &quot;Good Stuff&quot; also proved a modest success, reaching number 19 on the UK chart. The third and final single from the album, &quot;Get Along with You&quot;, was her first solo release to miss the top 40, reaching number 51.

In an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot; in January 2020, Kelis stated that she never earned any money from sales of her first two albums, adding that she was &quot;blatantly lied to and tricked&quot; by the production team with whom she had signed, at the age of 19.

<doc id="1174834" wikidata="Q536184" url="?curid=1174834" title="Barry Melton">
<text>Barry &quot;The Fish&quot; Melton (born June 14, 1947) is the co-founder and original lead guitarist of Country Joe and the Fish and Dinosaurs. He appears on all the Country Joe and the Fish recordings and he also wrote some of the songs that the band recorded. He appeared in the films made at Monterey Pop and Woodstock, and also appeared as an outlaw in the neo-Western film &quot;Zachariah&quot; and other films in which Country Joe and the Fish appear. An attorney and member of the State Bar of California, Melton has maintained a criminal defense practice since 1982.

==Life and career==
Melton was born in Brooklyn, New York, United States, the son of secretary Taube &quot;Tillie&quot; ( Kuchuck) and James Melton, an HVAC engineer who taught at Los Angeles City College. His mother was from an East Coast Jewish family (her parents were from Odessa) and his father was from a Texas pioneer family and shares ancestry in colonial Virginia with George Washington, as well as deep roots in Ireland.

Raised in Brooklyn&#x27;s Brighton Beach neighborhood and the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles, California, Melton served as a Congress of Racial Equality volunteer during Freedom Summer and participated in a demonstration against Trần Lệ Xuân during her September–October 1963 lecture tour of Europe and the United States. Having previously studied under Kay Kyser guitarist Milton Norman for much of his youth at the instigation of his parents, Melton initially befriended future bandmate Bruce Barthol in his high school&#x27;s folk music club. After ascending to the presidency of that organization, Melton became ensconced in the American folk music revival in earnest, playing at such venues as the Ash Grove. A summer 1964 hitchhiking excursion to the San Francisco Bay Area and his hometown of New York City yielded his first introduction to Joe McDonald at a Malvina Reynolds concert in the Bay Area.

Upon graduating early from Ulysses S. Grant High School in January 1965, Melton enrolled at San Francisco State University after becoming a devotee of faculty member S. I. Hayakawa&#x27;s writings on general semantics. Dissuaded by the fact that Hayakawa only taught upper-division courses and &quot;lured away by the music&quot;, he dropped out after ten weeks, reuniting with McDonald in nearby Berkeley, California; paralleling the development of such contemporaneous groups as the Grateful Dead, various duo and jug band-oriented permutations of their act (centered on the Jabberwock, a Berkeley coffeehouse) would ultimately evolve into Country Joe and the Fish by early 1966.

With a desire to eschew the rigors of a touring lifestyle, while maintaining his countercultural values following the birth of his first son in 1977, he enrolled in the law program at La Salle Extension University, a now-defunct correspondence law school. After earning his Juris Doctor from Ocean University (a similar institution) and passing the California bar exam in 1982, Melton maintained a private criminal defense practice in San Francisco for twelve years before becoming a deputy public defender in Mendocino County, California, in 1994. Following a brief tenure as a California deputy state public defender from 1998 to 1999, he took a position with Yolo County, California, eventually retiring in 2009 as the county&#x27;s chief public defender. Since then, he has resumed private practice and worked as a subcontractor for Lake Defense, the contract provider of indigent defense services in Lake County, California. He is certified as a specialist in criminal law by the State Bar of California Board of Legal Specialization.

Melton also continues to be active in music. Since 2001, he has performed in Italy, England, France, Thailand and Russia (including a performance with the Russian band Crossroadz in Moscow). He often appears with his own band, mainly around northern California, and generally tours Europe briefly in the summer. Peter Albin of Big Brother and the Holding Company has continued to play with Melton for over 40 years.

<text>Hi Records is an American soul music and rhythm &amp; blues label founded in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1957 by singer Ray Harris, record store owner Joe Cuoghi, Bill Cantrell and Quinton Claunch (formerly producers for Sun Records), and three silent partners, including Cuoghi&#x27;s lawyer, Nick Pesce.

== History ==
Hi Records&#x27; first big hit was &quot;Smokie Part 2&quot;, an instrumental by Bill Black&#x27;s Combo, released in 1959. Black was a bass player with Elvis Presley and a long-time friend of Ray Harris. Founder Claunch was forced out of the label, selling his share in 1960 to Carl McVoy (a cousin of Jerry Lee Lewis), who had been involved with the label since its first recording and had worked with Bill Black. Willie Mitchell joined the label that year as a recording artist. In 1968 he began to produce Al Green. Bill Black&#x27;s saxophonist, Ace Cannon, landed a hit with the single &quot;Tuff&quot; in 1961.

In 1970, when founder Joe Cuoghi died and Ray Harris retired, Nick Pesce became president; Willie Mitchell became vice-president. Hi Records&#x27; commercial peak was in the early 1970s, mainly due to the innovative and highly successful work of Al Green, whose hits on the label included &quot;Tired of Being Alone&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Stay Together&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Still in Love with You&quot;, and &quot;Call Me&quot;. Other artists on the label included O. V. Wright, Don Bryant, Otis Clay, and Ann Peebles. None reached the same level of success.

The label&#x27;s music was mostly recorded at Willie Mitchell&#x27;s Royal Studios, located in a renovated movie theater in South Memphis. The label was distributed nationally by London Records. On its numerous hit recordings of the 1970s, the label used a house backing band of local session musicians known as the Hi Rhythm Section. The popularity of disco music in the late 1970s led to a decline in the popularity of southern soul music.

Licensed distribution is by Crimson Productions (a division of Demon Music Group) in Europe; EMI licensed the catalog in Canada and the United States until 2009, when Fat Possum Records began distributing for the United States, Canada and Australia. Before EMI, Motown Records distributed Hi&#x27;s back catalog from the 1980s to the mid-1990s, consisting mostly Green&#x27;s and Mitchell&#x27;s albums.

The Royal Recording Studios, also Hi Recording Studio, was located at an old movie theatre, at 1320 South Lauderdale Street, founded by the owners of Hi Records; several hit singles were recorded here.

<doc id="1174837" wikidata="Q952107" url="?curid=1174837" title="Władysław Raginis">
<text>Władysław Raginis (June 27, 1908 – September 10, 1939) was a Polish military commander during the Invasion of Poland in 1939 of a small force holding the Polish fortified defense positions against a vastly larger German force during the Battle of Wizna. Because the positions were held at great cost for three days before being annihilated with few survivors, Wizna is referred to as the Polish Thermopylae and Captain Raginis as a modern Leonidas.

==Background==
Raginis was born in Zariņi (&quot;Zariny&quot;) village near to Dźwińsk (Daugavpils), Courland Governorate, Russian Empire (present-day Latvia) to a landowning family with patriotic traditions. Soon after graduating from a gymnasium in 1927, he joined the Infantry NCO School in Komorowo near Ostrów Mazowiecka where he was a mediocre student and completed his studies in 1928. He then completed a short practice of the military and the same year he enrolled at the Infantry Officers School in Ostrów Mazowiecka. One of his schoolmates recalled: &quot;He had a borderland accent, and was quiet and shy. Slim, small, blond hair ... &quot; After graduating on July 15, 1930, he was assigned to the 76th Infantry Regiment stationed in Grodno, where he was a platoon commander and instructor-lecturer at the School Cadet Corps. In 1939, as a distinction, he was advanced to lieutenant and then to captain and assigned to the elite Border Defence Corps (KOP) as the commander of the 3rd company, heavy machine gun battalion, of the Border Defence Corps Regiment &quot;Sarny&quot; under the command of Lt-Colonel Nikodem Sulik.

In the late summer of 1939, the &quot;Sarny&quot; Regiment sent the bulk of its forces to Upper Silesia to man the Fortified Area Silesia, some units, including Raginis, instead went to Osowiec Fortress, near the border with East Prussia.
In anticipation of the outbreak of the Second World War, on September 2, 1939, Major Jakub Fober gave Raginis command of all the Wizna Fortified Area, a buffer of between the Narew River and Biebrza River, which was part of defensive line of Independent Operational Group &quot;Narew&quot; on the right wing of Polish forces. &quot;Wizna&quot; secured a major artery of communication, the Łomża – Białystok road and the Zambrów – Osowiec railway.

It is worth noting that some of the shelters were incomplete as war broke out, some had little to no ventilation, many of them not camouflaged and some were not fitted with armored observation domes. The incomplete state of the shelters significantly reduced the combat capability of the emplacements.
== The battle of Wizna ==
On September 7, Raginis&#x27; forces (approximately 720 men, out of which roughly 650 were killed) were attacked by more than 42,000 German soldiers. To keep the morale of his men high, Raginis pledged that he would not leave his post alive.

The defense of Wizna against overwhelming odds lasted for three days. On September 10, 1939, the bunker commanded by Raginis was the last remaining pocket of resistance. Although heavily wounded, Raginis was still commanding his troops. At noon on the third day, the German commander, Heinz Guderian, threatened that all Polish POWs would be shot if the defense of the bunker did not cease. Turning to his men in the shelter, Raginis thanked them for their bravery, and for doing their duty. He then ordered them to surrender and leave the shelter - he would keep his word and not surrender. Seweryn Biegański, who was the last to leave the shelter, describes the moment; 
&quot;&quot;The captain looked at me warmly and softly urged me to leave. When I was at the exit, I was hit on my back with strong gust and I heard an explosion.&quot;&quot;

Raginis decided to end the resistance and died by suicide by throwing himself on a grenade.

In his diaries, Guderian noted that 900 German soldiers were killed in action, although that number is probably a low estimate. It is certain, however, that the Wehrmacht lost at least 10 tanks and several other AFVs in the struggle.
The defense of Wizna, despite the clear imbalance of forces, of which the defenders were aware, was significant. It had pinned down the German forces for two days, allowing the remnants of Polish troops in western Poland to defend the capital, Warsaw. It helped gain time for many Polish units and the government leadership to conduct an orderly withdrawal to the Romanian bridgehead ().

The Germans agreed to allow burial of the corpses of Raginis and Lieutenant Stanisław Brykalski by Kazimierz Puchowicz, a friend of Raginis, next to the bunker where a tree was planted as an impromptu memorial. When the Red Army entered Wizna, the Soviet authorities ordered the bodies to be dug up and moved next to the Łomża - Białystok road, where an obelisk stands today. His symbolic grave is located next to the ruins of the bunker in which he died.

The inscription on the monument tablet says; 
Przechodniu, powiedz Ojczyźnie, żeśmy walczyli do końca, spełniając swój obowiązek which translates into English as: Passerby, tell the Fatherland that we fought to the end, fulfilling our duty

(In the style of the epitaph for the soldiers at Thermopylae). The family of Raginis was officially notified of his death in Wizna three years later in 1943 when his sister, Maria Morawska, received a notice through the Red Cross.
==Posthumous honors==
The local primary school is named after him, as well as several streets in Poland, including one in Białystok, Rzeszów and Warsaw,

The 31st Council of the Polish Scouting Association in Białystok, chose Raginis as their patron in 1969.

On May 13, 1970, Raginis was posthumously awarded, by the Council of State of the Polish People&#x27;s Republic, with the Virtuti Militari - Gold Cross (IV Class) medal.

On August 28, 2009 he was posthumously awarded, by the President of Poland, with the Order of Polonia Restituta (Grand Cross).

On August 21, 2012 Raginis was posthumously promoted, by the Minister of National Defence Tomasz Siemoniak to the rank of Major.

== Cultural references ==

The heroic struggle and death of Raginis has inspired a number of films and videos:
* Film documentary titled &quot;Wierność&quot; (1969) written and directed by Grzegorz Królikiewicz.
* Film documentary titled &quot;Dzwony znad Wizny&quot; (1969) directed by Franciszek Burdzy
* Television documentary series episode from TVP titled &quot;Było... nie minęło&quot; first broadcast on September 25, 2010.
* The image of Raginis is included on a stamp in the series &quot;Polish Defense War of 1939&quot; issued by Poczta Polska in 1989 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the invasion of Poland and the outbreak of World War II.
* The Swedish power metal band Sabaton wrote the song &quot;40:1&quot; about the battle of Wizna, extolling the performance of the Polish defenders. Before their concert in Poland, on October 23, 2008 the members of Sabaton visited Wizna to pay their respects to the soldiers and Raginis.

<text>Kathy Cox (born August 10, 1964) is a former superintendent of public schools for the U.S. state of Georgia, and is a Republican. A high school teacher by occupation, Cox also served two terms, from 1998 to 2002, in the Georgia House of Representatives, representing Peachtree City, Georgia, prior to her election as superintendent in 2002. Cox sought re-election in 2006, defeating Democratic challenger Denise Majette (a former U.S. representative), earning almost 60 percent of the vote.

Cox is not related to Cathy Cox, a Democrat who was Georgia&#x27;s elected secretary of state from 1999 until 2007. The similarity in names became the subject of mostly humorous news stories in 2002, when Kathy Cox&#x27;s defeated opponent, Barbara Christmas, complained that she had lost because of voter confusion between the two Coxes.

On September 5, 2008, Cox made history for an American television game show &quot;Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?&quot; to win the $1,000,000 top prize (and the first to win according to the sequence in which the shows were broadcast). Cox was given the final question: &quot;Who was the longest reigning British monarch?&quot;, in which she correctly answered Queen Victoria. Cox intended to donate all her winnings to three schools in Georgia: Georgia Academy for the Blind in Macon, Atlanta Area School for the Deaf in Clarkston, and Georgia School for the Deaf in Cave Spring. All three schools are under the auspices of the Georgia Board of Education. These plans were affected by her personal bankruptcy in late 2008.

In May 2010, she announced her resignation effective July 1, 2010 in order to take a position as CEO of a new non-profit U.S. Education Delivery Institute in Washington D.C. She did not seek a third term in office. Georgia Governor Sonny Perdue appointed Brad Bryant as the interim State School Superintendent until a replacement (John Barge, a Republican) was elected in November 2010.

In 2018, Cox resumed her teaching career, teaching U.S. History at Eagle&#x27;s Landing High School in Henry County, Georgia.

==Evolution controversy==

In 2004, Cox proposed striking the word &quot;evolution&quot; from Georgia textbooks and replacing it with the phrase &quot;biological changes over time.&quot; In justifying her decision, she claimed evolution was a buzzword that created problems for teachers in conservative and rural areas, and that she had not been attempting to water down the subject matter. Among those criticizing the proposal were former President Jimmy Carter–a Georgia resident, a Democrat and a well-known Baptist–saying he was &quot;..embarrassed by Superintendent Kathy Cox&#x27;s attempt to censor and distort the education of Georgia&#x27;s students... there can be no incompatibility between Christian faith and proven facts concerning geology, biology, and astronomy.&quot;

==Personal bankruptcy==
On November 17, 2008, Cox and her husband declared Chapter 7 bankruptcy due to the failure of her husband&#x27;s home construction business, listing $3.5 million in debt and $650,000 in assets. The bankruptcy also affected the money won for the schools on &quot;Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader?&quot;. Fidelity Investments, the investor charged in creating a fund for the donor schools, donated the winnings back to Fox in December 2008 from the schools, placing the prize in a limbo that would not benefit anyone.

On August 19, 2009, protesters representing deaf and blind children picketed the office of bankruptcy attorney Gary W. Brown in Newnan, over his efforts to take control of the winnings. According to Brown, the winnings belong to the bankruptcy estate, and should be used to pay back creditors.

In October 2010, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge W. Homer Drake signed off on an agreement to split the $1 million winnings into two equal parts: one half for creditors and the other half for the three state-run schools for the blind and deaf.

<doc id="1174850" wikidata="Q448582" url="?curid=1174850" title="Log-space reduction">
<text>In computational complexity theory, a log-space reduction is a reduction computable by a deterministic Turing machine using logarithmic space. Conceptually, this means it can keep a constant number of pointers into the input, along with a logarithmic number of fixed-size integers. It is possible that such a machine may not have space to write down its own output, so the only requirement is that any given bit of the output be computable in log-space. Formally, this reduction is executed via a log-space transducer.

Such a machine has polynomially-many configurations, so log-space reductions are also polynomial-time reductions. However, log-space reductions are probably weaker than polynomial-time reductions; while any non-empty, non-full language in P is polynomial-time reducible to any other non-empty, non-full language in P, a log-space reduction from an NL-complete language to a language in L, both of which would be languages in P, would imply the unlikely L = NL. It is an open question if the NP-complete problems are different with respect to log-space and polynomial-time reductions.

Log-space reductions are normally used on languages in P, in which case it usually does not matter whether many-one reductions or Turing reductions are used, since it has been verified that L, SL, NL, and P are all closed under Turing reductions, meaning that Turing reductions can be used to show a problem is in any of these classes. However, other subclasses of P such as NC may not be closed under Turing reductions, and so many-one reductions must be used.

Just as polynomial-time reductions are useless within P and its subclasses, log-space reductions are useless to distinguish problems in L and its subclasses; in particular, every non-empty, non-full problem in L is trivially L-complete under log-space reductions. While even weaker reductions exist, they are not often used in practice, because complexity classes smaller than L (that is, strictly contained or thought to be strictly contained in L) receive relatively little attention.

The tools available to designers of log-space reductions have been greatly expanded by the result that L = SL; see SL for a list of some SL-complete problems that can now be used as subroutines in log-space reductions.

<text>The Giant&#x27;s Causeway and Bushmills Railway (GC&amp;BR) is a narrow gauge heritage railway operating between the Giant&#x27;s Causeway and Bushmills on the coast of County Antrim, Northern Ireland. The line is long.

==History==

===Original line===
The Giant&#x27;s Causeway Tramway, operated by the Giant&#x27;s Causeway, Portrush and Bush Valley Railway &amp; Tramway Company Ltd, was a pioneering narrow gauge electric railway operating between Portrush and the Giant&#x27;s Causeway. long, it was hailed at its opening as &quot;the first long electric tramway in the world&quot;. Promoted by W.A. Traill it was powered by hydroelectricity from an elevated third rail, although steam tram engines were also used in its earlier years, and the power supply was converted to overhead wire in 1899. It opened to Bushmills in 1883, the extension from there to the Causeway following on 1 July 1887. The line closed at the end of the 1949 season on Friday 30 September, and was subsequently dismantled.

===New line===

The new railway uses equipment originally assembled by Lord O’Neill for a tourist line at Shane&#x27;s Castle, Country Antrim, which closed in 1994. The idea of using this to revive part of the Tramway was largely conceived and promoted by David Laing. The Giant&#x27;s Causeway and Bushmills Railway Company is a not-for-profit organisation with charitable status. Clearance of the trackbed commenced at the end of 1999 and the railway carried its first passengers at Easter 2002.

On 10 July 2010 the railway took delivery of a specially customised 4 coach diesel multiple unit capable of accommodating up to 90 passengers. Manufactured by Severn Lamb UK Ltd., it was designed to enhance the visitor experience to the North Antrim Coast and to recreate, in so far as was possible, the passenger experience of the original hydro electric tram. Commissioning of the new rolling stock by the manufacturers began on Monday 12 July with the inaugural journey three days later. The DMU is powered by a Kubota V3600-E3 engine and shares the line with the previous steam rolling stock. All vehicles run on bogies. The power vehicle is on the Causeway side and is shorter (4 windows) than the three trailers (5 windows).

==Route==

The upper station, just below the Causeway Hotel, has a single platform and passenger, locomotive and carriage facilities, all built in traditional style for the line, which departs towards Bushfoot Strand down a gradient which is sufficient to make the engines &#x27;bark&#x27; on their return. It then follows the ancient sand dune system until it meets the River Bush where a newly installed bridge carries the line across. Just before the bridge is a passing loop, not normally used. Crossing Bushfoot Golf Course to meet Ballaghmore Road (which leads from Bushmills to Portballintrae) the line turns bringing it parallel to that road, which it follows to the lower terminus situated at the junction of the Portrush to Bushmills road. The GC&amp;BR Bushmills station is a single platform with no buildings. Alongside the line there is both a cycle track (National Cycle Network 93) and a footpath.

==Locomotives and coaches==


The line has eight 4-wheel coaches

<text>Lera Catharine &quot;Cathy&quot; Cox (born July 18, 1958) is an American academic administrator and former lawyer, politician, and journalist. She is President of Georgia College &amp; State University. Cox, a member of the Democratic Party, previously served as Secretary of State of Georgia, a candidate for Governor of Georgia in 2006, Dean of Walter F. George School of Law at Mercer University, and as the 21st president of Young Harris College.

== Biography ==
Cox was born and raised in Bainbridge, Georgia. After attending public schools, she earned her associate&#x27;s degree in agriculture from Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College. She later obtained her journalism degree from the University of Georgia. In 1986 she graduated &quot;magna cum laude&quot; from Mercer University&#x27;s Walter F. George School of Law, where she was editor-in-chief of the &quot;Mercer Law Review&quot; and elected to the Brainerd Currie Honor Society. After graduation, she was a journalist for &quot;The Gainesville Times&quot; and &quot;The Post-Searchlight&quot;. She practiced law for ten years.

She is married to attorney Mark Dehler. They have no children and are active members of the United Methodist Church. She has also served on the Board of Trustees of Mercer University as well as on the Board of Visitors of the School of Law.

== Georgia House of Representatives ==

Cox served as a member of the Georgia House of Representatives from 1993 to 1996. She represented district 154, Miller, Seminole, Early and Decatur counties. She relinquished her seat in early 1996 to become Assistant Secretary of State and temporarily retired from elective office.

== Secretary of State ==

Cox ran for Secretary of State in 1998 and defeated Republican candidate John A. McCallum with 56.6% of the vote, becoming the 25th Secretary of State of Georgia and the first woman elected to the position. She was re-elected in 2002 with 61.1% of the vote (more than any other Georgia Democrat that year) against Republican candidate Charlie Bailey.

Cox took office in January 1999 and was the first woman to serve as Georgia&#x27;s Secretary of State. Her first action in office was to move the largest division of her office from Atlanta to Macon, saying she &quot;wanted to bring government closer to the people it serves.&quot; She also instituted a universal electronic voting system, making Georgia the first American state to use such a system. Governing Magazine honored her as one of the top Public Officials of the Year in 2002 for her election reform efforts, making her the first Secretary of State in the nation to be so recognized. Cox created the Georgia Invests initiative to combat fraudulent telephone investment schemes.

In 2004, Cox rejected 63 voter registration applications on the basis that they were submitted without following procedures then required by Georgia law. The procedures not followed included obtaining specific pre-clearance from the state to conduct their drive. A suit was filed, &quot;Charles H. Wesley Education Foundation v. Cathy Cox&quot;, on the basis that the rejection of the registrations violated the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA) by undermining voter registration drives. A Senior U.S. District Judge upheld earlier federal court decisions in the case, finding against Cox, and deciding that private entities have a right under the NVRA to engage in organized voter registration activity in Georgia at times and locations of their choosing, without the presence or permission of state or local election officials.

== Gubernatorial candidacy ==

On December 27, 2004, in her hometown of Bainbridge, Cox announced her candidacy for governor of Georgia. In her announcement, she stated that she is &quot;ready and willing to work with Republicans and Democrats alike to improve education, provide access to high quality health care, and promote economic development in every region of Georgia.&quot; Cox was opposed by fellow Democrat Mark Taylor, then lieutenant governor of Georgia, and Republican Sonny Perdue, the incumbent governor of Georgia. If elected, she would have become the first female governor of Georgia. She made an early commitment to marriage equality, but abandoned that position after the primary and while heading into the general election.

Cathy Cox lost the Democratic primary and then conceded defeat to Mark Taylor during a press conference at 12:00 am on July 19, 2006.

=== Wikipedia controversy ===
On April 26, 2006, the &quot;Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; reported that the Wikipedia biography of Mark Taylor, Cox&#x27;s opponent in the 2006 Democratic gubernatorial primary, had been edited by someone using an IP address associated with the Cox gubernatorial campaign (). According to the Associated Press, Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales told reporters that the insertion of a paragraph based on opposition research relating to the arrest of Taylor&#x27;s son on driving under the influence charges had been traced back to Cox&#x27;s campaign, but said he had no way of knowing who made the change. After the story broke, Cox denied any knowledge of her campaign manager&#x27;s alleged actions and said she had instructed her staff not to make the incident an issue. Cox&#x27;s campaign manager, Morton Brilliant, resigned shortly after the incident was made public.

Bill Shipp reported in the &quot;Gwinnett Daily Post&quot; that Taylor&#x27;s aides had known for months about the edits, which they easily traced to Cox&#x27;s campaign. Taylor held back on publicizing the news until he could use it to upstage a speech by Cox that her staff called a &quot;major policy address&quot;. The resulting media coverage gave much wider publicity to the problems of Taylor&#x27;s son than the changes Brilliant made to Wikipedia.

== Post-Gubernatorial bid ==
After her unsuccessful gubernatorial run, Cox served a one-semester appointment as the Carl E. Sanders Political Leadership Scholar at the University of Georgia School of Law. As the Carl Sanders Scholar, she taught two courses, &quot;Election Law&quot; and &quot;Law and Politics&quot;, to second and third year law students.

The Carl E. Sanders Chair was established in 2002 by a $1 million gift to the UGA Law School by former Georgia governor and Chairman Emeritus of Atlanta-based law firm Troutman Sanders LLP (now merged with the Philadelphia-based Pepper Hamilton LLP to form Troutman Pepper Hamilton Sanders LLP). The gift resulted from Sanders&#x27; longstanding commitment to see the law school at the University of Georgia &quot;be one of such excellence that no citizen of Georgia need ever leave the state because a superior legal education is afforded elsewhere.&quot;.

On May 12, 2007, Cox gave the commencement address to the graduating class of Mercer University&#x27;s Walter F. George School of Law, her law school alma mater. During the ceremony, she was awarded the honorary degree, Doctor of Laws.

From 2007 through 2017, she was the 21st President of Young Harris College in Young Harris, GA.
In 2017 she became the Dean of the Walter F. George School of Law at Mercer University in Macon, GA, a position she held until being elected President of Georgia College &amp; State University in Milledgeville, GA, by the state university system&#x27;s Board of Regents. She assumed the presidency of Georgia College on October 1, 2021.

<text>The Law of Spikelets or Law of Three Spikelets (, Закон о пяти колосках, Закон семь-восемь) was a decree in the Soviet Union to protect state property of kolkhozes (Soviet collective farms)—especially the grain they produced—from theft, largely by desperate peasants during the Soviet famine of 1932–33. The decree was also known as the &quot;Seven Eighths Law&quot; (, &quot;Zakon &quot;sem&#x27; vos&#x27;mykh&quot;&quot;), because the date in Russian is filled into forms as 7/8/1932 (7 August 1932). The law provided a severe punishment for stolen collective and cooperative property: &quot;execution with confiscation of all property and replacement in mitigating circumstances with imprisonment for at least 10 years with confiscation of all property.&quot; Amnesty was prohibited in these cases.

Although the formal name of the law was longer, the common names &quot;Law of Spikelets&quot; and &quot;Law of Three Spikelets&quot; came into use because of the article and brochure of Prosecutor General A. Vyshinsky (1933), where he condemned the practice to prosecute both corrupt officials and also those who gleaned the grains (or spikelets) left behind in the fields after the entire harvest was officially collected and counted. The decree was accepted and harshly, sometimes overly harshly used during the Soviet famine of 1932–33. In 1936 the cases of the application of the law were reconsidered and over 60% of the convicted were released. (1936: 118,360 inmates; 1937: 44,409 inmates)

==Basis of decree==
The decree of the All-Union Central Executive Committee and the All-Union Council of People&#x27;s Commissars, &quot;About protection of the property of state enterprises, kolkhozes and cooperatives, and strengthening of the public (socialist) property&quot;, is dated on 7 August 1932. Before it the prosecution for theft of state or cooperative property was formal and didn&#x27;t exceed 2–5 years of prison or community work, which wasn&#x27;t a barrier for mass thefts of foodstuff and property, especially in kolkhozes. The Soviet state intended to stop it with increased penalties and even death for especially grave crimes against people and state.

* The preamble stated that the communal property (state, kolkhoz, or cooperative property) is fundamental for the Soviet social order, therefore people who try to appropriate it must be treated as enemies of the people and socialist rule.
* Section I covers theft at railways and of water communications.
* Section II covers theft of kolkhoz and cooperative property.
* Section III of the law covers violence, threats and intimidation of kolkhozniks. The punishment was 5 to 10 years of concentration camp time.

The highest punishment for theft according to this decree was execution by shooting. Under extenuating circumstances, the punishment was at least 10 years of imprisonment. In all cases convicts&#x27; personal property was to be confiscated. Convicts for crimes covered by this decree were not subject to amnesty. The law was signed by Mikhail Kalinin, Vyacheslav Molotov and Avel Enukidze.

The accompanying &quot;Instruction on the Application of the Decree of 7/8/1932&quot; (September 1932) detailed that the death sentence was to be applied with respect to organised and systematic theft, to theft accompanied with arson and other destruction. The death sentence was also applied (albeit with provisions for extenuating circumstances in some crimes) &quot;with respect to &quot;kulaks, former merchants and other socially alien elements&quot; who:
* were &quot;working in &quot;state enterprises or institutions&quot;
* were &quot;exposed in the theft of goods or selling them to the private market and embezzlement of large sums of money&quot; 
* had &quot;penetrated the collective farm and those who are outside the collective farm and who organize or take part in the theft of collective farm property and bread&quot;

Ordinary &quot;kolkhosniks&quot; and non-collectivised peasants (&quot;edinolichniks&quot;), as well as minor theft on transport, was to be punished with 10 years of imprisonment or less.

==Practice==
In the first half of the year after the announcement of the decree, (by January 1, 1933) 150,000 people were convicted on it in the RSFSR; 3.5% of them (782) were sentenced to death. The railroad transport courts () (812 sentences in the USSR) and military tribunals (208 sentences for the USSR) also handed down death sentences, but the majority was discharged by highest courts. 60.3% of the defendants were convicted to 10 years in prison, and 36.2% for periods of less than 10 years. With regard to the latter category, 80% of the defendants received punishments not connected with deprivation of liberty.

With the growing social tension due to famine, the number of those convicted in these cases in the RSFSR in the first half of 1933 reached 69,523 people, who mostly (84.5%) were sentenced to 10 years in prison. For every tenth case, a lighter sentence was imposed, and 5.4 per cent of the perpetrators were sentenced to death on cases, when the theft was committed in an organized group and hundreds of tons.

By the spring of 1933 after the decision of the Politburo of the CPSU on February 1 and the decision of the Presidium of the CEC on March 27, 1933, quantity of convictions by decree went down, in the second half of the year halved, and the following year as a whole three times less compared with 1933. Two years later, only 6,706 sentences were handed down (1935). The situation in the Ukrainian SSR was similar: 12,767 convicted in 1933, 730 people — in 1935.

== Amnesty ==
On July 26, 1935, the Politburo decided for expungement of kolkhozniks convicted wrongfully on the basis of decree.

A year later the Prosecutor General of the USSR Vyshinsky prepared a memo addressed to Stalin, Molotov and Kalinin (July 20, 1936), that the review of cases on the basis of decree was completed. In total, more than 115,000 cases were checked, and in more than 91,000 cases (79%) the application of the decree of August 7 was recognized as incorrect, and on this basis 37,425 people were released or amnestied.

It has been estimated that more than 200,000 people were charged by the OGPU, and there were 181,827 sentences in 1932-1939 (normally of 5–10 years in Gulag prison), of which less than 1,000 in 1932 and 3,754 in 1933 seem to have been death sentences. For comparison, according to the report of the Judicial Department at the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation for the first half of 2017, 127,113 people were convicted of property crimes, including for embezzlement (article 160 of the criminal code) 3,903 people, destruction or damage to property (article 167) - 1880 people.

<doc id="1174867" wikidata="Q463744" url="?curid=1174867" title="Ann Peebles">
<text>Ann Lee Peebles (born April 27, 1947) is an American retired singer and songwriter who gained popularity for her Memphis soul albums of the 1970s while signed to Hi Records. Her most successful singles include &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stand the Rain&quot;, which she wrote with her husband Don Bryant and radio broadcaster Bernie Miller, and &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Tear Your Playhouse Down&quot;. In 2014, she was inducted into the Memphis Music Hall of Fame.

==Biography==
She was born in Kinloch, Missouri, the seventh child of eleven. As a child she began singing in the choir of her father&#x27;s church and with the family&#x27;s group, the Peebles Choir, who regularly opened shows for gospel stars including Mahalia Jackson and the Soul Stirrers featuring Sam Cooke. She was also influenced by R&amp;B performers, including Muddy Waters, Mary Wells and Aretha Franklin.
She began performing in clubs in St. Louis, and in the mid-1960s joined a revue led by bandleader Oliver Sain. While visiting Memphis in 1968, she sang in a club with trumpeter Gene &quot;Bowlegs&quot; Miller, a popular local bandleader known for helping other musicians, such as the members of the Hi Rhythm Section who played on Peebles&#x27; recordings, get their start in the Memphis music industry. Miller introduced her to Hi Records producer Willie Mitchell, who quickly offered her a recording contract.

Her first record, &quot;Walk Away&quot;, written by Sain, reached the R&amp;B chart in 1969, as did the follow-up, &quot;Give Me Some Credit&quot;, and she released an album, &quot;This Is Ann Peebles&quot;. All her early records on Hi were produced by Mitchell, and featured the signature sound of the Hi Rhythm Section and Memphis Horns. In 1970, her single &quot;Part Time Love&quot; - a version of Little Johnny Taylor&#x27;s 1963 hit - reached no. 7 on the R&amp;B chart, and no.45 on the pop chart, and she began working with the Hi label&#x27;s songwriter Don Bryant, with whom she began a relationship and married in 1974. One of the first songs he wrote for her was &quot;99 Pounds&quot; in 1971.

She continued to have R&amp;B hits in the early 1970s, including &quot;I Pity the Fool,&quot; &quot;Slipped, Tripped and Fell in Love,&quot; &quot;Breaking Up Somebody&#x27;s Home&quot; (a Hot 100 hit in 1973 for Albert King and later recorded by Bette Midler), &quot;Somebody&#x27;s on Your Case,&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Tear Your Playhouse Down&quot; (later a hit for Paul Young). She was also the only female singer on Hi to release a string of albums, including &quot;Straight from the Heart&quot; and &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stand the Rain&quot;, which contained many tracks that she co-wrote with Bryant. The title track of the latter album, written by Peebles and Bryant with DJ Bernard Miller, was her biggest commercial success, reaching no. 6 on the R&amp;B chart and no. 38 on the pop chart in 1973.
Although she continued to have hit R&amp;B singles and to release albums on Hi, none matched the success of &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stand the Rain&quot;. Mitchell later said: &quot;She was the girl with the big voice who could have really gone further... But I don&#x27;t think Ann spent enough time thinking about what she needed to do. I don&#x27;t think she put as much energy into her career as a singer as some of the rest of these people.&quot;
After Hi Records closed in 1979, and with the rise of disco music, Peebles took a break from the music industry to spend more time with her family. She returned in 1989 with the album &quot;Call Me&quot;, again produced by Willie Mitchell and released on his own Waylo label. During the 1990s, she released albums on Rounder Records&#x27; Bullseye Blues subsidiary label. She continued to perform, and in 2006 she released the album &quot;Brand New Classics&quot;, which consisted of re-recordings of some of her songs in an acoustic style. Peebles also joined Cyndi Lauper on a recording of &quot;Rollin&#x27; and Tumblin&#x27;&quot; on Lauper&#x27;s 11th studio album, &quot;Memphis Blues&quot;. She gave up performing after a stroke in 2012.

<text>The Coromandel Range is a volcanic mountain range in the Coromandel Volcanic Zone running the length of the Coromandel Peninsula in the North Island of New Zealand. It is located east of the city of Auckland, and runs north–south for approximately 110 kilometres. It is at a right angle to the Tararua ranges. The highest point in the range is Mount Moehau (892 metres/2927 feet), at the northern end of the peninsula within the Moehau Range. There are numerous peaks over 600 metres in height. In pre-European times, the southern Coromandel Range was densely forested by trees such as kauri, mataī and tawa, and was a home for birds such as kererū, tūī, kākā and kiwi. Greywacke from the ranges was a source for many stone tools used by Hauraki Māori.

The range is one of several that form a volcanic origin bone running through the northern North Island. To the south of the Coromandel Range, separated by the winding Karangahake Gorge, the bone continues with the Kaimai Range.

The large island of Great Barrier, at the entrance to the Hauraki Gulf due north of the Coromandel Peninsula, can be thought of as a northern continuation of this bone of the Coromandel Volcanic Zone.

<text>The Keith and Dufftown Railway (&quot;The Whisky Line&quot;) is a heritage railway in Scotland, running for from , Keith (Ordnance Survey grid reference ) to () via () and Auchindachy.

Originally the former Great North of Scotland Railway&#x27;s Keith and Dufftown Railway, which was part of the link Aberdeen with Elgin (with the Strathspey Railway and Morayshire Railway), the line was latterly a freight-only branch for British Rail then truncated at Dufftown and serving the distillery there. Regular passenger services had been withdrawn in May 1968, but in later years it hosted a series of &quot;Northern Belle&quot; summer Sunday lunch specials from Aberdeen. These ceased in 1991 and after several years disuse, the line passed into the hands of the current operator in 1998; regular heritage trains then began running in 2000.

The line is open, and a regular service runs throughout the railway&#x27;s operating season from March to September. Special events are also run, including Santa Specials and Scots Nights. These services are run on the Class 108 DMUs.

Dufftown is the main centre of operation of the railway, and has a booking office, a waiting room and a café called the Sidings Café, which is open March to November. There are two headshunts and a loop. Work is being undertaken to install a new loop at Dufftown so that there can be two tracks going into the new engine shed.

At Keith Town station, there is a booking office and a shop which sells railway memorabilia, books, Thomas the Tank Engine items and model railway items which are sold by members of the association. This shop too is also only open during the operating season.

At present there is no connection to the main line: there are two 60 ft sections of track uplifted (these were removed in 1998 when the line was handed over). However, there are long-term plans to reconnect to the mainline; there were discussions about this between the K&amp;DRA, the local MSP Richard Lochhead and Transport Scotland in the autumn of 2015.

==Rolling stock==

The railway also owns two BR Mk1 Coaches No81295 and No975758, and a Mk2f TSO. The Mk2f arrived to replace the two Pullman coaches that were returned south.

The Keith and Dufftown also has 3 Canadian Sprinters which could be used to inspect the line. In addition, there is a variety of permanent way wagons, including 2 &quot;Grampus&quot; wagons, a &quot;Dogfish&quot; ballast wagon, a &quot;Salmon&quot; wagon and a guard&#x27;s van.

<doc id="1174903" wikidata="Q5250696" url="?curid=1174903" title="Jim Creighton">
<text>James Creighton, Jr. (April 15, 1841 – October 18, 1862) was an American baseball player during the game&#x27;s amateur era, and is considered by historians to be the sport&#x27;s first superstar and one of its earliest paid competitors. In 1860 and 1862 he played for one of the most dominant teams of the era, the Excelsior of Brooklyn. He also was reputed to be a superb cricketer, and played in many amateur and professional cricket matches.

During this early, pre-professional period of baseball&#x27;s evolution, Creighton&#x27;s pitching technique changed the sport from a game that showcased hitting, running, and fielding into a confrontation between the pitcher and batter. Under rules of the day, a pitcher was required to deliver the ball in an underhand motion with a stiff arm/stiff wrist movement. The intention was to induce the batter to swing and put the ball in play, thus initiating action on the diamond. Creighton&#x27;s swift delivery was difficult for opposing batters to hit, because they were accustomed to balls being lobbed over the plate. 

The speed with which Creighton was able to hurl the ball had previously been considered impossible without movement of the elbow or wrist, which was prohibited by existing rules. If there were any such movements by Creighton, they were imperceptible. Nonetheless, he was accused by some opponents and spectators of using an illegal delivery. In effect, because Creighton was exceptionally successful, his opponents assumed he was cheating.

However, the competitive advantage of this delivery, and his success as a pitcher, eventually led others to emulate his technique. Historian Thomas Gilbert, in his 2015 book &quot;Playing First: Early Baseball Lives at Brooklyn&#x27;s Green-Wood Cemetery&quot;, which includes a chapter on Creighton and his extended family, referred to Creighton&#x27;s pitching style as &quot;weaponizing the ball.&quot;

In October 1862, at the height of his popularity, Creighton suffered a ruptured abdominal hernia, a condition possibly caused and exacerbated by his unorthodox pitching motion and high per-game pitch counts. The rupture caused internal bleeding, and Creighton died four days later.

==Early life==
Creighton was born on April 15, 1841 in Manhattan to James and Jane Creighton, and was raised in Brooklyn. By age 16, he had become recognized in the Brooklyn area for his batting skills in both baseball and cricket. In 1857, along with other neighborhood youths, he formed a local baseball club named Young America. During this period, there were no organized leagues and few competing teams, so amateur clubs spent much of their time practicing and playing intra-squad games, with occasional matches against rivals. Young America played a few match games before disbanding. Creighton then became a member of Niagara of Brooklyn, playing second base.

==Baseball==

===Discovery by the Star Club===
In a match on July 19, 1859, the Niagaras were being heavily outscored by the Star Club of Brooklyn. Creighton, who had thus far been used by the team primarily in the infield, was brought on as a substitute pitcher. Using what observers described as a &quot;low, swift delivery,&quot; Creighton achieved uncommonly swift velocity. With the balls &quot;rising from the ground past the shoulder to the catcher,&quot; the Star batsmen were unable to hit them effectively. Under the rules of baseball at the time, a pitcher was required to deliver the ball underhanded with arm locked straight at the elbow and at the wrist. Another technique he used was to give the baseball spinning motion, making it harder for the batters to hit it squarely. Additionally, he threw a high-arcing slower pitch called a &quot;dew-drop.&quot; It was the job of the pitcher to make it easy for the batter to hit the ball as fielding was considered the game&#x27;s true skill. Star batsmen claimed that Creighton was using an illegal snap of the wrist to deliver the pitch. The Star Club eventually won the game, but following the match, Creighton left the Niagaras and joined the Stars.

===Joins the Excelsiors===

Before the 1860 season began, Creighton left the Star Club and joined one of the highest-profiled clubs in the game at the time, the Excelsior of Brooklyn. With their new star pitcher, the Excelsiors became a national sensation. They organized the first known baseball tour outside of their home region, taking on teams along the East Coast of the United States. That first season, Creighton scored 47 runs in 20 match games, and was retired just 56 times and did not strike out. In a game against the St. George Cricket Club on November 8, he recorded baseball&#x27;s first shutout. In addition to his pitching skills, he became the game&#x27;s best batter. In 1862, he batted 1.000, getting hits in all 65 of his at-bats. (The Excelsiors did not play in 1861, as many players had left to fight in the Civil War.)

===Pitching style===
When observing Creighton bowling in a cricket match, English cricketer John Lillywhite commented, &quot;Why, that man is not bowling, he is throwing underhand. It is the best disguised underhand throwing I ever saw, and might readily be taken for a fair delivery.&quot; Another observer said that his pitch was &quot;as swift as [if] it was shot out of [a] cannon.&quot; Excelsior teammate John (a.k.a. &quot;Jack&quot;) Chapman later in his life wrote that Creighton &quot;...had wonderful speed, and, with it, splendid command. He was fairly unhittable.&quot; Others, especially more tradition-minded members in the baseball community, complained that not only were his pitches illegal, but also unsportsmanlike. After Creighton held the famed rival Brooklyn Atlantics to five runs, an extraordinarily low total for the era, the &quot;Brooklyn Eagle&quot; dispatched a reporter to determine whether or not his pitch was legal. The journalistic witness reported that Creighton was throwing a &quot;fair square pitch&quot;, rather than a &quot;jerk&quot; or an &quot;underhand throw.&quot;

===Professionalism===

During this era of baseball, the game was an amateur sport, and clubs served as social organizations with sporting activities rather than as strictly sports alliances. Creighton was described as principled, unassuming, and gentlemanly — traits considered ideal during the amateur era. However, rumors circulated that clubs had started paying exceptional players in an under-the-table manner. Clubs would hire the player ostensibly for a position of responsibility within their administration, or the player would be given a sinecure in a municipal department, with the understanding that there were no actual duties required beyond playing for the sports team. 

In 1860, the Excelsior Club lured Creighton, along with teammates George Flanley and the brothers Asa and Henry Brainard. All but Henry Brainard were quietly paid a salary, with Creighton earning $500, thus making these men some of the earliest &quot;professional&quot; baseball players. After winning the National Association championship in 1860, Creighton and Asa Brainard jumped from the Excelsior Club to the Atlantic Club of Brooklyn. This move lasted only three weeks, and without having played any games, both players returned to the Excelsiors. While the practice of pay-for-play unofficially spread throughout baseball in the coming years, open professionalism didn&#x27;t begin until the 1869 season, when the Cincinnati Red Stockings paid a salary to each member of the team.

==Cricket==
Creighton was considered a prominent member of the cricket community, playing both amateur and professional. He performed for the American Cricket Club in both 1861 and 1862, often playing against the all-England team, whether at Hoboken&#x27;s Elysian Fields or elsewhere. Though the English teams would dominate these matches, Creighton fared well. In an 1859 match of 11 Englishmen against 16 Americans, he clean bowled five wickets out of six successive balls.

==Death==

There has been some historical controversy about the circumstances of Creighton&#x27;s death. On October 14, 1862, Creighton played second base in a match on the Excelsior Grounds against the Union of Morrisania club, while Brainard pitched. Creighton had allegedly hit four doubles in four at bats during the first five innings. As chronicled 50 years later by a witness to the game, Jack Chapman, Creighton took over pitching duties from Brainard in the sixth inning, and in his next at bat hit a home run. While swinging the bat, he allegedly suffered an injury in his abdominal area. According to Chapman, when Creighton crossed home plate, he commented to the next batter, George Flanley, that he heard something snap. After the game, he began to experience severe pain and hemorrhaging in his abdomen. He died in his father&#x27;s home on October 18 at the age of 21. In an 1887 issue of an early sports newspaper, the &quot;Sporting Life&quot;, a letter-writer, who signed only as &quot;Old Timer&quot;, sent in his account of the event. This account reported it as a ruptured bladder; in the light of modern medical understanding, the injury was most likely a ruptured inguinal hernia.

However, subsequent research indicates that Creighton&#x27;s death by hitting a home run was fabricated years later to dramatize his martyrdom. &quot;Dying while hitting a long home run is a great story; it&#x27;s just not true,&quot; said Tom Shieber, senior curator of the National Baseball Hall of Fame. Shieber researched original news sources and found no references to Creighton hitting a home run in that game. The death-by-home-run myth was popularized, and probably started, five decades later by Chapman. Alfred H. Spink&#x27;s 1910 book &quot;The National Game&quot; quoted Chapman as saying, &quot;I was present at the game between the Excelsiors and the Unions [sic] of Morrisiana at which Jim Creighton injured himself. He did it in hitting out a home run. When he had crossed the rubber [i.e., home plate] he turned to George Flanley and said, &#x27;I must have snapped my belt.&#x27;&quot; Countless historians have refuted this legend, but it has taken root as factual. 

Later research has suggested that Creighton&#x27;s hernia was chronic, and that the tremendous workload from baseball and cricket contributed to worsening the hernia. In that era, balls and strikes were not called, and batters who could not hit Creighton&#x27;s rapid deliveries adapted by refusing to swing at good pitches, forcing Creighton to throw well over 300 pitches per match. Pitching with great force and the exaggerated body contortions necessary to achieve high velocity exacerbated his condition.

Creighton&#x27;s death caused concern in the sports world that public perceptions of baseball and cricket would focus on the inherent dangers of their play, hurting the sports&#x27; popularity. Though it is generally accepted that Creighton fatally injured himself while playing baseball, it was reported that the Excelsior president, Dr. Joseph Jones, made comments during the National Association convention of 1862 that constituted an attempt to &quot;correct&quot; this notion. He claimed that Creighton had suffered the injury, instead, while playing cricket in a match on October 7. Later research claims that Dr. Jones&#x27; assertions are correct; Creighton had died of a &quot;strangulated intestine&quot;, and did not hit a home run during his final game. Dr. Jones&#x27; remarks have been interpreted as his attempt to save baseball&#x27;s image, and its nearly equal standing with cricket, as well as his team&#x27;s legacy after losing their best player. Baseball at the time was constantly &quot;looking forward&quot;, and Creighton&#x27;s death provided the sport with a certain mythology and much-needed nostalgia. 

Creighton was buried in Brooklyn&#x27;s Green-Wood Cemetery. His gravesite was marked by a 12-foot marble obelisk crowned with a large marble baseball.

==Legacy==

Baseball writer John Thorn commented in his book, &quot;Baseball in the Garden of Eden: The Secret History of the Early Game,&quot; that Creighton &quot;was baseball&#x27;s first hero, and I believe, the most important player not inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.&quot;

At the time, the sport of cricket was the most popular team sport in the United States, but Creighton and the Excelsiors had brought considerable attention to baseball. Creighton&#x27;s popularity grew substantially after his death. In the following decade, teams began honoring him by naming themselves after him, and others paid tribute by visiting his gravesite. As long as twenty years later, though the public adored their star pitchers, comparisons to Creighton would inevitably emerge. It was not considered controversial to compliment a pitcher with the caveat that he &quot;warn&#x27;t no Creighton.&quot; For years following his death, the Excelsiors&#x27; program included a portrait of their team with Creighton, shrouded in black, featured prominently in the center.

Creighton&#x27;s indirect legacy is perhaps most profoundly seen in what is now considered a fundamental component of the game: the called ball and the walk. Neither existed during Creighton&#x27;s lifetime, but his many imitators, who pitched with Creighton&#x27;s velocity but not his control, prompted batters to stand at the plate without swinging for lengthy intervals, waiting for a pitch within reach. Consequently, the sport&#x27;s then-governing body, the National Association of Base Ball Players, introduced a rule for the 1864 season which penalized pitchers who repeatedly failed to deliver &quot;good balls:&quot; the called ball, three of which gave the batter a free pass to first base. 

:&quot;Many think that the rule in reference to pitching will greatly promote the attractiveness of the game... The time will come when slow, twisting balls, pitched with skill and judgment, will supersede the rifle-shooter of would-be Creightons. The fast pitching system is “played out”. Spectators have become disgusted with waiting hour after hour to see three or four innings played, the pitcher and catcher tired from over-work, the batsman annoyed and irritated from waiting for good balls, the fieldsmen idle and cross for want of something to do, and all the “vim” and spirit of the game being lost, because “we want to show ‘em what a bully swift pitcher we’ve got”.

:&quot;These new rules, in this respect, practically take the most effective part of swift pitching out of the hands of pitchers; for, to tell the truth, not a solitary instance of fair pitching, that was very swift, have we seen since Creighton died.&quot;

==Posthumous postscripts==

The 12-foot marble obelisk marking Creighton&#x27;s grave at Green-Wood was originally crowned with a large marble baseball. However, the finial went missing and was presumed stolen in the late 19th or early 20th century. In 2014, after a successful funding campaign to restore the monument, a replica of the original finial was installed and unveiled during a public ceremony.

Only two photographs of Creighton are known to exist, one of him posing as a pitcher, the other as a member of the Brooklyn Excelsiors.

The television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot; made reference to Creighton in the Season 3 episode &quot;Homer at the Bat&quot;, where Mr. Burns has him pegged as the right fielder for his company&#x27;s softball team. His assistant Smithers has to point out that all the players Mr. Burns had selected are long dead, making reference in particular to Creighton by saying &quot;In fact, your right fielder has been dead for 130 years.&quot;

<text>The Strathspey Railway (SR) in Badenoch and Strathspey, Highland, Scotland, operates a heritage railway from Aviemore to Broomhill, Highland via Boat of Garten, part of the former Inverness and Perth Junction Railway (later part of the Highland Railway) which linked Aviemore with Forres. It is one of only a handful of former primary/secondary main lines to be preserved in Britain today.

== The route ==

=== Aviemore ===

The Strathspey Railway operates from platform 3 of Network Rail&#x27;s Aviemore railway station. Until 1998 the railway&#x27;s southern terminus was Aviemore Speyside about further north. Aviemore Speyside is no longer in regular use, although its platform has been retained as a fallback in case of problems with access to the Network Rail station. Coaling of the steam locomotives is carried out at a facility constructed in 2014 on the site of the former Aviemore Speyside station building. Its signal box, which was formerly at Garve West and transported from there in 1986, was retained when the station itself shut. New features are gradually being brought into service at the Aviemore site controlled using traditional British Railways mechanical semaphore signalling.

From Aviemore, the line passes the four-road locomotive shed which was constructed by the Highland Railway in 1898. The original purpose of the shed was to house locomotives for the lines to Perth and Inverness (via Carrbridge and Forres). It was common for original Highland Railway engines to be allocated to the shed and in London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) days it housed Stanier Black Fives, Pickersgill Bogies (Caledonian Railway), Caley 439 tanks, Caley 812 classes, and Fairburn Tanks. In British Railways days the shed was allocated the shed code &#x27;60B&#x27;. These days the engines that are in traffic on the Strathspey Railway still bear the 60B shedplate on their smokebox. The shed has a turntable, originally from Kyle of Lochalsh. There is also a carriage maintenance shed which was erected and opened for use in 2005; this shed allows the railway&#x27;s volunteers and staff to work on its fleet of coaches indoors. On the opposite side of the line is a three road carriage storage shed erected and opened in 2011; this allows the coaches to be stored under cover and protected from the weather.

The former engine crew hostel, called Spey Lodge, stands just to the north. This building was erected by the LMS during the Second World War to provide railway crews with a safe and cheap option for accommodation whilst rostered to work locally. The British Railways Staff Association For Scotland then took it on to provide holiday accommodation for railway staff and their families. It was saved by the Strathspey Railway Company during the 1970s and gradually the facilities have been upgraded by volunteers. Spey Lodge now fulfils its original role again, providing hostel accommodation for engine crews and other volunteers working on the railway.

After Spey Lodge, the railway passes the site of the Aviemore Hospital then crosses Dalfaber level crossing, an Automatic Barrier Crossing Locally monitored (ABCL). This level crossing was not originally part of the railway, but was installed after the development of the Dalfaber Estate in the 1980s, and was upgraded to a half-barrier crossing in March 2023. Prior the barrier upgrade, the crossing had been involved in one major incident in 2005. After crossing the road and passing the Cairngorm Brewery the line climbs through Granish Moor. This heather moor affords views of Cairngorm Mountain and the line runs parallel to the Speyside Way, a popular walking and cycling route. Once into the forest at the north end of the moor, the line descends past Boat of Garten golf course and into the village of Boat of Garten itself.

=== Boat of Garten ===


The extensive Boat of Garten station features its original buildings, dating from 1904 by the architect William Roberts and is a category B listed building.. The modest station building houses a booking hall and ticket office/shop plus toilets and the waiting room which still has its open fire. A recent addition is a coffee shop in the old gas house on platform 1. It was originally a parallel junction between the Highland Railway&#x27;s main line from Perth to Forres and the Great North of Scotland Railway (GNSR) branch to Craigellachie - this was the original Strathspey Railway, the company being a subsidiary of the GNSR. Today there are two passenger platforms and the yard stores the majority of the SR&#x27;s out of use rolling stock.

Boat of Garten also has the railway&#x27;s only water column where the locomotives stop to take water on their way north through the station. There are two signal boxes, Boat of Garten North and Boat of Garten South and signalling uses traditional British Railways mechanical semaphore signalling; it is the crossing point on the line when there are two trains running. The single track section from Boat of Garten South to Aviemore Speyside is controlled by Electric Key Token while that from Boat of Garten North to Broomhill is still worked by Staff and Ticket.

Most of what visitors to the railway see today is original from the days of British Railways. The main layout of the station has not been altered significantly, with the exception of the extensive yard behind the signal box. The turnout that formerly allowed access to the yard without having to access the headshunt was removed before the line closed and there are no plans to re-install it. A new storage shed was built over the first three tracks of the yard in 2018–2019 to provide additional covered accommodation.

Leaving Boat of Garten, trains cross the road on the new single-track box-girder bridge and pass the site of the original, long-demolished GNSR engine shed, where a permanent way depot now stands. The track had been lifted and structures demolished by British Rail after closure of the line in the 1960s. The railway now passes through mainly farmland following the River Spey on the re-laid track, which was mostly recovered from Kincardine power station in Fife in the 1990s. The tracks to Craigellachie and Grantown had originally left the station extending in a double track formation as far as Croftnahaven, where the GNSR line turned sharply south east and crossed the River Spey. This arrangement was adopted because a signal box for a junction here was deemed too expensive.

=== Broomhill ===
The line reaches its current terminus at Broomhill , in countryside roughly halfway between the villages of Nethy Bridge and Dulnain Bridge. The replica station building has been reconstructed on the foundations of the original. The run-round loop is beyond the station. It is anticipated that this will be removed when the extension to Grantown is complete. Broomhill was used as the station for Glenbogle, in the BBC series &quot;Monarch of the Glen&quot;.
== Future extension ==
In July 2006, the Scottish Executive made a firm commitment to re-aligning the A95 at Gaich, near Grantown. This move would allow the extension of the SR to Grantown along the original Highland Railway line to Dava and Forres. It is not now intended to reconstruct the former Grantown-on-Spey West railway station, now in an industrial estate; instead it is proposed to construct a new three-platform terminus on a greenfield site about 3/4 track-mile further north. Track that was lifted from the Stirling to Alloa railway when it was relaid for a new passenger service has been donated to this project.

The BBC reported that the £2.9m road scheme would involve the rail line going under the A95. The then Transport Minister, Tavish Scott, said the project would be ready for construction by 2008–9 and funding had been allocated for 2009–10. Former Strathspey MP, Danny Alexander, speculated that the proposed rail link between Aviemore and Grantown would be good for tourism.

By May 2007 the trackbed had been cleared north of the Broomhill loop as far as the bridge over the River Dulnain. New fencing, mileposts and drainage works were progressing and it was hoped for track laying to start later in 2008. Travelling by road along the A95 from Grantown towards Aviemore, new fencing marking the new track alignment could be seen.

In October 2008, it was announced that the steelwork of the former Merry Street Bridge in Motherwell had been donated to the railway by Network Rail. In February 2014, the Strathspey Railway used this steelwork to replace the missing bridge over the River Dulnain. The bridge was installed, with the railway working with Colas Rail, who provided one of the few rail cranes in the UK capable of lifting the bridge into position. Following the installation, track has been laid across the bridge to the north side of the River Dulnain. No further construction work on the extension can be carried out until the Scottish Government grants the appropriate Statutory Order. Because the entire extension lies within the Cairngorm National Park, the formal application has had to be delayed so that additional wildlife and environmental studies can be undertaken.

However, Transport Scotland since notified the railway that the project has been reevaluated in late 2008 and was now estimated to cost £5.3 million, leading Transport Scotland to consider the extension project too expensive to pursue. The railway was faced with raising £1 million by 31 December 2009, to fund construction of a planned tunnel on the extension, but even if the funds were raised, construction was not guaranteed to occur. In June 2016, the entire project, including the re-aligned A95 and new bridge at Gaich, track and new station, was estimated at £13.5 million.

Management for building the extension is being undertaken by The Strathspey Railway Charitable Trust. All the various fundraising efforts are coordinated by the SRCT, including a charitable appeal. They also manage the negotiations with the various landowners and public bodies required to push the line through to Grantown-on-Spey.

== Strathspey Railway Association ==
The role of the Strathspey Railway Association is to provide funding and volunteers to run the Strathspey Railway. It is the biggest shareholder of the Strathspey Railway Company (the organisation which holds the light rail orders and operates the railway). Members fund various projects on the railway through an annual subscription and donations. A quarterly publication, &quot;The Strathspey Express&quot;, is published by the Association to give members regular updates from the railway as well as articles of general railway interest.

Most of the people who work on the railway are volunteers belonging to the Association. Spey Lodge is managed by a sub-group of the Association to provide accommodation for volunteers.

<doc id="1174905" wikidata="Q614287" url="?curid=1174905" title="Primal Rage">
<text>Primal Rage is a fighting game developed and released by Atari Games for arcades in 1994. The game takes place on a post-apocalyptic version of Earth called &quot;Urth&quot;. Players control one of seven prehistoric beasts, that battle each other to determine the planet&#x27;s fate. Matches feature many of the conventions of fighting games from the era, including special moves and gory finishing maneuvers. Ports were released for home video game consoles and personal computers. Efforts to perfectly emulate the arcade original have been unsuccessful due to the use of an unusual copy protection method. Toys, comics, a novel and other merchandise tie-ins were produced. More than 1.5 million copies of the game were sold.

== Gameplay ==

&quot;Primal Rage&quot; is a traditional two-dimensional fighting game in which two players select characters to battle each other in one-on-one combat, or a single player is faced with a campaign of fights against CPU opponents of increasing difficulty. The final battle of the single-player game (accessible only at difficulty level 10 or higher) consists of fighting all the other monsters, this time with an increased power bar, made available in a minigame prior to the fight. A total of seven characters are playable: Blizzard, the ape-like god of good; Armadon, the ceratopian/thyreophoran-like god of life; Talon, the raptor-like god of survival; Sauron, the tyrannosaur-like god of hunger; Chaos, the ape-like god of decay; Vertigo, the cobra-like goddess of insanity and Diablo, the tyrannosaur-like god of evil. Each character has their own specialized set of three attack moves and abilities. The object is to deplete the opposing character&#x27;s health meter before the player&#x27;s own runs out. There are also seven different background stages where fighting takes place, each one representing one of the character&#x27;s innate domains: the Cliff (Blizzard), the Hollows (Armadon), the Strip (Talon), the Cove (Sauron), the Ruins (Chaos), the Tomb (Vertigo) and the Inferno (Diablo).

During fights, human tribesmen wander nearby and worship the creatures as gods. This allows for the creatures to toss them around or devour some to regain health (eating opponents&#x27; worshipers adds a bonus to one&#x27;s score, while eating one&#x27;s own will penalize the player). Prior to the final battle, a minigame commences in which the player is given the chance to eat as many worshippers as possible to increase health for the endurance round. Two human-controlled characters can trigger easter egg minigames of human volleyball and bowling.

Unlike most fighting games, where the special moves are performed by moving the joystick followed by pressing one or more buttons, &quot;Primal Rage&quot; features a system where the player holds down certain buttons, then performs the joystick movements. Later revisions of the arcade game added the ability to perform special moves in the more traditional way, with motion followed by button presses, but kept the original method as well. After the opponent is defeated, a brief moment is allowed for the player to perform a finishing move to end the match in a more dramatic fashion; these are performed in a similar manner to the special moves. Although all characters feature three finishing moves, some of them tend to the humorous side, such as Vertigo&#x27;s &quot;La Vache Qui Rit&quot; (French for &quot;the laughing cow&quot;), a fatality in which Vertigo transforms her opponent into a cow, which moos and runs away.

==Plot==
A massive meteor strike has devastated Earth. Human civilization comes to an end in the ensuing cataclysms and humanity regresses into tribes of Stone Age dwellers. A primordial rainforest covers the land and the continental landmass has shifted into the shape of a fire-breathing dinosaur skull. The planet is now primitively referred to as &quot;Urth&quot; by the survivors of the cataclysms.

Seven fearsome creatures with supernatural abilities emerge from their slumber deep within the Urth&#x27;s crust, and become worshiped as gods by the humans, who form segregated clans beneath the ones they follow. The beasts themselves are divided between those who wish to keep peace on Urth, and those who attempt to plunge the world into further chaos for their own benefit.

==Development==
Animator Jason Leong recounted: &quot;Every year [Time Warner Interactive] throws a brain-storming session where everybody brings up new game ideas. A few years ago I brought up the concept of a head-to-head dinosaur fighting game, which coincidentally someone else also brought up, but their idea was just two T. Rexes fighting. My original write-up included ideas that finally appeared in the game, such as different species of quickly moving dinosaurs and the concept of the dinosaurs being gods.&quot; 

Development began with a series of production sketches of the fighters drawn by Leong. Using these drawings as a basis, model maker Dan Platt crafted model figures of the fighters, from which flexible metal armatures were then cast. The models were airbrushed according to Leong&#x27;s drawings. The models were filmed through the process of stop-motion animation, with about 400 frames shot for each fighter. Production coordinator Stephen Riesenberger says the game was designed to be accessible to novices, with its four-button controls being less daunting than the standard six-button layout, and unusual special move inputs making it easier to perform the attacks by button mashing.

==Release==
&quot;Primal Rage&quot; was released for arcades by Time Warner Interactive during August 1994. The game was released in two variants: a standard 25″ cabinet and a deluxe 33″ cabinet. Commercial ports of the title include: 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, 32X, Amiga, Atari Jaguar CD, Game Boy, Game Gear, MS-DOS, PlayStation, Sega Genesis, Sega Saturn and Super Nintendo Entertainment System. To promote the home versions, Time Warner Interactive hosted a &quot;National Primal Rage Video Game Tournament&quot; at Six Flags Over Texas in October 1995. A Mac OS port was also planned to be published on November 14, 1995 and advertised in &quot;Macworld&quot;″s January 1996 issue. However, development on the conversion was cancelled in April of the same year.

&quot;Primal Rage&quot; was ported to the Game Boy by Probe Software and released in North America and Europe on August 25, 1995. This port excludes Vertigo from the roster and features a reduced moveset for every character and downgraded visuals. The Game Gear port is similar to the Game Boy release but with color graphics, much of the blood and gore retained, and the &quot;urination&quot; fatality intact. This port has smaller sprites, less vibrant colors, and a cheat code that replaces Diablo&#x27;s followers with Fergus McGovern, former CEO and founder of Probe Software. Prior to launch, a limited version was available for Sega Channel subscribers and a different version was released through the service on August 26, 1995, with twenty-four percent of subscribers taking part in the event to receive an 800 number and win prizes. The SNES port, developed by Bitmasters and released in both North America and Europe on August 25, 1995, has more detailed visuals compared to the Genesis release; however, Chaos&#x27;s golden shower fatality was censored. The MS-DOS port, developed by Teeny Weeny Games, features a special setup for keyboard setups and runs at a low resolution.

&quot;Primal Rage&quot; was ported to the 3DO and published by LG Electronics in North America and Europe on November 14, 1995, featuring a pre-rendered introduction full-motion video sequence and smaller sprites compared to previous releases. The 32X port was developed by Probe Entertainment and first published in North America on November 14, 1995 and in Europe in March 1996. It is based on the Genesis release but features more arcade-accurate visuals. The Jaguar CD port is similar to the 3DO release, although it lacks the full-motion video introduction and has shorter loading times. The PlayStation port was released in North America and Europe on November 14, 1995, and in Japan on December 13, 1996. It features long loading times and fewer frames of animation for each character than the arcade version. The Amiga port was released only in Europe in December 1995, with visuals similar to the Genesis release. Although marketed as an Amiga 1200 release, this port is compatible with any Amiga computer with a least 2MB of RAM.

The Saturn port was released in North America in June 1996, in Europe in August 1996, and in Japan by GameBank on March 26, 1998, featuring more colors, larger sprites, and pre-rendered full motion video sequences for each character in single-player mode. The Saturn version of &quot;Primal Rage&quot; was the last version to be released. Senior producer Ken Humphries explained, &quot;To be honest, the Saturn version got lost in the shuffle. In the process of trying to get other versions done, the Saturn version was the one they ended up pulling resources from.&quot; To allow the Saturn version to run at a solid frame rate, it was made to run at 30 Hz instead of the usual 60 Hz. According to Humphries, it was easier to make the Saturn hardware approximate the size of the arcade version&#x27;s sprites than it was with other conversions of the game.

All console versions are based on version 1.7 of the arcade. A largely revised version of the arcade game, version 2.3, was released later in 1994. Features include modified special inputs, balance changes and additional content, such as one additional finisher per character, among many others.

A version based on arcade version 2.3 was included as part of &quot;Midway Arcade Treasures 2&quot; for GameCube, PlayStation 2 and Xbox in 2004, later being included as part of &quot;Midway Arcade Treasures Deluxe Edition&quot; for the PC in 2006.

There is also an R-Zone version that plays the same as a Tiger Handheld variation of the game. It features Blizzard, Chaos, Talon, Sauron, Vertigo, and Diablo as playable characters, and Armadon serves as the final boss.

==Reception==
&quot;Primal Rage&quot; was a major commercial success, although Atari Games derived more profit from its merchandising than from the game itself. &quot;RePlay&quot; reported the game to be the third-most-popular deluxe arcade game at the time. &quot;Play Meter&quot; also listed the title to be the fourth-most-popular arcade game at the time. &quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the original arcade version, stating that &quot;All in all, an excellent show of graphics and sound design tarnished by unbalanced gameplay.&quot; &quot;AllGame&quot;″s Brad Cook praised the arcade version&#x27;s visuals, sound, gameplay, and replay value, stating that &quot;This is a fun game and a good value at 25 cents per play with 25 cents to continue.&quot; It was nominated for the Video Software Dealers Association&#x27;s &quot;Video Game of the Year&quot; for 1995, losing to &quot;Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy&#x27;s Kong Quest&quot;.

&quot;GamePro&quot; gave the Game Boy and Game Gear versions rave reviews, particularly applauding the graphics and the large selection of easy-to-execute special moves. They added that &quot;There haven&#x27;t been Game Gear graphics like these since MK II [&quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot;]″s debut&quot; and expressed astonishment at the absence of slowdown in the Game Boy version. Likewise, &quot;VideoGames&quot;″s Gabe Soria commended both the Game Boy and Game Gear versions. &quot;Mega Fun&quot;″s Stephan Girlich and Ulf Schneider commended the visuals but criticized the sound design. &quot;Mean Machines Sega&quot; gave the Game Gear version a positive outlook, but one reviewer remarked that the game does not translate as well as the Genesis version. &quot;Sega Pro&quot;″s Steve Hardy praised the visuals but criticized the complex controls due to the Game Gear&#x27;s limited number of buttons.

&quot;GamePro&quot; gave more mixed reviews to the Genesis and Super NES versions, criticizing that the sprites are too small and the graphics in general are unimpressive, especially in the Genesis version. The Genesis version&#x27;s reviewer complained that the controls are a straight translation of the arcade version&#x27;s four-button control, making special moves needlessly awkward to execute, while the Super NES version&#x27;s reviewer said the game was outshone by the Super NES version of &quot;Killer Instinct&quot;, which came out at the same time. However, they praised the combo system and character design and gave both versions an overall recommendation. &quot;VideoGames&quot;″s Dan Vebber argued that the Genesis version failed to replicate the arcade original. &quot;Mega Fun&quot;″s Girlich and Schneider commended the presentation and sound. &quot;Sega Power&quot;″s Dean Mortlock praised the visuals and replay value, regarding the Genesis version as &quot;Another excellent conversion from Probe. A worthy alternative to current beat-em-ups.&quot; &quot;MAN!AC&quot;″s Oliver Ehrle criticized the graphics and sound of the Genesis and Super NES versions. &quot;Mean Machines Sega&quot; gave the Genesis version a rave review, stating that the game is a &quot;great beat &#x27;em up which may have been beaten to its niche&quot;. &quot;Next Generation&quot; derided the graphics in the Genesis version, saying the sprites have &quot;that flat, fuzzy, pasted-on-the-screen look that just isn&#x27;t acceptable anymore.&quot; The reviewer further argued that the actual play mechanics of &quot;Primal Rage&quot; are unexceptional, such that without the sharp graphics and sounds of the arcade version the game is not worth playing. &quot;Sega Pro&quot;″s Mat Yeo commended Probe&#x27;s work on the Genesis version but noted several missing features compared to the arcade original, stating that it fell short of capturing the &quot;frantic fighting action of the coin-op&quot;. &quot;Mega Fun&quot;″s Girlich and Schneider praised the SNES version&#x27;s visuals and sound. &quot;Next Generation&quot; stated that the SNES version is &quot;so average it hurts to watch, much less play.&quot; &quot;Hobby Consolas&quot;″s Sonia Herranz highly praised the gameplay, graphics, and sound design. &quot;Jeuxvideo.com&quot;″s Nuktos praised the presentation, gameplay, and sound but criticized the replay value.

&quot;Next Generation&quot; found that though the 3DO version accurately recreated the arcade version&#x27;s graphics and sound, the visuals had become severely dated in the years since it was first released and the gameplay was never very deep to begin with. &quot;GamePro&quot; similarly said that the 3DO version had the best graphics and sounds of any home version to date, but that &quot;it still won&#x27;t convert those who never took to the arcade original&quot;, though they had an overall more positive impression of the game. &quot;Mega Fun&quot;″s Sandrie Souleiman praised the graphics and sound of the 3DO version but said that the PlayStation version was better. &quot;Fun Generation&quot;″s Philipp Noack and Götz Schmiedehause commended the sound and gameplay of the 3DO version, but both said the visuals were better on the PlayStation version. Likewise, &quot;MAN!AC&quot;″s Oliver Ehrle commended the visuals and sound of the 3DO version but said that the PlayStation version was slightly better.

&quot;GameFan&quot; praised the visual presentation of the 32X version, though the reviewers criticized the sound and lack of additional gore effects from the arcade original. In the same issue of &quot;GamePro&quot; which described the 3DO version as the best port of the game, a different reviewer contended that the 32X version is the best one, with graphics comparable to the 3DO version&#x27;s and controls which are easier than the 3DO&#x27;s when using the six-button controller. &quot;Hobby Consolas&quot; praised the sprite&#x27;s quality and gameplay speed compared to the previous 16-bit versions. &quot;Mean Machines Sega&quot; gave the 32X version a positive outlook but stated that the game fell short when compared to others in the 32X library. &quot;Sega Power&quot;″s James Ashton regarded the 32X version to be as good as the previous Genesis release but noted that the game &quot;doesn&#x27;t add much to the monster mash formula.&quot; &quot;IGN&quot;″s Levi Buchanan said that the 32X version paled in comparison to the arcade original.

&quot;Última Generación&quot;″s Gonzalo Herrero commended the Jaguar CD version, praising the visuals, sound design, and controls. &quot;GamePro&quot; assessed the Jaguar CD version as &quot;one of the Jag CD&#x27;s strongest&quot; games. They criticized the smaller sprites but said the game otherwise did an exemplary job of recreating the graphics and sound of the arcade version, and that the control with the Jaguar ProController is excellent. In contrast, &quot;AllGame&quot;″s Colin Williamson commended the controls but criticized the downgraded visuals compared to the arcade original and loading times, stating that &quot;It&#x27;s sad that the Jaguar CD suffered such a horrible fate—but with games like this one, it&#x27;s no big surprise. This is one dino-sized disappointment.&quot;

&quot;GameFan&quot; praised the PlayStation version for being a near-arcade perfect port, and for the addition of a six-button control setup. &quot;GamePro&quot; declared the PlayStation version the new best, commenting that the control setup is particularly suited to the PlayStation Controller and &quot;The graphics blow away all other versions to date, and even make the arcade version seem tame.&quot; However, they found the game less impressive than recent fighting games such as &quot;Virtua Fighter 2&quot;. &quot;VideoGames&quot; stated that the PlayStation version was not worth the asking price due to persisting gameplay issues from the arcade original. &quot;IGN&quot; opined that the PlayStation version paled in comparison to 3-D fighting games on the market.

&quot;GamePro&quot; and &quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot; both ruled that the Saturn version, though superior to previous versions, was sorely outdated by the time of its release, particularly due to the game&#x27;s simplistic and repetitive combat. &quot;VideoGames&quot; noted the Saturn&#x27;s visuals to be better than the PlayStation version. &quot;GameFan&quot;, as with the PlayStation version, commended the Saturn release for being a near-arcade perfect port but criticized the full-motion video sequences. &quot;Fun Generation&quot;″s Götz Schmiedehause and Stephan Girlich commended the visuals and sound of the Saturn version. &quot;Mega Fun&quot;″s Sandrie Souleiman praised the visuals but criticized the sound design of the Saturn version. &quot;Mean Machines Sega&quot; regarded the Saturn version to be a fair conversion of the arcade original. &quot;AllGame&quot;″s Joe Ottoson criticized the Saturn version&#x27;s visuals and sound design but commended its replay value, stating that &quot;If you can bear the loading times and the unusual system for executing super moves, there&#x27;s some interesting things to unearth.&quot;

===Controversy===
In 1996, Ellie Rovella of Gilbert, Arizona launched a grassroots campaign against the game after her 11-year-old son bought and played the Genesis version of &quot;Primal Rage&quot; and executed Chaos&#x27;s urination fatality. The campaign resulted in Best Buy pulling the game from 251 stores nationwide. In response, &quot;Primal Rage&quot; publisher Time Warner Interactive pointed out that Rovella never complained to Time Warner, instead taking the issue directly to the media, and that the game was clearly rated &quot;T&quot; for Teen and so should not have been purchased by her 11-year-old son in the first place. They also resubmitted &quot;Primal Rage&quot; for evaluation by the ESRB, who determined that the game had nothing in it to merit increasing the rating to &quot;M&quot; for mature or &quot;AO&quot; for adults only, and again rated it &quot;T&quot;. After this reevaluation, Best Buy put every version of &quot;Primal Rage&quot; back on the shelves except for the Genesis version, which they said they would only sell if it were rated &quot;M&quot;, even though most home versions of the game contain all the same fatalities and gore.

Time Warner PR director Tracy Egan said the publisher was not overly concerned about the Ellie Rovella controversy since &quot;Primal Rage&quot;, being a two-year-old arcade game, was already past its sales peak by the time Rovella started her campaign. In the United Kingdom, the game&#x27;s advertisement parodied the controversy by placing gentle scenes over the violent parts and having Simon Bates mock his VSC video warnings.

==Merchandise==

After an unveiling at the 1996 American International Toy Fair, five inch action figures of the seven &quot;Primal Rage&quot; characters (each bundled with accessories like lava rocks, armor, and tiny humans) were released in stores. &quot;Sirius Entertainment&quot; published a 4-issue comic book mini-series based on the game from 1996 to 1998. Issue #1 features color interior art, and the low-run published issues #2–4 feature black-and-white interior art.

==Canceled sequel==
By 1995, Atari had begun production of &quot;Primal Rage II&quot;. Ken Humphries, senior producer of the home versions of the original &quot;Primal Rage&quot;, said in an early 1996 interview that &quot;&quot;Primal Rage 2&quot; should come out in the arcades in September 1996. As soon as they finish that, we&#x27;ll start working on the consumer versions.&quot; However, the game did not get very far into production before being canceled, as Atari said that it wouldn&#x27;t generate enough sales.

The controls were expanded from a four-button to a six-button configuration. The game was to feature all seven gods from the original plus ten newcomers: a new dinosaur, a boss, and eight humans called the Avatars, that were the gods&#x27; surrogates on Urth, with the first game&#x27;s characters meant to make a comeback as said gods. Necrosan, a boss in the form of a skeletal dragon, once rumored by video game magazine &quot;GamePro&quot; to be added in an updated release of the original &quot;Primal Rage&quot;, was to become the main antagonist.

The plot focuses on the years after the first game&#x27;s timeline. It turns out the meteor that crashed on Urth was actually an egg which hatched a being known as Necrosan. The warriors would be Malyssa: Avatar of Vertigo, Arik: Avatar of Sauron, Keena: Avatar of Talon, Shank: Avatar of Chaos, Sinjin: Avatar of Diablo, Kaze: Avatar of Blizzard, Tor: Avatar of Armadon, and Xiao Ming: Avatar of Slash Fang. Slash Fang is a newly introduced Primal God in the form of a Smilodon-type Weretiger.

Although the game never came to be, its story was later adapted into &quot;Primal Rage: The Avatars&quot;. Also, the characters of Slash Fang and Necrosan were released with the other god characters in the short-lived &quot;Primal Rage&quot; action figure series.

A test arcade cabinet briefly appeared playable at the Golfland arcades in Milpitas, California and Sunnyvale, California, and a supposedly finished machine of this was shown at the California Extreme 2001 show. The machine had the original board and most of the original art. In subsequent years, screenshots of the incomplete game were released on the Internet. In December 2012, a YouTube user posted a video of the game, and then in June 2014, it was reported that the game was available for play at Galloping Ghost Arcade in Brookfield, Illinois. With only two boards of the game considered to be in existence, a dump from the game&#x27;s board had been circulating online for years, but no emulator had been able to run it, until in March 2017 it was revealed that an individual had created a modified version of MAME, named &quot;MAME4RAGE2&quot;, making it able to emulate the game.

===&quot;Primal Rage: The Avatars&quot;===
When &quot;Primal Rage II&quot; was canceled, Atari allegedly deemed it necessary to somehow present the story for the sequel. Thus, in 1997, a novel called &quot;Primal Rage: The Avatars&quot;, written by John Vornholt, was published by Boulevard Books. The book tells what happened to the dinosaur gods 65 million years ago, and then moves into the main story of the gods&#x27; reign on Urth renewed, then the beast Necrosan appears. The book also focuses on fleshing out the world of &quot;Primal Rage&quot;, and does so by bringing &quot;the Avatars&quot; to the forefront of the story, they being the humans chosen by their respective gods to be their shamans or other titles of nobility.

Details to the backstory of &quot;Primal Rage&quot; are made clear in &quot;The Avatars&quot;. The events in &quot;Primal Rage&quot; take place in the year 1000 AC (After Cataclysm) or about the year 3000 AD by the Gregorian calendar. The battles of the dinosaur and ape gods are referred to as &quot;The Primal Rage&quot;. The spell used to imprison the ape and dinosaur gods is called the Bonds of Forbidding. Necrosan the skeletal dragon (who is referred to as Necronus on the introductory page) reactivates the Bonds of Forbidding to entrap the gods.

<text>Robert Baratheon is a fictional character in the &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series of epic fantasy novels by American author George R. R. Martin and its television adaptation &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, where he is portrayed by English actor Mark Addy.

Introduced in 1996&#x27;s &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;, Robert is the eldest son and heir of Lord Steffon Baratheon. He is a close friend to Ned Stark, and both of them were wards of Lord Jon Arryn. After his betrothed Lyanna Stark was allegedly kidnapped by Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, and Eddard&#x27;s father and brother were murdered by Rhaegar&#x27;s father, the &quot;Mad King&quot; Aerys II Targaryen, Robert, Ned, and Jon started a rebellion. After crushing the Targaryen dynasty and winning the war, during which Lyanna died, Robert took the Iron Throne. He married Tywin Lannister&#x27;s daughter, Cersei, to ensure political stability. Although Robert&#x27;s reign is relatively peaceful, he proves to be an ineffective ruler. He is unhappy in his marriage to Cersei, whom he abuses, and his responsibilities as king, and lives a life of infidelity and wanton excess. He fathers many bastards and is unaware that his three children with Cersei had been fathered by her twin brother Jaime Lannister.

Although Robert dies in the first novel, the legacy of his rebellion and reign continues to have a great impact on the contemporary events of Westeros. His death creates a power vacuum in which his brothers and Cersei&#x27;s eldest son, Joffrey, fight for control of the Seven Kingdoms while Robb Stark and Balon Greyjoy fight for secession, known as the War of Five Kings.

== Character background ==
Robert Baratheon was the oldest son and heir of Lord Steffon Baratheon and Lady Cassana Estermont. In his youth, he was the ward of Jon Arryn and was raised at the Eyrie alongside Eddard Stark, with whom he was closer than his brothers. When he was 16, his parents drowned and died during a storm, and he became the Lord of Storm&#x27;s End. He was betrothed to Ned&#x27;s younger sister Lyanna, with whom he was madly in love (and unrequitedly). After Lyanna disappeared with Rhaegar Targaryen and the execution of Eddard&#x27;s father, Rickard, and brother, Brandon Stark, King Aerys II called for Robert and Ned&#x27;s heads. Jon Arryn refused and began what is now called Robert&#x27;s Rebellion. Robert played a key role in the downfall of the Targaryen dynasty and killed Rhaegar in single combat. He married Cersei Lannister to ensure House Lannister&#x27;s support for his rule.

===Personality and description===
Robert is in his mid-thirties when the events of the books begin. Although being a quarter Targaryen (through his paternal grandmother Rhaelle), Robert has the classical Baratheon look: black hair and bright blue eyes, with dense black body hair on his chest and around his sex. He is a very tall man, with Eddard estimating his height to be . As a young adult, Robert was handsome, clean-shaven, strong and powerful, and muscled &quot;like a maiden&#x27;s fantasy&quot;. However, after he won the Iron Throne, Robert becomes very obese due to excessive feasting and drinking, gaining at least of weight, and turns into an often red-faced man with dark circles underneath his eyes and appears half-drunk and sweating when walking, with a wild, thick, fierce beard that hides his double chin.

In his youth, Robert is fearless in battle with a powerful voice, wielding a large spiked iron war hammer too heavy for Eddard Stark to lift, and was a formidable warrior well-loved by soldiers. Though headstrong, rash, and impatient, Robert can be merciful towards his enemies as long as they are honest and brave, and can inspire loyalty and friendship in even enemies via charisma alone. Although deconditioned after becoming king due to weight gain and frequent drinking, Jaime Lannister still believes that Robert is stronger than him.

Robert is a jovial man of huge appetites and knows to indulge in pleasures. He is quite promiscuous, having fathered multiple bastard children (16 according to the prophecy by Lannisport fortuneteller Maggy the Frog) with whores or any women he encounters, and his lusts are the subject of ribald drinking songs throughout the realms. As king, Robert is known to impose upon the hospitality (voluntarily or not) of his subjects, but at the same time also possesses a rather careless generosity. A proud man, Robert rarely backs down on words spoken in a drunken rant. As king, Robert is no longer used to someone disagreeing with him, which makes him vulnerable to manipulation by others. Robert loathes his responsibilities as king and frequently expresses his preference to winning the throne in battle rather than sitting on it. He has never truly loved his wife and is unaware that none of his three children with her are his, but instead Jaime Lannister&#x27;s. Under his reign, the realm has been bankrupted, and Robert is deeply in debt to his wife&#x27;s family. Tyrion Lannister considers Robert to be &quot;a great blustering oaf&quot;, while Varys describes him as a fool. His queen wife, Cersei Lannister, considers him to be an ignorant, dumb, slow-witted, drunken brute who does not have the ruthless streak she believes a king requires. According to Petyr Baelish, Robert is practised at closing his eyes to things he would rather not see.

== Storylines ==

Robert Baratheon is not a point of view character in the novels, so his actions are mainly witnessed and interpreted through the eyes of Ned Stark. He only appears in the first book of the series &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;, though he is mentioned numerous times in the later books by characters such as Cersei Lannister.

=== &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; ===

King Robert has come to Winterfell to appoint his close friend Eddard Stark the Hand of The King, after the untimely death of Jon Arryn. He was unaware that Cersei&#x27;s three children were fathered by her twin brother Jaime. More interested in food, drink, and tourneys than in governance, Robert has squandered the royal treasury, leaving the crown heavily in debt. After a hunting accident orchestrated by Cersei, Robert is mortally wounded by a wild boar and appoints Eddard as the regent for his son Joffrey. After Robert&#x27;s death, Eddard loses the political struggle against the Lannisters and is later publicly executed by beheading. The kingdoms plunge into civil war known as the War of the Five Kings (which encompasses the entirety of the following two books) in which Robert&#x27;s two brothers Renly and Stannis Baratheon both declare themselves the rightful kings. Eddard&#x27;s vengeful son Robb and later Balon Greyjoy also secede and declare kingships.

=== Family tree of House Baratheon ===
==TV adaptation==
Mark Addy plays Robert Baratheon in the television adaption of the book series. According to showrunners David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, Addy&#x27;s audition for the role was the best they had seen and he was the easiest actor to cast for the show. Brian Cox said he turned down the role because the &quot;money was not all that great&quot; and the character would be killed off early in the series.

=== Season 1 ===

Robert&#x27;s storyline is the same in the show as it is in the novels. However, his wife Cersei reveals that she had one stillborn son by him, which is not the case in the novels, where Cersei uses guile and trickery to prevent him from ever actually engaging in sexual intercourse with her while drunk.

=== Season 2 ===
After his death, Robert&#x27;s bastards are ordered to be killed by his heir Joffrey Baratheon, Robert&#x27;s supposed legal heir and the new king; Gendry, subsequently flees the capital.

=== Seasons 6 &amp; 7 ===
In seasons six and seven, Bran Stark&#x27;s gift of vision as the Three-Eyed Raven reveals to him the truth of Rhaegar and Lyanna&#x27;s relationship, that Lyanna willingly fled with Rhaegar and married him in secret, and states that &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rebellion was built on a lie,&quot; even though it was the Mad King&#x27;s crimes against House Stark that started the rebellion in the first place.

=== Season 8 ===
Following the Night King&#x27;s defeat and the destruction of the White Walkers and the army of the dead, Daenerys Targaryen legitimizes Gendry as Gendry Baratheon, naming him Robert&#x27;s lawful son and the new Lord of Storm&#x27;s End.

<doc id="1174916" wikidata="Q1435806" url="?curid=1174916" title="Isle of Mull Railway">
<text>The Isle of Mull Railway was a gauge line, long, which ran from the ferry terminal at Craignure to Torosay Castle, on the Isle of Mull in the Scottish Inner Hebrides. Originally it was known as the Mull and West Highland Railway (Mull and West Highland (Narrow Gauge) Railway Company Ltd). The line was marketed as Scotland&#x27;s original island passenger railway. The line opened in 1983 and closed in October 2010. A limited service operated over the 2011 Easter holiday and during summer 2011. The company&#x27;s lease expired in October 2011. The track was lifted in October 2012.

==History==

In 1975, the then-owner of Torosay Castle, David James decided to open the house and gardens to the public. Local businessman Graham Ellis, a railway enthusiast, suggested that a narrow-gauge railway might be the ideal way to transport visitors from the ferry terminal away, whilst also becoming a tourist attraction in its own right.

Although planning permission was granted in 1975, it was not until April 1982 that construction got under way. The line was completed in May 1983, with the first test run taking place on the 22nd of that month. The first experimental service started on 18 August 1983 with the official opening of the line taking place on 22 June the following year. Up to 2010, the line had carried over 25,000 passengers per annum.

In 2010, Torosay Castle was advertised for sale. Due to uncertainty over the future of the estate, the Mull and West Highland Narrow Gauge Railway Company announced the formal closure of the line on 28 October 2010 but some services were resumed for part of 2011 (see below). The company stated that it intended to investigate alternative sites that the railway could be relocated to.

On 4 December 2010, a special &quot;last day&quot; was held. Ferry company Caledonian MacBrayne supported the last day by offering a special ticket deal to Mull, and issued commemorative posters. The final train was driven by the line&#x27;s founders, Martin Eastwood and Graham Ellis. It was double headed by &quot;Lady of the Isles&quot; and &quot;Victoria&quot;, with &quot;Lady of the Isles&quot; bearing the &quot;Balamory Express&quot; headboard. Every carriage on the line was in the train.

The closure of the Isle of Mull Railway was described by the local Federation of Small Businesses tourism representative as &quot;a significant blow to the tourist economy, not just on the Isle of Mull but the mainland too&quot;. Chris James, the owner of Torosay Castle, commented upon the operators of the Isle of Mull Railway in a Scottish newspaper—that he had &quot;let them play trains for 30 years free of charge&quot;.

In 2011, it was reported that the sale of Torosay Castle was not to go ahead. The castle was to open on 45 days in 2011, against 245 previously. The reduction in opening days meant that it would not be viable to operate the railway, although the track remained &quot;in situ&quot; as of March. Locomotives &quot;Glen Auldyn&quot; and &quot;Lady of the Isles&quot; were reported to have been removed to the mainland for safe keeping.

A limited service operated over the Easter 2011 holiday and again from Friday 27 May 2011 until Thursday 1 September 2011. The final trains ran on 1 September 2011 hauled by the steam locomotive Victoria. 

Victoria was removed on 8 September to the Rudyard Lake Steam Railway in Staffordshire where she was used at their steam gala and she remains there as an often used and important locomotive in their fleet. 

A possible move of the whole railway to Balloch on Loch Lomond was reported in July 2011. The proposal was to lay the line on the trackbed of the former North Clyde Line between the former and stations, which closed in 1986. The line was to connect with the pier from where the paddle steamer will operate when she returns to service in 2013. As of July 2011, discussions were taking place between the owners of the Isle of Mull Railway and Scottish Enterprise about the plans to relocate the railway. A formal feasibility study was undertaken. Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park, the Loch Lomond Shores complex and West Dunbartonshire Council were consulted about the proposal, with the response described as &quot;very encouraging&quot;. However, the proposal failed to go ahead due to concerns that the rolling stock would have insufficient capacity to cater for number of passengers expected. The track is to be lifted and all assets of the railway will be sold.

The track was lifted in October 2012 and all of the track, rolling stock and some of the locomotives were bought by the Leek and Rudyard Railway which had been recently come under new management. Victoria, Glen Auldyn, Frances and Waverley are all still at Rudyard with Frances being the most frequently used diesel. 

All 4 locomotives are run together to celebrate the history of the Isle Of Mull Railway once a year with the Isle of Mull Gala. Unfortunately, the Lady of the Isles did not go with the rest of the locos to Rudyard as she is privately owned.

==Stations==
* Craignure 
* Torosay Castle 

==Locomotives==
There were six locomotives on the line.

===Steam===
*Lady of the Isles 2-6-4T built 1981. Was used on the Suffolk Miniature Railway at Kessingland, Suffolk before entering service on the Isle of Mull Railway. This engine was inspired by another Roger Marsh locomotive, &quot;Trevithick&quot; now on the Royal Victoria Railway.
* Victoria 2-6-2T built by Mouse Boiler Works in 1993. Based on the Victorian Railways NA class locomotives built by Baldwin, examples of which are preserved on the Puffing Billy Railway, Australia.
* Waverley 4-4-2 built by David Curwen in 1948. Was originally named &quot;Black Prince&quot; and originally used on a railway in Weymouth, Dorset. Waverley has been based at Rudyard Lake Steam Railway, in Staffordshire since 2003, on permanent loan, and has been repainted apple green

===Diesel===
* Frances, BB wheel arrangement. built 1999 by Mouse Boiler Works. Powered by a Perkins 1000 diesel engine, hydraulic transmission. Weight 2 tonnes.
* Glen Audlyn, BB wheel arrangement. Built on Mull by Bob Davies in 1986. Powered by a Perkins 4108 diesel engine from a Commer van. Hydraulic transmission. Rebuilt 2013 with a new engine and now also based at Rudyard Lake Steam Railway
* The Green Diesel, formerly operated at the Great Central Railway, Loughborough. Based on a Class 26 locomotive. Powered by a Morris Minor engine with mechanical transmission giving four forward and four reverse gears.

==Rolling stock==
There were 12 bogie coaches, three 4-wheel wagons and three ballast wagons.

==Television==
The Isle of Mull Railway featured in an episode of the second series of the CBeebies TV programme &quot;Balamory&quot;. Filming took place in the autumn of 2002.

<text>In computational complexity theory, SL (Symmetric Logspace or Sym-L) is the complexity class of problems log-space reducible to USTCON (&quot;undirected s-t connectivity&quot;), which is the problem of determining whether there exists a path between two vertices in an undirected graph, otherwise described as the problem of determining whether two vertices are in the same connected component. This problem is also called the undirected reachability problem. It does not matter whether many-one reducibility or Turing reducibility is used. Although originally described in terms of symmetric Turing machines, that equivalent formulation is very complex, and the reducibility definition is what is used in practice.

USTCON is a special case of STCON (&quot;directed reachability&quot;), the problem of determining whether a directed path between two vertices in a directed graph exists, which is complete for NL. Because USTCON is SL-complete, most advances that impact USTCON have also impacted SL. Thus they are connected, and discussed together.

In October 2004 Omer Reingold showed that SL = [[L (complexity)|L]].

== Origin ==

SL was first defined in 1982 by Harry R. Lewis and Christos Papadimitriou, who were looking for a class in which to place USTCON, which until this time could, at best, be placed only in NL, despite seeming not to require nondeterminism. They defined the symmetric Turing machine, used it to define SL, showed that USTCON was complete for SL, and proved that
: formula_1
where L is the more well-known class of problems solvable by an ordinary deterministic Turing machine in logarithmic space, and NL is the class of problems solvable by nondeterministic Turing machines in logarithmic space. The result of Reingold, discussed later, shows that in fact, when limited to log space, the symmetric Turing machine is equivalent in power to the deterministic Turing machine.

== Complete problems ==

By definition, USTCON is complete for SL (all problems in SL reduce to it, including itself). Many more interesting complete problems were found, most by reducing directly or indirectly from USTCON, and a compendium of them was made by Àlvarez and Greenlaw. Many of the problems are graph theory problems on undirected graphs. Some of the simplest and most important SL-complete problems they describe include:
* USTCON
* Simulation of symmetric Turing machines: does an STM accept a given input in a certain space, given in unary?
* Vertex-disjoint paths: are there &quot;k&quot; paths between two vertices, sharing vertices only at the endpoints? (a generalization of USTCON, equivalent to asking whether a graph is &quot;k&quot;-connected)
* Is a given graph a bipartite graph, or equivalently, does it have a graph coloring using 2 colors?
* Do two undirected graphs have the same number of connected components?
* Does a graph have an even number of connected components?
* Given a graph, is there a cycle containing a given edge?
* Do the spanning forests of two graphs have the same number of edges?
* Given a graph where all its edges have distinct weights, is a given edge in the minimum weight spanning forest?
* Exclusive or 2-satisfiability: given a formula requiring that formula_2 or formula_3 hold for a number of pairs of variables formula_4, is there an assignment to the variables that makes it true?

The complements of all these problems are in SL as well, since, as we will see, SL is closed under complement.

From the fact that L = SL, it follows that many more problems are SL-complete with respect to log-space reductions: every non-trivial problem in L or in SL is SL-complete; moreover, even if the reductions are in some smaller class than L, L-completeness is equivalent to SL-completeness. In this sense this class has become somewhat trivial.

== Important results ==
There are well-known classical algorithms such as depth-first search and breadth-first search which solve USTCON in linear time and space. Their existence, shown long before SL was defined, proves that SL is contained in P. It&#x27;s also not difficult to show that USTCON, and so SL, is in NL, since we can just nondeterministically guess at each vertex which vertex to visit next in order to discover a path if one exists.

The first nontrivial result for SL, however, was Savitch&#x27;s theorem, proved in 1970, which provided an algorithm that solves USTCON in log2 &quot;n&quot; space. Unlike depth-first search, however, this algorithm is impractical for most applications because of its potentially superpolynomial running time. One consequence of this is that USTCON, and so SL, is in . (Actually, Savitch&#x27;s theorem gives the stronger result that NL is in .)

Although there were no (uniform) &quot;deterministic&quot; space improvements on Savitch&#x27;s algorithm for 22 years, a highly practical probabilistic log-space algorithm was found in 1979 by Aleliunas et al.: simply start at one vertex and perform a random walk until you find the other one (then accept) or until time has passed (then reject). False rejections are made with a small bounded probability that shrinks exponentially the longer the random walk is continued. This showed that SL is contained in RLP, the class of problems solvable in polynomial time and logarithmic space with probabilistic machines that reject incorrectly less than 1/3 of the time. By replacing the random walk by a universal traversal sequence, Aleliunas et al. also showed that SL is contained in L/poly, a non-uniform complexity class of the problems solvable deterministically in logarithmic space with polynomial advice.

In 1989, Borodin et al. strengthened this result by showing that the complement of USTCON, determining whether two vertices are in different connected components, is also in RLP. This placed USTCON, and SL, in co-RLP and in the intersection of RLP and co-RLP, which is ZPLP, the class of problems which have log-space, expected polynomial-time, no-error randomized algorithms.

In 1992, Nisan, Szemerédi, and Wigderson finally found a new deterministic algorithm to solve USTCON using only log1.5 &quot;n&quot; space. This was improved slightly, but there would be no more significant gains until Reingold.

In 1995, Nisan and Ta-Shma showed the surprising result that SL is closed under complement, which at the time was believed by many to be false; that is, SL = co-SL. Equivalently, if a problem can be solved by reducing it to a graph and asking if two vertices are in the &quot;same&quot; component, it can also be solved by reducing it to another graph and asking if two vertices are in &quot;different&quot; components. However, Reingold&#x27;s paper would later make this result redundant.

One of the most important corollaries of SL = co-SL is that LSL = SL; that is, a deterministic, log-space machine with an oracle for SL can solve problems in SL (trivially) but cannot solve any other problems. This means it does not matter whether we use Turing reducibility or many-one reducibility to show a problem is in SL; they are equivalent.

In 2004, a breakthrough paper by Omer Reingold showed that USTCON is in fact in L. This paper used expander graphs to guide the search through the input graph. Since USTCON is SL-complete, Reingold&#x27;s result implies that SL = L, essentially eliminating the usefulness of consideration of SL as a separate class. A few weeks later, graduate student Vladimir Trifonov showed that USTCON could be solved deterministically using formula_5 space—a weaker result—using different techniques. There has not been substantial effort into turning Reingold&#x27;s algorithm for USTCON into a practical formulation. It is explicit in his paper (and those leading up to it) that they are primarily concerned with asymptotics; as a result, the algorithm he describes would actually take formula_6 memory, and formula_7 time. This means that even for formula_8, the algorithm would require more memory than contained on all computers in the world (a kiloexaexaexabyte).

==Consequences of L = SL ==

The collapse of L and SL has a number of significant consequences. Most obviously, all SL-complete problems are now in L, and can be gainfully employed in the design of deterministic log-space and polylogarithmic-space algorithms. In particular, we have a new set of tools to use in log-space reductions. It is also now known that a problem is in L if and only if it is log-space reducible to USTCON.

<text>Armenia () is the capital of Quindío Department in the South American country of Colombia. Armenia is a medium-sized city and part of the &quot;coffee axis&quot; along with Pereira and Manizales. It is one of the main centers of the national economy and of the Colombian coffee growing axis. As a result, the historic center of Armenia was named as part of the &quot;Coffee Cultural Landscape&quot; of UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2011.

== History ==
The city was founded on October 14, 1889, by Jesús María Ocampo, also known as &quot;Tigrero&quot; (translates to &quot;tiger killer&quot;) due to his love of hunting jaguars, known locally as tigers. Ocampo came from Anaime, Tolima, looking for shelter in the mountains of Quindío. He paid one hundred pesos in gold coins to Antonio Herrera for the land on which to build a fonda, or trade center, not only for himself but also for other colonists who came from Salento, Antioquia, Manizales, and areas surrounding the Quindío River and La Vieja River. Ocampo then proceeded to sell land for settlement. To encourage settlement, Ocampo returned to Anaime to ask for the help of his friend Juan de la Cruz Cardona and to marry thirteen-year-old Arsenia Cardona.

In August 1890, six months after its founding, Armenia had reached a population of 100 people, allowing it to gain legal recognition by the government. In the founding meeting of the city, on October 14, 1889, the name of Villa Holguín was suggested, in honor of Carlos Holguín Mallarino, the then-current president of the country. However, the proposal was rejected, and the name Armenia was put to a vote and approved on November 30, 1889. Therefore, the belief that the name was changed to Armenia after the country of the same name, in memory of the Armenian people murdered by the Ottoman Turks in the Hamidian massacres of 1894–97 and later the Armenian genocide of 1915–23 is unsubstantiated, as the murders happened years after the town was already named, although some sources do dispute this. While other sources claim that it is most likely that the city was renamed after the historical Kingdom of Armenia, rumours persist of being named for Armenia or Armenians in memory of the Hamidian Massacres. It is more probable that colonists in those countries took to the Bible in some cases in naming their settlements.

Despite Armenia&#x27;s quickly expanding economy at the time, the means of transport were still very limited. The main form of transporting people and merchandise was by mule, due to the mountainous terrain surrounding the city. It was not until the construction of the first asphalt road—in 1927 to Zarzal in the Department of Valle del Cauca—that transport was improved.

=== 1999 earthquake ===
On January 25, 1999, a 6.2 earthquake occurred in Quindío. The epicenter was located 17 km south of Armenia. The earthquake was one of the most devastating events to have occurred in Colombia in recent history, with an estimated 1,900 casualties. The earthquake was also felt in Risaralda, Valle Del Cauca, Tolima, Antioquia, and Cundinamarca, but Armenia was the hardest-hit city. In just 15 years, the city was rebuilt, becoming one of the most visited tourist destinations in Colombia.

== Geography ==

The city of Armenia is located 290 kilometers west of Bogotá at a height of 1,483 m. Geographical coordinates, the following: 4.3270° north latitude 75.4120° west longitude.
It has an area of . It limits the north with the municipalities of Circasia and Salento, west to the town of Montenegro, east to the town of Calarcá and south with the municipality of La Tebaida.
Armenia is situated close to the center Cordillera about from the top of the line.
The climate of the city of Armenia is varied, the average temperature ranges between .

===Climate===

== Economy ==

Armenia is often referred to as &quot;Ciudad Milagro&quot; (Miracle City) due to its fast urban growth and development. The city center includes a nine block pedestrian walkway, lined by shops and restaurants, through the center of the city and connecting two of the city&#x27;s plazas. The local economy main trade is still based on the production of coffee, plantains, and bananas.
To the south of the city as it gets closer to sea level, the temperature favors not only Quindío&#x27;s agricultural economy, but a renewed tourist industry in the shape of villas for rent, theme parks, eco-hotels and family day leisure centers, not excluding all-time favorites like local cuisine restaurants, exhibition centers and country clubs specializing in fishing, tennis, golf, cart racing and other sports. Many traditional plantations still exist in the surrounding area and many offer bed and breakfast accommodation and &quot;ecotourism&quot; packages. The city has a modern international airport El Edén International Airport with daily links to Bogotá, Cartagena de Indias, Medellín, Panama City and Fort Lauderdale, which make the city a convenient choice for conferences, meetings, business and social events.

== Transport ==


Armenia is part of the program &quot;friendly cities&quot; which seeks to improve the quality and service in urban transport in major urban centers of the country.

The city of Armenia implements its program called strategic public transport system, which is a program that advances the town hall by Friendly Company, an industrial and commercial entity been created to manage project resources.

The Strategic Public Transport System comes from the national strategy Gracious Cities National Development Plan which aims to improve the provision of public transport in intermediate cities of less than 400,000 inhabitants. It results from a national urban transport program established in 3167 CONPES of May 23, 2002, and responds to the need to establish a system that structures and allow better management of the city.

Thanks to the union of the three main utilities urban city (Armenia Buses, Urban Transport and Cooburquin City Miracle), new company was formed transport operator in the city, called TINTO (Transporte Integrado Operador de Armenia, in English: Integrated Transport Operator of Armenia), showing its citizens a new image, coffee, icon of the city and the department.

&quot; Part of this information is taken from Armenia Friendly program, the website of the Strategic Public Transport System of Armenia.&quot;

El Edén International Airport is approximately 10 km from the city, on the road to the municipality La Tebaida.

== Tourism and folklore ==

The renewed tourist industry has activated the popularity of the city and its surrounding areas. The region&#x27;s northern area is the gateway to Los Nevados national park, where the highest peaks in central Colombia rise to perpetual snows at more than 4,500 metres. At the Quindío side of the foothills of this national park, lies the Cocora Valley, where the National Tree of Colombia, the wax palm grows, and whose municipality of Salento is a tourist destination known for its culinary delicacy (fried river trout), for its guadua crafts and furniture (the strong native bamboo cane), its art galleries and its position as a bohemian centre of regional artists. Tourists and hikers walk from here to reach the views of the park.

The county&#x27;s folklore is represented throughout events and traditions visible during most of its towns festivities to name a few:

The Yipao (Parade of Jeeps): After World War II Armenia was given imported general purpose Jeeps vehicles so that they may be used for the difficult paths. However, these old vehicles have been also adopted into a traditional parade carrying oversized loads of coffee, local agriculture products and people.

The Chapoleras beauty pageant, with costumes depicting the traditional coffee harvesting dress in the fashion of late 19th century, and the various dances, is known in the entire country.

Each fall, La Asociacion Quindiana de Orquideologia hosts an orchid show, open to the public. This includes local judging by Colombian judges and often international judging by the American Orchid Society.

== Art and handcrafts ==

This region was widely known in the country in the early 20th century for the production of storage receptacles made of the empty dried shell of the fruit of a local species of inedible bottle gourd, the &quot;Cuyabra&quot; or &quot;totumo&quot;, which gives the demonym of &quot;cuyabros&quot; to the people born in this city. Nowadays, they are no longer mass-produced for practical purposes as cheaper materials such as plastics displaced them from the market, but these traditional receptacles are still produced and hand-painted.

The Carriel is a traditional handbag leather handcraft symbolic of the paisa culture and the early antioquian colonisation. It is often used in the typical dances and parades, and its miniature version is sold to tourists as souvenir. The cabuya handicrafts are often seen.

The bamboo guadua is widely used in creation of art crafts, furniture and buildings.

== Education and sports ==

The main sports centre in the city is the Centenario Stadium, and the Coliseo del cafe (Armenia, Colombia). Where local sporting events can be seen, including national and international football tournaments and the local professional football club Deportes Quindío. Other sport events are golf, swimming, and cycling. The highly varied geography surrounding Armenia has helped create some of the greatest climbing cyclists in the world, many of whom compete internationally in events such as the Tour de France.

The local university in the city is the University of Quindío. Its campus is spotted in the north of the city, and it is the most important educational and research entity in the place and in the whole department.

The Quimbaya museum designed by Rogelio Salmona, offers a permanent display of pre-Columbian handcrafts, ceramic, and gold artpieces.

<doc id="1174930" wikidata="Q1135929" url="?curid=1174930" title="El Greco (album)">
<text>El Greco is a 1998 classical album by Greek electronic composer and artist Vangelis (1943 - 2022). The title is a reference to the man who inspired the composition, Dominikos Theotokópoulos (known as El Greco, &quot;The Greek&quot;; 1541–1614), the painter and sculptor of the Spanish Renaissance. It consists of ten long movements performed on electronic instruments.

==Overview==
This album is an expansion of an earlier album by Vangelis, &quot;Foros Timis Ston Greco&quot;. That album had been released in 1995, in a limited edition. For this general release, the track order was rearranged, three new tracks were added, and the album title was changed.

Vangelis composed and arranged the album, and performed all the instruments, accompanied by a choir conducted by Ivan Cassar. The music is in a Byzantine style yet sounding contemporary due to his use of synthesizers. Soprano Montserrat Caballé and tenor Konstantinos Paliatsaras make guest appearances on one movement each.

The album reached #66 in France and #74 in Germany. At the &quot;Billboard&quot; New Age Albums chart peaked at #9 position.

The image on the album is &quot;The Knight with His Hand on His Breast&quot; by El Greco.

<text>W. David Hager is an American physician with a medical board certification in obstetrics and gynecology. In the fall of 2002, Hager, a leading conservative Christian voice on women&#x27;s health and sexuality, was appointed to the Advisory Committee for Reproductive Health Drugs in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by U.S. President George W. Bush.

==Family life==
In 1970, Hager married Linda Carruth Davis, the daughter of a Methodist evangelist. Together they had three sons. David and Linda Hager&#x27;s marriage ended by divorce in 2002. In November 2002 Linda, herself a religious and political conservative, was remarried to James Davis, a United Methodist minister.

In 2003 Hager married Lexington physician Kathleen Martin; in 2007, Martin filed for divorce from Hager.

==Education and certification==
Hager in 1964 was graduated from Jessamine County High School in Nicholasville, Kentucky. Hager received his undergraduate degree from Asbury College where his father, Cornelius Hager, was the college president. Hager graduated from medical school at University of Kentucky in 1972, and completed an ob/gyn residency at University of Kentucky in 1976. Hager has been board certified in obstetrics and gynecology since 1978.

==Career==
Hager is a practicing gynecologist in Lexington, Kentucky. After completing his OB/GYN residency, Hager was a clinical research investigator for sexually transmitted diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta from 1976 to 1978. He had a faculty position at Emory University from 1976 to 1978, and has been a part-time &quot;professor&quot; at the University of Kentucky since 1978. (&quot;Though his resume describes Hager as a University of Kentucky professor, a university official says Hager&#x27;s appointment is part time and voluntary and involves working with interns at Lexington&#x27;s Central Baptist Hospital, not the university itself.&quot; Time citation below) His research interests include mastitis, post-operative infections, Group B Strep infections, and vaginitis. Hager was president of Infectious Disease Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology from 1996 to 1998. He was also named as one of the &quot;Best Doctors in America&quot; in both 1994 and 1996. Other present and past affiliations include, the Focus on the Family&#x27;s Physician Resource Council and the Christian Medical and Dental Society&#x27;s Physician Resource Council. Hager was previously a member of Asbury College&#x27;s board of trustees.

Additionally, President George W. Bush appointed Hager to serve on the Honorary Delegation to accompany him to Jerusalem for the celebration of the 60th anniversary of the State of Israel in May 2008.

==Controversy over FDA advisory committee appointment==
Hager&#x27;s appointment became more divisive when on May 6, 2004, the FDA rejected the December 16, 2003 Advisory Committee 23 to 4 vote to drop the prescription-only status of emergency contraception, and refused to approve the sale of Plan B over the counter.

First, &quot;The Nation&quot;, and then &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;Lexington Herald-Leader&quot; reported that Hager spoke at Asbury College in Wilmore, Kentucky, about his role in persuading the FDA to keep Plan B a prescription-only drug. Hager said, &quot;I was asked to write a minority opinion that was sent to the commissioner of the FDA. For only the second time in five decades, the FDA did not abide by its advisory committee opinion, and the measure was rejected.&quot;

Further concerns with his candidacy arose with his beliefs and medical assertions penned in the book &quot;Stress and The Woman&#x27;s Body&quot;, co-written with his ex-wife Linda Carruth-Davis. In the book, his writings emphasized the &quot;restorative power of Jesus Christ in one&#x27;s life&quot; and recommended specific Scripture readings and prayers for such ailments as headaches and premenstrual syndrome.

<doc id="1174959" wikidata="Q13576949" url="?curid=1174959" title="Kelso Dunes">
<text>Kelso Dunes, also known as the Kelso Dune Field, is the largest field of aeolian sand deposits in the Mojave Desert. The region is protected by the Mojave National Preserve and is located near the town of Baker, San Bernardino County, California, and the Preserve Visitor Center. The dune field covers and includes migrating dunes, vegetation-stabilized dunes, sand sheets, and sand ramps. The tallest dunes rise up to above the surrounding terrain.

==Geology==
The dunes are composed predominantly of light-colored quartz and feldspar, most likely eroded from the granitics of the San Bernardino Mountains to the southwest. Magnetite and amphibole can also be found, often accumulating at the dune crests.

Kelso Dunes represent part of a much larger sand transport system, which includes the nearby Devils Playground region. The composition and morphology of the sand grains indicate that most originated from the Mojave River sink near Afton Canyon, which lies to the west of the dunes&#x27; current location. The sand has accumulated at the southeastern end of the Soda Lake-Kelso basin, where the Granite Mountains and Providence Mountains form a barrier to prevailing winds. At present, only the area around the Mojave River sink and the westernmost parts of Devil&#x27;s Playground are receiving new sand through this system; sand is no longer accumulating at Kelso Dunes itself.

==Geography==
The Kelso Dunes are composed of five stacked sets of dunes, each set corresponding to a period of climate change over the last 25,000 years. During dry climate episodes, a decrease in stabilizing vegetation exposed surface sand to wind erosion, which ultimately brought the sand to the dunes (most of the eastern part of the Kelso dunes was formed when nearby Soda Lake and Silver Lake dried into their current playas). However, once the sand was emplaced, vegetation began to grow, locking much of it into place.

The Kelso Dunes are also notable for the phenomenon known as singing sand, or &quot;booming dunes&quot;. Enthusiasts sometimes climb to the top of the dunes and slide down slowly, generating a low-frequency rumble that can be both felt and heard. This effect has also been noted at the Eureka Dunes in California, Sand Mountain in Nevada, and the Booming Dunes in the Namib Desert of Africa. The booming is much more pronounced when the dunes are extremely dry.

==Access==
Kelso Dunes are closed to any vehicles, but are completely open to hikers. The trailhead is at the end of a three-mile (5 km) graded dirt road splitting from Kelbaker Road. This road can be accessed from both Interstate 15 (at Baker) and Interstate 40 (east of Barstow). The dunes themselves lie just southwest of the Kelso ghost town and the Park&#x27;s Visitor Center located in the historic Kelso Depot.

==Endemic Species==
Like many southern California dune systems, the Kelso dunes have a number of endemic animal species. The list includes at least ten species of insects, such as the Kelso giant sand treader cricket (&quot;Macrobaenetes kelsoensis&quot;), the Kelso Jerusalem cricket (&quot;Ammopelmatus kelsoensis&quot;), &quot;Rhaphiomidas tarsalis&quot; (a rare Mydas fly), and the Kelso shieldback katydid (&quot;Eremopedes kelsoensis&quot;).

Although not strictly endemic, several plant and reptile species are rare outside of these dunes. One example is the Mojave fringe-toed lizard (&quot;Uma scoparia&quot;), which is specialized in its ability to &quot;swim&quot; under sand.

<doc id="1174964" wikidata="Q1756507" url="?curid=1174964" title="Technological evolution">
<text>The term &quot;technological evolution&quot; captures explanations of technological change that draw on mechanisms from evolutionary biology. Evolutionary biology was originally described in &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; by Charles Darwin. In the style of this catchphrase, technological evolution can be used to describe the origin of new technologies.

==Combinatoric theory of technological change==

The combinatoric theory of technological change states that every technology always consists of simpler technologies, and a new technology is made of already existing technologies. One notion of this theory is that this interaction of technologies creates a network. All the technologies which interact to form a new technology can be thought of as complements, such as a screwdriver and a screw which by their interaction create the process of screwing a screw. This newly formed process of screwing a screw can be perceived as a technology itself and can therefore be represented by a new node in the network of technologies. The new technology itself can interact with other technologies to form a new technology again. As the process of combining existing technologies is repeated again and again, the network of technologies grows.

A described mechanism of technological change has been termed, “combinatorial evolution”. Others have called it, “technological recursion”.

Brian Arthur has elaborated how the theory is related to the mechanism of genetic recombination from evolutionary biology and in which aspects it differs.

==History of technological evolution==
Technological evolution is a theory of radical transformation of society through technological development. This theory originated with Czech philosopher Radovan Richta.

&quot;Mankind In Transition; A View of the Distant Past, the Present and the Far Future&quot;, Masefield Books, 1993. Technology (which Richta defines as &quot;a material entity created by the application of mental and physical effort to nature in order to achieve some value&quot;) evolves in three stages: tools, machine, automation. This evolution, he says, follows two trends:

The pre-technological period, in which other animal species remain today (aside from some avian and primate species) was a non-rational period of the early prehistoric man.

The emergence of technology, made possible by the development of the rational faculty, paved the way for the first stage: the tool. A tool provides a mechanical advantage in accomplishing a physical task, such as an arrow, plow, or hammer that augments physical labor to more efficiently achieve his objective. Later animal-powered tools such as the plow and the horse, increased the productivity of food production about tenfold over the technology of the hunter-gatherers. Tools allow one to do things impossible to accomplish with one&#x27;s body alone, such as seeing minute visual detail with a microscope, manipulating heavy objects with a pulley and cart, or carrying volumes of water in a bucket.

The second technological stage was the creation of the machine. A machine (a powered machine to be more precise) is a tool that substitutes part of or all of the element of human physical effort, requiring only the control of its functions. Machines became widespread with the industrial revolution, though windmills, a type of machine, are much older.

Examples of this include cars, trains, computers, and lights. Machines allow humans to tremendously exceed the limitations of their bodies. Putting a machine on the farm, a tractor, increased food productivity at least tenfold over the technology of the plow and the horse.

The third, and final stage of technological evolution is the automation. The automation is a machine that removes the element of human control with an automatic algorithm. Examples of machines that exhibit this characteristic are digital watches, automatic telephone switches, pacemakers, and computer programs.

Each of these three stages outline the introduction and development of the fundamental types of technology, and all three continue to be widely used today. A spear, a plow, a pen, a knife, a glove, and an optical microscope are all examples of tools.

<doc id="1174967" wikidata="Q19359499" url="?curid=1174967" title="Oberyn Martell">
<text>Oberyn Nymeros Martell, nicknamed the Red Viper, is a fictional character in the &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series of epic fantasy novels by American author George R. R. Martin and its television adaptation, &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, where he is portrayed by Chilean and American actor Pedro Pascal.

Introduced in 2000&#x27;s &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot;, Oberyn is the younger brother of Doran Martell, from the desert kingdom of Dorne. Unlike his sickly and pensive brother, Oberyn is notorious for both his dangerous and unpredictable nature and his affinity for poisons, for which he earned his nickname. He is subsequently sporadically mentioned in &quot;A Feast for Crows&quot; and &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot;. Since his brother is sickly, he travels to King&#x27;s Landing in order to claim the Dornish seat on the small council, as well as to seek vengeance for his sister Elia Martell&#x27;s death at the hands of Ser Gregor Clegane, whom he suspects acted directly on orders from Tywin Lannister.

== Character description ==
Oberyn Martell is the younger brother of Prince Doran Martell, the ruler of the southern principality of Dorne. He is a hotheaded, forceful, and lustful man with a quick wit and a barbed tongue. He is a formidable fighter whose &quot;legend was fearsome&quot; and is nicknamed the &quot;Red Viper&quot; due to his preference for red clothing, as well as the rumor of his use of poisoned weapons in duels. Tywin Lannister described Oberyn as &quot;always been half-mad&quot;; Oberyn&#x27;s brother Doran has described him as &quot;ever the viper&quot;, &quot;deadly, dangerous, unpredictable&quot;, and &quot;no man dared tread on him&quot;, and Oberyn himself admitted being a &quot;bloodthirsty man&quot;. Oberyn was also responsible for the crippling of Willas Tyrell, the heir of House Tyrell of Highgarden, during a joust, though Willas never blamed Oberyn for the accident and the two remained friends.

When Oberyn was no more than sixteen years old, he was found in bed with the paramour of old Lord Edgar Yronwood, who challenged Oberyn in a duel. The fight was only limited to drawing first blood and finished after both men took cuts, but Oberyn soon recovered while Lord Yronwood died of a festered wound, and it was rumored that Oberyn used a poisoned blade. In order to make peace with House Yronwood, Doran sent his own son Quentyn Martell to Yronwood as a ward and had Oberyn sent away to Oldtown and then overseas to Lys in temporary exile. Afterward, Oberyn traveled the world, served in the famous sellsword company Second Sons before founding a company of his own, and briefly studied poisons and dark arts as a novice at the Citadel, managing to obtain six links of the maester&#x27;s chain before quitting due to boredom. He is bisexual and has eight illegitimate daughters, collectively known as the &quot;Sand Snakes&quot;. He was very close to his older sister Elia and consequently seeks revenge upon Ser Gregor Clegane for her death.

== Storylines ==
=== Books ===

Oberyn Martell is not a point of view character in the novels, and his actions are witnessed directly and interpreted through the eyes of Tyrion Lannister in the third book, and is later mentioned via the viewpoints of his niece Arianne Martell and the Norvosi captain of his brother Doran&#x27;s royal guard Areo Hotah in the fourth and fifth books.

==== &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot; ==== 
Oberyn leads a Dornish envoy to King&#x27;s Landing to claim the seat on the small council on Prince Doran&#x27;s behalf and obtain justice for his sister Elia Martell&#x27;s murderer, as was agreed with then acting Hand of the King, Tyrion Lannister, who is now relegated to the master of coins. When Tyrion is accused of murdering King Joffrey Baratheon, Oberyn volunteers to champion for Tyrion in the trial by combat, so he can fight and seek revenge from the rival champion, Ser Gregor Clegane, who is Elia&#x27;s murderer. Though Oberyn manages to gain the upper hand in the duel and impale Clegane to the ground with his spear, Clegane manages to surprise him by foot sweeping him to the ground and bear-hugging him, then gouging his eyes and finally killing him by repeatedly smashing his unarmored face (Oberyn is wearing a light visorless halfhelm) with a mailed fist. However, it is later revealed that Oberyn has coated his spear in manticore venom to ensure that Clegane will die a slow and agonizing death.

==== &quot;A Feast for Crows&quot; and &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot; ====
When news of Oberyn&#x27;s death reaches Dorne, the oldest three Sand Snakes Obara, Nymeria and Tyene unsuccessfully attempt to pressure Prince Doran into declaring war against the Iron Throne. Doran&#x27;s estranged daughter Arianne then conspires with her three cousins to instate Princess Myrcella as queen and create a war of succession against King Tommen and House Lannister, but their plan is foiled by Doran and they are all arrested by Areo Hotah. Doran later reveals to Arianne that Oberyn has actually been acting as Doran&#x27;s enforcer all along to carry out his secret grand plan for House Lannister&#x27;s downfall. The three Sand Snakes are later also told about the plan, released after swearing allegiance to Doran&#x27;s strategy, and assigned individual missions to infiltrate the Iron Throne as sleeper agents.

=== TV adaptation ===

Oberyn Martell is played by Chilean-American actor Pedro Pascal in the fourth season of the HBO television adaptation.

Oberyn arrives in King&#x27;s Landing with his paramour, Ellaria Sand, to attend Joffrey&#x27;s wedding in his brother&#x27;s stead, and his meeting with Tyrion makes it clear that he has actually come to take revenge against the Lannisters for their role in the deaths of his sister, nephew and niece. At the wedding, Joffrey dies after being poisoned, and Tywin initially suspects Oberyn of having a hand in the murder since Oberyn has a past with poison chemistry, while Oberyn denies involvement and accuses Tywin of ordering Gregor Clegane to rape and murder Elia. The two reach a settlement when Tywin promises Oberyn a meeting with Clegane in exchange for Oberyn serving as one of the three judges at Tyrion&#x27;s trial. At the trial, Oberyn implies that he is not convinced of Tyrion&#x27;s guilt, and openly questions Cersei&#x27;s testimony and asks Shae why Tyrion would tell her about all of his plans to murder Joffrey if he was the perpetrator.

When Tyrion demands a trial by combat and Gregor Clegane is chosen as Cersei&#x27;s champion, Oberyn volunteers to fight for Tyrion, proclaiming that he will exact his vengeance, starting with Ser Gregor. Martell valiantly fights Clegane, his superior speed making up for Clegane&#x27;s size, and manages to wound him in the shoulder and the leg, flooring him. Refusing to kill him immediately, Oberyn furiously demands that Clegane admit to raping and killing Elia and her children, and that the order came from Tywin himself. Distracted for a moment, Oberyn is floored by Clegane, who – in a manner self-admittedly paraphrasing the murder of Elia – knocks out his teeth, straddles him and slowly gouges out his eyes, admitting to the rape and murder of Elia before crushing his skull. Tyrion is subsequently sentenced to death, but Oberyn&#x27;s objective of vengeance was not in vain, since his spear is revealed to have been laced with the deadly venom of the manticore, which later begins to kill Clegane. Qyburn is charged with reviving the dying knight and does, though Clegane is now reduced to a mute zombie of his former self. Years later, in a battle with his brother Sandor Clegane, Gregor Clegane attempts to use the same move that he used to kill Oberyn against his brother, however, The Hound stabs him in the head before he can finish and sacrifices himself to push The Mountain out the side of the crumbling building, with both of them falling to their deaths in the flames of a dragon.

<text>Naftaly Aronovich Frenkel (; 1883–1960) was a Soviet security officer and member of the Soviet secret police. Frenkel is best known for his role in the organisation of work in the Gulag, starting from the forced labor camp of the Solovetsky Islands, which is recognised as one of the earliest sites of the Gulag.

==Origins==
Naftaly Frenkel&#x27;s origins are uncertain. The given name Naftaly is of Hebrew origin, as are the roots of the patronymic Aronovich. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn called him a &quot;Turkish Jew born in Constantinople&quot;. Another described him as a &quot;Hungarian manufacturer&quot;. Yet another claimed that Frenkel came from Odessa. Yet more said he was from Austria, or the land of Israel. His prisoner registration card states clearly that he was born in Haifa, then part of the Ottoman Empire. From Haifa he made his way (perhaps via Odessa, perhaps via Austria-Hungary) to the Soviet Union where he described himself as a &#x27;merchant&#x27;.

Finnish communist Arvo Tuominen, who met Frenkel in 1933, claimed in his memoirs that Frenkel was related to the , a prominent Finnish-Swedish family of Germanic origins (see, for instance, Erik von Frenckell) and that he spoke Swedish.

==Arrest==
In 1923 he was arrested for &quot;illegally crossing borders&quot;, a label which covered smuggling or for being a merchant who was too successful for the Soviet Union to tolerate. He was sentenced to 10 years&#x27; hard labor at Solovki. The Solovetsky Islands, in the White Sea, came to be known as the &quot;first camp of the Gulag&quot;. Together the islands were known as &#x27;northern camps of special purpose&#x27;: &quot;Severnye lagerya osobogo naznacheniya&quot; or SLON. In Russian &quot;slon&quot; means &#x27;elephant&#x27;. &quot;The name was to become a source of humour, of irony and of menace.&quot;

==From prisoner to guard==
He rose rapidly from prisoner to staff member on the strength of his proposal to the camp administration that they link inmates&#x27; food rations to their rate of production, the proposal known as nourishment scale (шкала питания).

How exactly Frenkel transformed himself from prisoner to camp commander is also mysterious. The story goes that when he arrived at the camp he found shocking disorganisation and waste of resources (both human and material): he promptly wrote a precise description of what exactly was wrong with every one of the camp&#x27;s industries (including forestry, farming and brick-making). He placed the letter in the prisoners&#x27; &#x27;complaints box&#x27; whence it was sent, as a curiosity, to Genrikh Yagoda, the secret police bureaucrat who eventually became leader of the Cheka; it is said that Yagoda immediately demanded to meet with the letter&#x27;s author. Frenkel himself claimed that he was whisked off to Moscow to discuss his ideas with Joseph Stalin and Lazar Kaganovich, one of Stalin&#x27;s closest associates. Again, the truth is unclear: records show that Frenkel met Stalin in the 1930s and was protected by Stalin during the Party Great Purge years; however, no record extant has been found of any meeting in the 1920s.

What is clear is that Frenkel was promoted from prisoner to guard in a surprisingly short period, even by the chaotic standards of SLON: by November 1924, having been resident at the camp for less than a year, Frenkel&#x27;s early release was requested by the SLON administration; the request was finally granted in 1927. Meanwhile, the camp administration submitted regular reports to the OGPU about Frenkel in glowing terms:

&quot;in camp he conducted himself as such an exceptionally talented worker that he has won the confidence of the administration of SLON, and is treated with authority ... he is one of the rare, responsible workers.&quot;
==Commandant==
Frenkel emerged as one of the most influential Solovetsky commanders. His reputation is, however, controversial: Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn claims that Frenkel personally invented the notorious you-eat-as-you-work system, also known as the nourishment scale, which destroyed weaker prisoners in weeks and would later cause uncounted casualties; on the other hand, a wide range of Russian and Western historians dismiss the many stories of Frenkel&#x27;s omnipotence as legend. Journalist Anne Applebaum states, &quot;Even if Frenkel did not invent every aspect of the system, he did find a way to turn a prison camp into an &quot;apparently&quot; profitable economic institution, and he did so at a time, in a place, and in a manner which may well have brought that idea to the attention of Stalin.&quot;

Frenkel presided over the development of the nourishment scale, or the &quot;you-eat-as-you-work system&quot;, from a careless arrangement by which workers were sometimes &#x27;paid&#x27; with food into a very precise method of food distribution and prisoner organisation: he divided the SLON prisoners into (1) those deemed capable of heavy work, (2) those capable of light work and (3) invalids; each group received a different set of tasks and quotas to meet and were fed accordingly, with drastic differences between the prisoners&#x27; rations and their fate. Those deemed capable of heavy work were allotted 800 grams of bread and 80 grams of meat; invalids received half those amounts. In practice the system divided prisoners very rapidly into those who would survive and those who would perish.

Under Frenkel the nature of the work undertaken by SLON prisoners changed from such trifles as fur farming and the cultivation of exotic Arctic plants to road building and tree felling: the change in the nature of the work changed the nature of the camp and the regimes which SLON developed beyond the Solovetsky archipelago such as in the Arkhangelsk region of the Russian mainland, thousand of kilometres away from Solovetsky, to which Frenkel despatched prison labourers.

Frenkel ensured that everything that did not contribute to the camp&#x27;s economic productivity was discarded: all pretence of re-education was dropped; the camp&#x27;s journals and newspapers were closed; the distinction between those with criminal convictions and those convicted of counter-revolutionary crimes was dropped as both groups were set to work alongside one another simply as labourers; and the meetings of the camp&#x27;s Solovetsky Society for Local Lore were stopped although, to impress visiting dignitaries, the Solovetsky museum and theatre continued to exist. At the same time random cruelty inflicted by the captors on the captives decreased: such behaviour was now considered inappropriate in an institution which valued &quot;trudosposobnost&quot; - &#x27;the capacity to work&#x27; - above all.

Some remembered him as a dandy who had a good head for figures and, according to Maxim Gorky (who visited and approved Solovetsky Islands in June 1929) and others, a perfect memory.

Others hated and feared him: in 1927 the year of his early release, in one of the first foreign publications about the Solovetsky Islands, it was written by the French anti-communist Raymond Duguet that, &quot;thanks to his horribly insensitive initiatives, millions of unhappy people are overwhelmed by terrible labour, by atrocious suffering.&quot; He was accused in 1928 by his comrades in the Solovetsky Islands Communist Party cell of organising a personal network of spies &quot;so he knows everything about everybody earlier than everyone else.&quot;

==&quot;Kommersant&quot;==
Before his early release was granted, Frenkel had organised and then managed the &quot;Ekonomicheskaya kommercheskaya chast&quot;, the Economic-Commercial Department of SLON, through which he tried to make the Solovetsky camps not merely self-supporting in accordance with the concentration camp decrees but profitable with the result that they began to take work away from other state undertakings: an element of competition remained in the Soviet Union in the 1920s and Frenkel took advantage of this. With Frenkel running its Economic-Commercial Department, SLON had already outbid a civilian forestry undertaking and had won the right to fell of wood in Karelia. SLON had also become a shareholder in the Karelian Communal Bank, and was tendering for the construction of a road from Kem to the far northern city of Ukhta.

From the outset the Karelian local authorities had been unnerved by all of this activity, not least as they had initially opposed the creation of the camp altogether. The authorities&#x27; complaints grew louder as time went by: at a meeting to discuss SLON&#x27;s expansion, local authorities complained about the unfair access which SLON had to cheap labour which would put ordinary foresters out of work; at a subsequent meeting of the Karelian Council of People&#x27;s Commissars (being the government of the Karelian Republic) in February 1926 SLON was attacked for overcharging for the Kem to Ukhta road with the following summing up by an indignant Comrade Yuzhnev:

&quot;It has become clear [that] SLON is a &quot;kommersant&quot;, a merchant with large, grabbing hands, and that its basic goal is to make profits.&quot;
The authorities also complained about SLON&#x27;s special links with the OGPU which allowed SLON to disregard local laws and avoid paying money into the regional budget. Within the camp itself, few doubted that Frenkel was the architect of this alleged success: he was firmly identified with the commercialisation of the camp and hated for it; at an acrimonious meeting of the Solovetsky Communist Party in 1928 - so acrimonious that part of the meeting&#x27;s conclusions were deemed too secret to be kept in the archive - one camp commander Yashenko complained about the extent of the Economic-Commercial Department&#x27;s influence and went on to attack Frenkel, admitting that he hated Frenkel so much that he had contemplated murdering him:

&quot;a former prisoner who was freed after three years&#x27; work because at that time there were not enough people [guards] to work at the camp [...] when a rumour came round that he might leave, people were saying, &#x27;We can&#x27;t work without him.&#x27;&quot;

Others asked why Frenkel received priority service and cheap prices at SLON shops (one of which had been opened in Kem) as if he were the owner; yet more queried why SLON had become so commercialised that it neglected its other tasks: all re-educational work in the camp had ceased; prisoners were being held to unfair work standards; and when prisoners mutilated themselves in protest at the work norms their cases were not investigated.

Anne Applebaum wrote:&quot;The argument over the profitability, efficiency and fairness of prison labour was to continue for the next quarter-century [...] in the mid 1920s the Karelian local authorities were not winning [the argument] [... and] although as late as 1929, the camp was in fact running a deficit of 1.6 million roubles - quite possibly because OGPU stole from the till - Solovetsky&#x27;s supposed economic success was still trumpeted far and wide.&quot;
The perception that the Solovetsky camps under Frenkel were profitable was shared by Stalin: Stalin&#x27;s preference for prison labour over ordinary labor can be found in Stalin&#x27;s continuing interest throughout his life in the intimate details of camp administration.

==White Sea–Baltic Canal==
High-level approval of Frenkel&#x27;s methods quickly led to the duplication of his system around the country and then Frenkel was named chief of construction on the White Sea–Baltic Canal, the first major project of the Stalin-era Gulag and an extremely high post for a former prisoner. Frenkel managed the daily work on the White Sea–Baltic Canal from November 1931 until its completion. He used the same methods as he had in SLON as well as many of the same prisoner-slaves who were brought to the canal works from the Solovetsky camp.

==Later career==
In his later career, Frenkel was protected from arrest and possible execution by intervention at the very highest level. It is noteworthy that despite the deaths of nearly all of his former colleagues, Frenkel managed to remain alive. By 1937 Frenkel was head of BAMlag, the Baikal Amur Mainline railway camp, one of the most chaotic and lethal camps in the [Soviet] Far East, yet when 48 Trotskyists were arrested in BAMlag in 1938 he was not among them, although the camp newspaper openly accused him of sabotage. Frenkel&#x27;s case was mysteriously delayed in Moscow, seemingly by Stalin, leading the local BAMlag prosecutor to write to Soviet chief prosecutor Andrei Vyshinsky, &quot;I don&#x27;t understand why this investigation [into Frenkel] was placed under &#x27;special decree&#x27;, or from whom this &#x27;special decree&#x27; has come. If we don&#x27;t arrest Trotskyite-diversionist-spies, then whom should we be arresting?&quot;

During 1937-1947 Frenkel was head of the Chief Directorate of Railroad Construction (ГУЖДС) as a protégé of Lavrentiy Beria.

He was awarded the Order of Lenin three times (August 4, 1933, July 22, 1940, September 16, 1943).

On April 28, 1947, Frenkel was discharged from his duties for reasons of health, and was awarded a service pension.

==Later life==
By the mid-1950s, Frenkel was living a reclusive life in Moscow. His stepdaughter Tamara was the fiancée of Leonid Makhnach, son of Vladimir Makhnach, the former boss of the Mosgaz Trust which controlled Moscow&#x27;s gas supply, who returned to Moscow in June 1955, after 14 years in the Taishet labour camp. According to Leonid, after his return Vladimir &#x27;was a difficult character&#x27; and there were constant arguments between the two. Frenkel took a close interest in his stepdaughter&#x27;s fiancé. One night after an argument Vladimir struck Leonid on the face: Leonid left home and went to live at Frenkel&#x27;s house where he remained until his marriage to Tamara in 1958. In 2004, Leonid stated that after his break with Vladimir, Frenkel became the main paternal figure in his life. Opposed to the Khrushchev regime, Frenkel remained closely connected with the MGB which helped Leonid with his movie career and commissioned the first movie he directed, a propaganda piece on Soviet secret agents during the Cold War.

<text>Swinging Radio England (&quot;SRE&quot;) was a top 40 offshore commercial station billed as the &quot;World&#x27;s Most Powerful&quot; that operated from 3 May 1966 to 13 November 1966 from a ship in the North Sea, four and a half miles off Frinton-on-Sea, Essex, England. While the station was dubbed a pirate radio station, its operation took place within the law and its offices were in the West End of London. Its representation was by a company formed earlier in the year to represent in Europe the ABC radio and television stations of the United States.

Both the studio and the 50 kilowatt AM transmitter of Swinging Radio England were in two prefabricated rooms lowered into holds of the MV &quot;Olga Patricia&quot; (later renamed MV &quot;Laissez Faire&quot;), a World War II vessel built in the US as a supply ship. The station shared the studio and transmitter holds with a 50 kW AM sister station named Britain Radio billed as the &quot;Hallmark of Quality&quot; and broadcasting easy listening music.

==Origin of the station==
Swinging Radio England was the brainchild of Don Pierson who lived in Eastland, Texas, US. According to an interview by Dr. Eric Gilder with Don Pierson published by Sibiu University Press in Romania during 2001, Don Pierson got the idea following the success of his earlier venture called Wonderful Radio London.

Like Wonderful Radio London, its jingles were made by PAMS in Dallas, as part of &quot;The Jet Set&quot; series 27 originally made for WABC, New York. Its rapid fire bannerline news at 15 minutes past the hour was borrowed from WFUN in Miami. The on-air staff were known as boss jocks, although the offshore version only slightly resembled the style of KHJ in California which originated the name. (See footnote section below regarding Tommy Vance on KHJ in November 1965 and Radio Caroline South in January 1966.)

==Station transmitters and antenna==
Don Pierson delegated transmitter and antenna work to the LTV-Continental Electronics (CEMCO) company in Dallas, Texas, as a turn-key operation. Pierson had obtained advice from consulting radio engineer Bill Carr of Fort Worth, Texas, who had worked on the antenna construction of Wonderful Radio London. When Pierson began to run out of time getting the twin stations on the air due to difficulty in getting financial underwriters, he revised his plans. The project was divided into three: the ship; the stations and advertising. As a result, it was not until the beginning of 1966 that a final contract was completed with CEMCO. CEMCO relied on experience of similar work for agencies of the United States government. While Carr understood the necessity of working within the time and money available to commercial ventures, CEMCO were used to working on massive projects underwritten by governments where time delays and cost overruns were normal.

==Studios==
The studios for Swinging Radio England and Britain Radio were in adjoining rooms, and like the transmitters which were housed in a prefabricated building lowered into one of the holds of the ship, the two rooms were located in a similar building lowered into the second hold of the ship. When Don Pierson planned the station in 1965, his engineer Bill Carr suggested 665 kHz and 795 kHz or 815 kHz. By the end of November that year, Don Pierson had still been unable to finance either the purchase of a ship or the two offshore stations. By the time financial arrangements were completed, New Year 1966 had arrived and he decided to speed up the operation. This was divided into a ship purchase and a package purchase for both stations and the antenna to be designed, manufactured and installed by Continental Electronics.

Both studios were going to be automated using ideas that Pierson had planned for Wonderful Radio London. At that time, some stations in the US were using this method to program both easy listening and top forty formats because they required fewer staff, which in turn kept expense to a minimum. At the last moment Pierson was persuaded by one of the disc jockeys hired from nearby WFUN in South Miami to make a further purchase for the top forty station to install a Collins Radio control board and to staff the station with live announcers who would live on the ship. As a result, most of the automation for both stations was moved to the Britain Radio studio to create more space for the new board and equipment.

==Technical problems==
Among other suggestions by Bill Carr had been the erection of a 200-foot mast to which the transmitter signals would be shunt-fed to the top using a similar but higher placed method to the Wonderful Radio London ship station. On board ship at dock in Miami, CEMCO installed a second mast attached to the original to support a third outstretched triangular boom. At the end of that boom was a heavy insulator that hung down to provide attachment for a large swinging cable that stretched down to the transmitters below deck. This cable shunt-fed signals to the top of the mast from which radiating antennas were then attached.

When engineering on the mast was completed, Pierson doubted it could withstand the Atlantic crossing and North Sea weather. He was advised by Tom Danaher, who had designed the mast for Wonderful Radio London which Bill Carr had used for his antenna work, that the triangular boom of the CEMCO structure would fail due to heavy stress on it by the swinging shunt-fed cable. Just as predicted it came crashing to the deck two hours after the ship left port.

Carpenters had been hired at the last minute to construct sleeping arrangements for additional staff made necessary by the change from automation to live presentation. The Collins Radio board had been delivered at the last minute and was being wired at sea by Rick Crandall, one of the first hired by Pierson to program the stations. When the ship arrived in Europe it was incapable of transmitting programs due to delays caused by the unavailability of CEMCO staff.

Against advice from attorneys representing the CEMCO turn-key contract, Pierson chanced voiding the CEMCO contract by hiring a British engineer to get the stations on air with an improvised replacement antenna. When the engineer succeeded in getting SRE as the first station on the air, another problem emerged. Carr had suggested three frequencies for the antenna that he believed he would build, but Carr had cautioned that research needed to be carried out on their suitability in Europe. The attorney for the ship venture accused CEMCO of failing to conduct this research when it was discovered that when Swinging Radio England finally got on the air, its 845 kHz signal began clashing with an Italian state-owned radio station in Rome while both 795 kHz and 815 kHz were off-channel and too close to the 809 kHz frequency used by a BBC network in Scotland. When engineers enabled Britain Radio to begin broadcasting at the same time as SRE, it was because they had lowered the power of its transmitter and used a new but inferior frequency (1322 kHz/227 m). In order to resolve complaints from the Italian government about the SRE signal, SRE switched frequencies with Britain Radio. While Britain Radio was able to serve a large area, the reception of SRE was anything but that of the &quot;&quot;world&#x27;s most powerful&quot; and as a result SRE attracted little commercial support. Britain Radio received sustaining income from broadcasting &quot;The World Tomorrow&quot;&quot; program presented by Herbert W. Armstrong and Garner Ted Armstrong.

==Ownership and management==
Although the project was created by Don Pierson, financial management came to rest in Pierce Langford III of Wichita Falls, Texas, who also managed the political career of U.S. Senator John Tower who had taken interest in Swinging Radio England. Whether Tower, who climbed to the centre of U.S. Senate oversight of intelligence affairs. Ownership resided with investors in North and West Texas. These investors formed loyalties to various factions and this caused infighting when the venture turned into chaotic failure.

Advertising sales were assigned to William E. Vick of Amarillo, Texas under an exclusive contract. Vick, whose family were also investors in the venture, moved his family to London where he formed a British company called Peir Vick, Ltd. Vick leased offices above which he lived, at 32 Curzon Street in the Mayfair district of London. They were across the street from Radlon (Sales) at 17 Curzon Street which had a similar contract to represent Wonderful Radio London.

Vick entered two exclusive contracts with two British companies. The first went to Peter Rendall and Associates who handled public relations and parties to launch the stations. In turn Rendall introduced Radiovision Broadcasts International, (RBI), formed in January 1966 as a subsidiary of Pearl &amp; Dean whose reputation had been established by selling space on British cinema screens. The creation of RBI had been triggered by the intention of the ABC radio and television networks in the United States to expand the sale of their program and broadcasting interests in Britain and Europe. The ABC connection with British media had begun many years earlier when it entered into a relationship with Rupert Murdoch.

These moves coincided with continuing and intensive rumors that as a result of lobbying by prospective commercial radio interests culminating in the arrival of Radio Caroline and then Wonderful Radio London, the British Government was about to license two 50 kW commercial radio stations to be located in two different British cities. As late as December 1965 Pierson had been advised not to go ahead with his offshore stations but to seek these two licenses instead. A compromise was seen in the prefabrication of the CEMCO transmitters and studios which could be unloaded on land should such licenses be granted.

The engineering work never succeeded in making the offshore stations operational and RBI failed to sell enough advertising to make the venture profitable, while the public relations firm spent large sums promoting the stations. William Vick submitted an application to the GPO radio licensing authority for licenses to bring his offshore twin stations on land.

By late September 1966, Pierson was no longer involved in day-to-day operations and CEO William Vick had named Britain Radio&#x27;s program chief, Jack Curtiss of San Francisco, general manager of both stations. Curtiss&#x27; first assignment was to close Radio England and create a Dutch-language station to operate alongside Britain Radio. The move was to avoid the British Government&#x27;s impending &quot;Marine Broadcast Offences&quot; law that would outlaw pirate operations in the United Kingdom. Vick and Curtiss headed to Amsterdam to locate offices and hire Dutch-speaking deejays to staff the station which was called Radio Dolfijn (Radio Dolphin) after the initial notion of a &quot;Swinging Radio Holland&quot; had been advertised but dropped when the official station Radio Holland complained. The new station went on the air in mid-November 1966 and Radio England passed into history after a turbulent six months.

==Britain Radio and Radio 355==
Middle-of-the-road station Britain Radio, which had begun at the same time as Radio England, continued broadcasting until 22 February 1967. At about this time the antenna was damaged in a storm and the ship put into Amsterdam for repairs. Ted Allbeury, formerly of Radio 390, took over as managing director, renaming the station Radio 355, and his new company Carstead Advertising took over from Pier-Vick. Several Radio 390 presenters moved across with him. DJ Tony Windsor became programme director, having shortly left a similar position at Wonderful Radio London.

In July the station and its Dutch counterpart Radio 227 simulcast a live concert by guitarist José Feliciano; also that month, the ship radioed an SOS, claiming that a Dutch crewman had gone berserk and attacked the captain. The following day two Dutchmen were taken off the ship by its tender.

On 2 August it was announced that the station would close at midnight on 5 August. The final programme began at 10 PM and featured all of the DJs reminiscing, playing their favourite records and making their farewells. The last was Tony Windsor, who then introduced a short recorded speech by Allbeury in which he contrasted the freedom of the airwaves in the United States with state control in Europe. The final broadcast ended with the DJs singing along to Auld Lang Syne followed by the National Anthem. The programme having overrun, the transmitter finally went off the air at about 12:21 AM on 6 August.

One surviving recording of the closedown broadcast also includes a tribute to Radio 355 made a few minutes later on Wonderful Radio London by newsreader Paul Kaye, briefly interrupting John Peel&#x27;s Perfumed Garden programme.

==Noteworthy events==
Two major parties were thrown by Peter Rendall and Associates to introduce RBI to advertisers, second of being held at the London Hilton hotel and promoted in the press as &quot;The Party of the Year&quot;. This was followed by a nationwide live music tour called &quot;Swinging 66&quot; for which the headline act was the Small Faces.

Swinging Radio England made its arrival with the Mitch Miller recording of &quot;Yellow Rose of Texas&quot;. This was followed by the PAMS jingles, which resulted in their being copied, edited and rebroadcast by rival Radio Caroline South on their ship anchored close by the Olga Patricia. The same jingles, taken either from tapes of the test transmissions or from bootlegged PAMS demo tapes, ended up being used in edited form by almost all the other offshore pirates of the time. This included Radio London, despite the fact that it already used a PAMS set. Meanwhile, Radio England countered this by acquiring a new set of jingles from a smaller company, Spot Productions, and requiring that all their DJs talk over them to prevent them from being copied and reused.

The decision by Don Pierson to allow Ron O&#x27;Quinn as programme director to change the automated system to a live format was the most controversial. O&#x27;Quinn, who had been a disc jockey at WFUN, borrowed every kind of format he was familiar with in Georgia and Florida, to create a hybrid sound only ever heard in Europe. A key was naming the djs as &quot;Boss jocks&quot;, a term borrowed from KHJ on the West Coast of the US who were using it to give a brand form of delivery that replaced their former laid back air delivery. Even without appropriating the &quot;Boss radio&quot; brand SRE was anything but laid back. Everything had echo, was shouted, and had either a genuine southern US accent or English voices using transatlantic accents. Even its news style, which had been used WFUN and KBOX in Dallas, was full of buzzers, beeps, echo and full-throttle delivery. An example was the station identification announcement (which was also accompanied by a drum roll): &quot;This is &quot;SRE-Swinging Radio England. Broadcasting 4 miles off the Frinton Essex coast on 2-2-7 metres, 24 hours a day, in excess of 50,000 watts of power. SRE, first and foremost is BOSS!&quot; While British and Continental European teenagers were excited the station failed to pull in enough to interest advertisers and this coupled with technical problems gave SRE a short life. By November 1966 it was over.

Among &#x27;Boss jocks&#x27; on SRE were Rick Randall, Boom-Boom Branigan, Johnnie Walker (the only SRE stalwart to make it as far as the BBC&#x27;s &#x27;pirate buster&#x27;, Radio 1), and Larry Dean. Dean became a master of O&#x27;Quinn&#x27;s hybrid sound. Rick Randall has mused that perhaps Pierson had been right and that more polish, control and saving of expenses would have been achieved had Swinging Radio England been automated.

==Footnotes==
Ron O&#x27;Quinn was program director of SRE and he borrowed its style of presentation from stations he was familiar with. (A brief video interview with O&#x27;Quinn dating to 1966 is available on YouTube.) The term &quot;boss jock&quot; had begun with KHJ in Los Angeles. By 1965, Richard Hope-Weston who was born in Oxford, England in 1940, had arrived at KHJ in Los Angeles from KOL in Seattle where he had been broadcasting under the name of Rick West. A condition of employment at KHJ was that he changed his name to Tommy Vance, since the station had a jingle cut for that name. Vance arrived at the height of the British Invasion of the US music charts and his pronounced British accent told listeners that KHJ had both the music and the authentic accent. By November 1965 Vance was identifying KHJ as being in &quot;Boss Angeles&quot; on &quot;boss radio&quot; with &quot;much more music&quot;, the last expressions used repeatedly by SRE the following year. When Vance received notice that he was likely to be drafted into the U.S. army he returned to the U.K. and by January 1966 was broadcasting on Radio Caroline South with a pronounced transatlantic accent to demonstrate to British listeners his American roots. At that time SRE was months from coming on the air. (See External Links below for examples of Vance on KHJ as a British boss jock, and on Radio Caroline South as a transatlantic disc jockey.)

SRE was followed by two Dutch language stations occupying the same wavelength between 1966 and July 1967, Radio Dolfijn and Radio 227, the latter changed format towards the end.

An example of a functioning automated top 40 station using the same PAMS jingles series 27 as SRE, but minus the &quot;boss jocks&quot; and shock news delivery, was WGNE and in 1971 it was still using this format from the Signal Hill Country Club in the city of Panama City Beach, Florida. WGNE was run by three adults and a teenager, one adult managing the station and two adults recording programs and selling commercials. The automation was similar to that aboard the Olga Patricia for Britain Radio.

Swinging Radio England was billed on its letterhead as &quot;World&#x27;s Most Powerful&quot;, a slogan used extensively by LTV-Continental Electronics in its brochures to describe many of its high-power company transmission applications for the Voice of America and U.S. Navy. Continental Electronics intended to provide Pierson with two 50,000-watt transmitters using a common mast to support two antennas and a combining system that could create one offshore station with 100,000 watts. Although Radio Caroline (which returned to the air under new management following the demise of the original Caroline Network company of the 1960s), offered two AM stations and one shortwave station in the 1980s from one ship, the power of these stations did not match the potential of the stations aboard the Olga Patricia of 1966. Radio Northsea International was theoretically capable of broadcasting with 105,000 watts of power on MW (with additional SW and FM frequencies).

==The maritime history of the MV Olga Patricia==
The ship&#x27;s history sees her with the name of &quot;Olga Patricia&quot; and then &quot;Laissez Faire&quot; configured as a &quot;pirate&quot; radio ship off Frinton, Essex in the United Kingdom housing 5 different radio stations from May 3, 1966 until August 5, 1967, then US court cases. Following a 1970s Miami court verdict, &quot;Laissez Faire&quot; was awarded to Pierce Langford III. A confusing history then begins because its former name and history have been switched in Lloyds Registry to that of &quot;Olga Princess&quot;. There were allegations of clandestine use from 1971 in the Caribbean with the name of &quot;Akuarius II&quot;. At any rate, by 1973 the ship had been sold and converted to a menhaden vessel and was named the &quot;Earl J. Conrad Junior&quot; operating for what is now the Omega Protein company. Earlier owned by the Zapata companies which in the 1990s announced plans to turn a new Internet service called &quot;ZAP!&quot; into a bigger company than Yahoo!. Zapata had ties to George H. W. Bush (former Central Intelligence Agency chief and U.S. President). The ship for many years operated with some sister ships in the Chesapeake Bay area menhaden fishery. It was scrapped in Mississippi 2011.

<doc id="1174974" wikidata="Q3536396" url="?curid=1174974" title="Traditional Values Coalition">
<text>The Traditional Values Coalition (TVC) was an American conservative Christian organization. It was founded in 1980 at Anaheim California by Rev. Louis P. Sheldon to oppose LGBT rights. Sheldon&#x27;s daughter, Andrea Sheldon Lafferty, was initially the executive director and presently (since 2011) serves as president.
TVC was influential in the 1980s and 1990s in lobbying for government policy based in Christian fundamentalism.

TVC was designated an anti-gay hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), citing TVC&#x27;s use of &quot;known falsehoods—claims about LGBT people that have been thoroughly discredited by scientific authorities—and repeated, groundless name-calling.&quot;

The SPLC reported that the Traditional Values Coalition may have effectively ceased to function as of 2018. It was still filing IRS forms as of 2019.

==History and organization==

Evangelical preacher Lou Sheldon was the California executive director of Anita Bryant&#x27;s 1977 anti-gay Save Our Children campaign. Sheldon started his own organization in the 1980s to carry on his anti-LGBT advocacy, initially named the American Liberties Institute, later the California Coalition for Traditional Values, and finally the Traditional Values Coalition.

In 1984 TVC organized parents to oppose Project 10, a Los Angeles School District stay-in-school program for LGBT youth. TVC continued to battle the LA School District into the 1990s, but gradually expanded into a national organization with a Washington, D.C. headquarters.

TVC created a video called &quot;Gay Rights/Special Rights&quot; in 1993. The widely-distributed video was a powerful tool in the anti-gay rights movement of the 1990s.

In the 1990s TVC claimed to represent over 43,000 Christian churches in the United States. Sheldon and his daughter Lafferty met with president US George W. Bush on eight occasions. TVC exerted considerable influence in the United States Congress in the 1990s.

Andrea Lafferty worked closely with her father at TVC from the late 1980s to the mid 2010s, becoming executive director by the year 2000 and gaining influence during the George W. Bush White House years from 2001 to 2008. Andrea Lafferty became president of the organization in 2011.

The organization was struggling to maintain relevance by the mid 2010s. In March 2018, the SPLC noted that the organization is &quot;a ghost of its former self, if it exists at all. Its website disappeared from the internet last year, and its phone line is disconnected&quot;.

Lou Sheldon died in 2020. At the time of his death, Sheldon was suing the organization he founded, claiming that &quot;TVC no longer functions as a legitimate lobby organization&quot; but instead conducts fraudulent fundraising to benefit Andrea Lafferty and her husband.

===Locations===

TVC maintained an office in Anaheim California where it was founded. A Washington, D.C. office, run by Andrea Lafferty, provided lobbying access to the federal government.

====Colorado====

Barbara Sheldon was the chairwoman of TVC&#x27;s Colorado branch. Sheldon complained that LGBT acceptance was &quot;raising doubts in children&#x27;s minds about religious prohibitions of homosexuality&quot; and organized opposition to protecting Colorado school students from homophobic bullying.

====Nebraska====
Cyndi Lamm was the director of the Nebraska branch. Lamm moved away from California, to Nebraska, in 1988 because TVC was unsuccessful in opposing LGBT rights in Los Angeles Schools. She believed that giving children information about homosexuality could cause them to become gay, and so chose to raise her family elsewhere.

===Video===

The video &quot;Gay Rights/Special Rights: Inside the Homosexual Agenda&quot; made by TVC in 1993 attempted to depict the 1993 March on Washington for Lesbian, Gay and Bi Equal Rights and Liberation as &quot;perverted&quot;. It contrasted the march unfavorably with the Civil Rights era March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom as an attempt drive a wedge between the LGBT and Black communities. The video was distributed widely to churches in America, in particular to African-American churches.

The video features Senator Trent Lott and William J. Bennett making anti-gay statements. Media scholars Linda Kintz and Julia Lesage describe the video as a &quot;titillating peepshow that conceals a battering ram&quot; against gay rights, and consider it a follow-up to the 1992 video &quot;The Gay Agenda&quot;.

==Policy positions==
In some ways, the aims of the group were those of a Christian right. It did not provide formal position statements but outlined the traditional values it was fighting for as follows:
# Right to life (against abortion and euthanasia but in favor of capital punishment)
# Sexual fidelity in marriage and abstinence before marriage
# Opposition to homosexuality and &quot;other deviant sexual behaviors&quot; (see below)
# Opposition to pornography
# Patriotism (supporting national boundaries, the armed forces, political participation, free enterprise, limited government, low taxes, and personal responsibility)
# Opposition to &quot;liberal&quot; immigration reform without first securing the U.S.-Mexico border
# Freedom for Christians&#x27; to attempt to convert non-Christians
# Cleanness from addictive behaviors (with opposition to gambling, the legalization of addictive drugs, alcohol, and smoking)

The group then explained in paragraphs titled &quot;Discrimination and Tolerance&quot; and &quot;Love and Hate&quot; how it aimed to deal with accusations that its activities were based on hatred of those not following similar beliefs. Without stating what action should be taken, the organization maintained that &quot;individuals may be free to pursue such behaviors as sodomy, but [that they] will not and cannot tolerate these behaviors.&quot; However, the TVC&#x27;s stances against homosexuality and the LGBT rights movement were, comparatively, more confrontational than those of many groups with similar views. There were a number of smaller groups that take a harder line, most notably Westboro Baptist Church, which the TVC criticized for many years, likening it to a false flag operation. The gap between the TVC and other conservative groups was described by Winnie Stachelberg of the pro-LGBT Human Rights Campaign as follows: &quot;They&#x27;re out there every day supporting discrimination against gay people on nearly every issue, and you don&#x27;t see that so much from other groups.&quot; The Coalition took this as a compliment. By comparison, Jerry Falwell stated in his later years, &quot;Civil rights for all Americans...gay, straight, et cetera, is not a liberal or a conservative value. It&#x27;s an American value that I would think that we pretty much all agree on.&quot;

The TVC suggested that homosexuals posed a threat of child molestation; claiming they &quot;have long sought unrestricted access to children for recruitment purposes&quot; and are more willing than others on the right to use the word sodomy in reference to gay men. Historically, the group at one time called for &quot;cities of refuge&quot; to keep AIDS patients from infecting the general population.

Lafferty&#x27;s response to a Gallup poll suggesting a tilt in public opinion towards gay rights was this: &quot;Jesus didn&#x27;t ask for a &#x27;show of hands&#x27; at the Sermon on the Mount. We, His followers, should not ask America to vote on which of his teachings they choose to obey.&quot;

==Hate group==
The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) enumerated false statements made by TVC, including the claim that gay people travel door-to-door to steal American children and transform them into homosexuals. The SPLC also notes that TVC has a history of Islamophobic statements. Because of this, SPLC classified TVC as a hate group beginning in 2008. The SPLC removed the designation in 2018 because the group appeared to be inactive or defunct.

==Christian Seniors Association==
The TVC operated a subsidiary under the name of &quot;Christian Seniors Association&quot; under the leadership of James Lafferty, the husband of Andrea Sheldon Lafferty. It aims to be a conservative alternative to the AARP. It attracted some attention for distributing financial appeals that are designed to be confused with census material.

==Jack Abramoff==
Louis Sheldon was an associate of Jack Abramoff, the Republican lobbyist jailed for influence peddling. Despite the group&#x27;s stated opposition to gambling, Sheldon lobbied members of the US Congress to kill the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act. Abramoff directed his client, eLottery, to pay $25,000 to the Traditional Values Coalition.

The group has also been linked to the Mariana Islands worker abuse scandal, as it was used by Abramoff to pay for the trip of Representative Bob Schaffer to visit the island. The &quot;Denver Post&quot; reported that the TVC paid the $13,000 travel bill for the trip organized by Abramoff&#x27;s lobbying firm.

Abramoff&#x27;s lobbying team would prepare questions and &quot;factual backup&quot; for friendly lawmakers. Trips to the island for congressmen and staff would be a key tool to &quot;build permanent friends&quot;, the memo said.

The congressional junkets to the Mariana Islands were designed to build support in Congress among Republican lawmakers to block labor and immigration legislation for the islands, which had been found to harbor squalid working conditions and abusive labor practices.

<doc id="1174976" wikidata="Q1508710" url="?curid=1174976" title="Aldermen Islands">
<text>The Aldermen Islands are a small group of rocky islets to the southeast of Mercury Bay in the North Island of New Zealand. They are located off the coast of the Coromandel Peninsula, east of the mouth of the Tairua River.

The islands were named &#x27;the Court of Aldermen&#x27; by Captain Cook and his crew on 3 November 1769 after previously naming Mayor Island. The Aldermen group consists of four main islands: Hongiora, Middle, Ruamahuanui, and Ruamahuaiti. The smaller islands include Big Hump, Little Hump, Nga Horo Island, Half Island and The Spire. Their combined area is . The islands are a forested nature reserve hosting rare species including the tuatara. Access is by permit only.

The Aldermen Islands are the remains of eroded Pliocene or Early Pleistocene lava domes that form part of the Whitianga Group. Approximately 18,000 years ago during the Last Glacial Maximum when sea levels were over 100 metres lower than present day levels, the islands were hilly features surrounded by a vast coastal plain. Sea levels began to rise 7,000 years ago, after which the islands separated from the rest of New Zealand. When sea levels were lower, the Tairua River flowed south of the features, travelling eastwards towards the Pacific Ocean.

== Archeology ==
The scholarly investigation into the evidence of past Maori occupation on the Aldermen Islands is thoroughly documented by Moore. This research integrates insights from a variety of historical accounts and field observations reported by different authors.

During the initial exploration of the Aldermen Islands, early observers such as Sladden and Falla, and Cochrane failed to identify visible signs of previous Maori habitation. However, the investigations conducted by Bell et al. during the years 1951-58 unveiled intriguing indications on both Ruamahuanui and Middle Island. Captain Cook&#x27;s historical report from 1769 attested to the islands being inhabited, and Wade&#x27;s observations in 1842, during a temporary sojourn on Ruamahuaiti, noted remnants of huts and an abundance of wild cabbage near Tuatara Bay.

The detailed description of the islands became available following the visit by Sladden and Falla (cit. opt.), and Cochrane&#x27;s subsequent visit in 1959 concluded that the vegetation appeared to be &quot;culturally unmodified.&quot; Nevertheless, earlier reports by Bell et al. and Falla hinted at evidence of firing on at least some of the islands.
The islands are home to a substantial population of Pterodroma macroptera (grey-faced petrel) and Sphenodon punctatus (tuatara), both known for constructing burrows. The combined impact of intensive burrowing, particularly evident in areas like Hongiora, along with controlled burning, is presumed to have played a pivotal role in effacing traces of an earlier Maori population.

A crucial component of this investigation includes archaeological site descriptions compiled during the Auckland University Field Club scientific camp in May 1972. Although these descriptions and accompanying sketch maps are concise due to time constraints and limited equipment, there remains a distinct possibility that additional sites exist on the islands.

=== Ruamahuanui ===
A singular recorded site (N45/1, refer to the figure in the article) aligns with Blackburn&#x27;s observation in 1958. This site features a small terrace, approximately 12 m by 6 m, situated 10 m above the beach, with stone walls on two sides. Evidence of shell midden is scattered across the terrace and extends higher up the gully.

=== Middle Island ===
Three recorded sites include N45/2, positioned on a southward-sloping ridge over 40 m above steep cliffs. Access to this site is possible via a steep gully or a narrow, treacherous ridge. Obsidian, shell, and fish bones were found scattered in the area. N45/3, a small terrace 5–6 m above the beach, reveals concentrations of shell midden. N45/4, the largest and most intriguing site, features stone retaining walls and terraces, suggesting potential use for cultivation.

=== Ruamahuaiti ===
Prominent terracing on this island (N45/5) consists of nine major levels located on the most northern ridge. This site reveals evidence of shell, fish bones, obsidian, and artifacts, indicating possible Archaic Maori occupation.

=== Hongiora ===
While no specific sites were recorded, two obsidian flakes were collected near a freshwater spring. The discussion incorporates evidence related to stonework, pits, shell middens, and vegetation on the islands. The proximity to Mayor Is., a significant source of obsidian, raises the possibility of the islands being used for temporary shelter or visitation by coastal-traveling parties. Moreover, historical accounts suggest frequent visits by mutton-birding parties, underscoring the islands&#x27; importance as a food source for early Maoris in the region.

<text>S-class ferries (also known as the Spirit class or Super ferries) are roll-on/roll-off (RORO) ferries operated by BC Ferries in British Columbia, Canada. They are the largest ferries in the BC Ferries fleet. The class comprises two ships, and , which were completed in 1993 and 1994 respectively. They serve the ferry route between Tsawwassen and Swartz Bay. In 2017, the class underwent conversion to a dual-fuel propulsion system that would allow them to use either marine diesel fuel or liquefied natural gas.

==Design and description==
The S-class roll on/roll off ferries are the largest vessels in the BC Ferries fleet. They are long overall and between perpendiculars with a beam of . The vessels have a displacement of , an initial and . The gross tonnage later increased to 21,935 for &quot;Spirit of Vancouver&quot; and 21,958 for &quot;Spirit of British Columbia&quot; as of 2018.

The vessels were initially powered by four MAN 6L40/54 diesel engines driving two shafts creating . The ferries have a maximum speed of . In 2018, the ferries began a mid-life refit that involved changing the propulsion system to a dual-fuel system comprising four Wärtsilä 34DF dual-fuel engines which allow the ships to use either marine diesel oil or liquefied natural gas to power the ship. Further changes include navigation and propulsion equipment, steering and evacuation systems, lighting and air conditioning. Passenger areas were upgraded including the lounges, bathrooms and retail areas.

The ferries have capacity for 2,100 passengers and crew and 358 automobiles. The ferries are equipped with lounges and cafes.

==History==

The two ferries, &quot;Spirit of British Columbia&quot; and &quot;Spirit of Vancouver Island&quot;, were constructed in two pieces. The ferries&#x27; foreparts were built by Allied Shipbuilders of North Vancouver, British Columbia. The rest of the ships were constructed by Integrated Ferry of Esquimalt, British Columbia. The two sections were joined and &quot;Spirit of British Columbia&quot; was completed in February 1993, with &quot;Spirit of Vancouver Island&quot; completed in February 1994. &quot;Spirit of British Columbia&quot; was assigned to the Tsawwassen–Swartz Bay route and &quot;Spirit of Vancouver Island&quot; to the inverse Swartz Bay–Tsawwassen route.

On September 14, 2000, &quot;Spirit of Vancouver Island&quot; collided with the &quot;Star Ruby&quot; while attempting to overtake the vessel in a narrow channel. The accident report found that pleasure craft had ignored all warnings of the impending collision. Two passengers aboard &quot;Star Ruby&quot; later died as a result of their injuries sustained by the collision. From 2005 to 2006, the S-class ferries underwent major refits.

In 2017, it was announced that the two S-class ferries would undergo a $140 million conversion to a dual-fuel system to allow the vessels to use liquefied natural gas as fuel in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Further modifications during the conversion included the replacement of navigation and propulsion systems and a general overhaul. Passenger areas were modified as well. &quot;Spirit of British Columbia&quot; was the first to undergo the conversion at the Remontowa Ship Repair Yard in Gdańsk, Poland, between 2017 and 2018. &quot;Spirit of Vancouver Island&quot;″s retrofit began in September 2018 and the vessel returned to service in April 2019. The conversion of &quot;Spirit of British Columbia&quot; earned BC Ferries the Shippax Retrofit Award, which identifies innovation in the ferry industry.

<text>The Sambyeolcho was a military unit of the Goryeo dynasty while the Ch&#x27;oe family held the reins of power as military dictators behind puppet kings. 

Meaning &quot;specially-selected troops&quot;, the Sambyeolcho originated from a unit called the Yabyeolcho (야별초, 夜別抄, Special Night Unit), which was established to prevent burglaries and to provide night time security in the capital. When additional units were subordinated to the Yabyeolcho, the new organization was divided into two main units, the Jwabyeolcho (좌별초, 左別抄), Special Unit of the Left, and the Ubyeolcho (우별초, 右別抄), the Special Unit of the Right. 

When a number of soldiers had been taken prisoner by the Mongols and then escaped, they were organized into a third force, the Sinuigun (신의군, 神義軍), and these three came to be known collectively as the Sambyeolcho. The Sambyeolcho performed both police and military functions but were elements of the private army of the Ch&#x27;oe family. Ch&#x27;oe U&#x27;s private armies superseded and replaced the royal armies. The Sambyeolcho together with the Dobang (도방, 都房) comprised the means by which the Ch&#x27;oe family military dictators projected their power after their military coup usurped the royal power. The Sambyeolcho were disbanded when the Ch&#x27;oe military regime collapsed.

The Sambyeolcho was an army with a strong public character in combat with the police, and its conductor has also been assigned a national official such as Doryeong. As a soldier and a military officer, it was easier to move around than other soldiers. The Sambyeolcho rose in rebellion in 1270 to protest against the strong ambition of the government. After establishing its own government and fighting for three years against the government and the won, it was destroyed by the Korean-Mongolian alliance in 1273.

<doc id="1174987" wikidata="Q559545" url="?curid=1174987" title="Alfred Sant">
<text>Alfred Sant, (born 28 February 1948) is a Maltese politician and a novelist. He led the Labour Party from 1992 to 2008 and served as Prime Minister of Malta between 1996 and 1998 and as Leader of the Opposition from 1992 to 1996 and from 1998 to 2008.
Sant is an established writer and playwright and has published several books.

== Biography ==
===Studies and career ===
Sant graduated from the University of Malta as Bachelor of Science in Physics and Mathematics in 1967 and as Master of Science in Physics in the following year. He studied public administration in 1970 at the &quot;Institut International d&#x27;Administration Publique&quot; of the École Nationale d&#x27;Administration (ENA) in Paris.

Sant served as second, and then first secretary at the Mission of Malta to the European Communities in Brussels between 1970 and 1975 when he resigned to undertake full-time studies in the USA. He completed a Master of Business Management (with honors) from Boston University Graduate School of Management in 1976 and graduated a Doctor of Business Administration from Harvard Business School in 1979.

Between 1977 and 1978 Sant served as advisor on general and financial management at the Ministry of Parastatal and People&#x27;s Industries in 1977–1978, and then as the managing director of Medina Consulting Group in 1978–1980. Sant returned to the public sector in 1980 as executive deputy chairman with the Malta Development Corporation. As of 1982 he started working as a private consultant.

Sant&#x27;s first political post with the Labour Party was as chair of its Department of Information (1982–92). During this time he also served as President of the Party (1984–88) and chaired the Guze Ellul Mercer Foundation of the Malta Labour Party and the General Workers&#x27; Union. He served a stint as the editor of the Party weekly &quot;Il-Ħelsien&quot; (1987–88).

In 1988–89, he chaired a party working group on the relations with the European Community, whose report was then published in English and Maltese. Another study by Sant, entitled &quot;Malta&#x27;s European Challenge&quot; , was published in 1995, and focused on the need for Malta to establish the best possible relations with the European Union compatible with Malta&#x27;s position at the centre of the Mediterranean.

Sant first stood for election in 1987; although he was unsuccessful, he was co-opted to Parliament later that year. In 1992, following the resignation of Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici, he was elected as party leader.

===Prime Minister in 1996-98===
The Labour Party won the October 1996 elections under Sant who campaigned for the removal of the Value Added Tax (VAT) that had been introduced in 1995 as an unpopular but required step towards EU accession. A year after taking office, the government replaced VAT by a similar indirect tax, the Customs and Excise Tax (CET). The government also froze Malta&#x27;s application for EU membership, which had been submitted by the previous Nationalist government.

Sant&#x27;s tenure as Prime Minister lasted only 22 months. Enjoying only a one-seat majority in Parliament, the Government was vulnerable to threats from former Prime Minister and Labour leader Dom Mintoff. Things came to a head in the summer of 1998 when a row with Mintoff over a coastal concession to a private company resulted in the Government being defeated on the motion transferring the land. Sant felt that the government&#x27;s parliamentary majority was compromised and asked the President to dissolve the House. In the subsequent snap elections held in September 1998 the Labour Party was defeated.

===2003 Referendum and election===
The Nationalist party, back in power, reactivated Malta&#x27;s EU membership bid. Alfred Sant stayed on as leader of the opposition and campaigned against Malta&#x27;s accession into the European Union.

In the run-up to the March 2003 referendum on EU accession, Sant was also critical of what he called a &quot;sham referendum&quot; insisting that a general election alone would settle the EU membership issue. He called on Labour supporters to either vote No, abstain or invalidate their vote. He himself abstained. 
The Yes side won the referendum by 54% with over 90% turnout - but Sant claimed that this was fewer than half of all eligible voters. On the basis of this &quot;puzzling&quot; interpretation, both sides were claiming victory in the streets. 
In view of the lack of consensus on the interpretation of the result, Prime Minister Eddie Fenech Adami asked the President to dissolve the Parliament and call for fresh elections. These were held in April 2003 and the Labour Party was again defeated at the polls.

Sant tendered his resignation as party leader. He did, however, stand for election for Party leader again which was contested by two other candidates for the post, John Attard Montalto and Angelo Farrugia. Sant was re-elected party leader with 66% of votes cast by Labour Party delegates and returned to lead the Party.

===2008 general election===
The Labour Party, spearheaded by Sant, presented a new programme &quot;Pjan għal bidu ġdid&quot; (Plan for a new beginning) and called for &quot;Bżonn ta&#x27; Bidla&quot; (The need for a Change) after the 20 years (save for his brief stint from 1996 to 1998) of Nationalist government. The electoral programme contained references to overhauls in the educational system (which proved to be extremely controversial), reduction of an electricity surcharge by half, and tax breaks on overtime work. 

At the 2008 Maltese general election Sant was defeated for the third consecutive time, this time by Lawrence Gonzi, on a slim margin of only 1,580 votes. Following the loss of the election, Sant resigned as leader of the Labour Party on 10 March 2008, and as Leader of the Opposition on 5 June 2008; he was succeeded as party leader by Joseph Muscat and as leader of the opposition by Charles Mangion. He retained his Parliamentary seat.

===2014 European Parliament election===
Sant announced that he would stand as a Labour Party candidate in the 2014 European Parliament election, despite his previous opposition to EU membership for Malta. He received 48,739 votes, which elected him outright, acquiring more votes than any other candidate. He was re-elected in 2019 but decided not to stand for re-election in 2024.

<doc id="1174994" wikidata="Q4752295" url="?curid=1174994" title="Anatomy of Criticism">
<text>Anatomy of Criticism: Four Essays (Princeton University Press, 1957) is a book by Canadian literary critic and theorist Northrop Frye that attempts to formulate an overall view of the scope, theory, principles, and techniques of literary criticism derived exclusively from literature. Frye consciously omits all specific and practical criticism, instead offering classically inspired theories of modes, symbols, myths and genres, in what he termed &quot;an interconnected group of suggestions.&quot; The literary approach proposed by Frye in &quot;Anatomy&quot; was highly influential in the decades before deconstructivist criticism and other expressions of postmodernism came to prominence in American academia circa 1980s.

Frye&#x27;s four essays are sandwiched between a &quot;Polemical Introduction&quot; and a &quot;Tentative Conclusion.&quot; The four essays are titled &quot;Historical Criticism: Theory of Modes&quot;, &quot;Ethical Criticism: Theory of Symbols&quot;, &quot;Archetypal Criticism: A Theory of Myths&quot;, and &quot;Rhetorical Criticism: Theory of Genres.&quot;

==Contents==
===Polemical introduction===
The purpose of the introduction is to defend the need for literary criticism, to distinguish the nature of genuine literary criticism from other forms of criticism, and to clarify the difference between direct experience of literature and the systematic study of literary criticism.

There are a number of reasons why the introduction is labeled as a &quot;polemic&quot;. In defending the need for literary criticism, Frye opposes a notion common to Tolstoy and Romantic thought that &quot;natural taste&quot; is superior to scholarly learning (and by extension, criticism). Frye also accuses a number of methods of criticism (e.g. Marxist, Freudian, Jungian, Neo-classical, etc.) as being embodiments of the deterministic fallacy. He is not opposed to these ideologies in particular, but sees the application of any external, ready-made ideology to literature as a departure from genuine criticism. This results in subjecting a work of literature to an individual&#x27;s pet philosophy and an elevation or demotion of authors according to their conformity to the pet philosophy.

Another point is to distinguish the difference between personal taste and genuine criticism. Personal taste is too easily swayed by the prevailing morals, values and tastes of the critic&#x27;s society at that point in history. If taste succumbs entirely to such social forces, the result is the same as that of consciously adopting an external ideology described above. Yet even if there is a consensus among critics that the works of John Milton are more fruitful than Richard Blackmore (to use Frye&#x27;s example), a critic contributes little by saying so. In other words, value judgments contribute little to meaningful criticism.

In place of meaningless criticism, Frye proposes a genuine literary criticism which draws its method from the body of literature itself. Literary criticism ought to be a systematic study of works of literature, just as physics is of nature and history is of human action. Frye makes the explicit assumption that in order for systematic study to be possible, the body of literature must already possess a systematic nature. Frye claims that we know very little about this system as yet and that the systematic study of literature has progressed little since Aristotle.

Frye concludes his introduction by addressing the weaknesses of his argument. He mentions that the introduction is a polemic, but written in first person to acknowledge the individual nature of his views. He concedes that the following essays can only give a preliminary, and likely inexact, glimpse of the system of literature. He admits to making sweeping generalities that will often prove false in light of particular examples. Finally, he stresses that while many feel an &quot;emotional repugnance&quot; to schematization of poetry, the schematization should be regarded as an aspect of criticism, not the vibrant, personal, direct experience of the work itself—much as the geologist turns away from his or her systematic work to enjoy the beauty of the mountains.

===&quot;Historical Criticism: Theory of Modes&quot;===

Frye&#x27;s systemization of literature begins with three aspects of poetry given by Aristotle in his &quot;Poetics&quot;: &quot;mythos&quot; (plot), &quot;ethos&quot; (characterization/setting), and &quot;dianoia&quot; (theme/idea). Frye sees works of literature as lying somewhere on a continuum between being plot driven, as in most fiction, and idea driven, as in essays and lyrical poetry. The first essay begins by exploring the different aspects of fiction (subdivided into tragic and comic) in each mode and ends with a similar discussion of thematic literature.

Frye divides his study of tragic, comic, and thematic literature into five &quot;modes&quot;, each identified with a specific literary epoch: mythic, romantic, high mimetic, low mimetic, and ironic. This categorization is a representation of &quot;ethos&quot;, or characterization and relates to how the protagonist is portrayed in respect to the rest of humanity and the protagonist&#x27;s environment. Frye suggests that Classical civilizations progressed historically through the development of these modes, and that something similar happened in Western civilization during medieval and modern times. He speculates that contemporary fiction may be undergoing a return to myth, completing a full circle through the five modes. Frye argues that when irony is pushed to extremes, it returns to the mode of myth; this concept of the &quot;recursion&quot; of historical cycles is familiar from Giambattista Vico and Oswald Spengler.

Tragedy is concerned with the hero&#x27;s separation from society.
*Mythic tragedy deals with the death of gods.
*Romantic tragedy features elegies mourning the death of heroes such as Arthur or Beowulf.
*High mimetic tragedy presents the death of a noble human such as Othello or Oedipus.
*Low mimetic tragedy shows the death or sacrifice of an ordinary human being and evokes pathos, as with Thomas Hardy&#x27;s Tess or Henry James&#x27;s Daisy Miller.
*The ironic mode often shows the death or suffering of a protagonist who is both weak and pitiful compared to the rest of humanity and the protagonist&#x27;s environment; Franz Kafka&#x27;s works provide many examples of such. At other times, the protagonist is not necessarily weaker than the average person yet suffers severe persecution at the hands of a deranged society. Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s Hester Prynne, and Hardy&#x27;s Tess exemplify this treatment.

Comedy is concerned with integration of society.
*Mythic comedy deals with acceptance into the society of gods, often through a number of trials as with Hercules or through salvation or assumption as in the Bible.
*In romantic comic modes, the setting is pastoral or idyllic, and there is an integration of the hero with an idealized simplified form of nature.
*High mimetic comedy involves a strong central protagonist who constructs his or her own society by brute force, fending off all opposition until the protagonist ends up with all honor and riches due him or her—the plays of Aristophanes or something like Shakespeare&#x27;s Prospero are examples.
*Low mimetic comedy often shows the social elevation of the hero or heroine and often ends in marriage.
*Ironic comedy is perhaps more difficult, and Frye devotes a good deal more space to this than the other comedic modes. At one extreme, ironic comedy borders on savagery, the inflicting of pain on a helpless victim. Some examples of this include tales of lynch mobs, murder mysteries, or human sacrifice. Yet ironic comedy may also offer biting satire of a society replete with snobbery. It may even depict a protagonist rejected by society (thus failing the typical comic reintegration) yet who appears wiser than the rejecting society. Aristophanes, Ben Jonson, Molière, Henry Fielding, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and Graham Greene offer examples of the wide range of ironic comic possibility.

Finally, Frye explores the nature of thematic literature in each mode. Here, the intellectual content is more important than the plot, so these modes are organized by what is considered more authoritative or educational at the time. Also, these modes tend to organize by societal structure.
*In the mythical mode scripture, literature claiming divine inspiration is prevalent.
*In the romantic, the gods have retreated to the sky and it is up to chroniclers in a nomadic society to remember the lists of names of the patriarchs, the proverbs, traditions, charms, deeds, etc.
*In the high mimetic mode society is structured around a capital city, and &quot;national&quot; epics such as &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; and &quot;The Lusiad&quot; are typical.
*In the low mimetic, thematic exposition tends toward individualism and romanticism. The individual author&#x27;s own thoughts and ideas are now the center of authority, as instanced by William Wordsworth&#x27;s &quot;Prelude&quot;.
*Finally, in the ironic mode, the poet figures as a mere observer rather than an authoritative commentator, producing writing that tends to emphasize discontinuity and anti-epiphany. T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land&quot; and James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; exemplify this thematic mode.

===&quot;Ethical Criticism: Theory of Symbols&quot;===
Now that Frye has established his theory of modes, he proposes five levels, or &quot;phases&quot;, of symbolism, each phase independently possessing its own &quot;mythos&quot;, ethos, and &quot;dianoia&quot; as laid out in the first essay. These phases are based on the four levels of medieval allegory (the first two phases constituting the first level). Also, Frye relates the five phases with the ages of man laid out in the first essay. Frye defines a literary symbol as: &quot;[A]ny unit of any literary structure that can be isolated for critical attention.&quot;

Symbolic phases:
* Literal/descriptive (motifs and signs)
* Formal (image)
* Mythical (archetype)
* Anagogic (monad)

The descriptive phase exhibits the centrifugal, or outward, property of a symbol. For example, when a word such as &#x27;cat&#x27; evokes a definition, image, experience or any property connected with the word &#x27;cat&#x27; external to the literary context of the particular usage, we have the word taken in the descriptive sense. Frye labels any such symbol a &quot;sign&quot;. He does not define the sign beyond this sense of pointing to the external, nor does he refer to any particular semiotic theory. In opposition to the sign stands the &quot;motif&quot; which is a symbol taken in the literal phase. This phase demonstrates the inward, or centripetal, direction of meaning, best described as the contextual meaning of the symbol. To Frye, &quot;literal&quot; means nearly the opposite of its usage in common speech; to say that something &quot;literally&quot; means something generally involves referring to a definition external to the text. Instead, &quot;literal&quot; refers to the symbol&#x27;s meaning in its specific literary situation while &quot;descriptive&quot; refers to personal connotation and conventional definition. Finally, Frye draws an analogy between rhythm and harmony with the literal and descriptive phases respectively. The literal phase tends to be horizontal, dependent on what comes before and after the symbol while the descriptive phase tends to be laid out in space, having external meanings that vary in nearness to the contextual meaning.

Frye next introduces the formal phase, embodied by the image, in order to define the layer of meaning that results from the interplay of the harmony and rhythm of the signs and motifs. The most frequently repeated imagery sets the tone of the work (as with the color red in &quot;Macbeth&quot;), with less repeated imagery working in contrast with this tonal background. This section of the essay gives a faithful representation of literary formalism (also known as New Criticism). Frye&#x27;s representation of formalism here is unique; however, its setting as part of the larger system of literary criticism Frye outlines in the entire work. The notion of form (and perhaps Frye&#x27;s literal phase) relies heavily on the assumption of inherent meaning within the text—a point contested by deconstructionist critics.

The mythical phase is the treatment of a symbol as an archetype. This concept relates most closely with intertextuality and considers the symbol in a work as interconnected with similar symbolism throughout the entire body of literature. While Frye deals with myths and archetypes from a broader perspective in the third essay, in this section he focuses on the critical method of tracing a symbol&#x27;s heritage through literary works both prior and subsequent to the work in question. Frye argues that convention is a vital part of literature and that copyright is harmful to the process of literary creation. Frye points to the use of convention in Shakespeare and Milton as examples to strengthen his argument that even verbatim copying of text and plot does not entail a death of creativity. Further, Frye argues that romantic, anti-conventional writers such as Walt Whitman tend to follow convention anyway. In criticism, the study of the archetypal phase of a symbol is akin to the &quot;nature&quot; perspective in the psychological debate over nature versus nurture. Rather than viewing the symbol as a unique achievement of the author or some inherent quality of the text, the archetypal phase situates the symbol in its society of literary kindred as a product of its conventional forebears.

Finally, Frye proposes an anagogic phase wherein a symbol is treated as a monad. The anagogic level of medieval allegory treated a text as expressing the highest spiritual meaning. For example, Dante&#x27;s Beatrice in the Divine Comedy would represent the bride of Christ, i.e., the Catholic Church. Frye makes the argument that not only is there a lateral connection of archetypes through intertextuality, but that there is a transcendent almost spiritual unity within the body of literature. Frye describes the anagogic in literature as &quot;the imitation of infinite social action and infinite human thought, the mind of a man who is all men, the universal creative word which is all words.&quot;

===&quot;Archetypal Criticism: Theory of Myths&quot;===
Frye begins the essay regarding myth as the source of all literature (as a visual, auditory and textual art form), paintings (as visual art form) and music (as an auditory art form). The underlying structures and patterns of all these forms are similar, though they have a unique style of their own. 

The third essay is the culmination of Frye&#x27;s theory in that it unites the elements of characterization and each of the five symbolic phases presented in the first two essays into an organic whole. This whole is organized around a metaphor of human desire and frustration as manifested in the Great Chain of Being (divine, human, animal, vegetable, mineral and water) by analogy to the four seasons.

At one pole we have apocalyptic imagery which typifies the revelation of heaven and ultimate of human desire. In this state, the literary structure points toward unification of all things in a single analogical symbol. The ultimate of the divine is the deity, of the human is Christ (or any other being that embodies the oneness of humanity in its spiritual culmination), of the animal is the lamb, of the vegetable is the Tree of Life or vine, and of the mineral is the heavenly Jerusalem or city of God.

At the opposite pole lies demonic imagery which typifies the unfulfillment, perversion, or opposition of human desire. In this state, things tend toward anarchy or tyranny. The divine is an angry, inscrutable God demanding sacrifice, the human is the tyrannical anti-Christ, the animal is a predator such as a lion, the vegetable is the evil wood as found at the beginning of Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot; or Hawthorne&#x27;s &quot;Young Goodman Brown&quot;, and the city is the dystopia embodied by Orwell&#x27;s &quot;1984&quot; or Kafka&#x27;s &quot;The Castle&quot;.

Finally we have the analogical imagery, or more simply, depictions of states that are similar to paradise or hell, but not identical. There is a great deal of variety in the imagery of these structures, but tame animals and wise rulers are common in structures analogical to the apocalyptic (analogy of innocence), while predatory aristocrats and masses living in squalor characterize analogy to the demonic (analogy of experience).

Frye then identifies the mythical mode with the apocalyptic, the ironic with the demonic, and the romantic and low mimetic with their respective analogies. The high mimetic, then, occupies the center of all four. This ordering allows Frye to place the modes in a circular structure and point to the cyclical nature of myth and archetypes. In this setting, literature represents the natural cycle of birth, growth, maturity, decline, death, resurrection, rebirth, and the repetition of the cycle. The remainder of the chapter deals with the cycle of the four seasons as embodied by four mythoi: comedy, romance, tragedy, and irony or satire.

===&quot;Rhetorical Criticism: Theory of Genres&quot;===

In the first three essays, Frye deals mainly with the first three elements of Aristotle&#x27;s elements of poetry (i.e. mythos, ethos, dianoia). In the fourth essay, he explores the last three elements:
* &quot;melos&quot; - the element dealing with the tonal, musical aspect of literature
* &quot;lexis&quot; - the written word, lying somewhere between musical and visual aspects. It may be referred to as diction (ear) or imagery (eye) depending on the critical focus.
* &quot;opsis&quot; - the element dealing with visual aspects of literature

Whereas mythos is the verbal imitation of action and dianoia the verbal imitation of thought (ethos being composed of the two), melos and opsis (with lexis composed of the two) correspond, though seen from a different (rhetorical) perspective. Frye identifies the connection as such: &quot;The world of social action and event . . . has a particularly strong association with the ear. . . . The world of individual thought and idea has a correspondingly close connection with the eye . . .&quot; (Frye, 243).

Rhetoric means two things: ornamental (opsis) speech and persuasive (melos) speech. Rhetorical criticism, then, is the exploration of literature in the light of melos, opsis, and their interplay as manifested in lexis.

The &quot;radical of presentation&quot;—the relation (or idealized relation) between author and audience—is a further consideration. Difference in genre relies not on topical considerations (science fiction, romance, mystery), nor in length (e.g. epics are long, lyrics are short), but in the radical of presentation. As such, Frye proposes a total of four distinct genres:
* epos - Author speaks directly to audience (e.g. story telling, formal speech).
* fiction - Author and audience are hidden from each other (e.g. most novels).
* drama - Author is hidden from the audience; audience experiences content directly.
* lyric - Audience is &quot;hidden&quot; from author; that is, the speaker is &quot;overheard&quot; by hearers.

These four genres form the organizing principle of the essay, first examining the distinctive kind of rhythm of each, then looking at specific forms of each more closely. As Frye describes each genre, he explains the function of melos and opsis in each. To understand Frye&#x27;s melos, it is important to note his counter-intuitive usage of the term &quot;musical&quot;. He contends that the common usage of the term is inaccurate for purposes of criticism, drawn from analogy with harmony, a stable relationship. Music, however, does not consist of a plastic, static, continuously stable relationship, but rather a series of dissonances resolving at the end into a stable relationship. Poetry containing little dissonance, then, has more in common with the plastic arts than with music.

The original presentation of the epic was &quot;ta epe&quot; (that which is spoken), and when an author, speaker, or storyteller addresses a visible audience directly, we have epos. The rhythm of epos is that of recurrence (i.e. accent, meter, sound patterns). These are the rhythms most commonly associated with poetry.

&quot;Fiction&quot; is a vague term which Frye uses to avoid introducing too many new terms. Part of the difficulty comes from fact that this is the only of the four genres which has no precedent in antiquity. He acknowledges having used the term previously in a different sense. In this essay, the term refers to literature in which the author addresses the audience through a book, or more simply stated, prose. The rhythm of prose is that of continuity of meaning.

Drama lies halfway between epos and fiction, or more accurately, its diction must fit the setting and the character. Some characters may be melos-oriented, speaking in meter or with various rhetorical effects in song and banter. Others may be opsis-oriented, speaking more in prose and conveying ideological content. Most characters alternate according to the dramatic situation. Such a marriage of the appropriate language with the character and setting (ethos) defines a rhythm of decorum, the distinctive rhythm of drama.

Classical lyrical poetry often presents a shepherd speaking of his love; he is overheard by his audience. However, the distinctiveness of lyric comes more from its peculiar rhythm than from this radical of representation. Frye describes this rhythm as associative rather than logical and is the stuff of dreams and the subconscious. It is closely related to the chant, and though it is found in all literature, it is more apparent in certain kinds of literature than others. At this point Frye suggests a connection between the four historical modes and the four genres. In this sense, the lyrical is typical of the ironic age—just as the ironic protagonist has turned away from society, the lyrical poet makes utterances without regard to the audience. The lyrical rhythm is very clearly seen in Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;, a work based almost entirely on associative babbles and dream utterance.

<text>Uriel Weinreich (, ; May 23, 1926 – March 30, 1967) was a Jewish–American linguist.

== Life ==
Uriel Weinreich was born in Wilno, Poland (since 1945, Vilnius, Lithuania), the first child of linguist Max Weinreich () and Regina Szabad, to a family that paternally hailed from Courland in Latvia and maternally came from a well-respected and established Wilno Jewish family.

He served as a first lieutenant in the United States Army from 1944 to 1946.

He earned his BA at Columbia University in 1948, during which time he was also elected a member of Phi Beta Kappa. He earn his MA from Columbia in 1949 and his PhD in 1951. From 1951 to 1952 he was an editor and information specialist with the State Department at which point he joined Columbia University&#x27;s faculty. There he specialized in Yiddish studies, sociolinguistics, and dialectology and was named the Atran Professor of Yiddish.

In 1959, he was awarded a John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship.

He advocated the increased acceptance of semantics and compiled the iconic &quot;Modern English-Yiddish Yiddish-English Dictionary&quot;, published shortly after his death. Weinreich is also credited with being one of the first linguists to appreciate the phenomenon of learner language, interlanguage, 19 years before Larry Selinker coined the term in his 1972 article &quot;Interlanguage&quot;. In his benchmark book &quot;Languages in Contact&quot; Weinreich first noted that learners of second languages consider linguistic forms from their first language equal to forms in the target language. However the essential inequality of these forms leads to speech which the native speakers of the target language consider inferior.

Weinreich was the mentor of both Marvin Herzog, with whom he laid the groundwork for the &quot;Language and Culture Atlas of Ashkenazic Jewry&quot; (LCAAJ), and William Labov. He also co-wrote with them the 1968 book-length paper &quot;Empirical foundations in historical linguistics&quot;, which identified five aspects of language change that are intended to describe phenomena of language change. They have become a major sociolinguistic benchmark of description.

He died of cancer on March 30, 1967, at Montefiore Hospital in New York, prior to the publication of his Yiddish–English dictionary.
Writing about Weinreich in his history of Yiddish, &quot;Words on fire&quot;, Dovid Katz said: &quot;Though he lived less than forty-one years, Uriel Weinreich ... managed to facilitate the teaching of Yiddish language at American universities, build a new Yiddish language atlas, and demonstrate the importance of Yiddish for the science of linguistics.&quot;
