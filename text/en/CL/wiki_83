<text>Delonte Maurice West (born July 26, 1983) is an American former professional basketball player. He played in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the Boston Celtics, Seattle SuperSonics, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Dallas Mavericks. He also played professionally for the Fujian Xunxing and Shanghai Sharks of the Chinese Basketball Association and the Texas Legends of the NBA G League. Prior to playing professionally, West played college basketball at Saint Joseph&#x27;s University.

==Early life==
West went to Eleanor Roosevelt High School in Greenbelt, Maryland, where he excelled at basketball, teaming with fellow future NBA player Eddie Basden. He led the Roosevelt Raiders to their first state tournament appearance. They made it to the Maryland 4A championship, where Delonte had 22 points and 8 rebounds, but the Raiders lost 70–58. He was named Washington Post All Met Basketball Player of the Year due to his averages of 20.2 points, 6.5 rebounds, 3.9 assists, and 3.1 steals per game.

==College career==
At Saint Joseph&#x27;s University, West formed what was widely regarded as the best backcourt in the country along with John R. Wooden Award and Naismith Award winner Jameer Nelson. As a junior, West averaged 18.9 points and 6.7 assists per game, shooting 41% from three-point range. His efforts helped the 2003–04 Saint Joseph&#x27;s Hawks to go 27–0 in the regular season and earn an Elite Eight appearance in the NCAA Tournament. Saint Joseph&#x27;s finished the season at 30–2.

==Professional career==

===Boston Celtics (2004–2007)===
West chose to leave St. Joseph&#x27;s after his junior campaign where he was selected by the Boston Celtics as the 24th pick in the 2004 NBA draft. In his first season, he struggled with injuries, playing a total of just 39 games, mostly coming off the bench. He averaged 4.5 points, 1.7 rebounds and 1.6 assists per game. After making the transition to point guard in his rookie season, West was named the starting point guard at the beginning of the 2005–06 season by head coach Doc Rivers.

In 2005–06, West averaged 11.8 PPG, 4.1 RPG and 4.6 APG. On February 12, 2006, he was named to represent the Celtics on the sophomore team for the Rookie Challenge at NBA All-Star Weekend. Coincidentally, he replaced his college teammate Jameer Nelson, who withdrew because of injuries.

West was moved to the shooting guard spot in the 2006–07 season, but showed signs of difficulty early in the season. He was later moved back to the point guard position. West had some clutch shots, including a game-winning buzzer-beater against the Charlotte Bobcats on November 8, 2006, and a game-tying three pointer with 4 seconds remaining in regulation to bring the game into overtime against the New Jersey Nets on March 3, 2007. The Celtics would eventually win the game against the Nets. The next day against the Minnesota Timberwolves, West scored a career-high 31 points and made a career-high 12 free throw shots, in a double overtime Celtics victory. West scored all 31 of his points in that game during the second half and the two overtimes. At the end of the 2006–07 season, he was sharing starting minutes with Rajon Rondo.

===Seattle Supersonics (2007–2008)===
After three seasons in Boston, on June 27, 2007, he was traded along with Wally Szczerbiak and the 5th overall pick in the 2007 NBA draft (Jeff Green (basketball)) to Seattle SuperSonics in exchange for Ray Allen and Glen Davis.

=== Cleveland Cavaliers (2008–2010) ===
==== 2007–08 season ====
On February 21, 2008, West was part of a three-team trade that sent him, Ben Wallace, Joe Smith, and Wally Szczerbiak to the Cleveland Cavaliers. The trade also sent Larry Hughes, Shannon Brown, Drew Gooden, and Cedric Simmons to the Chicago Bulls and Donyell Marshall, Ira Newble, and Adrian Griffin to Seattle. He was reunited with his Saint Joseph&#x27;s teammate Dwayne Jones.

As a Cavalier, West played in 26 regular season games (starting all 26), and averaged 10.3 points, 4.5 assists, 3.7 rebounds and 1.1 steals. He had a season high 20 points against the Boston Celtics only six days after his trade to the Cavaliers and a season-high 11 assists on March 30, 2008, against the Philadelphia 76ers. For the entire season, West played in 61 games (starting 31) and averaged 8.3 points, 3.8 assists and 3.2 rebounds.

On April 27, 2008, West made perhaps the most timely 3-pointer of his NBA career with 5.4 seconds left in a playoff game against the Washington Wizards, in Washington. His tie-breaking game-winner took the Cleveland Cavaliers to a 3–1 lead in this first round series.

==== 2008–09 season ====
On September 12, 2008, West signed a three-year, $12.7 million contract with the Cavaliers. He was moved to the starting shooting guard position at the beginning of the season, due to the acquisition of Mo Williams.

He became a starter for the Cavaliers, who won a league-best and franchise-record 66 games during the regular season and went 39–2 at home. In addition to his role as the starting shooting guard, he also served as the backup point guard, manning the position when Mo Williams was not in the game. He emerged as a talented backcourt defensive player, guarding a variety of players ranging from the Ben Gordon to the Hedo Türkoğlu. Offensively, he proved to be a capable outside shooter, with a field-goal percentage of 46% (and 40% on three-pointers), and maintained his reputation as an athletic and hard-nosed driver with the ball. West, Williams, Zydrunas Ilgauskas, and Anderson Varejão came together to form a supporting cast for franchise player LeBron James.

On March 2, 2009, against the Miami Heat, West set a career high with eight steals.

In the playoffs, West&#x27;s averages shot up to nearly 14 points per game, despite struggling with his three-point shot much like his backcourt-mate Williams, whose shooting struggles in the playoffs were well documented. Further, the Cavs&#x27; lack of scoring punch on the bench forced West to take on extremely high minute loads. He averaged 42 minutes per game throughout the postseason, and in the Eastern Conference Finals against the Orlando Magic (which the Cavs lost in six games due in part to, again, outside shooting struggles from Williams and West) he played over 45 minutes per game, more than any other player in the series. In addition to this, he drew the defensive assignment of Hedo Türkoğlu, who had a seven-inch height advantage, to allow James to play the &quot;rover&quot;. West was able to stop Türkoğlu&#x27;s facilitation of the Magic offense in spurts, but the height advantage was too much, as Türkoğlu helped to dominate the Cavalier defense throughout the series. West set a new career playoff high in points, with 22 in a losing effort in Game 6 against the Magic when the Cavs were eliminated.

==== 2009–10 season ====
Over the 2009–10 season, Delonte West averaged 8.8 points in 25 minutes per game with only three games as a starter for the Cavs. In the 2010 NBA Playoffs, the Cavaliers lost in the Conference Semifinals series to the Boston Celtics in six games. West averaged 6.7 points in the playoffs.

===Return to Celtics (2010–2011)===
After LeBron James left the Cavaliers to sign with the Miami Heat, the Cavaliers traded West, along with Sebastian Telfair, to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Ramon Sessions, Ryan Hollins, and a future draft pick. The Timberwolves waived West shortly after acquiring him.

On September 1, 2010, the Boston Celtics signed West to a one-year contract to back up Rajon Rondo as a point guard.

West was suspended for the first ten games of the 2010–11 season following a guilty plea to weapons charges in Maryland. For the 2010–11 season, West finished with 5.6 points per game, 0.8 steals per game, and 2.7 assists per game. He also shot .867 from the free throw line.

===Dallas Mavericks (2011–2012)===
West signed with the Dallas Mavericks on December 13, 2011. During the 2011–12 season, he averaged 9.6 points per game. He re-signed with the Mavericks on July 26, 2012.

West was suspended indefinitely following an argument after a preseason loss on October 15, 2012. He was reinstated after one day, but suspended again on October 25 for the same reason after another preseason loss. On October 29, 2012, West was waived by the Mavericks.

===Texas Legends (2013)===
On January 25, 2013, West was acquired by the Texas Legends of the NBA D-League. On March 16, 2013, West made his debut for the Legends with 10 points in an 85–103 loss to the Santa Cruz Warriors.

=== Fujian Xunxing (2013–2014) ===
In October 2013, West signed a one-year deal with Fujian Xunxing of China.

=== Shanghai Sharks (2014) ===
In July 2014, West joined the Los Angeles Clippers for the 2014 NBA Summer League.

In September 2014, West signed a one-year deal with the Shanghai Sharks, returning to China for a second stint. However, he was released by the team on November 18 after just four games despite a 29-point debut game in the season opener on November 1.

=== Return to Legends (2015) ===
On January 12, 2015, West signed with Guaros de Lara of the Venezuelan Liga Profesional de Baloncesto but left the team before playing in a game for them.

On March 12, 2015, West was reacquired by the Texas Legends and appeared for them that night against the Delaware 87ers. In 19 minutes off the bench, he recorded 10 points and six rebounds in a 122–119 loss. On April 2, he was waived by the Legends after suffering a season-ending injury.

==Personal life==
West has described his childhood as &quot;happy-poor&quot;, and has said that he lived with various relatives. During his teen years, West states that he abused drugs, engaged in self-harm, and spent time in children&#x27;s hospitals.

West is multiracial, with African American, Piscataway Native American, and White American heritage. 
West was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2008. While he initially accepted the diagnosis, he later disputed it, suggesting that his difficulties arose from a combination of temporary depression and the stresses of a basketball player lifestyle.

On September 17, 2009, West was pulled over for a traffic violation while riding a Can-Am Spyder three-wheeled motorcycle. During this stop, it was discovered that West had a 9mm Beretta pistol in his waistband, a Ruger .357 Magnum revolver strapped to his leg, and a Remington 870 shotgun in a guitar case across his back. He was subsequently arrested and had a court appearance on November 20. West contended that he was moving the weapons to a different location because his mother had informed him that his cousins&#x27; children had stumbled upon them in a closet at his home. West pleaded guilty to the traffic and weapons charges and was sentenced to electronic monitoring, unsupervised probation, and 40 hours of community service as well as psychological counseling.

While West has bought homes for each of his parents and has provided other financial support for relatives, he has also experienced financial difficulties. During the 2011 NBA lockout, he applied for a job at Home Depot and worked at a furniture store.

West&#x27;s first marriage ended in divorce in 2010. He married Caressa Madden in 2013. They have two children.
They divorced in 2020.

In February 2016, West was photographed in a public place in Houston, Texas, while barefoot and wearing a hospital gown. In June 2016, a photo of West panhandling in Temple Hills, Maryland, went viral. The photo sparked speculation that West was homeless, as the Twitter account that broke the photo suggested as such and asked his followers to pray for West given his psychological issues. West immediately denied the rumors, stating that, while the photo is genuine, he has a home and was merely assisting someone who actually was homeless, since the homeless man was quadriplegic.

In January 2020, a video surfaced online showing West in handcuffs on a Washington, DC, highway.

On September 28, 2020, after photos circulated showing West panhandling at an intersection in Dallas, Texas, Mavericks owner Mark Cuban picked up West from a gas station. Cuban paid for drug rehabilitation treatment and provided West a hotel room to stay in. On January 19, 2021, reports came in that West now had a job at the rehab facility where he checked in and had reunited with his mother. In July 2022, new videos came to light showing West begging again, this time in Virginia.

On October 15, 2022, West was arrested again in Fairfax County, Virginia, after being seen trying to enter a car that did not belong to him. He was booked on four misdemeanor charges.

On June 6, 2024, West was arrested again in Fairfax County, Virginia, for violating the terms of his previous release and resisting arrest. He was found unresponsive by police officers after a brief chase, and was administered Narcan. When that didn&#x27;t have the desired effect, he was taken to a local hospital and administered a second dose, which did work. He was released after being charged. Later that same month, West was captured on video by worried onlookers stumbling around a parking lot in Arlington, Virginia. 

On November 2, 2024, the former NBA guard was accused of trespassing and arrested by the Fairfax County Police Department. He was held on a $1,000 bond and released on November 3.

<text>The Oklahoma City Lightning is a full-contact women&#x27;s American football team in the Women&#x27;s Spring Football League based in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Home games are played at Taft Stadium.

Formerly a member of the Independent Women&#x27;s Football League in their inaugural season of 2002, and then the National Women&#x27;s Football Association from 2003 until 2008, they have made the playoffs in six of seven seasons played so far, losing four times in the Conference Championship Game (two to the Pensacola Power in 2003 and 2005 and once to the Austin Outlaws in 2002 and the Columbus Comets in 2007) and losing twice in the NWFA Championship Game (to the Detroit Demolition in 2004 and to the D.C. Divas in 2006).

After sitting out the 2009 season, the Lightning were blown out 62-0 by the Lone Star Mustangs in their first game of 2010. The following week, the Lightning left the WFA and almost folded, however, they have since joined the Women&#x27;s Spring Football League, where they will play the remainder of 2010 and beyond.

<text>Kanbun ( &#x27;Han writing&#x27;) is a system for writing Literary Chinese used in Japan from the Nara period until the 20th century. Much of Japanese literature was written in this style and it was the general writing style for official and intellectual works throughout the period. As a result, Sino-Japanese vocabulary makes up a large portion of the Japanese lexicon and much classical Chinese literature is accessible to Japanese readers in some resemblance of the original.

== History ==
The Japanese writing system originated through adoption and adaptation of written Chinese. Some of Japan&#x27;s oldest books (e.g. the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;) and dictionaries (e.g. the &quot;Tenrei Banshō Meigi&quot; and &quot;Wamyō Ruijushō&quot;) were written in &quot;kanbun&quot;. Other Japanese literary genres have parallels; the &quot;Kaifūsō&quot; is the oldest collection of . Burton Watson&#x27;s English translations of &quot;kanbun&quot; compositions provide an introduction to this literary field.

Samuel Martin coined the term &quot;Sino-Xenic&quot; in 1953 to describe Chinese as written in Japan, Korea, and other foreign (hence &quot;-xenic&quot;) zones on China&#x27;s periphery. Roy Andrew Miller notes that although Japanese &quot;kanbun&quot; conventions have Sino-Xenic parallels with other traditions for reading Literary Chinese like Korean &quot;hanmun&quot; and Vietnamese , only &quot;kanbun&quot; has survived to the present day. He explains how
in the Japanese &quot;kanbun&quot; reading tradition a Chinese text is simultaneously punctuated, analyzed, and translated into classical Japanese. It operates according to a limited canon of Japanese forms and syntactic structures which are treated as existing in a one-to-one alignment with the vocabulary and structures of classical Chinese. At its worst, this system for reading Chinese as if it were Japanese became a kind of lazy schoolboy&#x27;s trot to a classical text; at its best, it has preserved the analysis and interpretation of large body of literary Chinese texts which would otherwise have been completely lost; hence, the &quot;kanbun&quot; tradition can often be of great value for an understanding of early Chinese literature.

William C. Hannas points out the linguistic hurdles involved in &quot;kanbun&quot; transformation.
&quot;Kanbun&quot;, literally &quot;Chinese writing,&quot; refers to a genre of techniques for making Chinese texts read like Japanese, or for writing in a way imitative of Chinese. For a Japanese, neither of these tasks could be accomplished easily because of the two languages&#x27; different structures. As I have mentioned, Chinese is an isolating language. Its grammatical relations are identified in subject–verb–object (SVO) order and through the use of particles similar to English prepositions. Inflection plays no role in the grammar. Morphemes are typically one syllable in length and combine to form words without modification to their phonetic structures (tone excepted). Conversely, the basic structure of a transitive Japanese sentence is SOV, with the usual syntactic features associated with languages of this typology, including positions, that is, grammar particles that appear the words and phrases to which they apply.
He lists four major Japanese problems: word order, parsing which Chinese characters should be read together, deciding how to pronounce the characters, and finding suitable equivalents for Chinese function words.

According to John Timothy Wixted, scholars have disregarded &quot;kanbun&quot;.
In terms of its size, often its quality, and certainly its importance both at the time it was written and cumulatively in the cultural tradition, &quot;kanbun&quot; is arguably the biggest and most important area of Japanese literary study that has been ignored in recent times, and the one least properly represented as part of the canon.
A new development in &quot;kanbun&quot; studies is the Web-accessible database being developed by scholars at Nishogakusha University in Tokyo.

== Terminology ==
The Japanese word &quot;kanbun&quot; originally meant &#x27;Literary Chinese writings&#x27;—or, the Chinese classics. &quot;Kanbun&quot; compositions used two common types of Japanese kanji readings: Sino-Japanese &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; (&#x27;pronunciation readings&#x27;) borrowed from Chinese pronunciations and native Japanese &quot;kun&#x27;yomi&quot; &#x27;explanation readings&#x27; from Japanese equivalents. For example, can be read as adapted from Middle Chinese or as from the indigenous Japanese word meaning &#x27;road&#x27;.

&quot;Kanbun&quot; implemented two particular types of &quot;kana&quot;. One was &quot;okurigana&quot; &#x27;accompanying script&#x27;, &quot;kana&quot; suffixes added to kanji stems to show their Japanese readings; the other was &quot;furigana&quot; &#x27;brandishing script&#x27;, smaller &quot;kana&quot; syllables written alongside &quot;kanji&quot; to indicate pronunciation. These were used primarily as reinforcements to writing in &quot;kanbun&quot;. &quot;Kanbun&quot;—as opposed to , Japanese text with Japanese syntax and predominately &quot;kun&#x27;yomi&quot; readings—is divided into several types:

;: Chinese text written with Chinese syntax and &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; characters
;: &quot;Kanbun&quot; without reading aids or punctuation
;&quot;Wakan konkō-bun&quot;: Sino-Japanese composition written with Japanese syntax and mixed &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; and &quot;kun&#x27;yomi&quot; readings
;: Chinese modified with Japanese syntax, a &quot;Japan-ized&quot; version of Literary Chinese

Jean-Noël Robert describes &quot;kanbun&quot; as a &quot;perfectly frozen, &#x27;dead language that was continuously used from the late Heian period (794–1185) until after World War II:

Classical Chinese, which, as we have seen, had long since ceased to be a spoken language on the mainland (if indeed it had ever been), has been in use in the Japanese archipelago longer than the Japanese language itself. The oldest written remnants found in Japan are all in Chinese, though it is a matter of considerable debate whether traces of the Japanese vernacular are to be found in them. Taking both languages together until the end of the nineteenth century, and taking into account all the monastic documents, literature in the widest sense of the term, and texts in &#x27;near-Chinese&#x27; (&quot;hentai-kanbun&quot;), it is entirely possible that the sheer volume of texts written in Chinese in Japan slightly exceed what was written in Japanese.

As Literary Chinese originally lacked punctuation, the &quot;kanbun&quot; tradition developed various conventional reading punctuation, diacritical, and syntactic markers.

;: Guiding marks for rendering Chinese into Japanese
;: The Japanese reading of a kanji
;: A Japanese reading of a Chinese passage
;: Diacritical dots on characters to indicate Japanese grammatical inflections
;: Punctuation marks analogous to commas and full stops
;: Marks placed alongside characters indicating their Japanese ordering is to be read in reverse

&quot;Kaeriten&quot; grammatically transforms Literary Chinese into Japanese word order. Two are syntactic symbols, the | —linking mark that denotes phrases composed of more than one character, and the denotes &#x27;reverse marks&#x27;. The rest are kanji commonly used in numbering and ordering systems:
* Four numerals: &#x27;one&#x27;, &#x27;two&#x27;, &#x27;three&#x27;, and &#x27;four&#x27;
* Three locatives: &#x27;top&#x27;, &#x27;middle&#x27;, and &#x27;bottom&#x27;
* Four Heavenly Stems: &#x27;first&#x27;, &#x27;second&#x27;, &#x27;third&#x27;, and &quot;hinoto&quot; &#x27;fourth&#x27;
* Three cosmological , see &quot;Wakan Sansai Zue&quot;: &#x27;heaven&#x27;, &#x27;earth&#x27;, and &#x27;person&#x27;. For written English, these &quot;kaeriten&quot; would correspond with 1, 2, 3; I, II, III; A, B, C, etc.

As an analogy for &quot;kanbun&quot; changing the word order from Chinese sentences with subject–verb–object (SVO) into Japanese subject–object–verb (SOV), John DeFrancis gives this example of using a literal English translation—another SVO language—of the opening of the Latin-language &quot;&quot;.

DeFrancis adds, &quot;A better analogy would be the reverse situation–Caesar rendering an English text in his native language and adding Latin case endings.&quot;

Two English textbooks for students of &quot;kanbun&quot; are &quot;An Introduction to Kambun&quot; by Sydney Crawcour, reviewed by Marian Ury in 1990, and &quot;An Introduction to Japanese Kanbun&quot; by Komai and Rohlich, reviewed by Andrew Markus in 1990 and Wixted in 1998.

== Example ==

The illustration to the right exemplifies &quot;kanbun&quot;. These eight words comprise the well-known first line in the &quot;Han Feizi&quot; story (ch. 36) that first coined the term (Japanese , &#x27;contradiction, inconsistency&#x27;, lit. &quot;spear-shield&quot;), illustrating the irresistible force paradox. Debating with a Confucianist about the legendary Chinese sage rulers Yao and Shun, the Legalist Han Fei argues that one cannot praise them both because that would be making a &quot;spear–shield&quot; contradiction.

Among the Chu, there was a man selling shields and spears. He praised the former saying, &quot;My shields are so solid nothing can penetrate them&quot;. Then he would praise his spears saying, &quot;My spears are so sharp that among all things there&#x27;s nothing they can&#x27;t penetrate&quot;. Somebody else said, &quot;If somebody tried to penetrate your shields with your spears, what would happen?&quot; The man could not respond.

The first sentence would read thus, using modern Standard Chinese pronunciation:

A fairly literal translation would be &quot;among Chu people, there existed somebody who was selling shields and spears&quot;. All words can be literally translated into English, except for the final particle &#x27;one who&#x27;, &#x27;somebody who&#x27;, which works as nominalizer marking a verb phrase as certain kinds of noun phrases. The original Chinese sentence is marked with five Japanese &quot;kaeriten&quot; as:

To interpret this, The &#x27;reverse&#x27; mark indicates that the order of the adjacent characters, and , must be reversed:
:

The word marked with &#x27;bottom&#x27; is shifted after marked by &#x27;top&#x27;:
:

Likewise, the word marked with &#x27;two&#x27; is shifted to after marked by &#x27;one&#x27;:
:

To represent this reading in numerical terms:

Following these &quot;kanbun&quot; instructions step by step transforms the sentence so it has the typical Japanese subject–object–verb argument order. The Sino-Japanese &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; readings and meanings are:

Next, Japanese function words and conjugations can be added with &quot;okurigana&quot;, and Japanese &quot;to ... to&quot; &#x27;and&#x27; can substitute Chinese &#x27;and&#x27;. More specifically, the first is treated as an additional function word, and the second, the reading of :

Lastly, &quot;kun&#x27;yomi&quot; readings for characters can be annotated with &quot;furigana&quot;. Normally &quot;furigana&quot; are only used for uncommon kanji or unusual readings. This sentence&#x27;s only uncommon kanji is &quot;hisa(gu)&quot; &#x27;sell&#x27;, &#x27;deal in&#x27;, a literary character which is included in neither the kyōiku kanji nor the jōyō kanji lists. However, in &quot;kanbun&quot; texts it is relatively common to use a large amount of &quot;furigana&quot;—often there is an interest in recovering the readings used by people of the Heian or Nara periods, and since many kanji can be read either with &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; or &quot;kun&#x27;yomi&quot; pronunciations in a kanbun text, the &quot;furigana&quot; can show at least one editor&#x27;s opinion of how it may have been read.

The completed &quot;kundoku&quot; translation reads as a well-formed Japanese sentence with &quot;kun&#x27;yomi&quot;:

This annotated &quot;kanbun&quot; translates to, &quot;among Chu people, there existed one who was selling shields and spears&quot;.

=== Complicated example ===
To illustrate what is possible with &quot;kaeriten&quot;, here follows a rather complicated example from Crawcour&#x27;s book, to which he notes: &quot;The student may take some light comfort from the fact that this is as complicated as these markings can get.&quot;

== Unicode ==
Kanbun were added to the Unicode Standard in June 1993 with version 1.1. Two Unicode &quot;kaeriten&quot; are grammatical symbols () for linking and reverse marks. The others are the organizational kanji for numerals (e.g. ), locatives (e.g. ), Heavenly Stems (e.g. ), and levels (e.g. ).

The Unicode block for kanbun is U+3190..319F:

<text>William Asa Hutchinson II (, &quot;&quot;; born December 3, 1950) is an American attorney, businessman, and politician who served as the 46th governor of Arkansas from 2015 to 2023. A member of the Republican Party, he previously served as a U.S. attorney, U.S. representative, and in two roles in the George W. Bush administration. He was a candidate for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination.

In 1982, President Ronald Reagan appointed Hutchinson to serve as the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Arkansas, which covers most of Fort Smith. In 1986, Hutchinson unsuccessfully challenged Democratic U.S. Senator Dale Bumpers, before losing a race for Attorney General of Arkansas to Winston Bryant four years later. He later successfully ran for the House of Representatives in 1996, representing Arkansas&#x27;s 3rd congressional district until 2001, when president George W. Bush successfully nominated him as Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration. In 2003, Bush appointed Hutchinson as the Under Secretary for border and transportation security at the newly established Department of Homeland Security; Hutchinson retired from the Bush administration in 2005.

In 2006, Hutchinson was the Republican nominee for governor of Arkansas, but lost to Democratic nominee Mike Beebe, the state attorney general. In 2014, Hutchinson was again the Republican nominee for governor, this time defeating the Democratic nominee, U.S. Representative Mike Ross. He was reelected in 2018 with nearly two-thirds of the vote. Due to term limits, he was barred from seeking reelection in 2022, and was succeeded by Sarah Huckabee Sanders.

From 2020 to 2021, Hutchinson served as vice chair of the National Governors Association. He succeeded Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York as chair of the organization for 2021–2022. In 2023 he announced his candidacy in the 2024 Republican Party presidential primaries. He suspended his campaign on January 16, 2024, after a poor performance in the Iowa caucuses. In April 2024, he joined Scripps News as a political contributor.

==Early life and legal career==
Hutchinson was born in Bentonville, Arkansas, the son of Coral Virginia (Mount) Hutchinson (1912–1998) and John Malcolm Hutchinson Sr. (1907–1991). He earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in accounting from Bob Jones University in South Carolina in 1972 and received his J.D. from the University of Arkansas School of Law in 1975. He practiced law in Fort Smith for 21 years and handled more than 100 jury trials.

In 1982, President Ronald Reagan appointed Hutchinson U.S. attorney for the Western District of Arkansas. At age 31, Hutchinson was the nation&#x27;s youngest U.S. attorney. He made national headlines after successfully prosecuting The Covenant, The Sword, and The Arm of the Lord (CSA), a white supremacist organization founded by polygamist James Ellison. The CSA forced a three-day armed standoff with local, state, and federal law enforcement. As U.S. attorney, Hutchinson personally negotiated a peaceful conclusion to the standoff.

==Early political career==

===Pre-Congress efforts===
In 1986, Hutchinson ran against incumbent Democratic U.S. senator and former governor Dale Bumpers. It was a good year for Democrats, and Hutchinson fared worse than Bumpers&#x27;s previous Senate challenger, Little Rock investment banker William P. &quot;Bill&quot; Clark.

In 1990, Hutchinson ran against Winston Bryant for attorney general of Arkansas; he lost the race by a margin of 55–45%. Hutchinson then became co-chair, with Sheffield Nelson, of the Arkansas Republican Party, a position he held from 1991 through 1995, the last four years as full chair. He considered a rematch with Bumpers in 1992 before deferring to Mike Huckabee, who lost to Bumpers.

===U.S. House of Representatives===
In 1992 Hutchinson&#x27;s brother, Tim, was elected to Congress in Arkansas&#x27;s third congressional district, when veteran U.S. Representative John Paul Hammerschmidt retired. In 1996, when his brother decided not to run for a third term in the House in order to seek the open Senate seat caused by the retirement of David Pryor, Hutchinson ran for the seat and won.

Hutchinson, who had at first decided to run for an open seat in the Arkansas House of Representatives from Sebastian County, defeated Ann Henry, a longtime friend of Bill and Hillary Clinton, in November 1996. Although Henry outspent Hutchinson during the campaign, the district&#x27;s heavy Republican tilt and his brother Tim&#x27;s presence atop the ballot helped Asa win with 52% of the vote. Tim Hutchinson also won his campaign for the U.S. Senate and served one term, losing his reelection bid in 2002.

In 1998, Hutchinson was reelected to the House with far less difficulty, taking 81% of the vote against a third party challenger. He was reelected unopposed in 2000.

Hutchinson served as a house manager (prosecutor) in the impeachment trial of Bill Clinton.

In office, Hutchinson compiled a voting record as conservative as his brother&#x27;s. He led efforts to crack down on illegal drugs, particularly methamphetamine. Hutchinson also served as one of the managers of the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton in 1998. In 1999, Hutchinson was involved in the effort to reform campaign finance laws and offered an alternative proposal to the bill by Christopher Shays and Marty Meehan, which he opposed on the grounds that it &quot;went too far&quot; by attempting to ban television commercials by legal third-party organizations. Hutchinson did support John McCain&#x27;s and Russ Feingold&#x27;s Senate bill.

Hutchinson unsuccessfully tried to modify the civil asset forfeiture reform bill that sought to prevent police abuse of its power to seize private property on mere suspicion of being linked to any criminal investigation. His amendment would allegedly have empowered the police to continue profiting from drug money.

===Drug Enforcement Administration===
In 2001, at the beginning of the George W. Bush administration, Hutchinson was appointed Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). He was confirmed by a 98–1 Senate vote.

===Department of Homeland Security===
After the September 11 attacks, Congress created the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). President Bush tapped Hutchinson to lead the Border and Transportation Security Directorate, a division of the DHS. The Senate confirmed Hutchinson by unanimous consent on January 23, 2003. Hutchinson left office as Undersecretary on March 1, 2005.

==Post-Bush administration==

===Business career===
In early 2005, Hutchinson founded a consulting firm, Hutchinson Group, LLC, with partners Betty Guhman and Kirk Tompkins, in Little Rock, and accepted a contract for a one-year position with Venable LLP in Washington, D.C., as the chair of its Homeland Security practice. Hutchinson ended his contract with Venable LLP in March 2006 to focus on his gubernatorial campaign and his consulting firm in Little Rock. In January 2007, Hutchinson rejoined Venable.

In June 2006, the &quot;Arkansas Democrat-Gazette&quot; reported that Hutchinson&#x27;s $2,800 investment in Fortress America Acquisition Corporation, a company that Hutchinson was advising, was worth over $1 million after the company&#x27;s initial public offering. The news story noted that Hutchinson was unable to touch his stock for another two years. The six founding shareholders in Fortress America, in addition to Hutchinson, included former U.S. Representative Tom McMillen, former U.S. Senator Don Nickles, and a private-equity firm that had former CIA Director James Woolsey among its partners.

On May 4, 2006, Hutchinson had filed a financial disclosure form he was required to submit as a candidate for governor. The form did not list his 200,000 shares in Fortress America, which were trading at about $5 per share. &quot;Just totally an oversight&quot;, Hutchinson said when questioned by the media in June. He filed an amended report the next day to correct the error.

===Political activities===
Hutchinson agreed to serve on The Constitution Project&#x27;s Guantanamo Task Force in December 2010. He told the Associated Press he agreed to join the task force because he believed it was &quot;something important for our national security and our war on terrorism.&quot;

In the wake of the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, the National Rifle Association of America (NRA) assembled a group with backgrounds in homeland security, law enforcement training, and school safety to review school security standards in select areas of the country. Led by Hutchinson, the group&#x27;s stated goal was to produce a comprehensive plan to address the safety of children in schools and to prevent such shootings in the future. On April 2, 2013, he presented the National School Shield plan during a news conference at the National Press Club.

==Governor of Arkansas==
===2006 election===
Shortly after returning to Arkansas, Hutchinson announced his candidacy for governor in 2006. Initially, he was to face three-term Lieutenant Governor Winthrop Paul Rockefeller, who was favored in most pre-election polls, in the Republican primary. But Rockefeller&#x27;s withdrawal and death from a blood disorder in early 2006 led to Hutchinson winning the primary. In the general election, he lost to the Democratic nominee, then-Arkansas Attorney General Mike Beebe.

===2014 election===

Hutchinson was the Republican nominee for governor of Arkansas in 2014. He was supported by House Speaker Davy Carter. On November 4, 2014, after defeating Tea Party-backed Curtis Coleman in the Republican primary, he defeated the Democratic nominee, Mike Ross, in the general election with 55% of the vote, the best showing for a Republican in an open-seat gubernatorial race since the end of Reconstruction. His victory also gave the GOP complete control of state government for the first time since the end of Reconstruction.

===2018 election===

Hutchinson was reelected on November 6, 2018, in a landslide, taking over 65% of the vote and carrying all but eight counties. In a bad year for the GOP nationally, Hutchinson garnered the largest margin of victory for a Republican candidate in Arkansas history.

===Tenure===

Hutchinson took office as governor on January 13, 2015.
On November 16, 2015, Hutchinson said that he would block all Syrian refugees from entering the state in response to the November 2015 Paris attacks.

Under Hutchinson, Arkansas resumed executions in 2017 after having executed no one since 2005. In 2021, DNA testing on the murder weapon and a bloody shirt at the scene of the crime did not match Ledell Lee, who was convicted and executed for murder. Hutchinson defended Lee&#x27;s execution, saying, &quot;the DNA findings released today do not present any conclusive evidence to undermine [Lee&#x27;s guilty verdict].&quot;

As governor, Hutchinson implemented work requirements for Medicaid enrollees. As a result, by December 2018, almost 17,000 Arkansans had lost their Medicaid health insurance, with reapplication available in the new calendar year.

In February 2019, Hutchinson signed a bill into law that would criminalize abortion in the event &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; is overturned. On March 9, 2021, he signed SB6, a near-total abortion bill, into law. He said that the bill was intended &quot;to set the stage for the Supreme Court overturning current case law. I would have preferred the legislation to include the exceptions for rape and incest, which has been my consistent view, and such exceptions would increase the chances for a review by the U.S. Supreme Court.&quot; On May 8, 2022, Hutchinson responded to comments by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell about potential passage of a future federal law prohibiting abortions nationwide: &quot;If the court reverses Roe v. Wade, they&#x27;re saying that the Constitution does not provide that, which returns it to the states. And that&#x27;s where the vigorous debate is going to be. That is where we&#x27;re going to face a lot of concerns on the compassion side.&quot;

In 2015, Hutchinson signed into law legislation that would prohibit localities from extending civil rights protections to LGBT individuals. At the time, Arkansas was among states that allowed discrimination in the workplace, housing and business on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation. In March 2021, Hutchinson signed into law legislation that would allow doctors to refuse non-emergency medical treatment to LGBT people based on moral objection. In April 2021, he vetoed a bill that would make it illegal for transgender minors to receive gender-affirming medication or surgery, calling it &quot;a vast government overreach&quot;. The state legislature later overrode his veto.

In August 2021, Hutchinson signed bills into law that prohibited businesses and government facilities from requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination for staff and customers to enter facilities. While Arkansas was experiencing a wave of COVID-19 cases, he also signed a bill into law that prohibited state and local officials from enacting mask mandates. He later said he regretted doing so. In December 2021, Hutchinson praised President Joe Biden&#x27;s COVID policies and thanked Biden for his efforts to &quot;get the vaccinations out&quot; and &quot;depoliticizing&quot; the federal COVID response. In January 2022, Hutchinson encouraged large businesses to not comply with the Biden administration&#x27;s vaccine requirements.

Hutchinson demanded that Republicans who tried to overturn the 2020 presidential election and spread Donald Trump&#x27;s &quot;Big Lie&quot; about mass voter fraud not be put in positions of leadership. He also accused Trump of dividing the party and said his election conspiracies were a &quot;recipe for disaster&quot;. On February 5, 2022, Hutchinson and U.S. senator Lisa Murkowski condemned the Republican National Committee&#x27;s censure of representatives Adam Kinzinger and Liz Cheney for their support of and participation on the House Select Committee tasked with investigating the January 6 United States Capitol attack.

== Post-gubernatorial career ==

=== 2024 presidential campaign ===

In May 2022, Hutchinson said he would consider running for president in 2024 even if former President Donald Trump ran again and that Trump&#x27;s candidacy would not be a factor in his decision. He added, &quot;I think he did a lot of good things for our country, but we need to go a different direction&quot;. On April 2, 2023, during an interview with ABC News&#x27; Jonathan Karl, Hutchinson announced his candidacy for the 2024 Republican Party presidential primaries.

Toward the beginning of his campaign Hutchinson distinguished himself as a Trump critic, calling for the former president to drop out of the race after being indicted by a New York grand jury. After Trump was indicted by a federal grand jury for mishandling classified documents, Hutchinson criticized other Republican presidential candidates for saying they would pardon Trump if elected. He also rebuked allegations made by fellow Republicans that the Department of Justice had been &quot;weaponized&quot; against Trump. Hutchinson came out against the 
decision by the Republican National Committee (RNC) to require candidates wishing to participate in the primary debate to sign a loyalty pledge saying they would support the eventual Republican nominee, stating he would not vote for Trump if convicted on federal charges. Because of the debate conditions, Hutchinson organized a meeting between RNC officials and one of his staffers. The staffer, on behalf of Hutchinson, requested that the RNC amend the debate requirements to accommodate Hutchinson&#x27;s concerns; the RNC rejected his request. Hutchinson ultimately decided to sign the pledge, but when candidates were asked during the debate to raise their hand if they would still support Trump as the party&#x27;s nominee if he were convicted, he and Chris Christie were the only ones not to do so.

Hutchinson failed to make any of the other debates, with his poll numbers remaining at around one percent nationally. He would drop out of the race on January 16, the day after he earned only 191 votes in the Iowa caucuses, fewer votes than every other candidate, including little-known candidate Ryan Binkley. Following Hutchinson&#x27;s withdrawal, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) issued a statement mocking Hutchinson&#x27;s campaign, &quot;This news comes as a shock to those of us who could’ve sworn he had already dropped out.&quot; The statement elicited condemnation from anti-Trump conservatives who chastised the DNC for attacking someone who shared their opposition to Trump. White House Chief of Staff Jeff Zients later called Hutchinson to apologize for the DNC&#x27;s statement. Days before the New Hampshire primary, Hutchinson endorsed Nikki Haley. After Trump won the primaries, Hutchinson said he planned to write-in a name for president in the general election, refusing to vote for Trump or Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.

==Personal life==
Hutchinson has four children with his wife, Susan Burrell.

Hutchinson&#x27;s older brother, Tim, preceded him as U.S. representative from Arkansas&#x27; 3rd congressional district and served as a U.S. senator from 1997 to 2003 before being defeated for reelection by Arkansas Attorney General Mark Pryor, a Democrat, in 2002. Asa and Tim Hutchinson are both graduates of Bob Jones University. Tim Hutchinson&#x27;s identical twin sons, Jeremy and Timothy Chad Hutchinson, were the first twins to serve together in the Arkansas General Assembly, both as members of the House of Representatives. Asa Hutchinson is the brother-in-law of former Arkansas state senator Kim Hendren, who in 1958 married his sister Marylea Hutchinson. Arkansas district 2 state senator Jim Hendren of Sulphur Springs is Hutchinson&#x27;s nephew.

<doc id="1184222" wikidata="Q2029911" url="?curid=1184222" title="Professional services">
<text>Professional services are occupations in the service sector requiring special training in liberal arts and pure sciences education or professional development education. Some professional services, such as architects, accountants, engineers, doctors, and lawyers require the practitioner to hold professional degrees or licenses and possess specific skills. Other professional services involve providing specialist business support to businesses of all sizes and in all sectors; this can include tax advice, supporting a company with accounting, IT services, public relations services or providing management services.

== Definition ==
Many industry groups have been used for academic research, while looking at professional services firms, making a clear definition hard to attain. Some work has been directed at better defining professional service firms (PSF). In particular, Von Nordenflycht generated a taxonomy of professional service firms, defining four types:

# Classic PSFs (e.g. law and accounting firms): characterized by a high knowledge intensity, a professionalized workforce, and low capital intensity
# Professional campuses (e.g. hospitals): characterized by high knowledge intensity, a professionalized workforce, and high capital intensity
# Neo-PSFs (e.g. management consultants): characterized by high knowledge intensity and a low capital intensity
# Technology developers (e.g. R&amp;D firms, biotechs): characterized by high knowledge intensity and a high capital intensity

Frameworks such as this aid the ability of managers and academics to better understand how such firms manage themselves and how to judge benchmark practices.

== Example occupations ==
There is no definitive list of occupations in professional services, but examples include the following:

* Accountant
* Actuary
* Appraiser
* Architect
* Consultant
* Doctor
* Evaluator
* Engineer
* Financial planner
* Geoscientist
* Investment manager
* IT consultant
* Inspector
* Lawyer
* Management consultant
* Marketing
* Public Relations
* Social Workers
* Supply Chain Management
* Training and development
* Urban Planner
* Veterinary physician
== Provision ==
Professional services can be provided by sole proprietors, partnerships or corporations. A person providing the service can often be described as a consultant. In law, barristers normally organise themselves into chambers. Businesses in other industries, such as banks and retailers, can employ individuals or teams to offer professional services for their customers. Major cities such as London and New York are leading global centres for professional services firms.

== Marketing ==
The marketing and selection of professional-service providers may depend on skill, knowledge, experience, reputation, capacity, ethics, and creativity. Large corporations may have a formal procurement process for engaging professional services. Prices for services, even within the same field, may vary greatly. Professional-service providers may offer fixed rates for specific work, charge in relation to the number or seniority of people engaged, or charge in relation to the success or profit generated by the project.

<doc id="1184237" wikidata="Q1006561" url="?curid=1184237" title="Decelea">
<text>Decelea (, ), &quot;Dekéleia&quot;), was a deme and ancient village in northern Attica serving as a trade route connecting Euboea with Athens, Greece. It was situated near the entrance of the eastern pass across Mount Parnes, which leads from the northeastern part of the Athenian plain to Oropus, and from thence both to Tanagra on the one hand, and to Delium and Chalcis on the other. It was situated about 120 stadia from Athens, and the same distance from the frontiers of Boeotia. It was visible from Athens and from its heights the ships entering the harbour of Piraeus were visible as well.

==History==
It was originally one of the twelve cities of Attica. The historian Herodotus reports that Decelea&#x27;s citizens enjoyed a special relationship with Sparta. The Spartans took control of Decelea around 413 BC. With advice from Alcibiades in 415 BC, the former Athenian general wanted on Athenian charges of religious crimes, the Spartans and their allies, under king Agis II, fortified Decelea as a major military post in the later stage of the Peloponnesian War, giving them control of rural Attica and cutting off the primary land route for food imports. This was a serious blow to Athens, which was concurrently being beaten in the Sicilian Expedition it had undertaken in the west. 

The Spartan military presence in Attica, in a deviation from previous policy where Spartans returned home for the winter months, was maintained year-round. Spartan patrols through the Attic countryside strained the Athenian cavalry and curtailed the ability of Athens to continue exploiting the Laurium silver mines in southeastern Attica that were an important source of income. Thucydides estimated that 20,000 slaves, many of them skilled workers, escaped to Decelea, from 413 until the close of the Peloponnesian War in 404 BC. Xenophon reports briefly on these events.

Scholars have identified the site of the Spartan fort as the site of Palaiokastro, now marked by the tombs of the Greek royal family, in the Tatoi national forest east of Mt. Parnitha. A substantial rubble circuit wall (about 2 m wide) has been traced, with Classical rooftiles and other evidence of occupation. This location fits the description of Thucydides as midway between Athens and Boeotia, visible from Athens and commanding the plain of Attica. The site controls what was once a major ancient road, usable by carts, connecting Athens to the grain port of Oropus.

<doc id="1184242" wikidata="Q133698" url="?curid=1184242" title="Jo Whiley">
<text>Johanne Whiley-Morton (born 4 July 1965), better known by her professional name Jo Whiley, is an English radio DJ and television presenter. She was the host of the long-running weekday later weekend &quot;Jo Whiley Show&quot; on BBC Radio 1. She currently presents her weekday evening Radio 2 show. She is also the main presenter for the BBC&#x27;s Glastonbury Festival coverage.

==Early life and education==
Whiley was born in Northampton to Martin, an electrician, and Christine, a postmistress. She attended Campion School at Bugbrooke, near Northampton and then studied applied languages at Brighton Polytechnic. She swam competitively for Northamptonshire.

==Career==

===Early career===
In Whiley&#x27;s final year of her degree, still unsure of what she wanted to do, a conversation with a lecturer led to a job with BBC Radio Sussex on a show called &quot;Turn It Up&quot;. It allowed anyone to get on the radio and required Whiley to attend shows and interview the musicians.

After a year, Whiley left for City University London for a one-year course on radio journalism. After writing many letters, she got a job as a researcher on WPFM, a BBC Radio 4 youth culture and music show. When the presenters Terry Christian and Gary Crowley left, she took over, gaining her first presenting role. She then moved into television, firstly at British Satellite Broadcasting where she produced and presented the indie show, and then at Channel 4 where she worked as a researcher on &quot;The Word&quot;, with her friend Zoe Ball. Whiley moved on to BBC Radio 1 from September 1993 until March 2011, during the heyday of Britpop with bands such as Blur and Oasis. She hosted a weekday evening show called &quot;The Evening Session&quot; with Steve Lamacq, which was oriented towards less-mainstream, non-dance music. Whiley presented her own show on Saturday afternoon in late 1995.

From 1995 to 1998, Whiley was a regular guest presenter on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, initially co-presenting with fellow DJ Steve Lamacq before flying solo and alternating with Zoe Ball and Jayne Middlemiss. The three women are referred to by the &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; website as the &#x27;90s girls&#x27;, as between them they presented nearly every show of 1997. However, the only occasion when all three presented together was on Christmas Day 1997. Whiley returned to the show twice between 2005 and 2006 to co-present with lead presenter Fearne Cotton.

On 24 November 2002, Whiley became the first female presenter of the Radio 1 Chart Show.

In July 2009, Whiley published her autobiography, &quot;My World in Motion&quot;, on CD through Random House Audiobooks.

===&quot;The Jo Whiley Show&quot; on BBC Radio 1===
From February 1997, Whiley had a weekday lunchtime show, called &quot;The Jo Whiley Show&quot; and later &quot;The Lunchtime Social&quot;. This included elements of the evening show, such as tour dates and occasional live &#x27;sessions&#x27; at Maida Vale Studios while working within the restrictions of Radio 1&#x27;s daytime schedule. When Simon Mayo left BBC Radio 1 for BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Radio 2 in February 2001, Whiley&#x27;s show was moved to a mid-morning slot.

In July 2008, &quot;The Jo Whiley Show&quot; was fined £75,000 for misleading listeners for an incident involving a member of BBC staff posing as a member of the public taking part in a competition. The BBC claim Whiley herself was unaware of the deception at the time of its broadcast.

Jo Whiley&#x27;s weekday show ended broadcasting in September 2009 as part of a major shake-up of Radio 1&#x27;s weekday schedule. The shake-up saw Greg James move to the afternoon slot (was occupied by Edith Bowman) and Fearne Cotton move to Whiley&#x27;s slot. Her final weekday programme took place on 18 September 2009.

Following weekdays, the Jo Whiley Show was moved to weekends between 1pm to 4pm. As with her former weekday show, it still featured Live Lounge performances from visiting artists, as well as three new features: Jo&#x27;s Road Trip, Top of the Shops, and SpellStar. Her last show on BBC Radio 1 was on 27 March 2011.

===BBC Radio 2===

Since August 2009, Whiley has been an occasional stand in presenter for Claudia Winkleman on BBC Radio 2. She was first heard on the network on Friday 21 August and made subsequent appearances on 2 October, 6 November, 27 November and 18 December 2009.

In March 2010, it was announced that Whiley and former BBC Radio 1 presenter Steve Lamacq would present a one-off Evening Session (the first in 13 years) on Good Friday (2 April) for BBC Radio 6 Music. Presented another Evening Session on 28 January 2011. After being an occasional stand-in presenter on BBC Radio 2, Whiley began presenting &quot;In Concert&quot; on Thursday evenings in April 2010.

On 1 February 2011, it was announced that Whiley would be leaving BBC Radio 1 after 17 years of broadcasting to join BBC Radio 2, where she would present an evening show from Mondays to Thursdays starting on 4 April 2011, replacing &quot;The Radcliffe and Maconie Show&quot;. Radcliffe and Maconie would, in turn, move to BBC Radio 6 Music while Whiley&#x27;s Radio 1 show would be taken over by Huw Stephens. Since 2011, she has co-hosted Radio 2 Live in Hyde Park.

In March 2012, the BBC announced that as part of the broadcaster&#x27;s celebration of the 20th anniversary of Britpop, Whiley and Lamacq would present a week of &quot;Evening Sessions&quot; on Radio 2 from 7 April.

In January 2018 it was announced that Whiley would join daytime on a drivetime show with Simon Mayo. This is the first time a woman had co-presented a Radio 2 daytime show in 20 years. On 22 October that year, the station announced that Mayo would be leaving Radio 2 after a backlash against the change, with Whiley moving back to an evening slot.

===Television career===

Whiley presents televised coverage of major music festivals, such as the Glastonbury Festival. She also narrated the BBC Three series &quot;Little Angels&quot;. In October 2007 she became a judge on the T4 (Channel 4) show &quot;Orange unsignedAct&quot; which searches for a band trying to get a record deal. Whiley also hosted a music TV show on music channel TMF. From late 1998, Whiley hosted her own music discussion show on Channel 4, called &quot;The Jo Whiley Show&quot;, which ran for four series until late 2001.

On 15 March 2010, Whiley presented an edition of the &quot;Panorama&quot; documentary strand titled &quot;Are the Net Police Coming for You?&quot; in which she looked at the Digital Economy Bill, a proposed new law targeting people who download music illegally from the Internet.

In 2014, Whiley was a contestant on the Children in Need special of Swashbuckle with her daughter Coco.

In July 2021 Whiley was a co-presenter for the BBC&#x27;s coverage of the Hampton Court Garden Festival.

In 2022, The Killers&#x27; singer, Brandon Flowers, dedicated a performance of their song Pressure Machine to her saying &quot;She&#x27;s always sorta championed us ... she&#x27;s said some wonderful things about this song and she&#x27;s requested it tonight&quot; 

==Personal life==
Whiley married music executive Steve Morton in July 1991 in Northampton. The couple live in Towcester, Northamptonshire and have four children.

In October 2014 she was presented with a BASCA Gold Badge award. Whiley is a pescetarian.

In February 2021 Whiley&#x27;s sister Frances, who has learning difficulties and diabetes, was admitted to hospital after testing positive for COVID-19 following an outbreak in her care home. Frances, who is two years younger than Whiley, has Cri du chat genetic syndrome. Whiley publicly campaigned for those in her sister&#x27;s category to receive priority in the COVID-19 vaccination programme roll-out. She repeated the plea during an interview on BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Andrew Marr Show,&quot; on 21 February 2021. On 24 February the government announced that everyone with a registered learning disability would be prioritised for a COVID-19 vaccine.

==Charity work==
Whiley has been a patron of the charity Sibs, since 2021, a charity that supports the brothers and sisters of disabled children and adults. She is also a celebrity ambassador for Mencap, a UK charity that works to support people with learning disabilities. She hosts the Little Noise Sessions concert in aid of Mencap. She is also a supporter of Tommy&#x27;s – The Baby Charity. Whiley is the patron of the cri du chat syndrome support group.

On 19 March 2014, Whiley undertook a challenge for &quot;Sport Relief&quot;, in which she walked, jogged and ran on a treadmill for 26 hours, with a five-minute rest break each hour. She did this to raise money for the Sport Relief appeal that same week. While completing the challenge she hosted two radio shows. The achievement impressed members of the band Coldplay, who donated £260,000 to Sport Relief.

<doc id="1184251" wikidata="Q6729210" url="?curid=1184251" title="Maelstrom (role-playing game)">
<text>Maelstrom is a role-playing game by Alexander Scott, originally published in 1984 by Puffin Books as a single soft cover book. &quot;Maelstrom&quot; was published under Puffin&#x27;s &quot;Adventure Gamebooks&quot; banner, along with the &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; series, &quot;The Cretan Chronicles&quot; trilogy, and the &quot;Starlight Adventures&quot; series. &quot;Maelstrom&quot; was written while Scott was a teenager in school. The game is set in a 16th to 17th century British setting – the Tudor Period – although the rules can be adapted to other locations or time periods. Firearms (readily available in Europe at this time) are conspicuously absent from the setting, mentioned only in passing in the initial rulebook.

&quot;Maelstrom&quot; has been republished as a PDF in 2008 by Arion Games, under license from Puffin Books. Arion Games also published seven supplementary rulebooks and resources such as &quot;The Maelstrom Companion&quot;, the &quot;Beggars&#x27; Companion&quot;, and several modules and settings resources. These are all available for online purchase at RPGNow.com in PDF format (see external links, below). &quot;The Maelstrom Companion&quot; provides guidelines for the in-game purchase and use of period firearms, as well as new livings and other developments.

Arion Games have also published adaptions of the &quot;Maelstrom&quot; rules for use in other settings. These include &quot;Maelstrom Domesday&quot; (2013), set in England after the Norman Conquest; &quot;Maelstrom Gothic&quot; (2017), set in Victorian England, and &quot;Maelstrom Rome&quot; (2019) set in the Roman Empire during the reign of the Emperor Claudius.

== Combat ==
== Wounds and healing ==
Characters can easily end up with wounds that would last for months. They can suffer the permanent loss of digits, or limbs. Using the advanced rules, a character may well collapse from particular types of mortal wounds, or in combat from sheer exhaustion, especially if wearing heavy armour. They could suffer cuts, bruises or a variety of serious injuries from their opponents&#x27; (or their own) weapons.

In &quot;Maelstrom&quot;, wounds are recorded separately and heal in parallel. Damage is rated on a numerical scale, with a knife doing 1–6 damage for instance. When the sum of a character&#x27;s wounds exceeds his or her Endurance, that character falls unconscious.

Characters heal at the rate of 1 point per week assuming bed rest (and 1 point per month otherwise); this rate is per wound. A character suffering a series of minor wounds will recover much more quickly than one receiving a single significant wound. Treatments from a Doctor, Herbalist, or a Barber-Surgeon will increase the rate of healing – or possibly decrease it if a roll vs skill is critically failed.

== Experience ==

Experience rolls are on percentile dice and are made against a specific attribute when the character succeeds in an area relevant to that attribute. When a successful experience roll is made the attribute increases by one point (indicating increased ability in this area). Thus, as characters become more experienced they have progressively more difficulty increasing attributes. As the author notes, it is less likely that an experienced character will learn a new trick too often, whereas someone who has no experience in a particular area may well learn something each time they exercise a skill.

== Aging ==

Age is a very important characteristic to a character in &quot;Maelstrom&quot;. All &quot;Maelstrom&quot; characters start at age 14. As part of building a character the player then chooses one or more livings. The character spends a number of years training in each living and is normally assumed to have fully completed all training at the start of the campaign.

Age impacts the maximum values that each attribute may have. An inexperienced character may thus have low initial values but great potential while an older character with experience may actually find that their attributes are limited by their age maximum, and continue to decline as they get older. A character starting with many livings will be older than other characters and will thus never achieve the lofty attribute scores a younger character could achieve. Older characters are also more susceptible to disease.

== Livings ==

Professions (called &quot;Livings&quot;) in &quot;Maelstrom&quot; are not like the rigid class systems seen in many other RPGs from the 1980s. A character may have one, two, or more livings as long as the referee agrees (a player normally being expected to provide a plausible explanation for the character having studied so many areas, and having to spend a number of years training in each). In some cases a character may be expected to refrain from using skills previously acquired on entering a new living. One example noted in the rule book is that of a mercenary becoming a priest and being expected to eschew previous experience with weapons.

Following is a partial list showing a range of the Livings a character may choose from, from both the core rulebook and the &quot;Maelstrom Companion&quot;. (Some livings are divided into sub-sets of a main category, this is denoted by parentheses.)

* Noble
* Professional (Clerk, Doctor, Architect, Scrivener, etc.)
* Priest / member of religious order / Pastor
* Craftsman (Armourer, Bladesmith, Tailor, Painter, Mason, Engraver, etc.)
* Trader (Butcher, Fishmonger, Vintner, Grocer, etc.)
* Mercenary
* Sailor
* Hunter
* Rogue (Beggar, Thief, Burglar, Assassin, Trickster, or no specialty)
* Mage
* Travelling player (Minstrel, Musician, Actor)
* Herbalist
* Barber-Surgeon
* Alchemist
* Servant
* Labourer

== Magic system ==
Mages in 16th and 17th century Europe are seen as practitioners of ancient magical arts. They are not witches although the authorities often regard as such. Mages must keep their identities hidden from the Church and secular authority, and so need to also have a respectable profession.

No list of spells is provided, a mage can attempt to cast any spell that is within the areas of magic understood by the character. Mages can specialise, which provides improved capability in some areas or they may choose to study only certain areas and be unable to cast spells unrelated to their area of study.

When casting a spell Mages contact the &quot;Maelstrom&quot; to warp reality. The more that reality would need to change in order to fulfil the spell the more difficult the spell is to cast. Spells are graded by the referee on a scale of 1 to 5 with 5 (representing events that are impossible) being the most difficult. Inexperienced mages will typically be only able to cast spells of grade 1 or 2 and even the most experienced mages will have difficulty with a spell of grade 5. Failure to successfully cast a spell can be dangerous with the severity of the consequences growing with the grade of the spell.

With an optional rule in place, excessive use of magic, particularly in a single area, can cause instabilities in reality.

The Living of mage is rare as well as it is outlawed. In &quot;Maelstrom&quot;, a campaign success is possible without a single player or non-player character mage in the party. Several game sessions might take place between an appearance of a non-player character mage. The game rules allowed the option of playing the entire campaign without any supernatural element, if desired.

==Reception==
A review by Graeme Davis &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine described the game as &quot;overall [...] an interesting and elegantly-designed game. Players of fantasy rpgs will find a host of immensely useful information on &#x27;real&#x27; late-Medieval life and society which could be a great help in developing campaign backgrounds, especially for city adventures.&quot;

<doc id="1184256" wikidata="Q3480255" url="?curid=1184256" title="Patience sorting">
<text>In computer science, patience sorting is a sorting algorithm inspired by, and named after, the card game patience. A variant of the algorithm efficiently computes the length of a longest increasing subsequence in a given array.

==Overview==
The algorithm&#x27;s name derives from a simplified variant of the patience card game. The game begins with a shuffled deck of cards. The cards are dealt one by one into a sequence of piles on the table, according to the following rules.

# Initially, there are no piles. The first card dealt forms a new pile consisting of the single card.
# Each subsequent card is placed on the leftmost existing pile whose top card has a value greater than or equal to the new card&#x27;s value, or to the right of all of the existing piles, thus forming a new pile.
# When there are no more cards remaining to deal, the game ends.

This card game is turned into a two-phase sorting algorithm, as follows. Given an array of elements from some totally ordered domain, consider this array as a collection of cards and simulate the patience sorting game. When the game is over, recover the sorted sequence by repeatedly picking off the minimum visible card; in other words, perform a -way merge of the piles, each of which is internally sorted.

===Analysis===
The first phase of patience sort, the card game simulation, can be implemented to take comparisons in the worst case for an -element input array: there will be at most piles, and by construction, the top cards of the piles form an increasing sequence from left to right, so the desired pile can be found by binary search. The second phase, the merging of piles, can be done in formula_1 time as well using a priority queue.

When the input data contain natural &quot;runs&quot;, i.e., non-decreasing subarrays, then performance can be strictly better. In fact, when the input array is already sorted, all values form a single pile and both phases run in time. The average-case complexity is still : any uniformly random sequence of values will produce an expected number of formula_2 piles, which take formula_3 time to produce and merge.

An evaluation of the practical performance of patience sort is given by Chandramouli and Goldstein, who show that a naive version is about ten to twenty times slower than a state-of-the-art quicksort on their benchmark problem. They attribute this to the relatively small amount of research put into patience sort, and develop several optimizations that bring its performance to within a factor of two of that of quicksort.

If values of cards are in the range , there is an efficient implementation with formula_1 worst-case running time for putting the cards into piles, relying on a Van Emde Boas tree.

==Relations to other problems==
Patience sorting is closely related to a card game called Floyd&#x27;s game. This game is very similar to the game sketched earlier:

# The first card dealt forms a new pile consisting of the single card.
# Each subsequent card is placed on &quot;some&quot; existing pile whose top card has a value no less than the new card&#x27;s value, or to the right of all of the existing piles, thus forming a new pile.
# When there are no more cards remaining to deal, the game ends.

The object of the game is to finish with as few piles as possible. The difference with the patience sorting algorithm is that there is no requirement to place a new card on the &quot;leftmost&quot; pile where it is allowed. Patience sorting constitutes a greedy strategy for playing this game.

Aldous and Diaconis suggest defining 9 or fewer piles as a winning outcome for , which happens with approximately 5% probability.

===Algorithm for finding a longest increasing subsequence===
First, execute the sorting algorithm as described above. The number of piles is the length of a longest subsequence. Whenever a card is placed on top of a pile, put a back-pointer to the top card in the previous pile (that, by assumption, has a lower value than the new card has). In the end, follow the back-pointers from the top card in the last pile to recover a decreasing subsequence of the longest length; its reverse is an answer to the longest increasing subsequence algorithm.

S. Bespamyatnikh and M. Segal give a description of an efficient implementation of the algorithm, incurring no additional asymptotic cost over the sorting one (as the back-pointers storage, creation and traversal require linear time and space). They further show how to report &quot;all&quot; the longest increasing subsequences from the same resulting data structures.

==History==
Patience sorting was named by C. L. Mallows, who attributed its invention to A.S.C. Ross in the early 1960s.
According to Aldous and Diaconis, patience sorting was first recognized as an algorithm to compute the longest increasing subsequence length by Hammersley. A.S.C. Ross and independently Robert W. Floyd recognized it as a sorting algorithm. Initial analysis was done by Mallows. Floyd&#x27;s game was developed by Floyd in correspondence with Donald Knuth.

==Use==
The patience sorting algorithm can be applied to process control. Within a series of measurements, the existence of a long increasing subsequence can be used as a trend marker. A 2002 article in SQL Server magazine includes a SQL implementation, in this context, of the patience sorting algorithm for the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

<text>Sreeni Pattathanam (born 10 June 1956) is a rationalist, activist, and writer from Kerala, India. He was born in the Pattathanam area of Kollam City in the Indian state of Kerala. Pattathanam was the editor of &quot;Ranarekha&quot;, a monthly in Malayalam, which ceased publication in the 1980s. He started publishing another monthly in Malayalam called &quot;Yukthirajyam&quot;. This journal is the official journal of the organization, &quot;Bharatheeya Yukthivadi Sangham&quot; (Rationalist Association of India). He was also the secretary of the Kerala state branch of Indian Rationalist Association. Pattathanam later left IRA and started, with like-minded people, another rationalist association, Bharathiya Yukthivadi Sangham. He is the vice-chairman of the National Level Rationalist Organization, RAI, Rationalist Association of India that was established in 1930. RAI is one of the founding members of the International Humanist and Ethical Union (IHEU), based in London. www.iheu.org

==On Mata Amritanandamayi ==

Sreeni Pattathanam authored a book, (), which became controversial for the alleged derogatory remarks by the author about Matha Amritanandamayi.

The book contains critical comments about Mata Amritanandamayi, Mata&#x27;s personal life, and sexual behaviour. The book also has references to court records, newspaper reports and quotations from some literary figures, and attempts to refute the Matha&#x27;s claims to miracles and contends that there have been many suspicious deaths in and around her ashram, which he says need police investigation.

Some of deaths which the author alleges as murders are:

# The suicide of Subhagan alias Sunilkumar, brother of Amrithananda Mayi. The author alleges that Subhagan was beaten to death for opposing the activities of his sister.
# Vellappillil Narayanan Kutty of Kodungallur, an inmate of the Amrithanandamayi Ashram, died on 4 April 1990, due to internal hemorrhage as per postmortem report. He was an employee of Government Bureau of Economics and Statistics, Trichur, Kerala. (&quot;The New Indian Express&quot;, 19 April 1990, Kochi, Kerala, India and &quot;Janayugam&quot; a Malayalam daily 22 April 1990).
# Pradeep Kumar, a relative of Amrithananda Mayi, died on 16 August 1994 under mysterious circumstances.
# Rumdhur, a historian and inmate of the ashram, died on 15 July 2000 within the precincts of the ashram. The ashram authorities did not intimate his death to his friends or his relatives.
# Ramanatha Iyer of Mumbai allegedly committed suicide by jumping from the 12th floor of Amrithanandamayi Math at Vallikkavu on 5 September 2001. (&quot;The New Indian Express&quot;, 6 September 2001, Kochi, Kerala)

Advocate Ajan, a devotee of Mata Amrithanandamayi, found these allegations objectionable and asked Kerala government to prosecute the author for the derogatory and defamatory contents in the book. Despite pressure from the math and devotees, Kerala government refused to prosecute the author, but allowed the devotee to file a case for prosecution (government permission is required to move private prosecution in similar cases). There were public protests by international humanists, Indian rationalists, writers, and the youth wing of the Indian Communist Party (Marxist) in which the author was an activist, which yielded results.

However, in 2004, the Kerala State Government sanctioned criminal prosecution of Patthathanam, the owner of the publishing company, and the printer of the book on grounds that religious sentiments had been offended and for the libelous statements in the book. The order followed directions from the Kerala High Court to the Home Department for considering an application by T.K. Ajan, a resident of the Mata Amṛtānandamayī Math. CPI leader Thengamam Balakrishnan protested the move against Pattathanam.

<text>Iain McIntyre is an Australian writer, musician and community radio broadcaster, currently based in Melbourne. From the 1980s onwards he has published books and zines, including the &quot;How to Make Trouble and Influence People&quot; series.

==1980s==
In the late 1980s he became involved in environmental and left activism in Perth, Western Australia where he also co-edited his first publication Freakzine and presented a number of music shows for 6UVS/RTRfm.

==1990s==
In 1992 McIntyre moved to Melbourne, Victoria where he continued his involvement in forest defence, squatting and other campaigns and also began co-editing the Melbourne-based fanzine &quot;Woozy&quot; with Laura MacFarlane. &quot;Woozy&quot; ran for the best part of a decade and brought DIY currents around music, politics and comics together in one publication. 22 issues, involving over 100 contributors, were produced and more than 20 benefits and launches held.

During the 1990s McIntyre began contributing to, and later co-hosted, Community Radio 3CR&#x27;s &#x27;Squatters and Unwaged Workers Airwaves&#x27; (SUWA) show. He finished his involvement with the program in the late 2000s, but has continued to produce music and history series for the station since.

In 1996 the first volume of McIntyre&#x27;s &quot;How to Make Trouble and Influence People&quot; series, which documented Australian pranks, hoaxes and political mischief making, was published under the pseudonym of the Question Mark Collective. Two sequels followed, &quot;How To Stop Whining and Start Living&quot; in 1999, and &quot;Revenge of the Troublemaker&quot; in 2003. In 2009, Breakdown Press collected all three of the &quot;How To Make Trouble And Influence People&quot; books into a single volume featuring additional material and interviews with activists and pranksters including John Safran, Uncle Kevin Buzzacott, The Chaser team, Pauline Pantsdown and The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence. In 2013 PM Press published a new edition of the book..

McIntyre played bass, guitar and sang in a number of bands in Perth, Melbourne and London during the 1990s including The Stoned Posers, the Sea Haggs, Felafel, the Dennis Lillees, The Barnacle Sisters, and the Authentics. In 1996 he toured Europe as a member of Dragster and ninetynine, later forming the first line up of Kokoshkar in London, a band which continued on in Australia until 1999. In 1999 McIntyre rejoined ninetynine and has played on all their subsequent recordings and at the majority of their Australian shows, but did not join them on their European and US tours.

==2000s==
During the 2000s, McIntyre played bass and shouted in garage band Thee Stag Knights as well as with The Hatchetmen/The Hatchets. 2007 saw him release the A Warning CD/DVD, a &quot;lost 1970s dystopian film&quot; constructed from various period documentaries. A Warning featured a soundtrack primarily performed on vintage analogue synthesizers and included vocals and additional instrumentation from Kirsty Stegwazi, Van Walker, Cat Hope and members of Sir, Scarecrow Tiggy, Tarantula and other Melbourne acts. The same year saw him tour Europe with Naomi Evans as part of anarcho-casio pop duo the Kleber Claux Memorial Singers.
Since 2003, McIntyre has run Homebrew Press which has self-published a selection of his books and pamphlets. These have included &quot;Disturbing the Peace&quot;, a collection of pieces on Australian radical history, &quot;Always Look on the Bright Side of Life: The AIDEX &#x27;91 Story&quot;, an oral history of the 1991 Canberra anti-arms protest, and &quot;Lock Out The Landlords: Anti-Eviction Resistance, 1929–36&quot;. In 2010 he hosted a history walk based partially based on the &quot;Lock Out The Landlords&quot; pamphlet around the inner-Melbourne suburb of Brunswick, which was also podcast as part of the People&#x27;s Tour series.

In 2004 3CR published &quot;Wild About You: Tales from the Australian Rock Underground, 1963–68&quot;, a book which McIntyre co-wrote with Ian Marks. A tribute CD featuring Melbourne acts covering the mid-sixties bands chronicled in the book was recorded at 3CR, and a significantly expanded version of the book, also featuring New Zealand garage and R&amp;B bands, was published by Verse Chorus Press in 2010. In 2006 Wakefield Press published a collection McIntyre edited entitled &quot;Tomorrow Is Today: Australia in the Psychedelic Era, 1966–70&quot;. A subsequent tribute CD, once more recorded at 3CR, was released and a festival held in the same year.

In 2005 Iain produced the &quot;Australian Troublemakers&#x27; Calendar&quot;, which included a radical Australian date for each day of the year, as a benefit for the SUWA show. The following year 3CR financed a higher-end version and a collective was formed to produce and nationally distribute the &quot;Seeds of Dissent&quot; &quot;Calendar&quot;, which came out until 2009.

2008 saw the release of an oral history, &quot;Always Look on the Bright Side of Life: The AIDEX ’91 Story&quot;, which covered Australian protests in 1989, 1991, and 2008 against weapons fairs.

==2010s==
Since 2011 McIntyre has co-curated the Australian Museum of Squatting on-line archive which collects together radical photos, articles, stories and ephemera related to squatting movements. 2012 saw Ledatape publish McIntyre&#x27;s &quot;Sticking It to the Man: Pop, Protest and Black Fiction of the Counterculture&quot;, a collection of book jackets and reviews of novels published between 1964 and 1975. In the same year McIntyre helped compile the &quot;Down Under Nuggets: Original Australian Artyfacts 1965-1967&quot; CD compilation with David Laing and Ian Marks.

2011 also saw McIntyre complete a Masters thesis on the topic of Australian peace, environmental and social movements’ involvement in the AIDEX anti-arms fair blockades of 1989 and 1991.

Expanding on his 2012 Leda Tape collection, in 2017 McIntyre co-edited the first of three books with Andrew Nette about post-war pulp and paperback fiction, &quot;Girl Gangs, Biker Boys, and Real Cool Cats: Pulp Fiction and Youth Culture, 1950 to 1980,&quot; published by PM Press. 2019 saw the release of the second book in the series, &quot;Sticking It to the Man: Revolution and Counterculture in Pulp and Popular Fiction, 1950 to 1980&quot;. In 2021 the third, &quot;Dangerous Visions and New Worlds: Radical Science Fiction, 1950 to 1985&quot; was released, subsequently winning the 2022 Aurealis Conveners Award For Excellence and the 2022 Locus Magazine Award for Non-Fiction. It was also nominated for the Hugo Best Related Work Award and the British Fantasy Best Non-Fiction Award. In February 2022 a symposium about the book, radical politics and sci-fi was held by the City Lights Foundation featuring panelists including Marge Piercy, Samuel Delany, Michael Moorcock, adrienne maree brown, Terry Bisson, Annalee Newitz, Alexis Pauline Gumbs, Vandana Singh, and Cory Doctorow.

In 2018 PM Press published an anthology of American hobo literature and songs from 1879 to 1941, entitled &quot;On the Fly!&quot; which McIntyre had collected and edited. In the same year he completed his PhD about the history and practice of environmental blockading in Australia, Canada and the United States, for which he received the University of Melbourne’s Denis Wettenhall prize for best thesis on an aspect of Australian history. An adaption of the thesis was subsequently published by Routledge in 2021 as &quot;Environmental Blockades: Obstructive Direct Action and the History of the Environmental Movement&quot;.

McIntyre has worked with the online Commons Social Change Library since 2019, regularly contributing resources, case studies, interviews, and chronologies on topics such as school strikes, environmental blockades, creative activism, and other aspects of current and past social and labour movement practice. He has also been involved in researching, narrating and producing history walks, such as one covering unemployed activism in Brunswick during the Great Depression, and a project funded by Melbourne’s Darebin council to document music venues in the area from the 1950s to the present.

<doc id="1184289" wikidata="Q797990" url="?curid=1184289" title="Babysitting">
<text>Babysitting is temporarily caring for a child. Babysitting can be a paid job for all ages; however, it is best known as a temporary activity for early teenagers who are not yet eligible for employment in the general economy. It provides autonomy from parental control and dispensable income, as well as an introduction to the techniques of childcare. It emerged as a social role for teenagers in the 1920s, and became especially important in suburban America in the 1950s and 1960s, when small children were abundant. It stimulated an outpouring of folk culture in the form of urban legends, pulp novels, and horror films.

==Overall==
In developed countries, most babysitters are high-school or college students (age 16+). Some adults have in-home childcare as well. They are not babysitters but professional childcare providers and early-childhood educators. The work for babysitters also varies from watching a sleeping child, changing diapers, playing games, and preparing meals, to teaching the child to read or even drive, depending on the agreement between parents and babysitter.

In some countries, various organizations produce courses for babysitters, many focusing on child safety and first aid appropriate for infants and children; these educational programs can be provided at local hospitals and schools. Different activities are needed for babies and toddlers. It is beneficial for babysitters to understand toddler developmental milestones to plan for necessary activities. As paid employees, babysitters often require a disclosure or assessment of one&#x27;s criminal record to ward off possible hebephiles, pedophiles, and other unsuitable applicants.

== Babysitting and gender ==

=== History ===

==== 1920s ====
Despite women gaining the right to vote with the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment, traditional gender roles persisted, particularly concerning motherhood and domestic duties. Women&#x27;s main duties included housekeeping, meal preparation, and caring for children. However, by 1920, women were about 20% of the overall workforce, raising concerns about women&#x27;s independence.

Although modern household appliances were marketed as time-saving, rising cleanliness standards meant that mothers spent more time on household chores. While family size decreased, meaning women bore less children, they also dedicated more time to child-rearing, following advice from psychologists like John B. Watson and Arnold Gesell.

Leisure activities gained cultural importance and children enjoyed an abundance of toys and games, but mothers faced criticism for neglecting maternal duties if they also pursued leisure activities.

Historically, girls from various backgrounds had been responsible for childcare duties, but societal changes led to the disappearance of roles like &quot;Little Mothers&quot; and &quot;baby tenders.&quot; These shifts reflected evolving notions of childhood and girlhood because adolescent girls were seen as ill-equipped to care for younger children.

In the 1920s, most middle-class girls did not rely on babysitting for extra income because they received allowances from parents. Only a small percentage of high school girls earned their own spending money independently. However, sociologist Ernest R. Groves warned against hiring high school girls as babysitters, because of fears about their immaturity and lack of responsibility.

==== 1930s ====
The field of babysitting experienced significant growth during the Great Depression partly due to families&#x27; financial constraints, which limited teenagers&#x27; allowances and job opportunities. Many teenage girls became &quot;mother&#x27;s helpers&quot; or &quot;neighborhood helpers.&quot; The rise of youth culture, fostered by increasing high school attendance and consumerism, also played a role.

However, the growing visibility of teenage girls as babysitters also raised concerns among adults. Some adults disapproved of teenage girls spending their earnings, including purchasing makeup. Babysitters were also criticized for prioritizing socializing over their responsibilities, such as chatting on the phone while working.

During the Great Depression, concerns about teenage girls&#x27; behavior and the need for better childcare led to the employment of male &quot;child tenders,&quot; a term used before &quot;babysitter.&quot; Many adolescent boys were among the one million unemployed youth during this time and they took on various jobs to earn money, including household chores and tutoring. Some women preferred hiring boys because they believed that they were more responsible.

Babysitting emerged as a means of socially rehabilitating girlhood. To attract teenage girls to babysitting, it was presented as a pathway to independence and future career success. They suggested that babysitting would equip girls with valuable skills for future careers. Publications like The American Girl magazine and the Camp Fire Girls&#x27; Everygirls magazine framed babysitting as a practical skill for present childcare needs and future homemaking responsibilities. But some believed that girls deserved better job opportunities than childcare. Parents&#x27; expectations were inconsistent and demanding, requiring babysitters to perform various household tasks alongside childcare duties.

Despite legislative efforts like the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which restricted employment for those under seventeen, babysitters were still tasked with chores beyond childcare. Many Depression-era mothers, tasked babysitters with additional household responsibilities. Fifteen to eighteen year old girls were often treated unfairly by employers, who sometimes failed to provide adequate instructions and pay. The American Home magazine criticized parent-employers for their treatment of babysitters. Babysitters were frequently underpaid or not paid at all.

==== 1940s ====
During World War II, the demand for babysitters increased significantly because of the rising birth rate and the working mothers needing childcare. Despite the low pay of twenty-five cents per hour, babysitting offered adolescent girls autonomy.

However, many girls left babysitting for better-paying positions in war production centers and other industries. By 1944, the number of working girls had increased significantly compared to pre-war levels. The scarcity of babysitters made many mothers rely on grandparents for childcare.

Adults during World War II saw babysitting as a solution to social problems, aiming to keep teenage girls off the streets, provide them with respectable roles, and prepare them for future domestic responsibilities. Similar to approaches taken during the Great Depression, wartime authorities promoted babysitting as a patriotic duty, encouraging girls to contribute to the war effort by caring for children. Organizations like the Girl Scouts and Wellesley College offered training in childcare, and magazines like Calling All Girls praised babysitting as a vital wartime service.

However, many teenage girls preferred jobs that offered better pay, status, and social opportunities, leading to a shortage of babysitters. Consequently, younger children, often as young as fourth or fifth graders, ended up assuming caregiving roles in households. Organizations like the Children&#x27;s Aid Society began offering childcare courses to younger girls to address the shortage. These courses taught practical skills like diapering and preparing formula, aiming to assure mothers that young babysitters were reliable sources of childcare.

==== End of the 20th century ====
The introduction of &quot;The Bad Baby-Sitters Handbook&quot; in 1991 marked a shift in sentiment among teenage girls towards babysitting. While experts and fiction often depicted babysitting as empowering, many real-life babysitters disagreed. They faced last-minute calls, low pay, and uncomfortable situations in employers&#x27; homes, including inappropriate behavior. Despite guidance, babysitters struggled to assert themselves and negotiate fair wages.

Girls frequently found themselves underpaid, with boys often earning more for similar tasks. The feminist concept of comparable worth influenced their perception of the value of babysitting work, leading to frustration over gender-based wage disparities. However, many did not discuss payment with their employers or negotiate raises.

Additionally, babysitters often encountered challenges related to employers&#x27; tardiness, cancellations, and lack of important information. While some employers provided emergency contacts and instructions, other babysitters were unprepared.

Babysitters often had positive experiences with considerate parents of well-behaved children, who treated them as professionals rather than just employees. Many employers followed advice from magazines like Working Woman, emphasizing the importance of establishing a good working relationship with babysitters. Some babysitters did not mind last-minute cancellations, seeing them as unexpected breaks or opportunities for socializing with friends.

However, encounters with drunk employers or uncomfortable situations with male employers raised doubts among babysitters about the worth of their job. Instances where employers arrived home intoxicated or exhibited inappropriate behavior made babysitters feel uneasy. Some babysitters encountered sexual advances or harassment from male employers.

Babysitters often faced challenges not only from potential dangers but also from the children they were responsible for. Handling multiple children simultaneously could be overwhelming such as dealing with fights or disagreements between children, dealing with children&#x27;s emotions, especially crying or bedtime resistance, soothing upset children or enforcing bedtime routines, even when children resisted or expressed fears about sleeping alone. Some children engaged in physical or verbal aggression. Boys, in particular, were perceived as more challenging to manage, with some exhibiting dangerous behavior like wielding knives or engaging in destructive activities.Babysitters used various strategies to handle difficult situations, such as sending children to their rooms or threatening to call parents. However, these methods were not always effective, leaving babysitters feeling frustrated or inadequate.

Despite their best efforts, babysitters sometimes faced criticism or blame from parents or social workers, who focused more on describing incidents as &quot;abuse&quot; rather than considering the babysitter&#x27;s intentions or the challenging circumstances they faced. Babysitters often felt pressure to maintain control and appear responsible in the eyes of their employers, fearing they would be seen as inadequate or incapable. Many girls identified with the children they cared for and hesitated to report misbehavior to parents, fearing repercussions. Despite expert advice to communicate openly with parents about challenges faced while babysitting, sitters were reluctant to present a laundry list of wrongdoing. Some employers were understanding, but others automatically believed their children&#x27;s reports, leading to unjust distrust of babysitters.

The portrayal of teenage babysitters in popular culture further reinforced negative stereotypes. In stories like &quot;The Beast and the Babysitter&quot; babysitters were depicted as incompetent or disinterested, reinforcing unfair cultural scripts about female adolescence and babysitting. The reluctance of babysitters to engage fully with their responsibilities perpetuated these stereotypes.

== Babysitting and race ==

=== History ===
Before the Civil War, enslaved Black women cared for the children of white women, even feeding babies using their own breast milk. In 1863, after the Emancipation Proclamation, African American women began to dominate the domestic workforce due to limited employment opportunities and segregation. These women worked long hours for little pay, often receiving hand-me-downs instead. By 1870, over half of employed women were engaged in &quot;domestic and personal service,&quot; reflecting the significant presence of African American women in this sector.

In 1901, a group of domestic workers formed the Working Women&#x27;s Association in response to mistreatment. However, the association disbanded because of low membership. By the 1930s, domestic workers in Chicago faced issues such as employers offering work to the lowest bidder at designated locations known as &quot;slave pens&quot;.

In 1934, Dora Lee Jones established the Domestic Workers Union, advocating for wage and hour laws and inclusion in the Social Security Act. However, in 1935, domestic workers were explicitly excluded from the National Labor Relations Act, which protects employees&#x27; rights to form unions. The Fair Labor Standards Act passed in 1938, introduced minimum wage and overtime pay, but domestic workers were excluded.

In 1964, the Civil Rights Act prohibited employment discrimination, but most domestic workers were not covered as it applied only to employers with 15 or more employees. Similarly, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 protected older workers but excluded many domestic workers. Amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1974 provided protections like minimum wage and overtime pay, but those caring for the elderly or children were again excluded.

Currently, 20% of childcare workers are Black women.

=== The &quot;mammy&quot; stereotype ===
During the post-Civil War era and the Jim Crow period, the mammy stereotype surfaced as one of the most pervasive and enduring images of Black domestic workers. Portrayed prominently in popular culture, such as in 1939&#x27;s &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, the mammy caricature depicted Black women in domestic servitude roles. They were typically portrayed as kind-hearted, overweight, and outspoken. This stereotype romanticized the Antebellum South and ignored the actual experiences of Black women and domestic workers.

== State and federal laws (21st century) ==
In 2007, the Supreme Court case Long Island Care at Home Ltd. v. Coke highlighted the lack of overtime pay entitlement for domestic worker Evelyn Coke, despite her extensive hours of labor. This case underscored the challenges faced by domestic workers regarding fair compensation.

Also in 2007, the National Domestic Workers Alliance (NDWA) became a leading advocate for domestic workers&#x27; rights, aiming to establish a domestic workers&#x27; bill of rights. This began in New York State and resulted in the signing of the New York Domestic Workers Bill of Rights into law in 2010.

In 2011, the International Labor Organization established Fair Labor Laws to protect domestic workers globally, although the United States has not ratified this convention. Local initiatives emerged to address these issues such as in 2014 when Chicago implemented its first minimum wage ordinance, explicitly including domestic workers.

In 2016, Illinois passed the Domestic Worker Bill of Rights following a five-year campaign by the Illinois Domestic Workers Coalition. Additionally, Cook County passed a minimum wage law covering domestic workers.

By 2019, nine states had enacted legislation granting labor rights to domestic workers. On July 15, 2019, U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris and U.S. Representative Pramila Jayapal introduced the Domestic Workers Bill of Rights at the federal level. This bill aims to ensure the rights and protections of domestic workers nationwide, but it has not yet passed into law.

==Cost==
===United States===
According to the caregiver-finding platform UrbanSitter, the national average babysitting cost in 2022 was $22.68 an hour for one child, $25.37 an hour for two, and $27.70 an hour for three children. This rate has increased by 21 percent since 2019.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;baby sitter&quot; first appeared in 1937, while the verb form &quot;baby-sit&quot; was first recorded in 1947. The American Heritage College Dictionary notes, &quot;One normally would expect the agent noun &quot;babysitter&quot; with its &quot;-er&quot; suffix to come from the verb &quot;baby-sit&quot;, as &quot;diver&quot; comes from &quot;dive&quot;, but in fact &quot;babysitter&quot; is first recorded in 1937, ten years earlier than the first appearance of &quot;baby-sit&quot;. Thus the verb was derived from the agent noun rather than the other way around and represented a good example of back-formation. The use of the word &quot;sit&quot; to refer to a person tending to a child is recorded from 1800. The term may have originated from the caretaker &quot;sitting on&quot; the baby in one room while the parents were entertaining or busy in another. It is also theorized that the term may come from hens &quot;sitting&quot; on their eggs, thus &quot;caring for&quot; their chicks.

==International variations in definition==
In British English, the term refers only to caring for a child for a few hours, on an informal basis, and usually in the evening when the child is asleep for most of the time.

In American English, the term can include caring for a child for all or most of the day and on a regular or more formal basis, which would be described as childminding in British English.

In India and Pakistan, a babysitter or nanny, known as an &quot;ayah&quot; or &quot;aya&quot;, is hired on a longer-term contract basis to look after a child regardless of the presence of the parents.

<text>The Maryland House of Delegates is the lower house of the Maryland General Assembly, the state legislature of the U.S. State of Maryland. Three delegates are elected from each district, though some districts are divided into sub-districts. In the original state constitution, four delegates were elected from each county to one-year terms, and two were elected from each of the major early cities of Baltimore and Annapolis. Reforms in the 1830s, however, led to the apportionment of delegates by population rather than geography, and by 1922, delegates served four year terms. The modern system of apportionment of seats began in 1972, when 47 districts of roughly equal population were identified, although sub-districts were created to ensure local representation for areas with too little population to warrant an entire district.

Delegates are elected in even years when the President of the United States is not being elected, similar to most other state offices in Maryland. The most recent election was in November 2022. Delegates are not term-limited.

<text>The Battle of Cresson was a small battle between Frankish and Ayyubid forces on 1 May 1187 at the &quot;Spring of the Cresson.&quot; While the exact location of the spring is unknown, it is located in the environs of Nazareth. The conflict was a prelude to the decisive defeat of the Kingdom of Jerusalem at the Battle of Hattin two months later.

==Location==
The exact location of the spring is still disputed. Primary sources place the spring near Nazareth. Israeli archaeologist Rafi (Rafael Y.) Lewis believes the springs of Cresson may be near the springs of Sepphoris, due to a 2021 discovery of Frankish arrowheads near the site. British archaeologist Denys Pringle suggests that the spring may refer to &#x27;Ain ad-Daya: a spring that is closer to the Nazareth-Tiberias road, approximately four kilometres west of Kafr Sabt.

==Background==
Dynastic instability and internal divisions permeated the Kingdom of Jerusalem in the years leading up to and after the death of Baldwin IV. Baldwin, who suffered from leprosy, had appointed various executive regents during his reign (Reynald of Chatillon in 1177; Guy of Lusignan in 1183) to lead the Frankish armies in his stead. When Baldwin&#x27;s health degenerated again in early 1185, he appointed Count Raymond III of Tripoli as regent. Raymond accepted on condition that all members of the High Court swore that in case both king and heir died, the succession would be decided by an arbitration by the Pope, The Holy Roman Emperor, the King of France and the King of England. When Baldwin IV died in 1185, followed by his nephew Baldwin V in 1186, there was a succession crisis. The party of Sybilla got control of the capital and crowned her, ignoring the oath sworn before Raymond&#x27;s regency. To appease the barons willing to support her but not her husband Guy, she accepted to divorce him under the condition to be free to choose her next husband. Then, in an unpopular move, Sibylla crowned Guy as king rather than divorcing him. Presented with the fait accompli of the coronation, all barons submitted but for Baldwin of Ramla and Raymond, who refused to swear fealty to Guy. 
Baldwin of Ramla abdicated his fief for his minor son, and went voluntary in exile, rather than swear fealty to Guy of Lusignan; Raymond retreated to his fief of Tiberias and asked Saladin to provide Muslim troops against a possible attack by the King he refused to recognize.

Saladin, meanwhile, had been consolidating power during the reign of Baldwin IV. His successful campaigns in Mosul, Aleppo, and Egypt resulted in his sultanate being recognized by the Abbasid caliphate. Saladin returned to Damascus following Mosul&#x27;s fall, having now placed the empire of Nur ad-Din under his uneasy control. In 1185, Saladin had signed a truce treaty with the Franks under then-regent Raymond; however, before the treaty expiration, Reynald captured a caravan of Muslims traveling from Cairo to Damascus that winter When Saladin demanded reparation, King Guy tried to make Reynald to, but he refused the King&#x27;s request claiming he was absolute sovereign of his lands and he had no truce with Saladin. In response, Saladin launched an offensive against Reynald&#x27;s castle at Kerak in 1187, leaving his son al Melik al-Afdal as commander of a contingency at Re’sulma.  

==Prelude==
In response to the encroaching threat from Saladin, Guy assembled the High Court in Jerusalem. A delegation of Gerard of Ridefort, master of the Knights Templar; Roger de Moulins, master of the Knights Hospitaller; Balian of Ibelin, Josicus, Archbishop of Tyre; and Reginal Grenier, lord of Sidon, were selected to journey to Tiberias to make peace with Raymond. Meanwhile, al-Afdal gathered a raiding party to pillage the land surrounding Acre, while Saladin besieged Kerak. al-Afdal dispatched Muzzafar ad-Din Gökböri, Emir of Edessa, to lead this expedition, accompanied by two ranking emirs, Qaymaz al-Najami and Dildirim al-Yarugi. Knowing that his troops were poised to enter Raymond&#x27;s territory, Saladin agreed that the raiding party would only pass-through Galilee en route to Acre, leaving Raymond&#x27;s lands untouched. In Frankish sources, this raiding party consisted of approximately 7000 men; however, modern historians believe 700 men is more accurate.

==Battle==
On 30 April, the Ayyubid raiding party passed through Raymond&#x27;s territory unimpeded, before making their way west towards Nazareth.  On the same day, both Gerard and Roger arrived at the Templar castle of La Fève near Nazareth. Balian stopped at his fief of Nablus, and Reginald took an alternate route. The &quot;De expugnatione Terrae Sanctae libellus&quot; (hereafter &quot;the &quot;Libellus&quot;&quot;), a contemporary Latin chronicle, states that watchmen in Nazareth alerted Gerard and Roger of the Ayyubid raiders. The &quot;Lyon Eracles&quot;, a Middle French chronicle written by Balian&#x27;s squire Ernoul, redeems Raymond – saying he had warned them about the raid. Nazareth, falling outside of Raymond&#x27;s control, was not privy to Raymond&#x27;s agreement with Saladin. Gerard and Roger assembled a small army consisting of the knights in Nazareth and the Templar garrisons from Qaqun and al-Fulah to meet the Ayyubid threat. This force numbered about 130 knights, an unknown number of &quot;turcopoles&quot; and sergeants, and up to 400 infantry.

On the morning of 1 May, the Frankish army rode east from Nazareth and happened upon the Ayyubid raiding party at the springs of Cresson. The Frankish cavalry launched an initial offensive, catching the Ayyubid forces off guard. However, this separated the Frankish cavalry from the infantry. According to Ali ibn al-Althir, the ensuing melee was equally matched; however, the Ayyubid forces succeeded in routing the divided Frankish army. Only Gerard and a handful of knights escaped death, and the Ayyubids took an unknown number of captives. Gokbori&#x27;s troops proceeded to pillage the surrounding area before returning across Raymond&#x27;s territory.

==Aftermath==
Balian was still a day behind Gerard and Roger, and had stopped at Sebastea to attend the May Day Mass. After reaching the castle of La Fève, where the Templars and Hospitallers had camped, he found the place deserted. Balian sent his squire Ernoul ahead to learn what had happened, with news of the disastrous battle discouraging the Frankish forces.

Both Ayyubid and Frankish chroniclers record an overwhelmingly negative Frankish attitude towards Raymond following the battle. Raymond&#x27;s truce with Saladin was viewed as both a political and religious betrayal. As a result of this backlash, Raymond severed his diplomatic ties to Saladin and returned to Jerusalem with the remaining envoys to pledge his support for Guy. Although the battle reconciled the factions within the Frankish nobility, this political unity cost the Franks a number of influential knights: the Hospitaller Master Roger of Moulins, the Templar Marshal Robert Fraisnel, the Templar Jacquelin of Maillé, and plausibly the Templar Seneschal Urs of Alneto. The &quot;Libellus&quot; also praises the valor of two fallen Frankish knights: a Templar named Jakelin de Mailey and a Hospitaller named Henry.

Raymond&#x27;s reversal prompted Saladin to abandon his siege of Kerak. On 27 May, he joined his forces with al-Afdal and Gökböri at Ashtera in southern Syria. With a combined force of approximately 20,000 men, Saladin crossed the Jordan River on 26 June. Four days later he besieged Tiberias. This prompted Guy, Raymond, and Reynald to march north to relieve the city. The Frankish forces were defeated at the Battle of Hattin on 4 July. By October 1187, Saladin had captured Jerusalem.

==Historiographical Considerations==
The Battle of Cresson is found in contemporary chronicles; however, these accounts differ considerably and have yet to be fully reconciled by historians. The &quot;Libellus&quot; gives a circumstantial account of the battle. However, the Latin &quot;Itinerarium&quot; is generally preferred by historians given its contemporaneity with battle itself.

The &quot;Old French Continuation of William of Tyre&quot; (dated from the 1230s in its present form) includes an account by Balian&#x27;s squire Ernoul. Ernoul was not present at the battle but recorded the aftermath of the battle several years later. A late thirteenth-century copy of his account, the Lyon Eracles, blamed Gerard for the Frankish defeat. Current scholarship has redeemed Gerard, believing that the negative account reflected contemporary mistrust of the Templars and was not indicative of Gerard&#x27;s prowess at Cresson.

The chronicle of ibn Al-Athir contains an account of the battle which largely agrees with the Latin sources. The main difference between the two narratives concerns the size of the Ayyubid forces. Ibn Al-Athir describes the battle as a much smaller skirmish than the Latin accounts. Counter to these narratives, Baha ad-Din ibn Shaddad&#x27;s biography of Saladin reports that Gökböri was in Aleppo in the months preceding Hattin and does not mention his involvement in Cresson.

<doc id="1184315" wikidata="Q7739740" url="?curid=1184315" title="The Hipster Handbook">
<text>The Hipster Handbook (2003) is a satirical guide to hipster culture by Williamsburg, Brooklyn author Robert Lanham.

It includes a lexicon of words such as &quot;deck&quot; which means &quot;cool&quot; and &quot;fin&quot; which means &quot;not so cool&quot;, as well as chapters that describe and explain all that which makes up a hipster. A quiz in the back of the book rates readers on their level of hipsterdom, rewarding high scores to those who answer the questions in the manner of art school students and well-cultured, well-dressed, self-proclaimed hyper-intellectuals. &quot;Esquire&quot; called the book &quot;The &quot;Official Preppy Handbook&quot; for people who wear Atari T-shirts.&quot;

==Critical reception==
Reviews were mixed. Rick Marin, of the &quot;New York Times&quot;, gave it a favorable review, though he pointed out &quot;much of the hipsterism he sanctions seems pretty mainstream, even if it is being &#x27;appropriated&#x27;...Such quibbles, though, won&#x27;t penetrate the protective pomo coating on Lanham&#x27;s mirrored shades.&quot; Ben McGrath, of &quot;Slate&quot;, described the book as &quot;so comprehensive and so well-done that only a poseur could criticize it without tongue in cheek.&quot; Others have criticized the &quot;veiled hostility&quot; and &quot;aura of trying too hard.&quot;

A sequel was published in 2004: &quot;Food Court Druids, Cherohonkees and Other Creatures Unique to the Republic&quot;.

<text>Sumerduck ( ) is a small unincorporated village located equidistant between Fredericksburg, Culpeper, and Warrenton, as it is in Fauquier County in the U.S. state of Virginia.

The name was derived from the fact that ducks flocked here in the summer. Sumerduck is home to the major portion of the C.F. Phelps Wildlife Management Area, with several entrances to the reserve off of the major thoroughfare, VA Route 651. The community is also home to Cider Lab (a small batch, craft cidery), Rogers Ford Farm Winery and Smith&#x27;s Antiques.

<doc id="1184321" wikidata="Q527130" url="?curid=1184321" title="Ethnic clashes of Târgu Mureș">
<text>The ethnic clashes of [[Târgu Mureș]] (also called &quot;Black March&quot;, ) refer to incidents between the Hungarians and Romanians in Târgu Mureș and surrounding settlements in Transylvania, Romania in March 1990. The clashes were the bloodiest inter-ethnic incidents of the post-communist era in Transylvania. Târgu Mureș () is a Romanian town with an ethnically mixed population that was almost equally distributed between Romanians and Hungarians after the fall of the communist regime in December 1989. It has been a cultural and political center for the Hungarian minority in Transylvania.

In March 1990, clashes occurred there between the two ethnic groups in the town, involving ethnic Romanians from neighbouring villages. The clashes left 5 people dead and 300 injured. The riots were broadcast nationally on Romanian television and were covered by media around the world.

The exact cause is still widely disputed. The roles of the media and the Romanian government are also questioned.

==The events==


At the beginning of March 1990, two episodes involving Romanian statues occurred. Graffiti was found on the statue of the Romanian historical figure Avram Iancu, and a statue of another Romanian personality in a neighboring town was stolen. A Romanian newspaper referred to events of the same kind that took place before the 1940 Romanian-Hungarian conflict.

During the celebrations of the Hungarian community on the national day of the Hungarians (15 March), accusations of nationalism and separatism began to be heard from Romanians.

The next day, groups of intoxicated Romanians began to attack state-owned stores in which ethnic Hungarians had changed the signage to include Hungarian. Students sang anti-Hungarian songs and pillaged a Hungarian Protestant church.

On 19 March, Romanian villagers, dispatched by coach and train, arrived in the city and attacked the headquarters of the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania. The local Hungarians tried to defend it, and the area fell into violence. The involvement of the Romanian government in connection with the stimulation of ethnic violence is not completely unfounded (Andreescu 2001, Gallagher, 2005).

The media enlarged the tensions and contributed, by inflammatory discourse, to the worsening of the situation. The parliamentary report on the events confirmed that the media reported falsely about the heavy influx of Hungarians to help their co-nationals in their fight for a separate Transylvania. Incitements about &quot;separatist&quot; trends were used in an effort to manufacture ethnic conflict.

===Media issues===
The events are viewed differently by the sides that were involved. The 16 March incident at &quot;Pharmacy no. 28&quot; is an example of the capacity of the media to present the same event with opposite connotations. A news brief was presented, by both the Romanian and the Hungarian press, both using it to draw attention to the danger represented by the actions of &quot;the others&quot;. Romanian media announced that the pharmacist wiped inscriptions in Romanian, and the Hungarian press wrote that the Romanians wiped the Hungarian inscription.

====Romanian media====

According to the correspondent of the Romanian television, in the neighbouring town of Sovata, a statue of Nicolae Bălcescu was knocked down, generating protests of Vatra Românească.

Several teams of cameramen from the Romanian army filmed numerous episodes of an explicitly anti-Romanian turn. There were shown groups of Hungarians who chanted &quot;Horthy, Horthy!&quot;, &quot;Death to Romanians!&quot; and &quot;Transylvania to Hungary!&quot; A 2010 article from Jurnalul Național talks about the influx of 10,000 Hungarian &quot;tourists&quot; who were officially coming to commemorate the Revolution of 1848. There are accounts in the same period of the desecration of the statues of Avram Iancu, Nicolae Bălcescu and some arson attempts on Romanian houses in Sovata. Such acts have generated counter-manifestations by the Romanian population.

Also, the &quot;road signs war&quot; started and would continue for years throughout Transylvania. One of the &quot;Târgu Mureș&quot; signs at the entry into the city was replaced with a &quot;Marosvasarhely&quot; Hungarian sign. The change sparked anger from Azomureș Romanian employees, who restored the Romanian sign.

===1990 Human Rights Watch report===
In March, violence broke out between ethnic Hungarians and Romanians in the Transylvanian city of Târgu Mureș. On 19 March, the headquarters of the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania (UDMR) was attacked by a large group of ethnic Romanians. The police and army did not respond to the UDMR&#x27;s calls for protection until several hours after the attack began. Many ethnic Hungarians trapped inside were seriously injured.

On the following morning, some 15,000 ethnic Hungarians gathered in the town square to protest the previous day&#x27;s events. A group of approximately 3,000 ethnic Romanians hostile to the Hungarians&#x27; demands for autonomy began to gather on one side of the square in the early afternoon. Tensions escalated as word spread that buses of ethnic Romanian peasants from neighboring villages were heading toward town to support the Romanians in the square. By 2:30 p.m., the Chief of Police gave assurances to ethnic Romanian and Hungarian leaders in the square that the police had blocked off entrances to the city. However, unconfirmed reports indicated that the police allowed buses of ethnic Romanians through the roadblocks. Romanian peasants from villages outside Târgu Mureş arrived in the town center long after the roads should have been closed, and joined the Romanians already in the square.

Around 5:00 p.m., violence erupted between ethnic Romanians and ethnic Hungarians, breaking the single line of 50 police that the authorities had sent to divide the two groups. Although the police and army had been made aware of the potential for violence by both Hungarian and Romanian leaders, who had made numerous reports of the escalating tensions in the square, the authorities once again failed to respond in an adequate manner to protect the citizens of Târgu Mureș.

According to the US State Department Human Rights Report for 1993:

The UDMR condemned the Supreme Court&#x27;s 7 June rejection of an appeal in the case of Pal Cseresznyés, an ethnic Hungarian serving a 10-year sentence for attempted murder as a result of his involvement in the Târgu Mureș incidents of March 1990. Cseresznyés participated in the savage beating of an ethnic Romanian, which an international journalist captured on film. The UDMR&#x27;s complaint centered on the length of his sentence and on the fact that he was the only one of those filmed who was brought to trial. The court maintained that, regardless of the fates of the others involved, Cseresznyes had received a fair trial and was guilty as charged. Thus it found no legal reason to grant an appeal.

==Casualties and legal consequences==
There were 5 dead (three ethnic Hungarians and two ethnic Romanians) and 278 injured.
During the penal investigation and the court trials that followed, two ethnic Hungarians (Pál Cseresznyés and Ernő Barabás) and seven others were convicted.

===Emblematic victims===
There were victims on both sides, two of which received particular attention:

* On 19 March 1990, the Hungarian writer András Sütő was beaten when Romanians attacked the offices of the Democratic Union of Hungarians (UDMR). With several bones broken and being blinded in one eye, he was carried to the Bucharest Military Hospital, then, later, by a military aircraft to Budapest, Hungary, where his life was saved, but he retained a permanent eye injury. The attackers were never officially identified, or convicted.
* On 20 March 1990, Mihăilă Cofariu, an ethnic Romanian from Ibănești village brought to Târgu Mureș along with others to beat Hungarians was beaten even after he fell unconscious. Following that he remained neurologically disabled. The event was presented in international media as a Hungarian being beaten by Romanians. He was brought in coma to the county&#x27;s emergency hospital and spent several months in hospitals in Romania and Germany. One of the perpetrators, ethnic Hungarian Pál Cseresznyés, was tried, convicted and sentenced to 10 years in prison, but he was released in 1996 by Romanian President Emil Constantinescu, as an act of reconciliation. The other convicted perpetrator, Ernő Barabás, emigrated to Hungary. He has also received a 10-year imprisonment sentence, but the Hungarian authorities denied all requests for extradition from the Romanian authorities. In 2020, both a Romanian newspaper Evenimentul Zilei as well as a Hungarian newspaper &quot;Magyar Narancs&quot; confirmed that Ernő Barabás is the owner of the Hell Energy Drink company.
==Dispute over causes==

The prevalent opinion in the Romanian public is that the incidents were triggered by direct attacks by Hungarians against Romanian institutions, symbols, statues and policemen. They claim that the riots were part of a plan to separate part of Transylvania from Romania to reintegrate it with Hungary.

Most Hungarians maintain, however, that rumours about Hungarian violence against Romanians and/or state institutions were unjustified or widely exaggerated. Hungarians also state that rumours about Hungarian violence were spread to undermine legitimate Hungarian demands (such as language, cultural rights or possible ethnic-based regional autonomy).

==Involvement of Romanian government==
The nature of the involvement of the Romanian government is also disputed. The official account is that the government succeeded in calming the situation and ended the clashes. However, that has been disputed:
* Multiple Hungarians claim that the government was slow to act and failed to stem the violence at the beginning and thus responsible for its escalation. They support their arguments with filmed scenes in which police or other representatives of the authorities overlook events. They also criticise the fact that the vast majority of those taken into custody after the events were ethnic Hungarians, which suggests an ethnic bias.
* Multiple ethnic Romanians claim that the government did not intervene fast enough to protect the population and that clearly-identified Hungarians involved in the violence were not prosecuted.
According to a 1990 report by Human Rights Watch, &quot;the authorities... failed to respond in an adequate manner to protect the citizens of Târgu Mureș&quot;. In this sense, the riots can be seen as a symptom of the fact that police, and the law enforcement agencies in general were weak and morally compromised at the time because of how the communist regime had fallen. That opinion is reinforced by the similar pattern in some subsequent events (Piața Universității and the miners&#x27; invasion of Bucharest).

==Involvement of Western media==

The quality of the Western media&#x27;s coverage of the riots is contested by multiple Romanians. An often-cited example is the footage of Mihăilă Cofariu, who was presented as a Hungarian being beaten by Romanians in the documentary &quot;And the walls came tumbling down: Bad Neighbours&quot;, directed by Peter Swain and produced by ethnic Hungarian Paul Neuberg. According to its director, the filming crew arrived in Transylvania after the events, and most footage, including that of Mihăilă Cofariu, were provided by the Hungarian producer team, who let them believe that Cofariu was really a Hungarian being beaten by Romanians.

Also, during filming, the crew had no contact with any ethnic Romanian, and all documentation was gathered only from Hungarian sources, including some Hungarian contacts from the political scene.

Western media, picking up the story from the documentary, presented the Mihăilă Cofariu footage in the same way: as a Hungarian being beaten by Romanians. That falsehood is often used in Romanian media to link various similar cases of anti-Romanian falsehoods in Hungarian and Western media.

<doc id="1184326" wikidata="Q2257572" url="?curid=1184326" title="Belgian Land Component">
<text>The Land Component (, ), historically and commonly still referred to as the Belgian Army (, ), is the land branch of the Belgian Armed Forces. The King of the Belgians is the commander in chief. The current chief of staff of the Land Component is Major-General Jean-Pol Baugnée.

Dating back to Belgium&#x27;s establishment in 1830, the Land Component is the oldest service branch of the Belgian Armed Forces, and is also the largest of the four branches, with approximately 10,000 active military personnel and over 2,000 reservists as of 2022.

== History ==
=== Early history ===
The Belgian Army was established in 1830 after Belgium gained independence from the Netherlands after the Belgian Revolution. It was initially expected that as neutral buffer state with borders guaranteed by France, Britain, and Prussia, Belgium could avoid the need for an expensive permanent military, relying instead on the part-time militia of the existing (Civil Guard); however, the need of a regular full-time army was soon acknowledged, and the Belgian Army was promptly established.

According to the Law of August 1837, the Belgian Army was to consist of:

==== Infantry ====
*14 line infantry regiments (3 active battalions, 1 reserve and 1 company in each regiment depot)
*3 &quot;Jäger&quot; regiments (3 active battalions, 1 reserve and 1 company in each regiment depot)
*1 grenadier regiment (3 active battalions, 1 reserve and 1 company in each regiment depot)
*1 carabinier regiment (4 active battalions, 2 reserve and 1 depot company of deposit)
*2 companies settled
*1 discipline body
*1 military school for children of servicemen

Note: A battalion (864 men) consists of four companies of 216 men

==== Cavalry ====
*4 lancer regiments (4 active squadrons and one reinforcement in each regiment)
*4 guides regiments (4 active squadrons and one reinforcement in each regiment)
*2 &quot;chasseur&quot; regiments (4 active squadrons and one reinforcement in each regiment)

Note: A squadron had approximately 130 horses

==== Artillery ====
*4 regiments of artillery (10 batteries in each regiment)
*3 regiments of fortress artillery or siege artillery (16 batteries, 1 battery and 1 spare battery depot in each regiment)
*1 pontoon company
*1 company of artificers
*1 company of gunsmiths
*1 company of artillery workers

Note: A battery has 6 guns

==== Engineering ====
*1 Engineer Regiment (3 active battalions and one depot battalion)
*1 railway company
*1 campaign telegraph company
*1 telegraph room company
*1 pontoon room company
*1 workers company

==== Train ====
*7 train companies

=== First World War ===

A major reorganisation of the army had been authorised by the government in 1912, providing for a total army of 350,000 men by 1926: 150,000 in the field forces, 130,000 in fortress garrisons and 70,000 reserves and auxiliaries. At the outbreak of war this reorganisation was nowhere near complete and only 117,000 men could be mobilised for the field forces, with the other branches equally deficient.

The Commander-in-Chief was King Albert I, with Lieutenant-General Chevalier Antonin de Selliers de Moranville as the Chief of the General Staff from 25 May 1914 until 6 September 1914 when a Royal Decree abolished the function of Chief of Staff of the army. In this way the King secured his control of the command.

*1st Division (Lieutenant-General Baix) - around Ghent.
*2nd Division (Lieutenant-General Dassin) - Antwerp.
*3rd Division (Lieutenant-General Leman) - around Liège.
*4th Division (Lieutenant-General Michel) - Namur and Charleroi.
*5th Division (Lieutenant-General Ruwet) - around Mons.
*6th Division (Lieutenant-General Albert Lantonnois van Rode) - Brussels.
*Cavalry Division (Lieutenant-General de Witte) - Brussels.

In addition, there were garrisons at Antwerp, Liège and Namur, each placed under the command of the local divisional commander.

Each division contained three mixed brigades (of two infantry regiments and one artillery regiment), one cavalry regiment, and one artillery regiment, as well as various support units. Each infantry regiment contained three battalions, with one regiment in each brigade having a machine-gun company of six guns. An artillery regiment had three batteries of four guns.

The nominal strength of a division varied from 25,500 to 32,000 all ranks, with a total strength of eighteen infantry battalions, a cavalry regiment, eighteen machine-guns, and forty-eight guns. Two divisions (the 2nd and 6th) each had an additional artillery regiment, for a total of sixty guns.

The Cavalry Division had two brigades of two regiments each, three horse artillery batteries, and a cyclist battalion, along with support units; it had a total strength of 4,500 all ranks with 12 guns, and was, in effect, little more than a reinforced brigade.

=== Second World War ===

In 1940, the King of Belgium was the commander in chief of the Belgian Army which had a mobilised strength of 610,000 troops. The army was composed of seven infantry corps and one cavalry corps. The corps were as follows:
* I Corps with the 4th and 7th Infantry Divisions
* II Corps with the 6th and 9th Infantry Divisions
* III Corps with the 2nd and 3rd Infantry Divisions
* IV Corps with the 12th, 15th, and 18th Infantry Divisions
* V Corps with the 13th and 17th Infantry Divisions
* VI Corps with the 5th and 10th Infantry Divisions
* VII Corps with the 2nd Chasseurs Ardennais Division and 8th Infantry Division
* Cavalry Corps with the 2nd Cavalry Division and 1st and 14th Infantry Divisions
* Groupement Keyaerts with the 1st Chasseurs Ardennais Division and 1st Cavalry Division
* Army Reserve with the 11th and 16th Infantry Division
Each army corps had its own headquarters staff, medical and logistic support units, engineers and signal troops and corps-level artillery support.

Each infantry division had a divisional staff, reconnaissance unit, medical and logistic support units, engineers and signal troops. Active and first tier reserve divisions had two additional antitank companies. Infantry regiments numbered approximately 3,000 troops. Each active and first tier reserve regiment had 108 light machine guns, 52 heavy machine guns, 8 mortars and 12 antitank guns.

Within the Free Belgian Forces that were formed in Great Britain during the occupation of Belgium between 1940 and 1945, there was a land force formation, the 1st Belgian Infantry Brigade. An additional three divisions were raised and trained in Northern Ireland, but the war ended before they could see action. However, they joined the initial Belgian occupation force in Germany, I Belgian Corps, whose headquarters moved to Luedenscheid in October 1946. Of the 75,000 troops that found themselves in Germany on 8 May 1945, the vast majority had been recruited after the liberation of Belgium.

There was also a Bicycle infantry known as the Frontier Cyclists.

=== Korean War ===

During the Korean War, Belgium provided combat troops for South Korea and became part of the United Nations Forces.

=== Cold War ===
During the Cold War, Belgium provided the I Belgian Corps (HQ Haelen Kaserne, Junkersdorf, Lindenthal (Cologne)), consisting of the 1st Infantry Division in Liège and 16th Mechanised Division in Neheim-Hüsten, to NATO&#x27;s Northern Army Group for the defence of West Germany. There were also two reserve brigades (10th Mechanised Brigade, Limbourg, and the 12th Motorised Brigade, Liège), slightly bigger than the four active brigades, which were intended as reinforcements for the two divisions. Interior forces comprised the Para-Commando Regiment in Heverlee, three national defence light infantry battalions (5th Chasseurs Ardennais, 3rd Carabiniers-cyclists, and 4th Carabiniers-cyclists), four engineer battalions, and nine provincial regiments with two to five light infantry battalions each. (Isby and Kamps, 1985, 64, 72)

After the end of the Cold War, forces were reduced. Initial planning in 1991 called for a Belgian-led corps with 2 or 4 Belgian brigades, a German brigade, and possibly a U.S. brigade. However, by 1992 this plan was looking unlikely, and in 1993 a single Belgian division with two brigades became part of the Eurocorps.

==Structure==


=== Current ===
The Land Component is organised as 1 Brigade and 1 Special Operations Regiment. In total, the Land Component consists of almost 10,000 active military personnel (as of 2019). After the 2018 reforms, the ground forces are organised as follows:

Belgian Army Staff (the HQ of the Land Component) It oversees and plans all activities and operations of the land component.

* &quot;Motorized Brigade&quot; at Leopoldsburg (formed from the Medium Brigade). The brigade comprises about 7,500 soldiers divided into 16 units. The combat capacity consists of three motorized infantry battalions equipped with Piranha IIIC vehicles and two light infantry battalions equipped with Dingo 2 vehicles, which are supported by two engineer battalions, two logistic battalions, two CIS groups (communications), one field artillery battalion, one reconnaissance ISTAR battalion equipped with Pandur I vehicles, two military training camps and a headquarters company. In the future the brigade is to be reorganized into four infantry battalions and two cavalry battalions.

* &quot;Special Operations Regiment&quot; (formerly the Light Brigade) at Heverlee. The regiment has approximately 1,500 elite soldiers under its command. It plans and carries out special operations all around the world and is the main expeditionary unit of the Belgian ground forces. The regiment consists of the 2nd commando battalion, the 3rd parachute battalion, the special forces group (SFG), the 6th communications group, parachute, and commando training centres, and the 4th commando HQ company. All units have airborne capabilities. The regiment operates light armoured vehicles to maneuver across difficult terrains.

The service capacity comprises the following units:

* Military Police Group
* Information Operations Group
* Explosive Removal and Destruction Service (DOVO in Dutch; SEDEE in French)
* Movement Control Group
* 29th Logistic Battalion
* Field Accommodation Unit
* Training centres and camps, comprising four departments:
** Training Department Infantry at Arlon
** Training Department Armour-Cavalry at Leopoldsburg
** Training Department Artillery at Brasschaat
** Training Department Engineers at Namur

Some of the regiments in the Land Component, such as the 12/13th Battalion of the Line, have names consisting of multiple elements. This is the result of a series of amalgamations that took place over the years. The 12/13th Battalion was created in 1993 as a result of the merger of the 12th Regiment of the Line Prince Leopold and the 13th Regiment of the Line.

=== Two Brigades in the Belgian Army ===
To enhance organizational efficiency, the Belgian Army will, by 2032, establish a dedicated brigade for each of Belgium&#x27;s major linguistic communities. The structure and composition of these brigades are outlined as follows:
----Southern Brigade (Francophone)

Headquartered in Marche-en-Famenne, the Southern Brigade includes the following units:

* Chasseurs Ardennais: An infantry battalion based in Marche-en-Famenne.
* 12/13th Line Infantry Battalion: Also based in Marche-en-Famenne.
* 1/3rd Lancers: Transitioning into a cavalry battalion.
* 4th Engineer Battalion: Stationed in Amay.
* 4th CIS Group: Located in Marche-en-Famenne.
* Artillery Battalion Expansion: A second artillery battalion is planned by 2035. Meanwhile, the existing Artillery Battalion—based in Brasschaat and Lombardsijde—will establish a third base in Marche-en-Famenne.
* 4th Logistics Battalion: Currently based in Marche-en-Famenne.

----Northern Brigade (Dutch-speaking)

Headquartered in Leopoldsburg, the Northern Brigade is composed of the following units:

* Liberation – 5th Line Infantry Battalion: Based in Leopoldsburg.
* 1st Carabiniers Prince Boudewijn – Grenadiers: Currently based in Leopoldsburg but scheduled to fully relocate to Lombardsijde by 2025. 
* 2/4th Lancers: A newly established cavalry battalion. 
* 11th Engineer Battalion: Stationed in Burcht.

==Equipment==

The Belgian Army went through a major re-equipment programme for most of its vehicles. The aim was to phase out all tracked vehicles in favour of wheeled vehicles. As of 2010, the tank units were to be disbanded or amalgamated with the Armored Infantry (two infantry companies and one tank squadron per battalion). Forty Leopard 1 tanks were to be sold. As of 2013, only some M113 variants (Radar, recovery, command posts, and driving school vehicles) and Leopard variants (Recovery, AVLB, Pionier, driving tanks) will remain in service.

The Leopard 1A5 tank was retired on 10 September 2014. 56 of the tanks were sold, about 24 will stay as historic monuments or serve as a museum pieces; the rest will be phased out or used for target practice. In 2008 a sale of 43 Leopard 1A5(BE) to Lebanon was concluded, but as of 2018 was not finalized due to &quot;the absence of licensing for export from Germany.&quot;

In the strategical defense vision report of the Belgian government, it was stated that by 2030 the Belgian land component will invest in new modern equipment such as weapons, vehicles, communication assets, body armor and more.

<text>Lauren Cecilia Fisher (née Gofton; born 28 April 1978), known professionally as Lauren Laverne, is an English radio DJ, model, television presenter, author and singer. She was the lead singer and guitarist in the alternative rock band Kenickie. 

The group&#x27;s album &quot;At The Club&quot; reached the top 10, although her greatest chart success came when she performed vocals on Mint Royale&#x27;s single &quot;Don&#x27;t Falter&quot;. Laverne has presented numerous television programmes, including &quot;10 O&#x27;Clock Live&quot; for Channel 4, and &quot;The Culture Show&quot; and coverage of the Glastonbury Festival for the BBC. She has also written a published novel entitled &quot;Candypop: Candy and the Broken Biscuits&quot;. She presents the breakfast show on BBC Radio 6 Music, and in 2018 became the host of the long-running radio show &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Born Lauren Cecelia Gofton on 28 April 1978, she was brought up in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, in a large family. Her father was one of nine and her mother was one of six. One grandfather had been a shipbuilder, the other a coalminer. Her father, Leslie Gofton, was a sociology lecturer at Newcastle University, and her mother was a teacher. The family lived on Dunelm South, the A690.

She first attended St Mary&#x27;s Roman Catholic Primary School in 1982, where she befriended Marie Nixon, later to become a fellow Kenickie guitarist, and then St Anthony&#x27;s Girls&#x27; Catholic School between 1989 and 1994, where she and Nixon met Emma Jackson. Laverne went on to study at City of Sunderland College from 1994 to 1996.

== Career ==
During her time at college, Laverne, Nixon and Jackson, then all aged sixteen, formed Kenickie with Laverne&#x27;s brother Peter, taking the stage names Lauren Laverne (originally Lauren Le Laverne), Marie du Santiago, Emmy-Kate Montrose and Johnny X (originally just X). Initially affiliated to the Slampt label and the local punk scene, the band later signed with EMI. In all, Kenickie achieved four top-40 hit singles and a top-10 hit album.

Laverne, Du Santiago and Montrose became as known for their funny and acerbic onstage banter and interview style as for their music, making all three of them popular contestants on comedy panel shows such as &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot;. Laverne would later appear on &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;.

In 2000 she brought out a solo EP, &quot;Take These Flowers Away&quot;, contributed a version of &quot;In the Bleak Midwinter&quot; to Xfm London&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s a Cool, Cool Christmas&quot; album, played at the Reading Festival, and made the top 20 for the only time in her singing career as vocalist on &quot;Don&#x27;t Falter&quot; by Mint Royale. She was also working on a solo album at this time, but this was permanently put on hold by the collapse of Deceptive Records.

She subsequently provided guest vocals on the Divine Comedy&#x27;s 2004 single &quot;Come Home Billy Bird&quot;.

===Television===
Laverne&#x27;s first television presenting role was for Play UK&#x27;s series &quot;The Alphabet Show&quot;, with Chris Addison, made while Kenickie were still together. She subsequently presented &quot;Planet Pop&quot; and &quot;Loves Like A Dog&quot; for Channel 4, &quot;Fanorama&quot; for E4, &quot;Party in the Park&quot; with Melanie Brown and &quot;Pop&quot; for Five and &quot;Orange Playlist&quot; for ITV, as well as reporting for &quot;&quot;, leading the house band on &quot;Johnny Vaughan Tonight&quot; and appearing as an expert in a music special of BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Test the Nation&quot;. Later, she became one of BBC Two&#x27;s main presenters for their coverage of the Glastonbury Festival and the host of ITV2&#x27;s coverage of events such as the British Comedy Awards and the BRIT Awards.

She also presented a documentary for Sky One on the rise of popularity of the US hit TV Show &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, called &quot;Buffy: Television With Bite&quot;. This aired when the show was returning for its sixth season in 2001.

In 2000, Laverne provided the voice of Shinobu in the BBC&#x27;s one-off dub of &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot;.

In 2003, Laverne was a regular team captain, along with Jason Byrne, on &quot;Elvis Has Left The Building&quot;, a comedy music panel show hosted by Colin Murphy for BBC Northern Ireland.

In 2004 she was a regular guest on the quiz show &quot;HeadJam&quot;. In 2005, she became host of ITV&#x27;s Saturday morning music show &quot;&quot;, along with Myleene Klass and Johny Pitts. The show finished in April 2006.

in April 2006, Laverne appeared as guest host of &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot;. In August, she presented Channel 4&#x27;s coverage of the V Festival. In March 2007, she presented the NME Awards live from the Hammersmith Palais.

In July 2007, Laverne appeared on the satirical comedy show &quot;Mock the Week&quot;, and on &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; on 14 December that same year. She appeared on &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot; on 10 January 2008, this time as a guest. In September 2008, Laverne appeared again on &quot;Mock the Week&quot;.

In March 2008, Laverne appeared on the &quot;Lily Allen and Friends&quot; show with fellow Sunderland musicians the Futureheads, and on &quot;Would I Lie to You?&quot;.

From 2006 to 2010, she was a regular presenter with the weekly BBC arts magazine programme &quot;The Culture Show&quot;, alongside Mark Kermode. She also presented the second series of the late-night Channel 4 music show &quot;Transmission with T-Mobile&quot; opposite Steve Jones.

Laverne replaced radio DJ Jo Whiley on the talent show &quot;Orange Mobile Act Unsigned&quot;, which searches for the top unsigned acts in the country.

Laverne became a regular presenter in the new &quot;magazine&quot; format third series of &quot;It&#x27;s Not Easy Being Green&quot;, first broadcast on BBC Two in January 2009. She also narrated &quot;Tough Guy or Chicken?&quot; on BBC Three in August 2009.

On 6 May 2010, she was a co-host of Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Alternative Election Night&quot;, along with Jimmy Carr, David Mitchell and Charlie Brooker. Starting 20 January 2011, she re-joined her co-hosts on Channel 4&#x27;s satirical news programme &quot;10 O&#x27;Clock Live&quot;.

Laverne narrates the animated series &quot;Tee and Mo&quot; about a little monkey and his monkey Mum, as shown on the CBeebies channel.

In May 2022, the BBC announced that Laverne would be one of the guest presenters to take over Richard Osman&#x27;s role on &quot;Pointless&quot;.

In August 2023, the BBC announced that Laverne would be joining as one of two additional co-presenters of The One Show, along with Roman Kemp.

===Radio===

Having previously sat in for BBC Radio 1&#x27;s Steve Lamacq, Laverne joined Xfm London in 2002, co-hosting a Saturday morning show with Mark Webster, while occasionally standing in for various DJs on BBC Radio 6 Music, including Phill Jupitus&#x27; breakfast show where one morning she interviewed her own brother Pete (who records under the name J Xaverre) Laverne took over XFM&#x27;s drivetime slot from Zoe Ball at the start of 2004, winning &quot;Best Newcomer&quot; at the &quot;Commercial Radio Awards&quot; in 2004.

She became host of the XFM breakfast show on 31 October 2005 after Christian O&#x27;Connell moved to Virgin Radio, but left suddenly in April 2007 to pursue her television interests. However, Laverne went on to guest present on BBC Radio 2.

Laverne joined BBC Radio 6 Music in June 2008 to present a Saturday weekend show before taking over the Monday to Friday morning (10:00 to 13:00) slot from George Lamb in November 2009.

==Personal life==
Laverne married the television producer and DJ Graeme Fisher in County Durham in August 2005; the couple live in Muswell Hill, London, and she also has a flat in Sunderland. The couple had their first child in October 2007. On 30 March 2010, she announced on her BBC Radio 6 Music show that she was pregnant, and she gave birth to their second son in September 2010.

Laverne&#x27;s mother, Celia Gofton, was elected a councillor for the Pallion ward in the City of Sunderland in 2006, and sought nomination as Labour candidate in 2008 in the Sunderland Central constituency but was defeated by Julie Elliott, who went on to win the seat for Labour in the 2010 general election. Her mother died in June 2022.

Laverne is a Roman Catholic. In 2011, she said: &quot;Once a Catholic... It&#x27;s like the Mafia - you don&#x27;t get to leave. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d want to, but I&#x27;m incredibly angry with the Church at the moment.&quot; She is a supporter of Sunderland Football Club.

In 2005, Laverne became an ambassador for Sunderland, promoting and raising awareness of her home city. She received an honorary fellowship from the University of Sunderland in July 2009.

Laverne has been a vegetarian since the age of four.

In August 2024, Laverne revealed that she had been diagnosed with cancer, but was expected to make a full recovery. On 24 November 2024, she announced that she had been given the &quot;all clear&quot; following treatment.

===Politics===
Laverne has been a supporter of the Labour Party. In late 1996, on a children&#x27;s TV programme, Laverne referred to the Spice Girls as &quot;Tory scum&quot; for their support for the Conservatives. This was before the 1997 general election.

<text>The Raquette River, sometimes spelled Racquette, originates at Raquette Lake in the Adirondack Mountains in the U.S. state of New York. long, it is the third longest river entirely in the state of New York.

The river is a popular destination for canoeing and kayaking. It passes through many natural and man-made lakes to its final destination at Akwesasne on the Saint Lawrence River. The river is the source of 27 hydroelectric plants operated by Brookfield Power, which at capacity can produce up to 181 megawatts of power.

Historically, the river was a part of the &quot;Highway of the Adirondacks&quot;, by which it was possible to travel hundreds of miles by canoe or guideboat with short stretches of portage connecting various waterways. This route is still followed by the Northern Forest Canoe Trail, a canoe trail from Old Forge to Fort Kent in Maine. It is also the basis of the route of the Adirondack Canoe Classic, a three-day, 90-mile canoe race from Old Forge to Saranac Lake.

<text>Tiu Keng Leng (), Rennie&#x27;s Mill, is an area of Hong Kong in the Sai Kung District adjacent to Tseung Kwan O (Junk Bay).

The area used to be a refugee village housing former Kuomintang officials and followers who escaped to Hong Kong from mainland China after the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC); however, the original Tiu Keng Leng village was cleared before Hong Kong&#x27;s sovereignty transfer to the PRC in 1997, and nowadays Tiu Keng Leng is thoroughly redeveloped as part of the Tseung Kwan O New Town.

==History==

The earliest traceable name referring to the area nowadays known as Tiu Keng Leng was &quot;Chiu Keng Leng&quot; (照鏡嶺, &quot;lit.&quot; ridge of mirror reflection), being a reference to the clearness and calmness of the adjacent bay. The name was given by Tanka residents in the area.
Both the names &quot;Tiu Keng Leng&quot; and &quot;Rennie&#x27;s Mill&quot; come from a 19th-century Canadian businessman named Alfred Herbert Rennie, who established the Hong Kong Milling Company at Junk Bay (his partners were Paul Chater and Hormusjee Naorojee Mody). The business failed, and Rennie drowned himself there in 1908, though it was mistakenly reported that he had hanged himself. The incident gave the Chinese name for the site 吊頸嶺 (Tiu Keng Leng / Jyutping: diu3 geng2 leng5), meaning &quot;Hanging (neck) Ridge&quot;, a pun on the name &quot;Chiu Keng Leng&quot; mentioned above. Because it was inauspicious, the name was later changed to similar-sounding 調景嶺 (Tiu King Leng / Jyutping: tiu4 ging2 leng5, which can be interpreted as &quot;ridge of adjusting situation&quot;.)

The 1819 edition of the &quot;Gazetteer of Xin&#x27;an County&quot; does not mention the place. 

On 26 June 1950 the Hong Kong Government&#x27;s Social Welfare Office (the predecessor of the Social Welfare Department) settled a considerable number of refugees from China – former Nationalist soldiers and other Kuomintang supporters (according to official government account, there were 6,800 of them) – at Rennie&#x27;s Mill, following the Chinese Civil War. With the newly built temporary settlements, the colonial government provided food and living expenses to the refugees. The Hong Kong Government&#x27;s original intention was to settle these refugees temporarily before they would be repatriated to Taiwan by the Kuomintang or to mainland China by the Chinese Communists. But this day never came for the Kuomintang (under the auspices of a political-oriented charitable body named Free China Relief Association which became prominent after the government suspended food ration in 1953), the residents of the enclave became more supportive to the Kuomintang cause. Thus, by the late-1950s, in correlation with the Cold War context in Asia at the time, Rennie&#x27;s Mill gradually became a &quot;Bastion Against Communism&quot;, with the flag of the Republic of China flying (earning it the sobriquet &quot;Little Taiwan&quot;), its own school system and practically off-limits to the Royal Hong Kong Police Force until 1962 when the Hong Kong Government decided to turn it into a resettlement estate due to its apprehension of the growing Kuomintang presence in the enclave. It also had a significant missionary presence. Owing to its pro-Kuomintang atmosphere, the 1967 riots did not have an effect on Rennie&#x27;s Mill.

Rennie&#x27;s Mill was badly damaged by Typhoon Wanda in 1962, rendering many homeless.

In 1996 the Hong Kong government evicted the last of Rennie&#x27;s Mill&#x27;s original residents, ostensibly to make room for new town developments as part of the Tseung Kwan O New Town, but widely believed to be a move to please the Communist Chinese government before the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997. 

Earlier in 1961, the people of Rennie&#x27;s Mill were promised by the government that they would be able to stay &quot;indefinitely,&quot; and in June 1996, residents petitioned the High Court, where judge Raymond Sears found that &quot;In my judgment, the conduct of the Housing Authority by serving notices to quit, in breach of the clear promises of 1961, amounts to an abuse of power.&quot;

==Housing==

After the handover, the English name of the area was changed from &quot;Rennie&#x27;s Mill&quot; to &quot;Tiu Keng Leng&quot;, following the Cantonese name. Tiu Keng Leng became redeveloped as a modern high-rise residential district.

Metro Town is a private housing estate situated directly above the Tiu Keng Leng Station. With nine towers built on top of a carpark/shopping mall podium, it is the tallest structure in the area.

To the south of Metro Town, on the site of a former steel mill operated by Shiu Wing Steel, is another private housing estate, Ocean Shores. 

The three public housing estates in the area areKin Ming Estate, Choi Ming Court and Shin Ming Estate.

==Transport==
Before the redevelopment and reclamation in the surrounding area, Tiu Keng Leng could be reached by the winding, hilly and narrow Po Lam Road South, which ran past numerous busy quarries. At that time, Tiu Keng Leng&#x27;s only public transport connections were Kowloon Motor Bus routes 90 and 290, served with minibuses, and by water transport. In 2001, with the redevelopment, a segment of Po Lam Road South was rebuilt and extended to near Kwong Tin Estate in Yau Tong. The reconstructed road was renamed O King Road and became the first road connection to modern Tiu Keng Leng. Tseung Kwan O-Lam Tin Tunnel, opened in 2022, provides a direct and fast route into Kowloon and the city centre.

The various centres of Tseung Kwan O were always intended to be served primarily by the MTR metro system, and the 2002 opening of Tiu Keng Leng station of the Tseung Kwan O line and Kwun Tong line provided a much-used link to the urban area of Kowloon.

==Education==

The Hong Kong Design Institute (HKDI) is well known for the shape of its building. Designed by French architects Coldefy &amp; Associs, it resembles a piece of paper floating mid-air featuring a glazed box raised seven storeys above the ground on four lattice-steel towers that rest on a sloping, grass-covered podium. Total construction cost amounted to HK$1.2 billion, it was opened in November 2010.

The Hong Kong Institute of Vocational Education (IVE) – Lee Wai Lee campus is located next to HKDI. Also, the campus of Saint Francis University is located at Tiu Keng Leng. It is the first Catholic University in Hong Kong.

<text>The London and Croydon Railway (L&amp;CR) was an early railway in England. It opened in 1839 and in February 1846 merged with other railways to form the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&amp;SCR).

==Origins==

===The Croydon line and other railways===
The Surrey Iron Railway had been opened in 1806 between Wandsworth and Croydon; it was a plateway operating on the toll principle, in which carriers could move wagons with their own horses. However, the Surrey Iron Railway&#x27;s terminal on the Thames was rather far west and sea-going vessels were discouraged from connecting with it.

Edge railways using locomotive traction represented a clear technological advance, marked particularly by the Stockton and Darlington Railway (1825) and the Liverpool and Manchester Railway (1830), and promoters put forward a scheme to link Croydon, then an industrial town, with London. The Croydon Canal of 1809 was moribund, and it was proposed to purchase it and to utilise its course. It was to extend northwards from the Croydon Canal terminal at New Cross, so as to make a junction at Corbetts Lane (then spelt Corbets Lane), in Bermondsey with the London and Greenwich Railway; its trains were to run over that line to its London Bridge station.

The engineer Joseph Gibbs surveyed the route; this involved complex judgments, and is described below. The company obtained an authorising act of Parliament, the (5 &amp; 6 Will. 4. c. x) on 12 June 1835. The line was long and at the southern end followed the alignment of the Croydon Canal from Anerley to a terminus at Croydon, with a locomotive depot, on the site of the canal basin. This was later to be developed to the present-day West Croydon station.
The London and Greenwich Railway Company intended that its proposed London Bridge terminus would accommodate trains of several other companies and had acquired land sufficient for the purpose; at this time however it had inadequate funds to carry out the actual construction, and the Croydon company was obliged to do the work itself, taking some of the London and Greenwich Railway Company&#x27;s land on the north side for the purpose, obtaining the necessary powers in the on 14 July 1836. At this stage the Greenwich line had not yet been opened into London Bridge: this was completed on 1 December 1836.

The South Eastern Railway got its authorising act of Parliament, the South Eastern Railway Act 1836 (6 &amp; 7 Will. 4. c. lxxv), on 21 June 1836 for a line from Dover, joining the London and Croydon line end-on at Croydon, and the London and Brighton Railway obtained its London and Brighton Railway Act 1837 (7 Will. 4 &amp; 1 Vict. c. cxix) on 15 June 1837, also relying on running over the London and Croydon from Norwood. Over the following two years the point of convergence with the L&amp;CR was varied, but all the lines converged at or before Corbett&#x27;s Lane Junction. Capacity at London Bridge was clearly going to be an issue, and the L&amp;CR took further powers (11 June 1838) to enlarge its station then under construction at London Bridge. A parliamentary select committee also became concerned about the safety of the arrangements, and in response the London and Greenwich Railway Company was given powers to widen its viaduct on the southern side so as to make a four-track viaduct from Corbett&#x27;s Lane to London Bridge.

===Determining the route===
In its first conception, the line was to follow the bed of the Croydon Canal for much of the route. A jury determined the value of the canal as £40,250 as if it was a going concern. When detailed route design was undertaken (before handover of the canal), it was clear that the meanderings and zigzags made by the canal were unsuitable, and that the line needed to be built alongside the general course. The levels around New Cross were also difficult, and to find the best compromise a 1 in 80 gradient was selected, involving at that time the use of assistant engines due to the steepness. Even so, a cutting of considerable depth was unavoidable.

When the SER&#x27;s line became authorised, the London and Croydon Railway Company reconsidered the matter, as its line would now be part of a trunk route, and it was decided to ease the gradient from New Cross to 1 in 100; this involved a deeper, and longer, cutting, and the line would only reach surface level at the present-day Forest Hill station. The deeper cuttings required more surface area of land; and some curvature improvements further south also required unanticipated land acquisition.

Stations were to be at New Cross, Dartmouth Arms (named after a nearby hostelry that is still extant in 2013), Sydenham, Penge, Annerley (later Anerley; the Scottish owner of the land said that his was the &quot;annerley hoose&quot; in the area), Jolly Sailor (also named after a public house just north of the current Norwood Junction). and the terminus at Croydon (now West Croydon).

Freight traffic was considered to be impracticable for handling at London Bridge, and the London freight terminal point was built at New Cross; the adjacent Surrey Canal was considered to give sufficient onward connectivity. There was also an engine shed at New Cross; coal was brought in by the canal, there being at the time no rail connection to coal mines.

==Construction==

The consultant engineer was William Cubitt. The line proved to be expensive to build, costing £615,000 rather than the estimated £180,000, due to large cuttings at New Cross and Forest Hill. The only severe gradient was 1:100 (1%) for from New Cross to Forest Hill. In addition to the viaduct where it joined the L&amp;GR, there were 18 bridges, and three level road crossings, each attended by a &quot;policeman&quot;.

The track was laid to standard gauge, although during the construction the directors were undecided and ordered extra-long sleepers with a view to conversion to broad gauge, which never happened. The line used &quot;Vignoles&quot; flat bottomed rail, broader in the base and lower than modern rail. These were mounted on longitudinal timbers with cross sleepers.

A new station was built at London Bridge for Croydon trains, on the north side of the L&amp;GR one, with track shared as far as Corbetts Lane. The line opened on 5 June 1839 There were six intermediate stations, at New Cross (now New Cross Gate), Dartmouth Arms (now Forest Hill), Sydenham, Penge, Anerley Bridge (now Anerley), and Jolly Sailor (replaced by Norwood Junction in 1859). The terminus was at London Road in Croydon.

Because of the planned additional traffic following the opening of the L&amp;BR and the SER, the L&amp;CR sought powers to widen the viaduct from Corbetts Lane to London Bridge in 1840. Parliament decided that the widening should be undertaken by the owners, the L&amp;GR. This work was completed by 1842. By this time the L&amp;CR had joined the newly opened SER and L&amp;BR to form a committee, and agreement was reached with the L&amp;GR to exchange their stations at London Bridge in 1843 in order to avoid their trains crossing over at Corbetts Junction.

===Bricklayers Arms Terminus===

By 1843, the L&amp;CR and the SER were becoming concerned about the tolls charged by the L&amp;GR for the use of its line between Corbetts Junction and London Bridge. As a result, they jointly constructed a branch from the L&amp;CR at New Cross to a new terminus designed by Lewis Cubitt at Bricklayers Arms, thereby avoiding use of the L&amp;GR. From 1844 the SER transferred all of its services to the new terminus, and the L&amp;CR operated services from both termini. This arrangement lasted until 1852.

===Epsom extension===
In April 1844 the L&amp;CR directors approved an extension to Epsom, not completed until after the railway became a part of the LB&amp;SCR.

===Deptford Dockyard extension===

In July 1846 an act of Parliament, the (9 &amp; 10 Vict. c. ccxxxiv), was passed granting authority for a branch from New Cross to Deptford Dockyard. This was commenced after the railway became a part of the LB&amp;SCR.

==Locomotives and rolling stock==
The railway owned seven 2-2-2 locomotives and one 0-4-2. The first five 2-2-2s and one 0-4-2 were built by Sharp, Roberts and Company, and were delivered between July 1838 and July 1839. The remaining two were built by G. and J. Rennie, in August 1838 and May 1839.

===Summary table===
===Brighton, Croydon and Dover Joint Committee===
From 1842 the L&amp;CR pooled its locomotive stock with the SER, to form the Croydon and Dover Joint Committee. From March 1844 the L&amp;BR joined the scheme and the locomotives were thereafter operated by the Brighton, Croydon and Dover Joint Committee, which also ordered further locomotives. These arrangements caused great operating problems for the L&amp;CR and the L&amp;BR and in April 1845 they gave notice of withdrawal from the arrangement in January 1846, when the locomotives were divided between the three companies. The L&amp;CR received eight locomotives back in April 1845, seven of which had been owned by other railways.

====Summary table====
===Motive power depots and workshop===
The railway opened an early example of a roundhouse motive power depot at New Cross 1 June 1839, but this brick-built building was burned down 14 October 1844. It was replaced by a nearby traditional straight shed in 1845, and the original turntable and associated lines were incorporated into a locomotive repair depot in the same year. There was also a small depot at Croydon

===Carriage stock===
There were first and second-class four-wheeled carriages, both of the three-compartment type usual for the period, the main difference seeming to be that the first-class coaches carried 18 passengers, the second-class 24.

==Operation==
The line into London Bridge became increasingly congested so at Corbetts Lane a white disc was installed, to be operated by the pointsman. If the disc was face on, or a red light at night, the route was set for Croydon; edge on or a white light, the junction was set for Greenwich. It is believed that this was first fixed signal used to control a junction. Greenwich trains ran every 15 minutes, Croydon trains were hourly. The first railway semaphore signal was erected by Charles Hutton Gregory on the railway at New Cross, about 1842.

==Atmospheric railway==
In 1844, the L&amp;CR was given parliamentary authority to lay an additional line next to the existing track and test an atmospheric railway system. Pumping stations were built at Portland Road, Croydon and Dartmouth Arms, which created a vacuum in a pipe laid between the running rails. A free-running piston in the pipe was attached to the train through a slit sealed by a leather valve. The piston, and hence the train, was propelled towards the pumping station by atmospheric pressure. The pumping stations were built in a Gothic style, with a very tall ornate tower, which served both as a chimney and as an exhaust vent for air pumped from the propulsion pipe.

As part of the construction works for the atmospheric system, the world&#x27;s first railway flyover (overpass) was constructed south of Jolly Sailor, to carry the atmospheric line over the conventional steam line. The railway experienced many problems with the pumping engines and the valves during 1846, creating dissatisfaction among the shareholders with the directors. The added directors from the L&amp;BR, after the amalgamation in August, were even less interested in continuing the experiment. In 1847, the atmospheric experiment was abandoned. The engine house at Dartmouth Arms was largely demolished in 1851 and an electricity sub-station was built on the site in 1928. Stone from the Croydon pumping station was reused in construction of the Surrey Street waterworks building, which still exists. According to one historian the use of the atmospheric system cost the railway £500,000 and was &#x27;a sad fiasco&#x27;.
===Accidents===
The railway is not known to have suffered any serious accidents, which is remarkable given its early operation over shared lines.

==Amalgamation==
As a result of the poor financial performance of both the L&amp;CR and the L&amp;BR, a group of shareholders organised an amalgamation of these companies with the Brighton and Chichester Railway and the Brighton Lewes and Hastings Railway (both under construction) to form the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway on 27 February 1846.

<text>DJM Records (also known as Dick James Music) was a British independent record label, set up in the late 1960s by British music publisher Dick James. It was distributed by Pye Records in the UK, and various other companies around the world, including the US.

The first release on the label was by Dave Sealey and entitled &quot;It Takes a Thief&quot;, which had been adapted from the theme music from the television series for which a lyric was written. Frank Neilson was A&amp;R manager from 1976 to 1979, before he moved to Polydor Records. Andy Stinton was Promotions Manager for several years before moving to Canada in 1980 to start his own communications company.

Elton John was prominent on DJM, except in the United States and Canada where his records were issued on the MCA Records label. In 1976, he began his own label, The Rocket Record Company. He brought a lawsuit against DJM in the 1980s over the rights to his earlier (pre-1976) work.

Other acts on the label in the 1970s included Ireland&#x27;s Celtic rockers Horslips; John Inman, Mr. Bloe, who included pianist and harmonica player Harry Pitch; former Fleetwood Mac member Danny Kirwan, who recorded three albums for DJM, &quot;Second Chapter&quot; (1975), &quot;Midnight in San Juan&quot; (1976), and &quot;Hello There Big Boy!&quot; (1979); The Tremeloes, after their departure from CBS/Epic in 1974; singer and actor Dennis Waterman; and Johnny &quot;Guitar&quot; Watson, who had several successful singles and albums in the US.

Roger Hodgson – prior to joining Supertramp – issued a UK single on DJM under the name &quot;Argosy&quot;. This record was also released on Congress Records (a division of Kapp Records) in the US.

DJM had a daughter label called &quot;Weekend Records&quot; for releases relating to the ITV contractor London Weekend Television such as T.V. themes and some releases appeared both on the DJM and &quot;Weekend Records&quot; labels. Notable releases include &quot;Hi Summer&quot; by Carl Wayne.

After Dick James&#x27; death in 1986, the DJM catalogue was acquired by PolyGram. Today, the catalogue is now owned by Polygram&#x27;s successor-in-interest Universal Music Group.

<doc id="1184354" wikidata="Q1336879" url="?curid=1184354" title="John Dall">
<text>John Dall (born John Dall Thompson; May 26, 1920 – January 15, 1971) was an American actor. Primarily a stage actor, he is best remembered today for portraying the cool-minded intellectual killer in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Rope&quot; (1948), and the companion of trigger-happy femme fatale Peggy Cummins in the 1950 film noir &quot;Gun Crazy&quot;. He also had a substantial role in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s&quot; Spartacus&quot; (1960). He first came to fame as the young Welsh mining prodigy who comes alive under the tutelage of Bette Davis in &quot;The Corn Is Green&quot; (1945), for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

==Early life==
 John Dall Thompson was born in New York City on May 26, 1920, the younger son of Charles Jenner Thompson and his wife, Henry (&quot;née&quot; Worthington). (Sources which cite Dall&#x27;s birth name as John &quot;Jenner&quot; Thompson and his birth year as 1918 appear to be in error.) His father was a civil engineer. His elder brother, Worthington Thompson, was later a decorated lieutenant in the 517th Parachute Regimental Combat Team.

In the 1920s, the Thompsons moved to Panama, where Charles worked on the construction of the airport there. While in Panama, Dall was in a theatre when a cast member fell ill and Dall stepped in; this inspired his desire to act. His father committed suicide in 1929, and his widow returned to New York City with John the following year.

Dall attended Horace Mann School and briefly enrolled at Columbia University, where he intended to follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps by studying engineering. Deciding that acting was his true vocation, he left Columbia and studied at the Theodora Irvine School of Theater and the Pasadena Playhouse. He also studied at the Petit Theatre in New Orleans.

==Career==
===Theatre===
Dall spent six years acting in various stock companies, notably Clare Tree Major&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Theatre. He also worked in companies headed by Aline MacMahon, Arthur Byron, and Edith Atwater, among others.

Dall had small roles on Broadway during the 1941–42 season in &quot;R.U.R.&quot; and &quot;Janie&quot;. In 1942–43, he played the lead of Quizz Martin in the touring company &quot;The Eve of St Mark&quot;. He was well received and replaced William Prince on Broadway so Prince could take a vacation. His performance was spotted by Jack Warner&#x27;s wife and resulted in a Warner&#x27;s screen test for Dall. Warner Bros. offered him a contract but he would only take it if he could have time off to do a play. (Warners also signed Prince.)

===&quot;The Corn Is Green&quot;===
Dall made his film debut in &quot;The Corn Is Green&quot; (1945), under the direction of Irving Rapper. Richard Waring was originally slated to play the role, but had been called into the army. The film was shot in the middle of 1944. Warners were impressed with the rushes and signed Dall to a new contract.

===&quot;Dear Ruth&quot;===
Dall returned to the stage to play the lead in Norman Krasna&#x27;s &quot;Dear Ruth&quot; (1944), under the direction of Moss Hart. It was a huge success. &quot;The New York Times&quot; said Dall gives &quot;a graceful and easy performance&quot;. Even before &quot;The Corn Is Green&quot; was released Warners announced Dall was one of six contractees they intended to build into a star (the others were Lauren Bacall, Dane Clark, Faye Emerson, Robert Hutton and William Prince.) After &quot;The Corn Is Green&quot; was released, Dall received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. He was called one of the &quot;hottest finds&quot; in Hollywood, and Warners tried to find a film for him and co-star Joan Lorring.

The film rights to &quot;Dear Ruth&quot; were sold to Paramount who cast William Holden in the part originated by Dall. Warners brought the screen rights to John Patrick&#x27;s play &quot;The Hasty Heart&quot; and announced Dall would play the role originated by Richard Basehart. Warners gave Dall three months leave to perform &quot;The Hasty Heart&quot; (1945) on stage on the road. However the film was not made for several more years by which time Richard Todd had been cast in the role.

In May 1946, Warners released Dall from his contract. He only made one film for the studio.

===Universal===
Paramount announced they were interested in signing Dall and Edward G. Robinson for a role in an adaptation of &quot;The Wayfarers&quot;. In May 1946 he signed a seven-year deal with David O. Selznick&#x27;s Vanguard Films. Dall performed &quot;Hasty Heart&quot; in summer stock.

Dall wound up making no films for Selznick. Instead he went over to Universal, where he signed a contract. He played Deanna Durbin&#x27;s love interest in &quot;Something in the Wind&quot; (1947); the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described him as &quot;ill at ease&quot;. He was in &quot;Another Part of the Forest&quot; (1948), based on the play by Lillian Hellman.

===&quot;Rope&quot; and &quot;Gun Crazy&quot;===
Alfred Hitchcock cast Dall in &quot;Rope&quot; (1948) as one of two killers (the other played by Farley Granger) who match wits with James Stewart. The film was not a big hit on release but its reputation has since grown.

After &quot;Rope&quot; it was reported he would make &quot;Shadow of Fear&quot; for Michael Curtiz but this did not materialize.

Dall did &quot;The Wind and the Rain&quot; for &quot;Theatre Guild on the Air&quot; then returned to Broadway to appear in Daniel Taradash&#x27;s adaptation of Jean-Paul Sartre&#x27;s &quot;Red Gloves&quot; with Charles Boyer, directed by Jed Harris. It was a minor hit. Brooks Atkinson said Boyer and Dall&#x27;s acting were the best thing about the production.

Dall made his TV debut in &quot;Miracle in the Rain&quot; for &quot;The Chevrolet Tele-Theatre&quot; in 1949. He appeared as one of the leads in &quot;Gun Crazy&quot; (1950) opposite Irish actress Peggy Cummins.

Dall had a supporting role in &quot;The Man Who Cheated Himself&quot; (1950). He was in the short-run revival of &quot;The Heiress&quot; (1950) on Broadway with Basil Rathbone.

===Television===
In October 1950 Dall said that TV acting was better done by movie actors, who understood technique, than stage actors, who needed audience response.

In late 1950, he appeared in &quot;The Man&quot; by Mel Dinelli on stage in Los Angeles with Gladys George. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said he played his role with &quot;tremendous assurance&quot;.

In stock he appeared in &quot;The Hasty Heart&quot; (1952), &quot;Gramercy Ghost&quot; (1952), &quot;The Moon is Blue&quot; (1953), &quot;The Man Who Came to Dinner&quot;, and &quot;Born Yesterday&quot; (1953).

Dall did much work in television, appearing in guest roles on such shows as &quot;Lights Out&quot; (&quot;Pit of the Dead&quot;), &quot;The Clock&quot; (&quot;A Right Smart Trick&quot;), &quot;Studio One in Hollywood&quot; (&quot;The Doctor&#x27;s Wife&quot;), &quot;Broadway Television Theatre&quot; (&quot;Outward Bound&quot;, &quot;The Hasty Heart&quot;), &quot;Suspense&quot; (&quot;The Invisible Killer&quot;, &quot;The Tenth Reunion&quot;), &quot;General Electric Theatre&quot; (&quot;The Coward of Fort Bennett&quot;) and &quot;Schlitz Playhouse&quot; (&quot;And Practically Strangers&quot;). Other theatre performances in stock included &quot;The Male Animal&quot; (1954).

Dall returned to Broadway for Leslie Stevens&#x27; &quot;Champagne Complex&quot;, which had a short run in 1955.

===Later career===
Dall&#x27;s first film in eight years was &quot;Spartacus&quot; (1960), where he played a Roman soldier based on Gaius Claudius Glaber. He was the villain in MGM&#x27;s &quot;Atlantis, the Lost Continent&quot; (1961), his final theatrical feature.

Dall guest-starred in four episodes of TV&#x27;s &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, including playing murder victim Edward Franklin in the 1962 episode &quot;The Case of the Weary Watchdog&quot; and murder victim Colin Durant in the 1963 episode &quot;The Case of the Reluctant Model&quot;.

==Personal life==
Film historians William J. Mann and Karen Burroughs Hannsberry have remarked that Dall was gay but claimed in media interviews to have had a brief marriage in the early 1940s. No marriage certificate has come to light, and his death certificate records him as &quot;never married&quot;. At a studio request, Hedda Hopper once linked his name with Jane Withers romantically. According to music journalist Phil Milstein, at the time of his death Dall had lapsed into alcoholism and was living with his partner, actor Clement Brace (died 1996).

==Death==

Dall sustained a serious fall while visiting London in October 1970 and died of cardiac arrest, a complication of myocarditis, at his home in Beverly Hills, California, on January 15, 1971, aged 50. His body was donated to medical science.

Dall&#x27;s papers are held at the Margaret Herrick Library in Beverly Hills, California.

<text>The Simón Bolívar University (Universidad Simón Bolívar in Spanish) or USB, is a public institution divided in two branches, one in Miranda state and one in Vargas state, with scientific and technological orientation. The Simón Bolívar University is arguably the most prestigious science and technology university in Venezuela and one of the most important ones in South America. It is the most selective higher education school in the country admitting only the 95th percentile of its standardized admission test.

The university began academic activities in 1970 in the Sartenejas Valley in Caracas and seven years later in Camurí Grande Valley, Vargas. Currently has these two locations. Its rectory is Sartenejas headquarters, located in the Baruta municipality of Miranda state.

The USB has graduated approximately 25,000 engineers, architects, urban planners and graduates, along with 5,000 specialists, masters and doctors.

According to a research by the QS World University Rankings 2015, the USB has the No. 2 position nationally, while ranked No. 34 in Latin America.

==History==
In May 1967 the government created a commission composed by Luis Manuel Peñalver, Luis Carbonell, Mercedes Fermín, Miguel Angel Pérez and Héctor Isava to study the possibility of creating a new university that would offer studies to directly promote the economic and social development of the country. On July 18, 1967, the President of Venezuela Raúl Leoni signed a decree which officially founded the university as an &quot;Instituto Experimental de Educación Superior&quot; focused mainly on scientific and technological research. The original name given to the university was &quot;Universidad de Caracas&quot;; however, the first name of the Central University of Venezuela was also &quot;Universidad de Caracas&quot; and it was still known by that name. Members of The National Academy of History, the Bolivarian Society of Venezuela and other important institutions expressed their wish to relate the name of El Libertador Simón Bolívar to the name of the recently created university, which resulted in the change to the name of &quot;Universidad Experimental Simón Bolívar&quot; in 1969. Ernesto Mayz Vallenilla was the rector when president Rafael Caldera inaugurated the University on 19 January 1970.

From the confluence between the name &quot;Universidad Simón Bolívar&quot; and its slogan &quot;The University of the Future&quot;, the Venezuelan designer, Gerd Leufert developed the design inspired by the photographic reproduction of an electrical circuit. The figure includes eight semicircular lines and a small rectangle in the center of them, forming a structure similar to a rounded pyramid, whose meaning is that of a gateway, which represents the unity of various knowledge and their projections into the future.

In 2010, in the dawn of the election day of the parliamentary elections, security forces raided a call center set up by Voto Joven that had been installed in the university, entering with firearms and taking three computers, without a search warrant and violating the university autonomy.

As of 2010, Simón Bolívar University has over 38,000 alumni.

== Campus ==
=== Location ===

The closed-campus-style grounds are located in the Sartenejas valley, in the municipality of Baruta, Miranda State. Its total surface is approximately of 3,489,000 m2.

=== Library ===
The Simón Bolívar University Library (USB) is an academic library with special emphasis on sciences, mathematics, engineering, and humanities.

The library of the USB has, among its special collections, the archive. His archive includes the books of his personal Library, in addition to his own philosophical works as professor and researcher. The archive has a particular relevance within the university, not only because Mayz Vallenilla was its founder dean, but because he devoted a large part of his philosophical research to the understanding of the modern human being within the context of metatechnics. Concept that he developed witnessing the profound changes and advances in computer science and forecasting the possibilities of artificial intelligence. His book, The Foundations of Meta-Technics, sought to capture an understanding of a trans-human logic and, with it, of a new human identity for the XXI century.

In Recent years the lack of resources contribute to deteriorate the infraestructure.

In September 2021 the professor Alejandro Teruel resigned to the Dean position.

==Extracurricular activities==
The university fosters a thriving environment for extracurricular activities. Its student clubs are the origin of the most awarded Latin American teams in international competitions. The Model of United Nations team is one of the best in the world. The Harvard National Model of United Nations team has the most &quot;Best International 
Delegation&quot; Awards in the history of the conference (5 times), the World Model of United Nations team has won the &quot;Best Large delegation award&quot; 3 times. The Baja SAE has ranked top 5 during 10 continuous years.

The student clubs are very organized and disciplined teams. They typically have strict admission processes and put a strong focus on hard work and commitment.

== Traditions ==


Several myths and legends are part of the student&#x27;s culture:
La Cebolla: The logo of the university is called &quot;La Cebolla&quot; or &quot;the onion&quot; in Spanish in contrast to its technological symbolism (it was inspired by the photograph of an electric circuit). It was designed to represent a group of doors one into another, a metaphor for the hard work and effort students have to do in order to walk from the big door that leads them in, to the little one that leads them out (see Nuestros Símbolos | Universidad Simón Bolívar).
A brief history and description:The sculpture creation started in 1975 when Gabriel Martin Landrove, a USB architect student, won an institutional contest. Construction took place until July 5, 1991, when Phd Professor Stefan Zarea conducted the final works and inaugurated it. The artistic concept was inspired by the morning dew condensed over a tree sleeve falling down into another one. The sleeves are represented with 576 metal trowels arranged as a 48 by12 matrix in a conical truncated structure that allows the water to create multiple small waterfalls. This huge structure can rotate over its own vertical axis and the movement is produced by a pelton wheel dispose at the lower level of the conical structure. The rise of the water to the top and its rotational momentum is produced by hydraulic force drive by an electrical pump. There is also a tree level shallow pool, a top circular viewer and an intricate circular walk sides that complements the design.

The university turns it on during special occasions, like graduations, and since 2008 is under heavy maintenance program. On January 19, 2010, the maintenance department finished the second stage of its restoration with the restart of the conical structure including their rotational movement. It is left for the close future, the restoration of the mirror pools, water filtration systems and night illumination.

<doc id="1184362" wikidata="Q1680566" url="?curid=1184362" title="James Holland (North Carolina politician)">
<text>James Holland (January 12, 1754 – May 19, 1823) was a U.S. Congressman from the state of North Carolina from 1795 to 1797 and from 1801 to 1811. He served as a captain in the Lincoln County Regiment of the North Carolina militia during the American Revolution.

==Early life==
Born near Rutherfordton, North Carolina, in 1754, Holland received a very limited education. He was a captain in the Lincoln County Regiment of the North Carolina militia from 1779 to 1781. He may have also seen service in the North Carolina Line between 1775 and 1783.

==Political career==
He rose in political office, serving as sheriff of Tryon County (1775), justice of the peace of Rutherford County (1780–1800), and comptroller of Rutherford County from (July 1782 - January 1785). He was first elected to the North Carolina State Senate, serving in 1783 and to the North Carolina House of Commons in 1786 and 1789, and was a delegate to the Fayetteville Convention which adopted the United States Constitution in 1789. From the legislature, he was appointed to the board of trustees for the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; he served as a trustee from 1789 to 1795.

In the 1790s, Holland studied law; he was admitted to the bar on October 15, 1793, and began to practice law in Rutherfordton. In 1794, he was elected as a Republican to the 4th United States Congress, serving from March 4, 1795, to March 3, 1797. Although he chose not to run for re-election to Congress, he returned to the North Carolina Senate in 1797 and returned to farming and a law practice.

Holland returned to Congress in 1801, serving for five terms (March 4, 1801 – March 3, 1811), stepping down in 1810. In 1811, Holland moved to Maury County, Tennessee, where he engaged in agricultural pursuits near Columbia. He served as a justice of the peace from 1812 to 1818 and died on his estate in 1821. He is buried in the Holland Family (now known as Watson) Cemetery, nine miles east of Columbia.

<doc id="1184376" wikidata="Q4860582" url="?curid=1184376" title="Bargmann's limit">
<text>In quantum mechanics, Bargmann&#x27;s limit, named for Valentine Bargmann, provides an upper bound on the number formula_1 of bound states with azimuthal quantum number formula_2 in a system with central potential formula_3. It takes the form

:formula_4

This limit is the best possible upper bound in such a way that for a given formula_2, one can always construct a potential formula_6 for which formula_1 is arbitrarily close to this upper bound. Note that the Dirac delta function potential attains this limit. After the first proof of this inequality by Valentine Bargmann in 1953, Julian Schwinger presented an alternative way of deriving it in 1961.

== Rigorous formulation and proof ==
Stated in a formal mathematical way, Bargmann&#x27;s limit goes as follows. Let formula_8 be a spherically symmetric potential, such that it is piecewise continuous in formula_9, formula_10 for formula_11 and formula_12 for formula_13, where formula_14 and formula_15. If

:formula_16

then the number of bound states formula_1 with azimuthal quantum number formula_2 for a particle of mass formula_19 obeying the corresponding Schrödinger equation, is bounded from above by

:formula_20

Although the original proof by Valentine Bargmann is quite technical, the main idea follows from two general theorems on ordinary differential equations, the Sturm Oscillation Theorem and the Sturm-Picone Comparison Theorem. If we denote by formula_21 the wave function subject to the given potential with total energy formula_22 and azimuthal quantum number formula_2, the Sturm Oscillation Theorem implies that formula_1 equals the number of nodes of formula_21. From the Sturm-Picone Comparison Theorem, it follows that when subject to a stronger potential formula_26 (i.e. formula_27 for all formula_28), the number of nodes either grows or remains the same. Thus, more specifically, we can replace the potential formula_3 by formula_30. For the corresponding wave function with total energy formula_22 and azimuthal quantum number formula_2, denoted by formula_33, the radial Schrödinger equation becomes

:formula_34

with formula_35. By applying variation of parameters, one can obtain the following implicit solution

:formula_36

where formula_37 is given by

:formula_38

If we now denote all successive nodes of formula_33 by formula_40, one can show from the implicit solution above that for consecutive nodes formula_41 and formula_42

:formula_43

From this, we can conclude that

:formula_44

proving Bargmann&#x27;s limit. Note that as the integral on the right is assumed to be finite, so must be formula_45 and formula_1. Furthermore, for a given value of formula_2, one can always construct a potential formula_6 for which formula_1 is arbitrarily close to Bargmann&#x27;s limit. The idea to obtain such a potential, is to approximate Dirac delta function potentials, as these attain the limit exactly. An example of such a construction can be found in Bargmann&#x27;s original paper.

<text>The National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women (), also known informally as White Ribbon Day (&quot;Jour du Ruban Blanc&quot;), is a day commemorated in Canada each December 6, the anniversary of the 1989 École Polytechnique massacre, in which armed student Marc Lépine murdered fourteen women and injured fourteen others in the name of &quot;fighting feminism&quot;. The commemoration date was established by the Parliament of Canada in 1991. The legislation was introduced in the House of Commons as a private member&#x27;s bill by Dawn Black, Member of Parliament for New Westminster-Burnaby, British Columbia, and received all-party support.

Canadian flags on all federal buildingsincluding the Peace Tower on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Ontarioare flown at half-mast on December 6. Canadians are encouraged to observe a minute of silence on December 6 and to wear a white ribbon (or a purple ribbon) as a commitment to end violence against women.

The victims of the 1989 massacre were Geneviève Bergeron, 21; Hélène Colgan, 23; Nathalie Croteau, 23; Barbara Daigneault, 22; Anne-Marie Edward, 21; Maud Haviernick, 29; Barbara Klucznik, 31; Maryse Laganière, 25; Maryse Leclair, 23; Anne-Marie Lemay, 22; Sonia Pelletier, 23; Michèle Richard, 21; Annie St-Arneault, 23; and Annie Turcotte, 20.

In response to the event, many Canadians have worked hard to establish memorial sites all across the country to ensure that people will become more aware of the incident that occurred. This is intended to force society to recognize how often violence occurs towards women and to appreciate the lives of the women who were killed. Feminism advocates and activists trying to stop violence directed towards women have shown concern about using the massacre to solely represent violence against women.

The news took the ascribed perspective of the killer having mental problems. This effectively dismissed feminist analyses stating that “the killer went to this extent to proclaim his anti-feminist opinion.”

<doc id="1184385" wikidata="Q3881026" url="?curid=1184385" title="Office of the Comptroller of the Currency">
<text>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is an independent bureau within the United States Department of the Treasury that was established by the National Currency Act of 1863 and serves to charter, regulate, and supervise all national banks and federal thrift institutions and the federally licensed branches and agencies of foreign banks in the United States. The acting comptroller of the currency is Rodney E. Hood, who took office on February 10, 2025.

==Duties and functions==

Headquartered in Washington, D.C., it has four district offices located in New York City, Chicago, Dallas and Denver. It has an additional 92 operating locations throughout the United States. It is an independent bureau of the United States Department of the Treasury and is headed by the comptroller of the currency, appointed to a five-year term by the president with the consent of the U.S. Senate.

The OCC pursues a number of main objectives:

* to ensure the safety and soundness of the national banking system;
* to foster competition by allowing banks to offer new products and services;
* to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of OCC supervision especially to reduce the regulatory burden;
* to ensure fair and equal access to financial services to all Americans;
* to enforce anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing laws that apply to national banks and federally licensed branches and agencies of international banks; and
* to investigate misconduct committed by institution-affiliated parties of national banks, including officers, directors, employees, agents and independent contractors (including appraisers, attorneys and accountants).

The OCC participates in interagency activities in order to maintain the integrity of the federal banking system. By monitoring capital, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity, sensitivity to market risk, information technology, consumer compliance, and community reinvestment, the OCC is able to determine whether or not the bank is operating safely and soundly, providing fair access and treatment to customers, and complying with all applicable laws and regulations. The OCC was created by Abraham Lincoln to fund the American Civil War but was later transformed into a regulatory agency to instill confidence in the federal banking system, ensure it operates in a safe and sound manner, and treats customers fairly.

The OCC regulates and supervises about 1,200 national banks, federally-licensed savings associations, and federally-licensed branches of foreign banks in the United States, accounting for more than two-thirds of the total assets of all U.S. commercial banks (as of September 30, 2020).

Other financial regulatory agencies like the OCC include the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (of which the comptroller serves as a director), the Federal Reserve, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the National Credit Union Administration. The OCC routinely interacts and cooperates with other government agencies, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, the Office of Foreign Asset Control, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Department of Justice, and the Department of Homeland Security.

The comptroller serves as a director of the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and member of the Financial Stability Oversight Council and the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council.

===Preemption of state banking regulation===
In 2003, the OCC proposed regulations to preempt virtually all state banking and financial services laws for national banks and their diverse range of non-bank, corporate operating subsidiaries. Despite opposition from the National Conference of State Legislatures, the OCC&#x27;s regulations went into effect. In &quot;Watters v. Wachovia Bank, N.A.&quot; , the United States Supreme Court validated the preemption of state regulations by the OCC, ruling that the OCC, not the states, has the authority to subject national banks to &quot;general supervision&quot; and &quot;oversight&quot;:

State regulators cannot interfere with the business of banking by subjecting national banks or their OCC-licensed operating subsidiaries to multiple audits and surveillance under rival oversight regimes.

In &quot;Cuomo v. Clearing House Association, L. L. C.&quot; , the Court clarified its decision in &quot;Watters&quot;, stating that federal banking regulations did not preempt the ability of states to enforce their own fair-lending laws, as general supervision and control&#x27; and &#x27;oversight&#x27; are worlds apart from law enforcement&quot;, and therefore states retain law enforcement powers but have restricted &quot;visitorial&quot; powers over national banks (i.e., the right to examine the affairs of a corporation).

===HelpWithMyBank.gov===
In July 2007, the OCC launched HelpWithMyBank.gov to assist customers of national banks and provide answers to national banking questions.

===Financial inclusion===
On July 10, 2020, the OCC announced the launch of Project REACh. REACh stands for Roundtable for Economic Access and Change, and the project brings together leaders from the banking industry, national civil rights organizations, business, and technology to reduce specific barriers that prevent full, equal, and fair participation in the nation&#x27;s economy.

== History ==
During the American Civil War, leaders of the U.S. federal government, including President Abraham Lincoln and Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase, drafted plans for a national banking system. These plans were put into action by the National Currency Act of 1863, subsequently amended by the National Bank Act, which created the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to administer the new system. Hugh McCulloch, former president of the state-owned Bank of Indiana, was chosen to be the first comptroller of the currency.

Under the law, banks could apply to the OCC for a charter issued by the federal government. Approved banks would purchase U.S. government bonds, generating cash flow for the government. The bonds would then be deposited with the U.S. Treasury to provide security to back the paper money to be issued by the banks, a new uniform United States currency that could be redeemed for gold or silver at banks around the country. By ensuring the new currency was backed by the government-held bonds, the system gave users greater confidence in the stability of the paper money.

By 1868, the OCC had 72 staff, a third of them women. They processed charter applications and distributed currency to national banks. Until 1913, these staff were paid by distance distributed and did not have set salaries.

In 1913, the Federal Reserve Act established a central bank, the Federal Reserve, to issue American currency. The OCC&#x27;s role shifted to bank examination and regulation, though it retained &quot;currency&quot; as part of its name. In response to the growing power of local banks, the OCC insisted on deregulating national banks in order to compete, which was realized in the McFadden Act of 1927. In 1937, the OCC signed an agreement with the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to standardize the regulation of banks between the agencies.

In the 1960s, 21st comptroller James J. Saxon passed a number of controversial regulations, including one which allowed national banks to underwrite revenue bonds for the governments of states and municipalities. Many of these were later overturned in court. However, some reforms, like creating international banking and economics units and strengthening the law department, remained after his term.

The OCC was involved in the response during and after the financial crisis of 2007–08, including work with the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), designing stress tests for major banks, and collecting and analyzing data on home mortgage loans. The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 abolished the Office of Thrift Supervision and merged its former oversight functions into the OCC. The law also reassigned much of the OCC&#x27;s former compliance mandate to the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It further established the Financial Stability Oversight Council, on which the Comptroller of the Currency sits.

== Pronunciation ==
As with other uses of the English word &quot;comptroller&quot; there is some ambiguity about the agency&#x27;s pronunciation. Historically, the word was pronounced identically to &quot;controller,&quot; though it is increasingly pronounced as it is spelled (that is, &quot;comp-troller&quot;). According to &quot;Marketplace&quot;, former acting comptroller Keith Noreika and his successor, Joseph Otting, both used the latter pronunciation.

<text>Lindsey Hilsum (born 3 August 1958) is an English television journalist and writer. She is the International Editor for &quot;Channel 4 News&quot;, and has reported from six continents, including coverage of the major conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Kosovo, Rwanda and Ukraine in the past two decades. She is also a regular contributor to &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, &quot;The Observer&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;New Statesman&quot;, and &quot;Granta&quot;. Hilsum is author of the books &quot;Sandstorm: Libya in the Time of Revolution&quot; (2012) and &quot;In Extremis: The Life and Death of the War Correspondent Marie Colvin&quot; (2018). She is the recipient of several awards, among which are the Patron&#x27;s Medal from the Royal Geographical Society in 2017, and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize in the biography category for &quot;In Extremis&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Her father is professor Cyril Hilsum, a physicist best known for research that helped form the basis of modern LCD technology. She attended Worcester Grammar School for Girls and the University of Exeter, where she graduated with a degree in French and Spanish.

===Career===
Lindsey Hilsum is International Editor for &quot;Channel 4 News&quot;. She has covered major conflicts including the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and Kosovo and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In 2011, she reported the uprisings in Egypt and Bahrain, as well as Libya. She has also reported extensively from Iran and Zimbabwe, and was &quot;Channel 4 News&quot; China Correspondent from 2006 to 2008. During the 2004 US assault on Fallujah, she was embedded with a frontline marine unit, and in 1994, she was the only English-speaking foreign correspondent in Rwanda when the genocide began. Before becoming a journalist, Hilsum was an aid worker, first in Latin America and then in Africa.

Her first book, &quot;Sandstorm: Libya in the Time of Revolution&quot;, was published by Faber in the UK in April 2012, and by Penguin Press in the US in May 2012, and was shortlisted for the &quot;Guardian&quot; First Book Award (2012). Her second book, &quot;In Extremis&quot;, a biography of the late war correspondent Marie Colvin, alongside whom she worked in many war zones, was published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux in the US in November 2018, and by Chatto &amp; Windus in the UK in January 2019. &quot;In Extremis&quot; was shortlisted for the 2019 Costa Book Awards in the biography category, and won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize in the Biography category.

Her next book, &quot;I Brought the War with Me: Stories and Poems from the Front Line&quot;, published in September 2024, is a memoir that Andrew Motion describes as &quot;Remarkable: combines her exceptional experience as a war correspondent with selected poetry in an act of witness&quot;.

=== Views ===
In an interview with &quot;The Oxford Student&quot; in 2010, Hilsum remarked that American news media &quot;shows almost no images of death, of killing, of injury – the result was that people thought it was a blood-free war, and that affects how people feel about what their government does&quot;. In contrast, the Arab news media broadcasts much more graphic images of the reality of war. When deciding what is acceptable to broadcast from conflict zones, she argues that the crucial question is whether &quot;you are using those images as propaganda, or whether you are using them to try and tell people the truth about war&quot;. She concedes that this &quot;is a very difficult thing to get right&quot;, but is emphatic that it is not the place of a foreign correspondent to manipulate emotive images &quot;to make a political point&quot;.

==Awards==
Hilsum was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Essex in 2004 and has won several awards including the Royal Television Society Journalist of the Year, James Cameron Award, One World Broadcasting Trust award, Amnesty, Voice of the Listener &amp; Viewer and the Charles Wheeler Award. In 2017, she was awarded the Patron&#x27;s Medal of the Royal Geographical Society, &quot;for promoting the understanding of global conflict and inequality&quot;. She won the 2018 James Tait Black Memorial Prize (Biography) for &quot;In Extremis&quot;. In 2019, she was conferred with an honorary doctorate by SOAS University of London.

<text>Nathaniel Bagshaw Ward (1791 – 4 June 1868 in St Leonard&#x27;s, Sussex) was an English doctor who popularised a case for growing and transporting plants which was called the Wardian case.

== Biography ==
Ward was born in London to Stephen Smith Ward, a medical doctor. Little is known of his early years and family life, but he is believed to have been sent to Jamaica at the age of thirteen where he may have taken an interest in plants. He practised medicine in a poor area of the East End of London and took an interest in botany and entomology in spare time or when on vacation in Cobham, Kent. Tyler-Whittle in his book, &quot;The Plant Hunters&quot;, describes the area where he lived:

Ward qualified as a member of the Royal College of Surgeons in London in 1814, then later became a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1852.

His four sons, Stephen (born 1819), Nathaniel (born 1821), John (born 1824) and Richard (born 1831) all went on to qualify as doctors and surgeons. Stephen and Nathaniel after qualifying both worked as assistants with their father at the family East End practice. John joined the Royal Navy in 1846 as an assistant surgeon, serving with distinction on HMS Vengeance during the Crimean War, with the youngest son Richard having his own practice in Central London.

== Ward and the Wardian case ==

Ward first noticed the effects of a hermetically sealed glass container in 1829. He had placed a chrysalis of a sphinx moth in damp soil at the bottom of a bottle and covered it with a lid. A week later he noticed that a fern and grass seedling had sprouted from the soil. His interest piqued, he saw that evaporated moisture condensed on the walls of the bottle during the day, and ran back down into the soil towards evening, maintaining a constant humidity.

The glass case that he used to rear butterflies and grow plants was used widely during the time for introducing plants into the British colonies. His first experiments with plants inside glass cases started in 1830. In 1833 George Loddiges used Wardian cases for shipping plants from Australia and said that &quot;whereas I used formerly to lose nineteen out of the twenty of the plants I imported during the voyage, nineteen out of the twenty is now the average of those that survive&quot;. Loddiges was the vice-president of the Horticultural Society and Wardian cases became popular.
He attempted to make a greenhouse at the Clapham garden on the principle of the Wardian case. This was however critiqued by John Lindley in the &quot;Gardeners&#x27; Chronicle&quot;, who wrote that &quot;when it is opened and shut from day to day, it has no more right to the name [of Wardian case] than a common greenhouse&quot;. Lindley also wrote saying that Ward had an inordinate vanity and a desire to be &quot;recognised [as] a second Newton&quot;.

Dr Ward delivered a lecture on his discovery of a way to preserve plants in 1854 to the Royal Society at the Chelsea Physic Garden. He also worked on microscopy and helped in the development of the Chelsea Physic Garden as a member of the board. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1852.

Nathaniel Bagshaw Ward died at St Leonards in Sussex and is buried in an unmarked grave in West Norwood Cemetery.
He was honoured in 1837, when botanists William Henry Harvey and William Jackson Hooker named a species of moss from South Africa after him, &quot;Wardia&quot;.

On December 10, 1998, The Seagram Company completed its seven-month, $10.6 billion plan to acquire PolyGram and consolidated its music label unit with that of MCA Music, forming Universal Music Group.

Following the formation of Universal Music Group, and just in time for New Year&#x27;s Day 1999, Island Def Jam Music Group was founded by merging 14 or more recording labels, including those consisting of Island Records, Def Jam Recordings and Mercury Records. Although IDJMG brought all three labels together, they continued to operate as separate, autonomous labels. Music industry executive Lyor Cohen was installed as the unit&#x27;s president.

The Island Def Jam Music Group was also one of the four newly established Universal Music label groups, along with the Universal Motown Republic Group, Verve Label Group and Interscope Geffen A&amp;M Records.

In the United Kingdom, Island Records operated under Universal&#x27;s Island Records Group, while Def Jam UK was established and distributed by Mercury, which also managed its artists under the same banner. U.S. distribution was later revoked by IDJMG.

===1999-2001: Success===
IDJMG&#x27;s first official release was Biohazard&#x27;s album, &quot;New World Disorder&quot;, which was released by Mercury Records on June 8, 1999. By that time, the Rush Associated Labels portfolio (which had been a holding ground for Def Jam) was absorbed into Island Def Jam, with most of its labels, including Def Soul, Roc-A-Fella and Murder Inc. Records, joining forces all of which had been a part of the Def Jam Label Group since its PolyGram era between 1996 and 1998. For Island, some of its divisions had been either sold off or folded into IDJMG; both of which being 4th &amp; B&#x27;way Records and Island Black Music, with many of its artist rosters (including hip hop and R&amp;B acts) being transferred into Def Jam. 

For Mercury, its various artists of certain genres would later be drafted to either Motown (by then unrelated to IDJ until 2011), Def Jam (urban) or Island (pop, rock, alternative music and/or other non-urban genres). Some of Mercury&#x27;s non-urban roster would stay under the label by choice, while some of its international divisions either remained active or would be folded (including Mercury UK, which would oversee Def Jam or Island US releases).

In 2000, the unit launched Def Jam Germany, the first international Def Jam label. The following year, a country label, Lost Highway Records, was formed. The label operated as an imprint of Mercury Records, but had since been moved to Universal Music&#x27;s Nashville division following the dissolution of IDJMG in 2014. In the summer of 2001, Island Def Jam acquired a controlling interest in the rock label, Roadrunner Records. Edel SE &amp; Co. KGaA, a German music distributor which owned 17% of Roadrunner at the time, threatened to take legal action against Universal.

At the turn of the 21st Century the label achieved significant commercial success with records by influential hip hop artists including LL Cool J, Method Man, Redman, DMX, N.O.R.E.

===2002–2009: Restructure, Murder Inc. problems, Roc-A-Fella buyout and new leadership===
In early 2002, the label bought Mariah Carey&#x27;s label contract with future UMG sister label Virgin Records. In December 2002, she released &quot;Charmbracelet&quot;. In July 2002, Island Def Jam released Murder Inc. Records&#x27; second compilation album, &quot;Irv Gotti Presents: The Inc.&quot; The album peaked in the top 3 of the Billboard 200, and was certified Gold by the RIAA.

In 2003, Fefe Dobson, Everlast, and Patti LaBelle all became part of the unit. On January 3, the label unit was forced to cut all ties with producer Irv Gotti and his label, Murder Inc. Records, after a federal investigation and office raid considering allegations of money laundering in connection to an illegal operation maintained by a drug lord. On March 25, 2003, Island Def Jam released rap group The Diplomats&#x27; debut album &quot;Diplomatic Immunity&quot;. Despite not producing any major hits, the success of the singles &quot;Built This City&quot; and &quot;Dipset Anthem&quot; led to the album being certified Gold by the RIAA. That May, Island Def Jam received a cease and desist from Steve Gottlieb, founder of TVT Records, regarding the release of a Cash Money Click reunion album, which IDJMG restricted because of member Ja Rule&#x27;s obligations with Def Jam. 

President Lyor Cohen obliged Gotti and Ja Rule not to record the album for TVT, but instead have IDJMG and UMG distribute it to avoid conflict of interest. TVT&#x27;s lawsuit cites copyright infringement, fraud and tortious interference. Ultimately, TVT was awarded $132 million in damages with Cohen found liable for $56 million. It was later revised two years later as TVT&#x27;s cash award was reduced to $126,000 after Island Def Jam successfully appealed the judgment, claiming the situation was not fraud nor infringement, but instead, breach of contract. At the end of the year, Dobson&#x27;s self-titled debut was released on December 9, as was on the same date as Def Soul artists 112&#x27;s &quot;Hot &amp; Wet&quot; and Musiq Soulchild&#x27;s &quot;Soulstar&quot;. Then, in May 2004, Everlast and LaBelle released their albums, &quot;White Trash Beautiful&quot; and &quot;Timeless Journey&quot;, under Island and Def Soul Classics respectively. At the same time, L.A. Reid was appointed president and CEO of the Island Def Jam Music Group after he was dismissed from Arista Records. Cohen left Island Def Jam to join Warner Music Group, bringing with him colleagues Kevin Liles and Julie Greenwald.

In December, the unit acquired the remaining 50 percent interest in Roc-A-Fella Records in exchange for appointing co-founder Jay-Z president of Def Jam Recordings; the other 50 percent had been purchased by former Def Jam parent company, PolyGram, in 1997. As a result, fellow Roc-A-Fella cohorts Damon Dash and Kareem &quot;Biggs&quot; Burke were forced off the label. Then, in early 2005, the group extended a new label deal renewal with Ludacris&#x27; Disturbing tha Peace, making IDJMG a 50 percent stakeholder. In April, with L.A. Reid&#x27;s leadership, Mariah Carey returned from a two-year hiatus with &quot;The Emancipation of Mimi&quot;. The album sold 404,000 copies in its first week and opened to widespread acclaim from critics. That same year, Island Def Jam signed a newcomer, a Barbadian singer named Rihanna. Her debut single &quot;Pon de Replay&quot; was an instant hit.

In 2006, IDJMG ended their partnership with Roadrunner Records, selling the label to Warner Music. Shakir Stewart was appointed senior vice president of A&amp;R in October. A year later, Steve Bartels was appointed chairman and COO of Island Def Jam, reporting to L.A. Reid and then-CEO of Universal Music, Doug Morris. On December 22, 2007, Jay-Z announced his vacancy from his presidency of Def Jam, invoking L.A. Reid to step in rather than find a replacement. On November 1, 2008, Shakir Stewart committed suicide, vacating his positions as senior vice president of A&amp;R at Island Def Jam and executive vice president of Def Jam. He was posthumously replaced by Christopher Hicks, a former executive from Warner Music Group.

===2010–11: Motown induction and GOOD Music partnership===
Throughout 2010, Island Def Jam generated more public success from Justin Bieber (&quot;Baby&quot;), Kanye West (&quot;My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy&quot;) and Rihanna (&quot;Only Girl (In the World)&quot;).

In 2011, former RCA/Jive Label Group chairman Barry Weiss was assigned to become the new chairman of the Universal Motown Republic Group while at the same time assuming the CEO position at Island Def Jam Music Group. Under Weiss&#x27; leadership, Motown Records became an imprint of the Island Def Jam Music Group shortly after the disbandment of the UMRG. Kanye West&#x27;s imprint, GOOD Music, was given a 10-year distribution partnership with IDJMG. GOOD Music assumed marketing, while Def Jam took over the manufacturing and distribution of its releases. The first official album released under the new partnership was Big Sean&#x27;s debut, &quot;Finally Famous&quot;. In May, Def Soul Records was folded into Island Def Jam as a part of a rearrangement of the Island Def Jam Music Group&#x27;s multi-genre strategy.

In August 2001, a Jay-Z and Kanye West collaborative album, &quot;Watch the Throne&quot;, was released under Island Def Jam&#x27;s distribution. The album sold 436,000 copies in its first week, producing the biggest first-week sales of 2011 hip hop and also the highest for IDJMG since Mariah Carey&#x27;s 2005 album.

===2013: Final output===
In 2013, Fall Out Boy, Iggy Azalea, and Neon Trees solidified more success at the unit. Respectively, Fall Out Boy&#x27;s &quot;Save Rock and Roll&quot; accumulated 154,000 copies, debuting at number one on &quot;Billboard&quot;. For Iggy Azalea, her single, &quot;Change Your Life&quot;, went gold despite debuting at number 47 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Neon Trees&#x27; single, &quot;Sleeping with a Friend&quot;, made the number seven position on the Adult Top 40 chart after receiving positive feedback.

The Island Def Jam Music Group&#x27;s operations in the United Kingdom were also changed that year with Mercury UK being absorbed into the new Virgin EMI Records. With the absorption of Mercury UK also involved the end of Def Jam UK, with all of Island, Def Jam, Republic, Virgin and Motown&#x27;s artists being distributed under the newly reiterated imprint in the region. It occurred following UMG&#x27;s acquisition of the recording music division of EMI a year earlier.

===2014: Disbandment===
On April 1, 2014, Lucian Grainge, chairman and CEO of the Universal Music Group, confirmed the disbandment of the Island Def Jam Music Group. The unit ceased to exist after East Coast label faction CEO Barry Weiss&#x27; departure. Grainge explained: 

It was believed that Weiss was dissatisfied with the fact that he would be demoted at Universal Music with Michele Anthony being promoted to executive vice president at the company&#x27;s recorded music unit and John Janick replacing Jimmy Iovine as chairman and CEO of Island Def Jam&#x27;s sister unit, Interscope Geffen A&amp;M. He was also in talks with Grainge to create a new joint venture with UMG.

With Island Def Jam disbanded, operations had been traced solely into all three label units: Def Jam Recordings will now act as its own label under Universal Music, as so Island Records, which Def Jam remains a sister label to, but with new farther relations. Meanwhile, Motown Records currently operates under the Capitol Music Group. Mercury Records had folded into Island following the closure, but had since been reactivated in 2022 by Universal Music and later moved to Republic Records.

In terms of corporate leadership, Steve Bartels was reassigned to CEO of Def Jam until 2018, David Massey remained president and CEO of Island (also until 2018), and Ethiopia Habtemariam was named president of Motown before leaving in 2022. As of 2022, despite the shutdown, there is a Facebook and Instagram joint account and Universal Music France subunit called Island Def Jam France, taking the unit name and being maintained by UMG France to promote both labels&#x27; music altogether. IDJ France also promotes and produces releases under sister labels Capitol, Motown, Virgin Music and Republic Records. Guenael &quot;G.G.&quot; Fray has been appointed the deputy director of both IDJ and Polydor Records&#x27; French operations since January 2023.

===2024: Republic Corps===
In 2024, Universal Music sister label Republic Records revived the Island Def Jam Music Group as its flagship label, renaming it Republic Corps. It was a strategy imposed by UMG to combine its labels, Republic, Island and Def Jam, under the &quot;East Coast&quot; operation. Republic Corps and Universal&#x27;s New York City label operations are under the supervision of Republic co-founder Monte Lipman.

==Awards and accolades==
According to the 2012 radio airplay analysis of the music industry service Mediabase, IDJMG became the number-one rhythmic label with seven number-one songs played on rhythmic radio stations, including songs from Rihanna, Kanye West, Jay-Z, Ne-Yo, and Justin Bieber.

<text>Illinois Route 19 (abbreviated IL-19, or simply Illinois 19) is a major east–west arterial state highway in northeastern Illinois, United States. It runs from Illinois Route 25 (Liberty St.) in Elgin, to Lake Shore Drive (U.S. Route 41) on the north side of Chicago. Illinois 19 is long. From its western terminus to Schaumburg Road in Elgin, it&#x27;s known as Chicago Road before becoming Irving Park Road until its eastern terminus.

== Route description ==

Illinois 19 fluctuates from being a two lane road in rural parts to six lanes by highway interchanges. In Elgin, the road is mostly four lanes, narrowing to two in relatively undeveloped, forested sections between Illinois Route 59 and Elgin. East of Barrington Road, the road becomes a main artery through the western suburbs of Chicago. The Elgin-O&#x27;Hare Expressway (now known as Illinois Route 390) was built in part to reduce traffic on Illinois 19 through Roselle and Itasca.

The road narrows from six to two lanes between Schaumburg and Roselle, and again (from four lanes to two) in Medinah and through Itasca. The road then becomes four lanes in Wood Dale and maintains this width to its eastern terminus, except for a narrower stretch between N. Cumberland Avenue (Illinois 171) and N. Austin Avenue in Chicago.

East of Bensenville Illinois 19 becomes one of only seven state highways to enter the city of Chicago. It passes along the current southern border of O&#x27;Hare International Airport and serves as the main gateway for western suburbs to access the airport.

At the Tri-State Tollway in Schiller Park, traffic on Illinois 19 may enter the northbound lanes of the tollway. Traffic wishing to enter the southbound lanes must enter at Balmoral (via Mannheim) or Interstate 190 to the north. The Chicago city limits officially start at the Des Plaines River. Illinois 19 runs through the O&#x27;Hare, Dunning, Portage Park, Irving Park, North Center and Lake View neighborhoods before ending at a traffic signal beneath Lake Shore Drive (U.S. Route 41).

The road used to be named Chicago-Elgin Road, but east of Elgin it has been renamed Irving Park Road, for the Irving Park neighborhood of Chicago located between Cicero Avenue and the north branch of the Chicago River in Chicago. In Elgin itself, it has since been renamed East Chicago Street. As of 2005, some signage on approaching streets still identified Irving Park Road as Chicago-Elgin Road.

== History ==
The original Route 19 was designated in 1918 as what is now U.S. Route 14 from Chicago Loop to Harvard. In 1935, the routing was removed, and in 1949 it was reapplied on part of its modern-day routing. As of 1968, IL 72 was cut back from Lake Shore Drive (US 41) to its present terminus. As a result, the IL 19 designation was extended from its terminus at Narragansett Avenue (formerly assigned as part of IL 72) by to Lake Shore Drive in Chicago.

===O&#x27;Hare realignment===
Irving Park Road once ran straight through where O&#x27;Hare International Airport&#x27;s 04R/22L Runway now sits. The road was realigned to the south in the 1960s in order to build the runway. Again in 2012, the road was realigned to the south as part of the O&#x27;Hare Modernization Plan to build runway 10R/28L.

=== Wood Dale proposed underpass ===
On November 16, 2006, aldermen in Wood Dale approved a plan to redesign the intersection of Irving Park Road and Wood Dale Road. The intersection is currently fully interconnected to railroad signals for the active Metra Milwaukee District/West Line tracks, creating a situation where vehicles on both roads may be at risk of being hit by oncoming commuter trains. In addition, freight trains emerge from the Canadian Pacific Railway&#x27;s Bensenville freight railroad yard during off peak rush hours. After the $45 million reconstruction, Irving Park Road would have crossed underneath the railroad tracks further northwest from the current intersection. Two alternatives were advanced in a city council meeting: Alternate 2, which would move Irving Park Road slightly north, displace 18 businesses but have flood-plain and line-of-sight issues, and Alternate 2A, which would displace 47 homes and 13 businesses.

The plan was killed in early March 2007 after local opposition to a Division Street extension through property owned by Holy Ghost Church. The city has since decided to investigate alternative safety measures at the intersection, including the addition of turn lanes and red-light cameras.

==Transportation==
The CTA services the 80 Irving Park between Inner Drive and Cumberland Avenue. The 9 Ashland, X9 Ashland Express and 54A North Cicero/Skokie Blvd serve the road for short segments.

The following &quot;L&quot; and Metra lines service Irving Park Road:
*Red Line at Sheridan Road
*Brown Line at Ravenswood Avenue
*Blue Line at Kennedy Expressway
*Union Pacific Northwest Line at Irving Park
*Milwaukee District North Line at Grayland
*Milwaukee District West Line at Wood Dale, Itasca, Medinah, and Roselle

<text>Brian Michael Higgins (born October 6, 1959) is an American former politician who was the U.S. representative for , from 2005 until 2024. The district, numbered as the 27th district from 2005 to 2013 and as the 26th from 2013 to 2024, included Buffalo and Niagara Falls, along with some surrounding urban and suburban areas. Higgins is a member of the Democratic Party, and of several congressional committees and caucuses. He was born and raised Buffalo, New York, before obtaining a bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s from Buffalo State College and an MPA from Harvard University.

==Early life, education, and career==
Brian Higgins was born on October 6, 1959, in Buffalo, New York. A native of South Buffalo, Higgins served on the Buffalo Common Council (city council) from 1988 to 1993, representing the South District. Higgins&#x27;s grandparents were from Ireland.

In 1993, during his final year on the Council, Higgins was rated &quot;Buffalo&#x27;s Best Lawmaker&quot; in a 1993 &quot;Buffalo News&quot; Survey of Western New York business and community leaders. Responding to the survey were 158 business, community, and government leaders in Western New York. Higgins earned the highest rating of any political leader, with a 3.81 out of a possible score of 5. The &quot;Buffalo News&quot; wrote of Higgins: &quot;During his 5 1/2 years on the Council, he has earned a reputation as a thoughtful, soft-spoken lawmaker who has paid attention to both district and citywide concerns.&quot; One community leader said, &quot;Brian is a very bright, responsible public official&quot;, while a government leader said of Higgins, &quot;The best Councilman in Buffalo. Has great vision.&quot;

Higgins graduated from Buffalo State College with a BA in political science in 1984 and an MA in history in 1985. He received an MPA from Harvard University&#x27;s John F. Kennedy School of Government in 1996. Higgins has taught courses on state and local government, and the economic history of Buffalo and Western New York, in Buffalo State College&#x27;s history and economics departments. He served as the 145th district representative to the New York State Assembly from 1999 to 2004.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
Jack Quinn, a moderate Republican who had represented the heavily Democratic 27th since 1993, unexpectedly announced his retirement in 2004. In April 2004, Higgins entered the race, and narrowly defeated then-Erie County Comptroller Nancy Naples. After the 2000 redistricting, the district was made slightly friendlier for Quinn (in part, by adding mostly rural Chautauqua County), but was still at the time the most Democratic district in the country represented by a Republican. Since Higgins&#x27;s initial election, the district has since reverted to form, and Higgins was reelected without serious difficulty, never receiving less than 60% of the vote. He easily dispatched his 2008 and 2010 opponents even after they posted six-figure fundraising numbers. In 2006 and 2008, Higgins garnered more than 70% of the vote.

For his first four terms, Higgins represented the southern two-thirds of Buffalo, as well as Chautauqua County. After the 2010 census, his district was renumbered as the 26th, and a special master redrew it to be much more compact and Democratic. He picked up the rest of Buffalo, as well as several inner-ring suburbs that used to be in the territory of Louise Slaughter, while losing Chautauqua County to its traditional Southern Tier district. He also picked up a large portion of Niagara County, including all of North Tonawanda and 99% of Niagara Falls.

Higgins has received financial contributions for his campaigns from many business executives in Western New York throughout his tenure in Congress. In 2012, his reelection committee raised more than $1,000,000, with approximately 2/3 coming from individual donors, representing major businesses in Western New York.

===Tenure===
Higgins has positioned himself as a centrist, although his voting record in the House has placed him close to the center of his party. In 1998, he ran for the Assembly on the Democratic and Conservative party lines, and in 2000 and 2004 he ran with both parties&#x27; endorsements, as well as that of the Working Families Party.

Higgins describes himself as a pro-union moderate who wants to spur job growth. He has said he supports allowing seniors to buy prescription drugs from Canada, and one of his priorities in Congress is legislation allowing the government to negotiate for volume discounts on drugs. He has also said he wants Congress to repeal President George W. Bush&#x27;s tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals.

Higgins procured $279 million over 50 years for Erie County&#x27;s various governments and agencies from the New York Power Authority as part of the Niagara Power Project 50-year relicensing agreement. He is an advocate for economic development and job creation, and played a pivotal role through his membership on the House&#x27;s Transportation and Infrastructure Committee in securing approval for the construction of a new federal courthouse in downtown Buffalo.

Higgins strongly advocates for increased federal funding for cancer research, as Buffalo is home to Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, the nation&#x27;s first major medical facility devoted exclusively to treating cancer, with cancer research as its main mission.

In 2006, Higgins and Representatives James T. Walsh and Tim Murphy met with several government leaders in Ireland and announced confirmation of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) weapons decommissioning. Government leaders with whom the three met included Irish Foreign Minister Dermot Ahern, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Peter Hain, US Ambassador to Ireland James C. Kenny, US Ambassador to the United Kingdom Robert H. Tuttle, and the leadership of each of the main political parties involved in the process for peace.

Higgins has also supported efforts for peace in South Asia and Africa, and the Middle East, including Iraq, Afghanistan, and Darfur.

Higgins received an &quot;A+&quot; on the 2007 Congressional Scorecard on middle-class issues from the Drum Major Institute, which describes itself as &quot;providing the ideas that fuel the progressive movement.&quot;

Several media outlets named Higgins as one of the leading candidates to succeed Hillary Clinton in the United States Senate after she became Secretary of State in an Obama administration. He was one of six candidates on New York Governor David Paterson&#x27;s &quot;short list&quot; for the position; a WKBW-TV poll showed 75% of respondents on the station&#x27;s website would support Higgins&#x27;s nomination. In the end, Paterson appointed Representative Kirsten Gillibrand. On January 31, 2009, Higgins led a delegation of Western New York elected leaders in welcoming Gillibrand to the region, moderating an economic roundtable discussion held at the Bioinformatics Center of Excellence, on the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus.

In December 2008, after only two terms in the House, Higgins secured a spot on the United States House Committee on Ways and Means, considered one of the most important and powerful committees in Congress due to its wide jurisdiction. Higgins was subsequently appointed to serve on the Ways and Means Committee&#x27;s subcommittee on Select Revenue Measures and its subcommittee on Oversight. After the GOP takeover of the House following the 2010 elections, Higgins left the Ways and Means Committee and became a member of the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs and the United States House Committee on Homeland Security. On the latter, Higgins quickly rose to the position of Ranking Member of the United States House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence.

On February 2, 2024, Higgins resigned from Congress, having announced the plan three months prior on November 12. He cited his impatience with &quot;growing dysfunction&quot; in Congress as the reason.

==Political positions==
Higgins voted with President Joe Biden&#x27;s stated position 100% of the time in the 117th Congress, according to a &quot;FiveThirtyEight&quot; analysis.

Self-described as an independent, Higgins is considered to be in the center of his party. He supports the strengthening of Social Security, and has been a proponent for a public option of health insurance. He further supports national and regional economic development. Higgins supports abortion rights. He has also supported efforts for peace in many areas of the world, and has been actively involved in the Northern Ireland peace process.

===Social Security===
On a previous policy position from his website, Higgins said: &quot;For too long, the Social Security Administration has under-funded and under-staffed hearing offices in Western New York ... Citizens who have contributed to the Social Security system throughout their lives should have proper customer service when their benefits come due.&quot;

In 2010, Higgins and many other congressional members sent President Barack Obama a letter, encouraging him to keep Social Security and make it stronger, saying: &quot;We write today to express our strong support for Social Security and our view that it should be strengthened. We oppose any cuts to Social Security benefits, including raising the retirement age. We also oppose any effort to privatize Social Security, in whole or in part ... Cutting Social Security benefits beyond the already scheduled increase in the retirement age from 65 to 67 would create even more needless hardship for millions of vulnerable Americans.&quot; This was in response to Obama giving the task of cutting government spending to the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform on October 15, 2010. The letter also stressed that Social Security is &quot;prohibited by law from adding to the national budget deficit&quot;.

Higgins opposes privatizing Social Security. He &quot;support[s] full funding for the Social Security Administration to process checks on time; fight against waste, fraud, and abuse; and combat unacceptable claims backlogs&quot;. His district includes nearly 150,000 senior citizens. Higgins introduced related legislation, House Resolution (HR) 3997, in February 2014. The bill aims requires the Social Security Commissioner to submit an estimated annual budget, and to submit the estimated budget to Congress before submitting it to the President; prohibits the closing or limitation of field offices and hearing offices without justification; and mandates particular procedures related to closings, consolidations, and/or public limitations.

===Abortion===
In the New York State Assembly from 1999 to 2002, Higgins supported certain anti-abortion measures, but since 2003, he has identified himself as pro-choice. In 2006, Higgins was given a rating of 9% by the NRLC, which indicates a pro-choice stance. Higgins received a score of 100% (a perfect score) from Planned Parenthood in 2012, and from NARAL Pro-Choice America in 2011.

===Health care===
Higgins voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as &quot;ObamaCare&quot;. In June 2012, Higgins said he believed that health care providers will have to embrace &quot;Accountable Care Organizations, comparative effectiveness research — which studies various treatments to determine what works best — and other changes&quot;. He believed that this should have been done decades ago.

On his congressional website, Higgins has stated that &quot;there is no question that [the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act] was needed&quot;. He added that it is a beginning of health care reform in the United States.

Higgins strongly believes in a national health care program, with a &quot;public option&quot;, whereby the government provides health insurance that would compete with other businesses&#x27; plans. A letter Higgins signed from a group of representatives to Senator Harry Reid, then the Senate Majority Leader, stated: &quot;As the Senate continues to work on health reform legislation, we strongly urge you to consider including a public option.&quot; The American Public Health Association gave Higgins a perfect rating of 100% in 2009.

===Stimulus spending===
It was reported that Higgins was &quot;proposing something unprecedented in this era of $1.3 trillion annual deficits: a $1.25 trillion, five-year plan to rebuild the nation&#x27;s roads, bridges, railroads, ports, and airports&quot;. Higgins&#x27;s website gives the cost of these endeavors as $1.2 trillion. The bill, the Nation Building Here at Home Act, based on research by the New America Foundation, would cost significantly more than Obama&#x27;s $787 billion stimulus package. Higgins said that he wants to rebuild the US, &quot;as we&#x27;ve rebuilt other countries — Iraq and Afghanistan — in recent years&quot;. He also said that it is not a stimulus bill, but a &quot;nation-building bill&quot;.

===Education===
Higgins is a supporter of education, including early education through higher education. He has said, &quot;Every child has a right to a quality education.&quot; Ensuring that young people have a quality early education, and that legislators are supportive of education for individuals in primary, elementary, secondary, and higher educational institutions, are among Higgins&#x27;s aims. He is a proponent of congressional support for measures that increase student achievement, but that also reward success, rather than punish failure, as the No Child Left Behind Act has done. Higgins further believes that financial barriers to education should not hinder anyone from pursuing higher education.

===Student loan interest rates===
Higgins supports maintaining lower interest rates on loans incurred by college and university students. He co-sponsored two bills — H.R. 3826, and H.R. 4816 — in efforts to extend the period of time in maintaining the reduced 3.4% interest rate on student loans. In 2007, Higgins supported The College Cost Reduction and Access Act, a bill passed into law that included the reduced 3.4% interest rate on subsidized Stafford student loans through the end of the 2012 academic year.

===Syria===
In 2023, Higgins was among 56 Democrats to vote in favor of H.Con.Res. 21, which directed President Joe Biden to remove U.S. troops from Syria within 180 days.

==Personal life==
Higgins resides in South Buffalo, New York. He has two adult children, John and Maeve.

<doc id="1184408" wikidata="Q463627" url="?curid=1184408" title="Ferrari F40">
<text>The Ferrari F40 (Type F120) is a mid-engine, rear-wheel drive sports car engineered by Nicola Materazzi with styling by Pininfarina. It was built from 1987 until 1992, with the LM and GTE race car versions continuing production until 1994 and 1996 respectively. As the successor to the 288 GTO (also engineered by Materazzi), it was designed to celebrate Ferrari&#x27;s 40th anniversary and was the last Ferrari automobile personally approved by Enzo Ferrari. At the time it was Ferrari&#x27;s fastest, most powerful, and most expensive car for sale.

The car debuted with a planned production total of four hundred units and a factory suggested retail price of approximately US$400,000 (fivefold the price of its predecessor, the 288 GTO) in 1987 ($ today). One of those that belonged to the Formula One driver Nigel Mansell was sold for the then record of £1 million in 1990, a record that stood into the 2010s. A total of 1,311 to 1,315 cars were manufactured with 213 units destined for the United States.

As early as 1984, Materazzi had proposed to Enzo Ferrari the idea of using the Group B 4-litre category (2.8-litre if turbocharged) to prove the performance of new road cars which with increased power could no longer safely display their performance on the road in the hands of regular buyers. Since Enzo Ferrari no longer had control over the production part of the business, Materazzi had to obtain permission from General Manager Eugenio Alzati. Permission was granted but only at the condition that work would take place outside of the Monday to Friday work week. A very small team thus developed the GTO Evoluzione on Saturdays to compete in the same class entered by the Porsche 959 in FIA Group B.

The FIA&#x27;s move to end the Group B category for the 1986 season saw Enzo Ferrari left with five 288 GTO Evoluzione development cars, and no series to enter them into. These were left for enthusiasts who might consider purchasing one until a validation driver convinced Enzo Ferrari that Materazzi could keep the base car concept alive and make it roadworthy. Enzo&#x27;s desire to leave a legacy in his final sports car allowed the Evoluzione program to be further developed to produce a car exclusively for road use. In particular, Ferrari had been impressed with the development of recent cars which claimed back much of the performance deficit inflicted by ever more restrictive emissions regulations.

In response to the quite simple, but very expensive car with relatively little out of the ordinary being called a &quot;cynical money-making exercise&quot; aimed at speculators, a figure from the Ferrari marketing department was quoted as saying &quot;We wanted it to be very fast, sporting in the extreme and Spartan,&quot; &quot;Customers had been saying our cars were becoming too plush and comfortable.&quot; &quot;The F40 is for the most enthusiastic of our owners who want nothing but sheer performance. It isn&#x27;t a laboratory for the future, as the 959 is. It is not Star Wars. And it wasn&#x27;t created because Porsche built the 959. It would have happened anyway.&quot; In fact the reasons for the car&#x27;s rawness and simplicity are very much linked to Materazzi&#x27;s racing background (starting from the Stratos Gr.4, the Gr.5 Silhouette, then the Osella F2 and F1 cars, the 126C and eventually the 288 GTO).

The body of the F40 was designed by Pietro Camardella under the supervision of Aldo Brovarone of the Pininfarina design house. Nicola Materazzi meanwhile worked on evolutions of the engine, gearbox and other mechanical parts of the car to make them roadworthy. Many of these were well validated in the 288 GTO Evoluzione, from which the F40 takes many styling cues. From the beginning of the project on 10 June 1986, Enzo Ferrari asked for the car to be completed in a very short space of time (eleven months) and be presented in the summer of 1987. For this reason, he gave Materazzi permission to choose all the engineers on the team. Some of the development of the car, such as the bodywork was carried out at external companies like .

=== Power, torque, and suspension ===
Power came from an enlarged, high-revving version of the 288 GTO&#x27;s IHI four-stroke 90 degrees twin turbocharged and intercooled V8 engine generating a peak power output of at 7,000 rpm and of torque at 4,000 rpm as stated by the manufacturer. Gearing, torque curves, and actual power output differed among the cars. The F40 did without a catalytic converter until 1990, when US regulations made them a requirement for emissions control reasons. The flanking exhaust pipes guide exhaust gases from each bank of cylinders while the central pipe guides gases released from the wastegate of the turbochargers. The F40&#x27;s twin-turbocharged V8 would be Ferrari&#x27;s final forced induction engine until the California T in 2014.

The suspension setup was similar to the GTO&#x27;s double wishbone setup, though many parts were upgraded and settings were changed; the unusually low ground clearance prompted Ferrari to include the ability to raise the vehicle&#x27;s ground clearance when necessary for later cars via hydraulic lift chambers in the front dampers.

=== Body and interior ===
The body was an entirely new design by Pininfarina featuring panels made of Kevlar, carbon fibre, and aluminium for strength and low weight, and intense aerodynamic testing employed. Weight was further minimised through the use of a polycarbonate plastic windshield and windows. The cars did have moderate air conditioning but had no sound system, door handles, glove box, leather trim, carpets, or door panels. The first fifty cars produced had sliding Lexan windows, while later cars were fitted with wind-down windows.

All cars left the factory in &quot;Rosso Corsa&quot; colour and left-hand drive. At least seven cars were modified and delivered to the Sultan of Brunei in right-hand drive. The Sultan employed Pininfarina&#x27;s prototype manager Paolo Garella to make modifications to the car&#x27;s colour, power, and interior comforts.

=== Aerodynamics ===
Cooling was important as forced induction engines generate significant amounts of heat. In order to dissipate the heat, the car was designed similarly to an open-wheel racing car with a body. It had a partial undertray to smooth airflow beneath the radiator, front section, and the cabin, and a second one with diffusers behind the engine, but the engine bay was not sealed. It has a .
=== Tyres ===
Because the car had an additional compared to the 288 GTO, a new tyre had to be developed to cope with the power levels which were more typically associated with racing cars. Materazzi contacted the Pirelli head of development Mario Mezzanotte, who he had known since the rallying years with the Lancia cars. Pirelli made a carcass with light materials (including Kevlar) after the experience gained in the Formula 1 seasons from 1980 to 1985 and asymmetrical tread patterns to create the P-Zero specifically for the F40.

=== Launch and promotion ===
The F40 was revealed on 21 July 1987 at the Civic Centre in Maranello. Originally the presentation was due to happen at the Frankfurt Motor Show according to Materazzi but Fiat needed to present the Alfa Romeo 164 at that show and the two would have clashed. Hence on insistence of Enzo Ferrari the launch was anticipated by more than two months. Counting from the project inception (June 1986) until the launch, the car was developed in thirteen months.

The promotion of the car was captured by the cameras in a documentary that included footage of Enzo Ferrari&#x27;s past interviews, work inside the factory and the F40 driving through the streets of Modena. F1 driver Michele Alboreto drove the car on several occasions including a Christmas 1987 special programme for the Italian TV and journalist Ezio Zermiani when the car was filmed driving from Maranello to Milan.

== Racing ==
===LM===
The racing cars were prepared by Michelotto (based in Padua) the Ferrari specialist who had already carried out work on the GTO Evoluzione and on parts of the road-going version of the F40.

Three chassis were prepared and two were used in races, with serial numbers 79890 and 79891. The third chassis, with serial number 88521, was intended to be raced and was a spare car that stayed at Michelotto but was never raced.

The car saw competition on October 15th 1989 when it debuted in the Laguna Seca Raceway round of the IMSA, appearing in the GTO category, with an LM evolution model entered by Ferrari France, led by Jean Sage, driven by newly-crowned International F3000 champion and F1 newcomer Jean Alesi, finishing third to the two faster spaceframe four wheel drive Audi 90s and beating a host of other factory-backed spaceframe specials that dominated the races. In the following race (Del Mar 22nd October 1989) Jean-Pierre Jabouille replaced Jean Alesi who raced in the F1 Japanese GP and had to retire after eighteen laps.
In 1990 Ferrari France took part in 6 of the 14 races of the IMSA GTO/GTU championship. Driven by a host of guest drivers such as Jean-Louis Schlesser, Jean-Pierre Jabouille, Jacques Laffite and Hurley Haywood, three second-places and one third-place were the best results.

Although the F40 would not return to IMSA in 1991, it would later be a popular choice by privateers to compete in numerous domestic GT series including JGTC.

In 1994, the car made its debut in international competitions, with one car campaigned in the BPR Global GT Series by Strandell, winning at the 4 Hours of Vallelunga.

In 1995, the number of F40s climbed to four, developed independently by Pilot-Aldix Racing (F40 LM) and Strandell (F40 GTE, racing under the Ferrari Club Italia banner), winning the 4 Hours of Anderstorp. No longer competitive against the newly entered McLaren F1 GTR, the Ferrari F40 returned for another year in 1996, managing to repeat the previous year&#x27;s Anderstorp win, and from then on it was no longer seen in GT racing.

In total nineteen cars were produced.

=== Competizione ===
The F40 &quot;Competizione&quot; is a non-sponsored, more powerful version of the F40 LM, which was the result of consumer requests following the order of a French importer who wanted to enter one in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Ten examples were built, all at customer request, the first two being called F40 LM&#x27;s, and the remaining eight being F40 &quot;Competizione&quot;, as Ferrari felt that the LM tag was too restrictive.

The F40 Competizione is rated at at 8,100 rpm from its upgraded twin-turbocharged V8 engine. The car can reportedly achieve a top speed of about .

Chassis number 80782 was originally purchased as a road car and imported into the Netherlands in 1989 by the official Ferrari importer, Kroymans BV. Work was then done by Peter van Erp of Cavallino Tuning, Kroymans&#x27; racing division to convert it into &quot;Competizione&quot; specification, with new shock absorbers, new instrumentation, brakes, bodywork, and a new paint job. The car was consistently promoted through the Ferrari Challenge, and modifications in 1995 were made to maintain the car&#x27;s competitiveness. Modifications were made by British tuning house G-Tex in collaboration with Michelotto and included air jacks, an upgraded roll hoop, and upgrades to the engine which increased its power output to over . After the car was sold to its most recent owner, it had a decorative makeover which consisted of a repaint in grey and blue fabric seats.

== Performance ==
The first independent measurements yielded in 4.7 seconds and a top speed of onto the French &quot;Sport Auto&quot; September 1988 cover.

The next opportunity to reach the claimed top speed was a shootout at Nardò Ring organized by &quot;Auto, Motor und Sport&quot;. Ferrari sent two cars but neither could reach more than , beaten by the Porsche 959 S, which attained a top speed of , and the Ruf CTR, which attained a top speed of . Both were limited production cars with only twenty-nine built, so while the F40 never was the world&#x27;s fastest sports car as self-appraised by Ferrari, it could still claim the title of the fastest production car with over five hundred units built until the arrival of the Lamborghini Diablo (depending on how the term &quot;production car&quot; is defined). &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; measured a top speed of for both the European and US spec cars while &quot;Car and Driver&quot; measured a top speed of .

== Reception ==

When the F40 was unveiled in 1987 it received mixed reactions. Dennis Simanaitis praised its looks in &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot;, but others were unimpressed. Observers considered it a cynical attempt to cash in on speculators’ money after seeing how much was paid for used 288 GTOs and for the Porsche 959. Speculators were expecting Enzo Ferrari&#x27;s death and to benefit from raising prices. It was estimated in 1990 that only 10% of the delivered F40s were used for driving.

Speculators sold the cars with ever-rising prices, up to over seven times the list price in 1989 (before the bubble burst) which made it even more desirable. 

&quot;Autocar&quot; tested an F40 in 1988 at the Fiorano test circuit. The writer, Mel Nichols, stated: &quot;I do not yet know whether the F40 is untractable in traffic, fearsome in the wet, uncomfortably harsh on bumpy roads or too noisy on long journeys. It has no luggage space and getting in and out is awkward. But I do know this: on a smooth road it is a scintillatingly fast car that is docile and charming in its nature; a car that is demanding but not difficult to drive, blessed as it is with massive grip and, even more importantly, superb balance and manners. You can use its performance, the closest any production car maker has yet come to race car levels, and revel in it.&quot;

In 1988, Ferrari invited journalists to test the F40 at their home track Fiorano Circuit and bring a Porsche 959 along for comparison.
The &quot;Automobile Magazine&quot; and &quot;Car&quot; magazines made an overall verdict, for both of them, the Porsche 959 was the better car.

Gordon Murray analyzed the car in &quot;Motor Trend&quot;&#x27;s July 1990 issue: &quot;It&#x27;s the lack of weight that makes the Ferrari so exciting. There&#x27;s nothing else magic about the car at all...They&#x27;re asking two- and three-inch-diameter steel tubes at chassis base datum level to do all the work, and it shows – you can feel the chassis flexing on the circuit and it wobbles all over the place on the road. It really does shake about. And, of course, once you excite the chassis the door panels start rattling and squeaking. Whereas the other cars feel taut and solid, this one&#x27;s like a big go-kart with a plastic body on it.&quot; He severely criticized the old racing technology: &quot;It&#x27;s not even &#x27;60s technology, from a frame point of view, it&#x27;s &#x27;50s twin-tube technology, not even a spaceframe. It&#x27;s only got local frames to hold the bulkhead to the dash, attach the front suspension, rear suspension and roll bar. And then you have the marketing Kevlar glues in with a quarter-inch of rubber.&quot;

&quot;Car and Driver&quot; called the car a &quot;mix of sheer terror and raw excitement&quot;. The most fun was accelerating in first gear from , &quot;pure terror&quot; was driving on a busy highway. The rear vision was so bad that lane changes required &quot;leaps of faith&quot;.
It was found unfit for daily road use, &quot;clunky and cantankerous&quot; around town, &quot;so mechanically delinquent that an onboard mechanic is advised&quot;; to describe driver discomfort &quot;Bangkok debtors&#x27; prison&quot; was used. In a comparison test the Lamborghini Diablo was found better looking by the civilians while the testers opted for the F40. When &quot;Car and Driver&quot; declared the Porsche 911 Turbo the quickest A-to-B four-wheeled transport on American highways, the &quot;nervous&quot; Ferrari F40 wasn&#x27;t found competitive because of being a 30-minute car. &quot;After that, you&#x27;d like a cool drink and a brief nap.&quot;

== Legacy ==
Despite the mixed reviews on the car due to its spartan design and lack of the latest technology (when compared to the Porsche 959 and other supercars), the F40 remains a car that is liked by many individuals in the press and owners. &quot;Evo&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2013 &quot;Ferrari F40 buying guide&quot; started with &quot;For many it&#x27;s the greatest road-going Ferrari of all&quot;. An expert explained its popularity among the Ferrari cognoscenti: &quot;They will never be allowed to make another F40 in today&#x27;s world of red tape and health and safety. That is what makes it so special and so desirable.&quot;

Richard Hammond compared the F40 to the Porsche 959 stating the F40 to be &quot;as visceral and edgy an experience as the 959 is refined and sophisticated.&quot;

The value and the appeal of supercars are very subjective. Autocar named it the ultimate car to drive. Pistonheads stated that &quot;There have been prettier, quicker, rarer Ferraris than the one built in its 40th year. But none as special&quot;. Motor Sport Magazine re-appraised it for the 21st century noting that its engine power delivery is docile at modest speeds and is unleashed when demanded by the driver. Classic And Sportscar concluded after a test with XJ220, EB110 and F40: &quot;It&#x27;s far from perfect. Actually, perfect isn&#x27;t even on its radar but it&#x27;s brutal, ballistic and a bit scary. Magic. No it really is that good.&quot; Autoexpress also noted that when the cars have the correct servicing of mechanical components and of the rubberised fuel tanks they are to this day robust and reliable thanks to their simplicity.

Ferrari chief test-driver Dario Benuzzi feels that despite the 1970s and 80s technology, the car is very relevant and interesting to passionate drivers: “It was a lightweight car with a lot of power and that&#x27;s what makes it fun to drive. Of course, the handling was also very good. So, all in all, a very good package! I think that, if we&#x27;d been able to adopt a steering and brake servo, the F40 would still be a force to be reckoned with among supercars today.”

<text>The Berbice River , located in eastern Guyana, is one of the country&#x27;s major rivers. It rises in the highlands of the Rupununi region and flows northward for through dense forests to the coastal plain. The river&#x27;s tidal limit is between from the sea.

== Geography ==
Obstructed by shallows at its estuary, the Berbice River&#x27;s mouth is the location of Crab Island, opposite the mouth of the Canje River, the Berbice&#x27;s main tributary.

Quantity of water based on the streamflow of the gauging station at Itabu Falls (04&#x27;52&#x27;N0&#x27;50&#x27;13&#x27;W) is .

== History ==
The Dutch established a foothold on the Berbice River as early as 1629 for trading with the Amerindians. Plantations formed along the river, and it later became the location of a major slave uprising. In 1627, the settlement of Nassau (the name was used for many of the Dutch forts in the seventeenth century) was founded by the Dutch West India Company. The area was passed over to the British in 1815 and merged with the neighboring British Guiana.

The town of New Amsterdam is situated on the river&#x27;s east bank, approximately four miles inside the river&#x27;s estuary, where it enters the Atlantic Ocean. A new bridge over the river joins New Amsterdam to Rosignol. Other communities on the Berbice River include Everton, Mara, Takama, Kalkuni and Kwakwani.

The river has served to transport Bauxite from the major mine at Kwakwani (currently owned by Rusal).

A ferry service transferred goods and people between Kwakwani and New Amsterdam, but was discontinued in the 1990s.

Torani Canal was built to allow water to flow from the Berbice River into the Canje River for maintaining water levels for irrigation purposes.

On December 23, 2008, construction of the Berbice Bridge linking D’Edward Village, Crab Island, and the Courantyne Highway was completed.

<text>Koogle was a flavored peanut spread marketed by Kraft, introduced in 1971. It was available in several flavors, including chocolate, cinnamon, vanilla and banana.

==Ingredients==
The ingredient list for Koogle changed over its lifetime. Examples of ingredient lists include:

:*Chocolate: &quot;U.S. grade no. 1 peanuts, partially hardened vegetable oils, sugar, cocoa processed with alkali, dextrose, salt, nonfat dry milk, artificial flavor&quot;
:*Chocolate: &quot;Peanuts, partially hardened vegetable oils, sugar, milk chocolate (with artificial flavor and emulsifier added), chocolate liquor, dextrose, salt, artificial flavor&quot; 
:* Cinnamon: &quot;U.S. grade no. 1 peanuts, partially hardened vegetable oils, sugar, cinnamon, dextrose, salt&quot;

==Marketing==
Many of Koogle&#x27;s TV commercials featured the product&#x27;s mascot, an oversized puppet costume in the abstract form of a giant jar with spinning eyeballs, frog-like arms and legs, and a &quot;jive&quot; voice similar to that of then-popular radio disc jockey Wolfman Jack. In the premiere commercial the mascot danced to a jingle, &quot;Pea-nutty-koogle with the koo-koo-koogly eyes,&quot; which was modeled on Billy Rose&#x27;s 1923 hit song &quot;Barney Google (with the Goo-Goo-Googly Eyes)&quot;. Subsequent commercials had the mascot explaining the product to children in &quot;jive&quot; talk, or mothers endorsing the product to make it more appealing to mothers so they would be more willing to buy it for their children.

<text>Sion Hart Rogers (September 30, 1825 – August 14, 1874) was a U.S. Congressman and Attorney General of North Carolina.

==Biography==
Born near Raleigh, North Carolina in 1825, Rogers attended common schools in Wake County and attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, graduating in 1846. After studying law, he was admitted to the bar in 1848 and commenced practice in Raleigh. As a Whig, he was elected to the 33rd United States Congress in 1852 and served one two-year term (March 4, 1853 - March 3, 1855), declining a renomination in 1854.

Rogers served solicitor of the Raleigh district of the superior court. During the American Civil War, he served in the Confederate States Army as a lieutenant in the Fourteenth Regiment of North Carolina State Troops in 1861; was commissioned colonel of the Forty-seventh North Carolina Infantry April 8, 1862, and resigned January 5, 1863, upon being elected attorney general of the State of North Carolina.

Rogers served as North Carolina Attorney General until 1866. In 1868, he stood for election to Congress once more, but was unsuccessful. He claimed election as a Democrat in 1870 to the 42nd United States Congress, (March 4, 1871 - March 3, 1873). His election was contested, however, by his Republican opponent, and Rogers was disqualified to serve under section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment. After the election contest was dropped and Congress voted to remove his disabilities, Rogers was sworn in on May 23, 1872. Rogers served a single-term and failed to gain re-election in 1872 and died in Raleigh on August 14, 1874; he is buried in the City Cemetery in Raleigh.

He built the Rogers-Bagley-Daniels-Pegues House about 1855, and it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.

<doc id="1184424" wikidata="Q185929" url="?curid=1184424" title="Indanthrone blue">
<text>Indanthrone blue, also called indanthrene, is an organic compound with the formula . It is a dark blue solid that is a common dye as well as a precursor to other dyes.

==Preparation==
The compound is made from 2-aminoanthraquinone treated with potassium hydroxide.
:.
By dimerization of 2-aminoanthraquinone (1) under strongly alkaline conditions at 220-235 °C, the intermediate 3 is obtained in two steps, which cyclizes intramolecularly and is oxidized to indanthrone 5.

==Applications==
It is a pigment that can be used in the following media: acrylic, alkyd, casein, encaustic, fresco, gouache, linseed oil, tempera, pastel, and watercolor painting. It is used to dye unmordanted cotton and as a pigment in quality paints and enamels. As a food dye, it has E number E130, but it is not approved for use in either the United States or the European Union. It has excellent light fastness, but may bleed in some organic solvents.

=== Organic Semiconductor ===
As an organic semiconductor, indanthrone has capabilities for utilization as a photocatalyst for oxygen generation from water utilizing solar energy. Indanthrone&#x27;s characteristic as a nonlinear optics light absorber, allows for its use as an &quot;optical limiter&quot;, which can be employed, for instance, in laser protective filters.

=== Colorant ===
Indanthrone is utilized as a blue pigment (C.I. Pigment Blue 60), primarily in the process of vat dyeing, often referred to as C.I. Vat Blue 4. Indanthrone is a vat dye, synthesized to provide highest color fastness for the dyeing and printing of predominantly cellulose-based textile fibers. Fabrics dyed with indanthrene fulfill the highest standards and exhibit exceptional wash fastness, boil fastness, light fastness, weather fastness and chlorine fastness.

=== Trademark ===
Indanthrone blue was the first example of the brand &quot;Indanthren&quot; (an acronym for &quot;Indigo from anthracene&quot;) introduced by BASF in 1901. One result is that even now, in Japan vat dyes are commonly described as &quot;thren(e)&quot; dyes (スレン染料), derived from the Japanese transliteration of the brand.

<text>Gheorghe Funar (; born September 29, 1949, in Sânnicolau Mare, Timiș County, Socialist Republic of Romania) is a nationalist Romanian politician, who rose to fame as a controversial mayor of Cluj-Napoca between 1992 and 2004.

==Biography==
He became well known for his very strong nationalist stance favouring ethnic Romanians in Cluj-Napoca, which is a relatively multi-ethnic city with an increasing ethnic Romanian majority (80.8%) and a significant ethnic Hungarian population (17.1%). Other ethnic groups include Romani and Germans (more specifically Transylvanian Saxons). Cluj-Napoca is considered to be the major city of Transylvania, a historical region with a significant Hungarian minority.

Funar was a candidate for the presidency for the Romanian National Unity Party (PUNR) in 1992 and 1996. In 1997, after he was expelled from PUNR, he joined the far-right Greater Romania Party (PRM).

Funar served as mayor of Cluj-Napoca from 1992 to 2004, when he was defeated in the first round of the mayoral election. Emil Boc of the Justice and Truth Alliance (DA) won in the second round run-off against Social Democratic Party (PSD) candidate Ioan Rus. Funar ran again in 2008, coming in fourth with 4.2% of the vote.

Previously, Funar was also the General Secretary of the Greater Romania Party (PRM). Among his proposals in parliament are the distribution of Romanian-language Bibles to all citizens and the raising of a statue of Mihai Eminescu in every commune.

He is married to Sabina Funar, a professor at the University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine in Cluj-Napoca.

== Mayorship of Cluj-Napoca ==
While many voters said that they voted for him only due to his economic policies, Funar&#x27;s views demonstrated that tensions over Transylvania&#x27;s ethnic identity continued after the end of Communism in Romania in 1989 and more than seventy years after Transylvania became part of Romania. His views were often manifested in public policy. Among his measures seen by many as an affront to the ethnic Hungarian community, Funar asked the municipality to paint many public items—including park benches, pavements and even garbage bins—in the colors of the Romanian flag (blue, yellow and red). At Christmas time, the municipality was allowed to use only red, yellow and blue Christmas lights.

In 1993, the city&#x27;s central plaza, &quot;Piața Libertății&quot; (Liberty Square), was renamed &quot;Piața Unirii&quot; (Unification Square), to call to mind the 1918 Union of Transylvania with Romania. Funar changed the label of the statue of Matthias Corvinus from &quot;Matthias Rex Hungarorum&quot; (Matthias King of Hungarians) to just &quot;Matthias Rex&quot;. In September 1996, when Romania signed a friendship treaty with Hungary, Funar organized a funeral ceremony on the streets of Cluj-Napoca. In 1997, he hung a banner in front of the Hungarian Consulate in Cluj saying &quot;This is the seat of the Hungarian spies in Romania&quot;. Many of Funar&#x27;s changes were reversed under the mayorship of his successor, Emil Boc.

Between 1992 and 1993, Funar supported a large-scale Ponzi scheme run by Caritas, a company based in Cluj-Napoca. Funar helped Caritas build its credibility by renting space for it in the town hall, appearing with its owner in public and on television, and defending the company from attacks. Funar also gave Caritas space in the local newspaper to list winners&#x27; names (amounting to 44 pages in 1993) and lent the owner space at the local stadium to run his operations.

Recently, Funar extended his xenophobic views to the Jewish minority, making unfounded statements: &quot;The World&#x27;s Jewish Government wants to move Israel into Romanian borders and is trying to exterminate Romanian people by using food additives&quot; or &quot;There are already more than 2 million Jews in Romania working for its destruction&quot;. He also claims that the theory of relativity was developed by the Romanian poet Mihai Eminescu and subsequently stolen by Albert Einstein (described by Funar as a &quot;retarded individual&quot;).

<doc id="1184426" wikidata="Q1328237" url="?curid=1184426" title="Nexuiz">
<text>Nexuiz is a free first-person shooter video game developed and published by Alientrap. It was released on May 31, 2005 under the GNU General Public License (GPL) and uses the DarkPlaces engine, a modified &quot;Quake&quot; engine. A remake, also called &quot;Nexuiz&quot;, was released for Steam and Xbox 360 using CryEngine 3.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Nexuiz&quot; is primarily multiplayer (though it includes a full single-player campaign, which allows one to play through the various multiplayer game types and maps with bots), and allows for hosting and joining of games. It supports new gametypes, or whole conversions quickly applied to it (much like &quot;Quake&quot;).

== Development ==
&quot;Nexuiz&quot; development started as a &quot;Quake&quot; modification in the summer of 2001 by Lee Vermeulen. Soon afterward the project moved to the DarkPlaces engine created by Ashley Hale, who later also joined the project. The original design called for a simple deathmatch project with a few levels and one character model to be released the next summer. After four years of development with no budget, &quot;Nexuiz&quot; 1.0 was released on May 31, 2005, completely under the GNU GPL, and by the end of June had over 250,000 downloads. Development continued after the initial release, with 1.1 released soon after, 1.5 released February 14, 2006, 2.0 released June 14, 2006, and 2.1 September 9, 2006. On February 29, 2008, nearly three years after the initial release, version 2.4 was released and brought major improvements to both the GUI and the graphics engine. This includes all new GUI graphics elements, as well as reflective water and improved particles. In October 2008, a call was made for more developers for &quot;Nexuiz&quot; by the main (and only) QuakeC developer, who identified organizational issues associated with many users. Responses to this call highlighted the need for better documentation of QuakeC and the Nexuiz code, while also acknowledging the difficulty that documentation of this placed on the small team of Nexuiz developers. From mid-November 2008, a number of people expressed interest in continuing development of Nexuiz.

On March 1, 2010, it was revealed that IllFonic purchased the rights to the name &quot;Nexuiz&quot;. On March 22, 2010, the fork &quot;Xonotic&quot; of &quot;Nexuiz&quot; was announced. Many of the core contributors and community members of &quot;Nexuiz&quot; moved to this new project as they felt that sale of the name Nexuiz mishandles the original project. On July 13, 2010, Crytek announced that it had licensed the Cryengine 3 for IllFonic&#x27;s &quot;Nexuiz&quot;.

== Reception ==
In the September 2006 issue of the magazine PC Gamer, &quot;Nexuiz&quot; was included in an article on Internet developers and free games impacting the industry. It also featured on the March 2007 Maximum PC and (version 2.4) was released on the May 2008 and August 2009 PC User cover disks. Upon the release of version 2.5 in April 2009, Phoronix deemed the game to be &quot;the best open-source first person shooter we have ever played.&quot;

=== Competitive play ===
GameStop locations across the US held an in-store Nexuiz &quot;PC gaming challenge&quot;. Interactive kiosks were set up in 10 different stores in 8 US cities. The kiosks gave users 2 minutes to earn the high score by doing the most damage possible to their AI opponents. The highest monthly scorer in each location won a $100 GameStop gift card. There were new maps every month, and each player was allowed one game per day. Game play was open to GameStop customers ages 13 and up, and ages 17 and above were eligible to win the monthly gift card for the high score. Cities with the Challenge were: Dallas, Miami, Chicago, Boston, Pittsburgh, Seattle, Los Angeles, and San Francisco.

== Remake and fork ==

On March 3, 2010, it was announced the name Nexuiz had been licensed to IllFonic for commercial release. This version was released on Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network and Steam. While the game uses the same name, it adopts a futuristic, Victorian art style. It is based on CryEngine 3, instead of the DarkPlaces engine used in the original game. The main page of the game changed to reflect the commercial version of the game, rather than the open source PC game although it remains accessible. Community changes to the Nexuiz project initiated two free forks called &quot;Xonotic&quot; and later Rexuiz.

==Plot==
Herbert H. Heebert is a young man who loses his girlfriend, swears off romance, and then takes a job at a genteel, women-only boarding house, run by retired opera singer Helen Wellenmellon. Although most of the women treat him like a servant, Fay helps him with his fear of women.

==Production==
Mel Brooks worked on the screenplay. He fought with Lewis and left the production. In Brooks&#x27;s biography, he stated that the final draft screenplay only featured two of his scenes and asked the Writers Guild of America to make sure that he did not get given any credit. Filming started in November 1960. The main set is a four-story doll house-like interior of a mansion turned boarding house with a central courtyard allowing crane shots spanning its three and a half floors. The structure was several rooms deep at each level and in total deep, wide and feet high. The main set alone cost $500,000 to build (equivalent to $ in ). After two weeks of filming, Lewis fired cinematographer Haskell Boggs, who had worked with him on most of his films, over a disagreement and replaced him with W. Wallace Kelley.

The film features the real-life wedding of Daria Massey and David Lee Joesting.

==Release==
The film premiered in Brooklyn on June 28, 1961. In New York City, it opened on July 12 in a double-bill with &quot;Love in a Goldfish Bowl&quot;.

==Reception==
Howard Thompson, in a review for &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Now, in all fairness to a frankly light-headed vehicle that dies on its feet, Mr. Lewis&#x27; latest gets off to a fresh and really funny beginning.&quot; However, after the first half-hour, &quot;the remainder of the picture, with everyone else firmly relegated to the background, has Mr. Lewis shuffling and stumbling in full view, as if he and the movie were merely improvising.&quot; Overall, it received mixed reviews in New York. Based on a limited selection of non-contemporary reviews, on Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 100% based on 11 reviews, with an average rating of 7.6/10.

The film grossed $271,635 in its first week of release in New York.

In 1998, Jonathan Rosenbaum of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; included the film in his unranked list of the best American films not included on the AFI Top 100.

Herbert H. Heebert&#x27;s line &quot;Hey, lady!&quot; was nominated for the American Film Institute&#x27;s 2005 list AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes.

==Home media==
The film was released on DVD on October 14, 2004, and again on July 15, 2014, as part of the four-film collection &quot;4 Film Favorites: Jerry Lewis&quot;, along with &quot;The Bellboy&quot;, &quot;The Errand Boy&quot;, and &quot;The Patsy&quot;.

<text>Jeffrey Lane Fortenberry (born December 27, 1960) is an American politician. He served in the United States House of Representatives from 2005 to 2022, representing as a member of the Republican Party.

In October 2021, a federal grand jury indicted Fortenberry on three charges of lying to investigators and concealing information about foreign campaign contributions. He was convicted of all three felony counts in March 2022. After the convictions, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy called upon Fortenberry to resign. He officially resigned on March 31, 2022. In June 2022, he was sentenced to 2 years&#x27; probation, plus community service and a fine. His conviction was overturned in December 2023.

==Early life, education and early career==
Fortenberry graduated from Catholic High in his native Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He holds a bachelor&#x27;s degree in economics from Louisiana State University, a master&#x27;s degree in public policy from Georgetown University, and a master&#x27;s degree in theology from the Franciscan University of Steubenville.

Fortenberry previously worked as an economist, in local economic development, and as a publishing executive for Sandhills Publishing. He was also a policy analyst for the Senate Subcommittee on Intergovernmental Relations. Fortenberry was an at-large member of the Lincoln City Council from 1997 to 2001.

== U.S. House of Representatives ==

=== Elections ===

==== 2004 ====

Fortenberry won the seven-candidate Republican primary to replace the retiring Doug Bereuter with 39% of the vote. He defeated Curt Bromm (33%), the Speaker of the Nebraska Legislature, and Club for Growth-endorsed businessman Greg Ruehle (21%). In the general election, he defeated State Senator Matt Connealy 54%–43%. He won all but two counties: Thurston and Burt.

Fortenberry was reelected to a third term, defeating Marine veteran Max Yashirin 70–30%.

==== 2010 ====

Fortenberry was challenged in the Republican primary for the first time since 2004. He drew two opponents and won with 84% of the vote. He was reelected to a fourth term, defeating legislative staffer Ivy Harper, 71%–29%.

Campaigning for an eighth term in October 2018, it was reported that Fortenberry&#x27;s chief of staff threatened a professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Ari Kohen, who had liked a Facebook post depicting a photo of a vandalized Fortenberry campaign sign, raising the issue to Kohen&#x27;s supervisor as well as the dean and chancellor of the university. In reaction, Kohen raised a complaint with the Office of Congressional Ethics, alleging a chilling effect on free speech.

Fortenberry defeated Democratic nominee Jessica McClure with 60% of the vote, but lost in Lancaster County.

==== 2020 ====

Fortenberry defeated Democratic state Senator Kate Bolz with 59% of the vote.


=== Tenure ===

During the week of April 12, 2021, Fortenberry made two false calls for emergency service to the United States Capitol Police through the emergency duress button in his Capitol office. The calls were apparently not for a genuine emergency, but only to check the agency&#x27;s response time.

=== Political positions ===
==== Agriculture, energy, and environment ====
Fortenberry served on the Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies. He introduced the Renewable Fuels for America&#x27;s Future Act of 2010, designed to reduce subsidies for the production of ethanol. The act would result in taxpayer savings of $5.67 billion, according to economists Ernie Goss of Creighton University and Bruce Babcock of Iowa State University.

In 2020, Fortenberry signed a forest management agreement and gathered producers across Nebraska to discuss growing the agriculture family through integrating big data, precision farming, and value-adds to maximize incomes of farms of all sizes. On August 4, 2020, a bipartisan initiative supported by Fortenberry, the Great American Outdoors Act, was signed into law by President Donald Trump. In September 2020, Fortenberry sponsored H.R. 3651, which serves to facilitate the use of certain land in Nebraska for public outdoor recreational opportunities and for other purposes.

==== Healthcare ====
Fortenberry voted against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, but said in 2010 that he supported &quot;the right type of [health care] reform&quot;, incorporating measures to reduce costs, improve outcomes and protect vulnerable people. He introduced H.R. 321, the SCHIP Plus Act of 2009, to offer eligible families the choice to retain coverage for their children in the State Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) or using program funds to help pay for family insurance plans. He introduced H.R. 5479, aimed at protecting people with preexisting conditions.

In 2020, Fortenberry introduced Matt&#x27;s Act, named in honor of one of his constituents who was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at age 13. The legislation would allow prescription drug manufacturers to sell insulin directly to patients. Fortenberry claimed it would reduce the price of insulin by two-thirds.

Fortenberry introduced ACT for ALS to help people suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) gain access to new treatments. The act would have the Department of Health and Human Services guide a new public-private partnership for streamlined research and drug approval for ALS. As of late December 2020, over 270 members of Congress co-signed the legislation.

==== Foreign and military affairs ====
In 2010, &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; magazine listed Fortenberry as a &quot;new Republican powerbroker&quot; on nuclear security issues. In an October 2010 endorsement, the &quot;Lincoln Journal Star&quot; called Fortenberry &quot;uncommonly well-informed on international issues&quot;.

Fortenberry, and then-Appropriations Committee chair Nita Lowey co-sponsored the Middle East Partnership for Peace Act (MEPPA), which aims to ease tensions between Israelis and Palestinians by giving grants and loans to startup businesses.

In his role on the Appropriations Committee, Fortenberry advocated for funding to enhance Offutt Air Force Base facilities, STRATCOM facilities, and to provide a new runway.

==== Abortion ====
Fortenberry received a 100% anti-abortion score from the National Right to Life Committee in a ranking of members of the 111th Congress (2009–2011). He spoke annually at the March for Life.

==== COVID-19 pandemic ====
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Fortenberry supported the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), providing small businesses with financial support throughout the pandemic. The program is estimated to have saved over 300,000 jobs in Nebraska. The state led the nation in PPP loans approved per capita.

==== &quot;Texas v. Pennsylvania&quot; ====
In December 2020, Fortenberry was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of &quot;Texas v. Pennsylvania&quot;, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated incumbent Donald Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.

Following the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision not to take up &quot;Texas v. Pennsylvania&quot;, and the Electoral College&#x27;s certification of the election results, Fortenberry recognized Joe Biden as President-elect and congratulated him on his victory. He voted against invalidating the election results on January 6, 2021, saying, &quot;As much as I supported President Trump to win, I believe the proposed remedy to election irregularities is inconsistent with my legal obligation and the guidance of my conscience. I took an oath to uphold the Constitution. My decision is consistent with that oath. I will vote to certify the election.&quot;

==== January 6 commission ====
On May 19, 2021, Fortenberry was one of 35 Republicans who joined all Democrats in voting to approve legislation to establish the January 6 commission meant to investigate the storming of the U.S. Capitol.

==== Immigration ====
Fortenberry voted for the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020 which authorizes the Department of Homeland Security to nearly double the available H-2B visas for the remainder of FY 2020.

Fortenberry voted for the Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1158), which effectively prohibits Immigration and Customs Enforcement from cooperating with the Department of Health and Human Services to detain or remove illegal alien sponsors of Unaccompanied Alien Children.

=== Committee assignments ===
Fortenberry previously served on the Committee on Appropriations during the 117th Congress, but stepped down from all of his committee assignments on October 20, 2021, after being indicted for allegedly concealing information and lying to the FBI about illegal contributions to his campaign. His last committee assignments were:

*United States House Committee on Appropriations
**United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies (Ranking Member)
**United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs

=== Caucus memberships ===
Fortenberry was known to serve on the below congressional caucuses.

* Republican Main Street Partnership
* Republican Governance Group
* Nuclear Security Working Group (Co-chair)
* Congressional Caucus on Beef
* Religious Minorities in the Middle East Caucus
* Friends of Switzerland Caucus
* Congressional Friends of Jordan Caucus (Vice Chair)
* Congressional Catholic Staff Association (chair)
* United States Congressional International Conservation Caucus (Co-chair)
*Republican Study Committee

==Federal conviction and resignation==
On October 19, 2021, it was announced that Fortenberry was being investigated for about $30,000 in illegal campaign contributions, funneled through three strawmen at a 2016 fundraiser in Los Angeles, that his 2016 campaign received from the Nigerian-Lebanese, Paris-based billionaire Gilbert Chagoury, who also made contributions to three other American political candidates. A federal grand jury in Los Angeles indicted him on one count of scheming to falsify and conceal material facts and two counts of making false statements to federal investigators. On March 24, 2022, Fortenberry was convicted of all three felony counts of making false statements to the FBI and concealing information about his campaign donations.

Fortenberry was quoted as saying after the trial, &quot;We always felt like it was going to be hard to have a fair process here, so this appeal starts immediately&quot;, but he could not appeal until after sentencing. Fortenberry faced up to five years in prison on each of the three felony counts, as well as fines. He is the first member of Congress convicted while in office since Chaka Fattah in 2016.

Within days of Fortenberry&#x27;s conviction, lawmakers from both parties called on him to resign from Congress. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said on March 25, &quot;I think he had his day in court... I think if he wants to appeal, he could go do that as a private citizen... But I think when someone&#x27;s convicted, it&#x27;s time to resign.&quot; On March 26, Fortenberry issued a written statement to his colleagues in the House that said, &quot;Due to the difficulties of my current circumstances, I can no longer effectively serve. I will resign from Congress effective March 31, 2022.&quot;

On June 28, 2022, federal judge Stanley Blumenfeld sentenced Fortenberry to two years&#x27; probation, 320 hours of community service and a $25,000 fine.

On December 26, 2023, a panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit overturned Fortenberry&#x27;s conviction and sentence, ruling that he was tried in an improper venue, where his alleged crimes had not taken place. On May 9, 2024, federal prosecutors reissued the same criminal charges against Fortenberry, making a retrial more likely. 

On January 29, 2025, the Justice Department filed to drop all charges against Fortenberry.

<text>Riva Records was a British record label founded in the UK in 1975 by Billy Gaff, manager of Rod Stewart.

Rod Stewart signed to the label in the UK, but stayed with Warner Bros. Records in the US and the rest of the world. Another well-known artist on the label was John Cougar Mellencamp, distributed by PolyGram in the US, and WEA in most other countries. After Stewart and Mellencamp left the label, it stopped operating. Billy died in Dublin on 25 April 2022.

Stewart left in 1982 (last issue &quot;How Long&quot;), whereas Mellencamp stayed a little later. A variety of acts then had singles released on Riva in the UK (see below); the last known UK release was RIVA 51 (Glory with &quot;Hearts Will Sing&quot; / &quot;As It Is&quot;) in 1987. Other acts to have releases on Riva included:

* Lewis Sisters / Lewis
* Blinding Tears
* Phil Thornalley
* Carmine Appice
* The Lookalikes, with Sean O&#x27;Connor

<doc id="1184440" wikidata="Q7774724" url="?curid=1184440" title="The Wichita Eagle">
<text>The Wichita Eagle is a daily newspaper published in Wichita, Kansas, United States. Originating in the early 1870s, shortly after the city&#x27;s founding, it is owned by The McClatchy Company and is the largest newspaper in Wichita and the surrounding area. 

In September, 1960, The Wichita Eagle purchased the assets of its longtime chief rival, the Wichita Beacon, it became The Wichita Eagle and Beacon or The Wichita Eagle-Beacon, until the Beacon moniker was dropped in 1989. 
==History==

===Origins===
In 1870, &quot;The Vidette&quot; was the first newspaper established in Wichita by Fred A. Sowers and W. B. Hutchinson. It operated briefly.

On April 12, 1872, &quot;The Wichita Eagle&quot; was founded and edited by Marshall M. Murdock, and it became a daily paper in May 1884. His son, Victor Murdock, was a reporter for the paper during his teens, the managing editor from 1894 to 1903, an editor from the mid-1920s until his death in 1945.

In October 1872, &quot;The Wichita Daily Beacon&quot; was founded by Fred A. Sowers and David Millison. It published daily for two months, then weekly until 1884 when it went back to daily. In 1907, Henry Allen purchased the &quot;Beacon&quot; and was publisher for many years. In 1926, the Levand brothers, Max, Leonard, John and Louis purchased the Wichita Beacon from Senator Henry Allen. The Levand brothers had grown up in Denver selling the Denver Post on the street-corners of Denver. Max Levand remained editor, publisher until his death in March of 1960.

===Mergers===
The &quot;Eagle&quot; and &quot;Beacon&quot; competed for 88 years, then in 1960 the &quot;Eagle&quot; purchased the &quot;Beacon&quot;. Both newspapers continued to be published, the &quot;Eagle&quot; in the morning, the &quot;Beacon&quot; in the evening, the &quot;Eagle and Beacon&quot; on Sunday.

In 1973, the Murdock family sold the paper to Ridder Publications. Ridder and Knight Newspapers merged in 1974 to form Knight Ridder, which combined the two newspapers into &quot;The Wichita Eagle-Beacon&quot; in 1980.

In 1989, the &quot;Beacon&quot; name was dropped, and the newspaper became &quot;The Wichita Eagle&quot;.

In 2006, the &quot;Eagle&quot; became part of The McClatchy Company when McClatchy bought Knight Ridder.

===Internet===
On November 18, 1996, the &quot;Eagle&quot; launched its first website, &quot;Wichita Online&quot;, at wichitaeagle.com. On January 22, 2000, it shifted its primary content to the domain kansas.com.

===Move===
In spring 2016, McClatchy Company announced that it would transfer printing of the &quot;Eagle&quot; from Wichita to its &quot;Kansas City Star&quot; printing line in Kansas City, Missouri, which already prints other newspapers such as &quot;Lawrence Journal-World&quot; and &quot;Topeka Capital-Journal&quot;. The move eliminated 27 full-time and 47 part-time jobs. The building will be sold and the editing staff will move to a smaller location in downtown Wichita. In fall 2016, Cargill announced that it would move its &quot;Protein Group&quot; headquarters from downtown Wichita into a new $60 Million building on the site of the former &quot;Eagle&quot; building at 825 East Douglas Avenue in Old Town.

In January 2017, the paper announced it had signed a deal for office space in the Old Town area of downtown Wichita. It plans to move newsroom and advertising employees to 330 North Mead (from 825 East Douglas) in the spring of 2017. The new site is located southeast of the Warren Old Town Theater.

Effective October 23, 2023, the paper&#x27;s daily print edition will be delivered via the U.S. Mail instead of delivery by a local carrier.

==Civic journalism==

The paper built its national reputation largely under the editorship of W. Davis &quot;Buzz&quot; Merritt Jr., one of the earliest and most vocal proponents of civic journalism (also known as public journalism) which believes that journalists and their audiences are not merely spectators in political and social processes, and that journalists should not simply report dry facts as a pretense that their reporting represents unadulterated neutrality, which is impossible. Instead, the civic journalism movement seeks to treat readers and community members as participants. With a small, but growing following, civic journalism has become as much of an ideology as it is a practice.

&quot;The Wichita Eagle&quot; was at the forefront of this movement. For example, for elections held in 1990, the paper polled 500 residents to identify their top concerns for the state. Then, over the course of the elections, reporters for the paper attempted to pin down the candidates on how they felt about these issues, and printed a pull-out section each week with a list of the issues and where the candidates stated they stood. If the candidate refused to take a stand, that was also reported. This is in stark contrast to the former practice of simply reporting the facts about a candidate&#x27;s speech. As a result, voter turnout in the &quot;Eagle&quot;&#x27;s primary circulation area was 43.3 percent, compared with 31 percent for the rest of the state.

<text>Illinois Route 25 (IL 25) is a state route in northeast Illinois. It runs north from U.S. Route 34 in Oswego to Illinois Route 62 (Algonquin Road) in Algonquin. Illinois 25 is in length.

==Route description==

Illinois Route 25 was opened in August 1929; it originally ran from Elgin to East Dundee. It was extended southward to St. Charles in 1930. The entirety of this road follows part of the Fox River on its eastern bank. Illinois Route 31 parallels Route 25 (and the river) on the western bank of the river.

Route 25&#x27;s southern terminus is in Oswego. It moves northward into Montgomery, where U.S. Highway 30 passes over, but does not have an interchange with it. Route 25 then passes through downtown Aurora. It then winds through North Aurora and Batavia, lacking an interchange with Interstate 88. Route 25 intersects Illinois Route 56 in North Aurora, Illinois Route 38 in Geneva, and Illinois Route 64 in St. Charles.

Route 25 continues northward through South Elgin and into Elgin, intersecting with U.S. Highway 20, and forming the western terminus of both Illinois Route 19 and Illinois Route 58 there.

North of Elgin, Route 25 intersects Interstate 90 and continues into East Dundee, crossing State Routes 72, the main east–west route through the Dundee area, and 68 near its western end. After this, the road passes through Carpentersville, and finally ends at Illinois Route 62 in Algonquin. Route 25 is also known as J.F. Kennedy Memorial Drive within Carpentersville&#x27;s boundaries.

==History==
SBI Route 25 was originally what is now U.S. Route 45 from Fairfield north to Kankakee. In 1935, IL 25 moved entirely from US 45 to its current routing.

==Major intersections==
IDOT has surveyed the route from north to south. Mileposts are given in distances from southern terminus, while mileage under county names reflects IDOT surveying.

<text>The Maryland Senate, sometimes referred to as the Maryland State Senate, is the upper house of the General Assembly, the state legislature of the U.S. state of Maryland. Composed of 47 senators elected from an equal number of constituent single-member districts, the Senate is responsible, along with the Maryland House of Delegates, for passage of laws in Maryland, and for confirming executive appointments made by the Governor of Maryland.

It evolved from the upper house of the colonial assembly created in 1650 when Maryland was a proprietary colony controlled by Cecilius Calvert. It consisted of the Governor and members of the Governor&#x27;s appointed council. With slight variation, the body to meet in that form until 1776, when Maryland, now a state independent of British rule, passed a new constitution that created an electoral college to appoint members of the Senate. This electoral college was abolished in 1838 and members began to be directly elected from each county and Baltimore City. In 1972, because of a Supreme Court decision, the number of districts was increased to 47, and the districts were balanced by population rather than being geographically determined.

To serve in the Maryland Senate, a person must be a citizen of Maryland 25 years of age or older. Elections for the 47 Senate seats are held every four years coincident with the federal election in which the President of the United States is not elected. Vacancies are filled through appointment by the Governor. The Senate meets for three months every year; the rest of the year the work of the Senate is light and most members hold another job during this time. It has been controlled by Democrats since 1900. In the 2018 election, more than two-thirds of the Senate seats were won by Democrats.

Senators elect a President to serve as presiding officer of the legislative body, as well as a President Pro Tempore. The President appoints chairs and membership of six standing committees, four legislative committees as well as the Executive Nominations and Rules Committees. Senators are also organized into caucuses, including party- and demographically-based caucuses. They are assisted in their work by paid staff of the non-partisan Department of Legislative Services and by partisan office staff.

==History==

The origins of the Maryland Senate lie in the creation of an assembly during the early days of the Maryland colony. This assembly first met in 1637, making it the longest continuously operating legislative body in the United States. Originally, the assembly was unicameral, but in 1650, the Governor and his appointed council began serving as the upper house of a now bicameral legislature. These appointees had close political and economic ties to the proprietors of the Maryland colony, Cecilius Calvert and his descendants. Thus, the upper house in colonial times often disagreed with the lower house, which was elected, tended to be more populist, and pushed for greater legislative power in the colony.

The upper house was briefly abolished during the English Civil War, as Puritan governors attempted to consolidate control and prevent the return of any proprietary influence. It was again abolished by Governor Josias Fendall in 1660, who sought to create a colonial government based on an elected unicameral legislature like that of the Virginia colony. The position of Governor was removed from the legislature in 1675, but for the following century, its function and powers largely remained the same.

In 1776, following the signing of the Declaration of Independence and the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, Maryland threw off proprietary control and established a new constitution. Under this new constitution, the upper house of the General Assembly first became known as the Maryland Senate. The new body consisted of fifteen senators appointed to five-year terms by an electoral college. The college, made up of two electors from each county and one each from the cities of Baltimore and Annapolis, was required to select nine senators from the western shore and six from the eastern shore.

The first election under the 1776 constitution took place in 1781, and the system would not change again until 1838. In the interim, a number of problems had cropped up in the appointment process. Under the 1776 constitution, the electoral college selected all of the State Senators, and faced no restrictions, other than the geographic requirement, in how they were selected. As a result, it was commonplace for the electoral college to select a State Senate entirely composed of one political party. Only in 1826, when National Republicans won a majority on the electoral college with a pledge to elect a balanced Senate, was more than one party represented. That year, the electoral college selected 11 National Republicans and four Federalists. Additionally, all vacancies in the State Senate were filled by the Senate itself, which frequently resulted in a disproportionately high share of the Senate having been appointed to fill vacancies. During one session, fourteen out of fifteen senators had been selected to fill vacancies.

In 1836, tensions rose over the State Senate&#x27;s composition. That year, the Democratic Party won 53% of the statewide vote for the electoral college, but ended up with only nineteen of forty electors. When the Whig electors planned to elect an all-Whig State Senate, the Democratic electors absconded, denying the electoral college a quorum. The refusal to elect a State Senate also prevented the election of a Governor, as Maryland&#x27;s governors were elected by the legislature. Ultimately, however, the Democrats&#x27; position weakened following the State House elections the following month, when the Whigs won an overwhelming majority. The electors returned, providing a quorum, and an all-Whig Senate was elected.

The controversy ultimately resulted in long-term changes to the body in 1838. The electoral college was abolished, terms were lengthened to six years with rotating elections such that a third of the senate would be elected every two years, a single Senator was chosen by direct election from each county and the City of Baltimore, and vacancies were filled by special elections. The Senate no longer acted as the Governor&#x27;s Council, although they would continue to confirm the Governor&#x27;s appointments. Constitutional changes altered this new system slightly in 1851, when terms were shortened to four years, and 1864, when Baltimore City was given three Senate districts rather than one, but substantial change to the structure of the Senate did not come again until 1964.

In 1964, the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Reynolds v. Sims&quot; that state legislative seats must be apportioned on the principle of one man, one vote. A number of state legislatures, including Maryland, had systems based on geography rather than population, and the court rules that this violated the 14th Amendment. Disproportionate population growth across Maryland since 1838 meant that the principle of one seat per county gave the voters of some counties, such as those on the eastern shore, disproportionate representation. Other counties, especially those in suburban areas, were underrepresented.

A special session of the legislature in 1965 changed the Senate to represent 16 districts and reapportioned the seats, again by county, but did so in such a way as to make the representation more proportional to population than it had been. Thus, the eastern shore, which had previously elected nine senators, elected only four after 1965. This was done to preserve the ideal of having whole counties represented by a single Senator, rather than breaking counties up into multiple districts. A constitutional amendment in 1972 expanded the Senate to 47 members, elected from districts proportional to the population. These districts are reapportioned every ten years based on the United States Census to ensure they remain proportional.

==Powers and legislative process==

The Maryland Senate, as the upper house of the bicameral Maryland General Assembly, shares with the Maryland House of Delegates the responsibility for making laws in the state of Maryland. Bills are often developed in the period between sessions of the General Assembly by the Senate&#x27;s standing committees or by individual senators. They are then submitted by senators to the Maryland Department of Legislative Services for drafting of legislative language. Between 2000 and 2005, an average of 907 bills were introduced in the Senate annually during the three-month legislative session. The bill is submitted, and receives the first of three constitutionally mandated readings on the floor of the Senate, before being assigned to a committee. The decision about whether legislation passes is often made in the committees. Committees can hold legislation and prevent it from reaching the Senate floor. The recommendations of committees on bills carry tremendous weight; it is rare for the Senate as a whole to approve legislation that has received a negative committee report. Once a committee has weighed in on a piece of legislation, the bill returns to the floor for second hearing, called the &quot;consideration of committee&quot; report, and a third hearing, which happens just before the floor vote on it.

Once passed by the Senate, a bill is sent to the House of Delegates for consideration. If the House also approves the bill without amendment, it is sent to the Governor. If there is amendment, however, the Senate may either reconsider the bill with amendments or ask for the establishment of a conference committee to work out differences in the versions of the bill passed by each chamber. Once a piece of legislation approved by both houses is forwarded to the Governor, it may either be signed or vetoed. If it is signed, it takes effect on the effective date of the legislation, usually October 1 of that year. If it is vetoed, both the Senate and the House of Delegates must vote by a three-fifths majority to overturn the veto. They may not, however, overturn a veto in the first year of a new term, since the bill would have been passed during the previous session. Additionally, joint resolutions and the budget bill may not be vetoed, although the General Assembly is constitutionally limited in the extent to which it may influence the latter; it may only decrease the Governor&#x27;s budget proposal, not increase it.

Unlike the House of Delegates, the Senate has the sole responsibility in the state&#x27;s legislative branch for confirming gubernatorial appointees to positions that require confirmation. After the Governor forwards his nomination to the Senate, the Executive Nominations Committee reviews the nominee and makes a recommendation for confirmation or rejection to the Senate as a whole. Only one gubernatorial nominee in recent history has been rejected; Lynn Buhl, nominated as Maryland Secretary of the Environment by Governor Robert Ehrlich, was rejected over concerns about her qualifications. The Senate also has sole responsibility for trying any persons that have been impeached by the House of Delegates. They must be sworn in before such a trial takes place, and a two-thirds majority is required for conviction of the impeached person.

==Organization==

Maryland&#x27;s Senate consists of senators elected from 47 Senate districts. While each senator has the power to introduce and vote on bills and make motions on the floor, various committees, caucuses, and leadership positions help to organize the work of the Senate. Senators elect a President of the Senate, who serves as the presiding officer of the chamber. They also elect a President Pro Tempore, who presides over the chamber when the President is absent. The President of the Maryland Senate has significant influence over legislation that passes through the body through both formal means, such as his ability to appoint committee chairs and leaders of the majority party, and informal means that are less easily defined. These powers place the President of the Maryland Senate among the strongest state legislature presiding officers in the country.

Once legislation is introduced, it is passed to one of the standing committees of the Senate. There are six such committees. As a whole, the Maryland General Assembly has fewer standing committees than any other state legislature in the United States. Each committee has between 10 and 15 members. Four of the standing committees deal primarily with legislation; the Budget and Taxation Committee, the Education, Energy, and Environment Committee, the Finance Committee, and the Judicial Proceedings Committee. The Chairs of these legislative committees have the power to determine whether their committees will hear a bill, and they therefore have significant influence over legislation. The Executive Nominations Committee manages the Senate&#x27;s responsibility to confirm gubernatorial appointments and makes recommendations of approval and disapproval to the body as a whole. Lastly, the Rules Committee sets the rules and procedures of the body. It also has the power to review legislation that has been introduced by a member of the Senate after the deadline for submission, and decide whether to refer it to a standing committee or let it die. Along with serving on the Senate committees, members of the Senate also serve on a number of joint committees with members of the House of Delegates.

While the committees are established by formal Senate rules, there are a number of caucuses that exercise significant influence over the legislative process. The most powerful of these are the Democratic Caucus and the Republican Caucus, each of which has a leader and a whip, referred to as a majority and minority leader and whip. As Democrats currently control a majority of seats in the Senate, their leader is referred to as the Majority Leader, and their caucus is able to influence legislation to a greater extent than the Republican caucus. The Majority Leader and Minority leader are responsible for managing their party&#x27;s participation in debate on the floor. Party caucuses also raise and distribute campaign money to assist their candidates. The Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland and Women Legislators of Maryland, caucuses of African-American and female Senators respectively, also play prominent roles in the Senate.

Professional services for members of the Senate and the House of Delegates are provided by the Department of Legislative Services, which is non-partisan. Individual members are also assisted by partisan staff members, and those in leadership positions have additional partisan staff. These staff members help to manage the offices of the senators. Each senator has one year-round administrative assistant, as well as a secretary who assists them during the legislative session. There is also an allowance given to help pay for district offices.

==Membership==
===Qualifications===
To be eligible to run for the Maryland Senate, a person must be a citizen and be at least 25 years old. They must also have lived in the state for at least one year, and must have lived in the district in which they are to run for at least six months, assuming the district has existed with its current boundaries for at least that long. No elected or appointed official of the United States government, including the military, may serve in the Senate, excluding those serving in the military reserves and National Guard. Similarly, no employees of the state government may serve, except for law enforcement officers, firefighters, and rescue workers.

===Elections and vacancies===
Members of the Maryland Senate are elected every four years, in off-year elections in the middle of terms for Presidents of the United States. Party nominations are determined by primary elections. The general election for Senate seats and all other state and federal elections in the normal cycle is held on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Should a Senate seat become vacant in the middle of a term, because of death, illness, incapacitation, disqualification, resignation, or expulsion of a member of the Senate, that seat is filled by appointment. The Central Committee of the previous Senator&#x27;s party in the county or counties in which the Senate district lies makes a recommendation to the Governor on whom to appoint to the seat. Within fifteen days of the Central Committee&#x27;s recommendation being selected, the Governor must appoint that person to the vacant seat.

The 47 districts from which senators are elected are apportioned every ten years on the basis of population. Maryland&#x27;s constitution explicitly defines the process for the drawing of these districts, requiring that the Governor make a recommendation of a new electoral map and submit it for legislative approval. As of 2005, there were approximately 112,000 people in each district. Each Senate district also elects three Delegates, and incumbent senators and delegates will often run jointly as members of incumbent slates in their districts. It is rare, however, for an incumbent to be challenged.

===Salaries and benefits===
Members of the State Senate and the House of Delegates, besides the Senate President and Speaker of the House of Delegates (referred to as the &quot;Presiding Officers&quot;), earn the same salary. These salaries are determined by the General Assembly Compensation Commission. After two terms, 2007-2010 and 2011-2014, during which the salary for members of the General Assembly was $43,500 per year ($56,500 for the Presiding Officers), members began receiving annual raises in 2015 such that, at the start of the 2018 General Assembly Session, they will be earning $50,330 per year, an increase of about 16 percent over four years. The salaries of the Presiding Officers will be increased to $65,371 annually. The increase is being phased in the amounts of approximately $1,707 per year for rank-and-file legislators and $2,218 per year for the Presiding Officers.

Senators can also seek reimbursement for expenses related to meals and lodging during the legislative session, and for certain travel expenses related to their duties at any point during the year. They also have access to benefits received by state employees, including health and life insurance as well as retirement savings plans. Maryland has a voluntary legislator pension plan to which both senators and delegates have access. Besides receiving their own benefits, Senators can award up to $138,000 each year in scholarships to students of their choosing if those students meet requirements set by Senate rules.

===Current makeup===
As of January 2023, a majority of seats in the Maryland Senate are held by members of the Democratic Party, with 34 Democrats and 13 Republicans, greater than a two-thirds majority. This dominance is nothing new, as Democrats have had strong majorities in the chamber for decades. Democrats tend to control seats in the large population centers such as Baltimore City, Montgomery County, and Prince George&#x27;s County, while Republicans control most seats on the Eastern Shore and in western Maryland. The chamber has also had significant numbers of women and African-Americans serve, with women averaging around 36% of the seats and African-Americans around 31%.

===Leadership===
On January 8, 2020, Democratic senator Bill Ferguson, from the 46th district, was elected to the position of Senate president following the retirement of the longest-serving Senate president in both Maryland and American history, Thomas V. Mike Miller. Melony G. Griffith, from the 25th District in Prince George&#x27;s County, is the President Pro Tempore. The Democratic caucus is led by Majority Leader Nancy J. King of the 39th District in Montgomery County. Stephen S. Hershey Jr. of the 36th District, which covers Caroline, Cecil, Kent, and Queen Anne&#x27;s counties, was elected as the minority leader by the Senate&#x27;s Republican Caucus in 2022.

==Rules and procedures==
Many rules and procedures in the Maryland Senate are set by the state constitution. Beyond the constitutional mandates, rules in the Senate are developed by the Rules Committee. The Senate and House of Delegates both meet for ninety days following the second Wednesday in January, although these sessions may be extended for up to thirty days by majority votes in both houses, and special sessions may be called by the Governor. The Senate meets in the Senate Chamber of the Maryland State House, which has both gallery seating and a door open to the State House lobby, the latter being mandated by the state constitution. Seating in the Senate is by party, with the leaders of each party choosing the exact seating assignments. Each Senator has offices in Annapolis, in the Miller or James Senate Office Buildings.

A typical session of the Senate begins with a call to order by the President of the Senate. After the call to order, the previous day&#x27;s journal is approved, petitions are heard, and orders involving committee and leadership appointments or changes to the rules are presented. First, readings of legislation take place. Senators are then given leeway to introduce any visitors, often people observing its deliberations from the gallery above the Senate chamber. Then the Senators consider legislation. They begin with unfinished business from the previous session, then consider legislation and special orders with accompanying reports from committees. At the discretion of the presiding officer, the Senate may adjourn at any time, unless a majority of members present object to adjournment.

Lobbying is common in Annapolis; there are more than 700 lobbyists registered with the state. While lobbyists may spend freely on advocacy, they are limited in gifts to legislators and in their ability to contribute to campaigns. Ethics issues related to lobbyists and other matters are handled by the Joint Committee on Legislative Ethics, a twelve-member committee that includes six senators. Members of the Senate may turn to either this committee or an ethics counsel to help them resolve questions of potential ethical conflict. Members are encouraged to avoid conflicts of interest, and are required to submit public financial disclosures to the state. In addition to employment prohibitions laid out in the state constitution, members are barred from advocating for any paying client before any part of the state government.

<doc id="1184444" wikidata="Q2110492" url="?curid=1184444" title="Penguin Adventure">
<text>is a racing platform game released by Konami in 1986, and a sequel to 1983&#x27;s &quot;Antarctic Adventure&quot;. The game marks the professional debut of game designer Hideo Kojima, who participated in the planning.

The story follows Penta, a penguin who has to bring home a golden apple in order to cure Penguette, the Penguin Princess.

==Gameplay==
This title significantly expanded upon the gameplay of &quot;Antarctic Adventure&quot; by most notably adding a greater variety of stages and enemies and role-playing elements: boss fights, purchasable items, and several minigames. Items can be purchased through three different fisherman, in exchange for fish, that give Penta new abilities. One of the items that can be bought is a gun.

Level design and variety have increased from &quot;Antarctic Adventure&quot;; there are forest levels, ice levels, water-based levels, caves, and even some outer-space bonus levels. There are several shortcuts, usually hidden underneath holes (which are typically harmful hazards) in the game, that allow the player to go on almost completely different paths. The game features multiple endings, with the hidden good ending available when the player pauses the game a certain number of times. In the bad ending, the princess dies, while in the good ending, she lives.

Some publications have stated that Kojima reused the idea for multiple endings from this game in &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; and, to an extent, &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot;, due to it often being cited as his debut game. However, Kojima himself has stated that he only participated in the project for about a month to help plan the game, pitching suggestions such as the slot machine in the shop and how to defeat the bosses. Additionally, his name does not appear in the credits either. Kojima&#x27;s first game credit and directorial debut would be with &quot;Metal Gear&quot;, released for the MSX2 the next year.

== Ports ==
* Zemina, a South Korean video game company, made an unauthorized Master System port with the same title, credited as Kkum-Uidaelyug () on the cartridge, which was published towards the end of the 1980s.
* The MSX version was re-released on several platforms during the years: first on PlayStation and Sega Saturn as part of &quot;Konami Antiques MSX Collection&quot; in 1997/1999, then on Virtual Console (first for Wii on 24 November 2009, later for Wii U on 29 January 2014) in Japan, and on PC on 11 April 2014 in Japan (as &quot;Project EGG&quot;).
* A mobile version was released on 31 May 2006 only in Japan.

== Other media ==

In 2006, &quot;Konami Digital Entertainment Tokyo&quot; serialized a series of digital comics based on the video game of the same name, titled .

<text>James Hudson Taylor (; 21 May 1832 – 3 June 1905) was a British Protestant Christian missionary to China and founder of the China Inland Mission (CIM, now OMF International). Taylor spent 54 years in China. The society that he began was responsible for bringing over 800 missionaries to the country who started 125 schools and directly resulted in 20,000 Christian conversions, as well as the establishment of more than 300 stations of work with more than 499 local helpers in all 18 provinces.

Taylor was known for his admiration for Chinese culture and zeal for evangelism. He adopted wearing native Chinese clothing even though this was very rare among missionaries of that time. Under his leadership, the CIM was singularly non-denominational in practice and accepted members from all Protestant groups, including individuals from the working class, and single women as well as multinational recruits. Primarily because the CIM campaigned against the opium trade, Taylor has been referred to as one of the most significant Europeans to visit China in the 19th century. Historian Ruth Tucker summarizes the theme of his life:
Taylor was able to preach in several varieties of Chinese, including Mandarin, Chaozhou, and the Wu dialects of Shanghai and Ningbo. The last of these he knew well enough to help prepare a colloquial edition of the New Testament written in it.

==Youth and early work==

Taylor was born on 21 May 1832 in Barnsley, Yorkshire, the son of a chemist (pharmacist) and Methodist lay preacher James Taylor and his wife, Amelia (Hudson), but as a young man he doubted the Christian beliefs of his parents. At age 16, after reading an evangelistic tract pamphlet entitled &quot;Poor Richard&quot;, he professed faith in Christ. In December 1849 he committed himself to going to China as a missionary. At this time he came into contact with Edward Cronin of Kensington—one of the members of the first missionary party of the Plymouth Brethren to Baghdad. Taylor was able to borrow a copy of &quot;China: Its State and Prospects&quot; by Walter Henry Medhurst, which he quickly read. About this time, he began studying the languages of Mandarin, Greek, Hebrew, and Latin.

In May 1850, he began studying medicine. In 1851, he moved to a poor neighborhood in Kingston upon Hull to be a medical assistant with Robert Hardey and began preparing himself for a life of faith and service, devoting himself to the poor and exercising faith that God would provide for his needs. He practiced distributing gospel tracts and open-air preaching. He was baptized by Andrew John Jukes of the Plymouth Brethren in the Hull Brethren Assembly in 1852, and convinced his sister Amelia to also take adult baptism.

In 1852 he began studying medicine at the London Hospital Medical College in Whitechapel, London, as preparation for working in China. The great interest awakened in England about China through the civil war, which was then erroneously supposed to be a mass movement toward Christianity, together with the glowing but exaggerated reports made by Karl Gützlaff concerning China&#x27;s accessibility, led to the founding of the Chinese Evangelisation Society, to the service of which Hudson Taylor offered himself as their first missionary.

==First visit to China==
Taylor left England on 19 September 1853 as an agent of the Chinese Evangelisation Society before completing his medical studies, departing from Liverpool and arriving in Shanghai on 1 March 1854. The nearly disastrous voyage aboard the clipper &quot;Dumfries&quot; through an easterly passage near Buru Island lasted about five months. In China, he was immediately faced with civil war, throwing his first year there into turmoil.

Taylor made 18 preaching tours in the vicinity of Shanghai starting in 1855 and was often poorly received by the people, even though he brought with him medical supplies and skills. He made a decision to adopt the native Chinese clothes and queue (pigtail) with a shaven forehead and was then able to gain an audience without creating a disturbance. Previous to this, Taylor realized that wherever he went he was being referred to as a &quot;black devil&quot; because of the overcoat he wore. He distributed thousands of Chinese Gospel tracts and portions of Scripture in and around Shanghai. During his stay in Shanghai, he also adopted and cared for a Chinese boy named Hanban.

Scottish evangelist William Chalmers Burns of the English Presbyterian Mission began work in Shantou, and for a period in 1855-56, Taylor joined him there. After leaving he later found that all of his medical supplies, being stored in Shanghai, had been destroyed by a fire. Then in October 1856, while traveling across China he was robbed of nearly everything he owned.

Relocated in Ningbo by 1857, Taylor received a letter from a supportive George Müller which led to Taylor and his co-worker John Jones deciding to resign from the problematic mission board which had sent them and instead work independently in what came to be called the &quot;Ningbo Mission&quot;. Four Chinese men joined them in their work: Ni Yongfa, Feng Ninggui, Wang Laijun, and Qiu Guogui.

In 1858, Taylor married Maria Jane Dyer, the orphaned daughter of the Reverend Samuel Dyer of the London Missionary Society, who had been a pioneer missionary to the Chinese in Penang, Malaysia. Hudson met Maria in Ningbo where she lived and worked at a school for girls which was run by Mary Ann Aldersey, one of the first female missionaries to the Chinese, and they were married at the British Consulate there.

As a married couple, the Taylors took care of an adopted boy named Tianxi while living in Ningbo. They had a baby of their own that died late in 1858. Their first surviving child, Grace, was born in 1859. Shortly after she was born, the Taylors took over all of the operations at the hospital in Ningbo that had been run by William Parker. In a letter to his sister Amelia Hudson Taylor he wrote on 14 February 1860, 

Because of health problems, in 1860 Taylor decided to return to England for a furlough with his family. The Taylors sailed back to England aboard the tea clipper &quot;Jubilee&quot; along with their daughter, Grace, and a young man, Wang Laijun, from the Bridge Street church in Ningbo, who would help with the Bible translation work that would continue in England.

==Family and China Inland Mission==
Taylor used his time in England to continue his work, in company with Frederick Foster Gough of the Church Mission Society translating the New Testament into a Romanised Ningbo dialect for the British and Foreign Bible Society. He completed his diploma (and a course in midwifery) at the Royal London Hospital with the Royal College of Surgeons in 1862, and with Maria&#x27;s help, wrote a book called &quot;&quot; in 1865 which was instrumental in generating sympathy for China and volunteers for the mission field, who began to go out in 1862, the first being James Joseph Meadows. In the book Taylor wrote:

He travelled extensively around the British Isles speaking at churches and promoting the needs of China. At home, in the East End of London he also ministered at Newgate Prison. During this time he became friends with Charles Spurgeon, who pastored the Metropolitan Tabernacle and became a lifelong supporter of Taylor. The Taylors hosted the young Thomas John Barnardo at their house as a potential missionary candidate between 1865 and 1866.

Their second child, Herbert, was born in London in 1861. More children were born to the Taylors: in 1862 Frederick, in 1864 Samuel, and in 1865 Jane, who died at birth.

On 25 June 1865 at Brighton, Taylor dedicated himself to God for the founding of a new society to undertake the evangelization of the &quot;unreached&quot; inland provinces of China. He founded the China Inland Mission (CIM) together with William Thomas Berger shortly thereafter. In less than one year, they had accepted 21 missionaries and raised over £2,000 (about £321,500 in 2023 terms). In early 1866 Taylor published the first edition of the &quot;Occasional Paper of the China Inland Mission&quot; which later became &quot;China&#x27;s Millions&quot;.

The following summary by Taylor came to be held as the core values of the CIM in what came to be a classic description of future faith missions:
In 1866 he and the missionaries went to China. On 26 May 1866, after more than five years of working in England, Taylor and family set sail for China with their new missions team &quot;the Lammermuir Party&quot; aboard the tea clipper &quot;Lammermuir&quot;. A four-month voyage was considered speedy at the time. While in the South China Sea and also the Pacific Ocean the ship was nearly wrecked but survived two typhoons. They arrived safely in Shanghai on 30 September 1866.

==Return to China==

The arrival of the largest party of missionaries ever sent to China, as well as their intent to be dressed in native clothing, gave the foreign settlement in Shanghai much to talk about, and some criticism began for the young China Inland Mission. The party donned Chinese clothing, even the women missionaries, which was deemed semi-scandalous at the time. When other missionaries sought to preserve their British ways, Taylor was convinced that the Gospel would only take root on Chinese soil if missionaries were willing to affirm the culture of the people they were seeking to reach. He argued, from the example of the Apostle Paul, that in everything &quot;not sinful&quot; missionaries should become like the Chinese, &quot;that by all means, we may save some.&quot;

They traveled down the Grand Canal of China to make the first settlement in the war-torn city of Hangzhou. Another daughter was born to them in China (Maria Hudson Taylor). Taylor began practicing much sought-after medical work and preaching every day under an exhausting schedule. Hundreds came to hear and be treated.

Conflicts within the Lammermuir team limited their effectiveness, but when Taylor&#x27;s daughter Grace died of meningitis in 1867, they united for a time and sorted out their discord after witnessing Taylor place the cares of his fellow missionaries above even the concern that he had for his ailing daughter. Many of the Lammermuir crew were converted to Christianity.

==Riot in Yangzhou==

In 1868 the Taylors took a party of missionaries up to Yangzhou to start a new work. But problems continued in 1868 when their mission premises were attacked, looted, and burned during the Yangzhou riot. Despite the violence and injuries, no one was killed. The international outrage at the Chinese for the attack on these British nationals (and the subsequent arrival of the Royal Navy) caused the China Inland Mission and Taylor to be criticized in the British press for almost starting a war. Taylor never requested military intervention, but some voices in the British Parliament called for &quot;the withdrawal of all missionaries from China&quot;. However, the Taylors returned to Yangzhou later that year to continue in the work and many converts to Christianity were made.

In 1869 Hudson was influenced by a passage on personal holiness from a book called &quot;Christ Is All&quot; by Henry Law that was sent to him by a fellow missionary, John McCarthy. &quot;The Lord Jesus received is holiness begun; the Lord Jesus cherished is holiness advancing; the Lord Jesus counted upon as never absent would be holiness complete.&quot; This new understanding of continually abiding in Christ endured for the rest of his life. At the time, he was quoted by fellow missionary Charles Henry Judd as saying: &quot;Oh, Mr. Judd, God has made me a new man!&quot; Taylor later sent out &quot;How to Live on Christ&quot;, a booklet by Harriet Beecher Stowe that first appeared as an introduction to &quot;Religion as it Should Be&quot;, a book written by Christopher Dean and published in 1847.

==Loss of Maria==
In 1868 another child, Charles, was born into the Taylor family, and in 1870 Taylor and his wife made the difficult decision to send their older three surviving children (Bertie, Freddie, and Maria—Samuel died earlier that year) home to England with their children&#x27;s caretaker, Emily Blatchley. In July, Noel was born, though he died of malnutrition and deprivation two weeks later because of Maria&#x27;s inability to nurse him. Maria died several days later, with the official cause of death being cholera. Her death shook Taylor deeply, and in 1871 his health began deteriorating further, leading to his return to England later that year to recuperate and take care of business items.
Back in England, Taylor was married to Jane Elizabeth Faulding who had been a fellow missionary since 1866. Hudson and &quot;Jennie&quot; returned to China in late 1872 aboard the MM Tigre. They were in Nanjing when Jennie gave birth to stillborn twins—a boy and a girl in 1873. Two years later, the Taylors were forced to return once again to England because of the death of the mission secretary and Blatchley.

During the winter of 1874 and 1875, Taylor was practically paralyzed from a fall he had taken on a riverboat while in China. In this state of crippling physical hindrance, Taylor confidently published an appeal for 18 new workers to join the work. When he did recover his strength, Jennie remained with the children, (including a new son, Ernest Hamilton, and a daughter Amy, as well as the orphaned daughter of fellow missionary George Duncan). In 1876 Hudson Taylor returned to China, followed by the 18 requested missionaries. Meanwhile, in England, the work of General Secretary of the China Inland Mission was done by Benjamin Broomhall, who had married Hudson&#x27;s sister, Amelia.

Hudson&#x27;s evangelical work in England profoundly affected various members of the famous cricketing Studd family, resulting in three of the brothers converting and becoming deeply religious; Charles Studd became a missionary to China along with fellow Cambridge University converts, known as the Cambridge Seven.

From 1876 to 1878 Taylor travelled throughout inland China, opening missions stations. This was made possible by the signing on 13 September 1876 of the Chefoo Convention, a settlement between Britain and China that made it possible for missionary work to take place legally in inland China. In 1878, Jennie returned to China and began working to promote female missionary service there. Their son Ernest Hamilton Taylor, who had been educated at Monkton Combe School and the Glasgow Institute of Accountants, joined them at the China Inland Mission in 1898 where he remained as a missionary for much of his working life. By 1881 there were 100 missionaries in the CIM.

Taylor returned to England in 1883 to recruit more missionaries, and he returned to China with a total of 225 missionaries and 59 churches. In 1887 their numbers increased by another 102 with The Hundred missionaries, and in 1888 Taylor brought 14 missionaries from the United States. In the U.S. he traveled and spoke at many places, including the Niagara Bible Conference where he befriended Cyrus Scofield, and Taylor filled the pulpit of Dwight L. Moody as a guest in Chicago. Moody and Scofield thereafter actively supported the work of the China Inland Mission of North America.

In 1897 Hudson&#x27;s and Maria&#x27;s only surviving daughter, Maria, died in Wenzhou, leaving four little children and her missionary husband, John Joseph Coulthard. She had been instrumental in leading many Chinese women to Christianity during her short life.

==Boxer crisis==
News of the Boxer Rebellion and the resulting disruption of missionary work in 1900 distressed Taylor, even though it led to further interest in missions in the area and additional growth of his China Inland Mission. Though the CIM suffered more than any other mission in China (58 missionaries and 21 children were killed), Taylor refused to accept payment for loss of property or life, to show the &#x27;meekness and gentleness of Christ&#x27;. He was criticized by some but was commended by the British Foreign Office, whose minister in Beijing donated £200 to the CIM, expressing his &#x27;admiration&#x27; and sympathy. The Chinese were also touched by Taylor&#x27;s attitude.

==Final years==
Because of health issues, Taylor remained in Switzerland and semi-retired with his wife. In 1900 Dixon Edward Hoste was appointed the Acting General Director of the CIM, and in 1902 Taylor formally resigned. Jennie died of cancer in 1904 in Les Chevalleyres, Switzerland, and in 1905 Taylor returned to China for the eleventh and final time. There he visited Yangzhou and Zhenjiang and other cities before he died in 1905 while reading at home in Changsha. He was buried next to his first wife, Maria, in Zhenjiang, in the small English Cemetery near the Yangtze River.

The small cemetery was built over with industrial buildings in the 1960s, and the grave markers were destroyed. However, the marker for Hudson Taylor was stored away in a local museum for years. His great-grandson, James Hudson Taylor III, found the marker and was able to help a local Chinese church erect it within their building in 1999.

His tombstone reads:


In 2013 the land for the cemetery was redeveloped, and the demolition of the old industrial buildings revealed that the Taylors&#x27; tombs were still intact. On 28 August the graves were excavated with the surrounding soil and moved to a local church where they were to be reinterred in a memorial garden. 

==Legacy==
The beginning of &quot;faith missions&quot; (the sending of missionaries with no promises of temporal support, but instead a reliance &quot;through prayer to move men by God&quot;) has had a wide impact among evangelical churches to this day. After his death, China Inland Mission gained the notable distinction of being the largest Protestant mission agency in the world. The biographies of Hudson Taylor inspired generations of Christians to follow his example of service and sacrifice. Notable examples are: missionary to India Amy Carmichael, Olympic Gold Medalist Eric Liddell, twentieth-century missionary and martyr Jim Elliot, founder of Bible Study Fellowship Audrey Wetherell Johnson, as well as international evangelists Billy Graham and Luis Palau.

Descendants of James Hudson Taylor continued his full-time ministry into the 21st century in Chinese communities in East Asia. James Hudson Taylor III (1929–2009) in Hong Kong, and his son, James Hudson Taylor IV 戴繼宗, who married Yeh Min Ke (the first Taiwanese member of the Taylor family), who is involved in full-time ministries in Taiwan. James H. Taylor V continued the family legacy by singing with a middle school choir.



Chinese tourists have started visiting his hometown of Barnsley to see where their hero grew up, and the town developed a trail to guide visitors to landmarks around the town.

== Beliefs ==
Taylor was raised in the Methodist tradition. In the course of his life he became close to the &quot;Open Brethren&quot; such as George Müller, and was a member of the Westbourne Grove Church pastored by William Garrett Lewis.

Born in Barnsley, Yorkshire, on 21 May 1832, into a pious Methodist home, the religious fervour of his parents and their prayerful interest in China implanted in their first born the seed of foreign missions. Feeble health in childhood instilled in Taylor a sense that his life was not his own; and thus, from an early age, he professed ‘a genuine desire for holiness’.

<text>Rising Tide Records was a record label started by Doug Morris, former head of Warner Music Group, and Daniel Glass, who became president.

The label had success in breaking new artists, including the multi-platinum debut of Erykah Badu, Billie Myers and Lost Boyz. Recognizing the changing landscape of the industry, Glass strategically aligned Universal with such independent record labels as Kedar Entertainment, home to Erykah Badu, and Mojo Records, home to platinum artist Reel Big Fish and the Cherry Poppin&#x27; Daddies.

In 1995, it was founded as Rising Tide Records and shortly thereafter, it was renamed Universal Records and Doug Morris was named Chairman/C.E.O. of MCA Music Entertainment Group. However, the Nashville branch stayed active until March 1998. Acts on the Nashville branch included Matraca Berg, Scotty Emerick, The Buffalo Club, Rebecca Lynn Howard, J.C. Jones, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, Delbert McClinton, Tony Toliver, Jack Ingram, Dolly Parton, Kris Tyler and Keith Sewell.

<doc id="1184459" wikidata="Q6615319" url="?curid=1184459" title="List of current members of the Maryland Senate">
<text>The Maryland Senate is the upper house of the Maryland General Assembly, the state legislature of the U.S. State of Maryland. One Senator is elected from each of the state&#x27;s 47 electoral districts. As of January 2023, 34 of those seats are held by Democrats and 13 by Republicans. The leader of the Senate is known as the President, a position currently held by Bill Ferguson, who represents Baltimore. In addition, senators elect a President Pro Tempore, and the respective party caucuses elect a majority and minority leader and a majority and minority whip.

Senators are elected in even-numbered years when the President of the United States is not being elected, similar to most other state offices in Maryland. The most recent election was in November 2022. Senators are not term-limited. Should a Senator resign from office before his or her term expires, the local central committee of the party to which the retiring senator belonged makes a recommendation to the Governor for whom to appoint to the open seat. It is tradition for the Governor to appoint the recommended person. Nine of the current members of the Maryland State Senate were originally appointed, all of whom have since been elected in their own right. Newly elected senators are sworn in and begin work on the second Wednesday of the January following their election.

Each Senator has at least one standing committee assignment. The first is to one of the four legislative committees: Budget and Taxation; Education, Health, and Environmental Affairs (listed in this table as Education, Health, and Environment); Finance; or Judicial Proceedings. A number of senators have secondary committee assignments, most prominently to the Executive Nominations Committee, which oversees the constitutional responsibility of the Senate to approve nominations by the Governor. Assignment to the Rules or Executive Nominations committees or to any Ad Hoc committees is not noted.

==Current party composition==
Composition as of the beginning of the 2019–2022 term on January 9, 2019:
During the 2015–2018 term, the State Senate was made up of 33 Democrats and 14 Republicans. Republicans gained two seats (District 38 in Worcester, Wicomico and Somerset counties and District 42 in Baltimore County), while losing one seat (District 9 in Howard and Carroll counties) in the elections held on November 6, 2018. Democrats maintain a super-majority in the chamber. Article II, Section 17(a) of the Maryland Constitution specifies it takes a three-fifths vote of both chambers to override a veto, which is 29 votes in the State Senate. The rules of the Senate also permit members to limit debate by a three-fifths majority vote, meaning Republicans would need to gain four additional seats, for a total of 19, in order to sustain a veto or filibuster legislation.

==Current leadership==
The below table reflects the current leadership of the Maryland State Senate as of October 4, 2021.
==Current state senators==
==Notes==
 This Senator was originally appointed to office by the Governor to fill an open seat.

 The President of the Senate does not serve on any of the four standing legislative committees. He does, however, serve on both the Executive Nominations and the Rules Committees.

<doc id="1184466" wikidata="Q1383283" url="?curid=1184466" title="Herbert Mullin">
<text>Herbert William Mullin (April 18, 1947 – August 18, 2022) was an American serial killer who killed 13 people in California in the early 1970s. He confessed to the killings, which he claimed prevented earthquakes. In 1973, after a trial to determine whether he was legally insane or culpable, he was convicted of two murders in the first-degree and nine in the second-degree and sentenced to life imprisonment. During his imprisonment, he was denied parole eight times.

Mullin and Edmund Kemper overlapped in their 1972 to 1973 murder sprees, adding confusion to the police investigations and ending with both being arrested within a few weeks of each other after the deaths of 21 people.

==Early life, education, and mental health issues==
Herbert William Mullin was born on April 18, 1947, in Salinas, California. His father was reportedly stern but not abusive. Not long before Mullin&#x27;s fifth birthday, the family moved to San Francisco.

Mullin had numerous friends at school and was voted &quot;Most Likely to Succeed&quot; when he was 16 by his classmates at San Lorenzo Valley High School, yet he also experienced difficulties at this time, largely due to paranoid schizophrenic disorder. Shortly after they graduated from San Lorenzo Valley High School in 1965, one of Mullin&#x27;s friends, Dean Richardson, was killed in a car accident, devastating Mullin. He built &quot;shrines&quot; to Richardson in his room and became obsessed with the idea of reincarnation.

In 1969, Mullin was admitted to Mendocino State Hospital. Over the next few years, he entered various mental hospitals but was discharged after spells as being no harm to himself or others. In total, he was committed to five mental hospitals. By the time he was in his mid-twenties, he had a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia, accelerated by his usage of LSD and cannabis.

==Murders==

By 1972, Mullin was 25 and had moved back in with his parents in Felton, California, in the Santa Cruz Mountains. His birthday, April 18, was the anniversary of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, which he thought was very significant.

Mullin believed that the Vietnam War had produced enough American deaths to forestall earthquakes as a blood sacrifice to nature, but that with the war winding down by late 1972 (from an American perspective), he would need to start killing people in order to have enough deaths to keep a calamitous earthquake away. It was for this reason, he later said, that his father, through telepathy, had ordered him to take lives.

On October 13, 1972, Mullin beat 55-year-old vagrant Lawrence &quot;Whitey&quot; White&#x27;s head with a baseball bat when the transient looked at the engine of his 1958 Chevy station wagon after Mullin had pretended to have car trouble and pulled over, opening the hood. White had offered to help fix his car in exchange for a ride. Mullin dragged White&#x27;s body into the woods, where it was found the next day. He later claimed his victim looked like Jonah from the Bible and sent him telepathic messages: &quot;Hey, man, pick me up and throw me over the boat. Kill me so that others will be saved.&quot;

Mullin soon set out to commit a second murder with the intent to both test his hypothesis that the environment was being rapidly polluted and to follow a command hallucination of his father&#x27;s voice directing him to make another sacrifice. On October 24, 1972, Mullin encountered Mary Margaret Guilfoyle, a student from Cabrillo College who was running late for an appointment. He offered Guilfoyle a lift and stabbed her in the chest while driving. He later disemboweled Guilfoyle&#x27;s corpse to examine her organs for evidence supporting his ideas on pollution. Guilfoyle&#x27;s body was located in February 1973, several months after her murder.

Shortly thereafter, Mullin began having doubts about the hallucinatory instructions he believed were from his father. This uncertainty led Mullin to attend St. Mary&#x27;s Catholic Church in Los Gatos on November 2, 1972, with the aim of confessing. While in custody in 1973, Mullin alleged that the priest he spoke to in the confessional, Father Henri Tomei, volunteered to be his next sacrifice, which led Mullin to hit, kick, and stab Tomei to death on the spot before fleeing.

Around January 1973, Mullin applied to join the United States Marine Corps in an attempt to legally conduct what he perceived as his mission but was barred entry when he refused to sign his criminal record.

By the start of 1973, Mullin had stopped taking drugs completely and began blaming the faults in his life on his previous substance use.
He decided to locate Jim Gianera, his former friend from high school who first introduced him to cannabis, and whom Mullin subsequently perceived as the originator of Mullin&#x27;s eventual heavy drug use. In early January 1973, Mullin drove to a remote area of Santa Cruz, recalling Gianera had lived there. The resident of the first house Mullin approached was a woman named Kathleen &quot;Kathy&quot; Francis, a close friend of Jim Gianera and his wife Joan; Francis directed Mullin to Gianera&#x27;s actual inhabitance (a cabin further down the same road). Mullin proceeded to Gianera&#x27;s home, where he demanded to know why Gianera offered him the early taste of cannabis that Mullin alleged ruined his life. Mullin decided that the former friend&#x27;s answer was unsatisfactory and shot him. Dying, the man crawled to his bathroom in an attempt to tell his wife to lock the bathroom door, but Mullin broke down the door and fatally shot her too. Mullin then returned to the home of Kathy Francis and shot her and her two children, four-year-old Daemon Francis and nine-year-old David Hughes, to death, then stabbed each victim multiple times after death. The police thought that the deaths in both homes were drug-related and did not suspect they were in any way connected with the priest&#x27;s death or the previous murders of hitchhikers.

About a month later, on February 10, 1973, Mullin was hiking in the state park in Santa Cruz, where he encountered four teenage boys (Robert Spector, aged 18, Brian Scott Card, 19, David Oliker, 18, and Mark Dreibelbis, 15) camping illegally. He walked over to them, engaged them in a brief conversation, and claimed to be a park ranger. He told them to leave because they were, according to Mullin, &quot;polluting&quot; the forest. However, they shooed him away and stayed in the tent. The next day, Mullin returned and shot all four of them in the head with his .22 caliber pistol, killing them. When he had finished, he took their .22 caliber rifle and 20 dollars.

The next killing happened before the bodies of Mullin&#x27;s previous victims were found later that week. It occurred as Mullin was driving firewood in his station wagon. He noticed his victim, a 72-year-old retired prizefighter and fishmonger named Fred Abbie Perez, working in his garden in Santa Cruz. Mullin did a U-turn, came back down the street, stopped, put the rifle across the hood of his car, and shot Perez once in the heart. He committed this killing in full sight of the dead man&#x27;s neighbor, who got Mullin&#x27;s license plate. A few minutes after the description was broadcast on the police radio, a &quot;docile&quot; Mullin was ordered to pull over and was arrested by a patrolman. Seated next to him was the .22 caliber pistol used to kill the people in the cabins, which he did not attempt to use during his apprehension.

The police failed to recognize a pattern at the time of Mullin&#x27;s murders due to several factors: firstly, the murders did not appear to be connected by a similar weapon or modus operandi; secondly, the victims differed from each other in terms of age, race, and sex; and finally, Edmund Kemper, who would kill the last of his own eight victims just a few weeks later, was operating in approximately the same area at the same time.

Mullin had committed his murder spree over four months.

== Trial and imprisonment ==

The Santa Cruz County District Attorney&#x27;s Office charged Mullin with ten murders, and Mullin&#x27;s trial opened on July 30, 1973. Mullin had admitted to all the crimes; therefore, the trial focused on whether he was legally sane (which, under U.S. law, means that he understood the nature and quality of his actions and understood right from wrong). The fact that he had covered his tracks and shown premeditation in some of his crimes was highlighted by prosecutor Chris Cottle, while the defense (public defender Jim Jackson) argued that Mullin&#x27;s delusions made him kill. On August 19, 1973, after fourteen hours of deliberation, Mullin was found guilty of first-degree murder in the killings of Jim Gianera and Kathy Francis — because they were deemed premeditated — and eight counts of second degree murder in the other killings — because they were considered &quot;impulse&quot; by the jury. Mullin was convicted of the ten murders at the age of 26.

The Santa Clara County District Attorney&#x27;s Office charged Mullin for the murder of Henri Tomei. On December 11, 1973, the day his trial was to begin, he pled guilty to second-degree murder after originally pleading not guilty by reason of insanity to first-degree murder. He was sentenced to life imprisonment in the Santa Cruz County trial and was denied parole eight times from 1980 on. He was incarcerated at Mule Creek State Prison, in Ione, California.

While in custody, Mullin said he committed his crimes only in an attempt to save the environment. He was diagnosed by Dr. David Marlowe from the University of California at Santa Cruz with schizophrenic reaction, paranoid type.

Mullin had interactions with Edmund Kemper, another serial killer active in the same area and at the same time as him. The two shared adjoining cells at one point. Kemper disliked Mullin, saying he killed for no good reason. Kemper recalled, &quot;Well, [Mullin] had a habit of singing and bothering people when somebody tried to watch TV. So I threw water on him to shut him up. Then, when he was a good boy, I&#x27;d give him some peanuts. Herbie liked peanuts. That was effective because pretty soon he asked permission to sing. That&#x27;s called behavior modification treatment.&quot;

Kemper described Mullin as having a &quot;lot of pain inside, he had a lot of anguish inside, he had a lot of hate inside, and it was addressed to people he didn&#x27;t even know because he didn&#x27;t dare do anything to the people he knew.&quot; In that same interview, Kemper called Mullin &quot;a kindred spirit there&quot; due to their similar past of being institutionalized. Kemper said he told Mullin, &quot;Herbie, I know what happened. Don&#x27;t give me that bullshit about earthquakes and don&#x27;t give me that crap about God was telling you. I says you couldn&#x27;t even be talking to me now if God talking to you because of the pressure I&#x27;m putting on you right now, these little shocking insights into what you did, God would start talking to you right now if you were that kind of ill. Because I grew up with people like that.&quot;

== Death ==

On August 18, 2022, Mullin died at age 75 from natural causes while housed at the California Health Care Facility.

<doc id="1184467" wikidata="Q1074758" url="?curid=1184467" title="Chiron Corporation">
<text>Chiron Corporation ( ) was an American multinational biotechnology firm founded in 1981, based in Emeryville, California, that was acquired by Novartis on April 20, 2006. It had offices and facilities in eighteen countries on five continents. Chiron&#x27;s business and research was in three main areas: biopharmaceuticals, vaccines, and blood testing. Chiron&#x27;s vaccines and blood testing units were combined to form Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics, while Chiron BioPharmaceuticals was integrated into Novartis Pharmaceuticals. In 2014, Novartis completed the sale of its blood transfusion diagnostics unit to Grifols and announced agreements for the sale of its vaccines unit to GlaxoSmithKline.

==Early history ==

Chiron was founded in 1981 by chairman, William J. Rutter, president and chief executive, Professor Edward Penhoet, and vice president for research, Pablo DT Valenzuela. All were academics from the University of California; Penhoet at Berkeley, where he continued to lecture, and the others from San Francisco.
Chiron formed a partnership with the Swiss pharmaceutical giant, Ciba-Geigy Ltd., through the Biocine Company, to use genetic engineering to develop vaccines and to treat, prevent and diagnose diseases such as AIDS, herpes and malaria. Other partnerships included Thicon Inc. to develop a growth factor hormone for the treatment of wounds and Merck &amp; Co to develop an improvement to their existing hepatitis B vaccine.
In 1986, Professor Penhoet said: &quot;Our business strategy is to dominate small markets rather than take a small presence in a broad market.&quot; The niche that Chiron was focusing on was ophthalmology, which Mr. Penhoet said was &quot;big enough to be interesting, but small enough to service with 40 salespeople.&quot; Professor Penhoet also stated that Chiron was set up to provide the enabling technology for others to use under license, and later saying that Chiron was &quot;as close to a virtual corporation as you can be&quot;, with few fixed assets but more relationships.

From 1982–1988, intense successive molecular biology studies at the Chiron Emeryville research labs had been undertaken for the treatment of hepatitis. In 1987, Rutter and his research team at Emeryville produced the first commercial genetically engineered vaccine against hepatitis B. Two years later, in 1989, Dr. Michael Houghton, Dr. Qui-Lim Choo, and Dr. George Kuo, in collaboration with Dr. Daniel W. Bradley at the CDC, finally identified the genome of the viral agent responsible for 80 to 90% of non-A and non-B post-transfusion hepatitis—the agent called &quot;hepatitis C virus&quot;. For this ground breaking discovery, Michael Houghton was one of the winners of the 2020 Nobel Prize in Medicine.

==Expansion==

In 1988, Chiron formed a joint venture company, called Mimesys Inc., with Johnson &amp; Johnson and the Warner-Lambert Company, to develop the next generation of biotech drugs. The following year Chiron recruited Gregory Lawless, who had come from DuPont, to take over as president and CEO. This led to additional buying that included the acquisition of Du Pont in partnership with Ortho Diagnostic Systems; Munich based Adatomed GmbH; and a merger with fellow biotech company Cetus Corporation after Cetus failed to get approval for its drug Interleukin-2. Hollings Renton of Cetus became president and CEO when Gregory Lawless agreed to leave. Mr Renton resigned in 1992 and was replaced by Sean Lance, from Glaxo Wellcome in 1998, and finally by Howard Pien from GlaxoSmithKline in 2003.
After the acquisition of Cetus, Chiron split its operations among five entities: Cetus Oncology, for cancer drugs; the Biocine Company, for vaccines; Chiron Diagnostics, for blood screening and other diagnostic tests (later sold to Bayer AG for $1.1 billion); Chiron Intraoptics, for eye surgery, and Chiron Technologies, for research and development.

==Products and other acquisitions==
In 1992, the company&#x27;s first product, Proleukin, was approved in United States for the treatment of metastatic melanoma; previously it was only approved for use with kidney cancer. This was followed a year later by Betaseron, a beta interferon, the first treatment for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and made by Berlex Laboratories Inc. 
In 1997 Chiron provided the active ingredient, becaplermin, in Regranex, a topical treatment for diabetic foot ulcers, manufactured by Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical Inc. In 2001, Chiron acquired PathoGenesis for its antibiotic drug Tobi, the first inhaled antibiotic approved for treating lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients.
Having launched its first vaccine product, Fluad, an adjuvant influenza vaccine, in 1996, the vaccine line was expanded significantly in 1998 with the acquisition of the European vaccine businesses of Behring (Germany) and Sclavo (Italy). This was followed in 2003 by the acquisition of PowderJect, the UK-based vaccines company, making Chiron the second-largest flu vaccines provider and the fifth-largest vaccines business in the world.
In 1998, Chiron&#x27;s nucleic acid testing (NAT) blood-testing business was launched in cooperation with Gen-Probe, followed a year later by the launch of the Procleix system, which detects viral RNA and DNA in donated blood and plasma during the very early stages of infection, when those infectious agents are present but cannot be detected by immunodiagnostic tests.
Chiron expanded its cancer drug portfolio in 2002 with the acquisition of Matrix Pharmaceuticals Inc and its product tezacitabine. 
Chiron also manufactured the MMR vaccine (measles mumps and rubella) at its Liverpool plant. Chiron in conjunction with Crucell (now part of Johnson &amp; Johnson) developed a pentavalent vaccine called Quinvaxem targeting 5 diseases in children.

==Lawsuits==

When in 1991 Cetus was acquired it was subject to a lawsuit by the Eastman Kodak Company over the rights to the polymerase chain reaction product, which was settled in 1993.
In 1998, Chiron filed patent infringement suits in Europe, Japan and the US against Roche over its hepatitis C (HCV) products. Chiron was the first to clone HCV in 1989 after six years of research and had since filed over 100 HCV related patents in over 20 countries. A settlement was reached where Roche Holding A.G. agreed to buy the global semi-exclusive nucleic acid test (NAT) patents for HCV and HIV from Chiron.
Bayer, the company which bought Chiron Diagnostics, sued Chiron Corporation in 2002 citing that it hid patent and equipment problems from them during purchase negotiations. The case filed in Delaware alleged breach of warranty, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, violation of the duty of good faith and fair dealing and breach of contract claims in connection with the acquisition.

In 2004, Chiron attracted adverse media coverage after the UK government suspended its license for manufacturing Fluvirin, an influenza vaccine, at its plant in Liverpool, England due to contamination concerns. This action left the United States government short of the vaccine. In August, it was announced that 4 million doses of the vaccine were potentially contaminated with Serratia marcescens. It later emerged that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may have been aware of the problem nine months earlier, but a miscommunication between the company and the FDA left the problem unsolved until the MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency), the British equivalent of the FDA stepped in and suspended Chiron&#x27;s license. The company undertook a remediation program and succeeded in restoring the manufacturing license from MHRA in 2005. However, the incident resulted in a class action lawsuit for nearly $280m being brought against Chiron and its executives for allegedly, in 2003, overstating its ability to manufacture and ship the vaccine Fluvirin, thus allowing Novartis to buy Chiron shares below market value when the plant temporarily closed down. The amount settled in 2008 was for $30m.

==Bombings==

On August 27 of 2003, two bombs exploded at Chiron&#x27;s headquarters in Emeryville, California. A group calling itself Revolutionary Cells e-mailed a statement to reporters taking credit for the bombing and claimed that their action was due to Chiron&#x27;s past contracts with Huntingdon Life Sciences, a contract research firm that conducts experiments on animals. The FBI has named Daniel Andreas San Diego as the lead suspect and placed him on its FBI Most Wanted Terrorists list.

==The end of Chiron==

Novartis Corporation was the result of a merger between Sandoz Laboratories and Ciba-Geigy in 1996 and owned slightly less than half of Chiron as part of a Federal Trade Commission order. Several of Sandoz’s subsidiaries were sold off for reasons of anti monopoly legislation. 
In 2005, Novartis made an offer to buy Chiron. Initially this offer was rebuffed, but after the bid was substantially enhanced, Chiron was sold, and became part of Novartis in April, 2006.
A year later, parts of ex-Chiron were sold in part and leased in part to Bayer. In 2011 Bayer announced it was withdrawing from a manufacturing plant it had leased from Novartis. and Novartis finally divested most of the former Chiron assets in 2013 as part of a global reorganization.

<doc id="1184470" wikidata="Q27925291" url="?curid=1184470" title="Nemi (comic strip)">
<text>Nemi () is a Norwegian comic strip, written and drawn by Lise Myhre. It made its first appearance in 1997 under the title &quot;Den svarte siden&quot; (&quot;the Black Side&quot; or &quot;the Black Page&quot;). At that time, it was a tonally dark cartoon concerning heavy metal subcultures. Over the years, Myhre made the comic generally brighter and more comedic, though still frequently published with strips about serious issues, especially in the larger Saturday panels. The strip was renamed &quot;Nemi&quot; after its protagonist, a young goth woman.

Myhre has also illustrated poems by Edgar Allan Poe and André Bjerke in the strip.

== Publication ==

=== Newspapers ===
In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the strip was, until 8 January 2016, printed daily in the &quot;Metro&quot; newspaper, after translation into English; background images, and magazines the characters are reading often remain clearly in Norwegian. Originally Nemi was published in monthly extreme music magazine &quot;Terrorizer&quot; before it lost the UK rights due to the syndication deal with &quot;Metro&quot;. In Norway, Sweden, Finland and Denmark the strip runs in several local daily newspapers.

=== Comic books and albums ===
The strip has its own monthly comic book in Norway and Sweden, with similar (but not identical) content. The Norwegian comic book has introduced several upcoming Norwegian comic artists, and also run foreign comics including &quot;Lenore&quot; by Roman Dirge, &quot;Em&quot; by Maria Smedstad, &quot;Liberty Meadows&quot; by Frank Cho, &quot;WayLay&quot; by Carol Lay, EC Comics horror classics, &quot;Sinfest&quot; by Tatsuya Ishida and &quot;Fables&quot; by Bill Willingham.

An album series collecting the strips chronologically has been published in Norway, Sweden and Finland. Apart from Norway, books are published in Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Spain, Italy, France and the United Kingdom.

==Main characters==

===Nemi Montoya===
A goth woman 20 years of age, Nemi almost always wears black clothes (although she does very rarely wear red scarves and gloves, and has a red bath towel), has very pale skin and long black hair, and very little in common with most of the rest of the world. She shares her name with a lake in Italy, Lake Nemi, though this was not known by the author when the character was created, and her surname from Inigo Montoya, a character in Lise Myhre&#x27;s favourite film, &quot;The Princess Bride&quot;. It underlines Nemi&#x27;s &quot;outsider&quot; status within Norwegian society and suggests that she may not be naturally raven-haired. This is confirmed in one cartoon where a childhood friend fails to recognise her without her &quot;blond curls&quot;—implying her hair is not only dyed but also straightened; however, the several comics showing Nemi as a black-haired child with her long hair in bunches also possibly suggest that she may have at least once tried to fit in with normal society. She has a black dragon tattoo on her left shoulder.

====Character====
Nemi is a &quot;tough girl&quot; with an attitude, not afraid to speak her mind and more often than not in confrontational ways: blunt rejections of would-be one-night stands at the pub are not uncommon. At the same time, she can be very sensitive: a devoted animal activist, she is against killing anything, including spiders, of which she is very fond. Nemi is nominally vegetarian, though she will occasionally indulge in seafood; her true passion is for chocolate and Coca-Cola, and she finds fault with people who prefer Pepsi over Coke. She can also feel very alone at times. She is afraid of growing up, and loathes blonde bimbos (&quot;vide&quot; a cartoon in which she insinuates that Tim is nothing more than a replaceable penis for his new blonde-bimbo girlfriend). Her fear of growing up is reflected in her appeal to readers through her childlike qualities and innocence, as well as her sense of fun.

Nemi has great difficulty keeping down a job due to her inability to sleep at a decent hour and wake up in the morning; her most steady form of employment is babysitting for her responsible and grown-up friends. Not surprisingly, childlike Nemi gets along very well with children but her dark sense of humour and grim fairy tales often traumatize them (although, it is more common that the parents are traumatized when hearing what the children have been allowed to read). Occasionally, she works in music stores at the counter but usually is fired pretty quickly after various altercations with customers over the corrupt morals of popular stars. In &quot;Nemi III&quot;, it&#x27;s revealed that Nemi grew up fairly poor and was bullied at school; this is where she gets most of her cynical and insecure traits from that would hinder her in adult life. Growing up poor also affected her ability to manage money as an adult, as she would rather spend her money than save it or pay her bills.

====Lifestyle====
She listens to heavy metal music, and has a number of friends in those subcultures who dress similarly. She is often unemployed or employed in temporary jobs, where she often gets fired for her temper (such as beating a customer who asked for a CD of Christina Aguilera for her daughter, instead of the Alice Cooper CD Nemi had suggested).

She is fond of holidays in warmer countries, but when at the beach she uses top-grade sunblock cream to avoid tanning, which would severely damage her carefully cultivated surface image. Nemi suffers from strong allergic reactions and has advocated exterminating birch trees, on the grounds that &quot;we kill off thousands of species every day anyway&quot;.

She likes to visit the pub, often with her friend Cyan, where she often gets drunk. Alcoholism is however not a main theme of the comic. However, as a consequence Nemi has a lot of casual sex, and often wakes up beside complete strangers. In spring 2011, she became enamoured with a beefcake boyfriend whom she converted to vegetarianism with a single look. Her boyfriend, Grimm, is now a huge part of Nemi&#x27;s life and the two are regularly featured together in the (UK) strip, sharing and discussing off-beat topics. The strips in which they appear can be said to mirror the strips that only feature Cyan and Leo.

Nemi&#x27;s room in the apartment is almost always a mess, and she has an uncontrollable passion for chocolate.

====Politics====
Nemi does not state a clear political preference, but is opposed to George W. Bush, Norwegian whale hunting and hunting in general, fur, smoking restrictions (although depictions of her smoking have declined dramatically in recent years), the Norwegian agrarian party Senterpartiet and in general the Establishment. The animal rights content is mostly passive resistance (in one cartoon Nemi disrupts a moose hunt by singing loudly to scare the moose away), but other cartoons appear to rather simplistically condone violence against scientists conducting research on animals, e.g. one in which Nemi tries to teach a laboratory mouse how to swing a baseball bat (though this could be seen as very much a child&#x27;s way of thinking of the subject). In another cartoon Nemi berates a boyfriend for disagreeing with her on this issue, the punchline being that he is apparently not fit to be regarded as a human for doing so. Nemi is also a pescetarian.

====Culture====
Nemi&#x27;s heroes are Edgar Allan Poe, H. P. Lovecraft, André Bjerke, J. R. R. Tolkien, Alice Cooper, W.A.S.P., The Phantom Blot, Darth Vader and Batman. She also has a passion for dragons, and hates reality shows such as Big Brother, with the exception of Extreme Makeover: Home Edition. She regards &quot;modern art&quot; as simply a manifestation of insecurity by would-be intellectuals, who secretly know they have nothing original to say (&quot;vide&quot; a cartoon in which Nemi visits a modern art exhibition with Cyan and Tim). Nemi has vehement opinions about the arts, especially music, and an enthusiastic willingness to destroy art she deems unworthy, as when she asks a bartender to lend her a CD by The Corrs, presumably to burn herself a copy of it, and then sets it on fire instead. She adores, among others, Dimmu Borgir, Laibach, Opeth, The Cure, Tori Amos, The Sisters of Mercy, Red Harvest, Nicole Blackman, Lamented Souls, Use Me, Warrior Soul, Metallica, Darkthrone, Slayer, and Alice Cooper (as mentioned above). She once met the &quot;Showman&quot; Alice Cooper character from &quot;The Last Temptation&quot;.

===Other characters===
Cyan is Nemi&#x27;s best friend. She has cyan hair worn in bunches, and a lot of worries (apparently being especially afraid of spiders and death; &quot;vide&quot; the recurring nightmare cartoon). She usually functions as Nemi&#x27;s conscience and reality anchor, or the other way around: the two basically take turns playing the Straight man or comic foil for each other. Cyan works a nine-to-five shift in an office in a mid-level but low-paying position and often brings her work home with her; she spends much time planning her future and struggling to be a responsible adult, much to Nemi&#x27;s disdain. She had a one-night stand in Prague and gave birth to a girl in 2017.

Grimm enters Nemi&#x27;s life early in 2012 (British strip) and is now Nemi&#x27;s live-in boyfriend who shares some of her goth ideas but is down-to-earth and sensible, and endeavours to return Nemi to the real world when she strays too far. A fireman, he is a muscular giant of a man compared to Nemi and Cyan (bearing a strong resemblance to Peter Steele), but gentle and non-abusive. He is also instrumental in steering Nemi away from chocolate when he can; however, he does indulge some other fantasies. He comes across in current strips as a caring cohabitant unlikely to stray (Jan 2013).

Ophelia is another friend of Nemi and Cyan. She is an artist, and usually miserable. She is overweight, has long grey hair and wears a long brown dress.

Tim used to be Cyan&#x27;s boyfriend. A punk-metal fan with a green mohawk, he plays in a mediocre band, and has no permanent job but financially relied on Cyan and lived with her rent-free for quite some time. Tim and Cyan had a pretty bad relationship (&quot;e.g.&quot; him suggesting their sex life was boring, prompting Cyan to put him in the hospital with a black eye and a broken arm) until eventually he dumped her for a blonde. Subsequently, his presence in the strip was sharply reduced to make way for Leo, Cyan&#x27;s new boyfriend.

Leo was Cyan&#x27;s boyfriend, a much more responsible alternative to Tim, and works in advertising. Cyan and Leo formerly live together and have what Cyan refers to as a &quot;grown-up and committed&quot; relationship (which means they own a wide-screen plasma television together). Unfortunately their relationship ended in 2015.

Nemi&#x27;s Dad is one of the main influences on Nemi&#x27;s life as it is. He&#x27;s a goth who hides his face behind a shiny black &quot;Ozzy Osbourne&quot; hairstyle and is partial to Wumpscut and reading comics (much like Nemi). He and Nemi&#x27;s mother divorced at some point and he later remarried, much to Nemi&#x27;s disdain. However Nemi&#x27;s dad and Evilina have long since divorced. Nemi&#x27;s dad is currently in a same-sex relationship. He often makes Nemi feel like a little girl.

Evilina is Nemi&#x27;s dad&#x27;s second ex-wife, a stereotypical stepmother from hell with a very snobby attitude, plenty of money, and a standard for hygiene and cleanliness. Evilina wears fur (which Nemi objects to) and speaks in a loathing icy tone most of the time; she seems to enjoy pointing out the flaws in Nemi&#x27;s life and leaves the usually outspoken Nemi too insecure to speak back.

The cartoon also features a large number of friends, family, short-term boyfriends, and Goths.

==Nemi in the United States==
The Nemi books are available for sale in the United States, one of which has the foreword by Tori Amos.

In episode 3 of the US TV series &quot;Defying Gravity&quot;, the character of Steve Wassenfelder is seen having a Nemi cover hanging on his wall.

==Soundtrack==
A soundtrack was released by Nocturnal Art Productions in 2001 and a screensaver was included on the soundtrack.

<text>The Air Force Office of Special Investigations (OSI or AFOSI) is a U.S. federal law enforcement agency that reports directly to the Secretary of the Air Force. OSI is also a U.S. Air Force field operating agency under the administrative guidance and oversight of the Inspector General of the Department of the Air Force. By federal statute, OSI provides independent criminal investigative, counterintelligence and protective service operations worldwide and outside of the traditional military chain of command. Proactively, OSI identifies, investigates, and neutralizes serious criminal, terrorist, and espionage threats to personnel and resources of the Air Force, Space Force, and the U.S. Department of Defense, thereby protecting the national security of the United States.

==Overview==
The Office of Special Investigations capabilities:
* Protect critical technologies and information
* Detect and mitigate threats 
* Provide global specialized services
* Conduct major criminal investigations 
* Engage foreign adversaries and threats offensively

OSI&#x27;s Cornerstone is to vigorously solve crime, protect secrets, warn of threats, exploit intelligence opportunities, and operate in cyber. OSI investigates a wide variety of serious offenses – espionage, terrorism, crimes against property, violence against people, larceny, computer hacking, acquisition fraud, drug use and distribution, financial misdeeds, military desertion, corruption of the contracting process, and any other illegal activity that undermines the mission of the Air Force, Space Force, or the DoD.

As of 2007, OSI had 2,900 employees. After pilot training, OSI remains the second-most requested career choice in the Air Force for officers.

==History==
The Office of Special Investigations was founded in 1948 at the suggestion of Congress to consolidate investigative activities in the Air Force. Secretary of the Air Force Stuart Symington created OSI as a Field Operating Agency and patterned it after the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). He appointed Special Agent Joseph Francis Carroll, a senior FBI official and assistant to FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, as the first Commander of OSI and charged him with providing independent, unbiased and centrally directed investigations of criminal activity in the Air Force. Carroll later became the first Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency.

The Office of Special Investigations was officially established by Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force Carl Spaatz General Order No.1 of 2 January 1948. This same Order had appointed Joseph Francis Carroll as OSI commander. The official letter of Carl Spaatz of 9 April 1948 set forth the functions and responsibilities of the Office of Special Investigations, which were &quot;to provide a competent, centrally directed special investigations service to all Air Force activities&quot;, including the investigation of such major offenses as &quot;fraud and/or conspiracy, arson, black-market operations, bribery, burglary, embezzlement, forgery, larceny, perjury, robbery, smuggling, and similar offenses ... and other major violations of the Articles of War, Federal Statute, and/or other pertinent directives&quot;.

A new Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force Hoyt Vandenberg signed the General Order No.29 of 15 July 1948 that empowered the Office of Special Investigations to carry out the counterintelligence activity including the detection of espionage, sabotage, treason, sedition, subversion, disloyalty, and disaffection. Also it was specifically stated that OSI would be responsible for all investigations formerly performed by the USAF Counterintelligence Corps.

1 August 1948 is considered the operational date of the Office of Special Investigations.

==Organization==
Under the leadership of Brigadier General Francis Dillon, the command underwent a massive reorganization which transformed the agency from a geographically based organization with District field offices to one primarily realigned as Regions based on the needs of the Air Force&#x27;s major commands. 

The reorganization effort began in September 1991 by restructuring OSI headquarters. In mid-July 1992, a special order was issued, which authorized the deactivation of district offices and subordinate detachments, while simultaneously activated the field investigations region headquarters and subordinate detachments that exist today. 

Those changes were official October 1, 1992, and on that date, OSI was also reorganized from an organization with 16 district offices to an organization with 7 field investigations regions. In addition to the AFOSI headquarters at Quantico, VA, OSI has seven field investigations regions aligned with Air Force major commands and the Unified combatant commands

* Region 1 with Air Force Materiel Command, Air Force Special Operations Command, Air Force Reserve Command
* Region 2 with Air Combat Command, United States Central Command, United States Southern Command, United States Strategic Command, 12th Air Force, 16th Air Force
* Region 3 with Air Mobility Command, United States Transportation Command, United States Special Operations Command, United States Central Command, Air Force District of Washington, Pentagon Force Protection Agency
* Region 4 with Air Education and Training Command, 2nd Air Force, 19th Air Force, Air University
* Region 5 with United States Air Forces in Europe – Air Forces Africa, United States Africa Command, United States European Command, 3rd Air Force
* Region 6 with Pacific Air Forces, United States Indo-Pacific Command, Special Operations Command Pacific, 5th Air Force, 7th Air Force, 11th Air Force
* Region 8 with United States Space Force, Air Force Global Strike Command, United States Northern Command, 8th Air Force, 14th Air Force, 20th Air Force, United States Air Force Academy

The single region not aligned with a major command is Region 7, the mission of which is to provide counterintelligence and security-program management for special-access programs under the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force. 

In addition, OSI has several specialized investigative, training, or supporting units:

*Office of Special Projects (PJ)
*Office of Procurement Fraud (PF)
*Force Support Squadron (FSS)
*U.S. Air Force Special Investigations Academy (USAFSIA)
*Investigations, Collections, Operations Nexus (ICON) Center

AFOSI is the designated executive agency for the Department of Defense Cyber Crime Center.

While the regions serve the investigative needs of those aligned major commands, all AFOSI units and personnel remain independent of those commands. In the OSI chains of command each region is directly under the OSI headquarters. Such organizational independence is intended to ensure unbiased investigations.

At the regional level are subordinate units called field investigations squadrons, detachments, and operating locations. There are more than 255 AFOSI units worldwide including, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Iraq and other Middle East locations.

Antiterrorism Specialty Team (AST) members have played a key role in Operations ALLIED FORCE, ENDURING FREEDOM and IRAQI FREEDOM. The first female OSI agent to deploy in a combat zone was a member of the AST, and currently several AST and other OSI agents continue to provide CI support for any ongoing operations.

==Operations==
Threat detection

OSI manages offensive and defensive activities to detect, counter and destroy the effectiveness of hostile intelligence services and terrorist groups that target the Air Force and Space Force. These efforts include investigating the crimes of espionage, terrorism, technology transfer and computer infiltration. This mission aspect also includes providing personal protection to senior Air Force and Space Force leaders and other officials, as well as supervising an extensive antiterrorism program in geographic areas of heightened terrorist activity.

Criminal investigations

The vast majority of OSI&#x27;s investigative activities pertain to felony crimes including murder, robbery, rape, assault, major burglaries, drug use and trafficking, sex offenses, arson, black market activities, and other serious criminal activities. In January 2014, while investigating synthetic drugs abuse, OSI uncovered the facts of cheating on monthly proficiency exams at the 341st Missile Wing at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana involving 79 officers.

Economic crime investigations

A significant amount of OSI investigative resources are assigned to fraud (or economic crime) investigations. These include violations of the public trust involving Air Force and Space Force contracting matters, appropriated and nonappropriated funds activities, computer systems, pay and allowance matters, environmental matters, acquiring and disposing of Air Force and Space Force property, and major administrative irregularities. OSI uses fraud surveys to determine the existence, location and extent of fraud in Air Force and Space Force operations or programs. It also provides briefings to base and command-level resource managers to help identify and prevent fraud involving Air Force, Space Force, or Department of Defense (DoD) resources.
Information operations

The Air Force and Space Force is now countering a global security threat to information systems. OSI&#x27;s role in support of Information Operations recognizes future threats to the Air Force and Space Force, and its response to these threats will occur in cyberspace. OSI&#x27;s support to information operations comes in many forms. OSI&#x27;s computer crime investigators provide rapid worldwide response to intrusions into Air Force and Space Force systems.

Technology protection

The desires of potential adversaries to acquire or mimic the technological advances of the Air Force and Space Force have heightened the need to protect critical Air Force and Space Force technologies and collateral data. The OSI Research and Technology Protection Program provides focused, comprehensive counterintelligence and core mission investigative services to safeguard Air Force and Space Force technologies, programs, critical program information, personnel and facilities.

Specialized services

OSI has numerous specialists who are invaluable in the successful resolution of investigations. They include technical specialists, polygraphers, behavioral scientists, computer experts and forensic advisers.

Department of Defense Cyber Crime Center

The Department of Defense Cyber Crime Center (DC3) was established as an organic entity within OSI in 1998. The formation of the DC3 expanded the operational scope of the OSI Computer Forensic Lab, established in 1995 as the first of its kind within the DoD. DC3 provides digital and multimedia forensics, cyber investigative training, research, development, test and evaluation, and cyber analytics for the following DoD mission areas: information assurance and critical infrastructure protection, law enforcement and counterintelligence, document and media exploitation, and counterterrorism. DC3 is a national cyber center and serves as the operational focal point for the Defense Industrial Base Cybersecurity and Information Assurance Program (DIB CS/IA Program).

Force Protection Detachment Program

OSI personnel assigned to Force Protection Detachment Programs(FPD) work closely with host nation security and intelligence services to identify and mitigate terrorist threats, and are fully-integrated with the Department of State Country Team within the embassy. FPD agents leverage counterintelligence / AT expertise, language skills, and a deep understanding of cross-cutting international dynamics, to safeguard DoD resources abroad.

Antiterrorism Specialty Team 

Created out of a need to meet the increasing challenges presented by worldwide terrorism, AFOSI antiterrorism teams are maintained around the globe. These highly trained and specialized AFOSI unit stands ready on a moment&#x27;s notice to deploy globally to provide antiterrorism, counterintelligence information collections and investigative services to Air Force personnel and units. Today&#x27;s Antiterrorism Specialty Team(AST) executes full-spectrum counterintelligence, counterterrorism and force protection operations in support of contingency requirements.

==AFOSI and Operation Urgent Fury==

Operation Urgent Fury marked the largest American military action since the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, and for most of the AFOSI personnel who participated it marked their first combat-related deployment ever. During the operation, a total of 28 AFOSI personnel deployed to locations that included Grenada, Puerto Rico, Barbados, Antigua, Florida and North Carolina. 

Some AFOSI personnel deployed on little as a 24-hour notice, many without the ability to tell their families exactly where they were going, not necessarily due to operational security, but due to the fact that they themselves were not immediately aware. Others deployed without the approved battle dress uniforms having to borrow those from military members at the stateside bases where they worked. 

Despite these initial challenges, these Special Agents did what Special Agents do best and they improvised solutions to the problems they faced, all the while remaining mission focused. Arriving in country with no transportation and no communication tools, they acquired vehicles and radios. Some of these resources were obtained through the AFOSI chain of command back in the U.S., while many of the resources were garnered locally through military channels or on the ground by personal ingenuity. The latter included salvaging parts from inoperable vehicles and communications equipment to keep AFOSI resources operational. 

The reasons they were successful, as one agent put it: “Everyone had enough nerve, common sense, and perhaps overblown self-confidence to take it on.”

Once combat operations began, Headquarters AFOSI, Operating Location-G was established in a command post that was adjacent to the U.S. Embassy in St. George.The primary job of Special Agents deploying to Grenada was to provide tactical counterintelligence support to the various Air Force elements involved in the operation. During Operation Urgent Fury, Air Force aircraft and personnel conducted a wide range of missions, including reconnaissance, close air support, troop and cargo delivery, casualty and evacuee transportation, air refueling, psychological warfare, communications and air traffic control. 

Special Agents established an area source network with local business and community leaders in country, conducted surveys of airports, hotels, restaurants, shopping areas and shipping and port facilities across the island, and collected and reported information on potential threats. Special Agents coordinated their collection and information sharing efforts regularly with Air Force Security Police, Army Military Intelligence and Central Intelligence Agency officers. 

Throughout the region, Special Agents provided multiple daily briefings to on-scene Air Force and ground defense commanders and other senior military leaders keeping them informed of real-time conditions. The Air Force is dependent upon an airbase as its primary operating location. The survivability of that base is paramount. The physical task to defend a base rests with the security police air base ground defense forces. Administrative support personnel who deployed to Grenada supported operations by establishing files, preparing and releasing messages, operating communications equipment, and securing equipment and vehicles for Special Agent use in the field. 

The combat phase of Operation Urgent Fury was completed on Nov. 2. AFOSI personnel remained in country until Dec. 15. AFOSI operations in Grenada lasted for 50 days, with an overall total of eight Special Agents and four administrative support personnel deployed to the island at one time or another. With the departure of the last AFOSI personnel from Grenada, Headquarters AFOSI, Operating Location-G was inactivated. By the conclusion of operations, Air Force aircraft safely returned more than 6,000 military personnel to home stations and transported more than 700 American medical students and other American citizens to the United States, all protected and guided by AFOSI efforts.

As a command, there were several lessons learned by AFOSI during Operation Urgent Fury which were later applied to future operations. Many of the deployed agents credited prior participation in exercises for helping them to prepare for real-world operations. 

==Task Force Black==

OSI special agents are well known for providing criminal investigations and counterintelligence support at Department of the Air Force bases around the world. However, OSI’s charter also provides warfighting support in deployed theaters of operation, including Afghanistan.

From executing CI support to force protection, OSI special agents in deployed theaters find, fix, and neutralize hostile adversaries targeting Air Force expeditionary bases, helping to “keep the airfield green” and ensuring freedom of movement for vital Air Force equipment and personnel.

One of OSI’s flagship units conducting that pivotal mission was EDet 2413. The unit was a true Task Force, combining the efforts and expertise of OSI Special Agents, intelligence specialists, Air Force Security Forces, linguists, and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance operators. []

Mission

As the U.S. and NATO allies and partners realign mission focus in southern Afghanistan, OSI ends an era. Task Force Black (TFB), also known as Expeditionary Detachment (EDet) 2413, has reached its End of Mission.

TFB began as an Operating Location (OL) to EDet 2405 Bagram Airfield, Afghanistan in 2005. The need for the OL to become its own detachment was quickly recognized, and EDet 2413 was stood up in 2008.

Early members of EDet 2413 worked tirelessly to mold a lethal collection team capable of interoperability with U.S. and allied forces to maximum effect. This dogged effort drew attention from the battle space owner, after the capture of a high-value target (HVT) utilizing partner-country special operations forces, resulting in long term custody. This tradition of flexibility and outside the box thinking continued to manifest itself when EDet 2413 helped secure two of the largest drug seizures in history, conducted jointly with the Drug Enforcement Administration and attached U.S. Special Forces.

EDet 2413 solidified a respected and self-executing mission capability unrivaled at the time. It took large steps toward normalizing OSI operations throughout southern Afghanistan with both inside- and outside-the-wire operations. These steps led to EDet 2413 officially becoming Task Force Black in 2009, which institutionalized the revered Tactical Security Element (TSE) Defenders, forever changing the way TFB did business. 

In 2013, TFB realized it was outgrowing its support capabilities and worked with the 24th Expeditionary Field Investigations Squadron (24 EFIS) at Al Udeid Air Base, Qatar, to secure dedicated intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance assets. A robust ISR team quickly followed these developments, cementing TFB as an unstoppable OSI Task Force.

TFB made the protection of the airfield, and everyone on it, their sole purpose in life, carried out in the most professional way. Throughout its history, TFB assisted Afghan partners to respond to countless rocket and mortar attacks, complex ground assaults, improvised explosive device ambushes, while pursuing those who wanted to defraud the airfield and limit wartime capabilities.

TFB is responsible for the destruction of thousands of tons of explosives, ammunition and weapons used by the enemy. TFB is also responsible for countless HVT neutralizations. TFB often supported partners to ensure overall success of not just the war effort, but also the reconstruction effort of Afghanistan. Throughout its storied history, TFB tallied thousands of outside-the-wire missions, resulting in countless intelligence reports given to the Intelligence Community and battlespace owners. []

EDet 2413/Task Force Black also known as “Lucky 13”

The Task Force Black team worked together with joint, Afghan, and international partners to identify, deter, and stop threats to Kandahar Airfield. Operating both on and off-the installation, Task Force Black personnel supported Afghan partners in enforcing Afghan law and deterring terrorism.

Through their efforts, Task Force Black provided commanders with a better understanding of the local area and local threats. In cooperation with international partners also working to ensure the stability and rule of law in Afghanistan, Task Force Black forged and furthered operational cooperation to safeguard the local battlespace from terrorism.

Upon mission stand-down, Task Force Black handed off their Force Protection responsibilities, ensuring that key U.S., Allied and Afghan missions continue securely and efficiently. 

For 19 years, Task Force Black proudly represented the best of what OSI brings to the fight.[]

==Training and physical requirements==
All new OSI special agent recruits—whether officer, enlisted, or civilian—receive their entry-level training at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security&#x27;s Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) in Glynco, Georgia. The training requires that each recruit meet various physical requirements. The candidates attend the 12-week Criminal Investigator Training Program with other federal law enforcement trainees. That course is followed by eight weeks of OSI agency-specific coursework, at the U.S. Air Force Special Investigations Academy (USAFSIA), co-located at FLETC. Both courses offer new agents training in firearms and other weapons, defensive tactics, forensics, surveillance and surveillance detection, antiterrorism techniques, crime scene processing, interrogations and interviews, court testimony, and military and federal law. Upon graduation, new OSI special agents spend a one-year probationary period in the field. Upon successful completion, some agents receive specialized training in economic crime, antiterrorism service, counterintelligence, computer crimes and other sophisticated criminal investigative capabilities. Others attend 12 weeks of technical training to acquire electronic, photographic and other skills required to perform technical surveillance countermeasures. Experienced agents selected for polygraph duties attend a 14-week Department of Defense course.

Each recruit is expected to participate in each of the following exercises: flexibility, bench press, run/walk and agility run. All students are tested to determine their fitness level, and each test is age and gender normed. OSI special agents are expected to remain physically fit throughout their employment and must maintain Air Force physical fitness standards as defined by Air Force Instruction (AFI) 36-2905.

==Firearms==
OSI agents&#x27; primary firearm is the 9×19mm Glock 19 or Glock 26, though other weapons are available for use depending on the needs of the mission, including the M4 and MP5. Agents may also carry one personally owned weapon (POW) from an approved list of manufacturers in 9mm. However, agents must qualify with one of the government-issued Glock pistols.

==Air Force Academy Informant Program==

In December 2013, &quot;The Colorado Springs Gazette&quot; reported that OSI was operating a Confidential Informant Program at the U.S. Air Force Academy (USAFA), Colorado Springs, CO, which recruited cadets to gather information about other rule breakers and criminals. The program left the recruits to take responsibility for both the initial incident that got them into trouble and any subsequent rule-breaking behavior resulting from the directions of OSI agents. One of the cadets who participated said, &quot;...it was effective. We got 15 convictions of drugs, two convictions of sexual assault. We were making a difference. It was motivating, especially with the sexual assaults. You could see the victims have a sense of peace.&quot;

In response, the USAFA Superintendent will now have oversight of the program at the Academy. Though the Superintendent will be aware of the operations, OSI will still have command and control of the program.

==Specialities==
OSI has a number of specialties composed of experienced Special Agents:

* Forensic science;

* Tech Service;

* Cyber;

* Polygraph examination;

* Investigations;

* counter-espionage;

* antiterrorism;

* Protective Services Operations;

* Counterintelligence.

==Notable agents==
*Arlen Specter, former U.S. Senator for Pennsylvania and OSI special agent
*Herb Bateman, former member of the U.S. House of Representatives for Virginia&#x27;s 1st congressional district and OSI special agent, who died on 11 September 2000

==Fallen Agents==

During the height of the Iraq &amp; Afghan wars, OSI Special Agents conducted counterintelligence, protective service and force protection operations. These operations involved running sources in combat zones, tracking down IED cells, protecting senior leaders and regular collections &quot;outside the wire.&quot; OSI combat deployments resulted in the injury &amp; death of several Special Agents as a result of mortar attacks, IEDS and suicide bombers. Consequently, OSI has had the unfortunate distinction of the highest casualty rate among 1811 agencies during that time-frame.

==In popular culture==

* In the 2008 film &quot;Eagle Eye&quot;, actress Rosario Dawson played OSI Special Agent Zoe Perez.
* In the 2013 film Mirage Men, Richard Doty, a retired OSI special agent, played himself in a documentary about the OSI investigation into UFOs between 1952 and 1969.

<text>In the United States, Office of Inspector General (OIG) is a generic term for the oversight division of a federal or state agency aimed at preventing inefficient or unlawful operations within their parent agency. Such offices are attached to many federal executive departments, independent federal agencies, as well as state and local governments. Each office includes an inspector general (or IG) and employees charged with identifying, auditing, and investigating fraud, waste, abuse, embezzlement and mismanagement of any kind within the executive department.

== History ==
In the United States, other than in the military departments, the first Office of Inspector General was established by act of Congress in 1976 under the Department of Health and Human Services to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicare, Medicaid, and more than 100 other departmental programs. With approximately 1,600 employees, the HHS-OIG performs audits, investigations, and evaluations to recommend policy for decision-makers and the public.

Ronald Reagan terminated 16 inspectors general when he entered into office in 1981. His administration explained that Reagan intended to hire his own selections. After Congress objected, Reagan rehired five of those terminated.

George H. W. Bush also attempted to dismiss all the inspectors general when he became president in 1989, but relented after the inspectors general and Congress objected.

Barack Obama dismissed Corporation for National and Community Service inspector general Gerald Walpin citing a lack of confidence in him. After Congress objected to his lack of explanation, the Obama administration cited that Walpin had shown &quot;troubling and inappropriate conduct&quot;, and pointed to an incident that year when Walpin was &quot;disoriented&quot; during a board meeting of the corporation, because of which the board requested Walpin&#x27;s dismissal. Walpin sued for reinstatement, but the courts ruled against him.

In 2020, Donald Trump dismissed or replaced five inspectors general within six weeks. Two permanent inspectors general were dismissed and three acting inspectors general were replaced. Just after firing intelligence inspector general Michael Atkinson, Trump criticized Atkinson as having done a &quot;terrible job&quot; and that he &quot;took a fake report and he brought it to Congress&quot;, in reference to the whistleblower complaint of the Trump–Ukraine scandal, which other testimony and evidence largely verified. Trump also described Atkinson as &quot;not a big Trump fan&quot;. Around one month before Trump replaced Christi Grimm as acting health inspector general, he had called her report of shortages of medical supplies in American hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States as &quot;wrong&quot;, &quot;fake&quot;, and &quot;her opinion&quot;, despite the report being based on a survey of 323 hospitals. Trump also questioned Grimm&#x27;s motives for the report.

In 2025, during his second presidency, Donald Trump summarily fired as many as seventeen inspectors general late the night of January 24. The individuals affected came from positions in the Pentagon, departments of State, Veterans Affairs and Interior. Trump did not provide Congress with 30 days’ advance notice or a written explanation of the rationale behind the firing, as required by the Inspector General Act of 1978 and the Securing Inspectors General Act of 2022. On February 12, eight of the inspectors general fired by Trump opened lawsuits arguing that the firings violated federal statutes and requesting to be reinstated to their positions.

==Authority==

The Inspector General Act of 1978 created 12 departmental inspectors general. Thirty years later, in October 2008, the added IGs in various other areas. , there were 72 statutory IGs.

The offices employ special agents (criminal investigators, often armed) and auditors. In addition, federal offices of inspectors general employ forensic auditors, or &quot;audigators&quot;, evaluators, inspectors, administrative investigators, and a variety of other specialists. Their activities include the detection and prevention of fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement of the government programs and operations within their parent organizations. Office investigations may be internal, targeting government employees, or external, targeting grant recipients, contractors, or recipients of the various loans and subsidies offered through the thousands of federal domestic and foreign assistance programs. The Inspector General Reform Act of 2008 (IGRA) amended the 1978 act by increasing pay and various powers and creating the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE).

Some inspectors general, the heads of the offices, are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. For example, both the inspector general of the U.S. Department of Labor and the inspector general of the U.S. Agency for International Development are presidentially appointed. The remaining inspectors general are designated by their respective agency heads, such as the U.S. Postal Service inspector general. Presidentially appointed IGs can only be removed, or terminated, from their positions by the President of the United States, whereas designated inspectors general can be terminated by the agency head. However, in both cases Congress must be notified of the termination, removal, or reassignment.

While the IG Act of 1978 requires that inspectors general be selected based upon their qualifications and not political affiliation, presidentially appointed inspectors general are considered political appointees and are often selected, if only in part and in addition to their qualifications, because of their political relationships and party affiliation. An example of the role political affiliation plays in the selection of an inspector general, and the resulting pitfalls, can be seen in the 2001 Republican appointment (and resignation under fire) of Janet Rehnquist (daughter of former Chief Justice of the United States, William Rehnquist) to the post of inspector general for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

While all of the federal offices of inspectors general operate separately from one another, they share information and some coordination through the Council of Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency. , the CIGIE comprised 68 offices. In addition to their inspector general members, the CIGIE includes non-inspector general representatives from the federal executive branch, such as executives from the Office of Management and Budget, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Government Ethics, the Office of Special Counsel, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The CIGIE also provides specialized training to the inspector general community.

Further evidence of coordination between federal offices of inspectors general can be seen by the public through the offices&#x27; shared website, and the use of shared training facilities and resources, such as the Inspector General Criminal Investigator Academy (IGCIA), and their Inspector General Community Auditor Training Team (IGCATS), which are hosted by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security&#x27;s Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC).

Evidence of the offices&#x27; return on investment to taxpayers can be seen through their semi-annual reports to Congress, most of which are available on each office&#x27;s website.

Since the post-9/11 enactment of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, resulting in the amendment of the IG Act of 1978, Section 6e, most presidentially appointed IG special agents have had full law enforcement authority to carry firearms, make arrests, and execute search warrants. Prior to this time, most presidentially appointed IG and some designated IG special agents had the equivalent law enforcement authorities as a result of other statutes or annually required deputation by the U.S. Marshals Service. The 2002 amendment to the IG Act of 1978 made most deputation of presidentially appointed IG special agents unnecessary. Some designated IG special agents, however, still have full law enforcement authority today by virtue of this continued deputation. Some OIGs employ no criminal investigators and rely solely on administrative investigators, auditors, and inspectors.

===Legislative agency inspectors general===
===U.S. military===
Within the United States Armed Forces, the position of inspector general is normally part of the personal staff serving a general or flag officer in a command position. The inspector general&#x27;s office functions in two ways. To a certain degree they are ombudsmen for their branch of service. However, their primary function is to ensure the combat readiness of subordinate units in their command.

An armed services inspector general also investigates noncriminal allegations and some specific criminal allegations, to include determining if the matter should be referred for criminal investigation by the service&#x27;s criminal investigative agency.

The Air Force Inspector General Complaints Program was established to address the concerns of Air Force active duty, reserve, and Guard members, civilian employees, family members, and retirees, as well as the interest of the Air Force. One of the first responsibilities of the Air Force inspector general is to operate a credible complaints program that investigates personnel complaints: Fraud, Waste, and Abuse (FWA) allegations; congressional inquiries; and issues involving the Air Force mission. Personnel complaints and FWA disclosures to the IG help commanders correct problems that affect the productivity, mission accomplishment, and morale of assigned personnel, which are areas of high concern to Air Force leaders at all levels.

==Stark Law and Anti-Kickback Statute enforcement==

HHS-OIG develops and distributes resources to assist the health care industry in its efforts to comply with the nation&#x27;s fraud and abuse laws and to educate the public about fraudulent schemes so that it can protect itself and report suspicious activities.

As of 2015, HHS-OIG had targeted hospitals and healthcare systems for Stark Law and Anti-Kickback Statute violations pertaining to the management of physician compensation arrangements. In 2015, a fraud alert was issued to publicize the OIG&#x27;s intent to further regulate such non-compliance. In light of such efforts and consequent record-breaking settlements, healthcare experts have begun to call for the transition from paper-based physician time logging and contract management to automated solutions.

==Reception==

=== Support ===
Glenn Fine argues that inspectors general save taxpayers billions of dollars a year and have the potential to save much more if given more resources and independence as well as more independent oversight of the inspectors generals themselves. He also argues that the Supreme Court of the United States and all other institutions need independent and nonpartisan inspectors general.

=== Criticism ===
In the Thomas Andrews Drake case, some complainants to the Pentagon&#x27;s OIG over NSA&#x27;s Trailblazer Project were later raided by the FBI and threatened with criminal prosecution.

<text>Universal Records was a record label owned by Universal Music Group and operated as part of the Universal Motown Republic Group. The label has been dormant since 2006, due to Universal Motown and Universal Republic Records being formed and taking all of the artists from it. Those labels were eventually combined to form the latest iteration of Republic Records.

As of 2023, the label remains dormant but has been credited as a copyright-holder under a few present-day releases.

==History==
Founded in 1995 as Rising Tide Records, the label would ultimately begin to thrive the following year when its name was changed to Universal Records to complement the branding overhaul of the Universal Studios structure since MCA Inc. was purchased from Matsushita Electric (now Panasonic) by Seagram. The label, which is actually the &quot;second&quot; incarnation (the first Universal Records was a short-lived underground imprint of MCA Records that existed from 1988 to 1989) was created by former Universal Music Group chairman and CEO Doug Morris and Daniel Glass (founder of Glassnote Records), who became its president.

In 1996, to complement the MCA renaming into Universal, MCA Music Entertainment Group was also rebranded into what is known today as Universal Music Group. With that in place, Universal Records was to operate under the newly renamed UMG banner.

Universal Records had success in breaking new artists, including the multi-platinum debut of Erykah Badu, Billie Myers, Goldfinger, Akon and the Lost Boyz. Glass formed relationships with independent record labels such as Kedar Entertainment and Mojo Records. Universal also brought in and took over Uptown Records following founder Andre Harrell&#x27;s departure. Following Heavy D&#x27;s dropping from the imprint in 1997, Universal folded Uptown in 1999.

New Orleans, Louisiana based record company Cash Money Records, led by Ronald &quot;Slim&quot; Williams and Bryan &quot;Baby/Birdman&quot; Williams, signed a three-year $30 million distribution deal with Universal Records in March 1998. Under the terms of the deal, the Williams were given a $3 million advance each year and a credit of $1.5 million for each of the up to six artists that they had at the time. After recouping, Universal Records would retain 15% of profits from album sales, while Cash Money retained 85% as well as ownership of all master recordings. Cash Money&#x27;s first success under Universal was Juvenile&#x27;s November 1998 release, &quot;400 Degreez&quot;. The album peaked at number nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and would ultimately go on to be certified quadruple platinum in the United States. Cash Money and Universal also launched Lil Wayne&#x27;s career with his November 1999 album &quot;Tha Block Is Hot&quot;, which was a top three &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album and later certified platinum in America.

On December 10, 1998, Seagram completed its seven-month $10.6 billion plan to acquire PolyGram, merging its music division of labels with UMG, helping both divisions combine operations together under the biggest music recording company. On New Year&#x27;s Eve 1998, Universal Records was pooled together with then-PolyGram label Motown Records and fellow MCA label Republic Records to form Universal Motown Republic Group; Motown was previously brought under UMG during its preceding days as MCA Inc. It was a subsidiary of MCA Records and minority-owned by Boston Ventures until 1991. To start the New Year in 1999, Universal Motown Republic Group became one of the three new music units under UMG alongside Interscope Geffen A&amp;M Records and The Island Def Jam Music Group.

In 2001, after the absorption of Priority Records into EMI, No Limit Records was signed a distribution deal with Universal and renamed &quot;The New No Limit&quot;. However, this deal failed as various releases by Master P, Romeo, 504 Boyz and Choppa did not meet commercial expectations. No Limit cut ties with Universal in 2004, a year after filing for bankruptcy.

Bad Boy Entertainment, founded by Sean &quot;P. Diddy&quot; Combs, signed a three-year marketing and distribution deal with Universal Records in February 2003, following its departure from Arista Records. Universal and Bad Boy released Da Band&#x27;s September 2003 album, &quot;Too Hot for TV&quot;. The album was ultimately certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. Albums under this deal that followed include the soundtrack to &quot;Bad Boys II&quot;, Loon&#x27;s self-titled album, Carl Thomas&#x27; &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About It&quot;, Mario Winans&#x27; &quot;Hurt No More&quot; and New Edition&#x27;s &quot;One Love&quot;. In 2005, Bad Boy switched distribution from Universal to Atlantic Records before the deal could be fulfilled.

The label later had more success with acts like 3 Doors Down, 98 Degrees, Chamillionaire, Godsmack, Mushroomhead, Flaw, Hatebreed, Lifer, Jack Johnson, Juvenile, Nelly, Big Sha, Lil Wayne, and Mika. In the summer of 2004, Universal had a big success with Terror Squad&#x27;s single, &quot;Lean Back&quot;, which debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 that August.

By 2005, Universal was reaching its downfall, even though Cash Money kept its prophecy leading, but its success was short-lived. On New Year&#x27;s Eve 2005, Universal Records was merged with Republic Records to become Universal Republic Records. Motown (as a standalone label) was renamed Universal Motown Records. Therefore, artists under Motown, as well as hip hop and R&amp;B acts under Universal were combined together under Universal Motown, with the rest being transferred to Universal Republic, which would later be reverted back to Republic Records in 2012, a year after Universal Motown was changed back to Motown, which itself would be moved to Island Def Jam. As a result, the Universal Motown Republic Group was disbanded in the summer of 2011 during a reorganization at Universal Music Group, which was under the leadership of Lucian Grainge.

It was also the distributor of Polydor and Island UK in the United States. Distribution switched to Interscope Geffen A&amp;M Records and Republic Records respectively after the label&#x27;s dissolution. Island&#x27;s operation in the United Kingdom, in 2013, would be absorbed into Virgin EMI Records, which, itself, would be rebranded in 2020 as EMI Records, taking over distribution for Republic UK.

, Universal Records is currently inactive as its artists would later be drafted to Republic Records. Motown is currently under the Interscope Capitol Labels Group, which it has been a part of since 2014 following another UMG disbandment of the Island Def Jam Music Group. Therefore, reissues of releases under the Universal Records, Universal Republic or Universal Motown names will be handled by Republic and Motown respectively on behalf of Universal Music Enterprises.

There have been unrelated labels in Europe and the Philippines, taking the &quot;Universal Records&quot; name. Because of an unrelated label in the Philippines owning the rights to the Universal Records name in that country, parent company Universal Music Group did business there as MCA Music, Inc., using UMG&#x27;s former name. In 2021, MCA Music was renamed UMG Philippines.

== Affiliated labels ==
Affiliated labels included Celtic Heartbeat Records, co-founded by U2 manager Paul McGuinness. formerly affiliated with Atlantic Records, and Universal Motown Republic Group (UMRG). Bill Whelan&#x27;s &quot;&quot; was Celtic Heartbeat&#x27;s first album to sell more than a million copies.

<doc id="1184487" wikidata="Q271990" url="?curid=1184487" title="Nāga">
<text>In various Asian religious traditions, the Nagas () are a divine, or semi-divine, race of half-human, half-Cobra beings that reside in the netherworld (Patala), and can occasionally take human or part-human form, or are so depicted in art. Furthermore, Nagas are also known as dragons and water spirits. A female naga is called a Nagin, or a [[Naiṇī Devī|Nagini]]. Their descendants are known as Nagavanshi. According to legend, they are the children of the sage Kashyapa and Kadru. Rituals devoted to these supernatural beings have been taking place throughout South Asia for at least 2,000 years. They are principally depicted in three forms: as entirely human with snakes on the heads and necks, as common serpents, or as half-human, half-snake beings in Hinduism and Buddhism.

&quot;Nagaraja&quot; is the title given to the king of the nagas. Narratives of these beings hold cultural significance in the mythological traditions of many South Asian and Southeast Asian cultures, and within Hinduism and Buddhism. Communities such as the Nagavanshi, Khmer and Eelamese claim descent from this race.

== Etymology ==

In Sanskrit, a () is a snake, most often depicted by the Indian cobra (&quot;Naja naja&quot;). A synonym for &#x27; is &#x27; (). There are several words for &quot;snake&quot; in general, and one of the very commonly used ones is &#x27; (). Sometimes the word &#x27; is also used generically to mean &quot;snake&quot;. The word is cognate with English &#x27;snake&#x27;, Germanic: &quot;*snēk-a-&quot;, Proto-IE: &quot;*(s)nēg-o-&quot; (with s-mobile).

Alternatively, an Indo-European etymology as a &quot;hairless, naked animal&quot; - cognate to English &quot;naked&quot; - would explain that the Sanskrit word &quot;nāga&quot; can also mean &quot;cloud&quot;, &quot;mountain&quot; or &quot;elephant&quot;.

== Hinduism ==
Nagas, as a serpent-shaped group of deities that often take form as cobras, are prominent in Hindu iconography, throughout the hindu texts (especially in the first book of the Mahābhārata) and in local folk traditions of worship. In some regions of the Himalaya, nagas are regarded as the divine rulers of the region - as in Kullu Valley, in Berinag and in the valley of the Pindar River, which is believed to be ruled by the ninefold Naiṇī Devī. Both in the Nilamata Purana of Kashmir and in the Swayambhu Purana of Kathmandu, the respective region begins its history as a lake, populated by nagas, which is later drained.

Ancient Sanskrit texts such as the Mahabharata, the Ramayana, and the Puranas describe the nagas as a powerful, splendid and proud semi-divine species that can assume their physical form either as human (often with a halo of cobra hoods behind their head), as a partially human serpent, or as a whole serpent. Their domain is in the enchanted underworld, the underground realm filled with gems, gold and other earthly treasures called &quot;Naga-loka&quot; or &quot;Patala-loka&quot;. They are also often associated with bodies of waters — including rivers, lakes, seas, and wells — and are guardians of treasure. Their power and venom make them potentially dangerous to humans. However, in Hindu mythology, they often take the role of benevolent protagonists; in the Samudra Manthana, Vasuki, a nagaraja who abides on Shiva&#x27;s neck, became the churning rope for churning of the Ocean of Milk. Their eternal archrival is the Garuḍa, the legendary semi-divine bird-like deity.
Vishnu is originally portrayed in the form sheltered by Sheshanāga or reclining on Shesha, but the iconography has been extended to other deities as well. The serpent is a common feature in Ganesha iconography, and appears in many forms: around the neck, use as a sacred thread (Sanskrit: &quot;&quot;) wrapped around the stomach as a belt, held in a hand, coiled at the ankles, or as a throne. Shiva is often shown garlanded with a snake. Maehle (2006: p. 297) states that &quot;Patanjali is thought to be a manifestation of the serpent of eternity&quot;. 

=== Folk Traditions ===
In South India, termite hills are believed to be the dwelling place of female Nagammas, whereas Himalayan Nags and Naginis, such as Naiṇī Devī of Pindar Valley, are worshipped as underworld beings protecting water resources and the wellbeing of village and valley.

=== Literature ===

The &quot;Mahabharata&quot; epic is the first text that introduces nagas; it describes them in detail and narrates their stories. The cosmic snake Shesha, the nagarajas (naga kings) Vasuki, Takshaka, Airavata and Karkotaka, and the princess Ulupi, are all depicted in the Mahabharata.

The Brahma Purana describes the reign of Adishesha as the king of the serpents in Patala:

The Kamba Ramayana describes the role of Vasuki in the Samudra Manthana:

The Devi Bhagavata Purana describes the legend of Manasa:
== Buddhism ==

As in Hinduism, the Buddhist nāga generally has sometimes been portrayed as a human being with a snake or dragon extending over his head. One nāga, in human form, attempted to become a monk, and when telling it that such ordination was impossible, the Buddha told it how to ensure that it would be reborn a human, and so able to become a monk.

The nagas are believed to both live on Nagaloka, among the other minor deities and in various parts of the human-inhabited earth. Some of them are water-dwellers, living in streams or the ocean; others are earth-dwellers, living in caverns.

The nagas are the followers of (Pāli: Virūpakkha), one of the Four Heavenly Kings who guards the western direction. They act as guards upon Mount Sumeru, protecting the dēvas of Trāyastriṃśa from attacks by the asuras.

Among the notable nagas of Buddhist tradition is Mucalinda, nagaraja and protector of the Buddha. In the Vinaya Sutra (I, 3), shortly after his enlightenment, the Buddha is meditating in a forest when a great storm arises, but graciously, King Mucalinda gives shelter to the Buddha from the storm by covering the Buddha&#x27;s head with his seven snake heads. Then the king takes the form of a young Brahmin and renders the Buddha homage.

In the Vajrayāna and Mahāsiddha traditions, nagas in their half-human form are depicted holding a nagas-jewel, kumbhas of amrita, or a terma that had been elementally encoded by adepts. In Tibetan Buddhism, nagas are known as &quot;klu&quot; or &quot;klu-mo&quot; and they are associated with water and cleanliness, as they live in oceans, rivers, lakes, and springs, and do not want their environments to be disturbed or polluted.

The two chief disciples of the Buddha, Sariputta and Moggallāna are both referred to as &quot;Mahānāga&quot; or &quot;Great nāga&quot;. Some of the most important figures in Buddhist history symbolize nagas in their names such as Dignāga, Nāgāsēna, and, although other etymons are assigned to his name, Nāgārjuna.

=== Literature ===
The Nāga Saṃyutta of the Pali Canon consists of suttas specifically devoted to explaining nature of the nagas.

In the &quot;Devadatta&quot; chapter of the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;, the daughter of the dragon king, an eight year old longnü (龍女, ), after listening to Mañjuśrī preach the Lotus Sutra, transforms into a male Bodhisattva and immediately reaches full enlightenment. Some say this tale appears to reinforce the viewpoint prevalent in Mahayana scriptures that a male body is required for Buddhahood, even if a being is so advanced in realization that they can magically transform their body at will and demonstrate the emptiness of the physical form itself. However, many schools of Buddhism and classical, seminal Chinese exegeses interpret the story to repudiate this viewpoint, stating the story demonstrates that women can attain Buddhahood in their current form.

According to tradition, the Prajñapāramita sutras had been given by the Buddha to a great nāga who guarded them in the sea, and were conferred upon Nāgārjuna later.

In Tibetan Buddhist literature, nagas are portrayed as guardians or owners of submerged treasure, which can be mere wealth or supernatural, &quot;spiritual&quot; treasures.

== Other traditions ==
In Thailand and Java, the nāga is a wealthy underworld deity. For Malay sailors, nagas are a type of dragon with many heads. In Laos they are beaked water serpents. In Tibet, they are said to be found in waterways and underground locations, and are susceptible to the suffering caused by human carelessness towards the natural environment.

=== Sri Lanka ===

The Naga people were believed to be an ancient tribe and origins of Sri Lanka. According to V. Kanakasabhai, the Oliyar, Parathavar, Maravar, and Eyinar, who were widespread across South India and North-East Sri Lanka, are all Naga tribes. There are references to them in several ancient texts such as Mahavamsa, Manimekalai, and also in other Sanskrit and Pali literature. They are generally represented as a class of superhumans taking the form of serpents who inhabit a subterranean world. Texts such as Manimekalai represent them as persons in human form.

=== Cambodia ===
Stories of nāgas (, ) have been part of Khmer society for thousands of years, dating back to the Funan era (). According to reports from two Chinese envoys, Kang Tai and Zhu Ying, the state of Funan was established in the 1st century CE when an Indian prince named Kaundinya I () married a nāga princess named Soma (កូនព្រះចន្ទ kon preah chan; &quot;Soma, daughter of the moon god&quot;; Chinese: 柳葉, 柳叶 &quot;Liuye&quot;; &quot;Willow Leaf&quot;). The couple is symbolized in the story of Preah Thong and Neang Neak.
As the legend goes, Kaundinya received instruction in a dream to take a magic bow from a temple and defeat Soma, the nāga princess and daughter of the nāga king. During the ensuing battle, they fell in love and later married, establishing the royal lineage of the Funan dynasty. Kaundinya subsequently constructed the capital city of Vyadhapura, and the kingdom became known as &quot;Kambujadeśa&quot; or Cambodia (, ).
The love story between Kaundinya and Soma is the foundation for many standard practices in modern-day Khmer culture, including wedding ceremonies and other rituals.
The Khmer people regard themselves as descendants of the nagas and many still believe the nāga exist today, destined to one day return and restore prosperity to their people.

Although wars, nature, and the passage of time destroyed many temples from the Funan era, nāgas can still be seen in ancient temples dating to the Chenla and Angkor eras. For instance, the temple now called &quot;The Coiled Nāgas Temple&quot; (, ) was previously named, &quot;Emperor&#x27;s Wealth Temple&quot; ( ).

In Khmer culture, nāgas symbolize rain, and represent a bridge between the mortal realm () and the realm of devas (Heaven; /). They have the ability to transform into half or fully human and act as protectors against invisible forces, deities, or malicious intentions. Furthermore, Cambodian nāgas possess numerological symbolism based on the number of their heads. Odd-headed nāgas embody masculinity, infinity, timelessness, and immortality, since all odd numbers derives from the number one (១). Even-headed nāgas denote femininity, physicality, mortality, temporality, and the Earth. Odd headed nāgas are believed to represent immortality and are carved and used throughout Cambodia.

===Odd-headed nāga===

;1-headed Nāga: Mostly seen in modern days, carved on objects for protection in temples, monasteries, king&#x27;s places and residences of deity (អទីទេព). They symbolize that even if everything in this world is gone, there&#x27;s still this Nāga left bringing victory and happiness to all.
;3-headed, Kalyak: Born between the mortal and divine realms, they live at the bottom of the ocean as guardians of wealth, often depicted as evil (nothing to do with the symbolism). They symbolize the Hindu Trimurti; (left Vishnu, middle Shiva, right Brahma) and the three realms - heaven (devas&#x27; realm), earth (mortal realm), and hell (norok realm). In Buddhism, the central head represents Buddha, the right Dharma and the left the monks.
;5-headed Anontak/Sesak: Born from the earthly elements, they are immortals. They symbolize the 5 directions; East, West, North, South and Middle (Ganga river, Indus river, Yamuna river, Brahmaputra river (Brahma&#x27;s Son River), Sarasvati river). In Buddhism, the 5 heads represent the 5 Buddhas - Kadabak, Kunsontho, Koneakumno, Samnak Koudom Gautama Buddha, and Seare Metrey.
;7-headed Muchlentak: Originated from the Himalayas, they bring peace and prosperity to humans. They control the seven oceans and seven mountains called &#x27;Seytontaraksatakboriphorn.&#x27; Sheltered Gautama Buddha for 7 days and 7 nights (Mucalinda). Often depicted as guardian statues, carved as balustrades on causeways leading to main temples, such as those found in Angkor Wat. They also represent the seven races within Naga society, which has a mythological, or symbolic, association with &quot;the seven colors of the rainbow.&quot; They symbolize the Sun, the Moon and five other planets; ចន្ទ (Moon)[also Monday] អង្គារ (Mars)[Tuesday] ពុធ (Mercury)[Wednesday] ព្រហស្បតិ៍ (Jupiter)[Thursday] សុក្រ (Venus)[Friday] សៅរ៍ (Saturn)[Saturday] អាទិត្យ (Sun)[Sunday].

;9-headed Vasukak: The king who rules the Earth (Vasuki). When carved on both sides, the front heads represent reincarnation and behind represent death. He symbolizes the power of the nine immortals of the universe - power of the lightning and thunder of the East (ទិសបូព៌ា), power of the fire of the Southeast (ទិសអាគ្នេយ៍), power of the law and order of the South (ទិសខាងត្បូង), power of the spirits and demonic creatures of the Southwest (ទិសនារតី), power of the rain of the West (ទិសខាងលិច), power of the wind of the Northwest (ទិសពាយព្យ), power of the wealth and aesthetic of the North (ទិសឧត្តរ), power of destruction of the Northeast (ទិសឥសាន្ត), power of Brahma (creation and preservation) in the middle (កណ្តាល).

In Indian origin religions, there are four different Nāga races:
#Primitive Dragons such as the European dragon who can spit fire.
#The Spiritual Dragons who are the guardians of wealth, protecting treasure in the ocean. They can take on a half human form.
#The Divine Nāgas, who can travel to heaven, came from Lord Indra&#x27;s realm (the divine realm). They can take on a full human form.
#The Supreme and Divine Nāgas, like Vasuki the follower of Lord Shiva, who alone can fight the entire Garuḍa race.

All of them have great powers and can set off storms, rain, tempest and create lands from the sea.

=== Indonesia ===

In Javanese, Sundanese, and Balinese culture, Indonesia, a nāga is depicted as a crowned, giant, magical serpent, sometimes winged. It is similarly derived from the Shiva-Hinduism tradition, merged with Javanese animism. The nāga in Indonesia mainly derived and influenced by Indic tradition, combined with the native animism tradition of sacred serpents. In Sanskrit, the term &quot;nāga&quot; literally means snake, but in Java it normally refer to serpent deity, associated with water and fertility. In Borobudur, the nagas are depicted in their human form, but elsewhere they are depicted in animal shape.

Early depictions of circa-9th-century Central Java closely resembled Indic nāga which was based on imagery of cobras. During this period, nāga-serpents were depicted as giant cobras supporting the waterspout of yoni-lingam. The examples of nāga-sculpture can be found in several Javanese candis, including Prambanan, Sambisari, Ijo, and Jawi. In East Java, the Penataran temple complex contain a &quot;Candi Nāga&quot;, an unusual nāga-temple with its Hindu-Javanese caryatids holding corpulent nagas aloft.

The later depiction since the 15th century, however, was slightly influenced by Chinese dragon imagery—although unlike its Chinese counterparts, Javanese and Balinese nagas do not have legs. Nāga as the lesser deity of earth and water is prevalent in the Hindu period of Indonesia, before the introduction of Islam.

In Balinese tradition, nagas are often depicted battling garuḍas. Intricately carved nagas are found as stairs railings in bridges or stairs, such as those found in Balinese temples, Ubud monkey forest, and Taman Sari in Yogyakarta.

In a wayang theater story, a snake-like god (nāga) named Sanghyang Anantaboga or Antaboga is a guardian deity in the bowels of the earth. nagas symbolize the nether realm of earth or underworld.

=== Laos ===
The Nāga () is believed to live in the Laotian stretch of the Mekong or its estuaries. Lao mythology maintains that the nagas are the protectors of Vientiane, and by extension, the Lao state. The association with nagas was most clearly articulated during and immediately after the reign of Anouvong. An important poem from this period &quot;San Leupphasun&quot; () discusses relations between Laos and Thailand in a veiled manner, using the Nāga and the Garuḍa to represent the Lao and the Thai, respectively. The Nāga is incorporated extensively into Lao iconography, and features prominently in Lao culture throughout the length of the country, not only in Vientiane.

===Thailand===
Phaya Nak or Phaya Nāga (; ; , &quot;phaya&quot; derived from Mon which mean &quot;high nobility&quot;) or Nakkharat (; ) in Thai beliefs, nagas are considered the patrons of water. Nagas are believed to live in either water bodies or in caves. According to a popular legend, the Mekong River in north-eastern Thailand and Laos was said to be created by two Nāga kings slithering through the area, thus creating the Mekong and the nearby Nan River. The Mekong is synonymous with the unexplained fireballs phenomenon which has long been believed to be created by the nagas that dwell in the river. Common explanations of their sightings have been attributed to oarfish, elongated fish with red crests; however, these are exclusively marine and usually live at great depths.

In November 2022, the Thai government declared the Naga as the national symbol of Thailand, with the aim of promoting Thai culture and traditions and increasing the country&#x27;s cultural capital to drive the creative economy. The Naga is a mythical creature with long-standing beliefs and connections to the Thai people, and its designation as a national symbol is a significant step towards preserving and promoting Thai culture. The National Culture Commission and the Fine Arts Department developed a prototype image of the Naga that accurately represents Thai beliefs and traditions related to the creature. The prototype image features the four families of Nagas, each with its unique color, and the largest Naga, Nak Vasuki (), who is related to Buddhism and the Thai monarchy, The Naga is also believed to be a symbol of water and fertility and serves as a guardian of Buddhism.

Due to the strong relation with everything water, the Nāga in Thai belief also plays a role in rain control. The concept of &quot;Nak hai nam&quot; (; lit. Nāga granting water) is used for annual rainfall prediction. It is still practiced nowadays, most notably during the Royal Ploughing Ceremony. The oracle ranges from &quot;1 nak hai nam&quot; (1 Nāga granted water); meaning that abundant rainfall should be observed that year, to maximum &quot;7 nak hai nam&quot; (7 nagas granted water); meaning there might not be adequate rainfall that year.

In northern Thailand, the Singhanavati Kingdom had a strong connection with nagas. The kingdom was believed to be built with aids of nagas, and thus, nagas were highly revered by the royal family. The kingdom, for a period of time, was renamed &quot;Yonok Nāga Rāj&quot; (lit. Yonok the nagaraja)

The nagas are also highly revered. The Buddhist temples and palaces are often adorned with various nagas. The term &quot;Nāga&quot; is also present in various Thai architecture terms including the &quot;nak sadung&quot; (นาคสะดุ้ง, the outer roof finial component featuring Nāga-like structure), and the &quot;nak than&quot; (นาคทันต์, the corbel with Nāga-shape). Moreover, nagas are sometimes linked to medicine. The naga Vasuki is present in the legend of the Samudra Manthana, in which Dhanvantari (god of Ayurveda) and amrita (the elixir of eternal life) were churned from the Ocean of Milk. The nagas can also be founded substituting the snakes in either Rod of Asclepius or mistakenly Caduceus of several medical institutions&#x27; symbols. The former seal of Faculty of Medicine, Srinakharinwirot University, and the seal of Society of Medical Student Thailand are some notable examples using the Caduceus with nagas&#x27; presence instead of snakes.

==== Folklore ====
Thai folklore holds the Phaya nagas to be semi-divine, demi-creatures, which possess supernatural powers as has been described in Buddhist and Hindu cosmology. The &quot;Kamchanod Forest&quot; (ป่าคำชะโนด; ) Ban Dung district, Udon Thani province, which is held in high reverence and fear across Thailand, is believed to be the border between the human world and the netherworld, and is frequently depicted in Thai folklore as the site of many hauntings, but more frequently is considered to be the home of the Nāga.

According to Shan folklore of Nánzhào Kingdom (now southern China and Southeast Asia during the 8th and 9th centuries, which was centered on present-day Yúnnán in China), the Nāga inhabited the Ěrhǎi lake and is the creator of the Mekong. In China, the Nāga (Chinese: 那伽) is generally more considered to be a dragon.

==== Appearance ====
Many people, particularly in Isan (the north-eastern region of Thailand), believe that the nagas are responsible for unnatural wave phenomena occurring in the rivers or lakes in the vicinity. It is also frequently claimed that the serpent-like demigods are responsible for marks on common objects, such as car hoods or house walls.

A police office has also claimed to be in contact with the Nāga, although the implications of this contact is not thoroughly explained.

In attempts to explain these phenomena, scientists and researchers at the Faculty of Science of Chulalongkorn University have attributed these seemingly preternatural phenomena to standing waves in water, and posit that the existence of the Phaya Nāga is similar to belief in Loch Ness Monster in Scotland or Ogopogo in Canada, and further maintain that the serpent-like tracks of the Phaya Nāga are very possibly forged by humans.

=== Malaysia ===

In Malay and Orang Asli traditions, the lake Chini, located in Pahang is home to a Nāga called Sri Gumum. Depending on legend versions, her predecessor Sri Pahang or her son left the lake and later fought a Nāga called Sri Kemboja. Kemboja is the Malay name for Cambodia. Like the Nāga-legends there, there are stories about an ancient empire in lake Chini, although the stories are not linked to the Nāga-legends.

=== Philippines ===
The indigenous Bakunawa, a serpent-like moon-eating creature in Philippine mythology, was syncretized with the Nāga. It is believed to be the cause of eclipses, earthquakes, rains, and wind. The movements of the &quot;bakunawa&quot; served as a geomantic calendar system for ancient Filipinos and were part of the shamanistic rituals of the &quot;babaylan&quot;. It is usually depicted with a characteristically looped tail and was variously believed to inhabit either the sea, the sky, or the underworld.
However, the bakunawa may have also syncretized with the Hindu deities, Rahu and Ketu, the navagraha of eclipses.
