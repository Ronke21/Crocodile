<text>Madonna is the debut studio album by American singer Madonna, released on July 27, 1983, by Sire Records. In the late 1970s, Madonna had established herself as a singer in downtown New York City; alongside her Michigan boyfriend Stephen Bray, she put together a demo tape with four dance tracks and began pitching it around local nightclubs. She managed to get Mark Kamins, the resident DJ at Danceteria, to play &quot;Everybody&quot; —one of the songs from the tape. The song drew positive reception from the crowd, and Kamins took Madonna to Sire Records, where label president Seymour Stein signed her on for three twelve-inch singles. Following its release on October 6, 1982, &quot;Everybody&quot; found success on the dance scene, and the label approved the recording of an album.

For the album, Madonna worked with Warner Bros. producer Reggie Lucas, who had worked with artists like Roberta Flack and Stephanie Mills. Soon, however, problems between the singer and Lucas arose, as she was not happy with his production outputs. Madonna then invited John &quot;Jellybean&quot; Benitez, her boyfriend at the time, to work and remix the rest of the album. &quot;Madonna&quot; is mostly a dance-pop post-disco album, and features the newest technology of the time, including the LM-2 drum machine, Moog bass and Oberheim OB-X synthesizer. Its songs talk mostly about love and partying. Five singles were released from the album: &quot;Everybody&quot; and &quot;Burning Up&quot; were published months before it was completed; neither song made a major impact on the charts. &quot;Holiday&quot; was Madonna&#x27;s big breakout single, followed by &quot;Lucky Star&quot; and &quot;Borderline&quot;.

Upon release, &quot;Madonna&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics, who highlighted its dance-oriented nature and sound. In the United States, it peaked at number eight on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified five-times Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It reached the Top 10 of the charts in Australia, France, the Netherlands, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, and has sold an estimated 10 million copies worldwide. Between 1983 and 1984, Madonna promoted the album and singles through a series of live appearances in nightclubs and television programs across the United States and Europe. The singles were then performed on the Virgin Tour of 1985, Madonna&#x27;s first concert tour. In retrospective reviews, &quot;Madonna&quot; has been referred to as one of the greatest debut albums of all time, and one of the best albums from the 1980s. Critics have also said that it helped to make dance music popular again, and &quot;set the standard&quot; of dance-pop for decades afterwards; its influence can be seen in the work of female artists such as Janet Jackson, Debbie Gibson, Kylie Minogue, and Lady Gaga.

== Background ==

In 1979, Madonna was trying to establish her music career in New York City. She was the drummer of a band called Breakfast Club, which was headed by the Gilroy brothers, Dan and Ed. The following year, after a dispute with Dan, Madonna left the band. She then called her former Michigan boyfriend Stephen Bray, who &quot;readily&quot; agreed to join her on New York. Along with Gary Burke and Brian Syms, they formed a band called The Millionaires. Then, when the Gilroy brothers rejoined the group, they changed their name to Emmy, another of Madonna&#x27;s many nicknames. In 1981, after attending one of Emmy&#x27;s gigs at Max&#x27;s Kansas City, Adam Alter and Camille Barbone from Gotham Records signed a contract with Madonna, who at this point already had a &quot;small downtown cult following in the gay scene&quot;. However, the association was short-lived and dissolved the following year due to creative differences between the label and singer: Gotham was interested in rock and roll whereas Madonna wanted to pursue disco.

By 1982, the singer was living with Bray in an unused rehearsal studio. After coming to the realization that &quot;funky dance records were in style on the radio and dance floor&quot;, they created a demo tape with four dance tracks, including &quot;Everybody&quot;, &quot;Burning Up&quot;, and &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Big Deal&quot;, which was described as a &quot;bright Michael Jackson/Donna Summer confection&quot;. With no record label to back her up, Madonna began pitching the tape on her own, visiting local nightclubs trying to get DJs to play it. She managed to get Mark Kamins, the resident DJ at Danceteria nightclub, to play &quot;Everybody&quot;, which was met with a positive reception from the crowd. Kamins promised Madonna he would help her get a record deal on the condition that he would get to produce it. As he was also an A&amp;R scout for Island Records, Kamins took the tape to his boss Chris Blackwell, but he wasn&#x27;t impressed nor interested in signing Madonna.

Kamins then approached Sire Records president Seymour Stein, who at the time was at Lenox Hill Hospital recovering from a heart surgery. Stein had his secretary send the tape to the hospital so he could listen to it; &quot;I liked the hook, I liked Madonna&#x27;s voice, I liked the feel [...] I liked it all and played it again&quot;, the executive recalled. He signed the singer on for three twelve-inch singles with an option for albums; she would get $15,000 for each one, but would also have to pay for all recording costs. Sire A&amp;E executive Michael Rosenblatt, who oversaw the entire process, wanted to release a double-sided single with &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Big Deal&quot; as A-side and &quot;Everybody&quot; as B-side. &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Big Deal&quot;, however, &quot;did not come out well&quot;, so Roseneblatt decided to put &quot;Everybody&quot; on both sides of the record: One version lasted 5:56, while the other was a dub form with a duration of 9:23. Since he had recorded the demo, Bray argued that he should be the producer for the single, but Stein decided to appoint Kamins, &quot;for the sheer interest of seeing where it would go&quot;. Kamins, however, wasn&#x27;t interested in producing, wanting to focus on A&amp;R instead; he approached musician Kashif to see if he was interested in working on the song, but he turned down the offer. &quot;Everybody&quot; was released as Madonna&#x27;s debut single on October 6, 1982. It failed to enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at number 107 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100. It was more successful on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Dance Club Songs chart, where it reached the third spot. Music promotor Boby Shaw recalled that, &quot;[&#x27;Everybody&#x27;] made noise enough to give her an album deal&quot;.

== Development and recording ==
According to Michael Rosenblatt, he wanted the album to have an &quot;R&amp;B feel&quot;, hence he brought in Warner Bros. producer Reggie Lucas, who had worked with artists like Roberta Flack and Stephanie Mills. Rosenblatt also felt Madonna needed to work with someone who &quot;could really help her with her vocals. Mark [Kamins]&#x27;s strength was grooves, not working with a girl who&#x27;s never been in the studio before&quot;. Upon meeting her, Lucas wasn&#x27;t impressed with the singer&#x27;s &quot;boho-punk style&quot;, and thought she didn&#x27;t seem &quot;particularly avant-garde&quot;. &quot;Everybody&quot; was recorded at the Bob Blank&#x27;s Blank Tape Recording Studios in April 1982, in a span of three days. Barry Eastmond had been hired as the track&#x27;s arranger, but left the project after getting into an argument with Madonna; she felt his work was &quot;too slick&quot;, and lacked the &quot;edge of the club-land grooves she was hankering after&quot;. Rosenblatt made the decision to replace Eastmond&#x27;s keyboard parts, and it was Arthur Baker, an assistant to Kamins, who brought in Fred Zarr to redo all the keyboards.

The rest of the songs were recorded at the Sigma Sound Studios in New York. Prior to entering the studio, Madonna wrote three more songs for the album: &quot;Lucky Star&quot;, &quot;Think of Me&quot; and &quot;I Know It&quot;. The lyrics to &quot;Lucky Star&quot; were written on a yellow legal notepad, while the music was created on a Casiotone keyboard with a cassette player Kamins had given Madonna. She wrote it as a thank you to him, and with the hope that he&#x27;d play it in his sets at Danceteria. One of the earliest recorded versions of &quot;Lucky Star&quot; Madonna and Lucas created was described as being very &quot;R&amp;B-leaning&quot;, while another one was heavy on guitars, but due to a negative experience involving Madonna and a rock guitarist, was quickly discarded. Soon however, the singer realized there were not enough songs for the record, to which Lucas then brought two compositions of his own: &quot;Physical Attraction&quot; and &quot;Borderline&quot;, written specifically for Madonna. The latter was the first song where Lucas used a drum machine instead of a drummer; he and Madonna worked on the track while she was staying at artist Jean-Michel Basquiat&#x27;s apartment. Problems between the singer and Lucas arose, as she felt he was &quot;moving [the songs] away from the sparse form of the original demos&quot;, something she did not approve of; the producer ended up leaving the project without altering the tracks. The singer then invited John &quot;Jellybean&quot; Benitez, her boyfriend at the time, to work and remix the remaining songs. In the case of &quot;Burning Up&quot; and &quot;Lucky Star&quot;, Benitez added extra guitar riffs and additional vocals; for the latter he also added a &quot;synthesized disco beat with soulful flourishes&quot;, and elements of New Wave.

Another issue arose after Madonna learned Bray had sold &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Big Deal&quot; to disco act Barracuda, thus rendering it unavailable for her album. Benitez approached Curtis Hudson and Lisa Stevens-Crowder from band Pure Energy, and asked them for a song. Titled &quot;Holiday&quot;, the track was written by Hudson and Stevens-Crowder for Pure Energy, but their label Prism Records decided not to record it. &quot;Holiday&quot; had been previously offered to Mary Wilson from The Supremes, and Phyllis Hyman. After she was given the demo, Madonna quickly recorded the vocals. Benitez assembled the musicians, hummed the music to them, and asked the singer to sing in a &quot;very soulful approach&quot;. Hudson played guitar, and his brother Raymond the bass; Madonna herself played the cowbell that can be heard towards the beginning, while background vocals were provided by Norma Jean Wright and Tina Baker. Just before it was completed, Benitez and Madonna took the tape to Zarr, so he could add what the singer referred to as &quot;Zarrisms&quot;: &quot;creative flourishes&quot; that would provide the &quot;finishing touches&quot;, which ended up being a piano solo towards the end.

== Composition ==

AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine and Sal Cinquemai from &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; noted that &quot;Madonna&quot; is a dance-pop post-disco album. Most of its songs talk about &quot;love, heartbreak and hedonism in general&quot;. In his book &quot;The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna&quot;, author Rikky Rookbsy wrote that the record&#x27;s overall sound is &quot;dissonant, upbeat synthetic disco&quot;. Instrumentation includes Linn drum machine, Moog bass and the OB-X synthesizer, some of the newest technology from the time. Opening track &quot;Lucky Star&quot; begins with the sound of a &quot;shimmering, programmed&quot; glissando, which is followed by &quot;clanging rhythm guitars, synth atmospherics, and [a] chugging bass&quot;; the lyrics are a double-entendre and compare a lover&#x27;s &quot;heavenly body&quot; with the stars in the sky, while the &quot;simple&quot; refrain refers the nursery rhyme &quot;Star Light, Star Bright&quot;. Second track &quot;Borderline&quot; has Madonna singing in a more &quot;refined and expressive&quot; way, and lyrically finds a woman complaining of her lover&#x27;s chauvinism. Its sound has been compared to Stephanie Mills″ &quot;Never Knew Love Like This Before&quot; (1980), while the chord progression evokes Bachman-Turner Overdrive&#x27;s &quot;You Ain&#x27;t Seen Nothing Yet&quot; (1974); the inversions are similar to the sound of the 1970s, specifically disco, Philadelphia soul, and the work of Elton John.

&quot;Burning Up&quot; is a &quot;yearning&quot; New wave-influenced dance track, with lyrics that conflate sex with ambition. It has a &quot;starker&quot; arrangement brought about by bass, single guitar and drum machine. Also present are tom-tom drum beats ―similar to the ones used on the work of Phil Collins― and electric guitars. The refrain is a repetition of the same three lines of the lyrics, while the bridge consists of a series of double entendres that describe what she is prepared to do for her lover, showcasing that she &quot;has no shame&quot; and is &quot;not like the others&quot;. Fourth track &quot;I Know It&quot; features &quot;shades of ’60s girl-group melodrama&quot;, with instrumentation from piano and saxophone. In the song, Madonna brushes off a lover who&#x27;s hurt her. The next song is &quot;Holiday&quot;, which talks about the &quot;universal sentiment&quot; that everybody needs a holiday from their daily lives. It has been noted as being &quot;devoid of any particular structure&quot;, and has a chord sequence comparable to that of Cyndi Lauper&#x27;s &quot;Time After Time&quot; (1984). The refrain is sung by the singer in a &quot;completely deadpan&quot; way, while for the verses, she uses her lower register to give the lyrics a &quot;more positive spin&quot;. Present throughout the song are &quot;Chic-styled&quot; guitar flickers, electronic clapping, and synthesized strings.

Sixth track &quot;Think of Me&quot; opens with high staccato piano notes, which are followed by the sound of drums. The R&amp;B influenced song features a &quot;slinky&quot; saxophone solo towards the middle, and has Madonna warning her lover to pay attention to her or else she&#x27;ll leave him. Lasting almost seven minutes, &quot;Physical Attraction is the longest song on the album. It is a medium-paced track, in which Madonna &quot;tellingly offer[s] her permission to take things to the next level&quot; over a &quot;libidinous&quot; bass line. Also present is a spoken section and &quot;Collins-style&quot; drums. Madonna&#x27;s vocals were doubletracked for album closer &quot;Everybody&quot;, which, in her own words, talks about &quot;getting people to dance and lose their inhibitions&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Joe Lynch pointed out that the track &quot;drops the bright, buoyant vibes that characterized the rest of the album and closes it on a dark, sensuous note&quot;.

== Artwork and release ==
According to Mary Cross, &quot;Lucky Star&quot; was the album&#x27;s original title, but Madonna decided to change it, sensing a singular name could have more &quot;star power&quot;. Her mother was also an inspiration, as she&#x27;s &quot;the only other person I have ever heard of named Madonna [...] It&#x27;s pretty glamorous&quot;. The original cover was shot by photographer Edo Bertoglio, while the sleeve was designed by Madonna&#x27;s friend Martin Burgoyne. According to Seymour Stein, however, Madonna dismissed this cover as it &quot;just wasn&#x27;t iconic enough&quot;. The official cover was shot by photographer Gary Heery and directed by Carin Goldberg. The image shows Madonna with short-cropped platinum hair, wearing a number of black rubber bangles on her hands and a dog chain around her throat. A journalist from &quot;Radio &amp; Records&quot; described the singer as looking like &quot;Marilyn Monroe crossed with Jean Harlow&quot; in the image. The singer&#x27;s navel is also prominent on the inner sleeve; she commented: &quot;The picture inside the dust of sleeve of my first album has me, like, in this Betty Boop pose with my belly button showing. Then when people reviews the album, they kept talking about my cute belly button. [...] I think there are other unobvious places on the body that are sexy and the stomach is kind of innocent.&quot; Regarding the album photoshoot, Heery recalled:

[Madonna] arrived at my Broadway studio in New York with a small bag of clothes and jewelry, and no entourage. Then, in front of the camera she was explosive, like a great model, but with her own unique style. She came over the next day to see some prints and the proofs, and there was shot after shot to choose from. We agreed on every choice and whittled it down to the album cover images. I had no idea what I had just been a party to.

&quot;Madonna&quot; was released by Sire Records on July 27, 1983. The singer dedicated the album to her father, Tony Ciccone, with whom her relationship had not been good up until the release. In an interview with &quot;Time&quot; magazine, Madonna explained: &quot;My father had never believed that what I was doing here [in New York] was worthwhile, nor did he believe that I was up to any good. [...] It wasn&#x27;t until my first album came out and my father started hearing my songs on the radio that he stopped asking the questions&quot;. In 1985, in the &quot;midst of &#x27;Madonnanamania&#x27;&quot;, the album was re-released in Europe, Australasia and certain Asian and Latin American territories as &quot;Madonna: The First Album&quot;, with a different cover created by George Holy. This image shows the singer with crucifixes as earrings. Of this, she said that, &quot;[wearing a crucifix] is kind of offbeat and interesting. I mean, everything I do is sort of tongue-in-cheeks. Besides, [they] seem to go with my name&quot;. On May 22, 2001, Warner Bros. released a remastered version of the album with its original artwork and additional remixes of &quot;Burning Up&quot; and &quot;Lucky Star&quot;. It was reissued on crystal clear vinyl on November 8, 2019.

== Promotion ==
=== Live performances and tour ===
Prior to the album&#x27;s release, Madonna promoted the singles through a series of live appearances in nightclubs and television programs across the United States and Europe. She performed &quot;Everybody&quot; as part of Haoui Montaug&#x27;s No Entiendes cabaret revue on December 18, 1982, on the second-floor stage of Danceteria. In 1983, she travelled to the United Kingdom and presented &quot;Everybody&quot; and &quot;Burning Up&quot; at London&#x27;s Camden Palace, and Manchester&#x27;s The Haçienda. &quot;Holiday&quot; was sung on June 4 at New York&#x27;s Studio 54, and on October 13 at the Camden Palace. The following year, Madonna performed &quot;Holiday&quot; on British television program &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, where she was joined by her brother Christopher Ciccone; she also sang it on &quot;Discoring&quot;, &quot;The Tube&quot;, The Haçienda, and on American television series &quot;American Bandstand&quot; and &quot;Solid Gold&quot;. Finally, in February 1984, Madonna appeared on &quot;The Dance Show&quot; and performed &quot;Borderline&quot;, joined by her brother, and dancer Erika Belle.

The album&#x27;s singles were included on the Virgin tour, Madonna&#x27;s first concert tour, which visited cities in the US and Canada from April to June 1985. Warner Bros. wanted to cash in on the success of Madonna&#x27;s second studio album &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; (1984) and officially announced the tour on April 6. Despite mixed critical reviews, the tour was a commercial success, with &quot;Billboard&quot; reporting a gross of $3.3 million ($ million in dollars); all 17,672 tickets for the concert at New York City&#x27;s Radio City Music Hall sold out in a record-breaking 34 minutes. On top of that, young girls would show up to the concerts dressed in a style similar to Madonna&#x27;s. One of the Detroit concerts was filmed and released in VHS as &quot;Madonna Live: The Virgin Tour&quot;.

=== Singles ===
The twelve-inch single of &quot;Everybody&quot; was released on October 6, 1982. Due to its R&amp;B elements and not including Madonna&#x27;s image on the cover artwork, marketing for the song gave the impression that she was a black artist. That misconception was cleared with the song&#x27;s music video, which was directed by Ed Steinberg, and shows the singer and two backup dancers performing at New York&#x27;s Paradise Garage. &quot;Burning Up&quot; was released in a double-sided single with &quot;Physical Attraction&quot; on March 9, 1983. It was Madonna&#x27;s first top twenty hit in Australia and, like its predecessor, peaked at number three on the Dance Club Songs chart. The music video was directed by Steve Barron and shows the singer writhing submissively in the middle of the street. Some authors noted that the visual was an introduction to the singer&#x27;s &quot;sexual politics&quot;. The double-sided release of &quot;Lucky Star&quot; and &quot;Holiday&quot; was issued on mid August 1983, and became Madonna&#x27;s first number one on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Dance Club Songs chart.

On September 7, &quot;Holiday&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s third stand-alone single. Considered Madonna&#x27;s breakthrough, it was her first entry on the Hot 100, where it reached the 16th position. &quot;Holiday&quot; also reached the top ten in the United Kingdom, where it remains one of Madonna&#x27;s best selling singles. In Europe and the United Kingdom, &quot;Lucky Star&quot; was first published on September 9, whereas in the United States it was released almost one year later, on August 8, 1984. &quot;Lucky Star&quot; peaked at number four on the Hot 100, becoming the singer&#x27;s first top-five hit. The music video was directed by Arthur Pierson, and shows the singer, her brother Christopher, and Belle dancing in front of a white backdrop. Following the clip&#x27;s release, the singer&#x27;s fashion and style became a trend among the young generation of the time.

In the United States, &quot;Borderline&quot; was released on February 15, 1984, as the fourth single from the album; in the United Kingdom, it was published as the album&#x27;s fifth single on June 2, 1984. To &quot;keep the Madonna mania going on&quot;, a second European release was done in January 1986. It was commercially successful: in 1984, it gave Madonna her first top-ten hit on the Hot 100. The 1986 release saw success across Europe - it became the singer&#x27;s second number one in Ireland, and reached the top 3 in the United Kingdom, Belgium and The Netherlands. In the music video, which was directed by Mary Lambert, Madonna portrays the girlfriend of a Hispanic man, to whom she returns after being enticed to pose and model for a white British photographer. Author Douglas Kellner pointed out that with the visual, the singer broke the taboo of interracial relationships.

=== Video compilation ===
A VHS video compilation titled &quot;Madonna&quot; was made available in December 1984; it included the videos for &quot;Borderline&quot;, &quot;Burning Up&quot;, &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;, and a &quot;special extended dance mix&quot; of &quot;Lucky Star&quot;. The release topped &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Music Videocassette chart from April 13 to November 9, 1985, and was the year&#x27;s best selling music videocassette. Additionally, &quot;Madonna&quot; was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of 100,000 units, and was recognized as the &quot;Best Selling Video Cassette Merchandised as Music Video&quot; by the National Association of Recording Merchandisers. According to &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;, the video has sold over one million copies. To promote the release, a party was held on Chicago&#x27;s Cabaret Metro on February 9, 1985. Dubbed &quot;The Virgin Party&quot;, it drew a crowd of around 1,200 people; attendees were encouraged to wear white, and for $5 admission fees, were able to view the &quot;Madonna&quot; videocassette and the music video of the then-upcoming &quot;Material Girl&quot;. The event was organized as a drive to promote music videos, which at that point did not have a large market.

== Critical reception ==
=== Contemporaneous ===

&quot;Madonna&quot; received generally positive reviews. &quot;Billboard&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, among other sources, praised Madonna&#x27;s voice. It was distinctive, made the &quot;pretty standard dance tunes&quot; &quot;a bit special&quot;, and included an addicting &quot;distinguishing feature&quot; of a &quot;girlish hiccup&quot;.

Jeff Simon, music critic for &quot;The Buffalo News&quot;, predicted Madonna would overtake Debbie Harry as &quot;blonde dance-rock queen&quot;. 
The production was also considered high-quality and pristine, its dance style &quot;music-and-motion&quot; and &quot;will go down a storm in discos.&quot; Explained Simon, &quot;she debuts by veering between the electric and pop sides of electro-pop and sounds good either way.&quot; As Marcia Smith opened her review for &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, &quot;combine Madonna&#x27;s vocal energy with a strong, driving beat and you have the makings of this hot dance album.&quot; Less positively, Dave Rimmer of magazine &quot;Smash Hits&quot; argued Madonna&#x27;s music suffered from attempting to be &quot;Madonna Summer&quot;.

An extremely unfavorable review came from &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot;″s Woody Wilson. He derogatorily categorized the genre as &quot;Chipmunks in Discoland&quot;, with a &quot;cross between Brenda Lee and Alvin and the Chipmunks&quot; over an extremely simple drum-machine-and-synth arrangement. When it came to the lyrics, no critic thought they detracted from the experience, but were not Shakespeare-level and could have been better.

=== Retrospective ===

For Matthew Rettenmund, author of &quot;Encyclopedia Madonnica&quot;, &quot;Madonna&quot; is &quot;one of the most auspicious musical debuts of the 80s&quot;. &quot;The Quietus&quot;″ Matthew Lindsay called it one of the singer&#x27;s best and a &quot;simple soundtrack to complicated times&quot;, and Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave it a perfect five-star review for AllMusic. Joseph Earp from Australian website Junkee referred to &quot;Madonna&quot; as &quot;uneven, but in an exciting rather than disappointing way&quot;, &quot;at once endearingly cautious [...] and shockingly self-assured&quot;. While the staff of &quot;The Advocate&quot; highlighted the singles, they felt album cuts such as &quot;I Know It&quot; and &quot;Think of Me&quot;, &quot;sound like B-sides for a Lisa Lisa single&quot;. The album&#x27;s overall tone was reported to be energetic and joyful.

Sal Cinquemani said &quot;Madonna&quot; sounds &quot;just as fresh today as it did almost two decades ago&quot;, while some Madonna book authors thought its production was a &quot;trifle flat&quot; and &quot;now sound rather harsh&quot;. Some 2010s reviews found its 1980 synthpop tropes simultaneously futuristic. Erlewine described its instrumental and vocal elements as &quot;utterly irresistible&quot; combined despite being uninteresting on their own. Also of common discussion was the dance style, which was occasionally categorized as either post-disco, &quot;club-disco&quot; and disco-influenced. Phrases such as &quot;infectiously kinetic&quot; and &quot;really fucking fun&quot; also described it. Jim Farber from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote that Madonna&#x27;s ability to mix it with &quot;peerless pop&quot; had been established on the album and set her apart from other post-disco acts. &quot;Vice&quot; called it &quot;bright, sexy, and unfussy pop [that] doesn&#x27;t falter once&quot;. Some writers thought, even though it was a classic, it was not one of Madonna&#x27;s most mature, with nothing to indicate her later groundbreaking work. Rikky Rooksby, author of &quot;The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna&quot;, dismissed it as &quot;musical candyfloss - okay in the right spot at the right time&quot;.

The vibes of New York City were also felt by critics. One stated it &quot;feels wrenched straight out of Danceteria&quot; and another noticed the &quot;grit&quot; of the city&#x27;s art scene. According to Daryl Easley, in his book &quot;Madonna: Blond Ambition&quot;, &quot;[&quot;Madonna&quot;] represents the heat and rush of a city [New York] and marks the last time [she] would be writing directly at street level&quot;. &quot;Portland Mercury&quot;″s Mark Lore also perceived a punk rock attitude and a similarity to Devo and Gary Numan in its synthesizers.

== Commercial performance ==
In the United States, the album debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart at number 190 on the week of September 3, 1983. It had a slow and steady climb, ultimately peaking at number eight the week ending October 20, 1984, more than a year after its release. &quot;Madonna&quot; also reached the 20th position of the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. Within a year, the album had sold 2.8 million copies in the United States. By the end of 1985, it ranked 25th on the Hot 100. After 17 years since its release, the album was certified five-times Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipment of five million copies across United States. With the advent of the Nielsen SoundScan era in 1991, the album sold a further 450,000 copies as of August 2010. In Canada, the album debuted at number 87 on the &quot;RPM&quot; chart on March 10, 1984. After 6 weeks, on April 14, it reached number 57. &quot;Madonna&quot; re-entered the chart at number 95 on August 4; it reached its peak at 16 during its 29th week on the chart, where it remained for a total of 47 weeks. &quot;Madonna&quot; was 1984&#x27;s 50th best selling album in Canada.

In the United Kingdom, the record debuted at the 85th position of the albums chart on the week ending February 11, 1984; almost two months later, on the week April 20, it reached number 37. On July 13, 1985, following the &quot;Madonna: The First Album&quot; re-release, it re-entered the chart at number 91, eventually peaking at 6 five weeks later. On December, the album was certified Platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for shipment of 300,000 copies. Throughout Europe, the record saw a moderate success; in Spain, despite not charting during its inicial release, it was certified Gold by the Productores de Música de España (PROMUSICAE) association for shipments of 50,000 copies. It wasn&#x27;t until November 2019 that &quot;Madonna&quot; entered the Spanish album charts at number 35. The album reached the top ten of the charts in the Netherlands and France; it saw less success in Sweden and Italy, where it barely cracked the top 50. &quot;Madonna&quot; went on to reach the 14th spot on the European Top 100 Albums chart.

In Australia, the album peaked at the 10th spot of the Kent Music Report albums chart, and received a Triple Platinum certification by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). In New Zealand, it reached the chart&#x27;s sixth spot and was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ). In Japan, &quot;Madonna&quot; reached the 20th position of the Oricon albums chart. In Hong Kong, it was granted a Platinum certification for shipments of 20,000 copies. Worldwide, &quot;Madonna&quot; has sold over 10 million copies.

== Legacy ==

&quot;Madonna&quot; has been referred to as one of the greatest debut albums of all time. It has also been mentioned among the best albums from the 1980s. With the album, the singer has been credited with &quot;revolutionizing&quot; dance music. Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote: &quot;[Madonna&#x27;s] eponymous debut isn&#x27;t simply good, it set the standard for dance-pop for the next 20 years&quot;. Erlewine went on to explain that the album was released in an era where disco was seen as an &quot;anathema&quot; to mainstream music; by incorporating &quot;great pop songs with stylish, state-of-the-art beats&quot;, Madonna had a &quot;huge role in popularizing dance music as &quot;popular&quot; music again&quot;, Erlewine concluded. Similarly, &quot;Spin&quot;″s Michaelangelo Matos said that it &quot;reinvigorated disco for a generation that wanted nothing to do with polyester suits, ending an era and birthing a new one&quot;. Rosenblatt himself went on to explain: &quot;There was disco, and there was new wave. And there was nothing in the middle [...] Madonna was really coming out of the new wave clubs in a way that never really happened before. Nobody was doing the disco/new wave thing, [the] R&amp;B thing the way Madonna did&quot;. The staff of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; added that, &quot;[&quot;Madonna&quot;] put downtown New York electro grooves all over the Top 40&quot;. In &quot;Vice&quot;″s ranking of the &quot;99 Greatest Dance Albums of All Time&quot; —where &quot;Madonna&quot; came in at number 26— the staff concluded that with the record, the singer &quot;provided the New York City dance scene a much needed post-disco palate cleanser and drew the blueprint for future dance pop&quot;. Joey Guerra from the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; elaborated:

The album&#x27;s blend of pop, disco, New Wave and R&amp;B is ubiquitous today. But at the time, it was a revelation. Disco had been metaphorically demolished a few years earlier. New Wave was still seen by many as eccentric and weird. Madonna, who came up in New York City&#x27;s club scene, tempered those sounds with her fierce ambition and desire to be a superstar.
Santiago Fouz-Hernández and Freya Jarman-Ivens, authors of &quot;Madonna&#x27;s Drowned Worlds&quot;, wrote that the album features &quot;several key trends that have continued to define [Madonna&#x27;s] success [...] a strong dance-based idiom, catchy hooks [and] highly polished arrangements&quot;. They came to the conclusion that the singer introduced a style of &quot;upbeat dance music&quot; that would prove &quot;particularly appealing&quot; to gay audiences. &quot;Paste&quot;″s Matt Michell declared: &quot;Without &quot;Madonna&quot;, the landscape of dance music suffers greatly. It’s the best debut album of the 1980s by a woman, and, perhaps, one of the greatest debuts of all time&quot;. Both Andrew Morton and Martin Charles Strong agreed that the album helped to make Madonna a household name and to establish her base as an artist. According to some publications, the singer and album&#x27;s influence can be seen in the work of other female artists such as Janet Jackson, Debbie Gibson, Britney Spears, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga and Kylie Minogue. Marcus Wratten from &quot;PinkNews&quot; added: &quot;Her music is, and always will be, the blueprint for the best pop records of our generation. And it all began with &quot;Madonna&quot;&quot;.

For &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Kyle Anderson wrote: &quot;Madonna’s sound, and of course her look, would be heavily copied for years to come, but [the album] heralded something much bigger: the arrival of the pop diva as a singular force who put personality above all else&quot;. Mark Lore added that, &quot;[Madonna] had a confidence and sexuality that hadn&#x27;t been captured since Donna Summer. It was just what pop music needed&quot;. Finally, for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, the album&#x27;s biggest achievement was &quot;introducing the most important female voice in the history of modern music&quot;.

<text>John Elliot Hart (April 4, 1824 – June 11, 1863) was an officer in the Union Navy during the American Civil War. He died in June 1863 on board his ship USS &quot;Albatross&quot; while taking part in the Union attempt to blockade the Mississippi River. He is best known for the unusual circumstances of his burial in Louisiana, which the town of St. Francisville, Louisiana, commemorates every year in a three-day festival called &quot;The Day the War Stopped.&quot;

==Early life==
Hart was born in 1824 in New York City to a family with 200-year roots there. His father was Benjamin Franklin Hart and his mother was Sarah Ann Copp. The family had a strong Navy tradition. His grandfather John Elliot Copp, for whom he was named, and his uncle Ezekiel Bishop Hart were both killed serving in the Navy during the War of 1812.

He moved to Schenectady, New York, in the 1850s, and in 1855 he married Harriet &quot;Hattie&quot; Van Vorst, the mayor&#x27;s daughter. They had one surviving child, Abraham Elliot Hart, as well as a son and daughter who died in infancy. In 1857 he joined the local Masonic lodge and rose to the rank of Master.

==Naval career==
Hart was appointed a midshipman in the Navy on February 2, 1841. He served in the Brazil Squadron aboard USS &quot;Marion&quot; and USS &quot;John Adams&quot;, and in 1846 he circumnavigated the globe aboard USS &quot;Constitution&quot;. In late 1846 he was admitted to the newly opened United States Naval Academy and graduated as a Passed Midshipman in the class of 1847.

He served on various ships including USS &quot;St. Lawrence&quot;, USS &quot;Michigan&quot;, and USS &quot;Jamestown&quot;. While serving on &quot;Jamestown&quot; he was promoted to Lieutenant. He took a leave of absence in the late 1850s, then served in the Mediterranean aboard USS &quot;Iroquois&quot;.

Following the outbreak of the Civil War he served aboard USS &quot;Vincennes&quot;, and was part of the West Gulf Blockading Squadron on the Mississippi River under Admiral David Farragut. He was appointed a Lieutenant Commander on July 16, 1862. In August 1862 he was transferred to the gunship USS &quot;Albatross&quot;, and in October 1862 he was put in command of &quot;Albatross&quot; when the captain was relieved of his post. The &quot;Albatross&quot; and other ships engaged two Confederate steamers in the Red River near Fort DeRussey on May 4, 1863. It was later claimed that &quot;Albatross&quot; had shelled St. Francisville under Hart&#x27;s command, but no such incident can be found in the ship&#x27;s log, and the historic shelling of St. Francisville actually took place in January 1864, six months after his death.

==Death and burial==
In June 1863, while &quot;Albatross&quot; was stationed above Port Hudson, Louisiana, he contracted yellow fever. A few days later he became delusional, and on June 11, 1863, he committed suicide in his cabin with his own revolver. He was officially listed as &quot;killed in battle.&quot;

His officers were unable to send his body home to Schenectady for burial, and knowing he would wish a Masonic burial, Executive Officer Theodore B. Dubois went ashore under a flag of truce to ask if there were any Masons in the area who would conduct a funeral. They were put in contact with Confederate Army Captain William Walter Leake, a company commander with the 1st Louisiana Cavalry, who was home on furlough. Leake was Senior Warden of Feliciana Lodge No. 31 in the nearby town of St. Francisville, and he made arrangements for Hart to be buried at Grace Episcopal Church there. A truce was arranged so that the Union officers could bring his body ashore, attend the funeral, and return to their ship to resume their blockade. A joint party of Union and Confederate officers, all Masons, participated in the funeral on June 12, 1863. The pastor of Grace Church, Rev. Daniel S. Lewis, conducted an Episcopal service, and Leake as acting Master of the lodge led the Masonic service.

Leake, who later became Master of the St. Francisville lodge, maintained Hart&#x27;s grave and decorated it with flowers for the next 49 years, until his own death in 1912. Leake was buried near Hart, and the two former enemies are commemorated with a single marble slab, placed in 1955 by the Grand Lodge of the State of Louisiana and &quot;dedicated to the universality of Freemasonry.&quot;

In 1906 Hart&#x27;s son Abraham Elliot Hart, who had been 7 when his father died, learned from his mother about his father&#x27;s burial by a Confederate officer. The son, who went by the name A. Elliot Hart, wrote to Leake, who still lived in St. Francisville, to thank him for his service to his fallen father. He said he had only then learned about it and that Leake&#x27;s kindness had made a profound impression on him.

Frank Karwowski, the historian of the Masonic lodge in Schenectady, became interested in the story and began researching it. In 1999 he and the St. Francisville lodge cooperated in staging a reenactment of the truce and burial, billed as &quot;The Day the War Stopped;&quot; the tradition has been continued annually in June ever since. It is now a three-day festival with lectures and a parade in addition to the re-enactments. Karwowski himself plays Hart for a talk on Friday night and Hart&#x27;s second-in-command Dubois for the funeral re-enactment on Saturday. Members of the St. Francisville lodge portray Leake; past portrayers have included a U.S. Congressman and Leake&#x27;s great-great-grandson. During the 2000s Karwowski began to contact descendants of Hart and Leake, inviting them to attend the re-enactment weekend, and several have done so, particularly in 2013 for the 150th anniversary of the event.

==Namesake==
USS &quot;Hart&quot; (DD-110) was named for him and his uncle Ezekiel B. Hart.

<text>John Atherton (1598 – 5 December 1640) was the Anglican Bishop of Waterford and Lismore in the Church of Ireland. He and John Childe (his steward and tithe proctor) were both tried and executed for buggery in 1640.

==Life and death==

=== Early life and education ===
Atherton was born in 1598 in Somerset, England. His father, also named John was a parson and Rector of Bawdrip. He studied at the University of Oxford and joined the ranks of the Anglican clergy, serving as Rector of Huish Champflower.

=== Career in the Anglican clergy ===
In 1630, he became prebendary of the Church of St. John the Evangelist in Dublin, in addition, Chancellor of the Anglican Diocese of Killaloe. In 1634, chancellor of Christ Church Cathedral and rector of Killaban and Ballintubride in 1635.

In 1636, under the patronage of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford, he became Bishop of Waterford and Lismore in the Church of Ireland under the protests of the Roman Catholic majority in his see.

After the Buggery Act 1533 was found in 1631, during the Mervyn Tuchet, 2nd Earl of Castlehaven case, to not apply to Ireland, Atherton pushed for the enactment of &quot;An Act for the Punishment for the Vice of Buggery&quot; in 1634.

=== Downfall ===
In 1640 Atherton was accused of buggery with a man, John Childe, his steward and tithe proctor. Even though his fellow clerics attempted to prevent his trial to save the reputation of his Church, they were the first to have been tried under the law that Atherton himself had helped to institute.

They were found guilty and both condemned to death, to the applause of the crowd, with Atherton being nearly lynched on his way to prison at Cork.

Nicholas Bernard, Dean of Elphin and Ardagh, acted as his spiritual counselor and wrote an account of Atherton&#x27;s final days. Atherton was executed by hanging on Oxmantown Green, Dublin, after reading the morning service for his cellmates. Reportedly, he confessed about the crime to the priest ministering him immediately before his execution, although he had proclaimed his innocence before that and kept doing so during the execution.

== Legacy ==

=== Character assassination and conspiracy ===
Since 1710, some historical evidence has been developed that shows Atherton might have been a victim of a conspiracy to discredit him and his patrons. This was attributable to Atherton&#x27;s status as an astute lawyer, who sought to recover lost land for the relatively weak Protestant Church of Ireland during the 1630s. Unfortunately for Atherton, this alienated him from large landowners, who then allegedly used his sexuality to discredit him. The conspiracy has been alleged to have been led by a lawyer named Butler, over land in Killoges, near Waterfeld. Butler became insane after the execution, claiming to see Atherton at all time.

English Puritan, Congregationalist and Independent activists, as well as English and Scottish Presbyterian activists, contemporaneously campaigned to abolish Episcopacy (bishops) within the embattled Church of England, Church of Scotland and Church of Ireland; notionally expediting the political interest in Atherton&#x27;s downfall.

Posthumous accusations of sexual wrongdoing also include allegations of &quot;incest&quot; with his sister-in-law, and infanticide of the resultant child, as well as zoophilia with cattle. However, these allegations began to be circulated several months after his death in an anonymous pamphlet, and may have been intended to further discredit the bishop&#x27;s campaign to restore the finances of the Church of Ireland.

=== Legends ===
A legend had him linked to the Old Mother Leakey, a Somerset ghost accused of shipwrecking.

Another legend describes the house of Butler, the lawyer who allegedly led the conspiracy against Atherton, as being haunted by the ghost of the bishop.

<doc id="1159906" wikidata="Q5329748" url="?curid=1159906" title="East and West Riding Regiment">
<text>The East and West Riding Regiment was a regiment of the British Territorial Army from 1999 to 2006. In 2006, it was re-designated as the 4th Battalion The [[Yorkshire Regiment]].

==History==
The regiment was formed in 1999 by the amalgamation of the 3rd Battalion The Prince of Wales&#x27;s Own Regiment of Yorkshire (Yorkshire Volunteers); 3rd Battalion The Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment (Yorkshire Volunteers); and the King&#x27;s Own Yorkshire Yeomanry (Light Infantry) due to the reforms implemented in consequence of the Strategic Defence Review. The regimental headquarters was at Pontefract and the regiment, part of 15 (North East) Brigade, comprised five Rifle Companies:
*Ypres Company (Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment), at Huddersfield and Keighley
*Fontenay Company (Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment), at Barnsley and Sheffield
*Quebec Company (Prince of Wales&#x27;s Own Regiment of Yorkshire), at Hull and Beverley
*Imphal Company (Prince of Wales&#x27;s Own Regiment of Yorkshire), at Worsley Barracks, York and Leeds
*Minden Company (Light Infantry), at Wakefield and Batley

No new cap badge was created for this regiment: soldiers wore their former regimental cap badge or were badged according to the company they joined. The regimental crest was a combination of the Light Infantry and the Prince of Wales&#x27;s Own Regiment of Yorkshire cap badges and crest from the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment. During the summer of 2004 the regiment adopted a single Tactical Recognition Flash (TRF) of the White Rose of Yorkshire on a black background (this design was previously used by the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division between the First and early in the Second World War). The official Army abbreviation for the regiment was &quot;E and WRR&quot;.

In November 2004, the regiment dispatched a composite company (Normandy Company) to Basra, Iraq as part of 4th Mechanized Brigade of the Multi-National Division (South East) for a 6-month tour-of-duty.

===Prior to re-designation===
Two months prior to being re-designated as the 4th Battalion of The Yorkshire Regiment, the two Yorkshire companies of the Tyne-Tees Regiment were integrated into the structure of the regiment, and some of the regiment&#x27;s companies were converted into other units; furthermore, the regimental HQ moved to York. This was to ease the re-designation process in June 2006. After this re-structuring, the regiment&#x27;s structure was as follows:
*HQ Company (later renamed Waterloo Company), at Worsley Barracks, York and Scarborough
*A Company (Prince of Wales&#x27;s Own Regiment of Yorkshire), at Hull, Beverley, and Leeds
*B (Green Howards) Company, at Middlesbrough and Northallerton
*C Company (Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment), at Huddersfield and Keighley
*D Company (Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment), at Barnsley and Sheffield

Minden Company was broken up, with the Company HQ forming 299 Parachute Engineer Squadron, and the Doncaster Platoon formed C (Rifles) Company, 5th Battalion, Royal Regiment of Fusiliers.

==4th Battalion, Yorkshire Regiment==
As part of the Future Infantry Structure (FIS) restructuring of the army announced in 2004, the regiment became the 4th Battalion of the newly created Yorkshire Regiment (14th/15th, 19th and 33rd/76th Foot) on 6 June 2006. The battalion now serves as the reserve infantry battalion for North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, and the East Riding of Yorkshire, with sub-units dispersed throughout all four counties. 

===Current structure===
The current structure is as follows:
*Alma Company, at Halifax Barracks, Hull
**Rifle Platoon, at Worsley Barracks, York
*Burma Company, at Fontenay Barracks, Barnsley
**Rifle Platoon, at Sheffield
*Corunna Company, at Huddersfield
**Rifle Platoon, at Belle Vue Barracks, Bradford
**Rifle Platoon, at Harewood Barracks, Leeds
*Helmand Company, at Worsley Barracks, York
*Quebec Company, at Middlesbrough

<doc id="1159922" wikidata="Q747501" url="?curid=1159922" title="Plinian eruption">
<text>Plinian eruptions or Vesuvian eruptions are volcanic eruptions marked by their similarity to the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD, which destroyed the ancient Roman cities of Herculaneum and Pompeii. The eruption was described in a letter written by Pliny the Younger, after the death of his uncle Pliny the Elder.

Plinian/Vesuvian eruptions are marked by columns of volcanic debris and hot gases ejected high into the stratosphere, the second layer of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. The key characteristics are the ejection of a large amount of pumice and very powerful continuous gas-driven eruptions.

Short eruptions can end in less than a day, but longer events can continue for several days or months. The longer eruptions begin with production of clouds of volcanic ash, sometimes with pyroclastic surges. The amount of magma ejected can be so large that it depletes the magma chamber below, causing the top of the volcano to collapse, resulting in a caldera. Fine ash and pulverized pumice can be deposited over large areas. Plinian eruptions are often accompanied by loud sounds. The sudden discharge of electrical charges accumulated in the air around the ascending column of volcanic ashes also often causes lightning strikes, as depicted by the English geologist George Julius Poulett Scrope in his painting of 1822 or observed during 2022 Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha&#x27;apai eruption and tsunami.

The lava is usually dacitic or rhyolitic, rich in silica. Basaltic, low-silica lavas rarely produce Plinian eruptions unless specific conditions are met (low magma water content &lt;2%, moderate temperature, and rapid crystallization); a recent basaltic example is the 1886 eruption of Mount Tarawera on New Zealand&#x27;s North Island.

==Pliny&#x27;s description==

Pliny the Younger described the initial observations of his uncle, Pliny the Elder, of the 79 AD eruption of Mount Vesuvius:

Pliny the Elder set out to rescue the victims from their perilous position on the shore of the Bay of Naples, and launched his galleys, crossing the bay to Stabiae (near the modern town of Castellammare di Stabia). Pliny the Younger provided an account of his death, and suggested that he collapsed and died through inhaling poisonous gases emitted from the volcano. His body was found interred under the ashes of the eruption with no apparent injuries on 26 August, after the plume had dispersed, which would be consistent with asphyxiation or poisoning, but also with a heart attack, asthma attack, or stroke.

==Examples==
* The Long Valley Caldera eruption in Eastern California, United States, which happened over 760,000 years ago.
* The 10,950 BC eruption of Lake Laach in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany.
* The 4860 BC eruption forming Crater Lake in Oregon, United States.
* The 1645 BC eruption of Thera in the south Aegean Sea, Greece.
* The 400s BC eruption of the Bridge River Vent in British Columbia, Canada.
* The 79 AD eruption of Mount Vesuvius in Pompeii, Italy. It was the prototypical Plinian eruption.

== Ultra-Plinian ==

In 1980, volcanologist George P. L. Walker proposed the Hatepe eruption as the representative of a new class called ultra-Plinian deposits, based on its exceptional dispersive power and eruptive column height. A dispersal index of 50,000 square kilometres (19,000 sq mi) has been proposed as a cutoff for an ultra-Plinian eruption. In the criteria of Volcanic Explosivity Index, recognizing an eruption as ultra-Plinian would make it at least VEI-5. 

The threshold for ultra-Plinian eruptions is defined by an eruptive column height of , or more recently. The few instances of eruptions that lie at the transition between Plinian and ultra-Plinian include the P3 phase of 1257 Samalas eruption, 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo, the Plinian phase of the Campanian Ignimbrite, Tsankawi Pumice Bed of Tshirege Member of Bandelier Tuff, and the 1902 eruption of Santa María.

The once unequivocal ultra-Plinian classification of the Hatepe eruption has been called into question, with recent evidence showing that it is an artifact of an unrecognized shift in the wind field rather than extreme eruptive vigor.

<text>King Geungusu (died 384, r. 375–384) was the fourteenth king of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea.

== Background and rise to the throne ==
Geungusu was the eldest son of the 13th king Geunchogo, and father to the 15th king Chimnyu and the 16th king Jinsa. In 369, as crown prince, Geungusu led the Baekje armies against invading troops of the northern Korean kingdom Goguryeo, capturing 5,000 prisoners. He pushed on to Pyongyang and Sugok-seong in 371, killing Goguryeo&#x27;s king Gogugwon in battle.

He continued his father&#x27;s policies, and his father&#x27;s alliance with the Jin clan. His chief minister, Jin Godo (眞高道), was the father of his queen, Lady Ai (阿尒夫人).

== Reign ==
During Geungusu&#x27;s reign, Baekje was in hostile relations with its northern neighbor, Goguryeo, because of Baekje&#x27;s attacks on Pyongyang, and the murder of a Goguryeo king during one of the battles. He continued these hostilities as king, taking Pyongyang in 377 with 30,000 men. Had he pushed onto Goguryeo, which was still under turmoil with Gogugwon&#x27;s death, then Baekje would have completed the conquest of Goguryeo.

Baekje continued as the military and economic power it was during his father&#x27;s reign. Geungusu maintained friendly relations with China and Yamato period Japan. He is recorded in the &quot;Nihonshoki&quot; as having sent the noted Baekje scholar Wang In to Japan with copies of the Analects of Confucius and one copy of the Thousand Character Classic. However, on the basis of Korean accounts some believe that this took place decades later, in the reign of King Asin.

There were several astonishing weather-related events during his reign, such as the raining dirt incident in 379. A severe drought in 382 also showed the king&#x27;s love for his people, as he opened up the kingdom&#x27;s food storages and fed the people.

Samguk sagi:
&quot;&quot;King Geungusu was also called Hwisu. Geungusu was the son of King Geunchogo. Previously, Sayu, king of Goguryeo, himself came and invaded. King Geunchogo dispatched the crown prince to repel them, and he reached Bangeolyang and was goiung to give battle. A man from Goguryeo called Sagi, who was originally a man from Baekje and had mistakenly injured the hoof of the king&#x27;s steed, feared punishment and fled to Goguryeo. Returning to Baekje at this time, he told the crown prince, &quot;Their soldiers are many, but all of their numbers are meant to deceive you. The only valiant troops are the ones with the red banners — if you first break them, the other troops will not attack and flee of their own accord.&quot;&quot;
&quot;The crown prince followed his advice, and attacked and put them to a great rout, and he pursued them to the north, reaching all the way to the northwest of the fortress of Sugok. Geneal Makgohae then admonished him, saying &quot;I have heard the taoists say, &quot;Know when you have enough, and you will not be humiliated. Know when to stop, and you will not put yourself in danger. Now we have gained much: why do we need to seek more?&quot;&quot;
&quot;The prince thought it good and stopped, and raised a mound of rocks as a memorium. Then he climbed to the top of it and said to those around him, &quot;After today, who will again come to this place?&quot; The earth there is full of cliffs and rocks, and cracked like the hoof of a horse. Other people, up to the present, stil call this place &quot;the hoofprints of the crown prince.&quot; Geunchogo died in the 30th year of his reign, and Geungusu succeeded him.&quot;&quot;
* 376 AD, The king&#x27;s uncle on his mother&#x27;s side, Jin Godo, was made Minister of the Interior. He was entrusted with matters of the administration. Winter, eleventh month. Goguryeo came and invaded the northern borders.
* 377 AD, winter, tenth month. The king, his general, and 30,000 men invaded Goguryeo and attacked the fortress of Pyongyang. 11th year. Goguryeo came to attack.
* 379 AD, spring, third month. An envoy was sent to the Jin court. This envoy went by sea and ran into a foul wind, and could not reach their destination and so returned. Summer, fourth month. It rained dirt for one day.
* 380 AD, There was a great pestilence. Summer, fifth month. There was a fissure in the earth that was five jang deep and three jang wide. After three days, it closed.
* 382 AD, spring. There was no rain until the sixth month. The people starved, to the point that some sold their children. The king sent public officials to give them grain.
* 384 AD, spring, second month. There were three halos around the sun. Inside the palace, the king struck a great drum. Summer, fourth month. The king died.

<text>The ProFile (codenamed Pippin) is the first hard disk drive produced by Apple Computer, initially for use with the Apple III. The original model had a formatted capacity of 5 MB and connected to a special interface card that plugged into an Apple III slot. In 1983, Apple offered a ProFile interface card for the Apple II, with software support for Apple ProDOS and Apple Pascal.

Additionally, in 1983, Apple introduced the Lisa computer, which was normally sold with a ProFile. The ProFile could be connected to the built-in parallel port of the Lisa, or to a port on an optional dual-port parallel interface card. Up to three such interface cards could be installed, so in principle up to seven ProFile drives could be used on a Lisa.

The 5 MB ProFile was Apple&#x27;s first hard drive, and was introduced in September 1981 at a price of . Later, a 10 MB model was offered, but required an upgraded PROM/interface card to recognize the additional 5 MB.

Internally, the ProFile consisted of a bare Seagate ST-506 stepper motor drive and mechanism, without the usual Seagate electronics, a digital and an analog circuit board designed and manufactured by Apple, and a power supply.

Later Lisa models could be configured with an internal 10 MB &quot;Widget&quot; voice-coil drive with a proprietary controller designed and built entirely by Apple, but the Widget was never offered as an external product for use with other Apple computers.

Apple did not offer another hard drive until it released the Hard Disk 20 designed specifically for the Macintosh 512K in September 1985 which could not be used on the Apple II or III families, or Lisa series. The ProFile could not be used on the Macintosh or the Apple IIc (for which Apple never offered an external hard disk drive of any kind).

By September 1986, the ProFile would be superseded by the introduction of the first cross-platform Hard Disk 20SC SCSI-based drive for the Macintosh and interface card for the Apple II family (excluding the IIc series, which had no SCSI interface of any kind) and Lisa/XL series.

<text>Gillis van Coninxloo (now also referred to as Gillis van Coninxloo II but previously referred to as Gillis van Coninxloo III) (24 January 1544 – January 1607) was a Flemish painter of landscapes who played an important role in the development of Northern landscape art at the turn of the 17th century. He spent the last 20 years of his life abroad, first in Germany and later in the Dutch Republic.

==Life==
He was born in Antwerp and studied under Pieter Coecke van Aelst, Lenaert Kroes and Gillis Mostaert. He travelled in France after completing his training. He became a member of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke in 1570 and worked in Antwerp until 1585 when Antwerp fell to the Spanish. He left first for Middelburg and then in 1587 for Frankenthal where he was active until 1595. He then moved to Amsterdam where he died in 1607.

He had many pupils including Pieter Brueghel the Younger, Govert Govertsz van Arnhem, Willem van den Bundel, Gillis van Coninxloo III, Jonas van Merle, Hercules Seghers and Jacques van der Wijen.

==Work==

Coninxloo ranks as one of the most important Flemish landscape painters of around the turn of the 17th century. He exercised a strong influence on Jan Brueghel the Elder, Pieter Schoubroeck, Roelandt Savery, and other Flemish and Dutch landscape painters of this period.

His early landscapes were often Northern Mannerist versions of the established world landscape type, though with close views of trees already narrowing the panoramic view. Beginning in the 1590s Coninxloo introduced a new approach into Flemish landscape painting, with close-up views of forests reminiscent of Albrecht Altdorfer and the Danube school nearly a century earlier and almost or entirely shutting out a distant view. While earlier forest landscapes had used forests as the backdrop for human activity, van Coninxloo turned them into the subject proper by submerging tiny human figures in elaborate compositions of trees on a hugely exaggerated scale. A &quot;Forest Landscape&quot; of 1598 in the Liechtenstein Collection is the first work to take this approach to its extreme: the sky is only visible in a few patches between branches and a single tiny human figure reclines under a tree. This painting achieves great intensity and atmospheric quality through its fine shades of brown and green and its accentuated handling of light.

During his stay in Frankenthal from 1588 to 1595, he influenced several better known Flemish émigré landscape painters, who are now collectively referred to as the &#x27;Frankenthal School&#x27;. The early 17th century art historian Karel van Mander wrote about Coninxloo in his &quot;Schilder-boeck&quot;. Van Mander stated that Coninxloo&#x27;s teacher Pieter Coeke van Aelst was his cousin, and that &quot;I know at this time of no better landscape painter, and I notice that they are following his manner very much in Holland&quot;.

The influence of his work spread in Holland by means of his designs for large-scale prints, mainly engraved by Flemish émigré printmakers Nicolaes de Bruyn and Jan van Londerseel who published in the Dutch Republic.

==Works==
Some of his paintings are:
* &quot;The Judgment of Midas&quot; (Dresden)
* &quot;Latona&quot; (Hermitage, St. Petersburg)
* &quot;Landscape with Venus and Adonis&quot; (Frankenthal)
* &quot;&quot;Landscape with Duck Hunters&quot; (Saarland Museum, Saarbrücken)&quot;

He was sworn in as the 13th Sergeant Major of the Army on January 15, 2004. Preston served 7 years and 2 months as Sergeant Major of the Army (January 2004-March 2011) making him the longest serving Sergeant Major of the Army to date.

<text>Spiraea tomentosa, commonly known as steeplebush, meadowsweet, or hardhack, or eastern hardhack, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States and Canada.

==Description==
&quot;Spiraea tomentosa&quot; grows to up to four feet high and prefers moist to wet soil and full sun. It blooms in summer. Each tiny, pink flower is about 1/16 of an inch wide and arranged in narrow, pyramid-shaped flowerheads that grow up to eight inches long. The flowers are followed by small, dry, brown fruit. The specific epithet &quot;tomentosa&quot; refers to the undersides of the leaves and the stems, which are covered in a dense white-woolly tomentum. It has similar characteristics to &quot;Spiraea douglasii&quot;.

==Ecology==
The plant bug &quot;Plagiognathus fuscosus&quot; breeds on steeplebush. Many bees visit the flowers: &quot;Apis mellifera&quot; (non-native), &quot;Bombus griseocollis&quot;, &quot;Bombus impatiens&quot;, &quot;Lasioglossum atwoodi&quot;, &quot;Lasioglossum hitchensi&quot;, and &quot;Hylaeus mesillae&quot;.

==Uses==
Steeplebush is noted for its astringent properties, which cause it to be used medicinally.

The hardiness zone for this plant is listed as zones 4 to 8.

<text>This is a list of educational, campaigning and community organizations related to BDSM.

Where an organization clearly indicates on its website that membership is restricted by gender or sexual orientation, this is noted. Many BDSM organizations of the social/community variety will require prospective members to attend an &quot;orientation&quot; meeting, where among other things, the organizers will attempt to screen out the obviously unsafe people and those whose interest in BDSM is professional (for example as journalists or law enforcement personnel) rather than personal.

<text>Duncan Nathaniel Ingraham (6 December 1802 – 16 October 1891) was a United States Navy officer who later joined the Confederate States Navy.

==U.S. Navy==
A native of Charleston, South Carolina, Ingraham was appointed midshipman in the U.S. Navy on 18 June 1812 at the age of 10. Ingraham was commissioned captain after years of distinguished service on 14 September 1855. While in command of the sloop-of-war &quot;St. Louis&quot; in the Mediterranean, in July 1853, Ingraham interfered with the detention by the Austrian consul at Smyrna (İzmir, Turkey) of Martin Koszta, a Hungarian who had declared in New York his intention of becoming an American citizen, and, who had been seized and confined in the Austrian ship &quot;Hussar&quot;. For his conduct in this matter, Ingraham was voted thanks and a Gold Medal by Congress.

Ingraham served as Chief of the Bureau of Ordnance and Hydrographer of the Navy from 1856 until 1860.

==Confederate States Navy ==
Ingraham resigned from the U.S. Navy on 4 February 1861 to join the Confederate States Navy as a captain. Ingraham was Chief of the Ordnance Bureau from 1861 to 1863 and Commandant of the Charleston naval station from 1862 to 1865.

Ingraham died at Charleston on 16 October 1891.

==Personal life==
Ingraham&#x27;s father, Nathaniel Ingraham, had also served in the U.S. Navy; he had served on John Paul Jones&#x27;s ship during his famous encounter with the &quot;Serapis&quot;. Duncan married Harriet, a granddaughter of Henry Laurens.

Like many other wealthy South Carolinians, Duncan Ingraham enslaved people.

==Legacy==
Four ships of the U.S. Navy have been named USS &quot;Ingraham&quot;.

Ingraham Street in Bushwick, Brooklyn is probably named after him.

<doc id="1159997" wikidata="Q238959" url="?curid=1159997" title="You Can Dance">
<text>You Can Dance is the first remix album by American singer and songwriter Madonna. It was released on November 17, 1987, by Sire Records. The album contains remixes of tracks from her first three studio albums—&quot;Madonna&quot; (1983), &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; (1984) and &quot;True Blue&quot; (1986)—and a new track, &quot;Spotlight&quot;. In the 1980s, remixing was still a new concept. The mixes on &quot;You Can Dance&quot; exhibited a number of typical mixing techniques. Instrumental passages were lengthened to increase the time for dancing and vocal phrases were repeated and subjected to multiple echoes. The album cover denoted Madonna&#x27;s continuous fascination with Hispanic culture.

After its release, &quot;You Can Dance&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics, some of whom noted how the already known songs appeared to them in a complete new structure, calling it an essential album to be played at parties. &quot;You Can Dance&quot; was a commercial success, earning a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipment of a million copies, and reaching the top twenty of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It reached the top ten of the album charts of France, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway and the United Kingdom. 

It went on to sell five million copies worldwide, making it the second best-selling remix album of all time, behind only &quot;Blood on the Dance Floor&quot; from Michael Jackson. &quot;Spotlight&quot; was the only commercial single released from the album, exclusively in Japan. However, the song was released promotionally in the United States, and due to radio play, the song peaked at number 32 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Airplay chart. &quot;You Can Dance&quot; has been credited for setting the standard with remix albums afterward, both in terms of concept and commercial success on record charts.

==Background==
In October 1986, Sire Records announced that a 6-track EP called &quot;You Can Dance&quot; would be released a month or so before Christmas of that year, and would feature the new track &quot;Spotlight&quot; alongside remixes of five other previously released songs. However, the following month, the release was postponed, with Sire opting to continue promotion of Madonna&#x27;s third studio album &quot;True Blue&quot; (1986). &quot;Billboard&quot; reported that the release was &quot;still in the production stages&quot; and that it would likely see a release in the spring of 1987. &quot;Billboard&quot; also confirmed which remixes would be featured on the release and added that a non-remixed song from &quot;Madonna&quot; (1983) would also be included, which was &quot;likely&quot; to be &quot;Physical Attraction&quot;. The album was finally released in November 1987 by Warner Bros. Records and Sire Records.

&quot;You Can Dance&quot; was Madonna&#x27;s first retrospective release and was aimed at the dance segment of her audience. By the mid-eighties, post-disco dance music was extremely popular and the concept of remix was widely regarded as a new direction of music. Improvements in studio technologies meant the possibility of shaping a song in new ways after it had been recorded. A particular vocal phrase could be endlessly copied, repeated, chopped up, transposed up and down in pitch and given more echo, reverberation, treble or bass.

==Development==

Six of Madonna&#x27;s previously released tracks were chosen for the release: &quot;Holiday&quot;, &quot;Everybody&quot; and &quot;Physical Attraction&quot; from &quot;Madonna&quot; (1983), &quot;Into the Groove&quot; and &quot;Over and Over&quot; from &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; (1984), and &quot;Where&#x27;s the Party&quot; from &quot;True Blue&quot; (1986). Along with the previously released tracks, the never-before released song &quot;Spotlight&quot; was included as the album&#x27;s opening track. Written by Madonna, Stephen Bray and Curtis Hudson, &quot;Spotlight&quot; was originally recorded during the &quot;True Blue&quot; recording sessions. &quot;You Can Dance&quot; was also the first North American-released Madonna album that contained &quot;Into the Groove&quot;, which was only included on international reissues of &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; in 1985.

Sequencing for the album was provided by Madonna&#x27;s old friend and producer John &quot;Jellybean&quot; Benitez. Benitez also provided remix production for the songs &quot;Spotlight&quot; and &quot;Holiday&quot;. Benitez said that he had always wanted to remix &quot;Holiday&quot;. Shep Pettibone remixed &quot;Where&#x27;s The Party&quot; and &quot;Into the Groove&quot; on &quot;You Can Dance&quot; and had previously remixed Madonna&#x27;s 1986 single &quot;True Blue&quot; for its single release. Pettibone said that he was &quot;overjoyed&quot; to have been asked to remix &quot;Into the Groove&quot;, noting: &quot;When I was mixing &#x27;True Blue&#x27;, I was wishing it could be &#x27;Into the Groove&#x27;&quot;. Of the seven tracks on &quot;You Can Dance&quot;, &quot;Physical Attraction&quot; was the only song that was not remixed for the release.

The album cover denoted Madonna&#x27;s continued fascination with Spanish culture and fashion. She wore a female toreador outfit with a lacy bustier, embroidered bolero jacket and a cummerbund with a flouncy bustle. Jeri Heiden, who had worked on the cover art for &quot;True Blue&quot;, was given the task of editing the photos and making them compatible for appearance in an album cover. Shot by Herb Ritts, the cover showed Madonna again as a platinum blonde. Heiden explained in an interview with &quot;Aperture&quot; magazine in October 2006 that the cover was not meant to be a tie-in with the &quot;True Blue&quot; cover. &quot;It was just Madonna&#x27;s look at the time – Platinum Blonde. And of course the handwriting reappears on that album.&quot; The album sleeve included a free poster and the gold wrap-around liner notes contained approximate running time to indicate the difference between the length of the remix and the original track. Brian Chin, a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; journalist, wrote the liner notes for the album, explaining the process of remix and why the songs were chosen for the track list.

==Composition==

According to Rikky Rooksby, author of &quot;The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna&quot;, &quot;Improvements in studio technology meant that possibilities for shaping the sound after it has been recorded are almost limitless.&quot; The mixes on &quot;You Can Dance&quot; exhibited a number of typical mixing techniques. Instrumental passages were lengthened to increase the time for dancing, which undermined the tighter structure of the original pop song. Vocal phrases were repeated and subjected to multiple echoes, panned across the stereophonic sound outlets. At certain points, almost no music is heard except the drums and at others, the drums are removed with only the hi-hat left to keep time. The first song on the album is &quot;Spotlight&quot; which begins with the sound of drums, bass synths and handclaps, followed by Madonna uttering the words &quot;Spotlight, shine bright&quot;. After the first verse, the sound of keyboard is heard during the chorus. It continues like this through the second verse, which is followed by an interlude featuring vocal echoes, a piano segment and violin phrases. Madonna follows the music played by the piano and utters the words &quot;Pa-da-pa-da-pappa pappa pa pa&quot; in the same melody. The lyrics deal with Madonna making the listener remember that &quot;everybody is a star&quot; and that if one wants to be famous and be under the &quot;spotlight&quot;, the person should sing about it and reality may catch up with him or her. According to the sheet music for the song, is set in the time signature of common time, with a tempo of 100 beats per minute. It is set in the key of F major with Madonna&#x27;s voice spanning from the notes of C5 to B5. &quot;Spotlight&quot; has a basic sequence of Am–C–Am–C–G–F as its chord progression.

The second track is &quot;Holiday&quot;, which Benitez said that he always wanted to remix, commenting &quot;There are new sounds on the 1987 remix [of &#x27;Holiday&#x27;], but it had a groove that needed no improvement.&quot; The sound of the guitar is brought to the front in the remix, with a piano break and a middle section consisting of drum beats. The mix for &quot;Everybody&quot; starts with four repetitions of the vocal hook and then moves into a rhythm centered arrangement. Like &quot;Holiday&quot;, the middle section of &quot;Everybody&quot; features a drum break, with a synth tune backing it up. The word &quot;dance&quot; is echoed and slowed-down continuously through the break, gradually changing into the intermedia verse. At the very end, the drums are pulled out, leaving Madonna repeating the &quot;get up and do your thing&quot; phrase, which hovers over to the intro of the next song &quot;Physical Attraction&quot;. In the &quot;Into the Groove&quot; remix, overdubs are present with the continuous repetition of the phrase &quot;c&#x27;mon&quot;. The first verse does not start until about ninety seconds into the remix. After the first &quot;Now I know you&#x27;re mine&quot; line is sung, there is a percussion break, and repetition of the phrases &quot;step to the beat&quot; and &quot;c&#x27;mon&quot;. The last verse incorporates echoing on the vocals, causing overlap of the phrases. The remix ends with instrumentation from congas, whistles and timbales, giving it a Mexican-influenced ending.

==Promotion==
Compared to her previous releases, Madonna did not heavily promote &quot;You Can Dance&quot;. Radio-friendly edits of each song were issued promotionally on a release titled &quot;You Can Dance (Single Edits of Album Remixes)&quot;. This release remained promotional-only until it received a commercial digital release in 2022. &quot;Spotlight&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s only commercial single on April 25, 1988, exclusively in Japan. &quot;Spotlight&quot; peaked at number 68 on the Oricon weekly singles chart, remaining on the chart for five weeks. It also charted on the Oricon international singles chart, reaching a peak of three on May 19, 1988, staying on the chart for ten weeks.

&quot;Spotlight&quot; was not released as a commercial single in the United States, therefore it was not eligible at the time to appear on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot 100. However, it was released as a promotional single, paired with &quot;Where&#x27;s The Party&quot;. &quot;Spotlight&quot; managed to garner enough airplay to appear on the publication&#x27;s Hot 100 Airplay chart in early 1988. It debuted on the chart at 37 on the issue dated January 16, 1988. After three weeks, &quot;Spotlight&quot; reached a peak of 32 and fell to 40 the next week before exiting the chart. It also appeared on the Hot Crossover 30 chart beginning on the issue dated December 12, 1987, peaking at 15 for two consecutive weeks beginning January 9, 1988 and spending eight weeks on the chart.

==Critical reception==

&quot;You Can Dance&quot; received generally positive reviews from music critics. In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau considered that &quot;the effects, repeats, breaks, and segues added by a star crew of remixers [...] amount to new music—this time the songs don&#x27;t surface, they reach out and grab you&quot;. He also argued that &quot;You Can Dance&quot; reminded the audience that before MTV, they &quot;loved the way she &quot;sounded&quot;&quot;. Many reviewers described the compilation as a being a good fit for playing at parties. Author J. Randy Taraborrelli noted that &quot;&quot;You Can Dance&quot; made one point clear about Madonna. While she was evolving into a serious pop star, musically she still knew how to host the best party.&quot; Richard Harrington from &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the album &quot;an energetic collection of extended dance remixes, that will surely be the highlight of the party crowds flocking around the town.&quot; John Milward from &quot;USA Today&quot; felt that &quot;although the remixes sound a little exhaustive, its nevertheless party time with Madonna&#x27;s album.&quot; Jan DeKnock from the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; predicted that the album would be &quot;one of the big stars of the upcoming holiday party season&quot;.

Timothy Green from &quot;The Miami Herald&quot; said that &quot;Madonna&#x27;s new album isn&#x27;t really new, but rather a collection of danceable hits, remixed by club deejays masterful at that peculiar art of taking the artists&#x27; work, track by track, and reconstructing it.&quot; He also said that &quot;the remixes sound fresh&quot; and that they gave &quot;a new outlook on the already famous and popular songs.&quot; Daniel Brogan from the same newspaper also praised the album, saying that &quot;Madonna has brought a new joy to the people buying gifts for Christmas, as &quot;You Can Dance&quot; is a fun-filled, fast-paced retrospective that will burn the dance floor till New Year.&quot; In a retrospective review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic said that &quot;You Can Dance&quot; &quot;keeps the spotlight on her first record.&quot; He also noted at &quot;some of this now sounds dated—these are quite clearly extended mixes from the mid 80s—but that&#x27;s part of its charm, and it all holds together quite well. Not essential, but fun.&quot;

In the United States, the album was released on November 18, 1987, and reached a peak of number 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The LP cuts debuted at number 41 on the Dance Music/Club Play chart, and moved up to number 17 the next week. The LP cuts ultimately topped the Dance chart, becoming Madonna&#x27;s seventh number one entry. The album was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipment of one million copies across the United States.

In Canada, the album debuted at number 55 on the &quot;RPM&quot; Albums Chart on December 5, 1987. After five weeks, it reached a peak of number 11 on the chart.

It was Madonna&#x27;s fifth top-ten album there present for a total of 16 weeks on the chart, and was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for shipment of 300,000 copies of the album. The album re-entered the chart at number 69, on March 4, 1995, after being released in mid-price in the United Kingdom. Across Europe, the album reached number three on the European Top 100 Albums chart, and the top five in Norway and Netherlands, while charting within the top twenty of Austria, Germany, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. &quot;You Can Dance&quot; also reached number two in France. Worldwide, it went on to sell five million copies, becoming the second best-selling remix album of all time.

==Legacy==

Shortly after its release, Madonna was called &quot;the most important dance artist&quot; by a number of media outlets, and described by pan-European magazine &quot;Music &amp; Media&quot; as &quot;the world&#x27;s most successful artist in bridging the dance and pop audiences&quot;.

Jon O&#x27;Brien from &quot;Billboard&quot; noted Madonna became &quot;the first major pop artist&quot; to release a hits collection with its extended 12&quot; versions. &quot;You Can Dance&quot; is one of the first sets of remixes to be conceived as a full-length album. Matthew Rettenmund, author of &quot;Encyclopedia Madonnica&quot; (1995), complimented rather releasing a greatest-hits album, her first compilation was a &quot;groundbreaking remix album&quot;. The entire concept of copying, repeating, pasting and playing was still in its &quot;infancy&quot; when Madonna released this project. Writing for &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;, Jon O&#x27;Brien stated &quot;Madge was the first genuine superstar to realise the power of the DJ&quot;. Biographer David James commented that &quot;Madonna broke fresh ground&quot;. Daryl Easlea, in &quot;Madonna: Blonde Ambition&quot; (2012) wrote what was particularly successful about &quot;You Can Dance&quot;, is the way the tracks were mixed into a continuous segue, further asserting that &quot;it was very much a forerunner of today&#x27;s club mixes&quot; and that this had been happening in clubs for years, &quot;but Madonna once again popularized a breaking wave by capturing it on vinyl&quot;.

J. Randy Taraborrelli credits Madonna for being part of jump-started the trend of releasing remix albums. According to O&#x27;Brien, Madonna &quot;inspired generations of pop artists to rework their bops for club dance floors&quot;. Shortly after the release of &quot;You Can Dance&quot;, major acts of the day were following suit with their own, including Bobby Brown&#x27;s &quot;Dance!...Ya Know It!&quot;, New Kids on the Block&#x27;s &quot;No More Games/The Remix Album&quot;, Jody Watley&#x27;s &quot;You Wanna Dance with Me?&quot; and Paula Abdul&#x27;s &quot;Shut Up and Dance: Mixes&quot; contributing to the perception that dance remix albums weren&#x27;t viewed as &quot;rarities&quot;. Steffanee Wang from &quot;Nylon&quot; slightly noted its influence on &quot;Club Future Nostalgia&quot; by Dua Lipa. Kelefa Sanneh in &quot;Major Labels: A History of Popular Music in Seven Genres&quot; (2021) describes how she &quot;released a type of record that many of her fans had probably never previously encountered&quot;. Despite this, the album was well received by fans.

Other retrospective assessments specifically praised its impact as a remix album on record charts. Rob Copsey from the Official Charts Company stated that it &quot;set the bar for how it should be done&quot;. Commercially, Easlea wrote that while the record missed out on the US top 10, it still managed to sell more than a million copies—&quot;no mean feat&quot; for a material that had &quot;largely been previously released elsewhere&quot;. Its worldwide results led to it becoming the best-selling remix album for nearly ten years until the release of &quot;Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix&quot; by Michael Jackson.

===Accolades===
According to Wang, &quot;You Can Dance&quot; is one of the first major remix albums in pop music. To O&#x27;Brien, the album is among her &quot;groundbreaking&quot; records, along with the likes of &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; and &quot;Ray of Light&quot;. Music critic Robert Christgau called both &quot;You Can Dance&quot; and &quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot; &quot;stunning&quot; records, while the staff of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called both compilations &quot;perfect Madonna&quot; albums.

&quot;You Can Dance&quot; made appearances on a number of year-end and best-of lists by publications such as &quot;Cash Box&quot;, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. Upon release, the record was chosen as &quot;album of the week&quot; by &quot;Music &amp; Media&quot;, issued on November 28, 1987. The same publication named it &quot;The Dance Record of the Year&quot;. Lucinda Prince of the Australian website Cool Accident listed the compilation as one of the &quot;Best 5 Pop Remix Albums&quot;.

<text>Colorado Boulevard (or Colorado Street in Glendale and parts of Arcadia) is a major east–west street in Southern California. It runs from Griffith Park in Los Angeles east through Glendale, the Eagle Rock section of Los Angeles, Pasadena, and Arcadia, ending in Monrovia. The full route was once various state highways but is now locally maintained in favor of the parallel Ventura Freeway (SR 134) and Foothill Freeway (I-210).

The west end of Colorado Boulevard is composed of two segments: a disconnected surface street segment of Colorado Boulevard, and the Colorado Street Freeway Extension. Colorado Boulevard begins at a cul-de-sac near the Los Angeles River in Los Angeles and continues east. The road passes on/off-ramps to the eastbound Colorado Street Freeway Extension, and Edenhurst Avenue, which provides access to the westbound freeway. The segment terminates at West San Fernando Road near the Los Angeles-Glendale city limits, and picks up across the railroad corridor at San Fernando Road in the city of Glendale as Colorado Street.

The Colorado Street Freeway Extension begins at Interstate 5 (Golden State Freeway) as a short freeway spur, originally carrying State Route 134 until it was moved north onto the Ventura Freeway, but is still maintained by Caltrans. After crossing the Los Angeles River, the freeway then terminates at Colorado Street in Glendale. The freeway&#x27;s entrances are signed as entrances to Interstate 5. The Colorado Street Freeway Extension is part of the state highway system as Route 5S.

At the east border of Glendale, Colorado Street becomes Colorado Boulevard as it crosses State Route 2 (Glendale Freeway) into Los Angeles (specifically, the neighborhood of Eagle Rock). Another short freeway spur splits west of the intersection with Figueroa Street, heading northeast to the Ventura Freeway. This spur also carried SR 134 after the Ventura Freeway was built to the east but before it was built west of the split with the spur. After crossing Figueroa Street, Colorado Boulevard splits from Linda Vista Avenue and then passes over the Arroyo Seco on the Colorado Street Bridge into Pasadena.

===Through Pasadena===
In Pasadena, Colorado Boulevard crosses the short State Route 710 spur and forms the north end of State Route 110 (Arroyo Parkway). Colorado Street, renamed &quot;Boulevard&quot; in 1958, runs through Old Town Pasadena from Arroyo Parkway to Orange Grove Boulevard. It is the north–south zero axis of the street grid in Pasadena (the east–west axis is Fair Oaks Avenue). The Tournament of Roses parade route travels north on Orange Grove Avenue then east along Colorado Boulevard as far as Sierra Madre Boulevard, where it heads north to Victory Park. Most major Pasadena attractions are found along or within one block of Colorado Boulevard. Pasadena City College is located at 1570 East Colorado Boulevard. The street was mentioned in Jan and Dean&#x27;s 1964 hit song &quot;The Little Old Lady from Pasadena&quot;. The road leaves the city into unincorporated East Pasadena, where it intersects Rosemead Boulevard (Former State Route 19), all while formerly signed as California State Route 248.

===Through Arcadia and Monrovia===
Colorado Boulevard becomes Colorado Street as it crosses Michillinda Avenue from East Pasadena into Arcadia. Through Arcadia, the street parallels the Foothill Freeway, providing access to many of the neighborhoods in west Arcadia; freeway access is provided via a separated interchange with Baldwin Avenue. Colorado Street then turns southeast and splits into two streets—Colorado Boulevard, which continues east, and Colorado Place, a short segment of old US 66 that goes southeast to merge with Huntington Drive near the Santa Anita Racetrack.

From the split, Colorado Boulevard (originally named Orange Street) becomes a primarily residential street, with some commercial zones near Santa Anita Avenue in Arcadia. The street passes under the Foothill Freeway between First and Second Streets in Arcadia with no access, in front of Monrovia High School, and through Old Town Monrovia before ending at Shamrock Avenue at Recreation Park in Monrovia. (This segment of Shamrock Avenue was once part of an early alignment of US 66 and had been named Foothill Boulevard.)

The Santa Anita Depot, built in 1890 to serve Lucky Baldwin, and the people of Rancho Santa Anita, was located at Colorado Boulevard and Old Ranch Road. It was moved to the Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanic Garden during the construction of the 210 Foothill Freeway in 1970.

==History==

The most original portion of Colorado Boulevard ran from Orange Grove Boulevard to Broadway, now Arroyo Parkway. This portion of the street always contained many shops, banks, hotels, and major commercial industries. By the late 19th century, this part of Colorado had become so popular, it was becoming a traffic bottleneck, and as early as May 1900 there were public outcries to the City Council to widen the road. It wasn&#x27;t until 1929 that the City undertook the major and unprecedented task of cutting back the buildings along Colorado on each side. This undertaking created a monumental amount of legal red tape as well as many engineering dilemmas which were handled with amazing results. At the same time many of the Victorian facings on the buildings were replaced with Spanish and Art Deco designs.

The Colorado Street Railway began operations in Pasadena on November 9, 1886, bringing mass transit to the street via the new horsecar service. The line was electrified in 1894 and was eventually absorbed into the Pacific Electric system. The Lamanda Park Line and other local services operated in the center of the roadway until January 19, 1941.

Colorado Street and Colorado Boulevard carried pre-1964 Legislative Route 161 from its west end to the merge with Huntington Drive (via Colorado Place). This was signed as State Route 134 west of Figueroa Street, U.S. Route 66 Alternate (US 66 before the end of 1940) from Figueroa Street to Arroyo Parkway, and U.S. Route 66 from Arroyo Parkway to Huntington Drive.

In 1954, the Colorado Freeway was opened between Holly Street in Pasadena and Eagle Vista Drive and Colorado Boulevard in Eagle Rock to help alleviate traffic congestion due to the narrow Colorado Street Bridge over the Arroyo Seco. The new freeway connected the two communities until 1971, when the entire freeway was closed and upgraded, as well as partially rerouted as the new Ventura Freeway. A short segment of the original Colorado Freeway remains as an on-ramp/off-ramp between Colorado Boulevard in Eagle Rock and the Figueroa Street off-ramp of the present Ventura Freeway.

In the 1964 renumbering, LR 161 remained State Route 134 west of Pasadena, though this was being moved to the new alignment (now the Ventura Freeway); until the freeway was completed through Pasadena in the mid-1970s, Colorado Boulevard was still signed as State Route 134 between Orange Grove Avenue and Arroyo Parkway. Through and east of Pasadena, LR 161 became State Route 248, but was signed as US 66 and continued east on Huntington Drive to the interchange with Interstate 210 (Foothill Freeway) in Monrovia. In 1965, this was to be deleted when I-210 was completed.

The US 66 shields began to come down along the length of Route 248 in 1975, soon after Interstate 210 was completed through Pasadena. SR 248 was never signed as such, though it did appear on some maps in the 1970s and 1980s. The segment within the city of Pasadena was deleted from the state highway system in 1986. The rest was removed in 1992. Along with the moving of SR 134 to the Ventura Freeway, this resulted in Colorado Street and Colorado Boulevard becoming a local road.

==Transit==
Colorado Boulevard is served by several bus routes, operated by Metro and suburban systems. Metro Local line 180 serves most of Colorado Boulevard, running between Hollywood and Pasadena. Also, Foothill Transit line 187 serves parts of Colorado Boulevard, beginning in Old Pasadena. LADOT DASH Eagle Rock/Highland Park serves most of Colorado Boulevard in Eagle Rock. Glendale Transit line 6 serves Colorado Street in Glendale.

Metro has identified Colorado Boulevard as a potential bus rapid transit corridor, part of a line between North Hollywood station and Pasadena approved in 2016&#x27;s Measure M. The bus rapid transit project would need to include removable components to allow for the annual staging of the Rose Parade. Some local residents fear increased traffic congestion due to the proposed bus rapid transit route, while others support increasing access to high-quality transit.

==In popular culture==
The street is mentioned in the 1964 Jan &amp; Dean single The Little Old Lady (from Pasadena), with the protagonist described as the &quot;terror of Colorado Boulevard.&quot;

In S05E13 of The Big Bang Theory, Sheldon says to Leonard: &quot;It’s not about you. It’s about a poor immigrant from Pakistan trying to make his way in America by working the graveyard shift at the Colorado Boulevard Chevron&quot;, When talking about the gas station across their road.

<text>Augustus C. Ludlow (1 January 1792 – 13 June 1813) was an officer in the United States Navy during the War of 1812.

Ludlow was born in Newburgh, New York. He was appointed midshipman April 2, 1804, and commissioned lieutenant June 3, 1810. Ludlow was second in command to Captain James Lawrence on the USS &quot;Chesapeake&quot; during the ship&#x27;s engagement with HMS &quot;Shannon&quot; on June 1, 1813. It was to Ludlow that Lawrence said &quot;Don&#x27;t give up the ship.&quot; Both Ludlow and Lawrence were mortally wounded in that battle, and Ludlow died in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on June 13, 1813.

Lieutenant Ludlow is interred, together with Captain James Lawrence and Lawrence&#x27;s widow, in the graveyard of Trinity Church in Manhattan, New York City.

<doc id="1160012" wikidata="Q2967754" url="?curid=1160012" title="Lacteal">
<text>A lacteal is a lymphatic capillary that absorbs dietary fats in the villi of the small intestine.

Triglycerides are emulsified by bile and hydrolyzed by the enzyme lipase, resulting in a mixture of fatty acids, di- and monoglycerides. These then pass from the intestinal lumen into the enterocyte, where they are re-esterified to form triglyceride. The triglyceride is then combined with phospholipids, cholesterol ester, and apolipoprotein B48 to form chylomicrons. These chylomicrons then pass into the lacteals, forming a milky substance known as chyle. The lacteals merge to form larger lymphatic vessels that transport the chyle to the thoracic duct where it is emptied into the bloodstream at the subclavian vein.

At this point, the fats are in the bloodstream in the form of chylomicrons. Once in the blood, chylomicrons are subject to delipidation by lipoprotein lipase. Eventually, enough lipid has been lost and additional apolipoproteins gained, that the resulting particle (now referred to as a chylomicron remnant) can be taken up by the liver. From the liver, the fat released from chylomicron remnants can be re-exported to the blood as the triglyceride component of very low-density lipoproteins. Very low-density lipoproteins are also subject to delipidation by vascular lipoprotein lipase, and deliver fats to tissues throughout the body. In particular, the released fatty acids can be stored in adipose cells as triglycerides. As triglycerides are lost from very low-density lipoproteins, the lipoprotein particles become smaller and denser (since protein is denser than lipid) and ultimately become low-density lipoproteins. LDL particles are highly atherogenic.

In contrast to any other route of absorption from the small intestine, the lymphatic system avoids first pass metabolism.

<text>Westgarth is a neighbourhood within the suburb of Northcote, about 4 or 5 km north-east of Melbourne&#x27;s central business district in Victoria, Australia. It is in the local government area of the City of Darebin. The neighbourhood has a commercial centre, distinct from the main commercial centre of Northcote, located near Westgarth railway station, just north of Clifton Hill. While Westgarth does not have any official borders, it is generally considered to extend from Merri Creek in the west to the boundary of Fairfield in the east.

== History ==


Before European occupation, the area was home to the Wurundjeri people. Land c.2 km to the south, where Merri Creek meets the Yarra, was an early site of colonial contact, briefly home to the Native Police Corps in 1842, and a school for Aboriginal children until 1851. The precise location of the signing of Batman&#x27;s Treaty, an 1835 agreement between an early colonizer John Batman and Wurundjeri elders to cede land to him, is unknown but thought to be at the western end of Cunningham Street on the banks of the Merri Creek. Land sales first occurred in the Northcote area in 1840, and land was purchased in the area then known as Northcote-by-the-Merri (now Westgarth) but not immediately developed. Three of the buyers later had streets named after them - Cunningham, Urquhart and Walker. As Northcote, Victoria developed in the mid-to-late 19th century, Northcote-by-the-Merri became known as Northcote South. Land was gazetted for development in 1853, but development was relatively slow. All Saints Anglican church on High Street Westgarth dates to 1860 (present building, 1870), and the Bridge Hotel to 1864.

Westgarth&#x27;s development accelerated - along with that of many other Melbourne suburbs - in the economic boom of the 1880s. As the children of the Gold Rush generation formed their own families, Melbourne&#x27;s population swelled. The Victorian Parliament reacted by using railway lines to open up new housing areas. The railway line from Clifton Hill to Alphington was opened in 1884, and the railway station was linked to Melbourne via a western loop in 1888. A cable tram line down High Street to Clifton Hill was opened in 1886, faltered after the land market collapse of 1892, and opened and closed again until reopening permanently in 1901. Building continued through the Edwardian era and into the 1920s, and in 1925 the Northcote tram (now route 86) was connected right through to the city centre. In 1913 the Northcote South Ratepayer&#x27;s Association gained permission to install two redundant 12 ton cannons from the 1880s facing south to North Fitzroy (built by W.G. Armstrong and Co. of Newcastle-on-Tyne, UK) and they are still in place. The present commercial and shopping strip along High St. dates to the early 20th century, and Westgarth Primary School to 1925, when it opened as Westgarth Central School. The suburb won its present name between 1906 and 1910, with the decision to name the railway station after William Westgarth. The art nouveau Westgarth Theatre, the suburb&#x27;s best-known landmark, opened in 1921.

The 1960s and 1970s saw an influx of southern European immigrants to the area, in common with other City of Darebin suburbs. By the 1970s the Westgarth Theatre catered largely to a Greek-speaking cinema audience. Westgarth school photos and class lists from the 1970s are dominated by Greek names and faces. That influence began to fade in the 1980s, with the arrival of a new generation of Westgarth residents with higher incomes and education levels. The process of gentrification accelerated through the 1990s, fuelled by the suburb&#x27;s central location, attractive streets and housing stock, and its proximity to pricier inner-city suburbs including Fitzroy, Clifton Hill and North Fitzroy. The Westgarth Theatre became an art-house movie venue in 1987 when the Valhalla Cinema relocated there after the demolition of its original premises in Richmond. Ten years later, it became the Westgarth Cinema, now part of the Palace Group. A number of industrial buildings along High Street were converted to residential use in the late 1990s and early first decade of the 21st century. Westgarth Primary School&#x27;s original building was demolished in 1990 and replaced by an open-plan building, extended in 2011.

==World War II==
A partially excavated tunnel and bunker is located in Westgarth on the north bank of Merri Creek about 30 metres downstream from where a trail crosses the stream near the southwest corner of Oldis Gardens and East Street. The tunnel entrance is locked and it is reported that it lies under a high pressure gas pipeline.

== Westgarth today ==

Today, Westgarth retains its southern European presence, with many children of the 1960s and 1970s immigrant wave still living in the area. But Westgarth also houses a wide variety of other cultural and language groups. Gentrification has brought back some of the children of Melbourne residents who moved to middle and outer suburbs in the 1950s and 1960s. The area is now known for its local artists and a lesbian community has also been associated with Westgarth for some years. There is a higher-than-average proportion of Subaru ownership among residents, often with a RRR and/or PBS and/or 3CR bumper sticker on the back. The best-known local resident was the Australian actor Vince Colosimo (believed now moved).

The Westgarth Cinema remains the centre of the small commercial strip at the southern end of High Street, which is now populated by bohemian fashion outlets, but mainly cafes, restaurants and a few other retail businesses. The strip remains noticeably less developed than its counterparts in Clifton Hill and Fairfield, arguably due in part to the traffic intensity of the relatively narrow High Street. New development has been rare, although new businesses open every few months and apartments above shops were constructed in 2009, again in 2011 and in 2020. The lack of local shops means most Westgarth residents currently travel to other suburbs for groceries and many other needs. Retaining the &quot;village&quot; feel of Westgarth, against mounting commercial pressures to redevelop Victorian heritage buildings and development sites, was the aim of the now-defunct &quot;Save Westgarth Village&quot; campaign.

The Westgarth Cinema was one of the last two remaining single-screen venues in Melbourne, until being redeveloped in 2006. After several years of uncertainty about its commercial survival, the family owners finally sold it to Palace Cinemas in 2005, while retaining ownership of the building. Although many original features have been preserved, it is now a popular multiplex with a 300-seat cinema downstairs and now four smaller cinemas upstairs.

The train line through Westgarth station is now part of the Hurstbridge line, following an easterly route into the city. A second, proximate station on the Mernda line, Rushall, is accessed via a pedestrian and cyclist bridge over the Merri Creek (the bridge connects through to an east–west cycle route along Linear Park, one of the nicest such parks in Melbourne). The High Street tram line is now part of Melbourne tram route 86. Upgrading the tram line occurred in 2011, with three stops reduced to two in Westgarth and increased dangers to cyclists and pedestrians close to the relocated central stop. The tram changes are noted in Council consultation and in many media articles and community campaigns. In August 2013, in the last phase of the tram works, metal sculptures designed by Syrinx Environmental were added to the new median strip, producing a local outcry on social media and featuring in the national press. The Council voted to remove them again after 3 weeks.

The Jika Jika Community centre on Plant Street is the main meeting place for local events and activities.

==Education==

Westgarth Primary School is the area&#x27;s main school, although Merri Creek, Fairfield and Spensley Street Schools are closer by distance for many Westgarth residents. Westgarth Primary was founded in 1924 as Westgarth Central School, Number 4177 in the Victorian system. Originally Primary to Year 8, it eventually became primary-only. It now caters to approximately 650 students in grades from preparatory to year six. It has two campuses, Clarke St (for Grade 3-6 students), and Brooke St (for students in years Prep-2). It has a kindergarten attached to the Clarke St campus. It is one of the biggest primary schools in the region and is currently seeking government funding to redevelop its facilities to cater for significant growth in student numbers. Westgarth Primary School runs code club, robotics and other Technology workshops.

<doc id="1160014" wikidata="Q3893320" url="?curid=1160014" title="Millikin University">
<text>Millikin University is a private university in Decatur, Illinois, United States. It was founded in 1901 by prominent Decatur businessman James Millikin and is affiliated with the Presbyterian Church (USA).

==History==
Millikin was initially established on April 30, 1901, through a partnership with the then-Lincoln University, an existing college in Lincoln, Illinois also affiliated with the Cumberland Presbyterian Church. At this time, the charter for Lincoln University, which had been in existence since February 1865, was modified to create a new overarching university, the James Millikin University. This new institution had two subsidiary units: Lincoln College, the newly renamed, Lincoln-based campus formerly known as &quot;Lincoln University&quot;, and the Decatur College and Industrial School, a new campus to be established in Decatur. This arrangement leveraged the existing resources of Lincoln University to establish a wholly new college in Decatur. The combined, two-campus institution took the name of its primary advocate, James Millikin.

Millikin&#x27;s campus in Decatur, however, would not officially open until September 15, 1903. Its dedication was presided over by president Theodore Roosevelt.

James Millikin University maintained its two-campus model until 1952, when the two units separated to become two wholly independent institutions; the Decatur campus renamed as just Millikin University while the Lincoln campus remained known as Lincoln College. The charter of independent Millikin was approved by the state on July 23, 1953.

==Academics==
Millikin confers undergraduate degrees, graduate degrees, and post-graduate certificates and degrees. Its most popular undergraduate majors, based on number out of 403 graduates in 2022, were:
*Registered Nursing/Registered Nurse (55)
*Musical Theatre (31)
*Business Administration and Management (28)
*Drama and Dramatics/Theatre Arts (27)
*Biology/Biological Sciences (25)

===Undergraduate admissions===
In 2024, Millikin University accepted 75.4% of undergraduate applicants, with admission standards considered moderate, applicant competition considered very low, and with those enrolled having an average 3.4 high school GPA. The university does not require submission of standardized test scores, but they will be considered when submitted. Those enrolled that submitted test scores had an average 1070 SAT score (31% submitting scores) or an average 23 ACT score (14% submitting scores).

===Rankings===
In 2025, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked Millikin University tied for No.14 out of 94 schools in &quot;Regional Colleges Midwest&quot;, No.22 in Best Value Schools, and tied for No.44 in Top Performers on Social Mobility, noting that the university had a student-faculty ratio of 10:1, 74.5% of classes had fewer than 20 students, had an average freshman retention rate, an indicator of student satisfaction, of 71%, and that the university considered a student&#x27;s GPA an important academic factor with an applicant&#x27;s high school class rank and letters of recommendation considered.

==Media==
===Decaturian===
The &quot;Decaturian&quot; is the bi-weekly student newspaper. Its first issue appeared in 1903; issues up to 1951 are archived online.

===WJMU 89.5 The Quad===
WJMU is Millikin University&#x27;s student-operated freeform format radio station. In addition to its musical responsibilities, WJMU also creates its own public service announcements, liners, news, Millikin sports programming and promotional materials.

In 1922, a license was issued for a new AM broadcasting station, operating on a wavelength of 360 meters (833 kHz). This station was randomly assigned the call letters WBAO, which came from a sequential roster of available call signs. It maintained a limited schedule of broadcasts. On May 25, 1928, the Federal Radio Commission (FRC) issued General Order 32, which notified 164 stations, including WBAO, that &quot;From an examination of your application for future license it does not find that public interest, convenience, or necessity would be served by granting it.&quot; On September 1, 1928, the FRC listed &quot;Stations WJBL and WBAO&quot; as one of the &quot;consolidations which have been approved by the commission, or imposed on the stations by the commission&quot;. WBAO was formally deleted on October 1, 1928, and it was announced that programs previously broadcast by that station would now be heard over WJBL.

==Athletics==

Since their first year of athletics in the 1903–04 academic year and prior to joining the NCAA Division III and the CCIW in the 1946–47 season, Millikin primarily competed as an Independent of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA). Millikin University teams have since participated in the National Collegiate Athletic Association&#x27;s Division III. The Big Blue are a member of the College Conference of Illinois and Wisconsin (CCIW). Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, wrestling, soccer, swimming and diving, tennis, track and field, and volleyball; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, triathlon, swimming &amp; diving, tennis, track &amp; field and volleyball.

<doc id="1160021" wikidata="Q165508" url="?curid=1160021" title="Coat of arms of Russia">
<text>The coat of arms of Russia derives from the earlier coat of arms of the Russian Empire. Though modified more than once since the reign of Ivan III (1462–1505), the current coat of arms is directly derived from its medieval original, with the double-headed eagle having Byzantine and earlier antecedents. The general tincture corresponds to the fifteenth-century standard.

==Description and usage==
The two main elements of Russian state symbols (the two-headed eagle and Saint George slaying the dragon) predate Peter the Great. According to the Kremlin&#x27;s website:

«...четырёхугольный, с закруглёнными нижними углами, заострённый в оконечности красный геральдический щит с золотым двуглавым орлом, поднявшим вверх распущенные крылья. Орел увенчан двумя малыми коронами и — над ними — одной большой короной, соединенными лентой. В правой лапе орла — скипетр, в левой — держава. На груди орла, в красном щите, — серебряный всадник в синем плаще на серебряном коне, поражающий серебряным копьём черного опрокинутого навзничь и попранного конём дракона.»

Which is translated as:

&quot;… a gold two-headed eagle with raised extended wings set against a four-cornered red heraldic shield with rounded lower corners. Two small crowns top the eagle&#x27;s heads, with one large crown above them. The three crowns are linked by a ribbon. The eagle holds a sceptre in its right claw and an orb in its left claw. The eagle bears a red shield on its breast depicting a silver horseman in a blue cape, mounted upon a silver horse and slaying a black dragon with a silver spear.&quot;
The current coat of arms was designed by artist Yevgeny Ukhnalyov; it was adopted on 30 November 1993 by a presidential decree, and then by a federal law signed by President Vladimir Putin on December 20, 2000.

Today, the imperial crowns on each head stand for the unity and sovereignty of Russia, both as a whole and in its constituent republics and regions. The orb and scepter grasped in the eagle&#x27;s talons are traditional heraldic symbols of sovereign power and authority. Of note is that the scepter shows the Droste effect, as it is topped by a miniature image of the coat-of-arms itself. They have been retained in the modern Russian arms despite the fact that the Russian Federation is not a monarchy, which led to objections by the Communists even though both the blue ribbon and the collar of the Order of St. Andrew (which in the imperial arms supported the three crowns and surrounded the central shield) have been removed from the current coat of arms.

It appears on the federal buildings and is on the cover of the national passport. 

The standard of the president of Russia is a squared Russian tricolour defaced with the coat of arms of Russia, the banner of the Russian Armed Forces also has the coat of arms centered on the obverse side. Some state awards of Russia are also designed based on the coat of arms, including the State Prize. Russian ruble coins depict the coat of arms on the obverse side since 2016.

==Historical versions==
The heraldic device of Russia has gone through three major periods in its history, undergoing major changes in the transitions between the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union, and the Russian Federation. The use of the double-headed eagle as a Russian coat of arms goes back to the 15th century. With the fall of Constantinople and the end of the Byzantine Empire in 1453, the Grand Dukes of Muscovy came to see themselves as the successors of the Byzantine heritage, a notion reinforced by the marriage of Ivan III to Sophia Paleologue (hence the expression &quot;Third Rome&quot; for Moscow and, by extension, for the whole of Imperial Russia). Ivan adopted the golden Byzantine double-headed eagle in his seal, first documented in 1472, marking his direct claim to the Roman imperial heritage and posing as a sovereign equal and rival to the Holy Roman Empire. In 1497, it was stamped on a charter of share and allotment of independent princes&#x27; possessions. At about the same time, the image of a gilt, double-headed eagle on a red background appeared on the walls of the Palace of Facets in the Moscow Kremlin.

The other main Russian coat of arms, the image of St George slaying the dragon, is contemporaneous. In its first form, as a rider armed with a spear, it is found in the seal of Vasili I of Moscow in 1390. At the time of Ivan III, the dragon was added, but the final association with Saint George was not made until 1730, when it was described as such in an Imperial decree. Eventually, St George became the patron saint of Moscow (and, by extension, of Russia).

After the assumption of the title of &quot;Tsar&quot; by Ivan IV, the two coats are found combined, with the eagle bearing an escutcheon depicting St George on the breast. With the establishment of the Moscow Patriarchate in 1589, a patriarchal cross was added for a time between the heads of the eagle.

===1721–1917: Russian Empire===
The Russian Empire had a coat of arms, displayed in either its greater, middle and lesser version. Its escutcheon was golden with a black two-headed eagle crowned with two imperial crowns, over which the same third crown, enlarged, with two flying ends of the ribbon of the Order of Saint Andrew. The State Eagle held a golden scepter and golden globus cruciger. On the chest of the eagle there was an escutcheon with the arms of Moscow, depicting Saint George, mounted and defeating the dragon. After approval by Alexander III on 24 July 1882, the greater coat of arms was adopted on 3 November, replacing the previous 1857 version.

Its central element is the state coat of arms, surmounted with the helmet of Alexander Nevsky, with black and golden mantling, and flanked by the archangels Michael and Gabriel. The collar of the Order of Saint Andrew is suspended from the coat of arms. The whole lies within a golden ermine mantle, crowned by the Imperial Crown of Russia and decorated with black double-headed eagles. The inscription on the canopy reads: Съ Нами Богъ (&quot;God is with us&quot;). Above the canopy stands the state khorugv, of gold cloth, on which is depicted the Medium State Seal. The banner is topped by the State Eagle.

Around the central composition are placed fifteen coats of arms of the various territories of the Russian Empire. Nine of these are crowned and placed on a laurel and oak wreath. Proceeding from the left in a counter-clockwise direction, these represent, as they are included in the full imperial title: the Khanate of Kazan, the Congress Kingdom of Poland, Tauric Chersonesos, the unified coat of arms of the Grand Principalities of Kiev, Vladimir and Novgorod, the dynastic arms of the House of Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov, the Grand Duchy of Finland, the Georgian principalities, and the Khanates of Siberia and Astrakhan.

The six upper escutcheons are joint depictions of various smaller principalities and &quot;oblasts&quot;. From the left in a clockwise fashion, these are: the combined arms of the northeastern regions (Perm, Volga Bulgaria, Vyatka, Kondinsky, Obdorsk), of Belorussia and Lithuania (Lithuania, Białystok, Samogitia, Polatsk, Vitebsk, Mstislavl), the provinces of Great Russia proper (Pskov, Smolensk, Tver, Nizhniy-Novgorod, Ryazan, Rostov, Yaroslavl, Belozersk, Udorsky), the arms of the southwestern regions (Volhyn, Podolsk, Chernigov), the Baltic provinces (Estonia, Courland and Semigalia, Karelia, Livonia) and Turkestan.

The Middle Coat of Arms (Средний государственный герб Российской Империи) is similar to the Great Coat of Arms, excluding the khorugv and the six upper escutcheons. The Abbreviated Imperial Title is inscribed over the perimeter of the Seal. The Lesser Coat of Arms (Малый государственный герб Российской Империи) depicts the imperial double-headed eagle, as used in the coat of arms, with the addition of the collar of the Order of Saint Andrew around the escutcheon of St. George, and the Arms of Astrakhan, Siberia, Georgia, Finland, Kiev-Vladimir-Novgorod, Taurica, Poland and Kazan on the wings (seen clockwise).

In the beginning of the 17th century, with the ascension of the Romanov dynasty and its contacts with Western Europe, the image of the eagle changed. In 1625, for the first time the double-headed eagle appeared with three crowns. Traditionally, the latter have alternatively been interpreted as representing the conquered kingdoms of Kazan, Astrakhan and Siberia, as stated in the first edict concerning the state seal, on 14 December 1667, or as standing for the unity of Great Russia (Russia), Little Russia (Ukraine) and White Russia (Belarus). Probably under influence from its German equivalent, the eagle, from 1654 onwards, was designed with spread wings and holding a scepter and orb in its claws.

During the reign of Peter the Great, further changes were made. The collar of the newly established Order of Saint Andrew was added around the central escutcheon, and the crowns were changed to the imperial pattern after his assumption of the imperial title in 1721. At about this time, the eagle&#x27;s color was changed from golden to black, which would be retained until the fall of the Russian monarchy in 1917. A final form for the eagle was adopted by imperial decree in 1729, and remained virtually unchanged until 1853.

During the early 19th century, the eagle designs diversified, and two different variants were adopted by Emperor Nicholas I. The first type represented the eagle with spread wings, one crown, with an image of St.George on the breast and with a wreath and a thunderbolt in its claws. The second type followed the 1730 pattern, with the addition of the arms of Kazan, Astrakhan and Siberia on its left wing and those of Poland, the Taurica and Finland on the right one.

In 1855–57, in the course of a general heraldic reform, the eagle&#x27;s appearance was changed, mirroring German patterns, while St George was made to look to the left, in accordance with the rules of Western heraldry. At the same time, the full set of coat of arms of Great, Medium and Minor Arms, was laid down and approved. The final revisions and changes were made in 1882–83, and are those described above.

===1918–93: Soviet and post-Soviet Russia===

The coat of arms of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) was adopted on 10 July 1918 by the government of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (Soviet Union), and modified several times afterwards. It shows wheat as the symbol of agriculture, a rising sun for the &quot;future of the Russian nation&quot;, the red star (the RSFSR was the last Soviet Republic to include the star in its state emblem, in 1978) as well as the hammer and sickle for the victory of Communism and the &quot;world-wide socialist community of states&quot;.

The Soviet Union state motto (&quot;Workers of the world, unite!&quot;) in Russian (&quot; — ) is also a part of the coat of arms.

The acronym of the RSFSR is shown above the hammer and sickle, and reads &quot;, for &quot;&quot; ().

Similar emblems were used by the Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republics (ASSR) within the Russian SFSR; the main differences were generally the use of the republic&#x27;s acronym and the presence of the motto in the language(s) of the titular nations (with the exception of the state emblem of the Dagestan ASSR, which had the motto in eleven languages as there is no single Dagestani language).

The Soviet Union as a whole adopted its emblem in 1923, which remained in use until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. Although it is technically an emblem rather than a coat of arms, since it does not follow traditional heraldic rules, in Russian it is called (), the word used for a traditional coat of arms. It was the first state insignia created in the style known as socialist heraldry, a style also seen in e.g. the Chinese national emblem.

The emblem shows the Soviet emblems of the Hammer and Sickle and the Red Star over a globe, in the center of a wreath wrapped in ribbons emblazoned with the communist motto (&quot;Workers of the world, unite!&quot;) in the official languages of the Soviet republics with the Russian inscription in the centre, in the reverse order they were mentioned in the Soviet Constitution. Each Soviet Republic (SSR) and Autonomous Soviet Republic (ASSR) had its own coat of arms, largely inspired by the state emblem of the Union.

Four versions were used: 6 ribbons were used in 1923, which were written on in Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Georgian, Armenian, and Azerbaijani; 11 ribbons with the addition of Turkmen, Uzbek, Tajik, Kazakh, Kyrgyz; 16 with the addition of Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Moldavian, and Finnish. Finally, the inscriptions in Azerbaijani, Turkmen, Uzbek, Tajik, Kazakh and Kyrgyz were updated to reflect their transition from the Latin to the Cyrillic script. The final version of the emblem was adopted in 1956 with the removal of the Finnish inscription from the insignia, reflecting the 1956 transformation of the Karelo-Finnish SSR into the Karelian ASSR.

In 1992, the inscription was changed from RSFSR (&quot;) to the Russian Federation (&quot;) in connection with the change of the name of the state. In 1993, president Boris Yeltsin signed a decree to replace the Communist design by the present coat of arms.

<doc id="1160028" wikidata="Q841395" url="?curid=1160028" title="Clown loach">
<text>The clown loach (Chromobotia macracanthus), or tiger botia, is a tropical freshwater fish belonging to the botiid loach family. It is the sole member of the genus Chromobotia. It originates in inland waters in Indonesia on the islands of Sumatra and Borneo. The fish is called &quot;ulanguli&quot; by the locals in Sentarum, West Borneo. It is a popular fish in the freshwater aquarium trade and is sold worldwide.

==Taxonomy and naming==
The fish was first described as &quot;Cobitis macracanthus&quot; by Pieter Bleeker in 1852. In 1989, its scientific name was changed to &quot;Botia macracanthus&quot;. In 2004, Dr. Maurice Kottelat divided the genus &quot;Botia&quot;, containing 47 different species, into seven separate genera, resulting in the clown loach being placed in a genus of its own, &quot;Chromobotia&quot;. Its scientific name roughly translates to &quot;Large-thorned colourful warrior&quot;.
The common name &quot;clown loach&quot; comes from the fish&#x27;s bright colours and stripes (often tropical fish with stripes that stand out are commonly called &quot;clown&quot;) as well as from its habit of &#x27;entertaining&#x27; aquarium owners with strange habits, such as swimming upside down, or &#x27;playing dead.&#x27;

==Description and behavior==

Information about the maximum size of the clown loach varies, with some estimates ranging up to , and with typical adult sizes ranging from . The fish&#x27;s body is long and laterally compressed, with an arched dorsal surface and a flat ventral surface. Its head is relatively large and its mouth faces downward with thick, fleshy lips, and four pairs of barbels. The barbels on the lower jaw are small and difficult to see. Clown loaches can make clicking sounds when they are happy, being territorial (used as a type of weapon/warning) or mating. This sound is produced by the grinding of their pharyngeal teeth.

The body is whitish-orange to reddish-orange, with three thick, black, triangular, vertical bands. The anterior band runs from the top of the head and through the eye, the medial band lies between the head and the dorsal fin, and wraps around to the ventral surface, and the posterior band covers almost all of the caudal peduncle and extends to the anal fin. There is some regional colour variation within the species; the pelvic fins on fish from Borneo are reddish-orange and black, while the pelvic fins on fish from Sumatra are entirely reddish-orange.

The fish is sexually dimorphic, with females being slightly plumper than males. In addition, the tips of the tail on the male curve inwards slightly, whereas the females have straight tips.

The fish has a movable spine that lies in a groove below the eye, which may be extended as a defence mechanism. The spine may cause a painful wound, but is not venomous. It also may be used as a predation tool as it is set close to the mouth.

==Distribution and habitat==
Clown loaches are native to the islands of Sumatra and Borneo in Indonesia. Clear stream environments provide the optimal habitat for clown loaches, but biannual monsoon flooding forces the fish to move into flooded flood plains, or murky or blackwater rivers or lakes, for 7–8 months of the year, and clown loaches are commonly found in the flood plains of hilly areas. Breeding adults migrate to smaller waterways to spawn annually.

In its native habitat, the fish is found in water with a temperature range of , a pH between 5.0 and 8.0, and water hardness between 5 and 12 dH.

==Reproduction in captivity==
Clown loach reproduce in captivity only after hormonal stimulation of final oocyte maturation and ovulation. Captive breeding and mass production of clown loach is done primarily in country of origin (Indonesia) and in Europe.

==In the aquarium==


A common and popular fish for tropical freshwater aquaria, &quot;C. macracanthus&quot; is a visually pleasing species.
Although specimens in the wild will reach 40 to 50  cm, in the aquaria it is uncommon for &quot;C. macracanthus&quot; to attain more than 15 to 20 cm fork length. They are a very long-lived species, living up to 30 years.

These fish have bifurcated spines under the eyes. They are thought to be used as a defence mechanism and possibly, for obtaining prey.

&quot;C. macracanthus&quot; will associate with other benthic species in the aquaria if kept singly or with few other specimens. They make suitable tank-mates for any non-aggressive community fishes, but do not thrive when kept with larger, more dominant species.

Occasionally &quot;C. macracanthus&quot; will exhibit erratic swimming patterns, such as swimming on their sides or upside down. This is not usually a sign of illness, however, and the fish will normally return to normal behaviour almost instantly.

As &quot;C. macracanthus&quot; is found in riverine environments it is able to cope with good flow rates of water in the aquaria. Aquascapes may replicate this environment to suit the requirements of the species with areas of high flow, but also typically include areas of low flow to allow the fish to rest. &quot;C. macracanthus&quot; is also fond of cover and is not overly accustomed to bright lighting. The fish will often seek areas of shade or cover in which to rest during the day and become more active when light levels are more subdued.
The barbels of clown loaches are known to be easily damaged by rough substrates, such as gravel, in aquaria.

Clown loaches are particularly susceptible to Ichthyophthirius (ich), or white spot disease. Due to the fact that clown loaches have small or no scales, they are often not treated with full doses of medications.

Over-exploitation of &quot;C. macracanthus&quot; has motivated the development of conservation efforts, mostly new artificial propagation techniques. &quot;C. macracanthus&quot; is easier to breed when individuals are between two and four centimeters in size.

Most clown loaches accept commercial flake food and sinking pellets as their dietary staple, but thrive with a variety of food: live (worms, brine shrimp, small snails), banana, other plant matter, freeze-dried (tubifex worms, especially if it is fortified) and frozen brine shrimp. Clown loaches (and their cousins) are also one of the few fishes that will eat bladder snails (&quot;Physella acuta&quot;), and are valued by aquarists for controlling this pest in planted aquaria.

<text>Pace is the suburban bus and regional paratransit division of the Regional Transportation Authority serving the Chicago metropolitan area. It was created in 1983 by the RTA Act, which established the formula that provides funding to the CTA, Metra, and Pace. The various agencies providing bus service in the Chicago suburbs were merged under the Suburban Bus Division, which rebranded as Pace in 1984. In 2022, Pace had 18.041 million riders.

Pace is headquartered in Arlington Heights, Illinois, and is governed by a 13-member Board of Directors, 12 of which are current and former suburban mayors. The remaining director is the Commissioner of the Chicago Mayor&#x27;s Office for People with Disabilities, who represents the city&#x27;s paratransit riders.

==Service area==
Pace serves Cook County, Illinois (where Chicago is located), as well as Lake, Will, Kane, McHenry, and DuPage counties, which are the collar counties of the Chicago metropolitan area. Some of Pace&#x27;s bus routes also go to Chicago and Northwest Indiana. In some areas, notably Evanston, River Forest, Oak Park, Cicero, and Skokie, both Pace and the Chicago Transit Authority provide service.

Many of Pace&#x27;s route terminals are located at CTA rail stations and bus terminals and Metra stations. The CTA and Pace have shared a payment system since 2014 called Ventra. Ventra accounts are required to obtain transfers. In 2015, Metra was added to the Ventra app.

Pace buses generally have longer routes than CTA buses. Due to its geographic service area, service is provided by eleven operating divisions (see below), as well as under agreements with several municipalities and private operators (school bus and motor coach companies). Pace buses provide service from the suburbs to various special events in the city, such as Routes 282 and 779 for Chicago Cubs games, Routes 773, 774 and 775 for Chicago White Sox games, Routes 236, 768, 769 and 776 for Chicago Bears games, Route 222 provides extra service to the Allstate Arena in Rosemont for events scheduled there, Route 284 to Six Flags Great America, Route 307 for events at SeatGeek Stadium in Bridgeview.

== Services ==

=== Pace Bus ===
The majority of Pace bus routes run daily, seven days a week. Other routes run Monday through Saturday, weekdays only, or weekday rush hours only. One route, 352 Halsted, runs 24 hours a day/seven days a week, and four routes 390, 392, 395 and 890, run only for weekday UPS shifts changes. 

During weekday rush hours, Pace buses are authorized to use the shoulder of the Jane Addams Memorial Tollway, Edens Expressway, and Stevenson Expressway to avoid traffic congestion.

=== Pace Pulse ===

====Pulse Milwaukee Line====
Pace began operating a new rapid transit service between the Jefferson Park Transit Center and Golf Mill Shopping Center on August 11, 2019. The new Pulse service overlaps with part of Pace route 270 which saw a reduction in the route&#x27;s service frequency. 

====Pulse Dempster Line====
The Pace Pulse line on Dempster Street spans Evanston, Skokie, and Des Plaines, and terminates at O&#x27;Hare International Airport. The Dempster Pulse line inaugural run was on August 13, 2023 with a full launch on October 29, 2023. The route connects to the Chicago &quot;L&quot; with the CTA Purple Line&#x27;s station and the CTA Yellow Line&#x27;s station. It also connects to Metra stations at on the Union Pacific North Line and on the Union Pacific Northwest Line.

====Priority Corridors for Future Development====
Pace is also considering adding routes from Cermak Road, Harlem Avenue and Roosevelt Road. All three proposed routes start from the southwest side of Chicago and provide routes to either the West Suburbs or in the case of the Harlem route, further south in Chicago.

=== I-90 Express ===
In December 2016, Pace began an on-highway BRT express bus service between Rosemont Transportation Center and Elgin on the Jane Addams Memorial Tollway. The service uses &quot;flex lanes&quot; to avoid traffic and features train station like stops.

=== ADA services ===
Pace is responsible for ADA paratransit service in its service area, and, effective July 1, 2006, for paratransit service in Chicago. Pace also coordinates various Dial-a-Ride projects, usually sponsored by various municipalities and townships. One of the largest is Ride DuPage, sponsored by Du Page County Human Services. All Pace buses are wheelchair accessible and have racks accommodating one bicycle, available during all hours of operation. Pace claims itself as the nation&#x27;s largest paratransit service provider, providing approximately 17,000 daily trips on paratransit, dial-a-ride and ADvAntage vanpools.

=== Vanpool incentive program ===
Pace operates a Vanpool Incentive Program, where groups save by commuting together in a van owned and maintained by Pace and driven by one of the participants. There is also a Municipal Vanpool Program, under which Pace provides a van to a municipality, for any public transportation purpose (such as demand response service for senior citizens).

==Route list==

== Operational structure ==
Given Pace&#x27;s large service area, it is broken up into 11 operating divisions. Additionally, Niles, Highland Park and Schaumburg operate routes on behalf of Pace.

== Bus fleet ==

In 2011, Pace received its first diesel-electric hybrid buses from Orion Bus Industries, a couple of years before the latter folded. These Orion VII buses were the first buses in the Pace fleet to not be powered directly by diesel. In 2015, Pace received its first fleet of compressed natural gas buses from ElDorado National; these buses operate mainly in the southern suburbs.
* Individual units in a series may be retired or out of service (also, a few units in a mostly retired series might still be operating).
* No buses with fleet numbers ending in 13 (20400–20485 consists of 85 buses, and there is no 20413).
* Some routes operated with paratransit or community vehicles.

At Ancestry.com&lt;/ref&gt; was an American character actress; she often played eccentric mothers and later grandmothers and wives, although she was known for numerous other roles. She began her acting career as a young child in theater, and after establishing herself as a Broadway stage actress in 1925, she reprised her role in &quot;Street Scene&quot; for the 1931 film version.
She played supporting roles in several films during the 1930s, and was twice nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. She played the mother of James Stewart in four films: &quot;Of Human Hearts&quot;, &quot;Vivacious Lady&quot;, &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot; (1939), and &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; (1946). Although at her height in Hollywood from the 1930s until the 1950s, Bondi never retired, and she continued acting well into her later years, at the age of 87 winning an Emmy Award for her guest-star role on &quot;The Waltons&quot; in 1976.

==Life and career==
Bondi was born in Chicago, Illinois, the daughter of Eva Suzanna (née Marble), an author, and Abraham O. Bondy, who worked in real estate. The family moved to Valparaiso, Indiana, when she was three, and Bondi began her acting career on the stage at age seven, playing Cedric Errol in a production of &quot;Little Lord Fauntleroy&quot; at the Memorial Opera House in Valparaiso. She graduated from the Frances Shimer Academy (later Shimer College) in 1907, and gained her bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees in oratory at Valparaiso University in 1916 and 1918.

She changed her surname to Bondi and made her Broadway debut in Kenneth Seymour Webb&#x27;s &quot;One of the Family&quot; at the 49th Street Theatre on December 21, 1925. She next appeared in another hit, Maxwell Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Saturday&#x27;s Children,&quot; in 1926. Her performance in Elmer Rice&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning &quot;Street Scene&quot;, which opened at the Playhouse Theatre on January 10, 1929, brought Bondi to the movies at the age of 43. Her debut movie role was as Emma Jones in &quot;Street Scene&quot; (1931), which starred Sylvia Sidney, and in which Bondi reprised her stage role, followed by &quot;Mrs. Davidson&quot; in &quot;Rain&quot; (1932), which starred Joan Crawford and Walter Huston. Along with her roles on Broadway, in 1925 and 1926, Bondi was a Summer Stock cast member at the oldest summer stock theater in the country, Elitch Theatre. 

She was one of the first five women to be nominated for an Academy Award in the newly created category of &quot;Best Supporting Actress&quot; for her work in &quot;The Gorgeous Hussy&quot;, although she lost the award to Gale Sondergaard. Two years later she was nominated again for &quot;Of Human Hearts&quot; and lost again, but her reputation as a character actress kept her employed. For the rest of her career, she would most often be seen in a supporting role as the mother of the star of the film. One exception is the ensemble film &quot;Make Way for Tomorrow&quot; (1937), where she was one of the leads, playing the abandoned Depression-era &#x27;Ma&#x27; Cooper. She often played mature roles in her early film career even though she was only in her early 40s. In 1940 Bondi played Mrs. Webb in &quot;Our Town&quot; and Granny Tucker in &quot;The Southerner&quot;, directed by Jean Renoir and released in 1945.

She was tested for the role of Ma Joad in the film of &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;. Bondi, believing that she had the part, reportedly bought an old jalopy and moved to Bakersfield, California to live among the migrant workers in order to research the role. Bondi was reportedly extremely disappointed at losing the role to Jane Darwell, who won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her work.

For her contributions to the film industry, Bondi received a motion-picture star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960, located at 1718 Vine Street.

Although Bondi played mothers and grandmothers on screen, she was a lifelong bachelorette with no children. She admitted, &quot;I never regretted the choice of a career over marriage, it was a difficult decision and I&#x27;ve never been sorry.&quot;

==Television==
Bondi&#x27;s television credits include &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; and Howard Richardson&#x27;s &quot;Ark of Safety&quot; on the &quot;Goodyear Television Playhouse&quot;. She appeared with Jan Clayton in &quot;The Prairie Story&quot; on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Wagon Train&quot;. She made a guest appearance on &quot;Perry Mason&quot; in 1963 when she played the role of Sophia Stone in &quot;The Case of the Nebulous Nephew&quot;.

Bondi made her final appearances as Martha Corinne Walton on &quot;The Waltons&quot; in the episodes &quot;The Conflict&quot; (September 1974) and &quot;The Pony Cart&quot; (December 1976). She received an Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress for a Single Appearance in a Drama or Comedy Series for her performance in &quot;The Pony Cart&quot;. When her name was called, it first appeared that she was not present, but she received a standing ovation as she walked slowly to the podium, from which she thanked the audience for honoring her while she was still living.
==Death==
Bondi died from pulmonary complications caused by broken ribs suffered when she tripped over her cat in her home on January 11, 1981, at age 92. Her remains were cremated and her ashes scattered at sea.

<doc id="1160051" wikidata="Q6254291" url="?curid=1160051" title="John Rathbun">
<text>John Peck Rathbun (1746–1782) was an officer in the Continental Navy and in the United States Navy. Rathbun was from Rhode Island with family in Boston. Rathbun served in the Continental Navy from its late 1775 beginning as John Paul Jones First Lieutenant.

==Capture of Nassau==
Rathbun was promoted to Captain in April 1777 and given command of the sloop-of-war &quot;Providence&quot; upon which he had participated in an American attack on New Providence in 1776. Rathbun took &quot;Providence&quot; back to the Bahamas on the night of 27 January 1778. Rathbun approached Nassau disguised as a trading sloop and anchored offshore in darkness. Twenty-six marines under command of Captain John Trevett went ashore by boat with a scaling ladder. They climbed Fort Nassau&#x27;s 22-foot walls with the ladder and overpowered the two guards before daybreak. The Marines then continued sending the guards&#x27; periodic &quot;All is well&quot; call to guards outside of the fort while repositioned the fort&#x27;s 18-pound cannon to cover parts of the city and harbor from which reinforcements might arrive. Dawn found the American stars and stripes flying over conquered enemy territory for the first time since the Continental Congress approved the flag. While his remaining marines patrolled the wall in full view of the city, Trevett sent three Marines to Fort Montague with a claim that a force of 230 Marines held Fort Nassau. Fort Montague surrendered, and Marines spiked the cannon and poured the gunpowder into the sea. Twenty-four American merchant seamen came forward to assist. The Americans had been stranded in Nassau when their ships had been captured by privateers. The American merchant seamen were sent into the harbor to demand surrender of five ships lying under the guns of Fort Nassau. Rathbun brought &quot;Providence&quot; into harbor in the early afternoon, and loaded all Fort Nassau&#x27;s gunpowder and 300 small arms. Rathbun departed on the morning of 30th, with three captured ships manned by the American merchant seamen, after spiking the guns of Fort Nassau and burning the two ships he could not man. No blood had been shed.

==Action At Sea==
In 1779, he assumed command of the frigate &quot;Queen of France&quot; and in July cruised off Newfoundland with &quot;Providence&quot; and &quot;Ranger&quot;. On the 16th, the ships sighted a convoy bound for Britain. Fog closed in, but when it lifted, &quot;Queen of France&quot; was next to a merchantman whose crew mistook the American for a British escort vessel. Rathbun took advantage of the situation, exploited the mistake in identity, and captured the ship. &quot;Ranger&quot; and &quot;Providence&quot; followed suit. Ten more ships were cut out of the convoy, their total value approaching $1 million.

==Defense of Charleston==
In 1780, Rathbun took &quot;Queen of France&quot; south in Commodore Abraham Whipple&#x27;s force to bolster the defenses of Charleston, South Carolina. There, with smaller ships, she was stationed in the Ashley River to prevent British forces under Cornwallis from crossing and attacking the city. As the American position weakened, &quot;Queen of France&#x27;s&quot; guns were removed and she was sunk as a block ship. Her crew then went ashore and Rathbun served as an artilleryman until the city fell in May 1781. 

==Privateer==
Taken prisoner at the fall of Charleston, Rathbun and the other American captains were paroled and allowed to return to New England. There, he found that the Continental Navy had dwindled and no commands were available. Thereupon, Rathbun, a true patriot, secured a commission from Congress on 4 August to command the Massachusetts privateer brig &quot;Wexford&quot;. About two weeks later, he set sail from Boston bound for St. George&#x27;s Channel near Britain and, within another six weeks reached the coast of Ireland. There, less than 100 miles from Cape Clear, he ran afoul of the 32-gun frigate HMS &quot;Recovery&quot;. Following a 24-hour chase during which HMS &quot;Recovery&quot; fired at least one broadside, Rathbun and his ship were captured by the British warship. 

Incarcerated first at Kinsale Prison near Cork, Ireland, Rathbun was later transferred to Mill Prison or Old Mill Prison in Plymouth, England, where he died on 20 June 1782.

==Namesakes==
Two ships, USS &quot;Rathburne&quot;, were named for him. Although his name was spelled Rathburne or Rathbourne in official records, including the two warships named after him, this was an error. His name was Rathbun.

<text>Huntingdon County is an historical county in southwestern Quebec, Canada. It is named after the town and county of the same name (Huntingdon, Huntingdonshire) in east central England. It is situated in the Montreal South Shore region of Montérégie, one of the roughly 12 regions of Quebec. The county was bounded entirely on its south by the Canada–US border (45° N for 88.75 km from 73°32′ W to 74°40′ W), along its northwestern flank by Lake St-Francis (Lac St-François) of the Saint Lawrence River to its most northern point on the river at 45°13′ N and 74°13′ W, to the east by Saint-Jean County, with its easternmost point at 45°5.5&#x27; N and 73°31′ W (this point forms the junction of the borders of Châteauguay County, Napierville County and Saint-Jean County) and to the north from east to west by Napierville County, Châteauguay County, and Beauharnois County. On the other side of the Saint Lawrence River is Soulanges County, Quebec, the Township of Lancaster and the Township of Charlottenburgh in Glengarry County, Ontario, and the Township of Cornwall in Stormont County, Ontario.

Huntingdon County is the only county in the St Lawrence Valley to be entirely and totally divided into townships, of which there are 7. All these townships run in a straight line and have the Canada–US border as a common southern border. From east to west they are the Township of Hemmingford, the Township of Havelock, the Franklin Township, the Township of Hinchinbrooke, the Township of Elgin, the Township of Godmanchester, and the Township of Dundee. The county seat, Huntingdon, located at 45°5′ N and 74°10′ W, straddles the border between Hinchinbrooke and Godmanchester. Except for Godmanchester, all the other townships have a community that takes the name of the township in which it is situated (Hemmingford, Havelock, Franklin, Hinchinbrooke, Elgin, Dundee).

A notable feature of Huntingdon County is the presence of the Saint Regis Akwesasne Mohawk Reserve at the westernmost point of the county in the Township of Dundee. That area of the Saint Lawrence, like many along its length, contains many small islands. The Reserve straddles the meeting point of the Quebec-Ontario-New York State borders at that point. The American side of the Reserve is Franklin County, New York.

On 1 January 1982, the county was officially dissolved. Most of the County became part of the MRC de Le Haut-Saint-Laurent except for a small section in the far east (The Township of Hemmingford and the Village of Hemmingford) which became part of MRC de Les Jardins-de-Napierville.

<doc id="1160064" wikidata="Q2631975" url="?curid=1160064" title="Chorale cantata">
<text>A chorale cantata is a church cantata based on a chorale—in this context a Lutheran chorale. It is principally from the German Baroque era. The organizing principle is the words and music of a Lutheran hymn. Usually a chorale cantata includes multiple movements or parts. Most chorale cantatas were written between approximately 1650 and 1750. By far the most famous are by Johann Sebastian Bach, especially the cantatas composed in his second annual cycle of cantatas, started in Leipzig in 1724.

==Description==

The chorale cantata developed out of the chorale concerto, an earlier form much used by Samuel Scheidt in the early 17th century, which incorporated elements of the Venetian School, such as the concertato style, into the liturgical music of the Protestant Reformation. Later the chorale cantata developed into three general forms:
* a form in which each verse (strophe) of the chorale was developed as an independent movement;
* a form in which the chorale appeared in some of the movements, perhaps only two, while the other parts of the cantata used other texts; and
* the version pioneered by J. S. Bach, in which the first and last movements use the first and last strophes of the chorale, but the inner movements—perhaps aria and recitative—use paraphrases of the chorale text. Typically the beginning and ending movements use all the instrumental and vocal forces, while the interior movements are for smaller groups.

Most compositions in this genre were never published. It was common at the time for composers to write for local performances; often the composer and the music director at a church were the same person, and the music was written, copied and performed in short order, remaining in manuscript. Some 95% of all compositions of this type have been lost.

<doc id="1160065" wikidata="Q1375077" url="?curid=1160065" title="Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles">
<text>The , often shortened as the , are a baseball team based in Sendai, Miyagi Prefecture, Japan. It has played in Nippon Professional Baseball&#x27;s Pacific League since the team&#x27;s formation in November 2004. The team is owned by the Internet shopping company Rakuten.

==History==
===2004: Origins and formation===

During Nippon Professional Baseball&#x27;s (NPB) 2004 season, the Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes and the Orix BlueWave announced that the two teams planned to merge into one for the start of the 2005 season. Both teams were in the Pacific League (PL), and a merger between the two would result in a team imbalance with the PL&#x27;s opposing league, the Central League (CL). As a large number of players and personnel were expected to lose their jobs when the merger was finalized, the players conducted a two-day strike on September 18–19, 2004. With the threat of further strikes looming, team representatives agreed to ease the rules of entry for new teams into NPB and that one would be allowed to join the following season. To fill the void left by the merger, internet services companies Livedoor and Rakuten submitted applications to form teams to be based in Sendai, Miyagi Prefecture. NPB selected Rakuten to create a Sendai-based PL team. The team would play its home games in Miyagi Baseball Stadium, which was being renovated by Rakuten. Marty Kuehnert and Yasushi Tao were hired as general manager and manager, respectively, of their newly named &quot;Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles&quot; baseball club. The name is derived from the Japanese golden eagle, a large, endangered, predatory bird found in the mountains of Japan&#x27;s Tōhoku region.

Instead of allowing the Eagles to draft players from all 11 NPB teams in an expansion draft, the team had to construct their roster from the 107 players left over from the dissolved Kintetsu and original Orix teams during a special dispersal draft. Orix was allowed to protect 25 players from the distribution process before the draft, thus giving them preferential signing rights. Included in these selections were all free agents and foreign players. Rakuten was then allowed to select 20 unprotected players, not including any first- or second-year players. After that, the first- and second-year players were unprotected and Orix and Rakuten alternated selecting 20 more players for the last round of the draft. The league&#x27;s decision to employ an unequal dispersal draft to build the Eagles roster was blamed for the team&#x27;s struggles to come. Rakuten was able to select former Buffaloes outfielder Koichi Isobe because he was left unprotected by Orix after refusing to play for their newly formed team. Similarly, the Eagles were able to acquire Buffaloes star pitcher Hisashi Iwakuma. Despite voicing that he had no intention of playing for the merged team, Orix still protected him. After, negotiations took place between Iwakuma and Orix that resulted in Orix trading him to the Eagles.

===2005–2009: Debut and the road to the Climax Series===
Just over a month into their first season, the Eagles removed Kuehnert as general manager and demoted the head and batting coaches following a 6–22 start. The team finished 51.5 games out of first place and was the first NPB team in 40 years to lose over 90 games in a single season. As a result, ten players were released, and Tao was dismissed despite being signed to a three-year contract. In an otherwise disastrous season, one highlight was the team&#x27;s home debut. Only five months after being awarded a franchise and without a preseason game as a dry run, Rakuten ran and operated the game smoothly in front of a packed, partially-renovated Miyagi Stadium. It was also estimated that the economic impact of the team in the Tōhoku region was $300 million in the first year. Rakuten planned to spend more than ¥1 billion on enhancing player training and about ¥3 billion on the continuing remodel of the ballpark. The stadium&#x27;s off-season renovations expanded its seating capacity and added amenities. Mikitani looked to experience to lead the Eagles in its second season when he replaced first-time manager Tao with Hall of Famer and veteran manager Katsuya Nomura, signing him to a three-year contract. The team improved slightly over its first season, and third baseman José Fernández went on to receive the Eagles&#x27; first Best Nine Award in his first season with the team. However, the 2006 season also brought the Eagles&#x27; their first no-hit loss, and they still finished last in the Pacific League. At the end of the season, Rakuten drafted pitcher Masahiro Tanaka in the first round of the 2006 amateur high school draft.

The Eagles&#x27; first real signs of improvement came during the 2007 season, the team&#x27;s third. Takeshi Yamasaki led the league in home runs through May and was named the PL MVP for the month of May, the team&#x27;s first. He went on to be selected by fans to the Pacific League All-Star team for the 2007 All-Star Series, receiving the most votes of any player overall. With one of the All-Star games being played at the Eagles&#x27; home stadium that year, fans also voted in seven other Rakuten players, including rookie pitcher Tanaka. Rakuten finished the season with a losing record, however, for the first time they did not finish the season in last, instead finishing in fourth. At the end of the season, Yamasaki led the league in both home runs and runs batted in (RBIs) and Tanaka was awarded the PL Rookie of the Year Award. The team finished fifth next season, however, Iwakuma finished with the best earned run average (ERA) and most wins in the league after struck by injuries the previous few years. At season&#x27;s end, he was presented with his and the team&#x27;s first PL Most Valuable Player (MVP) and Eiji Sawamura Awards. In the 2008–09 offseason, the Eagles extended Nomura&#x27;s contract to keep him on as manager for one more year. Rakuten secured second place in the Pacific League the next season and advanced to the Climax Series for the first time. A pair of complete game wins at home both by Iwakuma and Tanaka in the first stage allowed the Eagles to advance but the team lost to the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters in four games in the second stage, ending their season.

===2010–2013: From disaster to championship===
Rakuten hired American Marty Brown to succeed Nomura as manager. Even though Brown was signed to a two-year contract, he was let go a year later after the Eagles finished the 2010 season in last place. The club looked to Senichi Hoshino next to turn the team around. Kazuo Matsui and Akinori Iwamura, both returning from playing stints in Major League Baseball (MLB), were also added to the roster, and Teppei Tsuchiya was named as the team&#x27;s first ever captain. On March 11, 2011, two weeks before the first game of the season, the Tōhoku region was struck by the largest earthquake in the country&#x27;s history. The quake and the subsequent tsunami devastated the region, including the Eagles&#x27; home city of Sendai. With the season opener postponed until April 12, the team continued to train in the Kansai region because of the aftermath in Sendai. In addition to Rakuten holding fund-raising events, all 12 teams played charity games to help raise money for earthquake relief. They hosted their first &quot;home&quot; game at Koshien Stadium while restoration work to Miyagi Stadium continued. Baseball returned to Sendai on April 12, when the Eagles played their first game at their home field. Furthermore, the final game of the 2011 All-Star Series was switched from Tokyo Dome to Miyagi Stadium, the second time the Eagles hosted the event since 2007. Rakuten finished the 2011 season in fifth and again missed the playoffs. However, in addition to winning a Golden Glove and a Best Nine award, Tanaka was also named PL MVP of the month three times over the course of the season, a first for the Pacific League.

After the season, Hisashi Iwakuma left the club to play in MLB. Rakuten went deep into the 2012 season as a playoff contender that year, but ultimately missed advancing to the Climax Series by one game and finished fourth. Before the start of the 2013 season, the Eagles signed former MLB players Casey McGehee and Andruw Jones. The Eagles finished April in fifth place, however, the next two months saw Tanaka winning consecutive PL MVP of the month awards, helping the club to finish June in second. The team took sole possession of first place in the Pacific League in early July and never relinquished it, winning the Eagles&#x27; their first PL pennant. Over the remaining three months of the season, Tanaka continued to win games and finished the season with 24 wins and no losses. He was awarded a record-setting five consecutive monthly MVPs from May to September. As league champions, the Eagles advanced directly to the final stage of the Climax Series Final where they defeated the Chiba Lotte Marines to advance to their first Japan Series. Rakuten defeated the Yomiuri Giants at home in the final game of a seven-game series to win the franchise&#x27;s first and only Japan Series championship. Game 6 of that Japan Series would also mark the only loss, including postseason games, that Tanaka would be given, after pitching a 160 pitch complete game in Game 6, but he followed it up in what would be his final game before being posted to the Yankees, a save in Game 7. Starting pitcher Manabu Mima was named the Japan Series MVP after the series, and at the end of the season, Tanaka was presented with the PL MVP and Eiji Sawamura Awards, Norimoto was named the PL Rookie of the Year, and Senichi Hoshino was given the Matsutaro Shoriki Award. After the increased ticket demand during the 2013 season, an expansion project that increased Miyagi Stadium&#x27;s maximum seating capacity above 28,000 was completed the next year.

===2014–2017: Post-Tanaka struggles===
Following the championship-winning season, Masahiro Tanaka left the Eagles via the posting system to play for the New York Yankees, netting the team a $20 million transfer fee in return. Likewise, McGehee also left for MLB, and the team struggled in the years following their departures, finishing last the next season. This disappointing finish prompted manager Senichi Hoshino to resign despite ownership wanting him to return for a fifth season. Rakuten promoted their farm team manager Hiromoto Okubo to manager. At the end of July, hitting coach Tomio Tashiro abruptly resigned and it was revealed that owner Hiroshi Mikitani had often been interfering in on-the-field decisions, such as dictating the batting order. After Tashiro&#x27;s resignation, Mikitani began conferring with field personnel before making any decisions, however the team again finished in last and Okubo resigned at the end of the season. The turmoil brought about by Mikitani taking the lead on baseball operations after Hoshino&#x27;s unexpected resignation forced Rakuten to reevaluate how the team was managed and organized. It was decided that Hoshino, who had been retained as an Eagles vice chairman, would have full authority over baseball operations, similar to the role of an MLB general manager.

In preparation for the 2016 season, Miyagi Stadium underwent its last major renovation during the offseason, increasing its capacity to over 30,000 people. The team, hoping to avoid a third consecutive last-place finish, hired veteran PL manager Masataka Nashida and signed free agent Toshiaki Imae, a two-time Japan Series MVP. During the season, Rakuten formed a training team to help further develop talent by playing against university, corporate, club, and independent teams. The Eagles avoided finishing the season in last, however they placed fifth and again missed the playoffs. The 2017 Eagles, however, found themselves battling the Saitama Seibu Lions near the end of the season for second place. Ultimately, the team secured a first stage Climax Series berth against the Lions with a third-place finish. After losing the first game of the three-game series, Rakuten won the final two to defeat Seibu and advance to the final stage. Against the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks, the Eagles took the first two games of the series but were eliminated after the Hawks won the next three.

===2018–present: Ishii as general manager and Tanaka returns===
Hoshino died in January 2018. Following the death, Rakuten erected a memorial flower stand in front of the newly named Rakuten Seimei Park Miyagi. Mikitani then announced that Hoshino&#x27;s uniform number 77 would be retired permanently just before the start of the season. The Eagles struggled immediately that season, falling to 20 games under .500 by mid-June. Taking responsibility for the team&#x27;s poor performance, Nashida resigned as manager that month and head coach Yosuke Hiraishi acted as interim manager for the remainder of the season. The Eagles went on to finish the season in last, however before it was over Rakuten formally created a general manager (GM) position in Hoshino&#x27;s absence. Former NPB and MLB pitcher Kazuhisa Ishii was hired in the role to help coordinate the efforts of the front office and field management.

Hiraishi was kept on as full-time manager for the 2019 season and led the Eagles to a third-place finish and a postseason berth. However, the team was defeated by the Hawks in the first stage. After the loss, another managerial change was made and Hajime Miki was promoted from farm team manager. The Eagles failed to make the playoffs in the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, and Ishii sent Miki back to manage the farm team after only one season. To replace him, Ishii appointed himself as manager starting with the 2021 season. Meanwhile, the conclusion of MLB&#x27;s 2020 season marked the end of Masahiro Tanaka&#x27;s seven-year contract with the Yankees. Instead of signing with another MLB team, Tanaka chose to return to play in Japan and signed a two-year contract with Rakuten. The next season, a third-place finish secured the Eagles a place in the 2021 PL Climax Series, however a loss and a tie against the Marines ensured that Rakuten would not advance to the final stage.

===Retired numbers===
*10 – Rakuten announced on December 4, 2004, during the early stages of the team&#x27;s formation, that the uniform number 10 would be retired prior to the Eagles&#x27; first season. The number represents Eagles fans and signifies them as the team&#x27;s 10th member following its nine starting fielders. It has never been worn by an Eagles manager, coach, or player, however, the team&#x27;s mascot Clutch wears the number on his uniform and acts as the fans&#x27; representative.

* 77 - Following Senichi Hoshino&#x27;s death in early 2018, Rakuten announced on March 26 that they would be retiring his uniform number 77. Hoshino managed the Eagles for four season from 2011–2014, including during their only Japan Series win in 2013, and stayed with the team as a vice-chairman after his retirement until his death. This number is also the only manager uniform number to be retired in NPB. Other players that went on to manage and subsequently had their numbers retired retained the same uniform number throughout their playing and managerial careers. Hoshino, however, changed his uniform number to 77 when he first started managing the Chunichi Dragons and retained that number throughout his managerial career with the Hanshin Tigers and later the Eagles.

===Logos and uniforms===
The Eagles&#x27; team color is crimson red, the corporate color of its parent company, Rakuten. Yellow was added as an accent color to represent a golden eagle. The team&#x27;s logo applies a golden eagle motif to the word &quot;Eagles&quot;, which has wings added to its left and right sides. The word &quot;Rakuten&quot; sits at atop in a smaller, simpler font. The winged &quot;E&quot; from this logo also serves as the team&#x27;s cap insignia. The club&#x27;s home and away uniforms both include the same crimson caps bearing this insignia. Starting with the 2020 season, &#x27;47 supplies the caps for the team. Their glossy helmets mimic the cap design and are created using a traditional Miyagi Prefecture lacquer technique called &quot;tamamushi-nuri&quot;. The supplier of Rakuten&#x27;s uniforms has changed several times. At the start of the 2011 season, Descente provided all of the team&#x27;s uniforms and apparel. Then, from 2014 to 2019, the team had a contract with Majestic Athletic, the then-supplier of MLB. Since the start of the 2020 season, Mizuno Corporation has supplied the uniforms and apparel for the Eagles. The Eagles&#x27; uniforms bear the logos of various sponsors on the jersey, pants, cap, and helmet.

====Home and visitor uniforms====

The Eagles home uniforms are all white. The pants are white with crimson piping from beltline to cuff on each side and have not changed since being introduced. For the team&#x27;s inaugural season, the front of the white, button-down jersey displayed the team&#x27;s logo along with the player&#x27;s number in crimson outlined in yellow. The raglan lines on the shoulders and sides featured crimson piping, and the back displayed the player&#x27;s name and number in the same style as the front number. The right sleeve displayed Rakuten&#x27;s corporate logo. The jersey underwent a small design change for the 2011 season when the fonts for the player&#x27;s name and numbers were simplified to match the font on the visitor jersey. Then, after the Tōhoku earthquake, a patch reading was added to the left sleeve as a symbol of support. This patch has been featured on every home and visitor uniform since it was first added. Before the 2018 season, the home jersey design was again tweaked. All of the yellow was changed to gold, including the chest logo, its first change. Additionally, the raglan and side piping was removed in favor of crimson and gold stripes around the collar and sleeves and the font of the player&#x27;s name and numbers was again modified. The club&#x27;s current home jersey debuted before the 2020 season and is very similar to its previous iteration, albeit with the crimson and gold collar stripes removed.

The team&#x27;s visitor uniform has undergone more drastic changes since the first design. The same pants worn with the home jerseys are utilized for the visitor uniforms, however the button-down jersey is crimson red and bears the name of the team&#x27;s owner &quot;Rakuten&quot; on the chest. In the garment&#x27;s first iteration, the white Rakuten logo was wholly original and incorporated a yellow drop shadow to give it a 3D effect. White piping along the raglan lines on the shoulders and sides was added and the player&#x27;s number in white appeared on the front. The back displayed the player&#x27;s name and number, again in white. As with the home jerseys, the right sleeve displayed Rakuten&#x27;s corporate logo. Its first design change came one year before the home jersey&#x27;s when the chest logo was changed in 2009. All yellow was removed leaving the logo completely white, and the font was changed to bring it in line with Rakuten&#x27;s corporate branding. Additionally, the font of the name and numbers was simplified. The font used for the name and numbers was again modified for the 2014 season. The next change to the visitor jersey occurred in 2018, the same time as the home design change. Again keeping with the changes to the corporate logo, a white line was added under &quot;Rakuten&quot; on the chest. The raglan and side piping was also removed in favor of white stripes around the collar and sleeves. The Eagles&#x27; current visitor jersey again debuted alongside the home jersey. Similarly, the stripes around the collar were removed, however a gold stripe was added to the white stripes around the sleeves. Gold outlines were also added to the back name and number and the front chest number was removed for the first time.

====Third and special uniforms====

Throughout the team&#x27;s history, there have also been several alternate and limited-time uniform designs. A third alternate uniform was introduced in 2006 for home games during interleague play. These were primarily white with crimson sides and shoulders outlined by yellow piping along the raglan lines. The left side of the chest featured the cap emblem, while the right featured the player&#x27;s number in crimson outlined in yellow. It was redesigned for the 2010 and 2011 seasons and worn at several games played in the Tōhoku region before being discontinued. The chest displayed the words &quot;Tohoku&quot; and &quot;Rakuten&quot; in crimson, with the &quot;E&quot; logo moved instead to the sleeve and the player&#x27;s chest number removed altogether. The yellow piping was removed in favor of yellow and white stripes around the sleeve cuff.

Other than the third alternate uniform, the Eagles have also worn many limited, seasonal uniforms throughout their history that often have unique designs, colors, and sleeve patches. Starting with the 2007 season, players wore special uniforms during a limited, home-game stretch dubbed &quot;Fan Club Day&quot;. From 2007 to 2009, each season&#x27;s uniform was selected from a pool of fan-submitted designs and were variants of their white, home jersey. After skipping the 2010 season, the event returned in 2011, however the design contest was no longer employed. In an effort to fill the stands with color for the event, the jersey was changed to crimson, a color traditionally used only for road games, for 2012 and 2013. In 2014, these jerseys were rebranded as the &quot;Fans&#x27;&quot; uniform and were worn for home games played throughout the Tōhoku region. To reflect this, the Eagles&#x27; chest logo was removed from the crimson jersey and instead replaced with the word &quot;Tohoku&quot;. A patch was also added to the sleeve that season to commemorate the team&#x27;s 2013 Japan Series win. This general design continued to be utilized for Fans&#x27; Days through the 2018 season. For the 2019 season, Rakuten&#x27;s fifteenth, the Fans&#x27; uniform was changed and again borrowed the home jersey design, however in grey instead of white. The next year, the same design was kept but the base color was changed to black, and it would be worn again in 2021 after the COVID pandemic limited fan attendance in 2020.

In addition to the various Fans&#x27; uniform iterations, the Eagles have worn several themed seasonal uniforms throughout its history. The first was introduced in 2011 to celebrate the team&#x27;s seventh season, a lucky number in Japan. The design, dubbed the &quot;Eagle Rainbow&quot;, was drastically different from the team&#x27;s previous uniforms. The jersey was the team&#x27;s only v-neck pullover and was white and crimson with seven different shades of red, orange, and yellow. The chest bore the word &quot;Eagles&quot; in a simple dark blue font with a logo illustration of an eagle underneath. The cap emblem was also changed to feature the same &quot;E&quot; as on the chest. The uniforms were worn during four interleague games that season, and the player-worn jerseys were auctioned off to raise money for earthquake relief. The team has worn a special summer uniform every season since, and next season Rakuten unveiled the &quot;Eagle Star&quot; uniform, which added crimson, full-body pinstripes to the home design. The &quot;Tohoku Green&quot; theme was introduced in 2013 and variations of the same uniform was used for three seasons. To bring attention to the conservation of Tōhoku&#x27;s forests, the jerseys were green and displayed &quot;Tohoku&quot; across the chest. Full-body crimson pinstripes were brought back in 2016, this time extending to the cap as well. These &quot;Eagle Summer&quot; uniforms also displayed &quot;Rakuten&quot; on the chest. The next two seasons featured black jerseys and caps. The first, &quot;Black Eagles&quot; in 2017, was a black version of the home uniforms. The following year, the &quot;Tōhoku Pride&quot; uniform was a black version of that year&#x27;s Fans&#x27; uniform. The current special uniform theme is &quot;Tohoku Blue&quot;, a companion to the green theme. First introduced in 2019, the jersey design was similar to the previous year&#x27;s, however it was blue to represent the sky. The colors were modified for the following season when it changed to white with blue pinstripes. As with the Fans&#x27; uniform, 2020&#x27;s Tohoku Blue uniforms are returning for 2021.

===Mascots===
At the time of team&#x27;s inception, Rakuten created a pair of unnamed male and female golden eagle mascots. The name Clutch (and the feminine Clutchena) was selected from approximately 6,500 suggestions that were solicited from the public. The name has a double meaning derived from the word &quot;clutch&quot;, such as the grasp of an eagle&#x27;s claw, as well as the baseball concept of a clutch hitter. Clutch wears a jersey bearing the number 10, an Eagles retired number that represents the fans. A third mascot, a harpy eagle named Switch, was unveiled in 2016. The Eagles have also periodically featured an unofficial, mischievous mascot named Mr. Carrasco. The character, based on a black crow, is masked and rides a motorcycle. For Black Eagles Day in 2017, Rakuten added a mascot character called Kurowashi-san. Unlike the other costumed mascots, Kurowashi-san appeared as a normal man with a black eagle on his head.

<text>Daniel Waters (June 20, 1731 – March 26, 1816) was an officer in the Continental Navy and in the United States Navy.

==Biography==
He was born on June 20, 1731, in Charlestown, Massachusetts, and was one of the &quot;minutemen&quot; who engaged the British at the onset of the American Revolutionary War. Later placed in charge of a small gunboat during the siege of British troops in Boston, Waters was appointed by General George Washington to command the schooner &quot;Lee&quot; on January 20, 1776. He was soon actively engaged in the ensuing assault upon British communications, capturing one enemy vessel in February and another in May. Aided by Warren, Lee seized an armed troopship with 94 Scottish Highlander troops on board in early June. Later in the month, Waters and Lee shared with other vessels the capture of transports &quot;Howe&quot; and &quot;Annabella&quot;.

Again at the recommendation of Washington, Waters was appointed a captain in the Continental Navy on March 15, 1777, and given command of the frigate &quot;Fox&quot;. Shortly thereafter, Waters and Fox, along with Hancock, were forced to surrender to superior British forces off Halifax, Nova Scotia. Following an exchange in 1778, Waters made a cruise to the West Indies in the spring of 1779 in the Continental sloop &quot;General Gates&quot;. He then commanded the Massachusetts ship &quot;General Putnam&quot; in an ill-fated expedition against Castine, Maine, in which the American ships were destroyed in the mouth of the Penobscot River to prevent their capture .

Waters&#x27; most famous exploit occurred on Christmas Day, 1779, when he led the Boston privateer &quot;Thorn&quot; in a successful, two-hour action against two enemy privateers of about equal armament, but more heavily manned. In the fierce fight, during which Governor William Tryon and Sir William Erskine were captured, Waters was wounded. John Adams was to write of this engagement: &quot;There has not been a more memorable action this war.&quot;

Waters&#x27; last cruise was in the Massachusetts privateer &quot;Friendship&quot;, to which he was appointed in January 1781. Following the war, Waters retired to his farm in Malden, Massachusetts, where he died on March 26, 1816.

==Namesake==
USS &quot;Waters&quot; (DD-115) was named for him.

<doc id="1160077" wikidata="Q7681921" url="?curid=1160077" title="Tamworth Country Music Festival">
<text>The Tamworth Country Music Festival is an annual Australian music festival held for 10 days from Friday to Sunday in mid to late January each year, sometimes including Australia Day, in Tamworth, New South Wales. The festival is the second biggest country music festival in the world, after the CMA Music Festival in Nashville, Tennessee, USA.

The festival is a celebration of country music culture and heritage, in particular the national Australian country music scene, with numerous concerts and live performances at various venues. During the festival the city of Tamworth comes alive with visitors from all across the country and worldwide. The festival has many times been counted among the world&#x27;s top ten music festivals. In 2007, &quot;Forbes&quot; rated it as number 8 of the &quot;World&#x27;s Coolest Music Festivals&quot;.

The enormous number of visitors during the doubles the city&#x27;s population and brings significant tourism and economic benefits to the region. Visitor numbers for the 2012 festival were estimated at 50,000. The mass number of visitors means that accommodation throughout the area is consistently booked out for this period up to 12 months in advance, with many visitors camping in caravans, camper vans and tents by the city&#x27;s riverside and numerous other temporary camping sites throughout the region.

==Media coverage==
A significant amount of media coverage is given locally and national, in the printed media and also with the three big commercial networks the Nine Network, Seven Network and Ten Network having broadcast news and segments from the festival. There is also national radio coverage from stations including ABC Country, ABC Radio and KIX Country.

==History==
When the Tamworth Country Music Festival commenced is often debated. In 1968 the then Tamworth branch of the Modern Country Music Association, now the Capital Country Music Association (CCMA), began a talent quest on the Australia Day long weekend in January. The talent quest, now known as the CCMA National Talent Quest, is considered a major influence in what was to become the festival in January 1973 with the first staging, by local radio station, of the Australasian Country Music Awards (aka the Golden Guitar Awards for its distinctive &quot;golden guitar&quot; trophy) as part of its Country Music Capital promotion which had commenced in 1969.

The festival expanded to many other activities, with events running back throughout the week before the Awards and National Talent Quest staged on what was then the Australia Day long weekend. These events included Bluegrass Championships, Hands of Fame inductions, the Roll of Renown, rodeo events, Coca-Cola Concerts, Toyota Star Maker Quest, Tamworth Songwriters&#x27; Association Awards, busking in Peel Street, the Cavalcade and industry seminars among other events. These events were promoted to highlight Australian Country Music and to draw attention to the climax of the 10 days, the Golden Guitar Awards.

Radio 2TM ran the awards until 1993 when they were passed on to the newly formed national industry organisation, the Country Music Association of Australia (CMAA).

The staging of the Golden Guitar Awards moved from Sunday to the Saturday night in the last weekend of the festival in late January as the Australia Day public holiday was moved to float with the 26 January date.

=== Impact of COVID-19 ===
As late as 15 June 2020, the 2021 Festival was set to go ahead. On 8 September 2020 Tamworth Regional Councillors voted to suspend all Tamworth Regional Council run events at the 2021 Toyota Country Music Festival, effectively cancelling the 49th Tamworth Festival. It is the first time in its history the annual event has been cancelled. The annual Golden Guitar Awards were planned to proceed via online streaming. In announcing the decision Festival Manager Barry Harley said &quot;Unfortunately, like so many others in our situation, we have had to surrender to the challenges COVID has placed on us and make the difficult decision to suspend TCMF2021.&quot; Tamworth Region Mayor Col Murray also stated that in making the decision council had &quot;the health and safety of our community, our fans, the artists, volunteers, local businesses, staff, and the wider country music industry front of mind.&quot; As of 9 September 2020, organisers were confident the 2022 event would proceed as usual, enabling the 50th anniversary of the event to be celebrated. However, on 7 January 2022, the NSW government announced the reintrodction of some COVID control &quot;safety measures&quot;. As a result, the festival was postponed to April 2022.

==Music==

===Styles===
Since the festival&#x27;s original commencement the following music genres have been performed: classic country, bluegrass, country rock, folk, urban country, alternative country, rockabilly, Western swing, country rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll, yodelling, rock, blues and World music. The festival has diversified in styles of country as the genre country music itself has broadened, additionally other styles of music are played at the festival.

===Festival awards===

====Golden Guitar Awards====
The CMAA&#x27;s awards night ceremony is called the Country Music Awards of Australia, in which winning artists are presented with Golden Guitar Award trophies that are miniature replicas of the Golden Guitar statue. These awards are highly coveted in the Australian country music industry. The presentation of awards is regarded as the pinnacle event of the Tamworth Country Music Festival.

===Main and Peel streets===
During the music festival the main shopping street (Peel Street) is restricted to pedestrians only. In this area, buskers are required to register with the local council. There is also a competition between these registered buskers to find the festival&#x27;s best busker. There has been complaint and controversy about the use of very loud PA systems against acoustic performances. Council officers are known to walk the street with decibel meters during performances. Since January is a summer month with daytime temperatures regularly hovering around 38 °C, it is during the nighttime that the city really comes to life, with people heading down town to drink, dance and generally party while numerous bands play up and down the main street.

==Venues==
During the festival over 2500 acts use up to 120 venues. The largest venue used is the Tamworth Regional Entertainment Centre which has a capacity of 5100 people.

==Festival Countdown==
The Festival Countdown is the &quot;pre-festival&quot; festival. During this week before the festival many country music fans come to Tamworth to set up camp and enjoy the city, while there are also dozens of concerts scheduled during this week.

==Attractions==
Besides the music the festival has many other country music attractions for visitors. These include the Big Golden Guitar, Country Music Wax Museum, Hands of Fame Park and the National Guitar Museum of successful country music artists. Additionally fine arts, crafts, street performers and markets attract large crowds in Peel St.

The Country Music Cavalcade on the last Saturday of the festival attracts large crowds to Peel Street, with many businesses and musicians participating with floats in the parade.

==Preparation==
During the buildup prior to the commencement of celebrations, the Tamworth Regional Council takes steps to beautify and secure the city, performing such works as:
* Erecting signs to direct traffic away from hot spots, and reduce congestion.
* Pre-Festival advertising and promotional campaigns.
* Extensive road maintenance.
* Blocking traffic from four blocks of Peel Street, the central shopping district.
* Co-ordinating and tidying the expansive camping grounds.
* Co-ordinating with the CMAA (Country Music Association of Australia) in connection with events.
* Co-ordination with law enforcement and security bodies.

==Artist lineups==

The Tamworth Country Music Festival attracts many country music, bluegrass, rock and folk musicians to the city each year. Performers perform at various venues in the city. The festival attracts over 800 different artists which perform over 5000 shows.

Artists who perform regularly at the festival include Kasey Chambers, Troy Cassar-Daley, Lee Kernaghan, John Williamson and Colin Buchanan. Other&#x27;s include Melinda Schneider and Beccy Cole. The late Slim Dusty was also a regular. The festival is noted for being the launching platform of Keith Urban and Kasey Chambers&#x27; careers. The Australian country icon Smoky Dawson was also a regular and has a grill called &quot;Smoky&#x27;s Grill&quot; named in his honour.

The prominence of the festival is such that artists from outside Australia are frequent performers at Tamworth. New Zealand performers in particular are regular attendees, including the likes of Suzanne Prentice, Patsy Riggir, Brendan Dugan, Dusty Spittle, and The Warratahs.

Many hundreds of musicians played at the 2012 festival at clubs, pubs and in Peel St, busking. Some of the better known artists that performed at the 2012 festival or have performed in the past include:

<text>USS &quot;Sea Poacher&quot; (SS/AGSS-406), a , was a vessel of the United States Navy named for the sea poacher, a slender, mailed fish of the North Atlantic.

&quot;Sea Poacher&quot; (SS-406) was built by the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine; launched on 20 May 1944; sponsored by Mrs. J. H. Spiller, wife of Commander Spiller, hull superintendent at the Navy Yard; and commissioned on 31 July 1944.

== World War II ==

Following underway trials, training, and shakedown in the Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and New London, Connecticut, areas, &quot;Sea Poacher&quot; transited the Panama Canal and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 25 October 1944. Although her first two war patrols were unproductive, during the third, conducted in the Kuril Islands area, &quot;Sea Poacher&quot; torpedoed and sank a Japanese trawler and, four days later, sent two fishing boats to the bottom in a surface attack. During the latter action, three crewmen were injured when the 20 millimeter gun exploded. Due to the seriousness of their injuries, the patrol was terminated ahead of schedule, and the submarine returned to Midway.

After conducting her fourth war patrol off the eastern coast of Honshū and Hokkaidō, &quot;Sea Poacher&quot; was undergoing refitting at Pearl Harbor when the war ended on 15 August 1945.

== 1946 – 1974 ==

From 1946 to 1949, &quot;Sea Poacher&quot; was based at Balboa, Canal Zone, as a unit of Submarine Squadron 6 (SubRon 6) engaging in fleet exercises and antisubmarine training, and, on 1 June 1949, was transferred to Key West, Florida, as a unit of SubRon 4. In 1951, the submarine became the first GUPPY IA conversion performed at the Charleston Naval Shipyard.

For the remainder of her 25-year career, &quot;Sea Poacher&quot; operated for the most part in the Key West and Caribbean areas, providing services to various units of the Atlantic Fleet with time out for tours of duty with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean and various exercises with NATO forces. On 10 July 1952, while operating in the Key West area, the submarine had the unique experience of rescuing a blimp which had suffered an engine casualty and was floating helplessly in the water. The submarine promptly came to the aid of the stricken airship and proceeded to tow it the back to its base at Naval Air Station, Boca Chica, Florida.

In July 1959, &quot;Sea Poacher&quot; was transferred to SubRon 12, also based at Key West, and continued to serve as a unit of this squadron for the remainder of her active service. In the fall of 1962, &quot;Sea Poacher&quot; was deployed with other Atlantic Fleet units maintaining the quarantine imposed on Cuba during the missile crisis.

In 1969, &quot;Sea Poacher&quot; concluded her service with a -month deployment to the eastern and northern Atlantic areas to participate in antisubmarine training exercises with units of the Spanish and Portuguese navies. Upon returning to Key West, the submarine operated locally and in the Caribbean until 20 October when she set sail for Philadelphia and in-activation. &quot;Sea Poacher&quot; was reclassified an Auxiliary Submarine AGSS-406 on 1 November, decommissioned on 15 November 1969, and was assigned to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Philadelphia. On 30 June 1971, she reassumed the designation of a fleet submarine (SS). On 15 August 1973, her name was struck from the Navy List, and the submarine was sold to Peru in July 1974.

== BAP &quot;La Pedrera&quot; (S-49) ==
&quot;Sea Poacher&quot; was transferred (sold) under terms of the Security Assistance Program, to Peru, 1 July 1974. She was commissioned into the Peruvian Navy, initially as BAP &quot;Pabellón de Pica&quot; (S-49), but her name was changed a few weeks later to La Pedrera. She was taken out of service in 1995, and relegated to pierside training.

==Honors and awards==
As &quot;Sea Poacher&quot;, she received four battle stars for World War II service.

<doc id="1160087" wikidata="Q134261" url="?curid=1160087" title="Botia">
<text>Botia (Indian loaches) is a genus of freshwater fish in the loach family (Botiidae). It was a large genus with about 20 species. In 2004 Maurice Kottelat proposed in his paper (along with the description of &quot;Botia kubotai&quot;, see References below) to divide the genus into four related genera based on fish appearance and locality:

* &quot;Botia&quot; for Indian loaches (shorter body).
* &quot;Chromobotia&quot; for clown loach.
* &quot;Syncrossus&quot; for tiger loaches (elongated body).
* &quot;Yasuhikotakia&quot; for Mekong loaches (shorter body).

Another genus, &quot;Parabotia&quot;, was considered a separate genus earlier. It has an elongated body quite similar to &quot;Syncrossus&quot;, but with its range mostly restricted to China. With all these as separate genera, &quot;Botia&quot; species are restricted to South Asia (including Burma).

The fish in these genera possess a pair of razor-sharp spines under their eye sockets. These spines normally lie flat, but may be extended when the loach feels threatened. This behavior is rarely observed when the fish is swimming, but care must be taken when catching botia in fishnets — the projecting spines may become entangled, causing injury to the fish and/or damage to the net. Care must also be taken when transporting the larger botia, as their subocular spines may puncture the enclosing polyethylene bags that are normally used for this purpose.

One special characteristic of this loach group is the ability to produce a loud &quot;clicking&quot; noise, which is commonly heard during feeding time. This noise stems from a special type of pharyngeal teeth that are used to extract snails from their shells. For aquarists, this gives the botia a practical application, as they can be used to fight a snail infestation.

Another peculiarity of botia is that they are often seen resting on their side or in other strange positions. While this can be normal, healthy behaviour for botia, it is rarely observed in other types of fish. The unusual habit often causes needless panic for the inexperienced aquarist, who mistakenly assumes their fish is ill.

==Species==
There are currently nine recognized species in this genus:

<text>The Boeing NLA, or New Large Airplane, was a 1990s concept for an all-new quadjet airliner in the 500+ seat market. With a proposed size somewhat larger than the 747, it was a similar concept to the McDonnell Douglas MD-12 and later Airbus A380. In 1993, Boeing chose not to pursue development of this concept, focusing instead on the Boeing 747-500X and -600X, and then on the 747X and 747X Stretch, and subsequently on the Boeing 747-8. The project names for this proposal were NLA and Boeing 763-246C.

==History==
The Boeing New Large Airplane was one of several projects proposed by Boeing in the late 20th century as ways to compete with its rival Airbus. The Airbus A380 project began to be publicized in 1990 in order to try and turn the commercial aviation market away from the then very prevalent Boeing 747. Boeing sought to combat this and began working up designs for the NLA in the early 1990s, with a projected service entry date of before 2000 in order to beat the Airbus A380.
The goal of the NLA project was to create an airplane capable of traveling primarily long-haul routes and carrying vast amounts of passengers or cargo. At the time of design, ETOPS had not been introduced, and twinjet aircraft were not considered suitable for transpacific flights, so the NLA was designed with a four-jet layout (two on each wing), much like the 747 and the A380. It was designed to fly long-haul, high-demand flights such as Sydney to Dubai or London to New York, taking from 8 to 14 hours. With the goal of beating its competitors based on sheer passenger volume, the NLA design was to have included a full-length two deck configuration. This would have allowed for 600–1000 passengers (depending on airline and class seating configurations), about 50 more passengers than the A380 per configuration.

However, after only a few years of working on the project, Boeing decided that the NLA model was unsustainable with the way the commercial aviation market was trending. Instead of larger, higher capacity aircraft with the ability to make long hub-to-hub routes in a single go, Boeing decided the future was in smaller, more direct flights. As a result, they cancelled the NLA project.

<text>Vladimir Yefimovich Semichastny (; ; 15 January 1924 – 12 January 2001) was a Soviet politician, who served as Chairman of the KGB from November 1961 to May 1967. A protégé of Alexander Shelepin, he rose through the ranks of the Communist Youth League (Komsomol).

==Early life==
Semichastny was born in January 1924 in the village of Hryhorivka, near Grishino (today Pokrovsk), in the Yekaterinoslav Governorate (today Donetsk Oblast) of Soviet Ukraine, to a working-class Russian family originally from Tula Province. After finishing high school in 1941, he began studying Chemistry at the Institute of Chemical Technology in Kemerovo, but his studies were interrupted by World War II; his family back in Ukraine were evacuated to Astrakhan, due to the Nazi conquest of the region, and Semichastny himself was drafted to the Red Army. After the liberation of the Donbas by the Red Army in 1943, Semichastny returned home. Later, he received a degree in history from Kiev State University.

==In the Communist Youth League==
After the end of the war, Semichastny became a full-time employee of the Communist Youth League (Komsomol), working in the fields of propaganda and administration. From 1947 to 1950 he was First Secretary of the Ukrainian Komsomol. In 1950 he was brought to Moscow to work in the central apparatus of the Komsomol, where he met and befriended Alexander Shelepin, forging very close ties with him and eventually succeeding him as First Secretary of the All-Union Komsomol, on 28 March 1958. On 29 October 1958, speaking to an audience of thousands at a rally to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of Komsomol, he attacked Boris Pasternak, who had just been awarded the Nobel Prize for his novel, Doctor Zhivago, which had been published abroad after being suppressed in the USSR. Comparing him with &quot;a pig that shits in its own sty&quot;, he called for Pasternak to be deported. It was this threat that made Pasternak decide to renounce the prize.

==In Azerbaijan==
In 1959, Semichastny was sent by the Soviet leadership to the politically sensitive and oil-rich Soviet Socialist Republic of Azerbaijan, as Second Secretary of the ruling Communist Party of Azerbaijan, a position he held for two years, until 1961, serving under the Republic&#x27;s leader Vali Akhundov.

==Chairman of the KGB==

Semichastny was appointed chairman of the KGB by Nikita Khrushchev in November 1961, again succeeding his friend and mentor Shelepin, who had been KGB Chairman since 1958. Appointed at the age of 37, he was the youngest Soviet security and intelligence chief of the Cold War. As KGB chief, he generally continued his predecessor&#x27;s policies: support for national liberation movements worldwide, suppression of nationalism, separatism and the dissident movement within the Soviet Union, and recruitment of young university graduates to the KGB. He also put much emphasis on developing the security and intelligence services of the Soviet satellite states, and on assisting the communist forces in the Vietnam War.

Semichastny was surprised when Khrushchev informed him of his appointment as KGB Chairman, commenting that he did not have any experience in intelligence and counterintelligence; Khrushchev, however, told him that the KGB needed, above all, a deft political hand. Semichastny&#x27;s young age and his lack of professional experience in intelligence and counterintelligence led him to rely heavily on senior department heads within the KGB; he was always respectful towards intelligence veterans, but he was also determined to be in charge and leave his mark on the agency.

Semichastny&#x27;s first decision as KGB Chairman, on November 22, 1961, (after nine days in office) was to approve the creation of a &quot;sabotage and terrorism&quot; group (as the KGB itself called it) within the Sandinista National Liberation Front in Nicaragua; the Sandinistas would eventually manage to seize power in that country in 1979.

Despite Khrushchev&#x27;s fondness and esteem, Semichastny never became part of the Soviet leader&#x27;s inner circle. The two rarely had one-on-one meetings (although there were some instances where they would have breakfast together, or a walk in the Kremlin where Semichastny would brief him on important matters) and Khrushchev was adamant in his belief that the KGB was to be confined to intelligence, counterintelligence and state security, and was not expected to have any policy recommendations of its own (&quot;executor, not formulator of policy&quot;), especially in foreign affairs, where Semichastny usually deferred to Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko.

Undoubtedly, however, the KGB and its chairman retained their relevance and importance; every morning, a large grayish blue file containing intelligence reports and analyses, selected and reviewed by Semichastny, was placed on Khrushchev&#x27;s personal desk by one of his secretaries, and Khrushchev always read them avidly.

During the Cuban Missile Crisis, Semichastny was responsible for coordinating all information received from abroad. His chosen crisis team oversaw intelligence from the Foreign Ministry, the GRU (Military Intelligence) and, of course, the KGB. The team met every day in his office at KGB Headquarters in Lubyanka Square.

During his tenure Semichasnty attempted to create a new, more positive public image for the KGB, permitting an article to appear in the newspaper &quot;Izvestia&quot; that included an interview with an unnamed &quot;senior KGB officer&quot; (himself); he stated

many young Communist Party and Communist Youth League workers have joined the KGB, and none of the people who, during the time of Joseph Stalin&#x27;s cult of personality, took part in the repressions against innocent Soviet people, is now in the Service.

More articles, books and films on the security organs appeared, and Soviet spies became heroes in print and cinema — Rudolf Abel, Gordon Lonsdale, Harold (Kim) Philby, and Richard Sorge.

In October 1963, Semichastny sanctioned the arrest of Professor Frederick Barghoorn of Yale University when he was visiting Moscow. Semichastny hoped that by charging Barghoorn as a spy he could induce the United States to release Igor Ivanov, arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) that month for espionage. Barghoorn was a personal friend of President John F. Kennedy, who forcefully stated that Barghoorn was not involved in any illegal activities at a press conference. The Soviets subsequently released Barghoorn. Ivanov was eventually allowed to leave the United States in 1971.

Subsequently, Semichastny and his mentor Shelepin participated in the successful coup against Khrushchev in October 1964, an act that undoubtedly led to his being initially retained as KGB chief by the new, more hard-line Soviet leadership. There are some indications that Leonid Brezhnev, who led the coup against Khrushchev, wanted to assassinate him, but Semichastny, while participating in the ouster of Khrushchev, categorically refused to allow any bloodshed.

Semichastny was in fact the one who informed Khrushchev of his removal from power, &quot;by order of the Politburo&quot;; as Khrushchev was returning to Moscow from a holiday at the Black Sea, Semichastny waited for him at the airport flanked by KGB security guards, informed him of his ouster and told him not to resist. Khrushchev did not resist, and the hardliners&#x27; coup went off smoothly; Khrushchev felt betrayed by Semichastny, as he considered him a friend and ally until that very moment, not suspecting that he had joined his enemies within the Party.

In March 1967, Stalin&#x27;s daughter, Svetlana Alliluyeva, defected to the USA; Semichastny ordered the KGB to kidnap her and bring her back. The attempt failed, and led to the exposure of several KGB agents, who were arrested. This gave Shelepin&#x27;s enemies a pretext to sack Semichastny. Shelepin was able to protect him for a few weeks. but in May, he was hospitalised for eight days after an operation, and in his absence, on 18 May 1967, the Politburo held a ten-minute discussion in which they decided to appoint Yuri Andropov, who was ten years older than Semichastny, as his replacement. Shelepin was removed from positions of influence soon afterwards.

==Later career==
From 1967 until 1981 Semichastny was a Deputy Prime Minister of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, although he did not have any significant influence in the political affairs of the Republic, which was tightly controlled by Brezhnevists. In 1981 he was removed from that position as well, and retired to private life.

Semichastny died in Moscow at the age of 76, on January 12, 2001, after suffering a stroke.

==Kennedy assassination==
After U.S. President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, Semichastny investigated the background of Lee Harvey Oswald, who was arrested for the murder and was himself shot dead. Oswald had spent some time in the Soviet Union but, according to Semichastny&#x27;s investigations, had never worked for any Soviet intelligence agency; Semichastny&#x27;s verdict, that there was definitely &quot;something fishy&quot; in the whole affair, is shared by many.

==Assessment==
Markus Wolf, the intelligence chief of East Germany, who worked closely with Semichastny, described him as follows:

<doc id="1160100" wikidata="Q953531" url="?curid=1160100" title="Praeneste fibula">
<text>The Praeneste fibula (the &quot;brooch of Palestrina&quot;) is a golden &quot;fibula&quot; or brooch, today housed in the Pigorini National Museum of Prehistory and Ethnography in Rome. The fibula bears an inscription in Old Latin, claiming craftsmanship by one Manios and ownership by one Numazios. At the time of its discovery in the late nineteenth century, it was accepted as the earliest known specimen of the Latin language. The authenticity of the inscription has since been disputed, repeatedly rejected and affirmed, with one assertion of antiquity dating to the first half of the seventh century BC.

==Discovery==
The fibula was presented to the public in 1887 by Wolfgang Helbig, an archaeologist. According to some sources, Helbig did not explain how he had come to acquire the artifact at the time, although others state that the fibula &quot;was first made known to the public in three short articles in the for 1887 where it is said to have been purchased in Palestrina by a friend of Helbig in the year 1871, or five years before the discovery of the tomb&quot; – the tomb in question being the Bernardini Tomb whose treasure the fibula was later claimed to be a part of.

==Date and inscription==

The fibula was thought to originate from the seventh century BC. It is inscribed with a text that appears to be written in Old Latin or even Proto-Latino-Faliscan, here transcribed to Roman letters:

The reconstructed Proto-Italic ancestor would have been:

In Classical Latin the inscription reads:

&quot;Manius made me for Numerius.&quot;

== Authenticity==
In 1980 Margherita Guarducci, a leading epigraphist, published a book arguing that the inscription had been forged by Francesco Martinetti, an art dealer, and Helbig, who were known to have collaborated in shady dealings. Guarducci argued that the fibula&#x27;s presentation in 1887 was a hoax perpetrated to advance the careers of both men. This was the most formal but not the first accusation of its kind: Georg Karo had said that Helbig told him that the fibula had been stolen from Palestrina&#x27;s Tomba Bernardini.

Thomas Hoving tells the story in a way that necessitates the item&#x27;s falseness. His personal detective work involved becoming convinced it had been written in mirror image rather than an originally reversed hand. Putting it to a mirror, he saw &quot;a near-English word, &quot;fhaked,&quot;&quot; but thought anyone who&#x27;d seen &quot;faked&quot; in it--a forger&#x27;s admission--put it out of their minds that anyone &quot;could be so bold.&quot; In addition to the boldness, there was evidence in court by expert testimony.

Evidence in favor of the genuineness of the text came from a new Etruscan inscription of the Orientalizing period published by Massimo Poetto and Giulio Facchetti in 1999. The inscription scratched on the body of an Etrusco-Corinthian aryballos shows a gentilicium, Numasiana, which provides confirmation of the genuineness of the name Numasioi on the Fibula Prenestina, often regarded as suspicious by the supporters of the theory that it was a forgery.

In 2005, based on epigraphic and other arguments, linguist Markus Hartmann concluded that it is justified to assume the authenticity of the inscription as long as there is no compelling evidence for a forgery, and dated it with confidence to the seventh century BC.

In 2011, new scientific evidence was presented by the research team of Edilberto Formigli and Daniela Ferro, whose optical, physical and chemical analyses allowed them to take into consideration smaller scrapes on the surface of the object than was possible in the 1980s. Observation by means of scanning electron microscope (SEM) and detailed physical and chemical analyses on the surface of small areas within the track of the incision showed the existence of micro-crystallization of the gold surface: a natural phenomenon that could have taken place only in the course of centuries after the fusion. The study reported that a 19th-century forger could not have realized such a forgery.

==Replicas==
Replicas of the fibula are held by the National Roman Museum&#x27;s Museum of Epigraphy at the Baths of Diocletian in Rome, and also by the Arthur M. Sackler Museum at Harvard in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

<doc id="1160104" wikidata="Q478324" url="?curid=1160104" title="Erotica (Madonna album)">
<text>Erotica is the fifth studio album by American singer Madonna, released on October 20, 1992, by Maverick and Sire Records. The album was released simultaneously with Madonna&#x27;s first book publication &quot;Sex&quot;, a coffee table book containing explicit photographs of the singer, and marked her first release under Maverick, her own multimedia entertainment company. For the album, the singer enlisted Shep Pettibone and André Betts, with whom she had collaborated on 1990&#x27;s &quot;Vogue&quot; and &quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot;.

In mid-1991, Pettibone sent Madonna a three-track demo; she listened to the songs and liked all of them. Afterwards, the two met in New York City to start working on more music. The singer would write the melodies and lyrics on top of the music Pettibone produced in the style of his previous remixes. &quot;Erotica&quot; has been noted as a concept album about sex and romance in times of HIV/AIDS, with songs that touch &quot;unpleasant&quot; themes such as S&amp;M and homophobia. Additionally, it marked a departure of the dance-oriented nature of Madonna&#x27;s previous works, incorporating elements of hip-hop, house, techno, and New Jack Swing.

Upon release, it received praise from critics, who regarded it as one of Madonna&#x27;s most adventurous albums. Some, however, felt the music was overshadowed by its sexual themes. Commercially, it was less successful than Madonna&#x27;s previous endeavors; it peaked at number 2 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, becoming her first studio album not to top the chart since her debut. Internationally, it reached the first spot in Australia, Finland, and France, and peaked within the top five of several other countries such as Canada, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. &quot;Erotica&quot; was later certified double-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, and has sold more than six million copies worldwide.

Six singles were released from the album, including the title track and &quot;Deeper and Deeper&quot;, both of which reached the top ten of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The album was supported by the Girlie Show, Madonna&#x27;s fourth concert tour, which visited cities in Europe, the Americas, Australia, and Asia in 1993. Somewhat overlooked at the time of its release in part due to the backlash surrounding the &quot;Sex&quot; book, &quot;Erotica&quot; has been retrospectively considered one of Madonna&#x27;s most important albums, as well as one of the most revolutionary of all time by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Many critics have since noted influence of &quot;Erotica&quot; in works by contemporary female artists such as Janet Jackson to Beyoncé.

== Background ==
On April 21, 1992, it was reported that Madonna had teamed up with Time Warner Inc. to form Maverick, a multi-media entertainment company. Maverick consisted of a record company, a film production company, and associated music publishing, television broadcasting, book publishing and merchandising divisions. The deal paid the singer an advance of $60 million, and gave her 20% royalties from the music proceedings, one of the highest rates in the industry, equaled at that time only by Michael Jackson&#x27;s royalty rate established a year earlier with Sony. Madonna described Maverick as &quot;the perfect marriage of art and commerce&quot;, further adding that she envisioned it as an &quot;artistic think tank&quot;, and likened it to a cross between the German arts institute Bauhaus, and Andy Warhol&#x27;s The Factory; &quot;it started as a desire to have more control. There&#x27;s a group of writers, photographers, directors and editors that I&#x27;ve met along the way in my career who I want to take with me everywhere I go. I want to incorporate them into my little factory of ideas&quot;, she explained. The first two projects from the venture were Madonna&#x27;s fifth studio album, and a coffee table book depicting her &quot;erotic fantasies&quot;, titled &quot;Sex&quot;.

Madonna described the album as &quot;soulful, with a jazzy undertone and lot of beatnik-style poetry in it&quot;. Titled &quot;Erotica&quot;, the record saw the singer reunited with producer Shep Pettibone, with whom she had previously collaborated on &quot;Vogue&quot;, and &quot;Rescue Me&quot; from &quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot; (1990). Alongside Pettibone, Madonna enlisted help from producer André Betts, who previously co-produced &quot;Justify My Love&quot; from &quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot;. She was interested to work with Pettibone and Betts due to their ability to remain plugged into the dance underground; &quot;they come from opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of their music style and approach to music, but they&#x27;re both connected to the street and they&#x27;re still young and hungry&quot;.

== Development ==
Following the release of &quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot;, by mid-1991, Pettibone began working on new music: &quot;I knew I could do something great after &#x27;Vogue&#x27; and &#x27;Rescue Me&#x27; so I just started putting tracks together with my assistant, Tony Shimkin&quot;, Pettibone recalled. He and Shimkin created a three-track demo and sent it to Madonna, who was in Chicago filming &quot;A League of Their Own&quot;; she listened to the songs and liked all of them. In October, after filming was complete, Madonna met Pettibone in New York City to start working on more demos. Anthony Shimkins recalled that the singer brought with her a &quot;book full of lyrics and melody ideas&quot;. Petibone created the music, and Madonna the lyrics. Shimkin would program a Macintosh computer to play percussion and synthesizer parts and transfer them to an eight-track recorder; then, Madonna would record her vocals. According to author Mark Bego, the first batch of songs they worked on were the title track, &quot;Deeper and Deeper&quot;, &quot;Bad Girl&quot;, &quot;Thief of Hearts&quot;, and &quot;Rain&quot;. Recording took place at New York&#x27;s Soundworks Studios, Master Mix Studios, and Clinton Recording Studios. The producer described their work schedule as &quot;sporadic&quot;, because Madonna split her time between other ventures: She was working with Steven Meisel on &quot;Sex&quot; and would sometimes leave for two weeks; occasionally, she would also meet with producer André Betts. At first, Madonna did not like the first group of songs she had recorded. According to Mark Landeros from &quot;Classic Pop&quot;, Pettibone&#x27;s &quot;glossy sheen and pristine production were the antithesis of what [she] envisioned&quot; for &quot;Erotica&quot;. She wanted it to have a &quot;raw edge&quot;, as if it were recorded in an alley in Harlem.

Problems also arose during sequencing; computer processes would take too long and delay recordings. Pettibone had to keep things moving as fast as possible as he did not want Madonna to lose interest in the music. Also at this point, the music was getting &quot;a little melancholy&quot; and Madonna&#x27;s lyrics and ideas &quot;a lot more serious and intense&quot;. It was Pettibone&#x27;s idea to write a song for Madona&#x27;s friend Martin Burgoyne who died of HIV/AIDS, and came up with the chords to &quot;In This Life&quot;; she wrote the lyrics in 15 minutes. Title track &quot;Erotica&quot; underwent &quot;numerous radical changes&quot; during the recording process, with four different versions being recorded; the singer would first sing it one way, and then decide to erase everything and start all over again. Shimkin affirmed that the original version was not &quot;as slinky and sexy and grimy and dirty&quot;, until the mixing process; at that stage, the song was still an &quot;experimentation&quot;, but when they realized it was going to be the lead single, a &quot;different, darker vibe&quot; was taken on. While recording &quot;Erotica&quot;, Madonna was also working on &quot;Sex&quot;; for the book, she incorporated a dominatrix alter-ego named Mistress Dita, heavily inspired by German actress Dita Parlo. After seeing the book, Pettibone suggested that the singer incorporate the dominatrix theme into the song&#x27;s lyrics: &quot;&#x27;You have all these great stories [in the book]&#x27;, I told her, &#x27;Why don&#x27;t you use them in the song?&#x27;&quot;. Madonna left the studio with a copy of &quot;Sex&quot; with her, came back and recorded her vocals to &quot;Erotica&quot; in a &quot;very dry&quot; way; Pettibone then realized the song &quot;would never be the same again&quot;. The chorus and bridge were changed entirely and the song&#x27;s &quot;psyche&quot; became &quot;sexier, more to the point&quot;.

For &quot;Deeper and Deeper&quot;, Madonna wanted to have a flamenco guitar in the middle, an idea Pettinbone disagreed with, but eventually gave in. He later decided to add castanets to &quot;really take it there&quot;. According to Shimkin, while they were recording the song, Pettibone began singing some lines of &quot;Vogue&quot;; Madonna, who heard this and emulated it, liked the sound and decided to keep it. She later explained: &quot;When we were actually recording, doing the final vocals, I just went off into that for a second because [&#x27;Vogue&#x27;] to me it&#x27;s just one of those great kind of feel good dance songs.&quot; &quot;Where Life Begins&quot; was the first song for the album Madonna composed with André Betts, who was pleased with the song&#x27;s explicit subject. The singer and Betts also worked together on &quot;Waiting&quot;, which samples her vocals from &quot;Justify My Love&quot;, and thus was &quot;an easy sell [to Madonna]&quot;. During a break from recording, Shimkin and Pettibone went on vacation to the Cayman Islands and Jamaica, respectively. Having heard a lot of reggae on their trips inspired them to come up with the music to &quot;Why&#x27;s It So Hard&quot;. &quot;Did You Do It?&quot; began as a joke; while Madonna was out, Betts began freestyling over the instrumental of &quot;Waiting&quot; after being asked if he&#x27;d ever been intimate with Madonna. The singer liked the result and decided to keep the track on the album.

&quot;Fever&quot;″s inclusion was a &quot;happy accident&quot;. Madonna and Pettibone were working on &quot;Goodbye to Innocence&quot;, a house song that talks about &quot;living at the center of a controversial media storm&quot;, but, according to the singer, &quot;[it] just wasn&#x27;t working [...] the vibe wasn&#x27;t right&quot;. When they decided to try and record the song one final time, Madonna started singing bits of Little Willie John&#x27;s &quot;Fever; she had previously attended a Peggy Lee concert, and her rendition of the song had &quot;made a strong impression on [me]&quot;. Pettibone liked how it sounded, and they decided to record a cover. The problem, however, was that neither knew the full lyrics. Madonna called Seymour Stein from Sire Records and, &quot;within an hour, we had the lyric sheets, the Peggy Lee version, and the original version of the song in our hands&quot;. &quot;Fever&quot; was the last song to be recorded for &quot;Erotica&quot;.

== Composition ==
=== Sounds and themes ===
Author J. Randy Taraborrelli described &quot;Erotica&quot; as a &quot;melting pot of nineties urban music ― burgeoning hip-hop and house, partnered with a more conventional synthesizer-based rhythm and blues&quot;. It is a dance album that incorporates elements from classic disco, modern house, techno, and New Jack Swing. Additionally, it marked a departure from the &quot;four-on-the-floor disco romp that listeners came to expect from [Madonna]&quot;, focusing instead on &quot;heavy, cold [...] difficult and unpleasant&quot; themes such as homophobia, queerness, female sex and sexuality, &quot;not only in the hottest moments of physical relationships, but in their darker, more intimate instances, particularly in relation to the growing AIDS crisis&quot;, as noted by the &quot;Portland Mercury&quot;″s Jeni Wren Strottup. It has been referred to as a concept album about looking for romance in a post-AIDS era.

=== Music and lyrics ===

Opening track &quot;Erotica&quot; is a pop hip-hop dance song with &quot;scratchy, trip-hop loops&quot; and Middle Eastern influences. Described described by Pettibone as an &quot;ode to S&amp;M&quot;, the song continued Madonna&#x27;s exploration of potent spoken-word vocals, which she had previously introduced in &quot;Justify My Love&quot;, and samples Kool and the Gang&#x27;s &quot;Jungle Boogie&quot; (1973), and &quot;El Yom &#x27;Ulliqa &#x27;Ala Khashaba&quot; by Lebanese singer Fairuz. It begins with a &quot;put-a-record-on scratchiness&quot; sound that mimics a record player. Madonna invites her lover to be submissive while she makes love to him, and suggesting him to explore boundaries between pain and pleasure, demanding: &quot;Give it up, do what I say/ Give it up and let me have my way&quot;. Madonna&#x27;s cover of &quot;Fever&quot; follows &quot;Erotica&quot;; it is an &quot;apathetic house thumper&quot; with &quot;[her] airy deadpan [vocals] floating listlessly over the pulsing beats&quot;. It removes the chord movement from the original and has additional lyrics about Pocahontas, marimbas, and finger snaps at certain parts. Third track &quot;Bye Bye Baby&quot; is a techno pop song that samples LL Cool J&#x27;s &quot;Jingling Baby&quot; (1990), and opens with Madonna stating, &quot;This is not a love song&quot;. Her voice is filtered to sound like it’s being projected &quot;through an old-fashioned Victrola&quot;, while the lyrics talk about taking control rather than exacting revenge on a domineering, mind-game-playing partner. The track ends with an explosion and the singer saying &quot;you fucked it up&quot;, which is bleeped out.

Noted for being the album&#x27;s &quot;pure disco&quot; moment, &quot;Deeper and Deeper&quot; has a &quot;thicker arrangement&quot; than the rest of the songs. Opening phrase &quot;When you know the notes to sing, you can sing most anything&quot; references &quot;Do-Re-Mi&quot; from &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; (1959). Its lyrics talk about sexual desire, but Dan Cadan argued in his text in the liner notes of Madonna&#x27;s 2001 compilation &quot;GHV2&quot;, that they are actually about a young man coming to terms with his homosexuality. Also present are &quot;a juxtaposition of swirling disco synths&quot;, a flamenco guitar, and castanets on its bridge. Towards the end, it includes a line from &quot;Vogue&quot;: &quot;Let your body move to the music&quot;. Set to a &quot;jazzy, juicy&quot; groove, with lyrics about the &quot;finger-licking good&quot; pleasures of cunnilingus, &quot;Where Life Begins&quot; includes long sustained strings, and wah-wah guitars in its instrumentation. Madonna sings that it&#x27;s &quot;something every girl should experience&quot;. Considered &quot;Erotica&quot;″s &quot;most overtly sexual track&quot;, it&#x27;s the only one to reference safe sex: &quot;I’m glad you brought your raincoat/I think it’s beginning to rain&quot;. The lyrics to sixth track &quot;Bad Girl&quot; talk, in the singer&#x27;s own words, about a woman in a toxic relationship, trying to &quot;distract herself from reality&quot; through behaviors such as drinking and chain smoking. This is reflected in the refrain: &quot;Bad girl, drunk by six/Kissing someone else&#x27;s lips/Smoked too many cigarettes today/I’m not happy when I act this way&quot;. Instrumentation is provided by swing piano and wind chimes, with Madonna singing some parts in a falsetto. &quot;Waiting&quot; begins with the sound of a scratchy old vinyl before a sliding bass note. It is a &quot;brooding ballad noir&quot; with spoken words, in which a scorned and defiant Madonna faces up to the lover who&#x27;s broken her heart, and samples her own &quot;Justify My Love&quot;; lyrics include &quot;Don’t go breaking my heart like you said you would&quot;, and &quot;I wish I could believe you or at least have the courage to leave you&quot;. It ends with the singer uttering the phrase &quot;The next time you want pussy, just look in the mirror, baby&quot;.
&quot;Thief of Hearts&quot; is a &quot;dark, rumbling&quot; and &quot;smug&quot; track that echoes the Angels″ &quot;My Boyfriend&#x27;s Back&quot; (1963), and Blondie&#x27;s &quot;Rip Her to Shreds&quot; (1977). It opens with the sound of smashing glass, and sees Madonna using &quot;tough hip-hop language&quot; such as &quot;Bitch!/Which leg do you want me to break?&quot; to attack and ward off a &quot;cuckolding&quot; rival, referred to only as &quot;Little Susie Ho-Maker&quot;. Ninth track &quot;Words&quot; begins with an &quot;atmospheric&quot; G♯ chord, which is followed by the sound of drum machine. Its &quot;sharp&quot; lyrics find the singer lashing back at a lover who &quot;won her with romantic letters, then used the same verbal skills to manipulate and humiliate her&quot;; also present in the song are &quot;typewriter-esque effects&quot;, and Pettibone&#x27;s &quot;clattering programs and icy synth block-chords&quot;. The next song is &quot;Rain&quot;, which has been described as an &quot;optimistic&quot; New Age ballad, comparable to the work of Peter Gabriel. It features two spoken parts, &quot;thunder-claps of percussion&quot;, a crescendo towards the end, and lyrics that compare rain to the idea of being in love.

In the reggae-infused &quot;Why&#x27;s It So Hard&quot;, &quot;Erotica&quot;″s &quot;vulnerable plea for solidarity&quot;, Madonna specifically asks: &quot;Why&#x27;s it so hard to love one another?/What am I gonna do with all this anger/ Why do I have to fight?&quot; It has a &quot;heavy&quot; bass line, a piano break, and a coda, where the artist sings the phrase &quot;before it&#x27;s too late&quot;. Twelfth track &quot;In This Life&quot; is a slow song with orchestral arrangements, that samples George Gershwin&#x27;s blues lullaby &quot;Prelude No. 2&quot; (1926). Madonna talks about the gay friends she has lost to AIDS, including Martin Burgoyne, her dance teacher and mentor Christopher Flynn, and artist Keith Haring. Lines sung include, &quot;Have you ever watched your best friend die? [...] Someday I pray it will end/I hope it&#x27;s in this life/I hope it&#x27;s in this lifetime&quot;. At one point, Madonna &quot;bitterly&quot; wonders, &quot;Who determines, who knows best?/Is there a lesson I&#x27;m supposed to learn?&quot; The song&#x27;s drums have been likened to a doomsday Clock, and its refrain recalls that of the Beatles″ 1965 song &quot;In My Life&quot;. Penultimate track &quot;Did You Do It?&quot; is a &quot;raunchy&quot; rap song, in which guest rappers Mark Goodman and Dave Murphy tell their &quot;disbelieving friends&quot; about their sexual conquest of Madonna, who sings and repeats the phrase &quot;waiting for you&quot;. Closer &quot;Secret Garden&quot; features instrumentation from &quot;shuffling drums, rolling bass and jazzy piano&quot;. A &quot;hymn to the singer’s vagina&quot;, its lyrics conjure up imagery of flowers, roses, thorns, lovers, and rainbows.

== Artwork and release ==

The artwork for &quot;Erotica&quot; was created by Steven Meisel, under the artistic direction of Baron &amp; Baron Inc. —consisting of Fabien Baron and photographer Siung Fat Tjia— who also oversaw the packaging and design of &quot;Sex&quot;. The cover follows the &quot;same monochromatic blue-ink cover shot&quot; that had been used on the book, and shows Madonna&#x27;s &quot;faded&quot; face on a pale background. Photographs used for &quot;Sex&quot; were also included on the album&#x27;s booklet; one shows Madonna in S&amp;M garb, wielding a riding crop and licking her arm; another one features her bound and gagged. The backcover has the singer engaging in &quot;foot worship - blissfully sucking on someone&#x27;s big toe&quot;, as noted by J. Randy Taraborrelli. According to the author, &quot;one didn&#x27;t really need to hear the music to understand Madonna&#x27;s intention with &quot;Erotica&quot;. If the title itself wasn&#x27;t a tip-off, the CD&#x27;s cover artwork certainly made the point clear&quot;. Mark Bego, in his book &quot;Madonna: Blonde Ambition&quot;, wasn&#x27;t fond of the &quot;off-putting&quot; picture, and felt it was &quot;a bit too much, even for her fans&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Melinda Newman saw similarities between &quot;Erotica&quot;″s artwork and that of the Darling Buds&#x27; album of the same name, which was released two weeks before Madonna&#x27;s. From This is Dig! Mark Elliott said it&#x27;s one of Madonna&#x27;s &quot;most provocative&quot; album covers.

&quot;Erotica&quot; was released on October 20, 1992, through Madonna&#x27;s Maverick label. It was the singer&#x27;s first release to bear the Parental Advisory label due to explicit content in tracks such as &quot;Did You Do It?&quot;, and thus was banned in several Asian countries, such as China and Singapore. Two versions of &quot;Erotica&quot; were released: a clean 13-track version that omits &quot;Did You Do It?&quot;, and the complete 14-track version that bears the Parental Advisory label.

==Promotion ==
On October 22, 1992, MTV aired a special called &quot;The Day in Madonna&quot;, hosted by Kurt Loder, which profiled the release of both &quot;Sex&quot; and &quot;Erotica&quot;. New York City&#x27;s HMV music store held a Madonna look-alike contest, and set up a booth where people could view &quot;Sex&quot; for one dollar a minute. All the proceeds went to Lifebeat, the music industry organization founded to help fund AIDS research.

=== Media appearances and tour ===
On January 16, 1993, Madonna appeared on late-night live television show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and sang &quot;Bad Girl&quot; and &quot;Fever&quot;. The singer also appeared on the 1000th episode of &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot;, and sang &quot;Fever&quot; in its original version. She also performed &quot;The Lady Is a Tramp&quot; (1937) alongside Anthony Kiedis; they wore matching skirts, stockings, leather vests, cat-ear caps and lipstick. On September 2, 1993, Madonna opened the MTV Video Music Awards with a Burlesque-themed performance of &quot;Bye Bye Baby&quot;. The &quot;risqué&quot; number saw the singer in a tailcoat and top hat, with three scantily clad women, and included &quot;stroked inner-thighs, spanks, [and] frottage&quot;.

&quot;Erotica&quot; was further promoted on the Girlie Show, Madonna&#x27;s fourth concert tour. Seen as an attempt to &quot;revive&quot; her musical career after the critical and commercial failure of &quot;Body of Evidence&quot;, an erotic thriller which she starred, it began in London on September 25, 1993, and ended in Tokyo on December 19. It was initially planned not to visit the United States, instead focusing on regions the singer had never toured before, such as Turkey, Israel, Mexico, Puerto Rico, South America and Australia. However, due to demand, some shows were booked in certain US cities. Madonna opened the show dressed as a dominatrix surrounded by topless dancers, while lighter moments included her descending from the ceiling on a giant disco ball wearing an Afro wig for &quot;Express Yourself&quot; (1989), as well as singing &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; (1984) in the guise of actress Marlene Dietrich. The tour received generally positive reviews from critics, and was commercially successful, with a gross of $70 million from 39 concerts. Several organizations in different countries protested to force the cancellation of the concerts, due to their explicit sexual nature. In Puerto Rico, Madonna passed the island&#x27;s flag between her legs on stage, resulting in outrage among Puerto Rican society; Orthodox Jews staged protests to force the cancellation of the concerts in Tel Aviv to no avail.

=== Singles ===
In Australia and most European countries, title track &quot;Erotica&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s lead single on September 29, 1992; 
in the United States, it was released on October 13. It was met with generally positive reviews from critics, with some deeming it one of Madonna&#x27;s darkest and most experimental songs. It performed well commercially, debuting at number 13 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100―becoming one of the highest debuts on the chart history at the time―and peaking at number three. It also saw success on the Hot Dance Club Play chart, where it reached the top position. Its accompanying music video was directed by Fabien Baron, and features scenes of Madonna dressed as a masked dominatrix interspersed with footage of the making of &quot;Sex&quot;; it was highly controversial, being aired by MTV only three times, all after the 10pm watershed, before being completely banned.

&quot;Deeper and Deeper&quot; was issued in Australia and Europe as second single on November 17, whereas in the US, the release date was December 8. Critics lauded it for being more dance-oriented than &quot;Erotica&quot;, with some comparing it to the work of Donna Summer. It fared well commercially, reaching the seventh spot of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The music video was directed by Bobby Woods, and was seen as a homage to American artist Andy Warhol and Italian director Luchino Visconti; Madonna plays a character based on Edie Sedgwick, who goes out to a nightclub to meet her friends and boyfriend.

&quot;Erotica&quot;″s third single was &quot;Bad Girl&quot;; like its predecessors, it was first published in Australia and Europe on February 2, 1993. In the United States, it was released one month later with &quot;Fever&quot; as B-side. Critics reacted positively towards the track, with some noting a departure from Madonna&#x27;s highly sexual image of the time. The song had a lukewarm reception on the charts: it became Madonna&#x27;s first single to not reach the top 30 or top 20 of the Hot 100, breaking a streak of 27 consecutive top 20 singles that began with &quot;Holiday&quot; (1983) and ended with &quot;Deeper and Deeper&quot;. &quot;Bad Girl&quot;&#x27;s music video was directed by David Fincher; in it, Madonna plays Louise Oriole, a successful but promiscuous Manhattan businesswoman who engages in one-night stands with multiple men, until one of them murders her. The clip was acclaimed by critics, who deemed it one of Madonna&#x27;s best.

&quot;Fever&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s fourth single outside North America on March 28, 1993. Despite not being published as an official single in the US, &quot;Fever&quot; reached the top spot of &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot Dance Club Play chart. In the United Kingdom, it reached the chart&#x27;s sixth position. The song received generally positive to mixed reviews from critics; Madonna&#x27;s vocal performance was compared both positively and negatively to that of Lee&#x27;s. The music video was directed by Stéphane Sednaoui, and was Madonna&#x27;s first to use chroma key. In Australia and most European countries &quot;Rain&quot; was released as &quot;Erotica&quot;″s fifth single on July 17, 1993. In the US, it was the fourth and final single, released on August 5. Critics referred to &quot;Rain&quot; as one of the best songs in &quot;Erotica&quot;, and one of Madonna&#x27;s best ballads. In the visual, directed by Mark Romanek, Madonna is seen during a film shoot, with Japanese composer Ryuichi Sakamoto playing the director alongside a Japanese film crew. &quot;Rain&quot; peaked at number 14 on US Hot 100, and at 7 on the UK. The sixth and final single was &quot;Bye Bye Baby&quot;, released only in Australia on November 15, 1993, to coincide with Madonna&#x27;s visit to the country with the Girlie Show. It reached the chart&#x27;s 15th spot.

== Critical reception ==
&quot;Erotica&quot; was generally well received by critics upon release and in later decades. AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine said it was an &quot;ambitious&quot; album, that contains &quot;some of Madonna&#x27;s best and most accomplished music&quot;. From &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, James Hall opined &quot;Erotica&quot; is a &quot;venturous epic that was eclipsed by the audacity of the idea that spawned it&quot;, even if it&#x27;s not Madonna&#x27;s best album. Mark Elliott from website This is Dig! called &quot;Erotica&quot; a &quot;more noble&quot; concept album than &quot;I&#x27;m Breathless&quot; (1990). Matthew Rettenmund, author of &quot;Encyclopedia Madonnica&quot;, deemed it Madonna&#x27;s best, and J. Randy Taraborrelli her &quot;most promiscuous&quot;. To the staff of &quot;Billboard&quot;, &quot;La M&#x27;s first studio outing since 1989&#x27;s &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; [...] is her most varied and creatively challenging collection to date&quot;. Less positively, Charlotte Robinson from &quot;PopMatters&quot; referred to &quot;Erotica&quot; as the &quot;first disappointment of [Madonna&#x27;s] seemingly enchanted career&quot;.

One element focused on by critics such as J. D. Considine, from &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;, was the sexual and romantic themes. Some critics acclaimed the presentation of them as raw and harshly realistic elements that justified the singer&#x27;s unpolished and amateur vocals, and unexpectedly found the songs to be more about the pains of romance than sex. Other critics argued the sexual display was excessive, for some critics at the expense of musical depth. Mark Bego expressed a mixed view, deeming it &quot;artistic yet suggestive, some of it is genuinely sexy, and some of it is lewd and musically unappealing&quot;. Barbara Walker of the &quot;Sun-Sentinel&quot; complained that the overtly sexual tone made the album uninteresting due to its frequency in Madonna&#x27;s public image at the time. Additionally, she said it was &quot;loaded with just enough rootless shock value to rile her critics&quot;. Richard Harrington from the &quot;Washington Post&quot; likened the record to a number from Bob Fosse&#x27;s &quot;All That Jazz&quot; (1979), in which &quot;dancers-as-nearly-naked stewards and stewardesses say, as they explore all manner of sexual coupling before a small, shocked audience of potential investors, &#x27;Our motto is we take you everywhere but get you nowhere&#x27;&quot;. 

The music and sound was also a source of division. According to Daryl Easley, in his book &quot;Madonna: Blond Ambition&quot;, &quot;Erotica&quot; showcases the continuation of Madonna&#x27;s &quot;musical maturity&quot;. Conversely, reviewers such as Stephen Holden considered the lack of an upbeat, joyous vibe to be a downside for the dance style. Tom Ford, from the &quot;Toledo Blade&quot;, was the only critic to dismiss the musical styles as &quot;recycled&quot; from Madonna&#x27;s previous albums. Priya Elan from &quot;NME&quot; expressed that, &quot;ditching Patrick Leonard for Shep Pettiborn was a bold move that didn&#x27;t wholly pay off. The hard house beats of &quot;Erotica&quot; may have reflected the sexually explicit lyrically content brilliantly on tracks like &#x27;Deeper And Deeper&#x27; and &#x27;Thief Of Hearts&#x27;, but over a whole album it seemed a bit much&quot;. Both &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s David Browne and &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;″s Sal Cinquemani reacted negatively towards Madonna&#x27;s vocals: the former deemed them &quot;soulless&quot;, and the latter &quot;nasal and remote&quot;.

The instrumental parts of the songs was praised by some writers, however. &quot;The Quietus&quot;″ Matthew Barton called it a non-commercial but &quot;intoxicating cocktail of house, samples, jazz, [and] trip-hop&quot;, an elevated version of the &quot;&#x27;full-length piece of art&#x27; modus operandi&quot; of &quot;Like a Prayer&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Larry Flick described the tracklist as consisting of &quot;intelligent, pensive tunes and tough, dance/hip-hop jams&quot; that &quot;comes across like a conscious return&quot; to Madonna&#x27;s club origins. For &quot;The Buffalo News&quot;″ Anthony Violanti, it is a &quot;remarkable and engrossing album laced with tight, funky dance beats and some surprisingly moving songs&quot;.

== Legacy ==

&quot;Erotica&quot; has been referred to as one of Madonna&#x27;s best and most important albums. In 2017, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame considered it one of the most revolutionary albums of all time, writing that, &quot;few women artists, before or since &quot;Erotica&quot;, have been so outspoken about their fantasies and desires. [Madonna] made it clear that shame and sexuality are mutually exclusive [...] [&quot;Erotica&quot;] remains one of the boldest expressions of female sexuality&quot;. Kurt Loder added that, although she wasn&#x27;t the first female artist to &quot;exploit sexiness&quot;, with &quot;Erotica&quot; and &quot;Sex&quot;, Madonna &quot;set a template for what women could get away with&quot;. Influence of &quot;Erotica&quot; can be seen in the work of contemporary female artists such as Britney Spears, Beyoncé, Janet Jackson, Christina Aguilera, Lady Gaga, Nicki Minaj, Miley Cyrus, Ariana Grande, Lana Del Rey, Cardi B, and Kim Petras. With the album, Joe Lynch from &quot;Billboard&quot; held that Madonna &quot;set the blueprint for singers to get raw&quot;, while for Chuck Arnold it &quot;forever sexed-up pop music&quot;. &quot;USA Today&quot;″s Edward Segarra felt it &quot;helped expand female expression, usher in &#x27;confessional&#x27; style&quot;. Similarly, Reece Shrewsbury deemed it &quot;a huge step for women&#x27;s sexual liberation&quot;.

According to Taraborrelli, at the time of &quot;Erotica&quot;″s release, &quot;much of society seemed to reexamining its sexuality. Gay rights issues were at the forefront of social discussions globally, as was an ever-increasing awareness of AIDS&quot;. In this vein, Eric Henderson from &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; referred to it as a record that &quot;[r]evealed a full understanding of the bipolarity of the gay experience circa AIDS&quot;. &quot;Attitude&quot;″s Joseph Ryan-Hicks concluded that, &quot;although &quot;Erotica&quot; was provocative, at its core were messages of safe sex and liberation at a time when people needed to hear them the most&quot;. Through the album, Madonna was able to advocate for AIDS awareness and help bring the epidemic into the public discourse, according to &quot;Stereogum&quot;″s Mary Von Aue. From the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;, El Hunt wrote: &quot;Both &quot;Erotica&quot; and &quot;Sex&quot; came out at a time when certain kinds of sex –specifically queer sex– were steeped in debilitating amounts of shame and fear [...] By putting forward a vision of sexual exploration that often feels cold, detached, and uneasy, Madonna flawlessly captured the emotional disconnect of searching out an intimacy that has suddenly become deadly&quot;. Sal Cinquemani elaborated:

By 1992, Madonna was an icon —untouchable, literally and figuratively— and &quot;Erotica&quot; was the first time the artist&#x27;s music took on a decidedly combative, even threatening tone, and most people didn&#x27;t want to hear it. [&quot;Erotica&quot;″s] irrefutable unsexiness probably says more about the sex=death mentality of the early &#x27;90s than any other musical document of its time. This is not Madonna at her creative zenith. This is Madonna at her most important, at her most relevant. No one else in the mainstream at that time dared to talk about sex, love, and death with such frankness and fearlessness.

&quot;Erotica&quot; was named &quot;one of the biggest affronts to white, Christian, middle-class America ever to appear in pop music&quot; by the staff of &quot;Gay Times&quot;. Its biggest achievement, according to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Barry Walters, is &quot;the embrace of the Other, which in this case means queerness, blackness, third-wave feminism, exhibitionism and kink. Madonna took what was marginalized at the worst of the AIDS epidemic, placed it in an emancipated context, and shoved it into the mainstream for all to see and hear&quot;. Joe Lynch concluded: &quot;If her earlier work was an invitation to celebrate sexuality without shame, &quot;Erotica&quot; was a challenge [...] to witness and perhaps even indulge in society’s sexual taboos. Madonna may have addressed the male gaze before, but on &quot;Erotica&quot;, she wasn’t just staring back – she was making the world her sub&quot;. Brian McNair, the author of &quot;Striptease Culture: Sex, Media and the Democratization of Desire&quot;, stated that upon the album&#x27;s release, &quot;academic books began to appear about the &#x27;Madonna phenomenon&#x27;, while pro- and anti-porn feminists made of her a symbol of all that was good or bad (depending on their viewpoint) about contemporary sexual culture&quot;.

According to &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;, &quot;no Madonna album was ever met with a louder backlash or was more rampantly misrepresented&quot; than &quot;Erotica&quot;. Taraborrelli commented that it is unfortunate that the album has to be historically linked to other &quot;less memorable ventures&quot; in the singer&#x27;s career, such as &quot;Sex&quot; and &quot;Body of Evidence&quot;, as it has &quot;true value&quot;. When asked to name her biggest professional disappointment, Madonna answered: &quot;The fact that my &quot;Erotica&quot; album was overlooked because of the whole thing with the [&quot;Sex&quot;] book. It just got lost in all that. I think there&#x27;s some brilliant songs on it and people didn&#x27;t give it a chance&quot;. Writing for &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot;, Alfred Soto felt &quot;Erotica&quot; &quot;proved too sophisticated for a mainstream besotted with &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; and a college-radio claque eager to praise R.E.M.&#x27;s opaque dirges&quot;. This sentiment was echoed by Reece Shrewsbury, who added that the general public &quot;just wasn&#x27;t ready to see a pop star who once had a clean image in such provocative positions&quot;. Musician Doug Wimbish referred to &quot;Erotica&quot; as &quot;ahead of its time&quot;, and applauded Madonna for being &quot;enough of an artist to take the hues and shades of what&#x27;s happening and put a concept together [...] She had Maverick, she&#x27;d done the [&quot;Sex&quot;] book, the film &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;, she dated a big-ass Hollywood actor (Warren Beatty). [&quot;Erotica&quot;] was her first record with &quot;her&quot; concept. She turned the system upside down for a moment, and they had to deal with the shock and awe of it all&quot;. Brian McNair added that, by &quot;dabbling in the pornosphere&quot; with &quot;Sex&quot; and &quot;Erotica&quot;, Madonna took a financial risk with her career, and it wasn&#x27;t until the release of 1998&#x27;s &quot;Ray of Light&quot; that her record sales went back to &quot;pre-&quot;Erotica&quot;&quot; levels; nonetheless, the author concluded that, &quot;what she lost in royalty payments, [she] more than made up for in iconic status and cultural influence&quot;. From music portal Albumism, Justin Chadwick wrote: &quot;&quot;Erotica&quot; was, is, and will forever be a fearlessly fierce album that only Madonna could make. No one has ever come close to replicating it and no one ever will&quot;.

<text>Cleo Allen Noel Jr. (August 6, 1918 – March 2, 1973) was a United States ambassador to Sudan who was murdered by the Black September Palestinian organization organization in the 1973 attack on the Saudi embassy in Khartoum.

==Early life==
Born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, Noel spent his formative years in Moberly, Missouri. He attended Moberly Junior College and then University of Missouri, receiving a B.A. in History in 1939 and a M.A. in the same subject in 1940.

==Career==
Noel worked briefly as an educator, teaching American history at the University of Missouri before joining the United States Navy in June 1941. During World War II he served as a gunnery officer providing security aboard merchant vessels throughout the Pacific Ocean and Persian Gulf; in fall 1945 Noel discharged from the navy at the rank of lieutenant commander.

===U.S. Foreign Service career===

After the war, while studying for his PhD at Harvard, Noel passed the United States Foreign Service exam and was hired by the Department of State. In 1951 he married fellow Foreign Service worker Lucille McHenry. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s Noel served with U.S. consulates in Italy, Saudi Arabia, France, Lebanon and Sudan. Noel was particularly fascinated with the Middle East and regularly toured the region, learning the Arabic language.

===Ambassadorship to Sudan and death===
On December 23, 1972, Noel was appointed U.S. Ambassador to Sudan when Sudan and the U.S. reestablished diplomatic relations severed as the result of the 1967 Arab-Israeli War. The outgoing Charge d&#x27;Affairs, George Curtis Moore, was asked to stay on as Deputy Chief of Mission until the new Deputy arrived in March.

On the evening of March 1, 1973, militants from the Black September faction of PLO stormed the Saudi Embassy in Khartoum, where a farewell ceremony for Moore had just concluded. Noel was wounded during the taking, he and Moore were among the ten diplomats taken hostage by the militants. The next day, March 2, the hostage takers shot Noel to death. Also murdered were his deputy, Moore; and Belgian diplomat Guy Eid.

After a joint funeral on March 7 at the National Presbyterian Church in Washington D.C., Cleo Noel Jr. and Curtis Moore were buried with military honors at Arlington National Cemetery.

<text>Varāhamihira ( 20/21 March 505 – 587), also called Varāha or Mihira, was a Hindu astrologer-astronomer who lived in or around Ujjain in present-day Madhya Pradesh, India.

== Date ==

Unlike other prominent ancient Indian astronomers, Varāhamihira does not mention his date. However, based on hints in his works, modern scholars date him to the 6th century CE; possibly, he also lived during the last years of the 5th century.

In his &quot;Pancha-siddhantika&quot;, Varāhamihira refers to the year 427 of the &quot;Shaka-kala&quot; (also &quot;Shakendra-kala&quot; or &quot;Shaka-bhupa-kala&quot;). Identifying this calendar era with the Shaka era places Varāhamihira in the 505 CE. Alternative theories identify this calendar era with other eras, placing him before the 5th century CE. However, these theories are inaccurate, as Varāhamihira must have lived after Aryabhata (born 476 CE), whose work he refers to. The particulars of the date mentioned by Varāhamihira - Shukla &quot;pratipada&quot; of the Chaitra month of the Shaka year 427 - align accurately with 20-21 March 505 CE. Al-Biruni also places Varāhamihira in 505 CE.

In accordance with the contemporary tradition, 505 CE was most probably the year in which Varāhamihira composed &quot;Pancha-Siddhantaka&quot; or began planning it. However, some scholars believe that it was the year of Varāhamihira&#x27;s birth or of another important event in his life. This is because according to Amaraja, the author of a commentary on Brahmagupta&#x27;s &quot;Khanda-khadyaka&quot;, Varāhamihira died in 587 CE (Shaka year 509). If Varāhamihira wrote his work in 505 CE even at the young age of 25, he must have been over 105 years old at the time of his death, which seems exceptionally high to these scholars. Consequently, these scholars consider date Varāhamihira&#x27;s lifespan to 505-587 CE. Other scholars doubt the accuracy of Amaraja&#x27;s statement, since he lived a thousand years after Varāhamihira.

According to a historically inaccurate tradition, Varāhamihira was associated with the first century BCE legendary emperor Vikramaditya. This tradition is based on &quot;Jyotirvid-abharana&quot;, a work attributed to Kalidasa, which states that Varāhamihira (along with Kalidasa) was one of the navaratnas (&quot;nine gems&quot;) at Vikramaditya&#x27;s court. However, this text is a literary forgery, and is dated variously from 12th-18th century. Varāhamihira definitely did not live in the same century as some of the purported &quot;Navaratnas&quot;, such as the much older Kalidasa.

== Early life ==

Much of the undisputed information about the life of Varāhamihira comes from a stanza in his &quot;Brhaj-jataka&quot;. According to this stanza, he was a resident of Avanti, was a son of Aditya-dasa, and studied at Kapitthaka through the boon of the sun god.

=== Ancestry ===

Varāhamihira&#x27;s father Aditya-dasa likely trained him in jyotisha (Indian astrology and astronomy), as suggested by the &quot;Brhaj-jataka&quot; stanza and the opening stanza of &quot;Pancha-siddhantika&quot;.

Varāhamihira&#x27;s commentator Utpala calls him &quot;Magadha-dvija&quot;. According to one interpretation, this means that Varāhamihira was Brahmana (&quot;dvija&quot;), whose ancestors belonged to the Magadha region.

According to another theory, the word &quot;Magadha&quot; in this context refers to the sun-worshipping Maga cult that Varāhamihira was a part of. In his &quot;Brhat-samhita&quot;, Varāhamihira mentions that the Magas were the only people suitable for consecrating an image of the Sun god. The Magas, as they came to be known in India, originated from the Magi priests of the Achaemenid Empire. Historian Ajay Mitra Shastri cites a &quot;Bhavishya Purana&quot; passage according to which the term &quot;Magadha&quot; is a synonym of &quot;Maga&quot; and refers to &quot;those who contemplate on the Maga&quot;. According to Shastri, Utpala has used the word &quot;Magadha&quot; to denote the Magas, who had been accepted as Shaka-dvipi (Maga) Brahmins in the Indian society.

Shastri theorizes that &quot;Varaha-mihira&quot; may be a Sanskritized form of the Iranian name &quot;Varaza-Mihr&quot;, and may refer to a legend mentioned in the &quot;Mihr Yasht&quot; of the &quot;Avesta&quot;. According to this legend, the god Verethraghna, in the form of a boar (&quot;varaza&quot;), precedes Mihr in his march. Shastri notes that the 5th century Sassanian monarch Bahram V bore the name Mihrvaraza, which is quite similar to Varahamihra. Academic J.E. Sanjana suggests that Varāhamihira was descended from an Iranian Magi priest.

Some scholars, such as M.T. Patwardhan and A.N. Upadhye, have identified Varāhamihira with Bazurjmehr, mentioned in Firishta&#x27;s writings as a minister of the Sasanian king Khusraw Nushirwan (r. 531-578). However, A.M. Shastri dismisses this theory as unconvincing.

There are several historically inaccurate legends about the ancestry of Varāhamihira:

* Jain writers Merutunga (14th century) and Rajashekhara-Suri claim that his original name was Varaha, and he was a brother of the Jain patriarch Bhadrabahu. He gained knowledge because of a favour by the Sun, because of which the suffix &quot;Mihira&quot; (&quot;Sun&quot;) was added to his name. Jain authors seem to have fabricated this story to prove the pre-eminence of the Jain astrology over the Brahmanical astrology.

* Another 20th century legend, purportedly based on &quot;some old Gujarati text&quot; claims that Aditya-dasa&#x27;s wife was called Satya-vati alias Indu-mati: Varāhamihira was born to them in their fifties by the boon of the Sun. He was originally known as Mihira, and was given the prefix &quot;Varaha&quot; by King Vikramaditya when he correctly predicted that a boar (&quot;varaha&quot; in Sanskrit) would kill the king&#x27;s son.

* A tradition associates Varāhamihira with Berachampa in West Bengal, where a mound called &quot;Varāhamihira&#x27;s house&quot; is located. This seems to be the result of an attempt to associate the locality with a famous figure. A legend from the Bengal region claims that Varaha and Mihira were a father-son duo at Vikramaditya&#x27;s court, and the poet Khana was Mihira&#x27;s wife. This legend is of no historical value. &quot;Varaha&quot; and &quot;Mihira&quot; were alternative names for the same person - Varāhamihira, as attested by the later astronomical works.

* Another legend claims that the Mimamsa teacher Shabara-svamin had four wives, one from each varna, and Varāhamihira was his son from his Brahmin wife. Some scholars, such as S.K. Dikshit, have theorized that Aditya-dasa (or Aditya-deva) was another name of Shabara-svamin, but no historical evidence supports this tradition.

=== Birthplace ===

Kapitthaka, where Varāhamihira studied, was probably his birthplace. While &quot;Kapitthaka&quot; is the most popular reading the place&#x27;s name, several variants of this name appear in various manuscripts, including Kampilyaka, Kapilaka, Kapishthala, and Kapishkala. Utpala suggests that this village had a sun temple. According to one theory, Kapitthaka is the modern Kayatha, an archaeological site near Ujjain. Statues of the sun deity Surya (whom Varāhamihira worshipped) dated 600-900 CE have been found there, and &quot;kapittha&quot; trees are abundant in and around Kayatha. However, no historical source suggests that Kapitthaka was another name for Kayatha. According to another theory, Kapitthaka is same as Sankissa (ancient Sankashya) in present-day Uttar Pradesh: according to the 7th-century Chinese traveler Xuanzang, this town was also known as Kah-pi-t&#x27;a. Historian Ajay Mitra Shastri notes that Kah-pi-t&#x27;a is phonetically similar to Kapittha or Kapitthaka.

Based on the term &quot;Magadha-dvija&quot; (see above), Sudhakara Dvivedi suggests that Varāhamihira was born and brought up in Magadha, and later migrated to Ujjain. Ajay Mitra Shastri disputes this, noting that Utpala describes him as &quot;Avantikacharya&quot; (Acharya of Avanti) and &quot;Magadha-dvija&quot;: these two terms cannot be reconciled if &quot;Magadha-dvija&quot; is interpreted as &quot;Dvija (Brahmana) of Magadha&quot;; instead &quot;Magadha&quot; here means Maga, as attested by the &quot;Bhavishya Purana&quot;.

== Residence ==

Besides the above-mentioned stanza, Varāhamihira&#x27;s association with Avanti is confirmed by other evidence: in &quot;Pancha-siddhantika&quot;, he calls himself &quot;Avantyaka&quot; (&quot;of Avanti&quot;), and the later commentators such as Utpala and Mahidhara describe him as &quot;Avantikacharya&quot; (&quot;acharya of Avanti&quot;). Utpala also describes Varāhamihira&#x27;s son Prthu-yashas as Avantikacharya, in his commentary on &quot;Shat-panchashika&quot;.

Historian Ajay Mitra Shastri, relying on Utpala, believes that &quot;Avanti&quot; here refers to the city of Ujjayini in the Avanti region of central India. Scholar Dániel Balogh, however, notes that Avanti here may refer to the city of Ujjayini or the Avanti region in general: there is no concrete evidence that Varāhamihira lived in the city; he may have lived elsewhere in Avanti.

=== Royal patron ===

Varāhamihira likely lived in the Aulikara kingdom, as the Aulikaras ruled Avanti in the 6th century CE. Varāhamihira&#x27;s &quot;Brhat-samhita&quot; states that on the topic of omens (&quot;shakuna&quot;), one of the works he consulted was that of Dravya-vardhana, the king of Avanti. Dravya-vardhana likely belonged to the Aulikara dynasty, several of whose members bore names ending in &quot;-vardhana&quot;.

Historian Ajay Mitra Shastri notes that Dravya-vardhana is the only person for whom Varāhamihira employs the honorific &quot;Shri&quot;, although he mentions several other notable people. Moreover, he mentions Dravya-vardhana&#x27;s work before he mentions reputed authorities such as the Saptarishis and Garga. According to Shastri, this, combined with the fact that both Dravya-vardhana and Varāhamihira lived in Avanti, suggests that Dravya-vardhana was the royal patron of Varāhamihira. Shastri theorizes that Dravya-vardhana was a successor of Yashodharman alias Vishnu-vardhana, who may have also been a patron of Varāhamihira.

Some other historians identify Dravya-vardhana with the earlier Aulikara ruler Drapa-vardhana. Shastri disputes this, arguing that Varāhamihira describes Dravya-vardhana as a &quot;maharajadhiraja&quot; (emperor), while the Rīsthal inscription describes Drapa-vardhana as a &quot;senapati&quot; (commander). Balogh disagrees with Shastri, noting that Varāhamihira actually uses the term &quot;nrpo maharajadhiraja-kah&quot; (&quot;nrpa&quot; or ruler &quot;connected to the emperor&quot;) for the king, which Shastri has misunderstood as &quot;maharajadhirajah&quot; (emperor). Only one manuscript reads &quot;maharajadhirajah&quot;, which can be discarded as it doesn&#x27;t fit the metre; three others have &quot;maharajdhiraja-jah&quot;. Thus, the actual title of Drapa-vardhana was &quot;nrpa&quot;, which is much closer to &quot;senapati&quot; in status. Utpala also interprets the term &quot;maharajadhiraja-kah&quot; to mean &quot;born in the dynasty of the (or an) emperor&quot;. Hans Bakker interprets the term to &quot;maharajadhiraja-kah&quot; as a governor installed at Ujjayini by the contemporary Gupta emperor. Balogh believes that Dravya-vardhana was probably same as Drapa-vardhana: &quot;Dravya&quot; may be a variant arising from a mistake in a medieval manuscript, which is the source of later manuscripts.

Balogh disputes Shastri&#x27;s assertion that Varāhamihira shows a particularly reverential attitude to the king, and even if he did, this is no evidence that the two were contemporaries. Varāhamihira consulted the king&#x27;s work instead of the original work of Bharadvaja that it was based on; according to Balogh, this actually makes it more likely that the king lived at a time earlier than Varāhamihira, who did not have access to the older work of Bharadvaja.

According to Balogh, Varāhamihira likely lived during the reign of the Aulikara kings Prakasha-dharman, Yashodharman, or an unknown successor of Yashodharman. However, unlike Shastri, Balogh believes that Varāhamihira did not have a royal patron.

== Religion ==

Several scholars theorize that Varāhamihira came from a Brahminized family of the sun-worshipping Magi priests (see Ancestry above). He was a worshipper of the sun god Savitur, and stated that he had received all his knowledge by the grace of this god. For example, in &quot;Brhaj-jataka&quot;, he states that he was able to compose the text because of a boon by the Sun. While he mentions other deities, he devotes a much larger number of verses to the Sun. His commentator Utpala credits his sharp intellect to a boon by the Sun. Some later writers describe him as an incarnation of the Sun god. Utpala, for example, declares that the Sun descended on earth in the form of Varāhamihira to save the jyotisha-shastra from destruction. The &quot;Subhashita-ratna-kosha&quot; quotes stanzas that praise Varāhamihira as an incarnation of Vishnu and the Sun, presumably because of two parts of his name (&quot;varaha&quot; referring to an avatar of Vishnu, and &quot;mihira&quot; meaning sun).

Sun worship seems to have been his family&#x27;s religion, as his father Aditya-dasa&#x27;s name literally means &quot;slave (or servant) of the Sun&quot;. &quot;Kutuhula-manjari&quot;, a later text, suggests that Varāhamihira was born to Aditya-dasa by the blessings of the Sun. Varāhamihira&#x27;s son Prthu-yashas also invokes the Sun in the opening stanza of his work &quot;Shatpanchashikha&quot;.

Varāhamihira was well-versed with the Vedic tradition. He recommends the performance of several ancient Hindu rituals such as Punyaham and chanting of Vedic hymns.

Varāhamihira praises Vishnu in the chapters 42 and 104 of Brhat-samhita, leading A.N.S. Aiyangar and K.V.R Aiyangar to speculate that he came in contact with the Shrivaishnava saints (Alvars); however, A.M. Shastri dismisses this theory, describing the praise for Vishnu as an example of religious eclecticism.

In &quot;Brhat-samhita&quot;, Varāhamihira discusses the iconography of several Brahmanical deities, including Vishnu, Baladeva, Ekanamsha, Shamba, Pradyumna, consorts of Shamba and Pradyumna, Brahma, Skanda, Indra, Shiva, Surya, the divine mothers (Matrikas), Revanta, Yama, Varuna, and Kubera. These were presumably the popular gods worshipped during his period. He also describes the iconography of two non-Brahmanical faiths, that of the Buddha and the Jinas. He appears to have been religiously liberal, as he reveres the Buddha as &quot;the father of the world&quot; and devotes an entire stanza to Buddha&#x27;s iconology (compared to shorter descriptions of several Brahmanical deities). A verse in the &quot;Brhat-samhita&quot; describes the iconography of Ganesha, but this verse appears only in one or two manuscripts, and is likely a later interpolation. Similarly, a &quot;Tikanika-yatra&quot; verse in which the author reveres Ganesha (among other deities), is likely spurious; this verse appears only in one manuscript.

== Works ==

Varāhamihira is credited with writing several authoritative texts on astronomy and astrology. He was also known for his poetic skills, and the 11th-century writer Kshemendra describes him as a great poet.

He apparently wrote a set of two works - detailed and short - in the following areas:

The chronological order of some of these works can be determined based on the internal evidence and Utpala&#x27;s commentary. In order or earliest to latest, these works are:

* &quot;Pancha-siddhantika&quot;
* &quot;Brhaj-jataka&quot;
* &quot;Brhad-yatra&quot;
* &quot;Yoga-yatra&quot; (according to Utpala, Varaha-mihira wrote this because he was dissatisfied with &quot;Brhad-yatra&quot;)
* &quot;Brhad-vivaha-patala&quot;
* &quot;Brhat-samhita&quot;

&quot;Laghu-jataka&quot; states that it was written after &quot;Brhaj-jataka&quot;, and Utpala&#x27;s commentary states that it was written after the abridged version of &quot;Pancha-siddhantika&quot;. However, its order with respect to the other works is not certain.

Later authors also mention or quote from some other works composed by Varaha-mihira. Manuscripts of some other works attributed to Varaha-mihira exist, but these attributions are of doubtful nature.

== Influences ==

The &quot;Romaka Siddhanta&quot; (&quot;The Doctrine of the Romans&quot;) and the &quot;Paulisa Siddhanta&quot; were two works of Western origin which influenced Varāhamihira&#x27;s thought. The &quot;Pauliṣa Siddhānta&quot; is often mistakenly thought to be a single work and attributed to Paul of Alexandria (c. 378 CE). However, this notion has been rejected by other scholars in the field, notably by David Pingree who stated that &quot;...the identification of Paulus Alexandrinus with the author of the &quot;Pauliṣa Siddhānta&quot; is totally false&quot;. A number of his writings share similarities with the earlier texts like &quot;Vedanga Jyotisha&quot;.

Some scholars consider Varāhamihira to be the strong candidate for the one who understood and introduced the zodiac signs, predictive calculations for auspicious ceremonies and astrological computations in India.

Varāhamihira&#x27;s works contain 35 Sanskritized Greek astronomical terms, and he exhibits a good understanding of the Greek astronomy. He praised the Greeks (&quot;Yavanas&quot;) for being &quot;well trained in the sciences&quot;, though impure in ritual order.

== Legacy ==

Varāhamihira gained reputation as the most eminent writer on jyotisha after his death, and his works superseded nearly all the earlier Indian texts in this area. Several later Indian astrologer-astronomers speak highly of him, and acknowledge his works among their main sources. The 11th-century writer Al-Biruni also greatly admires him, describing him as an excellent astronomer.

<text>The Lochnagar mine south of the village of La Boisselle in the Somme was an underground explosive charge, secretly planted by the British during the First World War, to be ready for 1 July 1916, the first day on the Somme. The mine was dug by the Tunnelling Companies of the Royal Engineers under a German field fortification known as (Swabian Height). A large crater survived the war known as the Lochnagar crater or the .

The British named the mine after Lochnagar Street, the trench from which the gallery was driven. The charge at Lochnagar was one of 19 mines that were dug under the German lines on the British section of the Somme front, to assist the infantry advance at the start of the battle.

The mine was sprung at on 1 July 1916 and left a crater deep and wide, which was captured and held by British troops. The attack on either flank was defeated by German small arms and artillery fire, except on the extreme right flank and just south of La Boisselle, north of the Lochnagar Crater. The crater has been preserved as a memorial and a religious service is held each 1 July.
==Background==

===1914===
French and German military operations began on the Somme in September 1914. A German advance westwards towards Albert was stopped by the French at La Boisselle and attempts to resume offensive warfare in October failed. Both sides reduced their attacks to local operations or raids and began to fortify their remaining positions with underground works. On 18 December, the French captured the La Boisselle village cemetery at the west end of a German salient and established an advanced post only from the German front line. By 24 December, the French had forced the Germans back from the cemetery and the western area of La Boisselle but their advance was stopped a short distance forward at , in front of German trenches protected by barbed wire. Once the location of a farm and a small number of buildings, became known as (German, shell farm) to the Germans and later as the Glory Hole to the British. On Christmas Day 1914, French engineers sank the first mine shaft at La Boisselle.

===1915===
Fighting continued in no man&#x27;s land at the west end of La Boisselle, where the opposing lines were apart, even during lulls along the rest of the Somme front. On the night of , a German sapper inadvertently broke into a French mine gallery, which he found to have been charged with explosives; a group of volunteers took 45 nerve-racking minutes to dismantle the charge and cut the firing cables. The French mine workings were taken over when the British moved into the Somme front. George Fowke moved the 174th and 183rd Tunnelling Companies into the area; at first the British did not have enough miners to take over the many French shafts; the problem was temporarily solved when the French agreed to leave their engineers at work for several weeks.

On 24 July, 174th Tunnelling Company established headquarters at Bray, taking over some 66 shafts at Carnoy, Fricourt, Maricourt and La Boisselle. No man&#x27;s land just south-west of La Boisselle was very narrow, at one point about wide, and had become pockmarked by many chalk craters. The British formed the 178th and 179th Tunnelling Companies in August, followed by the 185th and 252nd Tunnelling Companies in October. The 181st Tunnelling Company was also present on the Somme. Elaborate precautions were taken to preserve secrecy, since no continuous front line trench ran through the area opposite the west end of La Boisselle and the British front line. The site was defended by posts near the mine shafts.

The underground war continued with offensive mining to destroy opposing strong points and defensive mining to destroy tunnels, which were long. Around La Boisselle, the Germans dug defensive transverse tunnels about long, parallel to the front line. On 19 November, the 179th Tunnelling Company commander, Captain Henry Hance, estimated that the Germans were away and ordered the mine chamber to be loaded with of explosives, which was completed by midnight on At the Germans blew the charge, filling the remaining British tunnels with carbon monoxide. The right and left tunnels collapsed and it was later found that the German explosion had detonated the British charge. From April 1915 to January 1916, were sprung around , some loaded with of explosives.

==Prelude==

===1916===

At the start of the Battle of Albert (1–13 July), the name given by the British to the first two weeks of the Battle of the Somme, La Boisselle stood on the main axis of British attack. Royal Engineer tunnelling companies were to make two contributions to the Allied preparations for the battle, by placing 19 mines of varying sizes beneath the German positions along the front line and by preparing a series of shallow Russian saps from the British front line into no man&#x27;s land. The saps would be opened at Zero Hour and allow the infantry to attack the German positions from a comparatively short distance. At La Boisselle, four mines were prepared by the Royal Engineers, charges No 2 straight and No 5 right were planted at at the end of galleries dug from Inch Street Trench by the 179th Tunnelling Company, intended to wreck German tunnels and create crater lips to block enfilade fire along no man&#x27;s land.

The Germans in La Boisselle had fortified the cellars of the ruined houses and cratered ground in the vicinity made a direct infantry assault on the village impossible. Y Sap and Lochnagar mines, named after the trenches from which they were dug, were excavated on the north-east and the south-east of La Boisselle, to assist the attack on either side of the German salient in the village. The 185th Tunnelling Company started work on Lochnagar on 11 November 1915. Two officers and sixteen sappers were killed on 4 February, when the Germans detonated a camouflet near the British three-level mine system, starting from Inch Street, La Boisselle, the deepest level being just above the water table at around . The diggings were handed over to 179th Tunnelling Company in March 1916.
The Lochnagar mine consisted of two chambers with a shared access tunnel. The shaft was sunk in the communication trench called Lochnagar Street. After the Black Watch had arrived at La Boisselle at the end of July 1915, many fortifications, originally dug by the French, had been given Scottish names. The Lochnagar mine probably had the first deep incline shaft, which sloped from to a depth of about see map. The tunnel was begun behind the British front line and away from the German front line. Starting from the inclined shaft, about below ground, a gallery was driven towards the German lines. For silence, the tunnellers used bayonets with spliced handles and worked barefoot on a floor covered with sandbags. Flints were carefully prised out of the chalk and laid on the floor; if the bayonet was manipulated two-handed, an assistant caught the dislodged material. Spoil was placed in sandbags and passed hand-by-hand along a row of miners sitting on the floor and stored along the side of the tunnel, later to be used to tamp the charge.

When about from the , the tunnel was branched and the end of each branch was enlarged to form a chamber for the explosives, the chambers being about apart and deep. When finished, the access tunnel for the Lochnagar mine was and had been excavated at a rate of about per day, until about long, with the galleries ending beneath the . The mine was loaded with of ammonal in two charges of and . As the chambers were not big enough to hold all the explosive, the tunnels that branched to form the &#x27;Y&#x27; were also filled with ammonal. One branch was long and the other long. The tunnels did not quite reach the German front line but the blast would dislodge enough material to form a high rim and bury nearby trenches. The Lochnagar and the Y Sap mines were &quot;overcharged&quot; to ensure that large rims were formed from the disturbed ground. Communication tunnels were also dug for use immediately after the first attack, including a tunnel across no man&#x27;s land to a point close to the Lochnagar mine, ready to extend to the crater after the detonation as a covered route. The mines were laid without interference by German miners but as the explosives were placed, German miners could be heard below Lochnagar and above the Y Sap mine.

===1 July===
The four mines at La Boisselle were detonated at on 1 July 1916, the first day on the Somme. The explosion of the Lochnagar mine was initiated by Captain James Young of the 179th Tunnelling Company, who pressed the switches and observed that the firing had been successful. The two charges of the Lochnagar mine created a smooth-sided, flat-bottomed crater in diameter excluding the lip and across the full extent of the lip. It had obliterated between of the German dug-outs, all said to have been full of German troops. The Lochnagar mine, along with Y Sap mine, was the largest mine ever detonated. The sound of the blast was considered the loudest man-made noise in history up to that point, with reports suggesting it was heard in London. They would be surpassed a year later by the mines in the Battle of Messines. The Lochnagar mine lay on the sector assaulted by the Grimsby Chums, a Pals battalion (10th Battalion, The Lincolnshire Regiment). The infantry of the 34th Division, which was composed of Pals battalions from the English provinces, attacked the positions on either side of La Boisselle, of Reserve Infantry Regiment 110 (RIR 110) of the 28th Reserve Division, mainly recruited from Baden.

When the main attack began at the Grimsby Chums occupied the crater and began to fortify the eastern lip, which dominated the vicinity; the advance continued to the (Green [second] position), where it was stopped by the 4th Company, RIR 110, which then counter-attacked and forced the British back to the crater. During the day, German artillery fired into Sausage Valley and in the afternoon began systematically to shell areas and then fire bursts of machine-gun fire to catch anyone who moved. German artillery also began to bombard the crater, where wounded and stragglers sought shelter, particularly those from Sausage Valley to the south of the village. British artillery began to fire on the crater, which led to shell bursts on both slopes, leaving the men inside with nowhere to hide. A British aircraft flew low overhead and a soldier waved a dead man&#x27;s shirt, at which the aeroplane flew away and the British shelling stopped.

====Aerial observation====
The blowing of the Y Sap and Lochnagar mines was witnessed by pilots who were flying over the battlefield to report back on British troop movements. It had been arranged that continuous overlapping patrols would fly throughout the day. 2nd Lieutenant Cecil Lewis (3 Squadron) was warned against flying too close to La Boisselle during his patrol, where two mines were due to go up but watched from a safe distance. Flying up and down the line in a Morane Parasol, he watched from above Thiepval, almost two miles from La Boisselle and later described the early morning scene in his book &quot;Sagittarius Rising&quot; (1977),


As aircraft from 3 Squadron flew over the III Corps area, observers reported that the 34th Division had reached Peake Wood on the right flank, increasing the size of the salient which had been driven into the German lines north of Fricourt but that the villages of La Boisselle and Ovillers had not fallen. On 3 July, air observers noted flares lit in the village during the evening, which were used to plot the positions reached by British infantry.

A communication tunnel was used to contact troops near the new crater and during the afternoon, troops from the 9th Cheshires of the 19th (Western) Division began to move forward and a doctor was sent from the Field Ambulance during the night. By on 2 July, most of the 9th Cheshires had reached the crater and the German trenches adjacent, from which they repulsed several German counter-attacks during the night and the morning. On the evening of 2 July, the evacuation of wounded began and on 3 July, troops from the crater and the vicinity pushed forward to the south-east, occupying a small area against slight opposition.

==Analysis==
Despite their colossal size, the Lochnagar and Y Sap mines failed sufficiently to neutralise the German defences in La Boisselle. The ruined village was meant to be captured in 20 minutes but by the end of the first day on the Somme, the III Corps divisions had suffered more than for no result. At Mash Valley, the attackers lost 5,100 men before noon and at Sausage Valley near the crater of the Lochnagar mine, there were over 6,000 casualties, the highest concentration on the battlefield. The 34th Division in III Corps had suffered the greatest number of casualties of the British divisions engaged on 1 July.

==Commemoration==

William Orpen, an official war artist, saw the mine crater in 1916 while touring the Somme battlefield, collecting subjects for paintings and described a wilderness of chalk dotted with shrapnel. John Masefield also visited the Somme, while preparing &quot;The Old Front Line&quot; (1917), in which he also described the area around the crater as dazzlingly white and painful to look at. After the war the was built nearby; after the Second World War, many of the smaller craters were filled but the Lochnagar mine crater remained. Attempts to fill it in were resisted and the land was eventually purchased by an Englishman, Richard Dunning to ensure its preservation, after he read &quot;The Old Front Line&quot; and was inspired to buy a section of the former front line.

Dunning made more than about land sales in the 1970s and was sold the crater. The site had been used by cross-country motorbikes and for fly tipping but Dunning erected a memorial cross on the rim of the crater in 1986, using reclaimed timber from a Gateshead church; the cross was struck by lightning shortly after its installation and was repaired with metal banding. The site attracts about a year and there is an annual memorial service on 1 July, to commemorate the detonation of the mine and the British, French and German war dead, when poppy petals are scattered into the crater. Richard Dunning, the owner of the crater, was awarded an MBE in the 2017 New Year Honours for services to First World War remembrance.

<doc id="1160129" wikidata="Q474987" url="?curid=1160129" title="Crittenden Compromise">
<text>The Crittenden Compromise was an unsuccessful proposal to permanently enshrine slavery in the United States Constitution, and thereby make it unconstitutional for future congresses to end slavery. It was introduced by United States Senator John J. Crittenden (Constitutional Unionist of Kentucky) on December 18, 1860. It aimed to resolve the secession crisis of 1860–1861 that eventually led to the American Civil War by addressing the fears and grievances of Southern pro-slavery factions, and by quashing anti-slavery activities. The Crittenden Compromise is not to be confused with the Crittenden Resolution, which provided that the Union would take no actions against slavery.

==Background==
The compromise proposed six constitutional amendments and four congressional resolutions. Crittenden introduced the package on December 18. It was tabled on December 31.

It guaranteed the permanent existence of slavery in the slave states and addressed Southern demands in regard to fugitive slaves and slavery in the District of Columbia. It proposed re-instating the Missouri Compromise (which had been functionally repealed in 1854 by the Kansas–Nebraska Act and struck down entirely in 1857 by the Dred Scott decision) and extending the compromise line to the west, with slavery prohibited north of the 36° 30′ parallel and guaranteed south of it. The compromise included a clause that it could not be repealed or amended. 

The compromise was popular among Southern members of the Senate, but it was generally unacceptable to the Republicans, who opposed the expansion of slavery beyond the states where it already existed, into the territories. The opposition of their party&#x27;s leader, President-elect Abraham Lincoln, was crucial. Republicans said the compromise &quot;would amount to a perpetual covenant of war against every people, tribe, and state owning a foot of land between here and Tierra del Fuego&quot;. The only territories south of the line were parts of New Mexico Territory and Indian Territory. There was considerable agreement on both sides that slavery would never flourish in New Mexico. The South refused the House Republicans&#x27; proposal, approved by committee on December 29, to admit New Mexico as a state immediately. However, not all opponents of the Crittenden Compromise also opposed further territorial expansion of the United States. &quot;The New York Times&quot; referred to &quot;the whole future growth of the Republic&quot; and &quot;all the Territory that can ever belong to the United States—the whole of Mexico and Central America&quot;.

==Components==

===Amendments to the Constitution===
# Slavery would be prohibited in any territory of the United States &quot;now held, or hereafter acquired&quot;, north of latitude 36 degrees, 30 minutes line. In territories south of this line, slavery of the African race was &quot;hereby recognized&quot; and could not be interfered with by Congress. Furthermore, property in African slaves was to be &quot;protected by all the departments of the territorial government during its continuance&quot;. States would be admitted to the Union from any territory with or without slavery as their constitutions provided.
# Congress was forbidden to abolish slavery in places under its jurisdiction, such as a military post, within a slave state.
# Congress could not abolish slavery in the District of Columbia so long as it existed in the adjoining states of Virginia and Maryland and without the consent of the District&#x27;s inhabitants. Compensation would be given to owners who refused consent to abolition.
# Congress could not prohibit or interfere with the interstate slave trade.
# Congress would provide full compensation to owners of rescued fugitive slaves. Congress was empowered to sue the county in which obstruction to the fugitive slave laws took place to recover payment; the county, in turn, could sue &quot;the wrong doers or rescuers&quot; who prevented the return of the fugitive.
# No future amendment of the Constitution could change these amendments or authorize or empower Congress to interfere with slavery within any slave state.

===Congressional resolutions===
# That fugitive slave laws were constitutional and should be faithfully observed and executed.
# That all state laws that impeded the operation of fugitive slave laws, the so-called &quot;Personal liberty laws&quot;, were unconstitutional and should be repealed.
# That the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 should be amended (and rendered less objectionable to the North) by equalizing the fee schedule for returning or releasing alleged fugitives and limiting the powers of marshals to summon citizens to aid in their capture.
# That laws for the suppression of the African slave trade should be effectively and thoroughly executed.

==Results==
President-elect Abraham Lincoln vehemently opposed the Crittenden compromise on grounds that he opposed any policy permitting the continued expansion of slavery. Both the House of Representatives and the Senate rejected Crittenden&#x27;s proposal. It was part of a series of last-ditch efforts to provide the Southern states with sufficient reassurances to forestall their secession during the final session of Congress prior to the Lincoln administration taking office.

The Crittenden proposals were also discussed at the Peace Conference of 1861, a meeting of more than 100 of the nation&#x27;s leading politicians, held February 8–27, 1861, in Washington, D.C. The conference, led by former President John Tyler, was the final formal effort of the states to avert the start of war. There too, the Compromise proposals failed, as the provision guaranteeing slave ownership throughout all Western territories and future acquisitions again proved unpalatable.

A February 1861 editorial in the &quot;Charleston Courier&quot; (Charleston, Missouri) summed up the mood prevalent in Southern-leaning border counties as the Crittenden proposals went down in defeat: &quot;Men at Washington think there is no chance for peace, and indeed we can see but little, everything looks gloomy. The Crittenden resolutions have been voted down again and again. Is there any other proposition which will win, that the South can accept? If not—there comes war—and woe to the wives and daughters of our land; beauty will be but an incentive to crime, and plunder but pay for John Brown raids. Let our citizens be prepared for the worst, it may come.&quot; This statement by editor George Whitcomb came in response to a fiery &quot;letter to the editor&quot; excoriating &quot;disunion&quot;, from US Representative John William Noell, whose district included Charleston.

==In popular culture==
The novel &quot;Underground Airlines&quot; (2016) by Ben Winters is set in an alternate history where the Crittenden Compromise was accepted following the assassination of President-elect Abraham Lincoln. By the twenty-first century, slavery had been retained in the &quot;Hard Four&quot; states of Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana.

<text>Kamalakara (1616 – 1700) was an Indian astronomer and mathematician, came from a learned family of scholars from Golagrama, a village situated in Maharashtra State near Partha-puri (Pathari) on the northern bank of the river Godāvarī. His father, Nrsimha, was born in 1586. Two of Kamalakara&#x27;s three brothers were also astronomers and mathematicians. Divakara, who was the eldest of the brothers born in 1606, and Ranganatha who was youngest. Kamalākara learnt astronomy from his elder brother Divākara, who compiled five works on astronomy. His family later moved to Vārāṇasī.

==Major works==
Kamalākara&#x27;s major work, &quot;Siddhāntatattvaviveka&quot;, was compiled in Varanasi at about 1658 and has been published by Sudhakar Dwivedi in the Vārāṇasī series. This work consists of 13 chapters in 3,024 verses. It deals with the topics of: units of time measurement; mean motions of the planets; true longitudes of the planets; the three problems of diurnal rotation; diameters and distances of the planets; the Earth&#x27;s shadow; the Moon&#x27;s crescent; risings and settings; syzygies; lunar eclipses, solar eclipses; planetary transits across the Sun&#x27;s disk; the patas of the Moon and Sun; the &quot;great problems&quot;; along with a conclusion. His other works include Śeṣavāsanā and Sauravāsanā. Kamalākara was bitterly opposed to Munishvara, the author of Siddhāntasārvabhauma.

It is wrongly believed by some moderners that Kamalākara discovered the idea that the pole star we see at present is not exactly at the pole. But this ideas was first expressed in Brahmanda Purana and Matsya Purana by sage Veda Vyasa: &quot;uttAnapAda-putro-asau meDhibhooto dhruvo divi | sa hi bhraman bhtaamayate nityam chandraadityau grahaiH saha ||&quot;. The meaning of this expression is &quot;Uttanapada&#x27;s son Dhruva is fixed like a pole in the Heaven, but it is moving itself and is making all the planets together with Sun and Moon move&quot;.

Kamalākara&#x27;s contribution was to rejuvenate this forgotten idea.

Contributions:
* He combined traditional Indian astronomy with Aristotelian physics and Ptolemaic astronomy as presented by Islamic scientists.
* In the third chapter of the Siddhanta-tattva-viveka Kamalakara used the addition and subtraction theorems for the sine and the cosine to give trigonometric formulae for the sines and cosines of double, triple, quadruple and quintuple angles. In particular he gives formulae for sin(A/2) and sin(A/4) in terms of sin(A) and iterative formulae for sin(A/3) and sin(A/5).
* According to David Pingree, he presents the only Sanskrit treatise on geometrical optics.
* He has assumed a value of 60 units for the radius of the Earth and gives values for sines at 1° intervals.
* Kamalākara also gives a table for finding the right ascension of a planet from its longitude

<text>Jay Marine Cowan (July 31, 1946 – January 23, 2022) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1977 to 1990, and a cabinet minister in the government of Howard Pawley from 1981 to 1988.

Born in Chicago, Cowan left the United States of America during the Vietnam War to avoid that nation&#x27;s military draft. In Canada, he worked as a miner and organizer for the social democratic New Democratic Party. He was a member of the United Steelworkers of America during this period.

In 1977, Cowan was sent by Manitoba NDP leader Edward Schreyer to the northern riding of Churchill to scout for suitable candidates. Perhaps contrary to Schreyer&#x27;s expectations, he secured the nomination for himself (despite the fact that he was not yet a Canadian citizen) and was duly returned in the general election that followed, defeating Progressive Conservative Mark Ingebrigtson by about 300 votes.

In 1979, Cowan was one of the most prominent supporters of Howard Pawley in the latter&#x27;s successful bid to succeed Schreyer as party leader. Cowan was re-elected in the general election of 1981 (this time defeating Ingebrigtson by around 1350 votes); the NDP won the election, and he was appointed Minister of Northern Affairs on November 30, 1981, with responsibility for Environmental Management, the Clean Environment Act, the Workers Compensation Act, the Workplace Safety and Health Act, and the Communities Economic Development Fund Act.

Following a cabinet shuffle on November 4, 1983, Cowan was named Minister of Co-operative Development and Chairman of the Treasury Board. He was again re-elected without difficulty in the general election of 1986.

On April 17, 1986, Cowan was relieved of his position with the Treasury Board and was named government house leader. He continued to serve as Minister of Co-operative Development, and was also the Minister of Native Affairs (without portfolio) responsible for the Natural Gas Supply Act from September 21, 1987 to November 23, 1987.

The NDP were unexpectedly defeated in the legislature in 1988, after disgruntled backbencher Jim Walding voted with the opposition in a narrowly divided house. Cowan was one of only twelve New Democrats (in a 57-member house) to be returned in the 1988 general election. In opposition, he opposed the proposed labour reforms of Progressive Conservative Premier Gary Filmon. He chose not to seek re-election in 1990.

Cowan was director of special projects at the Anokiiwin Training Institute, working with aboriginal groups in Manitoba and northwestern Ontario. As of 2003, he was also the chair of the Manitoba Federation of Labour&#x27;s health and safety committee. Cowan died on January 23, 2022.

<text>Paṇḍita Jagannātha Samrāṭ (1652–1744) was an Indian astronomer and mathematician who served in the court of Jai Singh II of Amber, and was also his guru.

Jagannātha, whose father&#x27;s name was Gaṇeśa, and grandfather&#x27;s Viṭṭhala was from a Vedic family originally from Maharashtra.

At the suggestion of Jai Singh, he learned Arabic and Persian, in order to study Islamic astronomy. Having become proficient in these languages, he translated texts in these languages into Sanskrit. These translations include:
* &quot;Rekhā-gaṇita&quot;, a translation of Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; made from Nasir al-Din al-Tusi&#x27;s Arabic recension of the same. For this work, he had to coin more than a hundred Sanskrit mathematical terms
* &quot;Siddhānta-sāra-kaustubha&quot;, a translation of Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot; from Nasir al-Din al-Tusi&#x27;s Arabic version

His original works include:
*‍&quot;Siddhānta-samrāṭ&quot;, which describes astronomical instruments, their design and construction, and observations. It also describes the use of these observations in correcting parameters and preparing almanacs. It mentions how J‌ai Singh, who earlier used astronomical instruments (such as the astrolabe) made of metal, later switched to huge outdoor observatories (such as the Jantar Mantar), as they were more precise; also they were made of stone and mortar rather than brick, to diminish the effects of wear-and-tear and climate.
* &quot;Yantra-prakāra&quot;, which describes astronomical instruments, measurements, computations, etc. in more detail, and also observations made by him.

Jagannātha held that when theory and observation differed, observation was the true &quot;pramāṇa&quot; and overruled theory. While he used and described a number of astronomical instruments, telescopes were not one of them.

<text>William George Rathie (April 1, 1914 – November 26, 1994) was a Canadian accountant and politician. He was the 30th mayor of the city of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, serving from 1963 through 1966.

Rathie was born in Vancouver and worked as a tax accountant. He was first elected to Vancouver City Council in 1959 as a member of the Non-Partisan Association, a civic political party. In 1962, Rathie wrested the NPA nomination from incumbent mayor Thomas Alsbury, and was elected to succeed him in that office.

Vancouver in the mid-sixties was enjoying spectacular growth in its economy and population, and was well on its way to becoming a major international city. During his tenure, a 20-year programme for Vancouver&#x27;s redevelopment, encompassing transportation, low-cost housing, and downtown revitalization was outlined. Its scope and orientation would lead to controversy and protest following Rathie&#x27;s term of office.

<text>Manava (c. 750 BC – 690 BC) is an author of the Hindu geometric text of &quot;Sulba Sutras.&quot;

The Manava Sulbasutra is not the oldest (the one by Baudhayana is older), nor is it one of the most important, there being at least three Sulbasutras which are considered more important. Historians place his lifetime at around 750 BC.

Manava would have not have been a mathematician in the sense that we would understand it today. Nor was he a scribe who simply copied manuscripts like Ahmes. He would certainly have been a man of very considerable learning but probably not interested in mathematics for its own sake, merely interested in using it for religious purposes. Undoubtedly he wrote the &quot;Sulbasutra&quot; to provide rules for religious rites and it would appear almost a certainty that Manava himself would be a Hindu priest.

The mathematics given in the &quot;Sulbasutras&quot; is there to enable accurate construction of altars needed for sacrifices. It is clear from the writing that Manava, as well as being a priest, must have been a skilled craftsman.

Manava&#x27;s &quot;Sulbasutra,&quot; like all the &quot;Sulbasutras,&quot; contained approximate constructions of circles from rectangles, and squares from circles, which can be thought of as giving approximate values of π. There appear therefore different values of π throughout the &quot;Sulbasutra,&quot; essentially every construction involving circles leads to a different such approximation. The paper of R.C. Gupta is concerned with an interpretation of verses 11.14 and 11.15 of Manava&#x27;s work which give π = 25/8 = 3.125.

<text>Lalla ( 720–790 CE) was an Indian mathematician, astronomer, and astrologer who belonged to a family of astronomers. Lalla was the son of Trivikrama Bhatta and the grandson of Śâmba. He lived in central India, possibly in the Lāṭa region in modern south Gujarat. Lalla was known as being one of the leading Indian astronomers of the eighth century.
Only two of his works are currently thought to be extant.

His best-known work is the &quot;Śiṣyadhīvṛddhidatantra&quot; (&quot;Treatise which expands the intellect of students&quot;). This text is one of the first major Sanskrit astronomical texts known from the period following the 7th-century works of Brahmagupta and Bhāskara I. It generally treats the same astronomical subject matter and demonstrates the same computational techniques as earlier authors, although there are some significant innovations, such that Lalla’s treatise offers a compromise between the rival astronomical schools of his predecessors, Āryabhaṭa I and Brahmagupta. It is within the &quot;Śiṣyadhīvṛddhidatantra&quot; that the earliest known description of &quot;perpetual motion&quot; is described.

The other extant work by Lalla is the &quot;Jyotiṣaratnakośa&quot; (&quot;Treasury of Jewels&quot;), a treatise on catarchic astrology. This work is one of the earliest known Sanskrit astrological works for determining auspicious and inauspicious times. No edition of this text has ever been published while the known manuscripts are incomplete.

In his work, Lalla drew on his predecessors Brahmagupta, and Bhāskara I. In turn, he influenced later generations of astronomers, including Āryabhaṭa II, Śrīpati, Vaṭeśvara, and Bhāskara II (who later wrote a commentary on the &quot;Śiṣyadhīvṛddhidatantra&quot;).

He followed the Āryapakṣa or the school of Āryabhaṭa (continued by Bhāskara I), but divided the &quot;mahāyuga&quot; in the traditional way, following the Brāhmapakṣa school
of Brahmagupta.

<text>Operation Bodenplatte (; &quot;Baseplate&quot;), launched on 1 January 1945, was an attempt by the Luftwaffe to cripple Allied air forces in the Low Countries during the Second World War. The goal of &quot;Bodenplatte&quot; was to gain air superiority during the stagnant stage of the Battle of the Bulge so that the German Army and Waffen-SS forces could resume their advance. The operation was planned for 16 December 1944, but was delayed repeatedly due to bad weather until New Year&#x27;s Day, the first day that happened to be suitable. It resulted in almost 500 destroyed Allied airplanes.

Secrecy for the operation was so tight that not all German ground and naval forces had been informed of the operation and some units suffered casualties from friendly fire. British signals intelligence recorded the movement and buildup of German air forces in the region, but did not realise that an operation was imminent.

The operation achieved some surprise and tactical success, but was ultimately a failure. A great many Allied aircraft were destroyed on the ground but replaced within a week. Allied aircrew casualties were quite small, since the majority of Allied losses were grounded aircraft. The Germans, however, lost many pilots who could not be readily replaced.

Post-battle analysis suggests only 11 of the Luftwaffe&#x27;s 34 air combat &quot;Gruppen&quot; (groups) made attacks on time and with surprise. The operation failed to achieve air superiority, even temporarily, while the German ground forces continued to be exposed to Allied air attack. &quot;Bodenplatte&quot; was the last large-scale strategic offensive operation mounted by the Luftwaffe during the war.

==Background==
The armies of the Western Allies were supported by the Allied Air Forces as they advanced across Western Europe in 1944. The Royal Air Force (RAF) and its Second Tactical Air Force—under the command of Air Marshal Arthur Coningham—moved No. 2 Group RAF, No. 83 Group RAF, No. 84 Group RAF and No. 85 Group RAF to continental Europe in order to provide constant close air support. The RAF harassed the German air, sea and ground forces by hitting strong points and interdicting their supply lines while reconnaissance units apprised the Allies of German movements. With Allied air superiority, the German Army could not operate effectively. The Luftwaffe, equally, found it difficult to provide effective air cover for the German Army. Although German aircraft production peaked in 1944 the Luftwaffe was critically short of pilots and fuel, and lacked experienced combat leaders.

The land battles moved towards the River Rhine, to the east of which lay the German heartland. Most of France had been liberated, as had the Belgian cities Brussels and Antwerp. Although Operation Market Garden had failed in 1944, by 1945 the Allies had overrun most of the southern Netherlands and the Scheldt Estuary. As the ground forces moved across Europe, the Allied tactical air forces moved into new bases on the continent, to continue providing close support. The only limiting factor for the Allies was the weather. As winter came, rain and mud turned airfields into quagmires, so large-scale air and land operations came to a halt.

The situation might well have continued until the spring thaw had the German High Command (&quot;Oberkommando der Wehrmacht&quot;) not launched the Battle of the Bulge on 16 December 1944. This land offensive was intended to improve the German military position by capturing Antwerp and separating the British Army from United States Army forces. Part of the planning for the German land operation required the attack to be conducted under the cover of bad winter weather, which kept the main Allied asset, the Tactical Air Forces, on the ground. It initially succeeded, but the weather also grounded the Luftwaffe for the most part. Nevertheless, the Luftwaffe did manage to put 500 aircraft into the air on 16 December, more than had been achieved for a long time. This first day had been the originally planned date for the strike against Allied airfields, named Operation Bodenplatte. However, the weather proved particularly bad and operations were shut down.

The offensive achieved surprise and much initial success. To counter the attack from the air, the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) handed operational control of its XXIX Tactical Air Command and part of its Ninth Air Force, under the command of Major General Hoyt Vandenberg, to the RAF and Arthur Coningham. On 23 December, the RAF Second Tactical Air Force provided the American forces with much needed support, and helped prevent a German capture of Malmedy and Bastogne. This left the Germans with only the logistical bottleneck of St. Vith to support their operations. The German attack faltered.

The Luftwaffe had been far from absent over the front in December. It flew several thousand sorties over the theatre. Its encounters with the RAF and USAAF had meant heavy losses in &quot;matériel&quot; and pilots. On the eight days of operations between 17 and 27 December 1944, 644 fighters were lost and 227 damaged. This resulted in 322 pilots killed, 23 captured and 133 wounded. On the three days of operations 23–25 December, 363 fighters were destroyed. None of the &quot;Geschwaderkommodoren&quot; expected any large-scale air operations by the end of the month.

==Plan==

In September 1944, Adolf Hitler resolved to recover Germany&#x27;s deteriorating fortunes by launching an offensive in the West. On 16 September, Hitler directed &quot;Generalleutnant&quot; Werner Kreipe—Chief of the Luftwaffe&#x27;s General Staff—to prepare the necessary aircraft for the offensive. On 21 October, Kreipe ordered the air fleet defending the Greater German &quot;Reich&quot; (&quot;Luftflotte Reich&quot;) to hand over seven &quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; and &quot;Schlachtgeschwader&quot; to Air Command West (&quot;Luftwaffenkommando West&quot;) for a future offensive.

On 14 November, Hermann Göring—Commander-in-Chief of the Luftwaffe—ordered the 2. &quot;Jagddivision&quot; and the 3. &quot;Jagddivision&quot; to prepare their units for a large-scale ground attack operation in the Ardennes. Preparations were to be complete by 27 November. The attack was to be carried out on the first day of the offensive.

&quot;Generalmajor&quot; Dietrich Peltz was to plan the operation having been appointed C-in-C of II. &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; on 8 December. &quot;Luftwaffenkommando&quot; West had ordered all units—except &quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; 300 and 301—to attend the main planning meeting in Flammersfeld on 5 December. On 14 December, Peltz officially initiated plans for a major blow against the Allies in northwest Europe. Peltz was not a fighter pilot; his combat record was as a dive bomber pilot, flying the Junkers Ju 87 &quot;Stuka&quot;. His experiences in Poland, in France, and during the early campaigns on the Eastern Front had moulded him into an outstanding ground attack specialist, making him an ideal candidate for planning &quot;Bodenplatte&quot;.

On 15 December, this plan was worked out with the help of the Luftwaffe&#x27;s &quot;Jagd-Geschwaderkommodore&quot;, among them Gotthard Handrick (&quot;Jagdabschnittsführer Mittelrhein&quot;; Fighter Sector Leader Middle Rhine), Walter Grabmann and Karl Hentschel, commanders of 3. and 5. &quot;Jagddivision&quot; respectively. It was originally scheduled to support the Battle of the Bulge, the German Army&#x27;s offensive, which began 16 December 1944. However, the same bad weather that prevented the RAF and USAAF from supporting their own ground forces also prevented the Luftwaffe from carrying out the operation. It was therefore not launched until 1 January 1945. By this time, the German Army had lost momentum owing to Allied resistance and clearing weather, which allowed Allied Air Forces to operate. The German Army attempted to restart the attack by launching Operation Northwind (&quot;Unternehmen Nordwind&quot;). The Luftwaffe was to support this offensive through &quot;Bodenplatte&quot;.

The plan of &quot;Bodenplatte&quot; called for a surprise attack against 17 Allied air bases in Belgium, the Netherlands and France. The object was to destroy or cripple as many Allied aircraft, hangars and airstrips as possible. Every fighter and fighter-bomber &quot;Geschwader&quot; (Wing) currently occupied with air defence along the Western Front was redeployed. Additional night-fighter units (&quot;Nachtjagdgeschwader&quot;) and medium bomber units (&quot;Kampfgeschwader&quot;) acted as pathfinders. The strike formations themselves were mostly single-engine Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighters.

However, in a blunder, the planners had set flight paths that took many units over some of the most heavily defended areas on the continent, namely the V2 launch sites around The Hague. These sites were protected by large numbers of German anti-aircraft artillery (AAA) units. At the turn of 1944/45 Air Command West had 267 heavy and 277 medium or light AAA batteries, and in addition to this there were 100 &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; AAA batteries along the Dutch coast. Most of these lay in the sector of the 16th AAA Division, with its control station at Doetinchem, northeast of Arnhem. Some of the AAA units had been warned about the air operation but were not kept up to date with developments about changing timetables and the flight plan of German formations. As a result, one quarter of the German fighter units lost aircraft to friendly fire before the attacks could be initiated.

After five years of war and heavy attrition many of the Luftwaffe&#x27;s pilots were inexperienced and poorly trained, deficient in marksmanship and flight skills. There was a shortage of experienced instructors, and many of the training units were forced to fly front-line operations in order to bolster the front-line &quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot;. Aviation fuel supplies were also at a premium, limiting the duration of training. Long-range Allied fighters exacerbated this situation by shooting down many training aircraft. By late 1944 there were no safe areas in which pilots could be trained without the possibility of air attack. The result was a &quot;vicious circle&quot;: poorly trained pilots were quickly lost in combat or accidents, and the need to replace them put more pressure on the training system. Allied personnel who witnessed the attacks remarked on the poor aim of the strafing aircraft, and many of the Luftwaffe aircraft shot down by Allied anti-aircraft fire were caught because they were flying too slowly and too high.

The plan called for strict radio silence and secrecy in order to maintain surprise. Maps were also only half complete, identified only enemy installations, and left out flight paths, lest the document fall into Allied hands enabling them to trace the whereabouts of German fighter bases. Most commanders were also refused permission to brief their pilots until moments before take-off. This created operational confusion. Commanders got across only the bare essentials of the plan. When the operation got under way, many German pilots still did not understand what the operation was about, or what exactly was required of them. They were convinced it was just a reconnaissance in force over the front, and were happy to follow their flight leaders on this basis.

===Targets and order of battle===

It is unclear whether all of the following were deliberately targeted. Evidence suggests that Grimbergen, Knocke and Ophoven were targeted in error, as was Heesch. In all, the &quot;Oberkommando der Luftwaffe&quot; (OKL) deployed 1,035 aircraft from several &quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; (JG—fighter wings) &quot;Kampfgeschwader&quot; (KG—bomber wings), &quot;Nachtjagdgeschwader&quot; (NJG—night fighter wings) and &quot;Schlachtgeschwader&quot; (SG—ground attack wings); of these, 38.5% were Bf 109s, 38.5% Fw 190As, and 23% Fw 190Ds.

Below is the German target list:

===Codenames===
Following the Operation Bodenplatte raids, the Allies retrieved several log-books from crashed German aircraft. In several of these, the entry &quot;Auftrag Hermann 1.1. 1945, Zeit: 9.20 Uhr&quot; was translated as &quot;Operation Hermann to commence on 1 January 1945, at 9:20am.&quot; This led the Allies to believe the operation itself was named Hermann for Hermann Göring. Five further different codes were used for the attack:
* &quot;Varus&quot;: Indicating that the operation was &quot;a go&quot; and that it would take place within 24 hours of the &quot;Varus&quot; order being given.
* &quot;Teutonicus&quot;: Authority to brief the pilots and to arrange for the aircraft to be armed and ready at the edge of the airfield.
* &quot;Hermann&quot;: Giving the exact date and time of the attack.
* &quot;Dorothea&quot;: Indicating a delay in the attack.
* &quot;Spätlese&quot; (&quot;late harvest&quot;): Cancelling of the attack after formations are airborne.

===Allied intelligence===
Allied intelligence failed to detect the German intention. In Ultra transcripts, there were only a few indications of what was happening on the other side of the front. On 4 December 1944, II &quot;Jagdkorps&quot; had ordered stockpiling for navigational aids, such as &quot;golden-rain&quot; flares and smoke bombs. Allied intelligence made no written observations of this communication. They also disregarded communications to Junkers Ju 88 groups regarding the use of flares when leading formations. Intelligence concluded that these instructions were designed for a ground support mission rather than an interception operation. This was reasonable, but no indications of possible ground targets were given.

On 20 December, a 3. &quot;Jagddivision&quot; message was intercepted confirming that the locations for emergency landing grounds during a &quot;special undertaking&quot; had remained unchanged. This was a clear indication that something was amiss, but Allied intelligence did not comment on it. It also ignored more messages indicating that low-level attacks were being practised. Allied intelligence, by 16 December, had monitored the reshuffling of both German Army and Luftwaffe formations opposite the American-held front at the Ardennes. Yet nothing major was suspected.

==Battle==

===Maldegem, Ursel and St. Denijs Westrem===

&quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; 1 (JG 1) was responsible for the attack on the Ursel and Maldegem airfields. &quot;Oberstleutnant&quot; Herbert Ihlefeld led the &quot;Geschwader&quot;. The formation was mixed; Stab., (headquarters flight or &quot;Stabschwarm&quot;, attached to every &quot;Geschwader&quot;), I. and II./JG 1 operated the Fw 190 while the III./JG 1 flew the Bf 109. I./JG 1 lost four of their number to friendly anti-aircraft fire. Three of the four pilots were killed.

The attacks at Maldegem and Ursel began at 08:30. Both I. and II./JG 1 became involved in intense dogfights. III./JG 1 had lost only one aircraft over the target (and not to enemy fire). I./JG lost a further Fw 190 to friendly anti-aircraft fire as it made its way to Ursel. I./JG 1 lost at least two further Fw 190s to friendly anti-aircraft fire. Casualties could have been heavier, had the British anti-aircraft defences of Maldegem airfield not been moved in December.

Stab. and I./JG 1 lost 13 Fw 190s and nine pilots were missing; five were killed and four were captured. Thus the loss rates in personnel and &quot;matériel&quot; were 39 and 56%, respectively. III./JG 1 lost only three Bf 109s with one pilot dead and two captured. I./JG 1 claimed 30 British or New Zealand Spitfires on the ground and two shot down over Maldegem. At Maldegem, 16 aircraft were destroyed, and at Ursel only six were lost. The claims of I./JG 1 were actually more in line with British and New Zealand total losses at both Maldegem and Ursel. No. 131 Wing RAF / Polish Wing lost 13 Spitfires plus two damaged beyond repair, a total of 15 lost. At Ursel, six aircraft were destroyed, including, a B-17, two Lancasters and a Mosquito. I. and III./JG 1 lost a total of 16 aircraft and 12 pilots.

II./JG 1 attacked the airfield at St. Denijs Westrem. Of the 36 II./JG 1 Fw 190s that took off, 17 were shot down, a staggering 47% loss rate. Among the pilots lost were several experienced fliers. In exchange, the Germans shot down two Spitfires, and seven forced-landed. At St. Denijs Westrem 18 Spitfires were destroyed on the ground.

Altogether JG 1 lost 25 pilots and 29 aircraft. This return for around 60 enemy aircraft (54 on the ground) cannot be considered a complete success, although the damage at St. Denijs Westrem and Maldegem had been significant. Just nine of the fighters lost by JG 1 are confirmed to have been shot down in combat with Spitfires. It is possible a further three were shot down by Spitfires, or perhaps ground fire. Two Spitfires were shot down and destroyed, with two more damaged. One pilot of each squadron (308 and 317) was killed. The total Spitfire losses were perhaps 32.

===Sint-Truiden===

&quot;Schlachtgeschwader&quot; 4 and &quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; 2 (SG 4 and JG 2) were to strike at Sint-Truiden airfield. JG 2 was commanded by Kurt Bühligen. I./JG 2&#x27;s ground crews made ready 35 of 46 Fw 190s, 29 of which were Fw 190Ds. Only 33 pilots were fit for operations, so the &quot;Gruppe&quot; reported only 33 Fw 190s ready. II./JG 2 could field 20 of 29 Bf 109s. Stab./JG 2 had three Fw 190s ready for the mission. It is not clear whether Bühligen took part in the mission. III./JG 2 (Siegfried Lemke) reported 40 Fw 190s operational, 34 of them Fw 190Ds. However, only 28 of the 43 pilots in the unit were fit for operations and the formation fielded only 28 fighters. In total, 84 aircraft were ready on 31 December, including 28 Fw 190D-9s.

SG 4 was led by Alfred Druschel. It had 152 machines on strength, of which just 60 were operational, yet the 129 pilots were fit for action. Stab./SG 4 had three Fw 190s and two pilots. I./SG 4 had 21 Fw 190s operational and 27 pilots ready. II./SG 4 reported 27 Fw 190s ready, but pilot strength is unknown. III./SG 4 reported 24 Fw 190s, but only 16 were available at the forward airfields. Pilot strength is unknown. Best estimations make it around 60 Fw 190s operational, of which 55 took part.

At 09:12, JG 2 crossed the front line at Malmedy and was greeted by an enormous volume of Allied ground fire. The entire area was heavily defended by anti-aircraft artillery, since the area had been the scene of heavy fighting, but also had been attacked by V-1 and V-2 missiles. I./JG 2 lost at least seven fighters to ground fire alone. III./JG 2 lost 10 fighters. A possible seven Bf 109s from II./JG 2 were also lost to ground fire. JG 2 attacked Asch and Ophoven airfields by mistake.

JG 2&#x27;s mission was a disaster. I./JG 2 lost 18 Fw 190s and six more were damaged by ground fire and enemy aircraft. This represented 73% of their force. Of the 15 pilots missing, six would survive as POWs. II./JG 2 lost five Bf 109s and three were damaged a loss rate of 40%. Pilot losses were three missing, one dead and one wounded. III./JG 2 lost 19 Fw 190s and three were damaged, a loss rate of 79%. Nine pilots were killed, two were wounded and four were captured. JG 2 losses, according to another source, amounted to 40% of its force. Pilot losses were 24 killed or posted missing, 10 captured and four wounded. Another source asserts that pilot losses stood at 23 killed or missing.

SG 4&#x27;s mission was also a disaster. During the assembly phase, they flew across JG 11&#x27;s flight path, and the formation was broken up. Some of the pilots joined JG 11 in the confusion. Unable to recover the formation, I. and II./SG 4 then decided to head home. The &quot;Geschwaderkommodore&quot;, Druschel, had continued with five other pilots from III./SG 4 who had lost contact with their &quot;Gruppe&quot;. They crossed the front near Hürtgenwald around 09:10. As they did so, American anti-aircraft batteries opened fire, claiming seven aircraft in the next 30 minutes. Only six of the 50 Fw 190Fs of SG 4 carried out an attack, against airfields near Aachen and the Asch aerodrome. Of these six, four did not return. Druschel himself was reported missing.

===Volkel and Heesch===
The target of &quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; 6 (JG 6) was Volkel. I. and III./JG 6 were to attack while II./JG 6 was to provide cover against Allied fighters. I./JG 6 got 29 of its 34 Fw 190s ready, while 25 of II./JG 6&#x27;s fighters took part. Overall, most of the 99 Fw 190s were made available for the operation. III./JG 6 received orders to target petrol installations on the airfield only. Only 78 Fw 190s took off.

While on course, JG 6 approached the airfield of Heesch and some of its pilots assumed it to be Volkel airfield. It is unlikely that the Heesch strip, built in October 1944, was known to the Luftwaffe. No. 126 Wing RCAF was based there and had dispatched its 411 and 442 Squadrons on recce missions early that morning so the majority of its units were airborne. Its 401 Squadron was readying for takeoff when JG 6 appeared at 09:15. Most of the German pilots had failed to notice the airfield, concentrating on keeping formation at low altitude. 401 Squadron scrambled. Some of the German fighters were authorised to engage, while the main body continued to search for Volkel. Stab., and II./JG 6 stumbled on another strip at Helmond, which contained no aircraft. Several German pilots believed it to be Volkel and attacked, losing several of their number to ground fire. II./JG 6 suffered severely from Spitfire and Tempests based at Helmond. Very little damage was done at Heesch or Helmond.

In the event, all four &quot;Gruppen&quot; failed to find Volkel and its Hawker Tempests remained untouched. The only success JG 6 had was I./JG 6&#x27;s erroneous attack on Eindhoven, which claimed 33 fighters and six medium bombers. Like Volkel, Helmond and Heesch had escaped damage. In the dogfights over Helmond, JG 6 claimed six victories. In fact, only two Spitfires were shot down and one badly damaged. Only one further fighter, a Hawker Typhoon, was shot down. Stab./JG 6 lost the &quot;Geschwaderkommodore&quot;, Kogler, as a POW. Of I./JG 6&#x27;s 29 Fw 190s, seven were lost and two damaged; of II./JG 6&#x27;s 25 Fw 190s, eight were destroyed and two damaged; III./JG 6 lost 12 out 20 Bf 109s. In total, JG 6 lost 43% of its strength and suffered 16 pilots killed or missing and seven captured. As well as Kogler, one other commanding officer was lost—&quot;Gruppenkommandeur&quot; Helmut Kühle. Three &quot;Staffelkapitäne&quot; were lost: &quot;Hauptmann&quot; Ewald Trost was captured, &quot;Hauptmann&quot; Norbert Katz was killed and Lothar Gerlach was posted missing, presumed killed.

===Antwerp-Deurne and Woensdrecht===
Deurne airfield was to be destroyed by &quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; 77 (JG 77). Antwerp housed the largest Allied contingent of nine Squadrons. It had been incessantly attacked by V-1 cruise missiles and V-2 SRBM ballistic missiles, and had been given a strong anti-aircraft defence.

At 08:00, two formations of 18 Bf 109s of I. and III./JG 77, led by &quot;Major&quot; Siegfried Freytag, took off with their pathfinders. At the same time 23 Bf 109s of II./JG 77 took off. Around the Bocholt area they formed up with the other two &quot;Gruppen&quot;. Heading south and still north of Antwerp, JG 77 passed Woensdrecht airfield. It was home to No. 132 Wing RAF and its five Spitfire squadrons; No. 331 Squadron RAF, No. 332 Squadron RAF (Norwegian), No. 66 Squadron RAF and No. 127 Squadron RAF, and No. 322 Squadron RAF (Dutch). Some pilots from II./JG 77 either mistakenly believed it to be Antwerp, or thought the opportunity was too good to pass up. Two German fighters were claimed shot down, and one pilot captured. However, none of the JG 77 casualties fit this description.

The main body continued to Antwerp. Some 12–30 German fighters attacked the airfield from 09:25 to 09:40. The ground defences were alert and the German formations attacked in a disorganised manner. 145 Wing RAF was missed completely and considering the large number of targets the destruction was light; just 12 Spitfires were destroyed.

In total, 14 Allied aircraft were destroyed and nine damaged. JG 77 lost 11 Bf 109s and their pilots were lost. Six were killed and five captured according to Allied sources. However, German records show the loss of only 10 pilots. Four are listed as captured.

===Metz-Frescaty===

&quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; 53 (JG 53) was tasked with the operation against the USAAF airfield at Metz-Frescaty Air Base. Stab., II., III., and IV./JG 53 were available. III./JG 53 was to destroy anti-aircraft installations in the Metz area, while the other &quot;Gruppen&quot; knocked out the airfields.

The USAAF XIX Tactical Air Command had established a strong presence in northeast France and was supporting the U.S. 3rd Army. JG 53 was to knock out its airfields. Some 26 Bf 109s took off but were intercepted by 12 P-47s of the 367th Fighter Squadron, 358th Fighter Group. The P-47s claimed 13 destroyed, one probable and six damaged for no losses. On the way home at 09:20, III./JG 53 were intercepted by 366th Fighter Squadron. Altogether, III./JG 53 lost 10 Bf 109s and one damaged to the 358th Fighter Group. Of the 25 III./JG 53 Bf 109s that took part, 11 were shot down representing 40% of the attacking force. The 358th Fighter Group received the Distinguished Unit citation for preventing the attack on the 362nd Fighter Groups airfield.

Although III./JG 53 failed, the main attack was a success by comparison. Stab. II. and IV./JG 53 encountered no difficulties on the outward leg. The Germans caused significant damage among the parked USAAF fighters on the field. When the attack against the Metz airfield was over, the three JG 53 &quot;Gruppen&quot; reported the loss of 20 Bf 109s and seven damaged. This represented more than 50 percent of the attacking 52 fighters. Some 13 pilots were missing; three were killed, six remain missing as of today, and four were captured. A further three were wounded. JG 53 claimed 27 USAAF fighters on the ground and eight damaged. Added to this total is four aerial victories. In total JG 53 lost 30 Bf 109s and eight damaged in the two operations. This was a total loss of 48%. The losses of the USAAF were 22 destroyed, 11 damaged (all P-47s).
However, the negative effects of &quot;Bodenplatte&quot; on JG 53 outweighed any advantages gained.

===Le Culot and Ophoven===
Le Culot airfield (later known as Beauvechain) was northeast of Charleroi and was the target of &quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; 4 (JG 4). The main strip (A-89) was known locally as Beauvechain, and an auxiliary field known as Le Culot East (Y-10), known to the locals as Burettes, was nearby. It was known to the Luftwaffe because several of its units had operated there.

&quot;Geschwaderkommodore Major&quot; Gerhard Michalski commanded the force. Five pilots were shot down by ground fire. Another pilot got lost during the flight and ended up near Eindhoven where he was shot down and killed. Reduced in number, 8–10 fighters of IV./JG 4 continued to their target. After 10 minutes, they located a fairly large airfield and attacked, believing it to be Le Culot. It was in fact Sint-Truiden.

The mistake was easy to make, Le Culot was located nearby. Sint-Truiden housed the 48th Fighter Group and 404th Fighter Group. The 492nd Fighter Squadron was readying to take off at 09:20. JG 4 hit the airfield at 09:15. Several P-47s taxiing out were abandoned by pilots and strafed to destruction. The small-scale attack by JG 4 had achieved considerable damage. Total American losses were 10 destroyed and 31 damaged. The Germans lost eight fighters, including seven Bf 109s, and three damaged. No damage was done at Le Culot airfield.

II.(Sturm)/JG 4 took off for Le Culot at 08:08. Getting lost, they stumbled upon Asch airfield and claimed one P-47 destroyed and two twin-engine aircraft damaged, as well as two trains and trucks destroyed. The unit claimed an Auster reconnaissance aircraft shot down. The machine was probably a Stinson L-1 Vigilant of the 125th Liaison Squadron, U.S. Army. However, virtually the entire &quot;Gruppe&quot; of 17 Fw 190s was wiped out.

I. and III./JG 4 were to strike Le Culot together. Taking off at 08:20 and heading northwest, they comprised a force of 35 Bf 109s (nine from III./JG 4). Two Ju 88G-1s of II./NJG 101 lead as pathfinders. Some of I./JG 4 attacked No. 125 Wing RAF Spitfires at Ophoven airfield. Spitfire losses are unclear. Two P-47s and a B-17 were destroyed. I./JG 4 reported two Bf 109s missing, one damaged and one destroyed. Just a hangar, one P-47 and several vehicles were claimed, and the anti-aircraft battery was silenced. The attack on the Spitfires at Ophoven and the mentioned B-17 and two P-47s are not included in the total. Another source suggests two Spitfires destroyed and 10 damaged at Ophoven.

According to one source, JG 4&#x27;s losses were 25 fighters of the 55 that took part. With 17 pilots killed or missing and seven captured, JG 4 suffered a 42% loss rate. A more recent source claims a total of 75 aircraft of JG 4 took part, with only 12 attacking ground targets. Two Ju 88 pathfinders were lost, as well as 26 fighters with six more damaged.

===Asch===

The Asch Airfield (Designated: Y-29) had been constructed in November 1944 and was home to the 352nd Fighter Group, 8th Air Force, and the 366th Fighter Group, Ninth Air Force. &quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; 11 (JG 11) was to destroy the airfield. I./JG 11 had only 16 Fw 190s on strength and only six fit and operational pilots. Only six of I./JG 1&#x27;s pilots took part, and just four of Stab./JG 1&#x27;s pilots participated. III./JG 11 had more aircraft than pilots, and so other &quot;Staffeln&quot; made up the numbers. Just 41 Fw 190s of JG 11 took part in &quot;Bodenplatte&quot;; four from the Stab., six from I. &quot;Gruppe&quot; and 31 of III. &quot;Gruppe&quot;. The 20 fighters from II. &quot;Gruppe&quot; were Bf 109s.

The plan called for a low-level strike by I. and III./JG 11, while II./JG 11 flew as top cover against USAAF fighters. The pilots were shown maps and photographs of the airfield, but were not told the targets&#x27; identity until the morning of the attack. After crossing Allied lines, four fighters were lost to AAA fire. The course of JG 11 took it directly over Ophoven. Large formations of JG 11 attacked, in the mistaken belief it was Asch. The other half continued to Asch. Ophoven housed No. 125 Wing RAF, just north of Asch. About half, or some 30 Fw 190s and Bf 109s attacked the airfield.

Asch was notable for a chance event. The 390th Squadron of the 366th Fighter Group had launched two fighter sweeps that morning, which played a crucial role in the failure of JG 11&#x27;s attack. The leader of the 487th squadron, 352nd Fighter Group, John Charles Meyer, anticipated German activity and had a flight of 12 P-51s about to take off on a combat patrol when the attack began. They took off under fire.

Several pilots made &quot;Ace&quot; status that day. No P-51s were lost; two were damaged and one was damaged on the ground. The 336th Fighter Group lost one P-47. The 366th was credited with eight enemy aircraft, and AAA claimed seven more. However, overclaiming is likely. Luftwaffe records indicate JG 11 lost 28 fighters. Four German pilots (two wounded) made it back to German-held territory, while four were captured and the remaining twenty were killed. Some 24 of the Bf 109s and Fw 190s lost were lost over enemy lines. German pilots Günther Specht and Horst-Günther von Fassong were among those German pilots killed.

Little is known about the claims of JG 11. According to one German document, 13 fighters, two twin-engine and one four-engine aircraft were claimed destroyed. Five fighters were claimed damaged on &quot;Glabbeek airfield&quot;—in reality it was Ophoven. Ten aerial victories and one probable were also claimed. But U.S. Fighter Group losses indicate these claims are excessive.

The Americans claimed 35 German aircraft destroyed. Only 14 can be judged with a degree of certainty to have been shot down by USAAF fighters, and possibly two more. Four are confirmed to have been shot down by AAA fire. Total JG 11 losses were 28. The air battle over Asch had lasted 45 minutes and came to be known as, &quot;The Legend of Y-29&quot;.

===Brussels-Evere/Grimbergen===
I. Gruppe of &quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; 26 (JG 26) and the III. &quot;Gruppe&quot; of &quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; 54 (JG 54) were to strike Grimbergen. II. and III. Gruppen of &quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; 26 (JG 26) were to strike at Brussels-Evere. At the end of December, II./JG 26 had 39 Fw 190D-9s and III./JG 26 had 45 Bf 109s. Records of available aircraft indicate 110 aircraft of JG 26 flew that day; all but 29 were Fw 190s, the remainder were Bf 109s. 17 Fw 190s from III./JG 54 took part with JG 26.

Unknown to the Luftwaffe the Grimbergen Airfield was almost completely abandoned. The Evere airfield was located to the south. It was one of the most densely populated airfields in Belgium and had plenty of targets. The main force consisted of 60 Spitfire XVIs of No. 127 Wing RAF. Also present were B-17s and B-24s of the Eighth Air Force. Overall, well over 100 aircraft were on the field.

At 08:13, the first formations took off. In total, 64 Fw 190D-9s participated. Before the target was reached, some 14 Fw 190D-9s were forced to turn back due to AAA damage or mechanical difficulties. Three Fw 190s were lost to German AAA fire. At 09:10, when the front was reached, Allied heavy AAA units began to engage the formation and another five were shot down. Most of the fire was from British Naval AAA defences defending the Scheldt Estuary. As the formation crossed the Dutch and Belgian border, I./JG 26 and III./JG 54 were intercepted by Spitfires. Five of the Fw 190s were shot down. I./JG 26 and III./JG 54 destroyed or damaged the few aircraft at the airfield. AAA defences claimed five kills and the two gruppen reported two Fw 190s lost to Spitfires. Several others were lost over the airfield. Other losses occurred against friendly fire again on the return flight.

The raid was a disaster. Just six machines were destroyed at Grimbergen for the loss of 21 Fw 190s and two damaged. Another eight sustained minor damage. Seventeen pilots were missing, including eight captured.

Only II. and III./JG 26 hit Evere. Between 44 and 52 Fw 190s from these units took off. II. and III./JG 26 knocked out the flak towers and destroyed anything combustible: hangars, trucks, fuel dumps and aircraft. 127 Wing RCAF lost one Spitfire in the air and 11 on the ground; 11 vehicles were damaged and one was destroyed. A total of 60–61 Allied aircraft were destroyed at Evere. A large number of transports were located there and attracted the attention of German pilots, which left many more Spitfires undamaged. Given the number of Spitfires on the field, the Canadian wing suffered &quot;low&quot; losses. The Canadian wing commander—Johnnie Johnson—blamed the poor marksmanship of German pilots for failing to achieve further success.

Allied losses are given at Evere as 32 fighters, 22 twin-engine aircraft and 13 four-engine aircraft destroyed, plus another nine single-, six twin- and one four-engine aircraft damaged. In total, II./JG 26 losses included 13 Fw 190s destroyed and two damaged. Nine of its pilots were missing; five were killed and four captured. III./JG 26 lost six Bf 109s and four pilots. Only one of them was captured, the remainder were killed. The amount of damage the Germans inflicted made up for the losses; the Evere strike was a success.

===Brussels-Melsbroek===

&quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; 27 and IV./&quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; 54 (JG 27 and JG 54) targeted Melsbroek airfield. On 31 December, JG 27 could only muster the following operational pilots and aircraft: 22 (22) from I., 19 (13) from II., 13 (15) from III., and 16 (17) from IV. &quot;Gruppe&quot;. &quot;Geschwaderkommadore&quot; Wolfgang Späte had rebuilt IV./JG 54. It had only 21 pilots and 15 of its 23 Fw 190s were operational. Altogether 28 Bf 109s of JG 27 and 15 Fw 190s of JG 54 took off. Seven fighters were lost to enemy aircraft and friendly AAA fire before they reached the target.

The Germans hit Melsbroek hard. According to Emil Clade (leading III./JG 27), the AAA positions were not manned, and aircraft were bunched together or in lines, which made perfect targets. The attack caused considerable damage among the units based there and was a great success. The Recce Wings had lost two entire squadrons&#x27; worth of machines. No. 69 Squadron RAF lost 11 Vickers Wellingtons and two damaged. No. 140 Squadron RAF lost four Mosquitoes, the losses being made good the same day. At least five Spitfires from No. 16 Squadron RAF were destroyed. No. 271 Squadron RAF lost at least seven Harrow transports &quot;out of action&quot;. A further 15 other aircraft were destroyed. 139 Wing reported five B-25s destroyed and five damaged. Some 15 to 20 USAAF bombers were also destroyed. Another source states that 13 Wellingtons were destroyed, as were five Mosquitoes, four Auster and five Avro Ansons from the Tactical Air Forces 2nd Communications Squadron. Three Spitfires were also lost and two damaged. At least one RAF Transport Command Douglas Dakota was destroyed.

The pilots of JG 27 and JG 54 claimed 85 victories and 40 damaged. German reconnaissance was able to confirm 49. JG 27 suffered unacceptable losses; 17 Bf 109s, 11 pilots killed, one wounded and three captured. IV./JG 54 lost two killed and one captured. Three Fw 190s were lost and one damaged.

===Gilze-Rijen and Eindhoven===
&quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; 3 (JG 3) and &quot;Kampfgeschwader&quot; 51 (KG 51) were tasked with eliminating the Allied units at the Eindhoven base and Gilze-Rijen airfield. The field contained three RCAF reconnaissance squadrons operating a mix of Spitfires and Mustangs and eight Typhoon squadrons of the RAF and RCAF. Some 22 Bf 109s of I./JG 3 took off, along with four from Stab./JG 3, 15 from III./JG 3 and 19 Fw 190s from IV./JG 3. KG 51 contributed some 21 of their 30 Messerschmitt Me 262 jets to the action. Some histories mistakenly include &quot;Kampfgeschwader&quot; 76 (KG 76) on the order of battle, but KG 76 did not take part in the mission.

Each &quot;Staffel&quot; was expected to make at least three firing passes. I./JG 3 took off and joined the lead &quot;Gruppe&quot;, IV. (Sturm)/JG 3, with III./JG 3 following in the rear. The Bf 109s and Fw 190s of the &quot;Geschwader&quot; reached the area at about 09:20. &quot;Geschwaderkommodore&quot; Heinrich Bär led the attack. Some pilots made four passes, destroying AAA emplacements, fuel storage stations and vehicles. Nearly 300 aircraft were on the field, along with huge stores of equipment and fuel. The attack caused fires all over the airfield.

JG 3 claimed 53 single-engine and 11 twin-engine aircraft destroyed. Five fighters and one four-engine bomber were also claimed damaged. Four Typhoons, three Spitfires, one Tempest and another unidentified aircraft were claimed shot down. All in all, JG 3 destroyed 43 aircraft according to British records, and damaged a further 60, some seriously. The &quot;Geschwader&quot; believed it had destroyed 116. JG 3 did not come away unscathed. I./JG 3 lost nine of its aircraft and pilots, a 50% loss rate. Damage to the returning &quot;Gruppe&quot; aircraft meant the entire unit was unserviceable. RAF AAA were credited with shooting down five. JG 3 lost, altogether, 15 of the 60 fighters sent, a 25% loss rate. Some 15 pilots were missing; nine were killed and five captured, and another pilot was posting as missing in action and his fate remains unknown. Another source says 16 pilots; ten killed or missing and six captured.

The damage done to Eindhoven was significant and can be considered a victory for JG 3. It was also assisted by elements of JG 6 which had misidentified Eindhoven as one of their targets. The greatest losses were amongst the Recce squadrons of the Canadian 39 Wing, which suffered 24 aircraft destroyed or damaged. The visiting 124 Wing RAF lost 30 aircraft destroyed or damaged. No. 143 Wing RCAF lost 29 damaged or destroyed. It is likely that I./JG 3 was responsible for about 2/3 of the damage. Another source gives 47 aircraft destroyed and 43 damaged.

===Possible V-2 missile launch attempts===

At least one V-2 missile on a mobile &quot;Meillerwagen&quot; launch trailer was observed being elevated to launch position by a USAAF 4th Fighter Group pilot over the northern German attack route near the town of Lochem on 1 January 1945. Possibly on account of the launch crew sighting the American fighter, the rocket was quickly lowered from a near launch-ready 85° elevation to 30°.

==Results of raid==
The results of the raid are difficult to judge given the confusion over loss records. It is likely more aircraft were destroyed than listed. The Americans failed to keep a proper record of their losses and it appears the U.S. 8th Air Force losses were not included in loss totals. When these estimates and figures are added to the losses listed in the table below, it is likely that the correct figures are 232 destroyed (143 single-engine, 74 twin-engine and 15 four-engine) and 156 damaged (139 single-engine, 12 twin-engine and five four-engine). Researching individual squadron records confirms the destruction of even more USAAF aircraft. This suggests at least a further 16 B-17s, 14 B-24s, eight P-51s, and at least two P-47s were destroyed on top of that total. A total of 290 destroyed and 180 damaged seems a more realistic summation than the conservative figures given by the USAAF, RAF, and RCAF. Including the 15 Allied aircraft shot down and 10 damaged in aerial combat, 305 destroyed and 190 damaged is the sum total of the attack.

The results of the attacks are listed:


==Aftermath and casualties==
The operation achieved tactical surprise, but it was undone by poor execution due to low pilot skill resulting from poor training. The operation failed to achieve its aim and that failure was very costly to German air power. Some of the units of the RAF, RCAF and USAAF on the receiving end of &quot;Bodenplatte&quot; had been badly hit, others not so badly, but most had sustained some losses. The Germans, however, launched &quot;Bodenplatte&quot; under a set of conditions, such as poor planning and low pilot skill, which clearly indicated any advantage gained would be outweighed by possible losses. &quot;Bodenplatte&quot; weakened the &quot;Jagdwaffe&quot; past any hope of rebuilding. General of the Luftwaffe Adolf Galland said, &quot;We sacrificed our last substance.&quot;

The Luftwaffe lost 143 pilots killed and missing, while 70 were captured and 21 wounded including three &quot;Geschwaderkommodore&quot;, five &quot;Gruppenkommandeure&quot;, and 14 &quot;Staffelkapitäne&quot;—the largest single-day loss for the Luftwaffe. Many of the formation leaders lost were experienced veterans, which placed even more pressure on those who were left. Thus, &quot;Bodenplatte&quot; was a very short-term success but a long-term failure. Allied losses were soon made up, while lost Luftwaffe aircraft and especially pilots were irreplaceable. German historian Gerhard Weinberg wrote that it left the Germans &quot;weaker than ever and incapable of mounting any major attack again.&quot;

In the remaining 17 weeks of war the &quot;Jagdwaffe&quot; struggled to recover sufficiently from the 1 January operation to remain an effective force. In strategic terms, German historian Werner Girbig wrote, &quot;Operation Bodenplatte amounted to a total defeat&quot;. The exhausted German units were no longer able to mount an effective defence of German airspace during Operation Plunder and Operation Varsity, the Allied crossing of the Rhine River, or the overall Western Allied invasion of Germany. Subsequent operations were insignificant as a whole, and could not challenge Allied air supremacy. The only service in the Luftwaffe capable of profitable sorties was the night fighter force. In the last six weeks of the war the Luftwaffe was to lose another 200 pilots killed. Girbig wrote, &quot;it was not until the autumn of 1944 that the German fighter forces set foot down the sacrificial path; and it was the controversial Operation Bodenplatte that dealt this force a mortal blow and sealed its fate. What happened from then on was no more than a dying flicker.&quot;

<text>Āpastamba Dharmasūtra (Sanskrit: आपस्तम्ब धर्मसूत्र) is a Sanskrit text and one of the oldest Dharma-post vedic smriti related texts of Hinduism that have survived into the modern age from the 1st millennium BCE. It is one of three extant Dharmasutras texts from the Taittiriya school which is relatively newer in comparison to Maitrayaniya shakha of Krishna Yajurveda, the other two being &quot;Baudhayana Dharmasutra&quot; and &quot;Hiranyakesin Dharmasutra&quot;.

The &quot;Apastamba Dharmasutra&quot; is part of &quot;Apastamba Kalpasutra&quot; collection, along with &quot;Apastamba Shrautasutra&quot; and &quot;Apastamba Grihyasutra&quot;. One of the best preserved ancient texts on Dharma, it is also notable for mentioning and citing views of ten ancient experts on Dharma, which has led scholars to conclude that there existed a rich genre of Dharmasutras text in ancient India before this text was composed.

==Authorship, location and dates==

The Dharmasutra is attributed to Apastamba, the founder of a Shakha (Vedic school) of Yajurveda. According to the Hindu tradition, Apastamba was the student of Baudhayana, and himself had a student named Hiranyakesin. Each of the three founded a Vedic school, and each of their schools produced a collection of literature within the Krishna Yajurveda tradition, one that included separate Kalpasutra compilations. They were founders of their traditions, but it is unclear if they authored the Dharmasutras. It is, states Patrick Olivelle, possible that the Apastamba Dharmasutra is ascribed to Apastamba, but actually composed by others in his school.

The Apastamba tradition may be from south India, possibly near where modern Andhra Pradesh is between Godavari and Krishna rivers, but this is not certain. The verse 2.17.17 of the Apastamba Dharmasutra mentions a practice of &quot;northerners&quot; but it in unclear what &quot;north&quot; means in the context it is used. Further, the ancient grammarian Panini refers to it too, and he is generally placed in northwest Indian subcontinent. Olivelle states that the three Taittiriya school Dharmasutras mention practices of north and south, but never clarify how far north or south they are referring to, but placing Dharmasutras in the southern Indian peninsula implies that Brahmanical ideas had established themselves or emerged in the south by the 1st millennium BCE. According to Olivelle, the Yajurveda schools may have been in what is north India today, and the Apastamba Dharmasutra may have been composed in north India, rather than south. In contrast, Robert Lingat states that epigraphical evidence such as the Pallava inscriptions confirm that Apastamba tradition existed in South India, in ancient times, in parts of what became Madras Presidency in the colonial British India.

Kane estimated that Apastamba Dharmasutra dates from approximately 600-300 BCE, and later more narrowly to between 450 and 350 BCE. Lingat states that the internal evidence within the text hints of great antiquity, because unlike later Dharma texts, it makes no mention of Buddhism. Other scholars, such as Hopkins, assert that all this can be explained to be an artifact of its relatively remote geographical origins in Andhra region. Olivelle, and several other scholars, in contrast, state that the first version of Apastamba Dharmasutra may have been composed after others, but the extant version of the Apastamba text is the oldest Dharma text from ancient India.

Regardless of the relative chronology, the ancient Apastamba Dharmasutra, states Olivelle, shows clear signs of a maturing legal procedure tradition and that there were Dharma texts in ancient India before it was composed.

==Organization and content==
The text is in sutra format, and part of thirty &quot;prashnas&quot; (प्रश्न, portions, issue, questions) of Apastamba Kalpasutra. The Apastamba Dharmasutra is the 28th and 29th &quot;prashna&quot; of this compilation, while the first 24 &quot;prashnas&quot; are about Shrautasutras (vedic rituals), 25th is an ancillary mantra section, 26th and 27th are Grihyasutras (householder rites of passage), and the last or the 30th &quot;prashna&quot; is a Shulbasutra (mathematics for altar building). The text is systematically arranged, cross references to other sections of the Kalpasutra compilation so extensively and accurately, as if it is the work of a single author.

Of the two books of this Dharmasūtra, the first is devoted to the student tradition and the second book is devoted to the householder tradition.

==Significance==

The &quot;Āpastamba Dharmasutra&quot; is notable for placing the importance of the Veda scriptures second and that of &quot;samayacarika&quot; or mutually agreed and accepted customs of practice first. Āpastamba proposes that scriptures alone cannot be source of Law (dharma), and dharma has an empirical nature. Āpastamba asserts that it is difficult to find absolute sources of law, in ancient books or current people, according to Patrick Olivelle, with &quot;The Righteous (dharma) and the Unrighteous (adharma) do not go around saying, &#x27;here we are!&#x27;; Nor do gods, Gandharvas or ancestors declare, &#x27;This is righteous and that is unrighteous&#x27;.&quot;

Most laws are based on agreement between the Aryas, states Āpastamba, on what is right and what is wrong. Laws must also change with ages, states Āpastamba, a theory that became known as &quot;Yuga dharma&quot; in Hindu traditions. Āpastamba also asserts in verses 2.29.11-15 a broad minded and liberal view, states Olivelle, that &quot;aspects of dharma not taught in Dharmasastras can be learned from women and people of all classes&quot;. The Apastamba Dharmasutra also recognizes property rights of women, and her ability to inherit wealth from her parents. Sita Anantha Raman notes, &quot;As a southerner from Andhra, Āpastamba was familiar with southern customs, including matriliny. He gave importance to the &#x27;married pair&#x27; (ĀDS 2.1.7-10) who performed Vedic rites together for the prosperity of the family.&quot;

Āpastamba used a hermeneutic strategy to assert that the Vedas once contained all knowledge including that of ideal Dharma, but parts of Vedas have been lost. Human customs developed from the original complete Vedas, but given the lost text, one must use customs between good people as a source to infer what the original Vedas might have stated the Dharma to be. This theory, called the ‘lost Veda’ theory, made the study of customs of good people as a source of dharma and guide to proper living, states Olivelle.

Apastamba has given a strikingly accurate value for formula_1 in his which is correct up to five decimal places.
 Apastamba in his Sulbasutras provide approximate value of square root of 2 as follows:
:formula_2

==Commentaries==
Several ancient commentaries (&quot;bhasya&quot;) were written on this Dharmasūtra, but only one by Haradatta named &quot; has survived into the modern era. Haradatta, possibly from South India and one who lived in 12th- or 13th-century commented on the praśnas of Āpastamba Gṛhyasūtra as well as Gautama&#x27;s Dharmasūtra.

Haradatta&#x27;s commentary on Apastamba Dharmasutra was criticized by Boehtlingk in 1885 for lacking &quot;European critical attitude&quot;, a view that modern scholars such as Patrick Olivelle have called unjustified and erroneous because Haradatta was a very careful commentator, far more than Boehtlingk and many other 19th-century Orientalists were.

<text>Mafaufau Tavita Lio Mafaufau Sanerivi Talimatasi (born 21 November 1972), known as David Tua, is a Samoan-New Zealand former professional boxer who competed from 1992 to 2013. A highly ranked heavyweight contender for most of his career, Tua was known for his formidable punching power, especially in his left hook. He scored sixteen wins by knockout in the first round, which included knockouts of world heavyweight champions John Ruiz and Michael Moorer within thirty seconds of the first round, as well as late stoppages of world champions Oleg Maskaev and Hasim Rahman. He was ranked by BoxRec in the world&#x27;s top 10 heavyweights from 1996 to 2003, reaching his highest ranking of No.3 in 1998. He was also ranked the No.1 heavyweight contender in 2000 by the WBC and IBF, leading up to his bout with Lennox Lewis. Tua ended his career with a knockout-to-win rate of 82.6%. In a 2003 article by &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine, Tua was ranked 48th on a list of 100 greatest punchers of all time.

Nicknamed the &quot;Tuamanator&quot;, his fast-paced bob and weave pressure fighting style has often drawn comparisons to Mike Tyson. Tua fought many of the best boxers of his era and challenged once for the unified world heavyweight title against Lennox Lewis in 2000. In his five professional losses, Tua was never subject to a stoppage and was considered to have one of the most durable chins of his time.

==Early life==
Tua said that he lived with four brothers, four sisters and ten other relatives while growing up, and his mother held down three jobs while his father worked long hours. He claims that his father forced him to start boxing when he was seven years old, and is grateful for the introduction to the sport.

==Amateur career==
In his early career, Tua trained three days a week at a small gym in Mangere Bridge, under boxing trainer Gerry Preston. Tua became New Zealand national heavyweight champion in 1988 at age 15.

At the age of 19 Tua won a bronze medal at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. He lost his semi-final to David Izonritei, whom he would later knock out as a professional. Tua turned professional later the same year.

==Professional career==

Tua debuted in December 1992. Of his first 27 fights, 23 were won by knockout.

In Tua&#x27;s 1997 fight against Ike Ibeabuchi, the two fighters combined to set the record for most punches thrown in a heavyweight fight on record. Ibeabuchi won the decision, handing Tua his first professional loss. Prior to this, Tua had scored devastating knockouts against future titlist John Ruiz (via 1st-round KO, in only 19 seconds) and Darroll Wilson. Tua also beat David Izon and future champion Oleg Maskaev to set up the fight with Ibeabuchi. After the loss to Ibeabuchi, Tua took on future champ Hasim Rahman and TKO&#x27;d Rahman in the 10th round. The victory over Rahman marked the beginning of Tua&#x27;s struggles with his weight. He ballooned up to 253 pounds when he defeated Obed Sullivan in 2000 by KO. Later that year, he weighed 245 pounds in the loss to Lennox Lewis. Tua was disappointing in the fight, with both fighters avoiding each other and Tua not throwing combinations. Tua lost a clear-cut decision.

The fight with Lewis was for the WBC, IBF, &amp; IBO heavyweight titles and took place in November 2000. Tua lost on points by a wide margin.

Following the Lewis loss, Tua regained steam with a KO over Danell Nicholson but lost by a close decision in his next fight to future champion Chris Byrd. In 2002 he beat prospect Fres Oquendo and demolished Michael Moorer in his next fight with a powerful shot 30 seconds into the first round, which put Moorer out cold. In 2003 he drew in a 12-round rematch with Rahman.

===2005 comeback===
Tua was inactive for over two years before he stepped into the ring on 31 March 2005 and bested Talmadge Griffis in a 10-round bout—ending the match and earning a TKO victory with 26 seconds remaining. Tua&#x27;s next contest in October 2005 ended in a split decision over Cisse Salif with Tua dominating in the late rounds.

Tua defeated Edward Gutierrez by knockout in the fourth round of a scheduled 10-rounder on 26 July 2006. The fight was held at the Manhattan Center ballroom in New York City, and featured on ESPN2. Tua started slowly, scored a knockdown with his famous left hook in the second round, and put Gutierrez down for the count in the fourth round with a combination of two left hooks, one to the head and the decisive one to the body.

In November 2006 Tua defeated Maurice Wheeler in the seventh round of a scheduled 10-rounder by knockout. Tua ended the bout with a solid left uppercut to the body which immediately sent the howling Wheeler to the canvas.

Tua continued his comeback in February 2007 with a unanimous decision over Robert Hawkins in a 10-round bout. Tua ended the match being the aggressor and hurt Hawkins in both the ninth and tenth rounds with body punches, but was unable to end the match with a knockout.

Tua, looking in good shape and weighing in at 237½ lbs (his lightest fight weight since 2001), was featured as the main event of a Pay Per View show on 18 August 2007 in Sandy, Utah and ended the bout quickly with a first-round knockout of Mexican champion Saul Montana. Tua threw two powerful left hooks to the head that sent Montana sprawling to the canvas giving Tua his sixth win in a row.

Tua, again looking in good shape and weighing in at 234 lbs, fought the unheralded Cerrone Fox at the Soaring Eagle Casino, Mt. Pleasant, Michigan on 7 September 2007. Tua made short work of his over matched opponent ending the bout at 1:41 of the second round.

While Tua&#x27;s promoter, Cedric Kushner, stated Tua was scheduled to fight an opponent on 18 October 2007, the fight never materialized.

===2009 comeback===

Tua fought fellow New Zealander Shane Cameron at Mystery Creek, Hamilton on 3 October 2009 with Tua knocking Cameron out seven seconds into the second round to pick up the WBO Asia Pacific and Oriental Heavyweight titles. The promoters for the fight were John McRae and David Higgins of Duco Events. The fight had been scheduled for an earlier date, but was delayed due to Cameron having surgery on a fractured hand.

On 31 March 2010 Tua fought Friday Ahunanya, winning on points after 12 rounds. The fight promoters for this fight were again John McRae and David Higgins of Duco Events.

The Tua-Barrett fight had been tentatively scheduled for 26 June in São Paulo, Brazil. However, the fight was moved to 17 July at the Tropicana Casino and Resort in Atlantic City in a bid to promote David Tua&#x27;s career in the United States. At 38 years old, Monte Barrett (34-9, 20 KOs) was viewed by some as an easy opponent for Tua as he had lost his previous three fights. The match was a controversial draw with Tua being knocked down for the first time in his professional career late in the 12th round.

Tua fought Demetrice King on 19 March 2011. Tua defeated King by unanimous decision with the scores of 100–91, 100–91, and 100–90.

Tua&#x27;s rematch against Monte Barrett on 13 August 2011 resulted in a unanimous points decision going in favour of Barrett. The judges scored the bout 113–112, 115–112, and 115–112.

In December 2011, it emerged that Monte Barrett tested positive for banned stimulant methylhexanamine following a urine test after his 13 August points decision over Tua. Tua&#x27;s lawyer, Blair Edwards, called for action against the 40-year-old New Yorker requesting the return of Tua&#x27;s WBO Asia-Pacific and Oriental titles and the restoration of ranking points.

===2013 comeback and retirement===
In June 2013 it was confirmed that Tua was once again getting back into the ring. Belarusian Alexander Ustinov defeated him by unanimous points decision, following which he announced his retirement from professional boxing. &quot;Ringside Report&quot; were mixed in their evaluation of his career, referring to him as &quot;one of the best heavyweights never to win a world title&quot;.

==Outside the ring==
On 10 October 1992 Tua appeared on the New Zealand version of the game show &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;. He had asked for an &quot;O for Olsen&quot; (possibly a reference to Olsen Filipaina) but this was heard by some (and widely reported) as &quot;O for awesome&quot;. He requested &quot;P&quot; when buying a vowel on the same episode. He was also heard to ask if he could buy a &quot;constonant&quot; during the same show.

From 1992 to 2003, Tua was managed by former boxer Kevin Barry, who also trained him from 2001. In 2003 Tua ended his business relationship with Barry and financial manager Martin Pugh. Though Barry accepted his dismissal as trainer, he resisted Tua&#x27;s decision to end their contract, which still had two years to go.
In 2004, Tua&#x27;s accountant learned that the boxer&#x27;s finances with his boxing company, Tuaman Inc. Ltd., were tangled with company expenses; Tua no longer had most of his 20 million NZD in purses from his professional matches, and important assets Tua thought he owned alone were anything but, including a piece of coastal land at Pākiri. Tuaman Inc. Ltd had business expenses flowing in various directions, involving companies and clients Tua had no knowledge of. Tua&#x27;s own home was purchased with borrowed money, and the boxer&#x27;s purses were linked to renovation costs for Martin Pugh&#x27;s property. These findings were based on documents from Pugh&#x27;s offices.

In 2005 Tua took Kevin Barry and Martin Pugh to court over their business arrangements. Barry and Pugh accused Tua of manipulating them to collect revenue, yet Tua maintained that he knew little of the men&#x27;s affairs and did what they told him to do out of trust. The dispute gave both sides legal victories: over the issue of the coastal land property, the court ruled in favour of Barry and Pugh, since Tua failed to properly clarify his ownership over the land; on the issue of the terminated 2003 contract, the court ruled in Tua&#x27;s favour, concluding he clearly owed no expenses to his former management from that contract. In October 2009, it was reported in &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; that the parties had settled all previously unresolved matters arising from the protracted litigation.

In May 2007, Cedric Kushner, president of Gotham Boxing Inc. and Tua&#x27;s promoter, filed a $5 million lawsuit against IBF heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko and promoter Shelly Finkel among others – and while the lawsuit is unrelated to Tua, Kushner has stated he will drop the lawsuit if Tua is given a title bout against Klitschko in 2008, which ultimately failed to materialize.

In September 2009, Tua&#x27;s aunt was killed in the Samoa tsunami. In early October he travelled to Samoa with cousin Va&#x27;aiga Tuigamala to see how they could help.

In the 2019 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Tua was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to youth, boxing and the community, having previously been appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to boxing, in the 2001 New Year Honours.

In 1996, Tua was honoured by the country of Tuvalu, with a stamp commemorating the 1996 Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta, Georgia, United States bearing Tua&#x27;s likeness and name on it.

==In popular culture==

*Tua is mentioned in an episode of the animated series &quot;Family Guy&quot;, when character Stewie draws Tua&#x27;s likeness on a wall.
*In 2020, he is seen to be in a gathering opposing the legalisation of recreational use of cannabis.

<text>A fore-and-aft rig is a sailing vessel rig with sails set mainly along the line of the keel, rather than perpendicular to it as on a square rigged vessel.

==Description==
Fore-and-aft rigged sails include staysails, Bermuda rigged sails, gaff rigged sails, gaff sails, gunter rig, lateen sails, lug sails, tanja sails, the spanker sail on a square rig, and crab claw sails.

Fore-and-aft rigs include:
* Rigs with one mast: the proa, the catboat, the sloop, the cutter
* Rigs with two masts: the ketch, the yawl
* Rigs with two or more masts: the schooner

Barques and barquentines are partially square rigged and partially fore-and-aft rigged.

A rig which combines both on a foremast is known as a hermaphroditic rig.

==History==
===Austronesia===
The fore-and-aft rig is believed to have been developed independently by the Austronesian peoples some time after 1500 BC with the invention of the crab claw sail. It is suggested that it evolved from a more primitive V-shaped &quot;square&quot; sail with two spars that come together at the hull. Crab claw sails spread from Maritime Southeast Asia to Micronesia, Island Melanesia, Polynesia, and Madagascar via the Austronesian migrations. Austronesians in Southeast Asia also later developed other types of fore-and-aft sails, such as the tanja sail (also known as the canted square sail, canted rectangular sail, or the balance lug sail).

Their use later spread into the Indian Ocean since the first millennium, among vessels from the Middle East, South Asia, and China.

===Europe===
The lateen was developed in the Mediterranean as early as the 2nd century AD, during Roman times. It became common by the 5th century.

The square rig had predominated in Europe since the dawn of sea travel, but in the generally gentle climate of southern Europe and the Mediterranean Sea during the last few centuries before the Renaissance the fore-and-aft began to replace it. By 1475, its use increased, and within a hundred years the fore-and-aft rig was in common use on rivers and in estuaries in Britain, northern France, and the Low Countries, though the square rig remained standard for the harsher conditions of the open North Sea as well as for trans-Atlantic sailing.

<doc id="1160173" wikidata="Q504482" url="?curid=1160173" title="Tsutomu Nihei">
<text>is a Japanese manga artist. Nihei has been drawing comics professionally since the mid-1990s. In 1995 he was awarded the Jiro Taniguchi Special Prize in that year&#x27;s &quot;Afternoon&quot; Four Seasons Award for his submission, &quot;Blame&quot;. After working as an assistant to veteran comic artist Tsutomu Takahashi, Nihei went on to launch his debut series &quot;Blame!&quot; in &quot;Monthly Afternoon&quot; in 1997. Following the success of &quot;Blame!&quot;, he next penned &quot;&quot; (published by Marvel Comics) and &quot;Biomega&quot;. In 2009, Nihei returned to &quot;Afternoon&quot; to launch what would become his most successful series, &quot;Knights of Sidonia&quot;. An architectural student, Nihei&#x27;s early work were mainly wordless, relying on visuals and backgrounds to tell their stories. His cyberpunk-influenced artwork has gained a strong cult following worldwide.

==Career==
Nihei worked in construction but quit to work on becoming a manga artist. He went to New York and studied at the Parsons School of Design. His experience in construction and design has shown up in his manga in his depiction of huge structures which are a strong theme in his manga works.

Nihei has several sources of inspiration, including manga, American comics and bandes dessinées. Japanese comics that strongly influenced him include &quot;Akira&quot;, &quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind&quot; and &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;. He was also enormously inspired by Swiss artist H. R. Giger, best known for his airbrush images of humans and machines connected in cold biomechanical relationships. Other sources of inspirations include Hard science fiction novels, Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, French artist Jean &quot;Mœbius&quot; Giraud and Clive Barker of &quot;Hellraiser&quot; fame. Nihei is also a big video games fan, and mentioned &quot;Metroid&quot; and the &quot;Halo&quot; franchise among his favorites. In the mid-2000s, during a trip to the United States, he met the Halo design team, who directly offered him to participate in &quot;The Halo Graphic Novel&quot; project when they found out that he was a huge fan of the game.

Nihei designed the logo for the record label Lingua Sounda, formed in 2011 by the rock band Buck-Tick. He was a special guest of San Diego Comic-Con in July 2016. He also received an Inkpot Award from Comic-Con International, the organization that runs San Diego Comic-Con and WonderCon. Given to creators for “contributions to the worlds of comics, science fiction/fantasy, film, television, animation, and fandom services,” the Inkpot Award is an honor that Nihei now shares with other comics, film, and sci-fi legends such as Osamu Tezuka, Mœbius, and Ray Bradbury. 

In 2024, Nihei created the Font &quot;Toa heavy industries&quot; in partnership with Iwata Corporation.

<doc id="1160177" wikidata="Q76344" url="?curid=1160177" title="Hamzah Haz">
<text>Hamzah Haz (15 February 1940 – 24 July 2024) was the ninth vice president of Indonesia from 2001 to 2004 under President Megawati Sukarnoputri. Prior to serving as vice president, Hamzah served as a cabinet minister and a member of the People&#x27;s Representative Council (DPR). He also chaired the United Development Party (PPP) from 1998 to 2007, and was the party&#x27;s presidential candidate in the 2004 Indonesian presidential election.

==Early political career==
Hamzah was a newspaper journalist in his home town of Pontianak, on the island of Borneo, and later taught economics at Tanjungpura University. He was a lecturer at Tanjungpura University from 1968 to 1971. 

His political career began in 1968 as a member of the West Kalimantan Provincial Representative Council. He later moved to Jakarta, became a member of the Parliament in 1971, representing the Jakarta electoral district, first as a member of the Muslim Nahdlatul Ulama Party. After the political fusion which joined all Islamist parties into one party and the withdrawal of Nahdlatul Ulama from politics, in 1973 he became a member of the newly formed Partai Persatuan Pembangunan (PPP). He was chairman of the PPP faction from 1989 to 1998. Hamzah served as member of People&#x27;s Representative Council over 26 years and made him one of the longest-serving members of the Parliament of Indonesia.

Hamzah served as Minister for Investment under President B. J. Habibie, who replaced Suharto, then resigned that post to lead the PPP in the 1999 elections, at which he was again reelected. He ran against Megawati Sukarnoputri for the vice presidency (at that time elected by the People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly), winning 284 votes to Megawati&#x27;s 396. On 30 November he joined the cabinet of President Abdurrahman Wahid, then became the first to quit Wahid&#x27;s first cabinet, resigning as Coordinating Minister for People&#x27;s Welfare and Poverty Alleviation after just two months.

==Vice presidency==

He became a vocal critic of Wahid, but he was also known for his ability to compromise. By the time of Wahid&#x27;s impeachment in the summer of 2001, Hamzah was leader of the PPP, then the third-largest party in the Indonesian Parliament.

In the 2004 presidential election, Hamzah was one of the presidential candidates, running with Agum Gumelar. The pair finished last among the five candidates, garnering only 3 percent of the total vote.

==Connections with militant Islamism==
A number of journalists and commentators reported that Hamzah was believed to have offered support for militant Muslim groups as a way of gaining political support from them. In 2002, Bill Guerin, in an opinion piece in the &quot;Asia Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Hamzah ... is widely seen as blatantly vying for support from among Indonesian Muslims, including the militant groups, to strengthen his run for the presidency in the country&#x27;s next general elections in 2004.&quot;

Hamzah was also reported to be a friend of Abu Bakar Ba&#x27;asyir, who is the spiritual leader for the terrorist organization Jemaah Islamiyah. While vice president, Hamzah made a public show of inviting Ba&#x27;asyir to dinner, and visited his jihadist pesantren (religious school) in Pondok Ngruki. Hamzah denied that Ba&#x27;asyir was connected to terrorism up until Ba&#x27;asyir&#x27;s arrest in October 2002, and was quoted as saying before Ba&#x27;asyir&#x27;s arrest &quot;If you want to arrest Abu Bakar Ba&#x27;asyir .. you will have to deal with me first.&quot;

In October 2002, an article in &quot;Time&quot; stated &quot;That clerics like Abu Nakar [Ba&#x27;asyir] have powerful military and political allies is no secret: the nation&#x27;s vice president Hamzah Haz is one of them.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; reported that Hamzah described his relationship with Bashir and Laskar Jihad leader Jafar Umar Thalib as &quot;very close&quot;, but &quot;Time&quot; added, &quot;many see this relationship as a purely political ploy to woo Muslim voters ahead of the 2004 election.&quot; Hamzah, although he &quot;has a reputation as a wily politician&quot; nevertheless &quot;will be remembered for a particularly ill-judged speech before Muslim clerics at Abu Bakar&#x27;s Solo boarding school in May [2002]&quot;, the newsmagazine reported. During that visit Hamzah was also reported to have said, &quot;If they can prove there are terrorists here I&#x27;ll be the first to order an arrest&quot;, and then stepped down from the podium and kissed Abu Bakar on both cheeks.

In 2002, an Australian academic cited Hamzah as the &quot;best example&quot; of Islamic politicians in Indonesia &quot;prepared to play the extremist card to attract extra votes&quot;. Hamzah &quot;has supported Jemaah Islamiyah and has even been instrumental in having its members released from detention in the past&quot;, according to Tim Lindsey, director of the Asian Law Centre at the University of Melbourne. &quot;He has also openly accused the CIA and the United States of carrying out the Bali bombing.&quot;

===Denial of terrorists in the country===
In 2002 Hamzah gave an interview to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), which broadcast it on 23 October. In a voice-over played during the television interview, an ABC journalist said, &quot;Before the Bali bombing, Vice President Hamzah Haz insisted there were no terrorists in Indonesia. After the bombing, he gave this extraordinary justification for that position:&quot;

:Hamzah Haz press statement: &quot;If I as vice president said that Indonesia has terrorists, no one would come to Indonesia, no investors would come.&quot;

The ABC interviewer then told Hamzah: &quot;In light of Bali, that would seem a reprehensible comment, if you knew that people were here.&quot;

Hamzah responded: &quot;It&#x27;s not true that I protect them and I don&#x27;t regret what I said, but I said it in the past – it relates to the past. But now if there is a connection we want to know whether it is true that Indonesia has a terrorist network.&quot;

===Accusation of United States terrorism===
On 3 September 2003 Hamzah stated, &quot;Actually, who is the terrorist, who is against human rights? The answer is the United States because they attacked Iraq. Moreover, it is the terrorist king, waging war.&quot;

According to &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, Hamzah&#x27;s statement was &quot;a scathing attack that echoed the language of many of the Bali bombers&quot;. Hamzah had also been criticised for publicly associating with several of Indonesia&#x27;s more hardline Islamic leaders, including Ba&#x27;asyir, although after the Bali terrorist attack Hamzah severed those ties. Soon after Hamzah&#x27;s remarks, Riza Sihbudi, a political analyst at the Indonesian Institute of Sciences, told the Detik news service that Hamzah seemed to be chasing votes. &quot;He should not have spoken like that as he is the vice president&quot;, Sihbudi said.

Al Jazeera reported the day after Hamzah&#x27;s statement that &quot;There has yet to be a US reaction to the well-known firebrand&#x27;s comments.&quot;

==Personal life==
The Office of the Vice President officially states that Hamzah had two wives, Asmaniah (b. 27 July 1943), and Titin Kartini (b. 4 May 1945), with whom he had a total of 12 children. Another source states Haz had a third wife, Soraya, whom he did not officially acknowledge, and with whom he had a further three children. Soraya was seen on camera with Hamzah in an event at Bandar Lampung in 2022. His first and second wives predeceased him. Asmaniah died on 12 September 2017 and Titin died on 19 May 2021. 

Hamzah Haz&#x27;s son Nur Agus Haz, is a member of parliament for the United Development Party

He was a long-time cadre and senior figure of Nahdlatul Ulama, had served in various posts in the organization since he was a university student. He was disciple of Idham Chalid, a charismatic South Kalimantan Ulama and politician, and received political, religious, and spiritual training and guidance from him.

===Degree===
Sometimes known as Dr. Hamzah, he was reported to have obtained a PhD from American World University, an internet diploma mill (institution which improperly sells academic degrees), for US$1,200. Despite that, he used that title until his death unchallenged. 

===Death===
Hamzah died at the Tegalan Clinic, Matraman in East Jakarta, on 24 July 2024, at the age of 84. He was buried in a private family burial plot near the mosque he built at Cisarua, Bogor.

<doc id="1160179" wikidata="Q155335" url="?curid=1160179" title="Ray of Light">
<text>Ray of Light is the seventh studio album by American singer-songwriter Madonna, released in early 1998 by Maverick Records. A major stylistic and aesthetic departure from her previous work, &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot;, &quot;Ray of Light&quot; is an electronica and techno-pop record which incorporates multiple genres, including ambient, trip hop, psychedelic music and Middle Eastern music. Mystical themes are strongly present in the music and lyrics as a result of Madonna embracing Kabbalah, her study of Hinduism and Buddhism, and her daily practice of Ashtanga yoga.

After giving birth to her first child, Madonna started working on the album with producers Babyface and Patrick Leonard. Following failed sessions with them, Madonna pursued a new musical direction with English producer William Orbit, which resulted in a much more experimental sound. The recording process was the longest of Madonna&#x27;s career, and she experienced problems with Orbit&#x27;s hardware arrangement, which would break down and cause delays until it could be repaired.

&quot;Ray of Light&quot; was met with universal acclaim upon its release and is often considered Madonna&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot;. Critics praised the singer&#x27;s new musical direction, contemplative songwriting, and mature vocals, alongside Orbit&#x27;s complex, innovative production. The album has also been credited with introducing electronica into mainstream pop culture and affirming the 39-year-old Madonna&#x27;s relevance during a period of major teen-marketed artists. Retrospectively, the album has continued to receive acclaim and is considered one of the greatest pop albums of all time. Madonna has referred to it as her quintessential album. &quot;Ray of Light&quot; won four Grammy Awards from a total of six nominations at the 41st Annual Grammy Awards.

The album entered the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number two, with the biggest first-week sales by a female artist at the time. It also peaked at number one in 17 countries, including Australia, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain and on the United Kingdom Albums Chart, and charted within the top-five in most musical markets. Worldwide, &quot;Ray of Light&quot; has sold over 16 million copies and is one of the best-selling albums by women. Five singles were released from the album, including the international top five hits &quot;Frozen&quot; and &quot;Ray of Light&quot;. The album&#x27;s promotion was later supported by the Drowned World Tour in 2001.

== Background ==

Following the release of her compilation album &quot;Something to Remember&quot; (1995), Madonna started taking vocal lessons in preparation for her role as Eva Perón in &quot;Evita&quot; (1996). She would also give birth to her daughter, Lourdes Leon, later in 1996. These events inspired a period of introspection. &quot;That was a big catalyst for me. It took me on a search for answers to questions I&#x27;d never asked myself before&quot;, she said to &quot;Q&quot; magazine, in 2002. During the same period, she embraced Kabbalah and started studying Hinduism and yoga, all of which helped her &quot;step outside [myself] and see the world from a different perspective&quot;. Madonna felt that there was a &quot;whole piece&quot; of her voice left unused, which she decided to utilize for the album. By May 1997, Madonna had started writing songs for the album. She began collaborating with Babyface, who had first worked with her on her previous album &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot; (1994). The two wrote a couple of songs together before Madonna decided the collaborations were not going in the musical direction she wanted for the album. According to Babyface, the songs &quot;had a &#x27;Take a Bow-ish&#x27; kind of vibe, and Madonna didn&#x27;t want, or need, to repeat herself&quot;.

After abandoning the songs she had written with Babyface, Madonna turned to musician Rick Nowels, who had previously co-written songs with Stevie Nicks and Celine Dion. The collaboration produced seven songs in nine days, but those songs also did not display the album&#x27;s future electronic musical direction. Three of the songs, &quot;The Power of Good-Bye&quot;, &quot;To Have and Not to Hold&quot; and &quot;Little Star&quot;, appear on the album. Madonna then began writing songs with Patrick Leonard, who had produced many songs for Madonna in the late 1980s. Unlike her previous albums, Leonard&#x27;s songwriting collaborations were accompanied by very little studio input. Madonna believed that Leonard&#x27;s production &quot;would have lent the songs more of a Peter Gabriel vibe&quot;, a sound that she did not want for the album. Guy Oseary, chairman of Maverick Records, then phoned British electronic musician William Orbit, and suggested that he send some songs to Madonna. Orbit sent a 13-track digital audio tape to Madonna. &quot;I was a huge fan of William&#x27;s earlier records, &quot;Strange Cargo 1&quot; and &quot;2&quot; and all that. I also loved all the remixes he did for me and I was interested in fusing a kind of futuristic sound but also using lots of Indian and Moroccan influences and things like that, and I wanted it to sound old and new at the same time,&quot; Madonna said.

== Recording ==

In June 1997, William Orbit met Madonna at her house in New York, and she played him the music she had already worked on with other producers, which he felt sounded &quot;slick&quot;. Sessions with Orbit began soon afterwards at the Hit Factory, where Orbit then gave Madonna a tape of musical snippets he was working on, which were usually eight or sixteen-bar phrases and stripped-down versions of tracks that would later be heard on the album. Madonna listened to the samples, over and over again, until she was inspired to write lyrics. Once she had an idea about the lyrical direction of the song, she would take her ideas back to Orbit, and they would expand on the original music ideas. As most of the instrumental demos pre-existed, Madonna worked on the lyrics and melodies while at home or while travelling.

Recording sessions commenced at Larrabee North Studio in North Hollywood in the summer of 1997, where the album was predominantly recorded. For most of the recording process, only three other people were in the studio with Madonna: William Orbit, engineer Pat McCarthy, and his assistant engineer, Matt Silva. Sessions were initially plagued with machinery problems, as Orbit preferred to work with samples and synth sounds, and not with live musicians. The computers would break down, and recording would have to be delayed until they could be repaired. Orbit recorded the bulk of the album&#x27;s instrumentation over a four-month period. Orbit recalls playing the guitar until his fingers bled during the long hours he spent in the studio. Orbit also recalled during an interview with &quot;Q&quot; magazine that Madonna recorded &quot;Swim&quot; the day her friend and fashion designer Gianni Versace was killed in Miami, Florida. He also commented that this is probably why the track has an emotional impact.

After some errors in her pronunciation of Sanskrit shloka &quot;Yoga Taravali&quot; during the song &quot;Shanti/Ashtangi&quot;, the BBC arranged for Madonna to take telephonic lessons to learn the basic correct pronunciation of Sanskrit words from eminent scholar Vagish Shastri. She then made the necessary pronunciation corrections on the album. In a 1997 interview with Kurt Loder for MTV, Madonna discussed the impact of giving birth to her daughter Lourdes prior to the album, stating &quot;I think probably having her&#x27;s set me off on a new way of thinking and... just gone down a different road, period&quot;. Regarding the album&#x27;s creative direction, she stated &quot;It&#x27;s been really fun, I&#x27;ve never had so much fun really working on... never felt so free to experiment.&quot;

== Title and artwork ==
According to spokesperson Liz Rosenberg, Madonna considered titling the album &quot;Mantra&quot;, which she thought was a &quot;really cool title&quot;, and she also considered calling it &quot;Veronica Electronica&quot;; however, she discarded both of those ideas and called it &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, as her studio albums up to that point were always titled after one of the songs from each album&#x27;s tracklist. The artwork was taken from a November 28, 1997, photoshoot with Peruvian photographer Mario Testino. In terms of styling, Madonna and stylist Lori Goldstein opted for textures evocative of the elements water and air, which are recurrent themes on the album. For the album cover, Madonna wears a turquoise Dolce &amp; Gabbana Spring/Summer 1998 vinyl raincoat. Other pictures from the same shoot serve as the artworks for the &quot;Ray of Light&quot; and &quot;Frozen&quot; singles, where Madonna models items from Prada&#x27;s Spring/Summer 1998 collection. Madonna and Testino had previously collaborated for a Versace brand collection two years earlier. Madonna was impressed with the natural look Testino had captured, so she booked him again for the album&#x27;s photoshoot. He recalled, &quot;At 2pm she said, &#x27;OK, I&#x27;m tired. We&#x27;re done&#x27;. And I said, &#x27;But I don&#x27;t have the pictures yet&#x27;. She said, &#x27;You&#x27;re working for me and I say we&#x27;re done&#x27;. I said, &#x27;No, we carry on&#x27;. The picture she used on the cover came after that&quot;.

== Composition ==

&quot;Ray of Light&quot; was a notable departure from Madonna&#x27;s previous work, and has been described as her most &quot;adventurous&quot; record. An electronica, trip hop, techno-pop, and new-age album; it also contains elements of several different types of music, including house, ambient, drum and bass, rock, new wave, eastern and classical music. Vocally, the album was also a marked change from Madonna&#x27;s previous work; as the singer underwent vocal training lessons for her 1996 film &quot;Evita&quot;, her vocals exhibited greater breadth and range, as well as a fuller timbre. In many songs, she also abandoned the vibrato which was present in her previous work. Critically, the album is said to have Madonna&#x27;s most full-bodied vocals.

The opening track and third single, &quot;Drowned World/Substitute For Love&quot;, is a downtempo ballad drawing influences from jungle, drum and bass and trip hop music. The title is inspired by J. G. Ballard&#x27;s post-apocalyptic science fiction novel &quot;The Drowned World&quot; (1962). &quot;Swim&quot;, the second song, has a spiritual tone. She sings: &quot;Swim to the ocean floor/So that we can begin again/Wash away all our sins/Crash to the other shore&quot;. &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, the third track and second single, is an uptempo electronic dance-pop song with strong techno and trance influences. A &quot;sonically progressive&quot; track, it also incorporates elements of rock, with a prominent electric guitar riff. Its sound effects include whistles and bleeps. &quot;Candy Perfume Girl&quot; has a grunge intro and continues to pair post-modern beeps and beats with old-fashioned electric guitar flare ups. In the next song, &quot;Skin&quot;, Madonna sings &quot;Do I know you from somewhere?&quot; in a yearning voice over the beats of an electronic orchestra.

The sixth track, &quot;Nothing Really Matters&quot;, is an up-tempo dance track which contains influences of techno. &quot;Sky Fits Heaven&quot; focuses on Madonna&#x27;s spiritual studies and her daughter Lourdes. Some lyrics include: &quot;Sky fits heaven so fly it, that&#x27;s what the prophet said to me/Child fits mother so hold your baby tight, that&#x27;s what my future can see&quot;. Elements of the lyric are taken from the poem &quot;What Fits?&quot; by poet Max Blagg, the poem used for a 1993 advertisement for Gap Inc. &quot;Shanti/Ashtangi&quot; is a Hindu prayer and up-tempo techno song sung by Madonna in Sanskrit, over a driving dance rhythm. The techno dance track features Madonna singing the adapted version of Shankaracharya entirely in Sanskrit with lines such as &quot;Vunde gurunam caranaravinde/Sandarsita svatma sukhavabodhe&quot;.

&quot;Frozen&quot;, the ninth track and album&#x27;s first single, is a mid-tempo electronic ballad which has a layered sound enhanced by synthesizers and strings. The song additionally contains ambient qualities, a moderate dance rhythm during the chorus and techno-influenced beats towards the end. Madonna&#x27;s vocals throughout the song lack vibrato, and have drawn comparisons to medieval music. Lyrically, the song is about a cold and emotionless man; nevertheless, subtexts have been noticed. According to Jarman-Ivens, lyrics such as &quot;You&#x27;re frozen, when your heart&#x27;s not open&quot; reflected an artistic palette, &quot;encompassing diverse musical, textual and visual styles in its lyrics.&quot; &quot;The Power of Good-Bye&quot; is an emotional ballad which lyrically meditates on loss and longing. It was released as the album&#x27;s fourth single. &quot;To Have and Not to Hold&quot; is about a distant lover and &quot;Little Star&quot; is about her daughter, Lourdes. Both are superficially vibrant but with underlying subtlety and restrained arrangements prevailing. &quot;Mer Girl&quot;, the album&#x27;s final track, is a surreal meditation on mortality and the death of Madonna&#x27;s mother Madonna Fortin Ciccone, in which she sings, &quot;And I smelled her burning flesh/Her rotting bones, her decay/I ran and I ran/I&#x27;m still running away.&quot; &quot;She stepped out of the vocal booth,&quot; Orbit recalled of its recording, &quot;and everybody was rooted to the spot. It was just one of those moments. Really spooky.&quot;

== Release and promotion ==
&quot;Ray of Light&quot; was released in Japan on February 22, 1998, with an additional Japan-only bonus track &quot;Has to Be&quot;. The album was later released in the United States on March 3, 1998. In New Zealand, a box set of &quot;Ray of Light&quot; and the 1990 compilation &quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot; was released to accompany the album. It reached number 12 on the albums chart and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ) for shipment of 7,500 copies. A promotional instore VHS compilation titled &quot;Rays of Light&quot; was released in the United Kingdom in 1999, compiling all the music videos to all five singles from the album. All five videos were later included on the compilation &quot;The Video Collection 93:99&quot; (1999). &quot;Sky Fits Heaven&quot; was released as a promotional single in the United States. It peaked at number 41 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Play chart.

To promote the album, Madonna made a number of televised appearances and live performances of the album&#x27;s songs. On February 14, 1998, she debuted &quot;Sky Fits Heaven&quot;, &quot;Shanti/Ashtangi&quot; and &quot;Ray of Light&quot; at Roxy NYC nightclub. &quot;Frozen&quot; was performed on &quot;The National Lottery Show&quot; in the UK (February 21), 1998 Sanremo Music Festival in Italy (February 24), &quot;Wetten, dass..?&quot; in Germany (February 28) and &quot;The Rosie O&#x27;Donnell Show&quot; in the United States (March 13). On April 27, Madonna made an unannounced appearance at the Rock for the Rainforest benefit concert at Carnegie Hall in New York City to sing &quot;Frozen&quot;. She also joined the other stars of the concert, including Sting, Elton John, and Billy Joel to perform &quot;With a Little Help From My Friends&quot; and &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; with them. On May 29, Madonna appeared on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; and sang &quot;Little Star&quot; and &quot;Ray of Light&quot; there. On September 10, she opened 1998 MTV Video Music Awards in New York City with the performance of &quot;Shanti/Ashtangi&quot; and &quot;Ray of Light&quot; featuring Lenny Kravitz on guitar. &quot;The Power of Good-Bye&quot; was sung at the 1998 MTV Europe Music Awards in Italy (November 12) and &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; in the UK (November 19). On February 24, 1999, Madonna performed &quot;Nothing Really Matters&quot; at the 41st Grammy Awards ceremony at Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles.

Madonna performed &quot;Drowned World/Substitute For Love&quot;, &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, &quot;Candy Perfume Girl&quot;, &quot;Sky Fits Heaven&quot;, &quot;Frozen&quot; and &quot;Mer Girl&quot; on the Drowned World Tour, her fifth concert tour, which promoted &quot;Ray of Light&quot; and its successor album. It started in June 2001 and was Madonna&#x27;s first tour in eight years. The tour was to be started before the new millennium, but she had become pregnant with her son Rocco Ritchie, released the album &quot;Music&quot; that year, and married British filmmaker Guy Ritchie in December 2000. The show was divided into five sections, &quot;Cyber-Punk&quot;, &quot;Geisha&quot;, &quot;Cowgirl&quot;, &quot;Spanish&quot; and &quot;Ghetto&quot;. The Drowned World Tour received positive reviews. The tour was a commercial success, grossing a total of US$75 million, and it was the top concert tour of a solo artist in 2001. The concert was broadcast live on HBO from The Palace of Auburn Hills in Auburn Hills, Michigan, on August 26, 2001. The &quot;Drowned World Tour 2001&quot; DVD was released in all regions on November 13, 2001. Like the original airing of the show, the DVD received very good reviews. The photographs used on the DVD packaging were taken by Madonna&#x27;s friend Rosie O&#x27;Donnell.

== Singles ==

&quot;Frozen&quot; was released as the lead single from the album on February 23, 1998. It peaked inside the top five in most musical markets worldwide, while topping the singles chart in Finland, Italy, Spain and on the United Kingdom Singles Chart, where it became Madonna&#x27;s first single to debut at number one. It became her sixth single to peak at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, setting a record for Madonna as the artist with most number-two hits in the chart history. The song received critical acclaim, and was labelled a masterpiece whose sound was described as &quot;cinematic&quot;. However, the Belgian court in 2005 ruled that the opening four-bar theme to the song was plagiarized from the song &quot;Ma vie fout le camp&quot;, composed by Salvatore Acquaviva. The ruling forbade the sale of the single and the entire &quot;Ray of Light&quot; album, as well as other compilations that included the track in Belgium. In February 2014, a Belgian court ruled that Madonna did not plagiarize Acquaviva&#x27;s work for &quot;Frozen&quot;. The court spoke of a &quot;new capital offense&quot; in the file: composer Edouard Scotto Di Suoccio and societies Tabata Atoll Music and Music in Paris had also filed a complaint for plagiarism. According to them, both &quot;Ma vie fout le camp&quot; and &quot;Frozen&quot; originated in the song &quot;Blood Night&quot; which they composed in 1983. After all three tracks in the case were compared, the final ruling was that the songs were &quot;not sufficiently &#x27;original&#x27; to claim&quot; that any plagiarism had taken place. This ruling ended the eight-year ban of the song that was in place in Belgium since 2005.

The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, was released on April 27, 1998. It peaked at number one in Spain and attained the top five position in Canada, Finland, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States. It entered the Hot 100 at number five, becoming Madonna&#x27;s highest debut on the chart ever. The song was also a hit on Hot Dance Club Play chart, remaining at number one for four weeks, and became the &quot;Top Hot Dance Club Play Single&quot; of 1998. Critically, it also received positive reviews, being praised for its club-perfect, yet &quot;sonically progressive&quot; sound, as well as her powerful vocals.

&quot;Drowned World/Substitute for Love&quot; was released on August 24, 1998, as the third single outside the United States. It reached number one in Spain and the top ten in Italy and the United Kingdom. The music video, directed by Walter Stern, caused controversy due to scenes that featured Madonna being chased by paparazzi on motor-bikes, a scenario similar to Princess Diana&#x27;s death in 1997.

The fourth single, &quot;The Power of Good-Bye&quot;, was released on September 22, 1998. It reached the top-ten peaks in Austria, Canada, Netherlands, Finland, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom. In the United States, the song peaked at number eleven on the Hot 100. Its music video was directed by Matthew Rolston. &quot;Little Star&quot; was released as a double A-side single with &quot;The Power of Good-Bye&quot; in the United Kingdom on November 23, 1998. &quot;The Power of Good-Bye&quot; also charted at number 91 as a standalone single.

&quot;Nothing Really Matters&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s 
sixth and final single on March 2, 1999. It became a top-ten hit in Canada, Finland, Italy, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. In the United States, it became Madonna&#x27;s lowest-charting single on the Hot 100, peaking at number 93, but was a number-one hit on its dance chart. Its music video, directed by Johan Renck, was inspired by Arthur Golden&#x27;s book &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot;, and featured Madonna dressed as a geisha.

== Critical reception ==

&quot;Ray of Light&quot; received universal acclaim from critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic called it Madonna&#x27;s &quot;most adventurous record&quot; and &quot;most mature and restrained album&quot;. Paul Verna of &quot;Billboard&quot; commented: &quot;Easily her most mature and personal work to date, &quot;Ray of Light&quot; finds Madonna weaving lyrics with the painstaking intimacy of diary entries and wrapping them in hymn-like melodies and instrumentation swathed in lush, melancholy ambience—with forays into classic house, trance, and even guitar pop. Of course, she balances the set&#x27;s serious tone with chewy pop nuggets that allow her to flex her immeasurably widened vocal range to fine effect.&quot; He finished the review by calling the album &quot;a deliciously adventurous, ultimately victorious effort from one of pop music&#x27;s most compelling performers.&quot; Sal Cinquemani of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; described the album as &quot;one of the great pop masterpieces of the &#x27;90s&quot; and stated that: &quot;Its lyrics are uncomplicated but its statement is grand&quot; and &quot;Madonna hasn&#x27;t been this emotionally candid since &quot;Like a Prayer&quot;&quot;. Rob Sheffield&#x27;s review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the album &quot;brilliant&quot;, but was critical of Orbit&#x27;s production, saying that he doesn&#x27;t know enough tricks to produce a whole album, and so becomes repetitive. &quot;Until Simply Red enlist John Zorn, or Mariah Carey works with Tortoise,&quot; Stuart Maconie wrote in &quot;Q&quot;, &quot;she remains the only pop aristocrat who&#x27;s keeping her ears open.&quot;

David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote: &quot;For all her grapplings with self-enlightenment, Madonna seems more relaxed and less contrived than she&#x27;s been in years, from her new Italian earth-mother makeover to, especially, her music. &quot;Ray of Light&quot; is truly like a prayer, and you know she&#x27;ll take you there.&quot; Roni Sarig, in &quot;City Pages&quot;, was most impressed by Madonna&#x27;s vocal range, depth, and clarity and called &quot;Ray of Light&quot; &quot;her richest, most accomplished record yet&quot;. Robert Hilburn of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote: &quot;One reason why her new &quot;Ray of Light&quot; is the most satisfying album of her career is that it reflects the soul-searching of a woman who is at a point in her life where she can look at herself with surprising candor and perspective.&quot; In &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, Mark Roland drew comparisons with St Etienne and Björk&#x27;s &quot;Homogenic&quot; album, highlighting &quot;Ray of Light&quot;″s lack of cynicism as its most positive aspect: &quot;It&#x27;s not an album turned on the lathe of cynical pop manipulation, rather it&#x27;s been squished out of a lump of clay on a foot-powered wheel. Lovingly teased into life, &quot;Ray of Light&quot; is like the ugly mug that doesn&#x27;t match but is all the more special because of it.&quot; Joan Anderman from &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; said &quot;Ray of Light&quot; is a remarkable album. He described it as a deeply spiritual dance record, ecstatically textured, a serious cycle of songs that goes a long way toward liberating Madonna from a career built on scavenged images and cultivated identities. Robert Christgau was less impressed in &quot;Playboy&quot;, deeming it a &quot;great-&quot;sounding&quot;&quot; but average record because enlightenment themes always yield awkward results for pop entertainers. However, he praised sensual songs such as &quot;Skin&quot; and &quot;Candy Perfume Girl&quot;.

== Commercial performance ==

== Legacy ==
&quot;Ray of Light&quot; has been credited for bringing electronica music into global pop culture. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; noted that &quot;aside from occasional breakthroughs such as Fatboy Slim, electronica wasn&#x27;t totally mainstream fare when Madonna released &quot;Ray of Light&quot;.&quot; Until the album brought the genre to the top of music charts, according to author J. Randy Taraborrelli, &quot;techno and electronica had, for years, been the music played at so-called raves, hugely popular, illegal underground parties taking place in abandoned warehouse and deserted areas on the outskirts of town all around the world.&quot; AllMusic editor Liana Jonas stated that the album&#x27;s title track has &quot;brought mainstream attention to electronica music, which ascended from its underground status to wild popularity in the early 21st century.&quot; &quot;The Observer&quot;″s writer Daryl Deino called &quot;Ray of Light&quot; &quot;a risk-taking album that helped define mainstream electronic dance music.&quot;

Elliott H. Powell in an American Studies study for New York University observed that &quot;Ray of Light&quot; made South Asian culture accessible to the American public in the 1990s. Rhonda Hammer and Douglas Kellner in their book &quot;Media/Cultural Studies: Critical Approaches&quot; recalled that &quot;the phenomenon of South Asian-inspired femininity as a Western media trend can be traced to February 1998, when pop icon Madonna released her video &#x27;Frozen&#x27;.&quot; They explained that &quot;although Madonna did not initiate the fashion for Indian beauty accessories [...] she did propel it into the public eye by attracting the attention of the worldwide media.&quot;

According to Taraborrelli, the album has been hailed as bold and refreshing in music of the late 1990s, which was dominated by boybands and teenage artists such as the Backstreet Boys, NSYNC, Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. Larry Flick from &quot;Billboard&quot; said that the album &quot;not only provided the chameleon-like artist with her first universally applauded critical success, it has also proved that she remains a vital figure amongst woefully fickle young audiences.&quot; Music critic Lucy O&#x27;Brien commented: &quot;1998&#x27;s &quot;Ray of Light&quot; certainly rehabilitated Madonna&#x27;s image. Up to that point she had still been written off as an average pop glamour girl who got lucky, but with this record she reached a whole new audience, proving that she was a good songwriter with an intensely productive talent.&quot; Mary von Aue from &quot;Stereogum&quot; stated that &quot;&quot;Ray of Light&quot; reestablished Madonna as a groundbreaking artist.&quot;

&quot;Ray of Light&quot; has been featured on numerous critics&#x27; lists of greatest albums of all time. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine placed the album at number 367 on the list of 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. In September 2020, an updated edition of the Rolling Stone list was published, showing the album rising 145 spots, at number 222. In 2001, a quarter of a million music fans on VH1 voted &quot;Ray of Light&quot; as the 10th of &quot;100 Best Albums of All Time&quot;. In 2003, &quot;Ray of Light&quot; was allocated at number 17 on &quot;Q&quot; magazine readers&#x27; list of &quot;100 Greatest Albums Ever&quot;. The album is also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine also listed &quot;Ray of Light&quot; at number 29 on &quot;100 Modern Classics: The Greatest Albums of Our Lifetime&quot;. In 2013, the album was also included at number 241 on &quot;NME&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked &quot;Ray of Light&quot; as the 55th best album of the 1990s, &quot;Madonna&#x27;s trying, with all her might, to evoke the blackest depths and most euphoric joys of the human heart. The album&#x27;s title track sounds like it was forged inside a meteor; the surreal, pitch-black poem &#x27;Mer Girl&#x27; is as still as death itself.&quot;

&quot;Ray of Light&quot; has also been influential on other artists&#x27; work. Canadian singer Nelly Furtado stated that she used it as a template for her album &quot;Loose&quot; (2006). Moreover, English singer Adele named the record as &quot;one of the chief inspirations&quot; for her third studio album, &quot;25&quot; (2015). Madonna herself has considered &quot;Ray of Light&quot; the most fulfilling evolution of her career, with her referencing it as the &quot;quintessential Madonna album&quot; in a 2013 Reddit AMA.

<doc id="1160186" wikidata="Q404213" url="?curid=1160186" title="Aryabhata II">
<text>Āryabhaṭa (c. 920 – c. 1000) also known as Arya Diya Jankhi was an Indian mathematician and astronomer, and the author of the &quot;Maha-Siddhanta&quot;. The numeral II is given to him to distinguish him from the earlier and more influential Āryabhaṭa I. Scholars are unsure of when exactly he was born, though David Pingree dates of his main publications between 950–1100. The manuscripts of his &quot;Maha-Siddhanta&quot; have been discovered from Gujarat, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Bengal, so he probably lived in northern India.

==Maha Siddhanta==

Aryabhata wrote &quot;Maha-Siddhanta&quot;, also known as &quot;Arya-siddhanta&quot;, Sanskrit language work containing 18 chapters. It summarizes a lost work attributed to Parashara, and is probably based on Shridhara&#x27;s work.

The initial twelve chapters deal with topics related to mathematical astronomy and cover the topics that Indian mathematicians of that period had already worked on. The various topics that have been included in these twelve chapters are: the longitudes of the planets, lunar and solar eclipses, the estimation of eclipses, the lunar crescent, the rising and setting of the planets, association of the planets with each other and with the stars.

The next six chapters of the book includes topics such as geometry, geography and algebra, which were applied to calculate the longitudes of the planets. In about twenty verses in the treatise, he gives elaborate rules to solve the indeterminate equation: by = ax + c. These rules have been applied to a number of different cases such as when c has a positive value, when c has a negative value, when the number of the quotients is an even number, when this number of quotients is an odd number, etc.

==Other contributions to maths==
Aryabhata II also deduced a method to calculate the cube root of a number, but his method was already given by Aryabhata I, many years earlier. Indian mathematicians were very keen to give the correct sine tables since they played a vital role to calculate the planetary positions as accurately as possible. Aryabhata II played a vital role in it by constructing a sine table, which was accurate up to five decimal places.

<doc id="1160191" wikidata="Q1674580" url="?curid=1160191" title="Long-term care insurance">
<text>Long-term care insurance (LTC or LTCI) is an insurance product, sold in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada that helps pay for the costs associated with long-term care. Long-term care insurance covers care generally not covered by health insurance, Medicare, or Medicaid.

Individuals who require long-term care are generally not sick in the traditional sense but are unable to perform two of the six activities of daily living (ADLs) such as dressing, bathing, eating, toileting, continence, transferring (getting in and out of a bed or chair), and walking.

Age is not a determining factor in needing long-term care. About 70 percent of individuals over 65 will require at least some type of long-term care services during their lifetime. About 40% of those receiving long-term care today are between 18 and 64. Once a change of health occurs, long-term care insurance may not be available. Early onset (before 65) Alzheimer&#x27;s and Parkinson&#x27;s disease occur rarely.

Long-term care is an issue because people are living longer. As people age, many times they need help with everyday activities of daily living or require supervision due to severe cognitive impairment. That impacts women even more since they often live longer than men and, by default, become caregivers to others.

==Benefits==

Long-term care insurance can cover home care, assisted living, adult daycare, respite care, hospice care, nursing home, Alzheimer&#x27;s facilities, and home modification to accommodate disabilities. If home care coverage is purchased, long-term care insurance can pay for home care, often from the first day it is needed. It will pay for a visiting or live-in caregiver, companion, housekeeper, therapist or private duty nurse up to seven days a week, 24 hours a day up to the policy benefit maximum. Many experts suggest shopping between the ages of 45 and 55 as part of an overall retirement plan to protect assets from the high costs and burdens of extended health care.

Other benefits of long-term care insurance:

* Many individuals may feel uncomfortable relying on their children or family members for support, and find that long-term care insurance could help cover out-of-pocket expenses. Without long-term care insurance, the cost of providing these services may quickly deplete the savings of the individual and/or their family. The costs of long-term care differ by region. The U.S. government has an interactive map to estimate the costs by state.
* Premiums paid on a long-term care insurance product may be eligible for an income tax deduction. The amount of the deduction depends on the age of the covered person. Benefits paid from a long-term care contract are generally excluded from income. Some states also have deductions or credits and proceeds are always tax-free.
* Business deductions of premiums are determined by the type of business. Generally corporations paying premiums for an employee are 100% deductible if not included in employee&#x27;s taxable income.

In the United States, Medicaid will provide long-term care services for the poor or those who spend-down or and exhaust their assets. In most states, you must spend down to $2000. If there is a living spouse/partner they may keep an additional amount.

A welfare program, Medicaid does provide medically necessary services for people with limited resources who &quot;need nursing home care but can stay at home with special community care services.&quot;
However, Medicaid generally does not cover long-term care provided in a home setting unless there is a state specific waiver program. In most states Medicaid does not pay for Assisted Living. People who need long-term care often prefer to age in place in their own home or in a private room in an assisted living facility if medically necessary.

==Types of policies==

Private long-term care (LTC) insurance is growing in popularity in the United States. Premiums, however, have risen dramatically in recent years even for existing policyholders. Coverage costs can be expensive, when consumers wait until retirement age to purchase LTC coverage.

As they relate to U.S. policies, two types of long-term care policies offered are:

* Traditional policies are the most common policies offered. Traditional policy premiums, like automobile insurance premiums, are paid on a continual basis. If unused, no premiums are returned. However, if the policy has a &quot;return of premium&quot; rider, a death benefit will be paid to a beneficiary if the insured dies at a time when benefits received under the policy are less than the premiums paid to the insurer. The amount of the benefit is equal to the excess of premiums paid over benefits received.
* Combination or hybrid policies are a combination of life insurance or an annuity with long-term care insurance. Several varieties of these combinations exist.

As they relate to U.S. income tax, two types of long-term care policies offered are:

* Tax qualified (TQ) policies are the most common policies offered. A TQ policy requires that a person 1) be expected to require care for at least 90 days, and be unable to perform 2 or more activities of daily living (eating, dressing, bathing, transferring, toileting, ) without substantial assistance (hands-on or standby); or 2) for at least 90 days, need substantial assistance due to a severe cognitive impairment. In either case, a doctor must provide a plan of care. Benefits from a TQ policy are non-taxable.
* Non-tax qualified (NTQ) was formerly called traditional long-term care insurance. It often includes a &quot;trigger&quot; called a &quot;medical necessity&quot; trigger. This means that the patient&#x27;s own doctor, or that doctor in conjunction with someone from the insurance company, can state that the patient needs care for any medical reason and the policy will pay. NTQ policies include walking as an activity of daily living and usually only require the inability to perform 1 or more activity of daily living. The Treasury Department has not clarified the status of benefits received under a non-qualified long-term care insurance plan. Therefore, the taxability of these benefits is open to further interpretation. This means that it is possible that individuals who receive benefits under a non-qualified long-term care insurance policy risk facing a large tax bill for these benefits.

Fewer non-tax qualified policies are available for sale. One reason is that consumers want to be eligible for the tax deductions available when buying a tax-qualified policy. The tax issues can be more complex than the issue of deductions alone, and it is advisable to seek good counsel on all the pros and cons of a tax-qualified policy versus a non-tax-qualified policy, since the benefit triggers on a good non-tax-qualified policy are better. By law, tax-qualified policies carry restrictions on when the policy holder can receive benefits. One survey found that sixty-five percent of purchasers did not know whether or not the policy they bought was tax qualified.

Once a person purchases a policy, the language cannot be changed by the insurance company, and the policy usually is guaranteed renewable for life. It can never be canceled by the insurance company for health reasons, but can be canceled for non-payment.

Most benefits are paid on a reimbursement basis and a few companies offer indemnity-based per-diem benefits at a higher rate. Most policies cover care only in the continental United States. Policies that cover care in select foreign countries usually only cover nursing care and do so at a rated benefit.

Group policies may have provisions for non-restricted or open enrollment periods and underwriting may be required. Group plans may or may not be guaranteed renewable or tax qualified. Some group plans include language allowing the insurance company to replace the policy with a similar policy and to change the premiums at that time. Some group plans can be canceled by the insurance company. To compensate for the higher insurance risk group plans may have higher deductibles and lower benefits than individual plans. Some group plans have a 3 ADL (activities of daily living) requirement for nursing care.

The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) provides certain former employees, retirees, spouses, former spouses, and dependent children the right to temporary continuation of health coverage at group rates.

Retirement systems such as CalPERS may offer long-term care insurance similar to a group plan. These organizations are not regulated by the state insurance departments. They can increase rates and make changes to policies without state scrutiny and approval.

Long-term care insurance rates are determined by six main factors: the person&#x27;s age, the daily (or monthly) benefit, how long the benefits pay, the elimination period, inflation protection, and the health rating (preferred, standard, sub-standard). Most companies will offer couples and multi-life discounts on individual policies. Some companies define &quot;couples&quot; not only to spouses, but also to two people who meet criteria for living together in a committed relationship and sharing basic living expenses. The average age of purchasers has dropped from 68 years in 1990 to 61 years in 2005, and the number of purchasers who are under age 65 has increased significantly.

Most companies offer multiple premium payment modes: annual, semi-annual, quarterly, and monthly. Companies may add a percentage for more frequent payment than annual. Options such as spousal survivorship, non-forfeiture, restoration of benefits and return of premium are available with most plans.

The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 makes Partnership plans available to all states. Partnership provides &quot;lifetime asset protection&quot; from the Medicaid spend-down requirement. As of March 2014, 41 states had active Long Term Care Insurance Partnership programs.

==Benefit eligibility and deductibles==

Most policies pay benefits when the policyholder needs help with two or more of six ADLs or when a cognitive impairment is present. According to the US Department of Health and Human Services all tax-qualified long-term care insurance plans have the same trigger.

Most policies have an elimination period or waiting period similar to a deductible. This is the period of time that you pay for care before your benefits are paid. Elimination days may be from 30 to 120 days after a long-term care incident, such as a fall or illness. Some policies require intended claimants to provide proof of 30 to 120 service days of paid care before any benefits will be paid. In some cases, the option may be available to select zero elimination days when covered services are provided in the home in accordance with a Plan of Care. A policyholder can select a maximum daily or monthly benefit. This is the maximum the insurance company will pay toward care on either a daily or monthly basis 

== Comparisons ==

=== Canada ===

LTC Insurance riders generally available in Canadian policies include:

* ROPD – Return of premium on death. Your premiums are returned to your estate.
* Protection from inflation – Policy benefit grows at a set rate of return.

=== Germany ===

In Germany there are two different kinds of care insurance: mandatory care insurance and voluntary, private care insurance. The German laws oblige the people to have a basic care insurance. It is one of five mandatory insurances, the others are health, accident, unemployment and pension insurance. As usual in the German public insurance system costs are evenly split between employers and employees.

There are three types of private care insurance:

* The most expensive form of private care insurance is like a life insurance. It pays you a monthly pension when the insured needs to be taken care of, no matter what the care actually costs. When making the contract you can choose how much the insurance pays each month, depending on the care level.

* Another form of private care insurance pays a certain percentage of the actual cost after the mandatory care insurance has paid. Here you can decide on the percentage that is being paid, depending on the care level. The advantage of this type of insurance is that it pays more money when the care costs more, so the risk of raised prices is lower for the insured.

* The most common type of private care insurance pays a certain amount of money for each day where the insured is being taken care of.
=== United States ===

Some 7 million individuals have some form of long-term care insurance. The vast majority have what is referred to as traditional, or health-based, LTC insurance. The opposite is true for new policy sales. Some 350,000 new policies are sold each year with 84 percent being linked-benefit or life insurance policies that include an LTC benefit.

In the U.S., the nation&#x27;s long-term care insurance companies paid out a record $11 billion in claims in 2019 to some 310,000 policyholders.

A new study projects that the lifetime chance of long-term care insurance policy usage. Someone purchasing coverage at age 65 has a 50% likelihood of using their policy benefits, especially when there is no elimination period for home care benefits.

<text>Śrīpati ( – 1066), also transliterated as Shri-pati, was an Indian astronomer, astrologer and mathematician. His major works include &quot;Dhīkotida-karana&quot; (1039), a work of twenty verses on solar and lunar eclipses; &quot;Dhruva-mānasa&quot; (written in 1056), a work of 105 verses on calculating planetary longitudes, eclipses and planetary transits; &quot;Siddhānta-śekhara&quot; a major work on astronomy in 19 chapters; and &quot;Gaṇita-tilaka&quot;, an incomplete arithmetical treatise in 125 verses based on a work by Shridhara.

== Biography ==

Śrīpati was born in Rohinikhand in present-day Maharashtra, and lived during (–1066. His father was Naga-deva (sometimes written as Namadeva) and his grandfather was Kesava.

Śrīpati followed the teachings of Lalla, and wrote on astrology, astronomy and mathematics. He was mainly focused on astrology, and his work on astronomy was aimed at supporting his research on astrology; his work on mathematics, in turn, was aimed at supporting his work on astronomy, such as the study of spheres.

Śrīpati had introduced one of the main methods of house division in Jyotiṣa, known as Śrīpati Bhāva system.

== Works ==

=== &quot;Dhīkotida-karana&quot; ===

&quot;Dhīkotida-karana&quot; (1039) is 20-verse text that discusses solar and lunar eclipses.

Commentaries on this text include:

* An &quot;udaharana&quot; (1610) by Ramakrishna Bhatta
* A &quot;tippana&quot; by Dinakara, known from a manuscript copied in 1823

=== &quot;Dhruva-mānasa&quot; ===

&quot;Dhruva-mānasa&quot; (1056) is a 105-verse text on calculating planetary longitudes, eclipses and planetary transits.

=== &quot;Siddhānta-śekhara&quot; ===

&quot;Siddhānta-śekhara&quot; (&quot;Siddhanta-shekhara&quot;) is a major work on astronomy in 19 chapters. Some of the notable chapters include:

* Chapter 13: Arithmetic; comprises 55 verses on arithmetic, Measurement, and shadow reckoning.
* Chapter 14: Algebra
** discusses various rules of algebra without proof, in verbal form (without algebraic symbols)
** Contains rules of signs for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square, square root, cube and cube root of positive and negative quantities
** Contains the rule for solving a quadratic equation
* Chapter 15: Sphere

The work also contains the rules for the solution of simultaneous indeterminate equations of the first degree; these rules are similar to those given by Brahmagupta.

=== &quot;Gaṇita-tilaka&quot; ===

&quot;Gaṇita-tilaka&quot; is an incomplete, 125-verse treatise on arithmetics, based on a work by Shridhara. Its lost portion possibly consisted of the verses 19-55 of Chapter 13 of &quot;Siddhānta-śekhara&quot;.

=== &quot;Jyotiṣa-ratna-mālā&quot; ===

&quot;Jyotiṣa-ratna-mālā&quot; (&quot;Jyotisha-ratna-mala&quot;) is a 20-chapter text on astrology, based on the &quot;Jyotisha-ratna-kosha&quot; of Lalla. Śrīpati wrote a commentary on this work in Marathi language: this is one of the oldest surviving Marathi-language works.

Commentaries on this text include:

* &quot;Balavaodha&quot; by Damodara Pandita
* &quot;Bala-bodhini&quot; by Parama-Karunika
* &quot;Bala-bodhini&quot;, a Rajasthani language &quot;tika&quot;, by Rayasimha or Rai Singh (–1610), the ruler of Bikaner; the author may be same as Parama-Karunika
* &quot;Bala-bodhini&quot; by Vaidyanatha Pandita alias Vaija-pandita, known from several manuscripts, the earliest of which is dated 1493

* A &quot;tika&quot; by Umapati
* A &quot;tika&quot; by Rama-sharman
* A &quot;tika&quot; or &quot;vivarana&quot; by Chaturbhuja Mishra, known from two manuscripts, the earliest of which is dated 1793
* A commentary by Mahadeva (fl. 1263), the nephew of Amaraja of Anandapura
* A &quot;didhiti&quot; by Indradattopadhyaya or Indradatta Upadhyaya

=== &quot;Jātaka-paddhati&quot; ===

&quot;Jātaka-paddhati&quot;, also known as &quot;Śrīpati-paddhatiḥ&quot; (&quot;Shripati-paddhati&quot;), is an 8-chapter text on astrology.

According to David Pingree, the text is &quot;one of the fundamental textbooks for later Indian genethlialogy, contributing an impressive elaboration to the computation of the strengths of the planets and astrological places. It was enormously popular, as the large number of manuscripts, commentaries, and imitations attests.&quot;

Commentaries on this text include:

* A &quot;tika&quot; on &quot;Jataka-karma-paddhati&quot; by Raghunatha
* A &quot;tika&quot; by Devidasa (fl. 1600–1625) of Kanyakubja
* &quot;Bhavartha-manjari&quot; by Achyuta (fl. 1505–1534)
* &quot;Hora-tantram Praibhasha&quot;, a Malayalam-language commentary

Achyutha Pisharadi wrote &quot;Hora-sarochchaya&quot;, a 7-chapter adaptation of &quot;Jātaka-paddhati&quot;.

=== Other ===

&quot;Daivajña-vallabha&quot;, a work on astrology, concludes with excerpts from several works of Varaha-mihira. Some writers attribute this work to Varaha-mihira, but according to David Pingree, it is more likely to be Śrīpati&#x27;s work. Narayana (Narayana Pandita?) wrote &quot;Subodhini&quot;, a Hindi-language version of &quot;Daivajña-vallabha&quot; (1905).

The &quot;Manasagari&quot; or &quot;Janma-patrika-paddhati&quot; attributed to Kalyana Rishi (fl. after 1629) includes extensive quotations and adaptations of content from Śrīpati&#x27;s &quot;Ratnamala&quot; and &quot;Shripati-paddhati.&quot; also he had given the most useful method of division

The name Helluland was given by Leif Erikson during his voyage to Vinland according to the Greenland Saga and means &quot;Land of Flat Rocks/Stones&quot; in Old Norse.

== According to the sagas==
Helluland was said to be the first of three lands in North America visited by Eriksson. He decided against trying to settle there because he found the land inhospitable. He continued south to &quot;Markland&quot; (probably Labrador) and &quot;Vinland&quot; (possibly Newfoundland).

The Saga of Erik the Red, 1880 translation into English by J. Sephton from the original Icelandic &#x27;Eiríks saga rauða&#x27;.
&quot;They sailed away from land; then to the Vestribygd and to Bjarneyjar (the Bear Islands). Thence they sailed away from Bjarneyjar with northerly winds. They were out at sea two half-days. Then they came to land, and rowed along it in boats, and explored it, and found there flat stones, many and so great that two men might well lie on them stretched on their backs with heel to heel. Polar-foxes were there in abundance. This land they gave name to, and called it Helluland (stone-land).&quot;

In the Saga of Halfdan Eysteinsson (Hálfdanar saga Eysteinssonar), written no earlier than the mid-14th century a fragment says:

&quot;Ragnar brought Helluland&#x27;s obygdir under his sway and destroyed all the giants there...&quot;

Written in the last half of the 13th century an anonymous Icelandic &quot;fornaldarsaga&quot;, describes the attempts of Örvar-Oddr and his son Vignor to track down an enemy named Ogmund:

&quot;I will tell you where Ogmund has gone. He has gone into the Skuggifjord (Hudson Strait), it is in Helluland&#x27;s Obygdir (uninhabited regions)... he has gone there because he wishes to escape you. But now you may track him to his house if you wish and see what comes of it.&quot;

&quot;Thereupon he (and his son Vignor in separate ships) sailed until they came into the Greenland Sea (which lay between Iceland and Greenland) when they turned south and sailed around the land and to the west... They sailed then until they came to Helluland and laid their course into the Skuggifjord...&quot;

&quot;When they reached the land (which they were seeking in the Skuggifjord) father and son went ashore and walked until they saw a fortified structure very strongly built...&quot;

===In ancient Icelandic scholarship===
According to a footnote in Arthur Middleton Reeves&#x27; &quot;The Norse Discovery of America&quot; (1906), &quot;the whole of the northern coast of America, west of Greenland, was called by the ancient Icelandic geographers Helluland it Mikla, or Great Helluland; and the island of Newfoundland simply Helluland, or Litla Helluland.&quot;

===Current scholarly opinion===

The Icelandic &quot;Saga of Erik the Red&quot; and the &quot;Greenland Saga&quot; characterized Helluland as a land of flat stones (Old Norse: &quot;hella&quot;). Most scholars agree that Helluland corresponds to Baffin Island in the present-day Canadian territory of Nunavut.

From the testimony of the sagas, the Norse explorers probably made contact with the native Dorset culture of the region, people whom the sagas term &quot;skrælings&quot;. Historians suggest the contact had no major cultural ramifications for either side.

Patricia Sutherland, of the Canadian Museum of Civilization, found in the museum&#x27;s collections yarn collected in archaeological digs on Baffin Island that corresponded to that found in Norse settlements in Greenland, which led her to explore in depth the potential that the Norse had settled on Baffin Island. Over a number of years searching in collections and digging at sites such as Tanfield Valley, she found numerous artifacts, such as tally sticks, signs of iron and bronze metallurgy and whetstones used for sharpening metal tools, and European-style masonry and turf construction, which indicated to her that the Vikings had been on Baffin for an extended period and likely had an established trading relationship with the Dorset natives in the area.

Sutherland&#x27;s new findings further strengthen the case for a Viking camp on Baffin Island. &quot;While her evidence was compelling before, I find it convincing now,&quot; said James Tuck, professor emeritus of archaeology, ... at Memorial University.&quot; 
Sutherland and the Helluland Archaeology Project among others have identified several potential pre-Columbian European archaeological sites including Tanfield Valley, Avayalik at the far north of the Labrador Peninsula, Willows Island at the southern part of Baffin Island, Pond Inlet (Nunguvik) in the far north of Baffin Island. When Sutherland was asked if she might have been fired from the Canadian Museum of Civilization, now the Canadian Museum of History, because her research was out of step with government views of Canadian history, Sutherland agreed.

Sir Wilfred Grenfell, a medical missionary and scholar living in Newfoundland and Labrador in the early 20th century wrote in his work &quot;The Romance of Labrador&quot; that Helluland likely corresponds to Kangalaksiorvik Bay, a fiord around 100 miles (161 km) south of the Torngat Mountains. He described its south side as home to &quot;endless acres of flat stones&quot;, south of which lie the wooded Markland and, further south, Vinland the Good.

In 2018, Michele Hayeur Smith of Brown University, who specializes in the study of ancient textiles, wrote that she does not think the ancient Arctic people, the Dorset and Thule, needed to be taught how to spin yarn: &quot;It&#x27;s a pretty intuitive thing to do.&quot; Journal of Archaeological Science, August 2018:&quot;. . . the date received on Sample 4440b from Nanook clearly indicates that sinew was being spun and plied at least as early, if not earlier, than yarn at this site. We feel that the most parsimonious explanation of this data is that the practice of spinning hair and wool into plied yarn most likely developed naturally within this context of complex, indigenous, Arctic fiber technologies, and not through contact with European textile producers. [. . .] Our investigations indicate that Paleoeskimo (Dorset) communities on Baffin Island spun threads from the hair and also from the sinews of native terrestrial grazing animals, most likely musk ox and arctic hare, throughout the Middle Dorset period and for at least a millennium before there is any reasonable evidence of European activity in the islands of the North Atlantic or in the North American Arctic.&quot;

William W. Fitzhugh, Director of the Arctic Studies Center at the Smithsonian Institution, and a Senior Scientist at the National Museum of Natural History, wrote that there is insufficient published evidence to support Sutherland&#x27;s claims, and that the Dorset were using spun cordage by the 6th century. In 1992, Elizabeth Wayland Barber wrote that a piece of three-ply yarn that dates to the Paleolithic era, that ended about 10,000 BP, was found at the Lascaux caves in France. This yarn consisted of three s-twist strands that were z-plied, much like the way a three-ply yarn is made now, whereas the Baffin Island yarn was a simple two-ply yarn. The eight sod buildings and artifacts found in the 1960s at L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows, located on the northern tip of Newfoundland, remains the only confirmed Norse site in North America outside of those found in Greenland.

<doc id="1160209" wikidata="Q7228837" url="?curid=1160209" title="Poor man's copyright">
<text>Poor man&#x27;s copyright is a method of using registered dating by the postal service, a notary public or other highly trusted source to date intellectual property, thereby helping to establish that the material has been in one&#x27;s possession since a particular time. The concept is based on the notion that, in the event that such intellectual property were to be misused by a third party, the poor-man&#x27;s copyright would at least establish a legally recognized date of possession before any proof which a third party may possess.

In countries with no central copyright registration authority, it can be difficult for an author to prove when their work was created. The United Kingdom Patent Office says this:

... a copy could be deposited with a bank or solicitor. Alternatively, a creator could send himself or herself a copy by special delivery post (which gives a clear date stamp on the envelope), leaving the envelope unopened on its return. A number of private companies operate unofficial registers, but it would be sensible to check carefully what you will be paying for before choosing this route.

This does not prove that a work is original or created by you...
There is no provision in United States copyright law regarding any such type of protection. A work of original authorship is protected by United States copyright law once it is fixed in a tangible medium of expression. According to section 412 of the U.S. Copyright Act of 1976 (17 U.S.C. 408), registration of a work with the Copyright Office is a prerequisite for copyright protection. Poor man&#x27;s copyright is therefore not a substitute for registration. Eric Goldman has noted that there is an absence of cases that give any value to the poor man&#x27;s copyright. He also states, &quot;To establish copyright infringement, the author must show copying-in-fact and wrongful copying. The postmark has no relevance to the wrongful copying question.&quot; However, according to the Copyright Alliance, the postmark could provide some value in an infringement action if it is used as evidence that the work existed on a particular date, or before the date of creation of another work.

<text>Jen Oldershaw began as a presenter on Triple J, presenting music shifts. She presented the Morning Show in 1996 and 1997 and Breakfast with Mikey Robins and the Sandman in 1998 before becoming the producer of Merrick and Rosso&#x27;s drivetime radio show on Triple J during 1999 and 2000.

When Merrick &amp; Rosso left Triple J, moving to the Sydney commercial radio station Nova 96.9, Jen went with them continuing as their producer until she left in 2002. She can be heard on Merrick &amp; Rosso&#x27;s CD &quot;Choice Cuts&quot;.

Since 2001 she has done retail and corporate voiceover work for 10 years was the continuity voice of for ABC TV. She can still be heard on the warnings at the beginning of ABC TV programs.

From 2003 she worked at The Australian Film Television and Radio School as a lecturer and travelled the country running courses teaching radio skills.

In late 2005 she returned to radio and until recently was heard 12pm - 3pm weekdays on the new commercial radio station Vega 95.3 in Sydney. At the end of 2008, Oldershaw resigned from Vega 95.3 to return to lecturing at the Australian Film Television and Radio School.

<doc id="1160218" wikidata="Q384028" url="?curid=1160218" title="Capocollo">
<text>Capocollo () or coppa () is an Italian and French (Corsica) pork &quot;salume&quot; made from the dry-cured muscle running from the neck to the fourth or fifth rib of the pork shoulder or neck. It is a whole-muscle &quot;salume&quot;, dry cured, and typically sliced very thinly. It is similar to the more widely known cured ham or prosciutto, because they are both pork-derived cold cuts used in similar dishes. It is not brined as ham or prosciutto typically is.

==Etymology==
This cut is typically called or in much of Italy, Corsica, and southern Switzerland (Ticino and the Grisons). This name is a compound of the words (&#x27;head&#x27;) and (&#x27;neck&#x27;). Regional terms include (Campania and Calabria) and (Corsica).

Outside of Europe, terms include &quot;bondiola&quot; or in Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay, and &quot;capicola&quot; or &quot;capicolla&quot; in North America. The pronunciation &quot;gabagool&quot; has been used by some Italian Americans in the New York City area and elsewhere in the Northeast US, based on the Neapolitan language word ( /kapəˈkwol.lə/) in working-class strata of 19th- and early 20th-century immigrants. It was notably used in the television series &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, and its use has become a well-known stereotype.

==Manufacture and use==

In its production, &quot;capocollo&quot; is first lightly seasoned often with red wine and sometimes white wine, garlic, and a variety of herbs and spices that differs depending on region. The meat is then salted (and was traditionally massaged), stuffed into a natural casing, and hung for up to six months to cure. Sometimes the exterior is rubbed with hot paprika before being hung and cured. &quot;Capocollo&quot; is essentially the pork counterpart of the air-dried, cured beef bresaola. It is widely available wherever significant Italian communities occur, due to commercially produced varieties. The slow-roasted Piedmontese version is called &quot;coppa cotta&quot;.

&quot;Capocollo&quot; is esteemed for its delicate flavour and tender, fatty texture, and is often more expensive than most other &quot;salumi&quot;. In many countries, it is sold as a gourmet food item. It is usually sliced thin for use in antipasti or sandwiches such as panini and muffulettas, as well as some traditional Italian pizzas.

==Varieties and official status==
Four particular varieties, &quot;coppa piacentina&quot;, &quot;capocollo di Calabria&quot; from Italy, and &quot;Coppa de Corse&quot; from France and &quot;Capocollo di Martina Franca&quot; (traditional &quot;capocollo&quot; of Apulia. It is smoked with laurel leaves, thyme, almonds, Mediterranean herbs, and pieces of bark of Macedonian oak (called &quot;fragno&quot; in Italian), a tree typical of southeastern Italy, the Balkans, and Western Turkey. Usually it is served with figs or burrata;) have protected designation of origin and PGI (&quot;Capocollo di Martina Franca)&quot; status under the Common Agricultural Policy of European Union law, which ensures that only products genuinely originating in those regions are allowed in commerce as such.

Four additional Italian regions produce &quot;capocollo&quot;, and are not covered under European law, but are designated as (PAT) by the Italian Ministry of Agricultural, Food, and Forestry Policies:

* &quot;Capocollo della Basilicata&quot;;
* &quot;Capocollo del Lazio&quot;;
*&quot; Capocollo tipico senese &quot;or &quot;finocchiata&quot;, from Tuscany;
* &quot;Capocollo dell&#x27;Umbria&quot;.

Outside Europe, &quot;capocollo&quot; was introduced to Argentina by Italian immigrants, under the names &quot;bondiola&quot; or &quot;bondiola curada&quot;.

<text>The Reform Party of Alberta is a defunct provincial political party in Alberta, Canada, that was registered with Elections Alberta. Its leader was David Salmon.

==Early history==

The party was registered by members of the former Reform Party of Canada on August 24, 1989 not to contest general elections, but to contest elections held by the Government of Alberta to select nominees for the Senate of Canada, a body that is appointed by the Governor General of Canada on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.

The party contested Senate nominee elections, the 1989 Senate election and the 1998 Senate election. The Reform Party of Alberta nominated and ran only three candidates in its history: Stanley Waters, Ted Morton and Bert Brown.

The other and primary purpose was to keep Reform focused as a federal party instead of being distracted by provincial campaigns. Nonetheless, there was considerable agitation at this time by some Albertan Reform members to form an active provincial party that could challenge Don Getty&#x27;s unpopular Progressive Conservative government. In some opinion polls, the dormant Reform Party actually placed ahead of the Tories. When Ralph Klein was elected to lead the PCs in 1992, enthusiasm for an alternative right wing party that might split the vote with the Tories and benefit the surging Liberals quickly faded.

The Reform Party did not nominate any candidates in the 2004 Alberta general election or the 2004 Alberta Senate nominee election. As a result, the Reform Party was deregistered by Elections Alberta for failing to endorse a candidate.

The federal Reform Party&#x27;s successor, the Canadian Alliance, was also not interested in forming provincial wings, but unlike Reform, the CA did not register the Alliance name with provincial electoral officers during its short history. As a result, a section of the Albertan CA membership formed the Alberta Alliance in 2002. Unlike Reform, the Alberta Alliance was an active political party—it fielded a full slate of candidates in the 2004 general election, and won one seat in the Legislature.

The Reform Party of Alberta was deregistered after the election, along with the Equity Party.

==List of leaders==
*David Salmon (2000 - 2004)

==1989 Senatorial financial statement==

According to the official archives of Elections Alberta, in the 1989 Senate election, the Stan Waters campaign received $147,822 in campaign donations, $19,000 transferred from the Reform Party of Alberta, and $23,558.96 was from fundraising functions, for a total of $190,380.96 in campaign period revenue.

Expenses for the campaign were $197,641.00, resulting in a deficit of $7,260.04.

Note: Future party leader David Salmon was Stan Waters official agent.

<text>CSS &quot;Tennessee&quot; was a casemate ironclad ram built for the Confederate Navy during the American Civil War. She served as the flagship of Admiral Franklin Buchanan (who would later be captured in the same ship), commander of the Mobile Squadron, after her commissioning. She was captured in 1864 by the Union Navy during the Battle of Mobile Bay and then participated in the Union&#x27;s subsequent Siege of Fort Morgan. &quot;Tennessee&quot; was decommissioned after the war and sold in 1867 for scrap.

==Design, description and construction==

&quot;Tennessee&quot; was built at Selma, Alabama, where she was commissioned on February 16, 1864. towed her to Mobile, where she was fitted out.

&quot;Tennessee&quot; was laid down in October 1862, hull and other woodwork turned out by Henry D. Bassett, who launched her the following February, ready for towing to Mobile to be engined and armed. Her steam plant came from the steamer . Her casemate design differed materially from and , but the iron plate was the same 2 by 10 in (50 by 250 mm) as used on and but triple thickness instead of double; her iron plate was made by the Shelby Iron Company in Shelby, Alabama. A fearsome detail of her defensive armament was a &quot;hot water attachment to her boilers for repelling boarders, throwing one water stream from forward of the casemate and one aft.&quot;

The vicissitudes implicit in creating such an ironclad are graphically conveyed by Admiral Franklin Buchanan, writing September 20, 1863 to Confederate Navy Secretary Stephen Mallory:

The work on the &quot;Tennessee&quot; has progressed for some weeks past, under Mr. Pierce, as fast as the means in his power would permit. There is much delay for want of plate and bolt iron. It was impossible to iron both sponsons at the same time, as the vessel had to be careened several feet to enable them to put the iron on. Even then several of the workmen were waist deep in the water to accomplish it — to careen her, large beams 12 feet (3.7 m) square had to be run out of her posts and secured, on which several tons of iron had to be placed, and during the progress of putting on the sponson iron the shield iron could not be put on. The work has been carried on night and day when it could be done advantageously. I visited the &quot;Nashville&quot; and &quot;Tennessee&quot; frequently and, to secure and control the services of the mechanics, I have had them all conscripted and detailed to work under my orders. Previously, they were very independent and stopped working when they pleased.

(Joseph Pierce, referred to above, was Acting Naval Constructor in the Mobile area.)
&quot;Tennessee&quot; became flagship of Admiral Buchanan, and served in action in the Battle of Mobile Bay on August 5, 1864. On that morning &quot;Tennessee&quot; and wooden gunboats , , and , steamed into combat against Admiral David G. Farragut&#x27;s powerful fleet of four ironclad monitors and 14 wooden steamers. Unable to ram the Union ships because of their superior speed, &quot;Tennessee&quot; delivered a vigorous fire on the Federals at close range. The Confederate gunboats were sunk or dispersed. Farragut&#x27;s fleet steamed up into the bay and anchored. Buchanan might have held &quot;Tennessee&quot; under the fort&#x27;s protection but steamed after the Federal fleet and engaged despite overwhelming odds. The ram became the target for the entire Union fleet. &quot;Tennessee&quot; was rammed by several ships, and her vulnerable steering chains (which, oddly, lay in exposed trenches on the after deck) were carried away by the heavy gunfire. Unable to maneuver, &quot;Tennessee&quot; was battered repeatedly by heavy solid shot from her adversaries. With two of her men killed, Admiral Buchanan and eight others wounded, and increasingly severe damage being inflicted on her, &quot;Tennessee&quot; was forced to surrender.

==USS &quot;Tennessee&quot;==

Immediately following her capture and repair, &quot;Tennessee&quot; was commissioned in the United States Navy, Acting Volunteer Lieutenant Pierre Giraud in command. The ironclad participated in the Federal assault on Fort Morgan on August 23 which resulted in the fort&#x27;s capitulation that same day. That autumn, she moved from Mobile, Alabama, to New Orleans, Louisiana, for repairs before joining the Mississippi Squadron. She served on the Mississippi River through the end of the war in April 1865 and briefly thereafter. On August 19, 1865, &quot;Tennessee&quot; was placed out of commission and was laid up at New Orleans. There, she remained until November 27, 1867, when she was sold at auction to J. F. Armstrong for scrapping. Though the remainder of the vessel was scrapped, two 7-inch Brooke rifles and two 6.4-inch Brooke rifles were preserved and are still on display in the Old weapons exhibit in East Willard Park at the Washington Navy Yard, Washington, D.C. One of her 6.4-inch (160 mm) double-banded Brooke rifled cannon is on display at the headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief U. S. Atlantic Command at the Norfolk, Virginia, Naval base. One of her 7-inch Brooke rifles is on display at the city hall of Selma, Alabama, where it was cast.

<doc id="1160222" wikidata="Q155358" url="?curid=1160222" title="Music (Madonna album)">
<text>Music is the eighth studio album by American singer Madonna, released on September 18, 2000, by Maverick and Warner Bros. Records. Following the success of her previous album &quot;Ray of Light&quot; (1998), Madonna found herself in a music scene increasingly influenced by a younger generation of singers such as Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. This led her to seek a distinctive sound that would set her apart in the evolving musical landscape. Her collaborations with Mirwais Ahmadzaï and William Orbit resulted in a more experimental direction for the album. &quot;Music&quot; incorporates many different genres into its overall dance-pop and electronica vibe, taking influences from funk, house, rock, country and folk. With the album embracing a western motif, Madonna reimagined her image in the role of a cowgirl.

&quot;Music&quot; received positive reviews from music critics, with many comparing its production to &quot;Ray of Light&quot;. The album earned a total of five Grammy Award nominations, winning one for Best Recording Package at the 43rd ceremony. The record was also a commercial success, debuting at number one in 23 countries with four million copies sold in its first ten days of release. In the United States, &quot;Music&quot; debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with first-week sales of 420,000 copies, making it her first album to top the chart in more than a decade. It received multiple certifications in several regions, and became the 19th best-selling album of 2001 with a total of over 11 million copies sold worldwide.

To promote &quot;Music&quot;, Madonna embarked on a small promotional tour, consisting of televised performances at occasions such as the 2000 MTV Europe Music Awards and the 43rd Grammy Awards, and with two free concerts at Roseland Ballroom and Brixton Academy limited to contest winners. It was also supported by the Drowned World Tour in the following year, her first concert tour after eight years; the tour visited North America and Europe, grossing over US$75 million and making it the highest-grossing tour by a solo act of the year and fourth overall.

Three official singles were released from the album. The title track was the lead single, topping the record charts in 25 countries worldwide and became Madonna&#x27;s 12th and most recent number-one hit on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It was followed with another top-five hit &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot;, and &quot;What It Feels Like for a Girl&quot; which attained the top-ten in several countries worldwide. &quot;Impressive Instant&quot; was released as a promotional single in the United States, topping the Dance Club Songs chart. &quot;Amazing&quot; was also briefly released as a promotional single in selected countries before being withdrawn shortly afterwards. Retrospectively, &quot;Music&quot; has been recognized by music journalists for anticipating a number of musical trends, such as electro-house, vocal manipulation, lyrical gibberish, chopped up acoustics, and the adoption of cowboy kitsch.

== Background and development ==
In 1998, Madonna released her seventh studio album &quot;Ray of Light&quot; to critical and commercial success, winning four Grammy Awards at the 41st edition of the ceremony, including Best Pop Album. Madonna intended to embark on a new concert tour to promote it in 1999, after filming &quot;The Next Best Thing&quot;; however, the film&#x27;s production suffered a delay and due to limited time, plans for a tour were eventually cancelled. &quot;The Next Best Thing&quot; was released in March 2000, receiving unfavorable reviews from critics. As part of the film&#x27;s soundtrack, she recorded a cover version of Don McLean&#x27;s &quot;American Pie&quot; (1971) at request of her co-star Rupert Everett, which garnered mixed reactions from critics and the public. However, it became a commercial success worldwide, topping the charts in several countries throughout Europe. The song also became her ninth number-one single in the United Kingdom, extending her record of most chart-topping singles by a female artist in the region. Despite not being released commercially in the United States, it was also a radio success, reaching number 29 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. The success of &quot;American Pie&quot; increased the public&#x27;s anticipation for Madonna&#x27;s next album at the time.

Shortly after releasing &quot;American Pie&quot;, Madonna announced she was pregnant with her son Rocco, from her relationship with director Guy Ritchie. Wanting to distract herself from the media frenzy surrounding this news, Madonna concentrated on the development of her eighth studio album, entitled &quot;Music&quot;. Buoyed by the commercial success of her previous album, she was keen on returning to the studio to record new music. Madonna was well disposed towards producer William Orbit, with whom she collaborated with on &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, but by 2000, his production and sound had become ubiquitous. Moreover, the music industry became increasingly influenced by a new generation of artists such as Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. At the same time, contemporaries of Madonna&#x27;s own generation, including Prince and Janet Jackson, were seeing a decline in their record sales, prompting Madonna to seek a distinctive sound in the music market. She was then introduced to French DJ and producer Mirwais Ahmadzaï. Madonna instantly liked his pitch-shifting, pulverizing rhythms and his utilization of acid bass in his songs. Ahmadzaï, known for his inclination towards musical innovation, felt inspired to collaborate with Madonna in a way that would achieve her greatest potential.

== Writing and recording ==

Recording sessions for &quot;Music&quot; began in September 1999 at Sarm West Studios in Notting Hill, London, where she had recently moved at the time, and were almost completed by January 2000. Madonna first began collaborating with Orbit. During his sessions with Madonna, he invited DJ Sasha to work on music for possible inclusion on the effort, as they were &quot;looking for a trancey sound&quot;. Orbit commented that the material was &quot;quite a little edgier&quot; and a follow-up &quot;without stopping still&quot; to her previous album, and elaborated, &quot;It&#x27;s almost like we started off with a lot of slow ballad songs and she&#x27;s started to kind of chuck &#x27;em out in favor of more edgy tracks. The album is getting more kind of fast, very European sounding, very English and French sounding, naturally, &#x27;cause everybody working on it apart from her is English or French. Pretty exciting, actually&quot;. After some recording sessions with Orbit, she felt she needed a different sound for her project and scrapped most of the material recorded up to that point. The singer revealed that they had composed nine songs and thought that they were too similar to those of her previous record, prompting her to &quot;throw out everything and start over again.&quot;. Madonna expressed that she did not want her music to blend in with others, especially since Orbit gained popularity amongst mainstream artists following their collaboration. 

As she sought a new collaborator to start over, Madonna was in search of someone &quot;new and edgy and undiscovered&quot; with a different sound. She was introduced to Ahmadzaï by her manager and partner at Maverick Records, Guy Oseary. He had received a take with songs from Ahmadzaï&#x27;s album &quot;Production&quot; through French photographer Stéphane Sednaoui, and was considering signing him as an artist for the record company. Upon hearing the tape, Madonna believed that his sound was exactly what she was seeking for her next record. Within three weeks, they met at Sarm West to commence work on the album. Madonna has always considered competition between her producers to be the way to get the best out of them, but Orbit later revealed that he was not at all offended with her change of mind, &quot;as long as she uses good people. And I love what Mirwais has done.&quot; Three of his tracks eventually appeared on &quot;Music&quot;. For his part, Ahmadzaï was relaxed with the offer to work with Madonna, because he knew she was interested in him for his own work, and not for his ability as a performer or for his past work with another artist. The producer felt free to work but within her limits, as he thought it was important to respect the artist&#x27;s work ethic. According to Ahmadzaï, there were no plans at the beginning of the sessions, with Madonna only asking for something more extreme and rough.

During their first days of collaboration, Madonna encountered language barriers with Ahmadzaï due to his limited English proficiency. This frustrated her to the point of wanting to &quot;rip [her] hair out&quot;. Consequently, Ahmadzaï&#x27;s manager stepped in to act as a translator. As time went by, the pair got to know each other better, and the atmosphere in the studio changed into a more relaxed mood. Madonna said she was intent on making their relationship work, because she believed that he was a &quot;genius&quot; and &quot;so incredibly smart and visionary&quot;. The first song they worked on was &quot;Impressive Instant&quot;, since it was almost complete on the demo that he had sent to Madonna. The singer also wanted to sing &quot;Paradise (Not for Me)&quot;, another track present on the demo; however, Ahmadzaï wanted it for his own album, prompting him to make slightly different versions for both records. According to Madonna, the title track was one of the first songs they wrote and produced together and set the tone of the rest of the album. Within the first ten days, they had recorded the backing vocals and acoustic guitars on a Sony 48-track and transferred it to a Logic Audio workstation, using the converters of TC Electronic Finalizer. Feeling that their ideas for the tracks would be difficult to create in Sarm West, Ahmadzaï wanted to return to Paris and work there alone on his own computer. She wanted him to treat her voice differently, and although he did not want any effects on her vocals at first, the producer used the Antares Auto-Tune plug-in set for the pitch correction on some tracks as per the singer&#x27;s request. The audio processor kept the characteristic of Madonna&#x27;s vocals, and she sang a little out of tune and vibrato. However, other songs such as &quot;I Deserve It&quot; had no effects other than acoustic instrumentation.

Madonna developed an interest in collaborating with Guy Sigsworth as she was drawn by his appreciation for understated technology in music. She reached out to him with the intention of adding an ambient feel to her record. Madonna presented him with the preliminary demo tracks developed for &quot;Music&quot;, including the songs created with Ahmadzaï. She chose one of two sketches he had sent her, which was almost finished but was still kept unpolished so that Madonna could continue writing on top of it. The backing track contained a sample from the 1993 British film &quot;The Cement Garden&quot;, with the voice of actress Charlotte Gainsbourg, which later became &quot;What It Feels Like for a Girl&quot;. He worked on the track at Sarm West rather than his own studio since he did not want to &quot;fuck up&quot; working with Madonna. The song was finished quickly and within four days they were able to create the final version. From the first day onward, Madonna and Sigsworth chose to retain all the musical noises from the demo; this required the producer to creatively reconfigure her vocals around the segments, utilizing Pro Tools on a SSL 9000 J console. Madonna insisted Sigsworth to give her a rough approximate sound, rather than work on the music for two-three hours. That way, they would know if it can be kept or rejected and save time on production. During recording, Sigsworth noticed that the verses were out of sync with the music and wanted to add extra bar which would help them be coherent. However, Madonna dismissed it, and he had to cut up the individual music to put it in his computer for accompanying her vocals. Sigsworth thought it made the song sound more &quot;fluid and magical&quot; and commended Madonna for not taking the cop-out solution.

== Composition ==
=== Sound and themes ===

Sonically, &quot;Music&quot; is predominantly a pop, dance-pop, and electronica album, containing influences of a wide array of genres such as funk, house, techno, rock, country, folk, and R&amp;B. It was seen as a continuation of the electronic-oriented work that was present on &quot;Ray of Light&quot;. Madonna characterized &quot;Music&quot; as &quot;edgier and a bit funkier&quot; compared to her previous record. She described the composition of &quot;Music&quot; as &quot;funky, electronic music blended with futuristic folk&quot;, complete with &quot;jangly guitars and moody melancholic lines&quot;. Shaad D&#x27;Souza of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; viewed the record as &quot;an album designed to unite the disparate tastes of America and Europe, to act as a bridge between teen pop and sophisti-pop, the mainstream and the underground.&quot; For &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;″s Sal Cinquemani, Madonna took a &quot;more experimental direction&quot; with the album, whereas David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; thought that the folktronica style of Ahmadzaï was the &quot;dominant musical force&quot; on six of the songs.

Thematically, the album can be divided into two categories; partying and love, which Madonna described as the frivolous and non-frivolous sides of her life, respectively. She declared that she usually makes &quot;a record that&#x27;s one or the other&quot;, but felt that she covered both themes at the same time on &quot;Music&quot;. Madonna wanted the album to embody her desire to dance, contrasting with the introspective tone of &quot;Ray of Light&quot;. She likened herself to an animal &quot;ready to be sprung from a cage&quot; after leading a quiet and domestic life for years, expressing a longing for performance and being on stage. The singer characterized &quot;Music&quot; as a record made to bridge the gap between the impersonal experience of living in an era of advanced technology, with the &quot;warmth, &quot;compassion, and a sense of humor&quot; of human connection. She perceived the album as a mirror of societal trends, as she felt that society had become &quot;too complacent.&quot; For D&#x27;Souza, unlike her previous or future records, the album has no concept and relies on spontaneity.

=== Music and lyrics ===
The title track, &quot;Music&quot;, is the opening song on the album, and features a disco and funk production. Its production features a dry sound, with heavy usage of equalization, which creates contrast within the vocal track, continuing until the first chorus. The song begins with Madonna&#x27;s a cappella, slightly lowered and vocodered voice uttering &quot;Hey, Mr. DJ, put a record on; I wanna dance with my baby&quot;. The phrase reiterates the uniting power of music. The primary hook, &quot;Music makes the people come together, yeah / Music makes the bourgeoisie and the rebel&quot;, was deemed as having political implications, with Madonna apparent,y renouncing the bourgeoisie. Track two, the &quot;space-age&quot;, futuristic-sounding &quot;Impressive Instant&quot;, has been described by &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Larry Flick as a &quot;club-savvy stomper&quot; marked by interesting keyboard lines, with Madonna&#x27;s vocals changing from &quot;distorted, robotic lines&quot; to &quot;playful, child like chants&quot;. Throughout the song, her vocals are often isolated, backed by electronic sounds and an octave bass. A &quot;burbling&quot; synth appears and is followed by a repeated chorus of &quot;I&#x27;m in a trance&quot;, ending the song with a solo vocal phrase. Lyrically, the track deals with love at first sight; in it, Madonna affirms, &quot;You&#x27;re the one that I&#x27;ve been waiting for / I don&#x27;t even know your name&quot;. It also references being seduced and losing control of oneself (&quot;And my world is spinning; spinning, baby, out of control&quot;) with comparisons to various cosmic and celestial phenomena, in lines such as &quot;Cosmic systems intertwine / Astral bodies drip like wine / All of nature ebbs and flows&quot;, but ultimately returns to the subject of dance. &quot;Runaway Lover&quot; features a &quot;hard stepping techno pulse&quot; while, lyrically, focuses on Madonna rebuking a man for not being faithful, as exemplified in the chorus, &quot;It doesn’t pay to be a runaway lover / It doesn’t pay to give-away what you lack / You&#x27;ll never get your money back&quot;, or the line &quot;Just like a ship that&#x27;s lost at sea / You don&#x27;t care where you drop your anchor / Make sure it doesn&#x27;t land on me&quot;.

The record&#x27;s fourth track, &quot;I Deserve It&quot;, was dedicated to her then-partner and husband, Guy Ritchie, as evidenced by the sequence of wordplays with &quot;this guy&quot;; on the track, Madonna states that Ritchie was &quot;made for her&quot;, and believes that true love belongs to those who &quot;deserve&quot; it. The song is an acoustic-framed track supported by a folk and hip-hop inflected groove, featuring double-tracked guitar, which Madonna plays herself, and a three-chord sequence, G-C-D (with an F-chord in the chorus). The fifth song, &quot;Amazing&quot;, was released as a special single in Mexico only. It opens with a music-box-like combination of keyboards and strings as Madonna tells a tale of love and desire that she can not get rid-of. It transforms into a 60s-inspired, rock-tinged pop track with a dreamy, soaraway chorus, featuring a rhythm-section Sixties beat topped off with gruff electric guitar arpeggios in stereo. At 2:30, the chorus &quot;It&#x27;s amazing what a boy can do&quot; is repeated without much instrumentation in the mix before it returns. On the sixth track, &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Perfect&quot;, an apologetic Madonna confesses that maybe she has been unfaithful to someone, but at the same time, she recognizes that &quot;nobody is perfect&quot;. She juxtaposes her human emotions with heavily manipulated vocals (using a vocoder) on the song, raising the pitch of her voice slightly and giving an almost robotic quality, with her true voice only being heard saying &quot;Sorry, but,&quot; before the chorus begins with &quot;nobody’s perfect&quot;. Her normal voice is again heard at the bridge, singing: &quot;Cool, I am, when I am with you / Cool, I’m not, when I am lonely&quot;.
The seventh track, &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot;, was described as an &quot;electonica meets country rock&quot; song. It begins with the sound of an acoustic guitar edited to sound like a CD player &quot;skipping&quot;; every fourth beat is followed by a small silence that eventually builds into the chorus. Lyrically, Madonna urges her lover to stop controlling her actions and feelings, while conjuring up unnatural, Western-inspired imagery through the lyrics, such as &quot;Tell the bed not to lay / Like the open mouth of a grave, yeah / Not to stare up at me / Like a calf down on its knees&quot; and &quot;Take the black off a crow / But don’t tell me I have to go&quot;. The feminist &quot;What It Feels Like for a Girl&quot; begins with Gainsbourg&#x27;s monologue from the film &quot;The Sement Garden&quot;, in which a female voice opines &quot;Girls can wear jeans and cut their hair short, because it’s okay to be a boy. But for a boy to look like a girl is degrading, because you think that being a girl is degrading. But secretly, you’d love to know what it’s like, wouldn’t you? What it feels like for a girl.&quot; This is followed by percussion, a rhythm section supported by string pads, and the chord sequence which highlights the melody. The ambient production has a number of sounds floating in-and-out of the track, long echos and vocals being pulled back. It also features the same sound of a CD player &quot;skipping&quot; heard on the previous song. Lyrically, Madonna condemns male chauvinism by addressing hurtful myths about female inferiority and female role-playing in society, and invites male listeners to imagine themselves as girls.

The following track, &quot;Paradise (Not for Me)&quot;, is a ballad which finds the singer &quot;trampled and sad&quot;. It begins with the juxtaposition of a marimba and a child-like half-whispered voice, and from time to time Madonna&#x27;s vocals are joined by an android. She also sings the second verse in French. &quot;Gone&quot;, the final track on the American and Canadian versions of the album, continues the depressed mood of the previous tracks, featuring a &quot;schizophrenic future-folk&quot; production, contrasting acoustic guitars with electronic elements. Lyrically, it presents a spiritually disquiet Madonna who proclaims that &quot;selling out is not my thing&quot;, addressing how fame has affected her personal life. Some international editions of &quot;Music&quot; include &quot;American Pie&quot; from &quot;The Next Best Thing&quot; soundtrack as a bonus track; the production combines futuristic electro-pop elements with rock from the 1970s decade. Madonna&#x27;s co-star, actor Rupert Everett also provides backing vocals. Madonna&#x27;s version cuts most of the lyrical content from the original song. The b-side, &quot;Cyber-Raga&quot; was recorded during the album sessions and is included on the Japanese and Australian release of the album. It is sung in Sanskrit and is an ode of devotion to a higher power and a wish for peace on earth.

== Artwork and release ==
The album artwork for &quot;Music&quot; was taken from an April 10-13, 2000 photoshoot by French fashion photographer Jean Baptiste Mondino at Smashbox Studios in Los Angeles. Madonna and Mondino had collaborated several times previously and Mondino would also go on to direct the music video for &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot;. The original concept of a cowboy-inspired aesthetic for the album was suggested by Mondino, who was commissioned to photograph the artwork. Although initially reluctant with the idea, Madonna loved the final result and was inspired to use the style as a basis for the album&#x27;s design and visuals. Styling for the photoshoot was handled by Arianne Phillips, who had taken inspiration from &quot;Rodeo Girl&quot;, a photography book by Lisa Eisner and had the idea to style vintage Western clothing and cowboy hats with rhinestone-embellished cowboy shirts, jeans and high heels. The visuals and typographical style paid homage to the iconography of the American west, relishing Americana culture while simultaneously satirizing it. Santiago Fouz-Hernández, author of &quot;Madonna&#x27;s Drowned Worlds: New Approaches to Her Subcultural Transformations&quot;, described the visual as &quot;a complete celebration of camp&quot; and an evocation of Judy Garland. Madonna&#x27;s cyber-cowgirl image would eventually become one of her most recognized reinventions. The album&#x27;s packaging and design were done by Kevin Reagan.
On August 22, 2000, a month before the album&#x27;s official release, all tracks from &quot;Music&quot; were leaked online through Napster. Maverick and Warner Bros. Records first published it on September 18, 2000, in regions including Australia, Japan, and the United Kingdom, containing two bonus tracks, &quot;American Pie&quot; and &quot;Cyber-raga&quot;, in the first two countries. It was released a day later in the United States. A limited edition was also released, which contained a 24-page booklet about the album, a copper brooch with the album&#x27;s logo and two stickers, wrapped in a linen cloth available in four different colors. Additionally, the international version included &quot;American Pie&quot; as a bonus track, a decision Madonna later regretted, explaining it was &quot;something a certain record company executive twisted my arm into doing&quot;. As a result, it was not added as a bonus track in the United States and Canada. The album was also made available on digital download through Madonna&#x27;s website on Apple&#x27;s QuickTime format, including exclusive access to two remixes of &quot;Music&quot;. The edition released in Mexico contains as bonus tracks the Spanish version of &quot;What It Feels Like for a Girl&quot;, titled &quot;Lo Que Siente la Mujer&quot;, and a remix of the song by Above &amp; Beyond. A special edition was released to promote the Drowned World Tour with a bonus CD with remixes and the video of &quot;What It Feels Like for a Girl&quot;.

Madonna chatted with fans through her first live chat on AOL on the day of &quot;Music&quot;″s release in the United Kingdom. In order to celebrate the album&#x27;s release, she held a release party at dance emporium Catch One in Los Angeles, on September 20, 2000. The £1.4 million party was attended by 600 selected guests who received special invitations. The invitations were sent out in white leather boxes, lined with black fur. A gold necklace was inside with letters spelling out the album&#x27;s title, and only those wearing the necklaces would be allowed into the club. More than a dozen strippers were in attendance as a reference to the music video for &quot;Music&quot;. She sported a five-carat diamond ring Ritchie gave her for her birthday, and a black T-shirt that read &quot;&quot;Snatch&quot; Coming Soon&quot; promoting Ritchie&#x27;s film, while he promoted Madonna&#x27;s album wearing a T-shirt with the word &quot;Music&quot; emblazoned on it. Among those who attended the party were Sheryl Crow, Gwen Stefani, Guy Oseary, and George Clinton, who arrived with Macy Gray in a horse-drawn carriage. Ritchie was initially denied access into the VIP lounge by a security guard who did not know who he was, and reportedly got into a shoving match with him.

== Promotion ==
=== Live performances ===

Following the album&#x27;s release, Madonna embarked on a promotional tour and appeared on several television shows to publicize the album. She gave an interview and performed &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot; on &quot;The Late Show with David Letterman&quot; on November 3, 2000, becoming the first time since her controversial appearance in 1994. She then traveled to Europe to further promote the album. The singer performed &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot; on German game-show &quot;Wetten, dass..?&quot; on November 11, 2000. At the MTV Europe Music Awards 2000, Madonna performed &quot;Music&quot; on November 16, in Stockholm, Sweden. After being introduced by Ali G as &quot;Maradona&quot;, she performed the song wearing a T-shirt with the name of Australian singer Kylie Minogue printed on it. She later performed &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot; and &quot;Music&quot; on British television program &quot;Top of The Pops&quot;, in an appearance aired on November 17. One week later, the singer performed the aforementioned songs live on French television program &quot;Nulle Part Ailleurs&quot;. Madonna additionally performed &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot; on &quot;Carràmba! Che fortuna&quot; in Italy, on December 2, 2000, hosted by Raffaella Carrà.

On February 21, 2001, she performed &quot;Music&quot; at the 43rd ceremony of the Grammy Awards. During the performance, the stage was equipped with five large video screens that displayed images from various moments from her career. Madonna entered onto the stage in a classic Cadillac driven by rapper Bow Wow. The singer emerged from the back seat of the car in a full-length fur coat and a hat, quickly removing the clothes to reveal a tight leather jacket and jeans. She removed her jacket to reveal a black tank top with the words &quot;Material Girl&quot; printed on it, a reference to her 1984 single.

Madonna also held two small promotional concerts to release &quot;Music&quot;. The first was on November 5, 2000, at Roseland Ballroom in New York; it was a free concert for an audience of 3,000 people, exclusively for contest winners and select celebrities. The costumes and set were designed by Dolce &amp; Gabbana and reflected Madonna&#x27;s cowgirl persona, with the stage decked as a neo-Western wonderland, with bales of hay, yellow-lit horseshoes and silver cacti throughout the lobby and entrance. Songs performed included &quot;Impressive Instant&quot;, &quot;Runaway Lover&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot;, &quot;What It Feels Like for a Girl&quot;, and &quot;Music&quot;. For the performance, she wore a T-shirt with &quot;Britney Spears&quot; written on it. The second concert was held at Brixton Academy in London, on November 29, 2000. It was broadcast via the internet through MSN&#x27;s website to an estimated record-breaking 9 million viewers across the world. The setlist was the same from the Roseland Ballroom&#x27;s concert, with &quot;Holiday&quot; (1983) being added to the setlist. For the London concert, Madonna&#x27;s T-shirt displayed the names of her children Rocco on the front, and Lola on the back. Another concert was planned to take place in Paris, but it did not happen.

=== Concert tour ===

To promote &quot;Music&quot; and &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, Madonna embarked on the Drowned World Tour, her fifth concert tour. Originally planned to start in 1999, it was pushed back to 2001 and was her first tour since The Girlie Show (1993). When Madonna decided to go on tour, she was met with time constraints and had only three months to prepare the show. Jamie King served as the creative director and the choreographer of the show. The concert was divided into different thematic acts: &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Punk Girl&quot;, &quot;Geisha Girl&quot;, &quot;Cyber Cowgirl&quot;, and &quot;Spanish Girl/Ghetto Girl&quot;, with each act representing a phase of Madonna&#x27;s career. The tour received positive reviews and was a commercial success; with a gross of US$75 million, it was the year&#x27;s highest-grossing tour by a solo artist and fourth overall. Drowned World was nominated for Major Tour of the Year and Most Creative Stage Production at the 2001 &quot;Pollstar&quot; awards, but lost them to U2. The concert was broadcast live on HBO from The Palace of Auburn Hills in Auburn Hills, Michigan on August 26, 2001. On November 13, it was released on home video under the title &quot;Drowned World Tour 2001&quot;.

=== Singles ===

&quot;Music&quot; was made available commercially as the lead single from the album on August 21, 2000. It had previously been leaked on internet platforms such as Napster, leading Madonna&#x27;s team to respond with a statement threatening to take legal measures against them. It has been praised by contemporary critics. The single achieved international success by topping the charts in 25 countries worldwide. It became Madonna&#x27;s 12th number-one single on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, making her tie the Supremes as the fifth artist with most Hot 100 number-ones. In the United Kingdom, &quot;Music&quot; also reached at number one on the UK Singles Chart, with the singer becoming the first solo female artist to collect ten number-one singles.

&quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot; was released to radios in the United States on November 28, 2000, as the second single from the album, while &quot;Music&quot; was slowly descending on the charts. It reached number four on the Hot 100 chart, tying Madonna with the Beatles as the artist with the second-most top-ten singles in the chart history. In 2015, &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot; at number 26 on their list of &quot;Madonna&#x27;s 40 Biggest Hits&quot; on the Hot 100. The song topped the music charts in Canada, Italy, and New Zealand, while attaining top-ten positions on the charts in a number of European nations. In 2005, the song was placed at number 285 on &quot;Blender&quot; magazine&#x27;s The 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born.

&quot;What It Feels Like for a Girl&quot; was released to North American contemporary hit radios as the third and final single from the album, on April 6, 2001. It received positive commentary from contemporary critics. The song was not able to reach the top 20 on the Hot 100, but topped the US Dance Club Songs chart. However, &quot;What It Feels Like for a Girl&quot; attained the top-ten in several other countries worldwide. The music video, directed by Guy Ritchie, portrays Madonna as an angry woman on a crime spree. Reviewers criticized the video for being overly violent and graphic, and was banned from most North American and European video stations, receiving only early hours play.

&quot;Impressive Instant&quot; was released as a promotional single with remixes commissioned by Peter Rauhofer. It was not released commercially and was not promoted to radio, therefore it did not appear on any sales or airplay charts of &quot;Billboard&quot;. It went to number one on the Dance Club Songs chart where it stayed for two weeks, becoming Madonna&#x27;s 27th number-one song on the chart. Madonna had planned for the song to be the fourth official single from &quot;Music&quot;, but her record label intended to release &quot;Amazing&quot; instead, issuing promos and test pressings for the track. However, due to a lack of consensus, no additional singles were released.

== Critical reception ==
&quot;Music&quot; received positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 80, based on 16 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic praised the album&#x27;s layered music and described Madonna&#x27;s collaboration with Ahmadzaï as the reason why the album &quot;comes alive with spark and style&quot;. Robert Christgau from &quot;The Village Voice&quot; said that it has &quot;consistency and flow&quot; because all of its songs are good and , and affirmed that &quot;she&#x27;s got her sass back.&quot; &quot;Vibe&quot;″s Dimitri Ehrlich complimented the record&#x27;s &quot;brilliantly arranged keyboards, futuristic drums, and electronica dressings&quot; and felt it was a &quot;weird and fresh-sounding album&quot;. Alex Pappademas from &quot;Spin&quot; said that the album is &quot;a much-needed breath of fresh VapoRub&quot;, and noted that it is &quot;the first Madonna record in years that feels as effortless as the dance-pop of her Ciccone youth&quot;. Danny Eccleston, in a review for &quot;Q&quot;, called it &quot;brave, radical and punchy&quot;, as well as &quot;Madonna without a safety net&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Michael Paoletta noted how &quot;much of the set is vibrant and uplifting in tone&quot; and although the project is &quot;decidedly steeped in youth culture&quot;, it &quot;rarely courts the teens that seemingly control the charts&quot;.

Gary Crossing of &quot;Dotmusic&quot; described &quot;Music&quot; as a &quot;generally an upbeat dancey album which finds Madonna still ahead of the game sixteen years into her career&quot;. John Hand of the BBC News said that the melancholic tone of &quot;Ray of Light&quot; had been replaced by &quot;real energy and a renewed sense of fun&quot; on &quot;Music&quot;, and wrote that &quot;the production may be breathtaking thanks to Orbit and Mirwais but at the centre of it all is Madonna, resolutely doing it her way&quot;. Classifying it as Madonna&#x27;s first &quot;headphones album&quot;, &quot;Blender&quot;″s Tony Power also observed that it was &quot;more playful and less pompous than &quot;Ray of Light&quot;.&quot; In the same vein, Greg Kot from &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; called &quot;Music&quot; the &quot;groove-happiest&quot; Madonna had been since &quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot; (1990), and said it was more dance-friendly in contrast to the &quot;highly introspective&quot; &quot;Ray of Light&quot;. In a review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Barry Walters also compared &quot;Music&quot; to &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, stating that the former was a rough and improvised version of the latter, but lauded that Madonna had chosen to make a more &quot;instinctive&quot; record than her previous endeavours. Jason Ferguson of MTV also thought it was more exciting than any mainstream record since &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, as well as &quot;an incredibly engaging and thoroughly interesting album&quot;.

Michael Hubbard of &quot;MusicOMH&quot; stated that Orbit&#x27;s work on the album was &quot;rather too similar&quot; to some tracks on &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, but complimented Madonna for coming back &quot;with something else that proves she&#x27;s still the best out there&quot;. In a review for &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;, Sal Cinquemani criticized Madonna&#x27;s collaborations with Orbit, calling them repetitive and uninteresting, despite being catchy; he also felt the record seemed &quot;more like a collection of songs than a cohesive album&quot;. David Browne was less enthusiastic in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, calling it &quot;her most patchwork record since the Sean Penn years&quot; and &quot;frustratingly inconsistent&quot;, which &quot;feels like a collection of sounds – clever, intriguing ones, to be sure – that seek to compensate for ordinary melodies and Madonna&#x27;s stoic delivery.&quot; Victoria Segal from &quot;NME&quot; said that &quot;Music&quot; is &quot;deliberately upstaged by beats so showy they belong in a strip joint&quot;, which almost managed to make Madonna disappear on the record. Segal also stated that the &quot;bluntly explicit title&quot; was not ironic as the record was &quot;about the music, not Madonna; about the sounds, not the image.&quot; For WhatCulture&#x27;s Reece Shrewsbury, &quot;[&quot;Music&quot;] just isn&#x27;t as iconic or impressive&quot; and &quot;doesn&#x27;t hold up as well&quot; as the singer&#x27;s other works. Stephen Thompson of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; panned it as &quot;a dreadfully dull misstep&quot; with &quot;plenty of studio tricks but virtually no personality&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Garry Mulholland dismissed it as &quot;screamingly, amusingly, hypnotically naff [...] the sound of a bunch of middle-aged trend-watchers second-guessing what today&#x27;s kids go for.&quot;

== Commercial performance ==
CNN reported that &quot;Music&quot; had sold over four million copies worldwide 10 days after its release. The album set a record in Warner Music Group as the biggest album shipment in the company, with three million copies worldwide in its first week of release. It debuted at number one in 23 countries. Overall, the record was the 19th best-selling album of 2001 worldwide, selling 4.1 million copies. As of October 2008, &quot;Music&quot; has sold more than 11 million units globally.

&quot;Music&quot; debuted at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with over 420,000 copies sold in its first week, becoming the first Madonna album to top the chart in more than a decade since &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; (1989). The album was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on November 21, 2005.

== Legacy ==

Tom Breihan from &quot;Stereogum&quot; wrote that &quot;Music&quot; anticipated &quot;a lot of things&quot;, and while Madonna did not invent any of them, they were &quot;absent from mainstream pop music around the turn of the millennium&quot;. In his review, he added examples such as &quot;thudding big-room&quot; electro-house, &quot;aggressive&quot; vocal manipulation, &quot;ecstatic&quot; lyrical meaninglessness, acoustic guitars chopped up and refracted into unrecognizable shapes, joyous hedonism, robot voices, and the embrace of cowboy kitsch. Writing for the Grammy Awards&#x27; official website, Zel McCarthy called the album &quot;a reminder of a less complicated time and a blueprint for our future&quot;, noting that Madonna could be analog and digital, acoustic or electronic. He particularly praised &quot;Impressive Instant&quot;, describing it like &quot;nothing anyone had heard before—20 years later, it still does.&quot;

In 2015, Rob Sheffield of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that &quot;Music&quot; is still Madonna&#x27;s &quot;hardest-rocking and most seductive album.&quot; On the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary, Joe Lynch of &quot;Billboard&quot; referred to it as &quot;a key piece of 21st century dancefloor canon&quot;. He noted that the album was conceived during a period when American music was divided by musical genres, as well as during a time when the industry was ruled by newer artists who were adopting teen pop and urban-style oriented music. Lynch praised the album&#x27;s utilization of dance-pop despite its decline in the United States at the dawn of the new millennium, in contrast to teen pop or hip-hop-flavored R&amp;B styles that were more popular at the time. McCarthy commented that Madonna &quot;deftly eschewed the petty cultural battles between genres and generations&quot;. &quot;The Straits Times&quot; also noted the dominance of boybands and teen pop artists, and wrote how Madonna ushered 1980s-electro as &quot;a new retro-fad&quot;.

After the release of its title track, &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Silvio Pietroluongo called &quot;a move that could be considered either unusual or genius&quot; about the decision of release various formats, maxi-CD and vinyl one week cassette and CD the next. It was described as a &quot;phenomenal week at retail&quot; and helped push &quot;Music&quot; to the number one at the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, giving Madonna her best one-week sales total of the Nielsen SoundScan era for a single at that time with 62,000 units. Pietroluongo remarked that &quot;I&#x27;m finding it quite difficult to think of another maxi-CD that has scanned that many units in a week&quot;.

=== Accolades and rankings ===
&quot;Music&quot; earned a total of five Grammy Award nominations. In 2001, it won Best Recording Package, given to art director Kevin Reagan, and was nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album, while the title track was nominated for Record of the Year and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 43rd edition. In 2002, Madonna received one more nomination for &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot; in the category of Best Short Form Music Video. Additionally, the album was recognized as the Best International Album at the Danish Music Awards, the International Pop Album of the Year at the Hungarian Music Awards, and the International Album of the Year at the NRJ Music Awards in 2001.

&quot;Music&quot; was voted the 16th and 18th best record of 2001 in the Pazz &amp; Jop and Dean&#x27;s List, both annual polls published by &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. &quot;Spin&quot; also named the record the 18th best album of 2000. On &quot;NME&quot;″s list of the 50 best albums of 2000, the album was ranked at number 47. Three editors of &quot;Billboard&quot; also chose &quot;Music&quot; in their top five of best-of albums of 2000. It was also featured in a number of the best albums of the decade; &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; included the album on their list of &quot;The Best Albums of the Aughts&quot; at number 31, while it was included at WFPK&#x27;s 500 Albums of the 2000s at number 223. In 2003, the album was listed at number 452 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. It is Madonna&#x27;s fourth album on the list, the most among female artists. In 2005, &quot;Music&quot; was featured in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

<text>Jack J. Volrich (February 27, 1928 – May 31, 2010) was born in Anyox, British Columbia and was the 33rd mayor of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada from 1977 to 1980. Prior to this, he practised law and served as an alderman on the Vancouver City Council.
He started his political career with the municipal political party, TEAM. However, he left TEAM during his first term as mayor and ran successfully as an independent with the endorsement of the more conservative NPA (Non-Partisan Association) in the 1978 election. He was defeated in an upset in 1980 by Michael Harcourt. Harcourt was a fellow former TEAM member who would go on to become premier of British Columbia. Important issues during Volrich&#x27;s tenure as mayor included the proposed construction of a trade and convention centre and the debate over the ward system method of electing aldermen to city council.

Volrich resumed practising law, but returned to the political world when he ran unsuccessfully as a Progressive Conservative Party candidate for Parliament in the electoral district of Vancouver East in the 1984 election. In 1992–1993, he was an organizer for and supporter of David Varty, a candidate for the federal Liberal Party nomination in the electoral district of Vancouver Centre.
