<text>Immature (later known as IMx) is an American R&amp;B boy band, managed by record producer Chris Stokes. Its members include Marques &quot;Batman&quot; Houston (born August 4, 1981), Jerome &quot;Romeo&quot; Jones (born October 25, 1981), and Kelton &quot;LDB&quot; Kessee (born January 2, 1981), all natives of Los Angeles, where the group was formed. The group released four albums under the Immature moniker: &quot;On Our Worst Behavior&quot; (1992; the only album to include original member Don &quot;Half Pint&quot; Santos, later replaced by Kessee), &quot;Playtyme Is Over&quot; (1994), &quot;We Got It&quot; (1995) and &quot;The Journey&quot; (1997).

In 1999, the group changed its name to IMx, marking ten years of being a group and released two studio albums &quot;Introducing IMx&quot; and &quot;IMx&quot;, as well as a &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album in 2001. The group also branched out into film (such as &quot;House Party 3&quot; and &quot;House Party 4: Down to the Last Minute&quot;) and television (such as &quot;A Different World&quot;, &quot;Sister, Sister&quot;, &quot;Family Matters&quot;, &quot;Soul Train&quot; and &quot;All That&quot;) before disbanding in 2002. 

On November 6, 2013, Immature performed their first show since reuniting at Club Nokia in Los Angeles with Next and Dru Hill. In September 2019, Immature announced their &quot;#TBTour&quot; with special guests Ray J, B5 and J. Holiday.

==Biography==

Immature was formed in Los Angeles, California in 1991 by Marques &quot;Batman&quot; Houston, Jerome &quot;Romeo&quot; Jones and Don &quot;Half-Pint&quot; Santos. Kelton &quot;LDB&quot; Kessee (the group&#x27;s drummer) joined the group full-time in 1994, replacing Santos due to his parents pulling him from the group after they starred together in House Party 3. In 1999, the group would change their name to IMx, feeling Immature no longer reflected the band.

===After IMx===
In 2002, the group disbanded. Houston and Jones (under the name Young Rome) began pursuing solo careers, while Kessee continued his work as a record producer. Houston became the first former member to release a solo album, &quot;MH&quot;, in 2003. Jones followed suit with the release of his debut solo album, titled &quot;Food for Thought&quot;, in 2004. Houston later released five additional albums: &quot;Naked&quot; (2005), &quot;Veteran&quot; (2007), &quot;Mr. Houston&quot; (2009), &quot;Mattress Music&quot; (2010) and &quot;Famous&quot; (2013).

Houston and Jones have also pursued acting careers, with both starring in the dance film, &quot;You Got Served&quot; (2004). Houston co-starred in &quot;Fat Albert&quot; (2004) and landed a lead role in UPN&#x27;s comedy sitcom &quot;Cuts&quot;. In 2007, he starred in the horror film &quot;Somebody Help Me&quot;. He also appeared as Roger on the show &quot;Sister, Sister&quot; (1994–1998).

<text>Udo Proksch (29 May 1934 – 27 June 2001) was an Austrian businessman and industrialist. In 1991, he was convicted of the murder of six people as part of a major insurance fraud. Proksch died in prison.

==&quot;Lucona&quot; sinking==
In 1977, the ship &quot;Lucona&quot; sank in the Indian Ocean, after an explosion, killing six people. Proksch, the owner of the cargo, also then owner of famous Viennese confectioners&#x27; Demel, claimed US$20 million from his insurance company, saying that the ship was carrying expensive uranium mining equipment. Fraud was suspected; but investigations were obstructed by powerful Austrian politicians who were friends of Proksch.

In 1988, Proksch fled to the Philippines after Hans Pretterebner published a book about the scandal.

In 1989, he returned to Vienna incognito, but was recognized and arrested. In 1990, &quot;Lucona&quot; was located by American shipwreck hunter David Mearns, who discovered that the ship had been sunk by a time bomb.

On March 11, 1991, Proksch was sentenced to 20 years in prison. A year later, the sentence was increased to a lifelong term in prison. Several ex-ministers were also eventually convicted over their involvement. The ex-minister of foreign affairs was sentenced for forging documents authenticating the cargo. Two other ministers were dismissed for obstructing the investigations. The minister of defense Karl Lütgendorf, a shareholder in the Proksch firm, had given permission to deliver explosives to sabotage the ship; he killed himself when his role in the case became clear.

Proksch died on 27 June 2001, during heart surgery.

Proksch was the first husband of the actress Daphne Wagner, daughter of Wieland Wagner, great-granddaughter of the composer Richard Wagner and great-great-granddaughter of Franz Liszt.

# An transaction cannot be ratified by shareholders, even if they wish it to be ratified.
# The doctrine of estoppel usually precluded reliance on the defense of where the transaction was fully performed by one party.
# &quot;A fortiori&quot;, a transaction fully performed by both parties could not be attacked.
# If the contract was fully executory, the defense of might be raised by either party.
# If the contract was partially performed, and the performance was held insufficient to bring the doctrine of estoppel into play, a suit for quasi-contract for recovery of benefits conferred was available.
# If an agent of the corporation committed a tort within the scope of their employment, the corporation could not defend on the ground the act was .

Several modern developments relating to corporate formation have limited the probability that acts will occur. Except in the case of non-profit corporations (including municipal corporations), this legal doctrine is obsolescent; within recent years, almost all business corporations have been chartered to allow them to transact any lawful business. The Model Business Corporation Act of the United States states that: &quot;The validity of corporate action may not be challenged on the ground that the corporation lacks or lacked power to act.&quot; The doctrine still lives among non-profit corporations or state-created corporate bodies established for a specific public purpose, such as universities or charities.

===United Kingdom===

Historically all companies in the United Kingdom were subject to the doctrine of and any act which was outside of the objects specified in a company&#x27;s memorandum of association would be and void. That result was commercially unpalatable. It led to companies being formed with extremely wide and generic objects clauses permitting a company to engage in all manner of commercial activities. 

The position was changed by statute by the Companies Act 1985, which essentially abolished the doctrine concerning commercial companies. The position is now regulated by the Companies Act 2006, sections 31 and 39, which similarly significantly reduces the applicability of in corporate law. However, it can still apply to charities, and a shareholder may apply for an injunction, in advance only, to prevent an act which is claimed to be .

===United States===
According to American laws, the concept of can still arise in the following kinds of activities in some states:
# Charitable or political contributions
# Guaranty of indebtedness of another
# Loans to officers or directors
# Pensions, bonuses, stock option plans, job severance payments, and other fringe benefits
# The power to acquire shares of other corporations
# The power to enter into a partnership

===Other jurisdictions===
In many jurisdictions, such as Australia, legislation provides that a corporation has all the powers of a natural person plus others; also, the validity of acts which are made is preserved.

==Constitutional law==

Under constitutional law, particularly in Canada and the United States, constitutions give federal and provincial or state governments various powers. To go outside those powers would be ; for example, although the court did not use the term in striking down a federal law in &quot;United States v. Lopez&quot; because it exceeded the constitutional authority of Congress, the Supreme Court still declared the law to be .

According to Article 15.2 of the Irish constitution, the Oireachtas (parliament) is the sole lawmaking body in the Republic of Ireland. In the case of &quot;CityView Press v AnCo&quot;, however, the Supreme Court of Ireland held that the Oireachtas may delegate certain powers to subordinate bodies through primary legislation, so long as these delegated powers allow the delegatee only to further the principles and policies laid down by the Oireachtas in primary legislation and not craft new principles or policies themselves. Any piece of primary legislation that grants the power to make public policy to a body other than the Oireachtas is unconstitutional; however, as there is a presumption in Irish constitutional law that the Oireachtas acts within the confines of the constitution, any legislation passed by the Oireachtas must be interpreted in such a way as to be constitutionally valid where possible.

Thus, in several cases where bodies other than the Oireachtas were found to have used powers granted to them by primary legislation to make public policy, the impugned primary legislation was read in such a way that it would not have the effect of allowing a subordinate body to make public policy. In these cases, the primary legislation was held to be constitutional. Still, the subordinate or secondary legislation, which amounted to creating public policy, was held to be the primary legislation and was struck down.

In UK constitutional law, describes patents, ordinances, and the like enacted under the prerogative powers of the Crown that contradict statutes enacted by the Crown-in-Parliament. Almost unheard of in modern times, acts by the Crown or its servants were previously a major threat to the rule of law.

&quot;Boddington v British Transport Police&quot; is an example of an appeal heard by the House of Lords that contested that a by-law was beyond the powers conferred to it under section 67 of the Transport Act 1962.

==Administrative law==
In administrative law, an act may be judicially reviewable for in a narrow or broad sense. Narrow applies if an administrator did not have the substantive power to make a decision or it was wrought with procedural defects. Broad applies if there is an abuse of power (e.g., Wednesbury unreasonableness or bad faith) or a failure to exercise an administrative discretion (e.g., acting at the behest of another or unlawfully applying a government policy) or application of discretionary powers in an irrational and wrong way. Either doctrine may entitle a claimant to various prerogative writs, equitable remedies or statutory orders if they are satisfied.

===United Kingdom===
In the seminal case of &quot;Anisminic v Foreign Compensation Commission&quot;, Lord Reid is credited with formulating the doctrine of . However, , together with unreasonableness, was mentioned much earlier by Lord Russell in the well-known case, &quot;Kruse v Johnson&quot;, regarding challenging by-laws and other rules. &quot;Anisminic&quot; is better known for not depriving courts of their jurisdiction to declare a decision a nullity, even if a statute expressly prevents it from being subject to judicial review. Further cases such as &quot;Bromley LBC v Greater London Council&quot; and &quot;Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service&quot; have sought to refine the doctrine.

In &quot;Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough Council v Hazell&quot;, the House of Lords held that interest rate swaps entered into by local authorities (a popular method of circumventing statutory restrictions on local authorities borrowing money at that time) were all and void, sparking a raft of satellite litigation.

Mark Elliott (St Catharine&#x27;s College, Cambridge) proposes a modified doctrine for administrative law, placing it firmly in the correct constitutional setting.

<doc id="1161828" wikidata="Q3505209" url="?curid=1161828" title="Nokia 9000 Communicator">
<text>The Nokia 9000 Communicator mobile device is the first product in Nokia&#x27;s Communicator series, announced at CeBIT 1996 and introduced into the market on five months later, 15 August 1996. It is powered by an AMD Elan 24 MHz Intel i386 CPU, with 8 MB of memory, divided between applications (4 MB), program memory (2 MB) and user data (2 MB), running PEN/GEOS 3.0.

The Communicator, with its digital GSM cellular telephone, was one of the earliest smartphones on the market, after the IBM Simon in 1994 and the HP OmniGo 700LX, a DOS-based palmtop PC with integrated cradle for the Nokia 2110 cellular mobile phone, announced in late 1995 and shipped in March 1996.

The Communicator was highly advanced at the time, featuring sending and receiving e-mail and fax via its CSD (Circuit Switched Data) modem, to transmit data over the GSM network at a bitrate of 9.6 kbit/s, printing documents using its IrDA port, and it also had a web browser and business programs. It is formed of a clamshell design that opens up to reveal a monochrome LCD with a 640 × 200 resolution and a full QWERTY keyboard similar to a Psion PDA, and weighing . It was priced £1,000 in the UK upon launch ().

== 9110 ==

The Nokia 9110 Communicator is the updated model of the Nokia 9000 Communicator in the Communicator series.
Its biggest change from the 9000 was that it weighed much less, but also had a newer i486-based processor.

=== Specifications ===
* Operating system: GEOS (running on top of ROM-DOS) on the PDA side
* Main applications: Fax, short messages, email, Wireless imaging: digital camera connectivity, Smart messaging, TextWeb, Web browser, Serial Terminal, Telnet, Contacts, Notes, Calendar, Calculator, world time clock, Composer. 
* Display: 640 × 200 Pixels
* Size: 158 mm × 56 mm × 27 mm
* Weight: 253 g
* Processor: Embedded AMD Élan SC450 Am486 processor at 33 MHz
* Memory: 8 MB total, 4 MB Operating System and applications, 2 MB program execution, 2 MB user data storage, MMC card.

== Reception and legacy ==
Then-CEO of Nokia, Jorma Ollila, said in 2012 regarding the device: &quot;We were five years ahead.&quot;

=== Awards ===
The Nokia 9000 Communicator received several awards including:
*GSM World Award (for innovation) at GSM World Conference 1997
*Best Technological Advance by &quot;Mobile News UK&quot;
*Best New Product 1997 by &quot;Business Week&quot; magazine

=== Successors ===
The product line was discontinued in 2000 with the introduction of Nokia 9210 Communicator which introduced a wide TFT colour internal screen, 32-bit ARM9-based RISC CPU at 52 MHz, 16 MB of internal memory, enhanced web abilities and most importantly saw the operating system change to the Symbian operating system. The 9210i launched in 2002 increased the internal memory to 40 MB, video streaming and flash 5 support for the web browser.

The 9xxx Communicators introduced features which later evolved into smartphones.

==In popular culture ==
The Nokia 9000 is used by Val Kilmer when he played Simon Templar in the 1997 remake of &quot;The Saint&quot;, and by Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock in the action comedy &quot;Bad Company&quot;.

The phone is also mentioned in Bret Easton Ellis&#x27; book &quot;Glamorama&quot;.

<doc id="1161836" wikidata="Q637692" url="?curid=1161836" title="Spirit (Jewel album)">
<text>Spirit is the second studio album by American singer-songwriter Jewel, released on November 17, 1998, by Atlantic Records. Singles include &quot;Hands&quot;, &quot;Down So Long&quot;, and a newly recorded version of &quot;Jupiter&quot;, followed by a remix of &quot;What&#x27;s Simple Is True&quot; to promote Jewel&#x27;s debut film &quot;Ride with the Devil&quot;. In addition, a one-track CD containing a live version of &quot;Life Uncommon&quot; was released to music stores in hopes to raise money and awareness for Habitat for Humanity.

&quot;Spirit&quot; debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 with 368,000 copies sold in its first week. It went on to sell 3.7 million units in the United States.

==Composition==
Kilcher began writing material for &quot;Spirit&quot; after the release of &quot;Pieces of You&quot; in 1995. In 1996, she recorded six songs with producer Peter Collins, but scrapped the tracks after singles from her debut album, &quot;Pieces of You&quot;, began to receive significant radio play.

In a 1998 interview, she divulged that the song &quot;Fat Boy&quot; was written about a boy she grew up with who committed suicide on her family&#x27;s property in Alaska: &quot;There was a note [he left] that said some thing along the lines of, &#x27;Nobody will love me.&#x27; And to know that you&#x27;re not sexually attractive in our society at age thirteen or to feel that you won&#x27;t ever be loved at age eighteen is just devastating.&quot; She also stated that the song &quot;Hands&quot; was written based on the notion of: &quot;if I watch what my hands do, I&#x27;d have a better idea of what I was thinking, consciously or subconsciously.&quot;

==Recording==
&quot;Spirit&quot; was recorded at Groove Masters in Santa Monica, California, and Ocean Way Recording in Hollywood. Jewel recorded the album with producer Patrick Leonard (who frequently had worked with Madonna), who added percussive undercurrents and keyboards to the guitar-based tracks.

==Reception==
David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote of the album: &quot;With her dulcet voice and lulling refrains, Jewel makes the social and political ills of the world go down easy. But in doing so, she unintentionally confounds the problem, since her honeyed background-music folk makes issues of life and death appear more benign and less worrisome than they are. Jewel truly has brought topical folk songs into the modern age: She makes complacent rabble-rousers.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Rob Sheffield felt that while &quot;Jewel&#x27;s sincere sentiment has its attractions in a time of irony overload&quot;, she &quot;spends most of &quot;Spirit&quot; straining for grand meaning-of-life statements.&quot;

Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; compared Jewel&#x27;s vocal mannerisms on the album to those of Joni Mitchell, Stevie Nicks, Michael Stipe, and Rickie Lee Jones, adding that &quot;half the songs... reach an otherworldly tenderness, redeeming the lyrics through the grace of the music.&quot; Wendy Brandes of CNN praised Jewel&#x27;s vocals on the album, though added: &quot;In the funky, accusatory &#x27;Who Will Save Your Soul&#x27; on the first album, Jewel dropped to a growl to ask, &#x27;Who will save your soul after the lies that you told, boy.&#x27; Songs in the new collection such as &#x27;Hands&#x27; and &#x27;Kiss the Flame&#x27; are, by contrast, pleasant folky confections that don&#x27;t distinguish themselves musically or lyrically.&quot;

<doc id="1161838" wikidata="Q3240534" url="?curid=1161838" title="League of the South">
<text>The League of the South (LS) is an American white nationalist, neo-Confederate, white supremacist organization that says its goal is &quot;a free and independent Southern republic&quot;.

Headquartered in Killen, Alabama, the group defines the Southern United States as the states of the Confederacy: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, Tennessee, and Virginia. It claims to also be a religious and social movement, advocating a return to a more traditionally conservative, Christian-oriented Southern culture.

The movement and its members are allied with the alt-right. The group was part of the neo-Nazi Nationalist Front formerly alongside the National Socialist Movement (NSM), the now-defunct Traditionalist Workers Party (TWP) and Vanguard America (VA, since rebranded as Patriot Front). The group helped organize the Pikeville rally in Pikeville, Kentucky; the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia; and the White Lives Matter rally in Shelbyville, Tennessee. The Southern Poverty Law Center has designated it as a hate group.

==History==
The organization was formed in 1994 by Michael Hill and others, including attorney Jack Kershaw and Libertarian historian Thomas Woods. The League of the South was named in reference to the League of United Southerners, a group organized in 1858 to shape Southern public opinion and the Lega Nord (Northern League), a successful populist movement in Northern Italy from which the group took inspiration.

The League&#x27;s first meeting included 40 men, 28 of whom formed The Southern League. Two years later, they changed the name to The League of the South to avoid confusion with the Southern League of Minor League Baseball. Among the early members were Southern professors, including its president Michael Hill, a British history professor and specialist in Celtic history at Stillman College, a historically black school in Tuscaloosa. Hill has since left his teaching position.

In 2000, the group supported Pat Buchanan and the Reform Party.

In time, the group&#x27;s views became more extreme; by 2004, founding members Grady McWhiney and Forrest McDonald had denounced Hill&#x27;s leadership and left the organization.

Since 2007, The League&#x27;s main publication has been &quot;The Free Magnolia&quot;, a quarterly tabloid.

==Views==

The League has been described as using &quot;Celtic&quot; mythology &quot;belligerently against what is perceived as a politically correct celebration of multicultural Southern diversity&quot;.

The group believes that the Southern United States should be an independent country ruled by white men.

In 2001, they asked the U.S. Congress to pay $5 billion in reparations for &quot;property&quot; (including enslaved human beings) taken or destroyed by Union forces during the Civil War. The group&#x27;s legal counsel Jack Kershaw said their proposal included paying reparations to African-Americans due to the supposed negative effect the end of slavery had on their ancestors: &quot;Blacks were better off in antebellum times in the South than they were anywhere else. [...] They lost a lot too when that lifestyle was destroyed.&quot;

===Culture===
The League defines Southern culture as profoundly Christian and anti-abortion. The League describes Southern Culture as being inherently Anglo-Celtic in nature (originating in the British Isles), and they believe the South&#x27;s core Anglo-Celtic culture should be preserved.

According to the League, the South has had a Marxist and egalitarian society &quot;impressed upon it&quot;. The &quot;League&#x27;s Core Beliefs Statement&quot; advocates the stigmatization of &quot;perversity and all that seeks to undermine marriage and the family.&quot;

===Politics===
The League believes that what it calls &quot;the Southern people&quot; have the right to secede from the United States, and that they &quot;must throw off the yoke of imperial [federal, or central government] oppression&quot;. The League promotes a Southern Confederation of sovereign, independent States. The League favors strictly limited immigration, opposes standing armies and any regulation whatsoever of firearms. This proposed independent nation is described by League publications as part of a process to convince &quot;the Southern people&quot; that they have a unique identity.

The League focuses on recruiting and encouraging &quot;cultural secession&quot;. In November 2006 its representatives attended the First North American Secessionist Convention of secessionists from different parts of the country. In October 2007 it co-hosted the Second North American Secessionist Convention in Chattanooga, Tennessee.

In 2015, the group announced it would be holding an event celebrating the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, while honoring John Wilkes Booth as a hero. On April 11, 2015, it was organized by the vice chairman of the Maryland-Virginia chapter of the League, Shane Long. The LOS&#x27;s main Facebook page put it bluntly: &quot;Join us in April to celebrate the great accomplishment of John Wilkes Booth. He knew a man who needed killing when he saw him!&quot;

The League has attempted to form paramilitary groups on more than one occasion.

The League of the South is opposed to fiat currency, personal income taxation, central banking, property taxes and most state regulation of business. The League supports sales taxes and user fees.

== Designation as hate group ==
In the summer of 2000, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) designated the League of the South as a hate group, citing the group&#x27;s &quot;academic veneer&quot; of revisionist history and calls for secession. Hill dismissed the designation as politically motivated.

According to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), the League of the South is a white supremacist group which promotes racism and anti-Semitism through events held with other white supremacist groups. The League of the South joined the Nationalist Front, a loose coalition of neo-Nazis and other white supremacists, in 2017.

==Members==
The League&#x27;s board of directors is composed of Michael Hill, Mark Thomey, Mike Crane, Sam Nelson, and John Cook. Among the founding members were Thomas Fleming, Thomas Woods, Grady McWhiney, Clyde Wilson, and Forrest McDonald.

<doc id="1161845" wikidata="Q1968177" url="?curid=1161845" title="Om Namah Shivaya">
<text>Om Namah Shivaya (Devanagari: ; IAST: Oṃ Namaḥ Śivāya) is one of the most popular Hindu mantras and the most important mantra in Shaivism. Namah Shivaya means &quot;O salutations to the auspicious one!&quot;, or &quot;adoration to Lord Shiva&quot;. It is called [[Shiva Panchakshara Stotra|Siva Panchakshara]], or Shiva Panchakshara or simply Panchakshara meaning the &quot;five-syllable&quot; mantra (viz., excluding the &quot;Om&quot;) and is dedicated to Shiva. This Mantra appears as &#x27;Na&#x27; &#x27;Ma&#x27; &#x27;Śi&#x27; &#x27;Vā&#x27; and &#x27;Ya&#x27; in the Shri Rudram Chamakam which is a part of the Krishna Yajurveda and also in the Rudrashtadhyayi which is a part of the Shukla Yajurveda.

==Origin of the mantra==

The mantra without the initial Om was originally a verse in the eighth hymn of the &quot;Namakam&quot; section of the &quot;Shri Rudram&quot;, (TS 4.5.8.1) itself taken from the Taittirīya Samhita, a recension of the Black Yajurveda. It appears as, &quot;Namaḥ śivāya ca śivatarāya ca&quot; (Sanskrit: ). The English translation of the mantra is, &quot;Salutation to the auspicious one and to the more auspicious&quot;.

This mantra also appears in the &quot;Rudrashtadhyayi&quot;, a part of the Shukla Yajurveda. In the &quot;Rudrashtadhyayi&quot;, it appears in the 5th chapter (also known as Namakam) verse 41.

==Translations among different traditions==
Namah Shivaya means &quot;Adoration to Lord Shiva&quot;; this is preceded by the devotional syllable &quot;Om&quot;.

In Siddha Shaivism and Shaiva Siddhanta Shaivism traditions, Namah Shivaya is considered as Pancha Bodha Tatva of Lord Shiva and his universal oneness of five elements:

* &quot;Na&quot; sound represents earth
* &quot;Ma&quot; sound represents water
* &quot;Śi&quot; sound represents fire
* &quot;Vā&quot; sound represents Pranic air
* &quot;Ya&quot; sound represents sky or ether

Its total meaning is that &quot;universal consciousness is one&quot;.


In Shaiva Siddhanta, the five letters also represent:

* &quot;Na&quot; is the Lord&#x27;s concealing grace
* &quot;Ma&quot; is the world
* &quot;Śi&quot; stands for Shiva
* &quot;Vā&quot; is His revealing grace
* &quot;Ya&quot; is the Ātman or soul

The &quot;Tirumantiram&quot; (a scripture in Shaiva Siddhanta) announces that &quot;His feet are the letter Na. His navel is the letter Ma. His shoulders are the letter Śi. His mouth, the letter Vā. His radiant cranial center aloft is Ya. Thus is the five-lettered form of Shiva.&quot;: Tirumantiram 941. TM
==In different scriptures==

# The Mantra appears as &#x27;Na&#x27; &#x27;Ma&#x27; &#x27;Śi&#x27; &#x27;Vā&#x27; and &#x27;Ya&#x27; in the Shri Rudram Chamakam which is a part of the Krishna Yajurveda. Thus predates the use of &quot;Shiva&quot; as a proper name, in the original context being an address to Lord Rudra (later Shiva), where Shiva retains its original meaning as an adjective, meaning &quot;auspicious, benign, friendly&quot;, a euphemistic epithet of Rudra.
# The mantra appears in the Rudrashtadhyayi which is a part of the Shukla Yajurveda.
# Whole Panchakshara Stotra is dedicated to this mantra.
# Tirumantiram, a scripture written in Tamil language, speaks of the meaning of the mantra.
# It appears in the Shiva Purana in the chapter 1.2.10 (Shabda-Brahma Tanu) and in its Vidyeshvara samhita and in chapter 13 of the &quot;Vayaviya samhita&quot; of the Shiva Purana as Om Namaḥ Śivāya. It is also referenced many times throughout the Śiva Purana as the &quot;5 syllable Mantra&quot; and &quot;6 syllable mantra&quot; when including Om. 
# The Tamil Saivaite hymn Tiruvacakam begins with the five letters &#x27;Na&#x27; &#x27;Ma&#x27; &#x27;Śi&#x27; &#x27;Vā&#x27; and &#x27;Ya&#x27;.

<doc id="1161869" wikidata="Q305314" url="?curid=1161869" title="South African National Defence Force">
<text>The South African National Defence Force (SANDF) comprises the armed forces of South Africa. The Chief of the SANDF is appointed by the President of South Africa from one of the armed services. They are in turn accountable to the Minister of Defence and Military Veterans of the Defence Department.

The military as it exists today was created in 1994, following South Africa&#x27;s first nonracial election in April of that year and the adoption of a new constitution. It replaced the South African Defence Force and also integrated uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK), and the Azanian People&#x27;s Liberation Army (APLA) guerilla forces.

==History==
===Integration process===

In 1994, the SANDF took over the personnel and equipment from the SADF and integrated forces from the former Bantustan homelands forces, as well as personnel from the former guerrilla forces of some of the political parties involved in South Africa, such as the African National Congress&#x27;s Umkhonto we Sizwe, the Pan Africanist Congress&#x27;s Azanian People&#x27;s Liberation Army and the Self-Protection Units of the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP). The Azanian People&#x27;s Organisation&#x27;s AZANLA was invited but refused to be integrated and to this day remains the only guerrilla force not integrated into the current force.

As of 2004, the integration process was considered complete, with retaining personnel, structure, and equipment from the SADF. However, due to integration problems, financial constraints, and other issues, the SANDF faced capability constraints.

The South African Commando System was a civil militia active until 2008, based upon local units from the size of company to battalion. In its final years its role was to support the South African Police Service during internal operations. During such deployments the units came under SAPS control.

===1999 re-armament===

In 1999, a R30 billion (US$4.8 billion) purchase of weaponry by the South African Government was finalised, which has been subject to allegations of corruption. The South African Department of Defence&#x27;s Strategic Defence Acquisition purchased frigates, submarines, light utility helicopters, lead-in fighter trainer and multirole combat aircraft.

===Decline===
Systemic public-sector corruption, State capture, (2011/12 to 2017) had a debilitating effect on Denel and consequently the country&#x27;s defence capability. In 2014 some 62% of the SANDF&#x27;s facilities and housing were deemed to be in unacceptable condition, of which 4% were hazardous, another 2% fit to be demolished, and some occupied by squatters. This contributed to low soldier morale and poor discipline. Equipment became largely obsolete due to inadequate maintenance, while renewal stalled with devastating effect on the defence industry. According to the Department of Defence&#x27;s 2014 Defence Review, the SANDF was &quot;in a critical state of decline&quot;. A series of cuts to its capital and operating budgets compromised a number of capabilities. 

In 2017 and 2021 respectively, 83 and some 200 to 500 out-of-service military vehicles were destroyed in fires at the Wallmansthal vehicle depot, and a spokesperson was not available to liaise with the press. Notwithstanding, it was reported to parliament in 2022, that technical skills gained from personnel of the Cuban RAF facilitated the preservation and maintenance of over 600,000 infantry weapons. Their mechanical and vehicular skills allowed for the inspection, repair, refurbishment and/or de-activation of vehicles in the special forces and the four arms of service fleets, besides the implementation of stock control and technical support measures, and the rehabilitation of army workshops and work stations.

After submissions to parliament by Armscor, earlier in 2022, a spokesman for the official opposition, the DA, stated that the country&#x27;s defence capability had been weakened to the extent that it was unprepared for a serious security challenge. The Navy and Air Force were highlighted as easy targets, as only one of the four frigates were serviceable, and none of the submarines, while only 46 of 217 fixed-wing aircraft were serviceable (with all VIP aircraft grounded), and only 27 of 87 helicopters. Budget and hardware constraints also compromised flight training and exercises, besides the retention of experienced pilots and personnel. The defence minister&#x27;s appointment of an Air Force chief, Wiseman Mbambo, who cannot fly a plane and doesn&#x27;t have a pilot&#x27;s licence was also criticized. The SANDF had only 14 infantry battalions consisting of 12,000 soldiers in aggregate, of which five were deployed in peacekeeping and border patrol, leaving only nine to serve as home or rapid response units. 

In February 2022 the power supply to its Navy headquarters in Pretoria was disconnected when its municipal taxes were in arrears to the amount of R3.2 million. During the same month Sandu threatened legal action if the dilapidated Air Force headquarters building in Pretoria were not repaired to facilitate acceptable working conditions. In March 2022 the SANDF and Navy were locked out of several office buildings in Pretoria due to rent defaults by the Department of Public Works. 63% of the 2022/23 defence budget was allocated to employee compensation.

In 2022 the SANDF was involved in multiple corruption scandals totaling R2 billion; one of which involved 56 SANDF personnel two of whom were generals all of whom were suspended. An additional 13 SANDF personal from the Logistics, Joint Operations and Special Forces divisions were convicted for corruption in another incident. 

===Domestic operations===

, the SANDF was involved in several internal operations, including:
* Safeguarding the border (Operation CORONA)
* Disaster relief and assistance (Operation CHARIOT) 
* Safety and security (Operation PROSPER)
* Ridding the country of illegal weapons, drug dens, prostitution rings and other illegal activities (Operation FIELA)

In 2021, SANDF forces were deployed in response to the civil unrest following the jailing on corruption charges of former president Jacob Zuma. By 14 July, over 25,000 troops had been deployed, the largest single deployment of the South African National Defence Force since 1994.

===International operations===

The SANDF partakes in UN peacekeeping missions, mostly on the African continent. As part of the SADC standby force, it partakes in peace missions in the DRC and northern Mozambique. It also provides foreign election security when needed.

==Organisation and structure==
Overall command is vested in an officer-designated Chief of the SANDF (CSANDF). Appointed from any of the Arms of Service, they are the only person in the SANDF at the rank of General or Admiral, and are accountable to the Minister of Defence and Veteran Affairs, who heads the Department of Defence.

The structure of the SANDF is depicted below:

In 2010, a Defence Amendment Bill created a permanent National Defence Force Service Commission (NDFSC), a body that will advise the Minister of Defence and Military Veterans on the improvement of conditions of service of members of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF).

Members of the Commission include the Chiefs of the service arms, as well as the Chief of Defence Intelligence and the Chief of Joint Operations.

Four armed services make up the forces of the SANDF:

* South African Army
* South African Air Force
* South African Navy
* South African Military Health Service

The Joint Operations Division is responsible for co-ordinating all Joint Operations involving any or all of the four services. The South African Special Forces Brigade is the only organic unit under the direct command of the Joint Operations division. Unlike most other special forces it is not part of the Army or any other branch of the SANDF.

===Publications and access to records===
The SANDF publishes (or provides links) to documents describing its strategy, plans, performance, white papers and related government acts. Under the Promotion of Access to Information Act 2000 (PAIA), the SANDF also provides access to current and historical information the SANDF holds and provides a manual with procedures for obtaining access. Some categories of records are &quot;automatically available&quot; that are &quot;available without a person having to request access in terms of the PAIA. These records can be accessed at the Department of Defence Archives and include operational records of the 1st World War, 2nd World War, Korean War, and establishment of the Union Defence Force 1912.

==Military equipment and industry==

=== Military equipment ===
The SANDF possesses various foreign and domestically produced weapons. Most of its equipment comes from its own domestic military industry and some gear comes from foreign countries.

=== Defence industry ===
South Africa&#x27;s arms industry dates back to 1968 and was established primarily as a response to the international sanctions by the United Nations against South Africa due to apartheid, which began in 1963 and prevented the country from acquiring foreign combat systems until 1990. South Africa&#x27;s arms industry is the only arms industry in Africa capable of producing home-grown sophisticated military equipment, as of today it is considered one of the most advanced in the non-Western world rivalling great nations such as the USA, Russia, China and the European Union. The wide-ranging locally-made South African weapons and combat systems include Transport and Attack helicopters, Armoured personnel carriers, Main battle tanks, Missiles, Cruise missiles, Unmanned aerial vehicle, Military aircraft, infantry equipment and ships. Although the South African defence budget has been shrinking over the years and is now less than 1% of GDP against the international average of 2%, the military industry is largely exporting to survive and continues to develop world class military hardware. In 2021 The South African military industry exported R3.3 billion worth of weapons, ammunition and military equipment to 67 countries around the world.

=== Future ===

==== Project Hoefyster ====

Project Hoefyster was launched in 2013 to partially replace the South African Army&#x27;s ageing Ratel fleet with around 240 new generation Badger infantry fighting vehicles in a number of different variants over the next decade. A contract was placed with Denel Land Systems in 2013 for service entry by 2022.

The Badger is intended to be produced in nine different variants including a mortar variant, missile variant, section variant, signal variant, ambulance variant, command variant, fire support variant, and artillery variant. The section and fire support variants will be equipped with the 30 mm (30×173 mm) GI-30 cannon locally developed by Denel Land Systems. 

Deliveries were scheduled between 2019 and 2022 but problems at Denel have caused delay&#x27;s with no vehicles delivered to the South African Army, Armscor has recommended cancelling the contract and the funds to be spent on Ratel upgrades instead. Paramount Group believes a better alternative is to supply its Mbombe 8 infantry fighting vehicles to the South African Army which is a similar vehicle to the Badger as an immediately available and alternative to the long-delayed Badger vehicle. Project Hoefyster was deferred in November 2024 without any Badgers being delivered.

==== Projects Sepula and Vistula ====
The South African Army has deferred the acquisition of trucks and armoured vehicles to replace its Samil and Casspir fleets under Projects Sepula and Vistula as it explores domestic refurbishment and production. Project Vistula aimed to replace the Samil 50/100 4×4/6×6 truck fleet and Project Sepula aimed to replace the Casspir and Mamba armoured personnel carrier fleets of the South African Army.  

==== Projects Biro and Hotel ====

Project Biro will supply three new Warrior-class Multirole Inshore Patrols Vessels (MMIPVS) to the South African Navy to take over and replace the maritime coastal patrol function currently executed by the obsolete Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPVs) SAS Isaac Dyobha and SAS Makhanda.

The second future acquisition project for the SA Navy falls under Project Hotel, Project Hotel was initiated to replace the ageing SAS Protea, the SA Navy&#x27;s current hydrographic vessel which is more than 50 years old. The delivery of the South African Navy&#x27;s new Hydrographic Survey Vessel under Project Hotel has been delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the 2021 South African unrest, the vessel is expected to be delivered sometime between the end of 2023 or early 2024. The vessel will be equipped with the latest survey equipment which includes multi- and single beam echo-sounders as well as side-scan sonar and a seabed sampler to recover material from the seafloor and underlying sub-strata for detailed analytical and testing purposes.

==== Transport fleet upgrade ====
The South African Air Force&#x27;s top priority is to acquire new strategic airlift aircraft to replace its ageing C-130BZ Hercules. 

In 2005 South Africa became a partner in the A400M airlifter programme when it purchased eight (with an option for a further eight) of the transport aircraft. The first aircraft was due for delivery to the SAAF in 2010 but this was delayed with the aircraft scheduled to be delivered from 2013 or early 2014 onwards. The contract was terminated in 5 November 2009 due to extensive cost escalation and delays in the contractual delivery time.

As of 2023 The SAAF is deciding whether to upgrade its C-130BZ Hercules fleet or accept retired C-130Hs from the United States which would also need to be upgraded. The United Kingdom had offered to sell South Africa surplus C-130J Super Hercules while the US was offering excess C-130Hs.

==== Rooivalk Mk II ====

The South African Air Force plans to upgrade its current Rooivalk Mk I fleet to Mk II status. Around 2015, Denel has been promoting the Mk II upgrade of the Rooivalk for the South African Air Force. Support came from the South African government as the South African Air Force recognised a need for an upgrade as a result of known obsolescence. Future Rooivalk upgrades would introduce new modern avionics, update the weapon system and increase reproducibility. The next generation Rooivalk would feature better sights, improved firepower, greater payload and better survivability and other improvements. A minimum of 75 Rooivalk Mk II are planned to be produced.

==== Project Outcome ====

The Umkhonto GBADS is a South African vertical launching system that is being developed for the South African Army&#x27;s ground-based air defence system (GBADS) requirement under Project Outcome.

The missile system is intended to provide all-round protection for the armed forces against airborne threats, including attack aircraft, missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Denel Dynamics conducted the first test launch of the Umkhonto GBL system for the South African Army in October 2013. The system successfully fired three Umkhonto missiles during the test. In September 2016.

The naval variant of the Umkhonto missile system is in service with the navies of South Africa, Finland and Algeria.

==== Project Assegaai ====
The South African Air Force is getting the Denel Dynamics A-Darter fifth generation air-to-air missile under Project Assegaai, which will replace the interim Diehl Defence IRIS-T short range missile. An order for the 20 kilometre range A-Darter was placed in March 2015, with deliveries of operational missiles scheduled for 2017. Both South African Gripens and Hawk Mk 120s are being fitted with the missile while Brazil, which is a partner in development, may also acquire the weapon for its Gripen E/Fs.

==== UAV acquisitions ====
At the end of November 2022 the South African Air Force ordered Milkor 380 UCAVs. The Milkor 380 (MALE) UAV is the largest UAV to be manufactured in South Africa and on the African continent. It has an endurance of up to 35 hours of flight time and a payload capacity of 210 kg.

The South African Army is also seeking to acquire unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for reconnaissance and target acquisition.

==== Project Syne ====
The Navy&#x27;s four Valour-class frigates will receive a mid-life upgrade under Project Syne from 2017-18. Work will take place over a decade to extend the vessels&#x27; service lives beyond 2035. It is expected that the guns, combat management suite and radar system will be upgraded, amongst other items.

==== Project Radiate ====
All four branches of the South African National Defence Force are receiving new digital tactical communications equipment for complete interoperability between services under Project Radiate. Initial production orders for the complete system were placed with Reutech in the 2014/15 financial year and the first production equipment was due for delivery in the first quarter of 2016. Various components include HF, V/UHF, short range and intra platform communication systems.

== Foreign military relations ==
=== Brazil ===
Brazil-South Africa military relations have traditionally been close, in 2022 the Brazilian Armed Forces provided military assistance to the SANDF in the form of warfare training and logistics. Brazil and South Africa also collaborated on the A-Darter air-to-air missile project which will be used on both their JAS 39 Gripen fighter jets. Both countries are looking to further cooperate in missile development, notably on the 100 km range Marlin radar-guided air-to-air weapon which will feature a radar seeker head and will be developed into an all-weather surface-to-air missile (SAM) that can be used by South African and Brazilian Navies, In addition South Africa is also looking at collaborating with Brazil on a high speed target drone and a vertical takeoff and landing unmanned aerial vehicle (VTOL UAV). Both countries are part of the IBSA Dialogue Forum.

=== India ===
India and South Africa have also developed military cooperation, trading arms and joint exercises like IBSAMAR, which started in 2008 between India, Brazil, and South Africa and programs to train forces. During the 1990s South Africa developed the Bhim self-propelled howitzer to meet the Indian Army&#x27;s requirements for self-propelled artillery units. South Africa is looking at collaboration with Indian defence companies after a trade visit identified areas of cooperation that include ammunition, landward weapons, particularly artillery, cybersecurity, electronic warfare, unmanned aerial vehicles, robotics and artificial intelligence. Both countries are part of the IBSA Dialogue Forum.

== Personnel ==

On 31 March 2019, the demographics of service personnel were as follows:
* 55,866 (75%) Black
* 8,479 (11.4%) White
* 981 (1.3%) Indian
* 9,162 (12.3%) Coloureds
The gender split in the SANDF as of 31 March 2019 is as follows:
*51,684 men (69.4%)
*22,824 women (30.6%)

The target for female recruits increased to 40% in 2010.

==2012 Defence Review==

The South African Defence Review 2012 is a policy review process carried out by a panel of experts, chaired by retired politician and former Minister of Defence, Roelf Meyer. 

The review was commissioned by Lindiwe Sisulu the then Minister of Defence and Military Veterans, in July 2011. The review was motivated by the need to correct the errors and shortcomings of the previous review. According to defence minister Lindiwe Sisulu, the old report was no longer relevant to South Africa&#x27;s current situation.

<doc id="1161880" wikidata="Q841424" url="?curid=1161880" title="Chamber of Deputies (Italy)">
<text>The Chamber of Deputies () is the lower house of the bicameral Italian Parliament, the upper house being the Senate of the Republic. The two houses together form a perfect bicameral system, meaning they perform identical functions, but do so separately. The Chamber of Deputies has 400 seats, of which 392 are elected from Italian constituencies, and 8 from Italian citizens living abroad. Deputies are styled &quot;The Honourable&quot; (Italian: &quot;Onorevole&quot;) and meet at Palazzo Montecitorio.

==Location==

The seat of the Chamber of Deputies is the &quot;Palazzo Montecitorio&quot;, where it has met since 1871, shortly after the capital of the Kingdom of Italy was moved to Rome at the successful conclusion of the Italian unification &quot;Risorgimento&quot; movement.

Previously, the seat of the Chamber of Deputies of the Kingdom of Italy had been briefly at the &quot;Palazzo Carignano&quot; in Turin (1861–1865) and the &quot;Palazzo Vecchio&quot; in Florence (1865–1871). Under the Fascist regime of Benito Mussolini, the Chamber of Deputies was abolished and replaced by the figurehead Chamber of Fasces and Corporations from 1939 to 1943 (during World War II).

==Normal operation==
The Chamber is composed of all members meeting in session at the Montecitorio. The assembly also has the right to attend meetings of the Government and its ministers. If required, the Government is obliged to attend the session. Conversely, the Government has the right to be heard every time it requires.

The term of office of the House (as well as the Senate) is five years, but can be extended in two cases:
*The &quot;prorogatio&quot;, as provided by art. 61.2 of the Constitution, states that deputies whose terms have expired shall continue to exercise their functions until the first meeting of the new Chamber.
*An extension of the term, provided for by art. 60.2, can be enacted only in case of war.

==Electoral system==

The electoral system is a mixed-member majoritarian with 37% of seats allocated using first-past-the-post voting (FPTP) and 63% using proportional representation, allocated with the largest remainder method, with one round of voting.

The 400 deputies are elected in:
* 147 in single-member constituencies, by plurality;
* 245 in multi-member constituencies, by national proportional representation;
* 8 in multi-member abroad constituencies, by constituency proportional representation.

For Italian residents, each house members are elected by single ballots, including the constituency candidate and his supporting party lists. In each single-member constituency the deputy/senator is elected on a plurality basis, while the seats in multi-member constituencies will be allocated nationally. In order to be calculated in single-member constituency results, parties need to obtain at least 1% of the national vote. In order to receive seats in multi-member constituencies, parties need to obtain at least 3% of the national vote. Elects from multi-member constituencies will come from closed lists.

The single voting paper, containing both first-past-the-post candidates and the party lists, shows the names of the candidates to single-member constituencies and, in close conjunction with them, the symbols of the linked lists for the proportional part, each one with a list of the relative candidates.

The voter can cast his vote in three different ways:

* Drawing a sign on the symbol of a list: in this case the vote extends to the candidate in the single-member constituency which is supported by that list.
* Drawing a sign on the name of the candidate of the single-member constituency and another one on the symbol of one list that supports them: the result is the same as that described above; it is not allowed, under penalty of annulment, the panachage, so the voter can not vote simultaneously for a candidate in the FPTP constituency and for a list which is not linked to them.
* Drawing a sign only on the name of the candidate for the FPTP constituency, without indicating any list: in this case, the vote is valid for the candidate in the single-member constituency and also automatically extended to the list that supports them; if that candidate is however connected to several lists, the vote is divided proportionally between them, based on the votes that each one has obtained in that constituency.

Article 61 of the Italian Constitution maintains that elections for the Chamber of Deputies must take place within 70 days of the dissolution of the house, and that representatives must convene within 20 days of those elections.

==President==

The President of the Chamber of Deputies () performs the role of speaker of the house and is elected during the first session after the election. During this time the prerogatives of speaker are assumed by the vice president of Chamber of Deputies of the previous legislature who was elected first. If two were elected simultaneously, the oldest deputy serves as president of Chamber of Deputies.

The President of Chamber of Deputies has also the role of President during the Parliament joint sessions, when the upper and lower houses have to vote together.

Lorenzo Fontana is the current president of the Chamber of Deputies.

== Membership ==

The Chamber has 400 members. They were most recently elected at the 2022 general election.

== Reform proposals ==
In 2019, the Italian parliament passed a constitutional law that reduces the number of the deputies from 630 to 400. The law was approved on 21 and 22 September 2020 by a referendum.

The 19th Legislature was the first in which the Chamber of Deputies had 400 members.

<text>Norwalk High School is a high school located in Norwalk, Connecticut, United States, which was established in 1902. It is the oldest high school in Norwalk and was originally housed in the current Norwalk City Hall. The first graduating class for the current building was in 1975.

== Background ==
The school mascot is a bear and the school colors are green and white. Its crosstown rival is Brien McMahon High School and the two schools compete in an annual football game on Thanksgiving. The $4.2 million Shea-Magrath Sports Complex, which includes the astroturf Testa Field, sits just to the south of the school. It replaced Andrews Field, located 1/4 mile west of the school. The school is a member of the FCIAC athletic conference. The school also contains a theater, gymnasium, swimming pool, library, and cafeteria.

The school is divided into five lettered houses (A, B, D, and S) with a housemaster in charge of students in his/her house. Norwalk High School also has a Science wing that was built in the mid-late 2000s. Students are assigned lockers, homerooms, and guidance counselors within their house.

== Athletics ==
The NHS Bears girls&#x27; basketball team won the FCIAC championship in 1999, and then lost in the Class LL state championship in 1999. They then won another FCIAC championship in 2007, and won the Class LL state championship in 2019.

The NHS Bears boys&#x27; soccer team won the 2002 FCIAC championship. They then advanced to the FCIAC championship and Class LL state championship in 2004. The NHS Bears boys&#x27; team won the 2012 FCIAC state championship, and played for the FCIAC championship again in 2021. 

The NHS Bears baseball team won the FCIAC championship in 2002.

<text>The Honda CBR900RR, or FireBlade in some countries, is a sport bike, part of the CBR series introduced in 1992 by Honda. It was the first of a series of large-displacement Honda models to carry the RR suffix. The development of the first generation CBR900RR was led by Tadao Baba.

==History==

===CBR900RR (893cc) SC28===
The first generation CBR900RR was introduced in 1992 with an inline-four engine. It set a precedent for lightweight in the superbike class, being much lighter than other large-displacement bikes of the time. The CBR900RR was based on an advanced research stage model known within Honda as the &quot;CBR750RR&quot;. With the objective of equaling the acceleration of competitors’ flagship sport bikes, Honda increased the stroke of its inline 4-cylinder 750 cc engine and thus raised displacement to 893cc. Complementing its power performance was the bike&#x27;s dry weight of just 185 kg, wheelbase of 1,405 mm, and a body almost identical to that of the advanced research stage model. At wet weight, it was by just heavier than the CBR600F2, while the next-lightest over-750cc machine, the Yamaha FZR1000, was heavier by .

Changes for the 1994 model comprise a new shift-drum to improve notchy gear shifts. The second-generation CBR900RR, which debuted in 1995, incorporated changes in damping rates and spring rates. The front fork was upgraded with a compression adjuster. The upper cowl stay went from steel to aluminum, and the cylinder head cover went from aluminum to magnesium. The styling of the bike also became more aggressive: The independent dual lights became irregular-shaped multi-reflector lights known as &quot;fox eyes&quot; set further back and covered to improve aerodynamics, and the bike had fewer of the RR&#x27;s unique fairing &quot;speed&quot; holes. The footpegs were firmer and slimmer like that of the RC45 and the reversed pedal on the original was replaced with a shift linkage. Instead of measuring speed from the front wheel, the speed is measured from the countershaft sprocket with an electronic speedometer.

===CBR900RR (919cc) SC33 ===
1996 brought major changes to the CBR900RR with the third generation CBR900RR. To optimize rigidity Honda revised the suspension and chassis. Larger thinner-walled extrusions for more torsional rigidity were used in the swingarm and frame, revised shock and fork internals, and raised swingarm pivot. The handlebars were raised by and swept back by five degrees to improve the riding position. A 1 mm (0.04 in) bore increase raised the engine displacement to . Other revisions included a smaller alternator, the addition of a throttle position sensor, extra clutch plates, and a larger exhaust.

The only changes for the 1997 model were graphics and colour options.

In 1998, Honda continued subtle refinements in the fourth generation CBR900RR&#x27;s chassis. It got a stiffer frame more like the original, offset on the triple clamp reduced by . It received a redesigned fairing, a new dual-reflector headlight design, new windscreen, mirrors, and rear cowl. The brakes got larger rotors on the front and new calipers and ergonomics were revised with raised footpegs. The engine got revised with 80 percent new internals in an effort to reduce friction and weight. Cylinders bore got an aluminum composites treatment and new pistons. A new instrument cluster includes an LCD tachometer and speedometer, and LCD readouts for temperature, odometer and two tripmeters. It also got a larger radiator and a new exhaust header in stainless steel.
===CBR929RR (929cc) SC44===
The fifth-generation CBR900RR, or CBR929RR in North America, was introduced in 2000. It has a completely new engine, more oversquare with lighter internals. The engine also featured fuel injection and larger valves set at a narrower angle. A new all-titanium exhaust system equipped with HTEV was incorporated. The swingarm is mounted to the engine with bracing under the engine. Larger front disk rotors 330 mm mounted were also fitted and the wheel diameter was increased from 16 inches to 17 inches. The new front fork now used upside-down construction.
===CBR954RR (954cc) SC50===
The sixth generation CBR900RR, or CBR954RR in North America and Japan, was introduced in 2002. The cylinder bore was enlarged from , increasing capacity to . Larger fuel injectors, larger radiator, re-mapped electronic fuel injection, and a more powerful ECU were added. The restyled bodywork and fairings gave a sleeker look. The frame as well as the swingarm were strengthened, and the footpegs raised to allow for greater lean angles. Front disc size increased to 330 mm. Dry weight was reduced to and the wet weight to . Power at the rear wheel is and torque.

John McGuinness won the Macau Grand Prix in 2001 riding a CBR954RR.

===Successor===
The CBR900RR was replaced by the CBR1000RR in 2004.

<text>Panayiotis Alexiou &quot;Peter&quot; Vagenas (born February 6, 1978) is an American former soccer player.

==High school and college==
Vagenas graduated from Saint Francis High School in La Cañada Flintridge, class of 1996, where he played for coach Glen Appels and captained the team to a CIF Southern Section Championship his senior year, as well as being named CIF SS divisional player of the year. Vagenas played club soccer for Afshin Ghotbi. He played college soccer at UCLA from 1996 to 1999, leading them to the NCAA title in 1997, and finished his career there with 15 goals and 30 assists in 82 games. He was elected team MVP during his campaign at UCLA.

==Career==
===Professional===
Vagenas was drafted by Los Angeles Galaxy in the second round of the 2000 MLS SuperDraft and subsequently spent nine years with the team, winning the U.S. Open Cup in 2001 and 2005, and the MLS Cup in 2002 and 2005, captaining the team to the 2005 double. Vagenas missed most of 2007 and 2008 due to injury, but during his time with Galaxy he scored 14 goals and 12 assists in 183 league appearances, plus added two goals and two assists in the playoffs. He was a fan favorite with Galaxy due to his energetic play and local roots (earning him the nickname &quot;Pasadena Pete&quot;).

On November 26, 2008, Vagenas was selected by Seattle Sounders FC in the 2008 MLS Expansion Draft.

After two seasons with Seattle, Vagenas was traded to Colorado Rapids on November 22, 2010. After the trade Colorado declined Vagenas&#x27;s contract option and he elected to participate in the 2010 MLS Re-Entry Draft.

Vagenas became a free agent in Major League Soccer when he was not selected in the Re-Entry draft; after a couple of months out of the game he signed for expansion side Vancouver Whitecaps FC in April 2011. At season&#x27;s end, Vancouver declined his 2012 contract option and he entered the 2011 MLS Re-Entry Draft. Vagenas was not selected in the draft and became a free agent.

He was signed by Chivas USA on February 22, 2012. His contract expired after 2012 and he made himself eligible for the 2012 MLS Re-Entry Draft in December 2012. Vagenas became a free agent after he went undrafted in both rounds of the draft.

===International===
Vagenas played for the United States in the 2000 Summer Olympics, scoring three goals, all on penalty kicks. He earned his first cap for the senior national team on October 25, 2000, against Mexico, but injuries have curtailed his appearances at the international level. He has earned three caps to date. He was also the captain and leading scorer in the 1999 Pan American Games in Canada for the USA national team.

==Statistics==

<doc id="1161910" wikidata="Q642123" url="?curid=1161910" title="Ashvin (month)">
<text>Ashvin or Ashwin or Ashwan (; ; ; ; ; Malay/Indonesian: &quot;Aswin&quot;; Thai: &quot;Asawin&quot;), also known as Aswayuja, is the seventh month of the lunisolar Hindu calendar, the solar Tamil calendar, where it is known as Aippasi, and the solar Indian national calendar. It is the sixth month of the solar Bengali calendar and the seventh of the lunar Indian calendar of the Deccan Plateau. It falls in the season of &quot;Sharada&quot;, or autumn. In Hindu astrology, Ashvin begins with the Sun&#x27;s enter into Virgo.

It overlaps with September and October of the Gregorian calendar and is the month in which Diwali, the festival of lights, is celebrated according to the amanta tradition (Diwali falls in Kartika according to the purnimanta tradition). In lunar religious calendars, Ashvin begins on the new moon or the full moon around the time of the September equinox.

==Etymology==
Ashvini is the first star that appears in the evening sky. In Indian astrology, it is the head of Aries, or the first of the 27 Nakshatra. Ashvin also stands for the divine twins, the Ashvins, the gods of vision, Ayurvedic medicine, the glow of sunrise and sunset, and the aversion of misfortune and sickness in Hindu mythology. &quot;Asawin&quot; is the Thai variant of Ashvin and stands for the warrior. The term is often translated into English as &quot;knight&quot;. The Ashvins are described as representing the &quot;blending of light and darkness&quot; during the twilight period.

==Festivals==
Several major Hindu holidays take place in Ashvin. Those are as follows:
# Navaratri (1-9 lunar Ashvin)
# Durga Puja (6-10 lunar Ashvin)
# Saraswati Puja in South India (8-10 lunar Ashvin) 
# Vijayadashami or Dussehra (10 lunar Ashvin), the last day of Navaratri
# Kojagiri Poornima (15 lunar Ashvin)
# Diwali festival (amanta tradition), including Dhanteras (28 lunar Ashvin), Naraka Chaturdasi (29 lunar Ashvin) and Lakshmi Puja (30 lunar Ashvin)
# Kali Puja (new moon of lunar Ashvin), which is held as per the lunar calendar, usually falls in this month.

==Regional variation==
According to the latest revised calendar of Bangladesh, Ashwin now consists of 31 days instead of 30 days. This revision went into effect on 16 October 2019.

Ashwin is known as &quot;aipasi&quot; (ஐப்பசி) in Tamil and begins when the sun enters Libra in October.

It&#x27;s also called &quot;kunwaar&quot; (कुँवार) month in eastern Uttar Pradesh &amp; western Bihar state.

<doc id="1161913" wikidata="Q560307" url="?curid=1161913" title="Nasr Abu Zayd">
<text>Nasr Hamid Abu Zayd (, ; also Abu Zaid or Abu Zeid; July 10, 1943 – July 5, 2010) was an Egyptian Quranic thinker, author, academic and one of the leading liberal theologians in Islam. He is famous for his project of a humanistic Quranic hermeneutics, which &quot;challenged mainstream views&quot; on the Quran, sparking &quot;controversy and debate.&quot; While not denying that the Quran was of divine origin, Zayd argued that it was a &quot;cultural product&quot; that had to be read in the context of the language and culture of seventh century Arabs, and could be interpreted in more than one way. He also criticized the use of religion to exert political power. In 1995 an Egyptian Sharia court declared him an apostate, this led to threats of death and his fleeing Egypt several weeks later. He later quietly returned to Egypt where he died.

Abu Zayd has been referred to as among &quot;the big names&quot; of the post-1967 Arab intellectual tradition.

== Early life ==
Nasr Hamid Abu Zayd was born in Quhafa, a small village some 120 km from Cairo, near Tanta, Egypt on July 10, 1943. Abu Zayd went through a traditional religious school system and was a Qāriʾ who could recite the Qur&#x27;an with the proper rules of recitation, and a Hafiz one who has memorized the Quran completely from a young age.

At the age of 12, Abu Zayd was imprisoned for allegedly sympathising with the Muslim Brotherhood. He was also influenced by the writings of Muslim Brotherhood revolutionary Islamist Sayyid Qutb, who was executed by the Egyptian state in 1966, but moved away from the ideas of the Brethren and Qutb as he grew older. After receiving technical training he worked for the National Communications Organization in Cairo. At the same time, he started studying at Cairo University, where he obtained his BA degree in Arabic Studies (1972), and later his MA (1977) and PhD degrees (1981) in Islamic Studies, with works concerning the interpretation of the Qur&#x27;an.

==Career==
In 1982, he joined the faculty of the Department of Arabic Language and Literature at Cairo University as an assistant professor. He became an associate professor there in 1987. From 1985 to 1989, he worked as a visiting lecturer at Osaka University of Foreign Studies in Japan.

In 1992 the process of his being considered for promotion to full professor at Cairo University morphed from a routine academic process into a &quot;legal nightmare for him and his wife.&quot; While he was eventually promoted, he was sued by conservative Muslims and a Court of Appeals declared him an apostate and divorced him from his wife. This was followed by calls for his death and exile to Europe where he obtained the position of Visiting Professor of Arabic and Islamic Studies at Leiden University. (see below)

In Europe he held the Ibn Rushd Chair of Humanism and Islam at the University for Humanistics, Utrecht, Netherlands, while still supervising MA and PhD students at the University of Leiden as well. He also participated in a research project on Jewish and Islamic Hermeneutics as Cultural Critique in the Working Group on Islam and modernity at the Institute of Advanced Studies of Berlin (Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin). In 2005, he received the Ibn Rushd Prize for Freedom of Thought, Berlin. His wife returned several times to Egypt for discussion on MA and PhD theses at the French department at Cairo University. Dr. Abu Zayd also returned several times to Egypt after 1995, but mostly to visit family.

==Death==
During a visit in Indonesia he was infected by an unknown virus, and was hospitalized in Cairo. He died at a Cairo hospital on July 5, 2010, at the age of 66. He was buried in his birthplace on the same day.

== Nasr Abu Zayd case ==
Zayd&#x27;s academic work on the Qur&#x27;an led to a lawsuit against him by conservative Muslim scholars. The subsequent hisbah trial led to him being declared an apostate (&quot;murtadd&quot;) by an Egyptian court. Since under Sharia law it is not permissible for a Muslim woman to be married to a non-Muslim man, the court also declared he could not remain married to his wife—Cairo University French Literature professor Dr. Ibtihal Younis. This decision, in effect, forced him out of his homeland.

=== Rejection of promotion ===
The Nasr Abu Zayd case began when he was refused a promotion for the post of full professor. In May 1992, Dr. Abu Zayd presented his academic publications to the Standing Committee of Academic Tenure and Promotion for advancement. Among his thirteen works in Arabic and other languages were &quot;Imam Shāfi&#x27;ī and the Founding of Medieval Ideology&quot; and &quot;The Critique of Religious Discourse&quot;. The committee presented three reports, two were in favor of the promotion of Dr. Abu Zayd. But the third one, written by Abdel-Sabour Shahin, a professor of Arabic linguistics at the Cairo Dar al- &#x27;Ulum, and a committee member, accused Abu Zayd of &quot;clear affronts to the Islamic faith,&quot; and rejected the promotion.

Despite the two positive reports, the Tenure and Promotion Committee voted against the promotion (seven votes to six), arguing that his works did not justify a promotion. The Council of the Arabic Department made a statement against the committee&#x27;s decision, and the Council of the Faculty of Arts criticized the committee report. Despite all that, the Council of Cairo University confirmed the decision of the committee report on 18 March 1993.

Not content with blocking the promotion, at the pulpit at Amr Ibn Al-`Aas Mosque where he was a preacher, Shahin publicly denounced Abu Zayd as an apostate (&quot;murtadd&quot;). Shortly thereafter a &quot;flood of vitriolic articles accusing him of heresy&quot; appeared in the &quot;mainstream, semi-state press&quot;.

Critics of the case have noted that Shahin&#x27;s interest in the beliefs of Abu Zayd may have been motivated by factors other than piety. In addition to being preacher during Friday Services at Cairo&#x27;s oldest mosque and a host of a number of television and radio programs about Islam, Shahin was active in Egypt&#x27;s ruling party as chairman of its religious committee. In addition:

Insiders also knew Shahine had been a consultant in the late 1980s to the Rayyan Investment Company. Rayyan had touted itself as an Islamic financial outfit, appealing to pious Muslims who believed that Islam forbids them to receive interest. It promised to pay them instead with Islamically sanctioned &quot;dividends.&quot; Badly run, the firm went bankrupt, depriving thousand of Egyptians of their life savings. In his book, Abu Zaid cited Rayyan as an example of how some Islamists used religious discourse for ulterior motives and material gain. Shahine had not been pleased with the criticism.

=== Forced divorce proceedings ===
In June (April according to another account), the case moved beyond Cairo University when a group of Islamists led by the former state official, Muhammad Samida Abu Samada and including Shahin, filed a lawsuit before the Giza Lower Personal Status Court (family court) in Cairo demanding the nullification of the marriage between Abu Zayd and his wife, Dr. Ibtihal Younis, arguing that Islamic law forbids a marriage between a Muslim woman and an apostate. (The couple were not notified but heard about the case first in the tabloid newspapers.)

The court case was filed through personal status law for divorce because in this area &quot;the Islamic Shari&#x27;a is still in force&quot; in Egyptian law.

Filing cases of &quot;hisbah&quot; against Muslims who violated a &quot;right of God&quot; and thus disturbed the public order was at one time the function of an official known as the &quot;muhtasib&quot; before that function had lapsed. The lawsuit by the Islamists resurrected &quot;hisbah&quot; and had the advantage that the plaintiffs did not have to be directly affected by a defendant&#x27;s alleged wrongdoing. The &quot;hisbah&quot; principles are stated in Article 89 and 110 of the Regulations Governing Sharia Courts in Egypt but were amended in 1998, too late to help Abu Zayd.

According to conservative Islamist scholars cited against Abu Zayd by the plaintiffs, the professor was an &quot;ignorant&quot; proponent of the Enlightenment &quot;who understand[s] freedom of thought to mean freedom to lead the people to infidelity&quot;. Another called Abu Zayd&#x27;s work &quot;cultural AIDS&quot; and &quot;intellectual terrorism.&quot; (This critic was himself assailed as an apostate several years later for his own religious writings.)

On 27 January 1994, the Giza Personal Status Court rejected the demand because the plaintiff had no direct, personal interest in the matter. However, on June 14, 1995, Cairo&#x27;s Court of Appeals reversed the lower court ruling in favor of the plaintiff, judge &#x27;Abd al-&#x27;Alim Musa (who had worked for several years in Saudi Arabia) found Abu Zayd to be an apostate, and declaring the marriage of Abu Zayd and Ibtihal Younis null and void.

====Reasoning of judgement====
Among other things the court declared that the verse authorizing the discriminatory jizya tax on non-Muslims &quot;is not subject to discussion&quot;, and that owning slave women is allowed under certain conditions by &quot; clear Qur&#x27;anic verses that we must follow&quot; Abu Zayd was also accused on not believing in &quot;jinn&quot; (genies).

The judgement stated that:

the defendant&#x27;s proposition that the requirement of Christians and Jews to pay &quot;jizyah&quot; (poll tax) constitutes a reversal of humanity&#x27;s efforts to establish a better world is contrary to the divine verses on the question of &quot;jizyah&quot;, in a manner considered by some, inappropriate, even for temporal matters and judgments notwithstanding its inappropriateness when dealing with the Qur&#x27;an and Sunnah, whose texts represent the pinnacle of humane and generous treatment of non-Muslim minorities. If non-Muslim countries were to grant their Muslim minorities even one-tenth of the rights accorded to non-Muslim minorities by Islam, instead of undertaking the mass murder of men, women, and children, this would be a step forward for humanity. The verse on &quot;jizyah&quot;, verse 29 of Surat al-Tawbah, which the defendant opposes, is not subject to discussion.
The judgment stated that the questioning by Abu Zayd of the permissibility in Islam of the ownership of slave girls, is &quot;contrary to all the divine texts which permit such provided that the required conditions are met&quot;, and that the legitimacy of owning slaves is considered &quot;religiously proven without doubt&quot;.

Court of Appeals head Judge &#x27;Abd al- &#x27;Alim Musa and his fellow jurists declared Abu Zayd to be &quot;a threat to national security, saying that by attacking Islam, he had attacked the state on which it is founded.&quot; The conservative religious interpretation of the court was evidenced a month after the ruling, when Judge Alim told an Egyptian magazine that Muslims are required to believe in spirits, devils, and the throne of God.

In examining Abu Zayd&#x27;s work and the charge against him of disbelieving in Jinn, scholar Michael Cook notes that Abu Zayd did not explicitly deny the existence of &quot;jinn&quot;, but explained their reason for being in the Qur&#x27;an as part of an appeal &quot;to existing Arab conceptions of communication between genies and humans&quot;. Since jinn &quot;were part of the culture of the Arabs at the time when the Quran was revealed&quot; (and still are very much a part of Arab folk culture), without their inclusion &quot;the notion of divine revelation&quot; would have been difficult to accept.

====Motivation====
In addition to Abu Zayd&#x27;s innovations in interpreting the Quran, his background as a critic of Islamic fundamentalism, and of Islamic investment companies in particular, (for one of which Abdel-Sabour Shahin had been a religious advisor), is thought to have played a part in motivating his opponents.

====Promotion at Cairo University====
The irony of the story occurred when Cairo University promoted Abu Zayd to full professor and the academic committee wrote:

After reviewing the works submitted by Dr. Abu-Zeid in his application for promotion, examining them both individually and as a whole, we have reached the following conclusion: his prodigious academic efforts demonstrate that he is a researcher well-rooted in his academic field, well-read in our Islamic intellectual traditions, and with a knowledge of all its many branches — Islamic principles, theology, jurisprudence, Sufism, Qur&#x27;anic studies, rhetoric and linguistics — He has not rested on the laurels of his in-depth knowledge of this field, but has taken a forthright, critical position. He does not attempt to make a critique until he has mastered the issues before him, investigating them by way of both traditional and modern methodologies. In sum he is a free thinker, aspiring only to the truth. If there is something urgent about his style, it stems from the urgency of the crisis which the contemporary Arab-Islamic World is witnessing and the necessity to honestly identify the ills of this world in order that an effective cure be found. Academic research should not be isolated from social problems, but should be allowed to participate in current debates and to suggest solutions to current dilemmas by allowing researchers to investigate and interpret as far as possible.

=== Reaction to decision ===
The decision provoked a great debate, criticism abroad because of the violation of fundamental human rights but anger against Abu Zayd and death threats in Egypt. Abu Zayd himself lamented, &quot;it took one week for my name to be cursed all over Egypt. Even in my village they were saying I was teaching heresies to the students...&quot;

====Death threats====
Shortly after the verdict was issued, a group of professors at al-Azhar University, the &quot;theological centre of Egypt&quot;, issued a joint statement calling for Abu Zayd&#x27;s execution. The Egyptian Islamic Jihad organization (which assassinated Egyptian president Anwar Sadat in 1981 and was engaged in a guerrilla war with the government at the time) issued a statement saying the professor should be killed for abandoning his Muslim faith. But calls for his death were not limited to insurgents. Even a newspaper published by the ruling political party of the ostensibly secular anti-fundamentalist regime, &quot;The Islamic Banner&quot;, declared that `execution` was a fitting penalty if Abu Zayd failed to repent. In addition Abu Zayd received threats in the mail, one promising &quot;No matter how much the police tries to protect you, you will not get away.&quot;

Dr. Nasr Abu Zayd was protected by the police, but belief in his apostasy was so widespread that even a police officer guarding his house referred to him as a &quot;kafir&quot; when asked about the situation by a neighbor of Abu Zayd.

====Case against decision====
The Court case was based on the alleged apostasy of Nasr Abu Zayd, hence the decision was based on Qur&#x27;anic punishment. But the Egyptian Penal Code did not recognize apostasy, and Civil Law restricts the proof of apostasy to two possibilities: either a certificate from a specialized religious institution certifying that the individual has converted to another religion, or a confession by the individual that he has converted. Neither had been provided. Nasr Abu Zayd never declared himself to be an apostate. In an interview, he explained:

I&#x27;m sure that I&#x27;m a Muslim. My worst fear is that people in Europe may consider and treat me as a critic of Islam. I&#x27;m not. I&#x27;m not a new Salman Rushdie, and don&#x27;t want to be welcomed and treated as such. I&#x27;m a researcher. I&#x27;m critical of old and modern Islamic thought. I treat the Qur&#x27;an as a &quot;naṣṣ&quot; (text) given by God to the Prophet Muhammad. That text is put into a human language, which is the Arabic language. When I said so, I was accused of saying that the Prophet Muhammad wrote the Qur&#x27;an. This is not a crisis of thought, but a crisis of conscience.

==== Exile ====

On 23 July 1995, the couple fled their homeland for an indefinite sabbatical. They flew to Madrid, then decided to go from Spain to the Netherlands, where he was invited to teach as a visiting professor at the Leiden University.
Abu Zayd explained,

I couldn&#x27;t take more than two months of around the clock security. Whenever someone came to visit they had to be cleared. Whenever I wanted to go out I had to coordinate with security. I couldn&#x27;t just go to a coffee shop with my friends and play a round of backgammon. What kind of life was that?

Though his books were not officially banned in Egypt, they were pulled from the library shelves of his alma mater.

On November 8, 1999, he filed a suit against the Egyptian justice minister, demanding that the 1996 ruling which annulled the marriage be declared illegal.

===Legacy===
The Egyptian government &quot;strived to ignore&quot; the case. There were only brief mentions of it in the state-run media and no government official spoke in his defense. However, in 1998, the regulations governing Sharia courts in Egypt were amended making it impossible for individuals to file lawsuits accusing someone of apostasy, leaving the issue to the prerogative of the prosecution office.

The action against Abu Zayd was not isolated. During the 1990s there were several assaults on liberal intellectuals and artists in Egypt and elsewhere in the Muslim world. Ahmed Sobhy Mansour was dismissed from Al-Azhar University and imprisoned for six months. This was based on a verdict reached by the university itself on the grounds that he rejected a fundamental tenet of Islam in his research of truth of some of Muhammad&#x27;s sayings, or Hadith. Egyptian Nobel laureate Naguib Mahfouz was stabbed in the neck by an Islamist in 1994, leaving him incapable of using his hand to write. Egyptian courts were the theatre of different lawsuits brought against intellectuals, journalists, and university professors such as Atif al-Iraqi, Ragaa al-Naqash, Mahmoud al-Tohami, and Youssef Chahine (for his film &quot;El-Mohager&quot;, &quot;The Emigrant&quot;).

Abu Zayd&#x27;s case has been described as demonstrating the &quot;coercive impulse behind much Islamism, as well as the unintended consequences of making concessions in its direction&quot;, as those conservatives calling for his killing included religious figures and media supposedly co-opted by the regime. Other became suspicious of &quot;collusion&quot; between &quot;violent rebels and the conservative Islamists&quot; who held &quot;senior positions in some of Egypt&#x27;s public institutions.&quot; Gilles Kepel) noted the case as a demonstration of how moderate and extremists Islamists could &quot;complemented one another&#x27;s actions&quot;. Rather than the moderates undermining the extremists as some had hoped, &quot;moderates&quot; (such as Abdel-Sabour Shahin and The Islamic Banner) would singled out victims as &quot;apostates&quot; who were then executed (or in Zayd&#x27;s case provided with a very credible threat of murder) by the extremists (such as Egyptian Islamic Jihad). The &quot;moderates&quot; would deplore fanaticism of the extremists in public, but plead &quot;attenuating circumstance&quot; on their behalf when the need arose.

His case has been compared to controversies over interpretation of the Quran involving Taha Hussein in the 1920s and Muhammad Ahmad Khalafallah in the 1940s. The fact that a well established/respected scholar like Abu Zayd &quot;suffered more concretely&quot; than the other two is an illustration of &quot;the gains made by Islamists in the last half of the 20th century.

== Thought ==
According to scholar Navid Kermani &quot;three key themes&quot; emerge from Abu Zayd&#x27;s work:
#to trace the various interpretations and historical settings of the single Qur&#x27;anic text from the early days of Islam up to the present;
#to demonstrate the &quot;interpretational diversity&quot; (&quot;al-ta &#x27;addud alta &#x27;wili&quot;) that exists within the Islamic tradition;
#and to show how this diversity has been &quot;increasingly neglected&quot; across Islamic history.
Abu Zayd saw himself as an heir to the Muʿtazila, &quot;particularly their idea of the created Qurʿān and their tendency toward metaphorical interpretation.&quot;

===Quran as text===
Abu Zayd strongly opposed the belief in a &quot;single, precise and valid interpretation of the Qur&#x27;an handed down by the Prophet for all times&quot;.

In his view, the Quran made Islamic Arab culture a `culture of the text` (&quot;hadarat al-nass&quot;) par excellence, but because the language of the Quran is not self-explanatory, this implied Islamic Arab culture was also a culture of interpretation (&quot;hadarat al-ta&#x27;wil&quot;). Abu Zayd emphasized &quot;intellect&quot; (&quot;`aql&quot;) in understanding the Quran, as opposed to &quot;a hermeneutical approach which gives priority to the narrated traditions [ hadith ]&quot; (&quot;naql&quot;). As a reflection of this Abu Zaid used the term &quot;ta&#x27;wil&quot; (interpretation) for efforts to understand the Quran, while in the Islamic sciences, the literature that explained the Quran was referred to as &quot;tafsir&quot; (commentary, explanation).

For Abu Zaid, interpretation goes beyond explanation or commentary, &quot;for without&quot; the Qur&#x27;an would not have meaning:

The [Qur&#x27;anic] text changed from the very first moment - that is, when the Prophet recited it at the moment of its revelation - from its existence as a divine text (&quot;nass ilahi&quot;), and became something understandable, a human text (&quot;nass insani&quot;), because it changed from revelation to interpretation (&quot;li-annahu tahawwala min al-tanzil ila al-ta&#x27;wil&quot;). The Prophet&#x27;s understanding of the text is one of the first phases of movement resulting from the text&#x27;s connection with the human intellect.

===Humanistic hermeneutics of the Quran===
From the beginning of his academic career, Abu Zaid developed a renewed hermeneutic view (the theory and methodology of text interpretation) of the Qur&#x27;an and further Islamic holy texts, arguing that they should be interpreted in the historical and cultural context of their time. The mistake of many Muslim scholars was &quot;to see the Qur&#x27;an only as a text, which led conservatives as well as liberals to a battle of quotations, each group seeing clear verses (when on their side) and ambiguous ones (when in contradiction with their vision)&quot;. But this type of controversy led both conservatives and liberals to produce authoritative hermeneutics. This vision of the Qur&#x27;an as a text was the vision of the elites of Muslim societies, whereas, at the same time, the Qur&#x27;an as &quot;an oral discourse&quot; played the most important part in the understanding of the masses.

Nasr Abu Zayd called for another reading of the holy book through a &quot;humanistic hermeneutics&quot;, an interpretation which sees the Qur&#x27;an as a living phenomenon, a discourse. Hence, the Qur&#x27;an can be &quot;the outcome of dialogue, debate, despite argument, acceptance and rejection&quot;. This liberal interpretation of Islam should open space for new perspectives on the religion and social change in Muslim societies.

Abu Zayd&#x27;s analysis finds several &quot;insistent calls for social justice&quot; in the Qur&#x27;an . One example is when Muhammad—busy preaching to the rich people of Quraysh—failed to pay attention to a poor blind fellow named Ibn Umm Maktūm who came asking the Prophet for advice. The Quran strongly criticizes Muhammad&#x27;s attitude. ()

Abu Zayd also argued that while the Qur&#x27;anic discourse was built in a patriarchal society, and therefore the addressees were naturally males, who received permission to marry, divorce, and marry off their female relatives, it is &quot;possible to imagine that Muslim women receive the same rights&quot;, and so the Quran had a &quot;tendency to improve women&#x27;s rights&quot;. The classical position of the modern &quot;&#x27;ulamā&#x27;&quot; about that issue is understandable as &quot;they still believe in superiority of the male in the family&quot;.

Abu Zayd&#x27;s critical approach to classical and contemporary Islamic discourse in the fields of theology, philosophy, law, politics, and humanism, promoted modern Islamic thought that might enable Muslims to build a bridge between their own tradition and the modern world of freedom of speech, equality (minority rights, women&#x27;s rights, social justice), human rights, democracy and globalisation.

<text>The 1929 Saskatchewan general election was held on June 6, 1929 to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan.

As a result of corruption scandals, the Liberal Party of Premier James Gardiner lost a significant share of its popular vote, but more important, lost twenty-two of the seats it had won in the 1925 election. While the Liberals held the largest number of seats in the legislature, they had only a minority. Gardiner tried to continue as a minority government, but was quickly defeated in a Motion of No Confidence, and resigned as premier.

The Conservative Party of James T.M. Anderson increased its representation in the legislature from three to twenty four seats. Following Gardiner&#x27;s resignation, Anderson was able to form a coalition government with the support of the Progressive Party and some independents.

The Progressives had lost a large part of the popular vote it had won in 1925, but managed to retain five of the six seats it had won previously.

<text>The 1934 Saskatchewan general election was held on June 19, 1934, to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan.

The Liberal Party of former premier James Gardiner was returned to power with a large majority – 50 of the 55 seats in the legislature – after the four year Conservative minority government interlude.

After forming a coalition government to oust the Liberals from power after the 1929 election, James T.M. Anderson&#x27;s Conservative government had tried to use anti-Catholic and anti-French Canadian feeling in the province to win support. The Conservatives also had the support of the Ku Klux Klan, which was a significant force in the province at the time. The Tories also had to contend with the effects of the Great Depression and the prairie Dust Bowl, however; and although they won about a quarter of the popular vote, they won no seats in the legislature. The Conservatives remained a minor force in Saskatchewan politics for 40 years after this defeat.

The Tories&#x27; allies in the previous legislature – the Progressives – did not nominate candidates in this election, and were replaced by Farmer-Labour candidates as the voice of the Left in the province.

<text>The 1938 Saskatchewan general election was held on June 8, 1938, to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan.

The Liberal Party was returned to power under its new leader, William John Patterson, but it lost twelve of the seats it had held in the previous legislature. The Liberals faced several new forces in this election.

The Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, a democratic socialist party led by George Hara Williams, became the official opposition winning over 18% of the vote and ten seats in its first election. The party previously had five seats after the Farmer-Labour Group became the Saskatchewan CCF following the previous election.

The Social Credit Party of Saskatchewan, which promoted the social credit theories of monetary reform, rode a wave of popularity from the 1935 electoral success of its Alberta counterpart and collected almost 16% of the votes, but won only two seats.

Six &quot;Unity&quot; candidates also ran in an attempt to create a popular front of the Communists, CCF supporters and various populists. Although two were elected, they received only a very small fraction of the overall vote.

The Conservative Party – under its new leader, John Diefenbaker – continued its decline as their share of the popular vote fell from 25% to under 12%. The party won no seats. Diefenbaker later had considerably more success in the federal Conservative Party, eventually becoming leader and sweeping the party to power in the 1958 election with a huge majority.

<text>The 1944 Saskatchewan general election, the tenth in the history of the province, was held on June 15, 1944 to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan. The Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, under the leadership of Tommy Douglas, was elected to a majority government.

== Summary ==
The 1944 election was held six years after the previous election in 1938. While there is normally a five-year limit on the lifespan of Parliaments and provincial assemblies in Canada, the emergency brought on by the Second World War allowed the government to delay the election temporarily, which William Patterson&#x27;s governing Liberal Party opted to do.
The 1944 election marked the first time a nominally socialist government was elected anywhere in Canada. With the victory, Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) leader Tommy Douglas became the premier of Saskatchewan. The CCF, which had spent two terms as the Official Opposition, won 47 of the 52 seats in the legislature, and over half the popular vote.

The Liberals, led by Patterson, had run a negative campaign, accusing Douglas and the CCF of being communists. The Liberal popular vote fell by 10 percentage points, and the party won only five seats. This marked the worst defeat of a sitting government in Saskatchewan&#x27;s history.

The Social Credit Party, which had won 16% of the vote and two seats in the 1938 election, collapsed; the party had only one candidate, who received only 249 votes.

The Communist Party-led Unity movement reverted to the name Labor-Progressive Party, and lost both of the seats it had won in 1938.

The Conservative Party, renamed the Progressive Conservative Party and led by Rupert Ramsay, continued to see its share of the vote drop, taking only just over 10% of the vote, and won no seats.

An at-large service vote was held for Saskatchewan residents in the Canadian armed services fighting during the war. This special vote elected three nonpartisan members to represent Saskatchewan soldiers, sailors and airmen stationed in Great Britain, the Mediterranean region, and Newfoundland and Canada outside the province. Alberta had a similar system during the war.

<text>Sasha Caleb Victorine (born February 3, 1978) is an American former soccer player.

He spent his entire professional career in Major League Soccer in the United States, making over 100 appearances for both Los Angeles Galaxy and Kansas City Wizards, before finishing his career with Chivas USA. He also made four appearances and scored one goal for the United States national team, and represented his country at the 2000 Summer Olympics.

==Career==

===Youth and College===
Victorine was born in Santa Ana, California. He played high school soccer at Rio Americano High School, and college soccer at UCLA, leading them to the NCAA title in 1997, and being named a first-team All-American in 1999. He was drafted by the Los Angeles Galaxy in the first round of the 2000 MLS SuperDraft.

===Professional===
Victorine spent five years with LA, winning the U.S. Open Cup in 2001 and the MLS Cup in 2002; his best season was 2001, when he scored seven goals and five assists. He was traded to Kansas City Wizards for a draft pick in 2005. Alternating between the attack and midfield, in six years in MLS, he scored 24 goals and 24 assists, adding four goals and two assists in the playoffs. Victorine was traded to Chivas USA on September 15, 2008, in return for allocation money. Throughout his career at UCLA, the Galaxy, and the US Olympic and national teams, Victorine was teammates with Peter Vagenas. The two Californians were born just four days apart.

He retired from professional soccer in March 2010. He later worked in the Kansas City Wizards front office and also served as a color commentator on KCWE television station. He has since left his roles with the club and now works in the private sector outside of sports.

===International===
Victorine played for the United States in the 1999 Pan American Games and the 2000 Summer Olympics. He earned his first cap for the senior national team on October 25, 2000, against Mexico, and earned four caps total, scoring one goal. An attacking player for most of his career, US coach Bruce Arena played Victorine at right back.

=== Sports diplomacy ===
In November 2010, Victorine traveled to Cyprus as a SportsUnited Sports Envoy for the U.S. Department of State. In this function, he worked with Anthony Sanneh to conduct basketball clinics and events for 350 youth from underserved areas. In so doing, Victorine helped contribute to SportsUnited&#x27;s mission to promote greater international understanding and inclusion through sport.

<text>Reach for the Sky is a 1956 British biographical film about aviator Douglas Bader, based on the 1954 biography of the same name by Paul Brickhill. The film stars Kenneth More and was directed by Lewis Gilbert. It won the BAFTA Award for Best British Film of 1956. The film&#x27;s composer John Addison was Bader&#x27;s brother-in-law.
==Plot==
In 1928, Douglas Bader joins the Royal Air Force (RAF) as a Flight Cadet. Despite a friendly reprimand from Air Vice-Marshal Halahan for his disregard for service discipline and flight rules, he successfully completes his training and is posted to No. 23 Squadron at RAF Kenley. In 1930, he is chosen to be among the pilots for an aerial exhibition.

Later, although his flight commander has explicitly banned low level aerobatics (as two pilots have been killed trying just that), he is goaded into it by a disparaging remark by a civilian pilot. The wing tip of his bi-plane touches the ground during his flight and he crashes dramatically, and is clearly badly injured.

Mr Joyce, surgeon at the Royal Berkshire Hospital, has to amputate both legs to save Bader&#x27;s life. During his convalescence, he receives encouragement from Nurse Brace. Upon his discharge from the hospital, he sets out to master prosthetic legs. Out for a drive with two other RAF pals, they stop at a tearoom, and here he meets waitress Thelma Edwards. Once he can walk on his own, he asks her out.

Despite his undiminished skills, he is refused flying duties simply because there are no regulations covering his situation. Offered a desk job instead, he leaves the RAF and works unhappily in an office. He and Thelma marry at a registry office on a wet afternoon.

As World War II starts, Bader talks himself back into the RAF. He is soon given command of a squadron comprising mostly dispirited Canadians who had fought in France. Improving morale and brazenly circumventing normal channels to obtain badly needed equipment, he makes the squadron operational again. They fight effectively in the Battle of Britain. Bader is then put in charge of a new, larger formation of five squadrons. Later, he is posted to RAF Tangmere and promoted to wing commander.

In 1941, Bader has to bail out over France. He is caught, escapes, and is recaptured. He then makes such a nuisance of himself to his jailers, he is repeatedly moved from one POW camp to another, finally ending up in Colditz Castle. He is liberated after four years of captivity. The war ends (much to Thelma&#x27;s relief) before Bader can have &quot;one last fling&quot; in the Far East.

On 15 September 1945, the fifth anniversary of the greatest day of the Battle of Britain, Bader, now a group captain, is given the honour of leading eleven other battle survivors and a total of 300 aircraft in a flypast over London.

==Production==
Lewis Gilbert said Daniel Angel wanted to buy the rights for the book even without having read it, before it had been published, because he sensed it was going to be a best seller. Angel bought the film rights for £15,000 and showed the book to Lewis Gilbert while they were making &quot;The Sea Shall Not Have Them&quot; together. Gilbert and Vernon Harris started writing the script but Harris dropped out. Terence Rattigan turned down the job. H Bates started writing it and turned it down. William Alec Douglas tried then gave it up. Lewis Gilbert wrote the script in collaboration with Paul Brickhill who wrote the book.

Richard Burton was the first choice for the lead and he was considering it but he dropped out when he was offered the lead in &quot;Alexander the Great&quot; at what Gilbert describes as &quot;three or four times the salary&quot;. The second choice was Laurence Olivier who turned it down – Gilbert later admitted Olivier would have been miscast.

Kenneth More was cast instead at a fee of £25,000. Producer Daniel Angel recalled:
My wife said to me, &#x27;Kenneth More is Douglas Bader.&#x27; And so he was! He was a good actor, but, looking back, I don&#x27;t think he was all that versatile and he wasn&#x27;t physically a very attractive man. He couldn&#x27;t play love scenes. He was more of a playboy type. He was Douglas Bader! Bader wasn&#x27;t a technical adviser but I suppose Kenny More modelled himself physically on Bader.

More arranged to meet Bader to prepare for the role. They played a round of golf; much to More&#x27;s surprise (as he was a good golfer), Bader beat him decisively.

Lewis Gilbert said Douglas Bader was difficult to deal with and did not help at all during filming:
When he read the script he said I had made a terrible hash of it because I&#x27;d cut out a lot of his friends. I pointed out that the book contained hundreds of names and I had to cut it down or else the film would run for three days. He said, &#x27;That&#x27;s your problem. If you don&#x27;t get my friends in, I won&#x27;t double for the film,&#x27; because he was going to double for Kenneth More in long shots. I explained to him that that wouldn&#x27;t stop the film being made; I said that we would undoubtedly find someone with a disability similar to his – which he did. In fact a number of his friends had helped me with the script, although we didn&#x27;t tell Douglas that. Douglas wasn&#x27;t in the film at all.
To depict the various Royal Air Force bases realistically, principal filming took place in Surrey at RAF Kenley, and around the town of Caterham. The cricket match was filmed at nearby Whyteleafe recreation ground. Studio work was completed at Pinewood Studios. Available wartime combat aircraft including Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire fighters were arranged to take on the aerial scenes.

Angel later said that his favourite part of the film was when Bader was trying to learn how to walk again in hospital. &quot;I&#x27;ve been in hospital myself, on and off since the war, and I&#x27;d seen a lot of that sort of thing,&quot; he later said. &quot;It was a very touching performance from Dorothy Alison, who seemed to sum up so much in a few moments.&quot; Alison received a BAFTA nomination for Best British Actress.

The film&#x27;s composer John Addison was Bader&#x27;s brother-in-law.

The book was also adapted for Australian radio in 1954.

==Reception==
The film fared well with the public, being the most popular film in the UK for 1956. When the film was released in North America in 1957, the American release version was slightly altered with 12 minutes edited out. The Rank Organisation, the film&#x27;s distributor, made a concerted effort to ensure the film was successful in America, sending Kenneth More over to do a press tour, and setting up Rank&#x27;s own distribution arm in North America, but the public was not enthusiastic.

Because Bader had fallen out with Brickhill over the split of royalties from the book, he refused to attend the premiere, and only saw the film for the first time eleven years later, on television.

When the film was released, people associated Bader with the quiet and amiable personality of actor More. Bader recognised that the producers had deleted all those habits he displayed when on operations, particularly his prolific use of bad language. Bader once said, &quot;[they] still think [I&#x27;m] the dashing chap Kenneth More was.&quot;

It won the BAFTA Award for Best British Film of 1956.

&quot;Filmink&quot; later argued the film &quot;became acknowledged as a classic, unfairly mocked by Gen-X critics who were forced to watch it on television too many times, and who forget that the film was made by people and for audiences who had been through that conflict, many of whom had seen people die, and could view it in proper context.&quot;

<text>Monika Charlotte Dannemann (24 June 19455 April 1996) was a German figure skater and painter. She was the last girlfriend of guitarist Jimi Hendrix, and later (reportedly) the wife of German guitarist Uli Jon Roth of the Scorpions.

==Figure skating==
In 1965, Dannemann participated in the German Figure Skating Championships representing the club Düsseldorfer EG.

==Involvement with Jimi Hendrix==

Dannemann was first introduced to Jimi Hendrix on 12 January 1969, in Düsseldorf, after being invited to a Jimi Hendrix concert there. She spent that night with him and part of the next day too, when she accompanied him to his next concert in Cologne; after that, she returned to Düsseldorf. He spent the last night of the tour with model Uschi Obermaier, with whom he was filmed kissing and petting outside the Kempinski Hotel the next morning. He wrote to Dannemann on 25 March 1969, inviting her to visit him in New York City. Dannemann claims she next saw Hendrix when she travelled to London on 25 April 1969 in the hope of meeting him again, where she bumped into him at the Speakeasy Club. She says they spent some time together over the next nine days, but she only spent one night with him.

After his September 1970 European tour, Hendrix began a relationship with the Danish model Kirsten Nefer. (It was reported in the Danish press at the time that they were engaged.) After Nefer left London due to work, he again took up with Dannemann on 15 September and spent the next four nights at her flat at the Samarkand Hotel, Notting Hill Gate, where he died.

On the evening of 17 September Hendrix took at least one amphetamine pill (known as a &quot;black bomber&quot;) at a party, where he stayed for a short while. Later, at Dannemann&#x27;s flat, Hendrix took nine of her Vesparax sleeping tablets; Hendrix was officially declared to have died at St. Mary Abotts hospital at 12:45 PM. The cause of death was asphyxiation through aspiration of vomit due to a barbiturate overdose.

==Later years==
After Hendrix&#x27;s death, Dannemann became romantically involved with German rock guitarist Uli Jon Roth of rock band Scorpions, with whom she collaborated on several songs (one with Scorpions titled &quot;We&#x27;ll Burn the Sky&quot; ), album cover designs (of Roth&#x27;s second band Electric Sun), and artwork. Roth also wrote the foreword to Dannemann&#x27;s book about her experience living and working with Hendrix, entitled &quot;The Inner World of Jimi Hendrix&quot; (1995).

Dannemann died of suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning at age 50 in Seaford, East Sussex. She had lost an ongoing court battle with another of Hendrix&#x27;s girlfriends, Kathy Etchingham, two days earlier.

<text>Leo Dillon (March 2, 1933 – May 26, 2012) and Diane Dillon (&quot;née&quot; Sorber; born March 13, 1933) were American illustrators of children&#x27;s books and adult paperback book and magazine covers. One obituary of Leo called the work of the husband-and-wife team &quot;a seamless amalgam of both their hands&quot;. In more than 50 years, they created more than 100 speculative fiction book and magazine covers together as well as much interior artwork. Essentially all of their work in that field was joint.

The Dillons won the Caldecott Medal in 1976 and 1977, the only consecutive awards of the honor. Leo Dillon was the first Black artist to win the Caldecott Medal. In 1978 they were runners-up for the Hans Christian Andersen Award for children&#x27;s illustrators; they were the U.S. nominee again in 1996.

==Biography==
Leo Dillon, of Trinidadian immigrant parentage, was born March 2, 1933, and raised in East New York. He enlisted in the Navy for three years&#x27; service so that he could attend art school. He credited his interest in art and his inspiration to become an artist to his friend and mentor, Ralph Volman. 

Diane Sorber was born March 13, 1933, in Glendale, California. Her interest in art was encouraged early by her mother, who was a pianist. The couple met at the Parsons School of Design in New York City in 1953 — where they &quot;became instant archrivals and remained together from then on&quot;. They graduated in 1956 and married the next year. This union resulted in an artistic collaboration, which the couple described as a third artist. Diane Dillon explained this in an interview through these words: “We could look at ourselves as one artist rather than two individuals, and that third artist was doing something neither one of us would do. We let it flow the way it flows when an artist is working by themselves and a color goes down that they didn’t quite expect and that affects the next colors they use, and it seems to have a life of its own.”

An association with writer Harlan Ellison led to jobs doing book covers for his short story collections and both cover and interior woodcut illustration for his anthology &quot;Dangerous Visions&quot;. They illustrated a large number of mass market paperback book covers for the original Ace Science Fiction Specials, for which they won their first major award, science fiction&#x27;s 1971 Hugo Award for Best Professional Artist. A detailed biography and introduction to their work and styles were written by Byron Preiss in a book he edited in 1981, entitled &quot;The Art of Leo &amp; Diane Dillon&quot;. They once described their work as incorporating motifs derived from their respective heritages. This can be demonstrated in their work for Margaret Musgrove&#x27;s &quot;Ashanti to Zulu&quot;, which used tribal motifs and combined historical with contemporary styles.

On May 28, 2012, Ellison reported on his website his reception of a phone call from Diane announcing Leo&#x27;s death at the age of 79 from lung cancer two days prior. Spectrum Fantastic Art, an annual art competition and art book project of which the couple were general managers, confirmed Leo&#x27;s death on its website. The obituary of Leo in &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the Dillons jointly as &quot;one of the world&#x27;s pre-eminent illustrators for young people, producing artwork — praised for its vibrancy, ecumenicalism and sheer sumptuous beauty — that was a seamless amalgam of both their hands&quot;, also noting the ethnoracial diversity of characters in the Dillons&#x27; work in the 1970s, &quot;until then, the smiling faces portrayed in picture books had been overwhelmingly white.&quot;

Since Leo&#x27;s death, Diane Dillon has illustrated one book, &quot;I Can Be Anything! Don’t Tell Me I Can’t&quot; (published 2018), which she also wrote.

The Dillons had one surviving son. Lee (Lionel John Dillon III), born 1965, became an artist and collaborated with his parents several times, including the illustrations for &quot;Pish, Posh, Said Hieronymus Bosch&quot; by Nancy Willard (1991). Both Leo and Diane lived in the Cobble Hill neighborhood at the time of Leo&#x27;s death.

<doc id="1161967" wikidata="Q981948" url="?curid=1161967" title="Rob Howley">
<text>Robert Howley (born 13 October 1970) is a Welsh rugby union coach and former player. As a player, he won 59 caps for Wales, 22 of them as captain. He was part of the Wales coaching staff from 2008 to 2019.He is Currently Attack Coach for Welsh Rugby Team for the Six Nations 

He is currently a coaching consultant for the Toronto Arrows in Major League Rugby (MLR).

==Playing career==
===Club===
Howley played for Bridgend, Cardiff and Wasps. He gained the distinction of Welsh Player of the Year in 1996 and 1997.

He helped Wasps win back-to-back Premiership titles in 2003 and 2004. He also helped Wasps win the Heineken Cup in 2004; his late try in the final won them the game against Toulouse. A wrist injury saw Howley announce his retirement from the game in 2004.

===International===
Howley represented Wales at Schools, Students, U21, A and B levels.

He made his senior Wales debut in February 1996. He was selected for the 1997 British Lions tour to South Africa, prompting speculation of a match-up with the Springboks&#x27; Joost van der Westhuizen, but Howley suffered a tour-ending shoulder injury in a match against Natal prior to the start of the test series. Howley made the 2001 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to Australia and played in the first two tests before succumbing to injury.

He retired from international rugby when he joined Wasps.

==Coaching career==
Following his retirement from playing, Howley coached Cardiff RFC.

In 2008, he was named as the attack coach as part of Warren Gatland&#x27;s Wales coaching staff. Over the next 12 years, the national side won four Six Nations titles, including three Grand Slams, and reached the Rugby World Cup semi-finals in 2011 and the quarter-finals in 2015.

He was attack coach during 2009 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to South Africa under head coach Ian McGeechan, and retained the role under Warren Gatland in the 2013 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to Australia, helping the Lions secure their first series win since 1997.

===Wales caretaker coach===

====2012–2013====
In April 2012, Howley temporarily covered the day-to-day running of the coaching team, after Warren Gatland suffered two broken heels while on holiday in New Zealand. Warren Gatland was unable to lead Wales on their 2012 tour to Australia because of his injury, and Rob Howley took charge as caretaker coach during the tour. Rob Howley continued his caretaker role in the 2012 Autumn Internationals as Gatland was selected as head coach of the 2013 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to Australia. However, Howley would only coach Wales in the opening 2 matches; Argentina and Samoa, and that Gatland would return to coach the side against New Zealand and Australia in week 3 and 4. Due to Gatland&#x27;s role as head coach of the Lions, he was unable to coach Wales in the 2013 Six Nations, therefore Howley continued his role through the 2013 tournament.

As Wales coach, Howley faced much criticism. Wales beat the Barbarians 30–21 in his opening match as caretaker, but after that, Wales suffered eight consecutive defeats, six of which were under Howley. This included a 3–0 series defeat against Australia during their 2012 tour, a series whitewash in the 2012 Autumn internationals and a loss in the opening round of the 2013 Six Nations against Ireland. The last five defeats were all at home, setting a new Wales record for consecutive home defeats. The streak was broken in round 2 of the Six Nations with a 16–6 win over France. Howley led Wales to a Championship win in the 2013 Six Nations after beating England by a record winning margin, 30–3 at the Millennium Stadium. This was Wales&#x27; fourth Championship win since it became the Six Nations in 2000, and the first time Wales won back-to-back championships since 1979.

====2016–2017====
On 7 September 2016, Howley was once again given the head coaching duties for the Welsh national side after Gatland retained his head coaching role of the British &amp; Irish Lions for their 2017 tour to New Zealand. Howley took charge of Wales effective immediately, coaching Wales in all 2016 Autumn internationals, which saw Wales win 3 from 4. He also coached the side during the 2017 Six Nations Championship, and assisted the British &amp; Irish Lions during their 2017 Summer tour.

===2019 suspension===

On 17 September 2019 Rob Howley was sent home from Wales&#x27; Rugby World Cup training camp in Japan for a breach of sports betting rules. He was later banned for 18 months with nine suspended after being found guilty of placing 363 bets on rugby union, covering 1,163 matches in total. Howley linked his betting to his sister&#x27;s depression, alcoholism and early death.

<doc id="1161972" wikidata="Q4367901" url="?curid=1161972" title="Tottel's Miscellany">
<text>Songes and Sonettes, usually called Tottel&#x27;s Miscellany, was the first printed anthology of English poetry. First published by Richard Tottel in 1557 in London, it ran to many editions in the sixteenth century.

==Richard Tottel==
Richard Tottel was an English publisher with a shop at Temple Bar on Fleet Street in London. His main business was the publication of law textbooks but his biggest contribution to English literature would come in the form of the anthology of poetry. He also gave the public Surrey&#x27;s translation of the second and fourth books of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, which is the earliest known example of English blank verse. He is responsible too for the first edition printed of Cicero&#x27;s &quot;De Officiis&quot; in 1556 by Nicholas Grimald, who would later contribute to the poetry anthology.

Tottel also published Thomas More&#x27;s &quot;Utopia&quot; and another collection of More&#x27;s writings, John Lydgate&#x27;s translations from Giovanni Boccaccio, and books by William Staunford and Thomas Tusser. The majority of his publications were legal treatises, including a legal history of the reign of Richard III, and legal yearbooks covering parts of the reigns of Henry VIII and Edward VI.

==&quot;Songes and Sonettes&quot;==
The first edition of this work appeared on 5 June 1557 with the title &quot;Songes and Sonettes Written By the Ryght Honorable Lord Henry Howard, late Earle of Surrey, Thomas Wyatt the Elder and others.&quot; The volume consisted of 271 poems, none of which had ever been printed before. &quot;Songs and Sonettes&quot; was the first of the poetic anthologies that became popular by the end of the 16th century, and is considered to be Tottel&#x27;s &#x27;great contribution to English letters&#x27;, as well as the first to be printed for the pleasure of the common reader. It was also the last large use of sonnet form for several decades, in published work, until the appearance of Philip Sidney&#x27;s sonnet sequence &quot;Astrophel and Stella&quot; (1591) and the anthology &quot;The Phoenix Nest&quot; (1593).

Most of the poems included in the anthology were written in the 1530s but were only published in the first edition in 1557. Many of them were published posthumously.
There are in total 54 actual sonnets in the anthology. These include nine from unknown authors, three from Nicholas Grimald, 15 from Surrey, and 27 from Wyatt.

The incorporated poetry had numerous comments on religion, covering Catholicism, Protestantism, and the English Reformation. Later editors of the early modern period then took out many of these religious references.

==Contributors==
The collection comprises mostly the works of Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey and Thomas Wyatt the Elder. Both were heavily influenced by Italian poetry, although Wyatt&#x27;s meter would be adapted to conventional English iambic stress by Tottel.

The star poet of &quot;Tottel&#x27;s Miscellany&quot;, the Earl of Surrey, created the English sonnet form by modifying the Petrarchan sonnet. If the English sonnet is also called the Shakespearean sonnet, that can be attributed to Shakespeare&#x27;s fame. The form which Surrey created (three quatrains in alternate rhyme and a concluding couplet) is easier to write in English than the Petrarchan form, with its more complex rhyme scheme.

Wyatt&#x27;s inclusion in &quot;Tottel&#x27;s Miscellany&quot; would mark the first time this poet&#x27;s work was printed. (Two of Surrey&#x27;s poems had appeared in print). Other contributors include Nicholas Grimald, Thomas Norton, Thomas Vaux, John Heywood, Edward Somerset and other uncertain or unknown authors. Among these unknown authors, it is believed that Geoffrey Chaucer wrote at least one of the poems, titled in the anthology as, &quot;To leade a vertuous and honest life.&quot; Although some of the wording has been altered slightly, this poem appears to be &quot;a somewhat mutilated copy of Chaucer&#x27;s ballad on &#x27;Truth.

This is a sample of a poem found in the text by Sir Thomas Wyatt:.
:They flee from me, that sometime did me seek,
:With naked foot stalking in my chamber:
:Once have I seen them gentle, tame, and meek,
:That now are wild, and do not once remember,
:That sometime they have put themselves in danger
:To take bread at my hand ; and now they range
:Busily seeking in continual change

(This poem refers to Elizabeth I&#x27;s mother, Anne Boleyn. Wyatt wisely withdrew from the chase in favor of a more heavyweight suitor. Both had the problem of being already married, but the other suitor, Henry VIII, eventually solved that one).

The first edition of &quot;Tottel&#x27;s Miscellany&quot; (1557) featured forty poems by Surrey, ninety-six poems by Wyatt, forty poems by Grimald, and ninety-five poems written by unknown authors. Tottel made note that of those anonymous poems, the authors were sure to include Thomas Churchyard, Thomas Vaux, Edward Somerset, John Heywood and Sir Francis Bryan. It has been decided definitely that of those ninety-five poems, two were written by Vaux, one by John Heywood, and one by Somerset. The only first edition left is in the Bodleian Library in England. A reprint, which was limited to sixty copies, was edited by John Payne Collier in 1867.

The second edition was also published in 1557; thirty of Grimald&#x27;s poems were removed but thirty-nine additional ones were added to the &quot;uncertain authors&quot; category with a final tally of 281 poems. There are only two copies of this work in existence left, one in the Grenville Collection at the British Museum, the other at Trinity College, Cambridge.

The next seven editions were all printed between 1558 and 1586, with the final ninth edition being published in 1587.

==Impact==
It was so popular during the Elizabethan era it is considered the most influential of all Elizabethan miscellanies. It is generally included with Elizabethan era literature even though it was, in fact, published in 1557, a year before Elizabeth I took the throne.

Shakespeare uses some of its verses in &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; and &quot;Hamlet&quot;, and directly quotes the anonymous poem &quot;Against him that had slaundered a gentlewoman with him selfe&quot;, in &quot;The Rape of Lucrece&quot;:
:&quot;To me came Tarquin, armed to beguild, 
:With outward honesty but yet defiled...&quot;

In the Miscellany the quote is

:&quot;so was the house defiled,
:Oh Collatiue: so was the wife beguilde.&quot;

&quot;Songes and Sonettes&quot; is also known as the most important English poetic collection in the 16th century and inaugurated a long series of poetic anthologies in Elizabethan England.

<text>Charbel Makhlouf, O.L.M. (, May 8, 1828 – December 24, 1898), born Youssef Antoun Makhlouf and venerated as Saint Charbel, was a Maronite monk and priest from modern-day Lebanon. During his life, he obtained a wide reputation for holiness, and for his ability to unite Christians, Muslims and Druze.

He is known among Lebanese Christians as the &quot;Miracle Monk of Lebanon&quot; because of the favours received through his intercession, especially after prayers are said at his tomb in the Monastery of Saint Maron in Annaya, Lebanon. He was beatified in 1965 and canonized in 1977 by Pope Paul VI. He is venerated as a saint and celebrated on 24 July by the Latin Church, and on the third Sunday of July by the Maronite Church.

The Medal of Saint Charbel was created in his honor.

==Life==
===Early life===
Youssef Antoun Makhlouf was born on May 8, 1828, one of five children, in the mountain village of Bekaa Kafra, the highest by elevation in Lebanon. His father, Antoun Zaarour Makhlouf, was a mule driver who died in August 1831 while returning from &quot;corvée&quot; for the Turkish army, leaving his wife Brigitta (&quot;née&quot; Chidiac) a widow to care for their children. She remarried a man who went on to Holy Orders and became the parish priest of Bekaa Kafra.

Makhlouf was raised in this pious home, and became drawn to the lives of the saints and the eremitical life practiced by two of his uncles. As a young boy, he was responsible for the family&#x27;s small herd of cows. He would take the herd to a nearby grotto, where he had enshrined an icon of the Blessed Virgin Mary. He would spend the day in prayer.

===Monk===
In 1851, Makhlouf left his family to begin training as a monk of the Lebanese Maronite Order at the Monastery of Our Lady in Mayfouq. He later transferred to the Monastery of Saint Maron in Annaya, in the Byblos District near Beirut. Here, he received his habit and took the religious name &quot;Charbel&quot;, after the 2nd-century Christian martyr of Antioch. He made his final religious profession in the Order on November 1, 1853.

As a young monk, Makhlouf began to prepare himself for ordination by studying philosophy and theology at the Monastery of Saints Cyprian and Justina in Kfifan, Batroun District. Among his professors at the seminary was Nimatullah Kassab, who was himself later also declared a saint. He was ordained six years later, on July 23, 1859, in Bkerke. Charbel was then sent back to the Monastery of Saint Maron, where he lived a life of severe asceticism.

===Eremitical life===
In 1875, Charbel was granted by the abbot of the monastery the privilege of living as a hermit at the Hermitage of Saints Peter and Paul, a chapel under the care of the monastery. He spent the next 23 years living alone until his death from a stroke on December 24, 1898.

==Death and relics==
Makhlouf was interred at the Monastery of Saint Maron on Christmas Day that year. It was reported that during the transport of his corpse, inclement weather conditions hindered the pallbearers in carrying out their duty.
&quot;Father Charbel died on the eve of Christmas; the snow was heavy. We transferred him to the monastery on Christmas Day. Before we moved him, the snow was falling rapidly and the clouds were very dark. When we carried him, the clouds disappeared, and the weather cleared.&quot; 

– George Emmanuel Abi-Saseen, one of the pallbearers

One story claims: &quot;A few months after his death, a bright light was seen surrounding his tomb and the superiors opened it to find his body still intact. After that day, a blood-like liquid flowed from his body. Experts and doctors were unable to give medical explanations for the incorruptibility and flexibility.&quot; In 1950 and 1952, his tomb was opened and his body still had the appearance of a living one. Additionally, the 1950 television tape of his exhumation showed Makhlouf&#x27;s body as still intact, despite the grave having become severely rusty. The official site mentions: In this century his grave has been opened four times, the last time being in 1955, and each time &quot;it has been noticed that his bleeding body still has its flexibility as if it were alive”. The Catholic Tradition website says: &quot;Father Joseph Mahfouz, the postulator of the cause, certified that in 1965 the body of Saint Charbel was still preserved intact with no alteration. In 1976, he again witnessed the opening of the grave; this time the body was completely decomposed. Only the skeleton remained.&quot;

On 2 September 2017, Saint Charbel&#x27;s relics were translated to Saint Elisabeth Cathedral in Košice, Slovakia, where a monthly pilgrimage is held, called &quot;Púť k sv. Šarbelovi&quot; (Pilgrimage to St. Charbel). The cathedral is the first in Slovakia to receive his official relics from Lebanon, and attracts pilgrims from across the country as well as neighbouring states like Poland, Ukraine and Czech Republic.

==Veneration==

The cause for Makhlouf&#x27;s beatification was formally opened on April 4, 1929, and he was granted the title Servant of God. On December 5, 1965, Pope Paul VI presided over his beatification at the conclusion of the Second Vatican Council. The pope said: “A hermit of Mount Lebanon is enrolled in the number of the blessed… a new eminent member of monastic sanctity has by his example and his intercession enriched the entire Christian people … may he make us understand, in a world largely fascinated by wealth and comfort, the paramount value of poverty, penance and asceticism, to liberate the soul in its ascent to God.”

On October 9, 1977, the pontiff canonized Makhlouf. At the time, Bishop Francis Zayek wrote, “St. Sharbel is called the second St. Anthony of the Desert, the Perfume of Lebanon, the first Confessor of the East to be raised to the Altars according to the actual procedure of the Catholic Church, the honor of our Aramaic Antiochian Church, and the model of spiritual values and renewal. Sharbel is like a Cedar of Lebanon standing in eternal prayer, on top of a mountain.” Reflecting on the canonization of Makhlouf and the causes for canonization of other Maronites active at the time, Zayek further proclaimed “the Aramaic Maronite Antiochian Church is indeed a living branch of the Catholic Church and is intimately connected with the trunk, who is Christ, our Savior, the beginning and the end of all things.”

Owing to his role as a Maronite Saint as well as his piety and morals, Makhlouf serves as a role model for many Maronite Catholics and is venerated by Catholics from all &quot;sui iuris&quot; churches in communion with Rome.

On October 28, 2017, a shrine dedicated to Makhlouf was inaugurated at Saint Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral in New York City. The Lebanese Maronite Patriarch, Bechara Boutros al-Rahi, attended the inauguration ceremony giving his blessing and a dedication, as well as Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan. The shrine has a mosaic of Makhlouf along with national emblems of Lebanon such as the cedar and a relic of Makhlouf. It was donated by SGBL Bank chairman Antoun Sehnaoui in the name of his parents, May and Nabil Sehnaoui.

== Miracles ==
Among the many miracles attributed to Makhlouf, the Catholic Church chose two to confirm his beatification, and a third for his canonization:

*the healing of Sister Mary Abel Kamari of the Sacred Hearts;
*the healing of Iskandar Naim Obeid from Baabdat; and
*the healing of Rached Salim Zoorob from Alma El Chaab;
*the healing of Mariam Awad from Hammana.

A great number of other miracles have been attributed to Makhlouf since his death. The most famous is that of Nohad El Shami, a 55-year-old woman at the time of the miracle who was healed from partial paralysis. She tells that on the night of January 22, 1993, she dreamt of two Maronite monks standing next to her bed. One put his hands on her neck and operated on her, relieving her from her pain, while the other held a pillow behind her back. When she awoke, she found two wounds in her neck, one on each side. She was completely healed and recovered her ability to walk. She believed it was the saint who healed her, but did not recognize the other monk. The next night, she dreamt of Makhlouf, who said: &quot;I did the surgery to let people see and return to faith. I ask you to visit the hermitage on the 22nd of every month, and attend Mass regularly for the rest of your life”. People now gather on the 22nd of each month to pray and attend Mass in the hermitage of Saint Charbel in Annaya.

In 1994, a Lebanese Maronite Catholic named Raymond Nader was praying at the hermitage in Annaya when he had a mystical experience. “I found myself in another world…I saw a strange and amazing Light unlike any light I had ever seen; it was a sea of light that extended from one end of the universe to the other. I wanted that Light to stay permanently.” After the vision, Nader was leaving when his arm felt hot and itchy near the statue of Saint Charbel. When he rolled up his sleeve in his car, he saw the imprint of five fingers. “They were engraved like a hand on my arm and encircled by a red glare as if imprinted through fire. But I felt nothing but warmth.” 

Dr. Nabil Hokayem, a plastic surgeon from Beirut, examined the mark and believed it was a third-degree burn despite it not causing Nader pain. The mark has since repeatedly faded and returned. Inspired by his experience, in 1995 Nader began a prayer group called the Family of Saint Sharbel. Its mission is “to contribute to the Catholic Church’s evangelizing mission through living the spirituality of Saint Sharbel in the world.” Nader claims Saint Charbel has appeared to him many more times, and 16 of the saint&#x27;s locutions to Nader have been published.

<text>Dalhousie Castle is a castle in Cockpen, Midlothian, Scotland. Dalhousie Castle is situated near the town of Bonnyrigg, 8 miles (13 km) south of Edinburgh. The castle was the seat of the Earls of Dalhousie, the chieftains of Clan Ramsay.

==History==
The patriarch of the clan was Simundus de Ramesie (Simon of Ramsey), an English knight of Norman descent from the Huntingdonshire village of Ramsey. Simundus, a vassal of David, Earl of Huntingdon, followed his lord to Scotland in about 1140, when David inherited the Scottish crown. He is considered the founder of the Ramsay clan and the first to have lands at Dalwolsey.

The first castle at Dalhousie was constructed by him. The red stone castle is situated in a strategic spot overlooking the River Esk. The drum tower, the oldest part of the current structure, an L Plan Castle, dates to the mid 15th century. The majority of the current castle dates to the 17th century. There was originally a dry moat surrounding the castle. The moat was later filled in but partially excavated in the late 20th century. 
Dalhousie Castle has seen much history. King Edward I (Longshanks) stayed at the castle on his way to meet Sir William Wallace at the Battle of Falkirk. In 1400, Sir Alexander Ramsay withstood a six-month siege at Dalhousie by English forces led by King Henry IV. Oliver Cromwell used the castle as a base for his invasion of Scotland. Many Earls of Dalhousie have taken an active part in British political and military leadership.

Around 1800, Walter Nicol designed the new layout of the walled garden.

At the turn of the 20th century, the seat of Clan Ramsay was moved to Brechin Castle, although the Ramsay family continued to retain ownership of the castle until 1977. At the time of the sale, Dalhousie had been in the same family for more than eight centuries, longer than any other castle in Scotland. Throughout the 20th century, the castle was leased out to a series of tenants, including a boarding school. In 1972, the castle was converted into a hotel. In 2003, Dalhousie Castle was purchased by the Von Essen Hotels company for a reported price of £10 million.

On 26 June 2004, a major fire erupted in the castle&#x27;s roof area. The building was evacuated and the Lothian and Borders Fire Brigade were called to extinguish the blaze. The damage was significant but limited to a relatively small area of the building, and no major structural damage occurred. The damage was repaired and the hotel resumed normal operations.

In April 2011, Von Essen Hotels fell into administration, and the hotel was available with a guide price of £7.5 million. In March 2012, it was announced that Robert Parker, owner of Doxford House, Eshott Hall and Guyzance Hall in Northumberland, had purchased Dalhousie Castle for an undisclosed sum.

<text>Elizabeth Lawrie Smellie, (March 22, 1884 – March 5, 1968) was a Canadian nurse and the first woman to be promoted to the rank of colonel in the Canadian Army.

==Early life==
Smellie was born in Port Arthur, Ontario, to Thomas Smellie, Conservative Member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario for Fort William and Lake of the Woods from 1905 to 1911, and Janet Eleanor ( Lawrie). She trained at the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing in Baltimore, Maryland. To her family and friends, she was known as &quot;Beth&quot;.

==Nursing career==
In August 1914, Smellie applied to be a Red Cross nurse; she was told to report to Ottawa on 25 January 1915. During the First World War, she was posted at Cliveden, Lady Astor&#x27;s estate, and became matron of the Moore Barracks Hospital at Shorncliffe Army Camp where thousands of Canadian soldiers were treated. In 1917 she was decorated by King George V at Buckingham Palace with the Royal Red Cross, first class.

After further post-war training in Boston, Smellie taught public health nursing for two years at McGill University, Montreal. She was Chief Superintendent of the Victorian Order of Nurses from January 1924 to May 1947, except during the Second World War, when she was recalled up into the Canadian Army as Colonel and Matron-in-chief of the Canadian Women&#x27;s Army Medical Corps from 1940 until 1944. She was the first woman to achieve the rank of colonel in the Canadian Army. A portrait of Smellie, painted by Kenneth Forbes, was unveiled by her successor in Ottawa in 1944.

Smellie was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1934.

Smellie frequently enjoyed getting back together with her nurse colleagues. For instance, on 29 May 1963, the Winnipeg Free Press published a picture of Smellie along with her three other wartime nursing sisters at a supper party. The supper party was organized in honor of Elizabeth by the Canadian Nursing Sisters Association in Deer Lodge Hospital nurses&#x27; lounge. The three nursing sisters with Smellie were Katherine Morton, Evelyn Pepper of Ottawa and Mrs. Alex Noble. She died in Toronto in 1968 at the age of 83 and is buried in Riverside Cemetery, Thunder Bay, Ontario.

==Legacy==
A historical marker to Smellie was erected by the Ontario Heritage Foundation, and stands in Waverley Park, Thunder Bay, Ontario. It reads:
This celebrated Canadian army nurse and public health authority was born in Port Arthur, Ontario. In 1901 &quot;Beth&quot; Smellie became night supervisor at McKellar General Hospital. Joining the Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps in 1915, she served in France and England. Elizabeth Smellie was demobilized in 1920 and three years later became Chief Superintendent of the Victorian Order of Nurses for Canada. She re-entered the army in 1940 and a year later supervised the organization of the Canadian Women&#x27;s Army Corps. The first woman to attain the rank of Colonel in Canada&#x27;s Armed Forces, Col. Smellie achieved many honours, including Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire and the Royal Red Cross Medal. After World War II she returned to the V.O.N., and retired in 1947.

Smellie was designated a Person of National Historic Significance in 2011 by the federal government, on the recommendation of the national Historic Sites and Monuments Board. A federal plaque is typically erected to such Persons, as well as for National Historic Events and Sites. As of 2015, one had not been installed to Smellie. The mandate of the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada is to advise the Government of Canada, through the Minister of the Environment, on the commemoration of nationally significant aspects of Canada&#x27;s history following a thorough evaluation process and recommendation by the Board, the Minister declares the site, event or person of national historic significance.

<text>George Shillibeer (11 August 1797 – 21 August 1866) was an English coachbuilder.

== Biography ==
Shillibeer was born in St Marylebone, London the son of Abraham and Elizabeth Shillibeer. Christened in St Marys Church, Marylebone on 22 October 1797, Shillibeer worked for the coach company Hatchetts in Long Acre, the coach-building district of the capital. In the 1820s he was offered work in Paris, France, where he was commissioned to build some unusually large horse-drawn coaches of &quot;novel design&quot;. The aim was to design a coach capable of transporting a whole group of people, perhaps two dozen, at a time.

Shillibeer&#x27;s design worked, and was very stable. It was introduced into the streets of Paris in 1827. Shortly afterwards, Shillibeer was commissioned to build another by the Newington Academy for Girls, a Quaker school in Stoke Newington near London; this had a total of twenty-five seats, and entered history as the first school bus. In 1827 Joseph Pease, a railway pioneer and later the first Quaker MP, wrote in verse about the school bus:

: The straight path of Truth the dear Girls keep their feet in,
: And ah! it would do your heart good Cousin Anne,
: To see them arriving at Gracechurch Street Meeting,
: All snugly packed up, 25 in a van.
Whilst in Paris, Shillibeer concluded that operating similar vehicles in London, but for the fare-paying public with multiple stops, would be a paying enterprise, so he returned to his native city. His first London &quot;Omnibus&quot; took up service on 4 July 1829 on the route between Paddington (The Yorkshire Stingo) and &quot;Bank&quot; (Bank of England) via the &quot;New Road&quot; (now Marylebone Rd), Somers Town and City Rd. Four services were provided in each direction daily. This service was described in the first advertisements as being &quot;upon the Parisian mode&quot; and that &quot;a person of great respectability attended his vehicle as Conductor&quot;. An account of the new service was given in the &quot;Morning Post&quot; of 7 July 1829:

Saturday the new vehicle, called the Omnibus, commenced running from Paddington to the City, and excited considerable notice, both from the novel form of the carriage, and the elegance with which it is fitted out. It is capable of accommodating 16 or 18 persons, all inside, and we apprehend it would be almost impossible to make it overturn, owing to the great width of the carriage. It was drawn by three beautiful bays abreast, after the French fashion. The Omnibus is a handsome machine, in the shape of a van. The width the horses occupy will render the vehicle rather inconvenient to be turned or driven through some of the streets of London.

A less successful innovation was his &quot;Funeral Omnibus&quot;, which combined a passenger vehicle with a hearse.

George Shillibeer died at Brighton, East Sussex on 21 August 1866 (some sources say 22 August), and is buried in the graveyard at St Mary&#x27;s Church at Chigwell in Essex.

In 1979, the 150th anniversary of the commencement of the first omnibus service in London, several London buses (twelve AEC Routemasters and one Leyland Fleetline) were operated in a green and yellow livery similar to Shillibeer&#x27;s Omnibus. These specially painted vehicles were displayed for their launch into service at the Guildhall in central London on Friday 2 March 1979. Poet laureate Sir John Betjeman was one of the guests at the ceremony. Also, a memorial service was held at the Chigwell Church attended by Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother.

Shillibeer Walk in Chigwell was named after him, and Shillibeer Place in Marylebone, as is a pub/restaurant named The George Shillibeer next to a converted omnibus factory in north London.

BBC &quot;Coast&quot; presenter Nicholas Crane, is a direct descendant.

<text>Robert Broughton Bryce, , (February 27, 1910 July 30, 1997) was a Canadian civil servant.

==Biography==

After graduating with engineering degree from the University of Toronto, Bryce undertook graduate studies in economics at University of Cambridge, where he was influenced by the ideas of John Maynard Keynes. In the fall of 1935, he left Britain for Harvard University where, as a graduate student, he introduced Keynesian economics in the United States, with the help of fellow Canadian Lorie Tarshis. According to John Kenneth Galbraith, Joseph Schumpeter &quot;called Keynes Allah and Bryce his Prophet&quot;.

Bryce started working for the Department of Finance in 1938, later becoming assistant deputy minister of Finance and Secretary to the Treasury Board. In 1954, he became clerk of the Privy Council and Secretary to the Cabinet. He retired in 1968 as deputy minister of Finance.

==Works==

He is the author of &quot;Maturing in Hard Times: Canada&#x27;s Department of Finance Through the Great Depression&quot; (McGill-Queen&#x27;s Press, 1986, ). His other book, &quot;Canada and the Cost of World War II: The International Operations of Canada&#x27;s Department of Finance, 1939-1947&quot; (McGill-Queen&#x27;s University Press, 2005, ), edited by Matthew J. Bellamy, was published after his death.

Leading a group of long-serving bureaucrats who gave Canadian government a sense of stability and consistency, Bryce served as secretary to the cabinet and clerk of the Privy Council under Liberal Louis Saint-Laurent and Conservative John Diefenbaker for nine years (1954–1963). This group continued through five administrations, from Mackenzie King to Pierre Trudeau. Bryce was appointed to chair the Royal Commission on Corporate Concentration in May 1975. He resigned due to illness before its completion, and can be considered to be one of the authors of the report.

==Honours==
In 1968, he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada &quot;for his services to Canada in various important posts of public administration&quot;.

He received honorary Doctor of Laws degrees from the University of Manitoba (1961), the University of Saskatchewan (1970), Mount Allison University (1970) and the University of British Columbia (1980).

<text>This Way is the fourth studio album by American singer-songwriter Jewel, released on November 13, 2001, by Atlantic Records. Jewel was looking for a raw, live-sounding album, leading her to be involved in the album&#x27;s production. The album spawned the singles &quot;Standing Still&quot; and &quot;Break Me&quot;, as well as the title track, which was also featured on the soundtrack to the film &quot;Life or Something Like It&quot;. The final single, &quot;Serve the Ego&quot;, was remixed by Hani Num and Mike Rizzo and topped the US Hot Dance Club Play chart. The album debuted at number nine on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with first-week sales of 140,000 units. The album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on December 17, 2001, and as of June 2010, it had sold over 1.5 million copies in the United States. &quot;This Way&quot; reached number six in Australia and has since been certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA).

<text>HMS &quot;Quorn&quot;, the third ship of this name, was a of the Royal Navy. She was launched on 23 January 1988, as the last ship of her class.

==Operational history==

On 18 March 2007, she was presented with the &quot;Freedom of the Borough&quot; scroll in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire.

From May 2011 to September 2014, &quot;Quorn&quot; was deployed to the Persian Gulf as part of the Royal Navy&#x27;s permanent presence in the region. Based in Bahrain, &quot;Quorn&quot;″s crew changed every six months enabling the ship to remain on station for a prolonged period without the costs associated with returning to the United Kingdom. During the deployment, &quot;Quorn&quot; was &quot;twinned&quot; with American minehunter .

&quot;Quorn&quot; spent the late spring and summer of 2015 on deployment in northern European waters, including the Baltic Sea as part of Standing NATO Mine Countermeasures Group One (SNMCMG1). During the deployment, she took part in Exercise Joint Warrior off Scotland, BALTOPS 2015 alongside HM Ships and and Kiel Week before returning to Portsmouth in July.

After spending a period alongside in extended readiness, &quot;Quorn&quot; was lifted out of the water into the &quot;Minor War Vessels Centre of Specialisation&quot;; the former shipbuilding hall at HMNB Portsmouth in December 2016. However, in October 2017 it was revealed that her planned refit would not take place, and &quot;Quorn&quot; would be decommissioned on 14 December 2017. The ship&#x27;s bell and naval ensign were presented to Quorn Parish Council in 2018 and are on display in the town&#x27;s community library.

==Lithuanian Navy==
On 30 April 2020 Defence Equipment Services announced she had been sold for £1 million to the Lithuanian Navy. In July 2022 the Ministry of Defence announced that Harland &amp; Wolff Appledore had been awarded the £55 million contract to renovate and restore the ship to an operational state.

In August 2024, McGuinness was the subject of the BBC genealogy programme &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;, which revealed that his paternal great-great-grandparents, Mark McGuinness and Winifred Molloy, were from Ballina, County Mayo in Ireland.

<doc id="1162013" wikidata="Q1532254" url="?curid=1162013" title="Hunt-class mine countermeasures vessel">
<text>The Hunt class is a class of thirteen mine countermeasure vessels of the Royal Navy. As built, they combined the separate roles of the traditional minesweeper and that of the active minehunter in one hull, but later modifications saw the removal of mine-sweeping equipment. They have a secondary role as offshore patrol vessels.

==Development==
Upon introduction in the early 1980s they were the largest warships ever built out of glass-reinforced plastic and were the last in operation to use the Napier Deltic diesel engine. All were built by Vosper Thornycroft in Woolston except and , which were built by Yarrow Shipbuilders Limited on the River Clyde. was the last ship of the class launched. 

Following the sale of and to the Greek Navy, the sale of and to the Lithuanian Navy and the decommissioning of , a contract to re-engine the remaining eight vessels was signed by BAE Systems in 2008, whereby the existing 30-year old Napier Deltic 9-59K power units were replaced by Caterpillar CAT C32 engines, together with new gearboxes, bow thrusters, propellers and control systems, in a six year refurbishment programme that was completed in 2018.

The capabilities of the remaining eight vessels of the Hunt class have been significantly enhanced by the installation of Sonar Type 2193 and the NAUTIS 3 command system. The performance of Sonar 2193 exceeds that of any other mine hunting sonar in service in the world today and is capable of detecting and classifying an object the size of a football at a distance of up to . In late 2007 &quot;Chiddingfold &quot; used the Seafox drone, the Royal Navy&#x27;s mine disposal system, during Exercise Neptune Warrior off Scotland. Seafox is described by the MOD as a &quot;state of the art fire and forget system, capable of destroying mines in depths of up to 300 metres&quot;.

The 2021 defence white paper announced that all the Hunt-class vessels would be retired from Royal Navy service in the 2020s and replaced by automated systems. It was subsequently indicated that the withdrawal would occur in the 2029 to 2031 period.

In 2023, the navy began to take delivery of six REMUS 300 small autonomous underwater vehicles (SAUVs), produced by Huntington Ingalls Industries. The system is being acquired to enhance the capabilities of the &quot;Hunt&quot;-class ships and has a reported operating depth of 300 meters with an endurance time of up to 20 hours.

==Ships in the class==
All 13 ships of this class re-used names from the World War II . Four of the names had also been used for World War I s: these were HMS &quot;Bicester&quot;, &quot;Cattistock&quot;, &quot;Cottesmore&quot; and &quot;Quorn&quot;. had been a paddlewheel minesweeper in 1916, and was a coaster taken up from trade in 1916.

<doc id="1162038" wikidata="Q5030463" url="?curid=1162038" title="Canadian Peace Congress">
<text>The Canadian Peace Congress (abbr. CPCon) is an anti-imperialist group founded in 1949 by Canadian minister James Gareth Endicott in response to the new dangers to peace posed because of the Cold War. It described itself as &quot;a place where people of different views and faiths can meet and discuss world affairs... and work together as effectively as possible to improve international relations and step by step [move] towards the goal of universal disarmament and a lasting peace&quot; The CPCon was the Canadian affiliate of the World Peace Council and a leading player in the peace movement in Canada, particularly in the 1950s and 1960s. The CPCon was active in the nuclear disarmament and anti-imperialist movements such as the movement against the Vietnam War and promoted the concept of peaceful co-existence between the Communist bloc and the Western bloc.

The CPCon was made up of affiliated local peace councils from across Canada as well as associate members including the Trade Union Peace Committee, the Labor-Progressive Party (as the Communist Party of Canada was then known), the Federation of Russian Canadians and the United Jewish Peoples&#x27; Order. Its founding meeting was attended by representatives of 47 different organizations and groups, including women&#x27;s, youth and church groups, trade unions, and ethnic associations. The organization also worked closely with many CCF activists.

Active councils of the CPCon were established in: British Columbia, Calgary, Edmonton, Fraser Valley, Guelph, Halifax, Hamilton, Kamsack, London, Niagara, Peterborough, Saskatoon, Sydney, Thunder Bay, Vernon, Victoria, and Windsor. These councils were active in campaigns against the Korean War, Vietnam War, the military coup in Chile, South African Apartheid, Zionism, US interventions into Nicaragua and Panama, NORAD and NATO as well as the arms race and nuclear build-up.

The CPCon was perceived as being close to the Labor-Progressive Party and its successor the Communist Party of Canada, though Endicott, himself, was not a party member. Endicott remained the CPCon&#x27;s chairman until 1971 when, according to his biography, he was pressured to resign by the leadership of the Communist Party for his pro-China views during the Sino-Soviet split. Endicott was succeeded by John Hanly Morgan who led the Congress as president until 1986. A Quebec Peace Congress, Conseil québécois de la paix, also established a nationally autonomous group separate from the Canadian Peace Congress in the 1970s. By the late 1970s, members who had authored publications for the Peace Congress included scientists, artists, musicians and writers from across the country.

During the 1980s struggles for nuclear disarmament, the Congress helped found the much broader Canadian Peace Alliance in 1985 as a more inclusive and less centralized network of peace organizations, including many newly formed groups (as opposed to the CPCon which was seen as aligned with the anti-imperialist current within the broad peace movement).

After 1986 Lari Prokop led the Congress until it became inactive in the early 1990s. At its 1991 conference, the CPCon decided to disaffiliate from the World Peace Council but the organization never formally dissolved. However, the Regina Peace Council continued its activity, publishing a regular newsletter and paying dues to the World Peace Council.

Although the Canada-wide Congress became inactive throughout the 1990s, by the mid-2000s an effort was made to re-establish Peace Councils in Edmonton and the BC Lower Mainland, in addition to Regina. The Canadian Peace Congress was then re-established in April 2006 at an Edmonton conference attended by 20 delegates from across Canada. A &quot;Special Renewal Conference&quot; was held in Winnipeg, Manitoba in 2008 which ratified the organization&#x27;s constitution and politics and elected as president David McKee, a trade unionist, and past co-chair of the Canadian Peace Alliance. The revived Canadian Peace Congress has affirmed its continuity with the original organization, and is again affiliated to the World Peace Council. Canadian delegates have attended various international meetings, and the Peace Congress hosted a trilateral meeting of Peace Congress&#x27;s from Mexico, USA and Cuba in October 2009, and again in 2016.

At the end of 2016, Dave McKee stepped down as President, and Miguel Figueroa became acting president of the Canadian Peace Congress early in 2017. He was elected President at its November 2018 convention held in Toronto.

By the end of 2018 there were active Peace Councils and/or affiliated peace coalitions in Surrey (Fraser Valley), Vancouver, and in the Southern Interior of B.C.; in Edmonton and Calgary, Alta.; Regina, Sask.; Winnipeg, Man.; Ottawa, Kingston, St. Catharines and Toronto, Ont.; and in Halifax, N.S.

<doc id="1162044" wikidata="Q248079" url="?curid=1162044" title="Osvaldo Cavandoli">
<text>Osvaldo Cavandoli (1 January 1920 – 3 March 2007), also known by his pen name Cava, was an Italian cartoonist. His most famous work is his series of short animated cartoons, &quot;La Linea&quot; (&quot;The Line&quot;).

==Early life, family and education==
Cavandoli was born in Maderno sul Garda, Italy, on the shores of Lake Garda. He and his family moved to Milan when he was two years old. (He was later made an honorary citizen of the city.)

==Career==
From 1936 to 1940, he worked as a technical designer for Alfa Romeo. When he developed his interest in cartoons in 1943, he started working with Nino Pagot, who later created &quot;Calimero&quot;. In 1950, he started working independently as a director and a producer.

===&quot;La Linea&quot;===
Cavandoli enjoyed worldwide recognition in 1969 with his character &quot;La Linea&quot;, a simply drawn cartoon born and lived out of a single white pencil stroke. Cavandoli initially proposed his work for &quot;Carosello&quot;, an Italian advertisement break broadcast between 1957 and 1977. Massimo Lagostina, the owner of a popular eponymous brand of cookware, chose it as a testimonial for his advertising campaign. Following the success of the commercial, &quot;La Linea&quot; became the protagonist of an animated series subsequently adopted in many European countries.

==Personal life and death==
Cavandoli died in Milan, Italy, at age 87.

<doc id="1162051" wikidata="Q5494239" url="?curid=1162051" title="Freakin' Funky Fuzzballs">
<text>Freakin&#x27; Funky Fuzzballs is a top-down puzzle video game written by Ian Currie and Robert Koller for DOS and published by Sir-Tech Software. In it, a fuzzball must navigate several maps and avoid the &quot;enemy.&quot;

==Gameplay==
There are two different kinds of worlds, fall-out maps and static maps. In fall-out maps, tiles change colors when stepped on and disappear when they turn blue. In static maps, the tiles change from dark to light pink.

In each case, the objective of each level is to find the proper number of keys or keycards to open the exit to the next level. The keys are buried under tiles and can only be revealed by stepping on the tiles.

In addition to keys, there are an assortment of other items-
*Rings increase the fuzzball&#x27;s vitality, or maximum amount of health.
*Food (many varieties exist) increase the fuzzball&#x27;s health.
*Wands let the fuzzball create a temporary bridge between two tiles.
*Potions yield +100 health and vitality.
*Armor permanently decreases the amount of damage dealt to the fuzzball by the enemy.
*Shields block the enemy&#x27;s attacks.
*Scrolls have unpredictable effects that cannot be determined until they are used.
*Teleporters teleport the fuzzball from one room to another.
*Doors, Gates, Elevators, and Airlocks take Fuzzball to the next level.
*The Match (final level) sets fire to the dynamite.
*The Dynamite (final level) blows up the enemy, ending the game.

==Reception==
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; called the game &quot;an original twist on old arcade inspirations ... an addictive pursuit reminiscent of &quot;Tetris&quot;&quot;.

<doc id="1162053" wikidata="Q5684660" url="?curid=1162053" title="Specialist Firearms Command">
<text>The Specialist Firearms Command (MO19) is the firearms unit of the Metropolitan Police Service. Formed in 2005, the Command is responsible for providing a firearms-response capability, assisting the rest of the service, which is not routinely armed.

==Precursors==
At its formation in 1829, the police service did not routinely carry firearms, but the Home Secretary later authorised the Commissioner to purchase fifty pairs of flintlock pistols for use in emergencies—such as those that involved the use of firearms.

As time progressed, the obsolete flintlocks were decommissioned from service, being superseded by early revolvers. At the time, burglary (or &quot;house breaking&quot; as it was then called) was a common problem for police, and &quot;house breakers&quot; were often armed. Due to killings of officers by armed criminals in the outer districts of the metropolis, and after public calls debating whether Peel&#x27;s service should be fully armed, the Commissioner applied to Peel for authorisation to supply officers in the outer districts with revolvers. The authorisation was issued on the condition that revolvers could only be issued if, in the opinion of the senior officer, the officer could be trusted to use it safely, and with discretion. From that point, officers who felt the need to be armed could be. The practice lasted until 1936, although the vast majority of the system was phased out by the end of the 19th century.

In the 1860s, the flintlock pistols that had been purchased in 1829 were decommissioned from service, being superseded by 622 Beaumont–Adams revolvers firing the .450 cartridge, which were loaned from the army stores at the Tower of London following the 1867 Clerkenwell bombing. In 1883, a ballot was carried out to gather information on officers&#x27; views about arming, and 4,430 out of 6,325 officers serving on outer divisions wanted to be issued with revolvers. The now-obsolete Adams revolver was returned to stores for emergencies, and the Bulldog &#x27;Metropolitan Police&#x27; revolver was issued to officers on the outer districts who felt the need to be armed. On 18 February 1887, PC 52206 Henry Owen became the first officer to fire a revolver while on duty, after being unable to alert the inhabitants of a premises on fire. Following the Siege of Sidney Street in 1911, one thousand self-loading Webley &amp; Scott pistols were purchased. In 1914, the Bulldogs were withdrawn from service and returned to stores. Lord Trenchard standardised the issue of pistols among divisions with the number of firearms issued depending on the size of the area; ten pistols with 320 rounds of ammunition were issued to divisional stations, six pistols with 192 rounds per sub-divisional station, and three pistols with 96 rounds to each section station. In 1936, the authorisation to carry revolvers on outer districts was revoked, and at the same time Canadian Ross rifles were purchased in the prelude to the Second World War.

A review in 1952 following the Derek Bentley case found 15% of firearms in service to be defective; leading to Special Branch and Royalty Protection Officers being re-armed with an early version of the Beretta semi-automatic pistol.

==History==
===1966–1979===
As it was originally named, the Firearms Wing (designation D6) was formed as part of the Civil Defence and Communications Branch within &#x27;D&#x27; Department. The wing was formed in response to the murder of three officers. The Commissioner requested applications from officers within the service who had experience in the handling of firearms, such as ex-members of the armed forces or those who attended shooting clubs. The officers who applied were sent to the Small Arms Wing of the School of Infantry to become permanent instructors for the service&#x27;s newly formed firearms wing. Upon the officers&#x27; return to the service, they trained firearms officers.

After the unit had changed its name from D6 to D11, the Instructors possessed a limited operational role that consisted of providing CS gas at sieges. This progressed to providing tactical advice and support and in 1975 as a direct result of the Munich Olympic games massacre, D11 was formally given an operational role in Counter Terrorist and serious armed crime operations. Its officers qualified using the Smith &amp; Wesson Model 28 or Model 19 .357 revolvers, Browning Hi-Power semi-automatic pistols, the Heckler &amp; Koch MP5 SD (Suppressed) submachine gun and the Remington 870 shotgun with some officers being trained and authorised to use the Enfield Enforcer 7.62 mm sniper rifle and Heckler &amp; Koch 93 semi-automatic rifle in 5.56mm for counter-sniper roles. Throughout the 1970s, the branch increased in size, with additional firearms instructors being recruited to meet the increase in the demand for firearms training. During the 1970s, D11 officers qualified their students in the Smith &amp; Wesson Model 36 and the Model 10 revolvers.

===1980–1999===

In response to operational demands, the department underwent restructuring in 1987 becoming PT17 (Personnel &amp; Training) and the introduction of non-instructors who formed level 2 teams. Their role was to deal with pre-planned and response operations not involving hostages or suspects with &#x27;exceptional firepower&#x27;. These tasks remained the responsibility of the teams of Instructors who became Level 1 teams. In 1991 following the shooting and stabbing of several police officers, the armed response vehicles (ARVs) were introduced, with their concept influenced by West Yorkshire Police&#x27;s &quot;Instant Response Cars&quot;, as used in 1976. The vehicles were put under the control of the unit drastically increasing its manpower and necessitating its move to Specialist Operations and a new designation of SO19, the Force Firearms Unit. Following their success, forces outside of the capital later formed them throughout the early to mid-1990s. 

Early ARVs contained a secure safe between the seats containing a .38 Smith &amp; Wesson Model 10 for each member, with two 9 mm Heckler &amp; Koch MP5 semi-automatic carbines secured in the boot. After ARVs became established, and the practice was accepted for widespread use, the Model 10 revolvers were replaced by more recent self-loading Glock 17s, firing 9 mm rounds.

Revolvers and pistols could be removed from the secure safe by ARV members, if an &quot;immediate threat to life&quot; was posed, in the opinion of the ARV member. Authorisation to remove carbines required authorisation from the control room once they had contacted an officer of Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) rank. If a high-ranking officer could not be sought to gain authorisation, such could be given by a Chief Inspector in an emergency. In recent years ARV members have carried their personal pistols on them as a matter of routine.

===2000–present===
ARV officers provided rapid response to spontaneous firearms incidents, such as armed robberies, being the first such organised system the capital had witnessed. Early ARV officers were issued with Smith &amp; Wesson Model 10s, with others being trained in the use of the Heckler &amp; Koch MP5 semi-automatic carbine. The Model 10 was later replaced by the Glock 17 semi-automatic pistol. Following a further reorganisation in 2005, SO19 became CO19, due to the department&#x27;s move to the Central Operations Directorate; at the same time, the department was renamed from the Force Firearms Unit to the Specialist Firearms Command.

The unit maintained its training role and continued to train the Met&#x27;s 4,800 officers who were redesignated as authorised firearms officers (AFOs). The level 2 officers underwent enhanced training and those that passed joined selected Level 1 instructors to become Specialist Firearms Officers (SFOs). SFO teams replaced the old Level 1 and 2 structure becoming full-time tactical teams dealing with all pre planned armed operations (robbery ambushes, warrant service and hostage situations etc.) within the Met and providing specialist support to the ARVs.

In January 2012 the branch underwent another name change, becoming SCO19 due to the merger of Central Operations (CO) and Specialist Crime Directorate (SCD) to form Specialist Crime &amp; Operations. Since then SCO19 has again been re-designated as MO19, a result of the 2018–19 restructuring, putting it under Met Ops while maintaining the title of SCO19.

==Current role==
All aspects of armed policing in the UK are covered by guidance issued by the Association of Chief Police Officers in their &quot;Manual of Guidance on the Police Use of Firearms&quot;. This manual provides an overview of the basic principles such as rules of engagement and tactics involved in the use of firearms by police officers in different environments along with details of command structures that are in place in all planned and spontaneous firearms operations.

===Training===

As of 2007, the Command is responsible for training the 2,594 AFOs of the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS). These include officers from Protection Command, Counter Terrorism Command, the Aviation Security Operational Command Unit, the Flying Squad (SCD7[5]), the Territorial Support Group and the armed officers from MO19 itself.

Potential AFOs are invited to attend the Training Centre after they have undergone the written tests and interviews, and successfully completed their probationary period with a further two years in a core policing role. They undergo two weeks of intensive training on the Glock 17 Pistol and the Heckler &amp; Koch MP5 carbine; both weapons use 9mm rounds. This is followed by a further nine weeks of training focused on ARV tactics and searching buildings.

Based at MPSTC, MO19 provides initial and continuation training for all MPS firearms officers. There are more than twenty courses provided by nationally accredited firearms instructors. Courses are based on the National Firearms Training Curriculum, to cover the variety of roles covered by AFOs in the MPS. The courses range from firepower demonstrations (to highlight the dangers of firearms to new MPS recruits) and initial firearms courses, to Operational Firearms Commander (OFC) training and National Firearms Instructor courses. There were 683 courses run at MPSTC in the 2006–07 financial year.

===Current organisation===
MO19 currently has two tiers of armed officers.

==== Armed response vehicles (ARVs) ====
The first tier is the armed response vehicle, or ARV. Commonly referred to as the Trojans, ARVs are responsible for patrolling the city and to provide immediate armed support to other police units. ARVs conduct targeted patrols of high crime areas, and are trained to engage in high speed pursuits.

Each ARV is crewed by 3 armed response officers: driver, communications operator and observer/navigator.

====Counter Terrorist Specialist Firearms Officers (CT-SFO)====
The highest tier is the Counter Terrorist Specialist Firearms Officer teams, which deal with MPS operations and also national firearms operations as part of the CTSFO Network. They provide firearms support to borough and specialist units. They are multi-skilled and can deliver all elements of armed policing, including operations to combat major crime, hostage taking and terrorism.

MO19 has seven CTSFO teams consisting of one sergeant and 15 constables, both male and female, with six CTSFO Inspectors and an Operational Senior Manager with a reported strength of 130 officers. An operational CTSFO team works a 7-week shift-pattern which includes night duty. CTSFO teams are able to be deployed by air or the river, using armoured vehicles and motorcycles if needed. On 28 July 2014, the single armed response vehicle service was launched.

In preparation for the Summer Olympics held in London in July 2012, officers were up-skilled from SFO standard, to a new certification known as Counter Terrorist Specialist Firearms Officer (CTSFO). This included the use of live rounds during close quarters combat (CQC) training and fast-roping from helicopters, to be able to respond more effectively to terrorist incidents. The training was conducted jointly with the United Kingdom Special Forces.

On 30 June 2015, CTSFO teams participated in &quot;Operation Strong Tower&quot; held in London, the largest counter-terrorism exercise conducted in the United Kingdom. The MPS released statistics that between January 2015 and December 2015 CTSFO teams were involved in 144 operations.

On 3 August 2016, the MPS held a press conference for the announcement of &quot;Operation Hercules&quot;, displaying the CTSFO teams to the public wearing wolf-grey-coloured tactical uniforms, equipped with SIG Sauer SIG516 and SIG MCX carbines, Glock 17 handguns, Remington 870 shotgun, Accuracy International AT308 sniper rifle, and paraded the BMW F800GS motorcycles used for deployments in central London.

On 19 March 2017, CTSFO teams participated in maritime &quot;Exercise Anchor&quot; on the River Thames, their first joint major live-play exercise. On 22 March 2017, CTSFO teams rapidly deployed to the 2017 Westminster attack.

CTSFO teams use the Jankel Guardian armoured vehicle based on a Ford F-450 chassis, as well as various other unmarked vehicles, including Toyota Land Cruisers, BMW X5s and Land Rover Discoveries. The CTSFO training facilities at the MPS Specialist Training Centre includes indoor and outdoor live-fire shooting ranges, an assault house for practising method of entry (MOE) techniques and train, subway and aircraft mock-ups.

CTSFOs volunteers are recruited from serving ARV officers. A candidate has to be recommended by their supervisor, undertake a two-day assessment and pass both shooting and physical standards. If candidates pass this stage they will then be offered a place on a CTSFO course where they will begin to up-skill to their new role.

== Equipment ==

=== Firearms ===

As of April 2019, the following firearms are in use by the Specialist Firearms Command:

=== Less lethal ===

Officers are also equipped with the non-lethal Taser X26s and X2s. All officers are also issued with the same basic equipment as other police officers, which includes ASP Baton, CS Gas, Speedcuffs, and radios.

=== Body armour ===
MO19 officers are equipped with bulletproof vests, instead of the standard stabproof vest which only has low-level ballistic capability.

==History==

The original product, EasyBusiness Systems, was developed for the CP/M operating system in 1976 by Don Thomson, Ted Comfoltey, Keith Wales, and Norm Francis of Basic Software Group and distributed by Information Unlimited Software. This was ported to MS-DOS and the IBM-PC in 1983.

Computer Associates acquired Information Unlimited Software in 1983 and ran it as an independent business unit. Easy Business Systems added payroll processing in 1984 and supported multiuser networking at this time. In 1987, it implemented a multi-window interface to allow moving between different modules. Easy Business Systems was renamed Accpac Plus in 1987 with the release of version 5. Accpac became popular in Canada with support of Canadian public accounting firms that would sell and support the software. The name Accpac is an acronym for &#x27;A Complete and Comprehensive Program for Accounting Control&#x27;.

The first Windows version, CA-Accpac/2000, popularly known as ACCPAC for Windows, was developed in the early 1990s and released in October 1994. The Windows version marked the move to client/server and was developed with all new code in COBOL with Computer Associates development tools (these components were redeveloped in 2001 in Accpac Advantage Series with a core business layer developed in C and a user interface layer developed in Visual Basic).

In October 1996 ACCPAC for Windows 2.0 was released. In August 2001, the company presented ACCPAC Advantage Series 5.0, its first web-based version. The web interface was rebuilt in Sage 300 2016 for cross browser support, running on IIS with ASP.Net, a web API was added in the 2017.

Sage 300 initially ran on Btrieve Databases and then supported a variety of database backends. Since Sage 300 2016 only the MS SQL database is supported.

Sage Software acquired Accpac from Computer Associates in 2004. Sage renamed it Sage Accpac ERP in 2006, then Sage ERP Accpac in 2009. Sage dropped the Accpac name in 2012 when it was renamed to Sage 300 ERP.

<doc id="1162065" wikidata="Q520777" url="?curid=1162065" title="Boolean data type">
<text>In computer science, the Boolean (sometimes shortened to Bool) is a data type that has one of two possible values (usually denoted &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot;) which is intended to represent the two truth values of logic and Boolean algebra. It is named after George Boole, who first defined an algebraic system of logic in the mid 19th century. The Boolean data type is primarily associated with conditional statements, which allow different actions by changing control flow depending on whether a programmer-specified Boolean &quot;condition&quot; evaluates to true or false. It is a special case of a more general &quot;logical data type—&quot;logic does not always need to be Boolean (see probabilistic logic).

== Generalities ==
In programming languages with a built-in Boolean data type, such as Pascal, C, Python or Java, the comparison operators such as codice_1 and codice_2 are usually defined to return a Boolean value. Conditional and iterative commands may be defined to test Boolean-valued expressions.

Languages with no explicit Boolean data type, like C90 and Lisp, may still represent truth values by some other data type. Common Lisp uses an empty list for false, and any other value for true. The C programming language uses an integer type, where relational expressions like codice_3 and logical expressions connected by codice_4 and codice_5 are defined to have value 1 if true and 0 if false, whereas the test parts of codice_6, codice_7, codice_8, etc., treat any non-zero value as true. Indeed, a Boolean variable may be regarded (and implemented) as a numerical variable with one binary digit (bit), or as a bit string of length one, which can store only two values. The implementation of Booleans in computers are most likely represented as a full word, rather than a bit; this is usually due to the ways computers transfer blocks of information.

Most programming languages, even those with no explicit Boolean type, have support for Boolean algebraic operations such as conjunction (codice_9, codice_10, codice_11), disjunction (codice_12, codice_13, codice_14), equivalence (codice_15, codice_16, codice_17), exclusive or/non-equivalence (codice_18, codice_19, codice_20, codice_21, codice_22), and negation (codice_23, codice_24, codice_25, codice_22).

In some languages, like Ruby, Smalltalk, and Alice the &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot; values belong to separate classes, e.g., codice_27 and codice_28, respectively, so there is no one Boolean &quot;type&quot;.

In SQL, which uses a three-valued logic for explicit comparisons because of its special treatment of Nulls, the Boolean data type (introduced in ) is also defined to include more than two truth values, so that SQL &quot;Booleans&quot; can store all logical values resulting from the evaluation of predicates in SQL. A column of Boolean type can be restricted to just codice_29 and codice_30 though.

== Language-specific implementations ==

=== ALGOL and the built-in BOOLEAN type ===
One of the earliest programming languages to provide an explicit codice_31 data type is ALGOL 60 (1960) with values &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot; and logical operators denoted by symbols &#x27;formula_1&#x27; (and), &#x27;formula_2&#x27; (or), &#x27;formula_3&#x27; (implies), &#x27;formula_4&#x27; (equivalence), and &#x27;formula_5&#x27; (not). Due to input device and character set limits on many computers of the time, however, most compilers used alternative representations for many of the operators, such as codice_9 or codice_33.

This approach with codice_31 as a built-in (either primitive or otherwise predefined) data type was adopted by many later programming languages, such as Simula 67 (1967), ALGOL 68 (1970), Pascal (1970), Ada (1980), Java (1995), and C# (2000), among others.

=== Fortran ===
The first version of FORTRAN (1957) and its successor FORTRAN II (1958) have no logical values or operations; even the conditional codice_35 statement takes an arithmetic expression and branches to one of three locations according to its sign; see arithmetic IF. FORTRAN IV (1962), however, follows the ALGOL 60 example by providing a Boolean data type (codice_36), truth literals (codice_37 and codice_38), logical codice_35 statement, Boolean-valued numeric comparison operators (codice_40, codice_41, etc.), and logical operators (codice_42, codice_43, codice_44, codice_45, and codice_46). In codice_47 statements, a specific format descriptor (&#x27;codice_48&#x27;) is provided for the parsing or formatting of logical values. Fortran 90 added alternative comparison operators codice_49, codice_50, codice_17, codice_52, codice_1, and codice_54.

=== Lisp and Scheme ===
The language Lisp (1958) never had a built-in Boolean data type. Instead, conditional constructs like codice_55 assume that the logical value &quot;false&quot; is represented by the empty list codice_56, which is defined to be the same as the special atom codice_57 or codice_58; whereas any other s-expression is interpreted as &quot;true&quot;. For convenience, most modern dialects of Lisp predefine the atom codice_59 to have value codice_59, so that codice_59 can be used as a mnemonic notation for &quot;true&quot;.

This approach (&quot;any value can be used as a Boolean value&quot;) was retained in most Lisp dialects (Common Lisp, Scheme, Emacs Lisp), and similar models were adopted by many scripting languages, even ones having a distinct Boolean type or Boolean values; although which values are interpreted as &quot;false&quot; and which are &quot;true&quot; vary from language to language. In Scheme, for example, the &quot;false&quot; value is an atom distinct from the empty list, so the latter is interpreted as &quot;true&quot;. Common Lisp, on the other hand, also provides the dedicated codice_62 type, derived as a specialization of the symbol.

=== Pascal, Ada, and Haskell ===
The language Pascal (1970) popularized the concept of programmer-defined enumerated types, previously available with different nomenclature in COBOL, FACT and JOVIAL. A built-in codice_63 data type was then provided as a predefined enumerated type with values codice_30 and codice_29. By definition, all comparisons, logical operations, and conditional statements applied to and/or yielded codice_63 values. Otherwise, the codice_63 type had all the facilities which were available for enumerated types in general, such as ordering and use as indices. In contrast, converting between codice_63s and integers (or any other types) still required explicit tests or function calls, as in ALGOL 60. This approach (&quot;Boolean is an enumerated type&quot;) was adopted by most later languages which had enumerated types, such as Modula, Ada, and Haskell.

=== C, C++, D, Objective-C, AWK ===
Initial implementations of the language C (1972) provided no Boolean type, and to this day Boolean values are commonly represented by integers (codice_69s) in C programs. The comparison operators (codice_1, codice_17, etc.) are defined to return a signed integer (codice_69) result, either 0 (for false) or 1 (for true). Logical operators (codice_4, codice_5, codice_25, etc.) and condition-testing statements (codice_6, codice_7) assume that zero (and hence a NULL pointer or a null string terminator &#x27;\0&#x27; also) is false and all other values are true.

After enumerated types (codice_78s) were added to the American National Standards Institute version of C, ANSI C (1989), many C programmers got used to defining their own Boolean types as such, for readability reasons. However, enumerated types are equivalent to integers according to the language standards; so the effective identity between Booleans and integers is still valid for C programs.

Standard C (since C99) provides a Boolean type, called codice_79. By including the header codice_80, one can use the more intuitive name codice_81 and the constants codice_82 and codice_83. The language guarantees that any two true values will compare equal (which was impossible to achieve before the introduction of the type). Boolean values still behave as integers, can be stored in integer variables, and used anywhere integers would be valid, including in indexing, arithmetic, parsing, and formatting. This approach (&quot;Boolean values are just integers&quot;) has been retained in all later versions of C. Note, that this does not mean that any integer value can be stored in a Boolean variable.

C++ has a separate Boolean data type codice_81, but with automatic conversions from scalar and pointer values that are very similar to those of C. This approach was adopted also by many later languages, especially by some scripting languages such as AWK.

The D programming language has a proper Boolean data type codice_81. The codice_81 type is a byte-sized type that can only hold the value true or false.
The only operators that can accept operands of type bool are: &amp;, |, ^, &amp;=, |=, ^=, !, &amp;&amp;, || and ?:.
A codice_81 value can be implicitly converted to any integral type, with false becoming 0 and true becoming 1.
The numeric literals 0 and 1 can be implicitly converted to the bool values false and true, respectively. Casting an expression to codice_81 means testing for 0 or !=0 for arithmetic types, and null or !=null for pointers or references.

Objective-C also has a separate Boolean data type codice_89, with possible values being codice_90 or codice_91, equivalents of true and false respectively. Also, in Objective-C compilers that support C99, C&#x27;s codice_79 type can be used, since Objective-C is a superset of C.

===Java===

In Java, the value of the codice_62 data type can only be either codice_82 or codice_83.

=== Perl and Lua ===
Perl has no Boolean data type. Instead, any value can behave as Boolean in Boolean context (condition of codice_6 or codice_7 statement, argument of codice_4 or codice_5, etc.). The number codice_100, the strings codice_101 and codice_102, the empty list codice_56, and the special value codice_104 evaluate to false. All else evaluates to true.

Lua has a Boolean data type, but non-Boolean values can also behave as Booleans. The non-value codice_57 evaluates to false, whereas every other data type value evaluates to true. This includes the empty string codice_102 and the number codice_100, which are very often considered codice_83 in other languages.

=== PL/I ===
PL/I has no Boolean data type. Instead, comparison operators generate BIT(1) values; &#x27;0&#x27;B represents false and &#x27;1&#x27;B represents true. The operands of, e.g., codice_109, codice_110, codice_111, are converted to bit strings and the operations are performed on each bit. The &quot;element-expression&quot; of an codice_112 statement is true if any bit is 1.

=== Rexx ===
Rexx has no Boolean data type. Instead, comparison operators generate 0 or 1; 0 represents false and 1 represents true. The operands of, e.g., codice_109, codice_110, codice_111, must be 0 or 1.

=== Tcl ===
Tcl has no separate Boolean type. Like in C, the integers 0 (false) and 1 (true—in fact any nonzero integer) are used.

Examples of coding:

The above will show since the expression evaluates to 1.

The above will render an error, as variable cannot be evaluated as 0 or 1.

=== Python, Ruby, and JavaScript ===

Python, from version 2.3 forward, has a codice_81 type which is a subclass of codice_69, the standard integer type. It has two possible values: codice_27 and codice_28, which are &quot;special versions&quot; of 1 and 0 respectively and behave as such in arithmetic contexts. Also, a numeric value of zero (integer or fractional), the null value (codice_120), the empty string, and empty containers (lists, sets, etc.) are considered Boolean false; all other values are considered Boolean true by default. Classes can define how their instances are treated in a Boolean context through the special method codice_121 (Python 2) or codice_122 (Python 3). For containers, codice_123 (the special method for determining the length of containers) is used if the explicit Boolean conversion method is not defined.

In Ruby, in contrast, only codice_57 (Ruby&#x27;s null value) and a special codice_83 object are &quot;false&quot;; all else (including the integer 0 and empty arrays) is &quot;true&quot;.

=== SQL ===
Booleans appear in SQL when a condition is needed, such as clause, in form of predicate which is produced by using operators such as comparison operators, operator, etc. However, apart from and , these operators can also yield a third state, called , when comparison with  is made.

The SQL92 standard introduced and operators which evaluate a predicate, which predated the introduction of Boolean type in .

The SQL:1999 standard introduced a data type as an optional feature (T031). When restricted by a constraint, a SQL behaves like Booleans in other languages, which can store only and values. However, if it is nullable, which is the default like all other SQL data types, it can have the special null value also. Although the SQL standard defines three literals for the type – and it also says that the and &quot;may be used interchangeably to mean exactly the same thing&quot;. This has caused some controversy because the identification subjects to the equality comparison rules for NULL. More precisely is not but . As of 2012 few major SQL systems implement the T031 feature. Firebird and PostgreSQL are notable exceptions, although PostgreSQL implements no literal; can be used instead.

The treatment of Boolean values differs between SQL systems.

For example, in Microsoft SQL Server, Boolean value is not supported at all, neither as a standalone data type nor representable as an integer. It shows the error message &quot;An expression of non-Boolean type specified in a context where a condition is expected&quot; if a column is directly used in the clause, e.g. , while a statement such as yields a syntax error. The data type, which can only store integers 0 and 1 apart from , is commonly used as a workaround to store Boolean values, but workarounds need to be used such as to convert between the integer and Boolean expression.

Microsoft Access, which uses the Access Database Engine (ACE/JET), also does not have a Boolean data type.
Similar to MS SQL Server, it uses a data type. In Access it is known as a Yes/No data type which can have two values; Yes (True) or No (False).
The BIT data type in Access can also be represented numerically:
True is −1 and False is 0.
This differs from MS SQL Server in two ways, even though both are Microsoft products:

# Access represents as −1, while it is 1 in SQL Server
# Access does not support the Null tri-state, supported by SQL Server

PostgreSQL has a distinct type as in the standard, which allows predicates to be stored directly into a column, and allows using a column directly as a predicate in a clause.

In MySQL, is treated as an alias of ;
 is the same as integer 1 and is the same as integer 0.
Any non-zero integer is true in conditions.

=== Tableau ===
Tableau Software has a BOOLEAN data type. The literal of a Boolean value is codice_27 or codice_28.

The Tableau codice_128 function converts a Boolean to a number, returning 1 for True and 0 for False.

=== Forth ===
Forth (programming language) has no Boolean type, it uses regular integers: value 0 (all bits low) represents false, and -1 (all bits high) represents true. This allows the language to define only one set of logical operators, instead of one for mathematical calculations and one for conditions.

<text>Soheib Bencheikh (; born 20 December 1961, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia) is an Islamic religious leader and author and would-be French politician.

Bencheikh graduated in Islamic theology at Al-Azhar University, Cairo, Egypt, and at the Free University of Brussels, Belgium. He holds a doctorate in Religious Sciences from the École pratique des hautes études (EPHE), Paris, France. He was nominated as Grand Mufti of Marseille, France, in 1995 by the Great Mosque of Paris. He is a member of the Conseil français du culte musulman (Council of French Muslims) since its creation in 2003.

Bencheikh is an anti-fundamentalist religious leader and an assertive supporter of an Islam eager and capable to adapt itself to the modern world. He also is acknowledged as a reformer Muslim theologian committed to interreligious dialogue. He has written two books &quot;Les Grandes Religions&quot; and &quot;Marianne et le Prophète: L&#x27;Islam dans la France laïque&quot;, his famous book on the position and opportunities for Muslims in secular democracy.

Among other &quot;modernist&quot; points of view, he stated that education is the best protection of women&#x27;s honor and well-being (and not the headscarf, which he says is not mandatory).

Bencheikh attempted to run for president in the 2007 French presidential election but failed to get the 500 endorsements needed in order to become an official candidate. He created the movement “Elan Républicain” specifically for this purpose.

<doc id="1162068" wikidata="Q716180" url="?curid=1162068" title="Hobart's Funnies">
<text>Hobart&#x27;s Funnies is the nickname given to a number of specialist armoured fighting vehicles derived from tanks operated during the Second World War by units of the 79th Armoured Division of the British Army or by specialists from the Royal Engineers.

They were designed in light of problems that more standard tanks experienced during the amphibious Dieppe Raid, so that the new models would be able to overcome the problems of the planned invasion of Normandy. These tanks played a major part on the Commonwealth beaches during the landings. They were forerunners of the modern combat engineering vehicle and took their nickname from the 79th Division&#x27;s commander, Major General Percy Hobart.

The vehicles converted were chiefly Churchill tanks and American-supplied M4 Sherman tanks.

==History==
Plans to invade continental Europe were completely revised after the failure of the raid on Dieppe in 1942. Allied units in Normandy would need to overcome terrain, obstacles and coastal fortifications if the invasion were to succeed. General Sir Alan Brooke, Chief of the Imperial General Staff decided in 1943 to create special units and assigned responsibility to armoured warfare expert Percy Hobart for the development of vehicles and training crews to use them in action.

Many of the ideas had already been tried, tested or were in experimental development both by Britain and other nations. For example, the Scorpion flail tank, a modified Matilda tank, had already been used during the North African campaign to clear paths through German minefields. Soviet T-34 tanks had been modified with mine-rollers. Close-support tanks, bridgelayers, and fascine carriers had been developed elsewhere also. However, the Funnies were the largest and most elaborate collection of engineering vehicles available.

By early 1944, Hobart could demonstrate to Generals Eisenhower and Montgomery a brigade each of swimming Duplex Drive (DD) amphibious tanks, &quot;Crab&quot; mine clearers, and AVRE tanks along with a regiment of Churchill Crocodile flame-thrower tanks.

Montgomery considered that the US forces should use them. A third of the &quot;funnies&quot; were offered to the Americans of all the vehicles available, but take-up was minimal. Eisenhower was in favour of the DD tanks but left the decision on the others to General Bradley. The Americans were reluctant to make use of the funnies because it was thought that they would require specialised training and an additional support organisation, and those based on the Churchill tank would entail the logistical complexity of adding another tank model to their inventory.

Bradley did request 25 flail tanks and 100 Churchill Crocodiles shortly after the demonstration in February 1944, and the British War Office agreed to supply them as well as British-crewed AVREs. However, there was judged to be insufficient time to produce the vehicles and train crews for the Normandy invasion, so on the day American forces were limited to DD tanks and their own Sherman bulldozer tanks and armoured bulldozers. 42 Assault Brigade, instead of supporting the US beaches, became a reserve for the British and Canadian beaches.

Considering results of the US landing on Omaha Beach, Bradley&#x27;s decision has been criticised as it was felt that use of the range of &quot;Funnies&quot; could have saved American lives. After D-Day, American forces did make limited use of the Sherman Crab mine-clearing tank.

== Designs ==
The majority of the designs were modified forms of the Churchill tank or the Sherman tank. Both were available in large numbers. The Churchill had good (though slow) cross-country performance, heavy armour, and a roomy interior. The Sherman&#x27;s mechanical reliability was valued.

Among the many specialist vehicles and their attachments were:

The Churchill Crocodile was a Churchill tank modified by the fitting of a flame-thrower in place of the hull machine gun. An armoured trailer, towed behind the tank, carried 400 Imperial gallons (1,800 litres) of fuel. The flamethrower had a range of over 120 yards (110 metres), far greater than man-portable units. Regarded as a powerful psychological weapon, this flame tank proved highly effective at clearing bunkers, trenches and other German fortifications.

The main vehicle in the 79th Armoured Division was the Assault Vehicle Royal Engineers (AVRE) which was a Churchill tank adapted for attacking defensive fortifications. The Churchill&#x27;s main gun was replaced by a spigot mortar (known as &quot;Petard&quot;) that fired a 40lb (18 kg) HE-filled projectile nicknamed the &quot;flying dustbin&quot; around 150 yards (140 m). This was capable of destroying concrete obstacles such as roadblocks and bunkers. The mortar had to be reloaded externally by opening a hatch and sliding a round into the mortar tube from the hull. The crew of six were drawn from the Royal Engineers, except for the driver who came from the Royal Armoured Corps. One of the RE crew was a demolitions NCO sapper responsible for priming the &quot;flying dustbin&quot; as well as leading or supervising when they dismounted from the tank (which was easily done through the side hatches) to place demolition charges (&quot;Wade&quot; charges). Various attachments were designed to be carried and operated by the AVRE to enhance its capabilities. This equipment included
* Bobbin: A reel of wide canvas cloth reinforced with steel poles carried in front of the tank and unrolled onto the ground to form a &quot;path&quot;, so that following vehicles (and the deploying vehicle itself) would not sink into the soft ground of the beaches during the amphibious landing.
* Fascine: A bundle of wooden poles or rough brushwood lashed together with wires carried in front of the tank that could be released to fill a ditch or form a step. Metal pipes in the centre of the fascine allowed water to flow through.
* Small Box Girder: An assault bridge that was carried in front of the tank and could be dropped to span a gap in 30 seconds.
* Bullshorn Plough: A mine plough intended to excavate the ground in front of the tank to expose and detonate any land mines.
*&quot;Double Onion&quot;: Two large demolition charges on a metal frame that could be placed against a concrete wall and detonated from a safe distance. The tank could place demolition charges at heights up to 12 feet. The tank was driven against a wall, and the framework was lowered into the ground against the wall. The tank then backed up 100 feet, laying out an electric detonating cable. The explosives were then detonated by the tank driver. It was the successor to the single-charge device &quot;Carrot&quot;. It was also called the &quot;Jones Onion&quot;. A larger development was called &quot;Goat&quot;.

Other vehicles included
*ARK (Armoured Ramp Carrier): A turretless Churchill tank that had extendable ramps at each end; other vehicles could drive up the ramps and over the vehicle to scale obstacles, effectively using it as a mobile bridge.

* Crab: A modified Sherman tank equipped with a mine flail, a rotating cylinder of weighted chains that exploded mines in the path of the tank.
* DD tank (from &quot;Duplex Drive&quot;): An amphibious version of the Sherman created by fitting M4A1 and M4A4 with a large watertight canvas housing. This increased displacement so the tank was able to float and reach the shore after being launched from a landing craft up to several miles from the beach. They were intended to give support to the first waves of infantry that attacked the beaches. A Valentine tank version was developed first but used for training only.
* Armoured bulldozer: A conventional Caterpillar D6 or D7 bulldozer fitted with armour to protect the driver and the engine. Their job was to clear the invasion beaches of obstacles and to make roads accessible by clearing rubble and filling in bomb craters. Though frequently said to have been converted by UK Caterpillar importer Jack Olding &amp; Company Ltd of Hatfield, these vehicles were built complete with armoured cab and bulldozer blade by Caterpillar itself in the USA.
* Centaur Bulldozer: A Centaur tank with the turret removed and fitted with a simple winch-operated bulldozer blade. These were produced because of a need for a well-armoured obstacle-clearing vehicle that, unlike a conventional bulldozer, would be fast enough to keep up with tank formations. They were not used on D-Day but were issued to the 79th Armoured Division in Belgium during the latter part of 1944.
* Canal Defence Light: A powerful carbon-arc searchlight carried on several types of tank inside a modified turret. The name of the device was deliberately inaccurate in order to help keep it secret; its true purpose was to illuminate enemy positions during a night attack, providing light and dazzling defenders. It was designed to allow light to flood out of a comparatively small slit in the armour, minimising the chance of damage by enemy fire. This was not used on D-Day, but was used during the November 1944 Operation Clipper attack on the Geilenkirchen salient to create indirect artificial daylight. The Americans tested the CDL at the secret Camp Bouse in Bouse, Arizona.

The 79th also used the LVT &quot;Buffalo&quot;, the British name for the American LVT2 and LVT4 lightly armoured amphibious landing vehicles. The latter had a ramp to ease loading of cargo. They were used in several operations, including the crossing of the Rhine.

== Gallery ==
Many of the prototypes and their auxiliary equipment were developed by AEC.

== Post–Second World War use ==
The Centaur bulldozer continued to be used by the British Army for some years after the Second World War and saw action during the Korean War, as did the Churchill Crocodile. Also, small numbers of Churchill AVREs and Sherman BARVs were used until the 1960s, when they were replaced with similar vehicles based on the Centurion Tank. The Royal Engineers subsequently used modified Centurion and Chieftain tanks that are designed to fulfill the same roles in battle as the Funnies. The last examples of FV4003 Centurion Mk 5 AVRE 165 saw combat in the Gulf War/Operation Granby of 1991. The most recent vehicles in this line are the Titan and Trojan variants of the Challenger 2 tank.

Other nations developed their own armoured bulldozers after the war, such as the Soviet IMR variant of the T-72 tank, the US army&#x27;s Rome plow, and the Israeli Armored CAT D9. Armoured bulldozers are still in use today for counter-insurgency by the Israel Defense Forces, the Egyptian army, and the Lebanese army.

== Surviving vehicles ==
This is an incomplete list:

*Churchill ARK: A Churchill ARK is in South Africa, owned by the School of Engineering, Kroonstad. There is another at the Royal Engineers museum in Chatham.

*Churchill AVRE: The collection at The Tank Museum, Bovington includes a working Mark III Churchill AVRE. Another example is located in a hamlet of Graye-sur-Mer in Normandy; it is unusual in having been buried on D-Day in the shell-hole it fell into and then being recovered later as a memorial. MkIV AVREs are at the Imperial War Museum Duxford, the South African Armour Museum, and the National Museum of Military History, Johannesburg. A MkVII AVRE is a Gate guardian at the Allenby Barracks, at the Bovington army camp, headquarters of the Royal Wessex Yeomanry; another is at the Royal Engineers museum at Chatham, Medway. Several more AVREs still exist as wrecks on gunnery ranges.
*Churchill Crocodile: There is one example, without trailer, on display at the Bayeux Museum of the Battle of Normandy. A complete vehicle with trailer is held at Bovington. Mark VII Crocodiles are owned by the Muckleburgh Collection in Norfolk, the Cobbaton Combat Collection in Devon, the D-Day Story, the Wheatcroft Collection, the Kubinka Tank Museum in Russia, and the Museum of the Regiments, Calgary, Alberta. A Mark VIII is at the Royal Australian Armoured Corps Museum. Two (one in running order) are privately owned in the UK. One example at Fort Montbarey near Brest, France, where they were used in September 1944. Another example is displayed outside The D-Day Story museum in Southsea.
*Sherman DD: Five Sherman DDs are in museums; one is nearly intact, and four were sunken wrecks that were salvaged. See the main article for details.
*DD Valentine: One, restored to running condition, is in private ownership in Wolverhampton, England.
*Sherman Crab: Sherman Crabs are displayed at the CFB Borden Military Museum, Ontario, Canada; The Tank Museum, Bovington; the Yad La-Shiryon museum in Latrun; and the Overloon War Museum in the Netherlands. The Sherman serving as a war memorial on the sea dyke at Westkapelle, Netherlands, was a Crab but had its mine flail equipment removed after the war.
*Centaur Dozer: One is part of the collection at Bovington. Another is part of a private collection in the UK.
*Canal Defence Light: The Tank Museum, Bovington has a Matilda tank fitted with a Canal Defence Light turret. A CDL-equipped M3 Grant is displayed at Cavalry Tank Museum, Ahmednagar in India.
*Buffalo aka Amtrac LVT4: The Tank Museum, Bovington has an example.

<text>Holy Molar is a noise rock band from San Diego, composed of vocalist Mark McCoy (under the stage name &quot;Mark McMolar&quot;), guitarist Gabe Serbian, bassist Justin Pearson, drummer Maxamillion Avila and keyboardist Bobby Bray.

== History ==
Holy Molar formed in San Diego in 2001. The band consisted of vocalist Mark McCoy (of Charles Bronson, Virgin Mega Whore, and Das Oath), Bobby Bray, Justin Pearson, and Gabe Serbian (all of The Locust) and Maxamillion Avila (of Antioch Arrow, Heroin, and Final Conflict). The band dressed in white lab coats, medical masks, and sometimes appeared spattered with blood.

The band released a live album in 2001, titled &quot;Live at the Metropolitan Correctional Center&quot;. In 2003, the band released their first album &quot;The Whole Tooth and Nothing but the Tooth.&quot; They issued a split with Ex Models in 2004 and an EP, &quot;Cavity Search&quot;, in 2007.

Holy Molar never officially disbanded; a post from their record label, Three One G, stated that &quot;you never know, perhaps one day it will emerge from the depths, bringing with it its trademark bursts of shrieks and screams, much like a cavity left unattended or a bad root canal.&quot;

<text>The Porsche 917 is a sports prototype race car developed by German manufacturer Porsche to exploit the regulations regarding the construction of 5-litre sports cars. Powered by a Type 912 flat-12 engine which was progressively enlarged from 4.5 to 5.0 litres, the 917 was introduced in 1969 and initially proved unwieldy on the race track but continuous development improved the handling and it went on to dominate sports-car racing in 1970 and 1971.

In 1970 it gave Porsche its first overall win at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, a feat it would repeat in 1971. It would be chiefly responsible for Porsche winning the International Championship for Makes in 1970 and 1971. Porsche went on to develop the 917 for Can-Am racing, culminating in the twin-turbocharged 917/30 which was even more dominant in the role. Porsche drivers would win the Can-Am championship in 1972 and 1973. 917 drivers also won the Interserie championship every year from 1969 to 1975.

==Origins of the 917==

In an effort to reduce the speeds at Le Mans and other fast circuits of the unlimited capacity Group 6 prototypes (such as the seven-litre Ford GT40 Mk.IV and four-litre V12 Ferrari P) the Commission Sportive Internationale (then the independent competition arm of the FIA) announced that the International Championship of Makes would be run for three-litre Group 6 prototypes for four years from 1968 through 1971. This capacity reduction would also serve to entice manufacturers who were already building three-litre Formula One engines to adapt them for endurance racing.

Well aware that few manufacturers were ready to take up the challenge immediately, the CSI also allowed the participation of five-litre Group 4 sports cars, of which a minimum of 50 units had to be manufactured. This targeted existing cars like the aging Ford GT40 Mk.I and the newer Lola T70 coupé.

In April 1968, facing few entrants in races, the CSI announced that the minimum production figure to compete in the sport category of the International Championship of Makes (later the World Sportscar Championship) was reduced from 50 to 25, starting in 1969 through the planned end of the rules in 1971. With Ferrari absent in 1968, mainly Porsche 908s and Ford P68s were entered there, with the Ford being a total failure. As a result, old 2.2-litre Porsche 907s often won that category, with John Wyer&#x27;s 4.7-litre Ford GT40 Mk.I taking wins at faster tracks.

Starting in July 1968, Porsche made a surprising and expensive effort to take advantage of this rule. As they were rebuilding race cars with new chassis every race or two anyway, selling the used cars to customers, they decided to conceive, design and build 25 versions of a whole new car with 4.5-litre for the sport category with one underlying goal: to win its first overall victory in the 24 Hours of Le Mans on June 14, 1970. In only ten months the Porsche 917 was developed, based on the Porsche 908.

When Porsche was first visited by the CSI inspectors only three cars were completed, while 18 were being assembled and seven additional sets of parts were present. Porsche argued that if they assembled the cars they would then have to take them apart again to prepare the cars for racing. The inspectors refused the homologation and asked to see 25 assembled and working cars.

On March 12, 1969, a 917 was displayed at the Geneva Motor Show, painted white with a green nose and a black No. 917. Brief literature on the car detailed a cash price of DM 140,000, approximately £16,000 at period exchange rates, or the price of about ten Porsche 911s. This price did not cover the costs of development.

On April 20 Porsche&#x27;s head of motorsports Ferdinand Piëch displayed 25 917s parked in front of the Porsche factory to the CSI inspectors. Piëch even offered the opportunity to drive any of the cars, which was declined.

==Construction==
The car&#x27;s chassis was designed by Helmuth Bott and the engine was designed by Hans Mezger, both under the leadership of Ferdinand Piëch. The car was built around a very light spaceframe chassis () which was permanently pressurised with gas to detect cracks in the welded structure. Power came from a new 4.5-litre air-cooled engine designed by Mezger. A completely new flat-12 block was designed without the cylinder offset needed by a boxer design to keep the engine compact. The &#x27;Type 912&#x27; engine featured a 180° flat-12 cylinder layout with six crank throws (each conrod journal shared by opposing piston pair) as opposed to twelve on a boxer, twin overhead camshafts gear-driven from centrally mounted gears and twin spark plugs fed from two distributors. The large horizontally mounted cooling fan was also driven from centrally mounted gears. The longitudinally mounted type 920 gearbox was designed to take a set of four or five gears.

To keep the car compact despite the large engine, the driving position was so far forward that the feet of the driver were beyond the front wheel axle. The car had remarkable technology. It used many components made of titanium, magnesium and exotic alloys that had been developed for lightweight &quot;Bergspyder&quot; hill climb racers. Other methods of weight reduction were rather simple, such as making the gear shift knob out of birch wood, some methods were not simple, such as using the tubular frame itself as oil piping to the front oil cooler (a design used successfully by Lotus beginning with Lotus 22 of 1962).

There are at least eleven variants of the 917. The original version had a removable long tail/medium tail with active rear wing flaps, but had considerable handling problems at high speed because of significant rear lift. The handling problems were investigated at a joint test at the Österreichring by the factory engineers and their new race team partners JW Automotive. After exhaustive experimentation by both groups, a shorter, more upswept tail was found to give the car more aerodynamic stability at speed. The changes were quickly adopted into the 917K for &quot;Kurzheck&quot;, or &quot;short-tail&quot;.

In 1971, a variant of the 917K appeared with a less upswept tail and vertical fins, and featured the concave rear deck that had proved so effective on the 1970 version of the 917L. The fins kept the clean downforce-inducing air on the top of the tail and allowed the angle of the deck to be reduced, reducing the drag in direct proportion. The result was a more attractive looking car that maintained down force for less drag and higher top speed.

By this time the original 4.5-litre engine, which had produced around 520 bhp in 1969, had been enlarged through 4.9-litres (600 bhp) to 5-litres and produced a maximum of 630 bhp. 
The 917K models were generally used for the shorter road courses such as Sebring, Brands Hatch, Monza and Spa-Francorchamps. The big prize for Porsche however, was Le Mans. For the French circuit&#x27;s long, high speed straights, the factory developed special long tail bodywork that was designed for minimum drag and thus highest maximum speed. On the car&#x27;s debut in 1969, the 917L proved to be nearly uncontrollable as there was so little down force. In fact, they generated aerodynamic lift at the highest speeds. For 1970, an improved version was raced by the factory and for 1971, after very significant development in the wind tunnel, the definitive 917L was raced by both factory and JW.

In 1969 Jo Siffert raced an open-top 917PA Spyder (normally aspirated) in the 1969 CanAm series. There is also the &quot;Pink Pig&quot; aerodynamic research version (917/20), and the turbocharged 917/10 and 917/30 CanAm Spyders. Porsche 917s also raced in the European Interseries in various configurations. In the 1973 Can-Am series, the turbocharged version Porsche 917/30 developed .

===Variants===
There were a number of versions of Porsche 917 made over the years; at least eleven different versions have existed.

1969 917: 

The original Porsche 917 was first run at the Le Mans Test in March 1969 and right from the start showed considerable handling problems due to aerodynamic lift. The original specification of the car included a detachable long-tail (Langheck), that was designed using experience from the previous 907 long-tail coupés for minimum aerodynamic drag, with suspension controlled moving flaps on the tail. At Le Mans the CSI baulked at this, moving aerodynamic aids having been banned in motorsport. It was only when Rolf Stommelen demonstrated how undriveable the car was without the moving flaps that they relented and allowed them for Le Mans only. Throughout 1969 the car&#x27;s speed was countered by the handling problems and it won only one race, the Zeltweg 1000 km. Following that event, JW Automotive, who would be acting as a semi-works team in 1970, requested a test session with Porsche to try and sort out the car&#x27;s problems.

1969 917PA: 

The 917PA was an open-topped and short-tailed version of the original 917 and was built to compete in Can-Am racing. Only two cars were built by Porsche. The first never raced, and later became a test mule for an experimental flat-16 engine. The second car was entered in the 1969 Can-Am season by Porsche Audi, the North American distributors for Porsche (hence the PA designation), and driven by Jo Siffert. Compared to the dominant McLarens, the car was underpowered and overweight. Siffert&#x27;s best result was 3rd at Bridgehampton, and he finished 4th in the championship. For 1971 the car was obtained by Vasek Polak who ran it for the next three years with the car gaining ever more aerodynamic aids, until by 1973 it resembled the 917/10 variant.

The design of the 917PA&#x27;s gently upswept tail was one of the contributors to the search for better handling of the 917 coupés, resulting in the 917K variant.

1970 917K: 

The 917K was an evolution of the original 1969 car. After the first 917s were run in 1969, it was clear the car&#x27;s aerodynamics made it nearly undriveable at higher speeds. After the 1969 championship season had finished, John Wyer requested a 3-day test session at the Austrian Österreichring course. The Porsche technical team turned out ready to do some serious panel work on the coupé and in order to make a comparison, brought along the Can-Am 917PA Spyder. The drivers present instantly preferred the PA and together, the JW Automotive and Porsche engineers came up with the idea of a more upswept tail (as on the 917PA). The JW team had had similar high speed handling problems with the early Ford GT40 models. With gaffer tape and aluminium sheet, a completely new short tail was evolved at the racetrack. This was quickly converted into a &#x27;production&#x27; design back at Porsche and the 917K (Kurzheck) made its public debut at the season opening 1970 24 Hours of Daytona. Such was the improvement in the stability of the car at high speed, the 917K became the standard configuration for all races except Le Mans, the Nürburgring 1000 km and the Targa Florio. This car was raced at every event by JW Automotive and Porsche Salzburg in the 1970 season except the Targa Florio and the Nürburgring 1000 km. The smaller, more nimble and generally better suited 908/03s were used for those races, but privateers used the 917K at the Nürburgring 1000 km, and Vic Elford drove a lap of the 44-mile Targa Florio course in the 917K at Ferdinand Piëch&#x27;s request. The 917K won 7 out of 10 races; all the races it competed in. Later on in the 1970 season, the 4.5 litre flat-12 was bored out to 4.9 litres, then 5 litres.

1970 917L: 
This long tail, low drag version of the 1969 917L was purpose-built for the 1970 24 Hours of Le Mans. Le Mans in 1970 was almost entirely made up of long straights and this version was designed to maximise the speed capability resulting from the increased power developed by the flat-12 engine over the previous Porsche types. The 1970 917L was largely based on the initial 1969 car. Nevertheless, factory driver Vic Elford had found the car&#x27;s ultimate speed an advantage enough over its still questionable handling in the braking and cornering sections of Le Mans. It was 25 mph faster down the straights than the 917K and the Ferrari 512Ss. Two were entered in the 1970 Le Mans race, one by Porsche Salzburg and the other by Martini Racing. The Porsche Salzburg 917L was qualified in pole position by Elford, but retired with engine failure after 18 hours and the Martini 917L finished 2nd, five laps behind the winning Salzburg 917K of Hans Herrmann and Richard Attwood.

1971 917 16 Cylinder: 

In an effort to keep up with other more powerful cars in the Can-Am championship, a 6.6 litre, 750PS (551 kW, 739 bhp) flat-16 engined prototype was developed. It was tested in the original 917PA chassis, with the wheelbase extended by 270mm to take the longer engine. Although more powerful than the flat-12, it was also 80 kg heavier. Porsche decided that turbocharging the flat-12 would be more profitable, and the flat-16 was shelved.

1971 917K: 

The 917K was further developed for the 1971 season, and the car had vertical fins and two airboxes on the tail section for better aerodynamics and cooling. The fins retained the airflow over the rear part of the bodywork, allowing the deck height to be reduced for a given level of downforce. As a result, the &#x27;finned&#x27; 1971 917Ks were faster than the 1970 versions and proved just as successful, winning seven of the eleven WSC races. A version of this model with a lightweight magnesium chassis won the 1971 24 Hours of Le Mans.

1971 917LH: 

The 1971 model was a further development of the 1970 917L and was also made specifically to compete in only one race: the 1971 24 Hours of Le Mans. The car was also more stable than its 1970 predecessor because of a revised suspension set up and new bodywork with partially enclosed rear wheel covers and a redesigned front section. Two were run by JW Automotive and one by the Martini International team. Although Jackie Oliver qualified one of the JW 917LHs on pole position, none of the three cars finished the race.

1971 917 Interserie Spyder: 
Three Porsche 917 Spyders were built for use in the German Interserie championship, rebuilt from 917s that had been crashed or otherwise written off. These cars were very successful, winning the 1971 Interserie championship.

1971 917/10: 

The 917/10 was built for Can-Am racing, with a 5 litre engine, new bodywork and weight pared to a minimum. It was run in the latter part of the 1971 Can-Am season by Jo Siffert, with moderately successful results.

1971 917/20: 

The 917/20 was a one-off experimental R&amp;D car. It was made as an intermediate car to combine the low drag of the &quot;Langheck&quot; and the stability of the &quot;Kurz&quot;, and was also a test-bed for future Can-Am parts and aerodynamic low-drag concepts. It was only raced once, at the 1971 24 Hours of Le Mans where it was entered by the Martini International team and driven by Reinhold Joest and Willi Kauhsen. Known as the &quot;Pink Pig&quot; for its broad proportions, it was given a pink livery with names of meat cuts running over the bodywork. Although it qualified seventh and ran as high as third, it retired from the race after an accident caused by brake failure at Arnage while Joest was driving.

1972 917/10: 

The revised 917/10 was Porsche&#x27;s first full-scale attempt at Can-Am for 1972. This car ran the 5.0 litre flat-12 and was modified to accommodate additional compression; two turbochargers were added to give the car tremendous horsepower. George Follmer won the championship in the Roger Penske car.

1973 917/30:

The 917/30, the final official iteration of the 917, is one of the most powerful sports racing cars to have ever existed. The car had all new bodywork, and the twin turbocharged engine was bored out to 5.4 litres giving it 1100–1580 horsepower, depending on the state of tune. These cars dominated Can-Am racing to such an extent that the series lost popularity in the United States. A total of six chassis were built.

==Racing history==

===1969-1971 World Sportscar Championship===

====1969====
In testing, it soon appeared that the Porsche 917 did not work well on the race track. Porsche factory driver Brian Redman recalled that &quot;it was incredibly unstable, using all the road at speed.&quot; Many thought that the 4.5-litre engine was too much for the frame. The suspension and the stability of the frame were suspected, but modifications did not improve the problem. It was finally determined that the &quot;long tail&quot; body was generating significant lift on the straights, as the 917 was faster than anything previously built for Le Mans . As with former under-powered Porsches, the 917 aerodynamics had been optimized for low drag in order to do well on the fast straights of Le Mans, Spa, Monza and elsewhere. The significance of downforce for racing was not yet fully realised although Can-Am and F1 cars were using wings by that time.

Before its competition debut on 11 May 1969 in the 1000km Spa, the weather conditions prevented further improvements in tests. The Jo Siffert/Brian Redman car managed to clock an unofficial lap time of 3:41.9 which would have beaten the pole of 3:42.5 set by a Lola, but they chose to use the 908LH long tail with which they won the race and set the fastest lap at 3:37.1. Gerhard Mitter/Udo Schütz actually started the race from 8th, but their already ailing engine failed after one lap.

Three weeks later for the 1000km Nürburgring, all works drivers preferred the 908 over the 917 which was, despite some modifications, not suited for the twisty track. As it was necessary to promote the car in order to sell the surplus ones, Porsche asked BMW for the services of their factory drivers Hubert Hahne and Dieter Quester. They practised, but Munich declined permission to have them race, so Englishman David Piper and Australian Frank Gardner were hired on short terms. They drove the 917 to an eighth-place finish behind a Ford and an Alfa, while the factory&#x27;s armada of six 908/02 spyders scored a 1-2-3-4-5 win after the only serious competition, a sole Ferrari 312P, failed.

At the 1969 24 Hours of Le Mans, the 917s were quickest in practice. Soon after the start the poor handling of the 917 and the inexperience of one of the drivers resulted in drama: British gentleman-driver John Woolfe crashed his Porsche 917 at Maison Blanche on lap 1, dying as a result. Woolfe was the first privateer to race a 917. The works #14 917 led early, but succumbed to an oil leak, while the #12 dropped out of the lead and the race in the 21st hour with a broken gearbox, despite leading by nearly 50 miles. At the end, Hans Herrmann&#x27;s 908 remained as the only Porsche that could challenge for the win, but Jacky Ickx&#x27;s more powerful Ford won once again, by a mere .

In June 1969, Enzo Ferrari sold half of his stock to FIAT, and used some of that money to build 25 cars powered by a 5-litre V12 in order to compete with the Porsche 917: the Ferrari 512 would be introduced for the 1970 season.

At that time, the 917 already had several races under its belt, yet no success. The first win came in the last race of the championship season, the 1000 km Zeltweg. Jo Siffert and Kurt Ahrens succeeded in the privately entered Porsche 917 of German Freiherr von Wendt. At that time, the factory had started to focus on development, leaving the time-consuming trips to races to customer teams.

====1970====

Disappointed by the poor results of the 917 in 1969, and facing new competition, Porsche concluded an agreement with John Wyer and his JWA Gulf Team, which became the official Porsche team, and also the official development partner. During tests at the Österreichring at Zeltweg, works drivers Redman and Ahrens tested the car, and the car still performed like it did before. The Österreichring was the circuit where the car had won its only race at that time, Wyer&#x27;s chief engineer John Horsman noticed that the bodywork had a pattern of dead gnats dashed against it, revealing the airflow. The tail was clean—the lack of dead gnats indicated that the air was not flowing over the tail. A modification to the tail was cobbled-up on the spot in the pits with aluminium sheets taped together. This new short tail gave the 917 much needed downforce. The plastic engine intake cover had already been removed. Redman and Ahrens were doing only one lap at a time before, they each did 10 laps and were satisfied with the improved performance. The new version was called 917K (, or &quot;short tail&quot;).

In addition to the heavier and powerful 917, the lightweight and compact Porsche 908/3 were developed for the slow and twisty tracks of the Nürburgring and the Sicilian mountain roads used in the Targa Florio, providing wins while the factory-backed 917 remained in the garages, as these cars were not suitable for these tracks. The 908/3 was built to the FIA&#x27;s 3-litre Group 6 Prototype regulations whereas the 917 was now officially a Group 5 Sports Car following another FIA review of its racing classes, applicable from 1970.
Wyer was surprised to discover that another team was carefully preparing for the 1970 24 Hours of Le Mans with close support from Porsche. As in 1969, the Porsche Salzburg team was a &quot;de facto&quot; works team under control of members of the Porsche family. The Martini Racing team also gained support from Porsche AG; obviously Porsche made efforts to win the race by supporting more than one team.

Also, a new low drag version of the 917 was developed for Le Mans with support from the external consultant Robert Choulet. The 917LH (Langheck) featured a spectacular new long tail body which had very low drag, yet more rear downforce than the 1969 long tail. A 4.9-litre engine, introduced at 1000km Monza, was available but these proved to be unreliable for longer distance races.

The 917 did not compete at all the races of the season, however. Porsche&#x27;s previous competition model, the 908, was redesigned with an all-new chassis and designated 908/03 so it would be used at the Targa Florio and Nurburgring 1000 km events- two twisty, narrow and slow tracks the 917 was not competitive at. Vic Elford drove a 917 during practice for the 1970 Targa Florio and it proved to be so physically demanding and difficult to drive around the circuit that he had to be lifted out of the car, although he set the 5th fastest time. The 908/03 was very effective at these two races. Porsche&#x27;s dedication was such that they were building cars for each type of track- the 908/03 for the slow, twisty tracks, the 917K for the medium and high-speed tracks, and the 917L for the fast straights of Le Mans.

The favourite team to win, Gulf-backed JW Automotive, lined up three 917Ks, two with the 4.9-litre engine and one with the 4.5-litre unit.

Two 917 LH were entered in Le Mans, one in white and red trim by Porsche Salzburg. Driven by Vic Elford and Kurt Ahrens, the pole sitter&#x27;s 4.9-litre engine dropped an inlet valve after 225 laps. Both drivers had also been entered on the team&#x27;s other car, a red and white 917 K with the 4.5-litre engine, qualified by Hans Herrmann and Richard Attwood in rather low 15th spot, but they did not drive after their own car failed.

The other LH was entered by Martini Racing, qualified by Willi Kauhsen and Gérard Larrousse on 12th position. The spectacular livery of this car was elaborate whirls and swoops of light green on a dark blue background. The car with the 4.5L engine gained the nickname of the &quot;Hippie Car&quot; or the &quot;Psychedelic Porsche&quot; from the team and media.

Early in the race, most of the works Ferrari 512 entrants eliminated each other in a shunt. The two Porsche factory teams, Gulf-Wyer and Porsche Salzburg, continued to battle each other, but all Wyer cars were out after 12 hours. At the end it was the red and white #23 917K of Porsche Salzburg, with the standard 4.5-litre engine, carefully driven by Stuttgart&#x27;s own Hans Herrmann and Englishman Richard Attwood through the pouring rain, that finally scored the first overall win at Le Mans, in a wet race that saw only 7 ranked finishers. Martini&#x27;s 917LH came in 2nd. Both cars were later paraded across Stuttgart. In addition to Porsche&#x27;s triumphant 1, 2 victory, a Porsche 908 came in third overall, a Porsche 914-6 came in sixth overall (plus it won the GT class), and a Porsche 911S was seventh. (Two Ferrari 512s took fourth and fifth place overall.)

Towards the end of the 1970 season, Ferrari entered some races with a new version of the 512, the 512M (Modificata). The 512M had a new bodywork built on a similar aerodynamic doctrine as the Porsche 917K. At the end of 1970 the 512M was as fast as the 917s, but still lacked in reliability.

During the 1970 season the FIA announced that Group 5 Sports Cars would be limited to a 3-litre engine capacity maximum for the newly renamed World Championship of Makes in 1972, so the big 917s and 512s would have to retire from the championship at the end 1971. Surprisingly, Ferrari decided to give up any official effort with the 512 in order to prepare for the 1972 season. A new prototype, the 312 PB, was presented and entered by the factory in several races. But many 512s were still raced by private teams, most of them converted to M specification.

By the end of 1970, Porsche had stamped their authority on endurance racing by convincingly dominating the championship that year. Of the 10 races in the championship (plus some other non-championship events), the works teams (JW Automotive and Porsche Salzburg) had won every race except Sebring (which was won by Ferrari) that year with the two models of cars they used, the 917K and the 908/03; with the 917K winning 7 of 8 events it was entered in; and the 908/03 winning at the Targa Florio and the Nürburgring (the 917K was not entered by the works teams at these two events). Still having some of their 25 cars remaining unsold, Ferrari offered them to customers at a bargain price – a move that had hardly been imaginable less than two years previously. For Porsche, the original production series of 25 917s could not satisfy demand. Over 50 chassis were built in total. An underdog for 20 years, Porsche had turned itself into the new leader of sports car racing with the 917.

====1971====

The season began with the JW Automotive team scoring a 1-2 finish at the Buenos Aires 1000km, Jo Siffert and Derek Bell leading Pedro Rodriguez and Jackie Oliver home. At the 24 Hours of Daytona, much was expected of the Roger Penske Ferrari 512M which qualified on pole, almost 1.3 seconds ahead of the fastest 917. However, mechanical problems plagued the Ferrari and it finished third, 14 laps behind winners Rodriguez and Oliver. At the 12 Hours of Sebring it was the turn of the Martini Racing team to triumph, Vic Elford and Gerard Larrousse taking the honours.

The first upset came at the Brands Hatch 1000km. Ferrari and Alfa Romeo had turned their attention to developing cars for the forthcoming 3-litre regulations and the 312 PB and Tipo 33-3 were proving as fast as the 917s. At Brands Hatch, a large grid on the twisting, damp track suited the Italian cars and Porsche finished third behind the Alfa Romeo of Andrea de Adamich and Henri Pescarolo and the Ferrari of Jackie Ickx and Clay Regazzoni. The high-speed circuits at the Monza 1000km and Spa 1000km played to the 917&#x27;s strengths and the JW-Gulf cars finished 1-2 in both races, Pedro Rodriguez and Jackie Oliver being the winners in both events.
Throughout the season Porsche continued to develop the 917, introducing new versions of the short and long-tailed bodywork, and trying out a magnesium chassis, with which they would win the 1971 24 Hours of Le Mans. The most interesting development was the 917/20, built as test-bed for future Can-Am parts and aerodynamic &quot;low-drag&quot; concepts. The 917/20 had done well in the early-season Le Mans Test, but uncomplimentary remarks about its size and shape resulted in it being painted in pink for the 24 hour race, complete with names of cuts of meat written across it in German like a butcher&#x27;s diagram. This earned it the nickname &quot;Der Trüffeljäger von Zuffenhausen&quot; (The Trufflehunter of Zuffenhausen, or just plain &quot;Pink Pig&quot;. It qualified 7th and ran as high as 3rd, but during the night Reinhold Joest, co-driving with Willi Kauhsen, crashed the car at Arnage after its brakes failed.

Also at Le Mans the revised Langhecks, now cured of their earlier vices, all failed to finish, although Pedro Rodriguez set a fastest qualifying lap which, partly due to circuit changes, still stands today. The winning car was the Martini Racing 917K of Helmut Marko and Gijs van Lennep, equipped with a magnesium frame, which set an overall distance record that stood until 2010. All in all, four separate Le Mans track records were broken that year: fastest qualifying lap, fastest in-race lap, highest top speed, and longest distance covered, all set by 917s.

The Targa Florio and Nurburgring 1000km were again missed out by the works teams, although privateer Willi Kauhsen, partnered by Reinhold Joest took 5th place at the Nurburgring. The next race was another high-speed circuit, the Österreichring, where Pedro Rodriguez and Richard Attwood brought the only 917 finisher home in 1st place. The last race of the season, and the last race under the 5-litre capacity regulations, was the Watkins Glen 6 Hours. The Penske Ferrari again beat the 917 to the pole, but again suffered mechanical problems and failed to finish. However, the Alfa Romeo Tipo 33 of Andrea de Adamich and Ronnie Peterson beat the JW Porsches to the flag by a margin of two laps. And with that, the 917&#x27;s World Sportscar career was over. JW Automotive took a car to the non-championship Barcelona 1000km and the 1000 km of Paris, Derek Bell and Gijs van Lennep winning the latter event.

The 917&#x27;s swansong came in 1972, when Wilson Fittipaldi won the last race in the Copa Brasil series in the ex-Zitro Racing 917K.

===1972–1973 Can-Am===
As the new rules for the 3-litre prototypes were not favourable to their existing low-weight, low-power Porsche 908, Porsche decided against developing a new high power engine that could keep up with the F1-based engine designs of the competition — at least in naturally aspirated form. In 1976 they would return to sport-prototype racing with the turbocharged Porsche 936 race cars after the engines were tested in Porsche 911 versions.

After their successes with the 917 mainly in Europe, Porsche instead decided to focus on the North American markets and the Can-Am Challenge. For that series, larger and more powerful engines were needed. Although a 16-cylinder engine with about was tested, a turbocharged 12-cylinder engine with comparable power output was ultimately used. The 917 chassis also had to be lengthened to accept the longer 16-cylinder engine, and drivers complained that this longer chassis did not handle as well.

The turbocharged 917/10K entered by Penske Racing won the 1972 series with George Follmer, after a testing accident sidelined primary driver Mark Donohue. This broke the five-year stranglehold McLaren had on the series. The further evolution of the 917, the 917/30 with revised aerodynamics, a longer wheelbase and an even stronger 5.4 litre engine with around in race trim, won the 1973 edition winning all races but two. Charlie Kemp won the Mosport race, George Follmer won Road Atlanta and Mark Donohue won the rest. Most of the opposition was made of private 917/10K as McLaren, unable to compete against the 917 turbos, had already left the series to concentrate on Formula 1 and the Indy 500.

The 917&#x27;s domination, the oil crisis, and fiery tragedies like Roger Williamson&#x27;s in Zandvoort pushed the SCCA to introduce a maximum fuel consumption rule for 1974. Due to this change, the Penske 917/30 competed in only one race in 1974, and some customers retrofitted their 917/10K with naturally aspirated engines.

The 917/30 was the most powerful sports car racer ever built and raced. The 12 cylinder (90.0 x 70.4 mm) twin-turbocharged engine could produce around at 7,800 rpm in race trim. The 917/30 dominated the Can-Am series during the 1973 season. The 917 was also the only championship winning car in Can Am not to be powered by Chevrolet.

===1981===
In 1981, it appeared that new Le Mans regulations would allow a 917 to race again.
The Kremer Racing team entered a home-built updated 917, the 917 K-81.

The car raced at Le Mans qualifying in the top 10 but retired after seven hours after a collision with a back marker led to a loss of oil and withdrawal.

The final chapter though was to be at Brands Hatch where the car ran in the 6 hours at the end of the season. The car was competitive and ran at or near the front, including a spell in the lead until a suspension failure led to retirement.

==World Sportscar Championship victories==
==Individual production and race history==
In 1969–71 production consisted of 43 naturally aspirated cars (36 K, 5 LH and 2 Spyders) and 16 turbocharged (13 917/10 and 3 917/30), for a total of 59 917s built. The table below summaries the racing history of each chassis. Multiple winners have each win listed, but otherwise only the best result for each chassis is mentioned.

==Other uses==
On 9 August 1975, Porsche and Penske would give the Can-Am car its final send off in style, when they took their 917/30 to Talladega to break the FIA speed record on a closed circuit. With Mark Donohue driving, the average speed reached was . As well as being the last official outing for the 917, it was the last major accomplishment for Donohue before his fatal accident in practice for the Austrian Grand Prix a week later. The record would stand until 1980.

Several 917 coupés as well as 917/10s (powered by turbos or NA engines) were run in Europe&#x27;s Interserie until the mid-1970s.

Many 917 leftover parts, especially chassis, suspension and brake components, would be used to build the Porsche 936 in 1976.

Despite the car&#x27;s impracticality, at least three 917s were road-registered:
*Count Gregorio Rossi di Montelera of the Martini company, bought chassis 030 from Porsche. He raced it once under the Martini Racing Team Flag at the Zeltweg 1000 km World Championship race on 27 June 1971. After the race, it was returned to the factory, where it was modified with basic road equipment (exterior mirrors, turn signals, exhaust system and comfort modifications) and painted silver. None of the European authorities would certify the car for road use and Rossi obtained the Alabama plate 61-27737 to circumvent the problems.
*The second, for Joachim Grossmann, was painted white and given the German registration CW-K 917. The Danish car magazine &quot;Bilen&quot; in a 1977 article details how Grossmann bought the frame and other components in 1975 for 20,000 DM, rebuilt it and then modified it (examples: turn signals, hand brake, Safety glass windows and some modifications to the exhaust system) to satisfy German safety inspectors leading to the registration.
*Claudio Roddaro was able to register another original 917 that was modified for the road, in Monaco in 2016. Chassis number 037 was accepted based upon the precedent of Count Rossi&#x27;s road registered example.

Several high end replicas that use the flat-6 from the 911 have been also be made. One is built in Australia by Kraftwerkz, another in the US by Race-Car Replicas.

In addition, a grass roots &quot;replica,&quot; the Laser 917, which is essentially a rebodied VW Beetle, was featured in the film &quot;Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo&quot;.

The Gulf Oil liveried 917 &#x27;Kurzhecks&#x27; are also prominently featured in the Steve McQueen film &quot;Le Mans&quot; competing against Ferrari&#x27;s 512 Coda Lunga.

Aurora slot cars released some of these Porsche 917s in their AFX line-up, replicated to their original colours and markings. They were widely available in the early to mid-70s and were raced completely stock.

A replica of a 917/10 was used in the 1981 film &quot;The Last Chase&quot;.

<text>Sir Donald Coleman Bailey, OBE (15 September 1901 – 5 May 1985) was an English civil engineer who invented the Bailey bridge. Field Marshal Montgomery is recorded as saying that &quot;without the Bailey bridge, we should not have won the war.&quot;

== Background ==
Bailey attended Rotherham Grammar School and The Leys School in Cambridge. He read for a BEng degree at the University of Sheffield and graduated in 1923.

Bailey was a civil servant in the War Office when he designed his bridge. Another engineer, A. M. Hamilton, successfully demonstrated that the Bailey bridge breached a patent on the Callender-Hamilton bridge, though the Bailey bridge was generally regarded as being superior for temporary use. Because the bridge used a pin joining system similar to that used in the Martel Bridge designed by Lt.-General Sir Giffard Le Quesne Martel, Hamilton also told the commission the Bailey bridge should be called a &#x27;Martel Mk2&#x27;, and Martel was later awarded £500 for infringement on the design of his box girder bridge.

Bailey was knighted in 1946 for his bridge design. By this time he was living quietly in Southbourne in Bournemouth. Dorothy Barnes, one of the girls at the Southbourne Crossroads bank, which he used regularly was surprised to learn that her unassuming customer had been knighted. He died in Bournemouth in 1985. There is, as yet, no blue plaque in Bournemouth to commemorate him. His 1940s home was demolished c 2004 and replaced by flats, although he also had other addresses in Bournemouth, being recorded in 1974 at 14 Viking Close, as Bailey, Sir Donald C. OBE, JP. The house in which Bailey was born, 24 Albany Street, Rotherham is still standing.

During the Second World War, there was a factory making the components for the Bailey bridge in the neighbouring town of Christchurch, where a section of bridge still remains, at a retail park in Barrack Road. The components were shipped to training grounds in Cumbria, where men learned the difficult technique of assembling them in rivers at night, to simulate combat conditions.

Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery wrote in 1947:
==Honours and awards==
*4 January 1943 - Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for Donald Coleman Bailey, Esq., O.B.E., A.M.Inst.C.E., Assistant Superintendent and Chief Designer, Experimental Bridging Establishment, Ministry of Supply.
*1 January 1946 - Knighthood for Donald Coleman Bailey, Esq., O.B.E., A.M.Inst.C.E., Acting Superintendent, Experimental Bridging Establishment, Ministry of Supply.

<text>Svensk Luftrafik (&quot;SLA, SLAB, Svenska Lufttrafikbolaget&quot;) was a Swedish airline based in Stockholm. The company was founded on 7 February 1919, its first flight running on the 7 August 1920. Flight operations of the company were terminated in 1921, 

SLAB operated air-mail services in co-operation with Deutsche Luft-Reederei, a Lufthansa precursor, and operated a regular passenger service Copenhagen–Malmö–Warnemünde. In 1921 the company built the Lindarängen seaplane airport (&quot;Lindarängens flyghamn&quot;) in Stockholm and started regular services to Reval, (later known as Tallinn, capital of Estonia) with a Junkers F.13 and two Savoia S-16 flying boats. The fleet also included 10 LVG C.VI aircraft from the German Luftverkehrsgesellschaft, of which only two remained airworthy after the liquidation of the company.

Lindarängen airport was sold to the City of Stockholm after the dissolution of Svensk Luftrafik in 1923 and remained in operation until 1952.

During the first half of 1920, the later German Nazi-Leader Hermann Göring was employed as a pilot with the company and on February 21, flew Count Eric von Rosen to his estate Rockelstad where Göring met his first wife, the Swedish national Carin von Kantzow.

<doc id="1162080" wikidata="Q3021599" url="?curid=1162080" title="Delia Akeley">
<text>Delia Julia &quot;Mickie&quot; Akeley ( Denning, formerly Reiss, later Howe; December 5, 1869 – May 22, 1970) was an American explorer. She was born in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin, a daughter of Irish immigrants, Patrick and Margaret ( Hanberry) Denning.

==Early life==

Delia Julia Akeley was born in 1869, although over the years, whether due to Delia&#x27;s own misrepresentation or that of others, her birth year has been given as 1875. She ran away from home in her late teens and made her way to Milwaukee, where she married Arthur Reiss, a barber, in 1889. She was just shy of her 20th birthday, but because of the erroneous attribution of her birth date, virtually every published account states that she was 14 when she married Reiss.

==With Carl E. Akeley==
In Milwaukee she met taxidermist, artist and inventor Carl E. Akeley, who was employed at the Milwaukee Public Museum. Akeley biographers Penelope Bodry-Sanders and Jay Kirk suggest that Delia and Akeley had an affair; in any case, Delia and Reiss soon divorced, and in 1902 Delia married Akeley, who by then had become Taxidermist-in-Chief at the Field Columbian Museum in Chicago, later the Field Museum of Natural History.

During his years at the Field, she assisted her husband in the creation of his groundbreaking &quot;Four Seasons of the Virginia Deer&quot; dioramas, and joined him on a 1906-07 collecting expedition to Africa. Akeley later joined the American Museum of Natural History in New York where he continued his taxidermy work and conceived the great Africa Hall. Delia accompanied Akeley on expeditions to collect specimens central to the most important displays in the African sections of both museums. The larger of the mounted African elephants known as the &quot;Fighting Bulls&quot; in the Field Museum&#x27;s main hall was killed by Delia on the 1906 Field Museum expedition, and she also collected one of the members of the elephant group in the African Hall at the American Museum of Natural History on a 1909-11 expedition for that museum.

In Kenya, when hunting the elephants that were to form the most important of all the displays in the African Hall of the American Museum of Natural History, Carl Akeley was attacked by a bull elephant while out hunting with a team of his porters and helpers. They panicked and ran thinking he was done for. But Akeley survived, in no small part because Delia traveled back to his body with two porters who had initially fled in terror. He was seriously injured, but Delia got him to a hospital after a dangerous portage in mountainous country. She also nursed him back from the brink of death on at least one other occasion when he would have succumbed to blackwater fever2

In 1920, after Carl&#x27;s recovery from blackwater fever, the Akeleys returned to New York accompanied by a pet monkey called &quot;J.T. Jr.&quot;, acquired by the Akeleys during their last expeditions in Kenya. Back in New York, Carl Akeley spent his time raising money for the museum, sculpting models for his dioramas, and becoming better acquainted with Mary Lenore Jobe (1878–1966), a former debutante and Bryn Mawr graduate who had become an African explorer and ethnographer. Delia became increasingly occupied with the care and study of J.T. who was an extremely bright and jealous primate.

Both Bodry-Sanders and Kirk suggest that Delia&#x27;s obsession with the monkey, and increasing isolation from the outside world, contributed to the deterioration of the Akeley marriage, and an acrimonious divorce occurred in 1923. 

Carl married his second wife, Mary, in 1924 when he was 60 and she was 46. Both returned to Africa to hunt and study the mountain gorillas. In 1926, Carl contracted what has been described as dysentery but involved aggressive progression and aggressive bleeding from his orifices.

==Later life==
In 1924, after her divorce, Delia continued to travel widely in Africa leading her own expeditions and concentrating more on the ethnography of the more reclusive tribes such as the Forest People pygmies. She was one of the first westerners to explore the desert between Kenya and Ethiopia, and she explored the Tana River in a dugout canoe, entering it from the Indian Ocean. She also lived for several months with the pygmies of the Ituri Forest, Zaire.

On January 4, 1939, she married Warren D. Howe, a businessman, who died in 1951. She was listed in the 1946 edition of &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in America&quot;.

==Death== 
Delia Akeley died in 1970. Although her obituary lists her age at the time of death as 95, she was in fact 100 years old.

==Bibliography==
Her autobiographical works include:
* &quot;Jungle Portraits&quot; 
* &quot;All True!&quot; 
She was one of the first authors to write a non-anthropomorphic but psychologically insightful biography of another primate:
* &quot;J.T. Junior: The Biography of an African Monkey&quot; (Macmillan: 1928) 
Together with Christina Dodwell, Mary Kingsley, Florence Baker, and Alexine Tinne, she was one of the five subjects of a book by Margo McLoone:
* &quot;Women explorers in Africa&quot; (1997).

Delia Akeley is included as a subject in a book on women explorers:
* &quot;Verwegene Frauen Weiblicher Entdeckergeist und die Erforschung der Welt&quot;, written by Lorie Karnath.

<doc id="1162086" wikidata="Q129734" url="?curid=1162086" title="Bečvář (crater)">
<text>Bečvář () is a lunar impact crater that is located near the equator on the far side of the Moon. It lies to the northeast of the crater Necho, within that feature&#x27;s ray system. To the north-northeast is the crater Gregory.

This is a worn, eroded crater system with a few tiny craterlets lying across the floor and rim. A double-crater formation occupies the southwestern rim, with Bečvář Q forming the northwestern member of this pair. The crater Bečvář X is attached to the northern rim.

The crater was named after Czechoslovakian astronomer Antonín Bečvář by the IAU in 1970. The crater was known as &quot;Crater 283&quot; prior to naming.

Bečvář lies at the center of an unnamed, highly subdued, 200-km-diameter crater which was originally discovered during the Apollo 16 mission and reported by Farouk El-Baz. The name &quot;Necho&quot; was proposed for the crater, but the name was eventually adopted for the small, bright-rayed crater along the south margin of the unnamed crater.

== Satellite craters ==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Bečvář.

<text>Beijerinck is a lunar impact crater on the far side of the Moon. It lies to the south of the larger crater Chaplygin, and to the northeast of the huge walled plain Gagarin.

The outer rim of this crater is heavily worn and eroded by subsequent meteor bombardment, particularly along the southern half, with several small and tiny craterlets lying along the rim. The interior floor, in contrast, is relatively level and unmarked by notable impacts. There is a small, angled central peak near the midpoint of the floor.

The crater was named after Dutch botanist Martinus W. Beijerinck by the IAU in 1970. Beijerinck was known as &quot;Crater 298&quot; prior to naming.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Beijerinck.

<text>In a city or town, the old town is its historic or original core. Although the city is usually larger in its present form, many cities have redesignated this part of the city to commemorate its origins.

<text>Bergman is a small lunar impact crater that is located on the far side of the Moon. It was named after Swedish astronomer Torbern O. Bergman. It is located on the interior floor of the walled plain Mendeleev, and is attached to the edge of the inner wall to the northwest. On the same walled basin are the craters Moissan to the south and Richards to the west. The rim of Bergman is roughly circular, and the formation is generally bowl-shaped. The western half of the interior floor is covered with a slope of scree, leaving a small level floor on the eastern side.

<text>Mohammed Arkoun (; 1 February 1928 – 14 September 2010) was an Algerian scholar and thinker. He was considered to have been one of the most influential secular scholars in Islamic studies contributing to contemporary intellectual Islamic reform. In a career of more than 30 years, he had been a critic of the tensions embedded in his field of study, advocating Islamic modernism, secularism, and humanism. During his academic career, he wrote his numerous books mostly in French, and occasionally in English and Arabic.

==Academic career==
Arkoun was born in 1928 in Taourirt Mimoun, a Berber village in Great Kabylia in northern Algeria. His family was traditional, religious and relatively poor. His father was a shopkeeper in Ain al-Arba&#x27;a, a wealthy French settlement in east of Oran. He attended primary school in his Berber-speaking home village until he was nine-years-old. As the eldest son, he was expected to learn his father&#x27;s trade, while continuing to attend primary school. He studied at the Faculty of Literature of the university of Algiers and at the Sorbonne in Paris (agrégé in Arabic language and Literature, 1956 and Ph.D., 1968). He established his academic reputation with his studies of the history and philosophy of Ibn Miskawayh. As he began to consider how one might rethink Islam in the contemporary world, his questioning provided a counterpoint to the predominant interpretations of both the Muslim world and the non-Muslim West. As the editor of &quot;Arabica&quot;, he broadened the journal&#x27;s scope, and played a significant role in shaping Western-language scholarship on Islam. He authored numerous books in French, English, and Arabic, including: &quot;Rethinking Islam&quot; (Boulder, Colorado, 1994), &quot;L&#x27;immigration: défis et richesses&quot; (Paris, 1998) and &quot;The Unthought in Contemporary Islamic Thought&quot; (London, 2002). His shorter studies appeared in many academic journals; his works have been translated into several languages.

He was decorated as a Commander of the French Legion of Honor in 2004, before that a Chevalier and Officer in 1984 and 1996, respectively. In 2001, Arkoun was asked to deliver the Gifford Lectures, which enable a notable scholar to contribute to the advancement of theological and philosophical thought.
Arkoun taught at the Lyon 2 University (1969–1972), as a professor, and at the Paris 8 University, and at the New Sorbonne University of Paris (1972–1992). He was a Fellow at Wissenschaftskolleg in Berlin (1986–1987 and 1990) and at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, U.S.A (1992–1993), visiting professor at University of California, Los Angeles (1969), Princeton University (1985), Temple University, the University of Louvain-la-Neuve, Wallonia, Belgium, (1977–1979), the Pontifical Institute of Arabic Studies in Rome and the University of Amsterdam (1991–1993) and served as a jury member for the Aga Khan Award for Architecture. At the time of his death he was Emeritus Professor at La Sorbonne as well as Senior Research Fellow and member of the Board of Governors of The Institute of Ismaili Studies , At IIS, he has taught various graduate courses including unthought in contemporary Islamic thought, rethinking Islam, contemporary challenges of Muslim world and traditions for almost a decade. He appeared on numerous occasions on French TV and magazines, on Berbère Télévision speaking in Kabyle, his mother tongue, and on Al Jazeera speaking in Arabic.

Arkoun died on the evening of September 14, 2010, in Paris.

==Thought==
Arkoun advocated a radical paradigm shift that would allow for the rethinking of Islam as a cultural and religious system and subvert ideological and dogmatic constructs with hegemonic claims. He was committed to contribute to an archaeology of the hidden, repressed, and marginalised elements of Islam, in order to uncover, and set free, what he called, &#x27;the exhaustive tradition&#x27; of Islam. Most of his work was written in French rather than Arabic. In order to counteract the philological and historical bias of traditional Islamic studies, he advocated what he called “applied Islamology”—following Roger Bastide&#x27;s concept of “applied anthropology.” Applied Islamology aims to establish a “disciplinary space between political and historical sciences” (Arkoun, The answers, 25), taking into consideration elements of the &quot;courte&quot; and &quot;longue durée&quot;, as well as contemporary social factors. Arkoun developed an inclusive approach which seeks to deal with Islamic tradition in its entirety, including elements characterised by the religious leaders as heterodox, and therefore marginalised and repressed. He has adopted a multifaceted and holistic approach which looks between traditional dogma and axioms.

<doc id="1162130" wikidata="Q7824551" url="?curid=1162130" title="Top Girls">
<text>Top Girls is a 1982 play by Caryl Churchill. It centres on Marlene, a career-driven woman who is heavily invested in women&#x27;s success in business. The play examines the roles available to women in old society, and what it means or takes for a woman to succeed. It also dwells heavily on the cost of ambition and the influence of Thatcherite politics on feminism.

&quot;Top Girls&quot; has been included on a variety of &quot;greatest plays&quot; lists by critics and publications.

==Productions==
The play premiered at the Royal Court Theatre in London on 28 August 1982. It was directed by Max Stafford-Clark, the Royal Court&#x27;s artistic director, who has premiered several of Churchill&#x27;s plays. The cast was Selina Cadell, Lindsay Duncan, Deborah Findlay, Carole Hayman, Lesley Manville, Gwen Taylor and Lou Wakefield.

In December 1982, the Public Theater programmed the play&#x27;s American debut, with the Royal Court Theatre cast and creative team. Its run would end in 1983 with a cast of North American actresses: Lise Hilboldt (Marlene), Donna Bullock (Jeanine/Waitress/Win), Sara Botsford (Isabella/Joyce/Nell), Freda Foh Shen (Lady Nijo/Mrs. Kidd), Kathryn Grody (Dull Gret/Angie), Linda Hunt (Pope Joan/Louise), and Valerie Mahaffey (Griselda/Shona/Kit).

In 1991, the BBC and Rádio e Televisão de Portugal commissioned a televised production, reuniting Deborah Findlay (as Isabella/Joyce) and Lesley Manville (as Marlene) under Stafford-Clark&#x27;s direction. The rest of the cast was filled out by Lesley Sharp, Cecily Hobbs, Beth Goddard, Sarah Lam, and Anna Patrick. It first aired in the UK on 2 November 1991 and in the US on 3 November 1992. A radio production with the same cast (directed by Hillary Norrish) aired on the BBC World Service in 1992. These productions coincided with a revival at the Royal Court Theatre and a national tour in the same season.

A production ran at the Watford Palace Theatre November 2–18, 2006 before transferring to the Greenwich Theatre November 21–25, 2006. The cast included Rachel Sanders, Zoe Aldrich, Elaine Claxton, Sara Houghton, Emma Pallant, Claire Redcliffe and Hayley Jayne Standing.

During the 2007–2008 New York theatre season, Manhattan Theatre Club presented the play at the Biltmore Theatre in a production starring Mary Catherine Garrison, Mary Beth Hurt, Jennifer Ikeda, Elizabeth Marvel, Martha Plimpton, Ana Reeder, and Marisa Tomei. The production was directed by frequent Churchill collaborator James Macdonald. The MTC production marked the Broadway premiere of &quot;Top Girls&quot;, though the original Royal Court production had visited New York&#x27;s Public Theater.

A 2011 revival at Chichester Festival Theatre, co-produced with Out of Joint and directed by the play&#x27;s original director Max Stafford-Clark transferred to Trafalgar Studios in the West End, opening on 16 August 2011. The cast included Suranne Jones, Stella Gonet, Olivia Poulet, Lucy Briers, Laura Elphinstone, Lisa Kerr and Catherine McCormack. This production toured in the UK in early 2012, with a new cast including Caroline Catz as Marlene.

In 2019 a production was staged at the Royal National Theatre in London, starring Katherine Kingsley, Amanda Lawrence and Siobhan Redmond, and directed by Lyndsey Turner.

In 2021, a Portuguese version of the play was directed by Cristina Carvalhal and presented in Queen Maria II National Theatre, in Lisbon.

In 2023 the production was staged at the Liverpool Everyman.

== Background ==
&quot;Top Girls&quot; was written in the background of Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s election as Britain&#x27;s first female prime minister and deals with concerns such as Thatcher&#x27;s right-wing politics, a shift in 1980s Britain from a socialist mindset to a more capitalist one, and the feminine politics of the 1980s. The play has an all-female cast playing complex characters, which has been hailed by critics as the most significant feminist intervention in the patriarchal drama mode. In this play Churchill also developed stylistic technique of overlapping dialogues and non-linear storyline.

==Themes==
The play is set in the Britain of the early 1980s and examines the issue of what it means to be a successful woman, initially using &quot;historical&quot; characters to explore different aspects of women&#x27;s &quot;social achievement&quot;. Churchill has stated that the play was inspired by her conversations with American feminists: it comments on the contrast between American feminism, which celebrates individualistic women who acquire power and wealth, and British socialist feminism, which involves collective group gain.

There is also commentary on Margaret Thatcher, then prime minister, who celebrated personal achievement and believed in free-market capitalism (Thatcherism). Marlene, the tough career woman, is portrayed as soulless, exploiting other women and suppressing her own caring side in the cause of success. The play argues against the style of feminism that simply turns women into new patriarchs and argues for a feminism in which caring for the weak and downtrodden is more prominent. The play questions whether it is possible for women in society to combine a successful career with a thriving family life.

==Style==
The play is famous for its dreamlike opening sequence in which Marlene meets famous women from history, including Pope Joan, who, disguised as a man, is said to have been pope between 854 and 856; the explorer Isabella Bird; Dull Gret the harrower of Hell; Lady Nijo, the Japanese mistress of an emperor and later a Buddhist nun; and Patient Griselda, the patient wife from The Clerk&#x27;s Tale in Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;. All of these characters behave like a gang of city career women out on the town and get increasingly drunk and maudlin, as it is revealed that each has suffered in similar ways.

The stories of the historical women parallel the characters in the modern-day story. For example, Bird, like Marlene, got to where she was by leaving her sister to deal with family matters. Dull Gret&#x27;s monosyllabic inarticulacy is comparable to Angie&#x27;s. Some of these parallels are emphasised by the actors doubling the roles of the historical and modern characters.

The structure of the play is unconventional (non-linear). In Act I, scene 1, Marlene is depicted as a successful businesswoman, and all her guests from different ages celebrate her promotion in the &#x27;Top Girls&#x27; employment agency. In the next scene we jump to the present day (early 1980s) where we see Marlene at work in the surprisingly masculine world of the female staff of the agency, in which the ladies of &#x27;Top Girls&#x27; must be tough and insensitive in order to compete with men. In the same act, the audience sees Angie&#x27;s angry, helpless psyche and her loveless relationship with Joyce, whom the girl hates and dreams of killing. Only in the final scene, which takes place a year before the office scenes, does the audience hear that Marlene, not Joyce, is Angie&#x27;s mother. This notion, as well as the political quarrel between the sisters shifts the emphasis of the play and formulates new questions.

== Characters ==

The life stories of the dinner guests externalise Marlene&#x27;s thoughts and anxieties over the choices that she has made in her own life and the alternatives, e.g. whether it was the right choice to give up her child in order to be successful.
===Pope Joan===
Pope Joan is one of Marlene&#x27;s dinner party guests in act 1, scene 1, and the fourth to arrive. Pope Joan is somewhat aloof, making relevant, intellectual declarations throughout the conversation. When the topic turns to religion, she cannot help but point out heresies—herself included—though she does not attempt to convert the others to her religion. Joan reveals some of her life. She began dressing as a boy at age twelve so she could continue to study; she lived the rest of her life as a man, though she had male lovers. Joan was eventually elected pope. She became pregnant by her chamberlain lover and delivered her baby during a papal procession. For this, Joan was stoned to death. At the end of the scene, Joan recites a passage in Latin. Like all the dinner guests, Joan&#x27;s life and attitude reflect something about Marlene; in particular how she had to give up her female body in order to &quot;succeed&quot; in her time.

===Dull Gret===
The subject of the painting &quot;Dulle Griet&quot; by Pieter Breughel, in which a woman wearing an apron and armed with tools of male aggression – armor, helmet, and sword – leads a mob of peasant women into Hell, fighting the devils and filling her basket with gold cups. In the play she eats crudely and steals bottles and plates when no one is looking, putting these in her large apron. Throughout most of the dinner scene, Dull Gret has little to say, making crude remarks such as &quot;bastard&quot; and &quot;big cock&quot;. Her rare speech is coarse, reductive and amusing while her relative silence adds an element of suspense up to the point where she recounts the tale of her invasion.

===Lady Nijo===
Lady Nijo is a thirteenth-century Japanese concubine who enters the play near the beginning of act one and proceeds to tell her tale. As the most materialistic of the women, she is influenced more by the period of time before she became a wandering nun than by the time she spent as a holy woman. It may be suggested that it is her social conditioning that Churchill is condemning, not her character, as she is brought up in such a way that she cannot even recognize her own prostitution. She is instructed by her father to sleep with the emperor of Japan and reflects on it positively; she feels honored to have been chosen to do so when discussing it with Marlene in Act 1. In relation to Marlene, this may suggest that Marlene, like Lady Nijo, has not questioned the role given to her by society and merely played the part despite the consequences; as she does whatever it takes to be successful in an individualistic business environment.

===Patient Griselda===
Patient Griselda is one of Marlene&#x27;s dinner guests in act one. She is the last to arrive, so Marlene and the other characters in the scene order without her. Historically, Griselda first came into prominence when Chaucer adapted her (from earlier texts by Boccaccio) for a story in &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; called &quot;The Clerk&#x27;s Tale.&quot; In Chaucer&#x27;s tale, and also in &quot;Top Girls&quot;, Griselda is chosen to be the wife of the Marquis, even though she is only a poor peasant girl. The one condition that he gives her is that she must promise to always obey him.

After they have been married for several years, Griselda gives birth to a baby girl. When the baby turns six weeks old the Marquis tells Griselda that she has to give it up, so she does. Four years later Griselda gives birth to a son. She has to also give this child up after two years because it angers the other members of the court. Twelve years after she gave up her last child, the Marquis tells her to go home, which she does. The Marquis then comes to Griselda&#x27;s father&#x27;s house and instructs her to start preparing his palace for his wedding. Upon her arrival, she sees a young girl and boy and it is revealed that these are her children. All of this suffering was a trial to test her obedience to the Marquis.

When she recounts her tale at dinner with the other women it appears in an accurate but slightly shortened form. Griselda says that she understands her husband&#x27;s need for complete obedience, but it would have been nicer if he had not done what he did. She spends much of her time defending her husband&#x27;s actions against Lady Nijo&#x27;s accusations concerning his character.

===Isabella Bird===
Isabella Bird is the first dinner guest to arrive at Marlene&#x27;s celebration. In real life, as discussed in the first act, Bird was a world traveler. The play does not mention that she wrote several books, including &quot;An English Woman In America&quot;, &quot;A Lady&#x27;s Life in the Rocky Mountains&quot;, and &quot;Among the Tibetans&quot;. Her adventures took her around the world. At dinner, Bird tells everyone that she was first instructed to travel by a doctor who thought it would improve her poor health. Following this advice, she took her first trip, a sea voyage to America at age 23. For a long time, she lived with her mother and her younger sister, Henrietta Bird, whom she talks about with great affection during the dinner party. She also mentions Jim Nugent, a one-eyed mountain man who was her guide in the Rocky Mountains. In life, Nugent was in love with Bird but she ignored his advances. She reasons to her friends during the dinner in Act One: &quot;He is a man any woman might love, but no sane woman would marry.&quot; Nugent would later be found murdered.

Of the dinner guests, Bird seems to have the most in common with Marlene. Bird, like Marlene, did not marry young because of her career, but later married John Bishop, who died two days before their fifth anniversary. She refers to him as &quot;my dear husband the doctor&quot; but, despite her love for her husband, is still disappointed with marriage itself (&quot;I did wish marriage had seemed more of a step&quot;). Bird gets the last words in act 1 and continues to discuss her final travels to Morocco.

==Plot synopsis==

The play opens in a restaurant, where Marlene is waiting for some friends to arrive. She is throwing a dinner party to celebrate her promotion at the employment agency where she works. As the women arrive and start the meal, they begin to talk about their lives and what they did. Each of her guests is a historical, fictional or mythical woman who faced adversity and suffered bitterly to attain her goals. Lady Nijo recalls how she came to meet the ex-Emperor of Japan, and her encounter with him. While the rest of the women understand the encounter as rape, she explains that she saw it as her destiny: the purpose for which she was brought up. Within the context of Pope Joan&#x27;s narrative, the women discuss religion. At this point the waitress, who punctuates the scene with interruptions, has already brought the starter and is preparing to serve the main courses. All the women except Marlene discuss their dead lovers. They also recall the children that they bore and subsequently lost. Nijo&#x27;s baby was of royal blood, so he couldn&#x27;t be seen with her. Pope Joan was stoned to death when it was discovered that she had given birth and was therefore female and committing heresy. Griselda was told that her two children had been killed, in a cruel test of her loyalty to her husband. After dessert, the women sit drinking brandy, unconsciously imitating their male counterparts.

In Act One, Scene Two, Marlene is at the agency where she works, interviewing a girl named Jeanine. Marlene takes a fancy to her even though she seems lost and helpless. She doesn&#x27;t know what type of job she wants—only that she wants to travel and be with her husband.

Act Two, Scene One begins with two girls, Angie and Kit, playing in Angie&#x27;s backyard. Angie is abrasive and argumentative with both her friend and her mother, Joyce. She and Kit fight and Angie says she is going to kill her mother. Kit doesn&#x27;t believe her, and they start to talk about sex. Angie accuses Kit&#x27;s mother of sleeping around, but it becomes apparent that neither of them know what they are talking about; Kit is only 12 and Angie is quite immature for her sixteen years. 
In Act Two, Scene Two, the action turns to the &quot;Top Girls&quot; employment agency, where Nell and Win are sharing the latest office gossip, until Marlene arrives. They then express their congratulations to Marlene for getting the top job. 
Win meets Louise, a client who after conscientiously working for many years at the same firm is deciding to quit. She slowly opens up to Win, describing how she had dedicated her life to her job, working evenings at the expense of her social life, without reward. She has found herself at 46, with no husband or life outside of work, in a position where she trains men who are consistently promoted over her.

The action then switches to Marlene&#x27;s office where Angie arrives, having taken the bus from Joyce&#x27;s house in the country. She is shy and awkward and her presence is clearly an unwelcome surprise to Marlene, who nevertheless offers to let Angie stay at her place overnight. They are interrupted by Mrs. Kidd, the wife of Howard, who was passed up for promotion in favor of Marlene. Mrs. Kidd tells Marlene how much the job means to her husband, how devastated he is, and questions whether she should be doing a &#x27;man&#x27;s job&#x27;. It becomes clear that she is asking Marlene to step down and let her husband have the job instead, which Marlene firmly declines to do. She tries to clear Mrs. Kidd out of her office, but Mrs. Kidd only becomes more insistent until Marlene finally asks her to &quot;please piss off&quot;.

Lights shift to Shona arriving in Nell&#x27;s office looking for job opportunities. At first Nell is impressed by her surprisingly accomplished resume, but quickly figures out that Shona is underaged and making it all up as she goes.

At the same time, Angie is having a conversation with Win about Angie&#x27;s aunt and Win&#x27;s life, but falls asleep in the middle of Win&#x27;s story. Nell comes in with the news that Howard has had a heart attack. Marlene is informed but is unperturbed, and Nell responds &quot;Lucky he didn&#x27;t get the job if that&#x27;s what his health&#x27;s like&quot;.

The final act takes place a year earlier in Joyce&#x27;s kitchen. Marlene, Joyce and Angie share stories with each other. Angie is very happy that her Aunt Marlene is there, since she looks up to her and thinks that she is wonderful. Shortly before Angie goes to bed, Marlene pulls a bottle of whiskey out of her bag to drink with Joyce. As they drink, they discuss what is to become of Angie. With brutal honesty, Joyce tells Marlene that Angie is neither particularly bright nor talented and it is unlikely that she will ever make anything of herself. Marlene tries to brush this off, saying that Joyce is just running Angie down, as this sober reality contradicts Marlene&#x27;s conservative mentality. It is revealed that Angie is actually Marlene&#x27;s daughter, whom she abandoned to Joyce&#x27;s care, causing Joyce to lose the child she was carrying from the stress.

The play ends with Angie calling for her Mum towards Marlene. It is unclear how much Angie heard of Joyce and Marlene&#x27;s argument.

==Legacy==

&quot;Top Girls&quot; was nominated for &#x27;Best Play&#x27; at the 1982 Standard Drama Awards, although it was noted that the play &quot;drew compliments rather than committed votes&quot; from the judging panel.

In his review of the 1983 Royal Court production of the play, &quot;The Guardian&quot; critic Michael Billington stated that he was convinced that &quot;Top Girls&quot; &quot;is the best British play ever from a woman dramatist. That is not meant to be patronising&quot;. He later in 1997 included the play in his list of the &quot;10 best British plays of the [20th] Century&quot;. In 2015 Billington selected the play for his list of the &quot;101 greatest plays&quot; ever written in any western language. In 2016, he also included &quot;Top Girls&quot; in his list of &quot;Ten great Royal Court plays&quot;, where he described the play as the &quot;supreme achievement&quot; of Max Stafford-Clark&#x27;s era as artistic director of The Royal Court.

In 1997 the playwright Mark Ravenhill wrote that &quot;Top Girls&quot; &quot;must be the best play of the past 20 years&quot;.

In 1998 the critic David Benedict named &quot;Top Girls&quot; as his favourite &quot;play of the [20th] century&quot; writing that &quot;Caryl Churchill&#x27;s stunningly moving study of the enticements of power and the contradictions we are forced to face was groundbreaking in its reworking of the basic dramatic rules governing time, manner and place. It was also utterly alive to the world in which she was writing and remains so today.&quot;

The play was voted as one of the 100 most significant plays of the 20th century as part of a poll which was given to over &quot;800 playwrights, actors, directors, theatre professionals and arts journalists&quot; and conducted by the Royal National Theatre as part of their &quot;NT2000&quot; project to celebrate the new millennium.

In 2002, &quot;The Guardian&quot; published an article written by the critic Lyn Gardner about the enduring relevance of &quot;Top Girls&quot; as the play was being revived in the West End 20 years after its initial premiere. In the article Gardner stated that &quot;Top Girls&quot; &quot;can still lay claim to being one of the finest postwar British plays. With its postmodern approach to structure, chronology and, most obviously, language, including dialogue that interrupts and overlaps, it is certainly one of the most influential.&quot; She also wrote that the play&#x27;s opening dinner party scene is &quot;one of the most famous scenes in modern drama&quot;.

&quot;Top Girls&quot; is listed as one of the 100 &quot;best and most influential plays&quot; performed in Britain from 1945 – 2010
in the book and iPad app &quot;Played in Britain: Modern Theatre in 100 Plays&quot;.

In 2012, critic Benedict Nightingale included &quot;Top Girls&quot; in his list of &quot;Great Moments in the Theatre&quot;, writing that many of Churchill&#x27;s plays &quot;seize and startle, asking key questions in dramatically daring ways, but none more than that modern classic, &quot;Top Girls&quot;.&quot;

In 2013, &quot;Top Girls&quot; made Entertainment Weekly&#x27;s list of the &quot;50 Greatest Plays of the Past 100 Years&quot;.

Also in 2013, &quot;Top Girls&quot; was featured in Lucy Kerbel&#x27;s book of &quot;100 Great Plays for Women&quot;. Kerbel had written the book in response to many of her theatre colleagues saying that &quot;There just aren&#x27;t any good plays for women&quot;. Kerbel stated that this phrase was often &quot;delivered like a universal truth: no, with the exception of Caryl Churchill&#x27;s &quot;Top Girls&quot;, no one in the history of playwrighting had managed to deliver a single decent play that had more parts for women than men&quot;.

In 2014, &quot;Top Girls&quot; was ranked by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; as one of the 15 greatest plays ever written.

In 2018, &quot;Top Girls&quot; was included in &quot;The Times&quot;&#x27;s list of &quot;The greatest plays of all time&quot;.

In 2019 Methuen Drama conducted a public poll to decide which of their published plays should be re-issued as part of a special edition boxset that would commemorate 60 years of publishing play-texts in their &quot;Modern Plays&quot; series. The poll consisted of a shortlist of Methuen’s plays for each decade since 1960, with voters being asked to determine which play was &quot;the most representative&quot; of the decade in which it premiered. Out of a shortlist of nine plays from the 1980s &quot;Top Girls&quot; received the most votes. As a result, the play-text of &quot;Top Girls&quot; was re-issued as a limited-edition hardback with a foreword by Ann McFerran.

Aleks Sierz in his review of the 2019 National Theatre revival of the play wrote that &quot;[Caryl Churchill has] a back-catalogue [of plays] which is stuffed full of contemporary classics, and a handful of masterpieces... &quot;Top Girls&quot;, is her masterpiece of masterpieces. Yes, it’s that good. It proves, if proof were needed, that she is clearly the best living British playwright.&quot;

<text>Peter Wardell Hogg (12 March 1939 – 4 February 2020) was a New Zealand-born Canadian legal scholar and lawyer. He was best known as a leading authority on Canadian constitutional law, with the most academic citations in Supreme Court jurisprudence of any living scholar during his lifetime, according to Emmett Macfarlane of the University of Waterloo.

==Early life and education==
Born in Lower Hutt, New Zealand, on 12 March 1939, Hogg attended Nelson College from 1952 to 1956. He earned his LLB from Victoria University College, a constituent college of the University of New Zealand, in 1962, his LLM from Harvard University in 1963, and his PhD from Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, in 1970.

==Career==
In 1970, he was appointed Professor of Law at Osgoode Hall Law School in Toronto and was appointed Dean in 1998. In 2003 he accepted a position as scholar in residence at the law firm of Blake, Cassels &amp; Graydon LLP.

Hogg wrote several books, including &quot;Constitutional Law of Canada&quot;, the single most-cited book in decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada. In 2004, he was lead counsel for the Canadian government in the Supreme Court&#x27;s same-sex marriage reference. Hogg also advised the committee that studied Marshall Rothstein&#x27;s nomination to the Supreme Court, saying the creation of the committee was important to Canada&#x27;s legal history and informing it that it should not ask political questions about abortion and same-sex marriage.

Hogg supported judicial restraint in cases dealing with disputes over Canadian federalism.

Hogg was the academic supervisor of Randal Graham during Graham&#x27;s PhD studies at Osgoode Hall Law School.

<doc id="1162139" wikidata="Q3518444" url="?curid=1162139" title="Girish Karnad">
<text>Girish Karnad (19 May 1938 – 10 June 2019) was an Indian actor, film director, Kannada writer, playwright and a Jnanpith awardee, who predominantly worked in Kannada, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Marathi films. His rise as a playwright in the 1960s marked the coming of age of modern Indian playwriting in Kannada, just as Badal Sarkar did in Bengali, Vijay Tendulkar in Marathi, and Mohan Rakesh in Hindi. He was a recipient of the 1998 Jnanpith Award, the highest literary honour conferred in India.

For four decades Karnad composed plays, often using history and mythology to tackle contemporary issues. He translated his plays into English and received acclaim. His plays have been translated into some Indian languages and directed by directors like Ebrahim Alkazi, B. V. Karanth, Alyque Padamsee, Prasanna, Arvind Gaur, Satyadev Dubey, Vijaya Mehta, Shyamanand Jalan, Amal Allanaa and Zafer Mohiuddin.

He was active in the world of Indian cinema working as an actor, director and screenwriter, in Hindi and Kannada cinema, and has earned awards.

He was conferred Padma Shri and Padma Bhushan by the Government of India and won four Filmfare Awards, of which three are Filmfare Award for Best Director – Kannada and the fourth a Filmfare Best Screenplay Award. He was a presenter for a weekly science magazine programme called &quot;Turning Point&quot; that aired on Doordarshan in 1991.

==Early life and education==
Girish Karnad was born in a Konkani-speaking Chitrapur Saraswat Brahmin family of Matheran, in present-day Maharashtra, in 1938. His mother Krishnabai (née Mankikar) was a young widow with a son who belonged to a poor family. Since it was necessary for her to earn a living, she began working as a nurse and cook (general housekeeper) for the bedridden wife of a certain Raghunath Karnad, a doctor in the Bombay Medical Services.

Some five years later, and while the first wife was still alive, Krishnabai and Raghunath Karnad were married in a private ceremony. The marriage was controversial not because of bigamy (it was legal until 1956 for a Hindu man to have more than one wife) but because of the prevailing social prejudice against widow remarriage. Therefore, the wedding was held privately, and under the dispensation of the Arya Samaj, a reform organization that condones widow remarriage. Girish was the third of the four children born thereafter.

Karnad&#x27;s initial schooling was in Marathi. Later, after his father was transferred to Sirsi in the Kannada-speaking regions of Bombay Presidency, Karnad was exposed to travelling theatre groups and &quot;nataka mandalis&quot; (theatre troupes), which were experiencing a period of efflorescence during the iconic Balgandharva era . As a youngster, he was an ardent admirer of Yakshagana and the theater in his village. His family moved to Dharwad in Karnataka when he was fourteen, where he grew up with his two sisters and a niece.

After completing his schooling at the Basel Mission Boys School, Dharwad, he earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics and statistics from Karnataka Arts College, Dharwad (Karnataka University), in 1958. After graduation, he went to England and studied philosophy, Politics and Economics at Magdalen in Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar (1960–63), earning his Master of Arts degree in philosophy, political science and economics. Karnad was elected the President of the Oxford Union in 1962–63.

==Career==
After working with the Oxford University Press, Chennai for seven years (1963–70), he resigned to take to writing full-time. While in Madras (now known as Chennai) he got involved with local amateur theatre group, The Madras Players.

During 1987–88, he was at the University of Chicago as visiting professor and Fulbright playwright-in-residence. During his tenure at Chicago &quot;Nagamandala&quot; had its world premiere at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis based on Karnad&#x27;s English translation of the Kannada original.

He served as director of the Film and Television Institute of India (1974–1975) and chairman of the Sangeet Natak Akademi, the national academy of the performing arts (1988–93). He served as director of the Nehru Centre and as Minister of Culture, in the Indian High Commission, London (2000–2003).

===Literature===

Karnad is known as a playwright. His plays, written in Kannada, have been translated into English (mostly translated by himself) and some Indian languages. Kannada is his language of choice.

When Karnad started writing plays, Kannada literature was highly influenced by the renaissance in Western literature. Writers would choose a subject that looked entirely alien to manifestation of native soil. C. Rajagopalachari&#x27;s version of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; published in 1951, left a deep impact on him and soon, sometime in the mid-1950s, one day he experienced a rush of dialogues by characters from the Mahabharata in Kannada.

&quot;I could actually hear the dialogues being spoken into my ears ... I was just the scribe,&quot; said Karnad in a later interview. &quot;Yayati&quot; was published in 1961, when he was 23 years old. It is based on the story of King Yayati, one of the ancestors of the Pandavas, who was cursed into premature old age by his preceptor, Shukracharya, who was incensed at Yayati&#x27;s infidelity.

Yayati, in turn, asks his sons to sacrifice their youth for him, and one of them agrees. It ridicules the ironies of life through characters in &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. The play in Hindi was adapted by Satyadev Dubey and Amrish Puri was lead actor for the play. It became an instant success, immediately translated and staged in several other Indian languages.

Karnad found a new approach of drawing historical and mythological sources to tackle contemporary themes and existentialist crisis of modern man through characters locked in psychological and philosophical conflicts. His next was &quot;Tughlaq&quot; (1964), about a rashly idealist 14th-century Sultan of Delhi, Muhammad bin Tughluq, and allegory on the Nehruvian era which started with ambitious idealism and ended up in disillusionment. This established Karnad, now 26 years old, as a promising playwright in the country. It was staged by the National School of Drama Repertory under the direction of Ebrahim Alkazi, with the actor Manohar Singh, playing the visionary king who later becomes disillusioned and turns bitter, amidst the historic Purana Qila in Delhi. It was staged in London by the National School of Drama for the Festival of India in 1982.

&quot;Hayavadana&quot; (1971) was based on a theme drawn from &quot;The Transposed Heads&quot;, a 1940 novella by Thomas Mann, which is originally found in the 11th-century Sanskrit text &quot;Kathasaritsagara&quot;. Herein he employed the folk theatre form of Yakshagana. A German version of the play was directed by Vijaya Mehta as part of the repertoire of the Deutsches National Theatre, Weimar.

&quot;Naga-Mandala&quot; (Play with Cobra, 1988) was based on a folk tale related to him by A. K. Ramanujam, brought him the Karnataka Sahitya Academy Award for the Most Creative Work of 1989. It was directed by J. Garland Wright, as part of the celebrations of the 30th anniversary of Guthrie Theatre, Minneapolis. The theatre subsequently commissioned him to write the play, &quot;Agni Mattu Male&quot; (The Fire and the Rain). Though before it came &quot;Taledanda&quot; (Death by Beheading, 1990) which used the backdrop, the rise of Veerashaivism, a radical protest and reform movement in 12th century Karnataka to bring out current issues.

===Movies===
Karnad made his acting as well as screenwriting debut in a Kannada movie, &quot;Samskara&quot; (1970), based on a novel by U.R. Ananthamurthy and directed by Pattabhirama Reddy. That movie won the first President&#x27;s Golden Lotus Award for Kannada cinema.

In television, he played the role of Swami&#x27;s father in the TV series &quot;Malgudi Days&quot; (1986–1987), based on R. K. Narayan&#x27;s books, directed by Kannada actor and director Shankar Nag. He also hosted the science magazine Turning Point on Doordarshan, in the early 1990s.

He made his directorial debut with &quot;Vamsha Vriksha&quot; (1971), based on a Kannada novel by S. L. Bhyrappa. It won him National Film Award for Best Direction along with B. V. Karanth, who co-directed the film. Later, Karnad directed several movies in Kannada and Hindi, including &quot;Godhuli&quot; (1977), &quot;Utsav&quot; (1984) and &quot;Cheluvi&quot; (1992). Karnad has made number of documentaries, like one on the Kannada poet D. R. Bendre (1972), &quot;Kanaka-Purandara&quot; (English, 1988) on two medieval Bhakti poets of Karnataka, Kanaka Dasa and Purandara Dasa, and &quot;The Lamp in the Niche&quot; (English, 1989) on Sufism and the Bhakti movement. Many of his films and documentaries have won several national and international awards.

Some of his famous Kannada movies include &quot;Tabbaliyu Neenade Magane&quot;, &quot;Ondanondu Kaladalli&quot; and &quot;Kaadu&quot; and most recent film &quot;Kanooru Heggaditi&quot; (1999), based on a novel by Kannada writer Kuvempu.

His Hindi movies include &quot;Nishaant&quot; (1975), &quot;Manthan&quot; (1976), &quot;Swami&quot; (1977), and &quot;Pukar&quot; (2000). He has acted in a number of Nagesh Kukunoor films, starting with &quot;Iqbal&quot; (2005), where Karnad&#x27;s role of the ruthless cricket coach got him critical acclaim. This was followed by &quot;Dor&quot; (2006), &quot;8 x 10 Tasveer&quot; (2009) and &quot;Aashayein&quot; (2010). He played a key role in movies &quot;Ek Tha Tiger&quot; (2012) and its sequel &quot;Tiger Zinda Hai&quot; (2017) produced by Yash Raj Films.

Karnad has acted in the Kannada gangster movie &quot;Aa Dinagalu&quot;.

===Other works===
He provided the voice of A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, former President of India, in the audiobook of Kalam&#x27;s autobiography by Charkha Audiobooks, &quot;Wings of Fire&quot;.

==Controversies==

At the Tata Literary Festival held in Mumbai in 2012, Karnad was invited to speak about &quot;his life in theater&quot; in an hour-long session. During his speech, he lashed out at V. S. Naipaul for his &quot;antipathy towards Indian Muslims&quot;. Naipaul had earlier been conferred the Lifetime achievement award by the festival&#x27;s organisers. Karnad also criticized the organizers for having honored Naipaul. The audience, which had gathered to hear Karnad speak, had mixed reactions to the speech. Some, like organizer Anil Dharker, tried ineffectually to steer the speech toward less controversial waters. Others were amused by the episode, and some commented on the research and logic that had gone into the speech (unfortunately overshadowed by its &#x27;scandalous&#x27; nature).

Just a few weeks after this, Karnad again created controversy by claiming that Rabindranath Tagore, who wrote India&#x27;s national anthem, was a great poet but a second-rate playwright.

In November 2015, during celebrations marking the anniversary of 18th-century Muslim ruler Tipu Sultan&#x27;s birth, Karnad stated that Bangalore International Airport should have been named after Tipu Sultan instead of Kempe Gowda. This created a furore among many people. Karnad apologised the following day.

==Personal life==
While working in Madras for Oxford University Press on his return from England, Karnad met his future wife Saraswathi Ganapathy at a party. They decided to marry but the marriage was only formalised ten years later, when Karnad was 42 years old. Saraswathi was born to a Parsi mother, Nurgesh Mugaseth, and a Kodava Hindu father, Kodandera Ganapathy. The couple had two children. They lived in Bengaluru. He was extremely fluent and well-versed in Kannada, Konkani, Hindi, and English.

==Activism==
He was a proponent of multiculturalism and freedom of expression. He was a critic of religious fundamentalism. He had publicly condemned the demolition of Babri Masjid in 1992 and later spoke against the attempts to create controversy about the Idgah Maidan in Hubli. He had opposed RSS, BJP and other organizations on several occasions. He opposed Narendra Modi for the Prime Minister&#x27;s post in the 2014 parliament elections. He was one of the 200 writers who put out an open letter against hate politics and for “diverse and equal India” during the 2019 general elections. With a tube in his nose, he wore a placard saying &quot;Me Too Urban Naxal&quot; at the first death anniversary of slain journalist Gauri Lankesh. Karnad claimed that Tipu Sultan was the greatest king Karnataka had in 500 years, on a religious controversy about the king. Karnad was a supporter of the Forum for Communal Harmony.

==Death==
Karnad died on 10 June 2019 at Bengaluru at the age of 81 due to multiple organ failure following prolonged illness.

&quot;After a discussion with his son, it was made clear to us that his last wish was to not have any floral procession, VVIPs or visits of any dignitaries. Hence, it will be a simple affair.&quot;

<text>In geology, a facies ( , ; same pronunciation and spelling in the plural) is a body of rock with distinctive characteristics. The characteristics can be any observable attribute of rocks (such as their overall appearance, composition, or condition of formation) and the changes that may occur in those attributes over a geographic area. A facies encompasses all the characteristics of a rock including its chemical, physical, and biological features that distinguish it from adjacent rock.

The term &quot;facies&quot; was introduced by the Swiss geologist Amanz Gressly in 1838 and was part of his significant contribution to the foundations of modern stratigraphy, which replaced the earlier notions of &quot;Neptunism&quot;.

== Walther&#x27;s law ==

Walther&#x27;s law of facies, or simply Walther&#x27;s law, named after the geologist Johannes Walther, states that the vertical succession of facies reflects lateral changes in environment. Conversely, it states that when a depositional environment &quot;migrates&quot; laterally, sediments of one depositional environment come to lie on top of another. In Russia the law is known as Golovkinsky-Walther&#x27;s law, honoring also Nikolai A. Golovkinsky. A classic example of this law is the vertical stratigraphic succession that typifies marine transgressions and regressions.

== Types ==

===Sedimentary===
Ideally, a sedimentary facies is a distinctive rock unit that forms under certain conditions of sedimentation, reflecting a particular process or environment. Sedimentary facies are either descriptive or interpretative. Sedimentary facies are bodies of sediment that are recognizably distinct from adjacent sediments that resulted from different depositional environments. Generally, geologists distinguish facies by the aspect of the rock or sediment being studied. Facies based on petrological characters (such as grain size and mineralogy) are called lithofacies, whereas facies based on fossil content are called &quot;biofacies&quot;.

A facies is usually further subdivided. The characteristics of the rock unit come from the depositional environment and from the original composition. Sedimentary facies reflect their depositional environment, each facies being a distinct kind of sediment for that area or environment.

Since its inception in 1838, the facies concept has been extended to related geological concepts. For example, characteristic associations of organic microfossils, and particulate organic material, in rocks or sediments, are called palynofacies. Discrete seismic units are similarly referred to as seismic facies.

Sedimentary facies are described in a group of &quot;facies descriptors&quot; which must be distinct, reproducible and exhaustive. A reliable facies description of an outcrop in the field would include: composition, texture, sedimentary structure(s), bedding geometry, nature of bedding contact, fossil content and colour.

===Metamorphic===

The sequence of minerals that develop during progressive metamorphism (that is, metamorphism at progressively higher temperatures and/or pressures) define a &quot;facies series&quot;.

<text>Abdoldjavad Falaturi (1926–1996) () was a German scholar of Iranian origin.

==Education==
He attended a German-Persian high school in his hometown of Isfahan and took private lessons in Arabic literature and Islamic studies. He carried on his education at Mahad and Tehran. Later, he attended the University of Tehran&#x27;s Faculty of Theology, where he graduated with a bachelor of arts in philosophy in 1333/1954. While in Germany, Falaturi studied a variety of courses, including philosophy, psychology, comparative religion, Greek, and Latin; he earned his PhD from the University of Bonn in 1962.
==Career==
He has also written several other official publications (together with Udo Tworuschka) for education in Germany on Islamic theology (initially &quot;Der Islam im Unterricht. Beiträge zur interkulturellen Erziehung in Europa&quot;, in: &quot;Beilage zu den Studien zur Internationalen Schulbuchforschung, Braunschweig&quot; : Georg-Eckert-Institut, 1992.)

From 1974 through 1996, he was a professor of Islamic philosophy, theology, and law at the University of Cologne. He played a significant role in developing the Shiite collection in the University of Cologne&#x27;s Oriental Department beginning in 1965.

He co-established the Islamic Academy for Research into the Interrelationships with Western Intellectual History and Culture in Cologne; formed in 1978) and was a founding member of the Central Council of Muslims in Germany (created in 1986). Falaturi was one of the few Persian religious intellectuals in close contact with Azhar University administrators after the Islamic Revolution of 1979, and he was then appointed to their Islamic council, the Majles al-al le-aeon al-lam al-eslm.

He focussed on the confusion between cultural habits and religious rules. Among others, he writes that it is incorrect to state that the chador is a religious obligation.

<text>The United States Marine Corps Designated Marksman Rifle (DMR, NSN 1005-01-458-6235; more formally the United States Rifle, Caliber 7.62 mm, M14, DMR) is a semi-automatic, gas-operated rifle chambered for the 7.62×51mm NATO cartridge. It is a modified version of the M14 rifle formerly used by the United States Marine Corps. The USMC Precision Weapons Section at Marine Corps Base Quantico built all DMRs.

The Marine Corps replaced the DMR with the M39 Enhanced Marksman Rifle on a one-for-one basis.

==History==
In 1989, the USMC began a program to upgrade M14s not decommissioned into DMRs by designing them with fiberglass stocks and new barrels. This was done by the Precision Weapons Section.

==Design==
The DMR was issued with match-grade M118LR 175-grain Long Range ammunition. It can have various scopes attached on the upper receiver, including the AN/PVS-4 Starlight scope, via picatinny rail.

The DMR can fire precisely up to 1,000 yards if M118LR special ball ammo is used.

The &quot;basic&quot; DMR (i.e., without secondary sight, magazine, sling, basic issue items, cleaning gear, suppressor and bipod) weighs or less. 

The DMR design facilitates repairing or replacing of the sight mount, barrel, bolt, and other key assemblies at the third echelon maintenance level.

===Specifications===
There are several notable differences between the basic M14 and the DMR.

*Barrel: A stainless steel, match-grade barrel by Krieger Barrels, Inc.
*Stock: McMillan Tactical M2A fiberglass stock. This particular stock features a pistol grip and a buttstock with adjustable saddle cheekpiece.
*Optics: An over-action MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail allows for the use of any optic compatible with the rail; this includes a rather large variety of military scopes and imaging devices.
*Muzzle device: Most DMRs utilize the traditional M14 muzzle device, although since deployment in 2001, some DMRs are now equipped with the OPS, Inc. 2-port muzzle brake, which is threaded and collared to accept an OPS-Inc. 12th Model sound suppressor.
*Bipod: A Harris S-L bipod is used on the USMC DMR.

==Combat use==
The DMR was previously used by Marine Corps FAST Companies and by the 4th Marine Expeditionary Brigade (Anti-Terrorism). Explosive Ordnance Disposal Teams use them to safely shoot at mines or other types of explosives that cannot be disarmed from a safe distance.

The DMR was previously used by USMC Scout Sniper Teams.

<doc id="1162155" wikidata="Q162792" url="?curid=1162155" title="Cedrela">
<text>Cedrela is a genus of several species in the mahogany family, Meliaceae. They are evergreen or dry-season deciduous trees with pinnate leaves, native to the tropical and subtropical New World, from southern Mexico south to northern Argentina.

On 28 October 2022, all Neo-tropic &quot;Cedrela&quot; species were added to CITES Appendix II.

==Taxonomy ==
These species are currently accepted:
*&quot;Cedrela angustifolia&quot; – Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador, Peru
*&quot;Cedrela discolor&quot; 
*&quot;Cedrela dugesii&quot; 
*&quot;Cedrela fissilis&quot; – Costa Rica south to Argentina
*&quot;Cedrela kuelapensis&quot; 
*&quot;Cedrela longipetiolulata&quot; 
*&quot;Cedrela molinensis&quot; 
*&quot;Cedrela monroensis&quot; 
*&quot;Cedrela montana&quot; – Colombia &amp; Ecuador
*&quot;Cedrela nebulosa&quot; 
*&quot;Cedrela odorata&quot; – West Indies and from 24° N in Mexico south to 28° S in Argentina
*&quot;Cedrela oaxacensis&quot; 
*&quot;Cedrela saltensis&quot; 
*&quot;Cedrela salvadorensis&quot; – Central America
*&quot;Cedrela tonduzii&quot; – Central America
*&quot;Cedrela weberbaueri&quot; 

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Cedrela odorata&quot; is the most common species in the genus, widespread in seasonally dry tropical and subtropical forests; it is deciduous in the dry season which may last several months. &quot;C. angustifolia&quot; and &quot;C. montana&quot; occur at higher altitudes in moister conditions, and are evergreen or only briefly deciduous.
==Uses==
&quot;Cedrela odorata&quot; is a timber tree that produces a lightweight, fragrant wood with resistance to wood-boring insects (e.g., termites) and is also rot-resistant. The wood is often sold under the name &quot;Spanish-cedar&quot; (it is neither Spanish nor a cedar), and is the traditional wood used for making cigar boxes, as well as being used for general outdoor and construction work, paneling and veneer wood, and necks and linings (interior strips of wood that attach the top and bottom of the guitar to the sides) of classical guitars and some electric guitars. Some species are now CITES-listed, in particular &quot;Cedrela odorata&quot;. It is also grown as an ornamental tree, and has become naturalized in some areas in Africa, southeast Asia and Hawaii. The other species have similar wood, but are less-used due to scarcity.

<text>Berkner is a lunar impact crater that is located on the far side of the Moon, just past the western limb. It is attached to the east-southeast rim of the crater Parenago. Just to the south is the Robertson, and to the southeast is Helberg.

The outer rim of this crater has been worn and eroded, particularly along the northwest half. The most intact part of the rim is to the southeast, while the remainder has been impacted and notched by smaller impacts, and to the southwest overlain by material.

Prior to formal naming by the IAU in 1970, Berkner was called &quot;Crater 176&quot;.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Berkner.

<doc id="1162160" wikidata="Q3091126" url="?curid=1162160" title="Fusibility">
<text>The fusibility of a material refers to the ease at which the material can be fused together, or to the temperature or amount of heat required to melt a material.
Materials such as solder require a relatively low melting point so that when heat is applied to a joint, the solder will melt before the materials being soldered together melt, i.e. high fusibility. On the other hand, firebricks used for furnace linings only melt at very high temperatures (and then they retract, or decompose, or become fracture-prone) and so have low fusibility. Perhaps refractory materials often have low fusibility.

==Scientific methods==

To find the fusibility of certain compounds/materials, there are 2 methods:

===Heat test===

The most common test used to determine fusibility is to join two pieces with a variable heat source, increasing the temperature or power used in steps, and testing bond strength for each step. If there is no step with good bond strength after joining, then fusibility is said to be low.

===Ash fusibility test===

In the context of coal analysis, ash fusibility values of the residual coal ash of a coal are often specified. The values are determined using an empirical method based on the geometrical changes upon heating to a relevant temperature, of a conical ash sample. The fusibility of the ash is of interest because it roughly indicates the properties of the clinker that will be produced during burning.

<text>Sun Life Financial Inc. is a Canadian financial services company. It is primarily known as a life insurance company.

Sun Life has a presence in investment management with over CAD$1.3 trillion in assets under management operating in a number of countries. In 2022 the company ranked number 235 on the Forbes Global 2000 list.

==History==

===Pre-World War II===
Founded in Montreal, Quebec, as The Sun Insurance Company of Montreal in 1865 by Matthew Hamilton Gault (1822–1887), an Irish immigrant who settled in Montreal in 1842. However, operations actually began in 1871. By the end of the 19th century, it had expanded to Central and South America, the United States, the United Kingdom, West Indies, Japan, China, Philippines, India, North Africa and other international markets. During the next five decades, the company grew and prospered, surviving the difficulties of World War I and the large drain on its finances through policy claims arising from the large number of deaths caused by the Great Flu Epidemic of 1918.

The company&#x27;s original Dominion Square building in Montreal was built in 1918. Capping a Montreal construction boom that began in the 1920s, the company completed construction of the expansion of its headquarters with its new 26-story headquarters north tower in 1933. Although the head office of the Royal Bank of Canada on St. James Street was taller by several floors, the Sun Life Building was at the time the largest building in terms of square footage anywhere in the British Empire.

Chartered in 1865, its traditional base business worldwide remains life insurance. However, it now also has significant asset management operations. In 1919, it was the first Canadian company to offer group life insurance. Having begun its first US operations in 1895, the company sold its first group life plan in the U.S. in 1924.

===World War II===
In World War II, as part of Operation Fish, securities from the United Kingdom were secretly moved to the Sun Life Building for safekeeping. A persistent, but incorrect, rumour is that the Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom had been illegally shipped out of the United Kingdom during WWII and stored there was deliberately spread in Montreal to account for increased activity at the building.

===1977–1980===
In 1977, the newly-elected sovereigntist Quebec government passed the Charter of the French Language (known as Bill 101), making the use of French language mandatory for medium- and large-scale companies when communicating with French-speaking staff. The law was received negatively by the English-speaking business community, many of whom perceived that the historical rights of the English-speaking minority should be respected. The new government also promised a referendum on Quebec sovereignty, injecting instability into the Montreal business community. On January 6, 1978, Sun Life became the first large company to leave Quebec post-election, announcing that it would move its head office to rented space in Toronto, Ontario. Officially, Sun Life said it was motivated by the political instability and economic uncertainty of Quebec&#x27;s future, but skeptics said it was the company&#x27;s unwillingness to comply with the requirements of Bill 101. In a reaction the next day, the province&#x27;s finance minister Jacques Parizeau called Sun Life &quot;one of the worst exporters of Quebec capital&quot;, and threatened to freeze some $400 million CAD in assets.

In 1979, the company acquired a property at University Avenue and King Street in downtown Toronto and constructed a new office complex, the Sun Life Centre, which was completed in 1984.

For the largest employer of English-speaking people in Montreal, this would make things very difficult. Many, if not most, of Sun Life&#x27;s Head Office employees in 1979 were not fluent in French. Sun Life was quite clear that this was the reason for its move when it made the announcement. The PQ government was quick to label Sun Life &quot;bad corporate citizens&quot; and claimed that if &quot;they had only warned us, we could have worked something out.&quot;

The downsizing of Sun Life&#x27;s Montreal office did not take place overnight. Transfers and moves occurred on a departmental basis and did not commence until several months after the announcement. By 1980, 300 head office employees were located in Toronto.

=== 2000s ===
In 2008, Sun Life sold its 37% interest in CI Financial Income Fund to Scotiabank. Sun Life had originally acquired a significant ownership interest in the firm by selling its Canadian mutual fund subsidiaries to CI Financial in 2002.

=== 2010s ===
In addition, in July 2019, SLC&#x27;s real estate division was merged under the name BentallGreenOak Real Estate.

In December 2020, Dean Connor announced his intent to retire as President and CEO in August 2021. He was then replaced by Kevin Strain, who was the former Chief Financial Officer at Sun Life.

== Sun Life in North America ==

=== Canada ===
Sun Life contributes to the local economy as one of the top 5 major employers in the region, with approximately 3,500 employees – more than 40% of Sun Life&#x27;s employee base in Canada.

In 2012, Sun Life celebrated the 100th anniversary of its Canadian head office building, located on King Street, right on the border of the Cities of Kitchener and Waterloo. The English headquarters is in Waterloo, and most of the French business is done in the main Montreal office. There are also offices in Toronto, Vancouver, Halifax and Ottawa.

=== United States ===
Sun Life U.S. has the sixth-largest group benefits business in the United States and serves more than 60,000 employers in small, medium and large workplaces.

In 2018, Sun Life U.S. was named one of the Top Places to Work in Massachusetts for 2018 by &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;.

== Sun Life Asset Management ==
Sun Life&#x27;s asset management operation includes subsidiaries:

* MFS Investment Management, which serves individual and institutional investors around the world;
* SLC Management, which provides investment options for defined benefit pension plans, insurance companies and other institutional investors globally. SLC Management has two distinct units: a fixed-income pillar operating under the SLC Management banner (including Sun Life affiliates Prime Advisors, Ryan Labs Asset Management and Sun Life Institutional Investments); and a real estate division named BentallGreenOak.
*In December 2019, Sun Life announced an intention to acquire a majority stake in InfraRed Capital Partners, which will see InfraRed form part of SLC Management
*In October 2020, Sun Life announced an intent to acquire a 51% stake in alternative credit investment manager Crescent Capital LP. Crescent will be part of SLC Management.

As of March 31, 2019, SLC Management&#x27;s collective operations have assets under management of C$212 billion (US$159 billion).

=== SLC Management ===
SLC Management, formerly Sun Life Investment Management (SLIM), began in 2013 when Sun Life created Sun Life Institutional Investments (Canada) Inc., to offer a range of institutional alternative asset class funds to investors in Canada.

In June 2019, Sun Life re-branded SLIM to SLC Management and fully merged its fixed income businesses, Ryan Labs Asset Management Inc. and Prime Advisors, Inc. with Sun Life Capital Management (U.S.) In addition, in July 2019, SLC&#x27;s real estate division was merged under the name BentallGreenOak Real Estate.

== Sun Life in Asia ==
Sun Life operates in eight Asian markets - China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Vietnam, India, and Philippines.

In 1891, the company persuaded businessman Ira Thayer to go to Asia to start an insurance business. Thayer set up a business in China in 1892 that went on to prosper for the next 54 years.

Sun Life grew to become the biggest foreign insurer in China until the Second World War when it shut down operations. The company returned to China in 1995 via a joint venture.

=== China ===
In 1995, Sun Life joined with the China Everbright Group to form Sun Life Everbright.

In 2002, Sun Life Everbright was granted approval to sell life insurance in Tianjin, China, becoming the first foreign life insurance joint venture to operate in that city and its neighbouring counties.

In 2011, Sun Life Everbright received regulatory approval in China to establish Sun Life Everbright Insurance Asset Management Company, only the 12th such license issued in China.

=== Hong Kong ===

Sun Life started operating in Hong Kong since February 22, 1892.
There was a name change from SunLife Financial (HK) Ltd to Sun Life Hong Kong Ltd.

Sun Life acquired CMG Asia ComServe Financial from Commonwealth Bank of Australia in 2005. 

For some years, it had taken over the MPF schemes from a number of other competitors in 2010s due to its strong performance of the Hong Kong equity fund. For example, in 2016, Schroder Investment Management (Hong Kong) Limited transferred its MPF scheme to Sun Life Hong Kong.

=== India ===
Birla Sun Life Asset Management, now known as the Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund (ABSLAMC), is an investment managing company registered under the Securities and Exchange Board of India. It is a joint venture between Sun Life and the Aditya Birla Group of India.

Established in 1994, BSLAMC has been a joint venture between the Aditya Birla Group and Sun Life since 1999.

With more than $34 billion U.S. in assets under management as of 2017, Aditya Birla Sun Life Asset Management Company is one of the largest asset managers in India.

Aditya Birla Sun Life Insurance was established on August 4, 2000, and began operations in 2001 with three insurance plans. The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) granted registration in principle to Birla Sun Life. Initially, Sun Life Financial held a 26% stake in this joint venture, and later increased its stake to 49%.

The company received awards such as the Bhartiya Shiromani Puraskar in 2006 and the Silver award in the Insurance category at the ICAI Awards for Excellence in Financial Reporting in 2009. In 2011, ABSLI introduced the BSLI Foresight Plan, followed by the BSLI Wealth Secure Life Plan in 2012. In June 2023, ABSLI launched the Nishchit Pension Plan, aimed at assisting individuals in retirement planning. In August 2023, ABSLI announced the ABSLI Nishchit Laabh Plan, a non-linked, non-participating individual life insurance savings plan.

=== Philippines ===
Sun Life entered the Philippines in 1895, and established its Cebu operations in the 1960s. As of 2019, Sun Life is the number one provider of insurance products to Filipinos. Sun Life has been in Asia since the early 1890s.

In 1895, Sun Life began its operations in the Philippines through the representation of the H.J. Andrews and Co., a British trading firm. Throughout the Philippine Revolution, Sun Life Philippines experienced continuous growth.

Sun Life had underground operations during the Japanese Occupation which occurred between 1942 and 1945. Sun Life was the only life insurance company who paid post-war death claims amounting to USD 1.3 million even without documents attesting to the validity of the claims. In the end, all claims were found to be legitimate.

In 2011, Sun Life signed a joint venture agreement with the Yuchengco Group of companies for the creation of Sun Life Grepa Financial Inc., marking Sun Life&#x27;s entry into the bancassurance business.

In 2023, the Insurance Commission&#x27;s 2023 report ranked Sun Life of Canada (Philippines), Inc. number 1 with P306.33 billion total assets and P8.79 billion net income. Hence, on its 129th anniversary, headed by CEO and Benedict Sison, it remained the top life insurance company for 13 consecutive years with P55.79 billion in Total Premium Income. Prudential plc Pru Life UK, however, later became top life insurance seller in 2023, and bested Sun Life of Canada Philippines by P472 million.

== Corporate Initiatives ==

=== Sustainability ===
In March 2021, Sun Life announced new sustainable investing commitments, including an additional C$20 billion in sustainable investments over the next five years across its General Account and third party investments. The company is also pushing to scale back its GHG emissions intensity by 30% by 2030.

=== DEI efforts ===
Sun Life committed to having 25% of under-represented minorities and gender parity at senior leader level by 2025.

=== Sports Marketing ===
==== Miami Dolphins NFL Stadium Sponsorship (2010–2016) ====
In 2010, Sun Life purchased the naming rights for the home field of the Miami Dolphins in Miami Gardens, Florida, for a reported US$7.5 million per year.

==Global Headquarters - One York==
Sun Life Global Headquarters in Toronto, Ontario, is located at One York Street in Toronto&#x27;s South Core. The 800,000-square-foot location is along the Gardiner Expressway and holds a prominent position on the Toronto skyline.

Before the Corporate Office moved to its new Global HQ at One York Street, the Sun Life Centre on King Street served as its headquarters. Previously, Sun Life Building in Montreal was the head office. The Sun Life Building in Montreal is a historic 122 m (400 ft), 24-story office building at 1155 Metcalfe Street on Dorchester Square in downtown Montreal.

<doc id="1162163" wikidata="Q2435125" url="?curid=1162163" title="Hard spheres">
<text>Hard spheres are widely used as model particles in the statistical mechanical theory of fluids and solids. They are defined simply as impenetrable spheres that cannot overlap in space. They mimic the extremely strong (&quot;infinitely elastic bouncing&quot;) repulsion that atoms and spherical molecules experience at very close distances. Hard spheres systems are studied by analytical means, by molecular dynamics simulations, and by the experimental study of certain colloidal model systems.

Beside being a model of theoretical significance, the hard-sphere system is used as a basis in the formulation of several modern, predictive Equations of State for real fluids through the SAFT approach, and models for transport properties in gases through Chapman-Enskog Theory.

==Formal definition==

Hard spheres of diameter formula_1 are particles with the following pairwise interaction potential:

:formula_2

where formula_3 and formula_4 are the positions of the two particles.

==Hard-spheres gas==

The first three virial coefficients for hard spheres can be determined analytically

Higher-order ones can be determined numerically using Monte Carlo integration. We list
A table of virial coefficients for up to eight dimensions can be found on the page Hard sphere: virial coefficients.

The hard sphere system exhibits a fluid-solid phase transition between the volume fractions of freezing formula_5 and melting formula_6. The pressure diverges at random close packing formula_7 for the metastable liquid branch and at close packing formula_8 for the stable solid branch.

==Hard-spheres liquid==

The static structure factor of the hard-spheres liquid can be calculated using the Percus–Yevick approximation.

== The Carnahan-Starling Equation of State ==
A simple, yet popular equation of state describing systems of pure hard spheres was developed in 1969 by N. F. Carnahan and K. E. Starling. By expressing the compressibility of a hard-sphere system as a geometric series, the expression

formula_9

is obtained, where formula_10 is the packing fraction, given by

formula_11

where formula_12 is Avogadros number, formula_13 is the molar density of the fluid, and formula_1 is the diameter of the hard-spheres. From this Equation of State, one can obtain the residual Helmholtz energy,

formula_15,

which yields the residual chemical potential

formula_16.

One can also obtain the value of the radial distribution function, formula_17, evaluated at the surface of a sphere,

formula_18.

The latter is of significant importance to accurate descriptions of more advanced intermolecular potentials based on perturbation theory, such as SAFT, where a system of hard spheres is taken as a reference system, and the complete pair-potential is described by perturbations to the underlying hard-sphere system. Computation of the transport properties of hard-sphere gases at moderate densities using Revised Enskog Theory also relies on an accurate value for formula_19, and the Carnahan-Starling Equation of State has been used for this purpose to large success.

<doc id="1162164" wikidata="Q1869425" url="?curid=1162164" title="Long Reach Ethernet">
<text>Long Reach Ethernet (LRE) was a proprietary networking protocol marketed by Cisco Systems, intended to support multi-megabit (5 to 15 Mbit/s) performance over telephone-grade unshielded twisted pair wiring over distances up to 5,000 feet (1.5 km).
Supporting such distance ranges, LRE is technically classified as a Metropolitan area network (MAN) technology.
Technically the protocol was similar to very-high-bitrate digital subscriber line (VDSL), practically Ethernet over VDSL (EoVDSL).

The technology was sometimes considered an example of Ethernet in the first mile (EFM).
Several networking vendors offered compatible networking hardware, but the technology became obsolete.

== Description==
Like standard VDSL, LRE allowed existing telephone wiring that connects an organization&#x27;s offices to be used to network those offices together using standard Ethernet protocol without incurring the huge cost of deploying fiber-optic cable or limiting organizations to the bandwidth provided by modems or other digital subscriber line services.

Other sample applications included Internet access to hotel rooms or college dormitories over existing installed telephone wiring.

LRE was compatible with VDSL ETSI Band Plan 998.

Cisco sold Cisco Catalyst model 2900 switches using Infineon Technologies PEF22822/PEB22811 VDSL QAM chipset like many other VDSL concentrators.
The customer-premises equipment included the Cisco 575 desktop bridge.
Products were announced in February 2001 to be available in April 2001.
Infineon used the name 10BaseS for the technology,

Cisco included LRE in its Mobile Office marketing effort.
A few compatible devices were produced.
Cisco announced end-of-sale for the LRE products in October 2006, and its explanation page was removed from their web site in 2007.

HomePNA promotes similar technologies for use within a home rather than to a central office or business, with its 2.0, 3.0, and 3.1 releases. Different frequency bands are used so that VDSL and HomePNA can share the same wires.

<doc id="1162170" wikidata="Q3694119" url="?curid=1162170" title="Stratigraphic unit">
<text>A stratigraphic unit is a volume of rock of identifiable origin and relative age range that is defined by the distinctive and dominant, easily mapped and recognizable petrographic, lithologic or paleontologic features (facies) that characterize it.

Units must be &quot;mappable&quot; and &quot;distinct&quot; from one another, but the contact need not be particularly distinct. For instance, a unit may be defined by terms such as &quot;when the sandstone component exceeds 75%&quot;.

==Lithostratigraphic units==
Sequences of sedimentary and volcanic rocks are subdivided on the basis of their shared or associated lithology. Formally identified lithostratigraphic units are structured in a hierarchy of lithostratigraphic rank, higher rank units generally comprising two or more units of lower rank. Going from smaller to larger in rank, the main lithostratigraphic ranks are bed, member, formation, group and supergroup.

Formal names of lithostratigraphic units are assigned by geological surveys. Units of formation or higher rank are usually named for the unit&#x27;s type location, and the formal name usually also states the unit&#x27;s rank or lithology. A lithostratigraphic unit may have a change in rank over a some distance; a group may thin to a formation in another region and a formation may reduce in rank for member or bed as it &quot;pinches out&quot;.

===Bed===

A bed is a lithologically distinct layer within a member or formation and is the smallest recognisable stratigraphic unit. These are not normally named, but may be in the case of a marker horizon.

===Member===
A member is a named lithologically distinct part of a formation. Not all formations are subdivided in this way and even where they are recognized, they may only form part of the formation. A member need not be mappable at the same scale as a formation.

===Formation===

Formations are the primary units used in the subdivision of a sequence and may vary in scale from tens of centimetres to kilometres. They should be distinct lithologically from other formations, although the boundaries do not need to be sharp. To be formally recognised, a formation must have sufficient extent to be useful in mapping an area.

===Group===

A group is a set of two or more formations that share certain lithological characteristics. A group may be made up of different formations in different geographical areas and individual formations may appear in more than one group. Groups are occasionally divided into subgroups, but subgroups are not mentioned in the North American Stratigraphic Code, and are permitted under International Commission on Stratigraphy guidelines only in exceptional circumstances.

===Supergroup===
A supergroup is a set of two or more associated groups and/or formations that share certain lithological characteristics. A supergroup may be made up of different groups in different geographical areas.

==Biostratigraphic units==

A sequence of fossil-bearing sedimentary rocks can be subdivided on the basis of the occurrence of particular fossil taxa. A unit defined in this way is known as a biostratigraphic unit, generally shortened to biozone. The five commonly used types of biozone are assemblage, range, abundance, interval and lineage zones.
* An &quot;assemblage zone&quot; is a stratigraphic interval characterised by an assemblage of three or more coexisting fossil taxa that distinguish it from surrounding strata.
* A &quot;range zone&quot; is a stratigraphic interval that represents the occurrence range of a specific fossil taxon, based on the localities where it has been recognised.
* An &quot;abundance zone&quot; is a stratigraphic interval in which the abundance of a particular taxon (or group of taxa) is significantly greater than seen in neighbouring parts of the succession.
* An &quot;interval zone&quot; is a stratigraphic interval whose top and base are defined by horizons that mark the first or last occurrence of two different taxa.
* A &quot;lineage zone&quot; is a stratigraphic interval that contains fossils that represent parts of the evolutionary lineage of a particular fossil group. This is a special case of a range zone.

<doc id="1162174" wikidata="Q1755702" url="?curid=1162174" title="Dagsavisen">
<text> is a daily newspaper published in Oslo, Norway. The former party organ of the Norwegian Labour Party, the ties loosened over time from 1975 to 1999. It has borne several names, and was called &quot;Arbeiderbladet&quot; from 1923 to 1997. Eirik Hoff Lysholm is editor-in-chief. The newspaper depends on economic support from the Norwegian Government.

==History==
 was established by Christian Holtermann Knudsen in 1884 under the name &quot;Vort Arbeide&quot; (&#x27;Our Work&#x27; in archaic Riksmål), and was affiliated with the trade union center &quot;Fagforeningernes Centralkomité&quot;. Holtermann Knudsen also had to establish his own printing press since the existing printing presses did not want to be affiliated with a labourers’ newspaper. The fledgling project was marred by economic problems, and the burden of writing, editing, and printing lay chiefly on Knudsen. In 1885 the newly founded association &quot;Socialdemokratisk Forening&quot; formally took over the newspaper. The name was changed from &quot;Vort Arbeide&quot; to &quot;Social-Demokraten&quot; (&#x27;The Social Democrat&#x27;) in 1886. The next year, the Norwegian Labour Party was founded, and &quot;Social-Demokraten&quot; became its official party organ. Carl Jeppesen took over as editor-in-chief. In 1894 the newspaper was published on a daily basis, and in 1904 the financial balance was positive.

Around 1920 there were tensions in the Labour Party. The radical wing spearheaded by Martin Tranmæl and Kyrre Grepp had assumed control over the party at the 1918 national convention. The party aligned itself with the Comintern. As a result, a moderate wing broke out in 1921 to form the Social Democratic Labour Party. Nonetheless, &quot;Social-Demokraten&quot; remained affiliated with the Labour Party, as Martin Tranmæl assumed the editorship in 1921. In 1923, the same year as the Labour Party renounced the Comintern and the communist wing broke away, &quot;Social-Demokraten&quot; changed its name to &quot;Arbeiderbladet&quot; (lit. &#x27;The Worker Paper&#x27;) in 1923. The factionalism was contrary to the goal of Christian Holtermann Knudsen, who wanted to unite the fledgling labour movement.

In 1940, upon the German invasion and subsequent occupation of Norway, &quot;Arbeiderbladet&quot; was stopped by the Nazi authorities. The only legal party in Norway during the occupation, Nasjonal Samling, evicted &quot;Arbeiderbladet&quot; from its premises, using it as headquarters for its party organ &quot;Fritt Folk&quot;. &quot;Arbeiderbladet&quot;&#x27;s printing press was also utilized by &quot;Fritt Folk&quot;. Only in 1945, upon the liberation of Norway, did &quot;Arbeiderbladet&quot; resume publication.

Olav Larssen, imprisoned during the occupation, was promoted from news editor as he succeeded Martin Tranmæl as editor-in-chief in 1949. At that time, the editor-in-chief was elected by the national convention of the Labour Party, and the editor-in-chief was also an ex officio member of the party&#x27;s central committee. This practice continued with editors-in-chief Reidar Hirsti and Einar Olsen, until abolished in 1975. From this point, the board of directors appointed the editor-in-chief.

In 1974, Tor and Trygve Bratteli, aided by Jens Chr. Hauge, forced Hirsti out of his job.

&quot;Arbeiderbladet&quot; was formally owned by the Labour Party until 1991, when a separate, but affiliated, entity Norsk Arbeiderpresse took over. The labour-inspired name &quot;Arbeiderbladet&quot; was changed in 1997, to the neutral (&#x27;The Daily Newspaper&#x27;). In 1999 a step towards independence was taken, as the newspaper was published by the public company Dagsavisen AS, which is in turn was owned 100% by the foundation Stiftelsen Dagsavisen. As of 2016, this foundation only owns 9% of the shares of Dagsavisen directly, with the remaining 91% of the paper owned by Mentor Medier AS. This company also owns the Christian daily , and is partly owned by Christian groups such as Normisjon, Blå Kors and the Norwegian Lutheran Mission. The largest owner is Mushom Invest (10%). Stiftelsen Dagsavisen controls 6% of the shares in Mentor Medier AS.

The newspaper depends on economic support from the Norwegian Government.

==Publishing==
The newspaper changed to tabloid format in 1990, having used the Berliner format since 1976. In 1997 it launched its Internet version, and also started publishing on Sundays. The Sunday edition was discontinued in 2007 due to economic problems. It is widely accepted that would face drastic problems if the distinctively Norwegian press support were to cease.

 is published six days a week.

 had a circulation of 28,337 in 2009, making it the fifth largest Oslo-based newspaper, after and . It is also smaller than the regional and local newspapers , , , &quot;Sunnmørsposten&quot; and .

Its slogan is &quot;Nyheter med mening&quot; (&#x27;Meaningful news&#x27;).
