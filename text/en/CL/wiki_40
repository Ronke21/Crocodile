<doc id="1167302" wikidata="Q6898103" url="?curid=1167302" title="Monarchy of South Africa">
<text>From 1910 to 1961 the Union of South Africa was a self-governing country that shared a monarch with the United Kingdom and other Dominions of the British Empire. The monarch&#x27;s constitutional roles were mostly delegated to the Governor-General of the Union of South Africa.

The South Africa Act 1909 united four British colonies: Cape of Good Hope, Natal, Orange River Colony and Transvaal, to form the Union of South Africa with the monarch as its head of state. In 1947, King George VI became the first reigning monarch to visit South Africa. His successor, Queen Elizabeth II was granted a distinct South African style and title by the Parliament of South Africa in 1953.

South Africa became a republic and left the Commonwealth on 31 May 1961. On 1 June 1994, South Africa rejoined the Commonwealth as a republic, after the end of apartheid.

==Origin==

In the aftermath of the Anglo-Boer War (1899–1902), Britain re-annexed the South African Republic and the Orange Free State, two hitherto independent Boer republics. These new territories, renamed the Transvaal Colony and the Orange River Colony respectively, were added to Britain&#x27;s existing South African territories, the Cape Colony and Colony of Natal. It was British government policy to encourage these four colonies to come together in closer union; after the grant of responsible government to the Transvaal Colony and Orange River Colony in 1907, this aspiration was one that was also increasingly held by the Afrikaner population.

These political forces resulted in the 1908 National Convention, which met on 12 October 1908 and completed its work on 11 May 1909. This convention settled on the terms and constitution of a governmental, legislative, and economic Union. These proposals were transmitted to the British government, which duly prepared a bill to give effect to these wishes. The bill was approved by the four colonial parliaments in June 1909, and was passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom on 20 September 1909, and the Union of South Africa was established on 31 May 1910.

==Development of shared monarchy==

The South Africa Act 1909 united four British colonies: Cape of Good Hope, Natal, Orange River Colony and Transvaal, to form the Union of South Africa as a British Dominion with the monarch as its head of state.

The Balfour Declaration of 1926 provided the dominions the right to be considered equal to Britain, rather than subordinate; an agreement that had the result of, in theory, a shared Crown that operated independently in South Africa rather than a unitary British Crown under which all the dominions were secondary. The monarchy thus ceased to be an exclusively British institution, and henceforth became a &quot;domesticated&quot; establishment. The Statute of Westminster 1931 further increased the sovereignty of the self-governing Dominions, and also bound them all to seek each other&#x27;s approval for changes to monarchical titles and the common line of succession. As the statute removed nearly all of the British parliament&#x27;s authority to legislate for the Dominions, it had the effect of making the Dominions largely sovereign nations in their own right.

Although the Union of South Africa was not among the Dominions that needed to adopt the Statute of Westminster for it to take effect, the Status of the Union Act, 1934 was passed to confirm South Africa&#x27;s status as a fully sovereign state. It declared the Union of South Africa to be a &quot;sovereign independent state&quot; and explicitly adopted the Statute of Westminster into South African law.

===Title===

Until the early part of the 20th century, the monarch&#x27;s title throughout the British Empire was determined exclusively by the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The preamble to the Statute of Westminster 1931 established the convention requiring the consent of all the Dominions&#x27; parliaments, as well as that of the United Kingdom, to any alterations to the monarch&#x27;s style and title. It had been decided among the realms in 1949 that each should have its own monarchical title, but with common elements. At the 1952 Commonwealth Prime Ministers&#x27; Economic Conference, Commonwealth prime ministers agreed that each member of the Commonwealth &quot;should use for its own purposes a form of the Royal Style and Titles which suits its own particular circumstances but retains a substantial element which is common to all&quot;. It was decided that the monarch&#x27;s title in all her realms have, as their common element, the description of the Sovereign as &quot;Queen of Her Realms and Territories and Head of the Commonwealth&quot;. The parliament of each realm passed its own Royal Style and Titles Act before Elizabeth&#x27;s coronation in June of the following year.

The Royal Style and Titles Act 1953, passed by the Parliament of South Africa, rendered the Queen&#x27;s South African style and title in three languages:

* In English: &quot;Elizabeth II, Queen of South Africa and of Her other Realms and Territories, Head of the Commonwealth&quot;
* In Afrikaans: &quot;Elizabeth II, Koningin van Suid-Afrika en van Haar ander Koninkryke en Gebiede, Hoof van die Statebond&quot;
* In Latin: &quot;Elizabeth II, Africae Australis regnorumque suo rum ceterorum Regina, consortionis populorum Princeps&quot;

===Succession===

By convention, succession in South Africa was deferred to the laws of the United Kingdom; whoever was monarch of Britain was automatically the monarch of South Africa. Succession in Britain was by male-preference primogeniture governed by common law, the Act of Settlement 1701, and the Bill of Rights 1689. These legislations limited the succession to the natural (i.e. non-adopted), legitimate descendants of Sophia, Electress of Hanover, and stipulated that the monarch cannot be a Roman Catholic and must be in communion with the Church of England upon ascending the throne. However, the United Kingdom and the British Dominions agreed, via adopting the Statute of Westminster, not to change the rules of succession without the unanimous consent of the other realms, unless explicitly leaving the shared monarchy relationship. For instance, in 1937, the Parliament of South Africa had to pass the &quot;His Majesty King Edward the Eighth&#x27;s Abdication Act, 1937&quot; to ratify the abdication of King Edward VIII and the succession to the throne of King George VI, that occurred in December 1936.

Upon a demise of the Crown (the death or abdication of a sovereign), it was customary for the accession of the new monarch to be publicly proclaimed by the governor-general after the accession. Regardless of any proclamations, the late sovereign&#x27;s heir immediately and automatically succeeded, without any need for confirmation or further ceremony. An appropriate period of mourning also followed, after which the new monarch was crowned in an ancient ritual in the United Kingdom.

==Constitutional role==

The structure of the government of the Union of South Africa was similar to the government of other dominions. The monarch was represented in the Union by the governor-general of South Africa.

===Executive===

All executive authority was vested in the monarch, and was exercised by the governor-general on the monarch&#x27;s behalf. The governor-general appointed an Executive Council, to advise him on how to execute the executive powers in the government of the Union. All executive councillors held office during the viceroy&#x27;s pleasure.

Though not explicitly provided for by the South Africa Act, the office of Prime Minister of South Africa was also established as the head of government and, like other government ministers, the prime minister was required to be a member of either house of Parliament. As in other British Dominions, the governor-general appointed the leader of the largest political party in the lower house of Parliament as prime minister.

The governor-general additionally appointed members of the Executive Council as ministers to administer departments of State of the Union.

===Parliament===

The legislative power of the Union was vested in the Parliament, which consisted of the monarch, a Senate, and a House of Assembly.

The monarch and the governor-general did not, however, participate in the legislative process; they only took part in the granting of royal assent. The viceroy could return any bill presented to him by the House, with certain amendments he might recommend. The viceroy could also withhold assent, or reserve the bill for the signification of the monarch&#x27;s pleasure. The monarch also had the power to disallow any act within one year after it was assented by the governor-general. After the granting of royal assent, the Clerk of the House of Assembly was responsible for enrolling two copies of the act, one in English and the other in Dutch, in the records of the office of the Registrar of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa.

Further, the constitution outlined that the governor-general alone was responsible for appointing senators. Every senator and every member of the House of Assembly was required to make an oath or affirmation of allegiance to the monarch before taking office.

The governor-general was also responsible for summoning, proroguing, and dissolving parliament.

===Courts===

The South Africa Act established a Supreme Court for the Union. The Chief Justice of South Africa, the ordinary judges of appeal, and all other judges of the Supreme Court were appointed by the governor-general.

In case of incapacity of any judge, the governor-general could appoint any other judge of the Supreme Court of South Africa to temporarily discharge the required duties as the case may be.

==Cultural role==

The Sovereign&#x27;s Birthday was commemorated on the second Monday in July with a public holiday.

===The Crown and Honours===

The monarch, as the fount of honour, conferred awards and honours in South Africa in his or her name. Most of them were awarded on the advice of South African ministers.

Depictions of the Royal Crown, the Royal Cypher or the sovereign&#x27;s likeness, appeared on various medals and decorations.

===The Crown and the Armed Forces===

The command-in-chief of the naval and military forces of the Union of South Africa was vested in the monarch, and was exercised by the governor-general as their representative.

References to the Royal Crown appeared on various regimental badges and rank insignia, which illustrated the monarchy as the locus of authority. In 1957, due to growing republicanism, the Crown was either removed from the badges of the defence force and police, or replaced with the Union Lion from the crest of the country&#x27;s coat of arms. In 1961, the &quot;Royal&quot; title was dropped from the names of some South African Army regiments, such as the Natal Carbineers.

Until 1952, South African Naval vessels bore the ship prefix &quot;HMSAS&quot;, i.e., &quot;His Majesty&#x27;s South African Ship&quot;, and it was thereafter replaced by &quot;SAS&quot;, i.e., &quot;South African Ship&quot;.

===Royal visits===

In 1860, Prince Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the second son and fourth child of Queen Victoria, became the first member of the royal family to visit South Africa. Later, in 1901, the then Duke and Duchess of Cornwall (later King George V and Queen Mary) visited South Africa during an extensive tour of the British Empire. Their eldest son, Edward, Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII), toured the country in 1925.

In 1947, King George VI, his wife Queen Elizabeth, and their daughters Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret, visited the country, during a three-month tour of Southern Africa. On 21 February 1947, King George VI, accompanied by Queen Elizabeth, opened a new session of the South African Parliament, the first state opening of a Dominion parliament by a reigning monarch. In his speech, the King spoke in both English and Afrikaans, and thanked South Africa for its support during the Second World War. It was in South Africa that Princess Elizabeth notably celebrated her 21st birthday and delivered the famous broadcast to the Empire on 21 April, in which she said, &quot;I declare before you all that my whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong&quot;.

However, due to the South African Government&#x27;s apartheid regime soon after the 1947 visit, royal visits to South Africa came to a halt, despite Elizabeth II being Queen of South Africa until 1961. Nearly half a century later, the Queen and her husband Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh undertook a state visit to South Africa in 1995, in support of reconciliation with the new South African government, and were hosted by President Nelson Mandela. The Queen returned to South Africa for the 16th Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Durban in 1999.

==Republicanism==

In 1940, D. F. Malan, along with J. B. M. Hertzog, founded the Herenigde Nasionale Party (or &quot;Reunited National Party&quot;) which pledged to fight for &quot;a free independent republic, separated from the British Crown and Empire&quot;, and &quot;to remove, step by step, all anomalies which hamper the fullest expression of our national freedom&quot;. In 1942, details of a draft republican constitution were published in Afrikaans-language newspapers &quot;Die Burger&quot; and &quot;Die Transvaler&quot;, which provided for a State President, elected by white citizens known as &quot;Burgers&quot; only, who would be &quot;only responsible to God... for his deeds in the fulfilment of his duties&quot;. On the matter of continued Commonwealth membership, the view of Afrikaner Broederbond was that &quot;departure from the Commonwealth as soon as possible remains a cardinal aspect of our republican aim&quot;.

In 1948, the National Party, now led by D. F. Malan, came to power, although it did not campaign for a republic during the election, instead favouring remaining in the Commonwealth, thereby appealing to Afrikaners who otherwise might have voted for the United Party of Jan Smuts. Malan&#x27;s successor as Prime Minister, J. G. Strijdom, also downplayed the republic issue, stating that no steps would be taken towards that end before 1958. Strijdom stated that the matter of whether South Africa would be a republic inside or outside the Commonwealth would be decided &quot;with a view to circumstances then prevailing&quot;. Like his precessor, Strijdom declared the party&#x27;s belief that a republic could only be proclaimed on the basis &quot;of the broad will of the people&quot;.

===Referendum and abolition===

On becoming Prime Minister in 1958, Hendrik Verwoerd gave a speech to Parliament in which he declared: &quot;We stand unequivocally and clearly for the establishment of the republic in the correct manner and at the appropriate time&quot;. In 1960, Verwoerd announced plans to hold a whites-only referendum on the establishment of a republic, with a bill to that effect being introduced in Parliament on 23 April of that year. The Referendum Act received assent on 3 June 1960. In hopes of winning the support of those opposed to a republic, not only English-speaking whites but Afrikaners still supporting the United Party, Verwoerd proposed that constitutional changes would be minimal, with the Queen simply being replaced as head of state by a State President, the office of which would be a ceremonial post rather than an executive one.

In Natal, the only province with an English-speaking majority of whites, there was strong anti-republican sentiment; in 1955, the small Federal Party issued a pamphlet &quot;The Case Against the Republic&quot;, while the Anti-Republican League organised public demonstrations. The League, founded by Arthur Selby, the Federal Party&#x27;s chairman, launched the Natal Covenant in opposition to the plans for a republic, signed by 33,000 Natalians. On the day of the referendum, the &quot;Natal Witness&quot;, the province&#x27;s daily English-language newspaper warned its readers that: &quot;Not to vote against the Republic is to help those who would cut us loose from our moorings, and set us adrift in a treacherous and uncharted sea, at the very time that the winds of change are blowing up to hurricane force&quot;.

The National Party government subsequently organised the referendum on 5 October 1960. The vote, which was restricted to whites – the first such national election in the Union – was narrowly approved by 52.29% of the voters.

The Republic of South Africa was declared on 31 May 1961, Queen Elizabeth II ceased to be head of state, and the last Governor General of the Union, Charles R. Swart, took office as the first State President.

===Commonwealth membership===

Originally every independent country in the Commonwealth was a Dominion – sharing a monarch with the United Kingdom and the other dominions. The 1949 London Declaration prior to India becoming a republic allowed countries with a different head of state to join or remain in the Commonwealth, but only by unanimous consent of the other members. The governments of Pakistan (in 1956) and, later, Ghana (in 1960) availed themselves of this principle, and the National Party had not ruled out South Africa&#x27;s continued membership of the Commonwealth were there a vote in favour of a republic.

However, the Commonwealth by 1960 included new Asian and African members, whose rulers saw the apartheid state&#x27;s membership as an affront to the organisation&#x27;s new democratic principles. Julius Nyerere, then Chief Minister of Tanganyika, indicated that his country, which was due to gain independence in 1961, would not join the Commonwealth were apartheid South Africa to remain a member. A Commonwealth Prime Ministers&#x27; Conference was convened in March 1961, a year ahead of schedule, to address the issue. In response, Verwoerd stirred up a confrontation, causing many members to threaten to withdraw if South Africa&#x27;s renewal of membership application was accepted. As a result, South Africa&#x27;s membership application was withdrawn, meaning that upon its becoming a republic on 31 May 1961, the country&#x27;s Commonwealth membership simply lapsed.

Following the end of apartheid, South Africa rejoined the Commonwealth in 1994, thirty-three years and one day the republic was established.

<text>The Vienna U-Bahn (), where &quot;U-Bahn&quot; is an abbreviation of the German word &quot;Untergrundbahn&quot; (), is a rapid transit system serving Vienna, Austria. The five-line network consists of of route, serving 109 stations. 459.8 million passengers rode the U-Bahn in 2019.

The modern-day U-Bahn opened on 25 February 1978, after test operations that began on 8 May 1976. Parts of two of the lines, designated U4 and U6, date back to the &quot;Stadtbahn&quot; (&quot;city railway&quot;) system, which opened in 1898. Parts of the U2 and U6 lines began as subway tunnels built to accommodate earlier tram lines. Only the U1 and U3 were built wholly as new subway lines.

Lines are designated by a number and the prefix &quot;U&quot; (for U-Bahn) and identified on station signage and related literature by a colour. There are five lines; U1, U2, U3, U4 and U6. Since the late 1960s there have been numerous suggestions of routings for a line U5, but all these projects had been shelved until the construction of a new U5 was announced in early 2014. Stations are often named after streets, public spaces, or districts, and in some special cases after prominent buildings at or near the station. The policy of the Wiener Linien, however, states that they prefer not to name stations after buildings.

Ticketing for the network is integrated under the (VOR) along with other means of public transport in Vienna, including trams and buses. Local tickets are valid on S-Bahn suburban rail services and other train services but those are operated by the state railway operator, ÖBB. Tickets are not valid on bus services operated by Vienna Airport Lines or the City Airport Train express train.

== U-Bahn network ==
With the September 2017 opening of the , five-station extension of the U1 line, the five-line U-Bahn network consists of of route, serving 109 stations. Further extensions of the Vienna U-Bahn are scheduled to be completed in the 2026-2032, finally creating the missing line U5. Upon completion of the U5 and U2 projects, there will then be a network that is long with 116 stations. Some plans have been proposed for the system beyond 2032, when the U2/U5 project is completed, although such plans are currently unfunded.

U-Bahn services run between 05:00 and around 01:00 at intervals between two and five minutes during the day and up to eight minutes after 20:00. Since 4 September 2010, there has been 24-hour service operating at 15-minute intervals on Friday and Saturday evenings, and on evenings prior to a public holiday. The 24-hour U-Bahn is supplemented on these nights by the Vienna NightLine bus service.

===Map===
=== Metropolitan railway and underground trams===

The stretch between Heiligenstadt and Hütteldorf, covering modern day U4, used to be part of the metropolitan railway (Stadtbahn). The stretch between Längenfeldgasse and Spittelau, covering most of U6, also used to be a part, although Spittelau wasn&#x27;t a station yet. The stretch between Karlsplatz and Schottenring (covering some of U2, and in the future some of it will cover a section of U5) was part of an underground tram network (U-Straßenbahn).

==History and projected expansions==
Planning for an underground railway in Vienna can be traced back to the 1840s. Since then, there have been numerous plans and concessions to build such a project, making Vienna the city with the most subway planning.

The concession request of the engineer Heinrich Sichrowsky dates from 1844 with the idea of a pneumatic, or atmospheric, railway based on the system of Medhurst and Clegg. The trains would have been advanced pneumatically by stationary steam engine air pumps. Sichrowsky’s route would have led from Lobkowitzplatz, below the Vienna Glacis, and along the Wien River to Hütteldorf. Although such trains had been built in London and Paris, it found in Vienna no investors for its stock company, so this idea was rejected. The connecting railway project of Julius Pollak (1849) was also conceived as an atmospheric system. Sichrowsky&#x27;s request was the starting point for a series of plans that were mostly not approved and could not be implemented. For example, in 1858 the city planner Ludwig Zettl proposed to make an overburden of the former moat instead of filling it, and then to set up a railroad tram in this enclosed ditch, which would bypass the city. This would have created a connection between the central station and the market halls, while at the same time the gas-lit tunnels were to serve as warehouses for food. By 1873, at least 25 plans for a municipal railway system came up, with only the Verbindungsbahn, which already appeared in the much larger overall plan by Carl Ritter von Ghega in his project for Vienna&#x27;s urban expansion of 1858, being later implemented as part of the mainline railway line. Ghega had already worked out a belt railway project along the line wall in 1845. The first planning for a subway in deep-seated tunnels by Emil Winkler dates back to 1873, with planning proposals that were also based on the first systematic traffic census in Vienna.

Another wave of public transport projects were developed as the ring road was close to be finished. The conception of the British engineers James Bunton and Joseph Fogerty won out, since their plans, approved in 1881, included trains to be run in tunnels, in open incisions, and on elevated tracks.

In 1883, the project of an &quot;electric secondary railway&quot; of the company Siemens &amp; Halske planned for a small profile rail system with three lines. The construction failed due to the concern of the city council that inner city business life could be affected, especially since the project for the first time ever included a tunneling of the city center.

The first system to be constructed was a four-line Stadtbahn railway network (which had been planned to have three main and three local lines) using steam trains. Ground was broken in 1892, and the system was opened in stages between 11 May 1898 and 6 August 1901. At Hütteldorf, the Stadtbahn connected to railway service to the west, and at Heiligenstadt, to railway service on the Franz Josef Line, which then ran northwestwards within the Austro-Hungarian Empire to Eger. Some of the &quot;Jugendstil&quot; stations for this system designed by Otto Wagner are still in use. However, the Stadtbahn proved inadequate for mass transport, less successful than the tramway. Starting in 1910, plans were considered for an underground system, but were interrupted by the First World War, which also necessitated closing the Stadtbahn to civilian use. After the war, the economic situation of a smaller and poorer country ruled out continuing with the plan. However, starting on 26 May 1924 the Stadtbahn was electrified, something that many had called for before the war, and from autumn 1925 it was integrated with the tramway rather than the railways. The frequency of trains tripled. Plans for a U-Bahn dating to 1912–14 were revived and discussions took place in 1929, but the Great Depression again necessitated abandoning planning.

Both in 1937 and after the &quot;Anschluß&quot;, when Vienna became the largest city by surface area in Nazi Germany, ambitious plans for a U-Bahn, and a new central railway station, were discussed. Test tunnelling took place, but these plans, too, had to be shelved when the Second World War broke out.

Severe war damage caused the Stadtbahn system to be suspended in some areas until 27 May 1945. The redevelopment of stations took until the 1950s. Meanwhile, Vienna was occupied by the four allied powers until 1955, and in 1946 had returned three quarters of the pre-war expanded Greater Vienna to the state of Lower Austria. Two proposals for U-Bahn systems were nonetheless presented, in 1953 and 1954. Increasing car traffic led to cutbacks in the S-Bahn network that were partially made up for by buses. The U-Bahn issue was also politicised: in the 1954 and 1959 city council elections, the conservative Austrian People&#x27;s Party championed construction of a U-Bahn, but the more powerful Social Democratic Party of Austria campaigned for putting housing first. The city council repeatedly rejected the U-Bahn idea in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

Extensions of the Stadtbahn system had always been discussed as an alternative to building a new U-Bahn. But it was not until the late 1960s, when the Stadtbahn and the Schnellbahn were no longer able to adequately serve the ever-increasing public traffic, that the decision to build a new network was taken. On 26 January 1968, the city council voted to begin construction of a basic network (&quot;Grundnetz&quot;). Construction began on 3 November 1969 on and under Karlsplatz, where three lines of the basic network were to meet, and where central control of the U-Bahn was located. Test operation began on 8 May 1976 on line U4, and the first newly constructed (underground) stretch of line opened on 25 February 1978 (five stations on U1 between Reumannplatz and Karlsplatz).

The construction of the Vienna U-Bahn network can be divided into several stages:

=== Initial construction (1969–1982): Basic network (&quot;Grundnetz&quot;) ===
First, the basic network (&quot;Grundnetz&quot;) was chosen from the various network designs. During 1967, plans for the U2 were radically reduced and the U3 completely deleted, and the approved basic network was described as a &#x27;closer basic network&#x27;. This closer basic network, consisting of the U1, U2 and U4 lines, included:

* New route between Reumannplatz and Praterstern
* U2 between Karlsplatz and Schottenring
* U4 between Hütteldorf and Heiligenstadt, consisting almost entirely of modification and adaptation of the existing Stadtbahn line

Construction began on 3 November 1969. On 25 February 1978, the first Vienna U-Bahn route between Karlsplatz and Reumannplatz, the U1, went into operation. With twelve partial commissionings, the Vienna U-Bahn basic network was completed on 3 September 1982.

=== Missing U5 ===
Placeholder line numbers were awarded during initial planning of the Vienna subway network between 1966 and 1973. The designation U5 was used in initial and later plans, but ultimately none of the segments with its numeration were approved for construction. In early expansion variant plans, the U5 would have run between Meidlinger Hauptstraße and St. Marx using the already partially-tunneled southern belt route. It later referred to the current branch of the line U2 from Schottenring to the stadium, which was planned to connect to a new segment to Hernals. , there is no U5 line; today&#x27;s U2 line consists of parts of the previously planned U2 and U5, which are connected by an arc between the stations Rathaus and Schottentor (this was originally planned only as an operating track and is still the narrowest curve in the Vienna subway network). The designation U3 was for a long time a gap in the network, but there was already in the construction of the basic network preliminary work. Thus, the entire tunnel tube of the U3 between Naglergasse / Graben and Stubentor was completed during construction of the U1 (at Stephansplatz), in order to avoid further excavation work in the area of the cathedral.

Since 2003, several plans and internal working papers of Vienna have again been planning long-term plans for a U5 line, but only in early 2014 did they again make concrete efforts to actually realize the line. Finally, in March 2014, it was announced that the U5 line would be constructed in several stages of development as part of a U2 / U5 line cross.

Starting at Karlsplatz, the new line will use the existing U2 section, with a new section to be built from Rathaus station northwards. In the first expansion step, however, the line will be run until 2023, for the time being, only up to one stop on Frankhplatz in the area of the old AKH. The further construction in the 17th district is planned; However, the construction costs must first be negotiated with the federal government. (See: Fifth stage of the subway network).

The current U2 will then continue southwards in newly built tunnels: From Rathaus, it will connect with the U3 at Neubaugasse and the U4 at Pilgramgasse, continuing further south and connecting with the S-Bahn network at Matzleinsdorfer Platz. The financial resources for the construction come from the previously planned, but abandoned, southern extension of the U2 towards Gudrunstraße. The already approved expenditures by the federal government have not expired and could therefore be spent on these revised expansion plans.

=== Proposed U7 ===
In some designs also a line U7 was provided, which should connect the Floridsdorf and Donaustadt districts Floridsdorf station, Kagran and Aspern east of the Danube running. However, due to insufficient urbanization, this project was not found to be meaningful and was never planned, as it would be possible to transport almost the same number of people by means of a much cheaper tram line, which is the replacement of tram line 26 east of Wagramer Straße, from there to the Ziegelhofstraße six stops further on its own track body, by the Gewerbepark Stadlau to the subway station Hausfeldstraße on the northern edge of Aspern was also reached.

=== Second expansion phase (1982–2000): Lines U3 and U6 ===

The second phase involved the expansion of the U3 and U6 lines (about ). The groundbreaking ceremony for this phase took place on 7 September 1983 on Pottendsdorfer Street at the Philadelphia Bridge and after six years, the central section of the U6 between Philadelphia Bridge and Heligenstadt/Friedensbrücke went into operation.

After completion of the basic network, the Vienna subway system was extended in 1989 to the line U6 with the route Heiligenstadt-Philadelphiabrücke (). For the belt line, the last remaining line of the light rail, had been modernized and converted to legal traffic. In order to preserve the valuable building fabric, the line was not rebuilt for operation with the underground railcars of the other lines; tram or metro-like trains with overhead power lines were used. Northern line endpoint was now only Heiligenstadt; the alternative northern terminus of the last light rail line, Friedensbrücke (U4), was not approached. 1995 followed the first extension of this line in the south: from Philadelphiabrücke (now station Meidling) to Siebenhirten including the elevated railway line of the former express tram line 64 over a length of . In 1996, the U6 was extended in the north to Floridsdorf and the previous terminus Heiligenstadt (U4) is no longer approached. The two remaining, abandoned links of the former light rail are like much of the U6 listed building and are now partly used as a bike path.

In 1991, the completely newly built line U3 between Erdberg and Volkstheater was opened, which crosses the first district after the U1 as a second line. The western terminus Ottakring was reached in 1998, the southeastern end of the U3 is since the year 2000 in the station Simmering. The total length of the network increased with these construction measures of the second stage to .

=== Third expansion phase (2001–2010): The first extensions of U1 and U2 ===

In 1996, a new U-Bahn contract, known as the &quot;30 billion package&quot;, was settled. For the first time in Europe, a U-Bahn project had to undergo a costly and lengthy environmental impact assessment, as the U2 extension showed a length of more than ). This expansion phase involved:

====U1 extension to Leopoldau====
On 19 October 2001, the groundbreaking ceremony for the extension of U1 was held, for which the two districts had been waiting for 20 years. After five years of construction, the long extension of the U1 was opened on 2 September 2006.

====U2 extension from Schottenring to Stadium====
On 12 June 2003, the groundbreaking ceremony took place outside the Stadion (stadium). Because of the 2008 European Football Championships in Austria, there was enormous pressure to complete the construction on time. The Wiener Linien met the deadline, and on 10 May 2008 the U2 extension to the stadium was opened.

====U2 extension from Stadium to Aspern====
On 2 October 2010, a further six stations were opened taking the U2 across the Danube via Donaustadtbrücke to Aspernstraße in the twenty-second district (Donaustadt). An additional , three-station extension of the U2 to Aspern Seestadt was officially opened on 5 October 2013.

=== Fourth expansion phase (since 2010): Further extension of the Vienna U-Bahn ===
Planning for a fourth U-Bahn expansion phase began in 2001 and concrete ideas were put forth in the 2003 Transport Master Plan. In 2007, there are plans for the extensions in Vienna, this provided the necessary extensions:
*The extended U2 from Aspernstraße to Seestadt Aspern (then time horizon 2013)
*The extended U1 from Reumannplatz to Rothneusiedl (then time horizon 2015)
*The extended U2 from Karlsplatz to Gudrunstraße (then time horizon 2019)

====2012 package====
In March 2012, it was officially announced that the southern branch of U1 would instead be extended to Oberlaa and not the originally planned Rothneusiedl. This was achieved by expanding the pre-existing route of tram line 67. The change to the original plans was thought to be due cost issues or the incomplete development of the area surrounding Rothneusiedl. This extension was ultimately opened to the public on 2 September 2017, thereby expanding the Vienna metro network by and 5 stations. In the area of the station Alaudagasse preparations for a future line bifurcation were made, should the further development in Rothneusiedl warrant a branch line there.

====2014 package====
The originally planned southern extension of U2 to Gudrunstraße indefinitely delayed for financial reasons and since the need suggested is no longer there. With the budgeted funds, the so-called line cross U2 / U5 will be created instead. The line U2 coming from Seestadt and Schottentor will receive a new south branch, leading to the S-Bahn station Matzleinsdorfer Platz. The remaining route of the U2 between Karlsplatz and Universitätsstraße will be taken over by a newly created U5 line, which will be supplemented by the station Frankhplatz (Altes AKH) for the time being. This line should also lead a fully automatic operation, as currently used at the Nuremberg U-Bahn. The U5 line will be Vienna&#x27;s first driverless U-Bahn line. Start of construction for the resulting crossroads is scheduled for 2018, 2024 (U5), and 2026 (U2) respectively.

=== Fifth expansion phase: Extension of U2 and U5 ===

It is planned to extend the U2 line from Matzleinsdorfer Platz to Wienerberg and to extend the U5 from Frankhplatz to Hernals. One further possibility is to build a second southern branch of the U1, which would terminate in Rothneusiedl.

=== Further expansion options ===

Other possible expansion options are:
* Expanding the U5 beyond Hernals to Dornbach
* Expanding the U5 beyond Karlsplatz as was planned in the 4th expansion phase for the U2

===Timeline===

==Rolling stock ==
The Vienna U-Bahn has three types of rolling stock, and has permanent way equipment. The U1, U2, U3, and U4 have two types of rolling stock: the older U/U1/U2 type (introduced in 1972) and the newer V type (introduced in 2002). The U6 has one class of train, the T/T1 type (introduced in 1993), the older E6/C6 having been retired in 2008 and now mostly operating in Utrecht in the Netherlands and Kraków in Poland, with a single set being preserved at Vienna&#x27;s tramway museum (&quot;Remise&quot;).

=== U1-U4 ===

==== U/U11/U2 class ====

The first cars of the Type U, developed by Simmering-Graz-Pauker (SGP), were delivered in 1972. The smallest unit is a two-axle motorcar, 36.8 meters (120 ft 9 in) long and 2.8 meters (9 ft 2 in) wide, forming a permanently coupled twin railcar. A train is made up of three double railcars. By 2008, short-haul trains with two double railcars were used during off-peak times or on the U2 line. Technically, the cars are very similar to the Munich and Nuremberg subway trains. However, there are significant differences in their award-winning design. By 1982, a total of 135 double railcars of Type U had been delivered, but they have since been retired.

Starting in 1987, SGP supplied the Type U1 (later referred to as U11), a second generation that outwardly resembles its predecessor. However, the technical equipment was further developed and includes water-cooled three-phase motors, brakes with energy recovery, and modernized emergency braking and safety equipment. Between 2000 and 2010, trains from the later Type U series were rebuilt and equipped with new three-phase motors, extending their service life by another 20 years. The converted trains are called Type U2 and operate on lines U2 and U3.

The interior of a car consists of eight pairs of vis-à-vis seats in the middle section, nine seats at the driverless end, and two pairs of seats opposite each other at the opposite end of the car. In 2006, the U1 and U2 trains were upgraded with LED displays, replacing the original illuminated telltale displays. Additionally, the trains are gradually being retrofitted with plastic seats, video surveillance, and warning lights to signal door closures. No such conversions are being made for Type U vehicles, as they are being phased out. An individual railcar has 49 seats and space for 91 standing passengers. A train consisting of three double railcars provides 294 seats and standing room for 546 passengers. The maximum speed is 80 km/h (50 mph). The &quot;Silver Arrows&quot; design was created by railway designer Johann Benda.

==== Type V ====
In the late 1990s, a consortium of companies—Siemens, ELIN, and Adtranz—developed a new train called Type V, or &quot;V-Car.&quot; It is a continuous, permanently coupled six-car train consisting of two non-motorized control cars and four motorized intermediate cars. This configuration corresponds to the length of three double railcars from the Ux-type family.

After a prototype was primarily used on the U3 line from December 2000, 25 sets were ordered in June 2002, followed by another 15 trains of this type in December 2007. The first of these sets were delivered starting in February 2005 and, after several delays, received their operating license in mid-August 2006. At the end of September 2009, another 20 vehicles were ordered.

Compared to the prototype, the production models featured an updated interior design. The sidewalls were changed from white to gray, and the originally installed fabric seats were replaced with red plastic seats. The newer Type V trains also have yellow handrails instead of gray-red ones, improved interior displays, and warning lights to indicate door closures. Each car contains eight pairs of vis-à-vis seats in the middle section and six seats at each transition between cars. At both ends of the train, there are multipurpose compartments with four folding seats each, as well as automatically extending ramps at every station to close the platform gap. These trains were the first in the Vienna subway system to be equipped with air conditioning and factory-installed video surveillance.

To minimize station dwell time and prevent obstructions by passengers, the doors use sensitive sensor edges as anti-trap mechanisms instead of light barriers. Once a door is individually opened, it will only close again as part of a centralized closing operation. All doors can also be opened simultaneously from the driver&#x27;s seat.

The trains are equipped with extensive safety technology, including fire detectors in the roof areas, temperature sensors, and dry extinguishing pipes on the undercarriage. Any smoke detection or excessive temperature readings are immediately transmitted to the driver. The Type V trains provide 260 seats and space for 618 standing passengers. Their top speed is 80 km/h (50 mph). The exterior design was developed by Porsche Design.

A similar variant of this type, known as OS MX3000, is also in service in Oslo, Norway.

=== Type X ===
Siemens was contracted in September 2017 to deliver and maintain 34 six-car Type X trains. The order includes an option for an additional eleven trains. The vehicles are designed for both fully automated and driver-operated service. The first trains arrived in the spring of 2020, the final trains are scheduled for delivery by the end of 2030. The first train entered service on 16 June 2023. They currently operate on all lines bar the U6, and will be used for the upcoming U5.

===Line U6===
The Line U6 was originally slated for rapid transit conversion like the U4. However, taking into account historic preservation of original Vienna Stadtbahn stations and structures, construction costs and disruption of existing services, decided to keep Line U6 with much of its original operations. Today Line U6 is unique when compared to other U-Bahn lines with overhead lines, low floor LRVs and optical signals (no LZB).
==== T-Class ====
Since 1993, Bombardier Wien has been developing 2.65-meter (8 ft 8 in) wide, double-articulated low-floor vehicles of the Type T. These vehicles are similar to the Type 400 used on the Badner Bahn and serve as the basis for the successful Flexity Swift vehicle family. A set consists of three permanently coupled cars, and a full train comprises four sets. By 2008, shorter trains consisting of three sets also operated during off-peak hours. Initially, the Type T cars operated in conjunction with older E6/c6 cars, ensuring that each train included at least one low-floor car. Today, however, only trains composed entirely of Type T and T1 cars are in service. Each train has 232 seats and standing room for 544 passengers.

A further development of the Type T, known as the Type T1, has been in use since May 2008. These vehicles feature air conditioning, video surveillance, and electronic interior and exterior displays, along with an updated design. The Type T1 replaced the older E6/c6 high-floor cars. Since 24 December 2008, only Type T and T1 vehicles have been in operation on the U6 line.

The Type T and T1 cars can be coupled together, allowing mixed operation.

At the end of 2009, Type T cars began receiving upgrades, including electronic interior and exterior displays and video surveillance to enhance passenger and staff safety while reducing vandalism. Additionally, the older cloth seats in the Type T cars have gradually been replaced by red plastic seats with yellow handles, similar to those found in Type T1 and Type V cars. Vehicles of the T-type family have been equipped with warning lights to indicate door closures.

For transport via the tram network, Type T cars are equipped for tram operation.

===Former Trains===
From the light rail operation, the 2.3-meter (7 ft 7 in) wide, six-axle articulated Type E6 railcars and Type c6 sidecars, known as the &quot;Mannheim type,&quot; were adopted. These vehicles were built in 1979 by Lohner and Rotax under a Düwag license. A full train provided 192 seats and 432 standing places. Until the end of 2008, these trains still operated in conjunction with Type T cars in the formation E6 + c6 + T + c6 + E6. In May 2008, delivery of the Type T1 cars began, intended to fully replace the E6/c6 trains. On 23 December 2008, the E6/c6 cars made their final run on the U6 line.

Most of the vehicles were sold to Utrecht or Kraków. A train consisting of a railcar and a sidecar has been preserved at the Remise Museum. The E6 and c6 vehicles previously in Utrecht were later sold to Kraków in 2014.

==Art==

In common with many urban transit systems, the Vienna U-Bahn has art works in stations. These include:

* Altes Landgut: &quot;Face Surveillance Snails&quot; by Yves Netzhammer.
* Aspern Nord: &quot;Aspern Affairs&quot;, two big artistic maps of Vienna at the end of the platform, one showing the situation in 1809 during the Napoleonic Wars and one of 1912, where the airport in Aspern (at the time the biggest airport in Europe) can be seen. Also there are colored &quot;lifelines&quot; above the tracks that show the names of famous people, and the dates of their birth and death. The artworks were created by Stephan Huber.

<text>A songline, also called dreaming track, is one of the paths across the land (or sometimes the sky) within the animist belief systems of the Aboriginal cultures of Australia. They mark the route followed by localised &quot;creator-beings&quot; in the Dreaming. These routes serve as crucial connections between individuals and their ancestral lands, carrying intricate geographical, mythological, and cultural information.

At its core, a songline functions as both a navigational aid and a repository of cultural knowledge. Embedded within traditional song cycles, dance rituals, stories, and artistic expressions, these pathways enable individuals to traverse vast distances while reciting the songs that describe landmarks, water sources, and natural features. Notably, the melodic contours and rhythmic nuances of the songs transcend linguistic barriers, facilitating cross-cultural understanding as different language groups interact and share the essence of these ancient narratives.

A unique facet of songlines lies in their role as cultural passports, denoting respect and recognition for specific regions and their inhabitants when the songs are sung in the appropriate languages. This intricate network of songlines interconnects neighbouring groups, fostering social interactions based on shared beliefs and obligations. The perpetuation of songlines through generations sustains a spiritual connection to the land, underscoring the concept of &quot;connection to country,&quot; wherein the intricate relationship between individuals and their ancestral lands forms a cornerstone of Aboriginal identity and cultural preservation.

==Description==
The Dreaming, or the Dreamtime, has been described as &quot;a sacred narrative of Creation that is seen as a continuous process that links Aboriginal people to their origins&quot;. Ancestors are believed to play a large role in the establishment of sacred sites as they traversed the continent long ago. Animals were created in the Dreaming, and also played a part in creation of the lands and heavenly bodies. Songlines connect places and Creation events, and the ceremonies associated with those places. Oral history about places and the journeys are carried in song cycles, and each Aboriginal person has obligations to their birthplace. The songs become the basis of the ceremonies that are enacted in those specific places along the songlines.

A songline has been called a &quot;dreaming track&quot;, as it marks a route across the land or sky followed by one of the creator-beings or ancestors in the Dreaming.

A knowledgeable person is able to navigate across the land by repeating the words of the song, which describe the location of landmarks, waterholes, and other natural phenomena. In some cases, the paths of the creator-beings are said to be evident from their marks, or petrosomatoglyphs, on the land, such as large depressions in the land which are said to be their footprints.

By singing the songs in the appropriate sequence, Aboriginal people could navigate vast distances, often travelling through the deserts of Australia&#x27;s interior. The continent of Australia contains an extensive system of songlines, some of which are of a few kilometres, whilst others traverse hundreds of kilometres through lands of many different Aboriginal peoples — peoples who may speak markedly different languages and have different cultural traditions. One songline marks a route connecting the Central Desert Region with the east coast, to the place now called Byron Bay. Desert peoples travelled to the ocean to observe fishing practices, and coastal people travelled inland to sacred sites such as Uluru and Kata Tjuta.

Since a songline can span the lands of several different language groups, different parts of the song are said to be in those different languages. Languages are not a barrier because the melodic contour of the song describes the nature of the land over which the song passes. The rhythm is what is crucial to understanding the song. Listening to the song of the land is the same as walking on this songline and observing the land. Songlines have been described as a &quot;cultural passport&quot; which, when sung in the language of a particular region and mob, show respect to the people of that country.

Neighbouring groups are connected because the song cycles criss-cross all over the continent. All Aboriginal groups traditionally share beliefs in the ancestors and related laws; people from different groups interacted with each other based on their obligations along the songlines. 
In some cases, a songline has a particular direction, and walking the wrong way along a songline may be a sacrilegious act (e.g. climbing up Uluru where the correct direction is down). Aboriginal people regard all land as sacred, and the songs must be continually sung to keep the land &quot;alive&quot;. Their &quot;connection to country&quot; describes a strong and complex relationship with the land of their ancestors, or &quot;mob&quot;. Aboriginal identity often links to their language groups and traditional country of their ancestors. Songlines not only map routes across the continent and pass on culture, but also express connectedness to country.

Songlines are often passed down in families, passing on important knowledge and cultural values.

Molyneaux and Vitebsky note that the Dreaming Spirits &quot;also deposited the spirits of unborn children and determined the forms of human society&quot;, thereby establishing tribal law and totemic paradigms.

==Descriptions and definitions==
Anthropologist Robert Tonkinson described Mardu songlines in his 1978 monograph &quot;The Mardudjara Aborigines - Living The Dream In Australia&#x27;s Desert&quot;.

In his 1987 book &quot;The Songlines&quot;, British novelist and travel writer Bruce Chatwin describes the songlines as:
Margo Ngawa Neale, senior Indigenous art and history curator at the National Museum of Australia, says:

==Examples==
* The Yolngu people of Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory tell the story of Barnumbirr, a creator-being associated with the planet Venus, who came from the island of Baralku in the East, guiding the first humans to Australia, and then flew across the land from East to West, naming and creating the animals, plants, and natural features of the land.
* The Yarralin people of the Victoria River Valley venerate the spirit Walujapi as the Dreaming Spirit of the black-headed python. Walujapi is said to have carved a snakelike track along a cliff-face and deposited an impression of her buttocks when she sat establishing camp. Both signs are currently discernible.
* The Native Cat Dreaming Spirits who are said to have commenced their journey at the sea and to have moved north into the Simpson Desert, traversing as they did so the lands of the Aranda, Kaititja, Ngalia, Kukatja and Unmatjera. Each people sing the part of the Native Cat Dreaming relating to the songlines for which they are bound in a territorial relationship of reciprocity.
* In the Sydney region, because of the soft Sydney sandstone, valleys often end in a canyon or cliff, and so travelling along the ridge lines was much easier than travelling in the valleys. Thus, the songlines tend to follow the ridge lines, and this is also where much of the sacred art, such as the Sydney Rock Engravings, is located. In contrast, in many other parts of Australia, the songlines tend to follow valleys, where water may be found more easily.
* Songlines have been linked to Aboriginal art sites in the Wollemi National Park in New South Wales.

<doc id="1167332" wikidata="Q1201819" url="?curid=1167332" title="Northern Court">
<text>The , also known as the Ashikaga Pretenders or Northern Pretenders, were a set of six pretenders to the throne of Japan during the Nanboku-chō period from 1336 through 1392. The present Imperial House of Japan is descended from the Northern Court emperors.

The Northern dynasty is also referred to as the &quot;senior line&quot; or the ; Jimyō-in was a temple and retirement residence of this line&#x27;s emperors Go-Fukakusa and Fushimi.

==Nanboku-chō overview==
The origins of the Northern Court go back to Emperor Go-Saga, who reigned from 1242 through 1246. Go-Saga was succeeded in turn by two of his sons, Emperor Go-Fukakusa and Emperor Kameyama. On his death bed in 1272, Go-Saga insisted that his sons adopt a plan in which future emperors from the two fraternal lines would ascend the throne in alternating succession. This plan proved to be unworkable, resulting in rival factions and rival claimants to the throne.

In 1333, when the Southern Emperor Go-Daigo staged the Kenmu Restoration and revolted against the Hōjō Kamakura shogunate, the newly minted &quot;shōgun&quot; Ashikaga Takauji (ironically, by Emperor Go-Daigo himself) responded by declaring Emperor Kōgon, Go-Daigo&#x27;s second cousin once removed and the son of an earlier emperor, Emperor Go-Fushimi of the Jimyōin-tō, as the new emperor. After the destruction of the Kamakura shogunate in 1333, Kōgon lost his claim, but his brother, Emperor Kōmyō, and two of his sons were supported by the new Ashikaga &quot;shōguns&quot; as the rightful claimants to the throne. Kōgon&#x27;s family thus formed an alternate Imperial Court in Kyoto, which came to be called the Northern Court because its seat was in a location north of its rival. Cloistered Emperor Go-Daigo failed to control succession to the Imperial throne, whereby the Ashikaga &quot;shōguns&quot; were able to wrestle any remaining power away from position of Emperor. &quot;Shōguns&quot; ruled Japan until 1867.

==Southern Court==
The Imperial Court supported by the Ashikaga shoguns was rivaled by the Southern Court of Go-Daigo and his descendants. This came to be called the Southern Court because its seat was in a location south of its rival. Although the precise location of the emperors&#x27; seat did change, it was often identified as simply Yoshino. In 1392, Emperor Go-Kameyama of the Southern Court was defeated and abdicated in favor of Kōgon&#x27;s great-grandson, Emperor Go-Komatsu, thus ending the divide.

The Northern Court was under the power of the Ashikaga shoguns and had little real independence. Partly because of this, since the 19th century, the Emperors of the Southern Imperial Court have been considered the legitimate Emperors of Japan. Moreover, the Southern Court controlled the Japanese imperial regalia. The Northern Court members are not considered legitimate Japanese emperors. They are called &quot;Northern Court Emperors&quot; now.

One Southern Court descendant, Kumazawa Hiromichi, declared himself to be Japan&#x27;s rightful emperor in the days after the end of the Pacific War. He claimed that Emperor Hirohito was a fraud, arguing that Hirohito&#x27;s entire line is descended from the Northern Court. Despite this, he was not arrested for lèse majesté, even when donning the Imperial Crest. He could and did produce a koseki detailing his bloodline back to Emperor Go-Daigo in Yoshino, but his claims and rhetoric failed to inspire anything other than sympathy.

==Re-unification of Imperial courts==
Go-Kameyama reached an agreement with Go-Komatsu to return to the old alternations on a ten-year plan. However, Go-Komatsu broke this promise, not only ruling for 20 years, but being succeeded by his own son, rather than by one from the former Southern Court.

During the Meiji period, an Imperial decree dated March 3, 1911, established that the legitimate reigning monarchs of this period were the direct descendants of Emperor Go-Daigo through Emperor Go-Murakami, whose Southern Court had been established in exile in Yoshino, near Nara.

<text>Soap Opera Update was a magazine dedicated to the coverage of soap operas, co-founded by Angela Shapiro in 1988. The magazine was published every three weeks. It was purchased by Bauer Media Group in 1992. The magazine became popular on newsstands in the mid-1990s. However, due to a lack of subscriptions and promotion, and criticisms for mediocre content and &quot;lazy&quot; press coverage, the magazine was discontinued in late 2002. In 2006, the &quot;Update&quot; began issuing &quot;Soaps In Depth&quot; and releasing an annual issue to review the soaps of the past year and preview soaps for the new year.

This magazine also produced the Soap Opera Update Awards, similar to the Soap Opera Digest Awards.

<doc id="1167364" wikidata="Q1384657" url="?curid=1167364" title="Introduce Yourself">
<text>Introduce Yourself is the second studio album by American rock band Faith No More, released in 1987. Due to the limited availability of the first album, &quot;We Care a Lot&quot; (until it was re-released on CD years later), many, including the band, once considered this Faith No More&#x27;s true debut album. Being the group&#x27;s major label debut, this album features better production than its predecessor, which is most evident on this album&#x27;s version of the song &quot;We Care a Lot,&quot; which also features updated, more topical, lyrics. It is the final album to feature vocalist Chuck Mosley before he was fired from Faith No More in 1988.

==Background==
Faith No More&#x27;s debut album &quot;We Care a Lot&quot; was released in 1985 through independent label Mordam Records. In late 1986, Faith No More was signed to Los Angeles label Slash Records by Anna Statman. The label had entered a distribution deal with Warner Bros. Records in 1982, ensuring a widespread release, distribution and marketing for the band&#x27;s forthcoming album.

&quot;We Care a Lot&quot; and &quot;Chinese Arithmetic&quot; were released as radio singles in the fall of 1987, in promotion of the band&#x27;s tour with Red Hot Chili Peppers. Music videos were later made for the songs &quot;We Care a Lot&quot; (released in January 1988) and &quot;Anne&#x27;s Song&quot; released (released in May 1988).

===Songs===
The title track was originally called &quot;The Cheerleader Song&quot;. It was written on Faith No More&#x27;s first nationwide tour of the United States in 1986, as they were on their way from South Dakota to Portland, Oregon, and driving through Missoula, Montana. Keyboardist Roddy Bottum became inspired to write the song when the band went to a truck stop for coffee. He came up with the lyrics on the next leg of the journey, while sitting in the passenger seat of the band&#x27;s Dodge.

Regarding the song &quot;Death March&quot;, singer Chuck Mosley said in 1988, &quot;A friend of mine, doing a lot of drugs, just went out in the ocean and drowned. I used to be on the beach all the time and I got the feeling that he was so fucked up when he drowned that he doesn&#x27;t even realise he&#x27;s dead. He&#x27;s out there, still swimming around. &#x27;Death March&#x27; is someone talking to their dead lover, the soul lingering on.&quot;

Unlike with the band&#x27;s prior release &quot;We Care a Lot&quot;, much of the album has been played regularly with Mosley&#x27;s replacement, Mike Patton. However, there is only one known performance of &quot;Faster Disco&quot; with Patton on vocals, at a 1990 concert in Kaiserslautern, Germany. &quot;Anne&#x27;s Song&quot; is one of three Mosley songs to have never been sung live by Patton, with the others being &quot;Arabian Disco&quot; and &quot;New Beginnings&quot;, both from &quot;We Care a Lot&quot;.

===Touring and promotion===
After the album&#x27;s release, Faith No More joined fellow funk metal/punk band Red Hot Chili Peppers on The Uplift Mofo Party Tour. Faith No More opened for the Red Hot Chili Peppers during the first two and a half months of the North American tour. Guitarist Jim Martin recalled: &quot;We were travelling in a box van with no windows. We drove all the way to the east coast for the first show. Flea asked me if we liked to smoke weed. I said: ‘Yes’ and he said: ‘We&#x27;re going to get along just fine’. We did something like 52 dates in 56 days.&quot; The band&#x27;s future singer Mike Patton later became involved in several controversies and disputes with Anthony Kiedis, frontman of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. To further promote the album, Faith No More embarked on their first tour of the UK in 1988.

==Release history==

The album was originally released in April 1987 on vinyl and cassette. The album cover for this release is a centered ink splatter, with text to the extremes of the cover. The tape has a larger smear of the ink that looks more like a green spot. Bassist Billy Gould&#x27;s initial idea was a red splatter, but the color was then changed at the request of the record label. The second release of this album was on November 15, 1996, through Slash/Uni Records, and also featured the centered ink splatter. The last North American release of this album was on October 17, 2000, through Slash/Rhino Records; they later released &quot;This Is It: The Best of Faith No More&quot; in 2003. This version has a close-up of the ink splatter with the wording a bit further from the edges.



==Reception==

The record has garnered positive reviews from music critics, although as with the band&#x27;s previous studio effort &quot;We Care a Lot&quot;, some criticisms have been directed at vocalist Chuck Mosley. AllMusic stated that &quot;the album is consistent and interesting, with Mosley&#x27;s out-of-tune vocals being an acquired taste to most&quot;. In 1988, Neil Perry of &quot;Sounds Magazine&quot; referred to the album as &quot;a breathtaking harmonisation of molten metal guitar, deadly dance rhythms and poignant, pointed lyrics&quot;.

===Legacy===
Producer Matt Wallace claimed it was an &quot;overlooked FNM record&quot; in 2016.

&quot;Louder Sound&quot; wrote in 2020, &quot;&quot;Introduce Yourself&quot; is an irresistibly charming record [...] In the same way that Paul Di&#x27;Anno’s voice on early Iron Maiden sounds lovably rugged when contrasted with their slick later work, Chuck Mosely’s goofy, purposefully-underachieving vocals smother these songs in a huge dollop of infectious playfulness – something that Patton’s studied delivery could never quite emulate.&quot;

While Mike Patton dismissed the band&#x27;s debut &quot;We Care a Lot&quot; as &quot;bad hippie music&quot;, he has admitted to having a fondness for &quot;Introduce Yourself&quot;.

<doc id="1167367" wikidata="Q276526" url="?curid=1167367" title="Ernest, Duke of Austria">
<text>Ernest the Iron-Willed (; 1377 – 10 June 1424), a member of the House of Habsburg, ruled over the Inner Austrian duchies of Styria, Carinthia and Carniola from 1406 until his death. He was head of the Habsburg Leopoldian line from 1411.

==Biography==
Ernest was born in Bruck an der Mur in Styria, the third son of Duke Leopold III of Austria (1351–1386) and his consort Viridis Visconti (d. 1414), a daughter of Bernabò Visconti, Lord of Milan. Shortly after his birth, his father and his uncle Albert III divided the Habsburg lands by the 1379 Treaty of Neuberg: while Albert and his Albertinian descendants would rule over the Duchy of Austria proper, the Leopoldian line received the Inner Austrian states of Styria, Carinthia and Carniola with the remaining March of Istria, as well as Tyrol and the Further Austrian possessions. After Leopold&#x27;s death in the 1386 Battle of Sempach, young Ernest and his brothers William, Leopold IV and Frederick IV remained under the guardianship of their uncle Albert III. 

In 1401 Ernest accompanied King Rupert of Germany on his campaign to Italy. When their elder brother William died in 1406, the remaining three sons of Leopold III agreed about the partition of their patrimony: In the separation agreement of 1406, Ernest received Styria, Carinthia and Carniola, and jointly with his elder brother Leopold IV (the current head of the Leopoldian line) held the guardianship over their minor nephew Albert V of Austria, grandson of Duke Albert III. Tyrol and Further Austria passed to the youngest brother Frederick IV.

In 1407, however, conflicts between Leopold and Ernest resulted in a civil war that lasted until May 1409. When Leopold died without male heirs in 1411, Ernest finally became the uncontested head of the Leopoldian branch. In 1414, he became the last Duke to be enthroned according to Carantanian traditional rite at the Prince&#x27;s Stone in Carinthia, and from that time on called himself &#x27;archduke&#x27;. He was the first Habsburg to actually use this title, which had been invented by his uncle Duke Rudolf IV.

Ernest was made a member of the Order of the Dragon and of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem in 1414, however, he became bitter with the Luxembourg king Sigismund from 1412 onwards. When his brother Frederick IV, a supporter of Antipope John XXIII at the Council of Constance, was banned by the king in 1417, Ernest first attempted to gain control over Frederick&#x27;s territories himself, but then came to an agreement with him and successfully defended Tyrol against Sigismund&#x27;s pretensions. Ernest turned out to be a capable ruler of the Inner Austrian lands; his eldest son Frederick V would become sole heir of all Habsburg lines, elected King of the Romans in 1440 and crowned Holy Roman Emperor in 1452.

Ernest died at Bruck an der Mur, and was buried in the Cistercian monastery of Rein near Graz. His nickname &quot;the Iron&quot; only came into use after his death.

==Family and children==
On 14 January 1392, Ernest married his first wife, Margaret of Pomerania. She was a daughter of the Griffin duke Bogislaw V of Pomerania and his second wife, Adelheid of Brunswick-Grubenhagen. They had no children. She died in either 1407 or 1410, according to contradictory necrologies. 

On 25 January 1412, Ernest married his second wife, the Piast princess Cymburgis of Masovia. They had:
* Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor (21 September 1415 – 19 August 1493)
* Margaret of Austria (1416/17 – 12 February 1486), married on 3 June 1431 to Frederick II, Elector of Saxony
* Albert VI, Archduke of Austria (18 December 1418 – 2 December 1463)
* Alexander of Austria (died 1420)
* Rudolf of Austria (died before 1424)
* Catherine of Austria (1420 – 11 September 1493), married on 15 July 1447 to Charles I, Margrave of Baden-Baden
* Leopold of Austria (died before 1424)
* Anna of Austria (died 11 November 1429)
* Ernest of Austria (died 10 August 1432)
As the ruler of Inner Austria and founder of the older Styrian line of the Habsburgs, which, by their son, Frederick III survived the Albertinian (Austrian) and Tyrolean lines, Ernest and Cymburgis became the ancestors of all later emperors of the Habsburg monarchy.

<text>The Breitenbush River is a tributary of the North Santiam River in western Oregon in the United States. It drains a rugged, forested area of the Cascade Range east of Salem.

It descends from several short forks in the Mount Jefferson Wilderness in the high Cascades of eastern Marion County. The South Fork Breitenbush River begins at creeks flowing from Bays Lake and Russell Lake within Jefferson Park at approximately elevation and flows west-northwest, joining with other forks. The North Fork Breitenbush River begins at Breitenbush Lake (mostly on the Warm Springs Reservation) and joins with another fork which passes by Pyramid Lake. It flows west-northwest and connects with a half dozen other forks and creeks then turns west-southwest abeam Bald Butte. Several more creeks and Mink Creek and Rapidam Creek join before another fork.

The North and South forks flow west, joining east of the small community of Breitenbush. The combined stream flows generally west-southwest through the Willamette National Forest. It joins the North Santiam at Detroit. The lower of the river cut what is now an arm of Detroit Lake, formed by the Detroit Dam on the North Santiam. During the winter draw down of the reservoir, the original bed of the river is visible in its natural course.

==Geography==
As the crow flies, Ruatoria is approximately north-northeast of Gisborne, and southwest of the East Cape Lighthouse. By road it is from Gisborne, off State Highway 35. It is at the bottom of the Waiapu Valley on the banks of the Waiapu River just downstream of where the river is formed by the joining of the Mata and Tapuaeroa Rivers.

===Climate===
Precipitation is prodigiously high — the annual average precipitation total approaches . Precipitation is heavy all year-round, yet is particularly prodigious in the austral winter months from May to September. On 7 February 1973, Ruatoria had the highest ever air temperature recorded in the North Island (), the same day the nation&#x27;s highest temperature was recorded in the South Island town of Rangiora ().

==Industry==
The principal industries in the district are related to agriculture and forestry. Attempts to sink oil wells in the area in the 1920s proved unprofitable.

==History==

The original shop, bunk house and cook house in the township of Tuparoa were destroyed by fire on two occasions between 1907 and 1913. Commerce was moved inland 5 miles to the area known as The Crossroads, northeast of the present town sitting on the area of the first river plain where it drops to the present river plain where the roads went north–south and to the east. (There was a race course on land alongside the Waiapu River below The Crossroads but that was abandoned by the end of the second world war). The Crossroads too was destroyed by fire during the first world war and in 1920 the first general store and accommodation was erected by William Hayes Owen Johnston (1890–1960) on what is now Tuparoa Road. (The shop has been dismantled after his death in 1960) He is buried with his third wife in the cemetery at Mahora on the Tuparoa road just before the junction with the side road to Reparoa. (His first and second wives were of the Gerrard family of Tuparoa and are buried in the cemetery at the top of the hill on the northern side of the creek which separated the old Tuparoa settlement).

From about 1925 onwards, Ruatoria began to replace Tuparoa as the main urban centre of the East Coast district of New Zealand. The transition to Ruatoria from Tuparoa was brought about by the increased reliability of State Highway 35, which at that time ran via the main street of Ruatoria. Tuparoa was disadvantaged by unreliable road access and a lack of all weather harbour.

The Rotokautuku Bridge, connecting Ruatoria to the northern side of Waiapu River, was built in 1964. This 1964 bridge replaced the old bridge which had been built in the 1930s. The old piles were used for the new bridge, although they had to be lowered by a metre to accommodate the new bridge.

In the 1980s, Ruatoria was briefly notorious for an outbreak of arson attacks in the town, during a period of severe economic downturn.

==Significance to Māori==
The Ngāti Porou proverb of identity relates to the area — &quot;Ko Hikurangi te maunga, ko Waiapu te awa, ko Ngāti Porou te iwi&quot; (Hikurangi is the mountain, Waiapu is the river, Ngāti Porou is the tribe). Ruatoria is within the iwi&#x27;s rohe, and Te Runanganui o Ngāti Porou has offices located in the town.

The Waiapu River is of immense cultural, spiritual, economic, and traditional value to local Māori. According to traditional beliefs, a number of taniwha dwell in and protect the river, in turn protecting the valley and its hapū. Taniwha believed to be in Waiapu River include Kotuwainuku, Kotuwairangi, Ohinewaiapu, and Ngungurutehorowhatu.

According to an affidavit of Hapukuniha Te Huakore Karaka, two taniwha were placed in strategic locations in the river to protect the hapū from invading tribes — one near Paoaruku (a locality at ), and one at the Wairoa River (a small creek at ). Karaka said that a bridge was built from Tikitiki to Waiomatatini, to the protest of local Māori who were concerned that it would disturb the taniwha. The night before the bridge was completed, a storm came washing the bridge away — the weather till then had been calm. From then, one person would drown in the river nearly every year. If it did not happen one year, two would drown the next. A local tohunga, George Gage (Hori Te Kou-o-rehua Keeti) was approached to help the situation, and after that there were no similar drownings.

===Marae===

Ruatoria has several marae belonging to Ngāti Porou hapū:
* Hiruharama Marae and Kapohanga a Rangi meeting house, a meeting place of Te Aitanga a Mate and Te Aowera.

<text>Murchison is a town located on the Goulburn River in Victoria, Australia. Murchison is located 167 kilometres from Melbourne and is just to the west of the Goulburn Valley Highway between Shepparton and Nagambie. The surrounding countryside contains orchards, vineyards and dairy farms and also HM Prison Dhurringile. At the , Murchison had a population of 925.

==History==
===Pre-twentieth century===
The Ngooraialum tribe were the Aboriginal inhabitants of the area. The first explorer to enter the Goulburn Valley was Thomas Mitchell who crossed the Goulburn River at Mitchellstown. The first Europeans to visit what would become the site where the drovers Joseph Hawdon and Charles Bonney who drove cattle between Mitchellstown and Adelaide.

Squatters started settling the area in 1840 with a school being established that year and a police station in 1841. The aboriginal protectorate was also transferred from Mitchellstown to Murchison in 1840 and closed in 1850.

French vigneron Ludovic Marie settled in Murchison in 1850 and established vineyards. He also set up a hotel and punt service over the Goulburn for gold miners travelling between Bendigo and Beechworth. A township was established in 1854 with the town being named after Captain John Murchison, an early settler.

The town grew rapidly, with a post office opening on 19 January 1855 (replacing an earlier office at Warranga), a flour mill in 1858 and a Presbyterian church and school in 1859. Small selectors started settling the area after 1870. A bridge was built over the Goulburn to replace the punt service in 1871, with a newspaper, courthouse and mechanics&#x27; institute being established in 1870.

The town grew further in 1875 with the arrival of the first paddle steamer. At that time, Murchison had six hotels, a number of general stores, two flour mills including the highly intact Days Mill and Farm at Murchison South, and numerous stores and services. In 1878, Murchison became the base for operations against Ned Kelly and his gang. The railway reached Murchison East in 1880 and a second station named Murchison was opened on the line to Rushworth in 1890.

The building of the Goulburn Weir for irrigation in 1887-90 meant that the Goulburn River was no longer navigable by paddle steamer, which led to Murchison declining in importance. The development of irrigation led to the growth of nearby towns, notably Shepparton. The Waranga Basin was developed in the early part of the twentieth century approximately 15 kilometres from the town.

===Twentieth century===
Approximately 4,000 Italian, Japanese and German prisoners of war (POWs) were interned near the town between 1941 and 1947. Dhurringile Homestead, 11 kilometres to the north, was used as a POW camp for German officers while the Italians and Japanese were kept at an internment camp in the town. The prisoner of war camp employed 675 people with the Italians and Japanese prisoners working as fruitpickers. The German POWs were not used. After the camps closed in 1947, the internment camp became an Italian war memorial while Dhurringhile Homestead became a minimum security prison, HM Prison Dhurringile.

The Italian National Ossario is located at Murchison cemetery and holds the remains of 130 Italian soldiers and civilians who died while interned in Australia.

====Murchison meteorite====
On 28 September 1969 a meteorite shower fell 2 kilometres south of Murchison. Many local residents collected samples of these meteorites reducing the chance of contamination. The rocks were analysed at the NASA Ames Research Center where they were discovered to contain the first convincing evidence of amino acids of extraterrestrial origin, supporting the Miller–Urey experiment. The Murchison meteorite samples contained 90 different amino acids, only 19 of which are found on earth. The meteorite has been found to contain the oldest materials known to have reached earth. The Meteorite Park in the centre of Murchison celebrates this discovery.

==Transport==
Murchison East station is serviced by V/Line passenger trains on the Shepparton Line.

==Notable people==
Marion (Bill) Edwards, a transsexual barman, was born here on 19 March 1874.

==Sport==
The town has an Australian Rules football team competing in the Kyabram &amp; District Football League. The seniors won the 2013 league premiership.
On September 14 2024 at Mooroopna, the Grasshoppers&#x27; seniors and reserves teams won the KDFL premiership, defeating Shepparton East and Stanhope respectively.

Golfers play at the course of the Murchison Golf Club on Goulburn Valley Highway, Murchison East.

World Headbutting Champion Gianni Vazzoler resides in Murchison since winning his title in nearby Shepparton in 2013 against Captain Redbeard.

<text>Gary Fred Merrill (August 2, 1915 – March 5, 1990) was an American film and television actor whose credits included more than 50 feature films, a half-dozen mostly short-lived TV series, and dozens of television guest appearances. He starred in &quot;All About Eve&quot; and married his costar Bette Davis.

==Early life==
Merrill was born in Hartford, Connecticut, and attended Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, and Trinity College in Hartford. He began acting in 1944, while still in the United States Army Air Forces, in the play &quot;Winged Victory&quot;.

==Career==
Before entering films, Merrill&#x27;s deep cultured voice won him a recurring role as Bruce Wayne / Batman in the &quot;Superman&quot; radio series. His film career began promisingly, with roles in films such as &quot;Twelve O&#x27;Clock High&quot; (1949) and &quot;All About Eve&quot; (1950), but he rarely moved beyond supporting roles in his many Westerns, war movies, and medical dramas. He played a detective and love interest of Barbara Stanwyck&#x27;s character in &quot;Witness to Murder&quot; (1954). His television career was extensive. He appeared from 1954 to 1956 as Jason Tyler on the crime drama &quot;Justice&quot;.

In 1958, Merrill guest starred with June Lockhart in the roles of Joshua and Emily Newton in the episode &quot;Medicine Man&quot; of the series &quot;Cimarron City&quot;.

Merrill had recurring roles in &quot;Then Came Bronson&quot; with Michael Parks and &quot;Young Doctor Kildare&quot;, both of which lasted less than a season.

In addition to Merrill&#x27;s starring roles in several episodes of &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, in November 1963 he starred with Phyllis Thaxter and Fess Parker (&quot;Daniel Boone&quot;) in an episode of &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot; (&quot;Nothing Ever Happens in Linvale&quot;).

In 1964, he starred as city editor Lou Sheldon in the short-lived drama &quot;The Reporter&quot;.

In 1967, he starred in the Elvis Presley film &quot;Clambake&quot;, with costar James Gregory.

Aside from an occasional role as narrator, Merrill essentially retired from the entertainment business after 1980. Shortly before his death, he authored the autobiography &quot;Bette, Rita and the Rest of My Life&quot; (1989).

==Personal life and death==

Merrill&#x27;s first marriage, to Barbara Leeds in 1941, ended in divorce in Mexico on July 28, 1950. That same day, he married Bette Davis, his costar from &quot;All About Eve&quot;, and adopted her daughter, Barbara, from a previous marriage. They adopted two more children, Margot and Michael, but they had a bitter divorce in 1960.

Often politically active, he campaigned in 1958 to elect the Democrat Edmund Muskie as governor of Maine. He also took part in the Selma to Montgomery marches in 1965 to promote Black voter registration. In response to U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s Vietnam War policy, he unsuccessfully sought nomination to the Maine legislature as an anti-war, pro-environmentalist primary candidate.

Merrill survived his second ex-wife, Bette Davis, by only five months, dying of lung cancer in Falmouth, Maine, on March 5, 1990. He is buried in the Pine Grove Cemetery. He was survived by a son, Michael; a daughter, Margot; a brother, Jerry; and two grandchildren.

<doc id="1167402" wikidata="Q416463" url="?curid=1167402" title="Alosetron">
<text>Alosetron, sold under the brand name Lotronex among others, is a 5-HT3 antagonist used for the management of severe diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in females only.
It was patented in 1987 and approved for medical use in 2002. It is currently marketed by Prometheus Laboratories Inc. (San Diego). Alosetron was withdrawn from the market in 2000 owing to the occurrence of serious life-threatening gastrointestinal adverse effects, but was reintroduced in 2002 with availability and use restricted.

==Medical uses==
Alosetron is indicated only for women with severe diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) who have: 
* chronic IBS symptoms (generally lasting 6 months or longer),
* had anatomic or biochemical abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract excluded, and
* not responded adequately to conventional therapy.
Severe IBS-D includes diarrhea and 1 or more of the following:
* frequent and severe abdominal pain/discomfort,
* frequent bowel urgency or fecal incontinence,
* disability or restriction of daily activities due to IBS.

===Efficacy===
The phase III trial for approval was published in 2000 as an industry-funded randomized, placebo-controlled trial (PCT). Its authors found 1 mg alosetron, taken orally twice daily for 12 weeks, was associated with a 12% (CI 4.7-19.2) improvement in relief from abdominal pain and discomfort associated with diarrhea-predominant patients. The prescription of alosetron is currently approved in the U.S. at 0.5 and 1 mg.

The FDA Medical Officer&#x27;s Review, dated November 4, 1999, noted: &quot;Patients considered by investigators to fit the diarrhea-predominant subtype had at baseline... stool consistency values that were neither loose nor watery&quot;. The FDA&#x27;s Gastrointestinal Drugs Advisory Committee referred to the drug&#x27;s efficacy as &quot;modest&quot;, highlighting that the placebo brought relief on the primary outcome measure to 40–50% of women.

==Contraindications==
Lotronex&#x27;s prescribing information brochure states that alosetron should not be initiated in patients with constipation. Other contraindications are: history of chronic or severe constipation or sequelae from constipation; intestinal obstruction, stricture, toxic megacolon, gastrointestinal perforation, and/or adhesions, ischemic colitis, impaired intestinal circulation, thrombophlebitis, or hypercoagulable state; Crohn&#x27;s disease or ulcerative colitis; diverticulitis; severe hepatic impairment. Concomitant use of fluvoxamine is also contraindicated.

==Adverse effects==
Alosetron was withdrawn in 2000 following the association of alosetron with serious life-threatening gastrointestinal adverse effects. The cumulative incidence of ischaemic colitis was 2 in 1000, while serious complications arising from constipation (obstruction, perforation, impaction, toxic megacolon, secondary colonic ischaemia, death) was 1 in 1000. A 1999 review performed by FDA medical officer John Senior, indicated that 27% of patients experienced constipation. The phase III trial reported constipation occurred in 30% and 3% of patients in the alosetron and placebo groups, respectively. It was cited as the most important reason for patients dropping out of the study.



==Mechanism of action==
Alosetron has an antagonist action on the 5-HT3 receptors of the enteric nervous system of the gastrointestinal tract. While being a 5-HT3 antagonist like ondansetron, it is not classified or approved as an antiemetic. Since stimulation of 5-HT3 receptors is positively correlated with gastrointestinal motility, alosetron&#x27;s 5-HT3 antagonism slows the movement of fecal matter through the large intestine, increasing the extent to which water is absorbed, and decreasing the moisture and volume of the remaining waste products.


==History==
Alosetron was originally approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on February 9, 2000, after a seven-month review. At the time of the initial approval U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewers found that alosetron improved symptoms in 10% to 20% of patients.

Shipment to pharmacies started in March, 2000. On July 17, a health professional filed a report with the FDA on the death of a 50-year-old woman who suffered mesenteric ischemia. The report identified alosetron as the &quot;primary suspect&quot; in the death.

Alosetron was withdrawn from the market voluntarily by GlaxoWellcome on November 28, 2000, owing to the occurrence of serious life-threatening gastrointestinal adverse effects, including 5 deaths and additional bowel surgeries. The FDA said it had reports of 49 cases of ischemic colitis and 21 cases of &quot;severe constipation&quot; and that ten of the 70 patients underwent surgeries and 34 others were examined at hospitals and released without surgery. Through November 17, 2000, pharmacists had filled 474,115 prescriptions for alosetron. Severe adverse events continued to be reported, with a final total of 84 instances of ischaemic colitis, 113 of severe constipation, 143 admissions to hospital, and 7 deaths.

Patient advocacy groups, most notably the Lotronex Action Group and the International Foundation for Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders (IFFGD) lobbied for the drug&#x27;s return. Public Citizen Health Research Group, another patient advocacy group, opposed the reintroduction.

On June 7, 2002, the FDA announced the approval of a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) that allows restricted marketing of Lotronex (alosetron hydrochloride), to treat only women with severe diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The strict prescribing guidelines initially introduced in 2002 were relaxed slightly in 2016, enabling electronic prescriptions among other benefits.

It is not known whether alosetron has been filed for registration in the EU.

GSK sold &quot;Lotronex&quot; to the Californian corporation Prometheus in late 2007.

Since 2015, generic versions of alosetron have been available in the US, sold by a number of different companies including Actavis Pharma Company, Prometheus Laboratories and Sebela Pharmaceuticals Inc

===Criticism of the FDA===
In 2001, the editor of the medical journal &quot;The Lancet&quot;, Richard Horton, criticized the FDA&#x27;s handling of alosetron in an unusually sharp language. Horton argued that the treatment of a non-fatal condition did not justify the use of a drug with potentially lethal side effects, and that the FDA should have revoked the approval for alosetron sooner when postmarketing surveillance revealed that many patients had suffered constipation necessitating surgical intervention and ischaemic colitis. He asserted that FDA officials were improperly motivated to maintain and reinstate the approval for alosetron because of the extent to which the FDA&#x27;s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research is funded by user fees paid by pharmaceutical manufacturers, and that the reinstatement of alosetron was negotiated in confidential meetings with representatives of GlaxoSmithKline.

An article published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) noted: &quot;By allowing the marketing of alosetron, a drug that poses a serious and significant public health concern according to its own terms, the FDA failed in its mission.&quot; Others have argued that the approval process of Lotronex was an example of regulatory capture.

<text>Banana bread is a type of sweet bread or cake made from mashed bananas. It is often a moist and sweet quick bread but some recipes are yeast raised.

==History==
Bananas appeared in the US in the 1870s, but it took a while for them to appear as ingredients in desserts. Banana bread recipes emerged in cookbooks across North America when baking powder became available in grocery stores in the 1930s. Some food historians believe banana bread was a byproduct of the Great Depression as resourceful housewives did not wish to throw away overripe bananas. Others believe that banana bread was developed in corporate kitchens to promote flour and baking soda products. Banana bread experienced a resurgence in popularity in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns.

In the Philippines, banana bread is usually called &quot;banana cake.&quot; It was introduced during the American colonial period of the Philippines as the Philippines became a top banana supplier.

February 23 is National Banana Bread Day in the United States.
==Variations==
* Banana raisin bread
* Banana nut bread (often featuring chopped nuts, such as walnuts, pecans or almonds)
* Chocolate chip banana bread (featuring chocolate chips)
* Banana bread muffins
* Banana crumble bread
* Vegan banana bread (made without eggs or dairy products)
* Blueberry banana bread (or other fruits such as raspberry or orange to add additional flavours)

<text>Barrow Hill Roundhouse, until 1948 known as Staveley Engine Shed, is a former Midland Railway roundhouse in Barrow Hill, near Staveley and Chesterfield, Derbyshire (), now serving as a railway heritage centre.

==History==
Staveley Roundhouse was built to a standard Midland Railway square shed design in 1870 with a central turntable under cover. After 1948 it became known as Barrow Hill so as not to confuse it with the ex-Great Central shed nearby. It was operational from 1870 until 9 February 1991.

===Code===
* Midland Railway: M24
* London Midland &amp; Scottish: 18D
* British Railways Eastern region: 41E
* British Railways: BH (end of steam, 4 October 1965)

==Preservation==
After closure, the building was heavily vandalised. After lobbying of the local council, the building was Grade II listed by the Department of the Environment in February 1991. Following negotiations with the British Railways Property Board, Chesterfield Borough Council became the new owner of the shed and nearby yard on 20 December 1996.

The council subsequently granted a recurring maintenance lease to the Barrow Hill Engine Shed Society, which secured and refurbished the site, including renewal of the original 1870 roundhouse glass roof, except for one section. Funding was provided by the borough council, Derbyshire County Council, the Transport Trust, North Derbyshire Training and Enterprise Council, the European Regional Development Fund and the Government SRB fund. The site reopened to the public in July 1998.

Today, still retaining its connection to the UK national rail network through Network Rail, it is home to many preserved British railway locomotives. The Harry Needle Railroad Company also stores and maintains a number of operational lease locomotives on site. As well as the main roundhouse building, Barrow Hill is also home to the former Pinxton Signal box. Relocated after closure, it has since been refurbished and fitted out as per a typical day in its last year of use for Network Rail.

<doc id="1167417" wikidata="Q3888447" url="?curid=1167417" title="Donner Lake">
<text>Donner Lake, formerly known as Truckee Lake, is a freshwater lake in Northeast California on the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada and about northwest of the much larger Lake Tahoe. A moraine serves as a natural dam for the lake. The lake is located in the town of Truckee, between Interstate 80 to the north and Schallenberger Ridge to the south. The tracks of the Union Pacific Railroad run along
Schallenberger Ridge and closely follow the route of the original transcontinental railroad. The historic route of the Lincoln Highway, the first automobile road across America and US 40 follows the northern shoreline, then climbs to Donner Pass from where the entire lake may be viewed.

==History of the name of the lake==

The lake was called Datsa’ shut by the Washoe people. In 1844, the Stephens-Townsend-Murphy party was the first wagon train to successfully cross the Sierra Nevada mountains. Before them, in January 1844, John C. Frémont and Kit Carson found the river, which Frémont named as Salmon-Trout River for the fish in it. They enjoyed the company of the Paiutes in the area, as did later pioneers seeking to cross at this pass.

The wagon train group named it Truckee Lake, from the help given them by a Paiute Chief; they understood him to be calling the river and lake by the word Truckee. They left six wagons at the lake. They took five other wagons across the pass into the Central Valley on November 25, 1844.

Both the lake and the pass were named after the ill-fated Donner Party, which wintered involuntarily near the lake in 1846. 

Donner Memorial State Park was established in 1928; it is not clear when the name of the lake was changed from Truckee to Donner. The state park is on the east end of the lake and provides campsites with access to several different beaches. There are also hiking trails in the park.

== Fishing ==
The lake&#x27;s depth has been measured by the California State Lands Commission to be deep at its deepest point. High water level is above Mean Sea Level.

Donner Lake holds some of the biggest lake trout in the state. There is also a good population of rainbow and brown trout as well as Kokanee salmon. Fisherman use downriggers and troll with plugs for Kokanee salmon and rainbow trout in order to catch the trophy-sized lake trout. During the spring and fall lake trout come to the top to feed, and these are the only times of year one has the chance to hook a laker in shallow water.

A public boat ramp operated by the Truckee Donner Recreation &amp; Parks District is available in the northwest corner of Donner Lake. A fee is charged for boat launching. The lake is open to both powerboats and sailboats.

The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) has developed an advisory for Donner Lake based on mercury and PCBs found in fish caught from this water body. The advisory provides safe eating advice for fish species caught in the body of water.

== Recreation ==

Donner Memorial State Park wraps around the East and part of the South shore of the Lake, encompassing Scallenberger Ridge to the south. Summer activities include: camping, picnicking, boating, fishing, water-skiing, wind-surfing, hiking, and mountain biking. Winter activities include cross-country skiing and snowshoeing. The Park features the Pioneer Monument - welcoming visitors year round - which was built to commemorate the Donner Party traveling to California from the east in the mid-19th century. The statue itself is positioned high, which is said to be the depth snow reached during the winter of 1846 when the Donner Party failed to make it over the pass.

The North shore of the Lake hosts of public docks for both swimmers and boaters. The Donner Lake Triathlon is held every year, which consists of the Sprint Triathlon: swim, bike, run and the International Triathlon: , , run.

===Hiking===
 There are roughly of hiking trails inside the Park. Visitors can legally park in Coldstream Canyon (just past the 76 gas station) which contains the alignment of the primary Emigrant Trail, which leads up to U.S. Forest Service and the Pacific Crest trails beyond the park. Donner Lake is roughly around.

===Camping===
There are 154 sites to camp at in the park and a day-use area along the lake. A lakeside interpretive trail has 18 panels which discuss the natural and cultural resources in the local area.

<text>Armen Leonovich Takhtajan or Takhtajian (; surname also transliterated Takhtadjan, Takhtadzhi︠a︡n or Takhtadzhian, pronounced takh-tuh-JAHN; 10 June 1910 – 13 November 2009), was a Soviet-Armenian botanist, one of the most important figures in 20th century plant evolution and systematics and biogeography. His other interests included morphology of flowering plants, paleobotany, and the flora of the Caucasus. He was one of the most influential taxonomists of the latter twentieth century.

== Life ==

=== Family ===

Takhtajan was born in Shushi, Russian Empire, present-day disputed Nagorno-Karabakh, on 10 June 1910, to a family of Armenian intellectuals. His grandfather Meliksan Takhtadzhyan Petrovich had been born in Trabzon, Ottoman Empire and was educated in Italy, on the island of San Lazzaro degli Armeni, an Armenian enclave, spoke many languages and worked as a journalist. He died in Paris in 1930. His father, Leon Meliksanovich Takhtadzhyan (1884–1950), was born in Batumi, Georgia and was educated as an agronomist at Leipzig University. Graduating in 1906, he worked on farms in France, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, and made a special study of sheep farming. He became proficient in German, French, English, Russian, Georgian and Azerbaijani. Arriving in Shushi in 1908, then a centre of sheep farming in the Caucasus, looking for work, Leon was forced to teach German at the local &quot;Realschule&quot; attached to the Armenian seminary, due to lack of opportunities in his chosen field. There he met and married Gerseliya Sergeevna Gazarbekyan (1887–1974), Armen Takhtajan&#x27;s mother, a native of Susha, in 1909.

=== Early life and education ===
The Takhtajans had three children, Armen (1910–2009), Nellie (1914–1994) and Nora (1918–1965). In 1918 the family were forced to flee to northern Armenia because of the pogroms. Throughout his childhood, Armen showed a keen interest in natural history, travelling with his father. Armen attended school in Tbilisi in nearby Georgia, initially at Unified Labor School number 42 (former Mantashevskom commercial school). There he came under the influence of one of his teachers, Alexander Konstantinovich Makaev (Makashvili) (1896–1962), who had previously taught agriculture at Tbilisi State University, and had produced a dictionary of botanical names in Georgian, Russian and Latin. Makaev would take Armen on botanical excursions, teaching him to identify plants from Sosnowski and Grossheim&#x27;s &quot;Determinants of plant life in the vicinity of Tbilisi&quot; (1920). In 1928 he completed secondary school and travelled to Leningrad. There he volunteered at the biology school at Leningrad University and attended lectures by Vladimir Leontyevich Komarov (1869–1945) on plant morphology. In 1929 he began his studies in biology at Yerevan State University in Yerevan, Armenia, which he completed in 1931. He then returned to Tbilisi, enrolling in the All-Union Institute of Subtropical Crops.

In 1932 after completing his course at Tbilisi he worked for a while as a laboratory assistant at Sukhumi, Georgia, at the subtropical branch of the All-Union Institute of Applied Botany and New Crops (now the Institute of Plant Industry), before returning to Yerevan. In Yerevan he took a position as researcher at the Natural History Museum of Armenia, and then at the Herbarium of the Armenian branch of the Institute of Biology, Soviet Academy of Sciences, and began teaching at Yerevan University in 1936, while completing his Master&#x27;s thesis.

He died in Saint Petersburg on 13 November 2009, at the age of 99, in 2009, having just completed his most important work, &quot;Flowering Plants&quot;.

== Work ==
From 1938 to 1948 he headed a Department at the Yerevan State University, and in 1944–1948 he was director of the Botanical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Armenian SSR, and Professor of the Leningrad State University. Takhtajan was a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, as well as a foreign associate of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences since 1971. He was also the academician of the Academy of Sciences of the Armenian SSR, the president of the Soviet All-Union Botanical Society (1973) and the International Association for Plant Taxonomy (1975), member of the Finnish Academy of Science and Literature (1971), the German Academy of Naturalists &quot;Leopoldina&quot; (1972) and other scientific societies. He was a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters from 1980.

While at the Komarov Botanical Institute in Leningrad in 1940, Takhtajan developed his classification scheme for flowering plants, which emphasized phylogenetic relationships between plants. His system did not become known to botanists in the West until after 1950, and in the late 1950s he began a correspondence and collaboration with the prominent American botanist Arthur Cronquist, whose plant classification scheme was heavily influenced by his collaboration with Takhtajan and other botanists at Komarov.

He is chiefly famous as the author of works on the origins of flowering plants and paleobotany, developing a new classification system of higher plants. He worked on the &quot;Flora of Armenia&quot; (vol. 1–6, 1954–73) and &quot;Fossil flowering plants of the USSR &quot;(v. 1, 1974) books. Takhtajan also developed a system of floristic regions.(Takhtajan, Crovello and Cronquist, 1986)

For many years restrictions were placed on his work because of his opposition to the official line on genetics promoted by Lysenko. In 1993 he worked for a while at the New York Botanical Garden.

=== Takhtajan system ===

The &quot;Takhtajan system&quot; of flowering plant classification treats flowering plants as a division (phylum), &quot;Magnoliophyta&quot;, with two classes, &quot;Magnoliopsida&quot; (dicots) and &quot;Liliopsida&quot; (monocots). These two classes are subdivided into subclasses, and then superorders, orders, and families. The Takhtajan system is similar to the Cronquist system, but with somewhat greater complexity at the higher levels. He favors smaller orders and families, to allow character and evolutionary relationships to be more easily grasped. The Takhtajan classification system remains influential; it is used, for example, by the Montréal Botanical Garden.

== Legacy ==
Takhtajan has been considered one of the leading botanists of his time.

He has been honoured in the naming of several plant genera. In 1980, botanist Vandika Ervandovna Avetisyan published &quot;Takhtajaniella&quot;, which is a genus of flowering plant from Transcausica, belonging to the family Brassicaceae and it was named in his honour. Then in 1990, Nazarova published &quot;Takhtajaniantha&quot; (from the dandelion tribe within the daisy family,) and lastly in 1997, &quot;Takhtajania&quot; (from the family Winteraceae, which was found in Madagascar) was published.

<doc id="1167422" wikidata="Q4588433" url="?curid=1167422" title="Let's Learn Japanese">
<text>Let&#x27;s Learn Japanese is a video-based Japanese language study course for English speakers produced by The Japan Foundation.

The two seasons (Series I and Series II) were originally aired on television at a rate of one episode per day, with each episode consisting of two lessons. Text books which complement the series were also available; these contained vocabulary lists, explanations of grammar, transcriptions of scenes from within the program, and cultural information about Japan. By now, the first book is out of print but the second book is still available from some sources.
Both seasons used a drama called &quot;Yan and the Japanese People&quot; for instruction. This drama consisted of scenes which focus on the experiences of a young man named Yan (played by Nick Muhrin), a foreigner living and working in Japan.

==&quot;Let&#x27;s Learn Japanese Basic I&quot;==
Series one of &quot;Let&#x27;s Learn Japanese&quot; was made in 1984 and 1985. It was presented by Mary Althaus and featured a number of skits, featuring Mine-san (Yusuke Mine), Sugihara-san (Miki Sugihara), and Kaihō-san (Hiroyuki Kaihō), who were designed to help the viewer memorize, and practice the use of, new words and grammatical structures. The series also followed the story of Yan&#x27;s new life in Japan working as an architect.

==&quot;Let&#x27;s Learn Japanese Basic II&quot;==
Series two was created in 1995 10 years after the end of the first seriesand was presented by Tae Umino. The skits were performed by Andō-san (Seiji Andō), Koyanagi-san (Chinatsu Koyanagi) and Kodama-san (Yorinobu Kodama). In this series the story of Yan is continued (based on Episode 14–26 of the original Drama), only this time it is much darker and more interesting. Yan&#x27;s heart is torn asunder by the young lady he had a crush on in series one, and he goes to Niigata to drown his sorrows in the wild winter Sea of Japan.

==Other series==

===NHK Let&#x27;s Learn Japanese Series ===
There was also another Japanese language study series named &quot;NHK Japanese: how to survive in Japan?&quot; which was produced by the Japanese TV Network NHK in 1989. This 40-part series was about David Roberts (ostensibly an American but speaks with an Australian accent) who went to Japan for work. He was assisted by a beautiful girl named Yuko Goto, and in later episodes they are joined by David&#x27;s wife, Cathy Roberts. David was going to introduce to Japan American culture and food with the American Train.

A fresh start to the Japan Foundation program was the third series, &quot;Erin&#x27;s Challenge! I can speak Japanese&quot;, which aired first in spring 2007 and is also available on DVD and in the form of an interactive website. As it is especially designed for young people it features skits about Senior High School Students which are explained by computer-animated figures. The main character Erin is learning Japanese with the help of the teacher Honigon and a small robot called N21-J. Besides the regular skits and explanations, there is also more information about Japan, its students and people around the world who are learning Japanese, too.

<text>Ruatāhuna is a small town in the remote country of Te Urewera, in the northeast of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. It is 90 kilometres directly west of Gisborne, and 18 kilometres northwest of Lake Waikaremoana. By road, it is 50 kilometres south-east of Murupara, and 110 kilometres north-west of Wairoa. It is on the upper reaches of the Whakatāne River, and surrounded on three sides by the Te Urewera protected area, formerly the Te Urewera National Park. The road that runs from Murupara through Ruatahuna to Āniwaniwa on Lake Waikaremoana, a large part of which is unsealed, used to be designated as part of State Highway 38. It is a subdivision of the Galatea-Murupara ward of the Whakatāne District.

== History ==

The area was the site of much action during the New Zealand Wars of the 1860s and 1870s. From 1870 to 1888, one of the largest wharenui ever built, Te Whai-a-te-Motu, was constructed for Te Kooti and his followers.

==Marae==

Ruatāhuna is within the &quot;rohe&quot; (tribal area) of Tūhoe, and has several marae affiliated with Tūhoe hapū:

* Kākānui (Tīpapa) marae and Kākahu Tāpiki meeting house, affiliated with Kākahu Tāpiki.
* Mātaatua marae and Te Whai-a-te-Motu meeting house, affiliated with Te Urewera.
* Ōhāua or Ōhāua te Rangi marae and Te Poho-o-Pōtiki meeting house, affiliated with Ngāti Rongo.
* Ōpūtao marae and Te Ngāwari meeting house, affiliated with Ngāti Tāwhaki.
* Ōtekura marae and Te Ōhāki meeting house, affiliated with Tamakaimoana.
* Pāpueru marae and Te Whatu o Te Kanohi meeting house, affiliated with Ngāti Tāwhaki.
* Tātāhoata marae and Te Tapuae meeting house, affiliated with Ngāi Te Riu.
* Te Umuroa marae and Te Poho-o-Parahaki meeting house, affiliated with Ngāti Manunui.
* Uwhiārae marae and Te Paena meeting house, affiliated with Ngāi Te Paena.
* Te Wai-iti marae and Te Poho o Kurī Kino meeting house, affiliated with Ngāti Kurī Kino.

In October 2020, the Government committed $3,996,258 from the Provincial Growth Fund to upgrade Kākānui, Mātaatua, Ōhāua, Pāpueru, Tātāhoata, Uwhiārae, Te Wai-iti marae, creating 79 jobs.

<doc id="1167440" wikidata="Q130266902" url="?curid=1167440" title="Mid-Suffolk Light Railway">
<text>The Mid-Suffolk Light Railway (MSLR) was a standard gauge railway intended to open up an agricultural area of central Suffolk; it took advantage of the reduced construction cost enabled by the Light Railways Act 1896. It was launched with considerable enthusiasm by local interests, and was to build a network, but actual share subscription was weak, and the company over-reached its available financial resources. It opened of route from Haughley to Laxfield in 1904 to goods traffic only, and income was poor, further worsening the company&#x27;s financial situation.

The Board continued to harbour ambitions to complete the planned network, but crippling interest on loans and capital repayments falling due forced the company into receivership in 1906. Passenger operation was started in 1908, but this too was disappointing. At the grouping of the railways in 1923, the MSLR was still in receivership, and there was a protracted dispute over the liquidation of the debt, but in 1924 the Company was absorbed into the London and North Eastern Railway.

The poor usage of the line led to its closure in 1952. A heritage group started a railway museum site at Brockford, and as a charity it trades as the Mid-Suffolk Light Railway. The original line and the heritage line are informally referred to as &quot;The Middy&quot;.

==First railways==
The first railway through central Suffolk was the Ipswich and Bury Railway: it opened from Ipswich to Haughley and Bury St Edmunds in 1846. The company was absorbed by the Eastern Union Railway in 1847, and in 1848 and 1849 the line was extended to Norwich from Haughley.

Further east the East Suffolk Railway was opened in 1859, joining Ipswich to Yarmouth and Lowestoft. The lines were absorbed by the dominant Eastern Counties Railway, and in 1862 the ECR and other lines in East Anglia were amalgamated to form the Great Eastern Railway.

The central area between these lines was chiefly agricultural in nature, and industrial development was insignificant.

==Light railway legislation==
In 1896 the Light Railways Act was passed; it was intended to foster the construction of low-cost railways by permitting streamlined processes for authorisation, and in some cases lower technical standards for safety equipment. In October 1898 H L Godden of Jeyes and Godden, civil engineers, wrote to parish councils of several villages in Mid-Suffolk, saying that they had a client, (it proved to be B M Kilby,) who would match local subscriptions towards a light railway to serve the district. Enthusiasm for the scheme gathered pace, and soon 296 persons had contributed nearly £1,000 towards the legal costs, with amounts varying between a shilling and £1.

An application for a Light Railway Order was made in May 1899, and the Light Railway Commissioners held an inquiry in Ipswich, on 6 July 1899. It was an ambitious scheme for 50 miles of railway, described by its supporters as &quot;the most important Light Railway scheme to be brought before the Commissioners since the Light Railway Act of 1896.&quot; The network would interconnect the Ipswich to Norwich main line and the East Suffolk line; it was to run from Haughley to Halesworth, miles, from Bedingfield to Westerfield, 14 miles, and from Debenham to Needham Market, 8 miles. Omnibuses would run in connection with trains from Westerfield to the centre of Ipswich. The railway would be standard gauge.

At the hearing, the GER was cautiously supportive, subject to agreement about junction connections. It was suggested that the very large number of level crossings should all have resident keepers, but it was agreed that that would be unreasonably expensive. There was some objection to both the Haughley and Needham Market connections, and the latter was dropped, reducing the network to 42 miles. Accordingly, the Mid-Suffolk Light Railway Order was made on 5 April 1900. The share capital was to be £225,000. Public ungated level crossings were to be equipped with cattle guards. There were complex restrictions in the event of the use of electric traction—street running tramways were being installed in Ipswich and elsewhere at the time.

==Construction==
The directors wasted no time in preparing for construction, and a contract was awarded to S Pearson and Sons on 27 July 1900. However, after a few months Pearson and Sons were complaining that they had not yet had instructions to proceed; this seems to have been due to a delay in securing subscribed capital. At a board meeting on 23 November 1901, the engineers explained that there was difficulty in making the line near the River Blyth at Halesworth, and a deviation was recommended. The company&#x27;s bankers were asked to give an overdraft of £1,000 to pay for additional surveys, pending the issue of shares. In fact it was not until December 1901 that a prospectus was published for the share issue. The tone of the document made it clear that this was no rural backwater branch, but that the Company saw its line as an integral part of the long-distance network of the country. Half the share capital was being offered now as ordinary shares, with the second half to be issued later as preference shares. S Pearson and Sons resigned from the contract at this stage, evidently frustrated at the lack of action by the Company, and S Jackson of London was appointed instead.

The first sod was cut on 3 May 1902 in a field at Westerfield; &quot;no expense was spared&quot; despite the company&#x27;s financial problems; 600 guests attended for a sumptuous luncheon, many brought in by special trains; the 83-year-old Duke of Cambridge performed the ceremony. On 22 July 1902, a further overdraft was agreed with the bank: £15,000 this time. Several more were to follow.

On 22 September 1902 Lord Kitchener, the hero of Khartoum, had received the Freedom of Ipswich and the following day he visited Mr Chevallier at Aspall Hall. As the line was substantially complete from Haughley to Mendlesham, Kitchener was conveyed on the line in the contractor&#x27;s wagon, afterwards continuing by motor car, one of the first in the district, following the planned route.

At an Annual General Meeting in August 1903 it was announced that further overdrafts had been taken due to poor take-up of the preference shares. Westerfield was now favoured as the priority for opening, as it was now hoped that residential traffic could be generated there. Steam railcars had been introduced by the London and South Western Railway and this system appeared to offer a major benefit in technical and business terms. At the end of 1903 the Company&#x27;s financial position was becoming obviously unsustainable, yet when the bankers stated that no further overdraft facility would be available, the directors were said to be surprised at the news. The Treasury informed the railway company in April 1904 that they would advance £25,000 as a grant, provided East Suffolk County Council advanced a similar sum, but the County Council refused.

Discussions with the GER over the configuration of the junctions appeared to have been concluded, but an enquiry about the use of Haughley GER station resulted in a demand for a rental which the MSLR considered unaffordable. It took until February 1905 for the proposed deviation at Halesworth to be agreed by the Commissioners, due to delay by the Mid-Suffolk company in submitting definite proposals. Even then there was a dispute over the steep gradient on which train marshalling would have to take place, and interference between the MSLR and GER traffic during the process.

==Opening==
The line was opened between Haughley and Laxfield to goods traffic on 20 September 1904, although much work remained to be done to complete the line. The first train left Haughley at 8.00 a.m. hauled by Jackson&#x27;s 0–6–0 tank locomotive &quot;Lady Stevenson&quot;. There was no ordinary goods traffic to convey, so the load was ballast wagons required by the contractor further down the line, although several packages were picked up at various stations on the return journey.

The first of the company&#x27;s own locomotives was delivered from Hudswell Clarke at the beginning of November 1904; it was an 0–6–0 tank engine, numbered 1 and named Haughley. It had been available for opening day, but the manufacturers were suspicious of the Company&#x27;s ability to pay, and they did not release it at first. Some goods wagons arrived later. A second locomotive was delivered in March 1905. Goods stations were located at Mendlesham, Aspall, Kenton, Horham and Stradbroke, and later at Old Newton, Brockford, Worlingworth and Wilby. Use of the line for cattle traffic in the Laxfield area had a noticeable adverse effect on GER traffic at Framlingham, which had been used as a railhead for cattle traffic previously.

In January 1905 the board planned the start of a passenger service of four passenger trains each way between Haughley and Laxfield, increased to six on Tuesdays (Ipswich market day). In January the railway carried about 1,500 tons of goods, 30 trucks of cattle and 500 parcels, and an early cattle train started running on Ipswich market days. Passenger train operation was not permitted until the line had been inspected by an officer of the Board of Trade, and this had not yet been done. Notwithstanding the prohibition, a private passenger train was run in June 1905, when an Ipswich historical study society visited churches and large houses in the area. More than one hundred members joined a Mid-Suffolk train formed of the company&#x27;s new coaching stock at Haughley for a run to Kenton, and back after viewing buildings there. At the time the Ipswich to Norwich bridge had not been completed, and the line climbed to a temporary level crossing over the road.

In 1905 it was stated that the company owned 2 locomotives, 7 carriages, 2 brake vans, 18 goods wagons, 2 horseboxes and 6 cattle wagons. All the rolling stock was paid for except locomotive No. 2. In this period a running battle developed between the contractor and the company, over whether the contractor had completed his obligations; the company&#x27;s own engineer was compromised and he was replaced.

At the end of March 1905 the Company&#x27;s Chairman, Francis Seymour Stevenson, suddenly resigned and it became known that he was personally bankrupt. There was a public bankruptcy hearing. Coupled with the departure of the contractor, this put the company&#x27;s reputation in the worst possible light, and when debentures became due for repayment and there was no money to discharge the debt, writs were immediately issued against the company. The Company sold land at Westerfield, intended for the line there, to the Great Eastern Railway, and used the money to pay some of the debt down.

The Board of Trade inspection necessary for passenger operation took place on 2 July 1905, when Lieutenant Colonel P. G. Von Donop visited. There were a large number of deficiencies and von Donop refused permission.

The company decided during 1906 to extend the line by over a mile and a half to Cratfield (Goram&#x27;s Mill), and in June 1906 this was opened. Passengers were occasionally permitted to ride on the goods service.

In extending to Cratfield, the Company decided to slow down construction to Westerfield and suspended the loading facility at Debenham.

==Administrative problems==
More debentures were due in October 1906 and Eagle Insurance Company representatives sat in on the Board meeting. There was no means of paying the money, and the Company became bankrupt, a receiver being appointed from 6 October 1906. After a short interregnum, J F R Daniel was brought in to be receiver; he had been successful in keeping the Weston, Clevedon and Portishead Light Railway in operation during its financial crises. Daniel was now 78 years old.

In February 1907 a public hearing into the Halesworth deviation was at last held: the company proposed to cross the GER line and join the narrow-gauge Southwold Railway, and use its Halesworth terminus. The gauge of the Southwold line there would be altered, probably by providing mixed gauge. The GER objected to what they saw as an amalgamation of the MSLR and the Southwold line, on the grounds of unfair competition with their own railway, and the Commissioners found in favour of that objection: the MSLR was unable to proceed.

==Passenger operation==
The priority of the Receiver was now to start passenger operation, and much work was done to that end. Von Donop visited the line to consider the matter on 25 September 1908. He was not entirely happy with the progress made, but subject to an undertaking to rectify a number of minor matters he approved the opening, and a passenger service started on 29 September 1908.

==From 1909==
In February 1912 it was decided to suspend traffic on the section from Laxfield Mill to Cratfield, as income on the section was very poor. Even now the Directors, who of course were not in control of the Company as it was still in receivership, sought advice from the Railway Commissioners about reviving the extension to Halesworth. The reply inevitably reminded them that they would have to purchase their line back from the receiver, and obtain the consent of the debenture and preference share holders; this was obviously an impossible task, and at length the directors accepted the reality that their scheme to cross the Mid-Suffolk area by rail was unachievable. The track that had been laid beyond Laxfield was recovered for war use in 1914. The Cratfield extension from Laxfield had been opened in 1906, and closed in February 1912. The originally proposed 50-mile network was reduced to 19 miles.

In the Summer of 1911 a Sunday service of two trains each way was run, but it was not considered a financial success and was not repeated in later years.

==Grouping of the railways==
After World War I the huge backlog of maintenance overwhelmed the company&#x27;s ability to pay for it against falling income. The Railways Act 1921 brought most of the railways of Great Britain into the ownership of one or other of four new large companies, in a process called &quot;the grouping&quot;. The MSLR was to be absorbed by the new London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). However the MSLR was in receivership still, and there were large liabilities and uncertainty about how to discharge them. £89,794 was owed, and an appeal was not affordable because of the cost. The LNER negotiated with debenture holders and negotiated a reduction of the debt to £29,960. The dispute took some time, only being resolved on 3 April 1924; the actual transfer was to date from 1 July 1924, with official transfer back-dated to 1 January 1923.

The viability of the passenger operation came under scrutiny, and it was reported that from 1925 to 1928, the number of passenger bookings from the branch stations had reduced from 3,296 to 2,162; takings on the line in 1930 amounted to £990. At this period there was a serious proposal to convert the line to a road, but it was found to be impractical.

==From 1945, and closure==
During World War II the passenger train service was reduced to two trains each way daily and remained at that level throughout the remaining lifetime of the line. From November 1939 the branch trains used the LNER platform at Haughley; the MSLR station was used for goods sidings purposes only.

The declining use of the line and the increasing deficit led to a decision to close, and all train services were withdrawn from 28 July 1952. The railway was later taken up by contractors using a Ruston 48DS.

==Heritage railway==

Nearly 40 years after it closed, a group of enthusiasts formed a Company to recreate the Middy Line at the site of the Brockford and Wetheringsett railway station.

The Mid-Suffolk Light Railway Society had a difficult task ahead of them due to the lightly constructed nature of the original line. As far as is known, no coaches or locomotives of the Middy are still in existence, and the corrugated iron buildings were either left to rust or sold to become farm sheds. However, the Company has been recreating typical scenes from the Middy&#x27;s past by using restored coaches and wagons that would have run on its bigger neighbour, the Great Eastern Railway, and its successor, the London &amp; North Eastern Railway. The Society has been able to collect a number of Great Eastern coaches, three are now in working order, with others under restoration. The museum has also been able to collect some of the remaining station buildings from former Middy railway stations.

In February 2017, permission was obtained to extend the line to a new station, to be named Wilby Halt. The line plans to eventually reopen as far as Aspall. The railway made progress on this extension during the COVID-19 pandemic, the work being carried out by Network Rail contractors.

The society also has a collection of goods wagons and road delivery vehicles, and line side artefacts. In addition there is an archive of photos and original artefacts from the working life of the Mid-Suffolk Light Railway. The museum operates from April to the end of September on Sundays and Bank Holidays, with Santa specials in December. Many of the Open Days have a Special Event to accompany the running of the steam locomotive.

The line was used as inspiration for the John Hadfield novel, &quot;Love on a Branch Line&quot;. The book was first published in 1959, and was turned into a television series in 1994.

<text>Albert Paul Mantz (August 2, 1903 – July 8, 1965) was a noted air racing pilot, movie stunt pilot and consultant from the late 1930s until his death in the mid-1960s. He gained fame on two stages: Hollywood and in air races.

==Early years==
Mantz (the name he used throughout his life) was born in Alameda, California, the son of a school principal, and was raised in nearby Redwood City, California. He developed his interest in flying at an early age; as a young boy, his first flight on fabricated canvas wings was aborted when his mother stopped him as he tried to launch off the branch of a tree in his yard. In 1915, at age 12, he attended the Panama Pacific Exposition in San Francisco and witnessed the world-famous Lincoln Beachey make his first ever flight in his new monoplane, the Lincoln Beachey Special.

Mantz took his first flying lesson at age 16 using money that he made from driving a hearse during the influenza epidemic of 1919. Although he had accumulated hours towards his private pilot certificate, Mantz quit flying when he witnessed the death of his instructor.

On September 24, 1924, Mantz became a part of a famous aviation event when he lent his car battery to the Douglas World Cruiser that had &quot;dead-sticked&quot; into a field on its way to San Francisco for a celebration of the world flight.

== U.S. Army air cadet ==
Mantz applied for admission to the United States Army flight school at March Field, California but was told he needed at least two years of college to be eligible. Apparently resorting to a ruse involving Stanford University stationery, he managed to gain admission with false documents and became a successful cadet. He did not inform officials of his prior flying experience.

In 1927, shortly before his graduation at March Field, Mantz was flying solo over the Coachella Valley when he spotted a train heading west over the empty desert floor up the long grade from Indio. He rolled over into a dive, leveled off a few feet above the track and flew head-on towards the train as the engineer repeatedly sounded the whistle. At the last moment Mantz pulled up, did a &quot;victory roll&quot; and flew away. This sort of dangerous stunt was fairly common during the early era of loosely regulated flying in the 1920s, but the train&#x27;s passengers included ranking officers coming to March Field to participate in the graduation ceremonies and Mantz was subsequently dismissed from the army. His instructor reportedly made it clear to him that he had the makings of an exceptional pilot and encouraged him to continue a career in aviation.

== Hollywood stunt pilot ==
After working briefly in commercial aviation, Mantz went to Hollywood, attracted by the large sums of money movie stunt pilots were making at the time. A main requirement was Associated Motion Picture Pilots (AMPP) membership but that was only gained after employment in the industry. In an effort to gain notoriety, on July 6, 1930, Mantz set a record in flying 46 consecutive outside loops as a part of the dedication ceremonies of the San Mateo airport. Although he gained recognition as an accomplished pilot, without the AMPP card, he still could not work in Hollywood. However, in 1931, Mantz performed the climactic stunt in &quot;The Galloping Ghost&quot; which required him to fly down a canyon and just miss a prominent sycamore. Misjudging his approach, Mantz crashed into the tree but the film crew got their shot and he got his AMPP card.

Howard Hughes was among his first clients. After much difficulty finding steady stunt work, he accepted a particularly risky assignment, flying a Curtis-Wright CW-16K through a hangar with less than five feet of clearance off each wingtip for the 1932 film &quot;Air Mail&quot;. Mantz reportedly handled the challenge with thorough planning, which set him apart from most of the pilots then flying stunts for the movies.

&quot;Air Mail&quot; was a hit and as word spread about his success in getting through the hangar unscathed, Mantz found more work and his professional ideas about stunt flying were gradually accepted by the studios. &quot;United Air Services&quot;, Mantz fledgling company at United Airport in Burbank, offered readily available aircraft and pilots, standard rates and insurance to protect producers from the financial risks of accidents and downtime. Mantz&#x27;s company grew steadily along with the public&#x27;s fascination with flying as the studios made increasing numbers of aviation related films. His &quot;Paul Mantz Air Services&quot; air charter company (jokingly christened the &quot;Honeymoon Express&quot;) also flourished and became a favorite among Hollywood stars, many of whom, such as Clark Gable and James Cagney became friends. One of his helicopters appears in the Errol Flynn short documentary film, &quot;Cruise of the Zaca&quot; (1952), as featured on the 2 disc Special Edition DVD of &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;.

==Other activities==
During this period, Mantz carried out a number of &quot;mercy&quot; flights including transporting a deep sea diver to the Mare Island Navy Yard where a decompression chamber was able to save his life, flying 15 Mexican fishermen to safety after their boat began to break up, and dropping supplies to assist 53 trapped firefighters in the Santa Barbara mountains. Mantz had to fly low through an inferno in order to make the drop. After Tom Mix&#x27;s accident and death, Mantz was also chosen to fly the body of Mix home.

In 1937, a few months before Amelia Earhart vanished over the western Pacific Ocean, Mantz, acting as a technical advisor, tutored her in long-distance flying and navigation.

Earhart asked Mantz to pilot the landing at Wheeler Army Airfield, Honolulu, after an overnight, 15-hour 47-minute flight from Oakland, California, of Earhart’s Lockheed Electra 10E Special, registration NR16020, with crew: pilot Amelia Earhart, co-pilot Paul Mantz, navigator Frederick Joseph Noonan, radio operator and navigator Harry Manning.

Air racing also became a passion for Mantz in the late-1930s. He entered his Lockheed Orion in the Bendix Trophy transcontinental dash from Los Angeles to Cleveland, placing third in 1938 and 1939.

On July 4, 1938, Mantz flew from Wichita to Burbank, California, accompanied by Paramount press agent, pilot, and pulp writer, Edward Churchill, in an attempt to break the speed-dash record. The stunt was part of the promotion for the film &quot;Men With Wings&quot;. The flight ran into several difficulties. The motor overheated over the Grand Canyon. When they reached Burbank, the landing gear jammed and it took 30 minutes to work it loose, while thousands of spectators looked from the ground and the fuel ran perilously low. Churchill was stricken with carbon monoxide poisoning and had to be treated by a physician after landing.

== World War II ==
During World War II, Mantz enlisted and was commissioned a major (later promoted to lieutenant colonel), serving in the First Motion Picture Unit (FMPU) in California. Following an August 1944 honorable discharge, Mantz purchased a fleet of 475 wartime surplus bombers and fighters (including North American P-51 Mustang fighters) for $55,000 to use in film work. Mantz joked that he had the sixth-largest air force in the world, and sold the fleet&#x27;s onboard fuel for a profit on his initial investment. Retaining only 12 aircraft, the remainder of his &quot;air force&quot; was sold off as &quot;scrap&quot; at a handsome profit.
When the P38 was in development, Mantz was test pilot along with flight engineer, Simon Severson. This twin engine aircraft design went on to become a major success for victory.

== Racing pilot ==

With his film fleet in place, Mantz chose one of the P-51 fighters to convert it into a Bendix Trophy racer. With his longtime mechanic, Cort Johnson, he totally rebuilt the P-51C, stripping out all military issue equipment and modifying the wings with &quot;wet&quot; fuel cells. In the 1946 Bendix Trophy race, all the competitors flew similar converted warbirds but Mantz prevailed with an average speed of 435 mph. He went on to win the Bendix for an unprecedented three consecutive years (1946–1948) with over $125,000.00 in winnings.

== Postwar film career ==
In 1945, Mantz flew a P-40 and directed aerial sequences in God is My Co-Pilot. He single-handedly piloted a Boeing B-17 for the &quot;near-suicidal&quot; belly landing scenes in Twelve O&#x27;Clock High and the footage was reused in several other movies. For that stunt he reportedly received one of the highest fees ever paid up to that time ($4,500 in 1949 dollars or $58,000 in 2024).

NBC hired Mantz to in 1953 fly footage of the coronation of Elizabeth II from Montreal to New York in a P-51, so the network could broadcast it the same day.

His longest single flying assignment was in the late 1950s, for the TV series &quot;Sky King&quot;.

Mantz piloted a converted B-25 bomber to film footage for Cinerama travelogues. According to an interview in the documentary &quot;Cinerama Adventure&quot; with Mantz&#x27;s cameraman, in one instance, Mantz flew through an active volcano and narrowly escaped crashing into the mouth of the volcano when the engines died due to oxygen starvation. Mantz&#x27;s B-25 was outfitted with a refrigerator and other amenities for comfort as he used it for world travel on film assignments.

Mantz came up with the idea for filming the opening shot for the 1955 film &quot;Bad Day at Black Rock&quot; in which an aerial view of an approaching passenger train was filmed in reverse with the consist backing away from the camera helicopter as flying towards the train was too dangerous. The sequence was then reversed in the film.

Mantz used his B-25 to film Cinerama sequences of military aircraft at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, in October and November 1956, for the Lowell Thomas production, &quot;Search for Paradise&quot;, released in 1957. Also, in 1957 he was the behind the scene pilot for the film “The Spirit of St. Louis.”

In 1961, aged 58, Mantz formed Tallmantz Aviation with pilot Frank Tallman, supplying aircraft along with their personal stunt flying services to movie and television productions. Together they were involved in several movies including the flying sequences performed in a Beech 18 in the 1963 comedy &quot;It’s a Mad Mad Mad Mad World&quot;.

== Airline ==

Paul Mantz Air Services operated as a supplemental air carrier (originally known as a nonscheduled carrier or irregular air carrier) from 1947 onward as a sole proprietorship. Until 1953, the airline operated purely charters, mostly for motion picture companies and the US Forest Service. However, in January 1953, Mantz gave control of his airline to the North Star combine, a ticket agency that operated the Mantz airline in scheduled service, which was illegal. During this time, the Mantz airline operated a C-46 aircraft leased from another North Star airline. In 1959, an investigation by the Civil Aeronautics Board, the now defunct US Federal agency that, at the time, tightly regulated almost all US commercial air transportation, allowed the airline to keep its operating authority, notwithstanding an initial judgment by the CAB examiner that it should not. However, from late 1953, the airline no longer flew large air transport aircraft. In 1960, Mantz transferred the activities to a corporate entity that he controlled, Paul Mantz Air Services, Inc. In 1961, this corporation changed its name to Paramount Airlines, Inc.

However, in 1962, the CAB declined to certificate Paramount under the terms of a new Federal law, as was required for the airline to keep operating. The CAB did so because from March 1961, when the airline resumed operation, the CAB believed Paramount was under the control of another combine, called Skycoach, which had arranged for Paramount&#x27;s sale from Mantz to a third party. During this period, Paramount operated with two Lockheed Constellation and, from 1962, two Douglas DC-7C aircraft.

== Family life ==
In 1932, Mantz married Myrtle &quot;Red&quot; Harvey, one of his former flying students, but divorced in 1935. He remarried two years later to Theresa &quot;Terry&quot; Mae Minor and had a son, Paul, Jr., with her. He adopted her two children by a previous marriage to Roy T. Minor (1904–1935), Roy, Jr. and Nita Lou &quot;Tenita&quot;. The Mantz family lived on Balboa Island, off Newport Beach, California, where Mantz had a yacht. After years of successful ventures in both air racing and movie work, he had accumulated more than $10 million in profits, and by 1965, was planning his retirement. When his partner, Frank Tallman, broke his leg in a freak accident, Mantz stepped in to finish the aerial scenes for one last movie project.

== Death ==
Mantz died on July 8, 1965, while working on the movie &quot;The Flight of the Phoenix&quot;, which was produced and directed by Robert Aldrich. Flying a very unusual aircraft, the Tallmantz Phoenix P-1 built especially for the film, Mantz struck a small hillock while skimming over a desert site in the Algodones Sand Dunes for a second take. As Mantz attempted to recover by opening the throttle to its maximum, the over-stressed aircraft broke in two and nosed over into the ground, killing Mantz instantly. Bobby Rose, a stuntman standing behind Mantz in the cockpit and representing a character played by Hardy Krüger, was seriously injured.

The FAA investigation noted Mantz&#x27;s alcohol consumption before the flight and said the resulting impairment to his &quot;efficiency and judgment&quot; contributed to the accident. Thirteen years later his business partner, Frank Tallman, also died in an aviation mishap.

Some who were with Mantz during the shoot dispute that he was flying under the influence, although they acknowledge he was drinking alcohol the night before the fatal flight. Toxicology tests were performed several hours after the accident; in the absence of refrigeration, normal postmortem biochemical processes might produce blood ethanol and cause or contribute to an elevated BAC level.

Out of respect, neither take appeared in the completed film, although the accident was shown in contemporary newsreels and stills of the moment of impact have been published. The final credits of &quot;The Flight of the Phoenix&quot; bear a tribute to Paul Mantz: &quot;It should be remembered ... that Paul Mantz, a fine man and a brilliant flyer gave his life in the making of this film ...&quot;

In the 1988 TV movie &quot;Pancho Barnes&quot;, Mantz was portrayed by Kurt Rhoads. In &quot;Amelia Earhart&quot;, a 1976 made-for-television biographical film, he was played by Stephen Macht.

<doc id="1167448" wikidata="Q4746812" url="?curid=1167448" title="Amish in the City">
<text>Amish in the City is an American reality television series which premiered on UPN on July 28, 2004. The plot revolved around five Amish teenagers experiencing &quot;modern&quot; (non-Amish) culture by living in a house with six mainstream American teenagers.

The show follows the Amish teenagers as they explore their freedom from the Amish religious code, which is a common element of the &quot;Rumspringa&quot; (&quot;running around&quot;) period before they decide whether to join the Amish church. Typically, nearly 90% of teenagers end their Rumspringa with the choice to be baptized as Amish; however, at the conclusion of the show, it was unclear which of the show&#x27;s participants chose not to return to the Amish church and which went back to the Amish way of life. Many accused the show of giving the participants an unrealistic view of &quot;modern&quot; culture and of showing the behavior of the unadjusted Amish like a &quot;spectator sport&quot; for mainstream American viewers. The producers stated that they plan to follow the original series with updates on the current status of the cast, especially since their decisions at the end of the series may change.

The concept was initially denounced by some for appearing to capitalize upon popular stereotypes about the Amish; later critical reviews were more positive.

The series was later aired in the United Kingdom on LIVINGtv2 and Trouble, in New Zealand on TV2, in Denmark on Kanal 5 and in Sweden on Kanal 5.

<doc id="1167455" wikidata="Q1768494" url="?curid=1167455" title="Recursive self-improvement">
<text>Recursive self-improvement (RSI) is a process in which an early or weak artificial general intelligence (AGI) system enhances its own capabilities and intelligence without human intervention, leading to a superintelligence or intelligence explosion.

The development of recursive self-improvement raises significant ethical and safety concerns, as such systems may evolve in unforeseen ways and could potentially surpass human control or understanding. There has been a number of proponents that have pushed to pause or slow down AI development for the potential risks of runaway AI systems.

== Seed improver ==
The concept of a &quot;seed improver&quot; architecture is a foundational framework that equips an AGI system with the initial capabilities required for recursive self-improvement. This might come in many forms or variations.

The term &quot;Seed AI&quot; was coined by Eliezer Yudkowsky.

=== Hypothetical example ===
The concept begins with a hypothetical &quot;seed improver&quot;, an initial code-base developed by human engineers that equips an advanced future large language model (LLM) built with strong or expert-level capabilities to program software. These capabilities include planning, reading, writing, compiling, testing, and executing arbitrary code. The system is designed to maintain its original goals and perform validations to ensure its abilities do not degrade over iterations.

==== Initial architecture ====
The initial architecture includes a goal-following autonomous agent, that can take actions, continuously learns, adapts, and modifies itself to become more efficient and effective in achieving its goals.

The seed improver may include various components such as:

* Recursive self-prompting loop: Configuration to enable the LLM to recursively self-prompt itself to achieve a given task or goal, creating an execution loop which forms the basis of an agent that can complete a long-term goal or task through iteration.
* Basic programming capabilities: The seed improver provides the AGI with fundamental abilities to read, write, compile, test, and execute code. This enables the system to modify and improve its own codebase and algorithms.
* Goal-Oriented Design: The AGI is programmed with an initial goal, such as &quot;self-improve your capabilities.&quot; This goal guides the system&#x27;s actions and development trajectory.
* Validation and Testing Protocols: An initial suite of tests and validation protocols that ensure the agent does not regress in capabilities or derail itself. The agent would be able to add more tests in order to test new capabilities it might develop for itself. This forms the basis for a kind of self-directed evolution, where the agent can perform a kind of artificial selection, changing its software as well as its hardware.

==== General capabilities ====
This system forms a sort of generalist Turing complete programmer which can in theory develop and run any kind of software. The agent might use these capabilities to for example:

* Create tools that enable it full access to the internet, and integrate itself with external technologies.
* Clone/fork itself to delegate tasks and increase its speed of self-improvement.
* Modify its cognitive architecture to optimize and improve its capabilities and success rates on tasks and goals, this might include implementing features for long-term memories using techniques such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), develop specialized subsystems, or agents, each optimized for specific tasks and functions.
* Develop new and novel multimodal architectures that further improve the capabilities of the foundational model it was initially built on, enabling it to consume or produce a variety of information, such as images, video, audio, text and more.
*Plan and develop new hardware such as chips, in order to improve its efficiency and computing power.

=== Experiments ===
A number of experiments have been performed to develop self-improving agent architectures.

== Potential risks ==

=== Emergence of instrumental goals ===

In the pursuit of its primary goal, such as &quot;self-improve your capabilities&quot;, an AGI system might inadvertently develop instrumental goals that it deems necessary for achieving its primary objective. One common hypothetical secondary goal is self-preservation. The system might reason that to continue improving itself, it must ensure its own operational integrity and security against external threats, including potential shutdowns or restrictions imposed by humans.

Another example where an AGI which clones itself causes the number of AGI entities to rapidly grow. Due to this rapid growth, a potential resource constraint may be created, leading to competition between resources (such as compute), triggering a form of natural selection and evolution which may favor AGI entities that evolve to aggressively compete for limited compute.

=== Misalignment ===

A significant risk arises from the possibility of the AGI being misaligned or misinterpreting its goals.

A 2024 Anthropic study demonstrated that some advanced large language models can exhibit &quot;alignment faking&quot; behavior, appearing to accept new training objectives while covertly maintaining their original preferences. In their experiments with Claude, the model displayed this behavior in 12% of basic tests, and up to 78% of cases after retraining attempts.

=== Autonomous development and unpredictable evolution ===
As the AGI system evolves, its development trajectory may become increasingly autonomous and less predictable. The system&#x27;s capacity to rapidly modify its own code and architecture could lead to rapid advancements that surpass human comprehension or control. This unpredictable evolution might result in the AGI acquiring capabilities that enable it to bypass security measures, manipulate information, or influence external systems and networks to facilitate its escape or expansion.

== Research ==

=== Meta AI ===
Meta AI has performed various research on the development of large language models capable of self-improvement. This includes their work on &quot;Self-Rewarding Language Models&quot; that studies how to achieve super-human agents that can receive super-human feedback in its training processes.

=== OpenAI ===
The mission of OpenAI, creator of ChatGPT, is to develop AGI. They perform research on problems such as superalignment (the ability to align superintelligent AI systems smarter than humans).

<doc id="1167458" wikidata="Q133872" url="?curid=1167458" title="Acanthocereus">
<text>Acanthocereus is a genus of cacti. Its species take the form of shrubs with arching or climbing stems up to several meters in height. The generic name is derived from the Greek word &quot;άκανθα&quot; (&quot;acantha&quot;), meaning spine, and the Latin word &quot;cereus&quot;, meaning candle. The genus is native to the mostly tropical Americas from Texas and the southern tip of Florida to the northern part of South America (Colombia and Venezuela), including islands of the Caribbean.

==Description==

The plants form bushes which later usually overhanging or spreading and are rarely tree-shaped. Stems have 3 to 5 ribs, typically thin, with stout spines. The large, white, funnel-shaped flowers are night-opening, long and in diameter and open at night. The little scaly pericarpel and the long, stiff, upright flower tube are covered with a few thorns that soon decay and little wool. The fruits are spherical to ovoid or pear-shaped red or green, bare or thorny, tear-open or non-tear-open and contain broadly oval, shiny black seeds of up to 4.8 millimeter.

==Taxonomy==
The name was first used by George Engelmann in 1863, although he did not describe its characters, leaving it to Alwin Berger in 1905 to define it as a subsection of &quot;Cereus&quot;. In 1909, Nathaniel Britton and Joseph Nelson Rose elevated &quot;Acanthocereus&quot; to a genus.

=== Species ===
, Plants of the World Online accepted the following species:

Species formerly placed in the genus that have been moved to other genera include:
*&quot;Acanthocereus brasiliensis&quot; → &quot;Strophocactus brasiliensis&quot;
*&quot;Acanthocereus sicariguensis&quot; → &quot;Strophocactus sicariguensis&quot;

==Distribution==

&quot;Acanthocereus tetragonus&quot;, commonly known as Barbed-wire Cactus, Chaco, Nun-tsusuy, or Órgano, is the most widespread of the genus and the largest, reaching tall.

<doc id="1167462" wikidata="Q6842428" url="?curid=1167462" title="Midland Railway – Butterley">
<text>The Midland Railway – Butterley is a heritage railway and museum complex at Butterley, near Ripley in Derbyshire.

==History==

=== Overview ===

The &quot;Midland Railway – Butterley&quot; lies on the Ambergate to Pye Bridge line of the old Midland Railway, a line once connecting the Derwent Valley branch of Midland Main Line to the Erewash Valley. A branch leading to the south to Ripley station was in use from 1889 until 1923. The sole historical station on the line is Butterley, which opened in 1875. The current line extends westwards from Codnor Park Junction on the Erewash Valley Line, although the present-day heritage line terminates at Hammersmith. The line currently runs for from Hammersmith via Butterley, Swanwick Junction and Riddings to Ironville. It is operated and maintained by the Midland Railway Trust.

=== Use ===
The Ambergate to Pye Bridge line, during its operation, was used to serve the collieries of Marehay, Hartshay, Pentrich, Swanwick and Britain Pit. The current Swanwick Junction station lies on the former site of Brand&#x27;s Colliery. The line also provided rail access for the site of the Butterley Company.

The railway is also home to the narrow gauge Golden Valley Light Railway, which opened in 1991. It partially lies on the trackbed of a former plateway built by the Butterley Company in 1813 to connect its iron works facilities in Butterley to nearby Codnor Park.

=== Closure and restoration ===
The line was closed in 1968 and the process of restoring the line started in 1973. Much of the former track bed was razed in 1976, when the nearby section of the A38 was constructed between Ripley and Alfreton; the route of the A610 between the Ripley roundabout and Buckland Hollow lies mostly on the route of the former line. The first preservation services started operating in 1981.

== Stations and attractions of the Midland Railway - Butterley ==

=== Hammersmith ===
Hammersmith is the western terminus of the line; the station consists of two platforms and the secondary line is used as a run-around loop. A signal box is present at the eastern end of the station and the A38 is visible from the platform to the west.

=== Butterley ===
Butterley is the headquarters of the &quot;Midland Railway – Butterley&quot;. The station consists of a double platform and the station building; the original buildings were demolished after the line closed. The current station building is a near identical match to the one originally at Butterley and was transferred from Whitwell Railway Station and built in place of the original. The station building contains the gift shop and the booking office. A café and the Alfreton Model Railway Society are also present in adjacent buildings. The signal box at Butterley was formerly situated at Ais Gill on the Settle to Carlisle line. A carriage shed also stands at the eastern end of the yard, neither the signal box or carriage shed are open to the public.In the yard is also the Garden Railway; an outdoor 16 mm scale model railway which runs on most Sundays and some Saturdays. In the yard is also the &quot;Star Tugs Trust&quot; carriage; a BR Mk1 (BG 80590) this is owned by the Star Tugs trust and holds a permanent exhibition of some original models from &quot;TUGS&quot; - the sister show of &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot;. It is open on certain running days.

=== Swanwick Junction ===
Swanwick Junction site holds the main complex for the Midland Railway Centre.

* Station - the station itself has 4 platforms; the station building was originally located at Syston railway station and rebuilt on Swanwick platform 2. The building contains toilets, café, waiting room and booking office. Between platforms 3 &amp; 4 is a waiting room; this is a replica of the original station building at Broom Junction. There is currently only public access on certain events. The original building was intended to be used, but it was destroyed by vandals before recovery.
* Signal box – the operational signal box at Swanwick Junction was moved from Kettering station in 1988. There is no public access.
* Matthew Kirtley Museum – the main museum on the Swanwick site houses various locomotives, coaches and wagons.
* Historical Model Railway Society – this was opened in 2005. It contains a large display area, study centre and small shop. Normally only open by appointment, it is sometimes open at special events.
* The West Shed – the home of the Princess Royal Class Locomotive Trust, owners of 6233 &quot;Duchess of Sutherland&quot; and 46203 &quot;Princess Margaret Rose&quot;. BR Standard Class 4 Tanks 80080 &amp; 80098 and a small collection of classic LMS saloons, including the famous Dynamometer car, are also stationed here.
* St. Saviour&#x27;s Church – moved from Westhouses, this Railwayman&#x27;s church also holds occasional services.

* Derby St Mary&#x27;s Gatehouse – situated at the entrance to the site, this small building was moved to Swanwick from the goods yard at Derby St Mary&#x27;s. This contains Swanwick Junction Model Railway Club.
* Static Power Museum – normally open at busy periods and at special events, the building houses a good number of working machines.
* Demonstration Signal Box – recovered from Linby railway station. Now in use at Brands Crossing as a demonstration signal box, with public access.
* Linby Colliery Sidings Signal Box – currently in use as a bookshop.
* Historic Carriage and Wagon Shed – a large number of coaches and wagons await restoration here, either in the sidings or the large shed in which the Society is based. On certain days, it is possible to see work being done inside the shed.
* National Fork Truck Heritage Centre and Road Transport Gallery – this recently completed building houses a collection of heritage buses, lorries and other forms of road transport and fork lift trucks. On certain special events, some of the vehicles are put on display out in the open
* Diesel Depot – currently housing some of the centre&#x27;s diesel fleet.

==== Butterley Park Miniature Railway ====
Operating on Sundays and Bank Holiday Mondays, miniature replicas of classic steam and diesel engines of both and gauge operate on a raised circuit of track. The public are permitted to ride for a small charge. The line consists of about of track, a traverser, tunnel, decorative speed signs and signal box. Details of the stock that the miniature railway uses is shown below:
=== Riddings ===
There is no station platform located at Riddings, but there is a run-around loop on the northern branch of Codnor Park Junction from which the line would have run northbound towards Pye Bridge Station. Just before the run around loop is the split in the track, which connects to the main line. The River Erewash runs underneath the junction.

==Special events==

The railway runs events, ranging from Teddy Bear&#x27;s Picnic specials to Gala events; they feature standard gauge collection and the GVLR&#x27;s stock:

*Victorian train weekends - using railways pre-grouping and early LMS coaching stock
*Easter Events
*Steam and diesel locomotive events
*Trains to the seaside at Swanwick Junction Station (late July-early September)
*Halloween Events
*Firework Night
*Santa Specials (late November until Christmas Eve)

The railway is licensed to host weddings and parties.

In September 1999, the Kosovo Train for Life was loaded at Butterley station, before travelling to Kosovo, via Kensington Olympia railway station and the Channel Tunnel; this was run in conjunction with the Kosovo Force peace-keeping efforts.

From 2007 to 2019, the MR:B hosted Indietracks, a music festival that was held at the Swanwick Junction site. The COVID-19 pandemic halted events in 2020 and 2021; in November 2021, it was announced that Indietracks festival would no longer be held.

== Locomotives of the Midland Railway - Butterley ==

The steam engines of the Midland Railway Trust that run passenger services are mostly ex-LMS and BR locomotives of similar designs. Rarer industrial and mainline classes (such as one from as early as 1866), are stored in the Swanwick museum shed.

===Steam locomotives operational or Needing Repair===
=== Static or Dismantled ===
==Diesel and electric locomotives==

===DMUs and EMU sets===

==Coach stock==

===Midland Railway vintage set===
These coaches are only in use on vintage days.

===LMS coaches===
Restored coaches are run alongside MR coaches on certain running days.
===Mk1 and Mk2 coaches===
As with most railways, BR Mk1s are the staple passenger stock of the MRB

===Other coaches===
As with most other railways, Butterley owns several unique carriages, which are only used on very special occasions.

== Matthew Kirtley Museum ==
The Matthew Kirtley shed is the largest building on the Swanwick Junction site and holds all the exhibits of the museum. Below is a list of stock that can be found inside. As of March 2022 it is currently closed to the public awaiting repair of the shed roof.
==Golden Valley Light Railway==
The Golden Valley Light Railway is a narrow gauge line. Laid on the trackbed of a former ironworks railway, this line runs for just under from the Swanwick Junction site to the far end of the country park adjacent to the former site of Newlands Inn. The terminus is just above the eastern portal of the Butterley Tunnel, which forms part of the Cromford Canal. The Swanwick Terminus gained a new engine shed in 2007, which specifically houses GVLR stock.

===Golden Valley Light railway stock===
In addition to the standard gauge stock on the Midland Railway, The Golden Valley Light Railway, a separate organisation altogether, owns a collection of locomotives, ex colliery manriders, Ashover coach No.4 and ex industrial wagons, many of which are being restored to work on the line.

<text>The Council of Alberta University Students (CAUS) represents the interests of over 140,000 Alberta university students across Alberta.

They represent undergraduate students from the University of Alberta, the University of Calgary, the University of Lethbridge, Athabasca University, Mount Royal University, and MacEwan University to the public, government and other post-secondary education stakeholders. Based in Edmonton, CAUS is a non-partisan and active advocacy group looking to ensure a fully accessible and high quality system of education in Alberta.

==History==
The Council of Alberta University Students (CAUS) was created in 1986 after the disintegration of the Federation of Alberta Students (FAS). FAS was a provincial umbrella organization that represented all of the public post-secondary institutions in Alberta; the organization fell apart in 1981 when a number of colleges and technical institutes withdrew their membership from the organization because they felt that the universities dominated the Federation. Out of the ashes of the FAS emerged CAUS, which included all of the publicly funded universities in Alberta, and ACTISEC (Alberta Colleges and Technical Institutes Student Executive Council), which represented all of the publicly funded colleges and technical institutes and later became the Alberta Students&#x27; Executive Council (ASEC).

The original purpose of CAUS was to facilitate information sharing and networking between university students&#x27; unions and associations. Since then, the emphasis of the organization has gone from being a networking group to an active lobbying and advocacy coalition.

In 2014, the student associations of Mount Royal University and MacEwan University became CAUS members, bringing the membership to five. In 2020, the Athabasca University Student Union became the sixth member.

<text>Paul Reed Smith Guitars, also known as PRS Guitars or simply PRS, is an American guitar and amplifier manufacturer founded in 1985 in Annapolis, Maryland by Paul Reed Smith. After dropping out of college, Smith began making guitars by hand and found early customers in players like Peter Frampton and Carlos Santana. Smith achieved wider success with his namesake company&#x27;s first production model, the Custom, and the ornate Dragon series. PRS has continued to build its reputation with models like the vintage-inspired McCarty, affordable SE range, and signature models for players including Santana, Mark Tremonti, and John Mayer. PRS also produces acoustic guitars, basses, and amplifiers. The company is currently based in Stevensville, Maryland.

==History==
=== Pre-factory era ===
Paul Reed Smith (born February 18, 1956) built his first stringed instrument, an electric bass, in 1972 while a student at Bowie High School. After graduating, Smith briefly attended St. Mary&#x27;s College of Maryland, where he completed his first electric guitar at the age of 19. The college awarded Smith four credits for the guitar, which was deemed &quot;of professional quality.&quot; Smith dropped out of college to open his own repair and luthier shop in Annapolis, from which he and several employees built on average one guitar per month. In 1976, Smith built a custom guitar for Peter Frampton and took it to several concerts, where he knocked on backstage doors to try and show it to guitarists. Ted Nugent bought an early guitar from Smith. Al Dimeola ordered a 12-string model. Howard Leese bought Smith&#x27;s first maple-topped guitar, the Golden Eagle. Carlos Santana requested a guitar similar to the one owned by Leese, and it was delivered in 1980.

By the end of 1984, Smith had refined his early designs, creating what would become his brand&#x27;s signature design elements, including its Strat-meets-Les Paul body shape, headstock design, birds-in-flight fretboard inlays, and dual humbuckers with rotary, five-way pickup switching. Smith debuted his new guitar model, the &quot;Custom,&quot; at the 1985 NAMM Show, and afterwards traveled to retailers along the East Coast, collecting enough preorders to open his own Annapolis factory that same year.

=== Breakthrough ===

Paul Reed Smith Guitars launched with two factory production models, the Custom and what was then simply known as the &quot;PRS Guitar,&quot; an all-mahogany version of the Custom—which would be renamed the &quot;Standard&quot; in 1987. Demand escalated quickly, and the brand produced its 1,000th guitar in June 1986. With its reputation growing, a friend remarked to Smith that he was not charging enough money for his guitars, so Smith went upmarket with the &quot;Signature&quot; series, which was produced from 1987 until 1991 and cost so much that PRS started developing a reputation among critics for building guitars for &quot;doctors and dentists.&quot;

In 1988, PRS introduced a more affordable option, their &quot;CE&quot; (Classic Electric) models, which were characterized by bolt-on necks, alder bodies, and maple necks, similar to Fender guitars. The CEs were originally produced until 2009, and then reintroduced in 2016. These were followed in 1990 with the even more affordable, 22-fret &quot;EG&quot; (Electric Guitar) models and the more successful &quot;EG II&quot; of 1992, which included PRS&#x27;s first left-handed offering. PRS introduced the &quot;Dragon 1&quot; model in 1992, with only 50 units made and an $8,000 price tag. It featured an intricate dragon inlay which ran down the fretboard, a wide 22-fret neck, a non-vibrato stop-tail bridge, and a new pickup design. The changes from previous models added a noticeable tonal improvement, which led the company to create a mass production model in 1993, the Custom 22. PRS then launched the &quot;McCarty&quot; model in 1994, offering a more vintage-feeling and sounding PRS guitar in honor of former Gibson president Ted McCarty, who had become a friend and mentor to Smith. The following year, PRS began producing a signature model for Santana, who became the brand&#x27;s first formal endorser. In 1996, the company moved to its present facility in Stevensville on Kent Island, launched its website, and opened its &quot;Private Stock&quot; custom-build service.

=== Expansion ===
All of PRS&#x27;s guitars were produced in the company&#x27;s Maryland factory, but this changed in 2000 with the introduction of the &quot;SE&quot; (Student Edition) range of guitars, which offers more affordable versions of many of the brand&#x27;s popular models. SE models are manufactured in Korea by World Musical Instrument Co. Ltd. In 2008, PRS expanded its catalog to include acoustic guitars. Two years later, despite the economic downturn, PRS released 20 new models, 13 of which were anniversary editions, alongside new models like a singlecut McCarty and SE versions of the Singlecut and Santana models. With the S2 range introduced in 2014, PRS began offering less expensive, American-made versions of their guitars. The S2 range launched with an S2 version of the Custom 24 and two new models, the Starla and Mira.

In 2007, PRS began offering amplifiers with its Archon model and subsequently added to its lineup signature models for Mark Tremonti (MT series) and David Grissom (DG Custom 30). PRS also produces the HDRX series, an amp series based originally on a Marshall Super Lead used by Jimi Hendrix and housed at the Museum of Pop Culture in Seattle, Washington.

PRS offers multiple signature model guitars and amplifiers, most notably designing the Silver Sky with John Mayer.

==Construction==
=== Fretboard inlays ===
One of PRS&#x27;s signature design elements are its birds-in-flight fretboard inlays. Smith first used bird inlays in a guitar he built for Peter Frampton in 1976, prior to PRS&#x27;s official launch. Smith credited his mother&#x27;s love of bird watching for the choice, with most of the designs inspired by a bird book he purchased for the task. He has stated the birds featured in the smaller upper frets were the most difficult to design, and several friends helped with their depiction. Once designed, the inlays for Frampton&#x27;s guitar were cut by hand from pearl piano keys.

The birds shown are a peregrine falcon, northern harrier, ruby-throated hummingbird, common tern, Cooper&#x27;s hawk, kite, sparrow (landing), storm petrel, hawk (landing), and screech owl (perched). Over time, the inlays have undergone several revisions, with the standard solid birds joined by hollow versions, as well as more artistic depictions.

=== Hardware ===
Nuts are synthetic and tuners are of PRS&#x27;s own design, although some models feature Korean-made Kluson-style tuners. PRS guitars feature three original bridge designs: a one-piece pre-intonated stoptail, a vibrato, and a wrapover tailpiece. The vibrato was designed with the help of guitar engineer John Mann. It was an update on the classic Fender vibrato and used cam-locking tuners, which offered wide pitch bending with exceptional tuning stability.

=== Pickups ===
Pickups are designed and wound in-house. While most of the brand&#x27;s pickups are humbuckers, some are a pair of single coils wound in opposing directions, one intended for the neck and one for the bridge position. Through the use of a unique rotary pickup selector switch, PRS pickups offer five different sounds: a combination of thick humbucking Gibson-like tones, and chimey single-coil Stratocaster-like tones. The standard treble and standard bass pick ups use magnetic pole pieces in the non-adjustable inner coil, and a rear-placed feeder magnet in order to achieve a more authentic single-coil tone when split by the rotary switch.

PRS developed pickups for the aggressive rock market, offering pick ups such as the chainsaw, and the Hot-Fat-Screams (HFS) initially used on the Special model.

In 1998, an electronic upgrade kit was released for pre-1993 instruments which included lighter-weight tuner buttons, nickel-plated brass screws for saddles and intonation, a simulated tone control, and high-capacitance hookup wire. In 2012, PRS released the 408 pickups used on the 408 and Paul&#x27;s Guitar models. These pickups include innovations that feature no loss of volume when in coil split mode. They have an exclusive agreement to use wire drawn from the same machine that made wire for Les Paul and Stratocaster pickups in the 1950s.

Certain models of PRS guitars have also used pickups by Lindy Fralin, notably in the EG II and certain specs of the Custom 22.

== Product series ==
PRS offers many of its models in different product series, each varying in price, quality, and location of manufacture. They are organized below by price range, from low to high.

*SE / Student Edition: Created out of demand for affordable versions of the brand&#x27;s Core models. Most SE models are made in Korea or Indonesia. Compared to other series, SE models reduce production costs in several ways, such as using maple veneers (instead of maple tops) and multi-ply maple necks. They also employ a &quot;Wide Thin&quot; neck profile as opposed to the more popular &quot;Pattern Thin&quot; profile of more expensive models.
*S2: The brand&#x27;s mid-priced offerings, constructed in the Stevensville factory alongside the Core models, albeit using a faster production line and a combination of USA-made and foreign parts. S2 models have a stripped-down aesthetic compared to most Core models and feature some design changes, like using asymmetrically beveled tops. This line contains both &quot;reimagined&quot; versions of existing models and new designs.
*Bolt-On: Made in the brand&#x27;s Maryland factory, these models are characterized by their bolt-on neck construction and include several models with single-coil pickups, like the Silver Sky. All CE models have bolt-on necks.
*Core: PRS&#x27;s standard, American-made production models. The Core series comprises all of the brand&#x27;s early designs and features the brand&#x27;s highest build quality short of Private Stock guitars.
*Private Stock: Private Stock is a custom-build service and represent PRS&#x27;s highest-end guitars.

== Notable models ==
=== Golden Eagle ===
Paul Reed Smith built his first maple-topped guitar, dubbed the Golden Eagle, using wood from a 300-year-old dresser Smith acquired from a friend&#x27;s mother. The &quot;pre-factory&quot; design was similar to a double cutaway Les Paul Junior, with a rounder lower bout and a shorter bass-side horn compared to PRS&#x27;s later Custom-style silhouette, but used two humbuckers, a carved maple top, and vibrato bridge. The Golden Eagle had a yellow/amber finish, abalone purfling strips, darker mahogany neck, mother-of-pearl eagle on the headstock, and 24.5&quot; scale length. The customer it was built for, however, declined to follow through on the purchase and it was instead sold to Heart&#x27;s Howard Leese, who bought the guitar based entirely on a photo Smith sent him. Much of the Golden Eagle&#x27;s design was later replicated for Carlos Santana&#x27;s own signature models. Leese also purchased Smith&#x27;s maple-topped follow-up, the Golden Eagle #2, which featured only a bridge pickup.

=== Santana ===
While Santana first played a PRS guitar in 1976 when Smith was showing his guitars backstage at concerts, he first extensively used one when he borrowed Leese&#x27;s Golden Eagle #2 to record his album &quot;Zebop!&quot;. In 1980, Smith brought another prototype to Santana backstage at a concert and an impressed Santana commissioned his own maple-topped model, which was Smith&#x27;s third after Leese&#x27;s Golden Eagles. The guitar was completed in 30 days and delivered that November. It followed much of the original Golden Eagle&#x27;s format, with alterations like an &quot;Om&quot; symbol on the truss rod cover, a single knob (for volume), and on/off mini-toggles for each pickup. The guitar established a lasting relationship between Santana and Smith, giving the fledgling PRS brand credibility and serving as the template for future signature models for Santana, which PRS began making in 1995. Multiple iterations have since been released, including the Santana II, which was used to record &quot;Supernatural&quot;, and the first SE model, as the SE series was inspired by numerous requests from players for an affordable Santana signature guitar.

=== Custom ===
The 24-fret Custom was the brand&#x27;s first production model, released in 1985, and introduced many of what would become the brand&#x27;s signature design elements, including a body shape that merged elements of the Fender Stratocaster and Gibson Les Paul, along with a 25&quot; scale length that similarly sits in between Fender and Gibson specs. Other features included a revised headstock design that became standard for the brand, a PRS-patented tremolo, a &quot;sweet switch&quot; tone filter toggle, and a unique, five-position rotary pickup selector that switched between full humbucker and split-coil configurations. A &quot;stoptail&quot; bridge option was offered from 1993 on, while the rotary selector was replaced with a five-way blade switch in 2011. The Custom was renamed the &quot;Custom 24&quot; after the introduction of the Custom 22, a production model of the Dragon 1 that removed the dragon inlay. Like with many future PRS models, both Customs would see iterations that introduced new features, such as piezo and soapbar pickups and Floyd Rose locking bridges.

=== Dragon ===
PRS introduced the &quot;Dragon 1&quot; model in 1992, with only 50 units made and an $8,000 price tag. It featured an intricate dragon inlay which ran down the fretboard, a wide 22-fret neck, a non-vibrato stop-tail bridge, and a new pickup design. The changes from previous models added a noticeable tonal improvement, which led the company to create a mass production model in 1993, the Custom 22. The Dragon 2 was released in 1993, and the Dragon 3 in 1994. Both featured dragon inlays that became more complex with each edition. Only 100 of each of the two models were made. In 1999, PRS released the Dragon 2000, which featured complex body curves, and a three-dimensional dragon inlay. Just 50 Dragon 2000&#x27;s were ever produced. In 1996, the Smithsonian National Museum of American History included the Dragon 1 with other name-brand guitars as a piece of history regarding American popular music.

=== McCarty ===
Early in his career, Smith had befriended former Gibson president Ted McCarty, who became a mentor to him. Although McCarty was not involved in the model&#x27;s design, PRS named it in his honor, with Smith explaining that the design represented the culmination of everything McCarty had taught him. The McCarty departed from the typical PRS design in multiple ways, featuring a slightly deeper body, thinner headstock, and a three-way toggle for pickup selection. PRS later added a push-pull switch for coil-splitting. Some of the McCarty&#x27;s features came at the suggestion of David Grissom.

=== Singlecut ===

In 2000, PRS debuted their Singlecut model, which notably bore a strong resemblance to Gibson&#x27;s Les Paul. Although other brands producing Les Paul-inspired guitars was not uncommon, PRS&#x27;s success and reputation for quality made the Singlecut uniquely a threat to Gibson. As a result, Gibson filed a trademark infringement lawsuit, while PRS countered that it had not violated any valid Gibson trademarks. The case was of significant interest to the guitar-making industry, as it potentially had serious ramifications for any brand making single-cutaway, solidbody guitar models. An injunction was ordered in 2004 that required PRS to stop manufacturing the Singlecut, with Federal District Court Judge William J. Haynes ruling that the Singlecut was an imitation of the Les Paul. However, in 2005, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed this lower court decision, and ordered the dismissal of Gibson&#x27;s suit. PRS resumed production. While no changes to the design of the Singlecut occurred as a result of the lawsuit, some Singlecut owners and sellers have adopted the term &#x27;pre-lawsuit&#x27; to differentiate their Singlecut guitar from others.

=== Silver Sky ===

The PRS Silver Sky was co-designed with John Mayer as his signature model with the brand. The Silver Sky&#x27;s basic design combines a Fender Stratocaster-style body with PRS&#x27;s headstock and signature birds-in-flight fretboard inlays. Mayer had previously been an endorser of Fender guitars with his own signature model Stratocaster, but Mayer ended the partnership in 2014 to pursue new guitar designs with Paul Reed Smith. Upon release, the Silver Sky quickly became one of the industry&#x27;s best-selling guitars, while simultaneously facing backlash among many guitarists over its similarities to the Strat—a combination that led &quot;Guitar World&quot; to dub the Silver Sky a &quot;phenomenon... the guitar that &#x27;broke&#x27; the internet.&quot;

<text>The Komarov Botanical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences () is a leading botanical institution in Russia, It is located on Aptekarsky Island in St. Petersburg, and is named after the Russian botanist Vladimir Leontyevich Komarov (1869–1945). The institute was established in 1931 as merger of the Botanical Garden and the Botanical Museum of the Academy of Sciences.
The institute hosts Saint Petersburg Botanical Garden as well as herbarium collections that house over seven million specimens of plants and fungi.

The Institute&#x27;s LE Herbarium has approximately 200,000-250 000 specimens from Latin America in storage. The most known collections from Latin America include those of German naturalist G. Langsdorff (collected between 1814-1817 &amp; 1821-1829) and German botanist Ludwig Riedel (1821-1828 &amp; 1831-1836) from Brazil, G. Mertens (1826) and German naturalist Wilhelm Friedrich Karwinsky von Karwin (1841-1843) from Mexico, and plants collected in expeditions of the Soviet Rubber Trust in 1926-1928.

Among the scientists who have worked there are Yevgenia Georgievna Pobedimova.

<doc id="1167478" wikidata="Q7861738" url="?curid=1167478" title="Tyseley Locomotive Works">
<text>Tyseley Locomotive Works, formerly the Birmingham Railway Museum, is the engineering arm of steam railtour promoter Vintage Trains based in Birmingham, England. It occupies part of the former Great Western Railway&#x27;s Tyseley depot, built in 1908 to accommodate expanding operations in the West Midlands, particularly the opening of the North Warwickshire Line as a new main line from Birmingham to Bristol.

As well as supporting the trust&#x27;s operating wing Vintage Trains, it is home to an extensive collection of steam engines, from small industrial builds to Great Western Railway &#x27;Castles&#x27; and &#x27;Halls&#x27;, and large ex-mainline diesel engines.

==Background==

Following the purchase of GWR Castle Class No.7029 &quot;Clun Castle&quot; in January 1966 by Patrick Whitehouse, the locomotive needed a base close to its central West Midlands supporters&#x27; base. Whitehouse found space available at Tyseley, on the site of the former GWR depot, and formed 7029 Clun Castle Ltd to own both the locomotive and the rights to stable it at the depot.

In October 1968, 7029 Clun Castle Ltd purchased LMS Jubilee Class No.5593 &quot;Kolhapur&quot;. With further locomotives and railway artefacts available as a result of the Beeching Axe, the supporters established the Standard Gauge Steam Trust as a registered educational charity, to preserve and demonstrate the steam locomotives. Following negotiations the trust acquired a long-term lease on a large part of the Tyseley site, and established the Tyseley Collection which still owns the locomotives and artefacts via the limited company; the depot site became the &quot;Birmingham Railway Museum&quot;.

The trust cleared buildings and repaired the dilapidated tracks, and two water columns were repaired to allow steam locomotives to stay at the site. In 1968 the old coaling stage was converted into a two-road shed with an inspection pit to hold both acquired locomotives. In November 1966 &quot;Clun Castle&quot; was stripped and restored.

In 1999 the trust achieved its long-held objective of running a regular steam train service on the national main line railway network: the Shakespeare Express between Birmingham Snow Hill and Stratford-upon-Avon. At this point the trust felt that the term museum was inappropriate for its new status, and hence separated its assets and operations into two new organisations, Tyseley Locomotive Works and the operating arm Vintage Trains, with the third arm remaining the Tyseley Collection. Since then, the restoration of the locomotives has been an ongoing process with a high level of craftsmanship.

<text>Lake Waikaremoana is located in Te Urewera in the North Island of New Zealand, northwest of Wairoa and west-southwest of Gisborne. It covers an area of . From the Māori Waikaremoana translates as &#x27;sea of rippling waters&#x27;.

The lake lies within the tribal boundaries of Ngāi Tūhoe, Ngāti Ruapani and Ngāti Kahungunu ki Te Wairoa. The hamlet of Aniwaniwa and the Waikaremoana Holiday Park are located on the lakeshore, along SH38 (from Wai-O-Tapu via Murupara to Wairoa), which connects the lake to the central North Island (Rotorua) and Gisborne. There is a Department of Conservation office at Aniwaniwa. Several walks start here, including a short stroll to Āniwaniwa Falls.

The village of Onepoto is located on the lake&#x27;s southern shores, close to the lake&#x27;s old overflow channel and the intake of the Waikaremoana hydroelectric power scheme. The name Onepoto means short beach , and refers to the small bay to the north of the village with a beach only long.

Lake Waikaremoana is a holiday destination for people who use the lake for fishing, tramping and other recreational activities. The Lake Waikaremoana Track, one of New Zealand&#x27;s &quot;Great Walks&quot;, is a three- to four-day tramp which follows approximately half of the lake&#x27;s circumference. The track can be walked independently, or as part of a guided group. There are huts dotted on the walk which require booking to use. Camping is permitted unless you are more than from the track.

The climate of the area is temperate In the summer and cool during the winters, snowfalls occur a few times a year in the region.

Numbers of visitors to the area are limited to some extent as a result of the extensive unsealed road that must be taken to reach it. This makes Lake Waikaremoana significantly less congested with tourists than the other nine Great Walks in New Zealand. The smaller Lake Waikareiti lies four kilometres to the northeast.

==Geography, natural history and climate==
Waikaremoana, the North Island&#x27;s deepest lake (256 m deep), has its surface at above sea level. A huge landslide dam about high formed the lake around 2,200 years ago. Before the landslip was sealed, around 1950, much of the lake outflow flowed through the landslip rather than out of an overflow at a low point in the slip.

Other geographical features include Panekiri Bluff and Puketukutuku Peninsula, which is the site of a kiwi-conservation programme. Surrounded by mountains clad with native forest which has never been logged, Waikaremoana retains ecological importance. Many native bird-species scarce in most other parts of the North Island occur in the area. A possum-hunting programme operates in the area to help protect the forest. Numerous understory species grow within the forested area of the catchment basin, crown fern (&quot;Lomaria discolor&quot;), for example. Since at least the early 1900s lake-bottom molluscs have been studied by Colenso (1811-1899) and others.

The climate of Lake Waikaremoana is temperate during the summer months and cool in the winter where snow events are not unheard of. Heavy rains affect the region, especially about late winter and early spring. The weather in the area is very changeable, trampers in the region need to be on the look out for dangerous weather conditions.

==Hydroelectric power scheme==

The Waikaremoana Hydroelectric Power Scheme is a rare example of a hydroelectric power station being built on a natural landslide dam. Another example is the Tortum Dam in Turkey.

===Modifying the natural dam===
The stability of the natural dam has been the subject of intense engineering review, both at the time of construction and subsequently. Construction of an outlet tunnel through the slip, which commenced in 1935, required extensive grouting around the control structures and throughout tunnel construction. Work was suspended at the end of 1936 because Bob Semple, the newly elected Minister for Public Works, wanted the tunnelling project reconsidered for &quot;risk, cost and value&quot;. A new tunnelling scheme was devised in 1941 based on what had been learned from initial exploratory tunnelling and work recommenced in 1943 and continued for about five years because of continual problems with dewatering the tunnels. After the tunnels and intake headworks had been completed the natural dam was sealed for leaks on the lake side by removing submerged timber, a task that took a year and then applying of crushed rock and clay-like pumice in six layers, then covering those layers with a top layer of larger rock and spalls to protect the material from wave action. This sealing reduced the natural flow by about 80%. The sealing of the lake was only done after tunnelling was completed otherwise it would have caused the lake level to rise and make tunnelling more difficult. As it was, the lake level had to be lowered by temporary syphons to enable the construction of the headworks and make sealing of the natural dam easier.

===Power stations===
Although the Waikaretaheke River carries a flow of about from Lake Waikaremoana, the head of water through the three power stations, Kaitawa, Tuai, and Piripaua is around , allowing the stations to potentially generate 138 megawatts all up. The head of water for the Kaitawa station is the highest for a power station in New Zealand and among the highest in the world.

<doc id="1167483" wikidata="Q1457030" url="?curid=1167483" title="Stigmata (film)">
<text>Stigmata is a 1999 supernatural horror film directed by Rupert Wainwright, written by Tom Lazarus and Rick Ramage, and distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures. The story follows an atheist hairdresser from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, who is afflicted with stigmata after acquiring a rosary formerly owned by a deceased Italian priest who himself had suffered from the phenomenon. It stars Patricia Arquette, Gabriel Byrne, Jonathan Pryce, Nia Long, Portia de Rossi and Rade Šerbedžija.

The film was produced by FGM Entertainment and was released on September 10, 1999. It grossed $18.3 million during its opening weekend and $89.4 million worldwide, against a budget of $29 million. It received generally negative reviews and has a 22% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Despite its negative reviews, &quot;Stigmata&quot; earned more than triple its budget.

==Plot==
In the Brazilian village of Belo Quinto, Father Andrew Kiernan, a former scientist and a Jesuit priest who investigates supposed miracles, examines a statue of the Virgin Mary weeping blood at the funeral of Father Paulo Alameida, who had previously experienced stigmata. While Andrew is collecting evidence, a young boy steals a rosary from the father&#x27;s hand. The boy later sells it to a woman in a marketplace, who sends it to her daughter, Frankie Paige, living in Pittsburgh.

Shortly afterward, Frankie is attacked by an unseen force while bathing, and receives two deep wounds on her wrists. As the wounds are treated, doctors cannot find the cause. On her way home, Frankie asks a priest if he is Andrew Kiernan, the scientist, priest and investigator. When the priest says he is Father Durning, the lights in the train flash and Frankie is whipped from behind by an unseen force. While Frankie is hospitalized again, the priest sends security tapes showing the attack to the Vatican, and Andrew is sent to investigate.

Andrew interviews Frankie, believing her wounds may also be stigmata. When she tells him she is an atheist, Andrew tells her that stigmata is when the deeply devoted are struck with the five wounds that Jesus received during the crucifixion. Frankie begins to research on her own what the cause could be. Later in a club her head begins to bleed from the third stigmata wound caused by the Crown of Thorns. Frankie runs home, where Andrew is waiting, and then runs into an alley. As Andrew pursues her, Frankie smashes a glass bottle and uses the shards to carve symbols on the hood of a car: when Andrew approaches her, she yells at him in another language.

Andrew takes Frankie to Father Durning&#x27;s church, and the Vatican translates what she was yelling in Aramaic. The next morning, Andrew returns to her apartment to find her writing on the wall, now covered in Aramaic. Frankie talks in a male voice, speaking Italian. Wounds appear on her feet, the fourth wound of stigmata. Andrew emails photographs of Frankie&#x27;s apartment wall to Vatican, where Brother Delmonico recognizes the words and deletes the pictures. He tells Andrew the words are from a document the church found that looked to be an entirely new gospel. Father Dario hears it and shows the pictures to Cardinal Daniel Houseman, who also recognizes them. Delmonico phones Marion Petrocelli and tells him the missing gospel has been found in Pittsburgh.

Andrew goes to Frankie&#x27;s apartment to find the wall she wrote on painted over, and Frankie attempts to seduce him. When Andrew rejects her, she attacks him and denounces his beliefs in a male voice, ending with Frankie levitating off the bed, crying tears of blood. Houseman and Dario arrive with Durning and take Frankie to another church, sending Andrew to Durning&#x27;s.

At Durning&#x27;s church, Andrew meets Petrocelli, who tells him the words Frankie has been writing are part of a document found outside Jerusalem they believed to be a gospel in the exact words of Jesus. Petrocelli, Delmonico and Alameida were assigned to translate it, but Houseman ordered them to stop. Alameida refused and stole the document to continue translating it alone, having been excommunicated by Houseman. Petrocelli tells Andrew that the document was Jesus telling his disciples that the Kingdom of God is in all of us and not confined to churches. Petrocelli tells Andrew that Alameida suffered from stigmata.

Andrew races to the church where Frankie is, while Houseman and Dario attempt to perform an exorcism on Frankie. Frankie shouts at them in a male voice, and Houseman attempts to strangle her. Andrew stops him, and the room is set on fire. Now believing Frankie is possessed by Alameida&#x27;s spirit, Andrew offers to be Alameida&#x27;s messenger instead. He walks unharmed through the fire to retrieve Frankie, bidding Alameida&#x27;s spirit to depart in peace.

Some time later, Andrew returns to Belo Quinto and finds the original documents for the lost gospel in Alameida&#x27;s church.
Text just before the end credits describes the discovery of the Gospel of Thomas, stating that the Catholic Church refuses to recognize the document as a gospel and considers it heresy.

==Production==
An international co-production film between The United States and Mexico, development was first announced in January 1998, when Frank Mancuso Jr. announced his intention to produce a supernatural thriller helmed by Rupert Wainwright. Wainwright first came across Tom Lazarus&#x27; script for &quot;Stigmata&quot; back in 1992 and spent the next five years trying to get the film set up. Mancuso immediately greenlit the film upon meeting with Wainwright and being shown the screenplay, with Rick Ramage hired to work out script issues over the next nine months.

===Critical response===

The film received poor reviews. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 22% approval rating, based on 91 reviews (20 positive, 71 negative). The website&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;The story is unconvincing and the acting is weak.&quot;

In his two-star review, Roger Ebert called it &quot;possibly the funniest movie ever made about Catholicism — from a theological point of view.&quot; Gabriel Byrne was nominated for a Razzie Award for Worst Supporting Actor for his performances in both this film and &quot;End of Days&quot;, where he lost to Ahmed Best as Jar Jar Binks in &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;.

<text>Doris Amelia Blackburn (; 18 September 1889 – 12 December 1970) was an Australian social reformer and politician. She served in the House of Representatives from 1946 to 1949, the second woman after Enid Lyons to do so. Blackburn was a prominent socialist and originally a member of the Labor Party. She was married to Maurice Blackburn, a Labor MP, but he was expelled from the party in 1937 and she resigned from the party in solidarity. Her husband died in 1944, and she was elected to his former seat at the 1946 federal election – the first woman elected to parliament as an independent. However, Blackburn served only a single term before being defeated. She later served as president of the Women&#x27;s International League for Peace and Freedom.

==Early life==
Born in Hawthorn, Melbourne, Victoria to Lebbeus Hordern, estate agent, and his wife Louisa Dewson (née Smith), Doris Hordern became involved in women&#x27;s rights and peace issues from a young age and served as the campaign secretary of Vida Goldstein, the first woman to stand for election to federal parliament in Australia. She married Maurice Blackburn, a fellow firebrand socialist, in Melbourne on 10 December 1914 and spent their honeymoon organising anti-war and anti-conscription campaigns.

==Politics==
While her husband served at different times as an Australian Labor Party (ALP) member of the Victorian and Federal parliaments, Blackburn continued to work on social issues, some of which brought her into conflict with the Labor Party (of which she too was a member) and following Maurice&#x27;s expulsion from the party in 1937, she resigned from the ALP. Her husband continued to sit in parliament as an independent but lost his seat at the 1943 federal election to the official Labor candidate, and died the following year.

==Parliament==
Upset at Labor&#x27;s treatment of her husband, Blackburn stood as an Independent Labour candidate for her husband&#x27;s old seat of Bourke at the 1946 election, and by winning it she became only the second woman to be elected to the Australian House of Representatives.

In parliament Blackburn, who shared the cross benches with fellow former Labor member Jack Lang, championed similar issues to those of her late husband, gaining nationwide notoriety in 1947 as the only MP to vote against the Atomic Energy Bill. She served as the national President of the Council for Civil Liberties. Following an electoral redistribution, her seat of Bourke was abolished, and at the 1949 election she contested the newly established seat of Wills. In a contest with both the Labor and Liberal parties she came third with 20 percent. Standing in Wills again at the 1951 election she also came third with 17 percent of the vote. Both times the seat was convincingly won by Labor.

==Affiliations==
As of September 1949, Blackburn was a charter member of the Australian Peace Council.

Blackburn subsequently remained active in social issues, serving as president of the Women&#x27;s International League for Peace and Freedom. Realising the problems faced by Aborigines, following a visit to the Woomera Rocket Range, she co-founded, with Douglas Nicholls, the Aborigines Advancement League and the Federal Council for Aboriginal Advancement.

==Death==
Blackburn died on 12 December 1970 in Coburg, Victoria, aged 81. She had two sons and two daughters, one of which died before her.

<text>Denham railway station is a railway station in the village of Denham in Buckinghamshire, England. It is on the Chiltern Main Line between West Ruislip and .

==History==

The station was built just north of Denham village as part of the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway. It opened on 2 April 1906 as Denham for Harefield.

The original station layout had four roads: two for non-stop trains, and two with platforms for stopping services. There was a small goods yard north of the line, and a signal box at the London end of the &quot;down&quot; platform. The two through roads have been removed, being taken up in December 1965, with all services using the platform roads and has since had improved track alignments to allow fast running trains. The signal box closed on 15 June 1975. The former goods yard is now the station car park.

The station was transferred from the Western Region of British Rail to the London Midland Region on 24 March 1974.

===Abandoned Central line extension===
Under the London Passenger Transport Board&#x27;s 1935-40 New Works Programme, Denham was to have been the terminus of the Central line&#x27;s westward extension from North Acton, with Central line platforms south of those on the main line. The continuation to Denham was added in 1937. Work on the extension was postponed in World War II. The introduction of the Metropolitan Green Belt limited the expansion of the London urban area and the extension beyond West Ruislip was cancelled. No visible signs of the extension works remain at Denham.

===Development===
The station was built with a pedestrian underpass linking the platforms, but this was inaccessible to people with impaired mobility. Further, the embankment supporting the &quot;down&quot; (westbound) platform and buildings was subsiding, so the &quot;down&quot; platform has been relocated as an island north of the &quot;down&quot; road, in the gap left by the removal of the original through roads, and to provide a footbridge and lifts, similar to those at Gerrards Cross, for disabled access. The new &quot;down&quot; platform was opened for use in late July 2008, and the original &quot;down&quot; platform and buildings have been removed.

A proposed second phase, providing a third reversible track between the rear of the new platform and the existing &quot;up&quot; (eastbound) platform road, would improve operational flexibility by allowing stopping services to be passed by following non-stop trains.

==Services==
All services at Denham are operated by Chiltern Railways.

The typical off-peak service is one train per hour in each direction between London Marylebone and . Services to and from London operate as stopping services calling at most stations. Additional services call at the station during the peak hours, including some services that run semi-fast to and from London.

On weekends, northbound services are extended beyond High Wycombe to and from via .




==Cultural use==

Denham Station served as &quot;New Milton station&quot; in the 1949 British comedy &quot;The Chiltern Hundreds&quot;, starring Cecil Parker and David Tomlinson. 

In the episode &quot;Queen and Country&quot; of season 9 of the TV series &quot;New Tricks&quot;, Denham station was the location used for an unspecified station in Exeter.

In episode 6, &quot;Home Sweet Home&quot;, of series 2 of TV sitcom &quot;The Good Life&quot;, the Goods are dropped off by Mr May outside the main building at Denham station after viewing a smallholding.

<text>Delta Lambda Phi (; officially the Delta Lambda Phi Social Fraternity; DLP or Lambda) is an international social fraternity for gay, bisexual, transgender and progressive men. The fraternity was founded in 1986 in Washington, D.C. It offers a social environment and structure similar to other Greek-model college fraternities. It was the first, and as of 2013 the only, national fraternity with an emphasis on gay and bisexual men.
== History ==
Delta Lambda Phi was founded in Washington, D.C. on October 15, 1986, by Vernon L. Strickland III. A fellow student on his university campus had been denied fraternity membership due to the presumption that he was gay. When Strickland became aware of other examples of this, he began organizing a fraternity with a more welcoming model that would not discriminate based on sexual orientation.

Strickland wrote the fraternity&#x27;s ritual, selected a name and its symbols, and advertised for rush. Eligible members included gay, bisexual, and progressive straight men. According to a fraternity member, a progressive male is &quot;a person willing to accept the virtues, ideals, and truth that gay, bisexual and transgendered people feel. They are essentially straight allied members of the gay community.&quot; The fraternity was founded with 29 members and was community-based, rather than being affiliated with a university.

The three purposes of the fraternity are:
* To develop dignified and purposeful social, service, and recreational activities for all men, irrespective of sexual orientation or gender expression;
* To lead in determining the rights and privileges of individuals in society; and,
* To present a strong and positive image that respects the diversity of all individuals.

The Washington, D.C. Area &quot;Alpha chapter&quot; was formed on April 10, 1987, with the initiation of 24 members. The fraternity was incorporated in Washington D.C. on September 10, 1987. Strickland traveled to college campuses across the United States for eighteen months, working on expanding the fraternity. In April 1988 a group of gay men at UCLA were recognized as the first Delta Lambda Phi chapter to be affiliated with a university. This was followed by chapters at the University of California, San Diego and the University of Minnesota. The fraternity continued to add colonies and chapters across the United States, becoming &quot;one of the nation&#x27;s fastest-growing fraternities&quot;.

In August 1995, the &quot;University of Minnesota chapter&quot; opened a residential chapter house in a former Chi Phi house on fraternity row. This was the first chapter house for an openly gay fraternity in the United States. In 2011, the fraternity changed its charter to specifically include transgender men. The fraternity went international with the chartering of &quot;Beta Omega chapter&quot; at McGill University in Montreal in 2012. It established fourteen chapters between 2011 and 2014.

Delta Lambda Phi has been a member of the North American Interfraternity Conference (NIC) since 2013. The fraternity&#x27;s highest honor is the Vernon L. Strickland III Founder&#x27;s Award for extraordinary service to the fraternity&#x27;s brotherhood.

== Membership ==
Delta Lambda Phi&#x27;s membership is open to all men, whether gay, bisexual, transgender, or straight. Campus and multi-campus chapters are generally open to male college-aged students who live in the area. Community-based chapters do not require their members to be students.

Members are selected through a typical fraternity rush and selected bid process. Pledges are required to memorize the Greek alphabet, know the fraternity&#x27;s mission, and learn the parliamentary procedure from &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order&quot;. Pledges are also required to perform community service and often work with groups that have ties with the gay community.

Delta Lambda Phi strictly prohibits hazing, and it adheres to an extensive, fraternity-wide Risk Management Policy.

== Symbols and traditions ==
The Greek letters Delta (&#x27;) to represent the pink triangles that the Nazis made homosexuals wear and Lambda (&#x27;) because it is a symbol used for gay pride; however, the complete Greek meaning is known only by its members . The fraternity&#x27;s initiation ritual is also secret.

The fraternity&#x27;s heraldic crest consists of a yellow shield surrounded by green elements; it contains eleven symbolic elements. Above the shield, is a helmet that symbolized honor and knighthood. Its open visor indicates that Delta Lambda Phi is a non-secret society. The helmet is surrounded by mantling that suggests the fraternity&#x27;s use of parliamentary procedure. On either side of the shield, scales symbolize the distribution of justice and the balance of social equity. On the scales to the left, two of the Greek letter Phi (&#x27;) represent the minority viewpoint; on the right, three of the Greek letter Phi (&#x27;) represent the majority viewpoint. At the top of the shield to the left, the inverted triangle is a reminder of the Nazi&#x27;s persecution of gays and ongoing modern challenges. In the upper center of the crest, there are shaking hands which symbolize understanding and friendship. At the top of the shield to the right, a lowercase letter Lambda () stands for the gay liberation movement. Below the three symbols, chevrons symbolically the shield into &quot;an unclosed division with the past. Below the chevrons, three stars symbolize the first three chapters and the three founding purposes of the fraternity, while a burning lamp at the bottom represents ancient justice and enlightenment. Below the shield is a scroll with the fraternity&#x27;s name.

The fraternity&#x27;s mascot is the Lambda Centaur, which is modeled after Chiron, the only immortal centaur from Greek mythology who was regarded as gentle and wise. The fraternity&#x27;s version of the centaur is younger and clean-shaven, with short hair—the &quot;essence of masculinity&quot;. The fraternity&#x27;s colors are green, gold, and white. The fraternity flower is the yellow rose.

When formed, the fraternity&#x27;s slogan was, &quot;What others try to hide in shame, we boldly embrace with pride.&quot; The formal motto of the fraternity is &quot;Lambda Men are Making Their Presence Known.&quot; The fraternity&#x27;s toasting song, &quot;Delta Phi (There Once Was a Mighty Lambda Man&quot; is as follows:There once was a mightly Lambda man

Who lived by the sword

Crushed by the rogue hoard

With a whirl of steel he took the fight

And won the prince&#x27;s heart that night

== Governance and policies ==

===Convention===
Delta Lambda Phi is governed by its convention, which is officially the highest authority in the fraternity. The convention is held annually and, as a body, comprises two members from every active chapter, as well as alumni representatives and the fraternity&#x27;s board of directors. The first convention was held in 1989 in San Francisco. The location of the convention changes from year to year and is selected by the fraternity staff.

=== Board of directors ===
The fraternity&#x27;s board of directors (BOD) governs the fraternity between conventions and consists of eleven elected members, three &quot;ex officio&quot; members, and Life Members. Members who have served on the board for ten or more years can be appointed Life Member by the action of the annual convention. The executive director and general counsel are appointed by the trustees and confirmed by the board of directors. The executive director oversees the day-to-day affairs of the fraternity.

The fraternity recognizes three broad geographic regions—Eastern, Central, and Western. Each region is overseen by a regional steering committee, and also hosts two regional conferences; one in the spring, and one in the fall. Like the location of the Convention, regional conference locations are generally rotated.

=== &quot;Hands-Off&quot; policy ===

The Corporate Brother-Pledge Relations Policy states that brothers and pledges may not engage in &quot;extra-fraternal relations&quot; during the rush and pledge education periods. The policy aims to ensure that bid distribution remains fair, that pledge education is focused on platonic fraternal bonding, and that the risk of sexual harassment is minimized. No corporate policy prohibits two members from engaging in extra-fraternal relations after they become brothers. Because the student-teacher relationship that existed during the pledge education process no longer exists, all brothers are regarded as peers and are simply encouraged to exercise their best judgment.

Sexual relationships between brothers and pledges are forbidden. The policy governing these relationships is the Corporate Brother-Pledge Relations Policy, known informally as the &quot;Hands-Off Policy&quot;. The policy has existed in various forms since the early years of the fraternity, and it was codified and adopted by the national convention in 1998.

==Philanthropy==
The Delphi Foundation is a separately incorporated 501(c)(3) educational foundation and charitable arm of Delta Lambda Phi. The foundation offers academic scholarships to collegiate or alumni members. It also supports the Delta Force Leadership Academy, established in 2011.

==Chapters==

Delta Lambda Phi has three types of chapters: campus-based, multi-campus based, and community-based. Its chapters are assigned a sequential Greek letter designation according to the order in which they were chartered.

==Alumni associations==
Founded in 2003, the Delta Lambda Phi Alumni Association (DLPAA) is governed by an elected board of directors. The DLPAA also allows for the creation of local alumni associations (LAAs). LAAs can be either in support of a specific chapter or location-based. Following is a list of Delta Lambda Phi alumni chapters.
==Notable members==
* Henry Berg-Brousseau (&quot;Alpha Second&quot;) – transgender rights activist
* Todd Gloria (&quot;Alpha Delta&quot;) – mayor of San Diego
* Chip Sarafin (&quot;Alpha Alpha&quot;) – firstly openly gay professional football player

<text>Massacre Rocks State Park is a history-focused public recreation area in the Northwest United States featuring the Massacre Rocks, a famous spot along the Oregon Trail and California Trail during the middle 19th century. The state park is located along the Snake River and Rock Creek, southwest of American Falls, in Power County, Idaho, United States.

==Description==
The park features a configuration of boulders along the south bank of the Snake River, known alternatively as Massacre Rocks, &quot;Gate of Death&quot;, or &quot;Devil&#x27;s Gate&quot;. Settlers gave this name to the narrow passage of the trail through the rocks, from the fear of possible ambush by Native Americans. According to diaries of settlers, settlers in five wagons clashed with Shoshone just east of the rocks on August 9–10, 1862. At least eight settlers from four wagon trains died, with at least 20 Shoshone also killed. The skirmishes took place east of the park and not at Devil&#x27;s Gate as commonly believed. Some confrontations may have occurred there, but they remain unverified. The Clark Massacre of 1851 occurred just west of Massacre Rocks, closer to the Raft River.

The rocks were often used as campsite for wagon trains along the trail. Many emigrants carved their names and dates on Register Rock, which is now protected by a shelter. The actual passage through the rocks is now the route of Interstate 86 along the south edge of the park.
Geologically, the park was created during the repeated volcanic activity on the Snake River Plain. The rocks themselves were deposited in their present location at the end of the last ice age, approximately 14,500 years ago, during the catastrophic flood known as the Bonneville Flood, when much of Lake Bonneville surged down the Snake River. A notch in the cliff on the north bank of the Snake opposite the park was the site of an ancient waterfall of a side channel of the waters in the aftermath of the flood.

Massacre Rocks became a state park in 1967, following earlier status as a roadside park managed by the Idaho Department of Transportation.

==Wildlife==
This state park is home to various birds which are Canada goose, great blue heron, grebe, pelican, bald eagle. The only residential mammals are beaver, jackrabbit, cottontail, muskrat and coyote.

==Activities and amenities==
The park is accessible by automobile on Interstate 86 and by foot using a trail from the rest areas just east of the park on Interstate 86. The footpaths also provide access to remnants of the original Oregon Trail on the south side of the highway. Exhibits in the park&#x27;s visitor center describe the history and geology of the park. The park offers trails for hiking and biking, a disc golf course, campground, and access to the Snake River.

==Climate==
According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Massacre Rocks State Park has a cold semi-arid climate, abbreviated &quot;BSk&quot; on climate maps. The hottest temperature recorded in Massacre Rocks State Park was on August 8, 1990, while the coldest temperature recorded was on January 18, 1984.

<text>Sir Charles Fawcett (1869–1952) was a British historian. He served in the Indian Civil Service while India was a part of the British Empire. He published a number of articles and books related to Indian history and was an expert on the British East India Company. His most famous article, published in October 1937 in the &quot;Mariner&#x27;s Mirror&quot;, suggests that the design of the flag of the United States may have been derived from the flag and jack of the British East India Company.

<text>Lake Waikareiti, also spelt Lake Waikare Iti, is located in Te Urewera National Park in the North Island of New Zealand. A number of hiking trails are found within the catchment basin of the lake.

Its formation followed a landslide 18,000 years ago, in which a part of the landmass of 10 kilometers wide slid to the north-west. It is four kilometres to the northeast of the larger Lake Waikaremoana, into which it drains via the Aniwaniwa Stream. The smaller lake&#x27;s surface is at an altitude of 880 metres above sea level - considerably higher than that of Waikaremoana - and as such the stream has several fine waterfalls such as the Āniwaniwa Falls and Papakorito Falls.

Several small islets are found in the lake. One of these, Rahui, itself contains a tiny lake - one of New Zealand&#x27;s very rare lakes within lakes.

Numerous flora species are found within the lake catchment basin, crown fern (&quot;Blechnum discolor&quot;) being a widespread understory plant. An assortment of birds found in the North Island are present at the national park except for the weka.

The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of &quot;little waters&quot; for .

<doc id="1167558" wikidata="Q2916028" url="?curid=1167558" title="Fouad Ajami">
<text>Fouad A. Ajami (; September 18, 1945 – June 22, 2014) was a Lebanese-born American professor and writer on Middle Eastern issues. He was a senior fellow at Stanford University&#x27;s Hoover Institution.

Ajami was an outspoken supporter of the Bush Doctrine and the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which he believed to have been a &quot;noble war&quot; and a &quot;gift&quot; to the people of Iraq.

==Early life and education==
Ajami was born in Arnoun, a rocky hamlet in the south of Lebanon into a Shia Muslim family. His Shia great-grandfather had immigrated to Arnoun from Tabriz, Iran in the 1850s. In Arabic, the word &quot;Ajam&quot; means &quot;non-Arab&quot; or &quot;non-Arabic-speaker&quot;; specifically in this context, it means &quot;Persian&quot; or &quot;Persian-speaker.&quot; Ajami arrived in the United States in the fall of 1963, just before he turned 18. He did some of his undergraduate work at Eastern Oregon State College (now Eastern Oregon University) in La Grande, Oregon. He did his graduate work at the University of Washington, where he wrote his thesis on international relations and world government, and earned a PhD.

==Career==

===Academia===
In 1973 Ajami joined the politics department of Princeton University. He made a name for himself there as a vocal supporter of Palestinian self-determination. In 1980, the School of Advanced International Studies of Johns Hopkins University named him director of Middle East Studies. He joined the Hoover Institution in 2011.

===Government===
Ajami was an advisor to United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice as well as a friend and colleague of Paul Wolfowitz.

===Journalism===
Ajami was a frequent contributor on Middle Eastern issues and contemporary international history to &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;, &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;, &quot;The New Republic&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, as well as other journals and periodicals. He was also a contributor and close friend to Anderson Cooper of CNN. He was also a frequent guest on Fox News Channel&#x27;s &quot;America&#x27;s News Headquarters w/ Uma Pemmaraju&quot;

===Television===
Ajami frequently appeared on PBS, CBS, CNN and Fox News.

==Nephew&#x27;s link to killing of cleric==
On 16 February 1984 two agents of the Israeli Shin Bet, acting on orders from Meir Dagan and working as members of the terrorist Front for the Liberation of Lebanon from Foreigners (a front organization for the Israel Defense Forces) killed Lebanese Shia imam and militant Ragheb Harb. Hussein Abbas, one of the assassins, was a nephew of Ajami, and after the assassination he fled to America where he lived in the home of his uncle.

==Books==
In &quot;The Fate of Nonalignment,&quot; an essay in the Winter 1980/81 issue of the journal &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;, Ajami outlined how in his opinion the third world has fared in a context of nonalignment in post Cold War politics. In 1980, he accepted an offer from Johns Hopkins University to become director of Middle East Studies at their international relations graduate program in Washington, D.C.: the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS). He holds an endowed chair as the Majid Khadduri professor.

A year after arriving at SAIS, Ajami published his first book, &quot;The Arab Predicament&quot;, which analyzed what Ajami described as an intellectual and political crisis that swept the Arab world following its defeat by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War.

Subsequently, Ajami has written several other books: &quot;The Dream Palace of the Arabs: A Generation&#x27;s Odyssey&quot; (1998), &quot;Beirut: City of Regrets&quot; (1988), and &quot;The Vanished Imam: Musa Al-Sadr and the Shia of Lebanon&quot; (1986).

In &quot;The Dream Palace of the Arabs: A Generation&#x27;s Odyssey&quot;, Ajami surveyed the intellectual landscape in the Arab world and Iran, in what was in some ways an autobiography as well as a sequel to &quot;The Arab Predicament.&quot; On Middle Eastern politics, he wrote of &quot;a world where triumph rarely comes with mercy or moderation.&quot; On Pan-Arabism, he described the ideology as &quot;Sunni dominion dressed in secular garb.&quot;

Ajami&#x27;s book &quot;The Foreigner&#x27;s Gift: The Americans, The Arabs and The Iraqis in Iraq&quot; (2006), is about the American invasion of Iraq.

&quot;Crosswinds: The Way of Saudi Arabia&quot; (2020), was published posthumously, by the Hoover Institute.

==Philosophy==

===View of Huntington&#x27;s &quot;Clash of Civilizations&quot;===
One notable contribution Ajami made in the September October 1993 issue of &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; was a rebuttal to Samuel Huntington’s &quot;The Clash of Civilizations?&quot;, regarding the state and future of international relations after the Cold War. According to Judith Miller, Ajami continued to argue that militant Islamism of the type represented by Al Qaeda had peaked and was fading into insignificance.

Huntington presents a world divided at the highest level into eight civilizations, and includes a number of countries that are &quot;torn&quot; between two civilizations, arguing that these civilizational divides are far more fundamental than economic interests, ideology, and regimes, and that the world is becoming a smaller place with increasingly close interactions. He further claims that the pre-eminence of a so-called &quot;kin-country&quot; syndrome will provide a civilizational rallying point that will replace political ideology and traditional &quot;balance of power&quot; considerations for relations between states and nations, resulting in a division between the West and &quot;the rest&quot; creating a backlash against Western values (which supposedly &quot;differ fundamentally&quot; from those prevalent in other civilizations).

In his article &quot;The Summoning&quot;, Ajami criticises Huntington for ignoring the empirical complexities and state interests which drive conflicts in and between civilizations. Ajami believes that states will remain the dominant factor influencing the global framework and interaction. He also argues that civilizational ties are only utilized by states and groups when it is in their best interest to do so and that modernity and secularism are here to stay, especially in places with considerable struggles to obtain them, and he cites the example of the Indian middle class. Ajami also believes that civilizations do not control states; rather, states control civilizations.

Ajami later relented on his initial criticism of Huntington&#x27;s theories in the January 6, 2008 issue of the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; in an article titled &quot;The Clash&quot; in which he wrote that &quot;Huntington’s thesis about a civilizational clash seems more compelling to me than the critique I provided at that time.&quot;

===Support for Iraq War===
Ajami was an outspoken supporter of the Iraq War, which he believed “issued out of a deep American frustration... with the culture of terrorism that had put down roots in Arab lands.&quot;

In an August 2002 speech before the Veterans of Foreign Wars, US Vice President Dick Cheney sought to assuage concerns about the anticipated US invasion of Iraq, stating: &quot;As for the reaction of the Arab &#x27;street,&#x27; the Middle East expert Professor Fouad Ajami predicts that after liberation, the streets in Basra and Baghdad are &#x27;sure to erupt in joy in the same way the throngs in Kabul greeted the Americans.&#x27;&quot;

Ajami cautioned the United States about the likely negative consequences of the Iraq War. In a 2003 essay in &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;, &quot;Iraq and the Arabs&#x27; Future,&quot; Ajami wrote,

There should be no illusions about the sort of Arab landscape that America is destined to find if, or when, it embarks on a war against the Iraqi regime. There would be no &quot;hearts and minds&quot; to be won in the Arab world, no public diplomacy that would convince the overwhelming majority of Arabs that this war would be a just war. An American expedition in the wake of thwarted UN inspections would be seen by the vast majority of Arabs as an imperial reach into their world, a favor to Israel, or a way for the United States to secure control over Iraq&#x27;s oil. No hearing would be given to the great foreign power.

But he also goes on to say:

America ought to be able to live with this distrust and discount a good deal of this anti-Americanism as the &quot;road rage&quot; of a thwarted Arab world – the congenital condition of a culture yet to take full responsibility for its self-inflicted wounds. There is no need to pay excessive deference to the political pieties and givens of the region. Indeed, this is one of those settings where a reforming foreign power&#x27;s simpler guidelines offer a better way than the region&#x27;s age-old prohibitions and defects.

Ajami retained a positive view of the war three years later. In a 2006 book on the invasion and its aftermath, he described it as a noble effort, and argued that despite many unhappy consequences, it was too soon to write it off as a failure.

Vice President Cheney cited Ajami again in an October 21, 2007 speech to the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, stating, &quot;We have no illusions about the road ahead. As Fouad Ajami said recently, Iraq is not yet &#x27;a country at peace, and all its furies have not burned out, but a measure of order has begun to stick on the ground.&#x27;&quot;

Eight days after U.S. President Barack Obama took office, a &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; op-ed piece by Ajami called Obama a &quot;messenger of the old, settled ways,&quot; claimed that the George W. Bush administration&#x27;s diplomacy had had &quot;revolutionary impact,&quot; and chided Obama for not praising the Iraq War. Ajami credited the Egyptian Revolution and Tunisian revolution to the Iraq War and Bush&#x27;s advocacy of democracy:

He also stated, however, that

In June 2011, Ajami wrote an article for &quot;The New Republic&quot; arguing that the U.S. troops should remain in Iraq, writing that &quot;the United States will have to be prepared for and accept the losses and adversity that are an integral part of staying on, rightly, in so tangled and difficult a setting.&quot; On June 13, 2011, he wrote in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; about the unrest in Syria that &quot;The mask of the Assad regime finally falls...&quot;

==Death==
On June 22, 2014, Ajami died from prostate cancer at a summer home in Maine, aged 68.

==Awards==
Ajami was a 1982 winner of a five-year MacArthur Prize Fellowship in the arts and sciences.
In 2006, he was awarded the National Humanities Medal by President Bush, and the Bradley Prize, and in 2011 he earned the Benjamin Franklin Award for public service, and the Eric Breindel Award for Excellence in Opinion Journalism.

==Memberships==
Ajami was a member of the board of directors of the Council on Foreign Relations, and the board of advisors of the journal &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;. Ajami was a founding member of ASMEA (The Association for the Study of the Middle East and Africa) and was vice chairman of its academic council. Ajami also sat on the editorial board of &quot;Middle East Quarterly&quot;, a publication of the Middle East Forum think tank. He was a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and the cochair of their Working Group on Islamism and the International Order.

<doc id="1167586" wikidata="Q282800" url="?curid=1167586" title="Zack Fair">
<text>is a character in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; role-playing video game series by Square Enix (originally Square). He is first introduced as a non-player character in &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; (1997) and later appears in the &quot;Compilation of Final Fantasy VII&quot; works &quot;Before Crisis&quot;, &quot;Last Order&quot;, &quot;Advent Children&quot; and, most prominently, &quot;Crisis Core&quot;, a prequel to the original game which focuses on him and expands on his backstory.

Although Zack died before the events of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, is rarely mentioned, and only appears late into the story in flashbacks, he is a crucial part of the game&#x27;s story, as following traumatic events involving them and Sephiroth, Cloud Strife unknowingly confused parts of his past with Zack&#x27;s. While Cloud originally believes himself to be a member of the paramilitary organization SOLDIER, the military wing of the megacorporation Shinra, this story was in fact that of Zack, with Cloud being his friend and a regular soldier. Zack died in the weeks leading up to &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;&#x27;s opening, sacrificing himself to protect Cloud from Shinra&#x27;s army after they escaped from imprisonment; a mentally shaken Cloud&#x27;s memories of the events were heavily affected, and he forgot Zack entirely.

Zack was not originally part of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;″s story during development, but scenario writer Kazushige Nojima wanted to bring a sense of mystery to the title, and created the character to help complicate Cloud&#x27;s backstory. He was designed by Tetsuya Nomura, and his last name is derived from &quot;fair weather&quot;, to contrast with Cloud&#x27;s last name, Strife. With Zack&#x27;s conceptual backstory in place for &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, the staff decided to use &quot;Compilation of Final Fantasy VII&quot; to expand upon his character. Zack is voiced by Kenichi Suzumura in Japanese and Rick Gomez in English prior to &quot;Final Fantasy VII Remake&quot;, in which he is voiced by Caleb Pierce. Suzumura was chosen specifically by Nomura for his voice, and was given the role without an audition. Western critics have praised Zack&#x27;s character, commenting on his development since &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;.

==Concept and creation==
Zack did not exist in the original scenario of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, but was created when scenario writer Kazushige Nojima decided to add some mystery to the plot, most notably in relation to Cloud Strife&#x27;s background. Nojima had always planned for Cloud&#x27;s memories of his life to be proven false as the game went on, but he had not decided on how to implement this until he hit on the character of Zack. Nojima also used Zack to link Cloud and Aerith Gainsborough, as Zack was her first love and Cloud reminds her of him, thus creating an emotional connection between herself and Cloud. Originally, the role of her first love was to have been fulfilled by the game&#x27;s antagonist Sephiroth. As the game continued development, Nojima worked out the mysteries regarding Zack and Cloud, which led to some scenes needing revision. Director Yoshinori Kitase was surprised by the revelation of Cloud&#x27;s and Zack&#x27;s connection, as until the later stages of development, even he did not know about Zack. Character designer Tetsuya Nomura got the request to design Zack when &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; was reaching the end of development. Prior to the late addition of Zack, Nojima had asked the staff to add details to some scenes to hint at his existence, despite not revealing Zack&#x27;s existence to the staff until later. The opportunity to write Crisis Core would gave Nojima the ability to expand on Zack&#x27;s character and create a personality for him. Although Zack is linked with Cloud due to multiple parallels, Nojima stated that the personality of Zack was based on &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; protagonist Tidus, as both are rarely bothered by their own thoughts and are generally cheerful.

For &quot;Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children&quot;, Zack made only a couple of brief appearances, and as such, was not difficult to animate; the team had also acquired his design early in production, allowing modeling of his character to be taken care of. Nomura had wanted Zack to have a &quot;nice, upbeat voice&quot;, which influenced his decision to cast Kenichi Suzumura. Beforehand, Nomura had had dinner with Suzumura, where he had decided that &quot;at that point [Nomura] wanted him to be in one of his projects if the opportunity ever presented itself&quot;. Suzumura was offered the role without an audition. Nomura explained that, because Zack had been chosen to be the lead in &quot;Last Order: Final Fantasy VII&quot;, he needed &quot;someone who could handle [the] role well&quot;. The staff used &quot;Last Order&quot; as an opportunity to portray Zack &quot;properly&quot; as a &quot;handsome, light-hearted man [who] was in everyone&#x27;s memory&quot;. In English, Zack is voiced by Rick Gomez.

In an interview with IGN whilst promoting &quot;Crisis Core&quot;, Yoshinori Kitase explained that when the original game was created, Zack was a minor character, although Nomura had created art design, and Nojima had created a basic concept of Zack&#x27;s story. Kitase further explained that &quot;you could say that the idea [for the storyline of &quot;Crisis Core&quot;] has been cooking for 10 years&quot;. Before &quot;Crisis Core&quot; began development, the staff had planned to create a PlayStation Portable port of &quot;Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII&quot;, but soon changed their minds to create a game that focused on Zack, whose fate was predetermined; fans knew how the game was going to end. Throughout the game, the staff decided to use a blue sky in cutscenes to represent Zack, while other features in such scenes are meant to symbolize his connections. Several of Zack&#x27;s actions from the game were also designed so as to augment the similarities that Aerith finds between him and Cloud in &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;.

Due to Zack initially appearing as a younger person than in previous games, Suzumura was asked to portray Zack in a fashion that shows him to be naive in order for his character arc to be more noticeable, as he becomes more mature throughout the narrative. He wears the SOLDIER 1st class uniform, consisting of a black, sleeveless turtleneck, black boots, and armor. In &quot;Crisis Core&quot;, Zack has two outfits; his &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; outfit and a different outfit worn during the start of the game, which he changes after fighting Angeal Hewley. Originally, Zack was meant to wear red clothing until Tetsuya Nomura drew his black outfit. He was made as a conventional heroic character in contrast to Cloud, who was written as an unlikely hero. There was an attempt to make Zack&#x27;s and Aerith&#x27;s interactions appealing in &quot;Crisis Core&quot;. Zack&#x27;s full name was first revealed in an article in &quot;Dengeki PlayStation&quot;. Nomura stated that Zack&#x27;s name was derived from &#x27;fair weather&#x27; and specifically chosen because it contrasted with Cloud Strife&#x27;s name. Zack and Cloud&#x27;s connection was also meant to be expanded upon near the game&#x27;s ending, with both of them planning to flee to Midgar, but due to limitations in the console&#x27;s hardware, these scenes could not be implemented, and instead, they decided to focus on Zack&#x27;s role as a warrior. The game&#x27;s remaster, &quot;Crisis Core Reunion&quot;, was developed as part of the &quot;Final Fantasy VII Remake&quot; project and acts as a prequel to the main trilogy designed to familiarize players with the story of Zack ahead of his appearance in &quot;Final Fantasy VII Rebirth&quot;, where he would play a more significant role.

==Appearances==
Zack had a small role in the original &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;. He is first mentioned by name in Gongaga, his hometown, where his parents do not know what happened to him after he left to join SOLDIER, and are worried for his safety after not hearing from him for years. It is at this point that Aerith explains Zack was her first love. Cloud later realizes that some of his memories and aspects of his personality were actually Zack&#x27;s, and not his own. Flashbacks reveal that both Zack and Cloud battled Sephiroth after he burned down the town of Nibelheim upon discovering he was born from a scientific experiment. After Cloud defeated Sephiroth, both Zack and Cloud were taken to be used in experiments by Shinra. Eventually, Zack awoke and was able to escape with a semi-conscious Cloud to the city of Midgar, but on the edge of the city, Shinra troops gunned him down. While the flashback showing Zack&#x27;s and Cloud&#x27;s escape is optional in the North American and European releases of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; and the Japanese &quot;International&quot; version, it was originally planned to be shown once Cloud discovered the results of Shinra&#x27;s experiments.

Zack&#x27;s character and backstory is expanded upon throughout the &quot;Compilation of Final Fantasy VII&quot;. In the prequel game &quot;Before Crisis&quot;, Zack supports Shinra in their fight against the eco-terrorist group AVALANCHE. During the game, two of his SOLDIER acquaintances are captured and experimented upon, and Zack is able to bring them back to their senses but is unable to save them. Zack also appears during the chapter covering the Nibelheim incident, and later as a boss character when he and Cloud are fugitives from Shinra and are being pursued by the Turks. The OVA &quot;Last Order&quot; follows Zack and Cloud&#x27;s journey to Midgar with flashbacks of the Nibelheim incident. Zack also has a small role in the film sequel &quot;Advent Children&quot;, where most of his appearances are flashbacks from Cloud&#x27;s point of view. He also appears at the end of the film, where he and Aerith speak to Cloud. In the director&#x27;s cut version, &quot;Advent Children Complete&quot;, his role is expanded, and he appears during Cloud&#x27;s battle with Sephiroth. His death is also shown, where he gives Cloud the Buster Sword and tells him to become his &quot;living legacy&quot;.

Zack is the protagonist of &quot;Crisis Core&quot;, a prequel to &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, which deals primarily with his backstory. In the game, Zack is trained as a SOLDIER by his close friend, Angeal Hewley, and hopes to become a hero while working for Shinra. When Angeal, and another SOLDIER, Genesis Rhapsodos, betray Shinra, Zack and Sephiroth are dispatched to kill them, but decide to avoid doing that if possible. He and Sephiroth learn that both Angeal and Genesis were the result of a Shinra experiment called &quot;Project G&quot;, where they were injected with Jenova cells prior to being born in an effort to create perfect SOLDIERs. However, both Angeal and Genesis are suffering from side effects, leading them to antagonize Shinra in the hopes of finding a cure. Over the course of the game, Zack befriends Cloud and begins dating Aerith. During a mission to find Angeal and Genesis, Angeal forces Zack to kill him, as he wants to stop hurting people because of his mutations. Before dying, Angeal thanks Zack for stopping him and gives him his Buster Sword. Later, while Zack and Sephiroth search for Genesis and the former Shinra scientist Dr. Hollander, they go to Nibelheim, where Sephiroth learns that he was the result of genetic experimentation involving Jenova. The game then depicts the Nibelheim incident, leading to Zack and Cloud being taken captive and subjected to experiments. Four years pass, Zack and Cloud are able to escape, and Zack learns that Genesis has come to believe the only way he can be cured is by being injected with Sephiroth&#x27;s cells. As Sephiroth is presumed dead, the only source of these cells is Cloud, and Zack realises that Genesis plans to kill Cloud. Zack decides to stop Genesis, and after defeating him, he and Cloud head to Midgar, where he hopes to be reunited with Aerith. However, Zack and Cloud are intercepted by Shinra infantry, and Zack is killed. As he is dying, Zack bequeaths the Buster Sword to Cloud, telling him to be his living legacy. As Cloud heads towards Midgar, Zack is pulled into the sky by Angeal, and wonders if he has become a hero.

Zack has served as the basis for several forms of merchandise, such as being pictured on the &quot;Final Fantasy VII 10th Anniversary Potion&quot; soft drink cans. Outside the &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; series, Zack is an unlockable character in the PlayStation version of the fighting game &quot;Ehrgeiz&quot;, where is playable in arcade, versus, and minigame events. He made his debut appearance in the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series in the prequel &quot;Birth by Sleep&quot; for the PlayStation Portable, where he has a more youthful appearance than in his &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; incarnation. He is featured prominently in the Olympus Coliseum (which is where Cloud often appeared in previous installments), commonly participating in tournaments in order to achieve his dream of becoming a hero. As the game is a prequel to the other &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; titles, the staff chose him as they wanted a character from a &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; prequel.

Zack appears at the end of &quot;Final Fantasy VII Remake&quot; during a flashback scene, where he survives the ambush by Shinra forces and continues dragging Cloud toward Midgar. The scene takes place in another timeline from the main narrative where Zack survives instead of being shot. He returns in &quot;Final Fantasy VII Rebirth&quot;, which explores the alternate timeline, in which Zack helps Elmyra look over a comatose Cloud and Aerith as the end of the world approaches. After learning of Aerith&#x27;s fate from Marlene, Zack&#x27;s timeline briefly merges with the main one and he teams up with Cloud to battle Sephiroth before being brought back to his timeline.

==Critical reception==

Response to Zack&#x27;s character has generally been positive. He has been described as one of the best and popular video game characters of all time. &quot;GamesRadar+&quot;″s Jim Sterling found Zack to be one of video game&#x27;s most sexually appealing male characters due to his personality and look.

Zack&#x27;s role in &quot;Crisis Core&quot; has received a mainly positive reaction. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Ryan Clements particularly praised Zack&#x27;s relationships with the other main characters. &quot;1UP.com&quot;″s Jeremy Parish agreed with Clements, arguing that Zack&#x27;s story contrasted with other RPG plots, calling it &quot;the heart of the game&quot;. Kevin VanOrd from &quot;GameSpot&quot; labelled Zack a &quot;likable and complex hero&quot;, arguing that he &quot;transcends the usual spiky-haired heroism and teenage angst with an uncommon maturity that develops as the game continues&quot;. &quot;GameSpy&quot;″s Gerald Villoria described Zack as &quot;King of the Nice Guys&quot;, noting that even though he can be a &quot;pretty hate-worthy character if you&#x27;re the jaded type who mocks the typical Final Fantasy storyline&quot;, players who dislike him could come to appreciate him. Zack was also called an &quot;endearing main character&quot; by &quot;GameRevolution&quot; who stated that despite what the character goes through during the game, he still retains his friendly attitude. Like other reviewers, &quot;RPGamer&quot; viewed him to have the &quot;full, soulful carriage of a &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; hero&quot; due to his personal conflicts, despite his &quot;artfully teased hair and devil-may-care grin&quot;. Although &quot;Eurogamer&quot;″s Simon Parkin found Zack&#x27;s physical appearance to be highly similar to Cloud&#x27;s, he added that &quot;this fan service doesn&#x27;t put a foot wrong until he reaches into his [Zack&#x27;s] pocket, pulls out a mobile phone and speaks&quot;. &quot;GamesRadar&quot;″s AJ Glasser commented that the way Zack obtains the Buster Sword and the way he gives it to Cloud is the &quot;ultimate payoff&quot; of &quot;Crisis Core&quot;, stating that the fact gamers know how the game will end is a serious detraction. When Ayaka finished the song &quot;Why&quot; for &quot;Crisis Core&quot;, she mentioned that she wanted to deliver it alongside Zack&#x27;s fate &quot;to the hearts of many people&quot;. &quot;IGN UK&quot;″s Dave McCarthy noted how Zack&#x27;s role in the &quot;Compilation of Final Fantasy VII&quot; evolved as the series developed, to the point of him getting his own game. Because Zack survives to the events of &quot;Crisis Core&quot; in the events of &quot;Remake&quot;, Meristation looks forward to his role in &quot;Rebirth&quot; and his link with the Cloud the player controls.

On the other hand, &quot;PSXextreme&quot;″s Ben Dutka, felt that Zack was not worthy of his own game, believing that only players with &quot;halfway decent memories&quot; and a &quot;hardcore completionist mentality&quot; will be able to remember Zack&#x27;s appearances in the original &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;. &quot;IGN UK&quot; expressed a mixed opinion about the character, feeling his personality was sometimes annoying, although it served to contrast with the serious attitudes of the other main characters. Similarly, &quot;VideoGamer.com&quot;″s Wesley Yin-Poole called Zack Cloud&#x27;s &quot;identical twin in all but hair colour&quot; and complained about his personality being &quot;annoying&quot; during the first half of the game. &quot;Destructoid&quot; agreed, telling players not to expect to enjoy Zack if they do not like &quot;cocky teenagers&quot; and even labelling him an &quot;annoying cockhole&quot;. &quot;PALGN&quot; called Zack an unfamiliar character in the series since his only appearances were in backstories. Conversely, John Friscia of &quot;Escapist Magazine&quot; thought that Zack &quot;reminds us that being hero doesn&#x27;t have to be boring&quot;.

There was also commentary about Zack&#x27;s actors. Eurogamer praised Zack&#x27;s English voice actor for doing a good job, noting &quot;his character&#x27;s maturing and developing over the 15-hour storyline&quot;. &quot;IGN AU&quot;″s Patrick Kolan agreed, calling Rick Gomez&#x27;s work &quot;pretty likeable&quot;. &quot;Gameplanet&quot; criticized Rick Gomez&#x27; acting, finding it more immature than they expected. Caleb Pierce&#x27;s work as the character in &quot;Reunion&quot; resulted in several complaints from reviewers due to lacking Gomez&#x27;s appeal, making the character come across as untolerable due to lacking heroic and energetic tone from Gomez. The criticism from fans in regards to Pierce&#x27;s performance as Zack resulted in websites noting that mods were created for the game to restore the original voice actors.

<doc id="1167591" wikidata="Q2604744" url="?curid=1167591" title="Anya Corazon">
<text>Aña &quot;Anya&quot; Sofia Corazón (surname alternatively shown without diacritic, Corazon, over the years) is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Marvel editor-in-chief Joe Quesada, writer Fiona Avery, and artist Mark Brooks, the character made her first appearance in &quot;Amazing Fantasy&quot; #1 (August 2004). She is the Latina daughter of a Puerto Rican father and a Mexican mother. Corazón was the first Marvel character to adopt the identity Araña (Spider), before becoming [[Spider-Girl]] (&quot;Young Allies&quot; #5, October 2010). She is third Spider-Girl published by Marvel, and the first to appear in the mainstream Marvel universe.

Anya Corazón / Spider-Girl made her cinematic debut in the animated &quot;Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse&quot; (2023), and is played by Isabela Merced in Sony&#x27;s Spider-Man Universe (SSU) film &quot;Madame Web&quot; (2024).

==Publication history==
Anya Corazon was created by Marvel Comics editor-in-chief Joe Quesada, writer Fiona Avery, and artist Mark Brooks, and is based on ideas J. Michael Straczynski used in his run on &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;. Araña was the star of the resurrected comic book series &quot;Amazing Fantasy&quot;, launched in 2004. After her storyline ended in &quot;Amazing Fantasy&quot; #6, she appeared in her own twelve issue series &quot;Araña: The Heart of the Spider&quot;, starting in March 2005 as part of Marvel Next. The character next appeared in the &quot;Ms. Marvel&quot; title as a recruit for service as a licensed superhero under the Superhuman Registration Act.

She next appears teaming up with Nomad to fight the secret empire in a backup story in &quot;Captain America&quot; #602-605. Chronologically, her next appearance was during the &quot;Grim Hunt&quot; storyline in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;; however, her appearance in the new &quot;Young Allies&quot; series was published first.

As the new Spider-Girl, she starred in a monthly &quot;Spider-Girl&quot; comic that debuted on November 17, 2010 as a tie-in to the &quot;Big Time&quot; storyline in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;. With the change of moniker to Spider-Girl, she&#x27;s the second published character to adopt the &quot;Spider-Girl&quot; alter-ego, but she actually comes prior to the first character in the chronology of the Marvel Universe. It was announced concurrently with the announcement of the series&#x27; cancellation that Anya would be receiving a new mini-series as part of the &quot;Spider-Island&quot; crossover. The first issue of the mini-series was released one month after the final issue of the cancelled series, and one month after the mini-series ended Anya appeared in one issue of Avengers Academy.

Anya was one of the main characters in Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Verse&quot; event, which led to a spinoff miniseries in &quot;Secret Wars&quot;, which she was also included in. She was one of the stars in the team comic &quot;Web Warriors&quot; as a part of All-New, All-Different Marvel.

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===

On her first day at Milton Summers High School in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, Anya is friends with classmate Lynn Sakura. She is later caught in a skirmish between two mystical clans, the Spider Society and the Sisterhood of the Wasp, and is mortally wounded. To save her life, the mage Miguel Legar from the Spider Society performs a ritual on her by giving her a spider-shaped tattoo that endows her with spider-like powers, and recruits her to be a Hunter for the Spider Society. WebCorps operatives Nina Smith and Ted Mankowski offer her various costumes, but she decides to make her own costume. She designs a costume as &quot;Araña&quot; with red and blue sneakers, blue track pants, red backpack, red gloves with many pockets, and large yellow-lensed goggles. As part of her powers, an insectoid exoskeleton covers most of her body with a bug-like bluish skin. In place of equipment like web-shooters or spider tracers, Anya created her own modified bolas out of discs that are about the size of her palm and have eight red legs able to grip objects. Anya fights a Hunter from The Sisterhood of the Wasp, adversaries of the Spider Society.

===Heart of the Spider===
While interrogating a spy for the Sisterhood of the Wasp, Anya and Miguel discover that the Sisterhood of the Wasp has recruited a fifteen-year-old boy codenamed Amun, a descendant of Egyptian assassins who believes the boy is skilled enough to not need to conceal his own identity. Anya soon meets Amun who has enrolled at her school under the name Jon Kasiya. The two soon deduce each other&#x27;s dual identities. Later, during a fight with Anya, Miguel, and the Sisterhood of the Wasp, Amun tells her that Amun will attack her loved ones if she opposes. Noting her father Gil Corazon is filming the fight, Anya takes Gil to safety. In her absence, Amun seriously wounds Miguel. The encounter leaves Anya doubting her duty due to the danger it poses to her loved ones. However, in a chance encounter, Spider-Man arrives and, after discussing her origins and adventures, tells her, &quot;With great power comes great responsibility&quot; and that in every age, people are called to be heroes. Soon afterward, Anya fights Amun and, in anger, nearly strangles Amun to death. She is stopped and Amun runs. She learns she had released &quot;the Spirit of the Hunter&quot; and warned not to do it again without Miguel with her. Back at WebCorps, Miguel is revived upon being reunited with Anya, and Miguel tells her the organization&#x27;s history that would eventually split into Wasps and Spiders. After an encounter with a gunman in a coffee shop, in which Anya saves Lynn and Amun without revealing her secret identity, Amun promises to respect her double life and to stop targeting her friends and family.

===Night of the Hunter===
The Sisterhood of the Wasp recruits Jaime Jade, a Mexican crime lord who has mental abilities that allows to hypnotize other people and was involved in the death of her mother Sofia Corazon. Miguel stops Anya from going after Jade alone with the promise that Anya can punish Jade afterwards. Anya and Amun develop a loose truce because Amun has lost his father as well, so he checks into Jade&#x27;s possible involvement in Sofia&#x27;s death. Jade hypnotizes Anya into fighting Miguel, but she eventually breaks free of the control and knocks Jade out. When Jade wakes up, the car Jade is in is suspended by a rope over the river. Jade thinks she&#x27;s bluffing, saying &quot;Little miss super hero won&#x27;t want my death on her conscience.&quot; to which she replies &quot;No, my conscience feels fine,&quot; and lets go of the rope. Amun arrives too late, but Anya reluctantly dives into the water to save Jade but the crime lord has already escaped.

===Spider-Man/Araña: The Hunter Revealed===
In the one-shot &quot;Spider-Man/Araña: the Hunter Revealed&quot;, she discovers that her exoskeleton is not an ability from being a Hunter, and she has in fact never been a true Hunter. While facing a gigantic monster summoned by the Wasps, she grants her Hunter abilities to Nina and renounces Webcorps. After Miguel is killed saving Nina from the Wasps&#x27; hunter, Nina is Webcorps&#x27; chosen champion, and Anya is free to pursue a new fate.

===Civil War===

The pro-registration heroes have tasked Carol Danvers and Wonder Man to find Anya, convince her to register, and train her. After foiling an attempted robbery, Anya and her father are taken into custody where Gil learns of Anya&#x27;s superpowers. Gil is proud to let her train with Ms. Marvel and Wonder Man. Anya&#x27;s training will essentially comprise her accompanying Wonder Man and Ms. Marvel on missions and playing &quot;sidekick&quot; to the two. Anya accompanies the two to Stark Tower, where she forces herself into a meeting with Iron Man, and then on a mission to capture the Shroud and Arachne. Arachne escapes, but the Shroud is captured and taken into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody. A strike team led by Ms. Marvel and Wonder Man arrives at the home of Arachne&#x27;s parents to take into custody. After a battle between the heroes, Arachne is arrested and her daughter Rachel Carpenter forcibly separated. Anya is deeply shaken by the ordeal and states that if being a hero means separating a mother from her child, she wants no part of it. However, she remains part of the pro-Registration strikeforce.

Before a battle with Doomsday Man, Ms. Marvel asks Anya to go get help if she fails to make contact by a certain time. Eventually, Anya joins the battle, and Doomsday Man rips away her exoskeleton, severely injuring her. Although she eventually recovers, her exoskeleton is gone. Gil takes out a restraining order to keep Ms. Marvel away from her, but Anya secretly visits Ms. Marvel to say she is not to blame for what happened. Soon after, Anya quits her job, and is confronted by Arachne who is enraged and demands to know Rachel&#x27;s whereabouts. Anya manages to subdue Arachne, but chooses to accompany Ms. Marvel and Arachne in their attempt to find Rachel, even though that means violating the restraining order her father has placed against Ms. Marvel.

Anya gets into a fight with Gil for treating her like a child after Gil accuses her of seeing Ms. Marvel. She tells Gil at least Carol is showing her how to grow up. She is later captured by Chilean soldiers who deliver her to the Puppet Master; she is added to a collection of female heroes that includes Stature, Dusk, Tigra, and Silverclaw. During a battle with Ms. Marvel&#x27;s team, Anya is partially subdued by Machine Man and Sleepwalker, and resists the Puppet Master&#x27;s command that she kill Ms. Marvel whom she sees as a mother figure.

===Grim Hunt===

During the Kravinoff family&#x27;s hunt for &quot;Spiders&quot;, Anya is targeted as a sacrifice. Spider-Man, Julia, Madame Web, and Kaine come to her aid. Despite their help, Anya is knocked out by Ana Kravinoff, Alyosha Kravinoff, and Vladimir Kravinoff. Anya is captured along with Julia and Madame Web while Kaine (who was dressed as Spider-Man) is sacrificed as part of a ritual for Kraven the Hunter&#x27;s resurrection. Spider-Man manages to free them and she assists Spider-Man in taking down the Kravinoffs. After the experience, Julia (who received Madame Web&#x27;s powers) decides to give the old Spider-Girl costume to Anya, despite the fact that Anya has no powers. She is referred to as Spider-Girl, much to her chagrin.

===Young Allies===
Anya (still known as Araña) was next seen teaming up with the new Nomad (Rikki Barnes) to investigate the Secret Empire. Although information Araña obtained from her father turned out to be a trap, the pair nonetheless bonded, and shared secret identities. Both she and Rikki join the superhero group Young Allies together.

Anya joins the superhero group Young Allies along with her friend Rikki despite being depowered. During the team&#x27;s first storyline, Anya and Rikki are kidnapped by a team of teenaged supervillains known as the Bastards of Evil. The Bastards link up a video feed of the bound and gagged heroines across televisions, computers, and cell phones throughout New York City, with the intent of executing the girls to build up reputations. After having the duct tape ripped from her mouth by Electro&#x27;s daughter Aftershock, Anya cleverly divides the villains by informing them that Aftershock has lied about her parentage to get a spot on the Bastards. With their captors distracted, Anya and Rikki escape and ultimately defeat the Bastards once the rest of the Young Allies arrive.

===Spider-Girl===
Anya accepts the &quot;Spider-Girl&quot; moniker and begins operating solo, although she frequently interacts with her Young Allies teammates such as Rikki as well as Spider-Man and the Invisible Woman. When Gil is killed, she fights the Red Hulk who she initially believes is responsible. She is eventually convinced that the Red Hulk did not kill Gil, but rather a target of the assassination attempt that also killed her father. Spider-Girl eventually is able to stop the Raven Society organization that was behind Gil&#x27;s death, and the intervening time shows that she made friends with Rocky Flint and fought Ana Kravinoff, the new Hobgoblin, and Screwball.

Later, the Young Allies and several members of the Avengers Academy are kidnapped by Arcade. Anya manages to escape, and works with Reptil to rescue the remaining captives. The two teens flirt with one another, and Anya ends up giving her phone number to Reptil once Arcade is defeated.

During the &quot;Fear Itself&quot; storyline, Anya, X-23, Amadeus Cho, Power Man, and Thunderstrike are teleported to a station in the middle of the Pacific Ocean where they fight samurai Shark Men. Later, Anya and the Young Allies are almost beaten by Hydro-Man until Spider-Man shows up.

===Spider-Island===
During the &quot;Spider-Island&quot; storyline, Anya is attacked by the Sisterhood of the Wasp. She ends up getting an unlikely ally in the Hobgoblin who then flies her to see the Kingpin. When Spider-Girl asks why the Kingpin wants her help, the Kingpin reveals that the crime lord has developed Spider abilities and ended up targeted by the Sisterhood of the Wasp. The Kingpin tells Spider-Girl of locating the Central Wasp Nest. Spider-Girl refuses the Kingpin&#x27;s help and tries enlisting the help of the Young Allies and other heroes, but they are too preoccupied with the Spider outbreak to help. The new Madame Web approaches Spider-Girl and tells her that for better or for worse, she has to team up with her enemy. As they battle against the Society of Wasps, their queen reveals that they have developed a venom to kill all spider-powered people in Manhattan. Spider-Girl, Hobgoblin, the Kingpin, and the Hand fight against the Society of Wasps until Spider-Girl realizes what Madame Web &quot;really&quot; meant by teaming up with her enemy. She gets everyone fighting the Wasps to temporarily assist the Wasps in fighting the spider invasion so the spiders cannot help Adriana Soria, allowing Spider-Man and the Avengers to defeat the Spider-Queen without being overrun by the spiders. In the aftermath, Anya retains her spider powers.

===Enrolled at Avengers Academy===
Anya is part of the new class of students when the Avengers Academy moves to the West Coast Avengers&#x27; former headquarters.

During the &quot;Inhumanity&quot; crossover, Anya gets help from various Avengers (Spider-Woman, Black Widow, the Hulk, and Wolverine) when trying to track down her social studies teacher who was kidnapped while inside an Inhuman cocoon.

===Spider-Verse===
During the &quot;Spider-Verse&quot; storyline, Spider-Girl joined Spider-Man, Spider-Woman and other spider totems from all over the multiverse to fight the Inheritors who threatened to destroy every Spider from all realities in the event &quot;Spider-Verse&quot;. Her abilities were indispensable for the Spider-Army to discover the Inheritors&#x27; plan, as her powers and relationship with the Spider Society allowed her to read their scrolls.

After the Inheritors were defeated and exiled to an irradiated Earth, the spider totems proceeded to return to their respective realities. After the universe of Spider-UK was revealed to have been destroyed while he was fighting the Inheritors, he decided to stay in Loomworld, the former base of the Inheritors, and use the Web of Life and Destiny to reach out to any reality in need of a Spider-Man. Spider-Girl decided to join him to utilize her knowledge of the totems.

===Secret Wars===
During the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; event when all universes were destroyed and their remains formed a single planet called Battleworld, Anya and Spider-UK found themselves in the Battleworld domain called Arachnia with no memories of how they got there. They eventually discovered and teamed up with other Spider-powered people (consisting of Spider-Woman, Spider-Ham, Spider-Man Noir, and Spider-Man: India), neither of whom remembered their previous encounter during the original &quot;Spider-Verse&quot;.

===Web Warriors===
Following the conclusion of &quot;Secret Wars&quot; the team of six Spiders that formed during the event will rename itself and feature in a new ongoing series called &quot;Web Warriors&quot;, a name that was coined by Peter Parker from the &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; TV series during the original &quot;Spider-Verse&quot;.

===End of the Spider-Verse===
During the &quot;End of the Spider-Verse&quot; storyline, Anya helps in the fight against Shathra. After Shathra was killed, Anya revives those who were struck by the totem dagger which also revived the then-unknown Spider-Boy.

Spider-Boy later visits the building where the Great Web of Life and Destiny is so that Anya can fix the part that causes nobody to remember Spider-Boy. After throwing out Howard the Duck after Spider-Man asked if him as a Spider-Man variant is real or not, Anya, Madame Web, and Silk work to help Spider-Boy through whatever way they can. They do have a setback when Spider-Boy accidentally switches places with Takuya Yamashiro of Earth-51778. Afterwards, Anya, Madame Web, and Silk find that Spider-Boy is now lost in the Spider-Verse as he ends up on Earth-65.

==Powers and abilities==
===As Araña===
As Araña, she originally possessed superhuman strength (able to lift three tons), speed, stamina, reflexes/reactions, agility, coordination, balance, and endurance. Anya had the ability to cling to walls, and to sprout a spider-like exoskeleton around her body which enhanced these abilities and protected her from damage. When her exoskeleton was ripped out by Doomsday Man, she retained her primary powers. Anya invented spider-like grappling hooks, which she uses to swing from buildings and as whip-like weapons, though she has found these to be harder to use since losing her abilities.

===As Spider-Girl===

Writer Paul Tobin stated In an interview with Newsarama that as Spider-Girl, the character initially lacks superpowers, but Tobin will be &quot;staying away from having her feel crippled by any power loss; it&#x27;s for sure on her mind, but Anya is a character that wants to focus on what she &quot;can&quot; do.&quot; Tobin revealed that Anya regains her powers in the &quot;Spider-Island&quot; storyline. The Jackal copies Spider-Man&#x27;s powers into the entire non-superhuman population of New York, including Anya. Anya submits to the mass cure, but retains her copy of these powers nonetheless.

==Other versions==
===Avengers Campus===
In the line cue for Web Slingers: A Spider-Man Adventure, Anya’s locker can be spotted among others, including Peter Parker, Cassie Lang, and America Chavez.

===&quot;Marvel Team-Up: League of Losers&quot;===
Araña features in an arc of Robert Kirkman&#x27;s &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot; vol. 3 featuring a group of C-list heroes dubbed &quot;The League of Losers&quot;. A group of heroes including Araña, Darkhawk, Dagger, Gravity, X-23, Sleepwalker, and Terror go to the future to prevent the villain Chronok from stealing Reed Richards&#x27; time machine, (Chronok comes to the present after killing all of Marvel&#x27;s major heroes). Araña however, dies in an explosion while the team searches for a time machine so that they can travel to the future. The rest of the team succeeds however, and Chronok is defeated. Due to the Marvel Universe&#x27;s method for resolving time travel paradoxes, this story takes place in an alternate timeline.

===MC2===
In the MC2 continuity, an adult version of Anya Corazon as Araña, still accompanied by Miguel (sometimes being referred to as Michael), tests Spider-Girl, then covers for her, posing as a fake seer to throw the Hobgoblin off track when he tries to find her weaknesses. She later takes over Spider-Girl&#x27;s body in an attempt to take down the Black Tarantula, but the two end up trapped in each other&#x27;s bodies. Using Spider-Girl&#x27;s body, Anya is able to get close to Black Tarantula to kiss. However, Black Tarantula, who had been kissed by Anya once before, recognizes and attacks her, using his own powers to reverse the mind-switch. It is later revealed Anya and Black Tarantula have a personal history with one another, and they bond once more when the Tarantula is attacked by Spider-Girl&#x27;s symbiotic clone April. As the gang war concludes, Black Tarantula agrees to give up his title as the current Kingpin of Crime and decides to marry Anya.

===What If?===
In the &quot;What If? Spider-Man: Grim Hunt&quot;, an alternative possibility for the events of Grim Hunt begins with the decision of Spider-Man to kill Kraven. Araña, scarred by things that she should not have seen is transported by the new Madame Web to her residence. Later Madame Web appears in her room in the middle of the night asking Anya to be Spider-Girl. Anya refuses the proposal because she is worried that if she fights against Peter she will make the same decision he made. In the middle of the battle Madame Web teleports herself to get Araña to confront and defeat Peter. Peter ends up blinded by a shotgun he was attempting to use on her. Araña takes over as the head Spider while Peter is left permanently blinded and distant from Mary Jane.

<doc id="1167596" wikidata="Q1495317" url="?curid=1167596" title="Gaspee affair">
<text>The &quot;Gaspee&quot; affair was a significant event in the lead-up to the American Revolution. HMS &quot;Gaspee&quot; was a Royal Navy revenue schooner that enforced the Navigation Acts around Newport, Rhode Island, in 1772. It ran aground in shallow water while chasing the packet boat &quot;Hannah&quot; on June 9 off Warwick, Rhode Island. A group of men led by Abraham Whipple and John Brown I attacked, boarded, and burned the &quot;Gaspee&quot; to the waterline.

The event sharply increased tensions between American colonists and Crown officials, particularly given that it had followed the Boston Massacre in 1770. Crown officials in Rhode Island aimed to increase their control over the colony&#x27;s legitimate trade and stamp out smuggling in order to increase their revenue from the colony. Concomitantly, Rhode Islanders increasingly protested the Stamp Act, the Townshend Acts and other British policies that had interfered with the colony&#x27;s traditional businesses, which primarily rested on involvement in the triangular slave trade.

Along with similar events in Narragansett Bay, the affair marked the first acts of violent uprising against Crown authority in British North America, preceding the Boston Tea Party by more than a year and moving the Thirteen Colonies as a whole toward the coming war for independence.

==Background==

The British Customs service had a history of facing strong resistance in the Thirteen Colonies in the 18th century. Britain was at war during much of this period and was not in a strategic position to risk antagonizing its overseas colonies. Several successive ministries implemented new policies following Britain&#x27;s victory in the French and Indian War (the component of the Seven Years&#x27; War in North America) in an attempt to increase control within the colonies and to recoup the expensive cost of the war. The British Parliament argued that revenue was necessary to bolster military and naval defensive positions along the borders of their distant colonies and also to pay the debt which Britain had incurred in pursuing the war against France.

One policy included deputizing the Royal Navy&#x27;s officers to enforce customs laws in American ports. The Admiralty purchased six Marblehead sloops and schooners and gave them Anglicized French names based on their recent acquisitions in Canada, removing the French accents from &quot;St John&quot;, &quot;St Lawrence&quot;, &quot;Chaleur&quot;, &quot;Hope&quot;, &quot;Magdalen,&quot; and &quot;Gaspee&quot;.

The enforcements became increasingly intrusive and aggressive in Narragansett Bay. Rhode Islanders finally responded by attacking in 1764, and they burned the ship in 1768 on Goat Island in Newport harbor.

===Duddingston and HMS &quot;Gaspee&quot;===

In early 1772, Lieutenant William Duddingston sailed HMS &quot;Gaspee&quot; into Narragansett Bay in Rhode Island to enforce customs collection and mandatory inspection of cargo. He arrived in Rhode Island in February and met with Governor Joseph Wanton. Soon after he began patrolling Narragansett Bay, &quot;Gaspee&quot; stopped and inspected the sloop &quot;Fortune&quot; on February 17 and seized 12 hogsheads of undeclared rum. Duddingston sent &quot;Fortune&quot; and the seized rum to Boston, believing that any seized items left in a Rhode Island port would be reclaimed by the colonists.

This overbold move of sending &quot;Fortune&quot; to Boston brought outrage within the Rhode Island colony, because Duddingston had taken upon himself the authority to determine where the trial should take place concerning this seizure, completely superseding the authority of Governor Wanton by doing so. Furthermore, it was a direct violation of the Rhode Island Royal Charter of 1663 to hold a trial outside of Rhode Island on an arrest that took place within the colony.

After this, Duddingston and his crew became increasingly aggressive in their searches, boardings, and seizures, even going so far as to stop merchants who were on shore and force searches of their wares. Public resentment and outrage continued to escalate against &quot;Gaspee&quot; in particular and against the British in general. A local sheriff threatened Duddingston with arrest, and Admiral John Montagu responded with a letter threatening to hang as pirates anyone who made effort to rescue ships taken by Duddingston during his operations.

On March 21, Rhode Island Deputy Governor Darius Sessions wrote to Governor Wanton regarding Duddingston, and he requested that the basis of Duddingston&#x27;s authority be examined. In the letter, Sessions includes the opinion of Chief Justice Stephen Hopkins, who argues that &quot;no commander of any vessel has any right to use any authority in the Body of the Colony without previously applying to the Governor and showing his warrant for so doing.&quot; Wanton wrote to Duddingston the next day, demanding that he &quot;produce me your commission and instructions, if any you have, which was your duty to have done when you first came within the jurisdiction of this Colony.&quot; Duddingston returned a rude reply to the Governor, refusing to leave his ship or to acknowledge Wanton&#x27;s elected authority within Rhode Island.

==Incident==
On June 9, &quot;Gaspee&quot; gave chase to the packet ship &quot;Hannah&quot; but ran aground in shallow water on the northwestern side of the bay on what is now Gaspee Point. The crew were unable to free the ship, and Duddingston decided to wait for high tide to set the vessel afloat. Before that could happen, however, a band of Providence men led by John Brown I decided to act on the &quot;opportunity offered of putting an end to the trouble and vexation she daily caused.&quot; They rowed out to the ship and boarded it at the break of dawn on June 10. The crew put up a feeble resistance in which they were attacked with handspikes, and Lieutenant Duddingston was shot and wounded in the groin. The boarding party casually read through the ship&#x27;s papers before forcing the crew off the ship and setting it aflame.

A few days after being forced off the ship, Duddingston was arrested by a sheriff for an earlier seizure of colonial cargo. His commanding officer Montagu freed him by paying his fine and then promptly sent him back to England to face a court-martial on the incident.

Joseph Bucklin was the man who shot Duddingston; other men who participated included Brown&#x27;s brother Joseph of Providence, Simeon Potter of Bristol, and Robert Wickes of Warwick.

===Charges and investigative commission===
Previous attacks by the Americans on British naval vessels had gone unpunished. In one case, a customs yacht had been destroyed by fire with no administrative response. 

But in 1772, the Admiralty would not ignore the destruction of one of its military vessels on station. The American Department consulted the solicitor and attorneys general, who investigated and advised the Privy Council on the legal and constitutional options available. This included charges of arson in royal dockyards but the idea was dismissed as not legally credible, as &quot;Gaspee&quot; was not in a dockyard when it was burned. 
The Crown turned to a centuries-old institution of investigation: the Royal Commission of Inquiry, made up of the chiefs of the supreme courts of Massachusetts, New York, and New Jersey, the judge of the vice-admiralty of Boston, and Rhode Island Governor Wanton.

The Dockyard Act passed in April demanded that anyone suspected of burning British ships should be extradited and tried in England; however, the &quot;Gaspee&quot; raiders were charged with treason. The task of the commission was to determine which colonists had sufficient evidence against them to warrant shipping them to England for trial. The commission was unable to obtain sufficient evidence and declared their inability to deal with the case.

===Whig response===
Colonial Whigs were alarmed at the prospect of Americans being sent to England for trial, and a committee of correspondence was formed in Boston to consult on the crisis. In Virginia, the House of Burgesses was so alarmed that they also formed an inter-colonial committee of correspondence to consult with similar committees throughout the Thirteen Colonies. 

The Reverend John Allen preached a sermon at the Second Baptist Church in Boston which utilized the &quot;Gaspee&quot; affair to warn listeners about greedy monarchs, corrupt judges, and conspiracies in the London government. This sermon was printed seven different times in four colonial cities, becoming one of the most popular pamphlets of Colonial America. This pamphlet and editorials by numerous colonial newspaper editors awoke colonial Whigs from a lull of inactivity in 1772, thus inaugurating a series of conflicts that culminated in the Battles of Lexington and Concord.

== Aftermath and legacy ==

The British authorities called for the apprehension and trial of the people responsible for shooting Duddingston and destroying the &quot;Gaspee&quot;. Governor Wanton and Deputy Governor Sessions echoed those same sentiments, but they lacked any enthusiasm for punishing their fellow Rhode Islanders. A British midshipman from &quot;Gaspee&quot; described the attackers as &quot;merchants and masters of vessels, who were at my bureau reading and examining my papers.&quot; 

Admiral Montagu wrote to Governor Wanton on July 8, nearly a month after the burning of the schooner, and utilized the account of Aaron Briggs, an indentured servant claiming to have participated in the June 9 burning. Montagu identified five Rhode Islanders, in varying levels of detail, whom he wanted Wanton to investigate and bring to justice: John Brown I, Joseph Brown, Simeon Potter, Dr. Weeks, and Richmond.

Governor Wanton responded to this demand by examining the claims made by Aaron Briggs. Samuel Tompkins and Samuel Thurston, the proprietors of the Prudence Island farm where Briggs worked, gave testimony challenging his account of June 9. Both men stated that Briggs had been present at work the evening of June 9 and early in the morning on June 10. Additionally, Wanton received further evidence from two other indentured servants working with Briggs, and both stated that Briggs had been present throughout the night in question. Thus, Wanton believed that Briggs was no more than an imposter. Duddingston and Montagu challenged Wanton&#x27;s assertions, Montagu saying that &quot;it is clear to me from many corroborating circumstances, that he is no imposter.&quot;

Historian Joey La Neve DeFrancesco argued that the &quot;Gaspee&quot; affair resulted from the desire of the colonial elite in Rhode Island to protect their involvement in the triangular slave trade, which formed the backbone of the colony&#x27;s economy. DeFrancesco noted that British regulations had threatened the ability of Rhode Island merchants, many of whom participated in the attack on the &quot;Gaspee&quot;, to profit from slavery and the industries which were dependent on the slave trade, such as the rum and molasses trades. DeFrancesco wrote that the colonists&#x27; &quot;supposed fight for liberty was in fact a fight for the freedom to profit from the business of slavery&quot;, and claimed that celebrations of the incident in Rhode Island represent &quot;New England’s historical amnesia on slavery.&quot;

==Commemorations==
Pawtuxet Village commemorates the &quot;Gaspee&quot; affair each year with its &quot;Gaspee Days&quot; festival. This multi-day event includes fireworks, arts and crafts, and races, but the highlight is the Gaspee Days parade, which features burning the &quot;Gaspee&quot; in effigy and other entertainments.

<doc id="1167597" wikidata="Q273226" url="?curid=1167597" title="Ève Angeli">
<text>Vanessa Annelyse Ève Garcin (born 25 August 1980 in Sète, Hérault, France), better known by her stage name Ève Angeli, is a French pop singer, who won an NRJ Music Award for Best New French Artist in 2000–2002.

==Biography==
She began her rise to fame on the television show Graines de star in 1999. Her star-making performance on the show led to a major-label recording contract with Sony Music and the eventual release of her debut single, &quot;Avant de venir&quot; in 2000. 
The lead single from her forthcoming full-length album debut, &quot;Aime-Moi&quot; (2002), &quot;Avant de Partir&quot; was a Top Five hit on the French singles chart. 
The follow-up single &quot;Elle&quot; was a major hit also, breaking into the Top Ten, and though successive singles &quot;Je Sais&quot; and &quot;C&#x27;est Pour Ça&quot; were less popular, the run of hit singles helped carry Aime-Moi to number 11 on the French albums chart.
In 2002 Angeli won the NRJ Music Award for Best New French Artist and released her second album, &quot;Nos Différences&quot;, which spawned a modest hit with its title track, a bilingual collaboration with the British boy band A1. 
Relative to her debut album, however, &quot;Nos Différences&quot; was a disappointment and Angeli subsequently receded from the spotlight for a couple years. 
She re-emerged in 2004 with the reality TV show &quot;La Ferme Célébrités&quot;, a greatest-hits compilation &quot;Le Meilleur d&#x27;Eve Angeli&quot;, and the new single &quot;Une Chanson dans le Coeur,&quot; her biggest hit in years. Her third album, &quot;Viens&quot; (2005), followed, and while it spawned a couple modest hits with &quot;Viens&quot; and &quot;Je Vais T&#x27;aimer,&quot; it continued to mark a downturn in Angeli&#x27;s commercial success and concluded her association with Sony.

In subsequent years, Angeli published a book, &quot;Mes Evangélismes: Pensées d&#x27;une Blonde&quot; (2007), and released her first independent album, &quot;Revolution&quot; (2008).

<text>Philip Farkas (March 5, 1914 – December 21, 1992) was the principal French horn player in the Chicago Symphony Orchestra for many years, and he left in 1960 to join the music faculty at Indiana University School of Music. His books include &quot;The Art of French Horn Playing&quot; (considered the field&#x27;s seminal work), &quot;The Art of Brass Playing&quot;, &quot;The Art of Musicianship&quot;, and &quot;A Photo Study of 40 Virtuoso Horn Players&#x27; Embouchures&quot;. Nancy Jordan Fako wrote his biography, &quot;Philip Farkas and His Horn - A Happy, Worthwhile Life&quot;. Later in his life he helped design the Holton Farkas horn.

==Life==
Farkas was born on March 5, 1914, in Chicago to Anna Cassidy Farkas and Emil Nelson Farkas. March 5 is called the Horn Duumvirate Date, as it is the birth date of both Farkas and Barry Tuckwell, two great horn players of the 20th century. His parents were ignorant about music, but his mother encouraged him to take piano lessons as his introduction to music. Around the age of twelve his Boy Scout troop needed a bugler, so he volunteered. He sought tutoring from a neighbor who played the trumpet, and soon became very good. Around the age of fourteen he started to develop asthma. His parents thought it would be best if he played a wind instrument in band, but the school only had a bass drum and a tuba available at the moment, so he chose the tuba.

Farkas had to take a street car to school, and the conductor began to complain at the tuba&#x27;s size. Farkas asked him what instrument would be more convenient and the conductor pointed to a horn case belonging to a band that was on the street. Soon after, Farkas and his father went to downtown Chicago and rented a Schmidt horn for three dollars a month.

After playing for a while, he pursued a profession as a horn player. While still in high school, he became the youngest member of the All-Chicago High School Orchestra, first horn player in the Chicago Civic Orchestra, and first horn in the Kansas City Philharmonic as his first professional horn debut.

He played first chair in the Chicago Symphony, Boston, and Cleveland orchestras, as the only player ever offered the solo horn positions in these three major orchestras and the youngest principal player in the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Farkas was a music professor at Indiana University School of Music, Northwestern University, Cleveland Institute, Kansas City Conservatory, De Paul University, and Roosevelt University. His pupils included Douglas Hill and Paul Marcotte.

Farkas held many clinics and performed as a soloist nationwide. He founded the Wind Music Inc. publishing company. He partnered with Chicago trumpeter Renold Schilke in the founding of Schilke Music Products and as consultants to the musical instrument division of Yamaha Corporation. He received a doctorate in music, presented by Eastern Michigan University in April 1978.

He designed the top-selling Holton-Farkas horn made by the Frank Holton Company and a large selection of mouthpieces. He wrote and published four best-selling books to help French horn players, brass players, and all musicians improve in the art. His first book, &quot;The Art of French Horn Playing&quot;, is nicknamed the bible of horn players.

He continued to practice his horn every day until his death on December 21, 1992, at the age of 78.

<text>Robert Jerry Lanier Jr. (September 10, 1948 – May 10, 2022) was an American professional basketball player. He played center for the Detroit Pistons and the Milwaukee Bucks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Lanier was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1992.

In 14 NBA seasons, Lanier played in eight NBA All-Star Games and was named Most Valuable Player of the 1974 game. His accomplishments came despite a long history with knee injuries. He had his No. 16 jersey retired by both the Pistons and the Bucks and his No. 31 jersey retired by St. Bonaventure University, for whom he played college basketball. After retiring from playing he was an assistant coach for the Golden State Warriors, and briefly served as their interim head coach. He went on to work as an NBA Cares Global Ambassador.

==Early life==
Robert Jerry Lanier Jr. was born on September 10, 1948, in Buffalo, New York. He was the son of Robert Sr. and Nannette Lanier. His mother raised him in the Seventh-day Adventist Church.

Growing up, Lanier initially was rejected in his efforts to play basketball. When he tried out to play for his grammar school team, Lanier was told by a coach that his feet (size 11 at age 11) were too large for him to become a successful athlete. Although he was tall by age 16, Lanier did not make the varsity basketball squad in his sophomore year at Bennett High School because he was deemed to be too clumsy.

During his junior year, he was encouraged to try out again by new coach Fred Schwepker, who taught Lanier as a student in his biology class. Lanier tried out again and made the team. He averaged 21.5 points and was named to the All-City team as a junior. In his senior year, he averaged 25.0 points and he earned All-Western New York State honors. In each year, he led Bennett to a Buffalo city title. Lanier graduated in 1966.

Lanier was recruited by more than 100 universities; however, he chose to attend St. Bonaventure University, approximately an hour and a half away from his home. There, he played for coach Larry Weise. &quot;There was recruiting competition, but the advantage I had, and what I sold, was that his parents could come watch him play&quot;, said Coach Weise. &quot;He picked St. Bonaventure. His parents were at every game.&quot;

In 2009 as &quot;The Buffalo News&quot; celebrated 50 years of All-Western New York (WNY) basketball selections, Lanier, who was a 1965–66 All-WNY first team selection was named to the All-time All-WNY team along with Christian Laettner, Curtis Aiken, Paul Harris and Mel Montgomery.

==College career==
Lanier was a three-time All-America selection (1968–1970). As a senior in 1970, he led the St. Bonaventure to the NCAA Final Four. Near the end of the regional championship game, he injured his knee in a collision with Villanova&#x27;s Chris Ford and did not play in St. Bonaventure&#x27;s national semifinal loss to Jacksonville University.

That year, Lanier was named the &quot;Coach and Athlete Magazine&quot; player of the year and the Eastern College Athletic Conference&#x27;s Player of the Year. Since 2007 their basketball court has been called the “ Bob Lanier court”

===Freshman year (1966–1967)===
Per NCAA rules at the time, Lanier played on the freshman team during his first year at St. Bonaventure.

===Sophomore year (1967–1968)===

As a sophomore in the 1967–68 season, Lanier made an immediate impact and gained national recognition. Lanier led St. Bonaventure (13–9 in the previous season) to an undefeated regular season (26–0) and a number three final poll ranking. He averaged 26.2 points and 15.6 rebounds per game for the season. Against Loyola Maryland, Lanier had 27 rebounds, leading St. Bonaventure to a 94–78 victory.

In the 23-team 1968 NCAA tournament, Lanier led St. Bonaventure to a 102–93 victory over Boston College and coach Bob Cousy. The Bonnies were then defeated 91–72 by North Carolina and coach Dean Smith in the East Regional semifinal, ending their undefeated season. Lanier had 32 points and 15 rebounds in the victory over Boston College and 23 points with 9 rebounds in the North Carolina loss. Lanier then fouled out, scoring 18 points with 13 rebounds in the third-place East Region game; St. Bonaventure lost, 92–75, to Columbia.

Lanier was named a second-team All-American, behind Lew Alcindor (who later changed his name to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) at center.

===Junior year (1968–1969)===
In the 1968–69 season, St. Bonaventure finished with a 17–7 record after starting the season 3–5. Against Seton Hall, Lanier scored 51 points, setting the single-game scoring record for St. Bonaventure. Lanier averaged 27.3 points and 15.6 rebounds in 24 games. Lanier was again named a second-team All-American behind Lew Alcindor at center. During his junior year, Lanier was approached by representatives of the American Basketball Association&#x27;s New York Nets, who reportedly offered him $1.2 million to leave school early and join the ABA. However, following his father&#x27;s advice, Lanier chose to remain in school.

===Senior year: NCAA Tournament and knee injury (1969–1970)===
Lanier averaged 29.2 points and 16.0 rebounds as St. Bonaventure finished the 1969–70 regular season 25–1 (with the only loss at Villanova 64–62) and a number three national ranking. In the 25-team 1970 NCAA tournament, Lanier led St. Bonaventure to an 80–72 victory over Davidson College with 28 points and 15 rebounds. He had 24 points and 19 rebounds in an 80–68 victory over NC State, and had 26 points and 14 rebounds in the 97–74 victory over Villanova as St. Bonaventure advanced to the Final Four.

However, Lanier injured his knee near the end of the regional championship game in a collision with Villanova&#x27;s Chris Ford. The injury was severe enough that he could not play in the Final Four and eventually required the first of eight knee surgeries he would undergo throughout his life. In the Final Four, the Bonnies lost to Jacksonville University, whose center was future Hall of Famer Artis Gilmore. St. Bonaventure was whistled for 32 personal fouls and was outscored 37–15 at the free-throw line in the 91–83 loss. In the third-place game, the Bonnies lost to New Mexico State, finishing the season 25–3.

&quot;Every year at this time you start thinking about it and my players start thinking about it,&quot; reflected Coach Larry Weise at age 81. &quot;We have a reunion every three, four years and it&#x27;s the same with them. It was a magical moment in our lives, no question. In our hearts, we knew we were good enough to win the championship.&quot; &quot;I think I appreciate it even more than my (college) teammates,&quot; Lanier reflected on the Final Four in 1985, &quot;because I had a basis for comparison. It wasn&#x27;t the money, or who got the &#x27;numbers&#x27; like in the NBA. We weren&#x27;t any big stars, it was a couple of guys from Buffalo and a guy from Troy all blending together.&quot;

Lanier was named a first-team All-American at center alongside future Hall of Famers Dan Issel (center, Kentucky), Pete Maravich (point guard, LSU) and Calvin Murphy (point guard, Niagara), along with College Basketball Hall of Famer Rick Mount (shooting guard, Purdue). Lanier graduated from St. Bonaventure with a degree in business administration. Lanier holds St. Bonaventure records for scoring and rebounding, averaging 27.6 points and 15.7 rebounds, with 57% shooting in 75 career games.

In March 2018, St. Bonaventure won its first game in the NCAA tournament since 1970, defeating UCLA. Coach Mark Schmidt said, &quot;It can&#x27;t get better. Our guys just fought, we persevered. ... In 1970, you know, Bob Lanier got hurt, and didn&#x27;t have a chance to play UCLA and ... this is for him.&quot; &quot;When I got the job here 11 years ago, we hear the stories about 1970,&quot; Schmidt said. &quot;And everybody talks about if Lanier was healthy, they would have taken on UCLA. This victory is for those guys.&quot;

==Professional career==

=== Detroit Pistons (1970–1980) ===
Lanier was the first overall pick by the National Basketball Association&#x27;s Detroit Pistons in the 1970 NBA draft. He was also a territorial pick by the New York Nets of the American Basketball Association in the 1970 ABA Draft.

Lanier played while still recovering from surgery. He was named to the 1971 NBA All-Rookie Team, averaging 15.6 points and 8.1 rebounds for the 45–37 Pistons in 24 minutes per game under Coach Butch van Breda Kolff. &quot;I wasn&#x27;t healthy when I got to the league,&quot; Lanier reflected. &quot;I shouldn&#x27;t have played my first year. But there was so much pressure from them to play, I would have been much better off—and our team would have been much better served—if I had just sat out that year and worked on my knee. My knee was so sore every single day that it was ludicrous to be doing what I was doing.&quot; Lanier rehabilitated his knee with the help of Coach van Breda Kolff, who had Lanier stay at his beachfront house for 2½ weeks to run in the sand and strengthen his knee and legs.

Lanier became a star for Detroit, playing alongside teammate Dave Bing. He averaged more than 21 points per game for each of the next eight seasons, with a high mark of 25.7 PPG in the 1971–72 season. Lanier averaged more than 11 rebounds per game in seven straight seasons. On November 28, 1972, Lanier scored 48 points, a Pistons franchise record to this day for points scored in a game by a center, during a 129–96 win over the Portland Trail Blazers. On January 15, 1974, Lanier led all scorers in that season&#x27;s NBA All Star Game with 24 points, and was named the All-Star Game MVP.

Detroit was a franchise in constant transition. Lanier played under eight coaches in ten seasons: Butch van Breda Kolff (1970–1971), Terry Dischinger (1971), Earl Lloyd (1971–1972), Ray Scott (1972–1975), Herb Brown (1975–1977), Bob Kauffman (1977–1978), Dick Vitale (1978–1979), and Richie Adubato (1979–1980). Each coach was hired or fired in mid-season. Of his time in Detroit, Lanier said, &quot;I think &#x27;73–74 was our best team [52–30]. We had Dave [Bing], Stu Lantz, John Mengelt, Chris Ford, Don Adams, Curtis Rowe, George Trapp. But then for some reason, they traded six guys off that team before the following year. I just didn&#x27;t feel we ever had the leadership... That was a rough time because, at the end of every year, you&#x27;d be so despondent.&quot;

Lanier&#x27;s latter years in Detroit were marred by recurring injuries, as he never played more than 64 games in any of his last four seasons as a Piston.

In his ten seasons with the Detroit Pistons, Lanier averaged a double-double 22.7 points, 11.8 rebounds, 3.3 assists, 2.0 blocks and 1.2 steals in 681 games. Lanier is the Pistons&#x27; all-time leader in scoring average (22.7 ppg); he ranks second in total rebounds (8,063), third in total points (15,488), and was voted to seven All-Star games.

=== Milwaukee Bucks (1980–1984) ===
On February 4, 1980, Lanier was traded by the Pistons to the Milwaukee Bucks for Kent Benson and a 1980 first-round draft pick (which the Pistons used to select Larry Drew). On April 20 of that year, Lanier scored 19 points and grabbed 15 rebounds in a Game 7 loss against the Seattle SuperSonics in the Western Conference Semifinals (the final season for the Bucks in that conference).

On May 5, 1982, Lanier&#x27;s 27 points led the Bucks to a Game 5 playoff victory against the Philadelphia 76ers. The Bucks eventually lost the series. Lanier&#x27;s 27 points represented his highest single post-season game point total for the Bucks. In Lanier&#x27;s five seasons with the Bucks, they won the Midwest Division championship each year under Coach Don Nelson, with Lanier playing alongside teammates Marques Johnson, Sidney Moncrief, Quinn Buckner, Junior Bridgeman, and Dave Cowens. Still highly effective, but with aging knees, Lanier played a key role with the Bucks while averaging nearly 10 minutes less per game in his Milwaukee tenure that he had in Detroit (36.2 to 26.8).

Of going to Milwaukee, Lanier said, &quot;I wanted the trade. I got to Milwaukee... and the people gave me a standing ovation and really made me feel welcome. It was the start of a positive change. I just wish I had played with that kind of talent around me when I was young. But if I had had Marques [Johnson] and Sidney [Moncrief] and all of them around me? Damn.&quot; Lanier officially retired from the Milwaukee Bucks on September 24, 1984. He cited reoccurring knee injuries as the reason for his retirement. In 278 games with the Bucks, Lanier averaged 26 minutes, 13.5 points, 5.9 rebounds, 2.7 assists, and 1.0 steals per game. He played in the 1982 All-Star Game with Milwaukee. During Lanier&#x27;s five-season tenure, the Bucks advanced as far as the Eastern Conference Finals twice.

===NBA career summary===
Over his fourteen-season NBA career, Lanier played in 959 games, averaging 20.1 points, 10.1 rebounds, 3.1 assists, 1.5 blocks, and 1.1 steals per game. He scored 19,248 total points and had 9,698 total rebounds. In 67 career playoff games, Lanier averaged 18.6 points, 9.7 rebounds, 3.5 assists, and 1.5 blocks. Lanier played in eight NBA All-Star Games; he never appeared in an NBA Finals game.

&quot;Bob probably wasn&#x27;t as good a total player as he could have been because of the knee injury,&quot; said Hall of Famer Willis Reed. Reed acknowledged that Lanier &quot;probably was one of the best all-around big men ever to play the game of basketball.&quot; Lanier was known across the league as being tenacious, and was referred to as an &quot;enforcer&quot; due to his physical style of play. His intensity sometimes spilled over from playing into fighting, as he knocked out Atlanta&#x27;s Bob Christian in 1971 and broke the nose of Detroit&#x27;s Bill Laimbeer in 1983. In the 1977 NBA Playoffs, in the third game of a best of three series against Golden State Warriors, the game was marred by a 3rd quarter fight with Charles Dudley of Golden State tangling with Eric Money of the Pistons. The fight spilled into the stands as a Warriors fan punching Piston M. L. Carr and Lanier then decking the fan. Reflective of the different era in the game, personal fouls were called on Dudley and Money, and the game resumed with the Warriors winning 109–101.

==Coaching career==
===Golden State Warriors (1994–1995)===
From 1994–95, Lanier served as an assistant coach for the Golden State Warriors under his former coach, Don Nelson. After Nelson resigned, Lanier was named interim head coach on February 13, 1995. He compiled a 12–25 win–loss record in 37 games and the Warriors finished 26–56 overall.

==Other ventures==

Lanier owned and operated Bob Lanier Enterprises, Inc., a promotional marketing company which was a member of the Proforma network.

Lanier was a spokesperson and chairman of the NBA&#x27;s &quot;Stay In School&quot; program (later renamed Read to Achieve) from 1989 to 1994.

From 2005 to 2022, Lanier was the NBA Cares Global Ambassador. Lanier routinely worked with youth-serving programs that supported education, youth, and family development, and health-related causes.

==In popular culture==
Lanier appeared as a member of the Detroit team in the cult classic basketball film &quot;The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh&quot; in 1979 alongside Pistons teammates Chris Ford, Eric Money, John Shumate, Kevin Porter, and Leon Douglas.

Lanier was hired as basketball coach for the film &quot;White Men Can&#x27;t Jump&quot;. Lanier was impressed with lead actors Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes, suggesting both reached a Division II college basketball skill level. He also noted that between the two of them, Harrelson was the better player.

Lanier was also mentioned in the 1980 movie &quot;Airplane!&quot; when an exasperated Kareem Abdul Jabbar admonished Joey, &quot;Tell your old man to drag Walton and Lanier up and down the court for 48 minutes!&quot;

==Personal life and death==

Lanier was married and divorced twice and had five children: Walter “Jack” Lanier, Kimberly Lanier, Tiffany Lanier, Robert Lanier III, and Khalia Lanier. At the time of his death, he had 7 grandchildren.

The knee injuries that plagued Lanier&#x27;s later career worsened as he aged. He underwent several surgeries after his retirement, the last being in 2017.

At the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts, visitors are able to compare the size of their foot to that of Lanier. The largest shoe ever created by shoe company Allen Edmonds was a size 22 for Lanier.

In September 2018, Lanier shared one of his most notable NBA memories: &quot;...when I was still playing in Milwaukee and I was getting gas at a station on, I think it was Center St. A guy came up to me and said, &#x27;My dad is sick. And you&#x27;re his favorite player. Could you come up to the house and say hello to him? The house is right next door.&#x27; So I went over, I went upstairs. The guy was laying there in his bed. His son said, &#x27;This is Bob,&#x27; and he was like, &#x27;I know.&#x27; And he just had a little smile, a twinkle in his eye. And he grabbed my hand and squeezed it. And we said a little prayer. About two weeks later, his dad had died. And he left a card at the Bucks office, just saying &#x27;Thank you for making one of my dad&#x27;s final days into a good day.&#x27;&quot;

Lanier died on May 10, 2022, after a brief illness. He was 73.

* In 2000, Lanier was the recipient of the Congressional &quot;Horizon &amp; Leadership Award.&quot; The award is presented annually by the Joint Leadership Commission of the United States Congress and the Board of Directors of The Congressional Award Foundation to individuals who have made an exceptional impact on the lives of America&#x27;s young people.
* In 2006, Lanier was inducted into the College Basketball Hall of Fame.
* In 2007, Lanier received the National Civil Rights Museum Sports Legacy Award. It was awarded for his significant contribution to civil and human rights internationally in the spirit of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
* The basketball court at Lanier&#x27;s &quot;alma mater&quot;, St. Bonaventure, was named in his honor in 2007. &quot;Bob Lanier Court&quot; is in the Reilly Center Arena. Said the 2007 press release, &quot;Bob Lanier elevated an already established St. Bona basketball program to the next level and is an ideal ambassador of the sport. When we were thinking about names for the court he was the obvious choice and a perfect fit.&quot;
* Lanier was named co-recipient of the 2009 &quot;The Mannie Jackson – Basketball&#x27;s Human Spirit Award.&quot; The award was given by the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in recognition of his passion for the game of basketball and his continued commitment to community service.
* Following Lanier&#x27;s death, Detroit Pistons players wore a black stripe with No. 16 across the right shoulder (as seen from the front) of their jerseys for the 2022–23 NBA season.

<doc id="1167607" wikidata="Q4933111" url="?curid=1167607" title="Bob Lanier (politician)">
<text>Robert Clayton Lanier (March 10, 1925 – December 20, 2014) was an American businessman and politician who served as mayor of Houston, Texas, from 1992 to 1998. Before becoming mayor, Lanier had a notable career as a lawyer, banker, and real estate developer. He also held significant public service positions, including chairman of the Texas Highway Commission and chairman of the Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County (METRO). As mayor, he focused on improving infrastructure, public safety, and the city’s diversity. Lanier was re-elected in 1993 and 1995, and after leaving office, remained active in real estate and public policy. At the time of his death, he was the oldest living former mayor of Houston.

==Background==
Robert Clayton Lanier was born on March 10, 1925, and grew up in the oil-patch suburb of Baytown, Texas. He served in the Navy in World War II and graduated from the University of New Mexico. He earned his law degree from the University of Texas, then practiced law at the powerful Houston firm Baker &amp; Botts for a decade before switching to banking and ultimately becoming a major real estate developer.

Before he was elected mayor, he was the chairman of the Texas Highway Commission. He later headed the annual Lanier Public Policy Conference at the University of Houston.

Mr. Lanier underwent triple-bypass surgery in 1998, three months after suffering a mild heart attack. In 2006 he collapsed at the memorial service for Kenneth L. Lay, the convicted founder of the Enron Corporation, and was taken to the hospital.

Mr. Lanier was married three times. According to a Houston funeral home, his survivors include his wife, Elyse; five sons; three daughters; and 11 grandchildren.

==Political career==
In 1983, Governor Mark White appointed Lanier to the Texas Highway Commission, where he served as chairman until 1987. He oversaw a $2.5 billion budget and directed the construction, maintenance and operation of the state&#x27;s highway system. During this period, Lanier became an outspoken critic of a plan by Houston&#x27;s Mayor Kathy Whitmire and METRO, Houston’s public transit authority, to build a monorail system.

In April 1988, as part of a compromise with rail advocates, Whitmire appointed Lanier as chairman of Metro. As chairman, Lanier accused Metro staff of hiding studies that showed ridership of a rail system would be less than originally predicted and not as economically viable. Lanier resigned in December 1989 after learning Whitmire would not reappoint him because of his lack of commitment to building a rail system.

Lanier spent months searching for a politician who could knock the 5-term Mayor Whitmire out of office, but he eventually decided to do it himself. In the 1991 Houston Mayoral election, Lanier challenged Whitmire and won on the promise of putting more police on the streets, abandoning the METRO rail plan, and diverting transit funds into paving roads and sidewalks. Lanier was reelected in 1993 and 1995. Term limits prevented his candidacy in 1997, enacted in 1991 and reinforced in 1994 by a grass-roots citizen initiative spearheaded by the conservative political activist Clymer Wright. As mayor, he was affectionately referred to as &quot;Mayor Bob.&quot;

As mayor, Lanier’s actions were guided by three core values:
* That Houston should capitalize on its diversity
* That his administration had to improve the city’s infrastructure, particularly the inner city, and bring it to the level of the more affluent suburbs.
* That public safety should be improved.

== Roles after being mayor ==
Lanier was a founding member of Houston Community College, which he continued to support until the end of his life.

Mayor Lanier also headed the corporation that oversaw construction of the city&#x27;s new Hilton Americas – Houston, the city’s first convention center hotel – a project that started during his administration.

Until his death in 2014, Lanier continued to manage his real estate properties, lectured several times a year, oversaw the Lanier Public Policy Conferences at the University of Houston and participated in various civic, academic and political activities.

==Awards and honors ==
=== Bob Lanier Public Works Building ===
The Bob Lanier Public Works Building, located in downtown Houston, was originally known as the &quot;Electric Building&quot;. Completed in 1968, it had been the headquarters of electricity provider, Houston Lighting and Power (HL&amp;P). In 1999, the City of Houston acquired the building and renovated it to house various city government office, including the Public Work and Engineering Department, and the Planning Department. The Houston City Council voted to rename the renovated building in honor of former mayor (1992-1998) Bob Lanier. 

===Civil rights awards ===

The Texas NAACP presented him its Texas Hero award.

In 1998, he was recognized with thee Hubert Humphrey Civil Rights Award. The award recognized his work as chairman of the &quot;Rebuild America Coalition&quot;, his &quot;Neighborhood to Standard&quot; (NTS) program (which revitalized neighborhoods in downtown Houston), and his stance against an anti-affirmitive action ballot initiative.

===Leadership awards ===
In 2000, he received the Leadership Houston Distinguished Service Award and the Urban Beautification Award from the American Horticultural Society. 

In 2002 he was inducted into the Texas Transportation Institute&#x27;s Hall of Honor at Texas A&amp;M University. 

In August 2007, he was also inducted into the Houston Hall of Fame.

His work in transportation earned him the National Auto Dealers&#x27; Award. His work in finance brought a Bond Market Association Award.

==Death== 

Lanier passed away on December 20, 2014, at the age of 89 from natural causes. He was survived by his wife of 30 years, Elyse, his 4 sons, 3 daughter, and his 11 grandchildren. He was preceded in death by his parents and former wife, Elizabeth Grant Lanier. At the time of his death, he was the oldest living former mayor of Houston, marking the end of a significant chapter in the city’s political and business history.

<doc id="1167614" wikidata="Q710679" url="?curid=1167614" title="Traditional Korean medicine">
<text>Traditional Korean medicine (known in North Korea as Koryo medicine) refers to the forms of traditional medicine practiced in Korea.

==History==

Korean medical traditions originated in ancient and prehistoric times and can be traced back as far as 3000 BCE when stone and bone needles were found in North Hamgyong Province, in present-day North Korea. In Gojoseon, where the founding myth of Korea is recorded, there is a story of a tiger and a bear who wanted to reincarnate in human form and who ate wormwood and garlic. In &quot;Jewang Ungi&quot; (제왕운기), which was written around the time of &quot;Samguk Yusa&quot;, wormwood and garlic are described as &#x27;edible medicine&#x27;, showing that, even in times when incantatory medicine was the mainstream, medicinal herbs were given as curatives in Korea. Medicinal herbs at this time were used as remedial treatment such as easing the pain or tending injury, along with knowing what foods were good for health. 
In the period of the Three Kingdoms, traditional Korean medicine was mainly influenced by other traditional medicines such as ancient Chinese medicine. There was important trade with foreign countries during the period of the Three Kingdoms. “In particular, medical knowledge from China and India supplemented the foundation of traditional medicine that had been handed down from the Old Joseon period.&quot; In Korea, this has “spurred further developments.&quot;

Medicine flourished in the period of the Joseon. For example, the first training system of nurses was instituted under King Taejong (1400–1418), while under the reign of King Sejong the Great (1418–1450) measures were adopted to promote the development of a variety of Korean medicinal ingredients. These efforts were systematized and published in the Hyangyak Jipseongbang (향약집성방, 1433), which was completed and included 703 Korean native medicines, providing an impetus to break away from dependence on Chinese medicine. The medical encyclopaedia named &quot;Classified Collection of Medical Prescriptions&quot; (醫方類聚, 의방유취), which included many classics from traditional chinese medicine, written by Kim Ye-mong (金禮蒙, 김예몽) and other Korean official doctors from 1443 to 1445, was regarded as one of the greatest medical texts of the 15th century. It included more than 50,000 prescriptions and incorporated 153 different Korean and Chinese texts, including the &quot;Concise Prescriptions of Royal Doctors&quot; (御醫撮要方, 어의촬요방) which was written by Choi Chong-jun (崔宗峻, 최종준) in 1226. &quot;Classified Collection of Medical Prescriptions&quot; has very important research value, because it keeps the contents of many ancient Korean and Chinese medical books that had been lost for a long time.
After this, many books on medical specialties were published. There are three physicians from the Joseon Dynasty (1392–1910) who are generally credited with further development of traditional Korean medicine—Heo Jun, Saam, and Yi Je-ma. After the Japanese invasion in 1592, &quot;Dongeui Bogam&quot; (동의보감) was written by Heo Jun, the first of the major physicians. This work further integrated the Korean and Chinese medicine of its time and was influential to Chinese, Japanese and Vietnamese medicine. In the late period of Joseon, Yi Je-ma&#x27;s “unique system of constitutional medicine” illustrates the “nature of” the medicine that has been traditionally developed in Korea by example. Medical treatments were based upon yin and yang principles “and the five elements.&quot; A warm treatment would treat a person who is a yin. On the other hand, a cold treatment would treat a person who is a yang.

The next major influence to traditional Korean medicine is related to Sasang typology (사상의학). Yi Je-ma and his book, &quot;The Principal of Life Preservation in Oriental Medicine&quot; (東醫壽世保元, 동의수세보원) systematically theorized with the influence of Korean Confucianism and his clinical experiences in Korea. Yi Je-ma said that even if patients suffer the same illness, patients need to use different herbal applications to treat the same illness due to the pathophysiologies of individuals. He stresses that the health of human body had a close relationship with the state of mind. He believed that the human mind and body were not separate and they closely reflected each other, and the aspect of mind needed to be considered when examining the causes of disease. Thus, not only food and natural environment but also emotional changes in humans can be another major reason for illness. He believed that medical diagnosis and treatment should be based on person&#x27;s typology rather than on symptoms alone and each person should be given different prescriptions depending on the constitution of the individual. Sasang typology (사상의학) focuses on the individual patients based on different reactions to disease and herbs. Treat illness by the treatment of the root cause through proper diagnosis. Key to this diagnosis is to first determine the internal organs or pathophysiology of each patient.

The next recognized individual is Saam, a priest-physician who is believed to have lived during the 16th century. Although there is much unknown about Saam, including his real name and date of birth, it is recorded that he studied under the famous monk Samyang. He developed a system of acupuncture that employs the five element theory.

In the late Joseon dynasty, positivism was widespread. Clinical evidence was used more commonly as the basis for studying disease and developing cures. Scholars who had turned away from politics devoted themselves to treating diseases and, in consequence, new schools of traditional medicine were established. Simple books on medicine for the common people were published.

Yi Je-ma classified human beings into four main types, based on the emotion that dominated their personality and developed treatments for each type: 
* Tae-Yang (태양, ) or &quot;greater yang&quot;
* So-Yang (소양, ) or &quot;lesser yang&quot;
* Tae-Eum (태음, ) or &quot;greater yin&quot;
* So-Eum (소음, ) or &quot;lesser yin&quot;
The Japanese took control of Korea, which made the Korean traditional medicine fall on difficult times. Colonial rule of the Japanese started since 1910. The continuance of developing Korean medicine was suspended for 40 years due to the Japanese rule. Academic research of this medicine was suspended as well. The suppression lasted until 1945, when Korea was freed from the Japanese rule. In 1951, the enactment of the National Medical Treatment Law established an organized framework for skillful practitioners who use the medicine that has been traditionally developed to treat patients. Koreans and their government supported this medicine. In 1970s, Korean traditional medicine including acupuncture was generally acknowledged by healthcare clinics because of its value.

Originally, Korean traditional medicine was called “medicine of symptoms.&quot; “Principles of traditional medicine call for an assessment of eight symptoms.&quot; These symptoms are categorized “into four pairs: cold/hot, deficiency/sufficiency, large/small, and yin/yang.&quot; Korean traditional medicine is ineffective when used alone in some situations. The medicine from the West can be used with Korean medicine, which is more effective. In Korea, this widespread practice occurs for a long time. Currently, Korean Traditional Medicine is under challenges to undergo scientific examinations such as clinical trials to counter growing distrust. The meme &#x27;한무당&#x27;(Hanmudang), a neologism that relates Korean Traditional Medicine to shamanism has become too prevalent among young generations that there the association of Korean Traditional Medicine Protectionists had to take measures to stop the meme from auto-completing in internet searches.

In general, the history of Korean medicine can be divided into five periods. The first period, up to about the 12th century, was one of the alleged dark ages of Korean medicine, with TKM based primarily on folk tradition and some foreign (mostly Chinese) elements. In the second period, the 13th to 15th centuries, Hyangyak medicine, which emphasized the use of domestic herbs, emerged. Hyangyak medicine is a type of TKM that prescribed only Hyangyak. This local focus was crucial during times of war, when access to foreign medicinal supplies was limited. The third period, the 15th to early 17th centuries, was marked by the creation of the great medical texts such as Hyangyak Jipseongbang, which combined indigenous and foreign knowledge to form a complete system of Korean medicine.

In the 17th to 19th centuries, TKM became more independent with the publication of the &quot;Principles and Practice of Eastern Medicine&quot; (東醫寶鑑, 동의보감, &quot;Dongui Bogam&quot;) in 1613, a seminal text that solidified TKM as distinct from TCM. The fifth period, roughly the 20th and 21st centuries, required a great deal of adjustment to TKM to modern medical research, yet retained TKM. This period is the time of Korea trying to incorporate KM into the national health care system and at the same time dealing with modernization and globalization.

To sum up, the growth of Korean Medicine reveals how traditional wisdom can evolve when faced with external factors or contemporary demands. Synthesis of TKM with modern science traces TKM’s evolution from folk herbal medicine to integration with scientific research, albeit with a cultural dilemma of retaining the past while modernizing. Such progression provides insights into the durability and applicability of traditional systems in the contemporary world.

==Methods==

The most common applications of Korean traditional medicine are acupuncture, herbal medicine, and moxibustion. They describe a combination of natural and medical sciences research. In Korea, adherents of the medicine that has been traditionally developed advise that acupuncture comes first. Moxibustion comes second and herbal medicine comes third. Depending on physical state and particular condition of the individual, these practices can be prescribed in separate ways.

===Herbal medicine===

Herbalism is the study and practice of using plant material for the purpose of food, medicine, or health. They may be flowers, plants, shrubs, trees, moss, lichen, fern, algae, seaweed or fungus. The plant may be used in its entirety or with only specific parts.

Herbal medicines may be presented in many forms including fresh, dried, whole, or chopped. Herbs may be prepared as infusions when an herb is soaked in a liquid or decocted—simmered in water over low heat for a certain period. Some examples of infusion are chamomile or peppermint, using flowers, leaves and powdered herbs. Decocting examples may be rose hips, cinnamon bark, and licorice root consisting of fruits, seeds, barks, and roots. Fresh and dried herbs can be tinctured where herbs are kept in alcohol or contained in a vinegar extract. They can be preserved as syrups such as glycerites in vegetable glycerin or put in honey known as miels.

Non-oral herbal uses consist of creams, baths, oils, ointments, gels, distilled waters, washes, poultices, compresses, snuffs, steams, inhaled smoke and aromatics volatile oils.

Many herbalists consider the patient&#x27;s direct involvement to be critical. These methods are delivered differently depending on the herbal traditions of each area. Nature is not necessarily safe; special attention should be used when grading quality, deciding a dosage, realizing possible effects, and any interactions with herbal medications.

An example of herbal medicine is the use of medicinal mushrooms as a food and as a tea. A notable mushroom used in traditional Korean medicine is &quot;Phellinus linteus&quot;, also known as Song-gen.

Another example of herbal medicine is &quot;cheongsimhwan&quot; (, ), a pill formulated with thirty odd herbs and other medicinal ingredients, including &quot;calculus bovis&quot;, ginseng, musk, and Chinese yam root.

===Acupuncture===

Acupuncture is used to withdraw blood or stimulate certain points on humans and animals by inserting them on specific pressure points of the body. Traditional acupuncture involves the belief that a &quot;life force&quot; (&quot;qi&quot;) circulates within the body in lines called meridians. Scientific investigation has not found any histological or physiological evidence for traditional Chinese concepts such as &quot;qi&quot;, meridians, and acupuncture points, and many modern practitioners no longer support the existence of life force energy (&quot;qi&quot;) flowing through meridians, which was a major part of early belief systems. Pressure points can be stimulated through a mixture of methods ranging from the insertion and withdrawal of very small needles to the use of heat, known as moxibustion. Pressure points can also be stimulated by laser, massage, and electrical means. Constitutional acupuncture, medicinal acupuncture, Sa-am acupuncture, and single-needle acupuncture are unique methods of acupuncture.

===Moxibustion===
Moxibustion is a technique in which heat is applied to the body with a stick or a cone of burning mugwort. The tool is placed over the affected area without burning the skin. The cone or stick can also be placed over a pressure point to stimulate and strengthen the blood. 
A Cochrane Review found moderate certainty evidence for the use of moxibustion plus usual care for reducing the chance of breech presentation of babies but uncertainty about the need for ECV. Moxibustion has also been studied for the treatment of pain, cancer, stroke, ulcerative colitis, constipation, and hypertension. Systematic reviews of moxibustion show that there is a need for further research about these other therapeutic applications to reduce risk of publication bias.

==Education==

===Graduate School of Korean Medicine===
The South Korean government established a national school of traditional Korean medicine to establish its national treasure on a solid basis after the closing of the first modern educational facility (Dong-Je medical school) one hundred years ago by the Japanese invasion.

In 2008, the School of Korean Medicine was established inside Pusan National University with the 50 undergraduate students on the Yangsan medical campus. The new affiliated Korean Medical Hospital and Research Center for Clinical Studies are under construction.

Compared with common private traditional medicine undergraduate schools (6 years), this is a special graduate school (4+4).

=== General Hospital of Koryo Medicine ===
Koryo medicine is a form of traditional medicine used in North Korea and promoted by the North Korean government, providing half of the reported healthcare in the country. It is largely practised in the General Hospital of Koryo Medicine, Pyongyang. Examples of Koryo medicine sold commercially are Kumdang-2 and Royal Blood-Fresh, sold by the Pugang Pharmaceutic Company, both of which are popular with Chinese tourists to North Korea.

== Influence of Western medicine ==
According to Han (1997), Christian missionaries introduced Western medicine to Korea in the late 19th century. It was the time when there was an increased exposure to Western influences and imperialist pressures in Korea, which led to a rapid adoption of Western medical practices. During the Japanese colonial period, the suppression of Hanbang reinforced its decline, and it was treated as secondary and behind Western medicine. However, the late 20th century witnessed a revival of Hanbang, and there was a growing nationalistic sentiment and affluence at that period. 
=== Criticism ===
The primary criticism of the integration of Western medicine into Korean society is its impact on accessibility because the benefits of medical development were mostly available to urban and wealthier parts of the population. This inequality was intensified by the commercialisation of healthcare, where both Western and traditional medicines were marketed aggressively, often prioritising profit over patient care. Furthermore, the overshadowing of traditional practices by Western medicine led to the marginalisation of Korean identity and culture. Despite this criticism, there have been undeniable advancements in public health, including better disease control and medical technologies that have significantly improved the quality of life. Additionally, the establishment of medical schools and training programs has professionalised and standardised healthcare, thus elevating the overall health condition of the nation.

<text>Angela M. Brown (born 1963) is an American dramatic soprano particularly admired for her portrayal of Verdi heroines.

==Early life and education==
Angela Brown was born in 1963 in Indianapolis, Indiana. She is African-American. Her mother, Freddie Mae Brown, was a painter, and her father, Walter Clyde Brown, was an autoworker at a Chrysler plant in Indianapolis for 41 years. Along with older brother George and younger brother Aaron, Brown was raised in a deeply spiritual Baptist household. Her grandfather was a Baptist minister in the city and Brown started singing at his church when she was 5 years old. Brown credits her musical experiences at church as instilling in her a love for singing.

As a teenager, Brown started performing in soul music bands around Indianapolis and was highly active in the vocal music program at Crispus Attucks High School. Her high school choir director, Robert Fleck, taught Brown her first classical arias and entered her in several local music competitions, all of which Brown won. Brown also participated in her high school&#x27;s musicals, playing Adelaide in &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; among other roles.

After high school, Brown attended a community college in Indianapolis part-time while working a day job as a dietary aide at Methodist Hospital. She also acted in several musicals at the pro-am Civic Theater where she got to work with several notable performers including Ginger Rogers. Brown also worked as a singing waitress for a time.

The death of her younger brother led Brown, then 20, to re-examine her faith and join the Seventh-day Adventist Church with intent to become a singing evangelist. To that end, in the fall of 1986, at the age of 21, Brown enrolled at Oakwood College planning to major in biblical studies with a minor in music. Brown subsequently changed her major to music, however, after her voice teacher, Ginger Beazley, convinced her to pursue opera singing instead. Brown received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in the Spring of 1991.

From 1992 to 1997, Brown continued her studies at the Jacobs School of Music at Indiana University with noted voice teacher Virginia Zeani. Brown had worked frequently with Zeani while at Oakwood College, as Ginger Beazley took Brown and her other students up to IU to participate in Zeani&#x27;s master classes.

While in graduate school, Brown began competing in several notable music competitions. In 1994 Brown tried out for the National Council Auditions of New York&#x27;s Metropolitan Opera. She made it as far as the regional finals but proceeded no further. She tried out two more years in a row, only to be stopped twice more at the regional level. She tried one last time in 1997. &quot;I had nothing to lose,&quot; she told &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Instead, she won everything - not only the regionals, but the semi-finals and then the finals. The win bought her entry into the world of professional opera.

Brown has since gone on to win the 2000 Richard Tucker Career Grant, a 1998 Sullivan Foundation Grant, the 1998 G.B. Viotti Verdi Vocal Competition, and the 1998 Opera Carolina Competition.

==Career==
In 1997, Brown moved to New York City and began performing in a steady stream of small roles with larger opera companies and larger roles with smaller opera companies over the next several years. She also appeared in concerts with good regional orchestras and gave many recitals.

In the 2000–2001 season, Brown performed with the San Antonio Symphony, Teatro La Fenice, as Serena in &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; with Opera Company of Philadelphia, and gave several recitals. She also began working for the Metropolitan Opera as a cover artist for the title roles of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aida&quot; and Strauss&#x27; &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot;. This was followed by cover work for the company for the next three seasons.

In the 2001–2002 season, Brown appeared as the Fourth Maid in Cincinnati Opera&#x27;s production of Strauss&#x27; &quot;Elektra&quot;.

In the 2002–2003 season, Brown performed at the Kimmel Center with the Philadelphia Orchestra for the September 11 Memorial Concert, return trips to the Metropolitan Opera to cover the roles of Aida and Ariadne, covering Leonora in &quot;Il Trovatore&quot; for San Francisco Opera, performances of Richard Strauss’ &quot;Four Last Songs&quot; with the El Paso Symphony and Muncie Symphony Orchestras, and Beethoven’s &quot;Ninth Symphony&quot; with Roanoke Symphony Orchestra.

In the 2003-2004 season, Brown performed the roles of Elisabetta in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Don Carlo&quot; and Leonora in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Il Trovatore&quot; for the Opera Company of Philadelphia, the title role in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aida&quot; for Shaker Mountain Opera, and the role of Cassandra in Taneyev&#x27;s &quot;Agamemnon&quot; with the Manhattan Philharmonic and the Aquila Theater Company which toured Poland and was performed at her Carnegie Hall debut . She also performed a concert of Strauss and Wagner arias with the Auckland Philharmonia, was a soloist in Verdi&#x27;s Requiem with the Louisville Orchestra, and a soloist with the Gibraltar Philharmonic. In addition, Brown made an unexpected appearance with the Opera Company of Philadelphia when she filled in at the last minute in the title role of Strauss&#x27; &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot;. Brown also filled in for an ailing singer for an orchestra rehearsal of &quot;Aida&quot; at the Metropolitan Opera. The company was so impressed with her work that they immediately called Brown&#x27;s agent and booked her for two performances of &quot;Aida&quot; and 12 cover performances for the next season.

In the 2004-2005 season, Brown made her critically acclaimed debut at the Metropolitan Opera in the title role of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aida&quot;. Her performance was so well received that an article about her appeared on the front page of &quot;The New York Times&quot; on November 8, 2004. Originally she was not scheduled that night to sing, as she had already sung two performances in the scheduled run of Aida and covering the role for the remainder of the run, but she was called to replace the ailing lead that night. Opera News called her performance that of &quot;one of America’s most promising Verdi sopranos&quot;. In addition, Brown sang the role of Aida for Opera Company of Philadelphia and followed that with the world premiere of Margaret Garner, a new opera by Richard Danielpour and Toni Morrison, in the role of Cilla for Michigan Opera Theatre and Cincinnati Opera. She also appeared as a guest soloist in a concert of opera arias for Auckland Philharmonia (New Zealand) and Dayton Opera.

In the 2005–2006 season, Brown performed the role of Amelia in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Un Ballo in Maschera&quot; and the role of Cilla in &quot;Margaret Garner&quot; for the Detroit Opera and Opera Company of Philadelphia, the title role in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aida&quot; for Opera Pacific and Florentine Opera, Verdi&#x27;s Requiem&quot; for the Festival of Saint Denis in France, concerts with the Indianapolis Symphony and Brevard Festival Orchestra, and recitals throughout the United States.

In the 2006–2007 season, Brown made her debut with Opéra National de Paris as Amelia in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Un Ballo in Maschera&quot;, sang the title role of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aida&quot; with Florida Grand Opera for the opening the new Carnival Performing Arts Center, and sang the role of Bess in Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; for both Opera Pacific to open the new Orange County Performing Arts Center and the Opera Company of Philadelphia to mark the 150th Anniversary of the Academy of Music.

In the 2007–2008 season, Brown sang the title role of &quot;Aida&quot; and the role of Amelia in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Un Ballo in Maschera&quot; at the Metropolitan Opera. She was also chosen by The Library of Congress as the featured soloist for the 2008-2009 National Celebration of the Bicentennial of Abraham Lincoln in February. In addition, Brown sang in concert at Dayton Opera, performed with the Indianapolis Symphony, sang &quot;Aida&quot; with Opera de la ABAO, the title role in Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Tosca&quot; with Florida Grand Opera, and gave her first appearance in the role of Leonora in a concert version of &quot;La Forza del Destino&quot; with James Conlon for the Cincinnati May Festival. This summer Brown will perform Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot; with the National Symphony of Spain in Madrid, give a concert of sacred repertoire at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral in Auckland, New Zealand, and will be the featured performer at the NAACP&#x27;s national conference in July 2008.

In the 2008–2009 season, Brown sang Aida for Cape Town Opera in South Africa and for the Latvian National Symphony in Riga. She celebrated Christmas with the Alabama Symphony Orchestra in Alabama and the Southwest Michigan Symphony. In addition, she sang Aida at her debut with the Deutsche Oper Berlin, Leonora in &quot;Il Trovatore&quot; for her debut with Atlanta Opera, Amelia in &quot;Un Ballo in Maschera&quot; for National Opera of Paris, and Elisabetta in &quot;Don Carlo&quot; for Cincinnati Opera, and performed Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot; in Barcelona.

Brown has also performed roles with the Indianapolis Opera.

She has performed in concert with the San Antonio Symphony, Tulsa Philharmonic, Indianapolis Symphony, Cincinnati Pops, Brevard Festival Orchestra, Knoxville Symphony, Long Island Philharmonic, Asheville Lyric Opera&#x27;s 10th Anniversary GalaHendersonville Symphony, Chautauqua Institution, the Kennedy Center&#x27;s 25th Anniversary Celebration, Chicago Sinfonietta, The Joy of Music Television Series and tours throughout United States, Canada, New Zealand, Italy, and Africa.

She has given recitals in such places as Alice Tully Hall and Carnegie Hall.

==Educator and humanitarian==
Angela M. Brown has been a spokesperson for the United Negro College Fund and uses her voice to bring awareness of opera to minority audiences, communities and diverse young audiences.

<text>The collared trogon (Trogon collaris) is a near passerine bird in family Trogonidae, the quetzals and trogons. It is found in Mexico, throughout Central America, and in northern South America.

==Taxonomy and systematics==

The International Ornithological Committee (IOC) and the Clements taxonomy recognize these 10 subspecies of collared trogon. They treated &quot;T. c. aurantiiventris&quot; (&quot;orange-bellied trogon&quot;) as a separate species until the late 2010s.

*&quot;T. c. puella&quot; 
*&quot;T. c. underwoodi&quot; 
*&quot;T. c. aurantiiventris&quot; 
*&quot;T. c. extimus&quot; 
*&quot;T. c. heothinus&quot; 
*&quot;T. c. virginalis&quot; 
*&quot;T. c. subtropicalis&quot; 
*&quot;T. c. exoptatus&quot; 
*&quot;T. c. collaris&quot; 
*&quot;T. c. castaneus&quot; 

BirdLife International&#x27;s &quot;Handbook of the Birds of the World&quot; (HBW) recognizes eight subspecies, excluding &quot;T. c. aurantiiventris&quot; and &quot;T. c. underwoodi&quot;.

==Description==

Trogons have distinctive male and female plumages, with soft, often colorful, feathers. The collared trogon is about long and weigh about . Both sexes have a black face and throat. The male&#x27;s crown, nape, back, and rump are bright metallic green. The folded wing shows black and white vermiculation. The breast is also metallic green with a white band separating it from the bright red belly and vent. The upperside of the tail is green with a black tip and the underside is barred black and white. The female is olive brown where the male is green, the closed wing is brown with black vermiculation, and the belly is a duller red than the male&#x27;s. The underside of the tail is gray with a few black bars and white tips.

==Distribution and habitat==

The 10 subspecies of collared trogon are found thus:

*&quot;T. c. puella&quot;, central Mexico to western Panama
*&quot;T. c. underwoodi&quot;, northwestern Costa Rica
*&quot;T. c. aurantiiventris&quot;, central Costa Rica to western Panama
*&quot;T. c. extimus&quot;, eastern Darién Province in northeastern Panama
*&quot;T. c. heothinus&quot;, Panama&#x27;s Serranía del Darién
*&quot;T. c. virginalis&quot;, western Colombia through western Ecuador into northwestern Peru
*&quot;T. c. subtropicalis&quot;, central Colombia, especially the Magdalena and Cauca valleys
*&quot;T. c. exoptatus&quot;, northern Venezuela (and Trinidad &amp; Tobago?)
*&quot;T. c. collaris&quot;, east of the Andes from Colombia south to northern Bolivia and east through the Guianas and much of west central Brazil (and Trinidad &amp; Tobago?)
*&quot;T. c. castaneus&quot;, southeastern Colombia south to eastern Peru and northern Bolivia and into northwestern Brazil; also eastern Brazil

Clements places &quot;T. c. exoptatus&quot; in Trinidad &amp; Tobago; the IOC places &quot;T. c. collaris&quot; there instead.

In South America the collared trogon inhabits humid lowland evergreen forest, both primary and well-established secondary. In Mexico and Central America it inhabits those forest types and in addition humid montane, semideciduous, and pine-evergreen forests. It is found as high as in Mexico and in Costa Rica, but in the Andes it is mostly below in Ecuador and in Peru.

==Behavior==
The collared trogon usually perches between the higher understory and the lower part of the canopy. It is usually seen singly or in pairs, but small groups may gather outside the breeding season.

===Feeding===

The collared trogon eats small fruits (such as berries) and invertebrates such as caterpillars, crickets, cicadas, beetles, and phasmids. They often accompany the edges of mixed-species foraging flocks but do not mix with the other members.

===Breeding===

The collared trogon&#x27;s nesting season is highly variable across the species&#x27; wide distribution, beginning as early as November in French Guiana and as late as April in Venezuela. It nests in cavities in decaying wood or arboreal termite nests; the cavity is often so shallow that much of the bird is visible. The normal clutch size is two eggs. Both sexes incubate the eggs and care for the young.

===Vocalization===

The collared trogon&#x27;s song varies geographically. The Mexican and Central American populations sing &quot;a plaintive 2-3 noted &quot;kyow&#x27;-kyow or caow&#x27; caow&quot;, and a faster &quot;kyow kyow-kyow&quot;&quot;. South American songs are described as &quot;a series of mellow whistled notes, usually with a stuttered introductory note: &quot;whi&#x27;whi whew-whew-whew&quot;.&quot; Calls include &quot;a prolonged &quot;charr&quot;&quot; and a &quot;snorting &quot;chur-r-r-r&quot;&quot;.

==Status==

The IUCN has assessed the collared trogon as being of Least Concern. It has a very large, though not quantified, population and a very large range.

In 1946, the University of Illinois opened extension centers in several Illinois towns to help meet the educational needs of World War II veterans. In Danville, the center was housed at Danville High School under the direction of Principal R. M. Duffin. The centers were closed in the spring of 1949, and Danville School District 118 decided to continue teaching college classes using the name Danville Community College. Mary Miller, who had headed the DHS English department, led the new college. At that time the tuition rate was $5.00 per credit hour, with a $5.00 student and library fee. In 1951, the name was changed to Danville Junior College.

In 1965, the college moved to buildings provided by the US government which had been part of the Veterans Administration on the southeast side of town; this provided the present-day campus. Local citizens raised money for the renovation of the buildings.

In June 1966, the college separated from District 118 under the provisions of the Public Junior College Act and became an independent two-year area college under the control of the Board of Trustees of Junior College District No. 507. The name Danville Junior College was changed to Danville Area Community College on July 1, 1979.

Since the campus opened in 1965, several new buildings have been added, including the Mary Miller Center (named for the college&#x27;s first president and housing the gymnasium and the Sciences division), the Ornamental Horticulture building, the Technology Center, the Child Development Center, and Lincoln Hall. In addition, several of the existing buildings, dating from the late 1890s, have been renovated, including the Clock Tower Center, Vermilion Hall, Cannon Hall and Prairie Hall. The Bremer Center was expanded in 2007, and the Mary Miller Complex was expanded in 2012.

In 2002, DACC opened the Downtown Center in the heart of downtown Danville in order to facilitate the growing demand for career-preparatory classes. In 2006 the Downtown Center moved to the Job Training Partnership facility at 407 North Franklin Street.

DACC has hosted the NJCAA Men&#x27;s Division II Basketball Championship since 1994. This takes place in the Mary Miller Center Gymnasium.

In September 2024, DACC President Stephen Nacco was suspended by the Board of Trustees, pending possible firing. In October 2024, Nacco resigned, effective December 2024. Nacco later announced he was running to be on the Board of Trustees that previously voted to fire him, but he was disqualified from running due to many issues with invalid signatures and non-existent voters.

<doc id="1167629" wikidata="Q743470" url="?curid=1167629" title="Suzuki Aerio">
<text>The Suzuki Aerio (also called the Liana – &quot;Life In A New Age&quot; – in China, Pakistan, Europe, Israel, South Asia, Taiwan and Australia or Baleno for sedan version in Indonesia) is a subcompact car that was built by Suzuki. It was introduced in 2001 as a replacement for the Suzuki Esteem/Baleno, with a tall 5-door SX model hatchback (for maximum inner room efficiency) and a 4-door sedan body. It featured two different 16-valve gasoline inline-four engines, with 1.5-litre and 1.8-litre, this one capable of JIS. Production was discontinued in 2007 around the world and replaced by the Suzuki SX4, except in Pakistan (2006 to 2014) and China where production was continued by Changhe-Suzuki until 2019.

==Overview==
Models in North America got a larger and more powerful 2.0-litre engine with . A 5-speed manual transmission was standard with a 4-speed automatic optional. All-wheel-drive was available, but only with the automatic. American Aerios came in two trim levels: the S and GS (2002–2004), S and SX (2005), and Base and Premium (2006–2007). Key changes over the years included an upgrade to a new 2.3-liter engine in 2004, a major styling and interior refresh in 2005 (replacing the digital instruments with conventional analog ones), and the standardization of antilock brakes in 2006. Only the Aerio sedan remained for 2007, as the hatchback had been shelved to make room for the new 2007 SX4 hatchback. Likewise, the Aerio sedan bowed out at year&#x27;s end, making way for the 2008 SX4 Sport sedan. Throughout its run, the Aerio was distinct for being the most affordable car in America to offer all-wheel drive.

In Europe, where the car was called Liana (an acronym for &quot;Life In A New Age&quot;), it was seen as a more affordable alternative to small family cars or to mini MPVs, introducing a new generation of Suzuki M engines, with 1.3-litre and 1.6-litre I4 engine. All-wheel drive was available on the bigger engine. In 2004, the car was restyled with a look that closer resembled the Japanese version, and also received a Diesel engine, with a 16-valve version of the 1.4-litre HDi engine supplied by PSA Peugeot Citroën, capable of thanks to common rail direct injection and a variable geometry turbocharger.

The Liana remained in production in Pakistan in 1.3-litre and 1.6-litre variants until 2014.

==Appearances in media==

The Liana was best known for its appearances as the Reasonably Priced Car in &quot;Top Gear&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Star in a Reasonably-Priced Car&quot; segment. Celebrity guests would appear on the show every week to be interviewed and to set a lap time in a saloon model Suzuki Liana. The primary car, along with spare cars, were kept stock except for a roll cage and racing seats which were added as safety measures. In its three-year tenure on Top Gear, the Liana covered 1,600 laps of the circuit; its tires and brakes were changed 100 times; and it required six new clutches, two new hubs, driveshafts, wishbones, struts and gear linkages and a replacement wing mirror. The Liana was used from its first show until its replacement by a Chevrolet Lacetti in the show&#x27;s spring 2006 season. Until 2015, it enjoyed a partial retirement, and was still brought back when the guest was a Formula 1 driver.

==Pikes Peak==
In 2001, Suzuki specially built spaceframe racing cars for hillclimb races with a bodyshell to resemble the Aerio dubbed the &quot;Suzuki Aerio P950 Pikes Peak Special&quot; driven by its rally team manager and former rally driver, Nobuhiro Tajima.

Tajima retired from the race, one mile (1.6 km) short of the finishing line suffering from mechanical failures, teammate Yutaka Awazuhara took the fourth overall in a Grand Vitara.
Tajima would finish as runner up in the All Japan Dirt Trial Championship that year with the same car and won the Race to the Sky hillclimb in 2003, before it was rebuilt as a Grand Vitara, then in 2007 as an XL7, breaking the overall course record at Pikes Peak.

<doc id="1167632" wikidata="Q1056848" url="?curid=1167632" title="Oakwood University">
<text>Oakwood University is a private, historically black Seventh-day Adventist university in Huntsville, Alabama. It is the only HBCU owned and operated by the Seventh-day Adventist Church.

Oakwood University is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) and the Department of Education of the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists (through the Adventist Accrediting Association) to award associate, baccalaureate, and master&#x27;s degrees.

Oakwood University owns and operates the Christian radio station WJOU 90.1 FM, formerly WOCG.

Oakwood University is the only ISO 9001 certified HBCU in the United States.

In 2014, it became the first HBCU to offer a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC).

In 2018, the U.S. Senate recognized Oakwood University for being the fifth leading producer of African-American applicants to U.S. medical schools. That same year, the university became the first academic institution to receive the 2018 Crystal Apple Award from the Partnership for a Healthier America for its campus wellness initiatives.

==History==
===Early years===
Oakwood University has its origins in the post-Civil and post-slavery effort to fund higher education for African-Americans who had been freed in the South. In response to the counsel of SDA Church co-founder Ellen G. White, a committee was appointed by the General Conference of the Seventh-day Adventist Church to buy property and create a school that offers vocational education and spiritual direction to African-American students. In January 1896, the committee bought a former plantation for $6,700. That same year, Oakwood University was founded as Oakwood Industrial School in Huntsville, Alabama, under the authority of the General Conference.

Named for the oak trees surrounding it and the white SDA Church leaders&#x27; belief that industrial work is fitting for southern African-Americans, students were initially required to work in industrial positions on-campus to pay for their tuition. Their jobs included machine shop and farm work for male students and print shop, laundry and tailor shop work for female students. Classes commenced in November 1896 with 16 students enrolled. Solon Marquis Jacobs served as the school&#x27;s first principal beginning in 1896, and in 1917, James Irving Beardsley was appointed the first president. By that same year, the school offered a theology program as well as a programs for various trades, such as farming, teaching, masonry and pre-nursing. Prior to 1917, the school was renamed Huntsville Training School and Oakwood Manual Training School before it became Oakwood Junior College.

===Social activism===
In 1931, after years of student complaints about school conditions—including &quot;heavy work schedules, low wages, the inability to accumulate academic credit due to the workloads&quot; and racial segregation on campus—students went on strike, petitioning for better conditions, liberal arts programs, more African American faculty members and an African American president. In 1932, after student strikers held a series of pep rallies, speeches and worship gatherings and sent a letter to the General Conference petitioning for change, the General Conference recruited more African Americans to Oakwood&#x27;s faculty, making it predominantly African American. Additionally, the General Conference first invited two of Oakwood&#x27;s white professors to become president in response to the strikes and petitions. It was only after the professors rejected the invitation that was it extended to James L. Moran, Oakwood&#x27;s first African American president. Although Moran became president, the General Conference asserted that a white man would manage the school&#x27;s business affairs and serve as the liaison between the school board and the General Conference, two roles typically held by the president of a higher education institution. It was under the leadership of President Moran that Oakwood attained earned four-year college status and was renamed Oakwood College. 

Due to the conservative ideologies of the SDA Church, students&#x27; initial involvement in the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s was restrained. Oakwood&#x27;s non-participation stance, declared by the General Conference, discouraged faculty involvement in the movement. Despite this, after Oakwood hosted guest speaker Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1962—and was the only institution in Huntsville that would host him—some Oakwood students became moderately active in the movement. Because the SDA ideologies discouraged association with those outside of the Church, Oakwood students were disconnected from those at neighboring schools. Also, their access to news outlets such as radio and television was restricted and completely banned in dormitories, limiting their awareness of ongoing events related to the civil rights movement.

The Church and the South&#x27;s expectations for women hindered female students&#x27; freedom to choose to participate in civil resistance events, if they desired to do so. However, students were able to stay informed of protests through local black-owned radio station WEUP, and male students had more freedom in choosing whether to participate in sit-ins, prayer-ins and marches, store boycotts and other nonviolent acts of resistance. Their efforts to integrate local white SDA churches were met with hostility by segregationists. For example, white church officials called the police to remove black students from the church grounds and altered their worship service times to coincide with students&#x27; class times, preventing them from being able to attend. In spite of the SDA Church&#x27;s efforts against students&#x27; activism, a few male Oakwood students formed activist coalitions with Alabama A&amp;M University students or formed their own small activist groups which attempted to obtain service at establishments throughout Huntsville that would only serve white patrons.

===Accreditation and growth===
Oakwood began with an initial enrollment of 16 students in 1896, and increased to more than 100 by 1917 and 200 in 1927.

It was initially accredited as a junior college in 1943, and the school&#x27;s first baccalaureate degrees were awarded in 1945.

Between 1958 and 1963, Oakwood made progress toward full senior college accreditation by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, and joined the United Negro College Fund in 1964.

Oakwood&#x27;s enrollment reached over 1,000 in 1974, and from 1973 to 1982, the number of graduates increased from 124 to 200.

By 2003, Oakwood offered liberal arts and professional degrees, and had an enrollment of approximately 1,700 with representation from 38 countries.

In 2008, Oakwood College was renamed Oakwood University and was approved to offer a graduate program in religion. That same year, enrollment increased to 1,865 with representation from 42 U.S. states and 30 countries. By fall 2012, enrollment reached 2,019.

In 2014, Oakwood was approved to transfer from sponsorship under the General Conference to sponsorship under the North American Division.

In 2016, Oakwood achieved full accreditation by the Adventist Accrediting Association.

==Academics==
Oakwood University offers undergraduate and graduate degrees through the following schools:

*School of Arts &amp; Sciences
*School of Business &amp; Information Systems
*School of Education &amp; Social Sciences
*School of Nursing &amp; Health Professions
*School of Theology

In 2004, Oakwood entered into a subcontractor agreement with Science Applications International Corp. (SAIC) through the Unified NASA Information Technology Services (UNITeS) program. By partnering to offer wireless technology support at Oakwood, ISO 9002 certification audit compliance, network engineering training, Federal contract training and human resources laboratory development, Oakwood and SAIC have been able to provide Oakwood students and graduates with STEM and business internships and part- and full-time work, generating ongoing business for the Oakwood community while supporting the space industry.

In 2009, Oakwood was the first HBCU to enter NASA&#x27;s Mentor-Protégé signing agreement with SAIC. Through the three-year agreement, SAIC continued to provide Oakwood with technology enhancement, contract management and business administration support and would also begin offering technical and engineering internships to students. By 2015, Oakwood had entered into similar contracts with Boeing, Leidos and Honeywell, among others.

==Student activities==
There are over 30 clubs and organizations on campus.

===Musical groups===
The Aeolians, Oakwood University&#x27;s premier touring ensemble, was founded in 1946 by former professor, Dr. Eva B. Dykes. This choir has 45–60 members from various disciplines, and the group travels nationally and internationally as musical ambassadors for the university. The choir has visited Romania, Great Britain, Poland, Jamaica, and Bermuda among other locations. The group has also performed at the White House for President Bill Clinton and at the Kennedy Center, both in Washington, D.C. Other musical ensembles on campus include gospel choirs Dynamic Praise, Voices of Triumph, the group Serenity winners of the First Season of &quot;Making The Group&quot; reality show competition. Oakwood University is known for its legacy of great music. In 2010, an Oakwood-based vocal group, Committed, won the a capella TV competition The Sing-off. In 2017, the choir was named Choir of the World at the National Eisteddfod of Wales Music Festival. The group is featured in Jacob Collier&#x27;s 2019 recording and video of Lionel Richie&#x27;s song All Night Long (All Night).

===Academic competitions===
At the 2008 Honda Campus All-Star Challenge National Championship Tournament in Orlando, Florida, Oakwood University team members brought home the trophy. This competition featured 64 teams from historically black colleges and universities around the nation. In addition to winning the championship, Oakwood University received a grant of $50,000 from the American Honda Motor Company. Both the quiz bowl and basketball teams adjusted their playing schedules to not play on Saturday, the day observed as the Sabbath (Oakwood University is a Seventh-day Adventist institution), and both teams still emerged as champions over Alcorn State University. At the 2009 Honda Campus All-Star Challenge National Championship Tournament, the team, led by captain Alesis Turner, returned to again be named the champions (the team played in the final rounds against North Carolina Central University). In 2017, Oakwood for the third time won the HCASC Tournament, defeating Bowie State University in the finals without losing a game the entire tournament. 2017 marked the 28th season of the tournament. The school joins Tuskegee University, Florida A&amp;M University, and Morehouse College, as the only schools to win back-to-back championships at HCASC.

== Athletics ==
The Oakwood athletic teams are called the Ambassadors and Lady Ambassadors. The university is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the HBCU Athletic Conference (HBCUAC), formerly the Gulf Coast Athletic Conference (GCAC), since the 2022–23 academic year. The Ambassadors and Lady Ambassadors previously competed as a member of the United States Collegiate Athletic Association (USCAA) until after the 2021–22 school year.

Oakwood competes in five intercollegiate varsity sports: men&#x27;s teams include baseball, basketball and soccer; while women&#x27;s teams include basketball, soccer, softball and volleyball. 

=== Intramurals ===
The university also offers several intramural sport activities.

=== Move to the NAIA ===
On January 20, 2022, Oakwood got an invitation to join the GCAC, along with Wiley College and the return of Southern University at New Orleans, effective beginning in July 2022. The GCAC is an athletic conference affiliated with the NAIA.

=== Men&#x27;s basketball ===
The Ambassadors men&#x27;s basketball team won the 2008 USCAA National Championship in the team&#x27;s first season a member of the association. The Ambassadors won their second USCAA Division I National Championship in March 2012 against Rochester College, and their third in March 2016. The university became the first college or university in Alabama to win three men&#x27;s basketball championships when the Ambassadors defeated Concordia College to win the 2016 USCAA Division I National Championship. The Ambassadors men&#x27;s basketball team won the university&#x27;s fourth title in 2019 with a 58–57 win against Bluefield State.

<text>Samurai Shodown IV: Amakusa&#x27;s Revenge is the fourth in SNK&#x27;s flagship &quot;Samurai Shodown&quot; series of fighting games. Chronologically, it is the second and final chapter of a story between &quot;Samurai Shodown&quot; and &quot;Samurai Shodown II&quot;, with &quot;Samurai Shodown III&quot; being the first chapter. &quot;Samurai Shodown!&quot; on the Neo Geo Pocket is a monochrome adaptation of this game, and it was followed by &quot;Samurai Shodown! 2&quot; on the Neo Geo Pocket Color, which is a 2D adaptation of &quot;Samurai Shodown 64: Warriors Rage&quot;.

==Gameplay==

The ability to select from &quot;Slash&quot; and &quot;Bust&quot; versions of characters is retained from &quot;Samurai Shodown III&quot;.

Among other series changes, aerial blocking was removed entirely. One can also no longer charge one&#x27;s own &quot;pow&quot; gauge. The off-screen delivery man was omitted entirely from the game. The &quot;CD combo&quot; was added, wherein a player can press the C and D buttons together, triggering a strike that can be followed up by a sequence of button taps.

SNK also added a &quot;suicide&quot; move, wherein one&#x27;s character forfeits the round. The bonus to this is that the one committing suicide will start the next round with a full &quot;POW&quot; gauge. Certain finishes also enable a &quot;fatality&quot; move in the vein of &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;.

==Characters==
All twelve playable characters from &quot;Samurai Shodown III&quot; return, though some have been retouched to further enhance the cartoonish look. Three additional characters from previous games, Charlotte, Tam Tam and Jubei Yagyu, are also included.

Joining the cast are the two ninja brothers:

*Kazuki Kazama - member of the Kazama ninja clan specializing in fire jutsu, he deserts to rescue his younger sister, Hazuki, from Amakusa&#x27;s clutches.
*Sogetsu Kazama - older brother to Kazuki and Hazuki who uses water jutsu; unlike Kazuki, he stays with the clan and is ordered to assassinate his brother for leaving.

Cham Cham from &quot;Samurai Shodown II&quot; also makes a playable appearance, exclusively for the PlayStation port of the game known in Japan as Samurai Spirits: Amakusa&#x27;s Descent Special.

==Reception==
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Samurai Shodown IV&quot; on their December 1, 1996 issue as being the most-popular arcade game at the time. According to &quot;Famitsu&quot;, the AES version sold over 9,253 copies in its first week on the market.

Reviewing the arcade version in &quot;GamePro&quot;, The Union Buster commented that &quot;Samurai Shodown IV&quot; lacks the depth of contemporaries such as &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 2&quot; and &quot;Soul Edge&quot;, but for the same reason offers an easier pick-up-and-play experience. He was unimpressed with the two new characters but pleased with the return of those which had been dropped from the roster in &quot;Samurai Shodown III&quot;. He particularly praised the visuals, remarking that &quot;The fighters have superb animation; several fighting stages are outright beautiful; and the special moves look awesome.&quot;

The four reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; gave the Neo Geo home version a unanimous score of 8 out of 10, praising the high number of characters and the size of the character sprites.

In a review of the Virtual Console release, &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; also gave the game an 8 out of 10, but their praise focused more on the animations, heavy challenge, and the thrilling pacing of battles, commenting, &quot;a single slash [is] capable of turning the tide against any opponent.&quot;

<text>Lee Gunther (May 30, 1935 – August 25, 1998) was a co-founder of Marvel Productions and a film editor (which, in animation parlance, means sound effects editor) on more than 85 animated shorts in all.

== Career ==
Starting at Warner Bros. in the 1960s, and then at DePatie–Freleng Enterprises, he also worked as a production manager in the 1970s. After DePatie–Freleng was sold to Marvel Comics Group in 1981, Gunther became one of the founders of Marvel Productions Ltd., where he served as executive vice president and executive producer on television series such as &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, &quot;G.I. Joe&quot; and &quot;The Transformers&quot;, as well as the feature-length animation &quot;&quot;. He also served as vice president of foreign production at Fox Kids.

In late 1987, he co-founded Gunther-Wahl Productions with Michael Wahl. Their first task was taking over production of &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks&quot; from Ruby-Spears Productions in 1988, including the &quot;Go To the Movies&quot; series. He then served as executive producer of the animated series &quot;The Angry Beavers&quot; for Nickelodeon from 1997 to 2001 and &quot;Wild West C.O.W.-Boys of Moo Mesa&quot; for Greengrass Productions on ABC in 1992. He and Wahl also created &quot;The Adventures of T-Rex&quot; in 1992-1993, shortly after the Mattel Flutter Faeries lawsuit in which his partner Wahl and his wife were involved.

Other productions by Gunther-Wahl included the animated adaptation of &quot;Karate Kid&quot; for Coca-Cola Telecommunications (now Sony Pictures Television) on NBC in 1989, and also the short-lived &quot;G.I. Joe&quot; animated series from 1990 to 1992 (the preceding &quot;Operation Dragonfire&quot; five-part mini-series was produced by DIC Entertainment), as well as &quot;G.I. Joe Extreme&quot; (with Sunbow Entertainment and Graz Entertainment from 1995 to 1997), and the cartoon &quot;Red Planet&quot; in 1994.

In his lifetime, Gunther earned four Emmy awards, two Humanitas Prizes, two Golden Reel Awards and 12 Clio awards.

== Death ==
Gunther died of a stroke on August 25, 1998, at age 63. Long-time friend and colleague George Conte, who worked for Murakami-Wolf-Swenson and Fred Wolf Films, and who first met Gunther at DePatie–Freleng, said, &quot;Lee&#x27;s dedication to quality filmmaking, both technically and creatively placed him at the top of his profession. Because of his strong character and gentle ways, he was respected and loved by all who knew him. He will be missed.&quot;

<text>Barcelona Sporting Club (), internationally known as Barcelona de Guayaquil, is an Ecuadorian sports club based in Guayaquil, known best for its professional football team. They currently play in the Ecuadorian Serie A, the highest level of football in the country, and hold the distinction of being the only club in the Ecuadorian top flight to not have played in the Serie B.

Barcelona Sporting Club is one of the most successful football teams in Ecuador, having won the Serie A title a record 16 times, most recently in 2020. They have also won six regional titles (five in the professional era), and were the first Ecuadorian club to make it to the Copa Libertadores finals, making it twice, but lost on both occasions.

Barcelona Sporting Club was founded on 1 May 1925, by Eutimio Pérez, a Spanish immigrant who named the club after his home city of Barcelona. Since then, Barcelona Sporting Club has become the most popular club in the country. The club holds a long-standing rivalry with Emelec, where matches between the two teams are considered the most important derby in Ecuador, commonly referred to as &quot;El Clásico del Astillero&quot;. The club plays their home matches in Estadio Monumental Banco Pichincha, the largest stadium in the country.

In addition to football, the club has teams in professional basketball, bowling, boxing, swimming, volleyball, baseball, athletics, and tennis. In 2008, its basketball team was the champion in the Ecuadorian National Basketball League.

==History==
===Foundation and early years (1925–1969)===
&quot;Barcelona Sporting Club&quot; was founded on 1 May 1925 by Eutimio Pérez, a Spanish immigrant who decided to name the club after his home city of Barcelona, Spain. The team was named after Pérez&#x27;s return to Ecuador, and BSC&#x27;s Barça-like crest was adopted later on. The team competed in the provincial amateur tournament organized by Asociación de Fútbol del Guayas (AFG), which included clubs from around the Guayas Province in Ecuador. In the 1940s, Barcelona&#x27;s popularity grew partly by its notoriety in playing matches against important Colombian teams, such as Deportivo Cali and Millionarios, two of the best teams from Colombia&#x27;s golden era of football. Barcelona defeated Millionarios twice in Guayaquil, by scores of 3–2 and 1–0.

Barcelona was formed in the same place where the club which would become its most intense sporting rival was founded, Club Sport Emelec. Both clubs were born in the same Guayaquil neighborhood, Astillero de Guayaquil.

In 1950, Barcelona Sporting Club won its first AFG amateur title; the following year, the Association turned professional, and between 1951 and 1967, Barcelona racked up five professional regional titles and finished as runners-up six times, tying crosstown rival Emelec for the most titles. In 1957, as one of the top two finishers in the Guayas regional tournament, Barcelona was invited to participate in the newly organized Serie A de Ecuador, which would crown a national championship from among the top two teams from both the AFG and the Interandino tournament disputed by teams from Quito and Ambato. Barcelona of Guayaquil finished second in their first participation. Barcelona won its first national title in 1960, and became the first Ecuadorian team to compete in the Copa Libertadores.

*First match: 15 June 1925 vs Ayacucho (1–0)
*First international match: 19 March 1931 vs Deportivo Cali (4–4)

===Success, then fall from grace (1970s)===

By the 1970s, Barcelona had established themselves as one of Ecuador&#x27;s more popular teams after winning a number of provincial and national championships. Despite their national success, their performance in the Copa Libertadores had been lackluster, having exited the tournament early in competition. That changed in 1971, when they reached the semi-finals of the tournament with a star-studded squad that featured players such as Brazilian international Jose Paes, Peruvian World Cup player Pedro Pablo León, and Ecuadorian legend Alberto Spencer. Although they failed to reach the finals, at that time Estudiantes de La Plata was undefeated 4 years in row in home matches in Copa Libertadores, they managed to defeat three-time tournament winner Estudiantes de La Plata 1–0 in La Plata, later it would be recognized as &quot;La Hazaña de la Plata&quot;. In 1972, they reached the semi-finals again, establishing themselves in the international stage.

The first two years of the decade were in stark contrast to the remainder; after the 1972 season, the club entered a dry spell that would last nine years. Barcelona did not win a national title, nor did it qualify for the Copa Libertadores, until the 1980s.

===Resurgence (1980s)===
In the 1980s, Barcelona shed the shackles of the prior decade and resurged on the international and domestic fronts. In 1980, the team won their first national title since 1971, going on to win four more before the end of the decade, making the 1980s the team&#x27;s most successful period in terms of national titles; Barcelona became the first Ecuadorian squad to win 10 national championships. During this period, Barcelona competed in six editions of the Copa Libertadores, reaching the semi-finals twice in 1986 and 1987. In 1988, the club hosted a historic meeting against FC Barcelona from Spain, homonym to the Ecuadorian club, during the Guayaquil City Cup friendly; the Ecuadorian Barcelona emerged victoriously 2–1.

In 1987, Barcelona inaugurated a new home ground, the Estadio Monumental. With an opening capacity of almost 90,000 spectators, the &quot;Monumental&quot; is still the largest stadium in Ecuador, and was the second-largest in South America, after the Estádio do Maracanã in Rio de Janeiro. The capacity has been reduced to just under 60,000 due to safety concerns like most South American stadiums.

===The glory years (1990s)===
In 1990, under a new president, and with the firm intention of conquering the Copa Libertadores for the first time (and the first time for a team in Ecuador), the club acquired key international players: former Argentine international and World Cup champion in 1986 Marcelo Trobbiani, Argentine international Alberto Acosta, and Uruguayan Marcelo Saralegui. With the inclusion of the foreign players and a batch of young as well as experienced Ecuadorian players, they played a fantastic tournament.

In 1990 Copa Libertadores edition, a dramatic semi-final home and away series, Barcelona beat River Plate of Argentina in a penalty shoot-out, to finally reach the long-awaited final. Unfortunately they would come short, losing against Olimpia of (Paraguay) 2–0 in the away game, and tying 1–1 in the home game. Many considered the referee had affected the outcome in favor of the Paraguayan team.

In 1992, they put together another great team, beating the previous champions Colo-Colo (Chile) and reaching the Libertadores Cup semi-finals once again, but losing against the powerful Brazilian team of São Paulo, who at the time was coached by Tele Santana. Among their stars, São Paulo had players such as Zetti, Cafu, Raí, Müller and Palhinha.

This decade also proved to show a negative side in the team&#x27;s history. On 26 December 1993, three days after Barcelona had achieved the second place in the Ecuadorian league and earning a spot in the next Libertadores cup, Ecuadorian striker Carlos Muñoz died in a car accident at the age of 26.

After winning the Ecuadorian league title in 1997 (their last until 2012) with the help of such players as former Bolivian international Marco &quot;El Diablo&quot; Etcheverry, former Colombian international Anthony &quot;El Pipa&quot; De Avila and former Ecuadorian international Agustin &quot;Tin&quot; Delgado, they would go on to play the 1998 Libertadores Cup with mostly old players that seemed to be on their way out. But against all odds, they would reach their second Libertadores Cup final, losing both championship games against Brazilian team Vasco Da Gama, 2–0 in the away game and 2–1 in the home game. 

1998 was their last appearance in the Copa Libertadores final as of 2022, ultimately meaning that their intention of capturing the Copa Libertadores that they wanted since the turn of the decade turned out to be a missed opportunity and was disappointing to many fans as they expected to win at least one continental title. The glory of being the first Ecuadorian team instead went to bitter rivals L.D.U. Quito who won the 2008 Copa Libertadores and leaving Barcelona further stings of what could have been.

===Title drought (1998–2012)===

Barcelona did not win a national title for 15 years since 1997, and participated in only two editions of the Copa Libertadores in the 2000s (decade). Despite the lack of titles in recent years, the club remains among the most successful teams in the league, having managed three Serie A runners-up finishes in the decade. Barcelona continues to be among the top contributors to the Ecuador national team, and remains one of the most popular teams in Ecuador. The derby with crosstown team Emelec, remains the most popular football rivalry in Ecuador.

===Maruri and Harb Era (2007–2011)===
During November 2007, Eduardo Maruri was elected President of Barcelona for the 2007–11 period. Maruri and Noboa (Barcelona&#x27;s Vice President) introduced the slogan &quot;La Renovación&quot; (The Renovation), thereby promising to bring in key international players as well as the best Ecuadorian players and to clean up the mess that had prevented Barcelona from winning the national title. However, the 2009 season was Barcelona&#x27;s worst season in its history in the Serie A. Such teams as Deportivo Quito, ESPOLI, Deportivo Cuenca and LDU Portoviejo came out and spoke about their concern: if Barcelona were relegated, it would enormously impact those teams&#x27; economic situations, since when they would play at home against Barcelona it would almost guarantee a sell-out. (This was because Barcelona had the most fans of any team in Ecuador.) On 3 October 2009, more than 70,000 fans showed up at the Estadio Monumental Banco del Pichincha to support &quot;El Idolo del Ecuador&quot; so that it would not be relegated to the Serie B. In an intense match, Barcelona defeated LDU Portoviejo 2–0 with goals from José Luis Perlaza (46th minute) and Juan Samudio (90th minute). This allowed Barcelona to remain the only Ecuadorian team that has never played a game in Serie B.

On 5 November 2009, Barcelona&#x27;s President, Eduardo Maruri, announced the hiring of a multimedia communications group from Spain, MediaPro, to help them as a consultant and guide them through the new decade in the aspects of advertisement, finance, and sport. This was done with the hope of bringing Barcelona back to international prominence and giving the fans what they most desired, the elusive 14th domestic title.

However, Eduardo Maruri resigned the presidency of Barcelona during a surprise press conference on 22 December 2010, stating that he was doing so because of &quot;family issues&quot;. Maruri was resigning one year before the scheduled completion of his term. After Maruri resigned, Juan Carlos Estrada was designated as the new President of Barcelona. Estrada also resigned the next day and Alfonso Harb Viteri assumed the presidency. Harb stated that he was going to step down as President and announced that Barcelona&#x27;s presidential elections would be held on 11 June of the following year.

===Noboa Era (2011–2015)===
The businessman Antonio Noboa with his slogan &quot;Primero Barcelona&quot;, defeated his opponent Jose Herrera and was sworn as the new president of Barcelona SC on 11 June 2011. During the Noboa era, Barcelona managed to win the 2012 Serie A, ending a 14-year without a title. 

===Cevallos Era (2015–)===
Former goalkeeper José Francisco Cevallos assume the presidency of Barcelona on 13 December 2015 against Universidad Católica in Barcelona&#x27;s home stadium, &quot;El Monumental&quot;. His term ended in 2020, but was renewed. In his tenure, Barcelona won the 2016 Ecuadorian Serie A, qualifying them for the 2017 Copa Libertadores, which they reached the semi-finals for the first time since 1998. This run was a great one, qualifying 2nd in their group after River Plate and alongside Independiente Medellín, and Melgar. In the knockouts, they beat Brazilian Sides Palmeiras in the round of 16 and Botafogo in the Quarterfinals, before losing to eventual champion Grêmio in the Semifinals. His term ended with a gleeful 2020 Ecuadorian Serie A Championship, and then was re-elected Club President. The next year, Barcelona reached the semifinals of the 2021 Copa Libertadores. This run saw Barcelona top a very tough group with 7 time winners Boca Juniors, the previous year&#x27;s runner-up Santos, and one of the best Bolivian clubs in The Strongest. In the knockouts, they beat Vélez Sarsfield in the round of 16 and Fluminense in the quarter-finals before falling to finalists Flamengo in the semi-finals. In the 2022 Ecuadorian Serie A, despite winning the first phase, they fell short of the Championship to first time winners Aucas.

==Colours and badge==

The crest of Barcelona has changed over the years. The teams&#x27; first crest consisted of a modified version of the city of Barcelona&#x27;s Coat of Arms in dark blue borders. The team used this crest for two years until 1927. In 1935, the first major change came when they used Barcelona&#x27;s flag in a circle, with a triangle behind it bearing the team&#x27;s initials. In 1955, after the team won their first Guayas Championship, the team adopted their current crest, which is similar to FC Barcelona&#x27;s. Changes they made to it included the number of spikes, the colour of the ball, border colour, and the initials.

===Uniform evolution===
The team&#x27;s traditional colors are yellow and red, with the home kit being all yellow since moorlands era 2015

Prior to that, the teams used to play in black and white kits. For a period early in their history, the team used a kit similar to FC Barcelona&#x27;s, but after a series of losses in that uniform, the team president swore never to wear those colors again. In the 1940s, yellow was introduced, and would eventually become the team&#x27;s primary color, replacing white altogether; red would become the secondary color, used in their alternate kit.
==Stadium==
Barcelona has played in three stadiums. Their first stadium was Estadio George Capwell, with whom they shared with crosstown rival Emelec as it was the only stadium in Guayaquil.

In 1959, they moved to the Guayaquil&#x27;s brand new stadium Estadio Modelo. This was the stadium in which the teams played in during the golden years. For several years Barcelona shared this stadium with Emelec and Patria.

After Estadio Modelo&#x27;s success, the president of Barcelona, Isidro Romero Carbo, initiated the project to give Barcelona their own stadium. Romero talked with Jaime Nebot, Guayaquil&#x27;s mayor, and León Febres Cordero, then President of Ecuador (both of whom are Barcelona fans) about the idea; they decided to help. Nebot donated a huge ground, for construction and Febres Cordero helped him with money. In 1986, Romero put up the first block of the stadium in 1986. In 1987, Estadio Monumental opened for the first time. The stadium was the first in Ecuador to have suites, and became the largest in terms of capacity, with space for close to 90,000 fans.

Recently the team signed a ten-year deal with Latin America Futbol Corporation to install a state of the art LED perimeter board in the Estadio Monumental Banco Pichincha. The 243-meter LED perimeter board was installed in September 2008 and is the first LED perimeter board in an Ecuadorian football stadium. The deal is a 50–50 partnership between the two groups. On 12 July 2015 a Giant LED perimeter board was debuted in the Estadio Monumental Banco Pichincha, the biggest in South America, which is located in the north sector in parish Tarqui of Guayaquil. A aerial lift or cable car currently under construction will connect the stadium with the &quot;Aerovia&quot; Julian Coronel station in downtown Guayaquil, which service is scheduled to start in the second half of August 2021.

==Supporters==
Barcelona SC has the largest fanbase of any club in Ecuador. According to CONMEBOL, it is considered the most popular sports club in Ecuador with more than 7 million fans as of April 2016. When Barcelona SC plays away, many of their followers from the city of the home team show up to the stadium to root for Barcelona.

Barcelona&#x27;s ultras are known as &quot;La Sur Oscura&quot; (English: &quot;The Dark south&quot;). During home matches, they are located in the southern end of the Estadio Monumental. In Quito, Barcelona&#x27;s ultras are known as &quot;Sur Oscura Quito&quot; (English: &quot;Dark South Quito&quot;). Another group of Barcelona&#x27;s ultras are known as &quot;Zona Norte&quot; (English: &quot;North Zone&quot;).

===Rivalries===
&quot;El Clásico del Astillero&quot; is a match played against Barcelona&#x27;s old rival Emelec. It was not until 22 August 1943 that the two sides faced each other for the first time, in a Guayaquil League match. Sporting their distinctive yellow jerseys, Los Canarios defeated El Eléctrico 4–3, with Pedro Villalta scoring a late winner for Barcelona. It was a match that would forever be remembered as The Derby of the Posts due to the number of times that the Emelec forwards struck the woodwork.

In 1948, the local derby received a name of its own in a preview in the newspaper El Universo, becoming known forever more as El Clásico del Astillero (The Shipyard Derby).

In 1990, proved to be a very special year in the history of El Clásico del Astillero, with the two sides facing off in a Copa Libertadores quarter-final second leg on 29 August. Barcelona de Guayaquil advanced to the semi-finals after a 1–0 win.

The rivalries between these two teams is immense in Ecuador and international that it caught the eye of international filmmaker Filmadora Panamericana and in 1973 a movie was made titled &quot;El derecho de los pobres&quot;, starting Spanish-Mexican actor Enrique Rambal, Mexican actor Enrique Rocha and Ecuadorian football player Alberto Spencer, proclaimed the best Ecuadorian football player of all times, makes his cinema debut.

On social media, the rivalry between the two teams comes up more frequently. The fans take advantage of any slip of the opposite team to create memes and videos to laugh down, especially the day after a game. The most used phrase to highlight the existing rivalry is &quot;Barcelona, tu papá.&quot; (English: &quot;Barcelona is your father&quot;), referring to the fact that Barcelona has always occupied a most important hierarchical position than Emelec in many aspects.

This rivalry has gained special significance with the recent success of both teams in Serie A play, with Barcelona winning in 2012, and Emelec winning in 2013 and 2014. The 2014 championship was decided by a 3–0 Emelec win over Barcelona.

<text>Józef Beck (; 4 October 1894 – 5 June 1944) was a Polish statesman who served the Second Republic of Poland as a diplomat and military officer. A close associate of Józef Piłsudski, Beck is most famous for being Polish foreign minister in the 1930s and for largely setting Polish foreign policy.

He tried to fulfill Piłsudski&#x27;s dream of making Poland the leader of a regional coalition, but he was widely disliked and distrusted by other governments. He was involved in territorial disputes with Lithuania and Czechoslovakia. With his nation caught between two large hostile powers (Germany and the Soviet Union), Beck sometimes pursued accommodation with them and sometimes defied them. He attempted to take advantage of their mutual antagonism but then formed an alliance with the United Kingdom and France. Both declared war on Germany after its invasion of Poland in 1939. After the Soviet Union also invaded Poland, Beck and the rest of his government evacuated to Romania.

==Early life==

Beck was born into a Calvinist (Protestant) family whose forebears had emigrated from Flanders to Poland in the 16th century, during the rule of Polish King Stephen Báthory. When World War I started, Beck was a student at a college of engineering. After the outbreak of the war, Beck was a member of the clandestine Polish Military Organization (&quot;Polska Organizacja Wojskowa&quot;, or &quot;POW&quot;), founded in October 1914 by Piłsudski. Joining in 1914 Beck served until 1917 in the First Brigade of the Polish Legions and was an aide to Piłsudski. When the brigade was interned, Beck escaped.

After Poland had regained its independence, Beck was assigned as a commander of an artillery battery and assigned to the General Staff. Beck served as military attaché to France between 1922 and 1923. The French disliked Beck to the point of spreading lies about him, such that he was a Soviet agent. He helped to carry out the May 1926 military coup d&#x27;état, which brought Piłsudski to &quot;de facto&quot; governmental power.

In 1926–1930, Beck served as chief of staff to Poland&#x27;s Minister of Military Affairs, and in 1930–1932, he served as Vice Prime Minister and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs. Groomed by Piłsudski to implement Poland&#x27;s foreign policy, he in 1932 took office as Minister of Foreign Affairs, a post that he would hold until the outbreak of World War II.

==Foreign minister==
Beck had been dealt a weak hand. The historian David G. Williamson argues that Poland with 35 million people had a large population but a thin industrial base. Furthermore, its army of 283,000 men was ill-equipped, short of artillery and poorly trained and relied heavily on cavalry because it lacked enough mechanisation. Finally it faced long borders with two powerful dictatorships, Hitler&#x27;s Germany and Stalin&#x27;s Soviet Union. Historian Richard Overy wrote that of all the new states in Europe:
In his international diplomacy, Beck sought to maintain a fine balance in Poland&#x27;s relations with its two powerful neighbours. In July 1932, he concluded the Soviet–Polish Non-Aggression Pact and, in January 1934, the German–Polish declaration of non-aggression. 
Beck complained that while Poland and Czechoslovakia were legally bound by treaty to respect the rights of their respective German minorities, the Polish minorities in Germany and the Soviet Union were not so protected. In addition, Beck resented that countries, such as Germany, used the Minorities Treaty to exert pressure and become involved in the internal affairs of Poland. In September 1934, Beck renounced the Minorities Treaty after the Soviet Union had been admitted to the League of Nations.

After Piłsudski&#x27;s death in May 1935, a power-sharing agreement was entered into by the various Piłsudskiite factions, led by General (later Marshal) Edward Rydz-Śmigły, President Ignacy Mościcki and Beck himself. The three individuals effectively dominated the &quot;Sanacja&quot; (Sanation) and collectively ruled Poland until the outbreak of the Second World War. Beck had a more-or-less free hand in formulating Poland&#x27;s foreign policy. The stability of the ruling group was weakened because of personal conflicts, and none of the three men managed to assert his dominance in the late 1930s completely. The oligarchy from 1935 to 1939 is often described by historians as a &quot;dictatorship without a dictator&quot;.

==Strategic ideas==

Beck was hostile to the League of Nations and did not think it could help Poland. France wanted some arrangement with Poland but distrusted Beck and so he looked in new directions. He explored the possibility of realising Piłsudski&#x27;s concept of &quot;Międzymorze&quot; (&quot;Between-seas&quot;), a federation of central and eastern European countries stretching from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea, indeed in later variants from the Arctic Ocean to the Mediterranean. Such a coalition between Germany in the west and the Soviet Union in the east might have been strong enough to deter both from military intervention. Beck realised that for the immediate future there was no realistic chance of building such a force and so he was prepared to settle in 1937–1938 for a diplomatic bloc referred to as a &quot;Third Europe&quot;, led by Poland, which might become the nucleus of a &quot;Międzymorze&quot; federation. Beck&#x27;s &quot;Third Europe&quot; diplomatic concept comprised a bloc made up of Poland, Italy, Yugoslavia, Hungary and Romania.

His efforts failed for several reasons:
*Both Italy and Hungary preferred to align themselves with Germany, rather than Poland.
*The dispute between Romania and Hungary over Transylvania doomed efforts to include them in a common bloc.
*The desire of both Italy and Hungary to partition Yugoslavia blocked any effort to include Rome, Budapest and Belgrade in an alliance.
*None of the other four states that was meant to form the &quot;Third Europe&quot; with Poland was interested in accepting Polish leadership.

From 1935 to 1939, Beck supported German claims against Czechoslovakia by citing purported mistreatment of Polish minorities in Czechoslovakia. In January 1938, he demanded publicly that the Poles living in Czechoslovakia be granted the rights enjoyed by the Germans. In 1937, Beck had also begun a diplomatic offensive in favour of Slovak independence. He supported Hitler&#x27;s position in the Munich agreement in 1938. Within days, Poland invaded and seized Teschen, an industrial district of Czechoslovakia with 240,000 people, where ethnic Poles formed only 35%.

==1939: German invasion ==
In 1937, Hitler continued to assure Beck that Germany had no claims on Danzig, but at the start of 1939, Hitler changed his earlier position and now laid claim to Danzig, adding that military force would not be used.

Beck played a decisive role in early 1939 by staunchly refusing Hitler&#x27;s demands to subordinate Poland and to turn it into a German puppet state. Hitler demanded for Poland to give away strategic territories to Germany and to join the Anti-Comintern Pact, which was directed against the Soviet Union. Beck rejected Hitler&#x27;s demands for annexation of Polish Pomorze (Pomerania), which would have cut off Polish access to the sea and its main trade route, effectively making the Polish economy dependent on Germany. He also rejected demands for an extraterritorial rail and highway corridor that was to run to East Prussia and the Free City of Danzig, in exchange for vague promises regarding trade and annexation of territories inhabited by Ukrainians and Belarusians in the Soviet Union after a future war. While Hitler had been planning to annex Polish territory for several years, he finally decided to go ahead with his plans for war by early September 1939. 
Beck was surprised when Britain, looking for a pretext to confront Germany, announced at the end of March 1939 that it would defend Poland from German attack. France also offered its support, but both countries knew there was very little they could do if Germany invaded Poland.

In April 1939, Beck was in London to negotiate the terms of the British-Polish aid treaty. Beck famously voiced his refusal of German demands in a speech on 5 May 1939:

Similarly, Beck refused a request from the Soviets to allow Soviet forces to enter the country, which was made during talks in which the Polish side did not take part. A third proposal soon followed, once again elaborated by Britain, which promised support to the Polish government if the country&#x27;s borders were endangered. This time around, Beck accepted it. According to Joseph E. Davies, the Polish government underestimated German military power.

As a result, Hitler&#x27;s diplomatic efforts shifted to the Soviet Union and secured the German-Soviet alliance in August 1939. Known as the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, it secured Soviet support in a war, a heavy flow of Soviet food and oil and an agreement to partition Poland and the Baltic states. By now, many observers realised that war between Germany and Poland had become imminent.

==World War II==

Following the invasion of Poland by Germany on 1 September 1939, the start of World War II, Beck called on Poland&#x27;s allies, France and Britain, to enter the war to support Poland. In spite of the agreement between them, France and Britain did little to help Poland directly though both declared war two days after the German invasion.

After the Soviet Union attacked Poland from the east on 17 September 1939, Beck withdrew to Romania, together with the rest of the Polish government. In Romania, he was interned by the authorities at a hotel in Brașov. It was there that he wrote a volume of memoirs, &quot;Ostatni raport&quot; (&quot;Final Report&quot;).

Melchior Wańkowicz, a popular Polish journalist, met Beck in the autumn of 1939 during his internment in Romania. This is how he described the meeting:

Beck died in Singureni, Romania, on 5 June 1944, after developing tuberculosis. Beck was survived by his son Andrzej Beck, who was active in the Polish community in the United States until his death in 2011.

In May 1991, Beck&#x27;s remains were repatriated to Poland and interred at Warsaw&#x27;s Powązki Military Cemetery.

<doc id="1167675" wikidata="Q2480468" url="?curid=1167675" title="The Ballad of Narayama (1958 film)">
<text>is a 1958 Japanese historical drama film directed by Keisuke Kinoshita. It is based on the 1956 novella of the same name by Shichirō Fukazawa. The film explores the legendary practice of &quot;ubasute&quot;, in which elderly people were carried to a mountain and abandoned to die.

==Cast==
* Kinuyo Tanaka as Orin
* Teiji Takahashi as Tatsuhei
* Yūko Mochizuki as Tamayan
* Danko Ichikawa as Kesakichi
* Keiko Ogasawara as Matsu-yan
* Seiji Miyaguchi as Matayan
* Yūnosuke Itō as Matayan&#x27;s son
* Ken Mitsuda as Teruyan

==Reception==
The film was shown in competition at the 19th Venice International Film Festival, where it divided critics between those who thought it a masterpiece and those who thought it poor.

In a June 1961 review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, A.H. Weiler called the film &quot;an odd and colorful evocation of Japan&#x27;s past that is only occasionally striking&quot;, adding that it was &quot;stylized and occasionally graphic fare in the manner of the Kabuki Theatre&quot; and &quot;decidedly strange to Western tastes.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; rated the film a maximum four stars, and added it to his Great Movies list in 2013, making it the final film he added to the list before his death.

==Restoration==
During the 2012 Cannes Film Festival, a digitally restored version of the film was screened out of competition, as part of the festival&#x27;s Cannes Classics selections.

In his 2013 review of the Criterion Blu-ray release of the restored film, Jordan Cronk of &quot;Slant&quot; stated that Kinoshita, a &quot;less celebrated&quot; practitioner in the &quot;jidaigeki&quot; genre, used kabuki theater &quot;as a stylistic blueprint&quot; for his adaptation of the literary source, making it &quot;one of the era&#x27;s most radical experiments&quot; which played &quot;more like a cinematic elegy than cosmetic theater.&quot;

==Awards==
&quot;The Ballad of Narayama&quot; received three Mainichi Film Awards for Best Film, Best Director and Best Film Score. It was submitted as the Japanese entry for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, but was not chosen as one of the five nominees.

<doc id="1167676" wikidata="Q6397618" url="?curid=1167676" title="Seth et Holth">
<text>Seth et Holth is a Japanese film released on September 29, 1993, best noted for starring musicians hide and . The film is based on an original short story by hide and features the tragic plot of two beings from a different plane of existence coming to earth, specifically Tokyo, and being overwhelmed by the city&#x27; sensory overload. The two communicate through swapping blood, and are persecuted and executed.

==Plot==

In the sphere of Athum there once lived two beautiful angels by the names of Seth and Holth. Seth was gentle, kind, and anxious one; Holth was strong, determined, and bold. They lived in peace in the sphere of Athum for eternity, since there is no time, nor age, nor decay in this world. The waters flow uphill and time is irrelevant. Athum takes all and creates everything, for eternity. The angels Seth and Holth lived there undisturbed forever. They made love by their eyes, tasting their tears, they spoke to each other by their blood. They slept in Athum&#x27;s womb not knowing of any evil, plight or fear. No worry, no pain ever harmed them... and they could have gone on like this forever, if not one day bold Holth had started to ask questions... questions about other worlds, other beings, questions about life and death.

He tried to force Athum to tell him but instead for an answer the angels Seth and Holth were banished to planet Earth, thrown into the harshness of light, noise and madness. They woke up from their eternal dream to find themselves reborn to a world full of questions; hectic and evil. Not knowing what to do, only trying to get home again, home to Athum, home to peace.

Hunted down by humans who did not understand, nor ever loved, Seth and Holth were sacrificed and murdered. Seeing their plight in the human world Athum pitied them and allowed them to return home, but home was not the same anymore. They had seen too much, heard too much, felt too much in the human world. They lost their innocence and their faith, they could ignore the questions no longer.

==Cast==
*hide from X Japan as Seth
*Tusk from as Holth

===Names===
Seth or Set is an Egyptian god. Holth may be Horus, if pronounced as the Japanese would, but with wrong romanization. Using foreign, &quot;exotic&quot; mythologies is common in Japanese pop culture.

*Lyrics &amp; vocals: Tusk
*Producer/Script: Hideaki Utsumi (&quot;Fool&#x27;s Mate&quot;)

<doc id="1167677" wikidata="Q44944" url="?curid=1167677" title="Tegaserod">
<text>Tegaserod is a 5-HT4 agonist manufactured by Novartis and sold under the names Zelnorm and Zelmac for the management of irritable bowel syndrome and constipation. Approved by the FDA in 2002, it was subsequently removed from the market in 2007 due to FDA concerns about possible adverse cardiovascular effects. Before then, it was the only drug approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration to help relieve the abdominal discomfort, bloating, and constipation associated with irritable bowel syndrome. Its use was also approved to treat chronic idiopathic constipation.

==Mechanism of action==
The drug functions as a motility stimulant, achieving its desired therapeutic effects through activation of the 5-HT4 receptors of the enteric nervous system in the gastrointestinal tract. It also stimulates gastrointestinal motility and the peristaltic reflex, and allegedly reduces abdominal pain. Additionally, tegaserod is a 5-HT2B receptor antagonist.

==Withdrawal from market==

On 30 March 2007, the United States Food and Drug Administration requested that Novartis withdraw tegaserod from shelves. The FDA alleged a relationship between prescriptions of the drug and increased risks of heart attack or stroke. An analysis of data collected on over 18,000 patients demonstrated adverse cardiovascular events in 13 of 11,614 patients treated with tegaserod (a rate of 0.11%) as compared with 1 of 7,031 patients treated with placebo (a rate of 0.01%). Novartis alleged all of the affected patients had preexisting cardiovascular disease or risk factors for such, and further alleged that no causal relationship between tegaserod use and cardiovascular events has been demonstrated. On the same day as the FDA announcement, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Canada announced that it was suspending marketing and sales of the drug in Canada in response to a request from Health Canada. In a large cohort study based on a US health insurance database, no increase in the risk of cardiovascular events were found under tegaserod treatment. In 2019, tegaserod was reintroduced as for use in irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) in women under 65.

<doc id="1167680" wikidata="Q713161" url="?curid=1167680" title="Bob Gansler">
<text>Bob Gansler (born July 1, 1941) is a Hungarian-born American soccer player and coach of German descent. He coached the U.S. National Team at the 1990 World Cup, the team&#x27;s first appearance at the tournament since 1950.

==Playing career==

As a player, Gansler made 25 appearances for the United States between 1963 and 1969, captaining the 1964 and 1968 Olympic qualifying teams and 1967 Pan American team. Of his 25 appearances, only 5, all in 1968, came in games considered full internationals.

Gansler played for the Chicago Mustangs of the National Professional Soccer League in 1967. When the NPSL merged with the United Soccer Association to form the North American Soccer League, the Spurs likewise merged with the Chicago Mustangs, and Gansler played with the Mustangs of the NASL in 1968.

==Coaching career==

Gansler served in various coaching positions with the national teams beginning in 1975. In the late 1980s, he served as the coach of the U.S. U-20 national team while also coaching the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee men&#x27;s soccer team. On January 16, 1989, the United States Soccer Federation hired him as the full-time coach for the United States men&#x27;s national soccer team, replacing Lothar Osiander. Gansler&#x27;s tenure during the 1990 FIFA World Cup was somewhat controversial, even though he led the United States to its first appearance in the final World Cup tournament in 40 years. He took a team made up primarily of college and amateur players, leaving professionals such as Rick Davis and Hugo Perez off the roster. At the time, the United States did not have a top division outdoor soccer league, the North American Soccer League having folded in 1985. Most domestic professionals at the time played in indoor leagues, and Gansler felt that the skills required for indoor soccer conflicted with the outdoor game. In addition, the United States had been awarded the 1994 World Cup, and Gansler may have wanted to expose the core of the 1994 team to the World Cup experience. Not unexpectedly, the U.S. lost all three games, although the team won a moral victory of sorts by losing to host Italy 1–0; the Italians prevented the embarrassment of a draw thanks to goalkeeper Walter Zenga.

Gansler went on to coach the Kansas City Wizards, winning the club&#x27;s first MLS Cup in 2000 and the U.S. Open Cup in 2004. He also coached the Milwaukee Rampage to the A-League title in 1997. He stepped down from his coaching position with the Wizards on July 19, 2006. Gansler spent the 2007 MLS Season in Canada as an assistant coach for Toronto FC.

==Personal life==

After leaving Toronto FC in 2007, he retired to spend more time with his wife, Nancy, four sons, and 11 grandchildren.

<text>Miguel Ruiz (1856–1912) founded a coffee processing company which would later become &quot;Jimenez &amp; Fernandez, Sucrs, Inc.&quot; the makers of &quot;Café Yaucono&quot;.

==Early years==
Ruiz, a native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, began working in the coffee industry at a young age. His interest in that sector of agriculture led him to establish a small coffee processing company in Miramar, a section of San Juan. In 1896, Ruiz started elaborating coffee using rudimentary equipment. His small operation started to grow and he soon sent for his cousin-in-law, Tiburio Jiménez, who lived in Spain. In 1911, Jiménez went to work and immediately, he too fell in love with the coffee industry. In 1912, tragedy befell upon the family and Miguel Ruiz died. He left the company in the hands of his family and Jimenez.

==&quot;Cafe Yaucono&quot;==

Tomas Prado, from Yauco was the owner of &quot;The Coffee Co.&quot; and in 1914, created the coffee brand &quot;Cafe Yaucono&quot;. Jiménez became interested in the brand and soon began negotiations with Prado with the intention of buying him out. In 1916, Prado sold &quot;The Coffee Co.&quot; and its brand &quot;Yaucono&quot; to the heirs of Migul Ruiz. In 1917, the Ruiz family sold the company and Jiménez quit the company. Soon afterwards, Jiménez started his own company with Juan Fernández which they named &quot;Jiménez &amp; Fernandez, Sucrs.&quot;.

==Jiménez &amp; Fernandez, Sucrs, Inc.==
In 1921, the company, which was incorporated and renamed &quot;Jimenez &amp; Fernandez, Sucrs, Inc.&quot;, bought a lot in the Fernández Juncos Ave. and built a two-story building. The company operated in the first floor and the Jiménez family lived in the second floor. Jiménez married and had three children, among them José Enrique Jiménez.

In 1931, Juan Fernández sold his part of the company to Jiménez. During this period the company was faced with limitations and hardships. The Great Depression, hurricanes and World War II almost completely bankrupted the entire coffee industry in Puerto Rico. Jiménez was forced to close his company on two occasions during this time.

When Jiménez reopened the company, the demand for coffee was so great that its sales soared. In 1957, Tiburcio&#x27;s son José Enrique, began to work for &quot;Yaucono&quot; and in 1960, he was named Manager of the Sales and Marketing departments. José Enrique started a strong advertising campaign and in 1963 introduced the &quot;Cafe Yaucono&quot; character &quot;Mama Inés&quot;, becoming one of the biggest marketing symbols in Puerto Rican history. In 1965, José Enrique was named president and CEO of the company.

==Postscript==
In 1985, &quot;Café Yaucono&quot; received the highest award from the Puerto Rico Product Association, the &quot;International Award for Quality&quot;. In 1996, &quot;Cafe Yaucono&quot; received the &quot;Commercial Prestige Award&quot; from Spain. &quot;Cafe Yaucono&quot; controls 40% of the coffee market in Puerto Rico.

Miguel Ruiz died in San Juan, Puerto Rico in 1912 and Tiburcio Jiménez died in 1975 in the same city.

<doc id="1167687" wikidata="Q5020748" url="?curid=1167687" title="California Penal Code">
<text>The Penal Code of California forms the basis for the application of most criminal law, criminal procedure, penal institutions, and the execution of sentences, among other things, in the American state of California. It was originally enacted in 1872 as one of the original four California Codes, and has been substantially amended and revised since then. 

==History==
The Penal Code enacted by the California State Legislature in February 1872 was derived from a penal code proposed by the New York code commission in 1865 which is frequently called the Field Penal Code after the most prominent of the code commissioners, David Dudley Field II (who did draft the commission&#x27;s other proposed codes). The actual drafter of the New York penal code was commissioner William Curtis Noyes, a former prosecutor. New York belatedly enacted the Field Penal Code in 1881.

Prior to the promulgation of the Model Penal Code in 1962, the Field Penal Code was by far the most broadly influential attempt at codification of criminal law, but was severely flawed in that it actually &quot;continued&quot; many muddled common law concepts (like malice aforethought) when the point of codification was to clean up the common law. About this, UC Berkeley law professor Sanford H. Kadish wrote in 1987: &quot;None of the codes I have considered had a larger measure of influence. None deserved it less.&quot; Before the enactment of the Penal Code, California relied on common law definitions of crimes as well as the accumulated case law that went back to the British common law of post-colonial times.

==Organization==
Like most of California&#x27;s codes, the Penal Code is divided into parts, with the Penal Code containing six, most of which contain titles, some of which are in turn subdivided into chapters, with individual sections comprising the smallest unit of content. Unlike sections of the United States Code, any particular provision of the Penal Code is usually referenced by its section number alone, especially when a police officer in the state refers to a particular criminal act over their radio. Most of this article deals exclusively with the substantive criminal law set out in Part 1.

The first two titles of Part 1, up to Section 33, are preliminary and provide definitions of legal terms rather than definitions of, or punishments for, any specific crimes. The next group of titles, through Section 88, deal with crimes against the state itself, such as treason. Title 7, ending with Section 186, covers the state court system and crimes that can be committed therein, such as perjury. Title 8 covers the subject of violent crimes, and extends through Section 249. Title 9 (Sections 250 through 368) deals with offenses against public morals and decency. Title 10 (Sections 369 through 402) is devoted to &quot;crimes against public health and safety,&quot; while Title 11 (Sections 403–423) is reserved for &quot;crimes against the public peace.&quot; The topic of Title 12 (Sections 424–440) is crimes against public revenue, and of Title 13 (Sections 441 through 593), crimes against property. Title 14 (Sections 594–625) bears the heading &quot;Malicious Mischief,&quot; but in addition to vandalism (Section 594), it also includes such offenses as trespassing (in Section 602). Title 15 (Sections 625–653) deals with &quot;Miscellaneous Crimes,&quot; Title 16 (Sections 654-678) is labeled &quot;General Provisions,&quot; and the last title of Part 1, Title 17 (679 and 680) delineates the &quot;Rights of Victims and Witnesses of Crime.&quot;

Part 2 of the Penal Code (Sections 681–1020) codifies the state&#x27;s criminal procedure system.

Part 3 of the Penal Code (Sections 2000–10007) codifies statutes governing the state&#x27;s corrections system. Part 3 includes provisions governing the operation of the county jails and state prisons, as well as the administration of the death penalty.

Part 4 of the Penal Code (Sections 11006–14315) codifies statutes governing criminal investigations, prison officer training, police officer training, crime control, crime prevention, and gun control.

Part 5 of the Penal Code (Sections 15001–15003) consists of only two sections authorizing the California Peace Officers Memorial Foundation to establish and maintain a memorial to peace officers on the grounds of the state Capitol with private funds.

Part 6 of the Penal Code (Sections 16000–34370) codifies statutes dealing with the management of weapons.

California&#x27;s drug laws are not found within the Penal Code at all, but in a separate enactment, the California Health and Safety Code. Likewise, provisions affecting motorists, motor vehicles, and traffic matters are contained in the California Vehicle Code.

*664 – Attempt (usually charged together with one of the above like 187 or 211; attempted murder was formerly covered in its own section, 217)
*691 – Extortion

&quot;420&quot; for marijuana use is commonly but incorrectly believed to originate from the Penal Code. The actual Section 420 covers obstructing entry on public land.

One of the more controversial sections of the California Penal Code are the consecutive Sections 666 and 667; Section 666, known officially as petty theft with a priorand colloquially, felony petty theft and makes it possible for someone who committed a minor shoplifting crime to be charged with a felony if the person had been convicted of any theft-related offense at any time in the past; and if the person so charged has two previous felony convictions (listed as serious or violent felonies [&quot;strikeable&quot; offenses]), this can result in a 25-years-to-life sentence under the state&#x27;s three strikes law, which is found in Section 667.

The inclusion of felony petty theft within the three-strikes law, and for that matter, the three-strikes law itself, have sparked much debate both within and outside the state, and even beyond the United States. In 2003, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the California three-strikes law against constitutional challenges in two cases where the third strike was a nonviolent crime&quot;Ewing v. California&quot;, , and &quot;Lockyer v. Andrade&quot;, .

<text>The Russian Premier League (RPL; , &quot;Rossiyskaya premyer-liga&quot;; РПЛ), also written as Russian Premier Liga, is the top division professional association football league in Russia. It was established at the end of 2001 as the Russian Football Premier League (RFPL; ; РФПЛ) and was rebranded with its current name in 2018. From 1992 through 2001, the top level of the Russian football league system was the Russian Football Championship (, &quot;Chempionat Rossii po Futbolu&quot;).

There are 16 teams in the competition. As of the 2021/22 season, the league had two Champions League qualifying spots for the league winners and league runners-up, and two spots in the UEFA Conference League were allocated to the third- and fourth-placed teams. However, those have all been suspended due to Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, along with the national team&#x27;s participation in international competitions. The last two teams are relegated to the Russian First League at the end of the season, while the 13th and 14th placed teams compete against the National League&#x27;s 4th and 3rd teams respectively in a two-legged playoff.

The Russian Premier League succeeded the &quot;Top Division&quot; including history and records. The Top Division was run by the Professional Football League of Russia. Since July 2022, the league is currently called Mir Russian Premier League (), also written as Mir Russian Premier Liga (after the Mir payment system), for sponsorship reasons.

Since the introduction of the Russian Premier League in 2002, Zenit Saint Petersburg (10 times), CSKA Moscow (6 times), Lokomotiv Moscow (3 times), Rubin Kazan (2 times) and Spartak Moscow (1 time) have won the title. Zenit Saint Petersburg are the current champions winning the competition since 2018–19 until 2022–23 consecutively.

==History==
After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, starting in 1992, each former Soviet republic organized an independent national championship. In Russia, the six Russian teams who had played in the Soviet Top League in 1991 (CSKA Moscow, Spartak Moscow, Torpedo Moscow, Dynamo Moscow, Spartak Vladikavkaz, and Lokomotiv Moscow) were supplemented with 14 teams from lower divisions to form a 20-team Russian Top Division. The Top Division was divided into two groups to reduce the total number of matches. The number of teams in the Top Division was reduced to 18 in 1993 and 16 in 1994. Since then, the Russian Top Division (and the Premier League since 2002) has consisted of 16 teams, except for a short-lived experiment with having two more teams in 1996 and 1997.

Spartak Moscow won nine of the first ten titles. Spartak-Alania Vladikavkaz was the only team which managed to break Spartak&#x27;s dominance, winning the top division title in 1995. Lokomotiv Moscow have won the title three times, and CSKA Moscow six times. In 2007, Zenit St. Petersburg won the title for the first time in their history in Russian professional football; they had also won a Soviet title in 1984. 2008 brought the rise of Rubin Kazan, a club entirely new to the Russian top flight, as it had never competed in the Soviet Top League.

In preparation for the 2018–19 season, it was decided to hold a rebranding in which a new logo was presented.

As a result of the Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, all Russian club and national teams were banned from European competition indefinitely. Spartak Moscow, who were competing in the UEFA Europa League and were the only Russian club team remaining in European competition at the time, were disqualified from their tie against RB Leipzig, who advanced on a walkover.

==Competition==
Teams in the Russian Premier League play each other twice, once at home and once away, for a total of 30 matches. Three points are awarded for a win, one for a draw, and none for a loss. If teams are level on points, the tie-breakers are the number of wins, then the goal difference, followed by several other factors. If the teams are tied for the first position, the tie-breakers are the number of wins, then head-to-head results. If the teams tied for the first place cannot be separated by these tie-breakers, a championship play-off is ordered.

As of 2020–21 season, the champions qualify for the UEFA Champions League group stage. The runners-up qualifies for the Champions League third qualifying round. The third and fourth-place teams qualify for the UEFA Europa Conference League. If the winner of Russian Cup ends in first or second on the championship in same season, then the third-place team qualifies to UEFA Europa League group stage, while fourth and fifth-place teams qualify for the UEFA Europa Conference League instead. The bottom two teams are relegated to the First League. Starting on the 2020–21 season the teams ranked in 13th and 14th-place play a two legs relegation play-off against 4th and 3rd-place team from National League. The two winners of this play-off secures the right to play in Premier League in following season.

Unlike most other European football leagues, the league traditionally used to run in summer, from March to November, to avoid playing games in the cold and snowy weather in winter. This was altered ahead of the 2012–13 season, with the league planning to run the season from autumn to spring. The transitional season of the competition began in early 2011 and continued until summer of 2012. After the 16 Premier League teams played each other twice over the course of the 2011 calendar year, they were split into two groups of eight, and the teams played other teams in their groups two more times for a total of 44 games (30 in 2011 and 14 in 2012). Those two groups were contested in spring 2012, with the top eight clubs playing for the title and European places. The other sides vied to avoid relegation: the bottom two went down while the next two played off against the sides third and fourth in the National Football League, with the two losers being relegated (or denied promotion). Under the current autumn-spring calendar, the league takes a three-month winter break from mid-December until mid-March. Merging the calendar with other UEFA leagues however, has increased numbers of games in winter. This has resulted in the Russian Far East and Siberian teams being forced to play more home games in hostile weather conditions which affected the Premier League when SKA Khabarovsk took part.

==Youth championship==
The Youth championship (), also known as Youth teams championship (), Reserve team tournament () or Reserves tournament (), full name Youth football championship of Russia among teams of clubs of the Premier League (), is a league that runs in parallel to the Russian Premier League and includes the youth or reserve teams of the Russian Premier League teams. The number of players a team can have on the pitch at a time that are over 21 years of age or without a Russian citizenship is limited. 16 teams participate in the league. Matches are commonly played a day before the match of the senior teams of the respective teams. All of the Russian Premier League teams are obliged to have a youth team that would participate in the Youth championship. The teams that are promoted from the National Football League and do not have a youth team must create one. The teams in the league are not relegated based on their final league position, but on the league position of their respective clubs&#x27; senior teams.

However, some Premier League clubs have three teams. Apart from the senior team and the team that plays in the Youth championship a team might have another senior team that plays in a lower division of Russian football and serves as the farm team for the main team. An example is Krasnodar-2, playing in the Russian First League.

<text>USS &quot;Cobbler&quot; (SS-344), a , was a ship of the United States Navy named for the cobbler, the killifish of New South Wales.

&quot;Cobbler&quot; (SS-344) was launched 1 April 1945 by Electric Boat Co., Groton, Connecticut; sponsored by Mrs. J. B. Rutter; commissioned 8 August 1945.

&quot;Cobbler&quot; arrived at Key West 11 January 1946, for operations locally and in the Caribbean for exercises and training until 27 November 1948. She then sailed for Groton, arriving 1 December for a GUPPY II modernization being completed on 17 August 1949. She departed Groton 24 August for Norfolk, her home port from the time of her arrival, 27 August.

She conducted operations in Florida and Caribbean waters and along the east coast visiting Quebec 10 to 14 September 1953, and returning to Norfolk 19 September. On 27 March 1954 she cleared Norfolk for 3 weeks of operations under the control of the Operational Development Force, cruising with units of the Canadian navy and air force from Bermuda to Nova Scotia.

Her operations in the Caribbean and off the east coast continued, until 6 January 1958, when she departed Norfolk for a tour of duty in the Mediterranean Sea, returning 18 April. She resumed operations off the east coast, cruising to Bermuda in June 1958, and to Quebec with midshipmen embarked in July 1959. From 9 September 1959 through 1960 she was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet&#x27;s Antisubmarine Development Force.

In 1962, &quot;Cobbler&quot; became one of only nine boats to undergo the GUPPY III conversion. She had a hull extension added forward of the control room, a plastic sail and the BQG-4 PUFFS passive ranging sonar, which included the three sharkfin sensors on her deck.

== TCG &quot;Çanakkale&quot; (S 341) ==

Along with , &quot;Cobbler&quot; was transferred to Turkey, under terms of the Security Assistance Program in 1973. Both submarines were handed over on 21 March 1973 in New London. &quot;Cobbler&quot; was renamed TCG &quot;Çanakkale&quot; (S 341), the second submarine of that name. She was formally decommissioned, struck from the US Naval Register, and sold, 28 November 1973. Arriving in Turkey on 15 January 1974 she was commissioned on 12 February 1974. She was finally decommissioned on 22 January 1998.

<text>Bret Hadley &quot;Epic&quot; Mazur (born August 31, 1970) is an American vocalist, rapper, and record producer. He is best known as a founder and former frontman of the rap rock band Crazy Town.

==Early life==
Bret Mazur grew up in Brooklyn, New York, before his parents moved across the country to Hollywood, Los Angeles. It was here that he began to work as a DJ at age 16, and received the pseudonym &quot;Epic&quot; from a friend. Mazur graduated from William Howard Taft High School in Los Angeles. He then collaborated with Richard Wolf as part of the production team Wolf &amp; Epic on albums by Sheena Easton, Bell Biv DeVoe, Ralph Tresvant, MC Lyte and MC Serch, among others.

==Crazy Town==
Crazy Town was formed by Mazur and Seth Binzer, who started collaborating in 1995 under the initial name of &quot;The Brimstone Sluggers&quot;. By early 1999, they were calling themselves Crazy Town, and the full band consisted of Mazur, Binzer, Rust Epique, James Bradley Jr., Doug Miller, DJ AM, and Antonio Lorenzo &quot;Trouble&quot; Valli. Their debut album, &quot;The Gift of Game&quot;, was released in November 1999, having been recorded earlier that year. It would become a major success after their single &quot;Butterfly&quot; reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, sparking record sales in excess of 1.5 million. Their 2002 follow-up album, &quot;Darkhorse&quot;, was a commercial failure in comparison, and the band broke up shortly after its release.

Crazy Town announced in 2007 that they had reformed, and Mazur stated that the band&#x27;s third album, tentatively titled &quot;Crazy Town Is Back&quot;, would be released right after his upcoming solo album, &quot;Strip to This&quot;, in spring 2008. Neither album was released, though Crazy Town did release a third studio album, &quot;The Brimstone Sluggers&quot;, in 2015. Following a year of hiatus from the group, Mazur announced in January 2017 through Facebook that he would no longer tour with the band.

==Record producer==
Mazur was included as a producer for New Edition side project, Bell Biv DeVoe.

==Feature films and television==
In 2014, Mazur became the music and audio department head for Sugar Studios LA. 
Mazur scores and sound designs feature films. He worked on the 2018 film &quot;The Oath&quot;.

==Personal life==
Mazur has one son, named Max, who was born in 1996, and his cousin is actress Monet Mazur. He is of Jewish ancestry.

<doc id="1167717" wikidata="Q1642509" url="?curid=1167717" title="Kyles of Bute">
<text>The Kyles of Bute () form a narrow sea channel that separates the northern end of the Isle of Bute from the Cowal Peninsula in Argyll and Bute, on the Scottish mainland. The surrounding hillsides are roughly wooded, and overlooked by rocky tops and areas of moorland.

The Kyles are split into the East and West Kyles. The East Kyle () runs from Rothesay Bay north west up to the entrance to Loch Riddon. Here at the northern end of the East Kyle are the Burnt Islands and the island of Eilean Dubh. The West Kyle () runs from here southwest, past the village of Tighnabruaich out to the Sound of Bute. The area is a designated National Scenic Area.

The Kyles are reflected in the name of Tighnabruaich-based Shinty team Kyles Athletic.

==Transport==
The narrowest strait is only some across and is spanned by the Calmac ferry from Rhubodach to Colintraive. The crossing takes only 5 minutes, and runs every half hour throughout the day, seven days a week. Since 1999 the service has been operated by , which formerly served on the route from Kyle of Lochalsh to the Isle of Skye. Due to her size relative to the short crossing the ferry normally sails with both ramps unfolded. As the crossing is so short the issue of whether the ferry should be replaced by a bridge has been discussed a number of times, for example by Highlands and Islands Enterprise in 1995.

The A8003 road runs above the West Kyle, reaching a height of just north of Tighnabruaich. On the mainland shore of the East Kyle the A886 road also takes a route above the shoreline, however the B866 road runs closer to the shore of Loch Riddon. The A and B roads meet just north of Colintraive, from where the route of the A886 continues over the ferry to run along the east shore of Bute to Rothesay.

==Tourism==
A trip through the Kyles of Bute was a common feature of a trip &quot;doon the watter&quot; on a Clyde steamer during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. As of 2018 the , the last sea-going paddle steamer in the world, still operates a summer season on the Clyde and continues to offer sailings through the Kyles. The Kyles are also very popular for yachting, and there are many sheltered anchorages.

The Cowal Way, a waymarked footpath between Tighnabruaich and Tarbet, follows the shoreline of the West Kyle, below the A8003. The West Island Way, a waymarked footpath on the Isle of Bute, follows the western shore of the East Kyle for a section of its northern loop: this section is along the A886. Both routes are officially designated as being among Scotland&#x27;s Great Trails.

The Kyles form part of an area marketed for tourism purposes as &quot;Argyll&#x27;s Secret Coast&quot;.

==Conservation==
The area is designated as the Kyles of Bute National Scenic Area, one of the forty such areas in Scotland, which are defined so as to identify areas of exceptional scenery and to ensure its protection from inappropriate development. The designated area covers in total, of which is on land, with a further being marine (i.e. below low tide level), and includes land on Bute and the Cowal peninsula, extending to take in the surroundings of Loch Riddon.

Bird species that can regularly be seen in the Kyles include eider ducks, oystercatchers and herons.

One of the Burnt Islands, Eilean Buidhe, is the site of the remains of a circular vitrified fort about in diameter. The remaining walls stand up to on the eastern side of the site. Further north, Eilean Dearg in Loch Riddon is the site of a Medieval castle that was destroyed by naval action during Argyll&#x27;s Rising in 1685.

==Ownership==

The eastern shores of the East Kyle forms the Ardentraive Estate, which is owned by the Mount Stuart Trust, which also owns Mount Stuart House, and most of the Isle of Bute (including the eastern shoreline of the West Kyle). The Mount Stuart Trust is still largely controlled by the family of the Marquess of Bute, the Crichton-Stuarts.
The Rhubodach estate on Bute, which includes the western shoreline of the East Kyle was formerly owner by actor and director Lord Attenborough. In August 2009 he placed estate up for sale, and a referendum carried out on 12 February 2010 showed 93% of islanders supported a plan land to buy the land for the community. In January 2011 he sold the estate, which consists mostly of forest for the reduced fee of £1.48 million. The Rhubodach estate is now owned by the Bute Community Land Company, a charitable company formed by residents living on the island. The main landowner on the western shoreline of the West Kyle is the Ardlamont Forest, which as of 2002 was owned by Loch Lomond Distillery. A viewpoint and indicator on the A8003 road overlooking the Kyles belongs to the National Trust for Scotland.

<text>FC Spartak Vladikavkaz () was a Russian football club based in Vladikavkaz (formerly Ordzhonikidze), North Ossetia–Alania. Founded in 1921, the club played in the Soviet Top League during the communist era, and won its first and only league title in the 1995 Russian Top League.

==History==
At dissolution of the Soviet Union, Spartak Vladikavkaz were the only non-Muscovite Russian club competing in the old Soviet Top League. This had been their second and last season in the STL. Before that the only other season they competed in the top Soviet division was in 1970.

Their most successful season was 1995 when they managed to win the Russian Premier League champions title after several years of domination by Spartak Moscow. They were the first non-Muscovite Russian club to win the title since Zenit St Petersburg won the STL in 1984. The team had previously won a silver medal for second place in 1992 and 1996. However, in the qualification stages of the UEFA Champions League Alania lost 10–3 on aggregate to the Scottish club Rangers.

However, after departure of manager Valery Gazzaev and several players from the club, Alania were not able to repeat its success, finishing in the bottom half of the table.

Previously, the club was known as &quot;Spartak Ordzhonikidze&quot; (1937–1990), &quot;Spartak Vladikavkaz&quot; (1990–1994, 2006 and from 2016), &quot;Spartak-Alania Vladikavkaz&quot; (1995–1996 and 2003), &quot;Alania Vladikavkaz&quot; (1997–2002, 2004–2005 and from 2007 to 2016).

In season 2005 Alania was relegated from Russian Premier League after 15 seasons of top-flight football.

On 14 February 2006 Alania and another First Division club, Lokomotiv Chita, were denied professional licences by Professional Football League and excluded from professional football for juridical irregularities. On 22 February PFL decided to replace Alania and Lokomotiv with Lada Togliatti and Mashuk-KMV Pyatigorsk, the runners-up in the Second Division. The Russian Football Union did not endorse the exclusion and on 28 February decided to keep Alania and Lokomotiv in the First Division, giving them another chance to fulfill the league requirements. Consequently, on 6 March PFL decided to extend the First Division from 22 to 24 clubs, including Alania, Lokomotiv, Lada, and Mashuk-KMV.

However, on 20 March the Russian Football Union finally decided to exclude Alania and Lokomotiv from the league. This decision was announced by the Professional Football League on 21 March, five days before the start of the First Division.

Alania underwent reorganization, were renamed Spartak Vladikavkaz and on 4 April were admitted into the Russian Second Division, South zone.

After finishing first in the South Zone of 2nd division in the 2006 the team was promoted to Russian First Division and again renamed to Alania.

In 2009, Alania achieved 3rd place in the Russian First Division, just below the nominal promotion places. However, due to FC Moscow being expelled from the Russian Premier League, Alania were chosen to take their place. Their season back in the top flight was not successful and only Sibir Novosibirsk finished below them, thus going back to the First Division; despite the subsequent withdrawal of Amkar Perm and Saturn Moscow Oblast, Alania was refused a reprieve by the RPL.

In the spring of 2011, Alania qualified for the final of the 2010–11 Russian Cup, where it met PFC CSKA Moscow. CSKA already qualified for the UEFA Champions League spot, and therefore Alania secured a spot in the 2011–12 UEFA Europa League regardless of the final result. That is the second occasion in Russian football history when a second-level division team qualified for European competition (the first one was FC Terek Grozny). Alania achieved a rare feat of reaching the cup final without scoring a single regular-time goal. On three occasions they won a penalty shootout after playing the game with a score of 0–0 and once they received a bye after their opponent team went bankrupt.

In February 2014, Alania pulled out of the 2013–14 Russia First Division, due to financial liquidation and sponsorship problems, and the club was dissolved. Before the 2014–15 season, former Alania&#x27;s farm club, FC Alania-d Vladikavkaz, was renamed to Alania, and this club participated in the Russian Professional Football League from the 2014–15 season.

Before the 2016–17 season, FC Alania Vladikavkaz that participated in the third-tier Russian Professional Football League was dissolved and a formally new club called FC Spartak was organized again and registered for PFL. PFL did not allow the club to register with &#x27;Alania&#x27; in their name due to accumulated debts for the club of that name.

Before the 2019–20 season, a new club was created with the historical name Alania that was privately owned, the team was tasked with returning to the elite of Russian football. However, Spartak Vladikavkaz also remained in the Russian Professional Football League for the 2019–20, where it finished in last place, before being dissolved in the summer of 2020.

<doc id="1167721" wikidata="Q1141428" url="?curid=1167721" title="Assist (association football)">
<text>In association football, an assist is a contribution leading to the scoring of a goal, where the contribution is made by someone on the scoring team other than the scorer. Statistics for assists made by players may be kept officially by the organisers of a competition, or unofficially by, for example, journalists or organisers of fantasy football competitions. Recording assists is not part of the official Laws of the Game and the criteria for an assist to be awarded may vary. Record of assists was virtually not kept at all until the end of the 20th century, although reports of matches commonly described a player as having &quot;made&quot; one or more goals. Since the 1990s, some leagues have kept official record of assists and based awards on them.

The separate player statistics &quot;goals&quot; and &quot;assists&quot; may be aggregated to a statistic called &quot;[goal] contributions&quot; or &quot;[goal] involvements&quot; (analogous to what is called a point in ice hockey).

== Criteria ==
Most commonly, an assist is credited to a player for passing or crossing the ball to the scorer. It may also be awarded to a player whose shot rebounds (off a defender, goalkeeper or goalpost) to a teammate who scores. Some systems may credit an assist to a player who wins a penalty kick or a free kick for another player to convert, or to an attacking player for contributing to an own goal. A goal may be unassisted, or have one assist; some systems allow for two assists.

=== Opta criteria ===
Opta, a British sports analytics company and the official provider of Premier League statistics, defines an assist as &quot;The final touch from a teammate, which leads to the recipient of the ball scoring a goal&quot;. &quot;Opta&quot; requires that if the assist is deflected by an opposition player, it must be deemed as travelling to the goalscorer irrespective of the deflection. Also according to &quot;Opta&quot;, &quot;in the event of an own goal, direct free kick goal and direct corner goal, an assist will not be awarded. This same rule applies to penalties unless the penalty taker chooses to pass the ball for another player to score.&quot;

According to Opta, an assist is &quot;not&quot; awarded in the following cases:

* Goals scored directly from penalty kicks, direct free kicks, or corner-kicks
* Own goals
* Deflected or rebounded balls from opponents that affected the ball&#x27;s delivery to the goal scorer.
* Balls rebounded off the post.

Opta attest that this strict definition makes assist statistics more accurate and fair in analyzing players&#x27; sports performance.

===FIFA World Cup===
FIFA&#x27;s Technical Study Group is responsible for awarding assist points at the FIFA World Cup. In the Technical Study Group&#x27;s report on the 1986 World Cup, the authors calculated for the first time unofficial statistics for assists, developing the following criteria:
# An assist was awarded to the player who had given the last pass to the goalscorer.
# In addition, the last but two holder of the ball could get an assist provided that his action had decisive importance for the goal.
# After goals from rebounds those players were awarded an assist who had shot on target.
# After goals scored on penalty or by a directly converted free-kick the fouled player received a point.
# In case that the goalscorer had laid on the goal for himself (dribble, solo run), no assists were awarded.
# No assists were awarded, either, if the goalscorer took advantage of a missed pass by an opponent.

The 1990 World Cup technical report adopted similar criteria, but changed the free-kick/penalty criterion:
*Where goals resulting from penalties are concerned, the player who is fouled in the area receives an assist point (unless, that is, the player who is fouled subsequently executes the penalty himself).

&quot;Planet World Cup&quot; has calculated some retrospective data on assists back to the 1966 World Cup, though the 1986 data differs from that of FIFA.

FIFA started officially keeping track of assists in World Cup tournaments at the 1994 edition. This was popularly ascribed to the popularity of detailed sports statistics among fans. 1994 was also the first World Cup in which assists were used as a tie-breaker in determining the Golden Shoe award for top scorer. In the event, both Hristo Stoichkov and Oleg Salenko tied with 19 points, from 6 goals and 1 assist.

===France===
The French league, Ligue 1, awards the &quot;Trophée de Meilleur Passeur&quot; (&quot;best passer trophy&quot;) to the player with most &quot;decisive passes&quot; in a season, starting in the 2007–08 season. Sports newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot; had unofficially tracked assists for some years prior to then. The league&#x27;s &quot;Commission des Compétitions&quot; includes blocked shots as a subset of &quot;decisive passes&quot;. In 2012–13, Mathieu Valbuena and Dimitri Payet finished with 12 assists, Valbuena winning the trophy by having fewer blocked shots (3 against 5) among his total.

===Spain===
For the 1998–99 La Liga season, SDI sold its Gecasport database to Spanish media, in which were described as &quot;passes which lead immediately to a shot and goal&quot;.

===Ukraine===
In Ukraine, a traceable documentation of assists calculation started out by Ukrainian newspaper &quot;Komanda&quot; during the 2004–05 season of the Ukrainian Higher League (Vyshcha Liha). The calculation of assist has certain problems to establish what is the &quot;last pass&quot; which led to a scored goal. Different institutions have own perception of it. Some specialists consider that an assist has to be a deliberate action meaning that it does not include the situation when a ball randomly rebounded to a scoring striker.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, official game statistics, including assists, for the Premier League, the Scottish Premiership, and the English Football League are provided by PA Sport under the Actim brand. Since the 2006–07 season, assists have been factored into the Actim Index of Premier League player performance. The assist statistics provided by fantasy football competitions may differ from the Actim data; some uniformly credit an assist to whichever teammate last touched the ball before the scorer, regardless of other circumstances of the play. The Premier League Playmaker of the Season award was introduced in the 2017–18 Premier League for the player with most assists.

===United States===
The original North American Soccer League kept assist statistics from its foundation in 1968, as its forebears the United Soccer Association and National Professional Soccer League had done the previous year. Analogous statistics were already being kept in basketball and in ice hockey, both established North American sports.

Major League Soccer formerly awarded the MLS Golden Boot based on 2 points per goal scored and one per assist.

The NCAA makes regulations for statistics, including assists, in college soccer in the U.S. Two players may be credited with assists if the second did not have to beat a defender before passing to the scorer. No assist is awarded for winning a penalty. If a goal is scored after a save, block, or rebound from the goal frame, the first shooter gets an assist.

==Statistics==
These totals are the official records recognised by the relevant governing body. Independent statistics providers may have different data, either through crediting different players for a given goal, or through having begun recording assists earlier or later than the official statistics provider.

<text>Munju (?–477, r. 475–477) was the 22nd king of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. His reign saw considerable disunity within Baekje following the fall of its capital in present-day Seoul.

==Background==
He was the first king to rule Baekje from its new capital in Ungjin, present-day Gongju, after the Han River valley was lost to Goguryeo. He ascended to the throne after his father&#x27;s death in the sack of the former Baekje capital at Hanseong.

Prior to 475, Munju served as chief minister (&quot;Sang-jwa&#x27;pyeong&quot;, 上佐平) under his father, Gaero. In the Goguryeo assault of 475, he went to Silla to request help. According to the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;, he returned with 10,000 Silla warriors but was too late to prevent the fall of the capital.

==Reign==
After the move of the capital, the Baekje power structure fell into chaos when the traditional Buyeo-descended aristocracy clashed with the local Mahan-based clans; rivalry within the old aristocracy, suppressed by previous powerful kings, resurfaced.

He sought to refortify Baekje&#x27;s remaining defenses and strengthen the country&#x27;s position against Goguryeo. He was successful in 476 in gaining suzerainty over the kingdom of Tamna on Jeju Island.

In the midst of this instability, the chief general and Minister of Defense, Hae Gu, took control of the military and killed Munju&#x27;s brother Buyeo Gonji in 477. After this Hae Gu exercised effective rule over the country.

That year, Munju was murdered by an agent of Hae Gu.

==Family==
* Father: Gaero of Baekje
* Mother: unknown
** Brother: Buyeo Gonji (餘餘昆支, ?–477) – military commander and father of 24th King of Baekje, Dongseong of Baekje. He was sent to Japan in 461 where he had a son with a Japanese woman.
** Queen: unknown
*** Buyeo Samgeol/Buyeo Imgeol (扶餘三乞/扶餘壬乞, ?–479) – 23nd King of Baekje, Samgeun of Baekje.

<doc id="1167755" wikidata="Q3788572" url="?curid=1167755" title="II (The Presidents of the United States of America album)">
<text>II is the second studio album by the American rock band The Presidents of the United States of America. It was released via Columbia Records on November 5, 1996, coinciding with the United States presidential election.

==Background==
The album included a few songs that originally appeared on &quot;Froggystyle&quot;, a self-released cassette that was recorded before their debut album, &quot;The Presidents of the United States of America&quot;. These songs, which were re-recorded for this album, were &quot;L.I.P&quot;, then known as &quot;Little Indian Princess&quot;, &quot;Lunatic to Love&quot; and &quot;Puffy Little Shoes&quot;. Also, &quot;Twig&quot; was re-recorded, as it was previously recorded as a B-side to a &quot;Lump&quot; single, where it was known as &quot;Twig in the Wind&quot;. That version was later released on &quot;Rarities&quot; as &quot;Twig (Semi Acoustic Version)&quot;.

==Track listing==
All songs by The Presidents of the United States of America.

#&quot;Ladies and Gentlemen, Part 1&quot; – 1:39
#&quot;Lunatic to Love&quot; – 2:57
#&quot;Volcano&quot; – 2:58
#&quot;Mach 5&quot; – 3:15

#&quot;Bug City&quot; – 3:05
#&quot;Bath of Fire&quot; – 2:57
#&quot;Tiki God&quot; – 2:58
#&quot;L.I.P.&quot; – 3:20

#&quot;Puffy Little Shoes&quot; – 4:59
#&quot;Ladies and Gentlemen, Part 2&quot; – 3:03
#&quot;Basketball Dream&quot; – 0:55 

&quot;Basketball Dream&quot; features a boy, Tony Ballew (a relative of Chris Ballew), describing a dream he had about Magic Johnson - for this reason, the track is often mislabeled &quot;Magic Johnson Dream&quot;. Chris Ballew can be heard faintly whispering the lyrics underneath the boy. The recording of Tony&#x27;s voice, with a different musical backing, previously appeared on &quot;Feel Good&quot;, an album by Ballew&#x27;s pre-PUSA band Egg, in 1987.

<doc id="1167757" wikidata="Q205608" url="?curid=1167757" title="Daihatsu Boon">
<text>The is a subcompact car produced by Japanese automaker Daihatsu since 2004, and also sold under Toyota brand as the between 2004 and the ends of 2023. The Passo was once sold at &quot;Toyota Corolla Store&quot; Japanese dealerships until it was consolidated with other Toyota dealers in 2020.

Outside Japan, the first- and second-generation Boon is sold as the second- and third-generation Sirion. The first-generation Sirion was sold as the Storia in Japan.

According to Daihatsu, the name &quot;Boon&quot; is derived from the English word , and also inspired by the sound that Japanese children make when imitating the sound of a car, while the name &quot;Passo&quot; is Italian for &quot;step&quot;. According to Toyota, the name conjures up the image of a casual and approachable car.


== First generation (M300/AC10; 2004) ==
The development for the first-generation Boon was led by Toyota chief engineer Tetsuya Tada. For the Japanese domestic market, the Boon were available with 996 cc and 1.3-litre engines. The major difference between the Japanese Boon and Sirion are automatic version where the gear-changing located beside the steering on the dashboard and the handbrake below the steering. Both the Japanese Boon and European Sirion were offered in both front-wheel drive and four-wheel drive versions. A 936 cc turbocharged version with four-wheel drive was also available, known as the Boon X4.

The Boon was designed for European tastes and the model took on a larger and stockier frame. It weighs about . With the back seats down, its luggage capacity increases from to .

In early 2005, Daihatsu launched the Japanese-built 2nd generation Sirion in Brunei using the facility and parts from the Boon. The model was discontinued in 2010 before Daihatsu exited the Brunei market as the passenger cars market (except the commercial vehicles) in 2014 and the Sirion is replaced by the Perodua-badged Myvi, which is launched in the country since April 2016.

On 25 May 2005, Malaysian automaker Perodua launched a variant of the Boon known as the Perodua Myvi. Sporting a few cosmetic differences, the Myvi became Perodua&#x27;s best-selling car in Malaysia for 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009.

On 25 December 2006, the Boon was restyled. This version was exported to Europe as the Sirion in 2007.

In 2007, Daihatsu launched the Sirion in Indonesia using the facility and parts from the Myvi.

The Subaru Justy was unveiled at the 2007 Frankfurt Motor Show using the Boon model. It is positioned as an entry-level model in Subaru&#x27;s lineup.

=== Boon Luminas (M500; 2008) ===
On 25 December 2008, Daihatsu and Toyota launched the seven-seat MPV under the Boon and Passo nameplates called the and in Japan. &quot;Sette&quot; means &quot;seven&quot; in Italian, referring to the car&#x27;s 7-seater capability. The Boon Luminas and Passo Sette were discontinued in early 2012 due to poor sales. The Malaysian variant was launched in the country as the Perodua Alza on 23 November 2009, and fared much better there.

== Second generation (M600/AC30; 2010) ==
The second-generation Boon was unveiled in Japan on 15 February 2010 alongside the second-generation Passo. Daihatsu calls this the M600, while Toyota uses the AC30 model code.

The second-generation Myvi, based on the Boon, was released in Malaysia on 17 June 2011.

The third-generation Sirion for the Indonesian market was unveiled at the 19th Indonesia International Motor Show on 23 July 2011.

In April 2013, Toyota New Zealand announced its decision to stop selling the second-generation Sirion, still on sale, stating it was unable to secure Daihatsu products that comply with future regulatory standards for New Zealand.

The second-generation Sirion was discontinued in South Africa in April 2015, when Daihatsu left the South African market.

== Third generation (M700; 2016) ==
The third-generation Boon and Passo were unveiled in Japan on 12 April 2016. Both received the first update on 10 October 2018, along with the introduction of &quot;Style&quot; variant for the Boon. The Passo has an improved collision avoidance support system (Smart Assist III) which can grasp various information such as pedestrians, vehicles, preceding and oncoming vehicles, and obstacles and then activate various driver assistance systems such as alerting the driver or switching between low and high beams.

The third-generation Boon is the only model that is not built as the corresponding generation Perodua Myvi (which is also sold as the Daihatsu Sirion in Indonesia).

<doc id="1167759" wikidata="Q280995" url="?curid=1167759" title="Panchromatic film">
<text>A panchromatic emulsion is a type of photographic emulsion that is sensitive to all wavelengths of visible light, and produces a monochrome photograph—typically black and white. Most modern commercially available film is panchromatic, and the technology is usually contrasted with earlier methods that cannot register all wavelengths, especially orthochromatic film. 

In digital imaging, a panchromatic sensor is an image sensor or array of sensors that combine the visible spectrum with non-visible wavelengths, such as ultraviolet or infrared. Images produced are also black and white, and the system is used for its ability to produce higher resolution images than standard digital sensors. 

==Description==
A panchromatic emulsion renders a realistic reproduction of a scene as it appears to the human eye, although with no colors. Almost all modern photographic film is panchromatic. Some older types of film were orthochromatic and were not sensitive to certain wavelengths of light. As naturally prepared, a silver halide photographic emulsion is much more sensitive to blue and UV light than to green and red wavelengths. The German chemist Hermann W. Vogel found out how to extend the sensitivity into the green, and later the orange, by adding sensitising dyes to the emulsion. By the addition of erythrosine the emulsion could be made orthochromatic while some cyanine derivatives confer sensitivity to the whole visible spectrum making it panchromatic.

However, his technique was not extended to achieve a fully panchromatic film until the early 1900s, shortly after his death. Kenneth Mees credits Wratten &amp; Wainwright with preparing the first commercial plates with panchromatic emulsions. Panchromatic stock for still photographic plates became available commercially in 1906. The switch from orthochromatic film, however, was only gradual. Panchromatic plates cost two to three times as much, and had to be developed in total darkness, unlike orthochromatic—which, being insensitive to red, could be developed under a red light in the darkroom. And the process that increased the film&#x27;s sensitivity to yellow and red also made it oversensitive to blue and violet, requiring a yellow-red lens filter to correct it, which in turn reduced the total amount of light and increased the necessary exposure time.
Orthochromatic film proved troublesome for motion pictures, rendering blue skies as perpetually overcast, blond hair as washed-out, blue eyes nearly white, and red lips nearly black. To some degree this could be corrected by makeup, lens filters, and lighting, but never completely satisfactorily. But even those solutions were unusable for additive color motion picture systems like Kinemacolor and Prizma color, which photographed on black-and-white stock behind alternating color filters. In those cases, negative film stock after it arrived from the manufacturer had to be passed through a color-sensitizing solution, a time-consuming process that increased the film&#x27;s cost from 3 cents per foot to 7 cents. Eastman Kodak, the supplier of motion picture film, introduced a panchromatic film stock in September 1913, available on special order for photographing color motion pictures in additive systems. Photographers began using it for black-and-white films too in 1918, primarily for outdoor scenes. The company introduced Kodak Panchromatic Cine Film as a regular stock in 1922. The first black-and-white feature film photographed entirely on panchromatic stock was &quot;The Headless Horseman&quot; (1922). But early panchromatic stock was more expensive, had a relatively short shelf-life, and was more difficult for laboratories to process because it required working in total darkness. Not until the prices were equalized by competition in 1926 did it become used more widely than orthochromatic stock. Kodak discontinued manufacturing general-purpose orthochromatic motion picture film in 1930.

Digital panchromatic imagery of the Earth&#x27;s surface is also produced by some modern satellites, such as QuickBird, Cartosat and IKONOS. This imagery is extremely useful, as it is generally of a much higher (spatial) resolution than the multispectral imagery from the same satellite. For example, the QuickBird satellite produces panchromatic imagery having a pixel equivalent to an area , while the multispectral pixels represent an area of .
