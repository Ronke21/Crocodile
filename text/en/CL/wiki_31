<text>Randolph–Macon College is a private liberal arts college in Ashland, Virginia. Founded in 1830, the college has an enrollment of more than 1,500 students. It is the second-oldest Methodist-run college in the country, and the oldest in continuous operation. The college primarily offers bachelor&#x27;s degrees.

== History ==
Randolph–Macon was founded in 1830 by Methodists Hekeziah G. Leigh and John Early and Staten Islander Gabriel Poillon Disosway. It was originally located in Boydton, near the North Carolina border, but as the railroad link to Boydton was destroyed during the Civil War, the college&#x27;s trustees decided to relocate the school to Ashland in 1868. The college takes its name from Virginia statesman John Randolph and North Carolina statesman Nathaniel Macon.

The original site of Randolph–Macon features a historical marker and ruins of the classroom buildings. The original campus became the home of the Boydton Academic and Bible Institute, a Christian school for African Americans which operated from 1878 to 1935.

In 1847, Randolph–Macon College established a relationship with Hampden–Sydney College. The relationship led to the formation of the Randolph–Macon Medical School, which closed in 1851. Its president William A. Smith delivered a set of lectures advocating slavery in 1856 and 1857.

The college has a historical relationship with Randolph College (formerly known as Randolph–Macon Woman&#x27;s College) in Lynchburg, Virginia. The former women&#x27;s college was founded under Randolph–Macon&#x27;s original charter in 1893 by the then-president William Waugh Smith; it was intended as a female counterpart to the then all-male Randolph–Macon. The two schools later separated to become distinct institutions governed by two separate boards. Randolph–Macon College became co-educational in 1971 with the enrollment of 50 women and the first full-time female faculty member. (Randolph College became co-educational in 2007.)

In 1892, two preparatory schools — both called Randolph–Macon Academy — were founded. The only one that remains today is Randolph–Macon Academy in Front Royal, Virginia. Randolph–Macon Academy is today the only co-educational military boarding school in the country affiliated with the United States Air Force Air Force Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFJROTC). Currently, there are no formal relationships or agreements between Randolph-Macon Academy and Randolph–Macon College aside from the shared names, mascots, and school colors.

Randolph–Macon College became the first college south of the Mason–Dixon line to require physical education coursework for graduation. The old gym, built in 1887, was the first structure in the South to be constructed solely for instruction in physical education. Randolph–Macon is considered to be the first college in the South to offer English as a full discipline and to develop biology as a distinct study. Its computer science department is one of the oldest in the country associated with a liberal arts school; in the 1960s, when the program was established, many academics believed computer science to be more appropriate for a commercial trade or secretarial school than a traditional four-year institution.

Since 1923, the college has been home to the Zeta of Virginia chapter of Phi Beta Kappa society, the nation&#x27;s oldest academic honor society. Chi Beta Phi, the national science honorary society, was founded at Randolph–Macon in 1916.

== Academics ==
Randolph–Macon offers two undergraduate degrees: the bachelor of arts and the bachelor of science. All students must satisfy the general collegiate curriculum, which requires them to take courses in each of the college&#x27;s &quot;Areas of Knowledge&quot;: civilizations, arts and literature, natural and social sciences, mathematics, foreign languages, and wellness. Its most popular majors, based on 2023 graduates, were:

*Business/commerce (63)
*Biology/biological sciences (39)
*Registered nursing (36)
*Psychology (22)
*Political science and government (18)

The institution began providing a master of science program in physician&#x27;s assistant studies in 2023.

The student-faculty ratio is 12:1.

=== Calendar ===
Randolph–Macon operates on a 4-1-4 academic calendar. This allows for two four-month semesters (fall and spring) with a one-month term in January to split up the semesters. During the January Term (colloquially called &quot;J-Term&quot;), students are afforded the opportunity to take intensive study courses on the Randolph–Macon campus, travel the globe as part of a study-abroad course, or participate in professional internships in their field(s) of study and interest.

=== Four-year degree guarantee ===
In 2011, Randolph–Macon announced a four-year degree guarantee program. The college guarantees that entering freshmen will graduate in four calendar years and, if qualifying students are not able to meet that requirement, the college will waive tuition costs for the courses that the student needs to complete their degree.

== Facilities ==
Randolph–Macon College has over 60 academic, administrative, athletic, and residential buildings on its campus of located in the heart of Ashland, Virginia. The oldest building is Washington-Franklin Hall, built in 1872, soon after the college moved to Ashland from Boydton. It was the first brick building in Ashland, and its construction was funded by the students. Renovated in 1987, Washington-Franklin Hall now houses the history department. Pace-Armistead Hall was built in 1876 (renovated 1997) and originally housed the chemistry department. Today, it is home to the studio art department, including the Flippo Art Gallery. The original Duncan Methodist Church was built in 1879 and was renovated to include classrooms and offices for the music and arts departments. All three buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and collectively they make up &quot;Historic Campus.&quot;

Copley Science Center is the largest academic building on campus. The biology, chemistry, physics/astrophysics, environmental studies, computer science, and mathematics departments are all located in Copley. Copley Science Center was built as an extension of Smithey Hall, which today houses the psychology department. Just north of Copley is Keeble Observatory, which includes a 12&quot; Cassegrain reflector optical telescope, and two radio telescopes.

Randolph–Macon has one main library: McGraw-Page Library. Formerly, the library was located in Peele Hall, which is now the main administrative building on-campus and includes the Copy Center, Registrar&#x27;s Office, Human Resources, provost, dean of students, and the president.

There are 12 residence halls on campus. The seven halls on the north end of campus are collectively known as the Freshman Village. About 75% of the college&#x27;s freshmen live in one of those halls. The four located near the center of campus house upperclassmen and the remaining freshmen. These include the two oldest residence halls – Thomas Branch Hall and Mary Branch Hall. The college also owns most of the fraternity and sorority houses, other houses devoted to special interest groups, and on-campus townhouses (usually reserved for seniors). Andrews Hall, named after former dean of students Rev. Ira Andrews, opened in fall 2011. The newest residence hall, Birdsong Hall, named for Constance and Thomas Birdsong &#x27;49, opened in fall 2014. Birdsong Hall provides housing for upperclassmen, including common areas, study rooms, and laundry facilities.

The college announced a $100 million capital campaign in 2011. A large portion of the funds will go toward enhancing facilities, including two new residence halls, new football and baseball fields and stadiums, additions and renovations to the McGraw-Page Library and Copley Science Center, along with the destruction of the Brown Campus Center that was rebuilt into the Brock Commons in 2013.

In 2021, ground was broken on Duke Hall, a new 45,000-square-foot facility which will house team locker rooms, coaches offices, a new press box, and a floor fully dedicated to the Physician Assistant graduate program, scheduled to begin accepting application in the spring of 2022. Projected opening of Duke Hall, located adjacent to the home side of Day Field, is in the autumn of 2022.

The main north–south railroad line for the east coast runs through the campus. Most of the campus is located to the east of the railroad, but a handful of college offices, special interest houses, and athletic fields are located to the west of the tracks. The Ashland train station (not part of the R-MC campus) is directly across from the southern entrance to the campus.

== Athletics ==
Randolph–Macon athletic teams are the Yellow Jackets (or more simply, as &quot;The Jackets&quot;). The college is a member of the Division III level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), primarily competing in the Old Dominion Athletic Conference (ODAC) since the 1976–77 academic year.

Randolph–Macon competes in 20 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, football, golf, lacrosse, soccer, swimming, tennis and volleyball (which was added in 2019); while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, field hockey, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis and volleyball; and co-ed sports include dance/cheer and equestrian.

The Hampden–Sydney vs. Randolph–Macon rivalry is a sports rivalry between the Hampden–Sydney College Tigers and the Randolph–Macon College Yellow Jackets. The college football rivalry between the NCAA Division III schools, often known simply as &quot;The Game&quot;, dates to 1893 and has been called the oldest small-school rivalry in the Southern United States. The rivalry now crosses all sports, with the men&#x27;s basketball series in particular gaining national attention.

On November 24, 2020, the 1984 football victory over Hampden–Sydney was voted the greatest football game in the history of Randolph–Macon dating back to 1891. In this game, Randolph–Macon&#x27;s defense forced five turnovers which allowed the explosive and record breaking offense to score 31 points in a 31–10 victory. This allowed Randolph–Macon to advance to the NCAA playoffs for the first time in the school&#x27;s history finishing the regular season ranked #5 in the NCAA and #1 in the NCAA South Region. During this historic season, Randolph Macon wide receiver Keith Gilliam had an NCAA record of nine consecutive receptions for touchdowns.

On March 19, 2022, Randolph–Macon won its first national title in the school&#x27;s history as the men&#x27;s basketball team soundly defeated Elmhurst College, 75–45. The Yellow Jackets set a school record for wins and finished with a 33–1 record, including a 19–0 finish in ODAC conference play.

The college maintains a Hall of Fame of former especially accomplished athletes based upon their past athletic records.

<text>The Lambda 10 Project is an American national clearinghouse of information about LGBT issues in American fraternities and sororities. The organization works &quot;to heighten the visibility of LGBTQ Greek members and offers educational resources related to sexual orientation and the fraternity and sorority experience.

== History ==
In the 1990s, Shane Windmeyer, assistant director of student activities at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte began speaking at colleges about LGBTQ issues in fraternities and sororities. In 1995, Windmeyer formed and became the coordinator of The Lambda 10 Project at Indiana University Bloomington; it is currently housed in the IU Office of Student Ethics and Anti-harassment Programs and is overseen by the Lambda 10 Steering Committee.

Lambda 10 Project is an educational initiative of Campus Pride, a national nonprofit organization. 

== Activities ==
The Lambda 10 Project provides an index of lecturers available for events; lists of Internet forums concerning LGBT Greek life; and a repository of magazine articles, websites, and pertinent news stories. 

Working with the LGBT publisher Alyson Publications, the Lambda 10 Project compiled and released four anthologies of homosexual and bisexual students&#x27; Greek experiences, edited for Windmeyer, including &quot;Out on Fraternity Row: Personal Accounts of Being Gay in a College Fraternity&quot; in 1998. This was the first book to explore &quot;the collective experience of sexual identity and fraternity life&quot;. It shared both homophobia and acceptance within Greek life.

<text>The Claremont Graduate University (CGU) is a private, all-graduate research university in Claremont, California. Founded in 1925, CGU is a member of the Claremont Colleges consortium which includes five undergraduate and two graduate institutions of higher education.

The university is organized into seven separate units: the School of Arts &amp; Humanities; School of Community &amp; Global Health; Drucker School of Management; School of Educational Studies; the School of Social Science, Policy, &amp; Evaluation; the Center for Information Systems &amp; Technology; and the Institute of Mathematical Sciences. It is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity.&quot;

== History ==
Founded in 1925, CGU was the second of the Claremont Colleges to form, following Pomona College and preceding Scripps College. The school has undergone several name changes since its inception. After being called Claremont University College for 37 years, in 1962 the school officially became known as Claremont Graduate School and University Center. Five years later, in 1967, the name was again changed to Claremont University Center, and in 1998 it acquired the name Claremont Graduate University.

The Claremont Colleges were designed to incorporate the Oxford Model of higher education. Instead of one large university composed of several separate schools, the Claremont Colleges are made up of different institutions designed around differing theories of pedagogy. CGU was founded upon the principle that graduate education is separate and distinct from undergraduate education. Students discover and cultivate their disciplines during undergraduate course work; at CGU students continue cultivation of their own disciplines, but are also expected to augment this with research that incorporates other disciplines as well. This is called &quot;Transdisciplinarity&quot; and is an essential component of Claremont Graduate University&#x27;s functioning theory of pedagogy.

The school is home to more than 2,000 master&#x27;s and PhD students, as well as approximately 200 full and part-time faculty members. The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching has classified Claremont Graduate University as a CompDoc/NMedVet: Comprehensive doctoral (no medical/veterinary) with high research activity. Its seven academic units and other related programs and institutes award master&#x27;s and/or doctoral degrees in 31 disciplines. Enrollment is limited and classes are small. In 2018, the university also introduced its first online master&#x27;s degree programs.

== Academics ==

<text>Brant Julian Parker (August 26, 1920 – April 15, 2007) was an American cartoonist. He co-created and drew &quot;The Wizard of Id&quot; comic strip until passing the job on to his son, Jeff Parker, in 1997. Cartoonist Johnny Hart, his co-creator, continued writing the strip until his death on April 7, 2007. Parker himself died eight days later, on April 15.

== Life ==
Parker studied at the Otis Art Institute in Los Angeles, California. He worked for the Walt Disney Studio before and after World War II, taking time off to serve in the United States Navy. After leaving Disney in 1945, he moved to New York to work as a political cartoonist for the &quot;Binghamton Press&quot;.

==Collaborations==
It was in New York that he met Johnny Hart in 1950; Parker was judging an art contest in which 18-year-old Hart was an entrant. The meeting was the beginning of a friendship that led to the two collaborating on &quot;The Wizard of Id&quot; in 1964. Parker teamed with Don Wilder on the political commentary strip, &quot;Goosemyer&quot;, which ran from 1981 to 1983. He collaborated with Bill Rechin and Wilder on the strips &quot;Out of Bounds&quot; and &quot;Crock&quot;. Early on, Parker left those strips to devote more time to &quot;The Wizard of Id&quot;.

==Awards==
Parker received the National Cartoonists Society Humor Comic Strip Award for 1971, 1976, 1980, 1982 and 1983. He also received their Reuben Award for his work on the strip in 1984 and their Elzie Segar Award in 1986.

<text>Tombouctou Region or Timbuktu Region (Bambara: ߕߎߡߎߕߎ ߘߌߣߋߖߊ, Tumutu Dineja) is one of the administrative regions of Mali. For administrative purposes, the region is subdivided into five cercles.

The region is part of northern Mali that was separated and declared independent by the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA) during the Tuareg rebellion of 2012. In the course of the conflict, the MNLA lost control of the territory to Islamist militias.

Tombouctou Region is world-famous for its capital, the ancient city Timbuktu (), synonymous to 19th-century Europeans with an elusive, hard-to-reach destination. The city gained fame in 1390 when its ruler, Mansa Musa I, went on a pilgrimage to Mecca, stopping with his entourage in Egypt and dispensing enough gold to devalue the Egyptian currency. This started the legend of a city in the interior of Africa, where roads were said to be paved with gold and buildings topped with roofs of gold.

==History==

The city is located at the southern edge of the Sahara, near the Niger River, which has headwaters in the highlands very near the Atlantic coast before its long journey to the north east, before finally turning south to reach the Atlantic. The riches of the kingdom were due to Tombouctou&#x27;s position as the southern terminus of the trans-Saharan trade in gold, salt, kola nuts, copper and slaves.

Timbuktu&#x27;s decline began with the capture of the city by Morocco in 1592. Many Islamic scholars were dispersed, some to Morocco. Morocco had difficulty holding onto the city, as the supply lines were long compared to the closer kingdoms vying for dominance of the region. Furthermore, the Moroccans did not establish a proper means of which to govern Timbuktu, and their other holdings along the Niger bend. Ultimately, however, it was the rise of sea trade along the West Africa coast that doomed the overland routes that connected North Africa to sub-Saharan Africa. The city lost its economic base and its fine university was not enough to save Timbuktu from decline.

Cut off from major trade routes, the city retained an aura of spectacular treasure. When French explorers rediscovered the city in 1815, they were disappointed to find a sand-blown city of low mud buildings.

The region was marginalized under French colonial control, which ended in 1960. The French opened up shorter trade routes to the Atlantic, cutting into the trans-Sahara trading economy and people in the city.

In early 2012, the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad and other militant groups opposed to the government of Mali swept through the region, entering Timbuktu without a fight after making a deal with local Arab militias. On 6 April 2012, the region was declared independent from Mali as part of the new country of Azawad. However, Mali refused to acknowledge the Azawadi Declaration of Independence, and the international community continues to recognise Bamako&#x27;s claim to the region.

==Administrative subdivisions==
The region is divided into five &quot;cercles&quot;:
The larger parts of Timbuktu and Goundam cercles (323,326 km² with about 134,000 inhabitants) were separated in 2016 to form the new Taoudenit Region.

<text>Pondus is a comic strip created by the Norwegian cartoonist Frode Øverli. Since its start in 1995, it has become one of the most successful comic strips in Scandinavia. It has been translated to several languages, including Danish, English, German, Finnish, French, Icelandic, Latin, Sami, Swedish and Esperanto.

In 2000 it inspired its own magazine.

==Publication history==
Øverli initially developed a strip titled &quot;A-laget&quot; (A-team) in 1995, prior to leaving the magazine &quot;Pyton&quot;. This early version focused on three characters who were fanatical football-supporters. By the time the strip in its earliest form was first published in a small local newspaper &quot;Vest-Nytt&quot; of Sotra on 28 October 1995, it had taken the name &quot;Pondus&quot;. In 1996 it began a four-year run as a supporting strip in the Norwegian magazine devoted to Bud Grace&#x27;s &quot;Ernie&quot;, leading to its breakthrough on 2 April 1997, when it was taken on as a daily strip in national distribution newspaper &quot;Dagbladet&quot;.

On 4 July 2000 it began publication in its own &quot;Pondus&quot; magazine, as the first Norwegian strip to ever carry its own monthly publication. This was followed on 6 June 2001 with the launch of a Swedish sister magazine. The strip runs daily in more than 80 Norwegian newspapers, and is syndicated to several international publications, most notably Swedish &quot;Dagens Nyheter&quot;, Danish &quot;Berlingske Tidende&quot;, and Icelandic &quot;Frettabladid&quot;.

As of 2007&#x27;s first issue, &quot;Pondus&quot; magazine left publisher Schibsted to continue its run with publisher Egmont. In a simultaneous event, the character Pondus quit his job as a bus driver, and bought a pub.

Frode Øverli has twice received the Sproing Award for Pondus, in 1998 and 2003, and the Adamson Award in 2006.

<text>The University of Lethbridge Students&#x27; Union (ULSU) is a non-profit organization representing interests of undergraduate students studying at the University of Lethbridge.

With approximately 7800 students on the main Lethbridge campus and 500 students in the Calgary campus, the ULSU administers student affairs, including advocacy, committee representation, student services, and events.

==Authority==
The ULSU is not a university department; it is an independent organization, established in 1967 by the Lieutenant Governor in Council, of Alberta. It reports to the provincial government rather than university administration.

The ULSU receives authority to conduct business through the &quot;Post-Secondary Learning Act of Alberta(PSLA)&quot;. The Act establishes all student associations in Alberta as a corporation, whose members are the students of the public post-secondary institution.

The PSLA allows student associations to administer student affairs, promote general student welfare, create governing documents, acquire property, and maintain the organization through the levy of mandatory fees.

==Representation==
Federally, the University of Lethbridge Students&#x27; Union participates in the Canadian Alliance of Students Associations, and provincially, they are a member of the Council of Alberta University Students. Council members sit on the Social Housing and Action Committee and the Plan-Your-City Advisory Committee through the City of Lethbridge. Councils in the past have held seats on other municipal committees. Council members sit on numerous committees within the University of Lethbridge itself as well.

<doc id="1164286" wikidata="Q1109330" url="?curid=1164286" title="Sea lettuce">
<text>The sea lettuces comprise the genus Ulva, a group of edible green algae that is widely distributed along the coasts of the world&#x27;s oceans. The type species within the genus &quot;Ulva&quot; is &quot;Ulva lactuca&quot;, being Latin for &quot;lettuce&quot;. The genus also includes the species previously classified under the genus Enteromorpha, the former members of which are known under the common name green nori.

==Description==
Individual blades of &quot;Ulva&quot; can grow to be more than 400 mm (16 in) in size, but this occurs only when the plants are growing in sheltered areas. A macroscopic alga which is light to dark green in colour, it is attached by disc holdfast. Their structure is a leaflike flattened thallus.

==Nutrition and contamination==
Sea lettuce is eaten by a number of different sea animals, including manatees and the sea slugs known as sea hares. Many species of sea lettuce are a food source for humans in Scandinavia, Great Britain, Ireland, China, and Japan (where this food is known as &quot;aosa&quot;). Sea lettuce as a food for humans is eaten raw in salads and cooked in soups. It is high in protein, soluble dietary fiber, and a variety of vitamins and minerals, especially iron. However, contamination with toxic heavy metals at certain sites where it can be collected makes it dangerous for human consumption.

==Aquarium trade==
Sea lettuce species are commonly found in the saltwater aquarium trade, where the plants are valued for their high nutrient uptake and edibility. Many reef aquarium keepers use sea lettuce species in refugia or grow it as a food source for herbivorous fish. Sea lettuce is very easy to keep, tolerating a wide range of lighting and temperature conditions. In the refugium, sea lettuce can be attached to live rock or another surface, or simply left to drift in the water.

==Health concerns==
In August 2009, unprecedented amounts of these algae washed up on the beaches of Brittany, France, causing a major public health scare as it decomposed. The rotting leaves produced large quantities of hydrogen sulfide, a toxic gas. In one incident near Saint-Michel-en-Grève, a horse rider lost consciousness and his horse died after breathing the seaweed fumes; in another, a lorry driver driving a load of decomposing sea lettuce passed out, crashed, and died, with toxic fumes claimed to be the cause. Environmentalists blamed the phenomenon on excessive nitrogenous compounds washed out to sea from improper disposal of pig and poultry animal waste from industrial farms.

==Species==
Species in the genus &quot;Ulva&quot; include:

<doc id="1164290" wikidata="Q1054656" url="?curid=1164290" title="A Taxing Woman">
<text>is a 1987 Japanese film written and directed by Juzo Itami. It won numerous awards, including six major Japanese Academy awards. The title character of the film, played by Nobuko Miyamoto, is a tax investigator for the Japanese National Tax Agency who employs various techniques to catch tax evaders.

Itami took inspiration for the movie after entering a higher tax bracket following the success of his first film, &quot;The Funeral&quot;.

A sequel, &quot;A Taxing Woman&#x27;s Return&quot;, featuring some of the same characters but darker in tone, was released in 1988.

==Plot==
A female tax auditor, Ryōko Itakura, inspects the accounts of various Japanese companies, uncovering hidden incomes and recovering unpaid taxes.

One day Itakura persuades her boss to let her investigate the owner of a string of love hotels who seems to be avoiding tax, but after an investigation no evidence is found. During the investigation the inspector and the inspected owner, Hideki Gondō, develop an unspoken respect for each other.

Itakura is promoted to the post of government tax inspector. When the same case involving Gondō reappears Itakura is again allowed to investigate. During a sophisticated series of raids against the hotel owner&#x27;s interests, she accidentally comes across a hidden room containing vital incriminating evidence.

Six months later the two meet again. Gondō is tired after daily interrogations. Itakura tries to persuade him to surrender his last secrets for the sake of his son. Gondō asks Itakura to leave her job and come live with him, but she declines. He cuts his finger and writes the name of the secret bank account in blood on a handkerchief of hers that he saved from the first time she investigated him.

<text>Herty Lewites Rodríguez (December 24, 1939 – July 2, 2006) was a Nicaraguan politician. He was Mayor of Managua and a candidate for president in the 2006 Nicaraguan general election when he died suddenly.

== Early life and involvement in the Nicaraguan Revolution ==
Lewites was born on December 24, 1939 in the San Felipe barrio of Jinotepe, the son of a Jewish immigrant from Poland (a candymaker) and a Catholic Nicaraguan. The two had met when his father visited Nicaragua from New York, fell in love with his mother and settled there. In Nicaragua his father owned the only gas station in town, Texaco, and two friends Lewites met at the gas station became pivotal in forming his commitment to fight the Somoza dictatorship: during the April 1954 rebellion, Lewites, then 15, was shocked by the murders of his friends Pablo Leal and Adolfo Báez Bone by the Somoza National Guard. He joined the struggle against the Somoza dictatorship in 1958 and went into exile in Brazil in 1960 with his father following Lewites’ participation in the military action taking of the Jinotepe and Diriamba headquarters. Later Lewites went to El Salvador, Mexico and Cuba, and in 1969 he joined the Sandinista National Liberation Front. Rather than fighting, he began directing Solidarity Committees, becoming involved in financial matters and arms smuggling for the revolutionary movement. In 1973 he was imprisoned in the United States for illicit arms trafficking, spending a year and a half in a federal penitentiary at San Pedro, California. Outside of prison, he was highly effective and creative in his efforts, staging photography sessions to mislead the Somocistas about the whereabouts of key Sandinista fighters like Nora Astorga. He also helped form the Group of 12, a group of major Nicaraguan establishment figures who agreed to show public support for the Sandinistas, lending legitimacy to the FSLN. 

His brother, Israel Lewites, was involved in armed struggle and died in the attack on the Masaya barracks in October 1977.

== Years in government ==
During the period of Sandinista rule in the 1980s, Lewites was an ally of the powerful Ortega brothers. As Minister of Tourism, he promoted state development projects, such as the Montelimar beach resort in 1986 and the Olof Palme Convention Center in Managua. 

Lewites was twice married, first to Edda María Lacayo, with whom he had a son and later to Carmen García, who was his secretary at the Ministry of Tourism. He left his first wife and had a daughter with García.

After leaving government, he built the &quot;Hertylandia&quot; private amusement park.

Lewites was elected to Congress on the FSLN ticket in 1990, the year Daniel Ortega lost the presidency. He aligned himself with Sergio Ramírez&#x27;s Sandinista Renewal Movement (Movimiento Renovador Sandinista or &quot;MRS&quot;) against the faction of Secretary General Ortega in 1994. He ran for mayor of Managua, the capital, in 1996 on his own &quot;Sol&quot; ticket, splitting the Sandinista vote to throw the election to the Liberal candidate. With the support of the FSLN &quot;Business Bloc&quot; led by Bayardo Arce, Lewites rejoined the mainline FSLN in 1998 and, with Ortega&#x27;s blessing, won the Managua mayorship as a Sandinista in 2000.

Lewites opened Nicaragua&#x27;s only amusement park, Hertylandia (named after himself), between Jinotepe and San Marcos.

Following Ortega&#x27;s third successive election defeat in 2001, Lewites advocated FSLN cooperation with President Enrique Bolaños in his struggle to hold ex-President Arnoldo Alemán accountable for corruption. Ortega, however, eventually concluded a pact with Alemán. Meanwhile, Lewites removed corrupt members of the Ortega and Arce factions from positions in the Managua municipality. By appealing to both leftists and rightists fed-up with corruption, Lewites was for a while the most popular politician in Nicaragua and attracted the support of many historically prominent Sandinistas. He attempted to challenge Daniel Ortega for the 2006 FSLN presidential nomination, but was expelled from the FSLN (Sandinista Party) in February 2005.

Lewites joined forces with the dissident MRS Party as their Presidential candidate for the 2006 election. He chose Edmundo Jarquín as his running mate for the vice presidency.

== Death ==
On July 2, 2006, it was reported that Lewites died of a massive heart attack at the Hospital Metropolitano &quot;Vivian Pellas&quot; in Managua, aged 66, four months prior to the 2006 national elections. Some of Lewites supporters suspected he was poisoned by Ortega. His wife did not ask the doctor for autopsy to identify the cause of his death and later remained silent to the press. Lewites was polling in third place before dying, trailing very closely behind Ortega and Eduardo Montealegre. His death sealed Ortega’s victory, as his 1998 pact with Arnoldo Alemán changed the election rules to require a candidate only exceed 35% of the vote to win without a runoff.

Lewites was buried in his native city of Jinotepe three days after he died. His burial counted with the presence of: the president of the republic, cabinet members, diplomatic representatives, artists, politicians and entrepreneurs. It is calculated that more than 20,000 people were in attendance in the small cemetery of Jinotepe. His rectangular tomb depicts a Star of David with a Christian cross in the center and an epitaph, inscribed on marble, repeats a sentiment he was known for: &quot;I was born under one dictatorship and I don&#x27;t want to die under another.&quot;

<doc id="1164302" wikidata="Q3808871" url="?curid=1164302" title="Death of Jeremiah Duggan">
<text>Jeremiah Joseph Duggan (10 November 1980 – 27 March 2003) was a British student in Paris who died during a visit to Wiesbaden, Hesse, Germany, after being struck by several motorists on a dual carriageway. The circumstances of Duggan&#x27;s death became a matter of dispute because, at the time he died, he was attending a youth &quot;cadre&quot; school organised by the LaRouche movement, an international network led by the American political activist Lyndon LaRouche.

German police concluded that Duggan had committed suicide after running several kilometres (miles) from the apartment in which he had been staying, then jumping in front of early-morning traffic. A British coroner rejected a suicide verdict in 2003 after hearing the London Metropolitan Police describe the LaRouche movement as a political cult. Duggan telephoned his mother, Erica Duggan, fifty minutes before he died, apparently distressed about his involvement in it.

Arguing that German police had not investigated the case thoroughly, Erica Duggan commissioned forensic reports which suggested the car crash might have been staged and that Duggan had died elsewhere. After protracted litigation in the UK and Germany, the High Court in London ordered a second inquest in 2010, and in 2012 the Frankfurt Higher Regional Court ordered the Wiesbaden police to reopen their investigation. In 2015 the coroner upheld that Duggan had been killed in the accident, but rejected a suicide verdict, adding that unexplained injuries suggested an &quot;altercation at some stage before his death.&quot;

The LaRouche movement attributed criticism of its involvement in the case to LaRouche&#x27;s political opponents, including former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and former US Vice President Dick Cheney, who they say sought to discredit LaRouche over his opposition to the 2003 Iraq War and his criticism of the scientific consensus on anthropogenic global warming.

==Background==
===Duggan family===
Jeremiah Duggan was born in North London to Erica Duggan, a Jewish schoolteacher from South Africa; and her husband, Hugo Duggan, who was raised in Ireland. Erica&#x27;s father left Berlin in 1933; many family members were killed during the Holocaust. Erica, in turn, left South Africa due to &quot;apartheid&quot;. She, Hugo, Jeremiah and his two older sisters made their home in the London suburb of Golders Green. Duggan&#x27;s parents divorced when he was aged 7.

Duggan attended Fitzjohn&#x27;s Primary School in Hampstead, Quainton School for Boys, and won a scholarship to Christ&#x27;s Hospital school in Sussex as a boarder. After his A-levels, he spent time in India then trained in Israel as a youth leader. Duggan was interested in the arts, music and the theatre, and in 2001 moved to Paris to study French at the British Institute and English at the Sorbonne. Duggan&#x27;s mother said he became interested in politics after 9/11; his strong opposition to the Iraq War led him to become involved with the LaRouche movement.

===LaRouche movement===

Lyndon LaRouche and his German wife, Helga Zepp-LaRouche, ran a global political network of publications, committees and a youth cadre based in Leesburg, Virginia, United States, and in Wiesbaden, Hesse, Germany. The movement in Germany is represented by the Schiller Institute and the &quot;Bürgerrechtsbewegung Solidarität&quot; party. LaRouche stood as a presidential candidate in the US eight times between 1976 and 2004. He was jailed in 1989 for conspiracy to commit fraud, a prosecution he claimed was politically motivated.

From the 1970s the movement became associated with the promotion of conspiracy theories, and at times with the use of violence against opponents, the fraudulent use of donations, and antisemitism. There was criticism of its recruitment methods; according to &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, recruits were isolated from their families, encouraged to give up their studies, and subjected to intense verbal pressure before being asked to accept the LaRouche worldview. Members said the allegations were misrepresentations, and LaRouche strongly denied the charge of antisemitism.

LaRouche was particularly critical of Britain and of the Tavistock Institute in London, a psychotherapy and social sciences charity that the movement associated with British intelligence. In 1999 a LaRouche publication claimed Britain&#x27;s Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) was threatening to assassinate LaRouche, probably with backing from the British royal family. Duggan&#x27;s family came to believe that this worldview affected the movement&#x27;s perception of Duggan when the conference participants learned that he was a British Jew who, as a child, had attended the Tavistock Clinic for counselling when his parents divorced.

==Duggan&#x27;s involvement with the movement==
=== &quot;Nouvelle Solidarité&quot; ===

Duggan&#x27;s first contact with the LaRouche movement was in Paris in January 2003, when he bought a copy of the LaRouche French-language newspaper, &quot;Nouvelle Solidarité&quot;, from a booth near the British Institute, outside the Invalides station on the Paris Métro. The man who sold him the paper was Benoit Chalifoux, a writer for the newspaper and one of the movement&#x27;s &quot;organizers&quot;, or recruiters.

Duggan was strongly opposed to the Iraq War, as were Chalifoux and his group of friends from the LaRouche movement. Protests were taking place worldwide in the weeks leading up to the invasion of Iraq on 20 March 2003. Duggan began seeing more of Chalifoux&#x27;s group and was invited to attend a Schiller Institute conference near Wiesbaden, the LaRouche movement&#x27;s European headquarters. Duggan and his parents assumed it was an anti-war conference. His mother searched for material about LaRouche on the web in vain; possibly she or her son misspelled the name as &quot;Laroche.&quot;

===Conference===
Duggan and Chalifoux travelled to Wiesbaden on 21 March with eight other men. Duggan stayed in a youth hostel at first, then with two other recruits in an apartment belonging to two Schiller Institute managers.

The conference, &quot;How to Reconstruct a Bankrupt World,&quot; was held in Bad Schwalbach, near Wiesbaden, from 21 to 23 March. LaRouche was the keynote speaker, with a speech entitled &quot;Physical Geometry as Strategy.&quot; According to April Witt in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, he told the audience that US President George W. Bush was an unreformed drunk (he is a teetotaler), Woodrow Wilson had founded the Ku Klux Klan from the White House, John F. Kennedy was killed by a domestic American operation, and the US was using the war in Iraq to &quot;ignite catastrophic global warfare.&quot; The plot to launch a world war was being influenced, he said, by people who &quot;like Hitler, admire Nietzsche, but being Jewish ... couldn&#x27;t qualify for Nazi Party leadership, even though their fascism was absolutely pure! As extreme as Hitler! They sent them to the United States.&quot; The people behind the plot were the &quot;independent central-banking-system crowd, the slime-mold,&quot; he said, the same people who had brought Hitler to power in the 1930s.

===Youth cadre school===
After the conference, Duggan attended a LaRouche Youth Movement cadre school in Wiesbaden with 60–70 others. Chalifoux, the recruiter who had accompanied him to Germany, returned to Paris. According to another potential recruit, there were hours of lectures, seminars and one-on-one meetings every day, as well as chanting and singing.

Duggan reportedly stood out because he was British and Jewish. A document from the Metropolitan Police, submitted to the first inquest, said the Schiller Institute and LaRouche Youth Movement blamed the Jewish people for the Iraq war and other global issues, and that &quot;Jeremiah&#x27;s lecture notes and bulletins showed the anti-Semitic nature of [the] ideology.&quot; According to Duggan&#x27;s mother, the Schiller Institute&#x27;s scientific adviser, Jonathan Tennenbaum, told her that when Duggan heard the Jews being blamed for the war during a seminar, he had stood up and said, &quot;But I&#x27;m a Jew!&quot; One participant said the others put him &quot;through the wringer&quot; because of it.

According to Witt, Duggan may have been placed under further pressure because he told the others he had attended the Tavistock Clinic as a child for counselling when his parents divorced. Duggan&#x27;s conference notes showed that someone at the conference referred to the Tavistock as a &quot;brainwashing&quot; centre.

==Incident==
===Visit to Frankfurt===

Duggan and his French girlfriend had planned to meet in Paris on Tuesday, 25 March. Instead he called her that day, two days before his death, to say he had no money for the fare home and was unable to get a ride until Sunday. He told her &quot;very serious things&quot; were happening and that he would explain when he returned.

On 26 March, Duggan accompanied LaRouche members to Frankfurt to hand out LaRouche literature in the streets, then to see the Rembrandt collection at the Städel museum. When one member asked what he thought of the artwork, he started crying. The woman invited him to step outside for some air. Duggan kept repeating that he did not trust LaRouche and said he wanted to go back to England. She told him he was free to leave and could phone her if he wanted to, which seemed to reassure him. She last saw him with one of his roommates sitting on the steps of the museum around 8:30 pm.

===Duggan&#x27;s telephone calls===
One of the Schiller Institute managers in whose apartment Duggan was staying told &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; that he and his roommate returned to the house around midnight. They had no key so the manager opened the door for them. According to the roommate (speaking after Duggan&#x27;s death to his girlfriend), Duggan could not sleep and kept switching the lights on and off. He repeated that he was unable to trust LaRouche and felt trapped.

At around 4:20 am—by now Thursday, 27 March—Duggan called his girlfriend on the roommate&#x27;s mobile phone. She said he was speaking very quietly; sounded agitated and confused; complained that he no longer knew what was true and real; and that someone was conducting experiments with computers and magnetic waves, perhaps on him. She asked him to take a train to Paris in the morning. According to the roommate, Duggan then telephoned his mother, after which he ran out of the house. Mrs. Duggan said the first call came at 5:24 am German time (4:24 am in the UK):

And he said, &quot;Mum, I&#x27;m in ... big trouble ... You know this &quot;Nouvelle Solidarité&quot;?&quot; ... He said, &quot;I can&#x27;t do this ... I want out.&quot; And at that point the phone was cut. And then it rang back again almost immediately. And the first thing that he said that time was, &quot;Mum, I&#x27;m frightened.&quot; I realised he was in such danger that I said to him, &quot;I love you.&quot; And then he said, &quot;I want to see you &quot;now&quot;.&quot; ... I said, &quot;Well, where are you, Jerry?&quot; He said, &quot;Wiesbaden.&quot; And I said, &quot;How do you spell it?&quot; And he said, &quot;W-I-E-S.&quot; And then the phone was cut.

After the calls, according to the roommate, Duggan asked, &quot;Why did you choose me?&quot; and said he wanted to go out for a cigarette. The roommate went too but pressed a doorbell by accident while looking for the light switch at the bottom of the stairs; he said this appeared to make Duggan panic and he ran off. He said he ran after Duggan briefly before going back to the apartment.

===Death===
Just over thirty minutes later, at about 6:00 am, two drivers heading into Wiesbaden town centre saw a man run toward them on the Berliner Straße (Bundesstraße 455), a four-lane dual carriageway. The spot, near an Aral garage, was around five kilometres (c. three miles) from the apartment in which Duggan had been staying, and not far from the LaRouche offices in the Wiesbaden suburb of Erbenheim. One of the drivers said Duggan ran toward him with outstretched arms. The car, a BMW, clipped him with the wing mirror. He appears to have fallen, but got up and continued running toward the traffic that was heading into town. Both drivers reported the incidents to police.

At 6:14 am, as the police were taking details, they were told that a man had run into a red Peugeot further ahead on the same road. The driver saw Duggan move onto the road in front of him. The driver swerved from the inside lane to the outside, but the driver said Duggan leapt in front of the car, arms raised and mouth open. The driver hit him, denting the passenger door and shattering the passenger window and windscreen, and throwing Duggan into the path of a blue Volkswagen Golf, which ran over him. He was certified dead at the scene at 6:35 am.

The view of the German police was that Duggan had arrived at that stretch of road after running 5 km (3 miles) from the apartment. Duggan&#x27;s family complained that the police had failed to establish that. Other allegations included that he had spent the night at the nearby LaRouche offices and ran from there to the road, and that he had run onto the road from a car. Forensic reports commissioned by Erica Duggan suggested that he may have died elsewhere and been moved onto the road after the fact, a position the coroner rejected in 2015.

===Early response===
Within minutes of Duggan&#x27;s second telephone, Erica contacted the British emergency services and was advised to call her local police station in Colindale, Barnet. She told them she believed her son was in danger. They transferred her to the Metropolitan Police at Scotland Yard, but when she explained he had become involved with &quot;Nouvelle Solidarité&quot; they had no idea what she meant.

At 7:40 am Duggan&#x27;s roommate telephoned his girlfriend in Paris to ask if she had heard from him; he said Duggan had left the apartment and had not returned. At around 11 am Erica rang the roommate&#x27;s mobile phone; because he did not speak English, he passed it to a Schiller Institute manager. The manager reportedly told her the group was a news agency, adding, &quot;We cannot take responsibility for the actions of individuals. We think your son has psychological problems.&quot; She said she would call the local hospitals to see whether Duggan had been admitted. Shortly after this, the manager and Duggan&#x27;s roommate, along with another member, handed his passport, bag and rucksack to the Wiesbaden police station.

The manager told &quot;The Independent&quot;: &quot;I believed he had psychological problems, based on the conversations he had with people. I don&#x27;t know what happened on the night he died, but the Schiller Institute played no part in his death.&quot; The police report stated that the manager told them Erica had called &quot;since he had severe asthma and was not getting in touch with her.&quot; Later Erica said her son had not had asthma since childhood.

According to one of those present, around 25 members of the movement were asked to assemble in the local LaRouche office that morning, in a meeting attended by Helga Zepp-LaRouche. They were told that Duggan had killed himself. A LaRouche recruiter from Paris told the meeting that Duggan had been to the Tavistock Clinic, apparently giving the impression that he had been there recently. Zepp-LaRouche reportedly said that Duggan might have been sent from London to harm LaRouche.

==Inquiries==
===First German investigation===
Wiesbaden police reportedly concluded within three hours that Duggan committed suicide. LaRouche officials were said to have told police that Duggan had been a patient at the Tavistock Clinic and had suffered from &quot;suicidal impulses.&quot; That view of him shaped the rest of the inquiry, according to &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;.

An emergency doctor gave the cause of death as &quot;open, cranio-cerebral trauma following traffic accident,&quot; injuries that he said were consistent with the accident as described by the drivers. The accident investigator noted marks on Duggan&#x27;s clothes consistent with having been in contact with the underside of a vehicle. The braking had left marks on the road; Duggan was lying about 23 metres (25 yards) beyond the point of impact. The investigator took 79 photographs of the scene, although the cars were moved before he arrived.

German authorities did not conduct an autopsy because the cause of death had been established and there was no evidence of foul play. His clothes were not returned to his family and were assumed to have been destroyed. The police took no formal witness statements. Witness evidence was recorded as &quot;brief, sometimes contradictory, notes,&quot; according to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. Nothing suggested that the drivers had any connection to the LaRouche movement or Duggan. The Wiesbaden public prosecutor closed the case after three months. In 2004 he told the BBC:

We are 100 percent certain that it is suicide, suicide as we call it, that as a consequence of his own behaviour, and with no one else involved, he threw himself in front of a car, of several cars, and died on the third attempt.

Under German law, Arlett said that he could investigate further only if there existed &quot;concrete evidence of third-party involvement,&quot; and there was none; the Schiller Institute had been mentioned in connection with the death only because Duggan had attended an event of theirs. Officials maintained the same position in 2007 and 2009.

===First British inquest===
Duggan&#x27;s body was flown back to England on 31 March 2003, where a non-forensic post-mortem examination was conducted on 4 April by pathologist David Shove. Shove found head injuries, bruising on the backs of the arms and hands, blood in the lungs and stomach, and a full bladder. A blood sample showed no drugs or alcohol.

Shove was not called to attend the inquest, which took place in November 2003. Robert Hawthorne, an accident investigator, told the court that Duggan may only have appeared to leap in front of the cars: &quot;The drivers may have perceived that he leapt when in actual fact he was either running to clear the cars or what they saw was the post-impact movement of Jeremiah as he was flung around.&quot; The court heard testimony about the conference Duggan had attended. A Metropolitan Police memo was entered as evidence: &quot;The Schiller Institute and the LaRouche Youth Movement ... blames the Jewish people for the Iraq war and all the other problems in the world. Jeremiah&#x27;s lecture notes and bulletins showed the anti-Semitic nature of [the] ideology.&quot; The coroner, Dr. William Dolman, delivered a narrative verdict:

Jeremiah Joseph Duggan received fatal head injuries when he ran into the road in Wiesbaden and was hit by two private motor cars. What other fact do we know that I must add? I really must add that he had earlier been in a state of terror. It is a word not commonly used in a Coroner&#x27;s court but no other word would reflect his state of mind at the time.

===Private forensic reviews===
Erica Duggan set up the &quot;Justice for Jeremiah&quot; campaign in April 2004 with legal support from the British Foreign Office. In 2005 she hand-delivered a list of questions to Shove, the pathologist who had performed the autopsy. When she showed him Duggan&#x27;s autopsy report, he allegedly replied that Duggan had been &quot;severely beaten around the head&quot; and said he had not realised it had been a traffic accident. Shove declined to sign a statement to that effect and apparently could not be located for the second inquest.

Six forensic experts hired by Erica examined Shove&#x27;s autopsy report and photographs taken by accident investigators in Wiesbaden. A forensic pathologist suggested that bruises on Duggan&#x27;s hands and arms were defensive injuries. Paul Canning, a forensic photographer formerly with the Metropolitan Police, and Alan Bayle, a forensic scientist, suggested that Duggan may have died elsewhere and been placed at the scene. Bayle argued that the Peugeot windscreen had been hit with a crowbar or a similar instrument, while Canning wrote that he found nothing to suggest that the cars had made contact with Duggan. Two other forensic experts expressed similar views.

Those views were challenged during a High Court hearing in 2008 regarding the application for a new inquest. Contrary to the claim that there was no sign that Duggan had come into contact with the cars, there were &quot;traces on the underside of the Golf,&quot; according to Cecilia Ivimy on behalf of the Attorney General. She described the argument that the accident had been staged as requiring someone to have inflicted head injuries after the phone call to Erica, placed Duggan on the road, inflicted damage to two cars, scattered debris, and created skid marks, all without attracting attention. In 2010 the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany called the allegations outlandish. The &quot;Wiesbadener Kurier&quot; criticised what it saw as the defamation of &quot;two completely innocent motorists.&quot;

===Second British inquest===

Relying on the forensic reviews, Erica applied in May 2007 for a new inquest. A cross-party group of MPs signed an early day motion that month calling on the Attorney General to support the application. After protracted legal action by Erica, the High Court ordered the new inquest in May 2010.

The inquest took place over three days in May 2015 at North London Coroner&#x27;s Court before the coroner Andrew Walker. Walker rejected the view that the accident had been staged, calling it implausible. The court heard from Catherine Picard, a French expert on cults, that Duggan might have experienced &quot;intense pressure and psychological violence&quot; at the conference, including one-on-one sessions, hours of lectures, and &quot;being subjected to repeated conspiracy theories and antisemitic discourse.&quot; Matthew Feldman, a historian at Teesside University and expert on the far right, testified that, if other participants had learned that Duggan was Jewish, British and had attended the Tavistock Clinic, &quot;it would have been taken very seriously by the movement.&quot; Walker delivered a narrative verdict:

 ... Jeremiah Duggan received fatal injuries following a collision with two cars on the Berliner Strasse and died in a road traffic collision. ... There are a number of unexplained injuries that suggest that Mr. Duggan may have been involved in an altercation at some stage before his death.

He added that Duggan&#x27;s attendance at the conference, the methods used to recruit young people, Duggan having expressed that he was a Jew and British, and questioning what he was being told &quot;may have had a bearing on Mr. Duggan&#x27;s death in the sense that it may have put him at risk from members of the organization and caused Mr. Duggan to become distressed and seek to leave.&quot; He said that he &quot;totally reject[ed] that this was a suicide.&quot;

===Second German investigation===

Duggan&#x27;s family appealed unsuccessfully in 2006 to the Higher Regional Court (&quot;Oberlandesgericht&quot;) in Frankfurt regarding the decision to close the German police investigation. Their appeal against that decision was rejected by Germany&#x27;s Federal Constitutional Court in 2010.
A second appeal to the &quot;Oberlandesgericht&quot; succeeded in 2012. In what the &quot;Berliner Zeitung&quot; described as an extremely unusual decision, the court ordered the Wiesbaden prosecutor to re-open the inquiry. The court said that a pedestrian leaving the LaRouche offices in Wiesbaden, in the direction of the town centre, would have reached exactly that junction in the Berliner Straße, and &quot;would have had to cross the four-lane road if he did not want or was unable to turn back.&quot;

The new investigation opened in April 2013. As of 2015, prosecutors were reportedly investigating allegations against two individuals, one German, one French, on suspicion of causing bodily harm resulting in death. Erica criticised the appointment of the same police officer who had presided over the case in 2003, accusing the German authorities of &quot;institutional racism&quot; akin to that of the Stephen Lawrence murder inquiry. In 2014 the Board of Deputies of British Jews asked Chancellor Angela Merkel to arrange an independent investigation, and in 2015 asked the British Foreign Secretary to raise the issue with the German government.

==LaRouche response==

In 2006 LaRouche issued a statement saying the allegations were a hoax stemming from a campaign orchestrated by Dick Cheney, then Vice President of the United States, and Cheney&#x27;s wife Lynne. In 2007 the LaRouche movement published a letter from the Metropolitan Police, dated 14 July 2003, that it said was obtained under the British Freedom of Information Act, in which an officer wrote that he had been assured the case had been fully investigated in Germany.

The Schiller Institute issued a statement in 2007: &quot;The Schiller Institute has always maintained that it had no involvement whatsoever in Jeremiah&#x27;s death, and has expressed its sympathy to the Duggan family.&quot; In 2015 a spokesperson told &quot;Newsweek&quot; that the allegations were &quot;utterly preposterous&quot;:

At no time has Ms Duggan ever presented any evidence or facts that refute the findings of the German authorities concerning the suicide of her son. Instead, over the last 12 years she and her representatives and collaborators have propounded wild conspiracies theories promulgated by the political enemies of Mr LaRouche in and around the British Monarchy and the circles of the now discredited former prime minister Tony Blair.

<text>WRBS-FM (95.1 MHz, &quot;Bright-FM&quot;) is a radio station in Baltimore, Maryland, serving the Baltimore metropolitan area. The station broadcasts a Christian adult contemporary radio format and is owned by Peter &amp; John Radio Fellowship, Inc.

WRBS-FM has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 50,000 watts, the maximum permitted for non-grandfathered FM stations in this region. Its studios and transmitter are co-located off Commerce Drive near Interstate 95 in Halethorpe, Maryland, using a Baltimore address. WRBS-FM broadcasts using HD Radio technology. The HD2 digital subchannel broadcasts the Christian talk and teaching programs formerly heard on WRBS (1230 AM), and is still branded &quot;WRBS-AM&quot;.

==History==
===Peter &amp; John Fellowship===
In 1948, three young ministers Peter and John Bisset, and Paul Plack, created &quot;The Peter, Paul and John Broadcast&quot; to reach non-church goers during the week on WFBR (1300 AM), then one of Baltimore&#x27;s most popular radio stations. The Bisset&#x27;s were the youngest of five brothers whose family had emigrated from Scotland. Paul Plack was a singer who had met the brothers during his evangelistic tours.

Paul left the broadcast in 1952, and the program was renamed &quot;The Peter and John Broadcast&quot;. The brothers continued to host the show until Peter&#x27;s sudden death of a heart attack in 1995.

===WRBS early years===
On June 30, 1960, the station first signed on the air. It was owned by John B. Reynolds, who served as the general manager and commercial manager. The call sign WRBS was chosen to represent Reynolds Broadcasting Service.

At the time, it carried a classical music format, when few people owned FM receivers. It did not have an FM suffix because Reynolds did not own an AM sister station. The FM station stood alone.

===Christian radio===
In 1964, Peter &amp; John Radio Fellowship acquired WRBS. The brothers upgraded WRBS&#x27;s facilities in 1972. The station increased power to 50,000 watts, from 20,000 watts. It began broadcasting 24 hours daily coupled with a move from East Cold Spring Lane in Baltimore to its present site at 3500 Commerce Drive.

In 2006, Peter and John Radio Fellowship, Inc., acquired a Baltimore AM radio station, the former WITH (1230 AM) and changed its call sign to WRBS. The FM station is now licensed under the call letters WRBS-FM, using the FM suffix to distinguish it from the AM station. WRBS (AM) was sold in 2024 and is now WFOA; its previous programming remains on the second HD Radio channel of WRBS-FM.
In August 2009, WRBS-FM was re-branded to feature contemporary Christian music, and began calling itself &quot;95.1 Shine FM&quot;. On May 2, 2022, WRBS-FM rebranded as &quot;Bright-FM,&quot; after Olivet Nazarene University withdrew its license to use the &quot;Shine FM&quot; name.

On February 11, 2023, WRBS-FM began rebroadcasting on the 103.1 FM frequency previously occupied by Adult album alternative station WRNR-FM, which it brought from them back in November. After the switch, its calls was changed to WRHS, with the station&#x27;s city of license of Grasonville being retained.

<text>Exhibition drill is a variant of drill that involves complex marching sequences which usually deviate from drill used in the course of ordinary parades. Teams performing exhibition drill are often affiliated with military units, but the scope of exhibition drill is not limited to military drill teams. Exhibition drill is often performed by Armed Forces Precision Drill Teams, the drill teams at service academies and ROTC and JROTC units, and civilian drill teams that perform at parades, drill meets, and half-time shows and other public venues.

==History of rifle exhibition drill==
The first documented performance of exhibition drill was performed by Hadji Cheriff and filmed at what is believed to be the Midway Plaisance of the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. The film was later copyrighted by Thomas Edison in 1899, entitled &quot;The Arabian Gun Twirler&quot;.

The performance demonstrates aerial (two ) and over-the-shoulder techniques, and 

It is believed that the weapon was a .577 caliber, triple band 1853 Enfield Musket, which is 56&quot; long and weighs about 9.5 pounds and thus is 13&quot; longer and heavier than most drill weapons used today.

== Exhibition drill in competition ==
Exhibition drill is one of many different drill phases that are a part of a drill meet. Other phases include Inspection, Color Guard and Regulation Drill.

Exhibition military drill has grown drastically in popularity in recent decades. This growth can be attributed to several primary factors. These include:

* The expansion of Junior ROTC programs through the four primary service branches that occurred in the early and mid 1980s took the total number of units from roughly 1,600 to well over 2,500 in the U.S. This provided more cadets the opportunity to be a part of these exhibition drill teams. 
* The work of Sports Network International (SNI) produced military drill and ceremony competitions on a scale that had never previously been seen. 
* From these numerous competitions, SNI produced magazines and websites to feature this activity. SNI also produced training and entertainment videos devoted exclusively to featuring many of the military exhibition drill teams in the country. These videos allowed the talent and creativity involved in exhibition drill at the highest levels to travel and expand at a greater rate, helping to promote the sport.

General rules and guidelines

Rules of exhibition drill during competitions vary, but most of them apply the following guidelines:

Time – There is usually a minimum and maximum time a routine may take. Points are deducted if a team is under or over time.

Boundaries – Teams should be aware of their boundary lines, and if necessary, alter their routines as to not cross the boundary lines. Points are deducted if a person crosses a boundary line.

Some high-school level competitions prevent cadets who are participating in armed drill events from performing more dangerous &#x27;over the head&#x27; spins, or raising cadets off the floor, in the interest of safety.

===High school===
Some high school drill teams compete at the National High School Drill Team Championships in Daytona Beach, Florida, and generally use demilitarized Springfield M1903s, M1 Garands, M-14 rifles and Daisy Drill Rifles. There are also national drill level competitions for JROTC divisions, including Navy JROTC, Army JROTC, Marine Corps JROTC, and Air Force JROTC. Other countries have their own drill team competitions for teenagers.

===Unarmed===
In an unarmed division, exhibition drill may consist of intricate precision marching, along with various hand movements. Modified step team routines are used in some competitions.

===Post High School===
In addition to the National High School Drill Team Championships, SNI also hosts the World Drill Championships in Daytona Beach, Florida. This event is for competitors who are 18 and have graduated from high school and open to competitors worldwide. 

Past WDC Champions 
==College ROTC drill teams==
Colleges with Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (ROTC) units, as well as military academies, have drill teams normally train and compete in two types of drill events: Regulation/Close Order and Exhibition (Trick or Fancy) Drill. Regulation Drill is conducted in accordance with Field Manual 22-5 (now FM 3-21.5) Drill and Ceremonies. Exhibition Drill is more free form and often more elaborate than Regulation Drill. Exhibition Drill teams are also more colorful in uniform and weaponry. In both types of event, participants are typically armed with weapons made safe or inert by removal of firing pins. Armament is totally devoid of all firing mechanisms for the safety of participants and audience alike.

*Pershing Rifles, founded in 1894, is the oldest continuously operating college organization dedicated to military drill. The original drill team created by John J. Pershing had a simple goal: to serve as an example for the cadets at the University of Nebraska, who were sorely lacking in esprit de corps, motivation, and basic military skills. A typical unit performs as a color guard, exhibition drill team, honor guard, funeral detail, or any other ceremonial unit requested; these services are usually at the request of the local ROTC detachment or school, but are sometimes requested by alumni, local governments, or active duty military units. Pershing Rifles hosts a National Drill Competition each spring which attracts some of the finest college level drill teams in the nation.
*The Blue Ridge Rifles, established in 1950, is the military precision drill team of the Corps of Cadets at the University of North Georgia (formerly North Georgia College and North Georgia College and State University), which is designated as the Military College of Georgia and one of six United States senior military colleges. Today, the Blue Ridge Rifles perform year-round for the University of North Georgia, high schools, parades, and sporting events. The also conduct 21 gun salutes and flag folding for military and police honors and funerals, and they compete in intercollegiate drill meets such as the Mardi Gras Invitational Drill Meet in New Orleans, Louisiana.
*Gator Guard Drill Team is a precision drill team and military fraternity based at the University of Florida. It is named after the Florida Gators, the mascot of the University of Florida. Founded in 1953, the Gator Guard absorbed and succeeded the University of Florida&#x27;s Army ROTC chapter of the Pershing Rifles upon its inception. The Gator Guard performs annually at the university&#x27;s Homecoming Parade, as well as the Krewe of Mid-City and King Rex parades at the New Orleans Mardi Gras. The team uses M1903 rifles with 8-inch bayonets for all performances. The Gator Guard also performs color guard ceremonies for the University of Florida, the SEC, and the MLB.

<text>The University of Toronto Students&#x27; Union (UTSU), legally named the Students&#x27; Administrative Council of the University of Toronto, Inc., serves as the elected representative body for full-time undergraduate students at the University of Toronto&#x27;s St. George campus. It holds the distinction of being the second-largest student union in Canada and the third-largest in North America.

==History==
The student government at the University of Toronto has undergone several transformations throughout its history. It originated as the University of Toronto Union in 1901 and later became the Parliament of the Undergraduates in 1907. However, low attendance from elected members, particularly from the medical school, led to the executive assuming more responsibilities over time. In 1913, the Parliament was replaced by the Students&#x27; Administrative Council, initially composed of male students. In 1916, the Women&#x27;s Students&#x27; Administrative Council was established, and in 1919, the two councils merged to form a Joint Executive. In 1931, the separate councils were abolished, and the Joint Executive became the primary governing body. The name was later simplified to &quot;Students&#x27; Administrative Council&quot; in 1935–1936. On November 16, 2006, a general meeting of University of Toronto students resulted in a name change to the University of Toronto Students&#x27; Union.

The UTSU&#x27;s authority and responsibilities were defined by Section 34 of the University of Toronto Act, 1947, until 1971. Initially, the offices of the Students&#x27; Administrative Council were located in Hart House. They later moved to the Louis B. Stewart Observatory at the heart of Hart House Circle, adjacent to the Hart House building. Currently, the UTSU&#x27;s offices are situated at the Student Commons, located at 230 College Street. The Student Commons, which opened in 2021.

==Governance==
The union operates under the governance of a Board of Directors, which consists of elected representatives from the federated and constituent colleges, as well as professional faculties within the university. 

The Board of Directors delegated many of its responsibilities to various committees, each focusing on specific areas of concern. These committees include Equity and Accessibility, Campaigns and Outreach, Clubs, Elections and Referenda, Finance, Governance, Services, Student Aid, and the Executive Committee. Composed of board members, these committees address operational, service-related, and campaign-specific matters. The outcomes of committee work are presented to the entire Board of Directors for final approval.

Full-time undergraduate students enrolled at the St. George campus have the opportunity to seek funding from the UTSU for grassroots-oriented advocacy initiatives taking place on campus. This funding is made available through UTSU&#x27;s &quot;Campus Initiatives Policy&quot;, allowing students to drive and support initiatives that align with their interests.

===Federated structure===
In April 2013, the Engineering Society (EngSoc), a federated body of UTSU, held a student vote to pursue separation from UTSU. This decision followed a period of tension between EngSoc and UTSU. After several years of negotiations, UTSU and EngSoc reached an agreement. As part of the agreement, UTSU recognized EngSoc as the primary student government representing engineering students. Additionally, UTSU ensured that half of all UTSU levies would be allocated to EngSoc, and EngSoc became the primary provider of student services for engineering students. In return, EngSoc agreed not to pursue defederation.

==Elections==
Historically, voter turnout in UTSU elections has been consistently low for several years. More recently, there was a slight increase in turnout, reaching approximately 15%. However, due to the controversy surrounding the 2010 elections, the turnout dropped back down to 6%. In the 2020 elections, there was a notable increase in voter turnout, with 12.7% of eligible students participating, which marked a significant improvement compared to the 4.2% turnout in the 2019 elections.

==Services==
The UTSU offers a range of student services aimed at supporting student needs. These services include the UTSU Food Bank, funding and resources for UTSU-recognized clubs, as well as a Student Aid Program that provides bursaries to cover various expenses such as transit, accessibility-related costs, and textbooks. Additionally, UTSU administers a Health and Dental Plan, which provides health and dental insurance to UTSU members.

==Canadian Federation of Students affiliation== 
In November 2002, UTSU members participated in a vote regarding their membership in the Canadian Federation of Students (CFS). The outcome of the vote indicated that 65% of the participating members supported becoming members of the CFS.

In 2016, a movement known as You Decide UofT initiated a petition to hold a referendum on the UTSU&#x27;s membership in the CFS. A few months later, four out of the seven UTSU executives publicly endorsed the campaign and called for the termination of UTSU&#x27;s CFS membership. During the 2017 UTSU elections, the Demand Better slate, which advocated for leaving the CFS, achieved victory in most of the executive positions, including the presidency.

==Stances==

Flat Fees

In 2009, the University of Toronto made changes to its fee structure for students in the Faculty of Arts and Science. Instead of per-course fees, a flat fee system was implemented, requiring students to pay for five courses regardless of the number of courses taken. This resulted in a 66% increase in tuition fees without corresponding service improvements.

The UTSU has been actively opposing the flat fee structure since its announcement in 2009. Students have faced challenges in balancing part-time employment with their studies due to the inability to reduce their course load under this fee system. The flat fee structure has also added financial burdens for students, exacerbating concerns about mental health. Over the years, the UTSU has launched a robust campaign to address this issue, including petitions, protests, and garnering support from alumni who initiated a letter-writing campaign against flat fees. The UTSU also engaged at the provincial level through the Canadian Federation of Students-Ontario, advocating for changes to the fee-collection model and raising awareness among students across the province.

In 2013, the UTSU intensified its campaign by collecting over 6,000 postcard petitions from students, urging the government to take action on flat fees. These petitions were delivered to the Minister of Training, Colleges, and Universities, Brad Duguid. In December 2013, the provincial government announced new legislation to limit the fees universities can charge. Under the new policy, full tuition fees can only be charged if students are enrolled in an 80% course load or higher. This change will result in reduced tuition fees for some students by over $2300 per year, with the implementation taking place gradually over two years starting in fall 2015.

The UTSU has also been actively involved in other advocacy efforts, including opposing the University&#x27;s license agreement with Access Copyright, securing rights for unpaid interns, eliminating the need for work permits for international students, promoting open-source software, addressing ancillary fees, establishing multi-faith space, achieving a bottled water-free campus, ensuring student access to athletic space, advocating for a student Metropass, obtaining national grants, establishing childcare facilities at the University of Toronto Mississauga, advocating for a tuition fee freeze, promoting a sweatshop-free campus, divesting from South African apartheid, establishing the Centre for Women &amp; Trans People, and securing undergrad access to Robarts Library.

==Criticisms and controversy==
Historical criticisms

UTSU and its predecessor body, SAC, have faced criticism throughout their history. One early instance of criticism arose from SAC&#x27;s policy, established in 1926, of refraining from involvement in political issues to maintain campus unity. This policy extended to The Varsity newspaper, which was under SAC&#x27;s publication. In 1929 and 1931, SAC dismissed editors who published unpopular opinions. In the mid-1930s, SAC faced criticism for not supporting anti-war and pro-peace advocates on campus, as SAC deemed these groups of limited interest. In 1946, SAC drew campus criticism for not endorsing efforts to prevent the deportation of Japanese Canadians. Anti-racist advocates also expressed disappointment with SAC&#x27;s lack of support for this cause during the 1940s.

However, in the 1960s, the criticism began to shift as the student council adopted a more activist agenda. A notable example occurred in 1972, when the Medical Society conducted a successful referendum to withdraw from SAC. Administrative delays prevented the withdrawal from taking effect.

Controversial public positions

The UTSU has faced criticism regarding its public positions on equity and racial issues on campus, as well as its involvement in campaigns related to global issues such as the Sri Lankan conflict or the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and federal issues like the Aboriginal movement Idle No More. Some of these criticisms have been raised by members of provincial and federal political parties, including both the Liberals and Conservatives, who have questioned the democratic legitimacy of UTSU.

2007 CFS campaign allegations

The UTSU has faced criticism for its affiliation with the Canadian Federation of Students (CFS), with allegations of interference in student union elections at other schools in the Greater Toronto Area. Former S.A.C. Vice President Sam Rahimi (2004–2005) has stated that he was asked multiple times to participate in election campaigns at Ryerson and York Universities and that he and other student leaders from S.A.C. were brought to these schools during election periods to support C.F.S.-friendly slates. The Canadian Federation of Students has denied these claims.

2008 threats of legal action

The UTSU has been involved in controversies where they have faced accusations of suppressing dissenting voices from students who hold different views than the union. In a recent referendum concerning the construction of a Student Commons Building, which was proposed to be entirely funded and managed by students (rather than relying on private donations and joint administration-student management), The UTSU was accused of targeting students who were perceived to be campaigning against the union. The union&#x27;s president at that time even threatened legal action against a student who had been putting up posters questioning the UTSU&#x27;s handling of the student commons issue.

2012 lecture protests

In November 2012, a protest took place against guest lecturer Warren Farrell during an event organized by the Canadian Association for Equality. Approximately fifteen protesters obstructed the entrance to the event, leading to a delay in the lecture. One individual was arrested but later released without charges. The UTSU arranged the protest after their request to cancel the lecture was denied by the university administration. The protest was a response to contentious excerpts from Warren Farrell&#x27;s publications and comments he made about incest in a 1977 Penthouse interview. During the protest, one feminist protester was documented repeatedly expressing the phrase &quot;You are scum&quot; to a male attendee.

2013 membership defederation

In 2013, Trinity College, Victoria College, and the Engineering Society, which are prominent divisions of the UTSU&#x27;s membership, conducted referendums to propose defederation from the Union. The referendums sought to redirect fees directly to their respective college- or faculty-based student societies instead of paying them to the union. In all three divisions, the majority of the votes favored fee diversion.

2015 election

In 2015, there was a notable shift in election outcomes when a non-incumbent opposition slate emerged victorious, securing all five executive seats and a significant portion of the board. This marked a departure from the long-standing trend of incumbent victories in previous elections.

Lawsuit against former executives and executive director

On September 24, 2015, it came to light that the UTSU had initiated legal proceedings by filing a statement of claim against the former president, the former vice president of internal and services, and the former executive director in relation to the termination of the former executive director. Subsequently, the lawsuit was resolved through a settlement between the former president and former vice president of internal and services.

<doc id="1164312" wikidata="Q1252775" url="?curid=1164312" title="Matakana Island">
<text>Matakana Island is located in the western Bay of Plenty in New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. A long, flat barrier island, it is in length but rarely more than wide. The island has been continuously populated for centuries by Māori tribes that are mostly associated with Ngāi Te Rangi. The island is one of the few majority Māori-speaking places in New Zealand, with 55.7% of the population being able to speak Māori as of the 2018 census.

The island has two distinct parts: of farm and orchard land on the inner harbour, (where most of the population lives) and of forest-covered coastal land exposed to the Pacific Ocean. A smaller island, Rangiwaea Island, is located just offshore from Matakana&#x27;s southern coast.

As of the 2018 census, the island has a population of 183 people, down from 255 people in the 2013 Census. This makes Matakana Island the third least populated area in the Western Bay of Plenty. There are only 90 inhabited dwellings. Most people living on the island belong to the Ratana Church or the Catholic Church.

==History and culture==

===Recent history===
19th Century: Of the 290,000 acres the Crown seized in the Tauranga region in 1865, 240,000 acres were returned to Maori between 1865-1886. The confiscated 50,000 acres did not include Matakana Island. Matakana Island is 15,000 acres. The 5000 acre western side of the island (farmland part) was purchased by Whitaker and Russell between 1869-1873. Whitaker and Russell then sold that 5000 acres on 2 April 1874 to the crown who then gave it back for no cost to the same Maori who had previously sold it. The coastal sand dunes of 10,000 acres were purchased by William Daldy of Auckland (1816 – 5 October 1903). A certificate of title under the Land Transfer Act 1870 was issued to Daldy on 3 August 1878. That transaction relates to the Wiakoura, Oturoa, Paretata, Omanuwhiri, Ohinetama, Wairaka, Pukekahu, Okotare and Hori Tupaea&#x27;s Pa blocks.

20th Century: Between 1993 and 1999 the ownership of Matakana Island&#x27;s forest and freehold land was in dispute. The case &quot;Arklow Investments Limited and Christopher Wingate v I.D. MacLean and others&quot;, (UKPC 51) was appealed from the New Zealand Court of Appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London.

===Marae===
Matakana Island has three marae affiliated with Ngāi Te Rangi hapū:

* Kutaroa Marae and its Tauaiti meeting house are affiliated with Ngāti Tauaiti.
* Opureora Marae and its Tuwhiwhia meeting house are affiliated with Ngāi Tuwhiwhia and Ngāti Tauaiti.
* Te Rangihouhiri or Oruarahi Marae and its Te Rangihouhiri meeting house are affiliated with Ngāi Tamawhariua.

In October 2020, the Government committed $4,871,246 from the Provincial Growth Fund to upgrade Te Rangihouhiri Marae and 11 other Ngāti Awa marae, creating 23 jobs.

There are also two marae sites on neighbouring Rangiwaea Island belonging to Ngāi Te Rangi hapū:

* Rangiwaea Marae and its meeting house, Te Haka a Te Tupere, are a meeting place for Ngāi Tauwhao.
* Oponui Marae, which was dismantled between the 1980s and 2007, was traditionally a meeting place for Te Ngare.

==Demographics==
Matakana Island covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Matakana Island had a population of 183 at the 2018 New Zealand census, a decrease of 72 people (−28.2%) since the 2013 census, and a decrease of 42 people (−18.7%) since the 2006 census. There were 78 households, comprising 87 males and 96 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.91 males per female. The median age was 40.6 years (compared with 37.4 years nationally), with 33 people (18.0%) aged under 15 years, 33 (18.0%) aged 15 to 29, 81 (44.3%) aged 30 to 64, and 36 (19.7%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 13.1% European/Pākehā, 95.1% Māori, and 1.6% Pacific peoples. People may identify with more than one ethnicity. 96.7% of the population could speak English and 55.7% could speak Māori, making it one of the most Māori-speaking places in New Zealand.

The percentage of people born overseas was 3.3, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 27.9% had no religion, 32.8% were Christian, 27.9% had Māori religious beliefs and 1.6% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 18 (12.0%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 33 (22.0%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $20,100, compared with $31,800 nationally. 6 people (4.0%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 54 (36.0%) people were employed full-time, 36 (24.0%) were part-time, and 3 (2.0%) were unemployed.

==Geography==

The island protects the entrance to the Tauranga harbour and stretches from Bowentown to Mount Maunganui. Matakana Island is largely covered with pine trees although some land is cleared for the residents. Matakana Island has a relatively small population density of 4.2, though still more than the West Coast(1.3 as of the 2006 Census). The island is the third largest by area associated with the North Island, or the fifteenth largest within New Zealand waters.The island&#x27;s long, white sandy beach is popular with surfers. Surfers can either catch a water taxi from Mount Maunganui or paddle to the island across the mouth of Tauranga Harbour (depending on weather conditions). Matakana&#x27;s surf side is a nesting site for a large number of sea birds, including the endangered New Zealand dotterel. In 2007 the New Zealand Fisheries Management Research Database recorded and estimated that there were 325 sting rays inhabiting the estuarial waters between Matakana Island and Rangiwaea Island.

=== Rangiwaea Island ===
Rangiwaea Island is off the south east coast of Matakana Island. It is low lying, over long and rises to , with low cliffs in places. Like Matakana, the land ownership history during colonisation is unclear, but confiscated land was returned in 1886. The main products on the island are kiwifruit, avocado, timber and cattle. Other nearby, smaller islands are Tahunamanu, Motungaio and Motutangaroa Islet.

==Education==

Te Kura o Te Moutere o Matakana is a co-educational Māori language immersion state primary school for Year 1 to 8 students, with a roll of as of .

<doc id="1164322" wikidata="Q332050" url="?curid=1164322" title="Tow truck">
<text>A tow truck (also called a wrecker, a breakdown truck, recovery vehicle or a breakdown lorry) is a truck used to move disabled, improperly parked, impounded, or otherwise indisposed motor vehicles. This may involve recovering a vehicle damaged in an accident, returning one to a drivable surface in a mishap or inclement weather, or towing or transporting one via flatbed to a repair shop or other location.

A tow truck is distinct from a car carrier trailer, which is used to move multiple new or used vehicles simultaneously in routine transport operations.

==History==

Ferdinand Porsche of Austro-Daimler developed an artillery tractor for the Austro-Hungarian army in 1908, the M 08. One of the batch was constructed as a recovery vehicle for the others, with a large winch on the rear platform.

The wrecker (with lifting jib) was invented in 1916 by Ernest Holmes Sr. of Chattanooga, Tennessee, a garage worker who was inspired after he needed blocks, ropes, and six men to pull a car out of a creek. After improving his design he began manufacturing them commercially. The International Towing and Recovery Hall of Fame and Museum in his home town displays restored antique wreckers, tools, equipment, and pictorial histories of motor-vehicle towing, a type of work that Holmes originated.

== Types of towing equipment ==
Five general types of tow truck are in common usage, usually based on the type or size of vehicle to be towed:

*Boom: uses an adjustable boom with a winch to recover vehicles from a ditch, over an embankment, or any place the vehicle cannot be safely reached by backing up. Some booms are fixed; some use heavy pivoting A-frames; others are equipped with hydraulic-powered telescopic cylinders. The heaviest types of boom can rotate, effectively turning the tow truck into a sort of mobile crane, called a &quot;rotator&quot;, and are usually reserved for incidents involving heavy vehicles. In the past, boom trucks used a &quot;hook and chain&quot; system where chains are looped around the vehicle frame or axle, then lifted by a boom winch. A towbar with heavy rubberized mats connects the truck and vehicle, so it can be towed on its other axle. &quot;Slings&quot; and &quot;belt lifts&quot; are a further development, with rubber straps replacing part of the chains. Slings are not used much today because they can scratch the bumpers of cars. However, they are sometimes used for towing vehicles that have been in an accident or have one or two of the front or rear wheels missing, or for pickup trucks and other vehicles that have steel bumpers. Cars equipped with all-wheel drive cannot be towed with a sling, as it can cause problems with the car&#x27;s drivetrain.
* Wheel-lift (also called a &quot;spectacle lift&quot; or &quot;underlift&quot;): developed from the hook-and-chain technology to produce a large metal yoke that can be fitted under the front or rear wheels to cradle them, drawing the front or rear end of the vehicle clear of the ground by a pneumatic or hydraulic hoist so it can be towed. This apparatus generally picks up the drive wheels of the vehicle (i.e. the front wheels if it is front-wheel drive, the rear wheels if it is rear-wheel drive), touching only the tires. The wheel lift was designed by Arthur W. Nelson of Weld Built Body Co. in 1967. The name &quot;spectacle lift&quot; is common in the UK; the cradle resembles a pair of squared spectacles (eyeglasses). Medium and heavy trucks use a variation, the &quot;underlift&quot; or &quot;chassis lift&quot;, which lifts the axle or frame instead of the wheels. Wheel-lift trucks can have adapters which can also lift the chassis.
* Integrated (also called a &quot;self-loader&quot;, &quot;snatcher&quot;, &quot;quick pick&quot; or &quot;repo truck&quot;): boom and wheel-lift integrated into one unit. Used in light-duty trucks to repossess vehicles or move illegally-parked vehicles. Most have controls for the apparatus inside the cab of the tow truck to make quick pickup possible without the inconvenience of exiting the truck to hook up the vehicle. Though similar to a wheel-lift truck, an integrated truck differs in that the end of its boom features movable arms that can more easily and quickly clamp onto the wheels of a vehicle, often controlled from the cabin of the truck. On a wheel-lift truck, the wheels of a vehicle must be manually secured to the yoke by the operator before being lifted. There are also heavy-duty trucks manufactured with integrated lifts.
*Flatbed (also called a &quot;rollback&quot;, &quot;slide&quot; or &quot;tilt tray&quot;): the entire back of the truck is fitted with a bed that can be hydraulically inclined and slid back to ground level, allowing the vehicle to be placed on it under its own power or pulled on by a winch. Because they carry rather than tow the vehicle, they can be used on a completely immobile vehicle; in the US, they are used to carry badly-damaged cars from crashes.
*Lift flatbed: a boom uses a wheel-lift frame to lift the vehicle vertically and load it on the bed. This type of truck can remove vehicles that are parallel-parked. It is commonly used in Europe.

These are the most common arrangements; others also exist, such as flatbed units that offer a wheel-lift, boom trucks that can recover but not tow, and wheel-lift units that offer a combination boom with sling.

There are also several sizes and weight categories of tow truck. The lightest models are usually based on light truck and van chassis offering boom and tow weights of around , making them ideal for car towing. Medium-duty tow trucks have a boom capacity of . Heavy-duty tow trucks, based on chassis used by semi-trucks, with multiple axles and the ability to tow fully-loaded semi-truck and trailer combinations, have a boom capacity from . Rotators are the heaviest type of tow truck, ranging from (though lighter models do exist) and often come with many other features per customer specification.

Most flatbed-type vehicles are based on medium-duty and heavy-duty trucks to provide the chassis strength necessary to carry entire vehicles.

== Operations ==



Tow trucks are usually operated by private businesses, except for major highways and toll roads, where the road authority may operate the tow trucks for that stretch of road. Some police departments own tow trucks; in the US, however, it is common to contract police tows to private companies. Businesses who operate a large fleet of vehicles, such as school bus companies or package delivery services, often own one or several tow trucks for the purposes of their own vehicles. Government departments with large fleets (such as the police departments, fire departments, transportation authorities and departments of public works of major cities) may similarly own one or more tow trucks. Police department tow trucks may also be used to impound other vehicles. Heavy tow trucks are often called to clear semi-truck accidents and straighten out jackknifed trucks. In rural or unorganized areas, companies which operate tow trucks can sometimes also offer additional services appropriate to highway clearance where government-provided ones are unavailable, such as fire suppression.

The military also deploys tow trucks for recovery of stranded vehicles. In the US Army, a variant of the HEMTT truck is used for this purpose, the M984 wrecker. For recovery in combat situations while under fire, many armies with large vehicle fleets also deploy armoured recovery vehicles. These vehicles fulfill a similar role, but are resistant to heavy fire and capable of traversing rough terrain with their tracks, as well as towing vehicles beyond the weight limits of wheeled wreckers, such as tanks (many are based on tank designs for this reason).

Each state and territory of Australia has its own regulations and acts for the operation of tow trucks. Tow trucks are generally divided into two categories, either by standard, trade and private towing or accident towing. Accident towing tow trucks are clearly identifiable by number plates ending in either &quot;ATT&quot; or &quot;TT&quot;. Tow trucks that are not endorsed for accident towing may use general number plates of any combination pursuant to each state&#x27;s own registering system. An example of a statute regulating the operation of tow trucks and towing companies in Victoria is the Victorian Accident Towing Services Act.

Some jurisdictions may allow tow trucks to be considered as emergency vehicles, and use sirens, with the State of Missouri being a notable example.

<doc id="1164323" wikidata="Q4603835" url="?curid=1164323" title="2004–05 United States network television schedule">
<text>The 2004–05 network television schedule for the six major English-language commercial broadcast networks in the United States covers the prime time hours from September 2004 to August 2005. The schedule is followed by a list per network of returning series, new series, and series canceled after the 2003–04 television season. 

Beginning this season, largely resulting from continuing declines in prime time television viewership on that night of the week, the major networks ceased producing original scripted programs for broadcast on Saturday evenings (an exception being ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot;, although it often featured rebroadcast material, mainly in the form of Disney theatrical films). From this point on, Saturday prime time network schedules would instead consist of nonfiction reality-based programs, rebroadcasts of scripted prime time series (most commonly featuring dramatic series), unaired episodes of &quot;de facto&quot; cancelled series that were being &quot;burned off&quot; after having been pulled from their previous timeslot on a different night, theatrical or made-for-television movies, and/or sporting events (which became increasingly common in the time period beginning with the 2012–13 season).

PBS is not included, as member television stations have local flexibility over most of their schedules and broadcast times for network shows may vary. Pax TV (now Ion Television) is also not included; although the network aired a few original first-run series, Pax&#x27;s schedule at the time consisted primarily of syndicated reruns and movies.

Each of the 30 highest-rated shows released in May 2005 is listed with its rank and rating as determined by Nielsen Media Research.

New series are highlighted in bold.

Repeat airings or same-day rebroadcasts are indicated by .

All times are U.S. Eastern and Pacific Time, except for certain live events (such as &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;) that are broadcast simultaneously in all time zones. Subtract one hour for Central, Mountain, Alaska, and Hawaii–Aleutian times.

All sporting events air live in all time zones, with local and/or late-night programming (including those normally aired by Fox affiliates during the 10:00 p.m. ET/PT hour) being shown after the game&#x27;s completion.

==Legend==
==Sunday==
==Monday==

Note: Fox originally scheduled &quot;Athens&quot; (a drama series that was to center on the lives of a group of young adults in a fictional New England college town) as a midseason replacement in the 8:00 p.m. ET slot; however, the network cancelled the series last-minute.

==Tuesday==

Notes:
* NBC originally intended for &quot;Average Joe&quot; to air on its Fall schedule in the 8:00 p.m. ET slot; it chose to delay the reality dating series to Summer. The network originally scheduled &quot;The Contender&quot; to premiere on March 1, 2005 in the 8:00 p.m. ET slot, but opted to delay its premiere to March 9, before switching timeslots with &quot;American Dreams&quot;, which had been airing on Sundays during that hour.
* Fox originally intended to air a Fall run of legal drama &quot;The Jury&quot; (which premiered on June 8) in its existing Tuesday slot prior to November; however on July 27, it cancelled the series due to low ratings. (The two remaining episodes of its 10-episode order aired as scheduled on July 30 and August 6.)

==Wednesday==

Note: Fox originally intended for &quot;Method &amp; Red&quot; to remain in the 9:30 p.m. ET slot, but cancelled it due to low ratings. The network also intended to air &quot;Life on a Stick&quot; at 8:30 p.m. ET and &quot;The Bernie Mac Show&quot; at 9:30 p.m. ET in midseason, but ultimately chose instead to air &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot; and &quot;Life on a Stick&quot; in those respective timeslots.

==Thursday==

Note: Fox originally intended to place &quot;Tru Calling&quot; in the 9:00 p.m. ET slot, but elected to push up its second season to Spring and run &quot;North Shore&quot; in the Fall instead.

==Friday==

Notes:
* Fox originally planned to keep &quot;The Jury&quot; on Fridays, while also slotting &quot;The Next Great Champ&quot; as its lead-in in the 8:00 p.m. ET hour; because of &quot;The Jury&quot;″s cancellation, &quot;The Complex: Malibu&quot; was picked up last-minute to occupy the slot. The network also originally scheduled &quot;The Inside&quot; in the 8:00 p.m. ET hour (leading into &quot;Jonny Zero&quot;) for midseason.
* The WB originally scheduled the sitcom &quot;Commando Nanny&quot; in the 9:30 p.m. ET slot; however, it was cancelled prior to the start of the Fall schedule due to production difficulties, resulting in its substitution by &quot;Blue Collar TV&quot;.

<doc id="1164324" wikidata="Q1786868" url="?curid=1164324" title="Nicholas Brothers">
<text>The Nicholas Brothers were an entertainment act composed of brothers, Fayard (1914–2006) and Harold (1921–2000), who excelled in a variety of dance techniques, primarily between the 1930s and 1950s. Best known for their unique interpretation of a highly acrobatic technique known as &quot;flash dancing&quot;, they were also considered by many to be the greatest tap dancers of their day, if not all time. Their virtuoso performance in the musical number &quot;Jumping&#x27; Jive&quot; (with Cab Calloway and his orchestra) featured in the 1943 movie &quot;Stormy Weather&quot; has been praised as one of the greatest dance routines ever captured on film.

Growing up surrounded by vaudeville acts as children, they became stars of the jazz circuit during the Harlem Renaissance and performed on stage, film, and television well into the 2000s. Diminutive in size, they were appreciated for their artistry, innovation, and soaring leaps.

==Early lives==
Fayard Antonio Nicholas was born August 28, 1914, in Mobile, Alabama, and Harold Lloyd Nicholas was born March 17, 1921, in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, to Viola Harden (&quot;maiden;&quot; 1893–1971), a pianist, and Ulysses Dominick Nicholas (1892–1935), a drummer.

The Nicholas Brothers grew up in Philadelphia, the sons of college-educated musicians who played in their own band at the Standard Theater. At the age of three, Fayard would always sit in the front row while his parents worked, and by the time he was ten, he had seen most of the great African-American vaudeville acts—particularly the dancers, including such notables of the time as Alice Whitman, Willie Bryant, and Bill Robinson. The brothers were fascinated by the combination of tap dancing and acrobatics. Fayard often imitated their acrobatics and clowning for the kids in his neighborhood.

Neither Fayard nor Harold had any formal dance training. Fayard taught himself how to dance, sing, and perform by watching and imitating the professional entertainers on stage. He then taught his younger siblings, first performing with his sister Dorothy as &quot;the Nicholas Kids&quot;, later joined by Harold. Harold idolized his older brother and learned by copying his moves and distinct style. Dorothy later opted out of the act, and the Nicholas Kids became known as &quot;the Nicholas Brothers&quot;.

==Career==
As word spread of their talent, the Nicholas Brothers became known around Philadelphia. They were first hired for a radio program, &quot;The Horn and Hardart Kiddie Hour&quot;, and then by other local theatres such as the Standard and the Pearl. When they were performing at the Pearl, the manager of The Lafayette, a New York vaudeville showcase, saw them and immediately wanted them to perform for his theater.

The brothers moved to Philadelphia in 1926 and gave their first performance at the Standard a few years later. In 1932, they became the featured act at Harlem&#x27;s Cotton Club when Harold was 11 and Fayard was 18. They astonished their mainly white audiences dancing to the jazz tempos of &quot;Bugle Call Rag&quot;; they were the only entertainers in the African-American cast allowed to mingle with white patrons. They performed at the Cotton Club for two years, working with the orchestras of Lucky Millinder, Cab Calloway, Duke Ellington, and Jimmy Lunceford. During this time, they made their uncredited movie debut, in the 1932 short &quot;Pie, Pie Blackbird&quot;, featuring Eubie Blake and his orchestra. The brothers attributed their success to their unique style of dancing - a hybrid of tap dance, ballet, and acrobatics sometimes called &quot;acrobatic dancing&quot; or &quot;flash dancing&quot; - which was greatly in demand during this time.

Producer Samuel Goldwyn saw them at the Cotton Club and invited them to California to be a part of &quot;Kid Millions&quot; (1934), their first performances in a Hollywood movie. The brothers made their Broadway debut in the &quot;Ziegfeld Follies of 1936&quot; and also appeared in Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart&#x27;s musical &quot;Babes in Arms&quot; in 1937. They impressed their choreographer, George Balanchine, who invited them to appear in &quot;Babes in Arms&quot;. With Balanchine&#x27;s training, they learned many new stunts. Their talent led many to presume they were trained ballet dancers.

By 1940, they had moved to Hollywood and for several decades divided their time between movies, nightclubs, concerts, Broadway, television, and extensive tours of Latin America, Africa, and Europe. They toured England with a production of &quot;Blackbirds&quot;. They gave a Royal Command Performance at the London Paladium for King George VI in 1948.

In 1991, the Nicholas Brothers received Kennedy Center Honors in recognition of their six decades of achievements. A year later, a documentary film, &quot;We Sing &amp; We Dance&quot;, celebrated their careers and included tributes from Mikhail Baryshnikov, Gregory Hines, M.C. Hammer, and Clarke Peters. In 1994, members of the cast of &quot;Hot Shoe Shuffle&quot; also paid them tribute.

==Teaching==
The Nicholas Brothers taught master classes in tap dance as teachers-in-residence at Harvard University and Radcliffe at Ruth Page Visiting Artists. Among their known students are Debbie Allen, Janet Jackson, and Michael Jackson. Several of today&#x27;s master tap dancers have performed with or been taught by the brothers: Dianne Walker, Sam Weber, Lane Alexander, Mark Mendonca, Terry Brock, Colburn Kids Tap/L.A, Channing Cook Holmes, Chris Baker, Artis Brienzo, Chester Whitmore, Darlene Gist, Chris Scott, Tobius Tak, Carol Zee, and Steve Zee.

==Style and moves==

The brothers were particularly known for their expressive use of their hands and arms while dancing, particularly tap. One of their signature moves was to leapfrog down a long, broad flight of stairs, completing each step with a split. Its best remembered performance is in the finale of the movie &quot;Stormy Weather&quot; (1943). In that routine, the Nicholas Brothers leapt exuberantly across the orchestra&#x27;s music stands and danced on the top of a grand piano in a call and response act with the pianist, to the tune of &quot;Jumpin&#x27; Jive&quot;. Fred Astaire once told the brothers that this dance number was the greatest number he had ever seen on film. Numerous articles have been written about this whole dance being filmed in one take and unrehearsed. As unbelievable as that sounds (there are multiple cuts in the scene, requiring two or more cameras), the Nicholas Brothers confirmed it in an interview shortly before their recognition at the 14th Annual Kennedy Center Honors. The choreographer, Nick Castle, said, &quot;Just do it. Don`t rehearse it, just do it.&quot; And so it was done, unrehearsed and in one take, which relieved Harold Nicholas because he did not want to do the rigorous routine over and over all night.

In another signature move, they would rise from a split without using their hands. Gregory Hines declared that if their biography were ever filmed, their dance numbers would have to be computer-generated because no one now could emulate them. Ballet legend Mikhail Baryshnikov once called them the most amazing dancers he had ever seen in his life.

==Personal lives==
===Fayard===
Fayard married four times. His marriage to Geraldine Pate lasted from 1942 until their divorce in 1955. That year, he married Mexican dancer Victoria Barron. As of May 1960, that marriage remained intact, with &quot;Vicky&quot; also working alongside Fayard professionally. He married Barbara January in 1967, the same year he converted to the Baháʼí Faith, and they remained together until her death in 1998. He married Katherine Hopkins in 2000.

He died on January 24, 2006, of pneumonia contracted after a stroke. His memorial service, presided over by Mary Jean Valente of &quot;A Ceremony of the Heart&quot;, was standing-room only and featured personal tributes, music, dance, and one last standing ovation.

Two of Fayard&#x27;s granddaughters dance as the &quot;Nicholas Sisters&quot; and have won awards for their performances.

===Harold===
Harold was married three times. From 1942 to 1951, he was married to singer and actress Dorothy Dandridge, with whom he had one child, Harolyn Nicholas, who was born with a severe intellectual disability. In Paris, he had a son, Melih Nicholas, with his second wife Elayne Patronne. He lived on New York&#x27;s Upper West Side for twenty years with his third wife, producer and former Miss Sweden, Rigmor Alfredsson Newman. Harold died July 3, 2000, of a heart attack following minor surgery.

==Filmography==
According to a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article on the brothers, &quot;Because of racial prejudice, they appeared as guest artists, isolated from the plot, in many of their films. This was a strategy that allowed their scenes to be easily deleted for screening in the Jim Crow-era South&quot;.

<text>The third USS &quot;Lexington&quot; was a timberclad gunboat in the United States Navy during the American Civil War.

==Purchase and conversion==
&quot;Lexington&quot; was built as a sidewheel steamer at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1861 and was purchased by the War Department and converted into a gunboat at Cincinnati, Ohio, under the direction of Commander John Rodgers.

The gunboat, operated by the navy, joined the army&#x27;s Western Flotilla at Cairo, Illinois, 12 August 1861. On 22 August, she seized steamer &quot;W. B. Terry&quot; at Paducah, Kentucky, and on 4 September, with , she engaged Confederate gunboat &quot;Jackson&quot; and southern shore batteries at Hickman and Columbus, Kentucky. On 6 September, the two gunboats spearheaded General Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s drive to seize strategic Paducah and Smithland, Kentucky, at the mouths of the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers. In his first use of strength afloat, Grant countered a Confederate move into the state, helping preserve Kentucky for the Union and foreshadowing his skillful use of naval mobility and support during the coming campaigns which divided the Confederacy and won the entire Mississippi system for the Union.

&quot;Lexington&quot;″s next action came on the 10th when she and silenced a Confederate battery and damaged &quot;Jackson&quot; at Lucas Bend, Missouri, while covering a troop advance. An 8-inch shell from &quot;Lexington&quot; exploded in &quot;Jackson&quot;″s starboard wheelhouse causing severe damage. Only the powerful batteries on the bluffs at Columbus, Kentucky, saved &quot;Jackson&quot; and another Southern steamer from capture.

==Battle of Belmont==

After accompanying an expedition to Owensboro, Kentucky, on 22–25 September, &quot;Lexington&quot; again engaged the batteries of Columbus on 7 October. With &quot;Tyler&quot; a month later, she protected General Grant&#x27;s army during the Battle of Belmont silencing enemy batteries which opposed the landings. When a large number of fresh Confederate troops threatened Grant&#x27;s men, well directed fire of grape and canister from &quot;Lexington&quot; and &quot;Tyler&quot; scattered the Southern reinforcements enabling the Union soldiers to reach safety on their transports.

==Battle of Fort Henry==
The Western Flotilla steamed up the Tennessee River to attack Fort Henry which guarded this water approach to the South&#x27;s heartland. Although the operation was originally planned as a joint expedition, heavy rains for 2 days before the attack delayed troop movements so the gunboats attacked alone 6 February 1862. Accurate fire from the gunboats pounded the fort and forced Brigadier General Lloyd Tilghman, CSA, with all but four of his defending guns useless, to strike his flag. In continuing operations the three days following the capitulation of Fort Henry, &quot;Tyler&quot;, &quot;Conestoga&quot; and &quot;Lexington&quot; swept the Tennessee for Confederate transports, seized the unfinished steamer &quot;Eastport&quot;, and destroyed a railroad bridge spanning the river.

==Battle of Shiloh==

After repairs &quot;Lexington&quot; rejoined &quot;Tyler&quot; protecting army transports and supporting troop movements along the Tennessee River. On 1 March the gunboats engaged Confederate forces fortifying Shiloh (Pittsburg Landing) Tennessee. They landed a party of sailors and army sharpshooters to reconnoiter Confederate strength in the area. They then moved further upstream and engaged a Confederate battery at Chickasaw, Alabama, on the 12th. Later in the month they steamed upstream to Eastport, Mississippi, where they exchanged fire with Southern artillery.

The capture of Fort Henry and Fort Donelson opened serious breaches in the Confederancy&#x27;s outer defense line which Grant was quick to exploit. Southern troops commanded by Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston, made a major effort to stem his advance in the Battle of Shiloh and came close to overwhelming the Union troops. Major General Leonidas Polk, CSA, reported that the Confederate forces &quot;were within from 150 to 400 yards of the enemy&#x27;s position, and nothing seemed wanting to complete the most brilliant victory of the war but to press forward and make a vigorous assault on the demoralized remnant of his forces. At this juncture his gunboats dropped down the river, near the landing where his troops were collected, and opened a tremendous cannonade of shot and shell over the bank, in the direction from where our forces were approaching.&quot; This timely support from &quot;Lexington&quot; and &quot;Tyler&quot; swung the delicate balance of forces back to the Union side and saved Grant&#x27;s men from disaster.

After the day was over, the &quot;Lexington&quot; and &quot;Tyler&quot; spent the night bombarding the Confederate army, which had settled down in Union camps they had captured early in the morning assault. Firing into the darkness, the gunboats caused few casualties, but they did prevent many Confederate soldiers from getting any sleep.

==Battle of Saint Charles==
&quot;Lexington&quot; continued to support army operations in the Tennessee River until steaming down the Mississippi with &quot;Conestoga&quot;, , and to enter the White River, 14 June. While the Union gunboats, were capturing St. Charles, Arkansas, 17 June a direct hit exploded &quot;Mound City&quot;″s steam drum scalding many of her men. The injured crewmen were treated on &quot;Lexington&quot; as she pushed 63 miles further upriver to Crooked Point Cut-off where shallow water forced her to turn back. The gunboat then returned to the Mississippi to protect army transports from guerilla bands which attacked from the river banks.

==Yazoo River, Fort Hindman, and Cumberland River operations==
&quot;Lexington&quot;, which transferred to the navy with the other ships of the Western Flotilla on 1 October 1862, participated in the joint expedition up the Yazoo River to attack Vicksburg, Mississippi from the rear. On 27 December, while clearing mines from the river, the Union gunboats fought off heavy attacks by Confederate batteries. The next day they provided cover fire for General Sherman&#x27;s troops during an attack on Confederate-held Chickasaw Bayou. &quot;Through these operations,&quot; David Dixon Porter wrote, &quot;the Navy did everything that could be done to ensure the success of General Sherman&#x27;s movement.&quot; Though the navy supplied shore bombardment from the squadron and created diversionary movements, the Union troops, hindered by heavy rains and faced by the timely arrival of Confederate reinforcements, were forced to withdraw.

On 4 January 1863, the gunboats and army transports headed up the White River, Arkansas, to attack Fort Hindman. The squadron covered the landing of troops on the 9th by shelling Confederate rifle pits. The next day, though the Army was not in position to press the attack, the Union ships moved to within 60 yards of the staunchly defended fort and began a blistering engagement which softened the works for the next day&#x27;s assault. When the Union troops charged the position on the 11th, the gunboats resumed their well-directed fire and silenced every southern gun. After this defeat the Confederates evacuated other positions on the White and Saint Charles rivers.

Meanwhile, Confederate raiders were threatening to wrest control of the Cumberland Valley from the Union. Answering General William Rosecrans&#x27; appeal for naval support, &quot;Lexington&quot; got underway for the Cumberland River on 25 January. The joint army-navy cooperation kept the upper rivers open to the Union and prevented an effective Confederate counteroffensive. Frequently fighting off attacks from Southern snipers and flying batteries, &quot;Lexington&quot; escorted transports and destroyed Confederate positions along the banks. On 3 February with five other ships she helped repulse a Confederate attempt to retake Fort Donelson. When they reached the scene of the battle they found the defending troops &quot;out of ammunition and entirely surrounded by the rebels in overwhelming numbers, but still holding them in check.&quot; &quot;Lexington&quot; routed the Confederates in a hurry.

==Battle of Milliken&#x27;s Bend==
Ordered down the Mississippi on 2 June to support final operations against Vicksburg, &quot;Lexington&quot; joined in defending Union troops at Milliken&#x27;s Bend, Mississippi, from the assault of numerically superior Confederate soldiers on the 7th. For the next month she continued to operate against the mighty Confederate fortress until it fell on 4 July.

After reconnaissance work and patrol duty in the Mississippi during the summer, &quot;Lexington&quot; was ordered back to the Tennessee River on 29 October to assist General Sherman at the beginning of his drive through the Confederate heartland. However, at the end of February 1864, she returned to the Mississippi for operations in support of the Red River Campaign. With paddle wheel monitor and four other gunboats she moved up the Black River to gather information about Confederate sharpshooters as they entered the Ouachita River and proceeded up the Bayou Louis where shallowing water compelled them to return, capturing Confederate artillery and large quantities of cotton before reaching the mouth of the Red River on 5 March. A week later the Mississippi Squadron moved up the Red River in force.

==Red River==
The Confederate defenders were driven off at Simmesport and Maj. Gen. A. J. Smith&#x27;s troops marched on Fort DeRussy, which was taken by the combined land and naval forces on 14 March 1864. The next day &quot;Lexington&quot; with gunboat &quot;Ouachita&quot;, followed by the &quot;Eastport&quot;, pushed on toward Alexandria, Louisiana, chasing Confederate steamers fleeing toward safety above the Alexandria rapids; but the Union ships arrived less than an hour too late to capture six steamers which had succeeding in getting over the falls. Confederate steamer &quot;Countess&quot; which grounded in flight and a barge left behind were burned to prevent capture. The army transports arrived the next day and troops were landed to occupy that town.

On 7 April, &quot;Lexington&quot; and five other gunboats steamed over the falls toward Shreveport, Louisiana, to support General Nathaniel Prentiss Banks who was advancing up the valley. Three days later the hulk of steamer &quot;New Falls City&quot;, sunk in a narrow stretch of the river near Springfield Landing blocked the progress of the expedition. Before this obstruction could be removed, word arrived from Major General Banks of his defeat at the Battle of Sabine Crossroads near Grand Encore and retreat toward Pleasant Hill. The transports and troops of Brig. Gen. Thomas Kilby Smith were ordered to return to the major force and join Banks. The high point of the Union&#x27;s Red River campaign had been reached. From this point, with falling water levels and increased Confederate shore fire the gunboats would face a desperate battle to avoid being trapped above the Alexandria rapids.

In the Battle of Blair&#x27;s Landing, &quot;Lexington&quot; silenced the shore battery but the Confederate cavalry poured a hail of musket fire into the rest of the squadron. The rebels fought with unusual pertinacity for over an hour, delivering the heaviest and most concentrated fire of musketry. What Porter described as &quot;this curious affair...a fight between infantry and gunboats&quot;, was finally decided by the gunboats&#x27; fire, which inflicted heavy losses on the Confederates, including the death of their commander, General Thomas Green. This engagement featured the use of a unique instrument, developed by Chief Engineer Thomas Doughty of &quot;Osage&quot; and later described by Thomas O. Selfridge Jr. as &quot;a method of sighting the turret from the outside, by means of what would now be called a periscope...&quot; The high banks of the Red River posed a great difficulty for the ships&#x27; gunners in aiming their cannon from water level. Doughty&#x27;s ingenious apparatus helped to solve the problem. Thus was the periscope, a familiar sight on modern gun turrets and on submarines, brought into Civil War use on the western waters.

Upon reaching Grand Ecore the fleet faced a dangerous situation. The Red River, normally high until late June, had fallen so much that the gunboats could not pass over the rapids and it seemed that the better part of the Mississippi Squadron was doomed to destruction as the Union Army made plans for evacuation. However, Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Bailey USA, proposed a plan for building a series of dams across the rocks of the falls and raising the water. A center opening would let the ships ride out on the crest of the water. On 9 May 1864, the dam had nearly reached completion but the pressure of the water became so great that it swept away two stone barges which swung in below the dam on one side. Seeing this accident, Admiral Porter mounted a horse and rode up to where upper vessels were anchored and ordered &quot;Lexington&quot; to get underway.
Lieutenant Bache succeeded in getting &quot;Lexington&quot; over the upper falls, then steered her directly for the opening in the dam where the furiously raging waters seemed to promise only her destruction. She entered the gap in the dam with a full head of steam and pitched down the powerful torrent with several heavy rolls, hung for a moment on the rocks below, then reached the calm, deep water to the ringing cheers of some 30,000 voices. She was soon followed by the remainder of the vessels and the Union&#x27;s valuable fleet was saved.

On 15 June 1864, &quot;Lexington&quot; seized the Confederate steamers &quot;Mattie&quot;, &quot;M. Walt&quot; and &quot;R. E. Hill&quot;, at Beulah Landing, Mississippi, with cotton on board. She repulsed an attack on White River Station, Arkansas, on 22 June 1864. For the rest of the war she continued patrol and convoy duty.

She arrived at Mound City, Illinois on 5 June 1865 and decommissioned there on 2 July 1865. &quot;Lexington&quot; was sold to Thomas Scott and Woodburn on 17 August 1865.

<text>Sikasso Region (Bambara: ߛߌߞߊߛߏ ߘߌߣߋߖߊ tr. Sikaso Dineja) is the southernmost region of Mali. The region&#x27;s capital city, Sikasso, is the country&#x27;s second-largest city. Major ethnic groups include the Senoufo, known for masks and reverence for animals, the Samago, known for being Mali&#x27;s best farmers, and the main ethnic group in Mali, the Bambara people.

==Administrative divisions==

Sikasso Region is divided into seven &quot;cercles&quot;:

The city of Sikasso is known for a vibrant outdoor market which features fabrics, numerous vegetables and fruits (especially mangoes, for which Sikasso is particularly renowned.) Sikasso is an ethnic and linguistic melting pot featuring people from outlying villages, immigrants from Côte d&#x27;Ivoire and Burkina Faso and refugees.

The southwest corner of the Sikasso region is traditionally known as Wassoulou. This area is known for its unique music and strong tradition of hunting. The main city of Wassoulou is Yanfolila.

Besides the regional capital, the other urban communes and major cities in Sikasso Region are Bougouni, a junction town en route to Bamako (the capital of Mali), and Koutiala in the northern part of Sikasso Region, which is the hub of Mali&#x27;s highly productive cotton industry, which produces one of the country&#x27;s few exports.

<text>Fayard Antonio Nicholas (October 20, 1914 – January 24, 2006) was an American choreographer, dancer and actor. He and his younger brother Harold Nicholas made up the Nicholas Brothers tap dance duo, who starred in the MGM musicals &quot;An All-Colored Vaudeville Show&quot; (1935), &quot;Stormy Weather&quot; (1943), &quot;The Pirate&quot; (1948), and &quot;Hard Four&quot; (2007). The Nicholas brothers also starred in the 20th Century-Fox musicals &quot;Down Argentine Way&quot; (1940), &quot;Sun Valley Serenade&quot; (1941), and &quot;Orchestra Wives&quot; (1942).

==Early life==
Nicholas was born in Alabama, but grew up primarily in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He learned to dance while watching vaudeville shows with his brother while their musician parents played in the orchestra. His father, Ulysses D. Nicholas, was a drummer and his mother, Viola Harden Nicholas, was a pianist.

==Career==

In 1932, when he was 18 and his brother was only 11, they became the featured act at Cotton Club in New York City. The brothers earned fame with a unique style of rhythm tap that blended &quot;masterful jazz steps with daredevil athletic moves and an elegance of motion worthy of ballet&quot;. They appeared in the Ziegfeld Follies on Broadway and in London they worked with jazz choreographer Buddy Bradley. The performances led them to a career in film. Nicholas appeared in over 60 films, including the 1943 musical &quot;Stormy Weather&quot; with their signature staircase dance.

His career was interrupted from 1943 to 1944 when he served in the U.S. Army during World War II. Nicholas achieved the rank of Technician fifth grade while in WWII.

After his dance career ended, Nicholas and his wife, Katherine Hopkins Nicholas, embarked on a lecture tour discussing dance. In 2003, Nicholas served as &quot;Festival Legend&quot; at the third &quot;Soul to Sole Tap Festival&quot; in Austin, Texas.

Nicholas was inducted into the National Museum of Dance C.V. Whitney Hall of Fame in 2001.

==Personal life==
Fayard was married three times. He remained friends with his first wife, Geraldine Pate, after their divorce. His second wife was Barbara January, and they remained married until her death in 1998. He married dancer Katherine Hopkins in 2000. He was a member of the Baháʼí Faith. Fayard died of pneumonia following a stroke in 2006 at age 91. His widow Katherine died in 2012.

<doc id="1164337" wikidata="Q1539435" url="?curid=1164337" title="Lake Rotokākahi">
<text>Lake Rotokākahi or Green Lake, is one of four small lakes lying between Lake Rotorua and Lake Tarawera in the Bay of Plenty Region of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. The others are Lake Tikitapu (Blue Lake), Lake Ōkāreka, and Lake Ōkataina. All lie within the Ōkataina Caldera, along its western edge.

==Geography==
The lake flows to Lake Tarawera via the Wairoa Stream (also known as ) past the buried Te Wairoa village and its Wairere waterfall. The Wairoa Stream when it leaves Lake Rotokākahi has a mean flow rate of but it picks up subsurface water and tributaries so when it enters Lake Tarawera it has a mean flow rate of . From the air the lake looks emerald green related to its shallow, sandy bottom. The lake is above sea level and below the level of the neighbouring Lake Tikitapu to its north. Its eastern arm is separated from Lake Tikitapu by a lava dam generated during a rhyolitic eruption, at the south-western margins of the Ōkataina Caldera now dated at 15,635 ± 412 cal.yr BP. It contains a small island in its western arm, Punaruku Island and its southern arm has a larger island Motutawa Island. While the catchment flows into the Tarawera River watershed in due course, the south-western aspect of the lake is only a very short distance from the Waikato River watershed.

==Ecology==
It is named for its abundance of (freshwater mussels).

The lake had brown trout introduced in the 1870s. Rainbow trout were introduced later.

The lake is classified as mesotrophic, with moderate productivity and water quality, but has not been assessed recently. Its trophic level index was 3.6 in 2014 which was a decline and relatively high for a local lake. This may be because 26.3% of its catchment was pasture in 2007.

==History==
The main tribe occupying the Lake Rotokakahi area at the time of European settlement were the Tuhourangi/Ngati Tumatawera, who had migrated from the Rotoiti area following various feuds with neighbouring tribes. During early European settlement Kaiteriria on the southern lake shore was a base for armed constabulary. The lake has been under the authority of the Te Arawa iwi, Tūhourangi and Ngati Tumatawera since 1948, when there was disturbance of the , and remains largely undisturbed

==Motutawa==
This small island in the lake is notable as the site of the 1822 slaughter of a part of Ngāpuhi, as an act of vengeance for relatives killed by the same Ngapuhi warriors in Te Totara, Thames. This led to the revenge raid of Hongi Hika in 1823. The island was the main historic stronghold of Tuhourangi/Ngati Wahiao, and tradition has it as the resting place of the bones of Hinemoa.

The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of &quot;tawa tree island&quot; for .

<doc id="1164338" wikidata="Q1689389" url="?curid=1164338" title="Jimmy McIlroy">
<text>James McIlroy (25 October 1931 – 20 August 2018) was a Northern Ireland international footballer, who played for Glentoran, Burnley, Stoke City and Oldham Athletic. He was regarded as one of Burnley&#x27;s greatest players, having played 497 matches and scoring 131 goals. McIlroy also managed Oldham Athletic and Bolton Wanderers.

==Career==

===Burnley===
McIlroy was born in Lambeg, County Antrim and he was introduced to football at an early age as his father, Harry played for Lisburn Distillery and his uncle, Willie played for Portadown. After leaving school McIlroy played for Glentoran before joining Burnley in March 1950 for £7,000. He soon cemented his reputation as one of the finest scheming inside forwards since World War II. He was dubbed as the &#x27;Brain&#x27; of Burnley and was a very composed passer of the ball only releasing it when he was sure of finding a teammate. His neat footwork made him a crowd favourite at Turf Moor and indeed for the Northern Ireland national team where he made 55 caps. He helped Burnley win the First Division in 1959–60 and reach the FA Cup Final in 1962, losing 3–1 to Tottenham Hotspur. After 497 matches for the &quot;Clarets&quot; scoring 131 goals, McIlroy was allowed to leave for Stoke City for a cut price £25,000, which came as a shock to the Burnley fans who branded chairman Bob Lord &#x27;insane&#x27;.

===Stoke City===
McIlroy joined Tony Waddington&#x27;s Stoke who at the time had a collection of experienced veterans with the likes of Stanley Matthews, Dennis Viollet, Jackie Mudie and Don Ratcliffe. He arrived at Stoke with the side top of the table but his debut for Stoke was a disaster as Stoke crashed to a 6–0 defeat at Norwich City. Regardless Stoke continued their push for promotion and with McIlroy&#x27;s intelligent passing featuring heavily they claimed the Second Division title in 1962–63. He scored 12 goals in 1963–64 as Stoke established themselves in the top tier, he also played in the 1964 League Cup Final as Stoke lost 4–3 Leicester City. His final match for the &quot;Potters&quot; was against Burnley on 27 December 1965 leaving to become manager of Oldham Athletic.

==Later career==
In January 1966 he moved into management after being recruited by new Oldham Athletic chairman Ken Bates. With Oldham struggling at the foot of the Third Division, Oldham paid Stoke £5,000 so that they could register McIlroy as a player again. He signed several former Stoke City team-mates, including Bill Asprey, Alan Philpott, George Kinnell and Keith Bebbington. However McIlroy did not cope well with the pressure of management and resigned after losing 4–0 against Luton Town on the opening day of the 1968–69 season. He returned to Stoke City for a short while as assistant to Waddington before moving to Bolton Wanderers as coach and assistant to Nat Lofthouse. McIlroy had an 18-day spell in charge after Lofthouse&#x27;s departure but resigned after just two matches on principle after being told by the board to sell players.

==After football==

He retired to the Burnley area and was a regular attender of Burnley home matches. He was given Freedom of the Borough Burnley in December 2008 and was given a testimonial match by Burnley in 2009.

McIlroy was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2011 New Years Honours List for services to football and to charity, and arranged to receive the honour at Burnley&#x27;s Turf Moor ground rather than at Buckingham Palace.

In April 2015, the feature-length documentary Spirit of &#x27;58 was screened as part of the Belfast Film Festival. It featured Jimmy McIlroy prominently alongside the other surviving players (Billy Bingham, Peter McParland, Billy Simpson and Harry Gregg) as it told the story of Northern Ireland&#x27;s journey throughout the 1950s under the managership of Peter Doherty, culminating in the 1958 World Cup.

McIllroy died on 20 August 2018 at the age of 86. In a statement Burnley called him &quot;our greatest ever player.&quot;

==Jimmy McIlroy Stand==
Burnley&#x27;s stadium, Turf Moor, has a stand named in McIlroy&#x27;s honour. The stadium&#x27;s eastern stand was rebuilt in the late 1990s after the Beehole End was demolished and was named the &quot;Jimmy McIlroy Stand&quot;.

<text>Queanbeyan City was a local government area located in south eastern New South Wales, Australia. The former area is located adjacent to Canberra and the Australian Capital Territory, the Queanbeyan River, the Molonglo River, the Kings Highway and the Sydney-Canberra railway.

On 12 May 2016 the Minister for Local Government announced dissolution of Queanbeyan City with immediate effect. Together with the Palerang Council the combined council areas were merged to establish the Queanbeyan-Palerang Regional Council.

The last mayor of the Queanbeyan City Council was Tim Overall, an independent politician.

== Cities, towns and localities ==
The Queanbeyan City Council area included the suburbs and villages of:

* Carwoola
* Crestwood
* Environa
* Googong
* Greenleigh
* Jerrabomberra
* Karabar
* Queanbeyan East
* Queanbeyan West
* Queanbeyan
* The Ridgeway
* Royalla
* Tralee
In 1998 Queanbeyan Council applied to have the localities of Letchworth, Larmer, Dodsworth and De Salis recognised as suburbs and these names were assigned by the Geographical Names Board of New South Wales. A more recent Council has had these names withdrawn.

== Council ==
=== Composition and election method ===
Until its dissolution, the Queanbeyan City Council was composed of ten councillors, including the mayor, for a fixed four-year term of office. The mayor was directly elected while the nine other councillors were elected proportionally as one entire ward. , the makeup of the last council, including the mayor, was as follows:

The last Council, elected in 2012 and dissolved in 2016, in order of election, was:

===2012===
==Amalgamation==
A 2015 review of local government boundaries recommended that the Queanbeyan City Council merge with adjoining councils. The NSW Government considered two options. The first option was to merge Queanbeyan Council with parts of the Palerang Council to form a new council with an area of and support a population of approximately . The alternative, proposed by Palerang Council on 29 January 2016, was for an amalgamation of the whole of Palerang with Queanbeyan Council. On 12 May 2016 the Minister for Local Government announced dissolution of Queanbeyan City with immediate effect. Together with the Palerang Council the combined council areas were merged to establish the Queanbeyan-Palerang Regional Council.

<doc id="1164342" wikidata="Q377991" url="?curid=1164342" title="Harold Nicholas">
<text>Harold Lloyd Nicholas (March 27, 1921 – July 3, 2000) was an American dancer specializing in tap. Nicholas was the younger half of the tap-dancing pair the Nicholas Brothers, known as two of the world&#x27;s greatest dancers. His older brother was Fayard Nicholas. Nicholas was featured in such musicals as &quot;An All-Colored Vaudeville Show&quot; (1935), &quot;Stormy Weather&quot; (1943), &quot;The Pirate&quot; (1948), and &quot;The Five Heartbeats&quot; (1991).

==Life and career==
===Early years===
Nicholas was born to drummer and orchestra leader Ulysses Domonick and pianist Viola Harden in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. By the age of three, his older brother Fayard enjoyed sitting in the audience of the black vaudeville theater where his parents performed, enraptured by the great performers on stage. Immersed in show business, when the Nicholases added a second son to the family, seven-year-old Fayard insisted that the child be named after his idol, Harold Lloyd, the silent-screen comedian. The two brothers soon began dancing, and they quickly gained acclaim for their elegant acrobatic moves and mastery of tap. When Fayard was 16 and Harold nine, they made their first appearance at the legendary Cotton Club in New York City and were a popular success immediately.

=== Career ===
Their reputation grew rapidly, and Harold and Fayard became established superstars at Twentieth Century Fox with their astounding dance numbers in the studio&#x27;s musicals features. The brothers began appearing in musical films with Eubie Blake. They performed in vaudeville, on Broadway, in nightclubs, on television, and in movie musicals. Harold appeared in more than 50 feature films, including &quot;The Big Broadcast&quot; (1936), &quot;Down Argentine Way&quot; (1940), &quot;Tin Pan Alley&quot; (1940), and &quot;Sun Valley Serenade&quot; (1941), which features the show-stopping &quot;Chattanooga Choo Choo&quot; tap dance number performed by Harold, Fayard, and Dorothy Dandridge.

Fred Astaire told the brothers that their dazzling footwork, leaps and splits in the Jumpin’ Jive dance in &quot;Stormy Weather&quot; (1943) produced the greatest movie musical number he had ever seen. In the number, the brothers dance on a piano and leap over performing musicians. The Nicholas Brothers’ Hollywood career began after movie mogul Samuel Goldwyn spotted them in a nightclub and cast them in &quot;Kid Millions&quot; (1934). The two became big film stars despite racial restrictions at the time prohibiting speaking parts and scenes with white co-stars. Their last film together was 1948&#x27;s &quot;The Pirate&quot;, in which Gene Kelly danced with them, breaking the color barrier. Harold went on to work as a solo artist, moving to France and touring as a singer and dancer. He appeared in the French film &quot;L’Empire De La Nuit&quot; (1964).

=== Later life ===
Harold returned to America occasionally to do shows with his brother. Harold also appeared in the films &quot;Uptown Saturday Night&quot; (1974), &quot;Tap&quot; (1989), &quot;The Five Heartbeats&quot; (1991) and &quot;Funny Bones&quot; (1995). In 1985–86, Nicholas played the role of &quot;Daddy Bates&quot; in the National Tour of the Broadway musical &quot;The Tap Dance Kid&quot;. In 1993, he starred in the Milwaukee Repertory Theatre&#x27;s world premiere of &quot;If These Shoes Could Talk&quot;, which also starred Tony nominee Ted Levy, an original tap dance musical by Lee Summers and Kevin Ramsey. The leading character, a seasoned triple threat/hoofer, &quot;Dr Rhythm,&quot; was written for Nicholas and would be his farewell stage performance in a musical. Carnegie Hall sold out for a tribute to him and his brother in 1998, who were both present. By that time he had been living on New York&#x27;s Upper West Side, where he lived for approximately 20 years with his third wife Rigmor Alfredsson Newman, a producer.

==Personal life==
Nicholas was married three times and had two children. His first marriage, on September 6, 1942, was to the actress, singer and dancer Dorothy Dandridge. They met at the Cotton Club in Harlem in 1938. Together they had a daughter, Harolyn Suzanne, who was born on September 2, 1943 (died in 2003), with severe brain damage that prevented her from speaking or even acknowledging her parents. By 1948, their marriage had deteriorated and Nicholas abandoned his family. Their marriage lasted nine years, ending in 1951. Nicholas had been linked briefly in Europe to Swiss actress Nyta Dover. Nicholas had a son, Melih, with his second wife Elyanne Patronne. At the time of his death, he was married to Rigmor Newman Nicholas.

==Death and honors==
Nicholas died in New York City on July 3, 2000, at the age of 79, from heart failure. Nicholas was inducted into the National Museum of Dance C.V. Whitney Hall of Fame in 2001, along with his brother Fayard Nicholas.

==Filmography==
Nicholas appeared in the following films dancing alongside his brother Fayard, with occasional solos:

<doc id="1164343" wikidata="Q1801029" url="?curid=1164343" title="Lake Ōkareka">
<text>Lake Ōkāreka (also spelled Okareka, Ōkareka and just termed ) is one of four small lakes lying between Lake Rotorua and Lake Tarawera, in the Bay of Plenty Region of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. The others are Lake Rotokakahi (Green Lake), Lake Tikitapu (Blue Lake), and Lake Ōkataina. All lie within the Ōkataina Caldera, along its western edge.

==Geography==

The lake has a circumference of and with an autumn mean lake level of , lies about above Lake Tarawera. Its outlet flows underground for half a mile and forms the Waitangi waterfall. Lake Ōkāreka seems to be connected with Tarawera by underground channels. About in all, flows from Lake Ōkareka&#x27;s catchment into Lake Tarawera. The lake&#x27;s maximum height is now regulated to by adjusting a valve in the Waitangi Stream Drain.

===Geology===
The lake is closely related to the Ōkareka Embayment on the western margins of the Ōkataina Caldera. Likely formative and modifying eruptions were the Te Rere rhyolite eruption of 25,171 ± 964 years BP and the Rotorua eruption of 15,635 ± 412 cal.yr BP. The effusive rhyolite dome forming process&#x27;s to the lake&#x27;s south east after these events would have modified its drainage into Lake Tarawera.

==History==
This small and little-visited lake is surrounded by hills nearly everywhere, and is a heavy hunting area. It is quite near, but out of sight from the tourist motor route of Rotorua and Tarawera. A side road, Ōkāreka Loop Road, gives access to it. During the late 19th century, settlers acquired some of the land around it, and built houses on Ōkāreka. Some of the frontage is still in private hands, but the greater part of the basin in which the lake lies has now become residential property.

Ōkāreka means &quot;the lake of sweet food&quot;. It was first described in print by Sir George Grey, who visited it on the course of his travels through Rotorua to Taupō in 1849–1850. The route from Ohinemutu to Tarawera was a track which skirted the shore of Ōkāreka and reached the large lake, near the mission station called Galilei. Grey&#x27;s journal reads:

Grey is also presumed to have introduced Dama Wallaby to the area around Ōkāreka, where they presently still pose a problem.

The shores of Ōkāreka were a scene of Māori life. Cultivations along the lake were common, and Māori fished the waters for whitebait, koura crayfish and toitoi, which were common species in Lake Ōkāreka before Brown trout was introduced. In the 1860s, Alfred Domett visited Ōkāreka and Tarawera, following a similar path to the one that Grey took.

Known for its natural environment, this lake has an adjacent settlement of approximately 600 people. The lake is accessible from the tourist location of Rotorua. The forest nearby to Lake Ōkāreka extends to the western side of Lake Okataina and the Whakapoungakau Range.

==Pollution==
Lake Ōkāreka has reasonably clear, clean water and is used extensively for recreation such as boating, swimming and fishing. However, the quality of the water has been declining over recent years due to excess levels of nitrogen and phosphorus. These nutrients come from surrounding farmland, residential septic tanks and from the release of existing and accumulated nutrients from sediments on the lake bed.

The Lake Ōkāreka Catchment Management Plan was developed in 2004. This is a long-term plan to improve the water quality of the 
lake, through changes like sewage reticulation, in-lake chemical treatment and farm nutrient management. It has been calculated that 
the load nutrients needed to reach the target TLI of 3.0 are 2.5 tonnes per year of nitrogen and 0.08 tonnes per year of phosphorus.

The trophic level index (TLI) is an overall indication of lake health based on a number of different criteria, values represent a three-yearly average. Better quality sites have a lower TLI. The three-yearly average for Ōkāreka indicates little change over the last five years, being 3.3 in 2014.

==Lake Okareka township==
The township on the shores of Lake Ōkareka is described by Statistics New Zealand as a rural settlement, and covers . It had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2. Lake Okareka township is part of the larger Kaingaroa-Whakarewarewa statistical area.
Before the 2023 census, the settlement had a larger boundary, covering . Using that boundary, Lake Okareka had a population of 519 at the 2018 New Zealand census, a decrease of 18 people (−3.4%) since the 2013 census, and unchanged since the 2006 census. There were 183 households, comprising 255 males and 258 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.99 males per female, with 102 people (19.7%) aged under 15 years, 75 (14.5%) aged 15 to 29, 246 (47.4%) aged 30 to 64, and 87 (16.8%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 94.2% European/Pākehā, 10.4% Māori, 2.3% Pacific peoples, 1.7% Asian, and 1.2% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 54.9% had no religion, 38.2% were Christian and 0.6% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 186 (44.6%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 36 (8.6%) people had no formal qualifications. 126 people (30.2%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 210 (50.4%) people were employed full-time, 75 (18.0%) were part-time, and 9 (2.2%) were unemployed.

<text>An automotive battery, or car battery, is a rechargeable battery that is used to start a motor vehicle. 

Its main purpose is to provide an electric current to the electric-powered starting motor, which in turn starts the chemically-powered internal combustion engine that actually propels the vehicle. Once the engine is running, power for the car&#x27;s electrical systems is still supplied by the battery, with the alternator charging the battery as demands increase or decrease.

==Battery in modern cars==

===Gasoline and diesel engine===
Typically, starting uses less than three percent of the battery capacity. For this reason, automotive batteries are designed to deliver maximum current for a short period of time. They are sometimes referred to as &quot;SLI batteries&quot; for this reason, for starting, lighting and ignition. SLI batteries are not designed for deep discharging, and a full discharge can reduce the battery&#x27;s lifespan.

As well as starting the engine, an SLI battery supplies the extra power necessary when the vehicle&#x27;s electrical requirements exceed the supply from the charging system. It is also a stabilizer, evening out potentially damaging voltage spikes. While the engine is running most of the power is provided by the alternator, which includes a voltage regulator to keep the output between 13.5 and 14.5 V. Modern SLI batteries are lead-acid type, using six series-connected cells to provide a nominal 12-volt system (in most passenger vehicles and light trucks), or twelve cells for a 24-volt system in heavy trucks or earth-moving equipment, for example.

Gas explosions can occur at the negative electrode where hydrogen gas can build up due to blocked battery vents or a poorly ventilated setting, combined with an ignition source. Explosions during engine start-up are typically associated with corroded or dirty battery posts. A 1993 study by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said that 31% of vehicle battery explosion injuries occurred while charging the battery. The next-most common scenarios were while working on cable connections, while jump-starting, typically by failing to connect to the dead battery before the charging source and failing to connect to the vehicle chassis rather than directly to the grounded battery post, and while checking fluid levels. Close to two-thirds of those injured suffered chemical burns, and nearly three-fourths suffered eye injuries, among other possible injuries.

===Electric and hybrid cars===
Electric vehicles (EVs) are powered by a high-voltage electric vehicle battery, but they usually have an automotive battery as well, so that they can use standard automotive accessories which are designed to run on 12 V. They are often referred to as &quot;auxiliary batteries.&quot;

Unlike conventional, internal combustion engined vehicles, EVs don&#x27;t charge the auxiliary battery with an alternator—instead, they use a DC-to-DC converter to step down the high voltage to the required float-charge voltage (typically around 14 V).

Further, an electric vehicle does not have a starter motor, thus needs only a limited amount of power and energy from its auxiliary battery. As such, Tesla introduced in 2021 a lithium-ion auxiliary battery storing only 99 Wh of energy.

==History==
Early cars did not have batteries, as their electrical systems were limited. Electric power for the ignition was provided by a magneto, the engine was started with a crank, headlights were gas-powered and a bell or bulb-horn was used instead of an electric horn. Car batteries became widely used around 1920 as cars became equipped with electric starter motors.

The first starting and charging systems were designed to be 6-volt and positive-ground systems, with the vehicle&#x27;s chassis directly connected to the positive battery terminal. Today, almost all road vehicles have a negative ground system. The negative battery terminal is connected to the car&#x27;s chassis.

The Hudson Motor Car Company was the first to use a standardized battery in 1918 when they started using Battery Council International batteries. BCI is the organization that sets the dimensional standards for batteries.

Cars used 6 V electrical systems and batteries until the mid-1950s. The changeover from 6 to 12 V happened when bigger engines with higher compression ratios required more electrical power to start. Smaller cars, which required less power to start stayed with 6 V longer, for example the Volkswagen Beetle in the mid-1960s and the Citroën 2CV in 1970. 

The AGM sealed battery (for automobiles), which did not require refilling, was invented in 1971.

In the 1990s a 42V electrical system standard was proposed. It was intended to allow more powerful electrically driven accessories, and lighter automobile wiring harnesses. However, the availability of higher-efficiency motors, new wiring techniques, and digital controls, and a focus on hybrid vehicle systems that use high-voltage starter/generators have largely eliminated the push for switching the main automotive voltages.

In 2023 Tesla started deliveries of their Cybertruck that uses a 48-volt electrical system, reducing 70% of the wiring in the vehicle.

==Design==
An automobile battery is an example of a wet cell battery, with six cells. Each cell of a lead storage battery consists of alternate plates made of a lead alloy grid filled with sponge lead plates (cathode) or coated with lead dioxide (anode). Each cell is filled with a sulfuric acid solution, which is the electrolyte. Initially, cells each had a filler cap, through which the electrolyte level could be viewed and which allowed water to be added to the cell. The filler cap had a small vent hole which allowed hydrogen gas generated during charging to escape from the cell.

The cells are connected by short heavy straps from the positive plates of one cell to the negative plates of the adjacent cell. A pair of heavy terminals, plated with lead to resist corrosion, are mounted at the top, sometimes the side, of the battery. Early auto batteries used hard rubber cases and wooden plate separators. Modern units use plastic cases and woven sheets to prevent the plates of a cell from touching and short-circuiting.

In the past, auto batteries required regular inspection and maintenance to replace water that was decomposed during the operation of the battery. &quot;Low-maintenance&quot; (sometimes called &quot;zero-maintenance&quot;) batteries use a different alloy for the plate elements, reducing the amount of water decomposed on charging. A modern battery may not require additional water over its useful life; some types eliminate the individual filler caps for each cell. A weakness of these batteries is that they are very intolerant of deep discharge, such as when the car battery is completely drained by leaving the lights on. This coats the lead plate electrodes with lead sulfate deposits and can reduce the battery&#x27;s lifespan by a third or more.

VRLA batteries, also known as absorbed glass mat (AGM) batteries are more tolerant of deep discharge but are more expensive. VRLA batteries do not permit addition of water to the cell. The cells each have an automatic pressure release valve, to protect the case from rupture on severe overcharge or internal failure. A VRLA battery cannot spill its electrolyte which makes it particularly useful in vehicles such as motorcycles.

Batteries are typically made of six galvanic cells in a series circuits. Each cell provides 2.1 volts for a total of 12.6 volts at full charge. During discharge, at the negative (lead) terminal a chemical reaction releases electrons to the external circuit, and at the positive (lead oxide) terminal another chemical reaction absorbs electrons from the external circuit. This drives the electrons through the external circuit wire (an electrical conductor) to produce an electric current (electricity). As the battery discharges, the acid of the electrolyte reacts with the materials of the plates, changing their surface to lead sulfate. When the battery is recharged, the chemical reaction is reversed: the lead sulfate reforms into lead dioxide. With the plates restored to their original condition, the process may be repeated.

Some vehicles use other starter batteries. For weight savings, the 2010 Porsche 911 GT3 RS has a lithium-ion battery as an option; from 2018 onward, all Kia Niro conventional hybrids feature one as well. Heavy vehicles may have two batteries in series for a 24V system or may have series-parallel groups of batteries supplying 24V.

==Specifications==

===Physical format===
Batteries are grouped by physical size, type and placement of the terminals, and mounting style. Battery Council International (BCI) group size specifies a battery&#x27;s physical dimensions, such as length, width, and height. These groups are determined by the organization.

===Amp hours (Ah)===
Ampere hours (Ah or A·h) is a unit related to the energy storage capacity of the battery. This rating is required by law in Europe.

The ampere hour rating is generally defined as the product of (the current a battery can provide for 20 hours at a constant rate, at 80 degrees F (26.6 °C), while the voltage drops to a cut-off of 10.5 volts) times 20 hours. In theory, at 80 degrees F, a 100 Ah battery should be able to continuously provide 5 amps for 20 hours while maintaining a voltage of at least 10.5 volts. The relationship between the Ah capacity and the discharge rate is not linear; as the discharge rate is increased, the capacity decreases. A battery with a 100 Ah rating generally will not be able to maintain a voltage above 10.5 volts for 10 hours while being discharged at constant rate of 10 amps. Capacity also decreases with temperature.

===Cranking amperages (CCA, CA, MCA, HCA)===
* Cold cranking amperes (CCA): the amount of current a battery can provide at for 30 seconds while maintaining a voltage of at least 7.2 volts. Modern cars with computer-controlled fuel-injected engines take no more than a few seconds to start and CCA figures are less important than they used to be. It is important not to confuse CCA with CA/MCA or HCA numbers as the latter will always be higher due to warmer temperatures. For example, a 250 CCA battery will have more starting power than a 250 CA (or MCA) one, and likewise a 250 CA will have more than a 250 HCA one.
* Cranking amperes (CA): the amount of current a battery can provide at , again for 30 seconds at a voltage equal to, or greater than, 7.2 volts.
* Marine cranking amperes (MCA): like CA, the amount of current a battery can provide at , and often found on batteries for boats (hence &quot;marine&quot;) and lawn garden tractors which are less likely to be operated in conditions where ice can form.
* Hot cranking amperes (HCA) is the amount of current a battery can provide at . The rating is defined as the current a lead-acid battery at that temperature can deliver for 30 seconds and maintain at least 1.2 volts per cell (7.2 volts for a 12-volt battery).

===Date codes===
* In the United States there are codes on batteries that indicate when they were manufactured. When batteries are stored, they start losing their charge; this is due to non-current-producing chemical reactions of the electrodes with the battery acid. A battery made in October 2015 will have a numeric code of 10-5 or an alphanumeric code of K-5. &quot;A&quot; is for January, &quot;B&quot; is for February, and so on; the letter &quot;I&quot; is skipped.
* In South Africa the code on a battery to indicate production date is part of the casing and cast into the bottom left of the cover. The code is year and week number (YYWW), e.g. 1336 is for week 36 in the year 2013.

==Use and maintenance==
Excess heat is a main cause of battery failures, as when the electrolyte evaporates due to high temperatures, decreasing the effective surface area of the plates exposed to the electrolyte, and leading to sulfation. Grid corrosion rates increase with temperature. Also low temperatures can lead to battery failure.

If the battery is discharged to the point where it can&#x27;t start the engine, the engine can be jump started via an external source of power. Once running, the engine can recharge the battery, if the alternator and charging system are undamaged.

Corrosion at the battery terminals can prevent a car from starting due to electrical resistance, which can be prevented by the proper application of dielectric grease.

Sulfation is when the electrodes become coated with a hard layer of lead sulfate, which weakens the battery. Sulfation can happen when battery is not fully charged and remains discharged. Sulfated batteries should be charged slowly to prevent damage.

SLI batteries (starting, lighting, and ignition) are not designed for deep discharge, and their life is reduced when subjected to this.

Starting batteries have plates designed for increased surface area and thus high instant current capability, whereas marine (hybrid) and deep cycle types will have thicker plates and more room at the bottom of the plates for spent plate material to gather before shorting the cell.

Car batteries using lead-antimony plates require regular topping-up with pure water to replace water lost due to electrolysis and evaporation. By changing the alloying element to calcium, more recent designs have reduced the rate of water loss. Modern car batteries have reduced maintenance requirements, and may not provide caps for addition of water to the cells. Such batteries include extra electrolyte above the plates to allow for losses during the battery life.

Some battery manufacturers include a built-in hydrometer to show the state of charge of the battery.

The primary wear-out mechanism is the shedding of active material from the battery plates, which accumulates at the bottom of the cells and which may eventually short-circuit the plates. This can be substantially reduced by enclosing one set of plates in plastic separator bags, made from a permeable material. This allows the electrolyte and ions to pass through but keeps the sludge build up from bridging the plates. The sludge largely consists of lead sulfate, which is produced at both electrodes.

==Environmental impact==
Battery recycling of automotive batteries reduces the need for resources required for the manufacture of new batteries, diverts toxic lead from landfills, and prevents the risk of improper disposal. Once a lead–acid battery ceases to hold a charge, it is deemed a used lead-acid battery (ULAB), which is classified as hazardous waste under the Basel Convention. The 12-volt car battery is the most recycled product in the world, according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency. In the U.S. alone, about 100 million auto batteries a year are replaced, and 99 percent of them are turned in for recycling. However, the recycling may be done incorrectly in unregulated environments. As part of global waste trade, ULABs are shipped from industrialized countries to developing countries for disassembly and recuperation of the contents. About 97 percent of the lead can be recovered. Pure Earth estimates that over 12 million people in developing countries are affected by lead contamination from ULAB processing.

<doc id="1164346" wikidata="Q1801031" url="?curid=1164346" title="Lake Ōkataina">
<text>Lake Ōkataina (also spelled Okataina; or ) is the northernmost and largest of four smaller lakes lying between Lake Rotorua and Lake Tarawera in the Bay of Plenty Region of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. The others are Lake Rotokakahi (Green Lake), Lake Tikitapu (Blue Lake), and Lake Ōkareka. All lie within the Ōkataina caldera, along its western edge.

==Geography==
Unlike many other lakes in the region, Lake Ōkataina is completely encircled by native forest. Over the past 30 years, the level of the lake has risen and fallen in a range of about 5 metres. The mean autumn lake level is .

The lake can be accessed by road via Hinehopu on the southern shores of Lake Rotoiti. At the end of the road there is a large sandy beach, a massive grassed area and the privately owned Okataina Lodge. Due to changes in the surface level of the lake, the lodge jetty has at times been either completely submerged or left high and dry.

On its south-western arm is a small island, Motuwhetero Island.

===Water Flow===
The lake is feed by multiple unnamed and often transient streams with a total catchment precipitation inflow average of . The only named streams that empty into the lake are the Herupapaoa Stream and Pukahu Streams. The Te Rereoterangi Stream joins the permanent Herupapaoa Stream before it enters the lake. The lake has no surface outflow and a outflow to Lake Tarawera of has been estimated.

===Geology===
It is located in the Ōkataina Caldera and some of its south-eastern shore has discoloured hot water sources in the lake. The western shore is underlaid by Mamaku ignimbrite from the Rotorua Caldera eruption of 240,000 years ago. The rest of the lake catchment has rhyolite formations from Ōkataina eruptions.

After the 1886 eruption of Mount Tarawera the lake level increased, to a maximum height about 1930 which dropped to present levels after the 1931 Hawke&#x27;s Bay earthquake. The lake is now about above its pre 1886 level.

==Culture== 
The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of &quot;place of laughter&quot; for &quot;Ōkataina&quot;. The lake and surrounds were occupied by the Ngāti Tarāwhai iwi.

Te Koutu Pā was located on the north-east shore of Lake Ōkataina. The carved entrance gate, is to be found in the Auckland War Memorial Museum.

Because of war raids before 1886, and flooding after 1886, the previous sites of occupation on the lake shore were abandoned by the Māori Ngāti Tarāwhai inhabitants. Both a drowned Pā and shrine has been found. A palisade post found under water near Motuwhetero Island confirms that the older low lake level had been present for at least about 100 years before the eruption. Rock art in the form of a canoe in red ochre has been described.

==Ecology==

The lake is surrounded by pristine virgin native forest and has good fishing for rainbow trout.

The area around the Okataina Lodge is heavily populated by tammar wallabies introduced from Australia in the 19th century. It is known that these have impacted on the seedling layer of the forest, drastically reducing seedling density and diversity, and causing the disappearance of preferred food species. The local red deer prevent seedlings from maturing into saplings and the combined effect has been a profound depletion of the forest under storey.

Its trophic level index was 2.7 in 2014, being the lowest of the Ōkataina Caldera lakes.

<text>Michael Eugene Sodrel (born December 17, 1945) is an American politician and businessman who served as a member of the United States House of Representatives for Indiana&#x27;s 9th congressional district from 2005 to 2007. Sodrel launched another run against incumbent Democratic Rep. Baron Hill in 2010 – his fifth straight run for Congress in the ninth district. However, he lost the Republican nomination to Bloomington attorney Todd Young, who won the general election.

In 2022, after a twelve-year political retirement, Sodrel announced he was running for his old seat in the 2022 United States House of Representatives elections in Indiana. He would lose the Republican primary to State Senator Erin Houchin.

==Early life==
Born in Louisville, Kentucky, Sodrel grew up across the Ohio River in New Albany, Indiana. He graduated New Albany High School in 1963. Sodrel attended Indiana University Southeast in New Albany, Indiana.

== Career ==
From 1966 to 1973, Sodrel served in the 151st Infantry Regiment of the Indiana National Guard. He was honorably discharged with the rank of staff sergeant. Since 1963, Sodrel has worked at his family&#x27;s business, Sodrel Truck Lines Inc. He founded the Free Enterprise System Inc. (a charter motor-coach/contract passenger-carrier) and Sodrel Logistics.

Sodrel is the author of an internet book, &quot;Citizen Sheep Government Shepherds&quot;.

=== U.S. House of Representatives ===

Sodrel served as a member of the United States House Committee on Agriculture, United States House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, United States House Committee on Small Business, and United States House Committee on Science.

During his term, Sodrel opposed partial-birth abortions and federal funding for elective abortions. He opposed additional environmental regulations. He has outspokenly supported the right to bear arms. He has a 92 lifetime rating from the American Conservative Union, and a zero rating from the League of Conservation Voters. He is in favor of permanently repealing the federal estate tax.

In 2006 Sodrel introduced a bill that would prevent federal courts from ruling on the content of speech in state legislatures. The proposal came as a response to U.S. District Judge David Hamilton&#x27;s ruling that official Indiana House proceedings could not begin with sectarian prayers that advanced any particular religion.

==Political campaigns==
Sodrel has campaigned on a platform of creating and protecting jobs, lowering taxes and values. He drives his own 18-wheeler on the campaign trail. He first ran for the House of Representatives in 2002, losing to incumbent Baron Hill, 51% to 46%. In the 2004 rematch, he defeated Hill by 1,428 votes.

===2006===
Sodrel faced Hill again in the 2006 general election. The Cook Political Report, an independent nonpartisan newsletter, rated the race as a toss-up.

President George W. Bush came to a Sodrel fundraiser in Indianapolis early in 2006, while his opponent gained help in Indianapolis with fundraisers from former President Bill Clinton.

Sodrel ultimately lost his bid for re-election by a margin of 45% to 50%. The candidates raised equivalent funds in 2006.

Texas millionaire Bob J. Perry gave more than $5 million to the Economic Freedom Fund, a 527 group, which included Hill as one of its targets for removal. The group paid for automated &quot;push poll&quot; calls attacking Hill. These calls stopped after action by the Indiana Attorney General.

===2008===

In October 2007 Sodrel announced that he would run again in 2008 for the Congressional seat against Baron Hill, whom he defeated in 2004 but to whom he lost in 2002 and 2006.
In 2006 Cook rated the race as a toss-up for the duration of the race, but in 2008 the race moved between Likely D to Lean D on the Cook Political Report.
Sodrel&#x27;s fundraising was weak compared both to Hill and Sodrel&#x27;s 2006 figures.

Hill defeated Sodrel in the election, 58% to 39%.

===2010===

On January 11, 2010, at an event in Jeffersonville, Indiana, Mike Sodrel announced that he would again seek the 2010 Republican nomination for the 9th congressional seat. He joined two other candidates in the field of Republican contenders: Bloomington attorney Todd Young (a native of Carmel, Indiana) and Columbus real-estate investor Travis Hankins. A poll published by the left-leaning weblog Firedoglake showed Sodrel leading Hill 49–41 in a head-to-head race. However he lost the Republican nomination, coming in third place behind Travis Hankins and winner Todd Young. Young won the general election against Hill.

=== 2022 ===

On February 8, 2022, Sodrel announced that he would once again seek the Republican nomination for the ninth district after three-term representative Trey Hollingsworth announced his retirement. Sodrel was one of nine Republicans seeking the nomination in the district. Sodrel would come in second in the primary to State Senator Erin Houchin, who would go on to succeed Hollingsworth as Congressperson for the ninth district.

==Electoral history==

Write-in and minor candidate notes: In 2006, Donald W. Mantooth received 33 votes.
==Personal life==
In 1967, Sodrel married Marquita Dean; they have two children and seven granddaughters. Sodrel has served on numerous charitable organization&#x27;s board of directors, including the Remnant Trust and as a past regional council president of the Boy Scouts of America.

<text>Acosmium is a South America genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. Three species are currently recognized. Most &quot;Acosmium&quot; species have been recently transferred to &quot;Leptolobium&quot; and one species to the South American &quot;Guianodendron&quot; while the genus &quot;Acosmium&quot; itself has been transferred from the tribe Sophoreae to the tribe Dalbergieae in a monophyletic clade informally known as the &quot;Pterocarpus&quot; clade.

<text>Tonite Lets All Make Love in London is a soundtrack album released on LP in 1968, for the 1967 documentary film of the same name, made by Peter Whitehead about the &quot;swinging London&quot; scene of the sixties. The film consists of a series of psychedelic performances and interviews and features live performance by Pink Floyd, together with footage of John Lennon, Yoko Ono, Mick Jagger, Vanessa Redgrave, Lee Marvin, Julie Christie, Allen Ginsberg, Eric Burdon, Michael Caine and many others attending one of the band&#x27;s concerts.

==Reissues==
In 1990 See for Miles Records released an expanded version of the soundtrack on CD under the title &quot;Tonite Let&#x27;s All Make Love in London ...Plus&quot; (Catalog Number: SEEK 258). The album included most of the tracks from &quot;Tonite Let&#x27;s All Make Love in London&quot;. Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow? and Lady Jane by the Rolling Stones is featured in the movie but not on any version of the soundtrack album. &quot;Interstellar Overdrive&quot; which had only appeared in a 3.02 edited form on the original release was replaced by the previously unreleased 16:46 full-length version. Another long and previously unreleased instrumental track by Pink Floyd, the 11:50 &quot;Nick&#x27;s Boogie&quot;, was also included in this release, together with the interviews that appear in the film.

Other versions of this soundtrack have also been released. In 1996, Power House 2001 Records released a CD under the name, &quot;Pink Floyd &amp; Friends – Interstellar Overdrive&quot; that included the full 16:49 &quot;Interstellar Overdrive&quot; and &quot;Nick&#x27;s Boogie&quot; (at 11:47) by Pink Floyd, plus an interview with Mick Jagger and an introductory reading by Allen Ginsberg called &quot;Tonight Let&#x27;s All Make Love in London&quot;. However, there are other tracks by Fleetwood Mac, the Nice, the Moody Blues and others that did not appear on the original album or the See for Miles reissue. In 1998 both of the full extended Pink Floyd tracks were released as a bonus disc in the book &quot;The Progressive Rock Files&quot; by Canadian radio host Jerry Lucky. 

To help promote &quot;Tonite Let&#x27;s All Make Love in London...Plus&quot;, the interviews with Michael Caine and Lee Marvin and the two extended instrumental tracks, &quot;Nick&#x27;s Boogie&quot; and &quot;Interstellar Overdrive&quot;, were also released as a Pink Floyd CD. While the sleeve for the Pink Floyd release of &quot;Tonite Let&#x27;s All Make Love in London...Plus&quot; states &#x27;Mini Promotion – CD Sampler&#x27; this item was in fact a full release and was available for sale in many independent record stores. The interviews are also as one track, thus the CD has three tracks, although the booklet incorrectly lists the interviews as two separate tracks.

<doc id="1164367" wikidata="Q727809" url="?curid=1164367" title="St. Peter's Church, Riga">
<text>St. Peter&#x27;s Church (, ) is a Lutheran church in Riga, the capital of Latvia, dedicated to Saint Peter. It is a parish church of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Latvia.

==History==
First mention of the St. Peter&#x27;s Church is in records dating to 1209. The church was of masonry construction and therefore undamaged by a city fire in Riga that year. The history of the church can be divided into three distinct periods: two associated with Gothic and Romanesque building styles and the third with the early Baroque period. The middle section of the church was built during the 13th century, which encompasses the first period. The only remnants of this period are located in the outer nave walls and on the inside of a few pillars in the nave, around which larger pillars were later built.

===Second period of construction===
The second period dates to 1408–09, when master builder from Rostock supervised the construction of the sanctuary, based on the St. Mary&#x27;s Church in Rostock. The sanctuary was almost finished by 1409, but due to the Polish–Lithuanian–Teutonic War it was completed and dedicated only in 1419. Other construction work was interrupted by the plague in 1420 and resumed in the 1430s. The 13th-century church was reconstructed in 1456–66 to conform to the newly built sanctuary. Both constructions were joined in the 1470s, thereby creating a mighty basilica with three aisles and ornate vaulted ceilings. The old bell tower was replaced in 1456, and a bell was hung in the new tower in 1477. A octagonal steeple was added to the tower in 1491, which, along with the church&#x27;s front facade, dominated the silhouette of Riga. The tower collapsed 11 March 1666, destroying a neighboring building and burying eight people in the rubble. The cornerstone for a new tower was laid 29 June 1667.
===Third period of construction===
The third period of construction dates to 1671–90, with the construction of the western facade and the new tower. The roof, vaulted ceilings and furnishings were also renovated during this time. Jacob Josten, the Dutch-born master builder of Riga, designed the tower and supervised its construction, which was begun April 1671 by the master mason Heinrich Henicke. Josten was replaced in 1675 by (&quot;1645–1698&quot;), the next master builder of Riga. The tower was completed in 1677, but it, along with the church interior, were destroyed already 21 May 1677, during a citywide fire. Bindenshu supervised the subsequent repairs in 1677–79: vaulted wooden ceilings replaced the former masonry vaulted ceilings, and the roof, windows, interior and furnishings were replaced or renovated. First service in the renovated church took place 14 September 1679.
Renovation of the tower began 1686 and was designed by the city engineer Friedrich S. von Dahlen. The city council did not approve of the half-finished steeple, and so it was torn down in 1688. A new copper-roofed steeple, designed by Bindenshu, was then built. A sphere and rooster were set atop the steeple 10 May 1690. This tower was the tallest wooden construction in Europe at the time.
The western facade of the church was also altered in the later 17th century. The brick construction was covered with reddish limestone from Salaspils and Koknese, and the facade was decorated with volutes, pilasters, cornices, vases and borders made of Gotland stone. In 1692 the Riga City Council approved a design by Bindenshu and the mason Andreas Peterman for three identical portals. The merchant Klaus Mistett financed the portals, which were built by H. Henneken, Johann Daniel Schauss, Johann Gerwin and several other sculptors. The portals were decorated with Baroque style limestone sculptures. In 1694 L. Martini installed a new tower clock with a glockenspiel from Amsterdam.

===First reconstruction===
The newly renovated church served for a mere 29 years, for lightning struck and set fire to the tower and church 10 May 1721. Only the church and tower walls remained standing after the fire. Reconstruction of the church began immediately under the direction of the master carpenter Tom Bochum and master mason Kristofer Meinert. By 1723 the building already had a temporary roof. Johann Heinrich Wilbern took over supervision of the project in 1740, and under his direction a new steeple was built in 1746. The steeple was covered with copper-plate and the rooster was gilded in 1746–47.
Christoph Haberland designed a new marble pulpit for the church, which was built in Italy in 1793. In 1794 Haberland renovated the wooden vaulted ceilings in the central sections of the nave. The interior walls were plastered and the lower sections of the pillars were covered with oak panels in 1885 under the direction of architect Reinhold Georg Schmaeling (&quot;1840–1917&quot;).

===Second reconstruction===

Artillery fire destroyed the church on 29 June 1941. Conservation and restoration began 1954 with research by architect Pēteris Saulītis. The work was carried out from 1967 to 1983 under the direction of Saulītis and architect Gunārs Zirnis. Renovation began with the metal tower frame. A rooster – a precise reproduction of the previous rooster and the seventh rooster in all – was placed atop the steeple 21 August 1970. The renovated tower clock began to show time in July 1975. According to tradition, it has only an hour hand. The bell music began in 1976; it plays the Latvian folk melody &quot;&quot;Rīga dimd&quot; five times a day and bells ring at the top of every hour. The tower has an elevator installed that allows visitors a view of Riga from a height of . Renovation of the interior of the church ended in 1984. The Polish company &quot;PKZ&quot;&quot; restored the main facade and portals in 1987–91. The St. Peter&#x27;s Latvian Lutheran congregation resumed services in the church 1991, and the church was returned to the ownership of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Latvia on 4 April 2006.

During World War II, the church lost an important object of cultural heritage - an impressive bronze candelabrum made in 1596 - which was taken to the town of Włocławek by Germans from Riga, resettled during &quot;Heim ins Reich&quot; action to annexed Polish territories. The 310 cm high and 378 cm wide candelabrum, previously called a standing lantern, was ordered by the City Council of Riga from the metal founder Hans Meyer&#x27;s Riga foundry. After the war, it was displayed in Włocławek&#x27;s Basilica Cathedral of the St. Mary of Assumption. On 1 March 2012 this piece of the Late Renaissance art returned to its ancient home, as a result of an agreement on the repatriation of cultural properties. The statue of the rooster on the top of the church weighs 158 kg and 140 grams of gold were used to gold plate the statue.

<text>A Little Princess is a children&#x27;s novel by Frances Hodgson Burnett, first published as a book in 1905. It is an expanded version of the short story &quot;Sara Crewe: or, What Happened at Miss Minchin&#x27;s&quot;, which was serialized in &quot;St. Nicholas Magazine&quot; from December 1887, and published in book form in 1888. According to Burnett, after she composed the 1902 play &quot;A Little Un-fairy Princess&quot; based on that story, her publisher asked that she expand the story as a novel with &quot;the things and people that had been left out before&quot;. The novel was published by Charles Scribner&#x27;s Sons (also publisher of &quot;St. Nicholas Magazine&quot;) with illustrations by Ethel Franklin Betts and the full title &quot;A Little Princess: Being the Whole Story of Sara Crewe Now Being Told for the First Time&quot;.

==Plot==
Captain Ralph Crewe, a wealthy English widower, has been raising his only child, a daughter named Sara, in India where he is stationed with the British Army. Because the Indian climate is considered too harsh for their children, British families living there traditionally send their children to boarding school back home in England. The Captain enrolls his seven-year-old daughter at an all-girls boarding school in London and dotes on his daughter so much that he orders and pays the haughty headmistress, Miss Minchin, for special treatment and exceptional luxuries for Sara, such as a private room for her with a personal maid and a separate sitting room (see parlour boarder), along with Sara&#x27;s own private carriage and a pony. Miss Minchin openly fawns over Sara for her money, but is secretly envious and dislikes Sara almost from the outset.

Intelligent, imaginative and kind, Sara sees through flattery and remains unspoiled; she embraces the status of a &#x27;princess&#x27; accorded by the other students, and lives up to it with her compassion and generosity. She befriends Ermengarde, the school dunce; Lottie, a four-year-old student given to tantrums; and Becky, the stunted scullery maid.

Four years later, Sara&#x27;s eleventh birthday is celebrated at Miss Minchin&#x27;s with a lavish party. Just as it ends, Miss Minchin learns of Captain Crewe&#x27;s unfortunate demise due to jungle fever. Furthermore, the previously wealthy captain has lost his entire fortune, investing in a friend&#x27;s diamond mines. Preteen Sara is left an orphan and a pauper with nowhere to go. Miss Minchin is left with a sizable debt for Sara&#x27;s school fees and luxuries, including her birthday party. Infuriated and pitiless, she takes away all of Sara&#x27;s possessions (except for an old black frock and her doll, Emily), and makes her live in a cold and poorly furnished attic, forcing her to earn her keep by working as a servant.

For the next two years Miss Minchin starves and overworks Sara, turning her into a menial servant and unpaid tutor, with the prospect of turning her into an under-paid teacher when she is old enough. Most of the students take their tone from Miss Minchin, but Sara is consoled by her few friends and uses her imagination to cope with her bleak existence. She continues to be kind and polite to everyone, even her abusers, in the belief that conduct, not money, make a true princess. On one of the bleakest days when she herself is ravenous, she finds a coin and buys six buns, but gives a starving beggar-child five of them.

During this time Mr. Carrisford moves into the house next to the seminary. He is an extremely wealthy invalid come from abroad and retains Mr. Carmichael, a solicitor who lives nearby. Sara has often observed Mr. Carmichael&#x27;s big and loving family, whom she has dubbed the &quot;Large Family&quot; – while they are equally curious about her and call her &quot;the little girl who is not a beggar&quot;.

Mr. Carrisford is revealed to have been Captain Crewe&#x27;s partner in the diamond mine venture. Thinking all was lost and both suffering from severe illness, Carrisford abandoned Captain Crewe and wandered in a delirium. When he recovered, it was to find Crewe dead – and the mines a reality. Extremely rich but suffering both ill health and pangs of conscience, he returns to England and makes it his mission to find Sara, though he does not know where to look.

Meanwhile Ram Dass, Mr Carrisford&#x27;s Indian servant, climbs across the roof to retrieve a pet monkey which has taken refuge in Sara&#x27;s attic. He sees the poor condition of her room and, touched by her courtesy and demeanor, sets out to discover her history. To distract his master from his own sorrows, he tells Mr Carrisford about the &quot;little girl in the attic&quot;. Between them they devise a scheme whereby Mr Carrisford becomes &quot;The Magician&quot;, a mysterious benefactor who transforms her barren existence with gifts of food and warmth and books – snuck in by Ram Dass.

One night the monkey again visits Sara&#x27;s attic, and she decides to return it to Mr. Carrisford next morning. He learns that Sara is Captain Crewe&#x27;s daughter; Sara also learns that Mr. Carrisford was her father&#x27;s friend – and The Magician.

Miss Minchin pays a visit to collect Sara, but is informed that Sara will be living with Mr. Carrisford from now on; not only is her fortune restored, she is now heiress to diamond mines. Miss Minchin tries to retrieve the situation, going so far as to threaten legal action if she does not return to the school, and that she will never see any of her friends again, but Sara refuses and Mr Carrisford is adamant. Becky becomes Sara&#x27;s personal servant and, with her newfound wealth, Sara makes a deal with a baker, proposing to cover the cost of food given to any hungry child.

==Reception==
Based on a 2007 online poll, the U.S. National Education Association listed the book as one of its &quot;Teachers&#x27; Top 100 Books for Children&quot;. In 2012 it was ranked number 56 on a list of the top 100 children&#x27;s novels published by &quot;School Library Journal&quot;.

==Source material==
The novella appears to have been inspired in part by Charlotte Brontë&#x27;s unfinished novel &quot;Emma&quot;, the first two chapters of which were published in &quot;Cornhill Magazine&quot; in 1860, featuring a rich heiress with a mysterious past who is apparently abandoned at a boarding school.

==Play==

Burnett first introduced &quot;Sara Crewe&quot; in 1888 in print. She returned to the material in 1902, penning the three-act stage play &quot;A Little Un-fairy Princess&quot;, which ran in London over the autumn of that year. Around the time it transferred to New York City at the start of 1903 the title was shortened to &quot;A Little Princess&quot;. It was &quot;A Little Princess&quot; in London, but &quot;The Little Princess&quot; in New York.

Burnett said that after the production of the play on Broadway, her publisher, Charles Scribner&#x27;s Sons, asked her to expand the story into a full-length novel and &quot;put into it all the things and people that had been left out before&quot;. The book was illustrated by Ethel Franklin Betts and published in 1905 under the full title &quot;A Little Princess: Being the Whole Story of Sara Crewe Now Being Told for the First Time&quot;.

==Adaptations==
===Film===
* 1917 version: Mary Pickford as Sara and Katherine Griffith as Miss Minchin.
* 1939 version: Shirley Temple as Sara and Mary Nash as Miss Minchin. This Technicolor adaptation notably differs from the original, in that Sara&#x27;s father is wounded and missing in action in wartime, and later is reunited with his daughter with the help of Queen Victoria. Miss Minchin&#x27;s younger sister Miss Amelia is replaced with &quot;Mr Bertie&quot;, Miss Minchin&#x27;s brother, a former music hall performer, who sings and dances with Temple. A substantial portion of the story is given over to Sara&#x27;s abetting of an illicit romance between an under-teacher and the school&#x27;s riding master, dramatized in an elaborate fairy-tale dream sequence.
* 1943 Italian version: &quot;Principessina&quot;: Rosanna Dal as Anna and Vittorina Benvenuti as the Headmistress. It is a remake of the 1939 film set in Italy, in which Sara, now renamed Anna, is the daughter of a real prince.
* &quot;Harō Kiti no shōkōjo&quot;: 1994 OVA version starring Hello Kitty produced by Sanrio.
* 1995 American version: Liesel Matthews as Sara and Eleanor Bron as Miss Minchin, this adaptation notably differs from the original and more closely resembles the 1939 version, in that Sara&#x27;s father is wounded and missing in action in wartime, and later is reunited with his daughter. Another difference is that it takes place in New York City during World War I instead of London during the Boer War, and the character of Becky, canonically Cockney, is recast as African-American. The film is directed by Alfonso Cuarón.
* 1995 Filipino version &quot;Sarah... Ang Munting Prinsesa&quot;: Camille Prats as Sara (name changed to &quot;Sarah&quot;), Angelica Panganiban as Becky, and Jean Garcia as Ms. Minchin. This adaptation was mostly based on the 1985 Japanese anime series &quot;Princess Sarah&quot;, which was hugely popular with Filipino audiences during the 1990s. The film was mostly shot in Scotland, with other scenes in Baguio, Philippines.
* 1996 version: An animated direct-to-video film produced by Blye Migicovsky and directed by Laura Shephard. As in the 1939 and 1995 film adaptations, Sara&#x27;s father is later found alive, and, like in the 1995 film, Becky is black. The voice cast includes Melissa Bathory, Lawrence Bayne, Desmond Ellis, Nonnie Griffin, Marieve Herington, Sarena Paton, Katherine Shekter, and Colette Stevenson.
* 1997 Russian film &quot;A Little Princess&quot;: Anastasiya Meskova as Sara and Alla Demidova as Miss Minchin.

===Television===
* 1973 version: Deborah Makepeace as Sara and Ruth Dunning as Miss Minchin.
* &quot;Shōkōjo Sēra&quot;: a 1978 Japanese anime version, eleven 10-minute episodes in anthology series &quot;Manga Sekai Mukashi Banashi&quot;. This adaptation is notable for the more cruel script, focused on the abuse that Sara and Becky have to suffer from Miss Minchin, school bully Lavinia and Amelia, now as mean as her sister. It also adds new characters and events while skipping over others from the novel, such as Mr. Carmichael&#x27;s family. Sara and Becky are friends with three orphaned boys that help them in several occasions, such as when Becky gets sick and Miss Minchin doesn&#x27;t want to call a doctor. Sara has a love interest in Frederick, the son of a wealthy supporter of the school. In the ending Sara and Becky are thrown out of the institute, but when they are found by Mr. Carrisford, Sara returns to the school with Becky after making a large donation to it, and make up with Lavinia.
* &quot;Princess Sara&quot;: a 1985 Japanese anime series, which was featured as part of Nippon Animation&#x27;s &quot;World Masterpiece Theater&quot; collection. The series spanned 46 episodes, including a few new characters and adventures along the way, while following pretty closely the original plot. Some of the new additions resembles the 1978 anime version: the addition of a street boy among Sara&#x27;s friends, Sara&#x27;s dangerous illness, her departure from the institute, her forgiveness for Miss Minchin and Lavinia, who is also a more prominent character here, and her huge donation to the school. Similarly to the 1978 adaptation, this version focuses more on the saddest aspects of the story, such as Miss Minchin&#x27;s abuse and Lavinia&#x27;s bullying, although in a more mildly and less violent way. Furthermore, Sara&#x27;s personality has been made significantly more obedient and kind than in the novel. Veteran Japanese voice actress Sumi Shimamoto voiced Sara Crewe.
* 1986 version: Amelia Shankley as Sara and Maureen Lipman as Miss Minchin. It is one of the most faithful adaptations, quoting many dialogues from the book and adding only a few new scenes, including a prologue set in India.
* &quot;Sōkō no Strain&quot;, a 2006 anime that completely reworks the story into a mecha series about &quot;Sara Werec&quot;, who finds herself robbed of the ability to pilot the titular Strain when her brother, Ralph, betrays and disgraces her family.
* &quot;Princess Sarah&quot;, a Filipino 2007 remake, loosely based on the popular 1985 anime but with fantasy elements.
* &quot;Shōkōjo Seira&quot;, a 2009 remake with the main character Japanese and named Seira, aged 16 when her father dies, and as an Indian Princess. Becky is changed to a male and a romantic lead. The 1985 TV series by Nippon Animation has a similar title in Japanese, although the two adaptations are not related.
* &quot;The Penniless Princess&quot; (2012), a &quot;VeggieTales&quot; episode
* &quot;A Caverna Encantada&quot;, a Brazilian telenovela produced and broadcast by SBT, created by Íris Abravanel who adapted this book and also The Secret Garden, premiered on July 29, 2024. Mel Summers as Anna Salvatore, Clarice Niskier as Director Norma and Juju Penido as Lavínia.

===Related books===
In 1995, Apple published a series of three books written by Gabrielle Charbonnet. &quot;The Princess Trilogy&quot; was an updated version of the classic, with the title character named Molly, rather than Sara. Molly Stewart&#x27;s father was a famous film director who left his daughter in a posh upscale boarding school. There were three books in the series, which ended in a similar way as the original: &quot;Molly&#x27;s Heart&quot;, &quot;The Room on the Attic&quot;, and &quot;Home at Last&quot;.

A sequel by Hilary McKay was published by Hodder Children&#x27;s Books in September 2009: &quot;Wishing for Tomorrow: The Sequel to A Little Princess&quot;. It tells the story of what happened to the rest of the boarding school girls after Sara and Becky left (&quot;life must go on at Miss Minchin&#x27;s&quot;).

In 2017 a further sequel was published by Scholastic, &quot;The Princess and the Suffragette&quot; by Holly Webb. This centres on Lottie, the smallest girl in the original story, who is now 10 and learning about the Suffragettes. Sara makes some brief appearances.

===Games===
* &quot;A Little Lily Princess&quot; is a retelling of the classic novel in visual novel form with a yuri twist. It was released for the PC in May 2016 by the independent video game developer Hanako Games.

<doc id="1164377" wikidata="Q16931133" url="?curid=1164377" title="Evangelical Alliance">
<text>The Evangelical Alliance (EA) is a UK organisation of evangelical individuals, organisations, and churches, which is itself a member of the World Evangelical Alliance. Founded in 1846, the Evangelical Alliance aims to promote evangelical Christian beliefs and advocate for evangelical Christians in politics and society. The Evangelical Alliance is based in London, with offices in Cardiff, Glasgow, Belfast and Stockport.

==History==
The Evangelical Alliance was founded in 1846 by Ridley Haim Herschell, Edward Steane, John Henderson and Sir Culling Eardley. Eardley became the organisation&#x27;s first chairperson, leading the Alliance in its various campaigns for religious freedom; in 1852, Eardley campaigned on behalf of the Tuscan prisoners of conscience Francesco Madiai and Rosa Madiai, who had been imprisoned for their Protestant faith.

== Key people ==
, the leadership of the Evangelical Alliance consisted of

*Gavin Calver, CEO (appointed in 2019)
* Peter Lynas, UK Director
* Jo Frost, Director of Communications and Engagement
* Fred Drummond, Director of Scotland
* Israel Oluwole Olofinjana, Director of the One People Commission
* John Gibson, Director of Finance and Operations
* Danny Webster, Director of Advocacy
* Hil Sewell, Director of People and Culture
* Emmie Burns, Personal Assistant to Gavin Calver

Past leaders of the Evangelical Alliance include Clive Calver (1983–1997), Joel Edwards (1997–2009) and Steve Clifford (2009–2019).

==Members==
The Evangelical Alliance is a membership organisation whose members subscribe to its Basis of Faith and are expected to relate to one another in accordance with its Relational Commitments.

, its website listed over 650 organisations, over 2,300 churches, and two corporations as members. It also has an unspecified number of individual members. Member organisations include Tearfund, an organisation originally established by the Evangelical Alliance as the Evangelical Alliance Relief Fund, and CARE (Christian Action, Research and Education).

A number of UK Members of Parliament are associated with the Evangelical Alliance, including Labour MP Stephen Timms, a member of the Alliance&#x27;s Council; Conservative MP and former Conservative Party leadership candidate Stephen Crabb, associated with the Alliance through Gweini (the Council of the Christian Voluntary Sector in Wales); and former Conservative MP for Congleton Fiona Bruce, a member of the Alliance.

==Positions==

=== Ecumenism ===
The Evangelical Alliance has historically supported ecumenism – the principle of unity between different church doctrines – with the Roman Catholic Church, an approach criticised by some as in direct contradiction to the beliefs of the Evangelical Alliance&#x27;s founders. In 2019, the Alliance supported the &#x27;Thy Kingdom Come&#x27; initiative – an event organised by the Archbishops of York and Canterbury to bring more people to Christianity through a sustained period of prayer from the dates of the Feast of the Ascension to Pentecost annually. In a 2024 report on the results of surveys it conducted in Northern Ireland, the Evangelical Alliance uncritically used the term &quot;Catholic Evangelicals&quot; to describe practising Roman Catholics who are committed to &quot;evangelisation&quot; and &quot;renewal&quot; but whose theological views do not necessarily align with the Alliance&#x27;s basis of faith.

=== Homosexuality ===

According to a 2016 &quot;Private Eye&quot; report, the Evangelical Alliance is openly opposed to homosexuality and same-sex relationships, preaching sexual abstinence for those with same-sex attractions, with membership for openly lesbian and gay people open only to those who &quot;come to see the need to be transformed&quot; from their same-sex attraction.
The Evangelical Alliance&#x27;s website distinguishes between same-sex attraction and same-sex sexual relations, calling on people who want to live within God&#x27;s purposes to renounce the latter. It states, &quot;We encourage evangelical congregations to welcome and accept sexually active lesbians and gay men. However, they should do so in the expectation that they, like all of us who are living outside God&#x27;s purposes, will come in due course to see the need to be transformed and live in accordance with biblical revelation and orthodox church teaching. We urge gentleness, patience and ongoing pastoral care during this process and after a person renounces same-sex sexual relations.&quot;

The Evangelical Alliance warned the Liz Truss government against a conversion therapy ban, warning that such a ban could end up criminalising church leaders and restrict religious freedom.

=== Abortion ===
The Evangelical Alliance calls &quot;for world-leading support, services and legislation that seeks to protect the lives and health of both women and unborn children&quot; through its Both Lives initiative, which was formerly known as Both Lives Matter. In a 2019 UK government consultation on proposed abortion legislation in Northern Ireland, the Evangelical Alliance responded &#x27;Yes&#x27; to the question, &quot;Do you agree that provision should be made for abortion without gestational time limit where: Termination is necessary to prevent grave permanent injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman or girl?&quot;.

<text>Lake Rerewhakaaitu is a small, shallow lake in northern New Zealand, located 30 kilometres to the east of Rotorua. It is immediately south of the active volcano Mount Tarawera, and the geography was substantially altered by the 1886 eruption of Mount Tarawera.

==Geography==

At a mean autumn height of above sea level the lake is highest and southernmost of the Rotorua Te Arawa lakes. Occupying a shallow basin, it is mostly surrounded by farming pasture; although over the past few decades, exotic and indigenous forest cover has begun to appear.

===Water Flow===
The lake is feed by the Awaroa and Mangakino Streams. The lake has no permanent outflow, as it is above the water table of much of the surrounding land ( by perhaps up to except at north-eastern side), but has an artificial overflow channel to the south east to control the maximum height. Also, when the lake is high, water can flow down the Mangaharakeke Stream due to these water table issues. Further the Awaroa Stream is ephemeral.

It is believed that the springs at the head of Te Kauae Stream are sourced from the lake as part of ground water outflow from its catchment into that of Lake Rotomahana to its north-west. Groundwater also flows south-east of the lake into the Rangitaiki River catchment. 
===Geology===
The lake is believed to be about 11,000 years old, having formed after the Waiohau eruption of 14,009 ± 155 years ago. The area of the lake and its catchment has multiple rhyolitic pyroclastics from Mount Tarawera eruptions. Parts of the Whakamaru Group of ignimbrite define the south-east and parts of the northern lake shore, and that massive eruption sequence of the Whakamaru Caldera was about 335,000 years ago.

The 1886 eruption of Mount Tarawera covered the lake area in tephra to a depth between . Some of the ash deposits in the catchment, particularly the even thicker ones to the north of the lake, would have been washed into the lake within a year or two as described at the time.

==Ecology==
The lake is home to 46 different bird species with nine of these classified as threatened. This includes the largest breeding population of banded dotterel in the Rotorua Ecological District.

It is stocked with introduced Rainbow trout.

The lake is classified as mesotrophic, with moderate productivity and water quality. Its trophic level index was 3.4 in 2014.

==Culture==
The shores of the lake are often the scene of dog shows, like those from Rotorua, Agility during Easter, and the obedience show in January.

===Education===
Lake Rerewhakaaitu School is a co-educational state primary school for Year 1 to 8 students, with a roll of as of .

Heath was born in McAllen, Texas. He attended Highland Park High School in University Park, Texas (a Dallas suburb), and competed for the Highland Park High School swim team. In 1980, he set a new Texas state high school record in the boys&#x27; 200-yard freestyle (1:37.88); he set a second state record in the event in 1982 (1:37.53), breaking his own previous record in the process.

== College swimming career ==

Heath accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where he swam for coach Randy Reese&#x27;s Florida Gators swimming and diving team in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and Southeastern Conference (SEC) competition from 1983 to 1986. He was a member of the Gators&#x27; 1983 and 1984 NCAA men&#x27;s championship teams, as well as four consecutive SEC championships teams. As a Gator swimmer, he won NCAA national titles in the 400-yard freestyle relay (1983), 800-yard freestyle relay (1983, 1984), and 200-yard freestyle (1984), and received nineteen All-American honors. His strong finish swimming the anchor leg for the Gators in the 4×100-yard freestyle relay provided the Gators&#x27; winning points in their first NCAA national team championship in 1983. He also won seven SEC titles, and was recognized as the SEC male swimmer of the year in 1983 and 1985. Heath graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in exercise and sports science in 1988, and was inducted into the University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame as a &quot;Gator Great&quot; in 1996.

== International swimming career ==

Heath, who had not previously been a member of the U.S. national team, won the 100- and 200-meter freestyle events at the 1984 U.S. Olympic trials, and thereby qualified to compete in the two Olympic individual events and for the U.S. relay teams. As a newcomer to the U.S. trials, he made a dramatic statement by setting a new American record in the preliminary heats of the 200-meter freestyle. At the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, he won three gold medals and a silver.

He won his first Olympic gold medal by swimming the lead-off leg in the men&#x27;s 4×200-meter freestyle relay, and Heath and his American teammates David Larson, Jeff Float and Bruce Hayes set a new world record of 7:15.69, edging the Michael Gross-led West Germans by four one-hundredths (0.04) of a second. He won his second gold medal by helping set another world record of 3:19.03 in the men&#x27;s 4×100-meter freestyle relay, together with fellow Americans Chris Cavanaugh, Matt Biondi and Rowdy Gaines, finishing sixty-five one-hundredths (0.65) of a second ahead of the second-place Australians. He then earned a third gold medal by swimming for the winning U.S. team in the preliminary heats of the 4×100-meter medley relay. In a word play on the title of the popular 1984 movie &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, American media dubbed Heath and his 4×200-meter relay teammates the &quot;Gross Busters.&quot;

In individual Olympic competition, Heath won a silver medal in the 200-meter freestyle (1:49.10) behind Gross&#x27;s world record-setting performance (1:47.44). He also placed fourth in the 100-meter freestyle event final (50.41); the outcome was controversial, however, because of a premature starter gun and a quick start by Gaines, the winner. Gaines&#x27; coach, Richard Quick, knew of starter Frank Silvestri&#x27;s propensity to fire the starter gun almost immediately when the swimmers mounted the blocks. Gaines gained about a meter&#x27;s head start on the competition; video of the event later confirmed that one or more of the swimmers had not been set when the starter gun fired.

After the 1984 Olympics, Heath continued to swim for the U.S. national team, and remained a fixture on the freestyle relay teams. At the 1985 Pan Pacific Championships in Tokyo, gold medalists Scott McCadam, Heath, Paul Wallace and Biondi set a new world record of 3:17.08 in the 4×100-meter freestyle relay. Together with Biondi, Duffy Dillon and Craig Oppel, he won another gold medal in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay (7:17.63). Individually, Heath won a Pan Pacific Championships gold medal in the 200-meter freestyle (1:49.29) by beating Biondi (1:50.19) and Canadian Sandy Goss (1:50.56). He also won a Pan Pacific silver medal in the 100-meter freestyle (50.78), finishing a fraction of a second behind Biondi (50.44). Heath again swam for the U.S. relay teams at the 1986 World Aquatics Championships in Madrid; Tom Jager, Heath, Paul Wallace and Biondi won the 4×100-meter freestyle (3:19.89); and Eric Boyer, Heath, Dan Jorgensen and Biondi placed third in the 4×200-meter freestyle (7:18.29).

== Life after competition swimming ==

Heath was an assistant coach for the Florida Gators swim team from 1988 to 1989. After graduating from the University of Florida, Heath first worked as a salesman, before he coached swimming for Beaches Aquatic Club in Neptune Beach, Florida, for six years, and thereafter at Episcopal High School in Jacksonville, Florida. He is married to Sherri-Lee Schricker, who was a member of the Florida Gators swim team at the University of Florida from 1984 to 1987, and they have two children. Their son Grady will swim for the Florida Gators beginning in 2015–16.

<text>The House of the Seven Gables (also known as the Turner House or Turner-Ingersoll Mansion) is a 1668 colonial mansion in Salem, Massachusetts, named for its gables. It was made famous by Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s 1851 novel &quot;The House of the Seven Gables&quot;. The house is now a non-profit museum, with an admission fee charged for tours, as well as an active settlement house with programs for the local immigrant community including ESL and citizenship classes. It was built for Captain John Turner and stayed with the family for three generations.

==The house==

The earliest section of the House of the Seven Gables was built in 1668 for Captain John Turner, a wealthy sea captain and merchant who was born in Salem, Massachusetts in 1644. Turner partially funded the house&#x27;s construction through his business of selling fish to slave plantations in the West Indies. The property remained in his family&#x27;s possession for three generations, descending from John Turner II to John Turner III. Facing south towards Salem Harbor, it was originally a two-room, -story house with a projecting front porch and a massive central chimney. This portion now forms the middle of the house. Four windows of the original ground-floor room (which became a dining room) remain in the house&#x27;s side wall.

A few years later, a kitchen lean-to and a new north kitchen ell to the rear of the house were added. By 1676, Turner had added a spacious south (front) extension with its own chimney, containing a parlor on the ground floor, with a large bed chamber above it. Ceilings in this new wing are higher than the very low ceilings in older parts of the house. The new wing featured double casement windows and an overhang with carved pendants; it was capped with a three-gabled garret.

In the first half of the 18th century, John Turner II remodeled the house in the new Georgian style, adding wood paneling and sash windows. These alterations are preserved, very early examples of Georgian decor. The House of the Seven Gables is one of the oldest surviving timber-framed mansion houses in continental North America, with 17 rooms and over including its large cellars.

After John Turner III lost the family fortune, the house was acquired by the Ingersolls, who remodeled it again. Gables were removed, porches replaced, and Georgian trim added.

==Inspiration for Hawthorne==
Nathaniel Hawthorne, a relative of the Ingersolls, was infamous for being reclusive during his time living in Salem, in part because Hawthorne himself exaggerated his reputation. He occasionally played whist, for example, with his sister Louisa, his second cousin Susannah Ingersoll, and Ingersoll&#x27;s adopted son Horace Connolly. Hawthorne was occasionally entertained in the house by Susannah but, by Hawthorne&#x27;s time, the house had only three gables after a renovation to match more current architectural trends. His cousin told him the house&#x27;s history, and showed him beams and mortises in the attic indicating locations of former gables. Hawthorne was more inspired by the way &quot;seven gables&quot; sounded than what the house looked like. As he wrote in a letter, &quot;The expression was new and struck me forcibly... I think I shall make something of it.&quot; The idea inspired Hawthorne&#x27;s novel &quot;The House of the Seven Gables&quot;.

Hawthorne wrote of the house as if it were a living thing. It is described as such in the novel: &quot;The aspect of the venerable mansion has always affected me like a human countenance... It was itself like a great human heart, with a life of its own, and full of rich and sombre reminisces. The deep projection of the section story gave the house a meditative look, that you could not pass it without the idea that it had secret to keep.&quot; In writing the book, Hawthorne compared the process to constructing an actual house. In January 1851, he wrote to his publisher James T. Fields that the book was nearly finished, &quot;only I am hammering away a little on the roof, and doing a few odd jobs that were left incomplete.&quot; He sent the finished manuscript to Fields by the end of the month. &quot;The House of the Seven Gables&quot; was published in April 1851.

Horace Ingersoll, Susanna&#x27;s adopted son, told Hawthorne a story of Acadian lovers that later inspired Henry Wadsworth Longfellow&#x27;s 1847 poem &quot;Evangeline&quot;.

==Museum==

In 1908, the house was purchased by Caroline O. Emmerton, founder of the House of Seven Gables Settlement Association, and she restored it from 1908 to 1910 as a museum whose admission fees would support the association. Boston architect Joseph Everett Chandler supervised the restoration, which among other alterations reconstructed missing gables. In some cases historical authenticity was sacrificed in the interest of appealing to visitors, who expected the house to match the one Hawthorne described in his romantic novel. Thus, for example, Emmerton added a &quot;cent-shop&quot; resembling that operated by the author&#x27;s fictional character Hepzibah Pyncheon. A representation of &quot;Maule&#x27;s Well&quot; was added to the garden.

She also added what looks like a wood closet but has a false back. When opened, the back leads to a secret staircase which leads up to the attic.

Many interesting features of the original mansion remain, including unusual forms of wall insulation, original beams and rafters, and extensive Georgian paneling.

The Nathaniel Hawthorne Birthplace is now immediately adjacent to the House of the Seven Gables, and access to it is granted with either a regular admission fee or a grounds pass. Although it is indeed the house in which Hawthorne was born and lived to the age of four, the house was sited a few blocks away on Union Street when he inhabited it.

In 1994, the Seamans Visitor Center was opened at the historic site. The visitor center was named in honor of the Seamans family; Donald C. Seamans was responsible for the building project when he was president of the House of the Seven Gables Settlement Association.

On March 29, 2007, the House of the Seven Gables Historic District was designated a National Historic Landmark District.

As of 2022, The House of the Seven Gables opened to the public in April 1910 and has seen millions of visitors since.

<doc id="1164391" wikidata="Q133858" url="?curid=1164391" title="Acanthocalycium">
<text>Acanthocalycium is a genus of cactus consisting of several species from Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. The taxon name comes from Greek &quot;akantha&quot; (meaning &quot;prickly&quot;) and &quot;kalyx&quot; (meaning &quot;buds&quot;), which refers to the spines on the floral tubes.

==Description==
These plants are to , with numerous ribs on the spiny stems columnar stem succulents up to 60 cm high and 20 cm in diameter. The plants usually remain unbranched or branch slightly from the bases. The areoles, which stand on up to 20 ribs, have many spines up to about 8 cm long, which are only indistinctly divided into edge and central spines. 

Flowers range from yellow to orange or white to pink or magenta and open during the day. The funnel-shaped flowers, formed by areoles near the apex, have scales on the outside that taper into sharp thorns. This feature is typical of the genus Acanthocalycium and only occurs in it. Inside, the area of the flower containing the ovary (ovary) is protected with a ring of hairs.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Spinicalycium&quot; (nom. inval.) has been brought into synonymy with this genus. Besides, the genus &quot;Acanthocalycium&quot; has been periodically included in the genus &quot;Echinopsis&quot;.

=== Species ===

<doc id="1164399" wikidata="Q298221" url="?curid=1164399" title="Kathy Reichs">
<text>Dr. Kathleen Joan Reichs (PhD) (née Toelle, born July 7, 1948) is an American crime writer, forensic anthropologist and academic. She is a professor emerita of anthropology at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. She is well known for inspiring the television series &quot;Bones&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Kathleen Joan Toelle was born in 1948 in Chicago, Illinois.

She earned her Bachelor of Arts degree with a major in anthropology from American University in 1971. In 1972, she completed her Master of Arts in physical anthropology at Northwestern University, where, in 1975, she completed her PhD, also in physical anthropology.

==Academia and anthropology==
Since 1975, Reichs has taught at Northern Illinois University, University of Pittsburgh, Concordia University, and McGill University, and currently holds a position as professor emerita of anthropology at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. In the past, Kathy Reichs has consulted for the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in North Carolina.

Reichs has appeared in Tanzania to testify at the United Nations&#x27;s International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. She has assisted Clyde Snow and the Foundation for Guatemalan Forensic Anthropology in an exhumation in the area of Lake Atitlan in the highlands of southwest Guatemala. She was a member of the Disaster Mortuary Operational Response Team assigned to assist at the World Trade Center disaster.

She is one of 100 anthropologists certified by the American Board of Forensic Anthropology and is on the board of directors of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences. She is also affiliated with the Laboratoire des Sciences Judiciaires et de Médecine Légale for the province of Quebec.

== Fiction==
In addition to technical books, as of January 2019, Reichs has written 23 novels, which have been translated into 30 languages. 20 of those novels constitute the &quot;Temperance Brennan&quot; series. Her first novel, &quot;Déjà Dead&quot;, won the 1997 Arthur Ellis Award for Best First Novel.

The fictional heroine in her novels, Temperance &quot;Tempe&quot; Brennan, is also a forensic anthropologist. Her lifestyle closely mimics that of her creator, with Reichs stating that Brennan and she &quot;have the same CV&quot; and that &quot;Some of Tempe&#x27;s personality traits are also mine,&quot; but there are differences in their personal lives, such as the character&#x27;s alcoholism. A good portion of the novels are based on real life science, and Reichs has stated that she is &quot;fastidiously conscientious about getting the science right.&quot; She has used experience from her career in her novels and said about &quot;Déjà Dead&quot; that &quot;Everything I describe in the book, I actually did.&quot; In the novel &quot;Grave Secrets&quot;, she uses her experience from her visit to Guatemala.

She has also co-written (with her son Brendan) the young adult novels series named &quot;Virals&quot;, centered on Tempe&#x27;s great-niece, Tory Brennan, and a pack of her friends, Ben, Hiram, Shelton, and wolfdog Cooper.

A stand-alone novel, &quot;Two Nights&quot;, published July 11, 2017, features Sunday Night, a tough-talking, scarred heroine.

== Television ==

The 2005 Fox television series &quot;Bones&quot; is inspired by Reichs&#x27; life and novels. The series borrows the name of her books&#x27; heroine, Temperance &quot;Bones&quot; Brennan. As in the books, Brennan (Emily Deschanel) is a forensic anthropologist; however, there are many differences: the television character is younger, more socially awkward, and is based in the Jeffersonian, a fictionalized version of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. Additionally, the Brennan character in the TV series moonlights as an author, writing about a fictional forensic anthropologist named Kathy Reichs. Aside from the character&#x27;s name and occupation, there are few similarities between the TV show and the novels.

Reichs worked as a producer on the show to &quot;keep the science honest&quot;. She appeared in the second-season episode &quot;Judas on a Pole&quot;, playing Professor Constance Wright, a forensic anthropologist on the Jeffersonian&#x27;s board of trustees who conducts Zack Addy&#x27;s dissertation defense. 

Reichs wrote the season five episode, &quot;The Witch in the Wardrobe,&quot; the season nine episode, &quot;The Dude in the Dam,&quot; and wrote the season eleven episode, &quot;The Stiff in the Cliff&quot; with her daughter Kerry.

==Casey Anthony murder trial==

In 2011, Reichs was an expert witness in the Casey Anthony murder trial. Reichs was reluctant to get involved, but later agreed and performed a full skeletal analysis of Anthony&#x27;s daughter, Caylee, but could not determine a cause of death. She concluded that there was no evidence of abuse and that the child appeared to be well-nourished.

==Personal life==
Reichs has two daughters and a son.

<doc id="1164400" wikidata="Q2906288" url="?curid=1164400" title="Blaxland, New South Wales">
<text>Blaxland is a town in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales, Australia. Blaxland is located 65 kilometres west of Sydney in the local government area of the City of Blue Mountains. It is at an altitude of 234 metres and borders the townships of Glenbrook, Mount Riverview and Warrimoo.

==History==
Blaxland is named for Gregory Blaxland who along with William Lawson and William Wentworth, led the exploration that discovered a route over the Blue Mountains in 1813. Prior to 1879 the area was known as &quot;Wascoe&quot;.

The Pilgrim Inn was built c. 1825. It was a significant element in the area for some time, but eventually decayed. The remains, which are now adjacent to McDonald&#x27;s, are heritage-listed.

The Rev. Joshua Hargrave became a major presence in the area in the early 20th. century, and a significant force in the growth of Blaxland as a village, especially South Blaxland. He built the first church in the area and, with his family and the Calver family, is associated with four homes that still survive: Tanfield in Hope Street, Menahne in Hope Street, Rosedale in View Street and Nardi in View Street. The homes are all heritage-listed.

== Heritage listings ==
Blaxland has a number of heritage listed sites, including:
* Blue Mountains National Park: Blue Mountains walking tracks

==Population==
According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 7,451 people in Blaxland.
* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 2.0% of the population. 
* 82.2% of people were born in Australia. The next most common country of birth was England at 5.0%. 
* 92.1% of people spoke only English at home. 
In the 2021 Census religious affiliation was as follows: 

* Christianity was the most widely professed religion accounting for 94.7%. 
* The largest Christian denominations were Anglicanism (42.3%), Catholicism (24.7%) and Presbyterianism (22.9%) 
* People who did not state their religion accounted for 3.7% and 1.6% professed no religion. 

==Transport==
Blaxland railway station is on the Blue Mountains Line of the NSW TrainLink intercity network. It is a disability-accessible station.

==Commercial area==
The village of Blaxland received a major overhaul in 2001 with the widening of the Great Western Highway. This work included the controversial planting of Canary Island Palm trees along the highway, but also created space for more shops and led to many refurbishments. These changes, combined with the upgrade of Blaxland Station, have improved business in Blaxland.

Blaxland also has a small industrial estate and the only remaining land fill waste facility in the Blue Mountains.

==Services==
* Blue Mountains Library branch, Hope Street
* Blaxland Rural Fire Brigade falls under the jurisdiction of the statewide Rural Fire Service

==Schools==
* Blaxland High School
* Blaxland East Public School
* Blaxland Public School

==Sport and Recreation==
=== Bushwalking Tracks ===

Blaxland includes the Florabella Pass track, which leads to Glenbrook, and the Pippas Pass track, leading to a pool on Glenbrook Creek. The Lennox Bridge (Lapstone Hill) and Knapsack Viaduct are to the north and can be accessed by Mitchell&#x27;s Pass.

=== Blaxland Redbacks Soccer and Netball Clubs ===
Blaxland is home to the &quot;Blaxland Redbacks&quot; soccer and netball teams.

The Soccer team was established in 1965 and resides at the home ground of St. Johns Oval, Blaxland. St. Johns Oval was named after the local St. Johns Ambulance Brigade who original donated the land for the soccer fields to the club.

=== Wascoe Siding Miniature Railway ===
The Wascoe Siding is a Miniature Railway was established in 1964 by John Green. It is a conversion of a disused railway cutting from the railway line for Glenbrook Station, then named Wascoe Siding. Today it serves as spot for hobbyists and historians for miniature trains.

=== Scouts Club ===
Blaxland is also the home of the 1st Blaxland Scout group.

<text>Lake Rotomahana is an lake in northern New Zealand, located 20 kilometres to the south-east of Rotorua. It is immediately south-west of the dormant volcano Mount Tarawera, and its geography was substantially altered by a major 1886 eruption of Mount Tarawera. Along with the mountain, it lies within the Ōkataina Caldera. It is the most recently formed larger natural lake in New Zealand, and the deepest in the Rotorua district.

==History==

The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of &quot;warm lake&quot; for , following Hochstetter. and the surrounds of the lake had become world famous following its first European written description in 1843.

==Geology==
Lake Rotomahana is one of the most studied lakes in New Zealand, occupying the southwestern portion of a rift which formed during the 1886 eruption of Mount Tarawera. In the context of the geological discussion, a high standard hydrophonic survey took place in 2016 and the absolute measurements taken at this time, as lake level varies, are used for baseline. At this time the lake level was , not the geographically mapped height of , or the mean height of . Lake Rotomahana has no natural surface outlet, and its water level varies by about one metre in response to rainfall and evaporation. There is now an engineered surface channel to maintain maximum lake level. Hydrogeologic models of the catchments in the Ōkataina Caldera predict that the Lake Rotomahana catchment is contributing subsurface to the Lake Tarawera catchment with an outflow, depending upon the size of the catchments so defined, of between . 

Before the 1886 eruption, two small lakes were present in the current lake&#x27;s basin and perhaps six smaller ponds. The other lake was called Lake Rotomakariri. After the eruption a new Lake Rotomakariri to its east briefly existed before being incorporated by lake level rise into the present lake. The now lake floor was mostly dry when surveyed in the period 1886 to 1888 after the eruption, and it is possible to match these observations with current geolocated hydrophonic findings. High quality pictures of the old Lake Rotomahana and associated tourist attractions were widely available in Europe by 1875. Following the eruption, a number of craters filled over the course of 15 years to form today&#x27;s Lake Rotomahana. As a result it is the most recently formed large natural lake in New Zealand, and at deep, the deepest in the Rotorua district. The former official depth was previously , at a lower lake level and with less precise equipment. The lake bottom currently has up to of sediments, which means the Rotomahana crater bottom is above sea level. 

The lake&#x27;s northern shore lies close to the lower Lake Tarawera, separated by less than of terrain that is mostly material from the 1886 eruption. The original Lake Rotomahana has a slightly controversial level with respect to that of Lake Tarawera before 1886, partially because the eruption also changed the level of Lake Tarawera and there was a later lowering of Lake Tarawera&#x27;s level around 1904. 

The consensus range of difference with current water level between the old and current Lake Rotomahana appears to be . 

The original lake formed in an area of mostly rhyolytic eruptives and would have also been associated with lake sediments deposited at least in the time since the 1314 ± 12 CE Kaharoa eruption of Mount Tarawera. The eruption process which was basaltic deposited muddy material widely and many metres thick especially to the northeast. One or other of the lakes that existed before the eruption is the likely origin of shells of water-snails found, in a sample of fresh ash from Tauranga, and in an ash sample from Cape Runaway. Essentially the new crater evacuated material to a depth of at least where the pre-eruption lakes had been and possibly as much as in places.

The current average conductive heat flux is at least three times higher than that either beneath Lake Rotorua or Lake Taupō. The latest determination is 47 MW. The hydrothermal system that feeds still active geothermal features on the lake shore and had fed the Pink Terraces at the western side of the lake, has a heat flux of 21.3 W/m2. There is an area southwest of Pātītī Island that has a heat flux averaging 13 W/m2 that appears to be in a lake floor crater created in 1886.

==Ecology==
The lake is a wildlife refuge (and was one prior to first contact), with all hunting of birds prohibited. A healthy population of black swan inhabits the lake, and there are efforts underway to ensure the lake&#x27;s largest island, Pātītī Island, is kept pest-free. Recent research confirms Pātītī Island is the closest surviving pre-eruption feature on the old lake, i.e. to survive the 1886 eruption, being formerly known as Rangipakaru Hill. There is no public access to the lake, save for the Tourist Track, overland from Lake Tarawera.

A boat cruise on the lake, visiting hydrothermal features on the lake&#x27;s shore, is available as an additional extra from the Waimangu Volcanic Valley tourism operation.

The nitrogen load on the lake is stable, but has high trophic level index inflow from the Okaro catchment via the Haumi Stream.

===Water Inflows===
==Pink and White Terraces==
The Pink and White Terraces were a natural wonder on the shores of the lake before the 1886 eruption. They were considered to be the eighth wonder of the natural world and were New Zealand&#x27;s most famous tourist attraction during the 19th century, from c. 1870-1886; but were buried or destroyed by the eruption.

Scientists thought they had rediscovered the lower tiers of the Pink and White Terraces on the lake bed at a depth of in 2011. More recent research reports over 2016-2020 suggest the upper parts of both terraces lie on land and may therefore be accessed for physical evidence the terraces or sections of them survived in their original locations.

The 2017- research relied on the journals of German-Austrian geologist Ferdinand von Hochstetter, who visited the lake in 1859. Hochstetter&#x27;s journals are the only known survey of the terraces before the eruption. Using Hochstetter&#x27;s field diaries and compass data, a team of New Zealand researchers identified a location where they believe the Pink and White Terraces lie preserved at a depth of 10–15 metres (32–49 ft). The researchers were hoping to raise funds for a full survey of the area, but any work would first have to be approved by the local Māori tribe on whose sacred ancestral land the Pink and White Terraces are situated. Ground penetrating radar searches were undertaken in 2017 but the equipment failed to penetrate sufficiently deeply to show whether or not the terraces lay in their surveyed locations. Later Hochstetter survey research refined the Pink, Black and White Terrace locations. The issue of whether any of the terraces remain continues to remain unresolved.

==Green Lake==
A small lake, Green Lake, lies close to the eastern shore of Lake Rotomahana at . It should not be confused by the much larger Lake Rotokakahi (Green Lake), which lies to the west of Rotomahana.

Green Lake was formed in a roughly circular crater and is some 100 metres in diameter. It takes its name from its distinctive colour, which is considerably greener and darker than that of Rotomahana. The lake formed after the 1886 eruption of Mount Tarawera. Prior to the eruption, a small (~12m diameter) lakelet also known as Green Lake (Lake Rotopounamu) had existed to the north of Lake Rotomahana in Waikanapanapa Valley but this was exhumed during the Tarawera eruption. After the eruption, water flowed into the new Green Lake crater, which was given the same name as the older lake. Other pre-eruption lakes and lakelets about Lake Rotomahana included Lakes Rotomakariri, Rangipakaru, Ruahoata and Wairake. The shape, location and orientation of Lake Makariri in Cole, 1970 (cited herein) is incorrect. He followed August Petermann&#x27;s flawed map. Hochstetter shows the lake axis lay at an azimuth of 355 degrees. Recent research into these lake levels gave insight into changes at Lake Rotomahana in the lead-up to the eruption.

== The Sunken Totara Forest Myth ==
One forgotten lake feature is the semi-mythical &quot;sunken totara forest&quot; of Lake Rotomahana. In 2016 when a scuba team first dove the lake, they found no evidence of a sunken forest or trees, as reported by Fitzgerald off Moura. While there were forests over the pre-eruption Mt Tarawera, Tōtara trees were scattered and only recorded over the western and southern mountain flanks.  Given Tōtara tree groves could hardly appear in the eruption craters, it appears likely any sunken forest lies in the north-east corner of the new lake.

The placement of the sunken forest would have been post-eruption, via the mechanism described by the US Forest Service after the Mt. St. Helens eruption. The trees were uprooted in the eruption and propelled into the crater during or after the eruption. As the new lake formed over decades, the trunks floated for a time, then tipped vertically; later descending into a vertical lie, and became embedded into the lake floor coming to resemble a sunken forest. Hence, another myth about the Tarawera eruption and Lake Rotomahana is explained.

<text>Diamond Comic Distributors, Inc. (often called Diamond Comics, DCD, or casually Diamond) is an American comic book distributor serving retailers in North America and worldwide. It transports comic books and graphic novels, as well as other popular culture products such as toys, games, and apparel, from comic book publishers or suppliers to retailers.

It is owned by Geppi Family Enterprises, which is also the parent company of Alliance Game Distributors, Diamond Book Distributors, Diamond UK, Diamond Select Toys, Gemstone Publishing, E. Gerber Products, Diamond International Galleries, Hake&#x27;s Americana &amp; Collectibles, Morphy&#x27;s Auctions, the Geppi&#x27;s Entertainment Museum, and &quot;Baltimore&quot; magazine.

Diamond is the publisher of &quot;Previews&quot;, a monthly catalog/magazine showcasing upcoming comic books, graphic novels, toys, and other pop-culture merchandise.

==History==
In 1982, Baltimore-based comics retailer Steve Geppi founded Diamond Comic Distributors. Diamond became the successor to direct-sales pioneer Phil Seuling&#x27;s distribution dream when it took over New Media/Irjax&#x27;s warehouses in 1982. Diamond further bought out early distributor Bud Plant Inc. in 1988, and main rival Capital City Distribution in 1996, to assume a near-monopoly on comics distribution, including exclusivity deals with the major comic book publishers.

=== Beginnings ===
By 1981/1982 Geppi had four comics retail locations and was already &quot;doing a little informal distributing... for smaller retailers.&quot; Geppi found himself &quot;one of the biggest accounts&quot; for New Media/Irjax, and when the distributor &quot;relocated to Florida, he asked Geppi to service more accounts for a bigger discount.&quot; One of the &quot;last loyal customers&quot; when New Media began having fiscal difficulties, Geppi made a deal: &quot;[t]he owner was going into retail,&quot; so Geppi agreed to provide New Media/Irjax with &quot;free books for a period of time in return for his account list,&quot; buying parts of the company, and founding Diamond Comic Distribution.

Geppi had been a sub-distributor for Hal Shuster&#x27;s Irjax in the late 1970s. In what Mile High Comics&#x27; Chuck Rozanski describes as an &quot;incredibly risky and gutsy move,&quot; Geppi took over New Media/Irjax&#x27;s &quot;office and warehouse space&quot; and, recalled Rozanski, had to &quot;sort out the good customers from the bad overnight&quot; negotiating with creditors to continue Shuster&#x27;s distribution business as Diamond Comic Distribution. Almost overnight, noted Rozanski, &quot;[h]e went from being a retailer in Baltimore to having warehouses all over the place.&quot;

Geppi named his new company &#x27;Diamond&#x27; &quot;after the imprint Marvel Comics used on non-returnable comics,&quot; and although the &quot;publisher discontinued the symbol&quot; months later, the name remained. &quot;Diamond grew an average of 40 percent a year,&quot; as comics retail took off.

In 1983, Diamond hired an accounting firm. In 1985, Diamond hired &quot;no-nonsense CPA&quot; Chuck Parker &quot;as Diamond&#x27;s first controller&quot;. In 1994, Diamond employee Mark Herr noted that this move was Geppi&#x27;s &quot;best decision&quot;, as Parker &quot;cares nothing about the comics. To him, it&#x27;s dollars and cents.&quot; Parker describes his role as &quot;smooth[ing] the emotion out of some decisions. Steve [Geppi] is a visionary and a risk-taker... and I tend to be more conservative.&quot;

===Expansion===
After starting his business through buying New Media/Irjax&#x27;s warehouses and offices in 1982, Geppi&#x27;s distribution company has bought out many other distribution companies since. Many fans &quot;with little experience&quot; started rival distribution companies only to &quot;find they were in over their heads,&quot; allowing Geppi to &quot;[buy] out the smart ones or pick... up the pieces after the stupid ones went out of business,&quot; according to Herr. Diamond was aided in his efforts by the publishers themselves. In the early 1980s, Marvel Comics and DC Comics provided trade terms favorable for larger distributors and those with efficient freight systems, effectively &quot;play[ing] into the hands of the major distributors such as Capital and Diamond,&quot; and hastening the demise of smaller distributors.

In 1988, &quot;Previews&quot;, Diamond&#x27;s monthly magazine showcasing upcoming comic books was first published.

==== Bud Plant Inc. ====
Most notably, in 1988, Geppi bought up early mail-order distributor Bud Plant Inc., who had himself bought out Charles Abar Distribution in 1982. Plant had, since 1970, been selling underground comics (a field which Geppi and fellow distributor Buddy Saunders had tended to steer clear of). After making $19m in sales in 1987, Diamond bought West Coast distributor Plant&#x27;s business in 1988 &quot;and went national&quot; thereby assuming control of &quot;40 percent of the direct-sales market.&quot; (Diamond and Capital City Distribution had control of at least 70% between them.)

==== Further expansion ====
In 1990, Diamond acquired Oregon-based Second Genesis Distribution (whose operations folded in 1991). Second Genesis had previously absorbed distributors Sunrise Distributors and Comex. One week after announcing the acquisition of Second Genesis, Diamond announced the acquisition of the Seattle-based sub-distributor Destiny Distribution. Destiny had been started by Phil Pankow in the early 1980s, and was initially supplied by Bud Plant. 

In 1991, Diamond moved into the UK market, acquiring Neptune Comic Distributors Ltd. (to whom they had formerly supplied US comics for the UK market), in the process creating Diamond UK. In 1993, Diamond acquired the single remaining dominant British distributor Titan Distributors, thus cornering the direct market in the United Kingdom.

In 1994, Diamond acquired Staten Island-based distributor Comics Unlimited. By this point, Diamond had &quot;27 warehouses in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K., employ[ing] between 750 and 900 people;&quot; operated its own trucking line; and controlled 45% of the market, making $222 million in sales.

In 1996, Diamond launched the toll-free Comic Shop Locator service.

==== Heroes World and Capital City ====
In 1995, Marvel Comics challenged Diamond and main rival Capital City by buying the third largest distributor — Heroes World Distribution — and distributing its titles in-house after taking over from Curtis Circulation. On April 26, 1995, Diamond reacted by outbidding Capital City for exclusive deals with Marvel&#x27;s main rivals DC Comics, Dark Horse and Image on July 24, and Valiant Comics in August. Capital City&#x27;s response saw it sign exclusive deals with Kitchen Sink Press and Viz Comics, but a year later faced the choice between bankruptcy and selling out. Diamond bought Capital City on July 26, 1996, assuming near-control of the comics distribution system. The purchase price was not disclosed, but the acquisition brought an estimated $50 million in sales revenue to Diamond.

In early 1997, when Marvel&#x27;s Heroes World endeavor failed, Diamond also forged an exclusive deal with Marvel after the publisher&#x27;s filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December 1996. — giving the company its own section of comics catalog &quot;Previews&quot; (not least because the DC/Dark Horse/Image deal gave contractual prominence to those companies) — making &quot;Geppi... the sole king of comics industry distribution in the summer of 1996.&quot;

==== Antitrust litigation ====
In 1997, Diamond&#x27;s position in the comics industry, as &quot;the sole source of most new comics products to comics specialty shops,&quot; ultimately saw the company become the subject of &quot;an investigation by the U.S. Justice department for possible antitrust violations.&quot; The Justice Department launched an antitrust investigation into the comics industry and the alleged monopoly of Diamond Comics. The investigation was closed in November 2000, with no further action deemed necessary on the basis that, although Diamond enjoyed a monopoly in the North American comic book direct market distribution, they did not enjoy a monopoly on book distribution (books including non-comic books).

==== Books and games ====
In addition to having cornered the American comics distribution market, Diamond includes a number of subsidiary and affiliated companies. UK and European comics distribution is served by Diamond UK, based in Runcorn, England.

On August 31, 2000, Diamond Comic Distributors acquired Alliance Game Distributors, North America&#x27;s largest distributor of tabletop games.

In 2002, Diamond consolidated its book trade into Diamond Book Distributors, marketing graphic novels and trade paperbacks to bookstores including Barnes &amp; Noble, Ingram, Baker &amp; Taylor, Amazon.com and Borders.

===2020 coronavirus shutdown===
On March 23, 2020, Geppi announced that Diamond would stop sending comics to retail shops until further notice and had instructed printers not to send any new shipments to the company, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Issues of comics with United States release dates of April 1 or later, and with United Kingdom release dates of March 25 or later, would not be shipped until normal operations resumed. The shutdown took effect on April 1, 2020, and ended on May 20.

===DC Comics, Marvel Comics, IDW Publishing shift to other distributors===
On June 5, 2020, DC Comics announced that they would discontinue their distribution agreement with Diamond and that their books would now be distributed by Penguin Random House for their graphic novels and by UCS Comic Distributors (subsidiary of Midtown Comics) and Lunar Distribution (subsidiary of Discount Comic Book Service in Fort Wayne, Indiana). While acknowledging how huge the decision was, DC reiterated that the move was intended to fortify and increase the viability of the comic book direct market while also widening its fan base.

On March 25, 2021, Marvel Comics announced they plan to shift their direct market distribution, for both monthly comics and graphic novels, to Penguin Random House. The change is scheduled to start on October 1, 2021, in a multi-year partnership. Unlike DC Comics&#x27; complete split, Marvel will still be giving stores the option to order comics from Diamond, but Diamond will be acting as a wholesaler rather than distributor.

On September 17, 2021, IDW Publishing announced a new deal with Penguin Random House to distribute newly published and backlist comic book periodicals, trade collections, and graphic novels to the Direct Market comic shops beginning June 1, 2022. The deal is non-exclusive, allowing retailers to choose ordering from Penguin Random House directly or from Diamond as a wholesaler rather than a distributor in the US and the UK.

===Bankruptcy===
On January 14, 2025, Diamond filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to facilitate the restructuring of its operations. The company received a $39 million stalking horse bid to sell off Alliance Game Distributors to Canadian-based hobby distributor Universal Distribution.

==Criticism==
In 1983, Diamond was criticized for taking exception to certain &quot;adult&quot;-themed titles and scenes, effectively causing the cancellation of a series called &quot;Void Indigo&quot; for its excessive violence.

In 1987, Geppi responded to &quot;a graphic childbirth scene in &quot;Miracleman&quot; #9 [written by Alan Moore].&quot; Geppi wrote to retailers that:

This call for retailers to refuse to stock &quot;Miracleman&quot; led to accusations of censorship, charges the company was forced to address when it criticized or refused to carry other titles, including books by Kitchen Sink Press, and Dave Sim in 1988, Jon Lewis in 1994, and Mike Diana in 1996.

Diamond lost customers with this approach, however, &quot;and eventually backed down.&quot; Geppi recalls compromising, and accepting &quot;that as a distributor, I owed the retailers the product they wanted.&quot; In fact, in an attempt to prove Diamond did not practice censorship, the company joined DC Comics in 1993 to raise money for the industry&#x27;s First Amendment advocacy group Comic Book Legal Defense Fund.

Because of its industry dominance, Diamond also faced charges it bullied publishers and discriminated against small publishers. These charges first surfaced in 1988 when Diamond rejected Matt Feazell&#x27;s comic &quot;Ant Boy&quot;, and in 1989 when it similarly decided not to carry Allen Freeman&#x27;s &quot;Slam Bang&quot; anthology.

After the industry consolidation of 1996, Diamond faced similar charges in 1996, 1999, and 2000 (when smaller publishers like Fantagraphics and Drawn &amp; Quarterly lodged complaints).

== Publishing ==
Diamond&#x27;s monthly comics retail catalog, &quot;Previews&quot;, has been produced by Diamond for over 25 years for store owners and comic shop customers to order their products. It is additionally available for sale to customers to facilitate pre-orders from &quot;pull and hold&quot; or subscription customers who frequent comic shops on a regular basis. Comics publishers vie for space within the publication&#x27;s pages, with Dark Horse, DC Comics, Image Comics, and IDW Publishing taking precedence as &quot;Premier&quot; publishers. Marvel Comics has its own mini-catalog of &quot;Marvel Previews&quot; available separately, for contractual reasons.

Geppi is also owner of Gemstone Publishing Inc., through which he publishes &quot;The Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide&quot;. Gemstone has also published Russ Cochran&#x27;s EC Comics reprints, Disney comics and Blue Book price guide in the past as well.

===&quot;Baltimore&quot;===
In 1994, Geppi purchased &quot;Baltimore&quot; magazine, &quot;a 50,000-circulation monthly and one of the nation&#x27;s oldest regional publications.&quot;

===Gemstone Publishing===
Geppi&#x27;s publishing ventures in the comics field saw him create Gemstone Publishing Inc., which was formed in large part from other purchases. In 1992, Diamond bought Ernst Gerber Publishing (publisher-author of the &quot;Photo-Journal Guide to Comics&quot;). E. Gerber Products, LLC is a Diamond-affiliated company started by Gerber in 1977 which sells Mylar bags as well as &quot;acid-free boxes and acid-free backing boards&quot; for comics collectors to store their collection in. In 1993, Geppi bought Russ Cochran Publishing. Long-term EC Comics fan Cochran auctioned Bill Gaines&#x27; personal file copies of EC publications, as well as most pages of original EC artwork (which, almost uniquely, Gaines had maintained ownership and possession of), before being granted the reprint rights to the EC back catalog itself. Geppi included Cochran&#x27;s publications — and Cochran himself — under his new imprint, Gemstone Publishing.

In 1994, Geppi bought Overstreet Publishing, taking up the publishing reins of official-Blue Book price guide &quot;The Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide&quot;, and other related publications, bringing them under the Gemstone imprint. Geppi&#x27;s publishing activities with Gemstone Publishing consist primarily of reprints of classic titles and artworks, as well as publications (including professional fanzines &quot;pro-zines&quot;) focusing heavily on the history of the comics medium. Many Gemstone publications revolve around &quot;Comic Book Marketplace&quot;-editor and EC-shepherd Russ Cochran.

====EC Comics reprints====
Cochran, like Geppi, was a particular fan of Carl Barks&#x27; Disney comics, and had previously-published EC reprints in association with Disney-reprinter Gladstone Publishing. In the early 1990s, Geppi&#x27;s Gemstone embarked on a full series of reprints of classic EC titles, starting with new reprints of the Cochran/Gladstone-reprints of &quot;The Haunt of Fear&quot;, &quot;The Vault of Horror&quot; and &quot;Weird Science&quot; (all 1992). Gemstone also republished (in single issue and &#x27;annual&#x27; — four issues per &#x27;annual&#x27; — format) EC&#x27;s &quot;New Trend&quot; and &quot;New Direction&quot; titles (with the exception of &quot;Mad&quot;) between 1992 and 2000.

In 2005, Gemstone added to Cochran&#x27;s earlier-published oversize, hardback, black &amp; white slip-cased &quot;The Complete EC Library&quot; collections with the complete &quot;Picto-Fiction&quot; collection, comprising the EC comics: &quot;Confessions Illustrated&quot;, &quot;Crime Illustrated&quot;, &quot;Shock Illustrated&quot; and &quot;Terror Illustrated&quot;, along with &quot;18 previously unseen stories, never published before&quot;.

In 2006, Gemstone began producing a more durable and luxurious series of hardback reprint collections; the EC Archives — similar to the DC Archives and Marvel Masterworks volumes — which reprint in full-color hardback (&#x27;archival&#x27;) format sequential compilations of the EC Comics titles. Designed by art director/designer Michael Kronenberg, a number of volumes have been released, with the entirety of the &quot;New Trend&quot; and &quot;New Direction&quot; planned for eventual release. These EC Archives volumes have drawn praise for their quality, and feature introductions by such notable EC fans as George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, Joe Dante and Paul Levitz.

====Disney comics====
In December 2002, it was announced that &quot;Gemstone Publishing had signed the license to publishing Disney comics in North America,&quot; with ex-Gladstone Publishing editor-in-chief John Clark joining Gemstone in the same position over its Disney line. Launched with a title for Free Comic Book Day 2003, the line started soon after with &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; and &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Uncle Scrooge&quot;, both described by Clark as &quot;monthly 64-page prestige-format books at $6.95, which is the same price they were when last produced, in 1998.&quot; Other titles followed, and Gemstone held their license until early 2009.

====Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide====
The (Official) Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide, first published by Robert M. Overstreet in 1970 as one of the earliest authorities on American comic book industry grading and collection values. Overstreet sold his company to Gemstone in 1994, but continued to &quot;serve as author and/or publisher of Geppi&#x27;s Entertainment Publishing &amp; Auctions&#x27; line of books.&quot; Publication of the &quot;Price Guide&quot; was taken over by Gemstone in 1998, Gemstone took over publication, and the twenty-eighth edition to the present have been (co-)published by Geppi&#x27;s Gemstone publications. The &quot;Guide&quot;&#x27;s 39th edition was published by Gemstone Publishing in 2009.

Overstreet also produced a variety of smaller publications updating his yearly guides on a monthly schedule. The most recent of these – &quot;Overstreet&#x27;s Comic Price Review&quot; – began publication from Gemstone in July 2003, and was a monthly publication designed to update the yearly price guide more regularly, as well as provide articles, analysis and various lists of comics prices.

Gemstone published more than a hundred issues of the magazine &quot;Comic Book Marketplace&quot;, a monthly magazine for comics fans focusing heavily on the Golden and Silver ages, while more popular magazines (such as &quot;Wizard&quot;) skew more recent in focus.

====Future====
In early 2009, the future of Gemstone Publishing was unclear, after reports of unpaid printing bills, particularly from the EC Archives. In April, Geppi responded to the uncertainty, noting that while there had been &quot;a reduction in staff at Gemstone,&quot; such moves did &quot;not signal the end of Gemstone Publishing.&quot;

In 2008, Diamond introduced ComicSuite, an add-on application for Microsoft Dynamics’ Retail Management System (RMS) software. Together, ComicSuite &amp; RMS give specialty storeowners a point-of-sale (POS) system specifically geared towards their unique business model, offering a host of exclusive features that grant you direct communication with Diamond databases, making it easier than ever before to place orders, track inventory and maintain “pull-and-hold” subscriptions for your customers.&quot;

== Geppi Family Enterprises subsidiaries ==
In 1995, Geppi founded Diamond International Galleries, which acquired Hake&#x27;s Americana &amp; Collectibles auction house (2004), and in 2005, Pennsylvania-based Morphy Auctions. In 1999, Geppi founded Diamond Select Toys, and in 2006 he founded Geppi&#x27;s Entertainment Museum in Baltimore.

Geppi reorganized its holdings into Geppi Family Enterprises in 2015.

=== Alliance Game Distributors ===
Alliance Game Distributors is North America&#x27;s largest distributor of tabletop games – role-playing games, collectible card games, miniature wargames, board games, and related merchandise – and the publisher of &quot;Game Trade Magazine&quot;. Alliance was acquired by Diamond in August 2000, two years after being formed by the merger of game distributors Chessex and The Armory.

=== Diamond Select Toys &amp; Collectibles ===

Envisioned to create collectibles for children and adults, DST was founded in 1999 and has since licensed a variety of pop culture properties, including Marvel Comics, Transformers, G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero, Star Wars, Star Trek, Stargate, Ghostbusters, Halo, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Indiana Jones, Battlestar Galactica, 24 and Back to the Future. While they also make action figures in a variety of sizes, as well as banks, busts, statues and prop replicas, many of their licensed properties are released in the form of Minimates, which has helped make Minimates one of the most prolific and diverse block figure toy lines in the world. In 2007, after years of partnership, Diamond Select Toys made a move to acquire select assets of New York-based design house Art Asylum, the creators of Minimates and DST has since developed Minimates based on its own concepts, under the brands Minimates M.A.X. and Calico Jack&#x27;s Pirate Raiders.

=== Diamond International Galleries ===
In 1995, Geppi &quot;opened Diamond International Galleries,&quot; a showplace for comics and collectibles, part of Geppi&#x27;s attempts to &quot;see... collectibles attain serious respect.&quot; Nine years later, Diamond International Galleries purchased &quot;one of the country’s first, and most respected, collectibles auction houses: Hake&#x27;s Americana &amp; Collectibles.&quot; In 2005, Geppi added the &quot;Denver, Pennsylvania-based Morphy Auctions&quot; to his growing stable of parts of the collectibles market, which already included publishing the main comics price guide: &quot;The Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide&quot;.

Geppi describes his International Galleries as being &quot;at the heart of many significant opportunities to preserve, promote and present historical comic character collectibles,&quot; an endeavor that led to his establishing Geppi&#x27;s Entertainment Museum. Geppi&#x27;s galleries showcase much of his private collection, including comics, movie posters, toys, original artwork by individuals including &quot;Carl Barks, Gustav Tengren, Alex Ross, Murphy Anderson, Joe Shuster, Joe Simon and Charles Schulz.&quot;

Diamond International Galleries has assisted &quot;in such projects as DC&#x27;s Archive series,&quot; as well as hosting industry events.

=== Geppi&#x27;s Entertainment Museum ===
Geppi&#x27;s Entertainment Museum was a museum in Baltimore, Maryland, tracing the history of pop culture in American over the last four hundred years. Its collections included comic books, magazines, movies, newspapers, television, radio and video game memorabilia, including comic books, movie posters, toys, buttons, badges, cereal boxes, trading cards, dolls and figurines. The majority of the exhibits came from Geppi&#x27;s private collection, while Geppi&#x27;s daughter Melissa &quot;Missy&quot; Geppi-Bowersox became the executive vice-president of the museum in 2007, after Wendy Kelman left the museum on August 31, 2007, to start her own tourism consulting firm. The museum&#x27;s curator was Dr. Arnold T. Blumberg, former editor at Geppi&#x27;s Gemstone Publishing. The museum closed in June 2018. Geppi donated much of his collection to the Library of Congress.

<text>Laurali Rose &quot;Bunny&quot; Wright (née Appleby) (5 June 1939 – 25 February 2001) was a Canadian writer of mainstream fiction and mystery novels. Many of her stories are set on the coast of British Columbia.

==Early life and education==

Wright was born in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. She was educated at Carleton University, the University of Calgary, University of British Columbia, and later at Simon Fraser University (Master of Arts in Liberal Studies, 1995).

==Career==
In 1959, Wright worked as a journalist at the Fraser Valley Record; she wrote for the Saskatoon &quot;Star Phoenix&quot;, but her first article was for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; about being a teenager in Germany. She later moved to Calgary, where she was mentored by W. O. Mitchell. She worked in California for an advertising agency.

While in Vancouver, Wright met John Wright. The two were married, and she spent time as an actor with her husband, including a stint doing summer stock in Dawson City. She worked for several years as a journalist at the &quot;Calgary Herald&quot;, eventually becoming assistant city editor, before turning to full-time writing in 1977.

Wright published her first novel, &quot;Neighbours&quot;, in 1979. Her earliest novels were literary fiction; after the publication of &quot;The Suspect&quot; (1985), her first mystery novel and winner of the 1986 Edgar Award for Best Novel, she concentrated almost exclusively on the genre. One further work of literary fiction, &quot;Love in the Temperate Zone&quot;, appeared in 1988.

In addition to the Edgar Award, Wright received the Arthur Ellis Award and wrote several adaptations of her novels for CBC Radio. Her novels have been published and distributed throughout the world in several languages. &quot;The Suspect&quot; has been adapted for the stage and, at various times, the &quot;Alberg and Cassandra&quot; series has been optioned for film and television. It is the basis for the television series &quot;Murder in a Small Town&quot;, which premiered in 2024.

==Personal==
Wright rarely used her given names for any purpose. She published all her novels as L. R. Wright (except in the US, where she appeared as Laurali Wright), and was known as Bunny in her personal life. She and husband John Wright had two daughters.

Wright died of breast cancer in Vancouver, British Columbia on February 25, 2001.

<text>Curt Backeberg (2 August 1894 in Lüneburg, Germany – 14 January 1966) was a German horticulturist especially known for the collection and classification of cacti.

== Biography ==
He travelled extensively through Central and South America, and published a number of books on cacti, including the six-volume, 4,000-page &quot;Die Cactaceae&quot;, 1958–1962, and the &quot;Kakteenlexikon&quot;, first appearing in 1966 and updated posthumously.

Although he collected and described many new species and defined a number of new genera, much of his work was based on faulty assumptions about the evolution of cacti and was too focused on geographic distribution; many of his genera have since been reorganized or abandoned. The botanist David Hunt is quoted as saying that he &quot;left a trail of nomenclatural chaos that will probably vex cactus taxonomists for centuries.&quot; Nevertheless, his observations regarding the subtle variations among cacti have proven useful for hobbyists, who continue to use many cactus names proposed or upheld in his works.

In 1954, the Mexican botanist Helia Bravo Hollis described a new genus, and named it &quot;Backebergia&quot; in honor of Curt Backeberg.

Curt Backeberg was struck by a heart attack and died on 14 January 1966.

<text>Sir Bernard Ingham (21 June 1932 – 24 February 2023) was a British journalist and civil servant. He was Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s chief press secretary throughout her time as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1979 to 1990.

==Background==
Ingham was born in Halifax and was raised in Hebden Bridge, in the West Riding of Yorkshire. He left school at the age of 16 to join the &quot;Hebden Bridge Times&quot; newspaper, for whom he continued to write until 2013. He attended Bradford Technical College on day release as part of the studies required to qualify for the Certificate of Training for Junior Journalists, which he described as being &quot;taken rather seriously in early post-war Britain&quot;. 

Ingham worked for the &quot;Yorkshire Evening Post&quot;, the &quot;Yorkshire Post&quot;, latterly as Northern industrial correspondent (1952–1961), and &quot;The Guardian&quot; (1962–1967). While a reporter at the &quot;Yorkshire Post&quot;, Ingham was an active member of the National Union of Journalists and vice-chairman of its Leeds branch. He is also likely to have been the anonymous and aggressively anti-Conservative columnist &quot;Albion&quot; for the &quot;Leeds Weekly Citizen&quot;, a Labour Party publication, from 1964 to 1967.

In 1967, Ingham joined the Civil Service, working as a press and public relations officer and director of Information in various Government departments, including the National Board For Prices and Incomes (1967) and the Department of Energy, 1974–77, where he also served as Under-Secretary in the Energy Conservation Division, 1978–79.

Ingham&#x27;s father was a Labour Party councillor for Hebden Royd Town Council, and he was himself a member of the Labour Party until he joined the Civil Service. Ingham contested the then safe Conservative Moortown ward of Leeds City Council in the 1965 council elections for the Labour Party, having been nominated by the Fabian Society.

==Press secretary to Margaret Thatcher==
Ingham spent 11 years as Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s chief press secretary in No. 10 Downing Street when she was Prime Minister. In 1979–90 he was also head of the Government Information Office. In the course of his civil service career, he was also press secretary to Barbara Castle, Robert Carr, Maurice Macmillan, Lord Carrington, Eric Varley and Tony Benn.

Although a career civil servant, Ingham gained a reputation for being a highly effective propagandist for the Thatcherite cause. The phrase spin doctor did not enter common parlance until after his retirement, but he was nevertheless considered a gifted exponent in what came to be known as the &quot;black arts&quot; of spin.

In those days, Downing Street briefings were &quot;off the record&quot;, meaning that information given out by Ingham could be attributed only to &quot;senior government sources&quot;. Occasionally he used this deniability to brief against the government&#x27;s own ministers, such as when he described the leader of the House of Commons John Biffen as a &quot;semi-detached&quot; member of the government. Biffen was dropped at the next reshuffle. This blurring of the distinction between his nominally neutral role as a civil servant and a more partisan role as an apologist and promoter of Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s policies led Christopher Hitchens to characterise Ingham as &quot;a nugatory individual&quot; and to criticise what he saw as the negative consequences of Ingham&#x27;s time as Thatcher&#x27;s press secretary: &quot;During his time in office, Fleet Street took several steps towards an American system of Presidentially-managed coverage and sound-bite deference, without acquiring any of the American constitutional protection in return.&quot;

In 1987 Downing Street berated &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper in a row over honours. Thatcher was said to be furious, and Ingham sent correspondence to &quot;The Sun&quot; asking it to explain why the honours list, given in confidence, had been published.

In 1989, three years after the Westland helicopter scandal led to the resignation of Defence Secretary Michael Heseltine, former cabinet minister Leon Brittan revealed in a Channel 4 programme that Ingham was one of two senior Downing Street officials who had approved the leaking of a crucial letter from the Solicitor General Patrick Mayhew, in which he questioned some of the statements that Heseltine had made about the takeover contest of the Westland helicopter company. Brittan&#x27;s claim that Ingham and Charles Powell had approved the leak of the letter led to calls from some Labour MPs for there to be a new inquiry into the Westland affair.

Ingham was knighted on Thatcher&#x27;s resignation – and retirement – in 1990. His successor as press secretary was Gus O&#x27;Donnell, who went on to become Cabinet secretary and head of the civil service in 2005.

Ingham&#x27;s memoir &quot;Kill the Messenger&quot;, concerning his time as press secretary, was criticised by Paul Foot, a Marxist journalist, who commented that &quot;... there is no information in this book. I picked it up eagerly, refusing to believe that someone so close to the top for so long could fail to reveal, even by mistake, a single interesting piece of information&quot; and he was particularly scathing about Ingham&#x27;s prose style, offering the following quotation from &quot;Kill the Messenger&quot; as representative of Ingham&#x27;s use of English: &quot;Like a mighty oak, it took more than one axe to bring Mrs Thatcher down. In November 1990 they were cutting into this solid timber from all angles. The frenzy was fearsome to behold. Heaven preserve us from political axe-men in a state of panic. They would cut off their grandmas in their prime if they thought it would serve their interests. And so they cut off a grandma in her international prime by the stocking tops, to borrow one of Denis&#x27;s phrases, which Mrs Thatcher often used.&quot;

In a commentary in the &quot;Daily Express&quot; in April 2009, Ingham referred to Thatcher as &quot;reckless&quot; and a battler for Britain. He said her greatest quality was that she did not want to be loved, and she came to office without a Press Secretary and had &quot;the enormous will&quot; to overcome &quot;defeatist inertia&quot;, such as: &quot;Oh you can&#x27;t do that Prime Minister, they won&#x27;t allow it&quot;. He attended her funeral at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in April 2013.

===Television script===
Ingham helped Thatcher in the writing of the &quot;Yes Minister&quot; sketch, which she performed in public with Paul Eddington and Nigel Hawthorne.
In December 2001, Ingham said, on the death of Hawthorne, &quot;Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s fascination was with the games between the elected politician and the unelected official&quot;.

==After Thatcher==
Ingham was vice-president of Country Guardian, an anti-wind energy campaign group. Ingham was also a regular panellist on BBC current affairs programme &quot;Dateline London&quot;.
He had also been secretary to Supporters of Nuclear Energy (SONE, 1998–2007), a group of individuals who seek to promote nuclear power in the United Kingdom. 
Despite never having attended university himself, Ingham lectured in public relations at Middlesex University. He returned to the &quot;Yorkshire Post&quot; as a columnist, writing until January 2023.

===&quot;Brass Eye&quot;===
Ingham appeared on the satirical television programme, &quot;Brass Eye&quot;. He was persuaded to appear in a short sequence, in which he issued a stern warning to young people about the dangers of a purported new drug, &quot;cake&quot;, one of several celebrities who appeared not to recognise the satirical nature of the programme. Ingham said that &quot;several people have actually been brained by saucepans used to make this kind of Cake&quot;, before asking viewers to &quot;use their cheese-box&quot; and &quot;say no, never&quot;.

===Court case===
On 8 March 1999, Ingham was bound over to keep the peace at Croydon Magistrates&#x27; Court after he was accused of causing criminal damage to a Mercedes car owned by Linda Cripps, a neighbour, in Purley, south London. The charges were dropped when Ingham agreed to accept being bound over for 12 months in the sum of £1,000 to keep the peace and be of good behaviour. Ingham denied that he had caused any damage to the vehicle.

The court was told that Cripps told Ingham: &quot;You have damaged my car&quot;, to which he replied, &quot;Good, I&#x27;m glad&quot;. Ingham said, &quot;I did not cause the damage complained of and to resolve the issue I accepted advice that I should agree to be bound over. I have paid £792 to cover the cost of the alleged damage to the car.&quot; Cripps&#x27;s husband said after the case &quot;We are weary of the constant bombardment that we have suffered. We are no match for Sir Bernard Ingham. Let&#x27;s hope that he will now allow us to get on with our lives peacefully&quot;.

===Hillsborough===
In a letter addressed to a parent of a victim of the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, Ingham reiterated his belief that the disaster was caused by &quot;tanked up yobs&quot;, a view later entirely refuted by the Hillsborough inquest. In a 1996 letter written to a Liverpool FC supporter, Ingham remarked that people should &quot;shut up about Hillsborough&quot;. 

In June 1996, on &quot;Question Time&quot;, Ingham spoke in favour of compensating the police present at the time of the disaster, saying: &quot;If thousands of ticketless fans had not turned up and pushed their way into the ground then the whole scenario would not have occurred.&quot; &quot;You can&#x27;t get away from what you were told,&quot; Ingham said. &quot;We talked to a lot of people; I am not sure if it was the chief constable. That was the impression I gathered: there were a lot of tanked-up people outside.&quot; Speaking to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, he confirmed that this was what he was told when he and Margaret Thatcher were shown around, although he could not recall if South Yorkshire police&#x27;s chief constable, Peter Wright, had said it personally.

Hebden Bridge residents launched a campaign against Ingham to remove him as a local newspaper columnist over his continued refusal to apologise for his words in the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster. He continued to write articles until February 2013. On 26 April 2016, a jury gave the verdict that the 96 killed at Hillsborough were unlawfully killed and that the Liverpool fans&#x27; behaviour did not contribute to the dangerous situation at the turnstiles. Ingham declined to apologise or respond to the previous comments he made, which led to petitions being created on change.org and petitions.parliament.uk, the official website for government petitions.

===Comments on Scottish nationalists===
Ingham suggested Scottish nationalists were being &quot;as greedy as sin&quot;, stating that &quot;the only thing that fuelled nationalism was the smell of oil and money in oil&quot;, suggesting that any nationalist sentiments were merely a disguised form of greed.

==Thatcher&#x27;s papers==
In March 2011, it was reported by &quot;The Independent&quot; that Policy chief Sir Keith Joseph stated in public the view that Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s first year in Downing Street had been &quot;wasted&quot;. Joseph&#x27;s press secretary reported this to Ingham. In his reply, contained in a letter dated 1 December 1980, he said Thatcher was &quot;quite relaxed about it&quot;, adding: &quot;I believe she agrees with Sir Keith but for the sake of the government and confidence in it does not say so.&quot;

==Personal life ==
Ingham was knighted in Thatcher&#x27;s 1990 resignation honours list.

Ingham was married to Nancy () for 60 years until she died in 2017. They had a son.

Ingham lived in a care home in Caterham, Surrey, in his last years. He died on 24 February 2023, at the age of 90.

==Cultural depictions==
Ingham has been depicted multiple times in film and television, including being portrayed by Glyn Houston in &quot;&quot; (1991), Philip Jackson in &quot;Margaret&quot; (2009), Kevin McNally in season four of &quot;The Crown&quot; (2020), and Paul Clayton in both &quot;The Queen&quot; (2009) and &quot;Brian and Maggie&quot; (2025).

<text>Michael John Heath is a British strip cartoonist and illustrator. He has been cartoon editor of &quot;The Spectator&quot; since 1991.

==Biography==

Heath was born on 13 October 1935, in Bloomsbury, London. His father, George Heath, was also a cartoonist of boy&#x27;s adventure comics, a job he detested. Heath&#x27;s relationship with both his parents was distant and neither birthdays nor Christmas were celebrated. During the war Heath was evacuated to his grandmother&#x27;s house in Torcross, in Devon. In 1947 the family moved to Brighton. While studying at art college, which he loathed, Heath sold his first cartoons to &quot;Melody Maker&quot; for two guineas. He later got work illustrating album covers for Decca Records and drew a strip called &quot;Nelly Know-all&quot; for the &quot;Women&#x27;s Sunday Mirror&quot;. By the 1960s he was part of the Soho social crowd that included Jeffrey Bernard, Lucian Freud and Francis Bacon.

His work has appeared in numerous British publications including &quot;Punch&quot;, &quot;Lilliput&quot;, the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;, &quot;The Evening News&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Spectator&quot;, &quot;The Independent&quot;, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot;, and &quot;Private Eye&quot;; all his work is signed simply as &quot;HEATH&quot;.

He has been cartoon editor of &quot;The Spectator&quot; since 1991, and the cartoons which are published have not always adhered to the magazine&#x27;s conservative politics. Heath&#x27;s own political cartoons have also appeared in &quot;The Independent&quot;.

In August 2016 he was the guest for the long-running BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;Desert Island Discs.&quot; His favourite choice was &quot;Criss Cross&quot; by Thelonious Monk. His other choices were &quot;Dance of the Infidels&quot; by Bud Powell, &quot;Teddy Bears&#x27; Picnic&quot; by Henry Hall &amp; His Orchestra, &quot;Max In An Air Raid (I Never Slept A Wink All Night)&quot; by Max Miller, &quot;Take a Step&quot; by Jack Buchanan, &quot;All the Things You Are&quot; by The Quintet, &quot;Funny Face&quot; by Fred and Adele Astaire, with Julian Jones &amp; His Orchestra and &quot;Lover&quot; by Charlie Parker. His book choice was &quot;The Diary of a Nobody&quot; by George and Weedon Grossmith and his luxury item was an artist&#x27;s painting set.

Heath has been married three times, the first time for 32 years, the second time for 18 years. He has four daughters in total, two from each of his first two marriages. He kept a black and tan Dachshund, Charlie, for many years until Charlie&#x27;s death in August 2019. Michael now lives with his third wife, Hilary (née Penn), in Bloomsbury.

==Cartoon series==

===Great Bores of Today===

&quot;Great Bores of Today&quot; was a long-running series in &quot;Private Eye&quot;. Each has a single frame, in which some immediately recognizable species of modern cultural bore is seen in his or her natural environs, haranguing bystanders, reporters, the viewer, or imagined listeners. Underneath is a lengthy chunk of the logorrhea that the bore utters distinguished in particular by the bland inconsistency of the bore&#x27;s opinions. (The text is contributed by other &quot;Private Eye&quot; regulars.) The series has been resurrected in Richard Ingram&#x27;s monthly magazine, &quot;The Oldie&quot;, with illustrations again by Heath.

===The Suits===

A series that appeared in &quot;The Spectator&quot;, lampooning the interchangeability and solemnity of men in their suits (or the utter helplessness of the normally besuited when temporarily deprived of their suits).

===The Regulars===

&quot;The Regulars&quot; ran in &quot;Private Eye&quot;; the &quot;regulars&quot; are Jeffrey Bernard and the other regular customers of the Coach &amp; Horses pub in Soho. The cartoons were used in the play &quot;Jeffrey Bernard is Unwell&quot;.

===The Gays===

Another series in &quot;Private Eye&quot;, from the early 1980s.

===Style Victims===

Published in the London &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, this series makes fun of the conscious, and unconscious, style or fashion victims. (One frame shows a pair of sour-faced judges in ceremonial clothes and wigs, one grimly asking the other &quot;What is a style victim?&quot;)

===Numero Uno===

A series that ran in &quot;Private Eye&quot;, &quot;Numero Uno&quot; makes fun of baseball-capped youth, with Walkman earphones permanently implanted in ears.

===The Outlaw===

A short lived strip set in the year 2000, where Michael Common is &quot;the last person to smoke in England&quot;. Published in &quot;The Spectator&quot;.

===Partners===

Partnership and baby-rearing in the England of the 90s. Published in &quot;The Independent&quot;.

===Henry King===

A disturbingly precocious baby, permanently wearing a baseball cap. Published in &quot;The Spectator&quot;.

<doc id="1164441" wikidata="Q1587215" url="?curid=1164441" title="Mount Sunflower">
<text>Mount Sunflower, although not a true mountain, is the highest natural point in the U.S. state of Kansas. At , it is above the state&#x27;s topographic low point, which lies on the opposite side of the state. It is located between the communities of Kanorado and Weskan in Wallace County, less than half a mile (0.8 km) from the state border with Colorado and is near the lowest point in Colorado.

Mount Sunflower is located on private land owned by Ed and Cindy Harold, who encourage visitors to the site. Amenities include a picnic table, a little free library, a sunflower sculpture made from railroad spikes, and a plaque on the site stating, &quot;On this site in 1897, nothing happened.&quot; Additionally, there is a mailbox on the site with a registration book inside where visitors can write their names, where they are from, and how many members are in their party.

Access is via county dirt roads to the edge of the property, then across a cattle guard and onto a private dirt road through a cattle grazing pasture to the summit. Mount Sunflower was designated as Kansas’s highest point by the United States Geological Survey in 1961. In the late 1970s Ed Harold decided to commemorate this site, homesteaded by his grandparents in 1906. The most famous attraction at the site is the sunflower sculpture made from railroad spikes that are welded together.

The state of Kansas gradually increases in elevation from the east to the west. As such, Mount Sunflower, while the highest natural point in the state in terms of elevation, is virtually indistinguishable from the surrounding terrain.

The book is about a 15-year-old girl named Janie Johnson, who starts to suspect that her parents may have kidnapped her and that her biological parents are somewhere in New Jersey. These suspicions come after Janie recognizes a picture of herself on a milk carton under the heading &quot;Missing Child.&quot; Janie&#x27;s life gets more stressful as she tries to find the truth while hiding the secret from her parents.

The idea for the novel originated from the regular practice in the 1980s and 1990s for milk cartons to feature photographs of missing children.

&quot;The Face on the Milk Carton&quot;, which contains themes including the exploration of self-identity, relationships with parents and peers, and individual responsibility, has been used in young adult classrooms to encourage readers to explore these themes in their own lives.

The book was number 79 on the most frequently challenged books in the US for 1990-1999 and number 29 for 2000-2009 for references to kidnapping, cults, challenges to authority, and sexual activity. The book has also received several awards, including the Colorado Blue Spruce Book Award (1996) and the Pacific Northwest Library Association Young Readers Choice Award (1993).

== Summary==
While at lunch on a typical day of school, Janie Johnson&#x27;s life is upended after she picks up a friend&#x27;s milk carton and recognizes herself as the girl in a missing person photo on the back of the carton. The child is identified as ‘Jennie Spring,’ a girl who was kidnapped from a New Jersey shopping mall when she was three years old. Although Janie refuses to believe that her loving parents could have kidnapped her, she begins having flashbacks that do not fit in with her current life.

After her mother appears reluctant when she asks to see her birth certificate, Janie searches her home&#x27;s attic for any information that could shed light on her flashbacks. After finding school papers with the name &#x27;Hannah Javensen&#x27; and the dress worn by the girl on the milk carton, Janie confronts her parents.

Janie&#x27;s parents explain that Hannah is their daughter, and that Janie is Hannah&#x27;s daughter, making them her grandparents. According to her parents, Hannah was a confused teen who had joined a Hare Krishna style cult at a young age and was married off to one of the men in the cult. One day, Hannah showed up at the Johnson&#x27;s house with Janie, and left her there before returning to the cult. The Johnsons, fearing the cult might want Janie back, fled the state and changed their name from &#x27;Javensen&#x27; to &#x27;Johnson.&#x27; Janie, relieved her parents are not kidnappers, concludes that her flashbacks are from her life in the cult before coming to the Johnson&#x27;s.

Despite her relief, Janie struggles to forget the picture on the milk carton and her flashbacks, and begins researching the Jennie Spring kidnapping. Discrepancies between her research and her parents&#x27; story leads her to suspect that her parents may have actually kidnapped her. Although she still loves them and wants to forgive them, Janie decides to further investigate the kidnapping. Along with her boyfriend Reeve, Janie goes to New Jersey to find the Spring family.

In New Jersey, they discover that the entire family has the same red hair that Janie has, which neither Mr. and Mrs. Johnson or even Hannah has. Unsure of what to do, Janie writes the Spring family a letter, but hesitates to mail it. She loses the letter, and worries it has been mailed by someone, which would inform the Spring family.

Janie asks her parents what to do about the letter, and confronts them with what she has learned. A shocked Mr. and Mrs. Johnson reason that Hannah must have kidnapped Janie, and insist, against Janie&#x27;s wishes, that they call the Springs. The book ends with Janie calling the New Jersey family.

== Background ==
According to an interview with &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, Cooney&#x27;s inspiration came to her at LaGuardia Airport, where she saw missing child flyers, including one of a toddler, posted throughout the concourse. The posters struck her, and led her to imagine what it might be like if a toddler recognized herself on a poster.

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, it was regular practice for milk cartons to feature photographs of missing children. The practice began after a series of high-profile child kidnappings by noncustodial parents in the late 1970s led to renewed attention on law enforcement&#x27;s tendency to neglect cases that involved children staying with noncustodial parents. Widespread dissatisfaction with this practice prompted a campaign for law enforcement to pursue all missing children cases more aggressively.

== Genre and style ==
&quot;The Face on the Milk Carton&quot;, similarly to many of Cooney&#x27;s novels, is a young adult mystery and suspense novel. The recommended age range is 12 and up.

== Analysis ==
Authors John Bushman and Shelley McNerny, who specialize in analyzing young adult literature, recognize &quot;The Face on the Milk Carton&quot;, along with several other young adult novels, as a text that instructors can use to guide the development of young adults’ moral reasoning. This is because the novel contains a variety of themes, including the exploration of self-identity, relationships with parents and peers, and individual responsibility, that will challenge readers to examine the dynamics that the novel&#x27;s protagonist faces in the context of their own lives.

In her article “Mirrors and Windows,” editor Kim Ford lists &quot;The Face on the Milk Carton&quot; as one of her thirty recommended books, as a young adult favorite, to put on a “good book” shelf. Ford further notes that many of the most popular books among young adults, including &quot;The Face on the Milk Carton,&quot; are those that are both “mirrors” and “windows,” or books that allow readers to see and understand themselves in the novels’ characters.

== Publication ==
&quot;The Face on the Milk Carton&quot; was first published in 1990 by Bantam Doubleday Dell Books for Young Readers. The last book of the series, &quot;Janie Face to Face&quot;, was published in January 2014.

== Reception ==
&quot;The Face on the Milk Carton&quot; has been the recipient of several awards, including the Colorado Blue Spruce Book Award (1996), Pacific Northwest Library Association Young Readers Choice Award (1993), and Iowa Teen Book Award (1993).

Cumulatively, the series has sold over 4.2 million copies.

The novel has also faced challenges for its mature content. The book was number 79 on the most frequently challenged books in the US for 1990-1999 and number 29 for 2000-2009 for references to kidnapping, cults, and sexual activity.

<doc id="1164446" wikidata="Q208763" url="?curid=1164446" title="African sacred ibis">
<text>The African sacred ibis (Threskiornis aethiopicus) is a species of ibis, a wading bird of the family Threskiornithidae. It is native to much of Africa, as well as small parts of Iraq, Iran and Kuwait. It is especially known for its role in Ancient Egyptian religion, where it was linked to the god Thoth. The species is currently extirpated from Egypt.

== Taxonomy ==
It is very closely related to the black-headed ibis and the Australian white ibis, with which it forms a superspecies complex, so much so that the three species are considered conspecific by some ornithologists. In mixed flocks these ibises often hybridise. The Australian white ibis is often called the sacred ibis colloquially.

Although known to the ancient civilisations of Greece, Rome and especially Africa, ibises were unfamiliar to western Europeans from the fall of Rome until the 19th century, and mentions of this bird in the ancient works of these civilisations were supposed to describe some type of curlew or other bird, and were thus translated as such. In 1758, Linnaeus was convinced that the ancient authors were describing a cattle egret (&quot;Bubulcus ibis&quot;), which he thus described as &quot;Ardea ibis&quot;. Following the work of Mathurin Jacques Brisson, who calls it &quot;Ibis candida&quot; in 1760, in the 12th edition of his Systema Naturae of 1766 Linnaeus classifies it as &quot;Tantalus ibis&quot;. These were also unfamiliar birds that did not occur in Europe at the time, in English in these times called the &#x27;Egyptian ibis&#x27; by Latham, and the &#x27;emseesy&#x27; or &#x27;ox-bird&#x27; by George Shaw.

In 1790, John Latham provided the first unambiguous modern scientific description of the sacred ibis as &quot;Tantalus aethiopicus&quot;, mentioning James Bruce of Kinnaird who called it &#x27;abou hannes&#x27; in his writings describing his travels in Sudan and Ethiopia, and also described &quot;Tantalus melanocephalus&quot; of India.

Georges Cuvier named it &quot;Ibis religiosus&quot; in his &quot;Le Règne Animal&quot; of 1817.

In 1842, George Robert Gray reclassified the bird under the new genus &quot;Threskiornis&quot;, because the type of the genus &quot;Tantalus&quot; was designated as to be the wood stork, also formerly known as the wood ibis or wood pelican, and Gray decided these birds could not be classified in the same genus.

In a comprehensive review of plumage patterns by Holyoak in 1970, it was noted that the three taxa were extremely similar and that the Australian birds resembled &quot;Threskiornis aethiopicus&quot; in adult plumage and &quot;T. melanocephalus&quot; in juvenile plumage, he thus proposed they all be considered part of a single species &quot;T. aethiopicus&quot;. At the time, this was generally accepted by the scientific community; however, in &#x27;The Birds of the Western Palearctic&#x27; compendium of 1977, Roselaar advocated splitting the group into four species, recognising &quot;T. bernieri&quot;, based again on the then known geographical morphological differences.

In 1990, Sibley &amp; Monroe, in the general reference &#x27;Distribution and Taxonomy of Birds of the World&#x27; followed Roselaar in recognising four species, which they repeated in &#x27;A World Checklist of Birds&#x27; of 1993.

This taxon being split from &quot;T. melanocephalus&quot; and &quot;T. molucca&quot; was further advocated by another morphological study by Lowe and Richards in 1991, where they looked at plumage, bill and neck sack morphology and used many more skins. They concluded that the differences were such to merit separate species status for the three taxa, especially as they could find no intergradation in morphological characters in possible contact zones in SE Asia. They also cite observed differences in courtship displays between the Australian and African birds. Based on these characteristics they recommended the Madagascan birds &quot;T. bernieri&quot; and &quot;T. abbotti&quot; be considered a subspecies of &quot;T. aethiopicus&quot;.

== Description ==

An adult individual is long with all-white body plumage apart from dark plumes on the rump. Wingspan is and body weight . Males are generally slightly larger than females.

The bald head and neck, thick curved bill and legs are black. The white wings show a black rear border in flight. The eyes are brown with a dark red orbital ring. Sexes are similar, but juveniles have dirty white plumage, a smaller bill and some feathering on the neck, greenish-brown scapulars and more black on the primary coverts.

This bird is usually silent, but occasionally makes puppy-like yelping noises, unlike its vocal relative, the hadada ibis.

== Distribution ==
=== Native ===
The sacred ibis breeds in Sub-Saharan Africa and southeastern Iraq. A number of populations are migrant with the rains; some of the South African birds migrate 1,500 km as far north as Zambia, the African birds north of the equator migrate in the opposite direction. The Iraqi population usually migrates to southwestern Iran, but wandering vagrants have been seen as far south as Oman (rare, but regular) and as far north as the Caspian coasts of Kazakhstan and Russia (before 1945).

==== Africa ====
It was formerly found in North Africa including Egypt, where it was commonly venerated and mummified as a votive offering to the god Thoth. For many centuries until the Roman period the main temples buried a few dozen of thousands of birds a year, and to sustain sufficient numbers for the demand for sacrifices by pilgrims from all over Egypt, it was for some time believed that ibis breeding farms (called &quot;ibiotropheia&quot; by Herodotus) existed. Aristotle mentions in c. 350 BC that many sacred ibises are found all over Egypt. Strabo, writing around 20 AD, mentions large amounts of the birds in the streets of Alexandria, where he was living at the time; picking through the trash, attacking provisions, and defiling everything with their dung. Pierre Belon notes the many ibises in Egypt during his travels there in the late 1540s (he thought they were an odd type of stork). Benoît de Maillet, in his &quot;Description de l&#x27;Egypte&quot; (1735) relates that at the turn of the 17th century, when the great caravans travelled yearly to Mecca, great clouds of ibises would follow them from Egypt for over a hundred leagues into the desert to feed on the dung left at the encampments. By 1850, however, the species had disappeared from Egypt both as a breeding and migrant population, with the last, albeit questionable, sighting in 1864. An examination of the genetic diversity among mummified ibises suggested that there was no reduction in genetic diversity as would be caused if they were bred in captivity and further studies on isotopes suggest that the birds were not just wild caught but came from a wide geographic range.

The species did not breed in southern Africa before the beginning of the 20th century, but it has benefited from irrigation, dams, and commercial agricultural practices such as dung heaps, carrion and refuse tips. It began to breed in the early 20th century, and in the 1970s the first colonies of ibises were recorded in Zimbabwe and South Africa. Its population for example expanded 2-3-fold during the period between 1972 and 1995 in Orange Free State. It is now found throughout southern Africa. The species is a common resident in most parts of South Africa. Local numbers are swollen in summer by individuals migrating southwards from the equator.

Elsewhere in Africa it occurs throughout the continent south of the Sahara, but it is largely absent in the deserts of southwestern Africa (i.e. the Namib, the Karoo, the Kalahari) and probably the rainforests of the Congo. In west Africa it is fairly uncommon across the Sahel, except for the major floodplain systems. It can commonly found breeding along the Niger, in the Inner Niger Delta of Mali, the Logone of C.A.R., Lac Fitri in Chad, the Saloum Delta of Senegal, and other localities in relatively small numbers such as in The Gambia. It is common across eastern Africa and southern Africa. Large numbers can be found in the Sudd swamps and Lake Kundi in Sudan in the dry season. It is fairly widespread along the upper Nile River, and is quite common around Mogadishu, Somalia. In Tanzania there are a number of sites with 500 to 1,000+ birds, totalling some 20,000 birds.

==== Asia ====
The bird is also native to Yemen; in 2003 it bred in large numbers on small islands near Haramous and along the Red Sea coast near Hodeidah and Aden, where it was often found at waste-water treatment plants. It has been recorded nesting on a shipwreck in the Red Sea. It is also seen as a vagrant on Socotra.
With the Yemen Civil War and famine, there have been no new census reports on the species in Yemen, though an estimate of approximately 30 mature individuals was given in 2015.

The species was fairly common in Iraq in the first half of the 20th century, but by the late 1960s it had become very scarce, with the population thought to number no more than 200 birds. The population was thought to have suffered greatly during the draining of the Mesopotamian Marshes of southeastern Iraq starting in the late 1980s, and feared to have disappeared entirely, but it has continuously been observed breeding in a colony in the Hawizeh Marshes (a part of the Mesopotamian Marshes) as of 2008, numbering up to 27 adults. It is also native to Kuwait, where it occurs as an extremely rare migrant, with only two known sightings, the last being a flock of 17 in 2007.

There are no records of the bird in Iran before the 1970s; however, small numbers were found overwintering in Khuzestan in 1970. Since the 1990s numbers appear to have slowly increased to a few dozen.

=== Introduced ===
The first African sacred ibises brought to Europe were two imported from Egypt to France in the mid-1700s. In the 1800s the first escapes were sighted in Europe (in Austria, Italy). In the 1970s it became fashionable for many zoos in Europe and elsewhere to keep their birds in free-flying colonies, which were allowed to forage in the area but would return to roost in the zoo every day. As such feral populations were established in Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, the Canary Islands, Florida, Taiwan, the United Arab Emirates and possibly Bahrain.

Some studies indicate that the introduced populations in Europe have significant economic and ecological impacts, while others suggest that they constitute no substantial threat to native European bird species.

==== Europe ====
In Europe, the African sacred ibis is included since 2016 in the list of Invasive Alien Species of Union concern (the Union list). This implies that this species cannot be imported, bred, transported, commercialized, or intentionally released into the environment in the whole of the European Union.

In France the African sacred ibises have become established along its Atlantic coast following the feral breeding of birds which were the offspring of a large free-flying population originating from the Branféré Zoological Gardens in southern Brittany. The first successful breeding was in 1993 at two sites, the Golfe du Morbihan and Lac de Grand-Lieu, and respectively from Branféré. By 2005 the Atlantic French breeding population was estimated at 1,100 pairs and winter censuses led to an estimated total population of up to 3,000 birds. A separate population originated from a zoo at Sigean on the Mediterranean coast of France and by 2005 the colony at the Étang de Bages-Sigean was estimated at 250 pairs. A cull was begun and by 2011 the population had fallen to 560–600 pairs. By January 2017 the eradication programme had lowered the number of birds in roosts in western France to 300–500 birds and the Lac de Grand-Lieu was the only regular breeding site in the region; as the programme has progressed the birds have become warier and the reduced numbers mean the effort and cost per bird has increased and complete eradication may never be achieved. The population near Sigean was eradicated by killing and capturing the birds with only a few remaining in the Camargue.

This species is not considered established in mainland Spain. The Barcelona Zoo kept a small free-flying population which bred in the zoo and at least once in 1974 in the surrounding city park. Between 1983 and 1985 they had increased to 18 birds, but these subsequently declined to 4–6 pairs in the 1990s and the birds were permanently caged by the end of the 1990s (the zoo still has some). In 2001 the remaining birds in the surroundings were culled, thus ending the occurrence of the species in the &#x27;wild&#x27; in the area. However, in the early 2000s vagrants most probably from France were recorded in northern Catalonia, and sporadic observations throughout the year have been recorded since then along the Mediterranean and Cantabrian coasts. There were a total of about twenty approved records of sightings between 1994 and 2004. As of 2009, birds entering Spain from France are shot.
The population in Italy may have been introduced from the zoo Le Cornelle which has kept a free-flying group since the early 1980s, or possibly from Brittany, but this is unclear. The first pair was seen breeding in the nearby heronry at Oldenico, in Lame del Sesia Regional Park in Novara, NW Italy, in 1989. By 1998 there was a colony of 9 pairs and 48 birds there; by 2000 there were 24–26 pairs, and by 2003 there were 25–30 breeding pairs. A second colony appeared in 2004 at another nearby heronry at Casalbeltrame. These birds would mostly feed in the rice fields in the area, but would also migrate elsewhere during the summer, with the population at the roosts increasing in the winter. In 2008, the number of breeding ibis was estimated at 80–100 pairs, and at least 300 birds. That same year, six individuals, consisting of three pairs, were observed roosting at a heronry in Casaleggio. By 2009 they were said to be one of the most characteristic animals of the rice-growing area of Novara and Vercellese. In 2010 the species was reported attempting to breed in the Po Delta, northeast Italy. By 2014 reports of individuals and small flocks were recorded in various areas from the Po Valley down to Tuscany. Outside the Piedmont Region, cases of possible nesting are reported in Emilia-Romagna, Veneto and Lombardy. As of 2017 there do not seem to be coordinated control efforts in Italy.

In the Netherlands, sacred ibises were introduced from three sources; primarily from the free-flying flock at the aviary zoo Avifauna, and another group of 11 birds which escaped from a private bird trader in Weert when a tree fell on their enclosure sometime between 1998 and 2000 which would all return to their cage each winter. Furthermore, in 2000 a group of sacred ibises escaped from a zoo near Münster, some of which apparently crossed the border into Overijssel, as the colours of their rings closely matched. The free-flying Avifauna flock numbered 12 in 2001, 30 in 2003, and an estimated maximum of 41 birds escaped the zoo eventually. There had been sightings throughout the country for many years, but in 2002 successful breeding was first reported in a nature reserve some 40 km from Avifauna. 
By 2007 the feral population in the Netherlands had increased to 15 pairs breeding at three locations, including in a tree just outside the zoo. Pairs would regularly move from the zoo to the nature reserve in the summer and vice versa. The next year, in 2008, the tree outside the zoo was cut down, and free-flying birds were recaptured, clipped and caged. 2008/2009 was also a cold winter and many birds died. By 2009 37 birds had been recaptured and by 2010 there were no more birds breeding in the wild. The birds in Weert were halved in number after the 2008–2009 winter and had disappeared somewhere between 2011 and 2015. As of 2016 a few birds survive, some still attempting to breed in Overijssel, and handful sightings of less than three reported. Possible vagrants from France have also been noted (by their rings) after 2010.

==== Elsewhere ====
The sacred ibis is not considered invasive on the Canary Islands. It is kept in zoos on Tenerife, Gran Canaria, Lanzarote and Fuerteventura, two of which kept their collections free-flying. In 1989, the first ibis was seen in the wild. In 1997, the first pair was seen breeding outside a zoo, the population reached a maximum of 5 pairs between then and 2005, and 30 pairs is given by Clergeau &amp; Yésou in 2006 (though this last number is untrustworthy). The birds are divided between the islands Lanzarote (near Arrecife in an old heron colony) and Fuerteventura (in the zoo near La Lajita but free-flying). On both islands, these birds have remained very near to the zoos. The breeding is &#x27;controlled&#x27;. There is disagreement regarding the origin of other records, especially during the migratory period. Ibises have been seen on all four of the islands where there are zoos that keep them.

Introduced sacred ibises bred in the United Arab Emirates in the wildlife reserve on Sir Bani Yas Island, where 6 were introduced in the early 1980s, and which did not leave the island. There was only one left in 1989 and it died that year. Al Ain Zoo has had a flock since 1976, which had increased to some 70 birds by 1991. There are records of ibises showing up in Dubai since the 1980s. Birds in Al Ain initially stayed at the zoo, but began to fly from the zoo to the sewage treatment plant and a shallow wet area in the former public park, now luxury villa park, Ain Al Fayda, where their numbers increased slowly up to 32 in 1997 and they had bred by 1998. They were not numerous outside these locations in 2002, but by 2001 1–5 ibises would show up regularly in Dubai in such places as the golf course, the sewage treatment plant, and the construction site of the now completed Dubai International City. Breeding has since occurred in Dubai. The Dubai birds especially may be partially vagrants arrived from the Iraqi marshes, as they often show up during the migrating season. On the other hand, a bird showing up in Iran is suspected to be from the introduced UAE population. As of 2010 the population in Al Ain numbers over 75 birds, and the free-flying zoo birds roost in two subcolonies on top of their aviary. Birds regularly show up throughout the city and surrounding villages and can often be seen in the early morning in parks and roundabouts picking up scraps left by people the night before.

A breeding population was listed as introduced on Bahrain since at least 2006, but it is also said to be a vagrant on the island.

In Taiwan, the founding population escaped from a zoo prior to 1984, at which time the first wild birds were seen at Guandu in Taipei. In 1998 it was estimated that some 200 birds roamed freely, primarily in northern Taiwan. In 2010 it was added to the Checklist of Birds of Taiwan with the status of &#x27;uncommon&#x27; (as opposed to &#x27;rare&#x27;). By 2010 the birds were also occasionally sighted on the Matsu Islands, which are only 19 km off the coast of Fujian province in mainland China (and only a few kilometres from other coastal Chinese islands), but 190 km from Taiwan. In 2012 the population was estimated to be 500–600 individuals, and had spread to the west of Taiwan. The first attempts at culling were performed in 2012 using the egg-oiling method (unsuccessful), and by killing chicks from nests (successful). By 2016 the number was estimated at 1000 individuals, of whom around 500 inhabited a wetland in Changhua County. In 2018, the Forestry Bureau embarked on the removal of the population by cooperating with the indigenous hunters, and by August 2021, at least 16,205 birds had been removed by the program.

In Florida five individuals of the species are thought to have escaped Miami Metro Zoo, and perhaps more from private collections, after Hurricane Andrew in 1992. These birds lived in the surroundings but would return to roost at the zoo at night, and the population slowly increased to 30 or 40 by 2005. That same year two pairs were found nesting in the Everglades. Two or three years later the decision was made to remove the species. By 2009 75 birds were removed from Florida, and the birds are believed to be eradicated.

== Ecology ==
=== Habitat ===
The African sacred ibis occurs in marshy wetlands and mud flats, both inland and on the coast. It preferably nests on trees in or near water. It feeds wading in very shallow wetlands or slowly stomping in wet pastures with soft soil. It will also visit cultivation and rubbish dumps.

=== Diet ===
The species are predators which feed primarily by day, generally in flocks. The diet consists of mainly insects, worms, crustaceans, molluscs and other invertebrates, as well as various fish, frogs, reptiles, small mammals and carrion. It may also probe into the soil with its long beak for invertebrates such as earthworms. It even sometimes feeds on seeds.

Sacred ibises were observed to occasionally feed on the contents of pelican eggs broken by Egyptian vultures in the mixed colonies of the ibises, cormorants, pelicans and Abdim&#x27;s storks at Lake Shala in Ethiopia. On Central Island in Lake Turkana sacred ibises were noted to incidentally eat Nile crocodile eggs excavated by Nile monitors. Most recently, in 2006, observations were reported from a large mixed colony on Bird Island (called Penguin Island in the article) in South Africa, where 10,000 pairs of gannets nested, together with 4800 pairs of Cape cormorant and other species such as gulls and jackass penguin. Within a period of 3 years, a few specialized sacred ibis individuals out of the 400 that roosted on the island had fed on at least 152 eggs of the cormorant (other species were even more ovivorous).

In a study of pellets and stomachs contents of nestlings in the Free State, South Africa, food is mostly reported to consist of frogs (mainly &quot;Amietia angolensis&quot; and &quot;Xenopus laevis&quot;), &quot;Potamonautes warreni&quot; crabs, blow fly maggots, Sphingidae caterpillars, and adult beetles. During the first 10 days of life nestlings fed mainly on crabs and beetles, and later mainly on Sphingidae caterpillars and more beetles. The breeding colony collected different (proportions of) prey the subsequent year. The food of one one-month-old nestlings at Lake Shala, Ethiopia, consisted of beetle larvae, caterpillars and beetles. In France, adult ibises fed largely on the invasive crayfish &quot;Procambarus clarkii&quot;, for nestlings larvae of &quot;Eristalis&quot; species are important.

In France, they sometimes supplement their diet by feeding at rubbish tips in the winter.

=== Predators ===
The most important predator of nestlings of the sacred ibis in Kenya is the African fish eagle, which preferentially searches for the largest (sub-)colonies to attack, but in Ethiopia and South Africa it poses less of a threat.

=== Diseases ===
This species was reported to be susceptible to avian botulism in a list of dead animals found around a man-made lake in South Africa which tested positive for the pathogen in the late 1960s and early 1970s. During a large scale mortality of Cape cormorants from avian cholera in 1991 in western South Africa, small numbers of sacred ibis were killed. The new species &quot;Chlamydia ibidis&quot; was isolated from feral sacred ibis in France in 2013; it infected 6–7 of the 70 birds tested.

In 1887, the Italian scientist Corrado Parona reported a 3 cm &quot;Physaloptera&quot; species of nematode in the orbital cavity of a sacred ibis collected in Metemma, Abyssinia (now Ethiopia) in 1882. He thought it was perhaps a new species, as it differed morphologically from earlier seen worms. A single adult female was recovered, and it has never been seen again. As the &quot;Physaloptera&quot; species infecting birds are generally parasites of the intestines of raptors; it might be an artefact, or perhaps a misidentification, or possibly a dead-end host infection. The digenean trematode &quot;Patagifer bilobus&quot;, a fluke, has been reported from sacred ibis in Sudan before 1949. It lives in the small intestine of this species, among numerous other ibises, spoonbills, and a few other waterfowl. It has a complicated life history involving three hosts: the eggs hatch in fresh water where they infect a ram&#x27;s horn snail in which they multiply and produce cercariae, which exit and encyst in a larger snail such as a &quot;Lymnaea&quot;, waiting to be eaten by a bird.

== Reproduction ==
The species usually breeds once per year in the wet season. Breeding season is from March to August in Africa, from April to May in Iraq. It builds a stick nest, often in a baobab tree. The bird nests in tree colonies, often with other large wading birds such as storks, herons, African spoonbills, African darters, cormorants. It may also form single-species groups on offshore islands or abandoned buildings. Island nests are often made on the ground. Large colonies consist of numerous subcolonies and can number 1000 birds.

Females lay one to five eggs per season, incubated by both parents for 21 to 29 days. After hatching, one parent continuously stays at the nest for the first seven days. Chicks fledge after 35 to 40 days and are independent after 44 to 48 days, reaching sexual maturity one to five years after hatching.

== Conservation ==
The African sacred ibis is classified as &quot;Least Concern&quot; by the IUCN. The global population is estimated at 200,000–450,000 individuals but appears to be decreasing. It is covered by the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA).

== In myth and legend ==

For many centuries, sacred ibis, along with two other species in lesser numbers, were commonly mummified by the Ancient Egyptians as a votive offering to the god Thoth. Thoth, whose head is that of an ibis, is the Ancient Egyptian god of wisdom and reason, and thus of truth, knowledge, learning and study, and writing and mathematics. The sacred ibis was considered the living incarnation of Thoth on earth. Pilgrims from all over Egypt brought thousands of ibis offerings to four or more main temples, which at their peak mummified and buried thousands of birds a year in gigantic and ancient catacombs (one complex was in operation for 700 years). Eventually, an estimated eight million birds were mummified and entombed by the Ancient Egyptians.

It has long been thought, to sustain sufficient numbers for the large and sometimes growing demand for sacrifices by the people, dozens of ibis breeding farms (called &quot;ibiotropheia&quot; by Herodotus) were established, initially throughout the regions of Egypt, but later centralised around the main temples, each producing around a thousand birds for mummies annually. An examination of the mitochondrial DNA disputes this and suggests that not only were wild birds caught and added to the captive flocks, but that they provided the bulk of the supply. The mummified birds were often young and were usually killed by breaking their neck. The head and bill were often placed between the tail feathers, and a piece of food was often placed in the bill (often a snail). The particulars of the mummification ritual often differed. The mummies could be stored in ceramic jars, wooden chests or stone sarcophagi. Not all mummies contain whole birds; some (cheaper ones) contain only a leg, an eggshell, or even dried grass from the nest. Birds were given different burials according to their status; as pets, offerings or holy individuals. Special sacred birds were afforded special mummification, transported from their cities to the temples long after normal offerings were sourced from temple farm flocks, and honoured with more luxurious burial. Different regions in Egypt observed slightly different practises regarding the ritual beliefs.

Ibis mummification started by at least 1,100 BC and petered out by approximately 30 BC. Although the numbers of burials peaked at different times depending on the region and temple, the rituals were most popular from the Late Period to the Ptolemaic Period.

Mummified specimens of the sacred ibis were brought back to Europe by Napoleon&#x27;s army, where they became part of an early debate about evolution.

According to Herodotus and Pliny the Elder the ibis was invoked against incursions of winged serpents. Herodotus wrote:

Josephus tells us that when Moses led the Hebrews to make war upon the Æthiopians, he brought a great number of the birds in cages of papyrus to oppose any serpents.

Due to perhaps a mistranslation of the Greek of Herodotus, before the early 18th century Europeans were convinced that these ibises had human feet.

Pliny the Elder tells us that it was said that the flies that brought pestilence died immediately upon propitiatory sacrifices of this bird.

According to Claudius Aelianus in &quot;De Natura Animalium&quot;, and Gaius Julius Solinus, both quoting much earlier but now lost authors, the sacred ibis procreates with its bill, and thus the bird is always a virgin. Aristotle, writing some 500 years earlier, also mentions this theory, but repudiates it. Picrius mentions how the venomous basilisk is hatched from the eggs of ibis, nurtured from the poisons of all the serpents the birds devour. These authors and many others also mention how crocodiles and snakes are rendered motionless after being touched by the feather of an ibis. Claudius Aelianus also says the ibis is consecrated to the moon.

Pliny and Galen ascribe the invention of the clyster (enema) to the ibis, as according to them it gave such treatments to hippopotami. Plutarch assures us it uses only salt water for this purpose. 1600 years later this was still accepted science, as Claude Perrault, in his anatomical descriptions of the bird, claimed to have found a hole in the bill which the bird used for that purpose.

In the century before the time of Christ and for at least a century after, the worship of Isis had become quite popular in Rome, especially among women, and the ibis had become one of her associated symbols. A number of frescoes and mosaics in the patrician villas of Pompeii and Herculaneum of 50BC-79AD show these birds.
According to some translations of the septuagint, the ibis is one of the unclean birds which may not be eaten (, ).

<text>Lake Tarawera is the largest of a series of lakes which surround the volcano Mount Tarawera in the North Island of New Zealand. Like the mountain, it lies within the Ōkataina Caldera. It is located to the east of Rotorua, and beneath the peaks of the Tarawera massif i.e. Wahanga, Ruawahia, Tarawera and Koa. Tarawera means &quot;Burnt Spear&quot;, named by a visiting hunter who left his bird spears in a hut and on returning the following season found that both his spears and hut had been turned to ashes.

== Geography ==
Lake Tarawera is above sea level, and has a surface area of . To the north-west is Lake Ōkataina, to the west as you go south, lakes Ōkāreka, Tikitapu and Rotokākahi and to the south-east Lake Rotomahana. Lake Tarawera township is on the western shore, between Lake Tarawera and Lake Ōkāreka. The main road access is from Rotorua to the west.

The lake was substantially affected by the eruption of Mount Tarawera on 10 June 1886 to the lake&#x27;s east. There were changes in lake level and sediment carriage.

The lake has a large catchment. This includes Lake Tarawera&#x27;s immediate catchment, being in area, and the catchment of the nearby higher lakes, being a total of , with an estimated mean annual precipitation of .

=== Water Flow ===

Lake Tarawera is filled primarily by water flowing through the volcanic rocks and ashes, only about 42% being from water flowing in streams, etc. The mean surface inflows are estimated to be:

Thus surface water inflows contribute which is less than the rainfall on the lake surface itself and much less than either the estimated total outflow from the lake approaching . Therefore there is a fair subsurface inflow into the lake.

|- align=&quot;center&quot;

An estimate has been made of total inflows both surface and subsurface from the surrounding lake catchments

The main hot water sources are in the southern section of the lake at the Wairua Stream, Hot Water Beach and Te Puha and Tarawera fumaroles. There is also a small geothermal area at Humphrey&#x27;s Bay, to the south of Lake Ōkataina. Water varies between and .
Lake Tarawera&#x27;s outflow at its north east end, has been heavily influenced by the local geology, with a mean discharged on the surface into the Tarawera River, which flows north-east into the Bay of Plenty. An estimate of subsurface outflow has been made by measuring flow below Tarawera Falls where total river flow has increased to .

=== Geology ===
Lake Tarawera has been modified by eruptions within the Ōkataina Caldera, most recently the 1314 ± 12 CE Kaharoa eruption and the 10 June 1886 eruption. Its current outlet control is where Tapahoro lava flows created by the 5526 ± 145 BP Whakatane eruption run into a 14,009 ± 155 BP Pokohu lava flow which the Tarawera River flows across in a wide channel. Before the Whakatane eruption it is thought the lake had a lower level than at present. Immediately after the Whakatane eruption its level increased by at least with gradual cutting down and Taupō Rift subsidence to a level just before the 1314 Kaharoa eruption of above present lake levels. The 1314 eruption blocked the outlet in a temporary dam to a temporary lake height of above present lake levels, which was subsequently eroded with a great flood at one stage, to reach by the time of European settlement first surveys below present lake level.

The lake outlet was blocked for two decades after the 1886 eruption and the lake level increased to a maximum of above its present level. The eruption killed over 120 people, and buried the Māori village of Te Wairoa on the southwest shore of the lake. The last major decrease in lake level occurred in a flood of 1904 down the Tarawera River valley after the new volcanic material dam first broke on 1 November 1904. The main flood surge on 3 November 1904 was assessed at a peak flow of . After 1906 it is now known that the main change in lake level relative to reference sea level would have been due to the slow subsidence of this area of the Taupō Rift. This rate can be estimated to have been about in 100 years from the nearest NZ Geonet station RGTA data which has been operative since November 2007 and shows a linear trend in height decrease since then.

Also assumed destroyed were the nearly famed Pink and White Terraces which were located to the south of the lake and accessed via boat across the lake and the old Lake Rotomahana. However, in February 2011 a team mapping the lake floor discovered what appeared to be part of the Pink Terraces. The lowest two tiers of the terraces were reportedly found in their original place at deep (too deep for scuba diving without special gas gear). Subsequently, a portion of the White Terraces was reportedly rediscovered in June 2011. The announcement of the rediscovery of the White Terraces coincided with the 125th anniversary of the eruption of Mt. Tarawera in 1886. It was thought that the rest of the terraces may be buried in sediment rather than having been destroyed. More recent research question these earlier findings and reports the Pink and White terrace spring sites instead lie on land (along with a lesser-known Black Terrace spring). As of 2023 no sample of any terrace has been recovered, so any claim of survival of any of the terrace formations is unproven.

== Ecology ==

Lake Tarawera is classified as mesotrophic, with a trophic level index of 3.0 in 2014 which was a decline.

The native bush has regenerated since the 1886 eruption.

== Recreational ==
Lake Tarawera is home to eels and rainbow trout. During the summer it is popular for both fishing and water sports, and also camping as there a number of hot water beaches. Much of the more inaccessible lake shore is part of the Lake Tarawera Scenic Reserve with hunting permits possible. There are multiple popular walking trails with access to thermal features and rock paintings, often without a permit.

== Lake Tarawera township ==
The township on the shores of Lake Tarawera is described by Statistics New Zealand as a rural settlement, and covers . It had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2. Lake Tarawere township is part of the larger Kaingaroa-Whakarewarewa statistical area.
The township had a population of 267 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 60 people (29.0%) since the 2013 census, and a decrease of 3 people (−1.1%) since the 2006 census. There were 132 households, comprising 132 males and 135 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.98 males per female, with 30 people (11.2%) aged under 15 years, 33 (12.4%) aged 15 to 29, 126 (47.2%) aged 30 to 64, and 78 (29.2%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 91.0% European/Pākehā, 11.2% Māori, 2.2% Pacific peoples, 4.5% Asian, and 2.2% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 59.6% had no religion, 32.6% were Christian and 1.1% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 69 (29.1%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 27 (11.4%) people had no formal qualifications. 66 people (27.8%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 114 (48.1%) people were employed full-time, 42 (17.7%) were part-time, and 3 (1.3%) were unemployed.

<text>Hawkeye Point is the highest natural point in Iowa at . It is approximately north of Sibley on the eastern side of SR 60 and approximately south of the Iowa-Minnesota state border. The high ground lies due south of an old silo.

The land that includes the highpoint was donated by the Sterler family, who worked this land for many decades, to Osceola County with the stipulation that the land be turned into a park. Osceola County, through its Economic Development Commission and Hawkeye Point Committee, has removed a few structures that were deemed to be hazardous to public safety including the old hog feed bunker at the highpoint site and a few small barns. They have erected an informational kiosk which highlights the family and the county and features a display of license plates from the 50 states sent in over the years to the Sterlers.

The county purchased approximately of surrounding land including the old family farm house, which is being used as office space for the county. There are a flagpole, picnic bench, tile mosaic, several granite markers, and five tall posts with signs pointing to the other 49 state highpoints, each with the correct distance noted. The local 4-H group and high school youths contributed a great deal to this effort. The Hawkeye Point Commission also recently purchased a wooded plot of land of about on the north side of the county road abutting the property with the intent to turn it into a campground.

The Highpointers Foundation, a non-profit charity set up to benefit privately owned state highpoints, has provided much of the funding for the renovations at Hawkeye Point.

<doc id="1164469" wikidata="Q7934224" url="?curid=1164469" title="Virginia Dale, Colorado">
<text>Virginia Dale is a tiny unincorporated community located in northwestern Larimer County, Colorado, United States. Virginia Dale is situated in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains on U.S. Highway 287, approximately 45 mi (72 km) northwest of Ft. Collins and approximately 4 mi (6 km) south of the Wyoming border. In the late 19th century, Virginia Dale was a famous stop on the Overland Trail. The stage station, the last of its kind still standing, and its associated home, the Hurzeler House, are owned and maintained by the Virginia Dale Community Club.

==Overland Trail stage station==
The Virginia Dale stage station was established in 1862 by Jack Slade, former station manager at Julesburg, Colorado where he famously got into a dispute with Jules Beni. Beni had previously shot Slade five times but Slade survived and exacted his revenge by ambushing Beni, tying him to a fencepost and shooting off his fingers before delivering a coup de grace to the head. Slade kept Beni&#x27;s ears as trophies. While station master in Julesburg, Slade met and breakfasted with Samuel Clemens, &quot;Mark Twain&quot; and made quite an impression upon Twain. Twain wrote about his encounter with Slade in his 1872 publication &quot;Roughing It&quot;.

When Ben Holladay took over the Overland Stage in 1862, he changed the route, taking it south from Julesberg along the South Platte River to Greeley and then up the old Cherokee Trail through Latham, LaPorte, Virginia Dale, Colorado, and into Wyoming.

Virginia Dale was a &quot;home station&quot; on the Overland Trail, meaning that passengers could disembark, get a meal, and stay overnight in a hotel if the stage was delayed by weather or nightfall. Thirty to fifty horses were kept at the station which was located in a pleasant, grassy glade (or &quot;dale&quot;) along a clear bubbling stream, later named Dale Creek. Slade probably named the post after his wife Virginia, whose maiden name might have been &quot;Dale&quot;. Slade was an excellent stage manager as long as he stayed sober. Many stories credit him with outrageous actions from shooting up a saloon in LaPorte for serving his stage drivers whiskey, or for having &quot;a fondness of shooting canned goods off grocery store shelves&quot; to robbing the stage of $60,000 in gold, which later disappeared. Slade was fired as stage manager in November, 1862 after a drunken shooting spree at nearby Fort Halleck and left with his wife for Virginia City, Montana where he was hanged in early 1864 by angry miners.

The Virginia Dale stage station hosted many famous travelers such as author Albert D. Richardson (&quot;Beyond the Mississippi&quot;) and an Illinois governor, probably Richard Yates. Samuel Bowles, editor of the Massachusetts &quot;Republican&quot; wrote in 1865, 

&quot;Virginia Dale deserves its pretty name. A pearly, lively-looking stream runs through a beautiful basin of perhaps one hundred acres, among the mountains - for we are within the entrances of one of the great hills-stretching away in smooth and rising pasture to nooks and crannies of the wooded range; fronted by rock embankment, and flanked by the snowy peaks themselves; warm with the June sun, and rare with an air into which no fetid breath has poured itself-it is difficult to imagine a loveable spot in Nature&#x27;s kingdom.&quot; 

The station itself was built with timber cut by Hiram &#x27;Hi&quot; Kelly, one of the first profitable cattle ranchers in the Laramie area.

In 1865 future Vice President Schuyler Colfax (then Speaker of the US House of Representatives) was detained at the post by Native American raids. It is possible that Virginia Dale served briefly as a telegraph station.

==Settlement==
After the construction of the Union Pacific Railroad in 1867, the stage stop was abandoned. Settlers began moving into the area in 1872, establishing the first school in 1874. The first church was built in 1880. The community was formerly the site of a post office and cafe along Highway 287 until the 1990s, when the cafe and post office were shut down. The area continues to be a region of cattle ranching. The original 1874 school still stands along U.S. Highway 287 and the original stage station still stands a short distance east of the highway. The U.S. Post Office at Livermore (ZIP Code 80536) now serves Virginia Dale postal addresses.

== Historical marker ==

The settlement is memorialized by a bronze plaque just off U.S. 287 on the easterly side (about a mile north of the school and a few hundred yards north of the abandoned post office). The plaque reads as follows:
: THIS MEMORIAL IS THE PROPERTY OF THE STATE OF COLORADO.
: THREE-QUARTERS OF A MILE NORTHWEST FROM THIS POINT IS THE ORIGINAL VIRGINIA DALE. FAMOUS STAGE STATION ON THE OVERLAND ROUTE TO CALIFORNIA, 1862-1867. ESTABLISHED BY JOSEPH A. (JACK) SLADE AND NAMED FOR HIS WIFE, VIRGINIA. LOCATED ON THE CHEROKEE TRAIL OF 1849. FAVORITE CAMP GROUND FOR EMIGRANTS. VICE PRESIDENT COLFAX AND PARTY WERE DETAINED HERE BY INDIAN RAIDS IN 1865. ROBERT J. SPOTSWOOD REPLACED SLADE.
: ERECTED BY THE STATE HISTORICAL SOCIETY OF COLORADO FROM THE MRS. J. N. HALL FOUNDATION AND BY THE FORT COLLINS PIONEER SOCIETY, 1935.

==Climate==

According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Virginia Dale has a warm-summer humid continental climate, abbreviated &quot;Dfb&quot; on climate maps. The hottest temperature recorded in Virginia Dale was on June 29, 2018, July 19, 2022, and July 21, 2022, while the coldest temperature recorded was on February 5, 2014.

<doc id="1164471" wikidata="Q7130833" url="?curid=1164471" title="Panel truck">
<text>A panel truck (also called a panel delivery or pickup truck-based van) in U.S. and Canadian usage is a small delivery truck with a fully enclosed body. It typically is high and has no rear windows in the rear cargo area. The term was first used in the early 1910s. Panel trucks were marketed for contracting, deliveries, and other businesses. Often described as a small van (based on the chassis of a truck or pickup truck) used mostly for delivery rounds, the British equivalent is a &quot;delivery van.&quot;

==History==
Consumer demand from farmers and businesses for stripped-down Model T versions prompted Henry Ford to market vehicles that independent builders could supply cabs and cargo enclosures according to users&#x27; needs.

During World War I the U.S. Army ordered 20,000 Dodge half-ton chassis sets for use as cargo trucks and ambulances that were then marketed after the war as the &quot;Screenside Commercial Car&quot;—a pickup with a roof and roll-up side covers or a fully enclosed cargo-bed.

Chevrolet made a van-like version of their Chevrolet Suburban, which was a station wagon version of the Chevrolet pickup truck from the 1930s. Panel truck versions of the Suburban were made until 1973.

Ford made panel truck versions of their pickup trucks until 1960. Panel trucks were also converted into canopy expresses, which were primarily used by farmers.

The style of the panel trucks from the 1930s to 1950s inspired the style of both the Chrysler PT Cruiser and the Chevrolet HHR. However, both of these were car platform-based models (Chrysler PL and GM Delta platforms respectively), not built on a pickup truck chassis.

The current use of panel trucks describes commercial delivery vans.

==Difference==
The difference between a sedan delivery and a panel truck is that the sedan delivery is based on the chassis of a sedan, hatchback, or station wagon, while a panel truck is based on the chassis of a pickup truck. Unibody-based vans are similar in size and in functionality but have a unibody chassis.

==Canopy express==
A canopy express (also known as a &quot;huckster truck&quot;) is a light-duty cargo van based on the chassis of a panel truck. Canopy express vehicles have open display areas behind the driver&#x27;s seat commonly used for peddling vegetables and fruit, but also used for other kinds of deliveries that require easy access, such as newspapers and radio equipment.

Canopy express trucks evolved as a more stylized version of standard pickup trucks that contained open canopies installed over the pickup bed. They were built by Dodge, General Motors, and International Harvester as well as other manufacturers. Ford Canopy Express trucks were merely aftermarket conversions of their existing panel trucks.

As the United States became more suburbanized after World War II, sales of canopy express vehicles declined. Dodge ceased production of these trucks in 1948, while GM offered the last of them in 1955.

<doc id="1164473" wikidata="Q473357" url="?curid=1164473" title="Royal Society Range">
<text>The Royal Society Range () is a majestic range of mountains in Victoria Land, Antarctica, rising to along the west shore of McMurdo Sound between the Koettlitz, Skelton and Ferrar Glaciers.
They are south of the Kukri Hills, southeast of the Quartermain Mountains, and northeast of the Worcester Range.

With its summit at , the massive Mount Lister forms the highest point in this range. Mount Lister is located along the western shore of McMurdo Sound between the Koettlitz, Skelton and Ferrar glaciers. Other notable local terrain features include Allison Glacier, which descends from the west slopes of the Royal Society Range into Skelton Glacier.

==Discovery and naming==
The range was probably first seen by Captain James Clark Ross in 1841.
It was explored by the British National Antarctic Expedition (BrNAE; 1901–04) under Robert Falcon Scott, who named the range after the Royal Society and applied names of its members to many of its peaks.
For example, Mount Lister was named for Lord Joseph Lister, President of the Royal Society, 1895–1900.
The Royal Society provided financial support to BrNAE and its members had assisted on the committee which organized the expedition.

==Geology==

The Royal Society Range consists of a Precambrian igneous and meta-igneous basement complex overlain by Devonian- to Triassic-age sandstones, siltstones and conglomerates of the Beacon Supergroup which dip shallowly westward away from the Ross Sea coast.
The entire region is cut by north–south trending longitudinal faults, east–west trending transverse faults, and structurally related dike swarms.

Tectonic and fluvial activity have featured very heavily in the recent geologic history of the Royal Society Range. 
Following the extension of the Ross Sea Basin (c. 55 million years ago), an episode of uplift drove the creation of the Royal Society Range rift flank. At this time a tectonic (though &quot;not&quot; accretionary) wedge, up to 6 km thick on the coast, was present, though it quickly began to erode due primarily to fluvial processes, and the Royal Society Range was cut down near to its present appearance by the mid-Miocene. Relatively limited glacial action since that time has preserved much of the fluvial architecture of the Range, and though uplift did not cease, its magnitude is such that it has not drastically affected the landscape, having progressed only 67 meters in the last 8 million years.

===Koettlitz Glacier Alkaline Province===
Neoproterozoic tectonic extension along the edge of the East Antarctic Craton between the Skelton and Koettlitz Glaciers resulted in the emplacement of coarse grained alkaline igneous intrusive rocks (ranging from gabbro to A-type granite). This area of alkaline intrusives is referred to as the Koettlitz Glacier Alkaline Province.

===Ross Orogeny===

Cambrian tectonic convergence, continental collision and plate subduction led to the emplacement of calc-alkaline and adakitic granitoids. This period of mountain building is referred to as the Ross Orogeny.

===Volcanic history===
The Royal Society Range contains over 50 basaltic vents, ranging in size from tiny mounds to cinder cones up to 300 meters (985 feet) high. Dating of surface material indicates they were active earlier than 15 million years ago (e.g. Heald Island) and as recently as 80,000 years ago, with glacier-bound tephra layers suggesting even more recent Holocene activity.
The vast majority of vents are located in the foothills of the Royal Society mountains just north of Koettlitz Glacier, and most are Quaternary in age. Most emanating flows are 3–10 meters thick and less than 4 kilometers long. The composition, with very few exceptions, is porphyritic basanite with primarily olivine and clinopyroxene phenocrysts, though some phenocrystic plagioclase is also present.

==Location==

The Royal Society range borders the Bowers Piedmont Glacier and the Blue Glacier to the east. 
The Blue Glacier separates the range from the Denton Hills, which run from north to south along the coast of McMurdo Sound in the northeast, and along the northwest side of the Koettlitz Glacier further south.
The Pyramid, the southeast tip of the range, is on the north side of the Koettlitz Glacier.
The southwest and west of the range lies to the east of the Skelton Glacier, which rises in the Skelton Névé to the west of the range and flows south into the Ross Ice Shelf.
The northwest of the range lies to the east and south of the Ferrar Glacier, which flows east along the north of the range to New Harbour in McMurdo Sound. 

==Glaciers==
The surrounding glaciers are:
* Blue Glacier, a large glacier which flows into Bowers Piedmont Glacier about south of New Harbour.
* Koettlitz Glacier, a large glacier lying west of Mount Morning and Mount Discovery in the Royal Society Range, flowing from the vicinity of Mount Cocks northeastward between Brown Peninsula and the mainland into the ice shelf of McMurdo Sound.
* Skelton Glacier, a large glacier flowing from the Antarctic Plateau into the Ross Ice Shelf at Skelton Inlet on the Hillary Coast.
* Ferrar Glacier, a glacier about long, flowing from the plateau of Victoria Land west of the Royal Society Range to New Harbour in McMurdo Sound.

==Features==

Major features include:
* Colwell Massif (), a rugged rock massif, about long, rising to between Palais Glacier, Ferrar Glacier, and Rotunda Glacier.
* Table Mountain (), a large flat mountain rising to over immediately south of the junction of the Emmanuel Glacier and Ferrar Glacier in Victoria Land.
* Cathedral Rocks (), a series of four abrupt cliffs interspersed by short glaciers and surmounted by sharp peaks. The cliffs extend for along the south side of Ferrar Glacier and form part of the north shoulder of the Royal Society Range.
* Briggs Hill (), a conspicuous ice-free hill, high, standing on the south side of Ferrar Glacier between Descent Glacier and Overflow Glacier.
* Bettle Peak (), a peak, high, standing west of Bowers Piedmont Glacier and north of the Granite Knolls.
* Rampart Ridge (), a prominent broken ridge on the west side of the Royal Society Range. It stands north of Rutgers Glacier and extends from The Spire to Bishop Peak.
* Mount Lister (), a massive mountain, high, forming the highest point in the Royal Society Range.
* Mount Rücker&#x27; (), a mountain, high, immediately south of Johns Hopkins Ridge.
* Radian Ridge (), a ridge extending east from the scarp of the Royal Society Range, along the south side of Radian Glacier.
* Mount Dromedary (), a hump-shaped mountain, over high, standing east of Mount Kempe.
* Mount Schwerdtfeger (), a peak, high on the ridge at the head of Renegar Glacier, south of Mount Kempe.
* Harvey Summit (), a peak high at the head of McDermott Glacier.

<text>Virginia Dale (born Virginia Paxton; – October 3, 1994) was an American actress and dancer.

==Biography==
Dale was born in North Carolina. She was the daughter of Lula Helms Paxton, and she graduated from Central High School in Charlotte. 

Dale began learning toe dancing when she was 9 years old. When she was an adult, she recalled, &quot;I slaved and slaved at it, hating every minute. I tried everything I could think of to get out of it.&quot; That exit occurred when blood poisoning in one of her feet required grafting lamb&#x27;s skin over the top of the foot. The resulting reduction in the foot&#x27;s ability to stretch ended her toe dancing. 

When Dale was a teenager, Earl Carroll selected her as the winner of a beauty contest in Charlotte. That introduction to Carroll helped Dale and her sister, Frances, who danced as a team, to perform in New York City. Their engagements there included an eight-month stint at the Hollywood Restaurant. They also performed in other cities in the eastern United States. While they were in New York City, Dale was discovered by Darryl F. Zanuck who signed her to a contract with 20th Century Fox.

She appeared in a number of movies in the late 1930s and 1940s, including &quot;Holiday Inn&quot; (1942), in which she dances and sings with Fred Astaire and Bing Crosby, and she became particularly associated with musicals. In the 1950s, she worked mainly in television series such as &quot;The Adventures of Kit Carson&quot; (1951–1952), &quot;Highway Patrol&quot; (1957), and &quot;The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp&quot; (1957–1958). She left the movie business in 1958, but returned to acting for a few films in the 1980s.

On Broadway, Dale performed in &quot;Him&quot; (1928) and &quot;The Final Balance&quot; (1928).

==Death==
Dale died of complications of emphysema on October 3, 1994, in Burbank, California, aged 77.

<doc id="1164475" wikidata="Q2277455" url="?curid=1164475" title="Shaw (Washington, D.C.)">
<text>Shaw is a neighborhood of Washington, D.C., located in the Northwest quadrant. Shaw is a major entertainment and retail hub, and much of the neighborhood is designated as a historic district, including the smaller Blagden Alley-Naylor Court Historic District. Shaw and the U Street Corridor have historically have been the city&#x27;s hub for African-American social, cultural, and economic life. 

==History==

Shaw emerged from freed slave encampments in the rural outskirts of Washington, D.C. It was originally called &quot;Uptown&quot;, in an era when the city&#x27;s boundary ended at &quot;Boundary Street&quot; (now Florida Avenue).

The neighborhood thrived in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as the pre-Harlem, national center of U.S. black intellectual and cultural life. During this time, President Andrew Johnson signed Howard University&#x27;s founding charter. Furthermore, in 1925, Professor Alain LeRoy Locke advanced the idea of &quot;The New Negro&quot; while Langston Hughes descended from LeDroit Park to hear the &quot;sad songs&quot; of 7th Street. Another famous Shaw native to emerge from this period—sometimes called the Harlem Renaissance—was Duke Ellington. Carter G. Woodson, an important historian of African American culture and society, lived in the neighborhood during the prime of his career and life in early- to mid-1900s.

Following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. on April 4, 1968, riots erupted in many D.C. neighborhoods, including Shaw, Columbia Heights, and the H Street, NE corridor. The 1968 Washington, D.C., riots marked the beginning of a decline in population and development that condemned much of the inner city to a generation of economic decay. After the riots, Shaw was left without electricity and with burnt down buildings. Crime and fear increased. Succeeding the riots, Shaw civic leaders Walter Fauntroy and Watha T. Daniel led grassroots community renewal projects with the Model Inner City Community Organization (MICCO). MICCO used federal grant money to employ African American architects, engineers, and urban planners in inner-city Washington, D.C.

Shaw is a residential neighborhood dominated by 19th-century Victorian row houses. The architecture of these houses, Shaw&#x27;s central location, and the stability of D.C.&#x27;s housing market have transformed the neighborhood through gentrification. Gentrification beginning in the late 1970s and early 1980s generated new discussions between the inhabitants of the Shaw neighborhood and the Dupont Circle Conservancy organization. Preservation advocates in the Dupont Circle neighborhood began to propose the expansion of the neighborhood. The advocates were members of the Dupont Circle Conservancy, an organization predominantly led by European-American people. As a response to this proposal, the 14th and U Street Coalition, which called itself the representative of black interests and historical identity in neighboring Shaw, began protesting that the Dupont Circle preservationists were trying to occupy their neighborhood and its history.

Until the 1960s, what is now Shaw was called Midcity. In 1966, planners used the enrollment boundary of Shaw Junior High School to define the &quot;Shaw School Urban Renewal Area&quot; covering what are now the Shaw, U Street Corridor and Logan Circle neighborhoods. The school had been named after Robert Gould Shaw, who led the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment, one of the first official African American units during the American Civil War.

As the area diversified starting in the 1990s, neighborhoods in the north, west and east of what was considered Shaw during the urban renewal era became more frequently referred to by specific names and were no longer referred to as part of Shaw, such as the U Street Corridor (a.k.a. Cardozo/Shaw), Logan Circle, Truxton Circle, and Randolph Square; for the remaining area (7th/9th street corridor north from Convention Center to U Street), &quot;Shaw&quot; remains the unique, unequivocal name.

Gentrification in the 2010s transformed the neighborhood into an upscale retail hub. But the mix of upscale newcomers with very poor, long-time residents has been linked to differences in tastes, preferences, and values. Gentrification has also brought about a greater spectrum of political views in Shaw. Because the population has become more diversified, an influx of differing views, ideas, and outlooks has become more prominent.

==Geography==

The most generally used definition of Shaw, without Logan Circle and the U Street Corridor, is bounded by:
* Florida Avenue NW and the U Street Corridor, Ledroit Park and Howard University on the north,
* M Street NW and Massachusetts Avenue NW, and Mount Vernon Square and Downtown Washington, D.C., on the south,
* First St. NW and Truxton Circle on the east, and 
* 12th Street NW and the U Street and Logan Circle neighborhoods to the west.

Shaw consists of gridded streets lined mainly with small Victorian row houses, but also north of the convention center by urban-renewal-era low-rise apartment complexes and the late 2010s mixed-use development City Market at O. The original commercial hub of the area prior to the redevelopment in the wake of the 1968 riots and Green Line Metrorail construction was along 7th and 9th streets NW, and especially 7th street is still lined by small businesses housed in rowhouse-sized buildings. Tucked away into the alleys here are former light industrial buildings that now constitute the Blagden Alley-Naylor Court Historic District, home to restaurants, cafés and other small businesses. The Shaw Main Streets association is centered along 7th and 9th Streets between K and W streets.

==Culture==

Shaw&#x27;s neighborhood offers different cultural landmarks consisting of:
* Howard Theatre, owned by Abe Lichtman, a white owner of theaters that catered to African Americans, it was billed the &quot;largest color theater in the World&quot; in the 1970s. After restoration, it still hosts artists and performers in today&#x27;s entertainment industry.
* Dunbar Theater, currently known as the Southern Aid Society, holds nearly 350 seats and was a popular venue for live entertainment, including many jazz and blues artists as well as movies. Originally opening in the 1920s, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1968, shortly after closing in 1960.
* CityMarket at O (named &quot;O Street Market&quot; until 2008) is a Gothic Revival historic landmark, being one of the three public market buildings from the 19th century in DC; it won several awards for its design.
* The Shiloh Baptist Church, originally located in Fredericksburg (VA), plays an active part in helping, spiritually and economically, the Shaw&#x27;s community. President Barack Obama and his family attended its Easter Sunday mass in 2011.
* The Watha T. Daniel/Shaw Neighborhood Library is a three-level library of which design was renovated in 2010 and received several awards for its excellence; it was also named as one of the top buildings of 2010 by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;.
* The Walter E. Washington Convention Center, whose north portion is located in Shaw, has 703,000 square feet of exhibition space. It has hosted several official events including some hosted by President Barack Obama. It is also famous for its eco-friendly features. From 2017 to 2024, the WEWCC will be hosting Otakon.

=== Little Ethiopia ===
Little Ethiopia is a sub-division of the Shaw neighborhood of Washington, D.C., located around 9th and U Street Northwest. It is known for its concentration of Ethiopian businesses and residents.

Since the 1980s, Ethiopian-born business owners have been purchasing property in the neighborhood of Shaw, specifically Thirteenth and Ninth Streets. The area has since gained distinctive popularity in Washington even outside of the Ethiopian community. According to restaurant owner Tefera Zewdie: &quot;I remember it was if I&#x27;m not mistaken somewhere between 2000, 2001 it was something big for us to see one non-Ethiopian coming to the restaurant. Now 95 percent of them are non-Ethiopian.&quot; The food has become a main attraction and reason for locals and tourists to commute to Shaw and experience the many local Ethiopian restaurants. The influx of Ethiopians revitalized the area, prompting members of the Ethiopian American community to lobby the city government to officially designate the block as &quot;Little Ethiopia&quot;. A DC Council Resolution officially recognizing the Ethiopian community in the area was passed in 2021.

==Demographics==
Shaw has grown dramatically since the mid-to-late 20th century, with a 2010 population of 17,639. In 1950, the area&#x27;s population had reached over 34,000 people, around double its current level. Like many neighborhoods throughout Washington, D.C., Shaw hit a population low point in the 1980s and 1990s, rebounding considerably at the turn of the 21st century. The lack of investment and limited power in the area created a barrier in the neighborhood&#x27;s development and urbanization during the early 1800s. Further growth was hindered by increasing racial tensions as more African-Americans settled in the region; by the 1850s, Washington, D.C., had the largest African-American population of any city in the United States. The increasing costs of housing also decreased the availability of affordable housing, generating further racial tensions citywide and neighborhood segregation. Although Shaw continues to be populated by many African-Americans, the price of housing experienced steady growth in the 2010s and early 2020s, which could lead to further displacement among the black community and a phenomenon known as root shock. According to the latest census of the Logan Circle/Shaw area, the majority of residents are single (71%) and college-educated (67%), with a median income of $84,875.

The majority of residents in Shaw are between the ages of 22 and 39; they constitute 44.5% of the population. This is greater than the average District of Columbia percentage of 34.5% for this age group. Children between the ages of 0 and 17 make up 15.4% of the population. The proportion of genders within each age group is generally equal except for the 85+ age group (which is 94.4% female and 5.6% male), and the 20-year-old group (which is 84.9% female and 15.1% male).

<text>CIVT-DT (channel 32) is a television station in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, serving as the West Coast flagship of the CTV Television Network. It is owned and operated by network parent Bell Media alongside Victoria-based CTV 2 station CIVI-DT (channel 53). CIVT-DT&#x27;s studios are located at 969 Robson Street (alternatively known as 750 Burrard Street, the former site of the Vancouver Public Library&#x27;s central branch) at the intersection of Robson Street and Burrard Street in downtown Vancouver, which also houses the British Columbia operations of the CTV network itself, including the &quot;CTV National News&quot; Vancouver bureau. The station&#x27;s transmitter is located atop Mount Seymour in the district municipality of North Vancouver.

CIVT went on the air in 1997 as the first new Vancouver TV station in 21 years after the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission selected the application of Baton Broadcasting from among five bids. Originally known as Vancouver Television (VTV), the station was a young-skewing outlet intended to reflect an increasingly multicultural Vancouver and stimulate television production in British Columbia. In addition to local news and arts programming, CIVT produced programs seen nationally, including a talk show hosted by Vicki Gabereau and the police procedural drama &quot;Cold Squad&quot;.

Concurrently with the launch of CIVT, Baton Broadcasting acquired the CTV network. This purchase, plus an ownership change at longtime CTV affiliate CHAN-TV that saw it become owned by the Global Television Network, led to a major television realignment in 2001 under which CIVT became the new CTV station for the province and the only CTV affiliate on Canada&#x27;s west coast. In switching to CTV, the station moved toward attracting an older audience. It also improved its news ratings, generally becoming the second-rated station for local news after CHAN.

==History==
===Licensing===
By the mid-1990s, nearly two decades had passed since Vancouver had last received a new television station—CKVU-TV in 1976. A 1977 CRTC study found that, under its projections, Vancouver would need seven additional TV stations by 2001, including three new English-language commercial outlets as well as a multilingual station focused on ethnic communities in the region. While population growth had largely followed the CRTC&#x27;s projections from that time, the growth in the television station industry had not. The three existing major stations in Vancouver—CBC station CBUT-TV, CHAN-TV (known as BCTV), and CKVU-TV—were coming under increasing scrutiny as being not adequately reflective of an increasingly diverse community. In a July 1996 column, Robert Mason Lee of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; noted that BCTV had the &quot;dangerous arrogance of a local-news gorilla&quot;, called CBUT&#x27;s news product &quot;wholesome&quot; but noted that the local CBC station &quot;has neither the money nor the authority to produce local television&quot;, and labeled CKVU as &quot;deplorable&quot;, &quot;paving the road to hell&quot;, and &quot;cheap and undeserving of Vancouver&quot;. There was also a decided sentiment in the growing British Columbia film and television production community that there were no decision-making entities in Vancouver. Producers in British Columbia derided the &quot;$1,500 cup of coffee&quot;—the meetings, complete with airfare, that Vancouver creatives had to make with Toronto leaders to get approval for their proposals.

The process that led to the launch of CIVT began when Rogers Communications and CanWest Global Communications filed separate applications with the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) in August 1995 and January 1996, respectively, to launch new television stations in the Vancouver–Victoria market. In line with the commission&#x27;s usual practice, the CRTC issued a general call for applications in March 1996, with a public hearing that September. In all, five applications were considered:
* Rogers proposed a multicultural station on channel 32—similar to its CFMT-TV in Toronto—to be known as &quot;CFMV&quot; and to replace an existing regional specialty channel, Talentvision. Sixty percent of the programs on CFMV would be in Asian languages. However, several Korean Canadians protested the Rogers bid because, in converting from a specialty channel to a broadcast service, Rogers proposed to cut Korean output from 14 hours a week to just 30 minutes.
* CanWest, then-owner of what is now the Global Television Network, proposed a new station in Victoria, in parallel to its existing Vancouver station CKVU-TV (channel 10). It believed this would make the company more competitive against the market&#x27;s existing twinstick of CHAN-TV (channel 8) and CHEK-TV (channel 6) under the ownership of Western International Communications (WIC). The proposed CanWest service, VITV (&quot;Vancouver Island Television&quot;), would have had transmitters in Victoria and Courtenay.
* Three other companies each proposed to launch a new, local independent station focused on Vancouver:
** The Baton/Electrohome Alliance (a partnership between two of the largest CTV affiliate owners) proposed CIVT-TV on channel 42, focusing on providing a more diverse view of the city and 12.5 hours a week of local news coverage.
** CHUM Limited (owner of Toronto&#x27;s CITY-TV), would have started Vtv (&quot;Vancouver Television&quot;) on transmitters in Vancouver (channel 32) and Victoria (channel 29), promising to duplicate the Citytv formula on the West Coast. In a move regarded as &quot;unprecedented&quot;, sitting BC premier Glen Clark endorsed the CHUM application.
** Craig Broadcast Systems (owner of two stations in Manitoba and shortly thereafter licensed to launch two more in Alberta) sought to start a service to be known as &quot;Very Independent Television&quot; (VITV), also broadcast on UHF in Vancouver and Victoria, complete with a multilingual news service producing English, Mandarin, and Punjabi-language news programs (with the latter two in the dinner hour) as well as a nightly entertainment show named &quot;Yaletown&quot;.

The commission&#x27;s decision, released on January 31, 1997, approved only the Baton–Electrohome application. The prospective Rogers station was denied largely because it would have replaced some of Talentvision&#x27;s existing ethnic programming with U.S. syndicated fare. Moreover, Talentvision&#x27;s existing owner (the company now known as Fairchild Media Group) indicated there was &quot;no plan to abandon [the current Talentvision licence] at this time&quot;. As for CanWest, the commission determined that the existence of the CHAN/CHEK twinstick did not justify licensing a new station to a company already serving the market.

The three proposals for an independent station in Vancouver were all determined to be high-calibre. However, the deciding factor in favour of Baton/Electrohome was a commitment to air new Vancouver-produced programming (which ultimately manifested as, among other programs, &quot;Gabereau Live!&quot;, &quot;The Camilla Scott Show&quot;, and &quot;Cold Squad&quot;) across all of Baton&#x27;s and Electrohome&#x27;s stations, a promise that the smaller CHUM and Craig station groups could not match. The decision was met with mixed reception in the entertainment community; Baton&#x27;s large commitment to Canadian programming won praise from the production industry, but others had generally backed the CHUM application, and several people wished the CRTC had awarded multiple stations.

===&quot;Vancouver Television&quot;===

Construction and planning for CIVT began immediately after the licence award. In March, Baton secured space in a former public library at Robson and Burrard streets; the space had been planned as an arcade, but the proposal was rejected by Vancouver&#x27;s city council just days before the CRTC decision. Ivan Fecan, the chief executive of Baton, led much of the early planning effort. Fecan had been the former program head of CBC television and a former protégé of Moses Znaimer, founder of CITY-TV, whose format was a major inspiration for the new Vancouver station; in an interview with &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;, he described the CIVT format as how City might look &quot;if it was moved from Queen Street to Bloor and Yonge&quot;. Znaimer went so far as to claim that Fecan had stolen CITY&#x27;s format outright for CIVT. In July, channel 9 was assigned as its designation on Lower Mainland cable systems. Occupancy of the Robson and Burrard studios, which were designed by Vancouver firm James Cheng Architects, was granted with only a week to go until launch, with delays owing to waivers needed to place satellite dishes on the heritage building&#x27;s roof and a strike of city workers that delayed permitting.

For news coverage, Baton had counted on the services of former BCTV news director Cameron Bell in the application phase, and BCTV assignment editor Clive Jackson left after 18 years to join CIVT. As with the rest of the new station&#x27;s mandate, the newsroom aimed to focus on Vancouver&#x27;s diversity with an emphasis on the Asian community, which was perceived to be underrepresented by the existing Vancouver television stations. New news bureaus were set up in communities around the Lower Mainland and on Vancouver Island—Victoria, North Vancouver, Burnaby, Port Coquitlam, Surrey, and Richmond—staffed with multilingual reporters. Baton seconded programming executive Susanne Boyce to Vancouver to manage the startup of CIVT&#x27;s non-news programming.

Meanwhile, the impending birth of CIVT was already having an impact on the television industry in Canada. When WIC carried out a round of layoffs in April 1997, analysts ascribed the reasoning to the new competition forthcoming in Vancouver. When the licence was awarded, BCTV was buying 18 hours a week of programs from Baton&#x27;s Baton Broadcast System (BBS) division, consisting of 12 hours of American series and six hours of Canadian productions. These shows, which included &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, &quot;Home Improvement&quot;, and &quot;Cosby&quot;, all moved to CIVT. Baton also owned the Canadian rights to some programs that CKVU aired in the Vancouver market. The entertainment schedule was rounded out by several CTV cast-off shows.

CIVT, branded as Vancouver Television (VTV), began broadcasting on September 22, 1997; the channel had changed from 42 to 32 prior to launch. The station&#x27;s local programs at launch included a two-hour morning show, &quot;Vancouver Breakfast&quot;, and &quot;Vancouver Live&quot; newscasts at noon, 6 p.m., and 11 p.m., as well as &quot;Gabereau Live!&quot;, a talk show hosted by former local CBC radio personality Vicki Gabereau, and several weekly news and political satire programs, including former CBC Radio staple &quot;Double Exposure&quot;. &quot;Vancouver Breakfast&quot;, hosted by Aamer Haleem, Linda Freeman, and radio DJ Ted Schredd, featured a set adorned with chairs and props shaped like strawberries, bacon, and eggs; Alex Strachan of &quot;The Vancouver Sun&quot; called it &quot;an alarm clock that wouldn&#x27;t stop ringing&quot;. The 6 p.m. &quot;Vancouver Live&quot; was co-anchored by former MuchMusic VJ Monika Deol.

As construction on CIVT finished and the station began operation, Baton initiated a series of transactions that gave it control of the CTV Television Network, Canada&#x27;s largest private TV network. In August 1997, Baton bought Electrohome&#x27;s broadcasting assets in exchange for a 23-percent voting interest. Two months later, the company executed an asset swap with CHUM by which two Ontario stations were sold in exchange for CHUM&#x27;s CTV-aligned operation in the Maritimes. These deals gave Baton controlling interest in CTV, which had once been structured on a cooperative basis. To complete its ownership, Baton spent $42 million to purchase the CTV shares held by WIC (as owner of BCTV, the provincial CTV affiliate) and Moffat Communications, owner of the CTV affiliate in Winnipeg; in 1998, the company renamed itself CTV Inc. BCTV held a continuing affiliation agreement with the CTV network through August 1999, and its CEO promised no near-term changes to the station.
Baton&#x27;s deals for CTV had an impact from the start on VTV. Daryl Duke, an influential Vancouver film director who had previously founded CKVU in 1976 and who had backed the Baton–Electrohome bid because he felt it granted the most local control of any of the five original proposals, resigned in October. He claimed the station&#x27;s advisory board was a legal fiction due to changes in company composition and that he was a &quot;director of hot air&quot;. Catherine Murray, a faculty member at Simon Fraser University, also resigned. Analysis of VTV&#x27;s first year in operation was mixed. Murray criticized VTV as a clone of Citytv where original Canadian shows were consigned to &quot;schedule ghettos&quot; in less-viewed dayparts, and a disillusioned Duke noted that &quot;everything they do locally is noisy pursuit of raucous trivia&quot;. Overall station ratings showed little growth from the audience VTV drew at its launch. However, other programs were receiving praise. Despite ratings that trailed even the CBC, a longtime laggard for the Vancouver news audience, &quot;Vancouver Live at 6&quot; was named Canada&#x27;s best newscast by the Radio-Television News Directors Association, and the twelve Gemini Awards nominations for VTV programs exceeded the combined total of some other station groups. Advertisers also welcomed the concomitant increase in inventory brought by the new station. Further, the station obtained the local telecast rights to Vancouver Canucks hockey—which had been held by BCTV for 27 years—along with Vancouver Grizzlies basketball, beginning in 1998. The noon newscast was dropped, but a 5 p.m. newscast was added.

VTV&#x27;s early years were marked by turmoil and turnover in on-air personalities and management. Deol left within a year to spend more time with her family. In December 1998, management hired an external candidate for news director. This led to several resignations, including that of Jackson, who returned to BCTV; the move was seen as a blow to morale. Some turnover among news reporters and anchors marked promotions; for instance, Satinder Bindra left VTV to join CNN. News anchor Paul Mennier left for A-Channel Edmonton, in part because of disgust with the continued low ratings; Mi-Jung Lee served as his replacement. In 1999, the newscasts were retitled as &quot;VTV News&quot;, coinciding with a shuffling of the anchor lineup.

===From VTV to CTV===
In 1999, CanWest and Shaw Communications ended a year-long dispute for the assets of Western International Communications, parent of BCTV. In the deal, WIC&#x27;s television holdings, among them BCTV, were sold to CanWest. CanWest already owned CKVU, and it was expected to have to sell one of CHAN or CKVU by the CRTC. CTV expressed interest in the possibility of acquiring the dominant BCTV. However, CanWest instead announced in February 2000 that it would sell CKVU, the existing Global station. That decision—which set up an affiliation switch to take place in 2001, postponed a year at the CRTC&#x27;s direction—was immediately understood as making CIVT the new CTV station in British Columbia. It also caused a significant amount of program shuffling between BCTV and VTV for various series to which CTV held the rights.

On September 1, 2001, CIVT-TV became &quot;BC CTV&quot;, adopting a format and philosophy more in line with the rest of the CTV network and a name that seemed intended to be similar to BCTV. 

As part of the CTV switch, in lieu of chasing younger viewers, the station would focus more squarely on adults 25–54. Typifying the shift was CIVT securing the services of BCTV news anchors Pamela Martin and Bill Good to anchor the new CTV newscasts. As CIVT had no over-the-air rebroadcasters in the rest of British Columbia, CTV&#x27;s reach was diminished and Global&#x27;s expanded. However, the CRTC authorized many cable providers throughout the province to begin carrying CIVT for the first time, ensuring the continuity of CTV programming on cable in areas where CHAN had previously provided it. After the switch to CTV, CIVT&#x27;s early evening newscast supplanted that of CKVU-TV as the second-place program in the market.
In 2004, CIVT introduced &quot;Chopper 9&quot;, the first full-time news helicopter in Vancouver. In January 2008, CTV began producing a Western Canada edition of &quot;Canada AM&quot; at the CIVT studios, hosted by Rena Heer; due to low ratings, it was cancelled in June of that year. &quot;Canada AM&quot; continued to air until 2011, when CTV&#x27;s stations in Western Canada launched local morning newscasts known as &quot;CTV Morning Live&quot;; a noon newscast was also added at that time. After the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, portions of CTV&#x27;s set in the International Broadcast Centre were repurposed to refresh CIVT&#x27;s newsroom.

On December 7, 2010, Bill Good and Pamela Martin announced their resignation as anchors of the 6 p.m. newscast; they cited the decision not to make another long-term commitment in the form of a contract renewal at their ages, with Good cutting back to his radio show on CKNW. Mike Killeen and Tamara Taggart were announced as their replacements the next day and took over as anchors of the broadcast on January 3, 2011. Taggart—who had been at the station since its launch as VTV—and Killeen were let go as the main &quot;CTV News Vancouver at Six&quot; anchors in April 2018. Mi-Jung Lee and Scott Roberts were named replacement anchors; Roberts was dismissed in 2022, and Lee became the sole anchor for the 6 p.m. program.

CTV Vancouver was the first Canadian television station to win a Edward R. Murrow Award for overall excellence in a large market from the U.S. Radio Television Digital News Association, doing so in 2016.

As part of a round of cuts across Bell Media in June 2023, co-owned CIVI-DT (channel 53) in Victoria ceased presenting its own local newscasts, which were replaced with a single half-hour 4:30 p.m. newscast (repeated at 6:00 and 11:00 p.m.) on weekdays, anchored from Vancouver. CTV Vancouver&#x27;s weekend evening and weekday noon newscasts were canceled in another round of cuts in February 2024.

===Analogue-to-digital conversion===
CIVT&#x27;s digital signal began broadcasting in 2005. CIVT shut down its analogue signal, over UHF channel 32, on August 31, 2011, the official date on which Canadian television stations in CRTC-designated mandatory markets transitioned from analogue to digital broadcasts. The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 33 to its analogue-era UHF channel 32 for post-transition operations.

<doc id="1164480" wikidata="Q1000970" url="?curid=1164480" title="Buddhism in Sri Lanka">
<text>Theravada Buddhism is the largest and official religion of Sri Lanka, practiced by 70.2% of the population as of 2012. Practitioners of Sri Lankan Buddhism can be found amongst the majority Sinhalese population as well as among the minority ethnic groups. Sri Lankan Buddhists share many similarities with Southeast Asian Buddhists, specifically Thai Buddhists and Burmese Buddhists due to traditional and cultural exchange. Sri Lanka is one of only five countries in the world with a Theravada Buddhist majority, and others are Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar.

Buddhism has been declared as the state religion under Article 9 of the Sri Lankan Constitution which can be traced back to an attempt to bring the status of Buddhism back to the status it enjoyed prior to the British colonial era. Sri Lanka is one of the oldest traditionally Buddhist countries.

The island has been a centre of Buddhist scholarship and practices since the introduction of Buddhism in the 3rd century BCE producing eminent scholars such as Buddhaghosa and preserving the vast Pāli Canon. Throughout most of its history, Sri Lankan kings have played a major role in the maintenance and revival of the Buddhist institutions of the island. During the 19th century, a modern Buddhist revival took place on the island which promoted Buddhist education. Due to the island&#x27;s close ties with India, Sinhalese Buddhism has been in part influenced by Hinduism and indigenous beliefs, and some Buddhists share similar beliefs with Hindus, such as the worship of Hindu deities, the caste system, and Animism. Pre-Buddhist historical accounts of Sri Lanka reveal a significant impact of Indian religious trends on the society of Lanka. Some traditional Sinhalese Temple layout also includes individual shrines dedicated to Hindu gods. Some of the most important Hindu gods worshipped by some Sinhalese Buddhists include Vishnu, Murugan, Pathini, Nata, Gambara, Dedimunda, Saraswati, Ganesh, Lakshmi, Shiva, Kali, etc. Demons and spirits are also invoked during Exorcisms and rituals, which seem to be customs passed down from Pre-Buddhist indigenous times. In 2007, there were around 6,000 Buddhist monasteries in Sri Lanka with approximately 15,000 monks.

== Pre-modern history ==
The Theravāda (&quot;Elders&quot;) is a branch of the Vibhajjavāda (&quot;Doctrine of Analysis&quot;, &quot;the analysts&quot;) school, which was a division of the Sthāvira Nikāya, one of the Indian early Buddhist schools. The Sthāviras had emerged from the first schism in the Buddhist community. There is no agreement among modern historians on the details and dating of this schism (even on if it was before or after the date of the emperor Ashoka: 304–232 BCE). It is notable that Ashokan inscriptions do not refer to this council or the schism.

According to Theravāda sources, the Theravāda school maintains the Vibhajjavāda doctrines that were agreed upon during the putative Third Buddhist council held around 250 BCE under the patronage of Ashoka and the guidance of the elder Moggaliputta-Tissa. A record of their doctrinal position survives in the &quot;Kathavatthu&quot; (&quot;Points of Controversy&quot;), a refutation of various opposing views of various schools at the time.

The Vibhajjavādins, fueled by Mauryan patronage (as can be seen in Ashoka&#x27;s edicts), spread throughout South Asia, forming different groups and communities. In South India, they had an influential center at Avanti, as well as being active in Andhra, Vanavasa (in modern Karnataka), Amaravati and Nagarjunakonda. As they became established in Sri Lanka (at Anuradhapura), they also started to become known as the Tambapaṇṇiya (Sanskrit: Tāmraśāṭīya, Tāmraparṇīya), the name refers to a red copper-like colour. The name &quot;Tāmraparṇi&quot; also became a name for Sri Lanka itself.

===Introduction of Buddhism to the island===

According to traditional Sri Lankan chronicles such as the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; and the &quot;Dipavamsa&quot;, Buddhism was introduced into the island in the third century BCE after the Third Buddhist council by the elder Mahinda and by the elder nun Sanghamitta. According to the Sri Lankan chronicles, both were children of the emperor Ashoka. Although Ashoka&#x27;s Edicts mention sending a Buddhist mission to Sri Lanka (among many other places), nowhere does the edicts mention specifically about Mahinda or Sanghamitta. Thus, the claims aren&#x27;t fully accepted by modern scholars. 

According to the &quot;Mahavamsa,&quot; they arrived in Sri Lanka during the reign of Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura (307–267 BCE) who converted to Buddhism and helped build the first Buddhist stupas and communities. Tissa donated a royal park in the city to the Buddhist community, which was the beginning of the Mahāvihāra tradition. Mahinda is associated with the site of Mihintale, one of the oldest Buddhist site in Sri Lanka. Mihintale includes numerous caves which may have been used by the early Sri Lankan sangha.

According to S. D. Bandaranayake, the spread of Buddhism in this period was promoted by the state as well as by lay persons. While there are few artistic or architectural remains from this initial period, there are hundreds of Buddhist caves that have survived that contain numerous Brahmi inscriptions which record gifts to the sangha by householders and chiefs. 

Bandaranayake states that the religion seems to have achieved &quot;undisputed authority&quot; during the reigns of Dutugamy and Valagamba (c. mid-2nd century BCE to mid-1st century BCE). K. M. de Silva states that by the first century BCE, Buddhism was &quot;well established in the main areas of settlement.&quot; De Silva also notes that as Buddhism was adopted by the Sinhalese, it assimilated pre-Buddhist cults, rituals and ceremonies. Buddhism became a powerful factor in the unification of Sri Lankan under a single political power with a unified culture.

The &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; §29 records that during the rule of the Greco-Bactrian King Menander I (165/155 –130 BCE), a Yona (Greek) head monk named Mahadharmaraksita led 30,000 Buddhist monks from &quot;the Yona city of Alasandra&quot; (Alexandria in the Caucasus, around north of modern Kabul, Afghanistan) to Sri Lanka for the dedication of the Ruwanwelisaya Stupa in Anuradhapura. This happened during the reign of the Sinhala king Dutugamunu (161 BC to 137 BCE), who was the first to truly unite the various Sri Lankan states on the island into one polity by defeating the Tamils who had conquered the north.

=== Theravāda in the Anuradhapura Kingdom ===
The culture, laws, and government of the Anuradhapura Kingdom (as well as the other kingdoms which were mostly subservient to it) was strongly influenced by Buddhism.

Over much of the early history of Anuradhapura Buddhism, there were three subdivisions of Theravāda, consisting of the Mahāvihāra, Abhayagiri and Jetavana sects. All three were based in Anuradhapura, the large and populous capital of the ancient Sinhalese kings, which saw themselves as the defenders and supporters of Buddhism.

The Mahāvihāra was the first tradition to be established, while Abhayagiri Vihāra and Jetavana Vihāra were established by monks who had broken away from Mahāvihāra and were more open to Mahayana. According to A. K. Warder, the Indian Mahīśāsaka sect also established itself in Sri Lanka alongside the Theravāda, into which they were later absorbed. Northern regions of Sri Lanka also seem to have been ceded to sects from India at certain times.

Abhayagiri Theravādins maintained close relations with Indian Buddhists over the centuries, adopting many of the latter&#x27;s teachings, including many Mahāyāna elements, whereas Jetavana Theravādins adopted Mahāyāna to a lesser extent. The Mahāvihāra tradition meanwhile considered many of the Mahāyāna doctrines, such as Lokottaravāda (&quot;transcendentalism&quot;), as heretical and considered the Mahāyāna sutras as being counterfeit scriptures.

Religious debate and conflict among these sects were also not unusual, particularly because the close relationship between the sangha and Sinhalese rulers led to competition for royal patronage, though most rulers supported all sects. During the reign of Voharika Tissa (209–31 CE), the Mahāvihāra tradition convinced the king to repress the Mahāyān teachings, which they saw as incompatible with the true doctrine.

The tables were turned during the reign of the king Mahasena (277 to 304 CE), which was marked by his support of Mahāyāna Buddhism and repression of the Mahāvihāra, which refused to convert to Mahāyāna. Mahasena went as far as to destroy some of the buildings of the Mahāvihāra complex to build up Abhayagiri and a new monastery, the Jetavana. Due to this, Abhiyagiri emerged as the largest and most influential Buddhist tradition on the island, and the Mahāvihāra tradition would not regain its dominant position until the Polonnaruwa period in 1055.

During the reign of Kithsirimevan (301–328 CE), Sudatta, the sub-king of Kalinga, and Hemamala brought the Tooth Relic of the Buddha to Sri Lanka. Kithsirimevan enshrined the relic and ordered a procession to be held annually in its honour. The Tooth Relic of the Buddha soon became one of the most sacred objects in the country, and a symbol of Sinhala Buddhist kingship. It was housed and promoted by the Abhayagiri tradition.

When the Chinese monk Faxian visited the island in the early 5th century, he noted 5000 monks at Abhayagiri, 3000 at the Mahāvihāra, and 2000 at the Cetiyapabbatavihāra. Faxian also obtained a Sanskrit copy of the Vinaya of the Mahīśāsaka at the Abhayagiri vihāra (c. 406). This was then translated into Chinese and remains extant in the Chinese Buddhist canon as Taishō Tripiṭaka 1421.

The main architectural feature of Sri Lankan Buddhism at this time was the dome-shaped stupa, which enshrined Buddhist relics and were objects of veneration. In Anuradhapura, the five most important stupas were: the Thuparama (part of the Mahāvihāra complex), the Mirisavati, the Ruvanvalisaya (also known as the Mahastupa), the Abhayagiri and the Jetavana (the largest stupa in the capital, and probably the largest in the Buddhist world at the time of construction).
It is known that in the 8th century, both Mahāyāna and the esoteric Vajrayāna form of Buddhism were being practised in Sri Lanka, and two Indian monks responsible for propagating Esoteric Buddhism in China, Vajrabodhi and Amoghavajra, visited the island during this time.

Abhayagiri remained an influential centre for the study of Theravāda Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna thought from the reign of Gajabahu I until the 12th century. It saw various important Buddhist scholars working in both Sanskrit and Pāli. These include (possibly) Upatissa (who wrote the &quot;Vimuttimagga&quot;), Kavicakravarti Ananda (authored the &quot;Saddhammopåyana&quot;), Aryadeva, Aryasura, and the tantric masters Jayabhadra, and Candramåli.

=== Development of the Theravāda textual tradition ===
Sri Lankan (Sinhala) Buddhists initially preserved the Buddhist scriptures (the Tipitaka) orally, however, according to the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot;, during the first century BCE, destruction brought by the Beminitiyaseya led to the writing down of these scriptures to preserve them. The site of this event was at Aluvihāra temple. According to Richard Gombrich this is &quot;the earliest record we have of Buddhist scriptures being committed to writing anywhere&quot;.

The surviving Pāli texts all derive from the Mahāvihāra tradition. While the other traditions like Abhayagiri no doubt had their own prolific literature, nothing of their work has survived in Pali.

Theravāda Buddhists also developed a series of scriptural commentaries (called the Atthakatha). The Theravāda tradition holds that a tradition of Indian commentaries on the scriptures existed even during Mahinda&#x27;s early days. There were also various commentaries on the Tipitaka written in the Sinhala language, such as the &quot;Maha-atthakatha&quot; (&quot;Great commentary&quot;), the main commentary tradition of the Mahavihara monks, which is now lost. Furthermore, there were also Sinhala texts that were written to translate and explain the Pali Buddhist teachings to those who did not have knowledge of Pali. The Sinhala language thus developed during the Anuradhapura period under the influence of Pali (as well as Sanskrit and Tamil).

As a result of the work of later South Indian scholars who were associated with the Mahāvihāra, mainly Buddhaghosa (4th–5th century CE), Dhammapala and Buddhadatta, Sri Lankan Buddhists adopted Pali as their main scholastic language. This adoption of a lingua franca allowed the Sri Lankan tradition to become more international, allowing easier links with the community in South India and Southeast Asia.

These Mahāvihāra Theravāda monks also produced new Pāli literature such as historical chronicles, hagiographies, practice manuals, summaries, textbooks, poetry, and Abhidhamma texts. Buddhaghosa&#x27;s work on Abhidhamma and Buddhist practice, such as his &quot;Visuddhimagga&quot;, remains the most influential texts of the modern Theravāda tradition apart from the Pāli Canon.

=== Warfare, decline and restoration of the sangha ===

From the 5th century (after the death of Mahanama in 428 CE) to the eleventh century, the island of Sri Lanka saw the weakening of royal Anuradhapura authority, continuous warfare between Sinhala kings, pretenders and foreign invaders from South Indian dynasties (the Cholas, Pallavas and Pandyas). These South Indian dynasties were strongly Hindu and often sought to eliminate Buddhist influence. In time, South Indian Buddhism was wiped out, and this severed a key cultural link between Sri Lanka and South India.

This era of the conflict saw the sacking of Buddhist monasteries and often made the situation difficult for Buddhism. However, in spite of the instability, this era also saw the expansion of Buddhist culture, arts and architecture. By the 9th century, Buddhist monasteries were powerful institutions that owned property, land, estates, and irrigation works. They had been granted these estates by kings and generally hold them in perpetuity. Buddhist monasteries at this stage of Sri Lankan history were basically self-sufficient economic units protected by the Sinhala kings. These Buddhist establishments were also often plundered during times of internal strife by Sinhala rulers competing among themselves, such as during the reigns of Dathopatissa I (639–650) and Kashyapa II (650–659).

Between the reigns of Sena I (833–853) and Mahinda IV (956–972), the city of Anuradhapura saw a &quot;colossal building effort&quot; by various kings during a period of peace and prosperity, the great part of the present architectural remains in this city date from this period. However, this was followed by the invasion and conquest of the Anuradhapura heartland by the Chola empire (between 993 and 1077), a war which devastated Anuradhapura and brought an end to the kingdom.

===The Polonnaruva era===
The Sinhalese in the south of the island (mainly the kingdom of Rohana) continued to resist, and the island was fully reconquered by Vijayabahu I (1055–1110) by 1070 who established the Kingdom of Polonnaruwa. The state of Sri Lankan Buddhism was so bad at this time that he could not find five bhikkhus in the whole island to ordain more monks and restore the monastic tradition; therefore, he sent an embassy to Burma, which sent back several eminent elders with Buddhist texts. Vijayabahu is also known for building the Temple of the Tooth.

The next influential figure in Sinhala Buddhism was Parākramabāhu I (1153–1186) who unified the island and set out to reform the Sri Lankan Buddhist sangha. De Silva notes that this significant reform event was traditionally seen as the triumph of the Mahāvihāra and the repression of the other schools, but that &quot;recent research has shown this to be quite inaccurate.&quot; All Buddhist institutions had been severely damaged by the Hindu Cholas, and the three main traditions had fragmented into eight fraternities. Parākramabāhu united all of these into a common community, which seems to have been dominated by the Mahāvihāra but did not bring an end to sectarian competition completely.

Parākramabāhu seems to have seen the Sangha as being divided, corrupt and in need of reform, especially the Abhayagiri. The &quot;&quot; states that Buddhist monastic communities were experiencing much conflict at this time. This chronicle also claims that many monks in the Sri Lankan Sangha had even begun to marry and have children, behaving more like lay followers than monastics. Parākramabāhu&#x27;s chief monastic leader in these reforms was Mahathera Kassapa, an experienced monk well versed in the Suttas and Vinaya. According to some sources, some monks were defrocked and given the choice of either returning to the laity, or attempting re-ordination under the new unified Theravāda tradition as &quot;novices&quot; (&quot;&quot;).

Parākramabāhu I is also known for rebuilding the ancient cities of Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa, restoring Buddhist stupas and Viharas (monasteries). He appointed a Sangharaja, or &quot;King of the Sangha&quot;, a monk who would preside over the Sangha and its ordinations in Sri Lanka, assisted by two deputies.

According to Alastair Gornall, the period between the 10th to 13th centuries saw a massive explosion in the composition of Pali literature. Part of the impulse behind these literary efforts was the fear that the Indian invasions and various wars on the island could lead to the decline of Buddhism. To prevent this, Pali authors of the reform era attempted to write works which would protect the essence (&quot;sara&quot;) of the Buddha&#x27;s teaching.

This literature includes the work of prominent scholars such as Anuruddha, Sumangala, Siddhattha, Sāriputta Thera, Mahākassapa of Dimbulagala and Moggallana Thera. They worked on compiling subcommentaries to the Tipitaka, grammars, summaries and textbooks on Abhidhamma and Vinaya such as the influential &quot;Abhidhammattha-sangaha&quot; of Anuruddha. They also wrote &quot;kavya&quot; style Pali poetry and philological works. Their work owed much to the influence of Sanskrit grammar and poetics, particularly as interpreted by the Sri Lankan scholar Ratnamati. During this period, these new Pali doctrinal works also show an increasing awareness of topics found in Sanskrit Buddhist Mahayana literature.

During the Polonnaruva era, Theravāda also saw the increasing popularity of &quot;ārannavāsin&quot; (forest dweller) monks, who gained prominence in scholarship and took the lead in reform movements.

As the new Mahāvihāra Theravāda school became dominant in Sri Lanka, it gradually spread through mainland Southeast Asia. Theravāda established itself in Myanmar in the late 11th century, in Thailand in the 13th and early 14th centuries, and in Cambodia and Laos by the end of the 14th century. Although Mahavihara never completely replaced other schools in Southeast Asia, it received special favour at most royal courts. This is due to the support it received from local elites, who exerted a very strong religious and social influence.

=== Fragmentation and decline ===

After the death of Parākramabāhu I, his realm disintegrated into warring factions, and South Indian invaders resumed their attacks on the island, eventually leading to the swift decline of the Polonnaruva kingdom. There was a brief period of rebuilding under Nissanka Malla, who promoted the building of great Buddhist centres at Nissanka Latha Mandapaya, Rankoth Vihara and Hatadage.

However, the kingdom continued to decline, under the attacks by South Indian states. The last Sinhala king to rule from Polonnaruva was Parākramabāhu III (1302–1310), who was actually a client king of the Pandyas and later had to retreat to Dambadeniya. After this, Sinhala kings were forced to retreat further to the south (to cities like Kurunagala and Gampola), mainly in search of security from South Indian states and from the expansive Tamil kingdom of Jaffna (a Hindu realm which now controlled the north-west of the island).

This instability also led to the decline of the discipline of the Sangha. Sinhala kings tried various measures to stem this decline, such as purging the sangha of undisciplined monks and introducing the post of &quot;sangharaja&quot; (chief of the sangha) under the Gampola kings. Regarding sectarian differences, these had mostly been worked out at this point in time, with the adoption of some Mahayana (as well as Hindu) deities and the rituals of the other sects into the Theravada orthodoxy. The cult of the tooth relic retained its importance for example. In spite of all the instability, Sri Lanka was seen by Buddhists in Southeast Asia as a new holy land, since it contained relics of the Buddha which were accessible, in contrast to India which had seen the disappearance of Buddhism and the Muslim invasions.

This period of the Dambadeniya kings also saw a flowering of religious poetry, such as the &quot;Kavsilumina&quot;, written by the king Parākramabāhu II in mahakavya style and the &quot;Saddharma Ratnavaliya&quot; (which retells stories of the Dhammapada commentary).

=== The influence of Mahāyāna ===

Veneration of Avalokiteśvara (Lokeshwara Natha) has continued to the present day in Sri Lanka, where he is called Nātha. In more recent times, some western-educated Theravādins have attempted to identify Nātha with Maitreya. However, traditions and basic iconography, including an image of Amitābha on his crown, identify Nātha as Avalokiteśvara.

Kings of Sri Lanka were often described as bodhisattvas, starting at least as early as Sirisanghabodhi (r. 247–249), who was styled a &quot;mahāsatta&quot; (&quot;great being&quot;, Sanskrit &quot;mahāsattva&quot;), an epithet used almost exclusively in Mahayana. Many other Sri Lankan kings from the 3rd until the 15th century were also described as bodhisattvas and their royal duties were sometimes clearly associated with the practice of the ten pāramitās. In some cases, they explicitly claimed to have received predictions of Buddhahood in past lives.

== Modern era ==
===Early colonialism===
During the beginning of the 16th century, Sri Lanka was fragmented into several kingdoms. The Portuguese Empire exploited this and established Colombo as a way to control the cinnamon trade. The Portuguese became drawn into various wars with these kingdoms. Between 1597 and 1658, a substantial part of the island came under Portuguese rule, though their control was rather tenuous and prone to rebellion. Only the kingdom of Kandy retained its independence.

The Portuguese sought to introduce Catholicism to the island, and in their wars, with the Sinhalese, they often destroyed Buddhist monasteries or handed them over to Catholic orders. From the 16th century onward, Christian missionaries attempted to convert the local population to Christianity. Non-Christian religions were suppressed and persecuted, while Christians were given preferential treatment. Over time, a Christian minority developed on the island. This war-torn period weakened the Buddhist Sangha so much, that in 1592, Vimaladharmasuriya I of Kandy sought aid from Burma to ordain Buddhist monks, as there was hardly a single properly ordained monk left. 

From 1612 to 1658, the Dutch and the Portuguese fought over the island, and Kandy sided with the Dutch. The Dutch won and occupied most of the coastal sections of the island (Dutch Ceylon, 1640–1796), while the kingdom of Kandy retained the interior. The Dutch were less zealous than the Portuguese in their religious proselytizing though they still discriminated against non-Christians (as well as Catholics). Non-Protestant worship was also not allowed in some towns, and Buddhist temple properties that had been confiscated by the Portuguese were not returned.

In the Kandyan kingdom of the interior, Buddhism remained the state religion. Kandyan rulers continued to patronize Buddhist institutions as the ancient Sinhala kings had done, and they remained in control of the tooth relic. Through much of the 18th century, however, the sangha was in a weakened state, with the ordination lineage broken. The Buddhist &quot;priests&quot; of the kingdom lacked the proper ordination rites (at least 5 fully ordained monks are required to fully ordain a new monk). These Buddhist religious figures who were not really proper monks (&quot;bhikkhus&quot;), but served a similar role to traditional monastics were called &quot;ganinnanses.&quot; Kandyan kings did attempt to re-establish the ordination lineage through their religious links to Burmese Buddhism, but these were not very successful.

The most successful attempt to revive the sangha was led by Weliwita Sri Saranankara Thero (1698–1778), who restored the higher ordination on the island by inviting monks from Thailand (thus founding the modern Siam Nikaya which survives to this day). With the support of the Kandyan king Kirti Sri Rajasinha, Weliwita also worked to establish the primacy of Buddhist ritual, and the modern form of the Festival of the Tooth Relic dates to this time. It was also during this period that Kirti Sri Rajasinha issued a decree stating that only those of the govigama caste could join the Siam Nikaya, and those non-govigama bhikkhus which did exist were exiled or prevented from participating in higher ordination.

The reigns of Kirti Sri Rajasinha (1747–1782) and Rajadhi Rajasinha (1782–1798) also saw the restoration of many Buddhist temples that had been destroyed in previous wars as the building of new temples (particularly in and around Kandy, such as Malvatta, Gangarama and Degaldoruva).

=== British rule ===
In 1795–1796, the Dutch territories in Sri Lanka came under the control of the British East India Company. In 1815 a British army conquered a politically divided Kandy and deposed the Sinhalese king. The British retained Sri Lanka until 1948 (though it remained a dominion until 1972). The initial treaty of surrender, the Kandyan Convention, stated that the Buddhist religion would be protected and maintained.

The first half of the 19th century saw the formation of a new monastic fraternity, the Amarapura Nikaya, by monks and would-be monks of non-govigama castes. They travelled to Burma in the first decade of the 19th century to bring back a new ordination which would not be restricted by caste. This new monastic order thrived in the littoral regions outside of Kandy and even made headways into Kandyan territory.

While the British government had a preference for Christians, they were not openly hostile to Buddhism, due to their fear that religious controversies might provoke political unrest. During the first two decades of British rule, there was no official British support for Christian missionary societies. Left to their own resources, the efforts of these missionary organizations made their progress in converting the population slowly, though they did grow. Their activities were also very restricted in the Kandyan regions. From the beginning, the missions used education as a means of evangelisation. Education in these schools (which disparaged Buddhism) was a requirement for government office. Christian missionaries also wrote tracts in Sinhalese attacking Buddhism and promoting Christianity.

After the 1830s, there was a period in which the British supported Christian missionary work much more actively. This was mainly due to the influence of pro-missionary politicians like Lord Glenelg and Governor Stewart Mackenzie (1837–41), as well as to the agitation of missionary agencies themselves. During this period, missionary organizations were the dominant influence in education, and it was believed that education should aim first and foremost to convert the local elites. Also during this time, the official association of the state with Buddhism was severed, in spite of a popular rebellion in 1848. However, the rebellion did cause the British government to become much more conservative in matters of religion and social change, and in the latter half of the 19th century it backed away from its support of missionary efforts they felt would anger the Sinhalese.

===The Buddhist revival===

In the second half of the 19th century, a national Buddhist revival movement began as a response to Christian missionaries and British colonial rule. This movement was empowered by the results of several public debates between Christian priests and Buddhist monks such as Migettuwatte Gunananda Thera and Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Thera. The big five public debates with Protestant missionaries were held in 1865 (the Baddegama and Waragoda debates), 1866 (Udanwita debate), 1871 (Gampola debate), and 1873 (Panadura debate). Topics of the debates included God, the Soul, the resurrection, Karma, Rebirth, Nirvana and the principle of dependent origination. One of these debates, the famed &quot;Panadura debate&quot; of 1873 was widely seen as a victory for Gunananda Thera.

The British government, weary of religious conflict, largely attempted a policy of religious neutrality at this time. During this period, Buddhists formed societies (such as the Society for the Propagation of Buddhism) and centres of learning (Vidyodaya Pirivena and Vidyalankara Pirivena) to promote Buddhism and to print Buddhist literature. A new monastic fraternity was also formed, the Ramanna Nikaya (which split off from the Amarapura Nikaya), which stressed monastic discipline. Indeed, the revival movement was mainly led by these two Nikayas, and the Siam Nikaya in Kandy largely remained uninvolved. During this time the first Buddhist school in Sri Lanka, &#x27;Jinalabdhi Vishodaka&#x27; was founded in 1869 and its founder was Sri Piyaratana Tissa Mahanayake Thero

In 1880 Henry Steel Olcott arrived in Sri Lanka with Madame Blavatsky of the Theosophical Society, causing much excitement on the island. He had been inspired when he read about the Panadura debate and had exchanged letters with Gunananda. After learning about Buddhism from monks such as Sumangala Thera, Olcott converted to the religion. Olcott and the Sinhalese Buddhist leaders established the Buddhist Theosophical Society in 1880, with the goal of establishing Buddhist schools (there were only three at the time, by 1940, there were 429 Buddhist schools on the island). He sponsored Buddhist colleges such as Ananda College in Colombo and the Dharmaraja College in Kandy. Olcott also collected the Buddhist scriptures which had been translated by Western Indologists and based on these, he composed a ‘Buddhist Catechism’ (1881), which promoted Buddhism as a &#x27;scientific religion&#x27; and was used in Buddhist schools until the late 20th century.

The Sri Lankan Theosophical society under Olcott also had its own publications to promote Buddhism; the Sinhalese newspaper, &quot;Sarasavisandarasa&quot;, and its English counterpart, &quot;The Buddhist&quot;. As a result of their efforts, Vesak became a public holiday, Buddhist registrars of marriage were allowed, and interest in Buddhism increased. Olcott was also part of the committee which designed the new Buddhist flag. The presence of a group of westerners who championed Buddhism also had an energizing effect on the sangha.

Another important figure in the revival is Anagarika Dharmapala, initially an interpreter for Olcott, he then travelled around the world preaching Buddhism and associating with clerics, Theosophists, scholars, elites and other interested folks. In Sri Lanka, he preached Buddhism, gave speeches and led the establishment of numerous Buddhist schools, hospitals, seminaries and the Buddhist newspaper &quot;Sinhala Bauddhaya&quot; (in which he wrote a regular weekly column).

After visiting India, he established the pan-Buddhist Maha Bodhi Society in 1891 whose goal was to revive Buddhism in India, and restore the ancient Buddhist shrines at Bodh Gaya, Sarnath and Kushinara. The society also sought to create a universal network of Buddhists around the world and unite the Buddhist world. Dharmapala also represented Theravada Buddhism as a world religion at the World&#x27;s Parliament of Religions of 1893.

A key element of the Buddhist revival was a strong nationalist anti-colonial stance mixed with a sense of Buddhist internationalism. In spite of its strong anti-Christian missionary stance, the Buddhist revival has been described as a &quot;Protestant Buddhism&quot; (but more commonly &quot;Buddhist modernism&quot;) due to how similar the tactics, ideas and organizational forms were to modern Protestant Christianity.

Another key element of the revival was a temperance movement (that also included Sri Lankan Christians), which established numerous temperance societies, similar to the Christian temperance societies. Many of the figures associated with the revival and with the temperance movement were also closely associated with the nationalist independence movement in the early 20th century. The most famous of which is Anagarika Dharmapala, but also includes the Senanayake brothers, mainly F. R. Senanayake, D. C. Senanayake and D. S. Senanayake as well as D. B. Jayatilaka.

==== Modern Buddhist literature and spread to the West ====

The associations of the Buddhist revival also contributed much to the publication of Buddhist literature, and the promotion of Buddhist scholarship. Revivalist Buddhist scholars include Sir D. B. Jayatilaka, F. R. Senanayake, Walisinghe Harischandra and W. A. de Silva. During the revival, journalism was a major arena for religious discussion and debate. English as well as Sinhala were used in this new journalism. The works of the novelists Piyadasa Sirisena and Martin Wickramasinghe are examples of the Buddhist nationalist-influenced literature of the 20th century.

The Buddhist revival also resulted in the spreading of Buddhism in Western countries. Anagarika Dharmapala and Asoka Weeraratna pioneered the establishment of Buddhist Viharas in Europe. Anagarika Dharmapala founded the London Buddhist Vihara in 1926 while Asoka Weeraratna opened a new chapter for the spread of Buddhism in Germany and Europe by establishing the first Buddhist Vihara in Continental Europe, Dr. Paul Dahlke’s Das Buddhistische Haus in 1957. He also founded the German Dharmaduta Society. Monks from Sri Lanka were also sent to live in Germany to spread the Dhamma. Asoka also founded the influential meditation monastery Nissarana Vanaya.

Since the Buddhist revival, Sri Lanka has also been an important centre of Buddhist scholarship in Western languages. One of the first western bhikkhus, the German Nyanatiloka Mahathera, studied in Sri Lanka, established the Island Hermitage there and ordained several western monks. Western monks who studied in the island hermitage such as Nanamoli Bhikkhu and Ven. Nyanaponika (who worked in the Buddhist Publication Society along with Bhikkhu Bodhi) were responsible for many important translations of the Pali Canon and other texts on Buddhism into English and German.

=== Post-Colonial Buddhism and politics ===
In 1948 Sri Lanka was granted self-rule (though it remained a Dominion of the British Empire until 1972) in a peaceful transfer of power. The negotiations with the British were led by D.S. Senanayake, the first prime minister of Sri Lanka who strongly believed in achieving independence through legal and constitutional means.

Senanayake&#x27;s UNP and his opponents in the left-wing parties all promoted the idea of Sri Lanka as a secular state with a plural multi-racial society. This alienated some of the ethnic Sinhalese Buddhist nationalists who believed Buddhism should have the status of state religion (which it had historically enjoyed) and that Sinhala should be the sole national language (this was seen as an equally important element of Sinhalese Buddhist culture). These nationalists were influenced by the idea (first articulated by Anagarika Dharmapala) that Sri Lanka was the holy land of Buddhism (the &quot;Island of Dhamma&quot;, &quot;Dhammadipa&quot;) and that the Sinhalese were the noble protectors of Buddhism, while all other foreigners on the island were a corrupting and dangerous influence. The nationalists also saw the UNP elite as alienated from traditional Sinhalese culture. These Buddhist ethno-nationalists were consolidated under S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike&#x27;s Freedom Party (SLFP), which defeated the UNP in 1956 on a nationalist and anti-Tamil platform.

From the point of view of Buddhist monastics, the idea that Buddhist monks should be involved in politics was vigorously defended by the followers of Anagarika Dharmapala, and by monks such as Walpola Rahula, who wrote an influential book called &quot;Bhiksuvage Urumaya&quot; (The Heritage of the Bhikkhu) in 1946 defending the idea. Rahula draws from the Mahavamsa to argue that the Sinhala Buddhist monk had always been socio-politically engaged (in the past, this meant close ties with kings). He defends the politically engaged monk and argues that they are nobler and more righteous than the forest hermit. Some Buddhists did not adopt a nationalist politics and instead adopted Socialism, seeing capitalism as a Western corruption. This Buddhist Socialism was most strongly defended by D. C. Vijayavardhana, in a book titled Dhamma Vijaya (the Revolt in the Temple).

With the support of Buddhist nationalists, the SLFP introduced and eventually passed the divisive Sinhala Only Act, which made Sinhala the only official language of the nation. This alienated many minorities like the Sri Lankan Tamils in the process, who sought regional autonomy. Under Sirimavo Bandaranaike (the world&#x27;s first female prime minister), the Freedom Party also nationalised most schools in the country that received government aid (a few Catholic schools were fully privatized to avoid this fate). This was particularly resisted by the Catholic minority who ran a widespread system of mission schools (which was considered by the Buddhist nationalists as part of the legacy of colonialism).

After these events, the support of the Buddhist sangha became indispensable for both the UNP and the Freedom Party (SLFP). They both adopted Buddhist symbolism at public functions and promoted Buddhist activities. The government also promoted the restoration of Buddhist archaeological sites, such as Anuradhapura.

In 1972, a new constitution was adopted, supported by the Buddhist nationalists, which gave Buddhism a &quot;foremost place&quot; in the eyes of the state. The &#x27;72 constitution (as well as the current constitution which replaced it in &#x27;78) made it a duty of the state to &quot;protect and foster Buddhism&quot;. Further repressive government policies against the Tamils lead to increasing separatist sentiment and radicalization, culminating with the formation of the Tamil Tigers. The tensions between Tamil separatists (who sometimes resorted to terrorist activities) and the Sinhalese (who in response became more authoritarian or resorted to mob violence) culminated in the Sri Lankan Civil War. The war lasted 25 years, from 1983 to the final defeat of the Tamil Tigers in 2009. The Tigers also attacked Buddhist monasteries and monks, including at famed sites such as Sri Mahabodhi in Anuradhapura (in 1984) and the Temple of the Tooth (in 1998). Sinhalese forces responded with similar attacks on Tamil religious sites (as well as on Christian and Muslim places of worship).

==== Militant Buddhist Nationalism ====
According to Peter Lehr, militant ultra-nationalist Buddhism has been on the rise in Sri Lanka since the 50s. According to Lehr, this is partially fueled by &quot;the impression that Buddhism is under siege by a hostile non-Buddhist enemy,&quot; which has led many Sinhala Buddhists to see themselves as a minority under siege by external forces (historically, the main threat has been Indian Tamil invaders). The influences on this militancy include Anagarika Dharmapala, who had also spoken of Muslims as a dangerous &quot;barbarous race&quot;, who wiped out Buddhism in India and had often preached against Christianity.

This militant nationalism has been taken up by certain extremist figures, in spite of the fact that mainstream Buddhist teachings are unambiguous regarding the prohibition of monastic violence (which is punishable by expulsion from the monastic community) and promote non-violence as a virtue for laypersons to aspire to as well. Buddhist scholars generally see the doctrine of Theravada Buddhism as promoting loving-kindness in all circumstances, even in the face of oppression or terrorism.

However, some Buddhist nationalists have promoted the use of violence in defense of Buddhism and the nation. In this, they could draw on old Buddhist traditions, such as those of the Sinhala kings found in the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; who defended the island against Tamil invaders. One particular episode in the Mahavamsa involving the warrior king Dutugāmunu seems to allow for killing one&#x27;s enemies as long as one is acting with the intention to defend the Buddhist religion.

One of the most infamous acts of this extremist Buddhist nationalism was the assassination of Sri Lankan Prime Minister Solomon Bandaranaike by the Buddhist monk Talduwe Somarama (he was backed by another monk, Mapitigama Buddharakkitha) in 1959. The assassination was caused by Bandaranaike&#x27;s attempts to compromise with the Tamils.

More recent militant figures include Gangodawila Soma Thero and Inamaluwe Sri Sumangala Thero, both of whom regularly preached the idea that the nation was under siege by other religions, especially Muslims. The Jathika Hela Urumaya political party is a Buddhist nationalist political party partly founded and led by &quot;war monks&quot; such as Athuraliye Rathana Thero, who demanded, among other things, that the Tamil Tigers be wiped out, that peace negotiations with them be stopped, and that conversions from Buddhism be banned. Another militant Buddhist nationalist, Inamaluwe Sri Sumangala Thero, has stated that Muslims are &quot;an inhumane/animal-like race of people.&quot; 

Proselytizing from Buddhism has been illegal in Sri Lanka since 2009, due to the increase in conversions to Catholicism, however converting into Buddhism is highly encouraged by the government to be considered a person of Sinhalese origin. 

The Bodu Bala Sena (‘Buddhist Power Force’), is another extremist Buddhist nationalist group in Sri Lanka who, in response to the killing of a Buddhist monk, organized anti-Muslim rallies that led to the anti-Muslim riots of 15–17 June 2014. One of the leading BBS monks, Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara, has given speeches inciting violence against Muslims and was even arrested and sentenced in 2018 for his issuing personal threats. The BBS also targets Sinhalese Buddhists who criticize them. One such figure is Watareka Vijitha Thera, the secretary general of the Jathika Bala Sena (National Power Force, JBS) which promotes peace and co-existence. Watareka Vijitha has been targeted by BBS, been called a traitor and has been physically assaulted. However, according to Lehr the majority of Sinhalese monks remain strictly apolitical and &quot;also rather silent on all things political—which also includes the choice of not commenting on the activities of the politically active ones.&quot; Further anti-Muslim riots have recently rocked the island, in 2018 and 2019.

==== The Forest Movement ====

From the 1950s onwards, a Sri Lankan Forest Tradition has been in development, focusing on renunciation, meditation and forest dwelling. In 1973, Carrithers&#x27; study of the movement reported over 150 hermitages with around 6,000 monks. Though most of the currently occupied forest monasteries were built after the 50s, the modern Sri Lankan Forest Monasticism movement goes back to the 19th century. Puvakdandave Paññānanda (1817–1887) was one of the first monks to establish forest hermitages that remain occupied today (Batuvita and Kirinda).

Some key figures in the 20th century include Kadavadduve Jinavaṃsa, Vaturuvila Ñāṇananda, and Kukulnape Devarakkhita. These forest monks sought to reform the sangha by returning to the forest life and strictly following the Vinaya (ancient monastic rule). Jinavamsa along with Matara Sri Ñāṇārāma founded the Śrī Kalyāṇī Yogāśrama Sansthā, an association of forest meditation hermitages such as Nissarana Vanaya and Nā Uyana Aranya. This movement also produced excellent scholar philosophers, such as Kaṭukurunde Ñāṇananda.

====Bhikkhuni ordination issues====
A few years after the arrival of Mahinda, Bhikkhuni Sanghamitta, who is also believed to be the daughter of Emperor Ashoka came to Sri Lanka. She started the first nun&#x27;s order in Sri Lanka, but this order of nuns died out in Sri Lanka in the 11th century.

Many women have been ordained in Sri Lanka since 1996. In 1996 through the efforts of Sakyadhita, an International Buddhist Women Association, Theravada bhikkhuni order was revived when 11 Sri Lankan women received full ordination in Sarnath, India, in a procedure held by Ven. Dodangoda Revata Mahāthera and the late Ven. Mapalagama Vipulasāra Mahāthera of the Mahābodhi Society in India with assistance from monks and nuns of Korean Chogyo order.
 Some bhikkhuni ordinations were carried out with the assistance of nuns from the East Asian tradition; others were carried out by the Theravada monk&#x27;s Order alone. Since 2005, many ordination ceremonies for women have been organized by the head of the Dambulla chapter of the Siyam Nikaya in Sri Lanka.

== Buddhist organizations ==

=== Monastic groups ===

The different sects of the Sri Lankan (Sinhala) Buddhist sangha are referred to as Nikayas. There are currently two main Nikayas on the island:
* Siam Nikaya, founded in the 18th century by monks from Thailand. This Nikaya only allows higher ordination from the Radala and Govigama castes. They maintain the Temple of the Tooth in Kandy.
* Amarapura-Rāmañña Nikāya – Formed in 2019 as a merger of the Amarapura Nikaya (founded in 1800 through Burmese monastics) and the Rāmañña Nikaya (founded in 1864). It is the largest Nikaya on the island. This tradition allows all to ordain as monks, regardless of caste. 
There are numerous sub-divisions in these main ordination lineages.

=== Other organizations ===
Besides the monastic fraternities, there are various Buddhist institutions and organizations in Sri Lanka. Some of these include:

* Young Men&#x27;s Buddhist Association, a Buddhist version of the YMCA
*All Ceylon Buddhist Women&#x27;s Association
*Sri Lanka Maha Bodhi Society with close ties to the Indian Buddhist sites.
*Buddhist Publication Society, which publishes Buddhist literature in English and Sinhala. 
*The Buddhist (TV channel)
* The Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement of A. T. Ariyaratne, a welfare and conflict resolution organization.
*Sarvodaya Shanthi Sena Sandasaya or Shanthi Sena (Peace Brigade), an organization focused on peace work founded by A. T. Ariyaratne
* Jathika Hela Urumaya, a nationalist political party which includes Buddhist monks in its ranks. 
* Bodu Bala Sena, (Buddhist Power Force or BBS), a Sinhalese nationalist organization known to perpetrate attacks on Sri Lankan Muslims. It has been called an extremist group by Sri Lankan politicians like Mangala Samaraweera and Vasudeva Nanayakkara.

==Demographics==

Buddhism in Sri Lanka is predominantly practised by the Sinhalese people, however the 2012 Sri Lanka Census revealed a Buddhist population of 22,254 amongst the Sri Lankan Tamil population, including eleven monks, accounting to roughly 1% of all Sri Lankan Tamils in Sri Lanka.

<doc id="1164484" wikidata="Q263114" url="?curid=1164484" title="Domino Day">
<text>Domino Day is a world record attempt for the highest number of toppling domino stones, organized from 1998 to 2009 by Endemol Netherlands. Together with Weijers Domino Productions of Robin Paul Weijers, also known as Mr. Domino, parties teamed up to set a new world record. The production was mainly organized at the WTC Expo in Leeuwarden, Netherlands. Domino day did not occur in 2003, because the producer wanted to revise the format.

== Subsequent record attempts ==

== Recurring elements ==

=== Builders&#x27; Challenge ===
Starting in 2004, each Domino Day has featured Builders&#x27; Challenges, with three challenges in 2004 and 2005, and four challenges starting in 2006. Builders are usually chosen in pairs for each Builder&#x27;s Challenge. The chosen builders then have to complete vital parts of the setup while the dominoes are already toppling elsewhere, in order to allow another field of dominoes to topple. This usually takes the form of trying to bridge the gap(s) in an unfinished setup before the toppling dominoes reach it.
For the 2005 event, the dominoes which fell during the third builders challenge were not counted for the record as it was determined that one of the builders restarted the flow of the dominoes after they had stopped due to two being placed too far apart. In the 2006 event the second and third builders challenge were successful in that the challenge was completed, but due to incorrect timing the gates did not lift, thus stopping the flow before it reached the fields.

=== Slow Stones ===
Starting in 2006, a series of &quot;Slow Stones&quot; are placed just before the final Builders Challenge. Slow Stones are relatively large, transparent domino stones filled with colored powder, with each Slow Stone containing a different-colored powder. Upon reaching the first Slow Stone, its powder begins to drain (similar to an hourglass) until it becomes light enough to tip over, hitting the next Slow Stone to start its powder draining. The process takes approximately one minute per Slow Stone. The Slow Stones are used as an opportunity to cut to advertising, show highlights from earlier in the show, do interviews, etc. The builders of the last Builders Challenge are also selected during the Slow Stones, and the challenge itself starts after the last Slow Stone has fallen.

== Past Domino Day editions ==
===Domino Day 2005===

During the preparations of Domino Day 2005 on 14 November, with only four days to go until event, a sparrow flew into the building and landed on several domino bricks, eventually causing 23,000 of them (out of 4 million) to fall. The sparrow was eventually shot by a hired exterminator. Outraged by the shooting, animal rights groups took court actions against the exterminator and the Domino Day production company Endemol. Public prosecutors in The Hague opened an investigation and eventually issued a €200 fine to the exterminator.

=== Domino Day 2006 ===
A new world record was set on 17 November on Domino Day. 4,079,381 stones were toppled out of the 4,400,000 that were set up. The first three builders&#x27; challenges failed so the success of the last challenge was crucial to setting the world record.

The design of the course took about a year and a team of 90 builders took around two months to build it.

The theme, Music in Motion, represents 9 different kinds of music: Rock n&#x27; Roll, Classical Music, Pop Star, Schlager, Roaring 20&#x27;s, Flower Power, World Music, Hip Hop, and Disco Fever.

The Builder&#x27;s Challenges represent the history of the music players, which are: Record Player, Tape Player, CD Player, and MP3 player.

Each Builder&#x27;s Challenge has a field with a number of dominoes with the number 4 At the beginning. The record player challenge field contains 400 dominoes, the tape player challenge has a field of 4,000 dominoes, the CD player challenge contains 40,000 dominoes, and the MP3 player challenge contains 400,000 dominoes.

=== Domino Day 2007 ===
The theme of this year was &#x27;Falling into Life&#x27;. A total of 4,500,000 stones were placed by 85 builders from 12 countries. Only 81.6% of the dominoes fell, resulting in a final count of 3,671,465.

The theme,&#x27;Falling into Life&#x27;, represents 9 different topics which are part of our Life: Loving, Having Fun, Dreaming, Communication, Consuming, Letting Go, Growing, Struggling, Traveling.

Domino Day 2007 was held on 16 November and appeared to fail mostly because of the unsuccessful final challenge to create a bridge of dominoes on a revolving hammer/clock structure to link up with over 400,000 stones. However, it was later revealed that even if this area had fallen, the 2006 record would not have been broken. It was the first time that Domino Day failed to set a new record.

=== Domino Day 2008 ===
On 14 November 2008 the team of Weijers Domino Productions tried to break the world record domino toppling. They set up 4.5 million dominoes in the WTC Expo convention centre in Leeuwarden to try topping the previous record of 2 years ago, which was at 4,079,381 dominoes toppled.

&#x27;Celebrating 10 years of Domino Day - Breaking more World Records than ever&#x27; is the central theme of Domino Day 2008. Domino Day celebrates its 10th anniversary this year.

Although the second Builder&#x27;s Challenge failed, the record was broken with 4,345,027 dominoes toppled. Also, 10 additional world records were attempted and successfully broken. These additional world records were:

# Longest domino spiral (200 m)
# Highest domino climb (12 m)
# Smallest domino stone (7 mm)
# Largest domino stone (4.8 m)
# Longest domino wall (16 m)
# Largest domino structure (25,000 stones)
# Fastest topple of 30 metres of domino stones (4.21 sec) 
# Largest number of domino stones resting on a single domino (727 stones)
# Largest rectangular level domino field (1 million stones)
# Most fallen dominoes (4,345,027 stones)

=== Domino Day 2009 ===
The 2009 event is entitled &#x27;The World in Domino - The Show with the Flow&#x27;. It was the 11th edition of the show; it showed different aspects of the world with the display moving from continent to continent. The design used 4.8 million dominoes. 4,345,028 dominoes were needed to be toppled in order to break the standing world record. Even though part of the final section of the piece did not fall, and three builder&#x27;s challenges failed, the number of dominoes toppled was 4,491,863.

The flows for 2009 are: The American Dream, Latin Extravaganza, The African Life, Colors of Europe, Balancing Yin and Yang, Rough Ice, and Sun, Sand, and Sealife.

The 1st and 2nd Builder&#x27;s Challenges contained 25,000 dominoes representing earth and air, the 3rd Builder&#x27;s Challenge contained 50,000 dominoes representing water, and the 4th Builder&#x27;s Challenge had 500,000 dominoes representing all of Earth&#x27;s continents.

=== 2010–2020 ===
From 2010, until 2020, the show was officially paused due to financial and organizational problems.

== Future ==
On February 3, 2020, EndemolShine Nederland announced Domino Day 2020 through an Instagram post, on 16 June producer EndemolShine announced that the 2020 edition will be postponed to March 2021. On 9 September 2021, Domino Day was postponed to an indefinite date. As of March 2024, no further date has been announced.

<text>Nathan Purdee (born August 6, 1950 in Tampa, Florida) is an American actor, best known for his roles in popular soap operas. 
==Career==
Purdee rose to prominence as mobster-turned-private investigator Nathan Hastings on the CBS soap opera &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, a role he portrayed from 1984 to 1992. His involvement on &quot;Y&amp;R&quot; (he was one of only two black cast members on the show in the late 1980s) paved the way for more African American additions to the cast. In this period, while appearing on Santa Barbara, Purdee performed the first interracial kiss on American daytime television. He left &quot;Y&amp;R&quot; in December 1991 and moved to New York in January 1992 to play the role of District Attorney Hank Gannon on the ABC soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, a role he would portray until 2003. Between &quot;Y&amp;R&quot; and &quot;OLTL&quot;, he portrayed Youngblood &quot;Superfly&quot; Priest in &quot;The Return of Superfly&quot;, the third and final installment in the classic &quot;Super Fly&quot; trilogy. On February 11, 2009, it was announced he would be returning to &quot;One Life to Live&quot; in April 2009.

In 2017, it was announced that Purdee would return to the screen in &quot;Killian &amp; the Comeback Kids&quot; with &quot;One Life to Live&quot; co-star Kassie DePaiva. The film would be written and directed by Purdee&#x27;s son Taylor A. Purdee.

<text>Ellsworth Land is a portion of the Antarctic continent bounded on the west by Marie Byrd Land, on the north by the Bellingshausen Sea, on the northeast by the base of the Antarctic Peninsula, and on the east by the western margin of the Filchner–Ronne Ice Shelf. It extends between 103°24&#x27;W and 79°45&#x27;W. The area west of 90°W is unclaimed, the area between 84°W and 90°W is claimed by Chile only, and the remainder by Chile and the United Kingdom as a part of the British Antarctic Territory. Eights Coast stretches between 103°24&#x27;W and 89°35&#x27;W, and Bryan Coast between 89°35&#x27;W and 79°45&#x27;W.

It is largely a high ice plateau, but includes the Ellsworth Mountains and a number of scattered mountain groups: Hudson, Jones, Behrendt, Hauberg, Merrick, Sweeney and Scaife Mountains.

This land lies near the center of the area traversed by American explorer Lincoln Ellsworth on an airplane flight during November–December 1935. It was named for him by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names in 1962 to commemorate that historic transcontinental flight from Dundee Island to the Ross Ice Shelf.

Information regarding the biodiversity of Ellsworth Land is comparatively limited due to the fewer research surveys and visitations in the region. Forty species of lichen and five of moss have been identified, with &quot;Usnea sphacelata&quot; being amongst the most prominent species in the region. Colonies of Adélie penguins have been observed on multiple offshore islands in the adjacent Amundsen Sea.

<doc id="1164511" wikidata="Q2386447" url="?curid=1164511" title="Tabcorp">
<text>Tabcorp is Australia&#x27;s largest gambling company, employing more than 5,000 people. It is the largest provider of wagering and gaming products and services in Australia. Tabcorp is listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX).

==History==
In 2017, Tatts Group combined with Tabcorp Holdings Limited to create a diversified entertainment group under the Tabcorp brand. The following year UBET was transitioned back into the flagship TAB brand. In July 2021, Tabcorp announced it would spin off its lotteries and keno business into a separate listed company, with Tabcorp retaining its wagering and media arm.

===Tabcorp history===
In 1961, the Victorian TAB (Totalisator Agency Board) was established, legalising off-course totalisator betting. Three years later in 1964, the NSW TAB was established, betting on two race meetings on its first day at Canterbury and Menangle.

Tabcorp was listed on the Australian Securities Exchange by the Government of Victoria in August 1994, operating a wagering and gaming licence in Victoria. In 1999, Tabcorp announced the acquisition of Star City Holdings and in 2000 it acquired Structured Data Systems which developed wagering and Keno systems and animated games.

Tabcorp merged with Jupiters in November 2003 and in 2004, took over Tab Limited, the New South Wales based wagering and media company, including Sky Channel.

Matthew Slatter became CEO of Tabcorp in 2002, and oversaw the merge with Jupiters in 2003. However, after a 10% fall in profits in early 2007, he was sacked by the Tabcorp board. 

In 2011, Tabcorp demerged its casino operations resulting in Tabcorp&#x27;s casinos business being separately listed as Echo Entertainment Group. The existing wagering, media, gaming and Keno businesses were retained by Tabcorp.

In 2012, Tabcorp commenced operating Victoria&#x27;s new Wagering and Betting Licence. In 2014 Tabcorp acquired ACT TAB. In 2016, Tabcorp acquired the gaming systems company Intecq.

In May 2022, Tabcorp shareholders approved the scheme of arrangement for the demerger of the Lotteries and Keno business The Lottery Corporation from Tabcorp. The Lottery Corporation commenced trading on the ASX on 24 May 2022. The Lottery Corporation operate the brands The Lott and Keno. 

In June 2024, former Australian Football League CEO Gillon McLachlan was appointed CEO of Tabcorp, beginning the role in August 2024.

====Controversies====
On 16 March 2017, Tabcorp was fined 45 million for breaching money-laundering laws. Suspicious behaviour on 108 occasions was not reported to the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC).

On 22 August 2007, an investigation by news.com.au reporters Will Temple and David Higgins revealed claims that Tabcorp had secret approval from the NSW government to loan money to &quot;select high value wagering customers&quot;.

In April 2018, the UK Gambling Commission fined Tabcorp £84,000 after its subsidiary business Sun Bets, was found to have breached gambling laws for a publicity stunt involving taking bets on Sutton United&#x27;s reserve goalkeeper eating a pie during an FA Cup tie against Arsenal F.C. in February 2017.

===Tatts Group history===
TAB Qld (TABQ) opened for business in 1962 and was listed by the Government of Queensland on the ASX in November 1999. In 2000, TABQ acquired the Northern Territory TAB from the Government of the Northern Territory and in 2002, the South Australian TAB from the Government of South Australia. In December 2002, TABQ changed its name to UNiTAB.

In 2004, UNiTAB acquired Maxgaming NSW and in 2005 Tattersalls Ltd listed on the ASX and acquired Bytecraft. Tattersalls Ltd and UNiTAB conducted a merger of equals in 2006 under the Tattersalls brand. In 2007, Tattersalls acquired Talarius and Golden Casket and changed its name to Tatts Group.

In 2010, Tatts Group acquired NSW Lotteries. In 2012, Tatts Group acquired SA Lotteries and Tote Tasmania. In 2014, Tatts Group secured a Queensland wagering deal with 30 years exclusivity, and in the same year Victorian Instant Scratch-Its returned to Tatts Group. In 2015, Tatts Group launched Set For Life and UBET. In 2016, Tatts Group launched the Lott and MAX as well as securing a 15-year monitoring licence. In the same year, Tatts Group sold Talarius to Novomatic.

===Wagering and Media===
Tabcorp was the market leader in Australian wagering, operating under the TAB brand until the 2020 combination of Flutter&#x27;s SportingBet with BetEasy.

TAB operates in 4,400+ venues across Australia and in FY18 delivered $1 billion in returns to industry partners. TAB takes 1.1 billion bets annually and has 57% revenue market share.

===Gaming Services===
MAX operates gaming services across 3,500+ venues across Australia.

<doc id="1164512" wikidata="Q2262883" url="?curid=1164512" title="WNBA Finals">
<text>The WNBA Finals is the championship series of the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA) and the conclusion of the league&#x27;s postseason each fall. The series was named the WNBA Championship until 2002.

The series is played between the winners of the playoff semifinals. At the conclusion of the championship round, the winner of the WNBA Finals is presented the championship trophy. The WNBA Finals has been played at the conclusion of every WNBA season in history, the first being held in 1997.

Since 2005, the winner of the WNBA Finals has been determined through a 2–2–1 format. The first, second, and fifth games of the series are played at the arena of the team who earned home court advantage by having the better record during the regular season. Beginning in 2025, the Finals will switch to a best-of-seven series with a 2–2–1–1–1 format similar to that of the NBA Finals.

== History ==

The WNBA&#x27;s playoff format has changed several times in the league&#x27;s history. In 1997, a single championship game was held to decide the champion. In 1998, after the addition of two teams, the WNBA finals were turned into a best-of-three series. The finale series was known as the WNBA Championship from 1997 to 2001, before changing to WNBA Finals to reflect its NBA counterpart. In 2005, the WNBA Finals adopted a best-of-five format. In 2016, the WNBA began seeding teams #1 through #8 regardless of conference making it possible for two Eastern Conference or two Western Conference teams to meet in the Finals. In 2025, the WNBA Finals will become a best-of-seven series and a homecourt system of 2–2–1–1–1 similar to the NBA Finals, where the team with homecourt advantage hosts games 1 and 2, and if necessary, games 5 and 7.

== Map of champions ==
== Results ==

===Highlights===
*In 2001, the #4 seed Charlotte Sting were the lowest seed to make the WNBA Finals in the conference playoff format.
*The 2003 WNBA Finals was best known for rekindling a heated rivalry between the two teams&#x27; head coaches, Los Angeles Sparks head coach Michael Cooper and Detroit Shock head coach Bill Laimbeer. Both coaches were fierce NBA competitors who played in the NBA Finals against each other in 1988 and 1989.
*2006 marked the first time that a #1 seed did not participate in the WNBA Finals. Detroit and Sacramento were both #2 seeds.
*2006 also marked the first time that the team with the best point-differential in the regular-season did not win the WNBA Finals or even advance to the WNBA Finals. The Connecticut Sun had the best point differential in &#x27;06 but were ousted by the Shock in the Eastern Conference Finals.
*The Detroit Shock hosted the largest crowd in Finals History (tied, 22,076 in Game 3 of the 2003 WNBA Finals and in Game 5 of the 2007 WNBA Finals).
*The 2007 game-five win by the Phoenix Mercury marked the first time in WNBA history that a team won the Finals while playing on their opponent&#x27;s home court.
*In 2008 the San Antonio Silver Stars became the first team in WNBA Finals history to be swept in a five-game series, losing to the Detroit Shock.
*The 2011 WNBA Finals was the first coached by two women.
*In 2014, the Chicago Sky became the first team to appear in the WNBA Finals with a sub-.500 record.
* In 2016, the Los Angeles Sparks won by one point despite a later announcement by the WNBA that officials missed an earlier shot-clock violation at 1:14, which should not have counted.

<doc id="1164517" wikidata="Q597320" url="?curid=1164517" title="Empordà">
<text>Empordà (; ) is a natural and historical region of Catalonia, Spain, divided since 1936 into two &quot;comarques&quot;, Alt Empordà and Baix Empordà.

The city of Figueres, an important urban and economic center of the Empordà, was designated the capital of Alt Empordà, while La Bisbal d&#x27;Empordà, following a more geographic and historical criteria, became the capital of Baix Empordà.

Empordà has been the cradle for many pictoric schools, with surrealism standing out, including artists such as Salvador Dalí, Angel Planells, Joan Massanet and Evarist Vallès.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Empordà&quot; is a derivative of Empúries (&quot;Empòrion&quot; in Old Greek or &quot;Emporiae&quot; in Latin), which means &quot;the markets&quot;.

The name Empordà comes from a succession of phonetic derivatives of County of Empúries, a county which had its capital first in Sant Martí d&#x27;Empúries and then in Castelló d&#x27;Empúries the capital of medieval Empordà during the period of political splendor of this county. This was one of the most insurgent toward royal power and one of the last ones to join the Crown of Aragon, which led to a few odd episodes such as the deviation of the Ter (river) or the unfinished build of the Montgrí Castle on top of the Montgrí Massif.

The Baix Empordà born writer Josep Pla used to refer to the surroundings of his native Palafrugell as Empordanet, or the region that goes in between the Gavarres and the Montgrí, and that name is still used today to refer to the Baix Empordà.

== History ==
The region was already inhabited in the prehistory. There are a number of caves that served as a shelter for paleolithic men in the Montgrí Massif; the most famous ones share the same name: &quot;Cau Del Duc&quot;, one in Torroella and the other in Ullà. We also find important megalithic structures in Massís de les Gavarres or Massís de Cadiretes, as well as the dolmens in Fitor.

The Greeks established themselves very close to the actual region, in Roses (possibly a colony of Rhodes, though this is uncertain) in the 8th century BC and in Empúries at the beginning of the 6th century BC.

The Iberians built one of their main cities in Ullastret in the 6th century BC; the name of the tribe was Indigetes. But with the arrival of the Romans, a process of transformation was initiated that changed the occupational system and the economic exploitation of the territory, which led to the abandonment of Ullastret in the 2nd century BC.

The Baix Empordà was Romanized like all other places of the Roman Empire but that was followed by barbaric invasions in the 3rd and 5th centuries that notably impoverished the region and reduced their urban centers to the minimum expression.

There are many traces of the Romanization, but it is hard to envision the print of the Visigoths and the Arabs, because the proximity of the Kingdom of the Franks caused the creation of independent counties ruled by feudal lords.
The Muslim invasion actually lasted less than sixty years (714–785) and the old Hispano-Gothic population came back.

The administrative division of the Carolingian Empire divided the conquered Catalan territory in counties. While the north of the county and the current Alt Empordà was organised around the county of Empúries, the rest were regions or sub-regions of the Bishop of Girona, owner of extensive lands—especially in the Baix Empordà-, or baronies from branches of the Cardona vinculated to the county, to then be the maritime center of the county of Girona, from Begur to Sant Feliu de Guíxols. The first &quot;drassanes&quot; or shipyards where found in Empordà in the 10th century, as well as in Tortosa in 945, then ruled by Abd al-Rahman III.

<text>Auto Train is an scheduled daily train service for passengers and their automobiles operated by Amtrak between Lorton, Virginia (near Washington, D.C.), and Sanford, Florida (near Orlando). &quot;Auto Train&quot; is the only motorail service in the United States.

Passengers ride in coach seats or private sleeping car rooms while their vehicles are carried in enclosed automobile-carrying freight cars called autoracks. The train can carry up to 340 vehicles. The train also includes lounge cars and dining cars. &quot;Auto Train&quot; allows its passengers to avoid driving Interstate 95 in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida while bringing their own vehicles with them. It has the highest revenue of any train in Amtrak&#x27;s Long Distance Service Line.

The service operates as train number 52 northbound and number 53 southbound. The train operates non-stop between its Virginia and Florida terminals, except for a brief stop in Florence, South Carolina, for servicing and a crew change of the engineers and conductors.

Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Auto Train&quot; is the successor to an earlier, similarly named service operated by the privately-owned Auto-Train Corporation in the 1970s.

== History ==
=== Auto-Train Corporation ===
The original &quot;Auto-Train&quot; operated on Seaboard Coast Line Railroad and Richmond, Fredericksburg &amp; Potomac tracks. It was operated by Auto-Train Corporation, a privately owned railroad carrier founded by Eugene K. Garfield. Garfield had worked at the U.S. Department of Transportation, which had funded a study of the practicality of an automobile-train service. He then resigned and later used the study as the blueprint for his enterprise. The company provided a service unique in the country: scheduled rail transportation for passengers and their automobiles between Lorton, Virginia, near Washington, D.C., and Sanford, Florida, near Orlando, Florida.

The Auto-Train Corporation used its own rolling stock, painted in red, white, and purple. The typical train was equipped with two or three General Electric U36B diesel-electric locomotives; double-deck auto carriers; streamlined passenger cars, including coaches, dining cars, and sleeping cars; and full-dome cars; and a caboose, then an unusual sight on most passenger trains. The engines were freight types, purchased at much lower cost than passenger types. But they lacked steam generators, so heat to the passenger cars was supplied by steam-generator cars. Passengers rode in wide coach seats or private first-class sleeping compartments, and meals were served in dining cars. Their vehicles were carried in enclosed autoracks. The company&#x27;s first autoracks were acquired used, and started life in the 1950s as an innovation of the Canadian National (CN) Railroad. The CN cars were huge by the standards of the time: each 75-footer (23.86 m) could carry eight vehicles, which were loaded through doors at each end.

The &quot;Auto-Train&quot; began running on December 6, 1971. It was immediately popular with the traveling public and at first enjoyed financial success as well. In fiscal year 1974 the company turned a profit of $1.6 million on revenues of $20 million. In May 1974, service began over a second route between Florida and Louisville, Kentucky, and the company was mulling additional service between Chicago and Denver. The Louisville extension proved to be the company&#x27;s undoing. The decaying Louisville and Nashville Railroad track between Louisville and Florida (which also hampered Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Floridian&quot;) hindered operations, and a pair of derailments stretched the company&#x27;s finances to the breaking point. Service ceased in April 1981.

=== Amtrak ===
Amtrak planned to introduce a Midwest–Florida auto train service called &quot;AutoTrak&quot; in 1974. Running between Indianapolis and , it would have competed with Auto-Train&#x27;s Louisville–Sanford service. Amtrak built a terminal at Poinciana, acquired 20 auto-carrier cars, and ran a test train loaded with rented autos on April 30 – May 1, 1974. The test train damaged the autos; Amtrak delayed and eventually cancelled the AutoTrak service.

Nearly two years after the Auto-Train Corporation folded, the Virginia–Florida service was revived by Amtrak. Amtrak acquired the terminals in Lorton and Sanford and some of the Auto-Train equipment. On October 30, 1983, it introduced a triweekly version of the service under the restyled name &quot;Auto Train&quot;. Daily service was introduced a year later.

Amtrak used Auto-Train&#x27;s bi-level and tri-level autoracks. For passenger equipment, it initially used a mixture of former Auto-Train railcars and mid-century long-distance railcars from Amtrak&#x27;s general fleet, all rebuilt to Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Heritage Fleet&quot; standards. In the mid-1990s, Amtrak replaced all these passenger railcars, which were of the conventional single-level type, with its newer, bi-level Superliner I and II equipment. In 2006, the aging bi-level, tri-level, and &quot;van&quot; autoracks were phased out and replaced with 80 new autoracks.

Amtrak operates two Auto Trains simultaneously each day: southbound #53 from Lorton and northbound #52 from Sanford, departing at 5 p.m. for a scheduled arrival the following day at 10 a.m. In practice, however, the trains usually run late. In May 2021, for example, only 31 percent of Auto Trains arrived on time, mostly because of interference by freight trains that have preference over much of the route.

The &quot;Auto Train&quot; was the last Amtrak service to permit smoking on board. Amtrak discontinued the practice on June 1, 2013.

&quot;Auto Train&quot; operates on the same route it and its predecessor have always used; the entire route is owned by CSX Transportation except for the southern , which are owned by SunRail.

== Ridership ==
Ridership declined through 2019, then dropped 30.3% to 163,556 in 2020, the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. It recovered somewhat in 2021 to 199,414 and then set a new ridership record in 2022 with 279,019 passengers. This figure rose slightly once more in 2023, with another new record set of 283,646 riders.

The &quot;Auto Train&quot; has the highest revenue of any Amtrak long-distance train. The train had total revenue of US$75,169,554 in FY2016, down 7.9% from FY2015.
== Operations ==

The train operates every day. At 12:30 pm, the station gates are opened to allow the vehicles into the vehicle staging area. Here, each vehicle is assigned a unique number, which is affixed to the driver&#x27;s door magnetically. The vehicle is typically videoed to document existing dents and other damage, in case a damage claim is later filed. The passengers leave their vehicles here and take their carry-on bags with them into the station to await boarding. The vehicles are then staged near the autorack ramps by size and length for optimal loading order and are then loaded onto the autoracks. Motorcycle owners help tie their bikes down to a motorcycle carrier that is then loaded into the autorack. Passengers cannot access their vehicles during the trip.

Vehicles and passengers are accepted up until 3 p.m., after which the autoracks are closed and coupled together, the passenger cars are coupled together in the case of Sanford departures, and the autoracks are coupled to the rear of the consist. At 5 p.m., the train departs the station. 

About 1 a.m., the train makes its sole scheduled stop, at the Florence, South Carolina, station, where a new engineer and conductors take over and the train takes on fuel and water. No passengers embark or disembark here.

The schedule calls for the trains to arrive in Lorton and Sanford about 10 a.m. the next day. When the trains arrive on time, they have covered the 855-mile (1,376 km) journey in about 17 hours, at an average speed of about 50 miles per hour (80 km/h). 

Passengers cannot immediately leave the train, as the autoracks are first decoupled from the consist, and in the case of the Sanford station, the passenger cars are split into two sections to fit on Sanford&#x27;s shorter platforms. At this point, the passengers are then allowed to disembark and move to the auto claim area. Cleaning crews move into the train after passengers leave, and the train is re-supplied with food and water. The passenger car seat backs are flipped to allow everyone in coach to ride facing forward.

The autoracks are further split into three to six sections and each section is aligned with a loading ramp (see picture). The doors between each are opened, and connecting ramps are lowered to allow vehicles to move between cars. At this point vehicles begin to roll off the autoracks and to the claim area, where they are identified and announced by the vehicle number that was attached to the vehicle at the origin station. Vehicles are not unloaded in the same order they were loaded. It normally takes one hour to unload all vehicles from a full train. 

The first 30 vehicles off belong to passengers who have paid an extra fee, a service Amtrak has offered by the name Priority Vehicle Offloading since April 2013. The fee has risen from $50 in 2016 to $60 in 2017 to $95 in 2023.

=== Lorton Terminal ===

Lorton, Virginia, is about a half-hour drive south of Washington, D.C., near Interstate 95 in Northern Virginia. Amtrak&#x27;s new Lorton terminal opened in early 2000 as a replacement for the original station built during the 1970s, and features a large, modern waiting area with high glass walls. The station was designed by architect Hanny Hassan. The suspended sculpture in the lobby was designed by Patrick Sheridan. The platform is long.

Lorton was selected as site of the northern terminal because the high autoracks were too tall to pass through the First Street Tunnel into Washington, D.C.

=== Sanford Terminal ===

Sanford, Florida, is the southern terminus and is about a half-hour drive north of Orlando. The original facility was older and smaller than the terminal at Lorton. At Sanford, the &quot;Auto Train&quot; loads passengers on two tracks, as no one track is long enough to accommodate all the passenger railcars. Sanford&#x27;s operation is unique in that a railroad crossing runs through the middle of the rail yard. This complicates some switching procedures and also requires a three-man yard conductor crew – conductor, assistant conductor, and a utility conductor – while operations at Lorton require only a conductor and assistant conductor. Both yards operate with one engineer. Sanford serves as the main mechanical and maintenance location for &quot;Auto Train&quot;, with diesel and car shops to service the fleet. The city of Sanford provides a shuttle bus to the historic district departing every 20 minutes between 1:00 pm and 3:00 pm free of charge on all days except Sundays and certain major holidays.

=== Consist ===
The &quot;Auto Train&quot; uses Amtrak’s bi-level Superliner equipment, which is used for trains in the western United States and cannot pass through Baltimore Penn Station or the North River Tunnels for access to New York Penn Station. A typical consist includes two GE Genesis locomotives in the front or one GE Genesis and one ALC-42, a transition sleeper car, three sleeping cars, a sightseer lounge car, a full-service dining car, five sleepers, a cafe dining car, four coaches, and up to 34 autoracks. 

Superliner sleeping cars have deluxe bedrooms on the upper level, roomettes on the upper and lower levels, one &quot;family bedroom&quot;, and one &quot;accessible bedroom&quot;. Coach cars have reclining seats on both levels. The &quot;Sightseer Lounge&quot; car has wrap-around windows on the upper level and an informal café on the lower. One dining and lounge car is reserved for sleeping car customers, while another also serves coach passengers.

Amtrak calls the &quot;Auto Train,&quot; whose total length is roughly , the longest passenger train in the world.

<doc id="1164521" wikidata="Q7777762" url="?curid=1164521" title="Theft of services">
<text>Theft of services is the legal term for a crime which is committed when a person obtains valuable services — as opposed to goods — by deception, force, threat or other unlawful means, i.e., without lawfully compensating the provider for these services. It may also overlap with some types of fraud in which payment is made on credit, but under an assumed identity, and ultimately disavowed (&quot;identity theft&quot;).

==Types==
Crimes of this sort are typically prosecuted as larceny, and may be either a misdemeanor or a felony, based upon the value of the services illegally obtained. This category encompasses a wide variety of criminal activity including tampering with (or bypassing) a utility meter so that the true level of consumption is understated, leaving a hotel or restaurant or similar establishment without paying for the service and &quot;turnstile jumping&quot; or other methods of evading the payment of a fare or fee when using a public transit vehicle or entering a private facility normally requiring payment (e.g., jumping over the fence at a fair or concert). Theft of services also occurs in the taxi industry, when a passenger in a taxi flees from the taxi to avoid paying the fee. Another common form is using another entity&#x27;s dumpster without their permission, as this creates an expense to the party paying for the service. 

Theft of this sort should not be confused with reasonable rejection, where, for example, a customer does not pay because the services provided were not as advertised or because the services did not meet reasonable standards of quality. For example, if a roofer installs a new roof, but the roof leaks, the customer might be able to withhold payment until the leak has been fixed. Withholding of payment without reason would be considered larceny.

These statutes have also, on occasion, been applied in the realm of health care, when hospitals or other health care providers have pressed criminal charges against indigent, uninsured patients who were unable to pay for their treatment. This scenario has prompted intense criticism, and is a key issue in the call for a major overhaul of the health care system in the United States.

<doc id="1164523" wikidata="Q290222" url="?curid=1164523" title="Kayano Shigeru">
<text>was a Japanese politician and a leading figure in the Ainu ethnic movement in Japan. He was one of the last speakers of the Ainu language.

== Early life ==
Kayano was born in Nibutani village in Biratori, Hokkaidō, Japan. His family name at birth was Kaizawa, but he was adopted out by name to his aunt&#x27;s family. He was raised in poverty by his alcoholic father and devout Buddhist mother, and gained his first appreciation of Ainu culture from his grandmother, Tekatte, who would share traditional stories in Ainu with him.

== Cultural leader ==
Though he did not reach a high level of formal education, he undertook an impassioned study of Ainu folklore, art, language and history. His activism helped bring about the founding of the Nibutani Ainu Culture Museum in 1972. He was an acknowledged living master of the Ainu oral tradition, an expert in its folk arts and language. He led the effort to found 15 Ainu language schools.

== Political leader ==
He was the first Ainu politician to sit in the Diet of Japan. He served five terms in the assembly before taking over a vacated seat in the upper house for the SDP. There he served from 1994 to 1998. In the Diet, he often posed questions in the Ainu language. His effort led to the enactment of a law to promote Ainu culture in 1997.

Kayano Shigeru was also known for leading the protest movement against the Nibutani Dam. The dam over the Saru River, completed in 1997 despite legal attempts to stop it, flooded land sacred to the Ainu. Though unsuccessful, the legal effort did result in a ruling by the Sapporo District Court, acknowledging the Ainu as the indigenous people of Hokkaidō for the first time. He also succeeded in his quest for abolition of The Protective Act for the Ainus in Hokkaido () and enacting the Act for the Promotion of Ainu Culture &amp; Dissemination of Knowledge Regarding Ainu Traditions in 1997.

He died of pneumonia at a hospital in Sapporo, Hokkaidō on May 6, 2006, just over a month short of his 80th birthday.

== Works ==
Kayano Shigeru has written about 100 books about the Ainu language and culture, including 28 yukar collections. Some of his works were translated into English:
* &quot;The Ainu and the Fox&quot; – 2006
* &quot;The Ainu: A Story of Japan&#x27;s Original People&quot; – 2004
* &quot;Our Land was a Forest: an Ainu Memoir&quot; – 1994
* &quot;Yukar, the Ainu Epic and Folktales&quot; – 1988
* &quot;The Romance of the Bear God&quot; – 1985

<text>Sir Michael Jonathan Moritz (born 12 September 1954) is a Welsh-born American billionaire venture capitalist, philanthropist, author, and former journalist. Moritz works for Sequoia Capital, wrote the first history of Apple Inc., &quot;The Little Kingdom&quot;, and authored &quot;Going for Broke: Lee Iacocca&#x27;s Battle to Save Chrysler&quot;. Previously, Moritz was a staff writer at &quot;Time&quot; magazine and a member of the board of directors of Google. He studied at the University of Oxford and the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and went on to found Technologic Partners before becoming a venture capitalist in the 1980s. Moritz was named as the No. 1 venture capitalist on the &quot;Forbes&quot; Midas List in 2006 and 2007.

==Early life and education==
Michael Jonathan Moritz was born to a Jewish family in Cardiff, Wales, on 12 September 1954. His father, Ludwig Alfred Moritz (1921–2003), was a Jew who fled Nazi Germany. A professor of Classics at Cardiff University, in the 1970s, he became its Vice Principal (Administration). His mother, Doris (née Rath; 1924–2019), also fled Nazi Germany. Moritz attended Howardian High School in Cardiff.

Moritz earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in history at Christ Church, Oxford, and in 1978, an MBA from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania as a Thouron scholar.

==Career==

===Journalist===
Moritz first worked for many years as a journalist. In the early 1980s, when he was a reporter for &quot;Time&quot;, Steve Jobs contracted him to document the development of the Mac for a book he was writing about Apple. According to Andy Hertzfeld, in response to the fact that a history of another computer company had been published a year earlier, Jobs said: &quot;Mike&#x27;s going to be our historian.&quot; As he was close in age to many on the development team, he seemed to be a good choice.

By late 1982, Moritz was &quot;Time&quot;″s San Francisco Bureau Chief and working on the special Time Person of the Year issue, which was initially supposed to be about Jobs. His research included a lengthy interview with Jobs&#x27; high school girlfriend, Chrisann Brennan, in which she discussed the history of their child, Lisa. Moritz&#x27;s follow-up interview with Jobs on the subject led to denial of paternity on his part. The issue also contained negative commentary on Jobs from other Apple employees. The special issue was renamed &quot;Machine of the Year&quot; prior to publication, celebrated &quot;The Computer&quot; and declared that &quot;it would have been possible to single out as Man of the Year one of the engineers or entrepreneurs who masterminded this technological revolution, but no one person has clearly dominated those turbulent events. More important, such a selection would obscure the main point. TIME&#x27;s Man of the Year for 1982, the greatest influence for good or evil, is not a man at all. It is a machine: the computer.&quot; Jobs cut off all ties with Moritz after the issue was published and threatened to fire anyone who communicated with him. According to Hertzfeld, &quot;some of us talked with Mike again surreptitiously, as he was putting the finishing touches on his book around the time of the Mac introduction&quot; and the resulting text, &quot;The Little Kingdom: the Private Story of Apple Computer&quot;, &quot;remains one of the best books about Apple Computer ever written&quot;.

In 2009, 25 years after &quot;The Little Kingdom&quot;, Moritz published a revised and expanded follow-up: &quot;Return to the Little Kingdom: How Apple and Steve Jobs Changed the World&quot;. In the prologue to &quot;Return to the Little Kingdom&quot;, Moritz states that he was as incensed as Jobs was about the &quot;Time Magazine&quot; special issue:
Steve rightly took umbrage over his portrayal and what he saw as a grotesque betrayal of confidences, while I was equally distraught by the way in which material I had arduously gathered for a book about Apple was siphoned, filtered, and poisoned with a gossipy benzene by an editor in New York whose regular task was to chronicle the wayward world of rock-and-roll music. Steve made no secret of his anger and left a torrent of messages on the answering machine I kept in my converted earthquake cottage at the foot of San Francisco’s Potrero Hill. He, understandably, banished me from Apple and forbade anyone in his orbit to talk to me. The experience made me decide that I would never again work anywhere I could not exert a large amount of control over my own destiny or where I would be paid by the word. I finished my leave [and] published my book, &quot;The Little Kingdom: The Private Story of Apple Computer&quot;, which I felt, unlike the unfortunate magazine article, presented a balanced portrait of the young Steve Jobs.In 2015, Moritz collaborated with Alex Ferguson on his book, &quot;Leading: Learning from Life and My Years at Manchester United&quot;, which draws on Ferguson’s experience as a football manager, and provides lessons on achieving business and life success.

===Venture capitalist===
In 1986, Moritz joined Sequoia Capital after co-authoring &quot;Going for Broke: The Chrysler Story&quot; with Barrett Seaman, &quot;Time&quot;″s Detroit bureau chief. After leaving &quot;Time&quot;, Moritz co-founded Technologic Partners, a technology newsletter and conference company.

His internet company investments include Google, Yahoo!, Skyscanner, PayPal, Webvan, YouTube, eToys, and Zappos. He currently sits on the boards of 24/7 Customer, Earth Networks, Gamefly, HealthCentral, Green Dot Corporation, Klarna, Kayak.com, LinkedIn, Stripe and PopSugar. Moritz previously served on the boards of A123 Systems, Aricent Group, Atom Entertainment, CenterRun, eGroups, Flextronics, Google, ITA Software, Luxim, PayPal, Plaxo, Pure Digital, Saba Software, Yahoo!, and Zappos. Google was one of several co-investments with John Doerr of rival venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, and the initial public offering of the company in 2004 made Moritz one of Wales&#x27; richest men. His investment in Google helped him achieve the number-one listing in &quot;Forbes&quot;″ &quot;Midas List&quot; of the top dealmakers in the technology industry in 2006 and 2007, and a place on the 2007 &quot;TIME 100&quot;. He ranked number two on the Midas List for 2008 and 2009.

In July 2023, Moritz stepped down from Sequoia after nearly four decades. He remains on the boards of Stripe, Klarna and Instacart, but Sequoia said that those seats would be replaced over time. Moritz announced that he would focus on Sequoia Heritage—a wealth-management fund that he helped launch, now independent of Sequoia Capital.

===&quot;San Francisco Standard&quot;===
&quot;The San Francisco Standard&quot; is a for-profit San Francisco-centric news web site, funded by Michael Moritz, with offices in the Mission District, using Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube. Griffin Gaffney is the CEO of the &quot;SF Standard&quot; as well as co-founder of &quot;Here/Say Media&quot; and &quot;TogetherSF&quot;, Moritz-funded 501(c)4 organizations.&lt;ref name=&quot;vox.com/recode-crankstart&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Griffin Gaffney is also a co-founder of &quot;PossibleSF&quot;.

==Honours==
In July 2010, Moritz was awarded an honorary fellowship from Cardiff University, where his father Alfred had previously been Vice-Principal and Professor of Classics.

In July 2014 he was honoured as a fellow of Aberystwyth University.

In November 2014, Moritz was awarded an honorary doctorate from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

Moritz was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 2013 Birthday Honours for services to promoting British economic interests and philanthropic work.

==Personal life==
Moritz lives in San Francisco with his wife, American novelist Harriet Heyman, and their two children. 

In May 2012, Moritz announced that he had been diagnosed with a rare, incurable medical condition and would step back from his day-to-day responsibilities at Sequoia Capital while also being elevated to the position of chairman.

==Philanthropy and political involvement==
Moritz is a signatory of The Giving Pledge, committing himself to give away at least 50% of his wealth to charitable causes.

In June 2008, Moritz and his wife announced a donation of US$50 million to Christ Church, his Oxford college, the largest single donation in the college&#x27;s history.

In July 2012, it was announced that Moritz had donated £75m to Oxford University to provide £11,000 scholarships to students from families with an annual income below £16,000. The donation is the largest financial donation to an undergraduate university in European history.

In February 2013 he gave $5 million for Juilliard School&#x27;s Music Advancement Program.

In September 2013 he and his wife gave $30 million to the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) to create the UCSF Discovery Fellows Program, the largest endowed programme for PhD students in the history of the University of California; UCSF will raise $30 million in matching funds.

In February 2016 he and his wife gave $50 million to the University of Chicago (UC), benefiting the Odyssey programme, which supports lower-income students with outstanding potential; UC will raise $50 million in matching funds.

In October 2016, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that Michael Moritz &quot;donated $49,999 to a divisive ballot measure intended to clear San Francisco’s streets of homeless encampments, according to campaign filings&quot;. Moritz later wrote an Op-Ed for the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; opposing a homelessness funding measure.

In May 2018, Moritz donated $20 million to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the largest donation the organization has received.

He donated to the Lincoln Project, a Republican-led super PAC opposing the re-election of Donald Trump and Republican Senators who supported him. SFGate notes that he also donated $336 million into various political and social causes in San Francisco over three years. These causes include organizations such as SF Parent Action, which, in 2022, advocated for a recall of members of the city’s school board, and also TogetherSF Action, which is known for ads critical of San Francisco&#x27;s drug policies that appeared all over the city in May 2023. 

In 2024 Moritz and TogetherSF backed the mayoral campaign of Mark Farrell.
===Crankstart===
In 2019, it was announced that his and his wife&#x27;s charity Crankstart would be sponsoring the Booker Prize for novelists for the next five years. The couple did not want the name of their charity to be attached to the prize, which subsequently reverted to its old name of the Booker Prize.

<doc id="1164533" wikidata="Q1192621" url="?curid=1164533" title="Lake Rotorua">
<text>Lake Rotorua () is the second largest lake in the North Island of New Zealand by surface area, and covers 79.8 km2. 
With a mean depth of only 10 metres it is considerably smaller than nearby Lake Tarawera in terms of volume of water. It is located within the Rotorua Caldera in the Bay of Plenty Region.

== Geography==
Lake Rotorua is fed with water from a number of rivers and streams; some such as the Utuhina flow with a water 
temperature warmer than the lake due to the thermal activity in the Rotorua area. Conversely streams on the northern shore such as the Hamurana Spring and the Awahou stream flow crystal clear water that has a constant temperature of 10 degrees Celsius. Other notable tributaries include the Ngongotahā stream, famous for trout fishing. Lake Rotorua flows directly into Lake Rotoiti via the Ohau Channel at the north eastern corner of the lake. The urban development of Rotorua extends along the south portion of the lake shore.

=== Geology ===

The lake was formed from the crater of a large volcano in the Taupō Volcanic Zone. Its last major eruption was about 240,000 years ago. After the eruption, the magma chamber underneath the volcano collapsed. The circular depression left behind is the Rotorua Caldera, which is the site of the lake. 


The lake as shown in Figure 1, has had periods at multiple different lake levels since the caldera&#x27;s Mamaku ignimbrite eruption, related to both volcanic activity and subsidence within the Taupō Rift. The lake all-time high occurred sometime after the formation of the Ngongotahā Dome which records this on its flanks, and is now dated at 200,000 years. Previously this dome&#x27;s eruption was assigned much closer to the time of the Mamaku ignimbrite eruption, so the lake maximum high stand was assumed to be more directly related to the caldera&#x27;s formation. Breakout floods are suspected through the Hemo Gorge after the lake&#x27;s maximum high stand, definitely after the Rotoiti eruption of the Ōkataina Caldera, with formation of a channel within the western lake floor of Lake Rotoiti and suspected after the Hauparu eruption through the Kaituna River Gorge. Several other lakes of volcanic origin are located nearby to the east, around the base of the active volcano Mount Tarawera and these also over time have varied in size or existence due to volcanic action.

Mokoia Island, close to the centre of the lake, is a much later rhyolite dome compared to Ngongotahā. It is probably New Zealand&#x27;s best-known lake island, and is closely associated with one of the best-known Māori legends, that of Hinemoa and Tutanekai. Is said that Hinemoa swam across the lake to her lover Tutanekai who lived on Mokoia Island.

Owing to the geothermal activity around the lake (including still active geysers and hot mud pools), the lake has a high sulphur content. This gives the lake&#x27;s waters an unusual yellowish-green hue.

=== Mapping of lake floor ===
In 2024, maps of the lake floor were published, showing the results of surveys carried out in 2016 and 2017. The maps reveal the course of an ancient river, now submerged, and thousands of pockmarks that probably result from the emission of gas from decomposition of organic material beneath the lake floor. The surveys also revealed significant geothermal activity extending around into the lake from Sulphur Point.

== Tourist attraction ==

Despite the large volume of water flowing through Lake Rotorua its shallow depth makes it very prone to discolouration, especially from sediment following windy weather. It is well used by fishermen, but less popular with watersports participants and swimmers.

The Ohau Channel is navigable by boat and is also favoured by fly fishermen. The Ohau channel joins at the Mourea delta, an area with very low water levels. This area is frequented by novice kayakers and swimmers. Nearby is the ancestral land of the Ngāti Pikiao hapū of the Te Arawa tribe. From Lake Rotoiti the waters of Lake Rotorua flow to the Kaituna River into the Pacific Ocean near Maketu; the rapid descent from over 900 feet above sea level in less than 20 km has created an area used for extreme kayaking and white water rafting.

<doc id="1164534" wikidata="Q73286" url="?curid=1164534" title="Ernst Dieffenbach">
<text>Johann Karl Ernst Dieffenbach (27 January 1811 – 1 October 1855), also known as Ernest Dieffenbach, was a German physician, geologist and naturalist, the first trained scientist to live and work in New Zealand, where he travelled widely under the auspices of the New Zealand Company, returning in 1841–42 and publishing in English his &quot;Travels in New Zealand&quot; in 1843.

Dieffenbach was born in Giessen. He gained a degree at the university of Giessen and then, accused by authorities in the Grand Duchy of Hesse of being subversive, he fled, first to Zurich, where he received a degree in medicine before being expelled in 1836 for politics and duelling; in 1837 he arrived in London, where he eked out a living teaching German, but gained a reputation by his contributions to medical and scientific journals and made friendships with geologists Charles Lyell and Richard Owen among others. Recommendations put him aboard the &quot;Tory&quot; bound for New Zealand, travelling in the capacity of surgeon, surveyor and naturalist.

During the 1840s he was a correspondent of Charles Darwin, whose &quot;Journal of Researches&quot; Dieffenbach translated into German and published, with Darwin&#x27;s notes and corrections, as &quot;Naturwissenschaftliche Reisen&quot; (Brunswick, 1853). Darwin knew Dieffenbach&#x27;s paper on the Chatham Islands, contributed to the journal of the Royal Geographical Society, and he particularly noted Dieffenbach&#x27;s commentary on the differences between the species of birds there and in New Zealand. Dieffenbach also translated the &quot;Geological Manual&quot; of Henry De la Beche. Partly as a result of these efforts, in 1850 he was named adjunct professor of geology at Giessen, a post he held until his death there.

The extinct Dieffenbach&#x27;s rail (&quot;Gallirallus dieffenbachii&quot;) a flightless rail formerly endemic to the Chatham Islands, was named after him. (The plant genus &quot;Dieffenbachia&quot; was named after the head gardener of the Botanical Gardens in Vienna, Joseph Dieffenbach (1796–1863).

== Travels in New Zealand ==

Ernst Dieffenbach was one of the first Europeans to visit the Rotomahana area in New Zealand. He visited Rotomahana and the Pink and White Terraces while on a mission for the New Zealand Company. Dieffenbach and his assistant Symonds travelled from New Plymouth via Mount Egmont (Taranaki) and Ruapehu and then around the shores of Lake Taupō. They then travelled north, partly following the Waikato River then east towards Kakaramea (Rainbow Mountain), reaching Rotomahana Lake late one evening. They camped overnight at the mouth of the Haumi Stream.

He inspired wider interest in the Pink and White Terraces with his publications. When he had completed his short stay at Rotomahana, they continued north via Lake Tarawera and the Te Ngae Mission Station to Rotorua. Dieffenbach was employed by the New Zealand Company for this excursion, and also traveled extensively throughout the North Island, making notes on flora and fauna, which can be seen in his biography at the Alexander Turnbull Library.

When Dieffenbach completed his employment by the New Zealand Company he was forced to leave the country. His studies in the North Island were completed after he left New Zealand. When he attempted to re-enter New Zealand to continue his studies in the South Island he was refused entry.
