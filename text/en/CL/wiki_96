<text>Blue Lightning is a 1989 combat flight simulation video game developed by Epyx and published by Atari Corporation in North America and Europe for the Atari Lynx. It was also released in Japan on December 1 of the same year, where it was instead distributed by Mumin Corporation. It was one of the launch titles that were released along with the system in North America and was jointly written by Stephen Landrum, lead programmer Brian Bowhay, who also developed the Lynx hardware and &quot;Chip&#x27;s Challenge&quot; creator Chuck Sommerville.

Assuming the role of a chosen rookie aircraft pilot from the United States Air Force by the Flight Command squadron, the player takes control of the titular prototype fighter aircraft in a desperate attempt of The Pentagon to penetrate multiple enemy territories and aid the allies in order to win the war against the enemies. Conceived as a commission to create a pseudo-3D combat flight game by Landrum and graphic artist Arthur Koch, &quot;Blue Lightning&quot; was heavily inspired by Sega&#x27;s 1987 Super Scaler arcade game &quot;After Burner&quot;, in addition of also bearing similarity with the feature film and TV series &quot;Blue Thunder&quot;.

Upon its release, &quot;Blue Lightning&quot; was well received by critics who praised the visuals, gameplay and for being a showcase of the capabilities of the Lynx, although some criticized the lack of in-game music and repetitive nature of the missions, with many also comparing it with &quot;After Burner&quot;. In 1995, a remake developed by Attention to Detail, was released as one of the pack-in games for the Atari Jaguar CD peripheral when it launched and received mixed reviews.

== Gameplay ==

&quot;Blue Lightning&quot; is an arcade-style combat flight simulation game that is played from a third-person perspective similar to &quot;After Burner&quot;, where the player take the role of a fighter pilot with one main objective; to enter into enemy territory and aid the allies in defeating the enemies to claim victory of the war by completing a series of nine missions, each one taking place in various locations and tasking the player with different assignments, while increasing in difficulty as the game progress further. The game grants the player with a fleet of six Blue Lightning planes, which act as lives and if the current plane is crashed or destroyed, the mission must be restarted from the beginning and the game is over once all lives are lost. The plane also comes equipped with a limited number of missiles to use against enemies but once they run out, the player must rely upon its machine gun to destroy enemy planes.

== Development and release ==

&quot;Blue Lightning&quot; was conceived by Arthur Koch and Stephen Landrum as part of a commission to design a pseudo-3D combat flight title for the then-upcoming Handy handheld game console, which would be later rechristened as the Atari Lynx. During their free time, the team would visit local arcades as sources of inspirations for their upcoming projects, among them being Sega&#x27;s &quot;After Burner&quot;, which served as a basis for their combat flight game and although Landrum was initially influenced by Spectrum HoloByte&#x27;s &quot;Falcon&quot;, Koch lean towards a more arcade-style approach rather than a full simulation one. Koch stated that Landrum&#x27;s first idea for the project was of a first-person shooter, with the action being viewed on a first-person perspective inside of the plane&#x27;s cockpit, however he created all the views to be animated at a third-person angle and as a result, Landrum scaled down all of the assets in order to fit within the memory constrains and make it a third-person shooter instead.

Once design of the project was finalized, programmer Chuck Sommerville came up with the title after writing it on a paper, which was likely inspired by the film and TV series &quot;Blue Thunder&quot;, and gave it to designer RJ Mical, who liked the name. Koch recounted positively about the development process of the title and working with the hardware, stating he and Landrum had a lot of freedom to develop the game they wanted with the available technology, however he also stated that the Lynx&#x27;s limited screen resolution proved to be a source of difficulty for the team.

&quot;Blue Lightning&quot; makes heavy use of several features found within the Lynx hardware such as sprite scaling and rotation, with Sommerville developing an animation engine for the introductory sequence of the game, which would later be re-used on other titles for the system such as &quot;Electrocop&quot; and &quot;Todd&#x27;s Adventures in Slime World&quot;. Sommerville stated the game violated a rule of the system imposed by Mical and co-designer Dave Needle, which involved not accessing the ROM image once a game was running, as it streamed data for assets directly from the ROM and this technique would also be re-used in &quot;Zarlor Mercenary&quot;.

&quot;Blue Lightning&quot; was one of the original launch titles during the initial release of the Lynx in 1989, along with &quot;California Games&quot;, the aforementioned &quot;Electrocop&quot; and &quot;Gates of Zendocon&quot;. It was also released in Europe around the same time period and later in Japan on December 1 of the same year, where it was distributed by Mumin Corporation instead and the difference between the international and Japanese releases is that the latter came bundled with an instruction manual in Japanese. The game was first showcased to the public during the International Summer Consumer Electronics Show 1989, along with the system. Early previews showcased a different GUI.

== Reception ==
&quot;Blue Lightning&quot; garnered positive reception. In a capsule review of the Lynx version for &quot;STart&quot;, Clayton Walnum commented, &quot;The 3D perspective is dazzling, with missiles and jets coming at you with such realism, you want to duck. ... The Lynx&#x27;s built-in scaling features are used to the max in &quot;Blue Lightning&quot;. Luckily, the gameplay is as good as the graphics, making this a must-have game for every Lynx owner.&quot;

In a 1999 retrospective, Robert A Jung reviewed the Atari Lynx version of the game for IGN, stating in his verdict that, &quot;Though the levels could use a little more variety, the user-friendly gameplay and the sensational graphics make this title a blue-ribbon winner.&quot;

== Legacy ==
In 1993, Atari requested several Epyx titles in order to be converted and release to the then-upcoming Atari Jaguar, with &quot;Blue Lightning&quot; among the list of selected titles to be remade. A year later, &quot;Blue Lightning 2&quot; was announced for the Jaguar CD and became one of the first titles announced for the then-upcoming add-on, however it was later retitled to its original name during Autumn ECTS &#x27;94, where it was revealed that &quot;Cybermorph&quot; developer Attention to Detail were the ones developing the project. It became one of the two pack-in games for the peripheral when it launched on September 21, 1995, and was met with divisive reception from the public.

<text>Henry W. Coe State Park (often known simply as Henry Coe or Coe Park) is a state park of California, United States, preserving a vast tract of the Diablo Range. The park is located closest to the city of Morgan Hill, and is located in both Santa Clara and Stanislaus counties. The park contains over , making it the largest state park in northern California, and the second-largest in the state (after Anza-Borrego Desert State Park). Managed within its boundaries is a designated wilderness area of about . This is officially known as the Henry W. Coe State Wilderness, but locally as the Orestimba Wilderness. The park was established in 1959.

== History ==
Prior to its use as ranch land, the Diablo Range backcountry now covered by Henry W. Coe State Park was traversed by La Vereda del Monte, a trail between Point of Timber on the Sacramento River Delta and Cantua Creek in the San Joaquin Valley. Joaquin Murrieta and his gang used the route to drive wild or stolen horses south from Contra Costa County, picking up more from stations along the way, passing into the area of the park from the San Antonio Valley via a trail that closely followed the route of County Line Road along the divide of the Diablo Range. Horses were held at several locations now contained within the park, including Valle Atravesado (now flooded by Mississippi Lake), Valle Hondo, site of Pacheco Camp, Paradise Flat and Mustang Flat. Both Mustang Peak and Mustang Flat derive their names from the activities of Murrieta and his gang. Mustang Peak is where the horses held at Paradise Flat or Mustang Flat were fed into a passing drove.

The park began as the Pine Ridge Ranch, a private cattle ranch of . It was the home of Henry Willard Coe, Jr. and his family from 1905 until his death in 1943. Coe left the ranch to his son, Henry Sutcliffe Coe, who sold it to the Beach Land and Cattle Company of Fresno County in 1948. The ranch&#x27;s road network was greatly expanded during this time. Coe&#x27;s daughter, Sada Sutcliffe Coe Robinson, re-purchased the ranch in 1950 and donated it to Santa Clara County in 1953, when it became Henry Willard Coe County Park. It became a state park in 1958. Additional adjacent lands were added, and for many years, the park&#x27;s size stood at . Indeed, many currently available state road maps still show the park in its 13,000 acre configuration. The park expanded considerably in the early 1980s with the purchase of adjacent properties to the east and south (the Gill-Mustang and Coit ranches, respectively), bringing the size to ). In the early 1990s the Redfern Ranch added some in the south, and since 2000 lands to the west have been purchased for inclusion. The park is still growing.

The northern part of the park, including the Orestimba Wilderness, was swept by a massive wildfire starting on September 3, 2007. Named the Lick Fire after it was first spotted by nearby Lick Observatory, the fire grew to by the evening of September 6, and ultimately burned by the time it was contained on September 11. Fire officials blamed the fire on burning debris within a barrel at a hunting club adjacent to the park. The person responsible for the fire came forward, pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge, and was ultimately ordered to pay $750,000 in restitution. All areas affected by the fire were re-opened to unrestricted public access on February 16, 2008.

== Geography ==
Located in the Diablo Range backcountry east of Morgan Hill, CA - between the San Antonio Valley (north) and Pacheco Pass (south), the park consists of a series of high ridges separated by steep walled canyons, with occasional level valley bottoms and distinct peaks. Most of the ridges run around in elevation, with canyon bottoms usually around above sea level.

The highest point in the park is on the northernmost boundary, at about elevation. This point may be considered to be on the slopes of Mt. Stakes, a mile north of the park&#x27;s northern boundary. (Mt. Stakes, at , is the highest point in Stanislaus County). The lowest point in the park is at the Bell Station access point in the southeast; this is only a little above in elevation. Since this is a mere strip of land along a road right-of-way, it is often not thought of as an integral part of the state park. The lowest point in the main body of the park is the place where the North Fork of Pacheco Creek flows out, at about elevation, also in the southeast corner.

Prominent ridges and peaks in the park, from west to east and north to south, include Pine Ridge, Middle Ridge, Blue Ridge (with Mount Sizer the highest point), Rock House Ridge, Bear Mountain, Bear Mountain Peak, Robison Mountain (not Robinson Mountain as it is too often misspelled), Rooster Comb, Palassou Ridge, Mahoney Ridge (and Mahoney Meadows), Willow Ridge, Pacheco Ridge, Mustang Peak, Walsh Peak, Willson Field Hill, Wasno Ridge, Burra Burra Peak, Willson Peak, Rock Springs Peak, and Phegley Ridge. The park is divided into 13 zones on the official map. From West to East, and North to South, they are: 
#Western Zone (Park HQ)
#Blue Ridge Zone (Mt Sizer, Hat Rock)
#Interior Zone (Bear Mountain)
#Mississippi Zone
#Orestimba Wilderness Zone
#Mustang Peak Zone
#Mahoney Zone
#Coit Zone
#Pacheco Zone (Dowdy Ranch Entrance)
#Grizzly Gulch Zone
#Kelly Zone
#Dormida Zone
#Phegley Zone (Bill&#x27;s Hill, Redfern Pond)

The park map also shows 1) Thomas Addition (near Mt. Sizer) and 2) Lakeview Addition (just below the park&#x27;s HQ) to which there is no public access as of now (late 2013), nor any plans yet to make those areas accessible to public.

The area encompasses parts of three major watersheds: Coyote Creek, Orestimba Creek, and Pacheco Creek. Coyote Creek is fed by Grizzly Creek, the Little, Middle, and East Forks of Coyote Creek, Kelly Cabin Canyon, Grizzly Gulch (not be confused with Grizzly Creek), and Hunting Hollow. Coyote Creek flows into Coyote Lake and Anderson Lake, and then north through San Jose into the San Francisco Bay. The South Fork Orestimba Creek originates in the park, and is fed by Red Creek, Pinto and Robinson creeks, and Lion Canyon. After joining the North Fork outside the park, it flows out to the San Joaquin Valley, where it joins the San Joaquin River. The latter runs more or less north and, if it were not diverted, would flow out to San Pablo Bay. The North Fork Pacheco Creek also originates within the park, and it is fed by Mississippi Creek. Cañada de la Dormida independently reaches Pacheco Creek outside of the park boundaries. If not diverted, the waters of Pacheco Creek would eventually reach Monterey Bay via the Pajaro River. There is a fourth, minor watershed within the park: the small creeks of the Upper San Antonio Valley in the north flow into San Antonio Creek north of the park. This, in turn, joins Arroyo Valle, which flows into Alameda Creek, then flows into San Francisco Bay west of the city of Fremont.

The creeks are all seasonal; none of them flow year-round, though all have holes in which water may be found during all seasons. Depending on rainfall and temperatures, the creeks generally flow from November to May. After heavy rainfall, the creeks can become impassable, raging torrents, though usually they are not difficult to ford if one does not mind getting wet or (in winter and early spring) cold.

The park contains dozens of reservoirs created by the former ranch owners for watering cattle and for recreational fishing and hunting. The largest is Mississippi Lake, at about and long. Other notables are Coit, Kelly, Jackrabbit, and Paradise lakes.
==Ecology==
The park protects part of the California interior chaparral and woodlands ecoregion. Large parts of the park are covered in chaparral and oak woodlands.

=== Plant life ===

Besides its size, the park is notable for a mostly intact flora. Unlike many other Bay Area parks, there are no large stands of non-native trees or shrubs. There are forested ridge-tops and slopes interspersed with chaparral and grasslands, with some creeks supporting distinct riparian vegetation.

Native trees which dominate the park include valley oak (&quot;Quercus lobata&quot;), blue oak (&quot;Q. douglasii&quot;), coast live oak (&quot;Q. agrifolia&quot;), canyon live oak (&quot;Q. chrysolepis&quot;), interior live oak (&quot;Q. wislizenii&quot;), gray pine (&quot;Pinus sabiniana&quot;), ponderosa pine (&quot;P. ponderosa&quot;), Pacific madrone (&quot;Arbutus menziesii&quot;), California laurel (&quot;Umbellularia californica&quot;), California buckeye (&quot;Aesculus californica&quot;), white alder (&quot;Alnus rhombifolia&quot;), California juniper (&quot;Juniperus californica&quot;), blue elderberry (&quot;Sambucus mexicana&quot;) and California sycamore (&quot;Platanus racemosa&quot;). Big-berry Manzanita (&quot;Arctostaphylos glauca&quot;) reach remarkable size within the park (over 20 feet (6 m) tall) and can grow as either small trees or large shrubs. Other prominent shrubs and wildflowers include chamise (&quot;Adenostoma fasciculatum&quot;), toyon (&quot;Heteromeles arbutifolia&quot;), coyote brush (&quot;Baccharis pilularis&quot;), California sagebrush (&quot;Artemisia californica&quot;), eastwood manzanita (&quot;Arctostaphylos glandulosa&quot;), yerba santa (&quot;Eriodictyon californicum&quot;), buckbrush (&quot;Ceanothus cuneatus&quot;), California gooseberry (&quot;Ribes californicum&quot;), fuchsia-flowered gooseberry (&quot;Ribes speciosum&quot;), yellow mariposa lily (&quot;Calochortus luteus&quot;) and mountain mahogany (&quot;Cercocarpus betuloides&quot;).

Of the trees, blue oak is the most common and widespread. It is most noticeable in the eastern side of the park, where it often forms pure stands. In other areas it may be dominated by other trees, but if the habitat will support trees, blue oak is usually there. Gray pine is also almost ubiquitous throughout, but curiously, is absent in much of the far southwestern portion, perhaps because of the influence of summer fog, rare elsewhere.

Ponderosa pines dominate parts of three ridges in the west: Pine, Middle, and Blue, usually crowning the summits, but often extending down into cooler canyon slopes. They are rarely very dense, and visitors accustomed to seeing ponderosa pine forests in the Sierra Nevada may come to two opposite, and fallacious, conclusions: 1) That the pines were logged, and all we see left is a small percentage of survivors; or 2) that they were all planted. In reality, there is no evidence (stumps, historical accounts) that any significant logging took place, nor does the relatively wide extent of the stands and the great variety of age groups support a tree-planting theory. Most likely, the pines are relicts of a broader distribution during cooler climates. When the climate warmed, the only places the trees could survive were up on the high cooler ridges and shady slopes where they grow today.

Chamise is undoubtedly the most abundant shrub in Coe Park, covering acres of hot, dry slopes and poor soils.

=== Animal life ===
Wildlife in the park is abundant. Large mammals making their home within Coe include blacktailed deer, tule elk, non-native wild pig, coyote, bobcat, and mountain lion (a.k.a. cougar, puma). Smaller mammals include raccoon, gray fox, striped skunk, Beechey ground squirrel, black-tailed jackrabbit, badger, and brush rabbit. About 170 species of birds have been recorded in the park. Among these are: red-tailed hawk, golden eagle, bald eagle, turkey vulture, raven, scrub jay, Steller&#x27;s jay, great horned owl, acorn woodpecker, California quail, western bluebird, and the non-native wild turkey. Common reptiles include western pond turtle, western fence lizard, northern alligator lizard, western skink, coast horned lizard, Pacific gopher snake, California kingsnake, western rattlesnake, ringneck snake, and western aquatic garter snake. Amphibians most seen (or heard) include Pacific tree frog, the non-native bullfrog, and California newt.

Once common, but now extinct in the region, were the California grizzly bear and California condor, although condors have recently flown over the park in 2020.

== Development and facilities ==

The park has few facilities. The most developed area is at Coe Headquarters located at the historic Pine Ridge Ranch. Next to the historic ranch house, there is a visitor center which features exhibits about the old ranch life, a small museum and books store, and a registration/information desk. A 20-unit campground on a nearby open area provides spaces for tents and small recreational vehicles. There is a horse camp at Coe Headquarters, but is limited to a single parking space behind the old ranch house. Two paddocks are available for horses and water for horses can be obtained across the access road. Other structures at Coe Headquarters are a historic wood barn, a metal barn from the 1950s, a garage with attached black smith shop, potable water tanks, and two employee residences. This area is at the end of East Dunne Avenue, about east of downtown Morgan Hill.

Another access point is the Hunting Hollow parking area off Gilroy Hot Springs Road just east of La Canada road. This area is more primitive, with no piped water available and only a chemical toilet. The Hunting Hollow access is best for casual walkers and bikers, as the valley trail is level, without any steep hills to traverse. This is a good access for spring wildflower viewing. Parking is available for equestrian trailers and trucks.

The Coyote Creek entrance is about north on Gilroy Hot Springs Road. This entrance has no parking or facilities. Currently, it can only be used by arranging to be dropped off by car, or by parking at Hunting Hollow and walking up the road. A chemical toilet is available just beyond the locked gate and water is available at Timm Springs.

A fourth access area is the Dowdy Ranch Visitor&#x27;s Center, opened 19 May 2007, with access via the unpaved Kaiser-Aetna Road from Bell Station on State Route 152. This entrance is occasionally open only on summer weekends. Bikers and backpackers can access the park via this road at any time, provided they are willing to hike or ride the seven steep miles to the park boundary. When open, parking is available at Dowdy Ranch visitor center, including overnight. Visitors must leave by Sunday evening or stay until the following Saturday opening. There is excellent parking for equestrians. During the annual Coe Backcountry Weekend event in April, around 300 vehicles are permitted to travel up Kaiser Atena road as far as the Orestimba Corral which is 5 miles beyond the Dowdy Ranch visitors center.

A future entrance is planned to be located in San Antonio Valley in the northernmost part of the park, though it will likely be many years before funds are available to do this.

Many sources of water are found within the park, including seasonal springs and watercourses and old ponds built by the cattle ranchers. The springs and water troughs have been maintained and improved by park volunteers. All surface water in the park should be filtered before drinking to remove harmful organisms.

The state has replaced the many crude pit toilets with clean well-maintained toilet structures known by the volunteers as &quot;Taj MaPotties&quot;. They are wheelchair-friendly, but the trails to them are not.

== Recreation ==

Most visitors at Coe Park hike or mountain bike on the numerous trails within the park. There are about of dirt roads and trails in the park. Some of the dirt roads are wide and designed well, some are narrow and rutted, and some are so overgrown as to be easily missed. Recently constructed single-track trails are usually maintained, and, in general, the closer one is to Coe Headquarters, the more such trails there are. More remote trails are often just old jeep roads overgrown to a single-track width; others were created solely by repeated use, especially by equestrians. These were often made with insufficient forethought and often suffer moderate to severe erosion problems, or may be overgrown and difficult to follow much of the year.

Henry Coe also provides exceptional backpacking opportunities. The park is so large and there are so many roads and trails, that one could plan a route covering ten miles per day, at a different campsite each night, and go two weeks without ever using the same trail or dirt road. Coe is the only park in the San Francisco Bay Area where this is possible. Backpackers also have the opportunity to fish while in the park as several of the lakes support large populations of largemouth bass and bluegill. Mississippi Lake, Coit Lake, and Kelly Lake are popular fishing destinations for backpackers. Permits are required, but are usually easy to obtain, except on busy spring weekends.

The park is considered mountain bike friendly from the Hunting Hollow entrance, since there are only a few miles of trails off limits to them (though this includes the whole of Orestimba Wilderness, but this is too far away for most bicyclists to reach on a day ride). It is not unusual for as much as half of park visitors on a given day to be mountain bicyclists, though this is normally closer to 30%. Equestrians also make use of the trails, including the Orestimba Wilderness area, though they account for less than 1% of all visitors. As in all state parks, hunting is prohibited, but fishing is allowed. Motorized vehicles are prohibited in the backcountry; exceptions are law enforcement, maintenance staff, and a few dirt roads are designated rights-of-way for in-holders, neighboring property owners and their guests.

Spring is the most popular time to visit the park, with its moderate weather, green hillsides dotted with colorful wildflowers, and flowing creeks. Summer is usually too hot and dry for some people to enjoy the area, though the nighttime weather is pleasant and the sky usually clear for star-gazing. Fall, from about mid-October through early November, is also a pleasant time to visit. There are also mild days between rainstorms in winter at Coe. Infrequent snowfall is light and usually persists for just a few days. On rare occasions, creeks can be frozen over in winter.

The most common danger faced by visitors is exhaustion from attempting to hike or ride too many steep trails in too little time, or with too little water or food. Additionally, there are many ticks of several different species (though Lyme disease is rare in the area), as well as a few venomous rattlesnakes.

=== Events ===
The park&#x27;s non-profit support group, the Pine Ridge Association, sponsors two popular annual events, a Mothers&#x27; Day Breakfast and the fall TarantulaFest. The latter consists of a traditional outdoor barbecue with live music and a celebration of the hairy arachnids which inhabit the park, the gentle tarantulas commonly seen in the fall there when males are wandering about looking for the burrows of females in order to mate with them.

==Threats of closure==
Henry W. Coe State Park was one of 70 California state parks proposed for closure by July 2012 as part of a deficit reduction program. Park advocates from the San Jose and Silicon Valley area organized the Coe Park Preservation Fund and raised donations to keep the park staffed from July 2012 through June 2015. The principal donor was businessman J. Daniel McCranie.

The park was previously one of several state parks threatened with closure in 2008. After the statewide special election of May 19, 2009, in which voters turned down a package of propositions dealing with California&#x27;s budget crisis, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger proposed the temporary closure (for at least 2 years) of 220 parks, including Henry W. Coe State Park. The closures were ultimately avoided by cutting hours and maintenance system-wide.

<text>Manitoba Finance () is the department of finance for the Canadian province of Manitoba.

The Minister of Finance (; originally Provincial Treasurer) is the cabinet minister responsible for the department, as well as for managing the province&#x27;s fiscal resources, overseeing taxation policies, and allocating funds to other governmental departments. Every year, the minister submits a budget to the Legislature outlining anticipated expenditures and revenues for the next 12 months. The minister is also required to submit a completed financial report for the annual cycle just completed.

The Finance portfolio is the oldest cabinet position in the province of Manitoba, even predating the office of Premier by four years. Similarly, many regard the Finance Minister as the most important member of government, second only to the Premier. Prior to 1977, it was not considered unusual for Manitoba&#x27;s provincial premiers to reserve the position of Treasurer or Finance Minister for themselves. In the 20th century, John Bracken, Stuart Garson, Douglas L. Campbell, Dufferin Roblin, and Edward Schreyer all assumed this responsibility at one time or another. (Roblin was his own Treasurer for the entire extent of his term in office). No premier has taken this responsibility since 1977, and such a combination of responsibilities would now be considered very unlikely.

The current Finance Minister of Manitoba is Adrien Sala of the New Democratic Party.

Administering &quot;The Funeral Directors and Embalmers Act&quot;, &quot;The Cemeteries Act&quot;, and &quot;The Prearranged Funeral Services Act&quot;, it is responsible for licensing all Manitoba funeral directors and embalmers; funeral homes; particular cemeteries and their sales persons; and prearranged funeral service plan providers.

Through the 1967 &quot;Embalmers and Funeral Directors Act&quot; the Board was established as the Board of Administration to oversee Manitoba&#x27;s funeral industry. The Act was amended and renamed in 2009 to &quot;The Funeral Directors and Embalmers Act&quot;, which changed the Board&#x27;s name to the Funeral Board of Manitoba.

=== Vital Statistics Agency ===

The Manitoba Vital Statistics Agency (VSA) is a special operating agency of the provincial government that is the civil registrar of Manitoba&#x27;s vital records. More specifically, it is responsible for registering vital statistics (birth, death, marriage, stillbirth and change of name) in Manitoba and provides documents as proof of those events.

While the Agency began operations on 1 April 1994, the provincial vital event registry dates to 1882. As such, with all records being held in perpetuity for all Manitoba events, the database contains vital records information for the Province of Manitoba from 1882 to present. Nearly 4 million records are held in the database .

The VSA reports to the Legislature through the Minister of Finance, and is responsible for administering and enforcing Manitoba&#x27;s &quot;Vital Statistics Act, Marriage Act, Change of Name Act&quot;, as well as processing disinterments under &quot;The Public Health Act&quot;.

It is a member of the Vital Statistics Council for Canada (VSCC), which was established in 1945 as partnership of provincial/territorial vital event registrars and federal officials responsible for national statistics.

=== Manitoba Bureau of Statistics ===

The Manitoba Bureau of Statistics (MBS), a branch of the Finance Department&#x27;s Finance Research Division, is the Manitoba government’s central statistics agency, tasked with compiling, managing, analyzing, coordinating, and disseminating of economic, demographic, and social statistics for the province.

Operating under the provincial &quot;Statistics Act&quot;, the Bureau addresses data and statistical requirements by collaborating with government departments and agencies; and, under a federal-provincial agreement, MBS is the designated contact and official liaison between the Government of Manitoba and the federal government&#x27;s Statistics Canada.

=== Manitoba Financial Services Agency ===

The Manitoba Financial Service Agency (MFSA; ) is a special operating agency of the Manitoba government responsible for administering and enforcing legislation for the securities and insurance sectors, real estate and mortgage brokers, credit unions/caisses populaires, cooperatives, and trust and loan companies who operate in Manitoba. It comprises the Manitoba Securities Commission (MSC) and Financial Institutions Regulation Branch (FIRB).

It is headed by a chief administrative officer, who is &quot;ex officio&quot; the Chair and chief executive officer of the MSC. As of at least 2020, the chief is David Cheop.

The Agency administers the following provincial legislation:

* &quot;The Securities Act&quot;, C.C.S.M. c. S 5 0
* &quot;The Commodity Futures Act&quot;, C.C.S.M. c. C152
* &quot;The Real Estate Brokers Act&quot;, C.C.S.M. c. R20
* &quot;The Mortgage Brokers Act&quot;, C.C.S.M. c. M210
* &quot;The Insurance Act&quot;, C.C.S.M. c. I40
* &quot;The Credit Unions and Caisse Populaires Act&quot;, C.C.S.M. c. C301
* &quot;The Cooperatives Act&quot;, C.C.S.M. c. C223
* &quot;The Corporations Act&quot;, C.C.S.M. c. C225, Part XXIV

==== Financial Institutions Regulation Branch ====
The Financial Institutions Regulation Branch (FIRB; , DRIF) is the body responsible for regulatory oversight to financial institutions and cooperatives operating in Manitoba, including the insurance sector, credit unions/caisses populaires, and trust and loan companies. It is tasked with administering the provincial &quot;Insurance Act&quot;, &quot;Credit Unions and Caisses Populaires Act&quot;, and the &quot;Corporations Act&quot; (Part XXlV).

The FIRB was created in April 2000 through the amalgamation of two branches under the Department of Consumers and Corporate Affairs: the Insurance Branch and the Trust, Cooperatives and Credit Union Regulation Branch. Since then, government restructuring has led to the FIRB being part of various departments; as of October 2012, FIRB was merged into the Manitoba Financial Services Agency (MFSA).

==== Manitoba Securities Commission ====

The Manitoba Securities Commission (MSC; ) is the securities regulatory authority of Manitoba. As a division of the Manitoba Financial Services Agency, it is an independent agency of the provincial government and its Chair reports to the legislature through the Minister of Finance.

Following &quot;The Securities Act&quot;, MSC was structured in its present form in 1968, divided into two branches:

# the administrative or functional arm, consisting of full-time employees who conduct day-to-day operations. This arm includes 2 operating divisions of its own:
#* the Securities division, which is organized into several operational sections—investigation, legal, registration &amp; compliance, corporate finance &amp; continuous disclosure, finance &amp; administration, and education/information.
#* Real Estate division
# Commission members, the policy-making body consisting of Order-in-Council appointees (maximum of 7) who meet regularly.

The Chair presides at the Commission members&#x27; meetings and is also the chief executive officer of the administrative arm.

=== Public Utilities Board ===
The Manitoba Public Utilities Board is an independent quasi-judicial administrative tribunal that regulates public utilities and designated monopolies. It has oversight and supervisory powers over the rates charged for electrical utility, auto insurance, gas and propane utilities, and all water and sewer utilities outside of Winnipeg.

The Board is led by a chair and a vice-chair, appointed by the Lieutenant Governor. The chair has similar authority to that of a justice of the Manitoba Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench or as the deputy minister for the Manitoba Justice. Board members, appointed by the chair, are tasked with carrying out the Board&#x27;s legislative mandate. The PUB Chairperson reports to the Minister of Finance.

The Board has regulated services under legislation since 1913, with the current &quot;Public Utilities Board Act&quot; being passed in 1959. In addition to the &quot;Public Utilities Board Act&quot;, regulatory administration is provided through:

* Centra Gas Manitoba Inc. (natural gas distribution, utility rate setting)
* &quot;Crown Corporations Governance and Accountability Act&quot;
* &quot;Efficiency Manitoba Act&quot;
* &quot;Gas Allocation Act&quot;
* &quot;Gas Pipe Line Act&quot; (safety of natural gas and propane distribution)
* &quot;Greater Winnipeg Gas Distribution Act&quot; (natural gas distribution franchise)
* Manitoba Hydro (electric utility rate setting)
* Manitoba Public Insurance (auto insurance rate setting)
* &quot;Manitoba Water Services Board Act&quot; (appeals)
* &quot;Municipal Act&quot; (water and sewer utility rate regulation, excluding Winnipeg)
* Stittco Utilities Man Ltd. (propane distribution)
* The City of Winnipeg Charter

=== Treasury Board ===
The Treasury Board of Manitoba is a Cabinet sub-committee responsible for the overall fiscal management and reporting of the provincial government, as well as the &quot;establishment of policies required for the effective management of public funds to meet government objectives.&quot;

The Treasury Board Secretariat of Manitoba provides financial and analytical support as well as strategic management advice to the Minister of Finance and Treasury Board. The Secretariat is headed by a Deputy Minister who acts as Secretary to Treasury Board, currently Ann Ulusoy. It has been an independent secretariat since 1987/88.

Treasury Board Secretariat consists of the:

* Office of the Secretary to Treasury Board,
* Office of the Provincial Comptroller,
* Fiscal Management and Capital Planning Division,
* Analytical Division,
* Strategic Initiatives Division, and the
* Scorecards Division.

== History ==
The Finance portfolio is the oldest cabinet position in the province, predating the office of Premier by four years; and the minister was styled as the Provincial Treasurer until 1969. The first Provincial Secretary in Manitoba was Marc-Amable Girard, who was appointed to the position on 16 September 1870 by Lieutenant-Governor Adams George Archibald soon after his arrival in the province. Until January 1871, Girard and Provincial Secretary Alfred Boyd were the only members of Archibald&#x27;s ministry. Since the introduction of partisan politics in 1888, all Manitoba Finance Ministers have belonged to the governing party of the day. During the coalition ministry that governed Manitoba from 1940 to 1950, the position was reserved for members of the dominant Liberal-Progressive Party.

Prior to 1977, it was typical for Manitoba&#x27;s provincial premiers to reserve the position of Treasurer or Finance Minister for themselves. In the 20th century, John Bracken, Stuart Garson, Douglas L. Campbell, Dufferin Roblin, and Edward Schreyer all assumed this responsibility at one time or another. (Roblin was his own Treasurer for the entire extent of his term in office). No premier has taken this responsibility since 1977, and such a combination of responsibilities would now be considered very unlikely.

In early 2005, then Minister of Finance Greg Selinger indicated that his department would soon move to a system known as &quot;generally accepted accounting principles&quot;, which had already been adopted in most other provinces.

Following the 2019 provincial general election, Manitoba Finance underwent significant reorganization. While Central Services branched off as an independent department, the Finance department gained its Labour and Regulatory Services Division, the Consumer Protection Division, and Communications Services Manitoba, as well as the Vital Statistics Agency, Entrepreneurship Manitoba, and the Public Guardian and Trustee of Manitoba.

<text>Nightingale the Robber or Solovei the Brigand (), an epic robber, appears in traditional Russian &quot;byliny&quot; (folk poems).

==History==
Pavel Ivanovich Melnikov discovered a version of the legend of Solovei in a 17th-century handwritten collection of stories and published it in the Russian newspaper he edited, &quot;Nizhegorodskie gubernskie vedomosti&quot; (the Nizhny Novgorod Government News), in 1845 and 1847. In 1867 Melnikov wrote:
It [the story] still lives in people&#x27;s memory and was found by us 20 years ago [...] in one of handwritten collection of stories of the 17th century. In the ancient times, where Nizhny Novgorod now stands, lived a famous and strong Mordvin, by name Skvorets [&quot;Starling&quot;]. He was the friend of another Mordvin — just as famous, just as strong — Solovei [&quot;Nightingale&quot;], the same Solovei who was connected with Il&#x27;ya Muromets.

The bylina concerning Nightingale the Robber is also called &quot;The First Journey of Ilya Muromets&quot;, and is one of the most popular Russian epics, having been recorded 132 times (Bailey, p. 25). The monster Solovey had partial human and bird-like features, was able to fly, and lived in a nest, had a human family, and received drinks with his hands (Bailey, p. 27). He was said to live in a forest, and would sit in a tree and stun strangers with his powerful whistle. When Nightingale the Robber whistles, allegedly: &quot;all the grasses and meadows become entangled, the azure flowers lose their petals, all the dark woods bend down to the earth, and all the people there lie dead!&quot; (Bailey, p. 34).

Legend states that Ilya Muromets survived the whistle, even though Nightingale leveled half of the surrounding forest. Ilya Muromets shot down Nightingale the Robber with arrows to the eye and temple, then dragged the defeated monster before Vladimir, the Prince of Kiev. Vladimir wished to hear Nightingale the Robber whistle, but the creature claimed he was too wounded to whistle. Nightingale the Robber requested wine to drink so that his wounds would disappear, then he would whistle for the prince. When he whistled all of Vladimir&#x27;s palaces were destroyed and many lay dead. After this, Ilya Muromets took Nightingale the Robber into an open field and cut off his head (Bailey, pp. 28–36).

<text>Fordham Manor is a neighborhood located in the western Bronx, New York City. Fordham is roughly bordered by East 196th Street to the north, the Harlem River to the west, Fordham Road to the south, and Southern Boulevard to the east. The neighborhood&#x27;s primary thoroughfares are Fordham Road and Grand Concourse.

Fordham Manor is located within Bronx Community Board 5 and Bronx Community Board 7, and its ZIP Codes include 10453, 10457, 10458 and 10468. Its main subway line is the IND Concourse Line (), operating under the Grand Concourse, with the IRT Jerome Avenue Line () on its western border. The area is patrolled by the New York City Police Department&#x27;s 46th Precinct. New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) property in the area is patrolled by P.S.A. 7 at 737 Melrose Avenue in the Melrose section of the Bronx. The neighborhood is home to the original, Rose Hill campus of Fordham University.

==History==

Jan Arcer, a Dutch settler (who anglicized his name to John Archer), established a community at what is now 225th Street near the Harlem River in 1666. Archer owned 3900 acres of land which Francis Lovelace, the colonial governor of New York approved for settlement. The area known as &quot;Fordham Manor&quot; was 6 square miles. This was called a Patent, making Archer &quot;Lord of the Manor&quot;. Sixteen families established farms in the area. The Manor lasted from 1671 to 1762.

Archer chose the name Fordham for his community, which may have been a reference to its location near a shallow crossing (&quot;ford&quot;) of the Bronx River, or may have been a reference to John Fordham, a fourteenth-century English priest.

===Old Fordham Village===

Old Fordham Village is a section of Fordham that dates back to the English colonial era. It is centered on the intersection of the Grand Concourse and Fordham Road. Fordham Village extends north to about 196th Street, south to about 187th Street, east to Southern Boulevard, and west to Jerome Avenue.

The section&#x27;s origins date back to about 1751, when Fordham Manor was built on what was called Rose Hill. Most of the estate is part of the Rose Hill Campus of Fordham University. Besides the main manor house and other side buildings on the campus, other historic buildings and noted homes still exist within Old Fordham Village. For example, American poet Edgar Allan Poe spent his final years with his wife Virginia in a cottage in Fordham, which is still standing in Poe Park. The nearby Fordham University Church bell is named &quot;old Edgar&quot; and may have been the inspiration for his poem The Bells.

In the 18th century, the Kings Road went through Old Fordham Village, an area of rural estates and small farms, linking Colonial New York and towns and villages north toward Boston. It was a minor rest stop for travelers and coaches, where many springs fed The Mill Brook that crossed this road. During the American Revolution, it was a critical crossing point for Gen. George Washington&#x27;s Continental Army retreating toward White Plains to safely escape from New York while being chased by the Colonial British and Hessian Forces. There were many American Patriots that lived in this area. After the revolution, the Kings Road was renamed the Boston Post Road, becoming an important thoroughfare for a growing new nation.

In the 19th century, with the building of the White Plains Line (later the Harlem Line of the New York Central Railroad) and a small station, Old Fordham Village began to grow. Local farmers and dairymen were able to use the railroad to send their products to a growing New York City. Part of the Mill Brook was dammed up north of the village, and a large pond and ice house were built for shipping and cold storage. It provided fresh ice for the community and the railroad. In 1838, a wealthy New York City Irish Catholic real estate magnate named Andrew Carrigan (1804-1872) bought the 100-acre Rose Hill estate, located east of the village, for the sole purpose of selling it to his close friend John Joseph Hughes (1797-1864), who at the time was coadjutor bishop of the Diocese of New York. Hughes purchased the estate from Carrigan in 1839 for $29,750, and founded St. Joseph&#x27;s Seminary (1840) and St. Joseph&#x27;s College (1841) (later Fordham University) on the property. In 1846 Hughes deeded St. Joseph&#x27;s College over to the Roman Catholic Jesuit Order (Society of Jesus) for $40,000, but retained title to the seminary property (about 9 acres of land). The seminary was closed in 1859. Today, a small south-west portion of the former Rose Hill estate is known as Rose Hill Park. West of the village, on the other side of Fordham Hill, the Bathgate Estate was built; it was later acquired by wealthy stock speculator Leonard Jerome. He built the Jerome Park Racetrack, where the first Belmont Stakes was held, on his estate. West of the station in the village area, the Fordham Hotel and Taverine would provide basic needs for visitors to the college and the racetrack.

===After 1900===
For the most part, Old Fordham Village remained rural until about 1900, when New York City began to expand. Early mass transit to the suburbs changed the area of what is Fordham today. Old Fordham Village and the surrounding area would become part of the borough of the Bronx within New York City. Many remaining farms and estates were sold to developers who built houses and sizable apartment buildings. The formerly quiet little village became a major business and transportation hub. In this area of Fordham, Boston Post Road was renamed Fordham Road and became part of U.S. Route 1 in 1926. The rebuilding of the railroad right of way at Fordham, and most of Webster Avenue, eliminated The Mill Brook and water pond, but the side streets of Old Fordham Village remain active.

Fordham was a predominantly middle class White (of Irish and Jewish origins) neighborhood from the 1920s through the late 1970s, when many families moved to the suburbs or the Los Angeles area, or retired to Florida. Belmont was formerly a portion of Fordham and South Fordham.

On January 9, 2022, a high-rise fire tore through an apartment building in Fordham. At least 19 people were killed, including nine children, and at least 60 other people were injured, including 32 with life-threatening injuries. It was the third-deadliest residential fire in the U.S. since 1978.

==Demographics==
Fordham has a population of around 43,394 people. Its first growth was in the 1920s, when middle-class and working-class families from Manhattan flocked into the area, attracted by the then-modern housing and convenient subway access by Concourse, Jerome Avenue, and Third/Webster Avenues lines to business districts in Manhattan where they could work and shop. It is now predominantly Latino American and African American. There is a significant historic Italian and Albanian population as well.

Fordham is divided into two sections: Community District 5, south of Fordham Road, comprising Fordham South, and Community District 7, north of Fordham Road, comprising Fordham North. Most inhabitants of Community District 5 are youth and middle-aged adults: 28% are between 0–17, 29% between 25 and 44, and 23% between 45 and 64. The ratio of college-aged and elderly residents was lower, at 12% and 8% respectively. Similarly, most inhabitants of Community District 7 are youth and middle-aged adults: 26% are between the ages of between 0–17, 31% between 25 and 44, and 23% between 45 and 64. The ratio of college-aged and elderly residents was lower, at 11% and 9% respectively.

As of 2017, the median household income in Community District 5 was $30,166, and the median household income in Community District 7 was $35,355. In 2018, an estimated 34% of Fordham South residents lived in poverty, compared to 25% in all of the Bronx and 20% in all of New York City. One in eight residents (13%) were unemployed, compared to 13% in the Bronx and 9% in New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 65% in Fordham South, compared to the boroughwide and citywide rates of 58% and 51% respectively. In 2018, an estimated 26% of Fordham North residents lived in poverty, compared to 25% in all of the Bronx and 20% in all of New York City. One in seven residents (14%) were unemployed, compared to 13% in the Bronx and 9% in New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 61% in Fordham North, compared to the boroughwide and citywide rates of 58% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, , both areas are considered low-income relative to the rest of the city and not gentrifying.

==Land use and terrain==
Fordham is dominated by 5- and 6-story apartment buildings, often set flush to the sidewalk. Many of the apartments on the Grand Concourse are taller.

The New York Botanical Garden and the Wildlife Conservation Society&#x27;s Bronx Zoo, both inside Bronx Park, collectively occupy dozens of acres of land within the neighborhood.

Fordham University maintains its historic original campus on much of the former Rose Hill Manor in the center of the neighborhood. It is one of the largest &quot;green&quot; campuses in New York City, and its traditional collegiate gothic architecture often serves as a backdrop for television and film productions.

The Fordham Road Business Improvement District operates on the northern border of the neighborhood. This retail district is the longest in the Bronx.
Fordham is split into two community districts: Community District 5 south of Fordham Road and Community District 7 north of Fordham Road. Community District 5, which comprises southern Fordham South, had 136,151 inhabitants as of NYC Health&#x27;s 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 79.9 years. Community District 7, which comprises Fordham South and Bedford Park, had 148,163 inhabitants as of NYC Health&#x27;s 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 79.4 years. Both figures are lower than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods.

<text>John Williams (born John Fielding; 24 May 1857 – 25 November 1932) was a Welsh recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
John Fielding was the second eldest of ten children. John&#x27;s parents were Michael and Margaret Godsil, who married in Abergavenny, Wales, in 1855. Both Michael (1831-1914) and Margaret (1835-1921) were from Cork, Ireland as documented on the 1911 census. Michael Fielding died at the age of 82 and is buried in the Cwmbran cemetery. John was born at Merthyr Road, Abergavenny. The entire family were Catholic.

==Military career==
John was tall. Born Fielding, he enlisted under the name of Williams in the Monmouthshire Militia in January 1877. More than three months later, he enlisted under regular terms of service in the British Army on 22 May 1877 at Monmouth.

Williams was 21 years old, and a private in the 2nd Battalion, 24th Regiment of Foot (later The South Wales Borderers), British Army during the Anglo-Zulu War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC. 

On 22–23 January 1879 at Rorke&#x27;s Drift, Natal, South Africa, Private Williams and two other men held a distant room of the hospital for more than an hour until they had no ammunition left, when the Zulus burst in and killed one of the men and two patients. Meanwhile, Private Williams had succeeded in knocking a hole in the partition and took the two remaining patients through into the next ward. He was there joined by Alfred Henry Hook, and working together (one holding the enemy at bayonet point while the other broke through three more partitions) they were able to bring eight patients into the inner line of defence. His citation read:
Williams was presented with his VC in Gibraltar by Major-General Anderson, Governor of Gibraltar in 1880.

==Later life==
Fielding served with the battalion until 1883, after six years of service with the colours, when he returned to the UK from India aboard HMS Malabar (1866) and was transferred to the reserves. He extended his reserve service by 4 years, up to 1893. He appeared on the 1891 census, living with his wife and 5 children at Llantarnam, he was employed as a labourer. He later achieved the rank of Sergeant in the 3rd (Monmouthshire) Volunteer Battalion, South Wales Borderers, and had his portrait painted in 1895. In 1914, he reenlisted for service and served on the SWB Depot staff at Brecon throughout World War I. He married Elizabeth Murphy in 1884 (deceased 1914) and they had 3 sons and 3 daughters. One son was killed while serving with 1st Battalion SWB during the First Battle of the Aisne in 1914.

He died from heart failure in Cwmbran on 24 November 1932. The nursing home directly opposite his burial place in Llantarnam, Cwmbran, was later named in his honour, as was a local pub, the John Fielding, where a picture of him is displayed.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross was donated to the SWB Museum by the Fielding family and is displayed at the Regimental Museum of The Royal Welsh in Brecon, Powys, Wales.

==Parade==
The &quot;South Wales Argus&quot; revealed in January 2019 that the annual parade, to remember Fielding&#x27;s heroism, had been cancelled for &quot;health and safety&quot; reasons.

<text>Staphyliniformia is a large infraorder of beetles. It contains over 70,000 described species from all regions of the world. Most species occur in moist habitats - various kinds of rotting plant debris, fungi, dung, carrion, many live in fresh water.

==Characteristics==
Most Staphyliniforms are small to average sized beetles. The diverse group has few clear apomorphies. They have primitively 11-segmented antennae, a constricted neck well behind the eyes. The pronotum has a well defined, large lateral edge. Larval legs are 5-segmented, the 10th abdominal segment is often with more-or-less fine or strong spines or hooks. Urogomphi (paired &quot;horns&quot; at posterior tip of abdomen of larvae and pupae) with basal articulation.

==Systematics and evolution==
Staphyliniformia belongs to the suborder Polyphaga and is usually given an infraorder or series rank. It contains three superfamilies:
*Histeroidea, including the clown beetles.
*Hydrophiloidea, including the water scavenger beetles
*Staphylinoidea, including antlike stone beetles, carrion beetles, and rove beetles.
Some recent studies also include the superfamily Scarabaeoidea (infraorder Scarabaeiformia), forming together the so-called Hydrophiloid lineage. A sister group relationship of Hydrophiloidea and Histeroidea is strongly supported.

The unambiguous fossil record dates back to Triassic, and an early Mesozoic origin of the group is probable.

<text>Scarabaeoidea is a superfamily of beetles, the only subgroup of the infraorder Scarabaeiformia. Around 35,000 species are placed in this superfamily and some 200 new species are described each year. Its constituent families are also undergoing revision presently, and the family list below is only preliminary. This superfamily includes some of the largest beetles extant today, including rhinoceros beetles, (Dynastinae), the Hercules beetle (&quot;Dynastes hercules&quot;) and Goliath beetles (&quot;Goliathus&quot; sp.). 

The oldest confirmed member of the group is the extinct genus &quot;Alloioscarabaeus&quot; from the Middle Jurassic period Jiulongshan Formation of Inner Mongolia, China.

==Families==
The following families are listed in Bouchard (2011):

* Belohinidae 
* Diphyllostomatidae (false stag beetles)
* Geotrupidae (earth-boring dung beetles)
* Glaphyridae (bumble bee scarab beetles)
* Glaresidae (enigmatic scarab beetles)
* Hybosoridae (scavenging scarab beetles)
** inclusive of Ceratocanthidae (pill scarab beetles)
* Lucanidae (stag beetles)
* Ochodaeidae (sand-loving scarab beetles)
* Passalidae (bess beetles)
* Pleocomidae (rain beetles)
* Scarabaeidae (scarab beetles)
* Trogidae (hide beetles)
*† Coprinisphaeridae (ichnotaxon)
*† Pallichnidae (ichnotaxon)
*† Passalopalpidae

<text>A Patchwork Planet is a novel by Anne Tyler. Published in 1998, it tells the story of Barnaby Gaitlin, anti-hero and failure who suffers from more than the usual quota of misfortune. The book is noted for its complement of old people and eccentrics, and its sharply ironic humor.

==Plot summary==

The novel is narrated by 30-year-old Barnaby, whose life has gone off the rails since he was caught robbing neighborhood homes as an adolescent. To the despair of his distant father, his social climbing mother, his chilly ex-wife and his prematurely patriarchal brother, Barnaby now works for a company called Rent-a-Back, doing odd jobs for elderly clients.

He also waits, without much hope, for a visitation from the Gaitlin angel, who first suggested to Barnaby&#x27;s great-grandfather the invention of the wooden dress form that made the Gaitlins rich. He finds his angel but perhaps not where he expects. He believes his angel was 36-year-old Sophia Maynard.

Barnaby first sees Sophia on the train, while he is going to see his 9 year old daughter in Philadelphia, and Sophia is going to visit her mother. While he is in Philadelphia, his ex-wife told him he was not allowed to see their daughter anymore. The next week, he went back. Sophia was on the train again, and he is able to tell her about his job at Rent-a-Back, and she tells him about her job at the bank. They also discuss Opal, Barnaby&#x27;s daughter, and Sophia agrees he should see her, and that Opal would want to continue to see her daddy.

Later, Sophia contacts Barnaby&#x27;s employer. She claims her aunt needs help working, and she needs Barnaby to help. Although, Barnaby&#x27;s friend who is working with him, claims that Sophia hangs around while they are working, hoping Barnaby will ask her out. He finally does and she accepts. After a few months, Barnaby introduces Sophia to his family, and later Sophia introduces Barnaby to her mother.

That summer, Barnaby introduces Sophia to his daughter, who has come to visit for a week. Opal says she likes Sophia, but by fall, when Opal sees Sophia&#x27;s name on her Birthday card, she realizes that they are dating. While Barnaby and Opal are going to eat lunch, and they spot Opal&#x27;s mother. Opal takes her stuffed Hedgehog from her father, and asks her mother to take her home.

The novel traces the lead characters development towards maturity as he is influenced by his family and employers.

<text>CNW Group Ltd., also called Canada Newswire and CNW, is a commercial press release service owned by Cision. Cision Distribution services in Canada are powered by Canada Newswire. The service is offered stand-alone or as part of its flagship Cision Communications Cloud platform for PR professionals.

==History==
CNW was founded in 1960 as Canada News Wire, by Joseph Adair Porter Clark (1921–2013) who became CEO and President of the news service. Clark is the father of television journalist Tom Clark.

CNW originally delivered text news releases to news media outlets on behalf of paying clients. This model expanded over time to include the provision of ancillary services required by investor relations and public relations professionals, including translation, photography, webcasts, media databases and media monitoring.

Canada Newswire distribution switched to using XHTML instead of ANPA-1312, allowing for more formatting of releases. In 2003, CNW entered into a commercial endorsed deal with TSX for its newswire and webcast services through a paid sponsorship agreement.

CNW was acquired by US-based PR Newswire in 2013. PR Newswire was subsequently acquired by Cision in 2016. Cision was most recently acquired by Platinum Equity, announced October 22, 2019. 

On March 19, 2021 Business Insider reported Cision may be looking to spin off its Newswire unit.

<text>Elateriformia is an infraorder of polyphagan beetles. The two largest families in this group are buprestids, of which there are around 15,000 described species, and click beetles, of which there are around 10,000 described species.

The infraorder consists of six superfamilies:

*Buprestoidea — the metallic wood-boring beetles

<text>The passamezzo moderno (&quot;modern half step&quot;; also quadran, quadrant, or quadro pavan), or Gregory Walker was &quot;one of the most popular harmonic formulae in the Renaissance period, divid[ing] into two complementary strains thus:&quot;

For example, in C major the progression is as follows:

The progression or ground bass, the major mode variation of the passamezzo antico, originated in Italian and French dance music during the first half of the 16th century, where it was often used with a contrasting progression or section known as &quot;ripresa&quot;. Though one of Thomas Morley&#x27;s characters in &quot;Plaine and Easie Introduction to Practicall Musicke&quot; denigrates the Gregory Walker, comparing unskilled singing to its sound, it was popular in both pop/popular/folk and classical musics through 1700. Its popularity was revived in the mid 19th century, and the American variant (below) evolved into the twelve bar blues.

==Examples==
Listed in :
*several in &quot;The Fitzwilliam Virginal Book&quot;
*&quot;Up and Ware Them A Willie&quot;
*&quot;Jimmie Rose&quot;
*&quot;Darling Nelly Gray&quot;
*&quot;Wreck of the Old 97&quot;
*Woody Guthrie&#x27;s &quot;There is a House in This Old Town&quot;
*Irving Berlin&#x27;s &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Ragtime Band&quot;
*The Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Honky Tonk Women&quot; (1969)
*Carole King&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Friend&quot; (1971)

Listed in :
*Hans Neusidler&#x27;s &quot;Gassenhauer&quot; (Nuremberg, 1536)
*&quot;Oxstedter Mühle&quot; (folk dance from Lower Saxony) (B section)
*Diego Ortiz&#x27; &quot;Recercada Prima / Segunda / Tercera sobre el Passamezzo Moderno&quot; (three-part didactic composition in &quot;Tratado de Glosas sobre cláusulas y Otros Generos de Puntos en la Música de Violones&quot;, 1553). (Readers of Spanish may benefit from the Spanish-language Wikipedia&#x27;s more extensive treatment of Diego Ortiz and of the &quot;Tratado de Glosas&quot;.)

Others:
*Iron &amp; Wine&#x27;s &quot;A History of Lovers&quot; (verses; chorus and interludes follow &quot;ripresi&quot; IV–I–IV–V progression)
*Ed Rush and George Cromarty’s &quot;Plastic Jesus&quot;

==American Gregory Walker==
The American Gregory Walker, popular in parlour music, is a variation in which the subdominant (IV) chords become the progression IV–I.

For example, in C major this variation is as follows:

===Examples===
Listed in :
*&quot;Jesse James&quot;
*&quot;The Titanic&quot;
*&quot;My Little Old Sod Shanty&quot;
*&quot;Cottonfields&quot;
*Gus Cannon&#x27;s &quot;Walk Right In&quot; (1929)

==Other variations==
===On original progression===

*Second strain&#x27;s first I becomes I–I7 (for a stronger &quot;lead-in&quot; to the upcoming IV):
:*&quot;Gathering Flowers From the Hillside&quot;: The Bluegrass variation frequently occurs in conjunction with the I–I7 &quot;lead-in&quot; and/or the direct IV-to-V transition listed above.&lt;br&gt;The resulting progression is  ||| I | I | I | V || I(–I7) | IV | (I–)V | I ||| ; examples include:
::*&quot;Free Little Bird&quot; (David Holt and Doc and Merle Watson; not to be confused with Lynyrd Skynyrd&#x27;s &quot;Free Bird&quot;).

===On American variant===
*IV–I is reversed, becoming I–IV or I7–IV:
:*&quot;Tennessee Waltz&quot; (Stewart and King 1947) (verse and second strain of chorus)

<text>Ultraman is the name of several supervillains appearing in stories published by DC Comics. The characters are all evil or corrupted alternate-universe counterparts of Superman. Ultraman first appeared in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #29 (August 1964).

==Publication history==
Ultraman first appeared as the evil counterpart of Superman on the original Earth-Three. Having created the worlds of Earth-One, containing Silver Age superheroes, as well as Earth-Two, containing the Golden Age ones, DC Comics decided to expand the universe to include various themed universes. The first of these was Earth-Three, in which there were villainous counterparts of DC&#x27;s heroes as well as heroic counterparts of DC&#x27;s villains. The first Ultraman is killed in &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; when Earth-Three is destroyed by an anti-matter wave. Following his death, Ultraman appears in &quot;Animal Man&quot; and &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;.

Since &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, DC has returned to the concept of Ultraman, creating two different characters with that name, often appearing only for a single issue in a story arc. There have been several appearances by both characters. The first version was an anti-matter version of Ultraman, created for Grant Morrison&#x27;s &quot;&quot; graphic novel. This version has appeared several times and was slain at the conclusion of the &quot;Final Crisis&quot; series. Another version, closer to the Silver Age original Ultraman, appeared on the New 52 universe&#x27;s Earth-3. Based on comments by Grant Morrison, this Earth-3 universe is not the pre-Crisis Earth-Three, making this a new character unrelated to previous versions.

==Fictional character biography==
===Original Earth-Three Ultraman===
Unlike Superman, the Earth-Three Ultraman is empowered by kryptonite, originally developing a new superpower with each new exposure. In one such encounter, Ultraman gains the ability to see through dimensional barriers, making the Crime Syndicate aware of the multiverse. This allowed the Syndicate to attack the Justice League and Justice Society. Ultraman also differed from Superman, in that his version of the planet Krypton had not exploded. Where the Earth-Three kryptonite originated was never specifically listed in any published book.

In the early 1980s, Ultraman allies with Lex Luthor of Earth-One and Alexei Luthor of Earth-Two in an unsuccessful attempt to eliminate their respective Supermen. Later, Ultraman and the Crime Syndicate ally with Per Degaton, who uses them in his attempt to conquer Earth-Two by stealing nuclear missiles.

In &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, Ultraman is killed when the Anti-Monitor destroys Earth-Three. Following this, he appears in &quot;Animal Man&quot;, where he learns of his status as a fictional character.

In &quot;One Year Later&quot;, it is revealed that Saturn Queen rescued Ultraman from the events of &quot;Crisis&quot; and brainwashed him to serve her.

Ultraman also appears in the &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; and &quot;Convergence&quot; events.

===Clark Kent (Antimatter Ultraman)===

In 1999, Ultraman was reintroduced in the &quot;&quot; graphic novel. The Crime Syndicate of America (CSA) is revealed for the first time to the Justice League by Alexander Luthor, the heroic antimatter counterpart to Lex Luthor. In this continuity, the CSA comes from the Antimatter Universe, each member being the antimatter counterpart to a core League member.

Unlike the original pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; Earth-Three Kryptonian Ultraman, the antimatter Ultraman was fully rewritten for modern continuity as Lieutenant Clark Kent, a human astronaut from the antimatter Earth and no longer a Kryptonian matching Superman exactly. After his ship imploded into hyperspace, an unknown alien race reconstructed Kent in an attempt to repair the damaged astronaut, which ended up altering the human both mentally and physically, giving him ultrapowers similar to Superman&#x27;s superpowers. According to Alexander Luthor, the process also twisted Ultraman&#x27;s mind. In contrast to Superman, Ultraman&#x27;s power relies on his proximity and exposure to a substance called Anti-Kryptonite; the longer and farther he is separated from it, the weaker he becomes. This substance has repeatedly been shown to have no apparent effect on Superman, just as Kryptonite has been shown to have no effect on Ultraman.

Antimatter Ultraman is unhappily married to his Crime Syndicate teammate Superwoman. Their alter-egos are the Antimatter Earth&#x27;s alternate Clark Kent and Lois Lane. In the early 2000s, the two had a child together, but Superwoman maintains a periodic affair with another member of the Crime Syndicate, Owlman, much to Ultraman&#x27;s frustration. Ultraman would usually fire his eyebeams in between Owlman and Superwoman as a warning when he sees Owlman flirting with Superwoman, although undisclosed photographic blackmail material in Owlman&#x27;s possession stops Ultraman actually doing anything permanent to him.

Antimatter Clark Kent has been shown to have returned to the Antimatter Earth and again leads the antimatter Crime Syndicate. In an attempt to repair their Earth after the destruction done by the Weaponers of Qward (which resulted as part of the follow-up to their appearance in the first issue of &quot;JLA/Avengers&quot;), The Syndicate was shown to have been kidnapping people from all 52 matter universes as shown in the &quot;Trinity&quot; series. In &quot;Trinity&quot; #13, antimatter Ultraman, Owlman and Superwoman were banished to an alternate subdimension by Superman after Superman defeated Ultraman in a fight.

In &quot;Superman Beyond&quot;, the antimatter Ultraman was recruited on a journey to the DC Universe&#x27;s version of Limbo, along with several other alternate universe Supermen, briefly combining - albeit against his will - with Superman to activate a massive robotic version of themselves to defeat Mandrakk, the dark Monitor, their raw power combining in the robot along with Superman&#x27;s moral strength and Ultraman&#x27;s pragmatic ruthlessness. In &quot;Superman Beyond&quot; #2, he was shown to have been converted into a vampiric being. In the seventh issue of &quot;Final Crisis&quot;, the antimatter Ultraman was apparently slain by the united Supermen alongside his new master, Mandrakk.

===Post Crisis Earth-3 Ultraman===
In &quot;52&quot; Week 52, a new version of Earth-Three was shown as one universe amongst the Post-Crisis DC Multiverse. In the depiction was the &quot;Crime Society of America&quot;, whose members were twisted versions of the original Justice Society of America, including Superman. The names of the characters and the team are not mentioned in the two panels in which they appear, but this Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; Earth-3 Ultraman was originally shown to be aged, as he was a counterpart of the aged Superman of Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; Earth-2. When the Earth-3 Ultraman is shown in later appearances of the &quot;Countdown&quot; series, he is no longer aged but young. The Earth-3 team is the &quot;Crime Society of America&quot;.

The Society make their first solo appearance in &quot;Countdown Presents The Search for Ray Palmer: Crime Society&quot; #1 (origin of Post Crisis Earth-3 Owlmen, Talons, Jokester, who is a heroic Joker) written by Sean McKeever and illustrated by Jamal Igle. In subsequent appearances, the Crime Society are agents of Monarch&#x27;s Multiversal army. Ultraman, along with several other members of the Crime Society, were in the Earth-51 dimension when Superman-Prime destroyed the Monarch&#x27;s containment armor unleashing all of Monarch&#x27;s quantum energy which destroyed the entire Earth-51 dimension. As such, Ultraman is presumed dead along with his fellow Crime Society members. A Ultraman with the exact same design appeared in The Brave and the Bold, powered by the same kryptonite that weakens Superman. He was brought to the main earth by Mixyezpitelik, the antimatter universe&#x27;s Mxyzptlk, to help Superman defeat Megistus.

===The New 52===
In The New 52&#x27;s rebooted continuity, a new version of Ultraman is introduced as one of the members of the Crime Syndicate to arrive from Earth-Three at the conclusion of the Trinity War event.

This version of Ultraman is Kal-Il, who comes from a version of Krypton whose people are mean-spirited and selfish. Unlike their other incarnations, they gain power when exposed to green Kryptonite. Just before this Krypton was destroyed, Kal-Il&#x27;s parents Jor-Il and Lara sent him to Earth-3 to one day seek vengeance against the being that destroyed Krypton (whom Jor-Il inadvertently summoned), teaching him to become the strongest being on the planet, or become nothing at all. Upon his arrival on Earth-3, the young Kal-Il coerced two alcoholic drug addicts, Johnny and Martha Kent, to adopt him, only to murder them years later once he had no further need of them. He went on to found the Crime Syndicate and take over the world. Ultraman is a violent, homicidal megalomaniac, as well as an elitist and Darwinist who values strength and selfishness, and hates weakness and altruism. After Earth-3 was devastated by the same being that destroyed Krypton-3, Ultraman led the Crime Syndicate to the Prime Earth to conquer it.

This version of Ultraman possesses the standard powers of a Kryptonian, only he is empowered by green Kryptonite (being able to crush it into powder and even snort it like cocaine) and is weakened by yellow sunlight. He was responsible for murdering Monocle when he claimed that the Crime Syndicate was the Justice League in disguise. Ultraman moved the moon in front of the sun to eclipse the Crime Syndicate&#x27;s section of Earth as well as to protect himself from its rays.

The New 52 version of Ultraman is depicted as lacking Superman&#x27;s vulnerability to magic. In the final battle, Ultraman engages Alexander Luthor but is beaten, Alexander leaves him to steal Deathstorm&#x27;s powers. Ultraman later returns and attempts to attack Lex Luthor after he murdered Alexander Luthor only to be weakened after Sinestro and Black Adam move the moon and expose him to yellow sunlight. Lex Luthor opts not to kill Ultraman and kills Atomica instead. Afterwards, Ultraman and Superwoman are arrested.

In &quot;Darkseid War&quot;, Ultraman is killed by the Anti-Monitor. He is later resurrected in the &quot;Year of the Villain&quot; event.

===Infinite Frontier===
Following the reboot of the multiverse after &quot;Dark Nights: Death Metal&quot;, a new Earth-3 and Ultraman are created. Kal Il is the last survivor of the dead planet Krypton, sent to Earth as a baby. He was found by Jonathan and Martha Kent, who adopted him and named him Clark. His powers manifested early and he never bothered to hide them, so the other children were afraid of and ostracised him, telling him that he was from space. The Kents exploited Clark and his powers for free labour, teaching him that obedience was the ultimate virtue and that people who did not contribute to society were to be reviled as &quot;freeloaders&quot;. They also manipulated him to be emotionally dependent on them so that he would never leave the farm. When he was a teenager in 1963 his parents showed him his spacecraft and revealed to him that he was the last of his kind, telling him they were all he had. They hoped this would make him afraid to ever break free of them, but in fact he turned on them, realising that they had only ever taken advantage of him. He flew away from Smallville, carrying his ship.

Ultraman reveals himself to the world on November 22, 1963 by assassinating the hated President John F. Kennedy with his heat vision. He is the world&#x27;s only known metahuman until other beings with unnatural powers began to emerge at the start of the year 2021. He rules Metropolis as a semi-benevolent dictator, beloved by some but feared and hated by many others. Ultraman allows the people of Metropolis limited freedom but tolerates no dissent. The only people who dare to challenge him openly are Lex Luthor and Cat Grant.

Following the Starro invasion, a number of metahumans reveal themselves to the world, and Luthor recruits them into the Legion of Justice. Owlman and Superwoman approachs Ultraman for an alliance to counter Luthor and rule the world, offering to make him their leader. Ultraman accepts and Superwoman also offers herself to him, hoping to conceive an heir.

==Powers and abilities==
Ultraman possesses the same Kryptonian superpowers as Superman. However, he is weakened by yellow sunlight and empowered by green kryptonite.

<text>Phil Anderton (born 1965 or 1966) is a Scottish business and marketing executive.

He was appointed as the Chief Executive Officer of the Scottish Rugby Union in February 2004, after several years of successful marketing within the SRU. He was nicknamed &quot;Firework Phil&quot;, because he provided lavish firework displays and entertainment before rugby games at Murrayfield Stadium. These were criticised by Sir Clive Woodward as &quot;more like a pop concert than a rugby match&quot; after the Calcutta Cup game in Edinburgh in 2004, but Anderton was unrepentant on both counts. Anderton resigned as CEO in January 2005 after David Mackay (Chairman of the SRU) was forced to resign by the SRU General Committee.

From March 2005 to October 2005, he served as the Chief Executive of the Scottish Premier League football club Hearts. Anderton&#x27;s dismissal as chief executive by majority owner Vladimir Romanov prompted Hearts chairman, George Foulkes, to resign in protest. After leaving Hearts, Anderton was appointed chairman of the ATP World Tour Finals, the largest indoor tennis tournament in the world. Anderton then served as chief executive of the Al-Jazira Club in Abu Dhabi, but resigned for personal reasons. In February 2013, he was appointed to the board of the political campaign group Better Together.

Anderton holds a degree in Management and International Relations from the University of St Andrews.

<doc id="1189137" wikidata="Q332899" url="?curid=1189137" title="Joe McCarthy (baseball manager)">
<text>Joseph Vincent McCarthy (April 21, 1887 – January 13, 1978) was an American manager in Major League Baseball, most renowned for his leadership of the &quot;Bronx Bombers&quot; teams of the New York Yankees from 1931 to 1946. The first manager to win pennants with both National and American League teams (doing so with the Chicago Cubs in 1929 and the Yankees in 1932), he won a total nine league pennants and seven World Series championships – the latter is a record tied only by Casey Stengel. McCarthy was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1957. He recorded a 100-win season six times, a record matched only by Bobby Cox. McCarthy&#x27;s career winning percentages in both the regular season (.615) and postseason (.698, all in the World Series) are the highest in major league history. His 2,125 career victories rank ninth all-time in major league history for managerial wins, and he ranks first all-time for the Yankees with 1,460 wins.

==Playing years==
Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to parents that were Irish immigrants, and grew up in the Germantown neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Idolizing Athletics manager Connie Mack, McCarthy is among a handful of successful major league managers who never played in the majors. After attending Niagara University in 1905 and 1906 on a baseball scholarship, he spent the next 15 years in the minor leagues, primarily as a shortstop and second baseman with the Toledo Mud Hens, Buffalo Bisons, and Louisville Colonels. In 1916 he signed with the Brooklyn Tip-Tops of the Federal League—then considered a third major league—but the league folded before he could play a game with them.

==Team success==

McCarthy briefly served as player-manager in Wilkes-Barre in 1913. He resumed his managing career with Louisville in 1919, leading the team to American Association pennants in 1921 and 1925 before being hired to manage the Chicago Cubs for the 1926 season. He turned the club around, guiding them to the 1929 NL title, but was fired near the end of the 1930 season.

The Yankees hired McCarthy in 1931. The team had won three World Series since Babe Ruth&#x27;s arrival in 1920, which did not sit well with owner Jacob Ruppert. McCarthy was told that he had three years to win a championship. He did so in his second year, 1932.

With the Yankees, his strict but fair managing style helped to solidify the team&#x27;s place as the dominant franchise in baseball. During his tenure, the Yankees won seven World Series. His most successful period came from 1936 to 1943. During that time, they won seven out of a possible eight pennants, all by nine games or more, and won six World Series—including four in a row from 1936 to 1939. They were the first American League team, and the third in major league history, to win four straight pennants, and the first to win more than two World Series in a row. The only time during this stretch that the Yankees&#x27; dominance was even threatened was in 1940, when they struggled all season and finished third. During his time with the Yankees, the team won 100 games or more six times. The worst finish he ever had with the team was fourth, achieved during his last full season in 1945, although the team finished 81–71.

McCarthy struggled to control his emotions at the moving testimonial held for Lou Gehrig at Yankee Stadium on July 4, 1939. After describing Gehrig as &quot;the finest example of a ballplayer, sportsman, and citizen that baseball has ever known&quot;, McCarthy could stand it no longer. Turning tearfully to Gehrig, he said, &quot;Lou, what else can I say except that it was a sad day in the life of everybody who knew you when you [...] told me you were quitting as a ballplayer because you felt yourself a hindrance to the team. My God, man, you were never that.&quot;

McCarthy frequently battled a drinking problem; he was known for going on &quot;benders&quot; that lasted a week or more. His alcoholism ended his tenure with the Yankees early in the 1946 season: By late May, the Yankees were already six games behind the Boston Red Sox. After the Yankees lost two straight to Cleveland, a drunken McCarthy chewed out pitcher Joe Page for spending too many nights out late. After failing to show up during a series with the Detroit Tigers, he returned to his farm in Amherst, New York, near Buffalo, and resigned by telegram.

After spending the 1947 season away from the game–his first season out of baseball since 1919–McCarthy returned in 1948 as manager of the Red Sox when longtime manager Joe Cronin accepted a promotion to general manager. On the first day of spring training, McCarthy arrived in an open-collared shirt. Knowing that Ted Williams almost never wore a tie, McCarthy said he was willing to set aside his longstanding rule requiring his players to wear ties at all times, saying, &quot;If I can&#x27;t get along with a .400 hitter, they ought to fire me right now.&quot;

In the 1948 season he managed the Red Sox to a 96–59 record; however, Boston fell short of the pennant when they lost in the 1948 American League tie-breaker game to the Cleveland Indians 8–3. The following year, the Red Sox led the Yankees by one game with two to play, but the Yankees beat the Red Sox in those final two games to win the pennant, the first of ten for Casey Stengel. Boston finished 96–58, one game behind New York.

The Red Sox started the 1950 season slowly; by late June, they were 31–28, eight games out of first. On June 21, McCarthy didn&#x27;t show up for a game against the Chicago White Sox, leading to speculation that he was drinking again. McCarthy insisted he would remain in the dugout; but Cronin suspected that McCarthy had lost his competitive fire, and persuaded him to resign. In 24 seasons as a major league manager, McCarthy never managed a team to a losing record.

==Coaching style==
Despite his teams&#x27; great performance, McCarthy was not without his detractors, who believed he was simply fortunate enough to be provided with great talent and was not a strong game tactician. During his peak period from 1936 to 1943, when the Yankees won seven pennants in eight seasons, White Sox manager Jimmy Dykes described McCarthy as a &quot;push-button&quot; manager. Yet McCarthy was an outstanding teacher and developer of talent, and was particularly adept at handling temperamental players such as Babe Ruth, who had hoped to become New York&#x27;s manager and resented a team &quot;outsider&quot; being hired. Ruth and McCarthy&#x27;s relationship was lukewarm at best, and chilled considerably in 1934 when Ruth began openly campaigning to become manager. Partly due to this, Ruth was traded to the lowly Boston Braves after the season.

While managing, McCarthy utilized a low-key approach, never going to the mound to remove a pitcher or arguing with an umpire except on a point of the rules, preferring to stay at his seat in the center of the dugout. He also declined to wear a numbered uniform with the Yankees and Red Sox.

In order to draw attention to his presumed masterful leadership of the Yankees, McCarthy was given the nickname of &quot;Marse Joe&quot; by sportswriters. &quot;Marse&quot; is a Southern English rendition of the word &quot;master&quot;. McCarthy&#x27;s success throughout his career was such that in 32 years of managing, his 1922 Louisville club was the only team that finished either with a losing record or below fourth place.

McCarthy was named Major League Manager of the Year by &quot;The Sporting News&quot; in 1936 – the first year the award was given – and again in 1938 and 1943.

==Legacy==

In a 1969 poll by the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America to commemorate the sport&#x27;s professional centennial, McCarthy finished third in voting for the greatest manager in history, behind John McGraw and Casey Stengel. In a similar BBWAA poll in 1997 to select an All-Century team, he finished second behind Stengel. On April 29, 1976, the Yankees dedicated a plaque for their Monument Park to McCarthy. The plaque calls him &quot;One of baseball&#x27;s most beloved and respected leaders.&quot; In honor of his commitment to Buffalo, McCarthy became a charter member of the Buffalo Baseball Hall of Fame in 1985.

McCarthy died of pneumonia at age 90 in Buffalo, New York, and is buried in Mount Olivet Cemetery, (Roman Catholic) in Tonawanda, New York.

==Ten Commandments==
McCarthy&#x27;s &quot;10 Commandments for Success in the Majors&quot;:
*Nobody ever became a ballplayer by walking after a ball.
*You will never become a .300 hitter unless you take the bat off your shoulder.
*An outfielder who throws in back of a runner is locking the barn after the horse is stolen.
*Keep your head up and you may not have to keep it down.
*When you start to slide, SLIDE. He who changes his mind may have to change a good leg for a bad one.
*Do not alibi on bad hops. Anyone can field the good ones.
*Always run them out. You never can tell.
*Do not quit.
*Try not to find too much fault with the umpires. You cannot expect them to be as perfect as you are.
*A pitcher who hasn&#x27;t control hasn&#x27;t anything.

<doc id="1189138" wikidata="Q976355" url="?curid=1189138" title="City of Playford">
<text>The City of Playford is a local government area of South Australia in Adelaide&#x27;s northern suburbs. It was named in recognition of Sir Thomas Playford, who played a part in the development of the area, and was South Australia&#x27;s premier from 1938–1965. The city covers an area of , and is home to over 90,000 residents. Playford was the fastest growing local government area in South Australia in the 2010s.

==History==

===Origins===
The LGA was formed in 1997 through the merger of the City of Elizabeth and the City of Munno Para, which were formed in 1955 and 1958, respectively. It was named in recognition of Sir Thomas Playford, who played a part in the development of the area, and was South Australia&#x27;s premier from 1938–1965.

Prior to the 1950s, most of the area surrounding the townships of Munno Para and Elizabeth were farming estates. After the end of the Second World War and the accompanying shortage of materials, the state government decided that South Australia needed to grow and become an industrialized state. A &quot;satellite city&quot; was planned for the Elizabeth area, and the South Australian Housing Trust initiated a housing development programme in the area, with a purchase of of land. The City of Elizabeth was formed on 16 November 1955, being named after Queen Elizabeth II, who visited the city in 1963. The District Council of Munno Para was formed on 6 November 1958 following the renaming of the District Council of Munno Para East which was Proclaimed on 10 November 1853.
===1997 to 2010===
The first mayor of the City of Playford was Marilyn Baker, who had been the last mayor of the City of Elizabeth. She continued to hold that role until the 2006 council elections, when she was narrowly defeated by Martin Lindsell, the last mayor of the City of Munno Para.

After 1997, the council planned and built a number of new housing developments aimed at attracting young working couples and families in an attempt to rejuvenate the area. A new Civic Centre including council chambers, library, theatre and function centre was built. Other developments of the period included a new library in the Munno Para Shopping City in Smithfield, and a revamp of the Elizabeth shopping centre, including an 8-screen cinema complex.

In 2003 it was announced that A$1 billion would be allocated to rejuvenate the Peachey Belt. Known as the Playford North Urban Regeneration project, it was expected that the population of the area would increase from 13,000 residents to 30,000 in 15 years and involve the demolition of most of the Housing SA homes. the project has since been renamed &quot;Playford Alive&quot;.

&quot;As part of the 30-year Plan for greater Adelaide, significant growth and investment is pouring into Playford from business. Rapidly increasing employment coupled with new land releases has driven population growth and improved living standards.&quot;
===2010 to present===
Mayor Martin Lindsell was defeated in the 2010 local council election by Glenn Docherty, the council&#x27;s youngest ever mayor.

The council elected in 2010 started the creation of Playford Health Precinct around the Lyell McEwin Hospital.

The SCT Logistics Rail Freight Terminal, opened in January 2011 provided for goods and services to be transported by road and rail more efficiently and quickly. Playford is to become the logistical and advanced distribution capital of South Australia.

The A$750 million expansion within the RAAF Base Edinburgh, including facilities for 7th RAR (Mechanized Army Battalion), was largely completed in 2011.

 the council has been involved in discussions regarding expansion of the Elizabeth City Centre (the major shopping precinct in Playford) on to of land to the west of the train line.

 the Playford council is working with the South Australian Government to release of industrial land in the greater Edinburgh Parks region, with the intention of attracting and supporting 38,000 jobs in the northern part of Adelaide.

In 2011, Mayor Docherty stated he aimed to make Elizabeth the second central business district of Adelaide. He envisaged a movement away from low density commercial and &quot;quarter-acre block&quot; housing to multiple storey mixed use commercial and residential developments in Elizabeth and other central parts of the council area.

In April 2013 the council announced its 2043 Playford Community Vision.

From 2012 to 2015 the council partnered with the University of Adelaide to launch the Stretton Centre, a physical home in Playford for research into regional innovation. Its &quot;anchor tenant&quot; is the Adelaide University&#x27;s Australian Workplace Innovation &amp; Social Research Centre (WISeR). Platyford Council was assisted by a A$11.3 million grant from the Australian Government for the research centre. The Stretton Centre includes the Stretton Research Centre (occupied by WISeR), the (new) community library, public and private community meeting spaces and the Innovation Design Lab, which is to showcase new innovations and technologies in relevant to the community.

Docherty was re-elected unopposed to continue as mayor in the 2014 local government elections.

===Royal visits===
The City of Playford (and its predecessor, the City of Elizabeth) has had a number of visits by members of the Royal Family:
* 1963 visit by Queen Elizabeth II
* 1977 visit by Queen Elizabeth II
* 1986 visit by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh
* April 2014 visit by Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge

==Council==

Council consists of 16 Elected Members comprising a Mayor, and 15 Ward Councillors. The Council area is divided into five wards, with three Counicllors elected from each ward.

The current council is:

==Mayors of City of Playford==

* Marilyn Baker (1997-2006)
* Martin Lindsell (2006-2010)
* Glenn Docherty (2010 -&quot;Current&quot;)

==Demographics==
The city covers an area of , and was estimated to have a population of 93426 in 2018. Playford has been the fastest growing local government area (LGA) in South Australia over the 2010s. In the five years to 2021, the Playford LGA experienced the greatest population growth of all greater Adelaide LGAs, increasing by more than 7500 residents. However, its annual rate in the 12 months to 2021 was lower than Mount Barker, Adelaide Plains and Gawler.

<text>DDT (or ДДТ in Cyrillic) is a Russian rock band. It was founded in 1980 by its lead singer and only remaining original member, Yuri Shevchuk (), in Ufa (Bashkir ASSR, Russia, USSR).

==History==

===Ufa period (1980–1985)===
The band was formed in 1980 in Ufa, Bashkir ASSR and originally consisted of five members:
* Yuri Shevchukvocals, guitar
* Vladimir Sigachyovkeyboard
* Rustem Asanbayevguitar
* Gennady Rodinbass guitar
* Rustam Karimovpercussion

In 1982, the &quot;Komsomolskaya Pravda&quot; newspaper sponsored a competition for young musicians called (). DDT submitted three compositions&quot; (&#x27;Aliens&#x27;), &quot; (&#x27;Black Sun&#x27;), and &quot;&quot; (&#x27;Don&#x27;t Shoot!&#x27;). During the long-running competition, the group published their first album (on tape), (&quot;Pig on a Rainbow&quot;). The album contained elements of rock and roll, blues and country music. At the time, popular music in the Soviet Union was split between &quot;official&quot; performers who were admitted to the musicians&#x27; union, and underground artists. Such underground artists were often highly trained musicians who also had other jobs. A complex underground network evolved in the 1980s and &quot;unofficial&quot; music became widely distributed (though artist compensation was very limited) by magnitizdat, in a similar way to the underground channels that had existed for non-state sanctioned literature (samizdat).

DDT&#x27;s submission to reached the final round of the competition and the group was invited to perform in concert at Moscow&#x27;s Orlyonok complex, together with the other finalist, (&#x27;Rock-September&#x27;) from Cherepovets. DDT and three members of Rock-September, Vyacheslav Kobrin, Yevgeny Belozyorov and Andrey Maslennikov, soon produced a collaborative album (on tape), (&quot;Monologue in Saigon&quot;), later renamed (&quot;Compromise&quot;). After recording the album, Sigachyov and Shevchuk returned to Ufa.

Sigachyov distanced himself from the group, while Shevchuk recruited new members including Rodin, drummer Sergey Rudoy, guitarist Rustam Rezvanov and keyboard player Vladislav Senchillo.

In May 1983, DDT performed at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, as part of a three-day, sanctioned festival, &quot;&quot; (&#x27;Rock for Peace&#x27;). Their performance, however, was edited out of the official television program covering the event.

The band produced the album (&quot;Periphery&quot;) in April 1984. After recording the album, some members of the group landed on a KGB watch list and were subjected to government persecution. The band&#x27;s music was banned, forcing them to go underground.

Although they never considered themselves political activists, Shevchuk always felt it was his duty as a citizen and songwriter to address both the strengths and weaknesses of the government, a difficult stance to take due to KGB persecution. DDT continued to work as a non-conformist group, producing albums and giving concerts throughout the country. This was challenging, as they received little if any money for the records they produced during this period, and very little for their concerts. Like other dissident artists, they survived through a combination of cleverness, perseverance, and help from their fans.

Shevchuk spent some time in Sverdlovsk (now Yekaterinburg), performing with the group Urfin Juis. In November 1985, DDT covertly recorded the album (&quot;Time&quot;) in Moscow with additional musicians, but the recording process was very difficult.

===1986–1997===

In 1986, Shevchuk moved to Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg) with his wife, son and mother. The move helped him to establish himself at the forefront of the Russian rock scene as the city was the center of a musical resurgence. In 1987, he recreated DDT. Its new members included:
*Vadim Kurilevbass
*Andrei &quot;Skinny&quot; Vasilievguitar
*Igor Dotsenkodrums
*Nikita &quot;Zoltsman&quot; Zaitsevviolin, guitar
*Mikhail &quot;Uncle Misha&quot; Chernovsaxophone
*Andrey Muratovkeyboards

On January 23, 1987, the new lineup debuted on the stage of the Leningrad Rock Club. In June 1987, DDT performed at the &quot;Leningrad Rock Festival&quot; in front of a crowd of 3,000 crammed into a venue with a capacity of 1,000.

In the summer of 1988, DDT toured across Russia and recorded a new album, (&quot;I was given this role&quot;), which contained some songs from their old albums re-recorded in a professional studio. In 1988, the band also made their first visit to the US; their concert in Los Angeles was covered by MTV.

In 1989, they went on tour with the band Alisa, performing at a rock festival in Hungary. In 1990, DDT performed several concerts in the US and Japan. Also in 1990 the band released (&quot;Thaw&quot;), which presented their first concert from Saint Petersburg. They also participated in a Viktor Tsoi tribute concert, after the renowned singer-songwriter died in a car accident on August 15, 1990.

After the Soviet Union&#x27;s collapse in 1991, DDT attracted an even greater following both at home and abroad, as their albums and concerts began to be broadcast and publicized more widely. In 1991, the band recorded another album, the keyboard-heavy (&quot;A crawling soldier&quot;; originally the name of a Cossack infantry unit), but after many months of work Shevchuk decided to shelve it and the album was not released until 1995, four years later.

In 1992 DDT released the album (&quot;Spring the Actress&quot;). This lyrical album, which was dedicated to Shevchuk&#x27;s deceased wife, Elmira, met with great success. It contained some of the band&#x27;s greatest hits, including &quot; (&#x27;What is autumn&#x27;), &quot; (&#x27;Rain&#x27;), and &quot;&quot; (&#x27;Motherland&#x27;). After releasing the album, the band toured extensively. Soon afterwards it began to change its sound and performance strategy by adding &quot;programmes&quot;conceptually prepared concertsto its repertoire. During December 1992 and January 1993, DDT presented its first program, (&#x27;Black Mongrel Petersburg&#x27;), and toured widely in CIS countries. On May 27, 1993, on the anniversary of the founding of Saint Petersburg, the band performed a free concert in Dvortsovaya Square, which was attended by 120,000 people.
In the beginning of 1994, a new album, (&quot;That&#x27;s all...&quot;), was recorded. The musicians had planned to make a double album, but because of challenging deadlines and an unstable lineup, a significant amount of early musical material and recordings did not make it into the final version. Years later, the songs were included in the band&#x27;s (&quot;Born in the USSR&quot;) album.

During the summer of 1994, DDT took part in the White Nights of Saint Petersburg rock festival in Berlin. That autumn, the group was awarded the Ovatsiya (&#x27;Ovation&#x27;) award for Best Rock Group of the Year. Yuri Shevchuk was also named Best Rock Musician of the Year.

In January 1995, during First Chechen War, Shevchuk went on a peace mission to Chechnya, where he performed 50 concerts for Russian troops and Chechen citizens alike. On June 25, 1995, DDT performed a 15th anniversary concert in Petrovsky Stadium, attracting an audience of tens of thousands of fans. Afterwards, the group toured with its newest programme, (&#x27;From and to&#x27;). At the end of the winter of 1995–1996, the group spent time working in a recording studio in the US.

In February–March 1996, DDT recorded a new album, (&quot;Love&quot;), at Long View Farm in Massachusetts with two new musicians: bassist I. Tikhomirov (from the group Kino) and keyboard player D. Galitsky.

In the summer of 1996, after returning from the US, the group headlined several festivals, including VladiROCKstok, the first large-scale international music festival in the formerly closed city of Vladivostok on the Sea of Japan.

===1998–2004===

In May 1998, the band released a new album titled &quot;Mir nomer nol&#x27;&quot; (&quot;World number zero&quot;)a concept album which contained influences from industrial music and relied heavily on electronic, computer-generated music. With this program DDT lost some of their old fans but found a huge success among younger listenerswhich Shevchuk and DDT were very pleased by. The &quot;Mir nomer nol&quot; tour included about 70 cities in Russia and overseas. A new album, &quot;Metel&#x27; avgusta&quot; (&quot;Snowstorm of August&quot;), contained mostly outtakes from &quot;Mir nomer nol&quot; as well as more lyrical songs.

Since then, the band has won a number of Russian music awards and been awarded humanitarian citations for their creative and charitable work. Shevchuk and his group also regularly travel throughout the CIS and other former Soviet republics giving benefit concerts. In the spring and summer of 2002, 10 out of 11 concerts the band played were benefits for various social and cultural organizations. The band has reached an ever-growing audience in the US and Europe, and in the first two decades of the 21st century have traveled frequently throughout the world, playing concerts and gaining new fans. Shevchuk&#x27;s music and lyrics are not only influenced by traditional Western rock music, but also by the entire scope of Russian folk, classical, and religious music. In many respects, Shevchuk&#x27;s initial years of struggle as an underground musicians shaped his and, by extension, the band&#x27;s philosophy toward their art. The question of the music&#x27;s marketability was never part of the song writing process as there was no market in which to compete but only an allegiance to the purity of artistic expression.

In 2002 and 2003 DDT released a double album called &quot;Yedinochestvo&quot; (&quot;Loneliness/Singleness&quot;), which was even more experimental than &quot;Mir nomer nol&quot;. After the following tour, Vadim Kurilev, the band&#x27;s guitarist and bassist from its original Saint Petersburg lineup, left the group to begin a solo career. One of Kurilev&#x27;s last performances as a DDT member was released on the CD &quot;Gorod bez okon&quot; (&quot;A city without windows&quot;).

===2005–present===
In 2005, DDT celebrated their 25th anniversary with an extended tour throughout Russia, Europe, and North America, and the release of a new album entitled &quot;Propavshiy bez vesti&quot; (&quot;Vanished without a trace&quot;), which received critical acclaim.

In 2007 DDT released the album &quot;Prekrasnaya lyubov&quot; (&quot;Beautiful love&quot;), a collection of previously unreleased songs which had been performed by the group for many years in addition to several new songs. The album differs from previous albums, representing a greater focus on political and social themes versus the more common ideas in their other albums. Many songs are in the chanson style.

On March 3, 2008, DDT performed at the Dissenters&#x27; March in St. Petersburg to protest the controversial election of Dmitry Medvedev as President of Russia. Subsequently, in May 2010 Shevchuk received considerable media attention following a pointed dialogue with Prime Minister Vladimir Putin in which he openly confronted him (on state television) with questions regarding such controversial topics as democracy, freedom of speech, assembly, and freedom of the press in Russia.

On September 24 and 26, 2008, DDT presented an anti-war program called &quot;Ne streliaj!&quot; (&quot;Don&#x27;t Shoot!&quot;). These concerts (featuring bands from Georgia, South Ossetia and Ukraine) were dedicated to the casualties of wars, particularly victims of the war in South Ossetia. The concert in Petersburg was shown on TV by Channel 5 without commercial breaks.

In the summer of 2009, DDT participated in the &quot;Rok nad Volgoy&quot; festival (&quot;Rock above the Volga&quot;) in Samara and in the international music festival &quot;Sotvorenie mira&quot; (&quot;World creation&quot;) in Kazan. On September 2, 2009, the band performed on VVC Square to protest the demolition of historical buildings in Moscow.
By the time DDT began to record its next studio album, Shevchuk was the only member left from its original Petersburg line-up. He brought together a brand new team:
* Konstantin &quot;The Cat&quot; Shumailov - keyboards;
* Alex Fedichev - lead guitar;
* Artyom Mamay - drums, vibraphone;
* Roman Nevelev - bass;
* Anton Vishnyakov - trombone, tambourine, shaker;
* Alena Romanova - backing vocals

In 2011, DDT released the concept album &quot;Inache&quot; (&quot;Otherwise&quot;). According to Shevchuk, the album&#x27;s central theme is freedom in all its forms and the lyrical hero is a Prince Hamlet of the 21st century which has no doubt regarding the question &quot;To be, or not to be?&quot;. He clearly knows: &quot;To be!&quot;, but the question remains - &quot;In which way?&quot;
The band embarked on a large, successful tour which lasted from 2011 to 2014. On April 5, 2012, DDT released a film titled &quot;Nebo pod serdtsem&quot; (&quot;The Sky Under the Heart&quot;) a compilation of behind-the-scenes and concert footage from the band&#x27;s performance at the &quot;Olympic Stadium&quot;. This was the first multiple-camera concert films made in Russia. Later that year, the band took part in the rock festival &quot;The Best City UA&quot; in Dnipropetrovsk. In 2013, the band toured in Germany, performing at Tempodrom in Berlin and at Grugahalle in Essen. A concert in Essen was later released on CD+DVD in 2014.

DDT always was and still is one of the most popular rock groups in Russia, and their concerts typically attract tens of thousands of fans. Shevchuk put together the first incarnation of the band in the summer of 1980, and although its members have changed over the years, he continues to voice the concerns and frustrations of the Russian people in his music today just as he did in the band&#x27;s infancy. The more than 20 albums in DDT&#x27;s discography not only chronicle the history of a rock group, but also provide poignant narratives that examine many aspects of life in the Soviet Union and Russia during the past 35 years.

<text>William Charles Williams VC (15 September 1880 – 25 April 1915) was a British recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Biography==
Williams was born at Stanton Lacy near Ludlow in Shropshire, England, son of William and his wife Elizabeth Williams. He was raised in Chepstow, Monmouthshire, Wales, to which his parents moved when he was aged seven or eight years.

After employment as a gardener and labourer he joined the Royal Navy Boys Service in Portsmouth in 1895 and was promoted to Boy first class in 1896, Seaman in 1898 and Able Seaman in 1901. He was commended for his bravery when serving aboard &quot;HMS &quot;Terrible&quot;&quot; in the Naval Brigade off South Africa during the Second Boer War and in China during the Boxer Rising.

He left the regular service in 1910, joining the Royal Naval Reserve and working in the police force and in a steel works in Newport. He rejoined the Navy in 1914 on being mobilised at the start of the First World War. During his career, he served on eighteen different ships, some more than once.

==Victoria Cross==
He was 34 years old when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC. On 25 April 1915 during the landing on V Beach, Cape Helles, Gallipoli, Turkey, Williams, with three other men (George Leslie Drewry, Wilfred St. Aubyn Malleson and George McKenzie Samson) was assisting the commander (Edward Unwin) of their ship, HMS &quot;River Clyde&quot; (previously the SS River Clyde) at the work of securing the lighters. He held on to a rope for over an hour, standing chest deep in the sea, under continuous enemy fire. He was eventually seriously wounded by a shell, later dying whilst his rescue was being effected by the commander who described him as the bravest sailor he had ever met.

==Memorials==
As he had no known grave he is listed on the Commonwealth War Graves Commission&#x27;s Portsmouth Naval Memorial.

There are two memorials to him in Chepstow – a painting by Charles Dixon of the events in the Dardanelles, hanging in St Mary&#x27;s Church; and a naval gun from the German submarine SM &quot;UB-91&quot; presented by King George V, which stands in the town&#x27;s main square beside the war memorial. In Shropshire, a memorial plaque was affixed to the parish war memorial in the churchyard at Stanton Lacy, and following the centenary of his award a VC commemoration stone was erected in the same village, inlaid in the wall near the gate of the village cemetery.

<text>Lucas Valley is a valley in Marin County, California, drained to the east into San Pablo Bay by Miller Creek, as well as an unincorporated community in the valley, which forms part of the Lucas Valley-Marinwood CDP.

Lucas Valley Road traverses the length of the valley, linking it to Gallinas Valley to the east and Nicasio Valley to the west. According to the United States Geological Survey, the suburban developments along Miller Creek (including the Lucas Valley-Marinwood CDP) are actually in Gallinas Valley.

==History==
Lucas Valley was part of the Rancho San Pedro, Santa Margarita y Las Gallinas grant, a parcel of awarded to Timothy (Don Timoteo) Murphy on February 14, 1844. John Lucas inherited the Santa Margarita rancho (which included Lucas Valley) in 1853.

In 1978, film director George Lucas began acquiring land in the area for his Skywalker Ranch. However, Lucas Valley Road was named after the 19th-century rancher, who is not related to George Lucas.

<doc id="1189161" wikidata="Q4997878" url="?curid=1189161" title="Pyramids of Mars">
<text>Pyramids of Mars is the third serial of the 13th season of the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. Written by Robert Holmes and Lewis Greifer under the pseudonym of &quot;Stephen Harris&quot; and directed by Paddy Russell, the serial was first broadcast in four weekly parts on BBC1 from 25 October to 15 November 1975.

The serial is set in the year 1911 in England, Egypt, and Mars. In the serial, the burial chamber of the alien Sutekh, the inspiration for the Egyptian god Set, is unearthed by the archaeology professor Marcus Scarman. Alive but immobilised, Sutekh seeks his freedom by using Professor Scarman as his servant to destroy the jewel in a pyramid on Mars which is keeping him prisoner.

Influenced by the gothic horror genre and films such as &quot;The Mummy&quot;, the serial was met with widespread critical acclaim, being praised for its atmosphere and production. It marks the first appearance of Sutekh, who returned to the series 49 years later in the two-part story &quot;The Legend of Ruby Sunday&quot; / &quot;Empire of Death&quot; (2024).

==Plot==

In 1911 Egypt, archaeology professor Marcus Scarman excavates a pyramid and finds the door to the burial chamber is inscribed with the Eye of Horus. He enters the chamber and is hit by a beam of green light.

The Fourth Doctor is pulled off his flight path, and Sarah Jane Smith sees an apparition in the console room. The two are found by a butler, who reveals they are in the Scarman estate, which has been taken over by the mysterious Ibrahim Namin, claiming to represent Scarman. Scarman&#x27;s friend, Dr Warlock, has also arrived at the estate to demand an explanation on Scarman&#x27;s whereabouts. Namin threatens Warlock with a revolver, with the Doctor and Sarah barely managing to save him. The three escape and reach the estate lodge inhabited by Scarman&#x27;s brother Laurence, whose marconiscope intercepted a signal from Mars.

The Doctor decodes the signal as &quot;Beware Sutekh&quot;, explaining that Sutekh is the last of a powerful alien race called the Osirans. Imprisoned by his brother Horus, using the Eye of Horus, they were the inspiration for ancient Egyptian mythology. Sutekh&#x27;s servant arrives via a spacetime tunnel portal, accompanied by robots disguised as mummies. He kills Namin and is revealed to be Scarman, now a corpse animated by Sutekh&#x27;s will. Scarman secures the estate&#x27;s perimeter with a forcefield, and begins to hunt down the humans. Scarman finds and kills Warlock, but is then ordered by Sutekh to prioritise the construction of an Osirian war missile aimed at Mars.

Following another attack by the robots, the Doctor decides to blow up the rocket, and Laurence suggests using gelignite, kept in the poacher&#x27;s hut. The Doctor and Sarah Jane leave to obtain the gelignite. Scarman soon arrives at the lodge, and Laurence attempts to rekindle his brother&#x27;s humanity, but gets strangled instead. The Doctor sets up the explosives, with Sarah Jane detonating it with a rifle. Sutekh telekinetically suppresses the explosion. Left with but one option, the Doctor uses the space-time tunnel to reach Sutekh and break his concentration, allowing the explosion to destroy the rocket. A furious Sutekh turns the Doctor into a to transport Scarman to Mars.

Arriving on Mars, Scarman strangles the Doctor. However, the Doctor&#x27;s respiratory bypass system allows him to recover and become free of Sutekh&#x27;s control. He is however unable to stop Scarman from destroying the Eye, and Scarman disintegrates. The Doctor realises that Sutekh will not be released instantaneously due to the travel time required for the Eye&#x27;s radio signal. Returning to the estate, he uses the TARDIS to extend the time tunnel into the far future, eventually resulting in Sutekh dying of old age before he reaches the end. This overloads the portal, the estate is consumed in flames, and the Doctor and Sarah flee in the TARDIS.

==Production==
===Writing===
The Universal Pictures film &quot;The Mummy&quot; (1932) and especially the Hammer horror films &quot;The Mummy&quot; (1959) and &quot;Blood from the Mummy&#x27;s Tomb&quot; (1971) influenced the story. It was originally written by Lewis Greifer, who had been approached by script editor Robert Holmes, his former colleague at ATV. However, it was considered unusable as a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; script, even after multiple rewrites, due to Greifer&#x27;s unfamiliarity with &quot;Doctor Who&quot;; Holmes took over, with Greifer retaining the option to have his name on the script. While he retained the basic premise, he completely altered other aspects, which included making the &quot;Osirians&quot; a powerful alien race, and changing the setting to 1911, instead of a more contemparary time. The pseudonym used on transmission was Stephen Harris. 

Although the name of Sutekh&#x27;s race is pronounced &quot;Osiran&quot; throughout the serial, the scripts and publicity material spell it as &quot;Osirian&quot; in some places and as &quot;Osiran&quot; in others.

===Casting===
Bernard Archard, who had previously appeared in &quot;The Power of the Daleks&quot; (1966), was cast as Marcus Scarman, due to his work on the 1970 horror film &quot;The Horror of Frankenstein&quot;. Michael Sheard, who had also previously featured in two &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serials, was cast as Laurence Scarman; production assistant Peter Grimwade had recommended him for the role because of his recent performance in the BBC2 show &quot;Lord Peter Wimsey&quot;.

Gabriel Woolf, a prominent BBC actor, was cast in the role of the villain Sutekh. Woolf would go on to reprise his role in audio dramas by Magic Bullet Productions and Big Finish Productions in 2015; and on television in the two-part series 14 finale &quot;The Legend of Ruby Sunday&quot; / &quot;Empire of Death&quot; in 2024, in which Sutekh appeared as the main villain. He also provided the voice of Sutekh for the comedy sketch &quot;Oh Mummy: Sutekh&#x27;s Story&quot;, included on the 2004 DVD release of &quot;Pyramids of Mars&quot;. Woolf would also go on to provide the voice of &quot;The Beast&quot; in the 2006 episodes &quot;The Impossible Planet&quot; and &quot;The Satan Pit&quot;.

===Filming and post-production===
The exterior scenes were shot on the Stargroves estate in Hampshire, a Victorian mansion noted for its ornate, Gothic revival style of architecture which was owned by Mick Jagger at the time. The interior shots, as well as model filming, took place in the BBC Television Centre. Exterior scenes were filmed between 29 May and 2 June, and the interior shots between 7 May and 3 June. Tom Baker and Elisabeth Sladen improvised and added a number of moments in this story, most notably a scene in Part Four where the Doctor and Sarah Jane start to walk out of their hiding place and then when they see a mummy, quickly dart back into it. Baker based the scene on a Marx Brothers routine. Sarah Jane wears a dress which the Doctor says belonged to former companion Victoria Waterfield.

A number of scenes used the colour-separation overlay (CSO) system, including the sarcophagus, which was made to look like it was pulsating with energy; to show the ravaged Earth and the Egyptians settings; and for Sutekh&#x27;s monitoring systems. It was also used to insert eerie glowing as well as bizarre, swirling patterns to the background. The flame effect at the end of the serial was achieved by using CSO effects, as well as a controlled fire, which was the largest staged fire in the studio at the time.

Several scenes were deleted from the final broadcast. A model shot of the TARDIS landing in the landscape of a barren, alternative 1980 Earth was to be used in Part Two, but director Paddy Russell decided viewers would feel more impact if the first scene of the new Earth was Sarah&#x27;s reaction as the TARDIS doors opened. Three scenes of effects such as doors opening and the Doctor materializing from the sarcophagus were also removed from the final edit of Part Four because Russell felt the mixes were not good enough.

==Broadcast and reception==
The story was edited and condensed into a single, one-hour omnibus episode, broadcast on BBC1 at 5:50 pm on 27 November 1976, reaching 13.7 million viewers, the highest audience achieved by &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in its entire history at that time.

===Critical reception===
In 1985, Colin Greenland reviewed &quot;Pyramids of Mars&quot; for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, and stated that it was &quot;&quot;Dr Who&quot; at its eclectic best [...] A yeasty brew of Hammer horror, Egyptian mythology, and sf with a touch of H. G. Wells.&quot; Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping gave the serial a positive review in &quot;The Discontinuity Guide&quot; (1995), praising the &quot;chilling&quot; adversary and some of the conversations. In &quot;The Television Companion&quot; (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker described the first episode as &quot;an excellent scene-setter&quot; and the story as &quot;near-flawless&quot;. They wrote that &quot;Pyramids of Mars&quot; gave the &quot;fullest expression&quot; of the Gothic horror era and had high production values and a good guest cast.

In 2010, Patrick Mulkern of &quot;Radio Times&quot; called it &quot;a bona fide classic&quot; with &quot;arguably the most polished production to date&quot;, and praised the powerful plot. However, he disliked how UNIT was dismissed in the season, and found &quot;minor, amusing quibbles&quot; with the plot. Charlie Jane Anders of &quot;Gizmodo&quot; described &quot;Pyramids of Mars&quot; as &quot;just a lovely, solid adventure story&quot;, highlighting the way the Doctor seemed outmatched, the pace, and Sarah Jane. In a 2010 article, Anders also listed the cliffhanger to the third episode — in which the Doctor is forced to confront Sutekh — as one of the greatest &quot;Doctor Who&quot; cliffhangers ever. In a 2014 &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; poll to determine the best &quot;Doctor Who&quot; stories of all time, readers voted &quot;Pyramids of Mars&quot; to eighth place. In 2018, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; ranked &quot;Pyramids of Mars&quot; at number 18 in &quot;the 56 greatest stories and episodes&quot;, stating that &quot;although the mummies are excellent, it is the organic characters who take centre stage, with Baker cementing the increasing alienness of his portrayal of the hero&quot;. They concluded that it was &quot;pure gold&quot;.

In &quot;A Critical History of Doctor Who on Television&quot;, John Kenneth Muir queried the Egyptian mythology conceit that is woven through the whole story; he also questioned a number of apparently illogical story elements, such as why the robots that guard the priory were disguised as Egyptian mummies, and why the Osiran rocket was shaped as a pyramid. In his assessment, the use of ancient Egyptian objects and symbols by the Osiran race was inadequately explained in the script, and he contrasted &quot;Pyramids of Mars&quot; unfavourably with &quot;Stargate&quot;, a 1994 television series which relied heavily on the concept of ancient astronauts visiting Earth. Muir traced parallels with earlier &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serials such as &quot;The Dæmons&quot; (1971) and &quot;Terror of the Zygons&quot; (1975) which had also drawn on the idea of ancient Earth mythologies having extraterrestrial origins. Like &quot;The Dæmons&quot; and &quot;The Tomb of the Cybermen&quot; (1967), &quot;Pyramids of Mars&quot; exploited many familiar conventions of classic mummy films, but less successfully in Muir&#x27;s view.

John J Johnston, vice-chair of the Egypt Exploration Society, explored the influences on &quot;Pyramids of Mars&quot; in the &quot;Encyclopedia of Mummies in History, Religion, and Popular Culture&quot;. He observed that the story drew heavily on a number of classic horror films such as Universal&#x27;s &quot;The Mummy&quot; (1932) and Hammer&#x27;s &quot;The Mummy&quot; (1959), in both its setting and the performance of the actors. Johnston also noted the influences of archaeology on the production design. According to Johnston, the robot mummies designed by the BBC&#x27;s Barbara Kidd were inspired by an ancient rock painting of a mysterious domed-headed figure that had been discovered by Henri Lhote in the Sahara Desert in the 1950s, and which Lhote had nicknamed &quot;the Great Martian God&quot;. Similarly, he considered Sutekh&#x27;s mask to have been modelled on a statue of a bearded man dating from c.3500 BCE that had been excavated at Gebelein by Louis Lortet in 1908.

==Commercial releases==

===In print===

A novelisation of this serial, written by Terrance Dicks, was published by Target Books in December 1976. The novelisation contains a substantial prologue giving the history of Sutekh and the Osirans and features an epilogue in which a future Sarah researches the destruction of the Priory and how it was explained. An unabridged reading of the novelisation by actor Tom Baker was released on CD in August 2008. &quot;Pyramids of Mars&quot; was reprinted in the second volume of &quot;The Essential Terrance Dicks&quot;, published on 26 August 2021 by BBC books.

A prequel/sequel to this story, called &quot;The Sands of Time&quot;, written by Justin Richards, was released in 1996. Published by Virgin Books, it starred the Fifth Doctor.

===Home media===
The story first came out on VHS and Betamax in an omnibus format in February 1985, one of the first serials to do so. It was subsequently released in episodic format in February 1994. It was released on DVD in the United Kingdom on 1 March 2004, containing commentary and behind the scenes footage. It was also released on 31 October 2011 as an extra on &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot; Series 4 DVD and Blu-ray boxset.

In 2013 it was released on DVD again in the US as part of the &quot;Doctor Who: The Doctors Revisited 1–4&quot; box set, alongside &quot;The Aztecs&quot;, &quot;The Tomb of the Cybermen&quot; and &quot;Spearhead from Space&quot;. Alongside a documentary on the Fourth Doctor, the disc features the serial put together as a single feature in widescreen format with an introduction from show runner at the time Steven Moffat, as well as its original version.

<doc id="1189164" wikidata="Q11252" url="?curid=1189164" title="Upper Manhattan">
<text>Upper Manhattan is the northern section of the New York City borough of Manhattan. Its southern boundary has been variously defined, but some of the most common usages are 96th Street, 110th Street (the northern boundary of Central Park), 125th Street, or 155th Street. The term Uptown can refer to Upper Manhattan, but is often used more generally for neighborhoods above 59th Street; in the broader definition, Uptown encompasses Upper Manhattan.

Upper Manhattan is generally taken to include the neighborhoods of Manhattan Inwood, Washington Heights (including Fort George, Sherman Creek and Hudson Heights), Harlem (including Sugar Hill, Hamilton Heights and Manhattanville), East Harlem, Morningside Heights, and Manhattan Valley (in the Upper West Side).

The George Washington Bridge connects Washington Heights in Upper Manhattan across the Hudson River to Fort Lee, New Jersey, and is the world&#x27;s busiest motor vehicle bridge.

In the late 19th century, the IRT Ninth Avenue Line and other elevated railroads brought people to the previously rustic Upper Manhattan. Until the late 20th century it was less influenced by the gentrification that had taken place in other parts of New York over the previous 30 years.

== Tourist attractions ==
Like other residential areas, Upper Manhattan is not a major center of tourism in New York City, although many tourist attractions lie within it, such as Grant&#x27;s Tomb, the Apollo Theater, United Palace, and The Cloisters, Sylvia&#x27;s Restaurant, the Hamilton Grange, the Morris–Jumel Mansion, Minton&#x27;s Playhouse, Sugar Hill, Riverside Church, the National Jazz Museum in Harlem, and the Dyckman House, along with Fort Tryon Park, most of Riverside Park, Riverbank State Park, Sakura Park, and other parks.

<doc id="1189170" wikidata="Q7235253" url="?curid=1189170" title="Potter Box">
<text>The Potter Box is a model for making ethical decisions, developed by Ralph B. Potter, Jr., professor of social ethics emeritus at Harvard Divinity School. It is commonly used by communication ethics scholars. According to this model, moral thinking should be a systematic process and how we come to decisions must be based in some reasoning.

==Steps==
The Potter Box is an ethical framework used to make decisions by utilizing four categories which Potter identifies as universal to all ethical dilemmas. Potter was a theologian when he developed this moral reasoning framework. The Potter Box uses four dimensions of moral analysis to help in situations where ethical dilemmas occur: Facts, Values, Principles, and Loyalties as described below. 
The Potter Box consists of a few simple steps, which can be completed in any order. You may also move between the steps several times before an adequate decision is made. The steps are numbered for simplicity&#x27;s sake, and it may help you to organize the steps into quadrants (Cliff Christens came up with this idea).

===Definition / Facts===
The definition stage of the Potter Box concerns the facts of the issue at hand. Here is where the analyst should set out all facts without making judgments or hiding any facts. 
Example: Using a photograph of a car wreck to promote safe driving, making it visible to the target viewers.

===Values===
At this stage the analyst should state and compare the merits of different values to acknowledge the influences on decision-making. By referring to the specific concerns of the individuals involved, it allows the analyst to identify differences in perspectives.
We may judge something according to aesthetic values (harmonious, pleasing), professional values (innovative, prompt), logical values (consistent, competent), sociocultural values (thrift, hard work), and moral values (honesty, nonviolence).

Example (continued)- Will the shock value of the images encourage safe driving habits? Will the images stir up potentially disturbing memories for certain people?

===Principles===
Principles are ethical philosophies or modes of ethical reasoning that may be applicable to the situation. By considering the values stated above from several ethical philosophies, the decision-maker is better equipped to understand the situation. The following are some of the ethical philosophies that may be utilized under this segment of Potter&#x27;s Box:

* Aristotle&#x27;s Golden Mean. Aristotle&#x27;s Golden Mean defines moral virtue as a middle state determined by practical wisdom that emphasizes moderation and temperance.
* Confucius&#x27; Golden Mean. Confucius&#x27; Golden Mean is more commonly known as the compromise principle and says moral virtue is the appropriate location between two extremes.
* Kant&#x27;s Categorical Imperative. Kant&#x27;s Categorical Imperative dictates that you must do unto others what you would want them to do unto you, or to act as if your personal decisions and actions could become universal law.
* Mill&#x27;s Principle of Utility. John Stuart Mill&#x27;s Principle of Utility dictates that we must seek the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people.
* Rawls&#x27; Veil of Ignorance. John Rawls&#x27; Veil of Ignorance asks us to assume we don&#x27;t know which stakeholder position we would find ourselves in, removing our personal interests from the analysis.
* Agape Principle. This principle, also known as the &#x27;Persons as Ends&#x27; principle, emphasizes love for our fellow humans and the golden rule. He stresses that when we love our neighbors, we shall seek to do good to them, therefore, we should love fellow humans the same way we love ourselves.

These help link concrete options to overarching principles, getting us to think about our own basic values.

===Loyalties===
Loyalties concern who the decision-maker has allegiances or loyalties to. For example, in journalism, the first allegiance is always to the public. Other allegiances a journalist might have would be to his or her employer, industry organizations or co-workers. Are we more concerned about being true to our own values or about the effectiveness of the campaign? Is the &quot;greater good&quot; more important than the &quot;golden mean&quot;?

===Understanding Values===
To understand the Potter Box method, you must first understand types of Values categorized that influence Ethical behavior:

Professional.
Proximity, Firstness, Impact/ magnitude, Recency, Conflict, Human Interest, Entertainment, Novelty, Toughness, Thoroughness, Immediacy, Independence, No prior restraint, Public’s right to know

Moral Values.
Truth-telling, Humanness, Justice/fairness, Freedom, Independence, Stewardship, Honesty, Nonviolence, Commitment, Self-control

Aesthetic.
Harmonious, Pleasing, Imaginative

Logical.
Consistent, Competent, Knowledgeable

Socio-cultural.
Thrift, Hard work, Energy, Restraint

==Using the Potter Box==
The Potter Box focuses on moral issues as opposed to pragmatic or legal ones, such as how to avoid getting sued or fired. With regard to ethics, however, it can be used to reflect on any situation that requires moral decision-making. Its four steps, at least initially, should be followed in order.

The Potter Box does not offer a single, clear-cut solution to ethical dilemmas. Indeed, two different people analyzing the same issue with the Potter Box could arrive at two very different conclusions. Moreover, the same person analyzing the same issue could come to different decisions when using the Box at two different times. Nevertheless, the Potter Box can help you think through what to do. It offers a process to help you weigh your options in a methodical manner.

In addition, the name &quot;Potter Box&quot; may indicate that this process is very rigid, but in fact it is fluid, and you may have to go back and forth among the steps before you can reach a conclusion that satisfies you. This process also becomes easier and quicker with practice. Over time, it can become second nature.

<text>The Chrysomeloidea are an enormous superfamily of beetles, with tens of thousands of species. The largest families are Cerambycidae, long-horned beetles, with more than 35,000 species, and Chrysomelidae, leaf beetles, with more than 13,000 species.

==Overview==
The Chrysomeloidea, like all other Phytophaga, typically have the fourth tarsal segment reduced and hidden by the third segment. Several species in these two families are important plant pests. The spotted cucumber beetle is a serious pest of vegetables and is a very common insect on all sorts of flowers. The Colorado potato beetle, &quot;Leptinotarsa decemlineata&quot;, attacks potatoes and other members of the Solanaceae. The Asian long-horned beetle is a serious pest of trees where it has been introduced. . It seems almost evident that during the Jurassic and the Cretaceous the Chrysomelidae were pollen feeders and then they became external and later on internal feeders on or in leaves, buds, twigs and roots.

Some authorities in the past have suggested removing the Cerambycidae and related families (Disteniidae, Oxypeltidae, and Vesperidae) from Chrysomeloidea to create a separate superfamily &quot;Cerambycoidea&quot; (e.g.,), but in the absence of evidence to support the monophyly of the resulting groups, this proposal has not been widely accepted by the scientific community.

<text>William Williams VC, DSM &amp; Bar (5 October 1890 – 22 October 1965), was a Welsh recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to a member of the British and Commonwealth armed forces.

He was from Amlwch on Anglesey and at age 26 was serving as a seaman in the Royal Naval Reserve during the First World War when the following deed took place:

* On 7 June 1917, HMS &quot;Pargust&quot; (a Q ship) was out in the Atlantic Ocean when her engine room was damaged by a torpedo fired from the U-boat . The explosion loosened the gun covers and Seaman Williams, with great presence of mind, took the whole weight on himself and physically prevented the covers from falling and betraying the ship to the enemy.

The Pargust&#x27;s &#x27;panic party&#x27;, the decoy crew carried on every Q ship for the purpose of leaving it apparently abandoned when attacked, took to the lifeboats and the U-boat then surfaced, believing the Pargust to be a crewless and defenceless merchant vessel. When the U-boat was about away, the captain of &quot; HMS Pargust&quot; gave the order to fire and the submarine was blown up and sank.

In the case of a gallant and daring act in which all men are deemed equally brave and deserving of the Victoria Cross a secret ballot is drawn. The crew of &quot; HMS Pargust&quot; selected William Williams to be the recipient of the award due to a rating in the action.

==Honours and awards==
*23 March 1917 - Distinguished Service Medal - 
*20 July 1917 - Victoria Cross -

<text>StarHub Limited, commonly known as StarHub, is a Singaporean multinational telecommunications conglomerate and one of the major telcos operating in the country. Founded in 1998, it is listed on the Singapore Exchange (SGX).

==History==
===Early years===
StarHub was awarded the license to provide fixed networks and mobile services on 23 April 1998, when the government announced that the telecommunications sector in Singapore would be completely liberalised by 2002. In 2000, the government announced the date for complete liberalisation would be brought forward to 1 April 2000, and the 49% cap on foreign ownership of public telecommunications companies in Singapore would be lifted. StarHub was officially launched on 1 April 2000 with ST Telemedia, Singapore Power, BT Group and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) as its major shareholders.

On 21 January 1999, StarHub acquired internet service provider CyberWay and it became a subsidiary within the StarHub group. It was renamed as StarHub Internet on 3 December 1999 in a move to integrate CyberWay into the StarHub brand.

===2000s===
In 2001, Singapore Power divested its shares in StarHub and sold its 25.5% stake to ST Telemedia for S$400 million. BT Group subsequently divested its 18% stake as a result of consolidation, after accumulating debt acquired during the bidding round for 3G licences in the United Kingdom.

On 1 October 2002, the company merged with Singapore&#x27;s sole cable television operator, Singapore Cable Vision. As a result of the merger, it acquired SCV&#x27;s cable television as well as broadband internet access operations.

StarHub was publicly listed on the Singapore Exchange on 13 October 2004.

On 12 January 2007, StarHub announced a &#x27;Strategic Alliance&#x27; with Qatar Telecom.

On 1 May 2009, the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore announced that StarHub&#x27;s wholly owned subsidiary, Nucleus Connect, was selected as the Operating Company (OpCo) to design, build and operate the active infrastructure of the Next Generation Nationwide Broadband Network (Next Gen NBN). Next Gen NBN is now simply known as Nationwide Broadband Network or NBN.

On 14 July 2009, StarHub announced the retirement of long-standing chief executive Terry Clontz. Neil Montefiore, the former chief executive of the country&#x27;s smallest telecommunications company M1 Limited, took over as chief executive officer on 1 January 2010. Terry Clontz remains as a non-executive director of StarHub.

On 1 August 2009, StarHub relocated its corporate office to StarHub Green building at Ubi from its previous office location at StarHub building at Cuppage.

===2010s===
On 7 February 2013, StarHub announced the retirement of Neil Montefiore as chief executive officer by end February 2013. StarHub&#x27;s chief operating officer Tan Tong Hai was appointed CEO on 1 March 2013.

On 13 July 2015, StarHub announced the retirement of Tan Guong Ching as chairman. StarHub&#x27;s former chief executive officer Terry Clontz was appointed chairman on 15 July 2015.

In December 2016, StarHub&#x27;s new innovation centre and converged operations cockpit Hubtricty went operational. Located at Mediapolis@one-north, the facility also contains a co-working space and data analytics centre.

===2020s===

On 29 April 2020, a joint venture between StarHub and M1 Limited was awarded a license to create a 5G network in Singapore by the Singapore Government.

In August 2021, Starhub announced that it will be launching Nvidia&#x27;s GeForce Now in Singapore, the first country in the region and the only local operator in the country to introduce the cloud gaming service.

On 17 February 2022, StarHub was introduced as a programme partner for DBS #CyberWellness.

In March 2022, IMDA approves deal for StarHub to buy a majority stake in MyRepublic business. In an article written by Straits Times, &quot;The Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) has approved local telco StarHub&#x27;s proposal to buy a majority 50.1 per cent stake in rival Internet service provider MyRepublic&#x27;s fibre broadband business for residential and enterprise customers in Singapore.&quot; The proposed transaction was announced by StarHub and MyRepublic in September last year. At the time, the deal was worth $70.8 million. This would grow Starhub broadband market share from 34% to about 40% in Singapore.

==Subsidiaries==
The StarHub group consists of several subsidiaries, which include:
==Network==
==Services==

===Mobile services===
StarHub provides mobile services through its subsidiary StarHub Mobile. Since its launch on 1 April 2000, StarHub has been Singapore&#x27;s fastest growing mobile operator. It has close to two million customers and is the second largest mobile network operator with close to 30% market share.

On 27 May 2003, it became the first mobile operator in Singapore to commercially launch BlackBerry, a hand-held wireless device providing e-mail, telephone, text messaging, web browsing and other wireless data access. Customers trials of 3G services began in November 2004, and was released in April 2005.

In January 2005, StarHub announced that it would form an exclusive strategic partnership for i-mode in Singapore with NTT DoCoMo, a subsidiary of StarHub&#x27;s major shareholder NTT. Customer trials started in October 2005, and the service was launched on 18 November.

On 15 July 2009, StarHub became the first mobile operator in the Asia Pacific region to commercially launch a HSPA+ service. Branded as &quot;MaxMobile Elite&quot;, StarHub&#x27;s HSPA+ service offers download speeds up to 21 Mbit/s nationwide.

On 19 September 2012, StarHub began the enhancement of its high-speed mobile broadband network with Long Term Evolution (LTE) and Dual Cell High-Speed Packet Access Plus (DC-HSPA+), which improved peak downlink speeds of up to 75 Mbit/s and 42 Mbit/s respectively.

On 7 March 2013, StarHub became the first telecommunications company in Singapore to offer High Definition (HD) Voice. Over a year later, the company launched 4G Voice over LTE services. Both technologies enhance mobile call experience by improving speech clarity and reducing background noise.

In September 2015, StarHub was ranked world&#x27;s fastest 4G network by independent mobile coverage checker OpenSignal. Five months later, OpenSignal reported that according to its study, Singapore is the fastest country with LTE. Singapore&#x27;s StarHub and Singtel as well as Canada&#x27;s SaskTel tied in the world&#x27;s fastest operator category.

As of the second quarter of 2016, StarHub&#x27;s 4G outdoor coverage was at 99.69%. In comparison, Singtel&#x27;s coverage was at 99.95% coverage and M1&#x27;s at 99.29%.

In November 2016, StarHub and Vodafone renewed their partnership agreement for Singapore for a further three years. The partnership was formed in 2012 to offer innovative mobile services to enterprise customers.

On 1 December 2016, StarHub rolled out a travel data plan allowing 2 GB or 3 GB use over 30 days across all mobile networks in nine Asia-Pacific destinations.

In January 2017, StarHub switched embedded SIM (eSIM) on its 4G network to support devices that come without a physical SIM. The Samsung Gear S3 Frontier (LTE) is the first eSIM wearable to be made available in Singapore.

===Pay TV===
StarHub provides cable television services through its subsidiary Singapore Cable Vision Ltd. Its Hybrid Optical Fibre-Coaxial network reaches 99% of households in Singapore.

On 18 January 2007, StarHub introduced a commercial high definition television service.

On 7 June 2012, StarHub launched TV Anywhere, a multi-platform service which allows subscribers to watch TV channels and on-demand content on their personal devices such as laptops and tablets.

On 18 March 2013, StarHub started offering commercial customers StarHub TV on Fibre, its Internet Protocol television (IPTV) service.

On 8 April 2015, IPTV was rolled out to residential customers.

On 12 August 2015, an online streaming service called StarHub Go was launched, and TV Anywhere was merged into it.

===Internet services===
StarHub provides broadband internet access through its subsidiaries StarHub Internet and StarHub Online respectively. StarHub Internet was formed after the acquisition of internet access provider CyberWay, while StarHub Online was formed after a merger with Singapore Cable Vision. StarHub has 475,000 home broadband customers as of the third quarter of 2016.

On 3 December 1999, a free surf plan was announced in conjunction with the rebranding of CyberWay, a first in Singapore&#x27;s consumer internet industry. Customers could surf the internet for free via dial-up and pay only normal local telephone charges. Over 180,000 people signed up for the free surf plan in less than three months since it was announced.

StarHub provides broadband internet access on the same network it uses for cable television services using cable modems based on the DOCSIS standard.

StarHub is a founding member of the global Wireless Broadband Alliance and provides wireless broadband services at numerous locations throughout Singapore. In November 2004, it announced an agreement with Connexion by Boeing which provide StarHub customers the ability to access the internet and digital content in flight.

On 28 December 2006, StarHub became the first operator in the world to commercially launch a 100 Mbit/s residential broadband service nationwide. Known as &quot;MaxOnline Ultimate&quot;, it is one of three cable broadband services offered by StarHub, the other two being &quot;MaxOnline Express&quot; and &quot;MaxOnline Premium&quot;. StarHub also launched 100 Mbit/s, 150 Mbit/s, 200 Mbit/s and 1000 Mbit/s residential fibre broadband service in April 2010.

<text>Major Richard Raymond Willis VC (13 October 1876 – 9 February 1966) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early career==
Willis from Woking, Surrey, was educated at Harrow School and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He was commissioned in 1897, joined the 2nd Battalion of the Lancashire Fusiliers in India, then was posted with them to the Sudan for the Mahdist War.

==First World War==
Willis was 38 years old and a captain in the 1st Battalion the Lancashire Fusiliers, during the First World War, when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

On 25 April 1915 west of Cape Helles, Gallipoli, Turkey, three companies and the Headquarters of the 1st Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers, when landing on W Beach, were met by a very deadly fire from hidden machine-guns which caused a large number of casualties. The survivors, however, rushed up and cut the wire entanglements notwithstanding the terrific fire from the enemy and after overcoming supreme difficulties, the cliffs were gained and the position maintained.

Willis was one of the six members of the regiment elected for the award, the others being Cuthbert Bromley, John Elisha Grimshaw, William Kenealy, Alfred Joseph Richards and Frank Edward Stubbs. Willis later achieved the rank of Major. 

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Fusilier Museum in Bury, Greater Manchester and, under the auspices of &quot;This England&quot; magazine, a bronze memorial plaque was unveiled by his daughter at Cheltenham Crematorium in September 2002.

<doc id="1189203" wikidata="Q7619688" url="?curid=1189203" title="Stop-time">
<text>In tap dancing, jazz, and blues, stop-time is an accompaniment pattern interrupting, or stopping, the normal time and featuring regular accented attacks on the first beat of each or every other measure, alternating with silence or instrumental solos. Stop-time occasionally appears in ragtime music. The characteristics of stop-time are heavy accents, frequent rests, and a stereotyped cadential pattern. Stop-timing may create the impression that the tempo has changed, though it has not, as the soloist continues without accompaniment. Stop-time is common in African-American popular music including R&amp;B, soul music, and led to the development of the break in hip hop.

Stop-time is, according to Samuel A. Floyd Jr., &quot;a musical device in which the forward flow of the music stops, or seems to stop, suspended in a rhythmic unison, while in some cases an improvising instrumentalist or singer continues solo with the forward flow of the meter and tempo. Such stop-time moments are sometimes repeated, creating an illusion of starting and stopping, as, for example, in Scott Joplin&#x27;s &quot;The Ragtime Dance&quot; and Jelly Roll Morton&#x27;s &quot;King Porter Stomp&quot;.&quot;

Joplin&#x27;s &quot;Stoptime Rag&quot; (1910) employs stop-time throughout; it even lacks his characteristic four-bar introduction. Stop-time in Joplin&#x27;s rags is characterized by directions in the music for performers to stomp their foot to the beat. The sheet music for Joplin&#x27;s &quot;Ragtime Dance&quot; contains the direction, &quot;Notice: to get the desired effect of &#x27;stop time&#x27;, that the pianist will please &quot;stamp&quot; the heel of one foot heavily upon the floor at the word &#x27;stamp&#x27;. Do not raise the toe from the floor while stamping.&quot;

In his copyright submission for &quot;Cornet Chop Suey,&quot; Louis Armstrong includes a written stop-time chorus. Allusions to the stop-time chorus of &quot;Cornet Chop Suey&quot; occurs in &quot;Oriental Strut&quot; and &quot;Potato Head Blues.&quot; Thomas Brothers cites Armstrong&#x27;s exposure to the tap-dancing of Bubbles, who improvised dance steps during stop-time choruses, at the Sunset Café as further inspiration for stop-time choruses in his repertoire.

In &quot;Signifyin(g), Sanctifyin&#x27;, and Slam Dunking&quot;, Gena Dagel Caponi writes:

<doc id="1189208" wikidata="Q928238" url="?curid=1189208" title="Merlin Hanbury-Tracy, 7th Baron Sudeley">
<text>Merlin Charles Sainthill Hanbury-Tracy, 7th Baron Sudeley, (17 June 1939 – 5 September 2022) was a British hereditary peer, author, and monarchist. In 1941, at the age of two, he succeeded his first cousin once removed, Richard Hanbury-Tracy, 6th Baron Sudeley, to the Barony of Sudeley and until the reforms of House of Lords Act 1999, he regularly sat as a hereditary peer.

Hanbury-Tracy&#x27;s reputation was severely damaged in later life by racist comments he made in reports and speeches, alongside comments he made praising the Nazi leader, Adolf Hitler. A member of the Conservative Party all his adult life, he was also sometimes President and Chairman of the Conservative Monday Club for seventeen years. He was Vice-Chancellor of the International Monarchist League, and President of the Traditional Britain Group until death.

==Early life and education==
Merlin Hanbury-Tracy was born on 17 June 1939 to Captain Michael Hanbury-Tracy, a Scots Guards officer, who died from wounds received at Dunkirk, and Colline Annabel, only daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Collis George Herbert St. Hill, the Royal North Devon Hussars, commander of the 2/5 battalion of Sherwood Foresters, who was also killed by a sniper at Villers-Plouich, France, on 8 July 1917.

Hanbury-Tracy&#x27;s parents sent him to Eton College, one of England’s premier public schools. He later graduated in history from Worcester College, Oxford. Hanbury-Tracy was also sometimes an adjunct lecturer at the University of Bristol. He served his National Service obligations in the ranks of the Scots Guards.

==Political Activity==
Lord Sudeley was a member of the House of Lords for 39 years. He inherited his peerage aged 2, and finally took his seat in the House at the age of 21. He was a regular attender and introduced several measures, most notably the Bill to prevent the unlicensed export of historical manuscripts and, in 1981, a Bill to uphold the Book of Common Prayer.

===Expulsion from the House of Lords===
Sudeley was one of the unelected hereditary peers expelled from the Upper House by the House of Lords Act 1999. Faced with losing his hereditary position, Sudeley opposed democratic reforms to the House of Lords. Sudeley claimed the House of Lords should be left unreformed, declaring that &quot;If it isn&#x27;t broken why mend it?&quot; He also said that since he believed inherited titles were &quot;inextricably&quot; tied to the monarchy that it was &quot;odd that they just want to touch one institution and not the other&quot;. He also claimed that the House of Lords had developed a &quot;wealth of experience&quot;. In 1985 he was elected a Vice-Chancellor of the reactionary International Monarchist League.

From the early 1970s, Sudeley was active in the Conservative Monday Club of which he became president in February 1991. He wrote for them a leading essay on &quot;The Role of Heredity in Politics&quot;, produced a Club Policy Paper against &quot;Lords Reform&quot; in December 1979, and in 1991 they published his booklet titled, and arguing for, &quot;The Preservation of the House of Lords&quot;, with a foreword by parliamentarian John Stokes.

===Racism and praise of Hitler===
Sudelely&#x27;s reputation was possibly affected by racist comments he made in speeches and reports. On 2 June 2006, &quot;The Times&quot; quoted him as stating, in a report of the Monday Club&#x27;s Annual General Meeting, that &quot;Hitler did well to get everyone back to work&quot;. It also reported him saying that &quot;True though the fact may be that some races are superior to others&quot;, going on to suggest that such rhetoric might interfere with the Monday Club&#x27;s hopes of being accepted again in Conservative Party circles.

In September 2001, the Conservative Party leadership candidate Iain Duncan Smith said the Monday Club was a &quot;viable organisation… in a sense what the party is about&quot;. However, six weeks later, after becoming leader, he publicly distanced the party from the Monday Club until it ceased to &quot;promulgate or discuss policies relating to race&quot;; he also indicated that no Conservative MPs should contribute to &quot;Right Now!&quot;, a quarterly magazine of which Lord Sudeley was a Patron, after an article in it described Nelson Mandela as a &quot;terrorist&quot;.

Lord Sudeley was also a vice-president of the now-defunct Western Goals Institute.

Lord Sudeley was also Patron of the Bankruptcy Association (Lloyds Bank foreclosed upon Charles Hanbury-Tracy, 4th Baron Sudeley in 1893, when his debt was covered twice over by large assets) and Convenor of the Forum for Stable Currencies. He was also Lay Patron of the Prayer Book Society and a past President of the Powysland Club.

==Hobbies==
Lord Sudeley once described in &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; one of his hobbies as &quot;Ancestor Worship&quot;, with &quot;Conversation&quot; being listed in Debrett&#x27;s. He took great pride in the former family seat of Toddington Manor in Gloucestershire which the family was later forced to sell. In its successful blend of the Perpendicular Gothic and Picturesque styles, Toddington is the fore-runner of the Houses of Parliament when the soon-to-be 1st Lord Sudeley was selected as chairman of the new parliamentary committee to settle upon the design. His contributions based upon Toddington&#x27;s were accepted and enhanced.

At Easter 1985, in conjunction with the century-old Manorial Society of Great Britain (of which he sat on the Governing Council), Sudeley held a conference at his old home, the proceedings published in a volume entitled &quot;The Sudeleys - Lords of Toddington&quot;, taking the history of his family back to Thomas Becket&#x27;s murder and ultimately to Charlemagne. On 21 November 2006, he arranged a further conference at the Society of Antiquaries of London on &quot;Visual Aspects of Toddington in the 19th century&quot;.

Lord Sudeley has written many published essays, including a history of the English gentleman for a German pharmaceutical magazine, &quot;Die Waage&quot;. He also wrote a history of the House of Lords in which he promoted its Tory (as opposed to Whig history) interpretation, entitled &quot;Peers Through the Mist of Time&quot;. A launch for his book took place at the Brooks&#x27;s Club in London on 28 September 2018. In his 2021 book &quot;Toddington, the Unforgotten Forerunner&quot;, Sudeley tells the story of his family&#x27;s former seat, designed in a blend of Perpendicular Gothic and Picturesque by Charles Hanbury-Tracy, later Chairman of the Commission for the Rebuilding of the Houses of Parliament in the same style, and its tragic and unexplained loss. He is also the author of a satire on Greek mythology (published in John Pudney&#x27;s famous &quot;Pick of Today&#x27;s Short Stories&quot;) and a quantity of politically incorrect short stories mostly published in the &quot;London Miscellany&quot; magazine. In recent years Sudeley style-edited a definitive monograph on Azerbaijan&#x27;s architecture, translated from the Russian.

==Personal life==
Lord Sudeley lived in a mansion flat in Dorset Square, London. He had been married three times and divorced twice.

Sudeley married his first wife on 18 January 1980 (dissolved 1988), Elizabeth Mairi Villiers (3 November 1941 – 29 September 2014), daughter of Derek William Charles Keppel, Viscount Bury (heir-apparent of the 9th Earl of Albemarle) and Lady Mairi Vane-Tempest-Stewart (youngest daughter of the 7th Marquess of Londonderry, and ex-wife of Alastair Michael Hyde Villiers, a Partner in Panmure Gordon &amp; Company, stockbrokers.

Sudeley was married secondly in 1999 (dissolved 2006) to Margarita (born 1962) daughter of Nikolai Danko, and ex-wife of Lloyd&#x27;s broker Nigel Kellett.

Sudeley married a third time, in 2010, Dr Tatiana Dudina (born 19 August 1950), daughter of Russian Colonel Boris Dudin and Galina Veselovskaya. Dr Dudina holds a doctorate in philology from Moscow State Linguistic University.

===Death===
Lord Sudeley died on 5 September 2022, at the age of 83. He was succeeded in the Barony of Sudeley by his third cousin once removed, Nicholas Hanbury-Tracy.

<doc id="1189211" wikidata="Q3109560" url="?curid=1189211" title="Goaltimate">
<text>Goaltimate is a half-court disc game derived from ultimate, similar to hot box. The object is to score points by throwing a flying disc to a teammate in a small scoring area, through a large semicircular hoop called the goal. The name is a portmanteau of &quot;goal&quot; and &quot;ultimate&quot;.

==History==
Goaltimate was invented by players of ultimate in Wellesley, Massachusetts. It was invented on Christmas Day around 1980, on hard-pack snow, after not enough players for ultimate showed up. It was originally played between the lower spars of a set of H-shaped football uprights. Jim Herrick, one of the Boston inventors, brought the game to San Diego, where it was further developed and replaced the uprights with a large hoop made with PVC pipes. In 1999, Rick and Bibbi Conner, San Diego entrepreneurs with interest in the sport, subsidized a goaltimate tournament with a US$30,000 purse for the winners, inviting top players from competitive ultimate teams. The San Diego team took the prize, defeating a team from Boston in the finals. Through this introduction, the sport rapidly spread across the US as a pickup alternative to ultimate.

In 2016, USA Goaltimate, the national governing body for the sport, was launched.

==Play==
Play consists of two teams of four players each, competing in a large oval area with the goal at one end and a clear zone in the other. Throwing the disc through the goal to a teammate standing within the scoring area results in one point. A pass through the goal to the scoring area past the Clear/Two-Point Line is worth two points. Games are played to 5, with a &#x27;Best of 3&#x27; or &#x27;Best of 5&#x27; games in a match.

The disc may only pass through the goal in the scoring direction; passing otherwise results in a turnover. As in ultimate, turnovers also result when a disc is dropped, intercepted, goes out of bounds, or when the thrower is stalled (the thrower has five seconds to throw, the duration of which is enforced by opponents&#x27; stall count). Unlike in ultimate, a stall count may be called from anywhere on the playing field, provided it is audible to the thrower. After any turnover or score, the disc must be passed beyond the clear line before the next point may be scored. Play is continuous, with no pause after scores or clears.

Most throwing and receiving rules are identical to those of ultimate. Official rules can be found here 1. However, many goaltimate communities use slight variations of the rules in based on the number of available players, field space, equipment or local tradition.

Substitutions occur on-the-fly, so teams typically take the opportunity to sub immediately after gaining possession of the disc. In pick-up-play, subbing on a mistake (turnover, drop) is the usual practice.

===Field setup===

Source:

The Goaltimate field is a circle in diameter. PVC piping forms an arch (the &quot;goal&quot;) high and wide at the base and is located at the front of the end zone. The end zone is a half-oval wide and 24 feet deep. The back of the end zone starts from one end of the playing field. A poach zone is often set up in front of the goal in order to prevent defensive players from setting up their initial defense at the goal line (which prevents Two-point throws) while the offensive team clears the disc. The poach zone is identical to the end zone and is a half-oval, wide and 24 feet deep. A Clear Line/Two-point line wide and deep at the center is located in front of the goal. The substitution box is at one side of the field. Complete instructions on how to make a PVC set with 1&quot; PVC, couplings, 2 pieces of Rebar and a hammer are available here.

A common alternate field setup which uses a rectangular field is described on the USA Goaltimate web site.

===Strategy===
Goaltimate offensive strategy mimics that of a basketball offense&#x27;s half-court set. Offensive players stand to the fore of the scoring area and make streaking cuts behind the goal. Throwers attempt to either strike through the goal, or, when this is impossible, throw the disc to an open player in position before the goal. Defenders position themselves between the offensive players and the scoring area, and attempt to minimize throwing windows by remaining aware of where the disc is and where a scoring opportunity may ensue.

Even in competitive play, defensive effort against a team trying to clear the disc is often token, as defenders will take the opportunity to rest or position themselves to prevent the two-point play. The soaring passes and long, streaking cuts familiar to observers of ultimate are typically only present in goaltimate games during the clear. The exception to lax defense on the clear is when a team gains possession well beyond the goal, as it becomes advantageous to leave the thrower unguarded, and double-team any cuts that are coming toward the thrower, similar to guarding an in-bounds pass after a score in a full-court press in basketball. Passing is typically quick, with short and fast cuts.

Turnovers occur with greater regularity in goaltimate than ultimate. Scores are frequently achieved in a burst of several in a row, when fatigued defenders find themselves merely chasing their assigned offensive players but unable to safely substitute out.

===Equipment===
Goaltimate requires a hoop to play. This might seem daunting to casual folks, but kits can be made using PVC pipe and setup can be done in about the same time it takes to set up an ultimate field. Goaltimate hoops are UV protected PVC (about $200 for a &#x27;kit&#x27;). Usually rebar stakes are used to support the hoop on a grass field.

Goaltimate can also be played indoors. One setup used successfully was to put high-friction mats on a gym floor. On top of that were placed heavy cast iron Christmas tree stands. In the stands was fastened vertically 3.5 feet of 1.25 PVC, into which the normal hoop slid. In order to keep the hoop stationary, a bag of rocksalt was placed on each tree stand.

Instead of building a homemade kit, Goaltimate kits can be purchased online. One company, GoaltyLife, has engineered Goaltimate Kits both for indoor and outdoor use. Their kits use a foldable tent-pole style arch and custom anchors for support.

Low-profile cones are used to demarcate the end zone and clear lines. The round field is sometimes changed to a square or rectangle shape to ease setup (or Goaltimate is played with no boundaries).

<text>Colonel Sir Henry Wilmot, 5th Baronet (3 February 1831 – 7 April 1901) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was also a Conservative Party politician.

==Early life==
Wilmot was born in Chaddesden, near Derby the son of Sir Henry Wilmot (4th Baronet) and his wife Maria Mundy daughter of Edmund Mundy of Shipley Hall. He was educated at Rugby School.

==Military career==

Wilmot purchased a commission as an Ensign in the 43rd (Monmouthshire) Regiment of Foot. Two years later he purchased a Lieutenancy and in 1855 purchased a Captaincy in the same regiment. Later in 1855 he transferred to the Rifle Brigade, still as a Captain.
Wilmot served as a captain in the 2nd Battalion, The Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort&#x27;s Own) and later was on the staff of Brigadier General Hope Grant. It was while assigned to the staff that he fought in the Indian Mutiny; on 11 March 1858 at Lucknow, India, along with Private David Hawkes and Corporal William Nash, the following deed led to his being awarded the Victoria Cross:
Later, he served in the Central Indian campaign of 1858 and the Second China War.

In 1862, Wilmot retired from the regular army having been appointed a Major in the Volunteer Force unit, the 1st Administrative Battalion, Derbyshire Rifle Volunteers. Appointment as lieutenant colonel of the Derbyshire Rifle Volunteers followed in 1863. Further recognition was made in 1868 when Wilmot was appointed as a Deputy Lieutenant of Derbyshire In 1881 he was granted the honorary rank of colonel of the Derbyshire Rifle Volunteers, prior to resigning his commission and being appointed honorary Colonel of the Derbyshire Rifle Corps. With the expansion of the Volunteer Force Wilmot was appointed as brigade commander of the North Midland Brigade in 1888 with the substantive rank of Colonel in the Volunteer Forces an appointment he held until 1895.

==Personal life==
Wilmot married Charlotte Pare (1838–1891) in 1862. He succeeded to the baronetcy of Wilmot of Chaddesden on the death of his father in 1872 and was made a Companion of the Bath in the Civil Division of the Order (CB) in 1881. A final honour in 1898 was to be appointed a Knight Commander of the Bath (KCB).

Henry Wilmot died of pneumonia on 7 April 1901 at his home in Bournemouth and was buried at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Chaddesden.

<doc id="1189215" wikidata="Q651038" url="?curid=1189215" title="Cucujoidea">
<text>Cucujoidea is a superfamily of beetles. This group formerly included all of the families now included in the superfamily Coccinelloidea. They include some fungus beetles and a diversity of lineages of &quot;bark beetles&quot; unrelated to the &quot;true&quot; bark beetles (Scolytinae), which are weevils (superfamily Curculionoidea).

== Morphology ==
The morphology of Cucujoidea is varied and there are no features uniting all members of the superfamily. In terms of general appearance, they tend to be small, drab in colour and with clubbed antennae. Even this is not universal; for example, &quot;Glischrochilus&quot; (Nitidulidae) have aposematic orange spots on their elytra.

Adults can be recognised by the procoxal cavities being internally open in most taxa, females having tarsal formula 5-5-5 and males 5-5-5 or 5-5-4 (rarely 4-4-4), females with tergite VIII concealed dorsally by tergite VII, and males with tergite X completely membraneous.

Larvae have frontal arms usually lyriform, the mandible mesal surface usually with well-developed mola, a maxillary articulating area usually present, a hypopharyngeal sclerome usually present, and two pretarsal setae.

== Ecology ==
Cucujoidea usually have cryptic habits, living in fungi, leaf litter or dead wood. This is reflected in many families having &quot;fungus&quot; or &quot;bark&quot; in their common names. The Kateretidae and some Phalacridae feed on flowers instead. The Nitidulidae are quite varied: some are saprophagous and mycetophagous like typical cucujoids, but others are associated with carrion, flowers, insect nests or stored food products.

==Taxonomy==
According to a 2015 revision, the following 25 families make up superfamily Cucujoidea:
* Agapythidae 
* Boganiidae 
* Cavognathidae 
* Cryptophagidae – silken fungus beetles
* Cucujidae – flat bark beetles
* Cybocephalidae 
* Cyclaxyridae – sooty mould beetles
* Erotylidae – pleasing fungus beetles
* Helotidae 
* Hobartiidae 
* Kateretidae – short-winged flower beetles (= Brachypteridae)
* Laemophloeidae – lined flat bark beetles
* Lamingtoniidae 
* Monotomidae – root-eating beetles
* Myraboliidae 
* Nitidulidae – sap beetles
* Passandridae – parasitic flat bark beetles
* Phalacridae – shining flower beetles
* Phloeostichidae 
* Priasilphidae 
* Protocucujidae 
* Silvanidae – silvanid flat bark beetles
* Smicripidae – palmetto beetles
* Sphindidae – dry-fungus beetles
* Tasmosalpingidae 
* Parandrexidae (Middle Jurassic-Early Cretaceous)
* Wabbelidae (Eocene)

=== Extinct genera ===

* &quot;Alloterocucus&quot; Burmese amber, Myanmar, mid-Cretaceous (latest Albian- earliest Cenomanian)

<text>The Tandy Pocket Computer or TRS-80 Pocket Computer is a line of pocket computers sold by Tandy Corporation under the Tandy or Radio Shack TRS-80 brands.

Although named after the TRS-80 line of computers, they were not compatible with any TRS-80 desktop computer and did not use the Z80 CPU. Models in the Pocket Computer line were actually rebadged Sharp and Casio devices with different model names. They were given designations from PC-1 to PC-8. The PC-1, PC-2, PC-3 and PC-8 were designed by Sharp; while the PC-4, PC-5, PC-6 and PC-7 were designed by Casio.

==History, lineage and nomenclature==
Tandy introduced its first Pocket Computer in 1980 as an experiment; &quot;BYTE&quot; stated that &quot;neither Tandy nor any of the other pocket-computer makers really know if there is a meaningful market for this machine&quot;. The magazine said that the vendors expected that businessmen would use them with a modem to communicate with larger computers. Although not branded as such, the original TRS-80 Pocket Computer later became known as the PC-1, as subsequent models were labelled PC-2 through PC-8. Some were made by Sharp, and the rest by Casio (PC-4 through PC-7). The PC-2 had four colored ball point pens and could print or plot on plain paper. The other print-capable models all used thermal paper, the PC-3 and PC-8 used one printer, while the PC-4, PC-5 and PC-6 used another. The PC-7 had no printer or cassette interface.

===Models===
The Tandy/TRS-80 model names are listed with the corresponding original Sharp or Casio model number.
* &quot;TRS-80 Pocket Computer PC-1&quot; – Sharp PC-1211
* &quot;TRS-80 Pocket Computer PC-2&quot; – Sharp PC-1500
* &quot;Tandy/TRS-80 Pocket Computer PC-3&quot; – Sharp PC-1251
* &quot;TRS-80 Pocket Computer PC-4&quot; – Casio PB-100
* &quot;Tandy Pocket Computer PC-5&quot; – Casio FX-780P
* &quot;Tandy Pocket Computer PC-6&quot; – Casio FX-790P
* &quot;Tandy Pocket Computer PC-7&quot; – Casio FX-5200P
* &quot;Tandy Pocket Computer PC-8&quot; – Sharp PC-1246

==Purpose==
Pocket computers were an advancement over early programmable calculator designs. In addition to providing users with scientific math functions in a small portable package, the devices also understood a form of the BASIC programming language. They included a QWERTY keyboard, of either rubber capacitive or membrane type, to use for entering the names of scientific functions and programming commands, in addition to a traditional numeric keypad. (The exception was the PC-7, which had a rectangular and alphabetically ordered keyboard, like most scientific calculators.) On some models, the alphanumeric keypad had a different type, form factor, and location than the numeric keypad.

==Design==
The models provided a short one-line dot-matrix LCD display, to show the current line of input text, or a segment of it containing the cursor. Character widths in these models varied from 12 characters in the PC-4 and PC-7 to 24 characters on most of the rest. The displays also included some way of indicating operational mode, scientific mode, and other states and conditions.

The Casio models included lower-case characters. These were only for use in PRINT statements, as lower-case commands and variables were not accepted as with almost all BASIC programming machines.

In general, the two specific lines were not cross-compatible, but there were compatibilities within lines. PC-1 programs would work unmodified on the PC-3 and on the PC-8 with changes for screen size, and PC-4 (26-3650B) programs would run unmodified on the PC-5, PC-6 and PC-7. The PC-2 was a unique architecture and was the only unit in the line allowing direct memory access with POKE, PEEK and CALL.

==Operating modes==
Each model had two operating modes: Run and Prog.

===Run===
In Run mode, the command line could be openly used to execute one-line, non-BASIC operations. This is the normal mode used, from where arbitrary calculations could be entered to receive results. The Run mode also allowed the execution of the BASIC programs stored in the device.

Instead of an &quot;equals&quot; key to initiate calculation evaluation, an &quot;EXE&quot; (execute) key was provided. This caused confusion with those who were used to traditional calculators. The = character was used only for variable assignment, and evaluation tests in programs.

The input of simple calculations would be aggregated on the command line, and no results would be displayed until the EXE key was pressed. In some models, a special ANS variable was provided to reuse the results of the previous calculation; in others, the previous calculation was automatically included if the next calculation began with an operator.

Some valid calculation input examples (PC-8):

 SIN40
 10+2+(8*1)/7
 TAN (LOG (√(4/3)))

===Prog===
The Prog mode changed the input from a command line to a program editor. In this mode, BASIC programs could be entered one line at a time. Up and down arrow buttons were provided to scroll up and down through the program space. On most models, free calculations could not be entered in the Prog mode. Certain models, especially the Casio-derived ones, called this mode WRiTe mode.

On the Sharp models, there was only one line numbering space. In order for multiple programs to exist on the device, they had to be written in different ranges of line numbers. For example, it was common to insert one program starting with line 100, and another program starting at line 200, etc. Valid line numbers in most models were from 1 to 999. To prevent run-on execution, each program had to finish with the END command, unless run-on execution was desired. On Sharp-derived units, labels could be inserted into the program, usually single characters such that in Run mode, that program could be executed by depressing a special DEF key followed by the key of that character. This was equivalent to an explicit GOTO command to the first line number of that section of program, which was also a valid way to execute programs from Run mode.

In the Casio-derived models, the BASIC space was subdivided into segmented program spaces which could be numbered, cleared and executed manually, or could call each other.

Many of the devices included a special modifier key to expedite the entry of BASIC commands as well as scientific function names. The most common commands would each be associated with a key, and the full command could be entered by depressing the special modifier key, followed by the associated key for the command.

In some models, BASIC and other commands would be converted into one-character tokens (converted to strings upon display) instead of being stored as whole strings.

==Memory==
The total memory capacity of the devices varied from 1 KB to 12 KB and up as far as 16 KB with the use of an available RAM card (only for some models). The optional RAM cards varied in sizes from 1 KB, 4 KB and 8 KB.

All user storage was taken from the same space, so allocation of arrays using DIM would decrease the available memory for program instructions, and vice versa. However, the storage space for one-character alphabetical variables was pre-allocated, and as a result the A array had special significance in many units. For example, in the PC-8, the A array actually pointed to the locations of the alphabetical variables, so A(2) pointed to the value of B, and so on. As a result, published programs for the device avoided the use of A as either an array or an alphabetical variable. On some models the entire variable space could be manipulated in this fashion.

==Other notes==
It was not possible to define new mathematical function commands for use in Run mode. However, on many Sharp derived models, a special AREAD command was added to BASIC which would assign the current value on the display line to a given variable, which could then be used in a program. Combined with a defined key, this allowed very quick custom operation.

The program interpreter on the models did not provide human-readable error information. Errors encountered either in program execution or calculation evaluation would be returned as one of 9 error codes, usually indicated by replacing the display with text such as &quot;ERROR 4&quot;. On the PC-7 model the list of error codes was printed above the text keypad, and was included on the case of the PC-8, but with other models users not familiar with the meaning of each code would have to refer to the manual. Like other characteristics of this line, the meanings of the error codes were not necessarily equivalent from model to model.

==Undocumented commands==
The PC-3 and PC-8 had a couple of commands that were not listed in the manual, but nonetheless were recognized by BASIC and usable.

* ; and - the highest memory location is 2047, and it is possible to modify the BASIC program in RAM directly with , as well as access a certain memory location (37, possibly?) that controls the DEG/RAD/GRAD spots on the LCD. With judicious POKEs into the BASIC program text area more characters in the PC-8 character set can be discovered, including a `tilde` which also seems to function as a bizarre command. Some blank characters when &#x27;ed will display additional symbols on the printer if one is attached.
* - seems to be some type of test mode for the display. Will show a couple of patterns on the LCD and then appear to lock up.
* - seems to be some type of test mode related to the optional Printer Interface

Also, SHIFT-6 on the PC-8 will display a Yen symbol.

<doc id="1189221" wikidata="Q4800708" url="?curid=1189221" title="Sir Arthur Wilson, 3rd Baronet">
<text>Admiral of the Fleet Sir Arthur Knyvet Wilson, 3rd Baronet, (4 March 1842 – 25 May 1921) was a Royal Navy officer. He served in the Anglo-Egyptian War and then the Mahdist War being awarded the Victoria Cross during the Battle of El Teb in February 1884. He went on to command a battleship, the torpedo school and then another battleship before taking charge of the Experimental Torpedo Squadron. He later commanded the Channel Fleet. He briefly served as First Sea Lord but in that role he &quot;was abrasive, inarticulate, and autocratic&quot; and was really only selected as Admiral Fisher&#x27;s successor because he was a supporter of Fisher&#x27;s reforms. Wilson survived for even less time than was intended by the stop-gap nature of his appointment because of his opposition to the establishment of a Naval Staff. Appointed an advisor at the start of World War I, he advocated offensive schemes in the North Sea including the capture of Heligoland and was an early proponent of the development and use of submarines in the Royal Navy.

==Early career==
Born the son of Rear Admiral George Knyvet Wilson and Agnes Mary Wilson (née Yonge), Wilson was educated at Eton College before he joined the Royal Navy as a midshipman aboard the second-rate in 1855. He was present at the Battle of Kinburn in October 1855 during the Crimean War. He was transferred to fourth-rate on the China Station in September 1856 and then, following the loss of the &quot;Raleigh&quot; near Hong Kong, transferred to the second-rate and saw action in command of a gun in the naval brigade at the Battle of Canton in December 1857 and then at the Battle of Taku Forts in May 1858 during the Second Opium War. He was appointed to the steam frigate on the Pacific Station in September 1859 and was promoted to lieutenant on 11 December 1861. After a tour in the steam frigate , he joined the gunnery school at Portsmouth in April 1865. He became an instructor at the new Imperial Japanese Naval Academy at Yokohama in Japan in May 1867 and then at the new training ship in January 1869.

Wilson became a member of the committee investigating the effectiveness of the Whitehead torpedo and was involved in its trials in 1870. He became gunnery officer in the training ship HMS &quot;Caledonia&quot; in the Mediterranean Fleet in 1871 and first lieutenant in the steam frigate in October 1872. Promoted to commander on 18 September 1873, he became second-in-command in the new steam frigate in January 1874.
In 1876 Wilson became commander and chief of staff at the new torpedo school , where his duties included rewriting torpedo manuals, inventing aiming apparatus and developing mine warfare.

==El Teb==
Promoted to captain on 20 April 1880, Wilson was appointed to command the torpedo boat depot ship . In the summer of 1882 he was ordered to take the &quot;Hecla&quot; to Egypt to deliver ammunition for British troops taking part in the Anglo-Egyptian War; on arrival, working with Captain John Fisher, he installed a heavy gun on a railway carriage and created an improvised armoured train. He was awarded the Ottoman Empire Order of the Medjidie, 3rd Class on 12 January 1883.

Early in 1884 the &quot;Hecla&quot; was sent to Trinkitat on the Red Sea coast of Sudan to support British troops defending Suakin during the Mahdist War. Wilson attached himself to the Naval Brigade and the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC:

==Admiralty and Fleet command==

Wilson became Flag Captain to the Commander-in-Chief, Cape of Good Hope Station and Captain of the &quot;Raleigh&quot; in March 1886. He went on to be assistant director of Torpedoes at the Admiralty in April 1887 and was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 21 June 1887. He went on to be Captain of &quot;Vernon&quot; in 1889 and Captain of the battleship in the Mediterranean Fleet in 1892. He was appointed Naval Aide-de-Camp to the Queen on 14 February 1892. In the &quot;Sans Pareil&quot; he was briefly Flag Captain to the Commander in Chief, Mediterranean Fleet in late 1893. Promoted to rear-admiral on 22 June 1895, he was given command of the experimental torpedo squadron, hoisting his flag in the cruiser before becoming Second-in-Command of the Reserve Fleet in 1896. He became Third Naval Lord and Controller of the Navy in August 1897 and Senior Officer in Command of the Channel Squadron in March 1901, hoisting his flag in the battleship upon taking command in April 1901. He was promoted to vice-admiral on 24 May 1901, and advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in the 1902 Coronation Honours list published on 26 June 1902, following which he was knighted and received the insignia in an investiture on board the royal yacht outside Cowes on 15 August 1902, the day before the fleet review held there to mark the coronation. Wilson took part in the review with the &quot;Majestic&quot;.

He went on to be Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet in May 1903 (renamed the Channel Fleet in December 1904), hoisting his flag in the battleship and then in the battleship . He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order on 11 August 1903 on the occasion of the King&#x27;s visit to Ireland, promoted to full admiral on 24 February 1905 and advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order on 11 August 1905 on the occasion of the visit of the French Fleet. He was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 9 November 1906.

==First Sea Lord==
Wilson was promoted to Admiral of the Fleet on 1 March 1907 and, after three years in retirement, became First Sea Lord in January 1910. In this role he was, according to Hew Strachan, &quot;abrasive, inarticulate, and autocratic&quot; and was really only selected as Admiral Fisher&#x27;s successor because he was a supporter of Fisher&#x27;s reforms. He took part in the funeral of King Edward VII in May 1910.

Wilson gave a poor account of himself at the Committee of Imperial Defence meeting after the Agadir Crisis, at which he said that in the event of war the Navy planned to land the Army on the Baltic Coast, an old plan of the recently retired Admiral Fisher, apparently derived from the Seven Years&#x27; War of the mid eighteenth century. According to the memoirs of Lord Haldane, Field Marshal Nicholson (Chief of the Imperial General Staff), asked Admiral Wilson whether the Admiralty had maps of German strategic railways (to show how the Germans could rush reinforcements to invasion spots), and when Wilson said it was not the Admiralty&#x27;s business to have such maps, Nicholson openly rebuked him and said that if the Navy &quot;meddled&quot; in military matters they needed not just to have such maps but to have studied them. The meeting was carried by a lucid presentation by Brigadier-General Henry Wilson, and Prime Minister H. H. Asquith (who thought the Royal Navy plan &quot;puerile and wholly impracticable&quot;) ordered the Navy to fall in with the Army&#x27;s plans to deploy an Expeditionary Force to France. After the meeting Churchill was appointed First Lord of the Admiralty and began setting up a Naval Staff (Admiral Fisher having been opposed to setting one up), whilst Hankey began to draw up the War Book detailing mobilisation plans.

Wilson survived for even less time than was intended by the stop-gap nature of his appointment because of his opposition to the establishment of a Naval Staff. In the opinion of historian Hew Strachan: &quot;the combination of frequent change and weak appointees (Wilson, Bridgeman and Battenberg) ensured that the professional leadership of the Royal Navy lost its direction in the four years preceding the war&quot;. Wilson left the Admiralty in December 1911 and received the Order of Merit on 8 March 1912. He was recalled by Winston Churchill in 1914 at the start of World War I to provide advice on strategy. He advocated offensive schemes in the North Sea including the capture of Heligoland and was an early proponent of the development and use of submarines in the Royal Navy. He ceased his role as an advisor in November 1918 and inherited a baronetcy from his brother in October 1919.

He died, unmarried, in Swaffham on 25 May 1921 and is buried in the churchyard of St Peter and St Paul&#x27;s Church. His VC was donated to the Royal Naval Museum, Portsmouth.

==Nicknames==
Wilson&#x27;s nickname of &#x27;Tug&#x27; is thought to come from a reference to the boxer &quot;Tug&quot; Wilson, who had come to prominence shortly before Wilson received his Victoria Cross, and was noted for his tenacity. It has since become a common nickname, especially in the Navy, for men called Wilson. He was also known as &#x27;Old &#x27;Ard &#x27;Art&#x27; for his refusal to consider the cares and comforts of officers and men.

<doc id="1189223" wikidata="Q2376601" url="?curid=1189223" title="Lacus Clyne">
<text>is a fictional character introduced in the Japanese science fiction anime television series &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED&quot; and appearing in the sequels &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny&quot; and &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Freedom&quot;, all three of which are part of the Gundam franchise by Sunrise. In the start of &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED&quot;, Lacus is a good natured and popular female vocalist from the space colony PLANT. Born as a genetically enhanced human, a Coordinator (later revealed to be a Accord), Lacus is introduced when she is found in space by the battleship the &quot;Archangel&quot;, a ship of regular humans, the Naturals. Late in the war between the races of Coordinators and Naturals, Lacus becomes the co-leader of the Clyne Faction, joining with the &quot;Archangel&quot; to stop both sides from fighting. Lacus is voiced in the Japanese series by Rie Tanaka. In the Ocean English dub, her speaking voiced is done by Chantal Strand, while Jillian Michaels does her singing voice. In the NYAV English dub, she is voiced by Stephanie Sheh.

Lacus&#x27; character has also appeared in different adaptations from &quot;Gundam SEED&quot; and &quot;Gundam SEED Destiny&quot;, as well as various video games. Her character has been popular in Japan, appearing at the top of &quot;Animage&quot;″s Anime Grand Prix polls four times in the category of most popular female anime characters. She has also appeared in other popularity polls from Sunrise and other magazines. Moreover, publications for manga, anime and other media have commented on Lacus&#x27; character, giving her praise; speculations regarding her role in the series were made, but in the end it was found surprising.

==Appearances==

===In the TV series===
In &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED&quot;, Lacus Clyne is the daughter of PLANT Supreme Council Chairman Siegel Clyne. Often seen with Haro machines, Lacus is one of the genetically enhanced humans known as Coordinators whose career as an idol singer has brought her enormous popularity. When she is dispatched to the ruins of Junius Seven, her vessel is attacked by an Earth Alliance battleship, a faction composed of Natural that oppose PLANT. Her lifepod is subsequently rescued by the mobile suit GAT-X105 Strike and brought to the Earth Alliance ship Archangel. There Lacus befriends the Strike pilot Kira Yamato while most of the others remain indifferent because she is a Coordinator. In the following battle, ZAFT forces attacking the Archangel are forced to retreat after Lacus is used as a hostage by Natarle Badgiruel. Disgusted by this action, Kira escorts Lacus back to ZAFT in secret. He hands her over to Athrun Zala, who is engaged to Lacus. Late in the war, a wounded Kira is brought to Lacus&#x27; home by her friend Reverend Malchio. As Kira is nursed back to health, he resolves to keep fighting in order to find a way to end the war. In response, Lacus helps Kira steal the mobile suit ZGMF-X10A Freedom. Because of this, Lacus and her father Siegel are declared as traitors and the latter is killed by ZAFT soldiers. Lacus steals the ship Eternal and joins the Orb Union-owned Kusanagi and the recently defected Archangel to form the Three Ships Alliance, a group dedicated to stopping the war. Before the last battle to stop both the Earth Alliance and ZAFT, Lacus gives Kira a ring, asking him to come back safely to her.

At the start of &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny&quot;, Lacus is living with Kira at Reverend Malchio&#x27;s orphanage in the Marshall Islands. However, a disaster from the new war forces them to move in with their former comrades Andrew Waltfeld and Murrue Ramius at their shared mansion in Orb. Lacus is almost killed in an assassination attempt by Coordinators but Kira defeats the assassins with the Freedom. She, along with Murrue, Kira, Andrew, and most of the Archangel&#x27;s crew reunite hoping to stop the new war. Lacus, along with Andrew, go into space, to see what the situation is at the PLANTs. She delivers the newly built Strike Freedom and Infinite Justice mobile suits to Kira and Athrun during her returning. She also reveals her presence to the public and the fact that ZAFT has been using an impersonation of her for their own benefit. Later, Lacus and Kira reveal to the crew of the Archangel Durandal&#x27;s plan to assign behavioral genes to every human being in order to render war and conflict obsolete. Lacus then leads Terminal and its allies in the final battle to stop Durandal.

===In other media===
Apart from her role in the original series, Lacus is also featured in the original video animation &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny Final Plus&quot;. After Durandal&#x27;s death, Lacus is invited back to the PLANTs to serve as a mediator between ZAFT and the other nations. She also appears in two series of films &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED: Special Edition&quot; and &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny: Special Edition&quot; which retell the events from its respective series. In the end of the OVA as well as &quot;Gundam SEED Destiny: Special Edition&quot;, Lacus remains as a member of the PLANT Supreme Council. She is also featured in the manga adaptations of both &quot;Gundam SEED&quot; and &quot;Gundam SEED Destiny&quot;, the latter also including &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny: The Edge&quot;. Two CDs soundtracks have also been released based on Lacus&#x27; character featuring tracks by her Japanese voice actress, Tanaka Rie. Lacus is a playable character in both video games &quot;Gundam SEED Destiny: OMNI vs ZAFT II&quot; and &quot;Dynasty Warriors: Gundam 2&quot;, she also appears in &quot;Super Robot Wars Alpha 3&quot;, &quot;Super Robot Wars Judgement&quot;, &quot;Super Robot Wars W&quot; and &quot;Super Robot Wars K&quot; as captain of the Eternal. Lacus is a Pilot in &quot;Dynasty Warriors: Gundam 2&quot; piloting the Strike Freedom and Infinite Justice. In a collection mission she is seen piloting a ball. She also shows up in the &quot;SD Gundam G Generation&quot; games.

==Reception==
Lacus Clyne consistently ranked highly in the most popular female category in the Animage Anime Grand Prix poll in the 25th to 30th editions of the poll. In the 27th to 29th versions of the poll, Lacus Clyne placed first in this category. In another poll, she was voted as the second most popular female anime character from the 2000s. In a poll organized by Sunrise regarding which was the best couple in the Gundam franchise, Lacus and Kira were second. In another poll from the same site, Lacus was voted as the most popular princess from the entire franchise. She was also second in a poll which asked fans what female characters from &quot;Gundam SEED&quot; and &quot;Gundam SEED Destiny&quot; would they want to see in swimming suit, as well as another one in wedding dress from the Gundam franchise. Two other polls asked fans what was the most memorable characters from &quot;Gundam SEED&quot; and from &quot;Gundam SEED Destiny&quot;; Lacus was sixth in the former and fifth in the latter. In the 2007 Seiyu Awards, Rie Tanaka was a nominee in the category &quot;Best Actresses in supporting roles&quot; for her portrayal as Lacus in the &quot;Gundam SEED Destiny&quot; OVA, but lost to Ami Koshimizu and Yuko Goto.

The character has also received comments by publications for manga, anime and other media. When &quot;Gundam SEED&quot; was during its first episodes in Japan, Ever Cheung from Animefringe wondered about the future regarding Lacus and Kira as he noticed the two about to embrace in the anime&#x27;s opening theme. He commented if his doubts may be right, he would find the story more interesting that he thought. Kim Wolstenholme from Mania Entertainment liked Lacus&#x27;s introduction to the series as it added tension to it the friendship between Kira and Athrun. Kim noted that while Lacus and Athrun were engaged, he wondered how Lacus and Kira started relating in the series. Ross Liversidge from UK Anime Network stated he did not expect Lacus&#x27;s faction entrance to the war in the last episodes from &quot;Gundam SEED&quot; as it emphasized the disasters happening within the series. Wolstenholme liked how Lacus started to take place in the war as it contrasted her actions in the series&#x27; first episodes, while also delivering surprising revelations. Moreover, Chris Beverdige, also writing for Mania, found Lacus&#x27; development throughout these episodes interesting and at the same time comical due to the design of her ship and how it is decorated by the Haros she possesses. While reviewing &quot;Gundam SEED Destiny&quot;, Liversidge stated that Lacus had become &quot;a cult&quot; within the series&#x27; setting due to how besides being pop-idol, she is backed up by a large number of soldiers. Lacus&#x27; public appearance in the series to reveal that Meer Campbell was impersonating her and state her true intentions was also called &quot;totally mesmerising&quot; by Liversidge. Chantal Strand was praised for her performance as both Lacus&#x27;s and Meer&#x27;s English voice actress by Anime News Network writer Theron Martin for giving them quality distinct from the original Japanese version despite finding it varying at some points.

<doc id="1189224" wikidata="Q917189" url="?curid=1189224" title="Host-based intrusion detection system">
<text>A host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS) is an intrusion detection system that is capable of monitoring and analyzing the internals of a computing system as well as the network packets on its network interfaces, similar to the way a network-based intrusion detection system (NIDS) operates. HIDS focuses on more granular and internal attacks through focusing monitoring host activities instead of overall network traffic. HIDS was the first type of intrusion detection software to have been designed, with the original target system being the mainframe computer where outside interaction was infrequent.

One major issue with using HIDS is that it needs to be installed on each and every computer that needs protection from intrusions. This can lead to a slowdown in device performance and intrusion detection systems.

== Overview ==

A host-based IDS is capable of monitoring all or parts of the dynamic behavior and the state of a computer system, based on how it is configured. Besides such activities as dynamically inspecting network packets targeted at this specific host (optional component with most software solutions commercially available), a HIDS might detect which program accesses what resources and discover that, for example, a word-processor has suddenly and inexplicably started modifying the system password database. Similarly a HIDS might look at the state of a system, its stored information, whether in RAM, in the file system, log files or elsewhere; and check that the contents of these appear as expected, e.g. have not been changed by intruders.

One can think of a HIDS as an agent that monitors whether anything or anyone, whether internal or external, has circumvented the system&#x27;s security policy.

In comparison to network-based intrusion detection systems, HIDS is advantageous because of its capability of identifying internal attacks. While NIDS examines data from network traffic, HIDS examines data originating from operating systems. In recent years, HIDS has been faced with the big data challenge, which can be attributed to the increased advancement of data center facilities and methodologies.

=== Monitoring dynamic behavior ===
Many computer users have encountered tools that monitor dynamic system behavior in the form of anti-virus (AV) packages. While AV programs often also monitor system state, they do spend a lot of their time looking at who is doing what inside a computer – and whether a given program should or should not have access to particular system resources. The lines become blurred here, as many of the tools overlap in functionality.

Some intrusion prevention systems protect against buffer overflow attacks on system memory and can enforce security policy.

=== Monitoring state ===
The principle operation of a HIDS depends on the fact that successful intruders (hackers) will generally leave a trace of their activities. In fact, such intruders often want to &quot;own&quot; the computer they have attacked, and will establish their &quot;ownership&quot; by installing software that will grant the intruders future access to carry out whatever activity (keystroke logging, identity theft, spamming, botnet activity, spyware-usage etc.) they envisage.

In theory, a computer user has the ability to detect any such modifications, and the HIDS attempts to do just that and reports its findings.

Ideally a HIDS works in conjunction with a NIDS, such that a HIDS finds anything that slips past the NIDS. Commercially available software solutions often do correlate the findings from NIDS and HIDS in order to find out about whether a network intruder has been successful or not at the targeted host.

Most successful intruders, on entering a target machine, immediately apply best-practice security techniques to secure the system which they have infiltrated, leaving only their own backdoor open, so that other intruders can not take over &quot;their&quot; computers.

==== Technique ====
In general a HIDS uses a database (object-database) of system objects it should monitor – usually (but not necessarily) file system objects. A HIDS could also check that appropriate regions of memory have not been modified – for example, the system call table for Linux, and various vtable structures in Microsoft Windows.

For each object in question a HIDS will usually remember its attributes (permissions, size, modifications dates) and create a checksum of some kind (an MD5, SHA1 hash or similar) for the contents, if any. This information gets stored in a secure database for later comparison (checksum database).

An alternate method to HIDS would be to provide NIDS type functionality at the network interface (NIC) level of an end-point (either server, workstation or other end device). Providing HIDS at the network layer has the advantage of providing more detailed logging of the source (IP address) of the attack and attack details, such as packet data, neither of which a dynamic behavioral monitoring approach could see.

==== Operation ====
At installation time – and whenever any of the monitored objects change legitimately – a HIDS must initialize its checksum-database by scanning the relevant objects. Persons in charge of computer security need to control this process tightly in order to prevent intruders making un-authorized changes to the database(s). Such initialization thus generally takes a long time and involves cryptographically locking each monitored object and the checksum databases or worse. Because of this, manufacturers of HIDS usually construct the object-database in such a way that makes frequent updates to the checksum database unnecessary.

Computer systems generally have many dynamic (frequently changing) objects which intruders want to modify – and which a HIDS thus should monitor – but their dynamic nature makes them unsuitable for the checksum technique. To overcome this problem, HIDS employ various other detection techniques: monitoring changing file-attributes, log-files that decreased in size since last checked, and numerous other means to detect unusual events.

Once a system administrator has constructed a suitable object-database – ideally with help and advice from the HIDS installation tools – and initialized the checksum-database, the HIDS has all it requires to scan the monitored objects regularly and to report on anything that may appear to have gone wrong. Reports can take the form of logs, e-mails or similar.

=== Protecting the HIDS ===
A HIDS will usually go to great lengths to prevent the object-database, checksum-database and its reports from any form of tampering. After all, if intruders succeed in modifying any of the objects the HIDS monitors, nothing can stop such intruders from modifying the HIDS itself – unless security administrators take appropriate precautions. Many worms and viruses will try to disable anti-virus tools, for example.

Apart from crypto-techniques, HIDS might allow administrators to store the databases on a CD-ROM or on other read-only memory devices (another factor in favor of infrequent updates...) or storing them in some off-system memory. Similarly, a HIDS will often send its logs off-system immediately – typically using VPN channels to some central management system.

One could argue that the trusted platform module comprises a type of HIDS. Although its scope differs in many ways from that of a HIDS, fundamentally it provides a means to identify whether anything/anyone has tampered with a portion of a computer. Architecturally this provides the ultimate (at least ) host-based intrusion detection, as depends on hardware external to the CPU itself, thus making it that much harder for an intruder to corrupt its object and checksum databases.

==Reception==
InfoWorld states that host-based intrusion-detection system software is a useful way for network managers to find malware, and suggest they run it on every server, not just critical servers.

<doc id="1189229" wikidata="Q819484" url="?curid=1189229" title="Fokker Eindecker fighters">
<text>The Fokker &quot;Eindecker&quot; fighters were a series of German World War I monoplane single-seat fighter aircraft designed by Dutch engineer Anthony Fokker. Developed in April 1915, the first &quot;Eindecker&quot; (&quot;Monoplane&quot;) was the first purpose-built German fighter aircraft and the first aircraft to be fitted with a synchronization gear, enabling the pilot to fire a machine gun through the arc of the propeller without striking the blades. The &quot;Eindecker&quot; gave the German Army&#x27;s Air Service (then the &quot;Fliegertruppen des deutschen Kaiserreiches&quot;) a degree of air superiority from July 1915 until early 1916. This period, during which Allied aviators regarded their poorly armed aircraft as &quot;Fokker Fodder&quot;, became known as the &quot;Fokker Scourge&quot;.

==Design and development==
The &quot;Eindecker&quot; was based on Fokker&#x27;s unarmed Fokker M.5K scout (military designation Fokker A.III) which in turn was based on the design of the French Morane-Saulnier H shoulder-wing monoplane, although it differed in using chrome-molybdenum steel tubing for the fuselage structure instead of wood. It was fitted with an early version of the Fokker gun synchronizer which controlled a single Parabellum MG 14 machine gun. Anthony Fokker personally demonstrated the system on 23 May 1915, having towed the prototype aircraft behind his touring car to a military airfield near Berlin.

===&quot;Leutnant&quot; Parschau and the &quot;Green Machine&quot; (A.16/15)===
The history of the first Eindecker aircraft (Fokker factory number 216), which was used for Fokker&#x27;s initial synchronizer trials, is closely associated with Leutnant Otto Parschau, who was allotted this aircraft, then a Fokker A-series unarmed scout with the serial number A.16/15, at the beginning of World War I. This aircraft had been bought in 1913 by &quot;Oberleutnant&quot; Waldemar von Buttlar, and requisitioned by the &quot;Fliegertruppe&quot; along with his commissioning as an officer in the Prussian Army at the outbreak of hostilities, and had been painted a shade of green, the color of von Buttlar&#x27;s previous Jäger regiment. Parschau had served with the same surreptitiously named &quot;Brieftauben-Abteilung Ostende&quot; (BAO), in Belgium as &quot;Oberleutnant&quot; von Buttlar in November 1914, where the two German officers could have first made contact. Parschau eventually spent most of the first year of the war with this aircraft, flying it on both the Eastern and Western fronts. At some stage he had the words &quot;Lt. Parschau&quot; painted on the right upper side (and possibly both sides) of the fuselage behind the cockpit. This aircraft had its main fuel tank located behind the cockpit.
Near the end of May 1915, while it was based at Douai with Feldflieger Abteilung 62, the Fokker factory fitted Parschau&#x27;s aircraft with the first trial version of the Fokker &quot;Stangensteuerung&quot; synchronizer and a Parabellum MG14 light machine gun, leaving the wing panels in the stock A.III airframe&#x27;s shoulder-winged location while armed and in Parschau&#x27;s use in May and June 1915. Parschau made several attempts at aerial combat during June 1915, but at this stage the gear proved very unreliable, the Parabellum gun repeatedly jamming. As no photos exist verifying any change in wing-panel anchorage location for Parschau&#x27;s A.16/15 aircraft before its return to the Fokker factory a second time to serve as the &quot;prototype&quot; Eindecker airframe, the belief that it had been modified to have the standard mid-fuselage location used on the later production E.I airframes before its second return to the Fokker factory has not yet been proven, as it was lowered some time after the Fokker factory had received it back to be retained there, following Parschau&#x27;s final use of it. The mid-fuselage wing mount modification was not fitted to the initial batch of five M.5K/MG production prototypes as originally built, with Otto Parschau&#x27;s second Eindecker, the first M.5K/MG built bearing &quot;IdFlieg&quot; serial E.1/15 (bearing Fokker factory airframe number 191, accepted by &quot;IdFlieg&quot; on 26 May 1915 with shipping date of 15 June 1915) uniquely getting it sometime later, while in service. Production E.Is, and all further Fokker Eindeckers, were also fitted with the definitive version of the &quot;Stangensteuerung&quot; gear, with a large cam wheel replacing the early drive taken from the oil pump drive shaft.

===Sheet metal parts finish on the Eindeckers===

One distinctive feature of the appearance of all the sheet metal panelling on the Eindeckers was a special form of &quot;dragged&quot; engine turning performed on all their surfaces, both exposed and internal parts. This distinctive appearance on the sheet metal components of the Eindecker fuselage was also used on the earliest Fokker biplane fighters, like the Fokker D.I but had ceased to be used by the Fokker factory on its designs by the end of 1916.

===Fuel system details and flight characteristics===
All the E.I to E.IV &quot;Eindeckers&quot; used a gravity fuel tank which had to be constantly filled by hand-pumping from the main fuel tank, which, starting with the Fokker E.II, was mounted behind the pilot; this had to be done up to eight times an hour. Both the rudder and elevator were aerodynamically balanced; there were no fixed tail surfaces. This combination rendered the &quot;Eindecker&quot; very responsive to pitch and yaw. For an inexperienced pilot, the extreme sensitivity of the elevators made level flight difficult; German ace &quot;Leutnant&quot; Kurt Wintgens, who along with &quot;Leutnant&quot; Parschau was the primary &quot;Fliegertruppe&quot; pilot responsible for bringing the first armed Fokker monoplanes into active service during the spring and summer of 1915, once stated &quot;lightning is a straight line compared with the barogram of the first solo&quot;. However roll response was poor. 

===Engine installations and associated changes=== 
The main difference between the E.I and E.II was the engine - the former having the seven-cylinder 60 kW (80 hp) Oberursel U.0 rotary engine; the latter had the nine-cylinder 75 kW (100 hp) Oberursel U I. The larger diameter of the E.II&#x27;s nine-cylinder rotary necessitated raising the upper nose paneling to match the larger-diameter cowl the U.I needed — this also caused the outer edges of the upper nose paneling to overhang the fuselage&#x27;s upper longerons, making it necessary to extend the cowl. Production of the types, built in parallel, depended on engine availability. Many E.IIs were either completed as E.IIIs or upgraded to E.III standard when returned for repair.

The definitive version of the &quot;Eindecker&quot; was the Fokker E.III, which used a slightly narrower-chord (1.80 meter, or 71 inch) wing than earlier versions. Boelcke&#x27;s &quot;Feldflieger Abteilung&quot; 62 began operating the E.III towards the end of 1915. A few E.IIIs were experimentally armed with two 7.92 mm (.312 in) calibre lMG 08 &quot;Spandau&quot; machine guns, while most E.IIIs and the production E.I through E.III Eindecker models used only one of the same model. The final variant was the Fokker E.IV which received a 119 kW (160 hp) Oberursel U.III, 14 cylinder twin-row rotary engine (a copy of the Gnome Double Lambda rotary) and was fitted with twin machine guns as standard, after repeated failure of an experimental triple-gun installation, which was initially intended be standard for the E.IV.

Total production for the entire Fokker E.I through E.IV series was 416 aircraft (the exact breakdown by type is not clear, although the E.III was the most important model).

==Operational history==

The first &quot;Eindecker&quot; victory, though unconfirmed, was achieved by &quot;Leutnant&quot; Wintgens in the late afternoon of 1 July 1915 when, while flying one of the five M.5K/MG production prototype/&quot;service test&quot; aircraft, numbered &#x27;E.5/15&#x27; near Lunéville, he forced down a French Morane-Saulnier L two seat &quot;parasol&quot; monoplane. By this time the first E.Is were arriving as supplementary equipment, one per unit as &quot;attached&quot; aircraft, for the ordinary Feldflieger Abteilung - initially to provide escort protection for their usual quantity of six two-seat reconnaissance biplanes per unit.

Three days after his unconfirmed&quot;victory, Wintgens downed another &quot;Morane Parasol&quot; with the same aircraft, and a fortnight after his initial engagement, on 15 July 1915, he became the first Eindecker pilot to be credited with an official victory.
The two most famous &quot;Eindecker&quot; pilots, both of &quot;Feldflieger Abteilung&quot; 62, were Oswald Boelcke (initially flying M.5K/MG service test aircraft &quot;E.3/15&quot;) and Max Immelmann, - who received his first production E.I Eindecker (serial number &quot;E.13/15&quot;)( just before July 1915&#x27;s end. Both scored their first kills in E.Is in August 1915, just after Boelcke became the sole pilot flying the &quot;E.3/15&quot; service test aircraft. &quot;Leutnant&quot; Otto Parschau,flew the M.5K/MG aircraft numbered &quot;E.1/15&quot; after the Fokker factory took back his now worn-out &quot;A.16/15&quot; aircraft a second time, Immelmann&#x27;s first Eindecker survived the war.

Oswald Boelcke scored the most &quot;Eindecker&quot; victories - 19 out of his final tally of 40. His last victory in an Eindecker occurred on 27 June 1916. Max Immelmann had the second-highest &quot;Eindecker&quot; score. He achieved all of his 15 victories in the type before being killed when his E.III broke up in June 1916, possibly after the synchronisation mechanism failed during an attack on British F.E.2bs, causing at least 7 bullets to shoot through one propeller blade, which subsequently broke off. This likely resulted in vibrations so severe that the loads exceeded the structural limits of the aircraft. (Allied accounts credit Corporal J. H. Waller, gunner/observer of a RFC F.E.2b piloted by 2nd Lt G. R. McCubbin, with firing the fatal shots at Immelmann during his attack on their aircraft and was credited by the British with shooting him down.) Eleven pilots scored five or more victories in the &quot;Eindecker&quot;. Boelcke, Immelmann, Parschau, Hans Berr, and Wintgens all received Germany&#x27;s highest military decoration, the &quot;Pour le Mérite&quot; or &quot;Blue Max&quot;, while flying the Eindecker, after each pilot passed the then-required eight victory total for each aviator.

The arrival in early 1916 of the French Nieuport 11 and the British Airco DH.2 brought the dominance of the &quot;Eindecker&quot; to an end, and with it, the &quot;Fokker Scourge&quot;. Wintgens flew the E.IV version of the &quot;Eindecker&quot; long enough to have been confronted by the much more advanced SPAD S.VII fighter of French flying ace Alfred Heurteaux on 25 September 1916, which resulted in Heurteaux fatally bringing down Wintgens, as Huerteaux&#x27;s victory number eight.

:Improved production armed scout aircraft powered by a 100hp Oberursel U.I rotary engine; 49 built
;Fokker E.III
:The major production variant also powered by a 100hp Oberursel U.I rotary engine with improved structure and equipment; 249 built
;Fokker E.IV
:The final version of the early Eindeckers, the E.IV was slightly enlarged, powered by a 14-cyl. Oberursel U.III engine and armed with two machine guns above the forward fuselage; 49 built

&quot;Note: The Reinhold Platz-designed Fokker E.V bore no direct relation to the earlier Eindeckers (all designed by Martin Kreutzer), being a parasol aircraft, only built in small numbers before production switched to the improved Fokker D.VIII.&quot;

==Survivors==

Only one original &quot;Eindecker&quot; remains. On 8 April 1916, a novice German pilot took off from Valenciennes with a new E.III (IdFlieg serial number 210/16) bound for Wasquehal but became lost in haze and landed at a British aerodrome east of St. Omer. He was forced to surrender before he realised his error and could destroy the aircraft. The aircraft was test-flown against the Morane-Saulnier N and other Allied types at St. Omer before being sent to Upavon in Wiltshire for evaluation. It is now on display, without the fabric covering, at the Science Museum in London. Immelmann&#x27;s original E.I, serial number &quot;E.13/15&quot;, also survived the war and went on display in Dresden, where it was destroyed by Allied bombing during World War II.

<text>The Fokker E.I was the first fighter aircraft to enter service with the Fliegertruppe of the Deutsches Heer in World War I. Its arrival at the front in mid-1915 marked the start of a period known as the &quot;Fokker Scourge&quot; during which the E.I and its successors achieved a measure of air superiority over the Western Front.

==Design and development==
The E.I was essentially an armed version of the Fokker M.5K single-seat reconnaissance aircraft (military designation A.III), which was in turn very closely based on the design of the 1913 French Morane-Saulnier Type H. Like the Morane, the Fokker was an externally braced mid-winged monoplane with a vertically tapered box section fuselage, with fully movable horizontal and vertical stabilizing surfaces, also known as &quot;flying&quot; surfaces, giving the pilot the usual tail control functions; roll control was achieved through controlled wing warping, as was conventional in contemporary monoplanes. Wing warping was achieved through external cables attached to the wing&#x27;s rear spar, and running through a king post located in the front of the cockpit. The fuselage structure was fabric covered welded chromium-molybdenum steel tubing, the biggest difference between the Fokker and the Morane, which had an entirely wooden framework. Welded &quot;cromoly&quot; steel tube provided the basis for the structure of all Fokker fuselages for many years.

This unremarkable and derivative design was, however, transformed into a formidable fighter when it was fitted with the newly developed synchronizer gear, the Fokker &quot;Stangensteuerung&quot; system, firing a single 7.92 mm (.312 in) Parabellum LMG 14 or Spandau lMG 08 machine gun through the spinning propeller. Indeed, the five production prototype airframes for the E.I design had been ordered and were under construction as A.IIIs but were completed as M.5K/MG aircraft, retaining the earlier &quot;shoulder-wing&quot; placement of the A.III type. Subsequent production E.Is had their wings lowered slightly – as &quot;Leutnant&quot; Otto Parschau&#x27;s &quot;E.1/15&quot; had later in its career during 1915 – from the M.5&#x27;s shoulder configuration, which improved pilot visibility. (These were designated by Fokker as the M.14, which was also used for the following two &quot;Eindecker&quot; variants.)

All Fokker E.I aircraft had a 68.5 L (18.1 US gal) capacity, single gravity fuel tank, located forward of the cockpit, with a fuel gauge protruding from the sheet metal upper nose paneling, usually offset slightly to port.

==Operational history==

Two German pilots, &quot;Leutnants&quot; Otto Parschau and Kurt Wintgens, worked closely with Anthony Fokker in early 1915 during evaluation of the M.5K/MG. Wintgens is known to have downed a two-seat Morane-Saulnier Type L parasol monoplane on 1 July 1915 while flying his M.5K/MG, but as the victory occurred in the airspace behind Allied lines, over the &quot;Forêt de Parroy&quot; near Lunéville, this could not be confirmed at the time. A similar victory over another Morane &quot;Parasol&quot; two-seater, again unconfirmed, was scored by Wintgens three days later. On the 15th, Wintgens scored his first confirmed victory over a third Morane Parasol, the earliest known confirmed aerial victory for anyone flying a Fokker E-series monoplane in combat.
The M.5K/MG usually used the Parabellum MG14 machine gun for the synchronized armament, which could prove to be a troublesome arrangement, and the five M.5K/MGs built by the Fokker factory in Schwerin/Gorries retained the &quot;shoulder-wing&quot; position of the M.5k for the monoplane wing. Parschau&#x27;s E.1/15 later had its wing lowered to the &quot;mid-wing&quot; position of the production E.Is, while the remaining four were not known to have been changed. Oswald Boelcke, future German aerial tactician, was issued the third production M.5K/MG, which he flew during July 1915 with Feldfliegerabteilung 62, based at La Brayelle Airfield near Douai and shared flying time with Max Immelmann After Boelcke achieved his own first aerial victory on 4 July with an Albatros C.I armed two-seat observation aircraft, Boelcke would score his first single-seater victory with E.3/15, over a B.E.2c British two-seater near Arras on 19 August 1915. Immelmann would very soon receive his own lMG 08-armed, early production-line E.I, serialed &quot;E.13/15&quot; for his own use.
E.Is were mainly flown by regular pilots of the &quot;Fliegertruppen des deutschen Kaiserreiches&quot;, with one Eindecker attached to each six-aircraft Feldflieger Abteilung aerial observation/reconnaissance unit. The first step towards specialist fighter-only aviation units within the German military was the establishment of the so-called &quot;Kampfeinsitzer Kommando&quot; (single-seat battle unit, abbreviated as &quot;KEK&quot;) formations by Inspektor-Major Friedrich Stempel in February 1916, as the E.Is started to leave front-line service.

Following the era of the &quot;KEK&quot; units through the summer of 1916, the &quot;Fliegertruppen&quot; forces were renamed the &quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot; in October 1916, with both units directly serving the German Army; the formation of specialised &quot;Jastas&quot; (fighter squadrons) in the German air service was still to come. Two E.Is were supplied to the Austro-Hungarian air force and five to the &quot;Kaiserliche Marine&quot; in April 1916. The E.I was soon joined by the improved Fokker E.II and, as the first E.Is were entering service in June 1915, the first of the E.II type was being demonstrated by Anthony Fokker. Nevertheless, E.I production continued in parallel with the E.II, depending on the availability of the Oberursel engines. 
By 1916, a total of 54 had been manufactured and delivered to the German Army, Navy and the Austro-Hungarian army.

<text>The Fokker E.II was the second variant of the German Fokker Eindecker single-seat monoplane fighter aircraft of World War I. The E.II was essentially a Fokker E.I with the 75 kW (100 hp) Oberursel U.I 9-cylinder rotary engine, a close copy of the French Gnôme Monosoupape rotary of the same power output, in place of the E.I&#x27;s 60 kW (80 hp) Oberursel U.0, but whereas the E.I was simply a M.5K with a 7.92 mm (.312 in) machine gun bolted to it, the E.II was designed with the weapon system integrated with its airframe.

==Design and development==

On 13 June 1915, Anthony Fokker demonstrated the first E.II to an audience of German commanders, including Crown Prince Wilhelm of Germany, at a German Fifth Army airfield. On 23 and 24 June he demonstrated the aircraft at Douai to the German Sixth Army. It was during these demonstrations, only one week before any kills would be achieved in the &quot;Eindecker&quot; type, that Fokker himself attempted to engage an enemy aircraft but he was unable to find a target.

The major difference between the types was a reduced wingspan on the E.II, intended to increase speed, but handling and climbing performance suffered. The type was therefore quickly superseded by the E.III. The E.II also had a larger fuel capacity of 90 litres (23.75 US gallons) to supply the Oberursel U.I&#x27;s 54 litres/hour fuel consumption, as compared to the E.I&#x27;s 69 litres (18.2 US gallons) capacity to feed its earlier U.0 rotary, which used 37 litres/hour of fuel. As with the M.5K/MG quintet of production prototype Eindeckers, the pilot was provided with a head support to help him resist the airstream when he had to raise his head to use the gun sights.
The heavier weight of the 75 kW (100 hp) Oberursel U.I rotary engine used to power the E.II necessitated both a somewhat lengthened rear fuselage structure, in comparison to the E.I version to achieve proper balance, with the U.I engine&#x27;s larger diameter requiring a larger radius &quot;horseshoe&quot; pattern cowl to enclose it, and the aluminum upper deck of the nose was raised along with it - resulting in metal soffits having to be fitted where the upper deck met the upper longerons, with additional structural metal tubing additions to the forward ends of the upper longerons immediately behind the firewall to support the &quot;soffits&quot; and sides of the raised upper nose panel. This format was continued with the E.III.

The E.II was built in parallel with the E.I and the choice of whether an airframe became an E.I or E.II depended on the availability of engines. In total, Fokker production figures state that 49 E.IIs were built and 45 of these had been delivered to the Western Front &quot;Fliegertruppe&quot; by December 1915 (Luftstreitkräfte from October 1916 onwards) at which time production switched to the main &quot;Eindecker&quot; variant, the Fokker E.III, which used the same 75 kW (100 hp) Oberursel U.I engine. Some E.IIs under production were completed as E.IIIs and numerous E.IIs returned to Fokker&#x27;s factory for repair were upgraded to E.III specification.

<doc id="1189233" wikidata="Q8034324" url="?curid=1189233" title="Word count">
<text>The word count is the number of words in a document or passage of text. Word counting may be needed when a text is required to stay within certain numbers of words. This may particularly be the case in academia, legal proceedings, journalism and advertising. Word count is commonly used by translators to determine the price of a translation job. Word counts may also be used to calculate measures of readability and to measure typing and reading speeds (usually in words per minute). When converting character counts to words, a measure of 5 or 6 characters to a word is generally used for English.

== Software ==
Modern web browsers support word counting via extensions, via a JavaScript bookmarklet, or a script that is hosted in a website. Most word processors can also count words. Unix-like systems include a program, &quot;wc&quot;, specifically for word counting. There are a wide variety of word counting tools available online.
Different word counting programs may give varying results, depending on the text segmentation rule details. The exact number of words often is not a strict requirement, thus the variation is acceptable.

== In fiction ==
Novelist Jane Smiley suggests that length is an important quality of the novel. However, novels can vary tremendously in length; Smiley lists novels as typically being between 100,000 and 175,000 words, while National Novel Writing Month requires its novels to be at least 50,000 words. There are no firm rules: for example, the boundary between a novella and a novel is arbitrary and a literary work may be difficult to categorise. But while the length of a novel is mainly dependent on its writer, lengths may also vary by subgenre; many chapter books for children start at a length of about 16,000 words, and a typical mystery novel might be in the 60,000 to 80,000 word range while a thriller could be well over 100,000 words.

The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America specifies word lengths for each category of its Nebula Award categories:

== In non-fiction ==
The acceptable length of an academic dissertation varies greatly, dependent predominantly on the subject. Numerous American universities limit Ph.D. dissertations to 100,000 words, barring special permission for exceeding this limit.

<doc id="1189234" wikidata="Q602325" url="?curid=1189234" title="Fokker E.III">
<text>The Fokker E.III was the main variant of the &quot;Eindecker&quot; (literally meaning &quot;one wing&quot;) fighter aircraft of World War I. It entered service on the Western Front in December 1915 and was also supplied to Austria-Hungary and Turkey.

==Design and development==
The E.III was basically an E.II fitted with larger, newly designed wings that had a slightly narrower chord of 1.80 meters ( in), compared to 1.88 meters (74 in) on the earlier Eindeckers, going back to Fokker&#x27;s original M.5 monoplane aircraft. The E.III retained the same 75 kW (100 hp) Oberursel U.I engine, and therefore also used the larger-diameter &quot;horseshoe&quot; pattern cowling that also mandated the inclusion of the E.II&#x27;s soffit-like extensions to the sides of the upper nose sheet metalwork, but had a larger 81 L (21.5 gal) drum-shaped main fuel tank just behind the cockpit, which increased the &quot;Eindecker&quot;″s endurance to about hours, an hour more than the E.II. Most E.IIIs were armed with a single 7.92 mm (.312 in) Spandau LMG 08 machine gun with 500 rounds of ammunition; however, after the failure of the twin-gun Fokker E.IV as a viable successor, some E.IIIs were fitted with twin guns.

Fokker production figures state that 249 E.IIIs were manufactured; however, a number of the 49 E.IIs were upgraded to E.III standard when they were returned to Fokker&#x27;s Schwerin factory for repairs.

==Operational history==
The E.III was the first type to arrive in sufficient numbers to form small specialist fighter units, &quot;Kampfeinsitzer Kommandos&quot; (KEK) in early 1916. Previously, &quot;Eindeckers&quot; had been allocated singly, just as the E.I and E.II had been, to the front-line &quot;Feldflieger Abteilungen&quot; that carried out reconnaissance duties. On 10 August 1916, the first German &quot;Jagdstaffeln&quot; (single-seat fighter squadrons) were formed, initially equipped with various early fighter types, including a few E.IIIs, which were by then outmoded and being replaced by more modern fighters. Standardisation in the &quot;Jagdstaffeln&quot; (and any real success) had to wait for the availability in numbers of the Albatros D.I and Albatros D.II in early 1917.

Turkish E.IIIs were based at Beersheba in Palestine while others operated in Mesopotamia during the Siege of Kut-al-Amara.

==Surviving aircraft==

The only known surviving original &quot;Eindecker&quot;, bearing IdFlieg serial number 210/16, was brought down in the Somme area in 1916 by the British and then evaluated by the War Office until it was transferred to the London Science Museum in 1918. It is currently on display fully assembled, but with its fabric covering removed to illustrate its internal construction.

<text>The Fokker E.IV was the final variant of the &quot;Eindecker&quot; fighter aircraft that was operated by Germany during World War I.

==Design and development==

Given the Fokker designation of M.15, the E.IV was essentially a lengthened Fokker E.III powered by the 119 kW (160 hp) Oberursel U.III two-row, 14-cylinder rotary engine, a copy of the Gnome Double Lambda. The more powerful engine was intended to enable the &quot;Eindecker&quot; to carry two or three 7.92 mm (.312 in) machine guns, thereby increasing its firepower and providing redundancy if one gun jammed - a common occurrence at the time. However, the E.IV was a troubled design that never achieved the success of its predecessor and was soon outclassed by French and British fighters.

The prototype E.IV was accepted for testing by the German &quot;Inspektion der Fliegertruppen&quot; in September 1915. It was fitted with three forward-firing 7.92 mm (.312 in) lMG 08 &quot;Spandau&quot; machine guns, mounted to fire upwards at 15°. Anthony Fokker demonstrated the E.IV at Essen but the complicated triple-synchronization gear failed and the propeller was damaged. The removal of the left-side gun is believed to have been pioneered on Oswald Boelcke&#x27;s E.IV, believed to have borne IdFlieg serial 123/15, with a simpler double-synchronisation system used on the retained center-line and right side MG 08 Spandau guns. The fitment of dual MG 08 &quot;Spandau&quot; forward-firing synchronized machine guns became the standard armament for production E.IVs, and indeed for all subsequent German D-type biplane fighters. The angling of the guns was also abandoned.

==Operational history==
The modified prototype underwent combat evaluation on the Western Front by &quot;Oberleutnant&quot; Otto Parschau in October 1915, making it the first twin-gun fighter in service. Leading German ace Oswald Boelcke evaluated the E.IV at Fokker&#x27;s Schwerin factory in November. The pilots discovered that mounting the much heavier Oberursel U.III onto the &quot;Eindecker&quot; airframe did not produce a better aircraft - one pilot described it as &quot;practically a flying engine.&quot; The inertial and gyroscopic forces of the spinning mass made the E.IV less manoeuvrable than the E.III and any loss of efficiency from the notoriously unreliable engine made the aircraft virtually uncontrollable, requiring the engine to be switched off. Turning under such conditions was exceedingly difficult because the E.IV still used wing warping instead of ailerons. Furthermore, the engine worked well when new, but lost power after only a few hours of operation.

Only 49 E.IVs were built out of the total &quot;Eindecker&quot; production run of 416 aircraft. Over half of the E.IVs entered service in June 1916 and the last were delivered in December 1916 by which time they were obsolete.

==Operators==
*&quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot; operated 48 aircraft.
*&quot;Kaiserliche Marine&quot; received one aircraft.

<doc id="1189242" wikidata="Q4951389" url="?curid=1189242" title="Bowraville, New South Wales">
<text>Bowraville is a small town in the Mid North Coast hinterland of New South Wales, Australia in the Nambucca Valley. The town is known for tourism with attractions such as a folk museum, a war museum, a historic theatre, and other historic buildings.

Bowraville is considered one of the most disadvantaged towns in New South Wales with low income levels, high unemployment, and a high proportion of students not meeting education standards. On 5 November 2011, however, Bowraville was honoured as the Winner of the Cultural Heritage Award and came third overall in the Tidy Towns Awards by Keep Australia Beautiful – Tidy Towns.

==History==
The Indigenous Gumbaynggirr and Ngaku people have inhabited the area for thousands of years, and today around 15% of the population are Indigenous Australians. The Gumbaynggirr lands cover an area of the Mid North Coast from the Nambucca River to as far north as the Clarence River (Grafton), west to Armidale and eastward to the Pacific coast. The area was mostly subtropical rainforest until the arrival of Europeans.

The word Bowra comes from the Gumbaynggirr place name, &quot;Bawrrung&quot;, which possibly means cabbage tree palm. Other definitions given have been &#x27;bullrout fish&#x27;, &#x27;scrub turkey&#x27; or &#x27;bald head&#x27;. Originally named Bowra, the &quot;ville&quot; was added to the name in the 1870s to avoid confusion with the Southern Highlands town of Bowral.

In March 1841, Clement Hodgkinson explored the upper reaches of the Nambucca and Bellinger Rivers. He was the first European to make contact with the local Aboriginal communities. The township grew up in the 1850s and 1860s.

The town was gazetted in 1870 and Bowraville Post Office opened on 1 August 1870., and became the main centre of the Nambucca Valley. Its early industries were mainly timber and dairy, and the town eventually came to inherit the Nambucca Shire Council chambers. From about the 1960s, however, Bowraville began to decline in popularity and wealth.

===Timber Industry===
White settlement began in the area with the timber-getters. The first timber-getter into the area was Mr William Scott (after whom Scotts Head is named). The most popular timber was by far red cedar, of which there are now few trees left. Hoop pine was also popular. Like many Australian timber towns of this era, the town thrived for several decades, and by the 1870s boasted two hotels, several general stores, a blacksmith&#x27;s, tailor, post office, a school and a number of churches.

===Agriculture===
By the 1880s the district was also an important dairy and pig raising area. Timber began to decline as the dominant industry by the early 20th Century, as the supply became scarce. Many jobs have been lost in recent years with the decline of the timber industry however agriculture has diversified from the traditional core of dairy farming to include beef cattle. The area has also seen the development of such activities as macadamia farms, avocado growers, agro forestry, bush foods, alpacas and organic vegetables.

The town remained relatively static throughout the 20th Century but by the 1980s this area of the New South Wales coast was attracting people looking for a better lifestyle. Today this is apparent in venues like the restored historical theatre in the main street.

=== Murders ===

Between 1990 and 1991, three children in Bowraville were murdered. Despite two trials and much publicity, there have been no convictions for the murders. On 26 May 2016, after efforts of the families and two refusals from the Attorneys General, then Attorney General of New South Wales Gabrielle Upton announced that the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal would hear the case. Publicity generated by a popular podcast from &quot;The Australian&quot; called &quot;Bowraville&quot; possibly helped finally create enough public pressure to force the Attorney General in this decision.

==Bowra Theatre==
The Bowraville Theatre has become a popular tourist attraction on the Mid North Coast hinterland. Built in 1940 as a picture theatre, it was derelict for many years but it now operates as a performance space for the local theatre group, writers&#x27; group, and choir, as well as in its traditional role as a cinema. The local community brought the theatre back to life, through volunteer work and fund raising. The restored foyer was opened at the end of 2002 and on Friday 29 August 2003, the theatre re-opened its doors. The Indigenous community held a smoking ceremony and performed a welcome dance.

Like many businesses in country towns at the time of its construction, the theatre operated as a racially divided business. Aboriginal people had to buy their tickets separately, enter the theatre by a separate side entrance, sit in inferior seating below an interior partition and were permitted to do so only after the program had begun. As a result, the theatre was a stop-off on the 1965 Freedom Ride which saw students from University of Sydney tour regional NSW to highlight racism against Aboriginal people.

==Demographics==

According to the 2016 Australian census the median age in Bowraville is 45. The population of the town is 1,122, a decrease from 1,208 in 2011. 14.8% of residents are Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander with the median age among this group being 21. Bowraville has a higher than average number of residents aged 65+.

84.6% of residents reported being born in Australia, higher than the national average of 66.7%. Other than Australia the most common countries of birth are England (3.3%), New Zealand (1.4%) and Germany (0.6%). 75.3% also report both parents having been born in Australia, significantly higher than the national average of 47.3%. 90.0% of people spoke only English at home.

The top religious groups in Bowraville are Anglican 22.7%, Catholic 21.7% and Uniting Church 5.7%. 26.8% of residents report no religion.

<text>Brahim Boulami (; born April 20, 1972 in Safi) is a Moroccan athlete who set two world records in the 3,000 meter steeplechase, 7:55.28 and 7:53.17. The latter was overturned because he tested positive for the banned performance-enhancing drug EPO. Boulami was banned for two years in 2002 after the positive test. His time of 7:55.28 in the 3000 meter steeplechase from the year before the positive test is currently the fourth fastest ever run.

His older brother Khalid Boulami is an Olympic bronze medalist.

<text>The Museum of Fine Arts (often abbreviated as MFA Boston or MFA) is an art museum in Boston, Massachusetts. It is the 20th-largest art museum in the world, measured by public gallery area. It contains 8,161 paintings and more than 450,000 works of art, making it one of the most comprehensive collections in the Americas. With more than 1.2 million visitors a year, it is the 79th-most-visited art museum in the world .

Founded in 1870 in Copley Square, the museum moved to its current Fenway location in 1909. It is affiliated with the School of the Museum of Fine Arts at Tufts.

==History==

===1870–1907===

The Museum of Fine Arts was founded in 1870 and was initially located on the top floor of the Boston Athenæum. Most of its initial collection came from the Athenæum&#x27;s Art Gallery. In 1876, the museum moved to a highly ornamented brick Gothic Revival building designed by John Hubbard Sturgis and Charles Brigham, noted for its massed architectural terracotta. It was located in Copley Square at Dartmouth and St. James Streets. It was built almost entirely of brick and terracotta, which was imported from England, with some stone about its base. After the MFA moved out in 1909, this original building was demolished, and the Copley Plaza Hotel (now the Fairmont Copley Plaza) replaced it in 1912. During the early years of the museum, Charles Greely Loring, a former Union Army general, served as its first director, leading from 1876 to early 1902 when he resigned for health reasons.

===1907–1999===
In 1907, plans were laid to build a new home for the museum on Huntington Avenue in Boston&#x27;s Fenway–Kenmore neighborhood, near the recently opened Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. Museum trustees hired architect Guy Lowell to create a design for a museum that could be built in stages, as funding was obtained for each phase. Two years later, the first section of Lowell&#x27;s neoclassical design was completed. It featured a façade of granite and a grand rotunda. The museum moved to its new location in 1909.

The second phase of construction built a wing along The Fens to house painting galleries. It was funded entirely by Maria Antoinette Evans Hunt, the wife of wealthy business magnate Robert Dawson Evans, and opened in 1915. From 1916 through 1925, the noted artist John Singer Sargent painted the frescoes that adorn the rotunda and the associated colonnades, using a young Black model, Thomas McKeller, as his inspiration for Apollo and the other Greek gods depicted in these murals.

The Decorative Arts Wing was built in 1928, and expanded in 1968. An addition designed by Hugh Stubbins and Associates was built in 1966–1970, and another expansion by The Architects Collaborative opened in 1976. The West Wing, now the Linde Family Wing for Contemporary Art, was designed by I. M. Pei and opened in 1981. This wing now houses the museum&#x27;s cafe, restaurant, meeting rooms, classrooms, and a giftshop/bookstore, as well as large exhibition spaces. In 1978, the Asiatic Wing was closed because the lack of climate control was jeopardizing the collection. A new control system was contingent upon the completion of the West Wing, and the Asiatic Wing reopened in 1982. The Tenshin-En Japanese Garden designed by Kinsaku Nakane opened in 1988, and the Norma Jean Calderwood Garden Court and Terrace opened in 1997.

===2000–present===

In the mid-2000s, the museum launched a major effort to renovate and expand its facilities. In a seven-year fundraising campaign between 2001 and 2008 for a new wing, the endowment, and operating expenses, the museum managed to receive over $500 million, in addition to acquiring over $160 million worth of art.

In 2007, the MFA announced its purchase of a nearby building then occupied by the Forsyth Institute, a dental and craniofacial research organization located at 140 Fenway. The original Beaux Arts building dates from around 1910, and was later expanded with a Brutalist annex building. The entire property comprised approximately on of land, located across the street from the main MFA building. , the building is leased to nearby Northeastern University.

During the Great Recession, the museum&#x27;s annual budget was trimmed by $1.5 million. The museum increased revenues by organizing traveling exhibitions, which included a loan exhibition sent to the for-profit Bellagio in Las Vegas in exchange for $1 million. In 2011, Moody&#x27;s Investors Service calculated that the museum had over $180 million in outstanding debt. However, the agency cited growing attendance, a large endowment, and positive cash flow as reasons to believe that the museum&#x27;s finances would become stable in the near future. In 2011, the museum put eight paintings by Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley, Gauguin, and others on sale at Sotheby&#x27;s, bringing in a total of $21.6 million, to pay for &quot;Man at His Bath&quot; by Gustave Caillebotte at a cost reported to be more than $15 million.

A renovation included the new Art of the Americas Wing, featuring artwork from North, South, and Central America. In 2006, the groundbreaking ceremonies took place. The new wing and adjoining Ruth and Carl J. Shapiro Family Courtyard (a bright, cavernous interior space) were designed in a restrained, contemporary style by the London-based architectural firm Foster and Partners, under the directorship of Thomas T. Difraia and Childs Bertman Tseckares Architects (CBT). The landscape architecture firm Gustafson Guthrie Nichol redesigned the Huntington Avenue and Fenway entrances, gardens, access roads, and interior courtyards.

The wing opened on November 20, 2010, with free admission to the public. Mayor Thomas Menino declared it &quot;Museum of Fine Arts Day&quot;, and more than 13,500 visitors attended the opening. The glass-enclosed courtyard now features a high glass sculpture, titled the &quot;Lime Green Icicle Tower&quot;, by Dale Chihuly. In 2014, the Art of the Americas Wing was recognized for its high architectural achievement by the award of the Harleston Parker Medal, by the Boston Society of Architects.

In 2015, the museum renovated its outdoors Japanese garden, Tenshin-en. The garden, which originally opened in 1988, had been designed by Japanese professor Kinsaku Nakane. The garden&#x27;s &quot;kabukimon&quot;-style entrance gate was built by Chris Hall of Massachusetts, using traditional Japanese carpentry techniques.

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the museum was closed from March 12, 2020, through September 25, 2020. To recover from the drop in attendance caused by the pandemic, a new logo and branding campaign were announced in September 2022, along with renewed community outreach efforts. These changes were announced in tandem with the opening of the traveling exhibition of an official portrait of former US president Barack Obama by Kehinde Wiley and the accompanying portrait of Michelle Obama by Amy Sherald, both on loan from the National Portrait Gallery in Washington DC.

In November 2020 a significant number of MFA employees voted to unionize due to a long history of unaddressed issues related to workplace conditions and compensation inequities. The workers unionized with the local chapter of the United Auto Workers. After over 96% of the union agreed in a vote, MFA staff went on a strike for the first time on November 17, 2021. Union representatives cited unresponsive engagement from MFA management over multiple issues including stagnant wages, job security, and workplace diversity, as the reason for the strike. The union pointed out that employee wages had been frozen for two years, and that management had so far only offered a 1.75% percent raise over the course of four years. Union representatives contrasted this with MFA director Matthew Teitelbaum&#x27;s salary which, clocking in at nearly US$1 million, was almost 19 times larger than the average MFA worker.

==Collection==
The Museum of Fine Arts possesses materials from a wide variety of art movements and cultures. The museum also maintains a large online database with information on over 346,000 items from its collection, accompanied with digitized images. Online search is freely available through the Internet. The museum also maintains the Conservation and Art Materials Encyclopedia Online, (CAMEO) a database that &quot;compiles, defines, and disseminates technical information on the distinct collection of terms, materials, and techniques used in the fields of art conservation and historic preservation&quot;. CAMEO uses MediaWiki.

Some highlights of the collection include:
* Ancient Egyptian artifacts including sculptures, sarcophagi, and jewelry dating back to approximately 6500 BCE to 600 CE, which were primarily obtained through excavations conducted by George A. Reisner in Egypt and Sudan between 1905 and 1942.
* The Nubian arts, including Kerma pottery, colossal royal statues of Napatan kings, jewels, and imports from Greece and Rome, are represented in the collection of Nubian art.
* Dutch Golden Age painting, including 113 works given in 2017 by collectors Rose-Marie and Eijk van Otterloo and Susan and Matthew Weatherbie. The gift includes works from 76 artists, as well as the Haverkamp-Begemann Library, a collection of more than 20,000 books, donated by the van Otterloos. The donors are also establishing a dedicated Netherlandish art center and scholarly institute at the museum.
* French Impressionist and Post-Impressionist works by artists such as Paul Gauguin, Édouard Manet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Edgar Degas, Claude Monet, Camille Pissarro, Vincent van Gogh, and Paul Cézanne

=== Japanese art ===

The collection of Japanese art at the Museum of Fine Arts is the largest in the world outside of Japan. Anne Nishimura Morse, the William and Helen Pounds Senior Curator of Japanese Art, oversees 100,000 total items that include 4,000 Japanese paintings, 5,000 ceramic pieces, and over 30,000 ukiyo-e prints.

The base of this collection was assembled in the late 19th century through the efforts of four men, Ernest Fenollosa, Kakuzo Okakura, William Sturgis Bigelow, and Edward Sylvester Morse, each of whom had spent time in Japan and admired Japanese art. Their combined donations account for up to 75 percent of the current collection. In 1890, the Museum of Fine Arts became the first museum in the United States to establish a collection and appoint a curator specifically for Japanese art.

Another part of this collection is a number of Buddhist statues. In the later Meiji era of Japan, around the turn of the 20th century, government policy deemphasizing Buddhism in favor of Shintoism and financial pressures on temples resulted in a number of Buddhist statues being sold to private collectors. Some of these statutes came into the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts. Today, these statues are the subject of preservation and restoration efforts, which have been at times viewable by the public in special exhibits. In recent years, the museum has also collected a number of works by contemporary Japanese artists. In 2011, they acquired &quot;Zetsu&quot; &quot;no. 8&quot; (絶), the largest work in ceramicist Jun Nishida&#x27;s &quot;Zetsu (絶)&quot; series.

Also important for this collection is the exhibition of its items in Japan. From 1999 to 2018, regular exchange of items was conducted between the Museum of Fine Arts and its sister museum, the now-closed Nagoya/Boston Museum of Fine Arts. In 2012, the traveling exhibition &quot;Japanese Masterpieces from the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston&quot; visited the Japanese cities of Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka and Fukuoka, and was well received.

In 2023 the museum held an exhibition entitled &quot;Hokusai: Inspiration and Influence&quot; celebrating the origins, works, and cultural impact of Japanese artist Hokusai.

===Restitution claims===
In April 2024, the museum donated several 14th-century Buddhist Śarīra relics that were in its collection since 1939 to the Jogye Order as part of an agreement to repatriate artifacts taken from Korea during the Japanese Occupation. The relics will be transferred to the Heoam Temple in Yangju, South Korea, where they are believed to have originated.

==Libraries==

The libraries at the Museum of Fine Arts consist of a main library, eight curatorial departmental libraries, and the Center for Netherlandish Art Library. Collectively they hold over 450,000 items, including 60,000 art auction catalogs, and 150,000 periodicals and ephemera. The main branch, the William Morris Hunt Memorial Library, is named after the noted American artist. In 2021, the main library moved after 18 years at Horticultural Hall, two stops away on the MBTA Green Line. The new entrance for the library is on the first floor of the museum, near Sharf Information Center, in front of the Nina Saunders Suite. About one-quarter of the collection was planned to be housed on the third floor of the museum, along with the book conservation facilities, with the remainder stored off-site. The main library had been open to the public, and the catalog could be searched online through the Fenway Libraries Online (FLO). It is open to researchers for two three-hour sessions per week, but only by appointment requested two weeks in advance, and subject to approval. Exhibitions organized by the library staff in coordination with the School of the Museum of Fine Arts at Tufts have been debuted two to three times per year.

== Community relations ==
The MFA also has a longstanding initiative within the Community Arts program called the Community Artist Initiative Artist Project, where the museum invites a Lead Artist to spend nine months creating works with youth from twelve after-school community organizations in the Boston area. The Artist and the children create a collaborative work of art inspired by the Museum&#x27;s encyclopedic collection, and the completed project is exhibited in the Edward H. Linde Gallery (168) in the Linde Family Wing for Contemporary Art at the MFA.

The MFA offers accessibility accommodations for visitors who may be visually, audibly, or physically impaired. Special programming and tours are available for blind, ASL-fluent, cognitively-impaired, autistic, and medically assisted guests. In the spring of 2019 it installed new signage for its restrooms, in an effort towards &quot;restroom accessibility for people of all genders and abilities.&quot;

The MFA publicly apologized in May 2019 after African-American and mixed-race 12- and 13-year-old visitors were allegedly targeted by employees and told &quot;No food, no drink, and no watermelon&quot;, which is considered a racial slur in the US. A museum spokesperson said that the warning was actually &quot;no water bottles&quot;, but conceded that there was no way of definitively proving what was actually said. Regardless, all museum staff dealing with school groups were to be retrained in interactions with their guests. The MFA also concluded that two of its members had been deliberately racist, and permanently banned them from visiting its grounds.

In 2019 the MFA debuted its newly renamed &quot;Indigenous Peoples&#x27; Day&quot; (formerly Columbus Day) celebrations, with a focus on Native American art and culture. The events included special displays related to Cyrus Dallin&#x27;s 1908 &quot;Appeal to the Great Spirit&quot;, a popular and sometimes controversial sculpture of a Native American warrior located in front of the Huntington Avenue main entrance since 1912. Community comments and feedback concerning the monumental artwork were solicited and displayed. Earlier, in March 2019, the MFA had held a special public symposium to discuss the historical background and present-day significance of the sculpture.

In 2020 the MFA had planned to offer 11 annual Community Celebrations, featuring free admission for all visitors, and special events such as dance performances, music, tours, craft demonstrations, and hands-on art making. This series included day-long Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Lunar New Year, Memorial Day, Highland Street Foundation Free Fun Friday, and Indigenous Peoples&#x27; Day celebrations. In addition, on Wednesday evenings, which were already free from 4pm to 10pm, special celebrations of Nowruz, Juneteenth, Latinx Heritage Night, ASL Night, Diwali, and Hanukkah were featured.

To commemorate its 150th anniversary, the MFA offered a free one-year family membership to anyone who attended one of its special Community Celebrations or MFA Late Nite programs during 2020. This &quot;First Year Free Membership&quot; program was available to anyone who had not previously been a member of the museum. The 150th year exhibitions included major shows and events featuring art by women and minority artists.

== Special exhibitions ==
The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, hosts special exhibitions consisting of items borrowed from other museums. These limited time events extend for several months and there are typically three exhibitions taking place concurrently since at least 1996. The collection topics of the special exhibits are divided into 13 categories: Africa and Oceania; Americas; Ancient Egypt, Nubia and the near East; Ancient Greece and Rome; Asia; Contemporary Art; Europe; Jewelry; Judaica; Musical Instruments; Photography; Prints and Drawings; and Textile and Fashion Arts. Most special exhibitions take place at the following galleries: Edward and Nancy Roberts Family Gallery, Linde Family Wing for Contemporary Art, Ann and Graham Gund Gallery, Edward H. Linde Gallery. The exhibitions are usually open to public with a variety of ticket prices. Members of MFA, Boston can also enjoy free admission to any special exhibitions.

=== &quot;Philip Guston Now&quot; ===
&quot;Philip Guston Now&quot; is an exhibition organized by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; the National Gallery of Art, Washington; the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston; and Tate Modern, London. This show is also considered as America&#x27;s most controversial art exhibition, as of May 2022. Its controversies are mainly due to much of his work addressing and confronting topics such as white supremacy, racism, anti-Semitism, and violence It was originally planned to open in June 2020, but due to nationwide protests for racial equality, it was postponed to open at May. 1, 2022. The museums were aware of its controversies, so they opened a comment area on their official website for the public to share their thoughts with the museum.

<text>Harry Blanshard Wood, VC, MM (21 June 1882 – 15 August 1924) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Harry Wood was born 21 June 1882 in Newton on Derwent, Yorkshire, the son of John Wood, an agricultural labourer, and Maria Nichol Dey.

At 37 years old, Harry was a corporal in the 2nd Battalion, Scots Guards, British Army during the First World War when the deed for which he was awarded the VC took place. On 13 October 1918 at Saint-Python, France, when the advance was desperately opposed and the streets of the village were raked by fire, Corporal Wood&#x27;s platoon sergeant was killed and he took command of the leading platoon. The River Selle had to be crossed and the ruined bridge gained, although the space in front of it was full of snipers, so the corporal carried a very large brick into the open space, lay down behind it and, firing continuously on the snipers, covered his men while they worked their way across. Later in the day he repeatedly drove off enemy counter-attacks.

He later achieved the rank of Lance-Sergeant.

His nerves were badly affected by his wartime experiences. He died 15 August 1924 whilst on holiday; he was walking with his wife when a car mounted the pavement and headed towards them. His wife pushed him out of the way but she was pinned against the wall. She suffered minor injuries but her husband was so shocked that he collapsed and fell into a coma from which he died several days later. He was buried at Arnos Vale Cemetery, Bristol, England, at Soldiers&#x27; Corner, grave number 1738.

His Victoria Cross is on display at York Castle Museum.

<text>The Mid North Coast is a country region in the north-east of the state of New South Wales, Australia. The region, situated 416km north of Sydney, covers the mid northern coast of the state, beginning from Port Stephens at Hawks Nest to as far north as Woolgoolga, near Coffs Harbour. The region has many beaches and subtropical national parks and forests as well as rural farmland and logging. Major coastal towns include Coffs Harbour, Forster and Port Macquarie. The Mid North Coast is a popular destination for camping or resorts and surfing, with coastal and hinterland tracks, with the unique heritage-listed mountain village of Bellbrook popular for day trips inland or 4wd campers and keen bass fishers.

Heading northwards beyond Newcastle, the Mid North Coast region&#x27;s main towns include the towns of Bulahdelah, Forster, Tuncurry, Wingham, Taree, Port Macquarie, Kempsey, South West Rocks, Macksville, Nambucca Heads, Bellingen and Coffs Harbour. Of these Taree, Port Macquarie and Coffs Harbour are the major commercial centres, all with large shopping centres, public facilities and attractions. Kempsey and Forster-Tuncurry are considered semi-major commercial centres. Smaller towns that are popular tourist spots are Bellbrook, North Haven, South West Rocks, Urunga, Gloucester, Crescent Head, Hawks Nest, Woolgoolga, Old Bar, Lake Cathie and Pacific Palms.

The region has a subtropical climate and is known for its waterways, beaches and hinterland of forests and farms. Major industries are farming, logging and tourism.

==Demography and area==

The following local government areas are contained within the region:

== Public transport ==

===Bus===
Many bus services run throughout the region. Providers include Buslines, Busways, Eggins, Ryans and Sawtell Coaches.

=== Rail ===

There are several railway stations on the Mid North Coast serviced by three trains; the Grafton, the Casino and the Brisbane XPT trains. Each run north and south once a day. Heading north from Sydney Central, the first station on the mid north coast is Gloucester followed by Wingham and Taree. Further north are Kendall, Wauchope (for Port Macquarie), Kempsey, Eungai, Macksville, Nambucca Heads, Urunga, Sawtell and Coffs Harbour. There is no station for Forster–Tuncurry.

==Politics==
The Mid North Coast includes six local government areas: the City of Coffs Harbour, the Bellingen Shire, the Kempsey Shire, the Mid-Coast Council, the Nambucca Shire and the Port Macquarie-Hastings Council. It also includes four state electorates (Coffs Harbour, Myall Lakes, Oxley and Port Macquarie) and two federal electorates (Cowper and Lyne).

The region is conservative and is dominated by the Coalition in state and federal politics, particularly the National Party. Of the two federal electorates, Cowper has only been held by Labor once (for one term) and Lyne has never been held by Labor (although was held by an independent for five years). In state politics, the Coalition safely holds all Mid North Coast electorates (the Nationals hold Coffs Harbour, Myall Lakes and Oxley while the Liberal Party holds Port Macquarie).

In the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey, a 2017 plebiscite eventually legalising same-sex marriage in Australia, both of the federal Mid North Coast electorates recorded majorities for the &quot;yes&quot; vote, while in the 1999 Australian republic referendum and the 2023 Australian Indigenous Voice referendum, they both recorded majorities for the &quot;no&quot; vote.

<text>Manhattan University (previously Manhattan College) is a private, Catholic university in New York City. Originally established in 1853 by the Brothers of the Christian Schools (De La Salle Christian Brothers) as an academy for day students, it was later incorporated as an institution of higher education through a charter granted by the New York State Board of Regents. In 1922, it moved from Manhattan to the Riverdale section of the Bronx, roughly north of its original location on 131st Street in Manhattanville.

==History==

Manhattan University was founded as the Academy of the Holy Infancy in 1853 by five French De La Salle Christian Brothers in a small building on Canal Street. When the need to expand forced them from Lower Manhattan, the college moved to 131st Street and Broadway, in the Manhattanville section of Harlem. The school&#x27;s name was changed to Manhattan College when it received its state charter in 1863 from the Board of Regents, and moved to its present location in the Riverdale section of the Bronx in 1922 as it outgrew its facilities in Manhattanville. This is often the cause of some confusion as the college is located outside of Manhattan but still within the city limits of New York City. In 2024, the school changed its name to Manhattan University.

Originally exclusive to men, Manhattan University established a co-institutional, cooperative program with the College of Mount Saint Vincent in 1963. Later the pair became coeducational in 1973 and 1974, respectively. This partnership lasted until 2007. Since then, Manhattan University and the College of Mount Saint Vincent have operated as completely unaffiliated institutions.

In 2018, Thomas O&#x27;Malley (Class of 1963) donated $25 million, the largest donation in the institution&#x27;s history. The institution&#x27;s business school has since been renamed the O&#x27;Malley School of Business.

===Declining enrollment and growing deficits (2023–present)===
In late 2023 and early 2024, Manhattan College eliminated more than twenty major and minor programs and terminated over 25% of faculty due to persistent declining enrollment and increasing structural deficits. In late January 2024, faculty voted &quot;no confidence&quot; in the college&#x27;s president. From 2020 to 2024, enrollment at Manhattan College decreased by over 30%. Manhattan merged three of the college&#x27;s six schools, creating three new schools. The bond-rating agency Fitch Ratings downgraded the college’s outlook to negative in March 2024. 

In August 2024, Manhattan College officials announced that the college would be renamed Manhattan University; the renaming was intended to attract students.

==Campus==


Manhattan University occupies a relatively compact campus divided into a north and south campus in the residential Riverdale section of the Bronx. The North campus overlooks Van Cortlandt Park, and has as its focal point &quot;the Quad&quot;, which sits at the center of the campus&#x27;s four main buildings. Memorial Hall is the main entry onto campus and houses the office of the president as well as most of the other administrative offices on campus. Miguel Hall and De La Salle Hall are the main academic halls that border each side of the Quad. Miguel hosts the liberal arts department and classes, while De La Salle is primarily used by the O&#x27;Malley School of Business. The fourth side of the Quad is bordered by the Squeri Hall, which houses Smith Auditorium (used to host receptions, speakers, and performances) on the first floor and the Chapel of De La Salle and His Brothers on the second floor, which features a painting of De La Salle and Brothers behind the altar, a large performing area where musical events and concerts take place on the altar, a grand piano, and a pipe organ in the balcony.

Thomas Hall, one of the institution&#x27;s student life buildings, houses the offices of the dean of students, the student government, the musical ensembles, and others. Two of the institution&#x27;s dining halls, Locke&#x27;s Loft and Cafe 1853 are also located in Thomas Hall.

Kelly Commons, named after notable alumnus Raymond Kelly, is another student life building that was completed in 2014. It holds a Starbucks, a Marketplace, multiple different dining options, a state-of-the-art gym for student and faculty use, the Multicultural Center, halls for lectures and events, the student bookstore and the office for the student-run newspaper, &quot;The Quadrangle&quot;.

The O&#x27;Malley Library is a six-story structure that was joined with the previous library, the Cardinal Hayes Pavilion. Built on a hill, the new library was built directly next to and above the old one, essentially combining the two and creating more floors, while enhancing technology and adding group study spaces. The Office of Admissions is on the sixth floor of O&#x27;Malley.

Hayden Hall is on the east side of campus and houses the Kakos School of Science as well as the department of fine arts. The Kakos Center for Scientific Computing may also be found here, which contains a cluster of high performance workstations used for a wide variety of scientific and economic projects.

On the South campus, across 240th street, is the Higgins &#x27;62 Engineering and Science Center, which is connected to Leo Hall and the Research and Learning Center (RLC). The buildings are home to all of the engineering departments: electrical, computer, civil, chemical, mechanical, and environmental, along with the math and computer science departments and all communication classrooms, computer labs, and broadcasting studios. Laboratories and classes for these disciplines take place in both buildings. Both biology and chemistry laboratories are also located on the south campus. This building once contained a working nuclear reactor, which was decommissioned and stripped of its nuclear fuel and power generating capabilities in 1999.

In September 2021, the Leo Engineering Building was refurbished with a new 30,000 square foot building with 14 engineering and science labs. The new laboratory building is named the Higgins Engineering &amp; Science Center, thanks to a $5 million gift from Cornelius Higgins (Class of 1962) and his wife, Patricia.

There are currently four on-campus residence halls at Manhattan University. Jasper Hall and Chrysostom Hall are both traditional-style dorms, while Horan Hall and Lee Hall offer suite-style living and apartment-style living.

Draddy Gymnasium is the home of the basketball and volleyball teams, and also features the largest indoor track in New York City. Gaelic Park, on 240th Street, has recently been renovated with an artificial turf and is where soccer, lacrosse, and softball teams play. The institution also utilizes adjacent Van Cortlandt Park for outdoor track and field, golf, and cross country as well as intramural activities. Alumni Hall is the home of the institution&#x27;s workout facilities as well as the athletic administration.

The Broadway Garage is a five floor parking garage, approved in 2006 and completed soon afterward, located on Broadway. The garage offers parking to students and faculty, as well as visitors. The garage is also connected to Hayden hall via a pedestrian bridge that connects to one of Hayden&#x27;s top floors, allowing pedestrians to bypass crossing Manhattan College Parkway.

==Academics==

Manhattan University offers degrees in three undergraduate schools: the Kakos School of Arts and Sciences, the O&#x27;Malley School of Business, and the School of Engineering. Its most popular undergraduate majors, based on 2021 graduates, were:
::Civil Engineering (89)
::Mechanical Engineering (73)
::Marketing (47)
::Communication (44)
::Finance (38)
::Psychology (37)

Classes operate on a semester schedule. The first semester begins in late August and runs to December. The second semester begins in mid-January and runs to mid-May. Winter intersession and summer courses are also offered, but not required.

The institution offers a number of pre-professional programs such as pre-dental, pre-law, pre-medical, pre-physical therapy, and pre-veterinary; and graduate programs in mathematics, education, engineering and business. The graduate School of Engineering allows students studying engineering as an undergraduate the opportunity to continue on to get their master&#x27;s degree without having to switch institutions, as is the case at colleges with a 3 + 2 engineering program. The B.S. Business / Masters of Business Administration Program offers students an option to complete a five-year multiple award program. The successful completion of the five-year program leads to two awards: a B.S. in business (in one of six majors) and an MBA.

Manhattan University contains chapters of various honor societies as Phi Beta Kappa, Sigma Xi and Tau Beta Pi, Pi Mu Epsilon, a national mathematics honor society. A newly established chapter of Lambda Pi Eta communication honorary has also been added, as well as Kappa Alpha Omicron an interdisciplinary environmental science and studies honorary. Manhattan participates in the Consortium of Liberal Arts Colleges and in the New York Cluster of seven colleges and universities supported by the Pew Charitable Trusts for undergraduate science education.

===Rankings===
In 2019, Money magazine ranked Manhattan as the top &quot;transformative&quot; school in the nation in a study that took into account earnings and graduation rates to determine which schools help students succeed professionally. Manhattan was ranked 78th out of 1,879 schools in return on investment according to PayScale&#x27;s 2018 rankings. A 2015 Brookings Institution study ranked it as the ninth best school in the country when comparing expected versus actual mid-career earnings. &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked Manhattan 173rd out of the top 500 rated private and public colleges and universities in America for the 2024-25 report. Manhattan was also ranked 98th among private colleges and 70th in the northeast.

==Leadership==
Manhattan University is led by a president. The current interim president is Frederick Bonato.
==Athletics==

Manhattan University fields 19 Division–I athletic teams for men and women, including basketball, golf, soccer, baseball and softball, lacrosse, volleyball, and rowing. The school&#x27;s men&#x27;s sports teams are called the Jaspers; women&#x27;s teams are known as the Lady Jaspers. Historically track and field has been the school&#x27;s strongest sport. Manhattan is a member of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC).

In the modern era, basketball is the most popular sport at the institution. The current coach is John Gallagher who was named head coach in March 2023.

The Manhattan University Track and Field program is the richest athletic tradition at the institution, amassing a total of 31 out of a possible 32 MAAC Indoor/Outdoor Track titles. In 1973, Manhattan University won the Indoor NCAA Championship along with setting a new world record in the distance medley relay. Manhattan was also home to former American Record holder in the 5,000m Matthew Centrowitz Sr. The Program was run by legendary coach/runner Fred Dwyer who ran an astounding 4:00.8 mile while at his time at Villanova University. Manhattan still remains a power house on the east coast as one of the top programs around, under the direction of Dan Mecca.

The college annually played the New York Giants in the late 1880s and into the 1890s at the Polo Grounds and Manhattan is credited by the Baseball Hall of Fame with the practice of the &quot;seventh inning stretch&quot; spreading from there into major league baseball. It is written in the Baseball Hall of Fame that &quot;During one particularly warm and humid day when Manhattan College was playing a semi-pro baseball team called the Metropolitans, Brother Jasper noticed the Manhattan students were becoming restless and edgy as Manhattan came to bat in the seventh inning of a close game. To relieve the tension, Brother Jasper called time-out and told the students to stand up and stretch for a few minutes until the game resumed.&quot;

Luis Castro, a Manhattan University alumnus, was the first Latin American-born player to play in Major League Baseball in the United States.

Manhattan University had a football program from 1924 until 1942. The team posted an all-time record of 194 wins, 198 losses and 22 ties. The final coach for the football team was Herbert M. Kopf. After the 1942 season, the school suspended intercollegiate football competition for World War II and then did not reactivate the program after completion of the war. The team was invited to the first ever Miami Palm Festival Game, predecessor to the Orange Bowl, played on January 2, 1933, University of Miami defeated Manhattan University, 7–0. The team was revived in 1965 in the form of a club team, and existed until 1987.

Manhattan University&#x27;s rowing program holds much history, as well. It is one of the original 8 founding members of the Aberdeen Dad Vail Regatta, the largest collegiate regatta in the United States. The race attracts over one hundred colleges and universities from the U.S. and Canada and thousands of student-athletes on the second Saturday of May. The team&#x27;s coach, Allen Walz, along with the football coach at the time, Herbert M. Kopf, served as stewards to the regatta. In 1936 and 1938, Manhattan was one of two teams competing in the regatta, the other being Rutgers, on the Harlem River. Both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams still compete in the Dad Vail Regatta today, as well as in the MAAC Championships, N.Y. State Championships, and Knecht Cup. The women&#x27;s team became Division I in 2015, while the men&#x27;s team has remained at the club level. The women&#x27;s team currently trains out of Overpeck County Park under Head Coach Alex Canale while the men&#x27;s team has moved to Glen Island Park under Head Coach Kate Hickes. The women&#x27;s rowing team won the Fall Metropolitan Championship (hosted by Iona College) in the fall of 2018 and the Spring Metropolitan Championship in the spring of 2019, making it the first time in program history that the Jaspers have won either of those titles.

Manhattan&#x27;s men&#x27;s lacrosse program became Division I in 1997. They have qualified for the MAAC tournament 7 times (2000, 2002, 2004, 2005 and 2008–2010). In 2002, the Jaspers went undefeated in the MAAC (9–0) and won the MAAC Championship. They finished with an 11–6 record. The Jaspers earned a bid to the NCAA Playoffs in 2002, playing Georgetown. They fell to Georgetown 12–7 in the first round of the NCAAs. They have produced many ALL-MAAC players throughout the 15 years of the program.

The fencing team has been coached by former two-time Olympian Herb Cohen.

==Performing arts==
===Manhattan University Pipes &amp; Drums===
Manhattan University Pipes &amp; Drums was established in 1981 by Brother Kenneth Fitzgerald, FSC with the musical assistance of Captain Robert Hogan, of the New York City Police Department Emerald Society Pipes &amp; Drums. The band&#x27;s members are students, faculty, and alumni of the college.

The band marches in many local parades including the famed New York City Saint Patricks Day Parade.

===Pep Band===
Also known as the JasperBand, the Manhattan University Pep Band provides musical inspiration to get the Jasper crowds going at Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s basketball games. The Pep Band travels with teams to important away games to provide support away from home as well. In addition to performances at sporting events, the band also performs in concerts and events such as the MAAC Band Jam prior to the MAAC Basketball tournament. The band performs a variety of music from an expansive repertoire, ranging from &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot; by The White Stripes and &quot;You Can Call Me Al&quot; by Paul Simon, to modern day hits such as &quot;High Hopes&quot; by Panic! at the Disco and &quot;Mo Bamba&quot; by Sheck Wes. From 2016 to 2024, the band was directed by New York City drummer Jake Robinson.

===Ensembles===

Manhattan University has eight recognized performing arts groups. In addition to the aforementioned Manhattan University Pipes &amp; Drums and Pep Band, they have a Jazz Band, a choir called Singers, a theater club called Players, an improv troupe called Scatterbomb, an Orchestra and an a cappella group called Manhattones.

== Student newspaper ==
&quot;The Quadrangle&quot; (or &quot;The Quad&quot;) is the student newspaper of Manhattan University. &quot;The Quadrangle&quot; publishes weekly on Tuesdays during the academic year. It is editorially independent of the college&#x27;s administration. &quot;The Quadrangle&quot; has continually published since its founding in 1924, when Manhattan University moved to its current location in Riverdale. &quot;The Quadrangle&quot; is an official club of Manhattan University and is open to students of all academic fields of study.

==Transportation==
The institution is located between two major New York City highways, the Henry Hudson Parkway and the Major Deegan Expressway.

<doc id="1189274" wikidata="Q1359672" url="?curid=1189274" title="Evelyn Wood (British Army officer)">
<text>Field Marshal Sir Henry Evelyn Wood, , DL (9 February 1838 – 2 December 1919) was a British Army officer. After an early career in the Royal Navy, Wood joined the British Army in 1855. He served in several major conflicts including the Indian Mutiny where, as a lieutenant, he was awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest award for valour in the face of the enemy that is awarded to British and Imperial forces, for rescuing a local merchant from a band of robbers who had taken their captive into the jungle, where they intended to hang him. Wood further served as a commander in several other conflicts, notably the Third Anglo-Ashanti War, the Anglo-Zulu War, the First Boer War and the Mahdist War. His service in Egypt led to his appointment as Sirdar where he reorganised the Egyptian Army. He returned to Britain to serve as General Officer Commanding-in-Chief Aldershot Command from 1889, as Quartermaster-General to the Forces from 1893 and as Adjutant General from 1897. His last appointment was as commander of 2nd Army Corps (later renamed Southern Command) from 1901 to 1904.

==Ancestry and early life==
Wood was born at Cressing near Braintree, Essex as the fifth and youngest son of the Reverend Sir John Page Wood, 2nd Baronet (1796–1866), a clergyman, and Emma Caroline Michell, sister of Charles Collier Michell and Admiral Frederick Thomas Michell, and daughter of Admiral Sampson Michell. Wood was an elder brother of Katherine Parnell (Kitty O&#x27;Shea). Sir Matthew Wood, 1st Baronet, was his grandfather and Lord Chancellor William Wood, 1st Baron Hatherley was an uncle. His maternal grandfather (Sampson Mitchell) had been an admiral in the Portuguese navy. One of his mother&#x27;s brothers was a British admiral, another rose to be Surveyor-General of Cape Colony. Wood was educated at Marlborough Grammar School (1847–9) and Marlborough College (1849–52), but ran away after an unjust beating.

==Early military career==
===Crimean War: from sailor to soldier===

Like his near contemporary John French, Wood began his career in the Royal Navy, serving under his uncle Captain Frederick Mitchell on HMS &quot;Queen&quot;, but vertigo stopped him going aloft. He became a midshipman on 15 April 1852.

Wood served in the Crimean War during the siege of Sebastopol, in Captain William Peel&#x27;s 1,400 strong naval brigade, whose job was to man some guns on a ridge opposite Sebastopol. He was at Inkerman and aged 16, was Peel&#x27;s aide de camp in the assault on the Redan on 18 June 1855, having risen from his sickbed to join the attack. He was seriously wounded and almost lost his left arm, which doctors wanted to amputate. Wood was mentioned in despatches and received his first, but unsuccessful, recommendation for a VC.
Invalided home with a letter of recommendation from Lord Raglan, written five days before the latter&#x27;s death, Wood left the Royal Navy to join the British Army, becoming a cornet (without purchase) in the 13th Light Dragoons on 7 September 1855 and reporting to their depot with his arm still in a sling. He had only £250 () a year in private income, rather than the £400 () needed, and was soon in debt.

Wood returned to the Crimean Theatre (January 1856). His promotion to lieutenant, which his uncle had paid for, took effect on 1 February 1856. However, within a month he was in hospital at Scutari with pneumonia and typhoid. His parents were told he was dying, so his mother arrived on 20 March 1856 only to find one of Florence Nightingale&#x27;s nurses striking him. He was so emaciated that his hip bones were poking through his skin. Against medical advice he was brought home to England to recover.

===Indian Mutiny===
Wood served in Ireland then transferred as a lieutenant to the 17th Lancers on 9 October 1857. His transfer was to gain passage to India; he had considered joining the French Foreign Legion. He reached Bombay on 21 December 1858. While out hunting he was attacked by a wounded tiger – it was shot in the nick of time by a hunting companion; – he also rode a giraffe belonging to a friendly Indian prince to win a bet with a brother officer – he stayed on long enough to win the bet, but was trampled badly, the animal&#x27;s rear hoof breaking through both cheeks, crushing his nose.

In India, Wood saw action at Rajghur, Sindwaho, Kharee, and Barode during the Indian Mutiny. From May 1858 to October 1859 he was brigade major to a flying column in Central India. On 19 October 1858 during an action at Sindwaho while in command of a troop of light cavalry, twenty-year-old Lieutenant Wood attacked a body of rebels, whom he routed almost single-handedly. Wood also saw action at Kurai (25 October 1859). At Sindhora, on 29 December 1858, Wood&#x27;s force of 10 men routed 80 men. With the help of a &quot;daffadar&quot; and a &quot;sowar&quot; of Beatson&#x27;s Horse, he rescued a local Potail (headman of a village) from a band of robbers who had taken their captive into the jungle, where they had intended to hang him. For these two acts of selfless bravery, Wood was awarded the Victoria Cross.

His citation read:
He became temporarily deaf for a week while studying Hindustani at Poona, which he attributed at the time to overwork. In December 1859 he joined the 2nd Central India Horse, whose main function was the suppression of banditry. In this role he had to deal with an incipient mutiny and sort out the regimental accounts. He was invalided back to Britain in November 1860 with fever, sunstroke and ear problems.

=== Staff College ===
On 16 April 1861, Wood was promoted to captain. His captaincy cost him £1,000 official payment to the government and £1,500 &quot;over regulation&quot; to buy out his predecessor. He was promoted again this time to brevet major (for services in India) on 19 August 1862.

Wood passed the exam to enter the new Staff College, Camberley, but another officer from 17th Lancers had higher marks and as at that time only one officer was permitted from each regiment each year, Wood had to transfer as a captain to the 73rd (Perthshire) Regiment of Foot on 21 October 1862. He took up his place in January 1863, and graduated in 1864. While at Staff College he took part in boxing lessons.

In Dublin, from January 1865 to March 1866 he was aide-de-camp to General William Napier, whom he knew from India; the damp climate brought on a recurrence of fever and ear trouble. In the autumn of 1865 the 73rd were ordered to Hong Kong, but Wood disliked the new commanding officer so much that he paid £500 to transfer into the 17th (Leicestershire) Regiment of Foot.

From July 1866 to November 1871 he was at North Camp at Aldershot, first as brigade major then as Deputy Assistant Quartermaster-General. Having just written to propose to his future wife, he read in 1867 that &quot;General Napier&quot; was to lead an expedition to Abyssinia; he packed his bags and went to London to volunteer, but then learnt that this was not to be William Napier, but General Robert Napier, whom he did not know and who was unlikely to grant him a staff position. With a young family to support but not hopeful of getting a staff position, Wood also studied law, enrolling at the Middle Temple on 30 April 1870.

On 22 June 1870 Wood was given an unattached majority. In the summer of 1871 he paid £2,000 () to purchase a permanent majority in the 90th Light Infantry, effective 28 October 1871 and one of the last such transactions before the purchase of commissions system was abolished.

Nursing his children through diphtheria (he had sent his pregnant wife away), he was prescribed morphine for insomnia and nearly died of an overdose. Wood was promoted to brevet lieutenant colonel on 19 June 1873 on the basis of seniority from the purchase of his majority.

==Imperial wars==
===Third Ashanti War===
In May 1873, with the Third Anglo-Ashanti War brewing, he met Wolseley by chance in the War Office and joked that his naval experience might come in handy for West African waterways. On 12 September 1873 he was appointed to Wolseley&#x27;s staff for special services. He commanded a flank at the Battle of Amoaful (31 January 1874) where he was wounded. and at the Battle of Esaman. He helped recruit a regiment from among the coastal African tribes, although he wrote of the Fantis that &quot;it would be difficult to imagine a more cowardly, useless lot of men&quot;. He did, however, discourage British officers from using physical abuse on them.

He was wounded just above the heart, confining him to a stretcher for a day. Relying on chlorodyne and laudanum to keep going, he was ordered to lead the sick and wounded back to the coast. It was erroneously reported in the London press that he had been captured and probably flayed alive. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) on 31 March 1874.

Wood presented two African chieftains with a walking stick, a hat and an umbrella. Twenty-two years later, later his eldest son was also in Ashanti. While there, he saw a native carrying a stick which the man would not sell, saying it belonged to his chief. On closer inspection, Wood Junior read an inscription; &#x27;Presented to Chief Andoo by Colonel Evelyn Wood, 1874.&#x27; He was promoted in permanent rank from major and brevet lieutenant-colonel to brevet colonel on 1 April 1874. A man of relatively modest means for much of his life, Wood took his profession very seriously – like many who had served under Garnet Wolseley in the Ashanti War he was a member of the reforming &quot;Wolseley ring&quot;, although the two men were never on particularly good terms.

Wood completed his legal studies and was called to the Bar at the Middle Temple on 30 April 1874. In June 1874 he lectured about the Ashanti War at the Royal United Services Institute. From September 1874 to February 1878 he was at Aldershot, first as Superintendent of Garrison Instruction, then as Assistant Quartermaster-General. In 1877 he declined command of Staff College, recommending George Colley, who also declined.

===Zulu War===
Wood was on the staff of Lieutenant-General Thesiger (who later became Lord Chelmsford), who was then in command of a column in Natal in the Xhosa Wars (also known as the Cape Frontier Wars). He was employed as a field officer of the 90th Light Infantry, which had arrived in South Africa in January 1878, in the last battle of the wars at Tutu Bush (May 1878). On 13 November he was promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant-colonel, and on the same day he was appointed commanding officer of the 90th Light.

In January 1879, Wood took part in the Anglo-Zulu War and was given command of the 3,000-strong 4th column on the left flank of the army when they crossed the Zulu frontier. Defeat of other British forces at Isandlwana (22 January) would force Wood to retreat to fortified positions at Kambula. The right-wing column was besieged by the Zulus at Eshowe, leaving Wood&#x27;s the only free column. Wood and Redvers Buller harassed the Zulus of the local Qulusi Clan, so the main Zulu army was diverted to fight them. Wood was defeated at Hlobane on 28 March 1879, where he had his horse shot from under him and his close friend and chief staff officer Ronald Campbell was killed. He recovered and the following day decisively beat the Zulus at Kambula (29 March 1879). He was promoted to the local rank of brigadier-general on 3 April. Wood&#x27;s victory was the turning point of the war, and in May 1879, during the second invasion of Zululand, his force linked with the 2nd Division for a push on Ulundi.

At the end of the war, Wood headed the negotiations which took place on Conference Hill. The Zulus squatted round the negotiating tent in a large crescent. According to one witness, they were &#x27;apathetic&#x27;. The tension rose when Wood emerged from the tent and ordered his band to play &#x27;God Save the Queen&#x27;. The accompanying soldiers gave good cheer; the bandmaster was then told to play something lively. Being Irish, the master &#x27;treated them to &#x27;Patrick&#x27;s Day in the Morning&#x27;. The effect was magical; one after another, the Zulus rose and, swaying and dancing, swarmed around the British soldiers on their horses. Of particular interest to the Zulus was the bass drummer whom they seemed to greatly admire. Their negotiations were successful. Wood and Buller both chose to return to England rather than join Wolseley in the final pursuit of the Zulu King Cetewayo. Reverting to his permanent rank of brevet colonel, Wood was also advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) on 23 June 1879.

He visited Balmoral Castle in September 1879, and in subsequent years wrote the Queen letters described by Ian Beckett as &quot;extraordinarily sycophantic&quot;. He was already very deaf and hardly stopped talking; the Queen herself recorded that she &quot;hollered at him&quot;, while in the field an officer had to accompany him at night as he might not hear a sentry&#x27;s challenge; his deafness came partly from his various fevers. He was also a hypochondriac, and very vain – he is said to have had his medal ribbons bordered in black so that they would be more visible.

Wood was paid £100 for a series of London newspaper articles, his first published work. He was disappointed not to be made a major-general, despite lobbying by the Queen and Wolseley. This may well have been deliberate blocking of Wolseley&#x27;s proteges from promotion by the Duke of Cambridge. Wood recommended Redvers Buller for his VC after the Zulu War. On 15 December 1879 Wood took up a brigade command at Belfast, and in that role was again given the local rank of brigadier-general, this time on the staff in Ireland in December 1879.

===First Boer War===
On 12 January 1880 Wood was posted to command the Chatham Garrison, roughly equivalent to a brigade, holding that post until early 1881. He was again ranked from January 1880 as a local brigadier-general.

Wood&#x27;s brother stood for Parliament as an &quot;advanced&quot; Liberal in April 1880, but he himself declined approaches to do so at least twice. Between March and July 1880 Wood and his wife were obliged by the Queen to escort the former Empress Eugenie to see the spot where her son, the Prince Imperial, had been killed while fighting with the British Army in the Zulu War, calling at St Helena (where Napoleon I had died) on the way back. To his annoyance he received no pay whatsoever for this mission, despite it being official business at the Queen&#x27;s request. In October 1880 Wolseley complained of the noise, poor food and filth of Wood&#x27;s home.

With the First Boer War reaching a crescendo, he was once again sent back to South Africa in January 1881, initially as a &quot;staff colonel&quot; to Sir George Colley, Governor and Commander-in-Chief in Natal, who was his junior on the Army list. He was then, again with the local rank of brigadier-general, appointed second-in-command, pushing reinforcements up to Colley. He succeeded Colley after his defeat and death at Majuba Hill (27 February 1881), earning promotion to the local rank of major-general.

In mid-March Wood reopened the offensive. He intended to relieve the towns under siege, but was ordered by William Gladstone&#x27;s Cabinet to make peace. Wood wrote to his wife that the treaty would make him &quot;the best abused man in England for a time&quot; but thought it his duty to obey the government&#x27;s orders. Wolseley (who thought the treaty &quot;infamous&quot; and &quot;ignominious&quot;) and other officers thought he should have resigned his commission rather than sign it. Wolseley never forgave him for not avenging Colley, and he was criticised by Colley&#x27;s biographer William Butler. He had to travel to Pretoria, and was injured on the way when the horses of his carriage bolted. He negotiated peace on 21 March 1881. He was offered but declined, the Governorship of Natal. In April 1881 he was appointed to a commission of inquiry into all matters relating to the future settlement of the Transvaal Territory, and put in a dissenting opinion about the boundaries.

Although the peace negotiations were an embarrassing reverse for Britain, they brought Wood further political and royal favour. The Queen thought highly of him (and Buller). Wood&#x27;s third daughter, born in 1881, was named &quot;Victoria Eugenie&quot; at the Queen&#x27;s wish. Wood had already impressed Lord Beaconsfield (Prime Minister at the time), who had met him at the Queen&#x27;s suggestion after the Zulu War, and now impressed Gladstone, the current Prime Minister. He was promoted in permanent rank from lieutenant-colonel (unemployed) and brevet colonel to major-general (30 November 1881) and was awarded a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG) on 17 February 1882. He returned to England and to the Chatham command in February 1882.

===Egypt and Sudan===
In August 1882 Wood commanded the 4th Brigade on the Egyptian expedition to suppress the Urabi Revolt. Wolseley kept him on occupation duties in Alexandria, so he missed the Battle of Tel el-Kebir. He returned to Chatham for a while again in November 1882 then returned to be Sirdar (commander) of the Egyptian Army from 21 December 1882 until 1885, during which period he thoroughly reorganised it, with Francis Grenfell and Kitchener working under him. He had 25 British officers (who were given extra pay and Egyptian ranks a grade or two higher than their British ones) and a few NCOs, although to Wood&#x27;s annoyance Lt-Gen Stephenson, commander of the British occupation forces, was confirmed as his senior in June 1884. During the cholera epidemic of 1883, British officers earned the respect of Egyptian soldiers by nursing them. Wood gave Sundays off from drill as well as Fridays (the Muslim holy day), so that Egyptian soldiers would see that their British officers took their own religion seriously.

Wood hoped to command the Gordon Relief Expedition (see Mahdist War), but Wolseley was given the job instead in September 1884 and sidelined him to command of the lines of communication. Wood also fell out with Earle, the commander of the river column. He commanded the British at the Battle of Ginnis in December 1885. He was the only officer to be given an important command despite advising against Wolseley&#x27;s choice of the Nile route. Wood briefly took Redvers Buller&#x27;s place as chief of staff as Buller had to take charge of the desert column after Stewart was mortally wounded at Abu Klea. In this job Wood became unpopular for employing female nurses (against the advice of army doctors at that time) and quarrelled with his friend Buller when Wood recommended a more cautious advance which would give time to build up supply depots. He was disorganised, stuffing telegrams into his pocket, to Wolseley&#x27;s annoyance. In March 1885 Buller became chief of staff again.

By this stage Wood was so deaf that Wolseley complained he had become hoarse from shouting at him. Wolseley wrote of Wood that &quot;he has done worse than I expected&quot; and in his journal described him as &quot;the vainest but by no means the ablest of men. He is as cunning as a first class female diplomatist … (but has not) real sound judgement…… intrigues with newspaper correspondents … he has not the brains nor the disposition nor the coolness nor the firmness of purpose to enable him to take command in any war … a very second rate general … whose two most remarkable traits (a)re extreme vanity &amp; unbounded self-seeking&quot; although a letter to his wife (complaining that Wood was &quot;a very puzzle-headed fellow&quot;, wanting in method and vain) suggests that Wolseley still bore Wood a grudge about the peace after Majuba Hill. Ill once again, Wood handed over the job of Sirdar to Francis Grenfell. To his annoyance, he received no (British) honours from the Nile expedition. Wood returned to the UK in June 1885.

==Home commands==
===Aldershot===

In 1886 Wood returned to Britain to take charge of Eastern Command at Colchester, effective 1 April 1886. In November 1888 the Duke of Cambridge (Commander-in-Chief of the Forces) opposed his mooted appointment as General Officer Commanding of Aldershot Command, one of the most important posts in the army at home, as the Woods were &quot;a very rough couple&quot;. Despite the Duke&#x27;s opposition, he was appointed GOC Aldershot on 1 January 1889. He was promoted to local lieutenant-general, as he was only tenth on the list of major-generals. He was promoted to permanent lieutenant-general (1 April 1890) and advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) on 30 May 1891. He would remain at Aldershot until 8 October 1893.

At Aldershot Wood supported the implementation of the Wantage Commission reforms to soldiers&#x27; conditions. He was concerned with the well-being of both troops and animals, recommending the rebuilding of barracks and training of army cooks. He arranged for sick men&#x27;s food to be prepared in hospitals rather than brought in tins from their own units. He experimented with training soldiers on bicycles, night marches (in the teeth of opposition, particularly from the Duke of Cambridge, who thought it might interfere with horses&#x27; rest) and negotiated with the railway companies for cheap rail tickets for soldiers going on leave. He also carried out extensive training manoeuvres for the regulars under his command and for Militia and Volunteer forces. He made contributions to a Baptist chapel for a time, and ensured that Baptist services were as well publicised as those of other denominations. With the help of some high-ranking Roman Catholic friends, he agreed on an ecumenical service for Irish regiments which was acceptable both to Roman Catholic soldiers and their Anglican officers and chaplains. He promoted the concept of mounted infantry and conducted training in cavalry marksmanship. In early 1892 an early cinema film was made to illustrate the life of a soldier.

While Wood was at Aldershot his aides-de-camp included Captain Edward Roderic &#x27;Roddy&#x27; Owen (Lancashire Fusiliers), a famous amateur jockey, which his biographer has identified as due to Wood&#x27;s keen interest as rider and foxhunter, and Major Hew Dalrymple Fanshawe, 19th Hussars. Fanshawe (who commanded V Corps during World War I), later became Wood&#x27;s son-in-law, marrying his elder daughter Anna Pauline Mary on 25 July 1894.

In 1892 Wood was considered for the position of Commander-in-Chief, India, a move which the Queen favoured, while the Duke of Cambridge wanted him to become commander-in-chief at Madras so that the Queen&#x27;s son the Duke of Connaught (himself a former commander-in-chief at Bombay, a few years earlier) could replace him at Aldershot. Henry Brackenbury, a senior military adviser to the Viceroy of India, thought Wood better suited to remain at Aldershot. Wood became Prime Warden of the Fishmongers&#x27; Company in 1893.

===Administering the Army===

Wood handed over his command at Aldershot to the Duke of Connaught and saw staff service at the War Office as Quartermaster-General to the Forces at the War Office from 9 October 1893. There he negotiated new contracts with shipping and railway companies. He was promoted to full general on 26 March 1895. He remained Quartermaster-General until 1897. His duties in the 1890s were similar to those of a Chief of the General Staff, had such a job then existed.

On 1 October 1897 Wood succeeded Buller as Adjutant-General to the Forces at the War Office. Wolseley had succeeded Cambridge as Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in 1895, but his powers were being steadily reduced as his health was failing and he did not get on with Lord Lansdowne (Secretary of State for War), putting the Adjutant-General in a more powerful position. Wolseley accepted the appointment, despite his dislike of Wood, but the two men had very little interaction.
Wood also served as Deputy Lieutenant of Essex from 10 August 1897 and was granted the freedom of the Borough of Chelmsford in 1903. He was also the responsible colonel of the 5th Battalion, the Essex Regiment. Wood wrote several books at this time by writing each day for an hour before daybreak – in 1895 he published a book on the Crimean War, in 1896 a book on Cavalry at Waterloo, and in 1897 &quot;Achievements of Cavalry&quot;.

He was a patron of Captain Douglas Haig, who had attracted his attention by reporting on French cavalry manoeuvres in the early 1890s, although they did not actually meet face-to-face until an 1895 staff ride where Haig was serving as an aide to Colonel John French. Haig wrote that Wood was &quot;a capital fellow to have upon one’s side as he always gets his own way&quot;. He arranged Haig&#x27;s posting to the 1898 Sudan War – with orders to write privately to him reporting on Kitchener, the general officer commanding, and on his expedition&#x27;s progress. Wood, who had experience of commanding both infantry and cavalry, supported the concept of mounted infantry and proposed that each infantry battalion should have one mounted company. The concept of mounted infantry fell back into disfavour in the Edwardian period as French and Haig, pure cavalrymen, rose to the top of the Army. In 1898 Wood also acknowledged the abilities of Sir Charles Dilke, who had returned to Parliament after his divorce scandal of the 1880s and who hoped (in vain, as it turned out) one day to be Secretary of State for War: &quot;You cannot think&quot;, remarked Wood, &quot;how grateful I am to anyone who takes an intelligent interest in the Army.&quot;

Wolseley informed him that his role in the 1881 Peace made it impossible for him to be given a field command in the Second Boer War, despite his offer to serve under Buller, his junior. Nonetheless, he was disappointed when Roberts was appointed commander-in-chief rather than himself. His three sons also served in the war. During the campaign, Evelyn Wood became ill from War Office work. Wood had little say over appointments during the Boer War. In November 1900 Wood was acting Commander-in-Chief of the Forces while Lord Roberts returned from South Africa to replace Wolseley. Wood testified to the Royal Commission and gave information, much of it critical of Wolseley, to Leopold Amery for his &quot;Times History of the War in South Africa&quot;.

Wood continued as Adjutant-General until 1901 and was then appointed to command the II Army Corps and Southern Command 1 October 1901, holding the positions until 1904. On 8 April 1903, he was promoted field marshal. He retired on 31 December 1904.

==Personal life==
===Family===
Wood&#x27;s mother was left short of money after 1866 when her husband died and, already 66 years old, she went on to write fourteen novels, translating Victor Hugo&#x27;s &quot;L’Homme qui Rit&quot; into English. His sister Anna was also a novelist under her married name Steele – one of her novels featured a henpecked VC who was probably based on her brother. Anna left her husband Colonel Steele on her wedding night – apparently still a virgin – when she discovered that he expected to have sex with her. Evelyn was once sued for assault after striking Colonel Steele in one of the latter&#x27;s many attempts to &quot;reclaim&quot; his wife. Anna Steele was very close to her brother and allegedly helped to write his speeches.

During the Indian Mutiny another sister, Maria Chambers, conveyed her children to safety through mutineer-controlled country carrying a phial of poison for each child.

===Marriage and children===
In 1867 Wood married the Hon. Mary Paulina Anne Southwell, a sister of Thomas Southwell, 4th Viscount Southwell, a friend from India. Southwell opposed the marriage as the Southwell family were Roman Catholic and Wood, although not a man of particularly strong religious views, refused to leave the Church of England. Having barely seen Paulina for four years, he proposed by letter in 1867 on the understanding that she would never &quot;by a word or even by a look&quot; try to prevent him from volunteering for war service. His marriage hurt his career, as neither Wolseley nor the Duke of Cambridge were impressed by his home life. They had three sons and three daughters but she died on 11 May 1891, while Wood was commanding at Aldershot. After his wife&#x27;s death Wood was deeply touched to receive 46 letters of condolence from NCOs and private soldiers who had served under him.

===Hunting===
Wood hunted an average 46 days out of his 60 days leave each year, almost up until his death. He was convinced that hunting was of great value in training officers by encouraging horsemanship and developing an eye for terrain and for rapid decision-making in dangerous situations. He was often injured, on one occasion while at Staff College falling on the crown of his head so badly that his neck swelled as if he were suffering from a large double goitre. During the Second Boer War he was injured in the chest when he fell against a crucifix, worn under his shirt, which had belonged to his late wife.

===Parnell divorce scandal===
The Wood family were financially dependent on their wealthy, eccentric &#x27;Aunt Ben&#x27;, the widow of Benjamin Wood. She gave each sibling £5,000 but Evelyn received nothing since he had married a Catholic. She later paid him an allowance for a time. His brother-in-law later paid him enough of a salary to keep horses, grooms, hounds and servants, supposedly for supervising estates in Ireland, although it is unclear that he ever devoted much time to this task. Wood had to appeal to Aunt Ben for cash after the First Boer War.

Wood and his siblings, Charles and Anna, demanded equal shares of Aunt Ben&#x27;s inheritance, but in March 1888 she made a new will, leaving everything (£150,000 plus lands, ) in a trust for the sole benefit of her favourite niece, Wood&#x27;s sister Katherine, better known as Kitty O&#x27;Shea. The other siblings tried to have Aunt Ben declared insane, a petition dismissed after she was examined by the eminent physician Sir Andrew Clark. When Aunt Ben died in May 1889, the siblings alleged undue influence by Kitty. Her husband, Captain William O&#x27;Shea (18th Hussars), an Irish MP, at this point also contested the will, claiming it contravened his marriage contract and also sued for divorce. Kitty was the lover of the Irish nationalist politician Charles Stewart Parnell, the ensuing public scandal helped to destroy his career and any chance of Irish Home Rule. It is unclear whether the siblings had encouraged O’Shea in his divorce to blacken Kitty&#x27;s name. It was suggested that Wood&#x27;s sister Anna Steele was herself a former lover of William O’Shea – when the will was overturned Anna used her share to live as a recluse, keeping a pet monkey to which she fed anchovy sandwiches. Sir Evelyn probably received about £20,000 () in the eventual settlement.

==Final years==

After retiring from active service in December 1904, Wood lived at Upminster in Essex His autobiography appeared in 1906.

Wood became colonel of the Royal Horse Guards in November 1907, making him one of the most senior officers at Horse Guards during a period of fundamental restructuring and reorganization, and a Gold Stick. He became chairman of the Territorial Force Association for the City of London at the start of 1908. As a qualified barrister since 1874, he had become Honorary Colonel of the 14th Middlesex (Inns of Court) Rifle Volunteer Corps in November 1899 and supported its incorporation as an officer training unit in the new Territorial Force in 1908. On 11 March 1911 he was appointed Constable of the Tower of London. He was a governor of Gresham&#x27;s School from 1899 to 1919.

On 17 June 1913 a year before the outbreak of war, King George V reviewed the Household Cavalry in Windsor Great Park. &quot;With a bevy of princes and famous soldiers&quot; accompanying the King, he inspected &quot;a blue body [the Blues in the centre] with red wings flecked with gold [Life Guards on either flank] and lit up by the twinkling of the sun on many breastplates...[Sir Evelyn Wood, leading the Blues, had] paid unusual attention to his personal appearance.&quot; Beginning as a courageous young officer and later a successful commander in colonial wars, Evelyn Wood understood the importance of progress and modern technology and lived long enough to see cavalry become almost obsolete. Unlike the brigade commander he was proud to see his regiment operating new weapons: &quot;You can picture my pleasant thoughts when I contrast the spirit of the BLUES turning up to the duties of Machine Gunners, and the false swagger of the men... in a Light Dragoon Regiment&quot; he wrote.

In January 1914 he resigned as Chairman of the County Territorial Association in order to express his support for Field Marshal Roberts&#x27; campaign for conscription.

In his final years he wrote &quot;Our Fighting Services&quot; (1916) and &quot;Winnowed Memories&quot; (1917) which one historian described as &quot;stuffed with adulatory letters he had received, extracts of speeches he had given and anecdotes in which his wisdom or cleverness figured&quot;.

Wood died of heart failure in 1919 at the age of 81. His body was buried with full military honours at the Aldershot Military Cemetery in the county of Hampshire. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the National Army Museum in Chelsea, London. A public house known as the &quot;Sir Evelyn Wood&quot; is located in Widford Road in Chelmsford.

His will was valued for probate at £11,196 4s 10d. ().

<text>The seabed (also known as the seafloor, sea floor, ocean floor, and ocean bottom) is the bottom of the ocean. All floors of the ocean are known as &#x27;seabeds&#x27;.

The structure of the seabed of the global ocean is governed by plate tectonics. Most of the ocean is very deep, where the seabed is known as the abyssal plain. Seafloor spreading creates mid-ocean ridges along the center line of major ocean basins, where the seabed is slightly shallower than the surrounding abyssal plain. From the abyssal plain, the seabed slopes upward toward the continents and becomes, in order from deep to shallow, the continental rise, slope, and shelf. The depth within the seabed itself, such as the depth down through a sediment core, is known as the &quot;depth below seafloor&quot;. The ecological environment of the seabed and the deepest waters are collectively known, as a habitat for creatures, as the &quot;benthos&quot;.

Most of the seabed throughout the world&#x27;s oceans is covered in layers of marine sediments. Categorized by where the materials come from or composition, these sediments are classified as either: from land (terrigenous), from biological organisms (biogenous), from chemical reactions (hydrogenous), and from space (cosmogenous). Categorized by size, these sediments range from very small particles called clays and silts, known as mud, to larger particles from sand to boulders.

Features of the seabed are governed by the physics of sediment transport and by the biology of the creatures living in the seabed and in the ocean waters above. Physically, seabed sediments often come from the erosion of material on land and from other rarer sources, such as volcanic ash. Sea currents transport sediments, especially in shallow waters where tidal energy and wave energy cause resuspension of seabed sediments. Biologically, microorganisms living within the seabed sediments change seabed chemistry. Marine organisms create sediments, both within the seabed and in the water above. For example, phytoplankton with silicate or calcium carbonate shells grow in abundance in the upper ocean, and when they die, their shells sink to the seafloor to become seabed sediments.

Human impacts on the seabed are diverse. Examples of human effects on the seabed include exploration, plastic pollution, and exploitation by mining and dredging operations. To map the seabed, ships use acoustic technology to map water depths throughout the world. Submersible vehicles help researchers study unique seabed ecosystems such as hydrothermal vents. Plastic pollution is a global phenomenon, and because the ocean is the ultimate destination for global waterways, much of the world&#x27;s plastic ends up in the ocean and some sinks to the seabed. Exploitation of the seabed involves extracting valuable minerals from sulfide deposits via deep sea mining, as well as dredging sand from shallow environments for construction and beach nourishment.

== Structure ==

Most of the oceans have a common structure, created by common physical phenomena, mainly from tectonic movement, and sediment from various sources. The structure of the oceans, starting with the continents, begins usually with a continental shelf, continues to the continental slope – which is a steep descent into the ocean, until reaching the abyssal plain – a topographic plain, the beginning of the seabed, and its main area. The border between the continental slope and the abyssal plain usually has a more gradual descent, and is called the continental rise, which is caused by sediment cascading down the continental slope.

The mid-ocean ridge, as its name implies, is a mountainous rise through the middle of all the oceans, between the continents. Typically a rift runs along the edge of this ridge. Along tectonic plate edges there are typically oceanic trenches – deep valleys, created by the mantle circulation movement from the mid-ocean mountain ridge to the oceanic trench.

Hotspot volcanic island ridges are created by volcanic activity, erupting periodically, as the tectonic plates pass over a hotspot. In areas with volcanic activity and in the oceanic trenches there are hydrothermal vents – releasing high pressure and extremely hot water and chemicals into the typically freezing water around it.

Deep ocean water is divided into layers or zones, each with typical features of salinity, pressure, temperature and marine life, according to their depth. Lying along the top of the abyssal plain is the abyssal zone, whose lower boundary lies at about 6,000 m (20,000 ft). The hadal zone – which includes the oceanic trenches, lies between 6,000 and 11,000 metres (20,000–36,000 ft) and is the deepest oceanic zone.

=== Depth below seafloor ===
Depth below seafloor is a vertical coordinate used in geology, paleontology, oceanography, and petrology (see ocean drilling).
The acronym &quot;mbsf&quot; (meaning &quot;meters below the seafloor&quot;) is a common convention used for depths below the seafloor.

== Sediments ==


Sediments in the seabed vary in origin, from eroded land materials carried into the ocean by rivers or wind flow, waste and decompositions of sea creatures, and precipitation of chemicals within the sea water itself, including some from outer space. There are four basic types of sediment of the sea floor:
# &quot;Terrigenous&quot; (also &quot;lithogenous&quot;) describes the sediment from continents eroded by rain, rivers, and glaciers, as well as sediment blown into the ocean by the wind, such as dust and volcanic ash.
# &quot;Biogenous&quot; material is the sediment made up of the hard parts of sea creatures, mainly phytoplankton, that accumulate on the bottom of the ocean.
# &quot;Hydrogenous&quot; sediment is material that precipitates in the ocean when oceanic conditions change, or material created in hydrothermal vent systems.
# &quot;Cosmogenous&quot; sediment comes from extraterrestrial sources.

=== Terrigenous and biogenous ===
Terrigenous sediment is the most abundant sediment found on the seafloor. Terrigenous sediments come from the continents. These materials are eroded from continents and transported by wind and water to the ocean. Fluvial sediments are transported from land by rivers and glaciers, such as clay, silt, mud, and glacial flour. Aeolian sediments are transported by wind, such as dust and volcanic ash.

Biogenous sediment is the next most abundant material on the seafloor. Biogenous sediments are biologically produced by living creatures. Sediments made up of at least 30% biogenous material are called &quot;oozes.&quot; There are two types of oozes: Calcareous oozes and Siliceous oozes. Plankton grow in ocean waters and create the materials that become oozes on the seabed. Calcareous oozes are predominantly composed of calcium shells found in phytoplankton such as coccolithophores and zooplankton like the foraminiferans. These calcareous oozes are never found deeper than about 4,000 to 5,000 meters because at further depths the calcium dissolves. Similarly, Siliceous oozes are dominated by the siliceous shells of phytoplankton like diatoms and zooplankton such as radiolarians. Depending on the productivity of these planktonic organisms, the shell material that collects when these organisms die may build up at a rate anywhere from 1 mm to 1 cm every 1000 years.

=== Hydrogenous and cosmogenous ===

Hydrogenous sediments are uncommon. They only occur with changes in oceanic conditions such as temperature and pressure. Rarer still are cosmogenous sediments. Hydrogenous sediments are formed from dissolved chemicals that precipitate from the ocean water, or along the mid-ocean ridges, they can form by metallic elements binding onto rocks that have water of more than 300 °C circulating around them. When these elements mix with the cold sea water they precipitate from the cooling water. Known as manganese nodules, they are composed of layers of different metals like manganese, iron, nickel, cobalt, and copper, and they are always found on the surface of the ocean floor.

Cosmogenous sediments are the remains of space debris such as comets and asteroids, made up of silicates and various metals that have impacted the Earth.

=== Size classification ===

Another way that sediments are described is through their descriptive classification. These sediments vary in size, anywhere from 1/4096 of a mm to greater than 256 mm. The different types are: boulder, cobble, pebble, granule, sand, silt, and clay, each type becoming finer in grain. The grain size indicates the type of sediment and the environment in which it was created. Larger grains sink faster and can only be pushed by rapid flowing water (high energy environment) whereas small grains sink very slowly and can be suspended by slight water movement, accumulating in conditions where water is not moving so quickly. This means that larger grains of sediment may come together in higher energy conditions and smaller grains in lower energy conditions.

== Benthos ==
== Topography ==

Seabed topography (ocean topography or marine topography) refers to the shape of the land (topography) when it interfaces with the ocean. These shapes are obvious along coastlines, but they occur also in significant ways underwater. The effectiveness of marine habitats is partially defined by these shapes, including the way they interact with and shape ocean currents, and the way sunlight diminishes when these landforms occupy increasing depths. Tidal networks depend on the balance between sedimentary processes and hydrodynamics however, anthropogenic influences can impact the natural system more than any physical driver.

Marine topographies include coastal and oceanic landforms ranging from coastal estuaries and shorelines to continental shelves and coral reefs. Further out in the open ocean, they include underwater and deep sea features such as ocean rises and seamounts. The submerged surface has mountainous features, including a globe-spanning mid-ocean ridge system, as well as undersea volcanoes, oceanic trenches, submarine canyons, oceanic plateaus and abyssal plains.

The mass of the oceans is approximately 1.35 metric tons, or about 1/4400 of the total mass of the Earth. The oceans cover an area of 3.618 km2 with a mean depth of 3,682 m, resulting in an estimated volume of 1.332 km3.

== Features ==
Each region of the seabed has typical features such as common sediment composition, typical topography, salinity of water layers above it, marine life, magnetic direction of rocks, and sedimentation. Some features of the seabed include flat abyssal plains, mid-ocean ridges, deep trenches, and hydrothermal vents.

Seabed topography is flat where layers of sediments cover the tectonic features. For example, the abyssal plain regions of the ocean are relatively flat and covered in many layers of sediments. Sediments in these flat areas come from various sources, including but not limited to: land erosion sediments from rivers, chemically precipitated sediments from hydrothermal vents, Microorganism activity, sea currents eroding the seabed and transporting sediments to the deeper ocean, and phytoplankton shell materials.

Where the seafloor is actively spreading and sedimentation is relatively light, such as in the northern and eastern Atlantic Ocean, the original tectonic activity can be clearly seen as straight line &quot;cracks&quot; or &quot;vents&quot; thousands of kilometers long. These underwater mountain ranges are known as mid-ocean ridges.

Other seabed environments include hydrothermal vents, cold seeps, and shallow areas. Marine life is abundant in the deep sea around hydrothermal vents. Large deep sea communities of marine life have been discovered around black and white smokers – vents emitting chemicals toxic to humans and most vertebrates. This marine life receives its energy both from the extreme temperature difference (typically a drop of 150 degrees) and from chemosynthesis by bacteria. Brine pools are another seabed feature, usually connected to cold seeps. In shallow areas, the seabed can host sediments created by marine life such as corals, fish, algae, crabs, marine plants and other organisms.

== Human impact ==
=== Exploration ===

The seabed has been explored by submersibles such as &quot;Alvin&quot; and, to some extent, scuba divers with special equipment. Hydrothermal vents were discovered in 1977 by researchers using an underwater camera platform. In recent years satellite measurements of ocean surface topography show very clear maps of the seabed, and these satellite-derived maps are used extensively in the study and exploration of the ocean floor.

=== Plastic pollution ===
In 2020 scientists created what may be the first scientific estimate of how much microplastic currently resides in Earth&#x27;s seafloor, after investigating six areas of ~3 km depth ~300 km off the Australian coast. They found the highly variable microplastic counts to be proportionate to plastic on the surface and the angle of the seafloor slope. By averaging the microplastic mass per cm3, they estimated that Earth&#x27;s seafloor contains ~14 million tons of microplastic – about double the amount they estimated based on data from earlier studies – despite calling both estimates &quot;conservative&quot; as coastal areas are known to contain much more microplastic pollution. These estimates are about one to two times the amount of plastic thought – per Jambeck et al., 2015 – to currently enter the oceans annually.

=== Exploitation ===
=== In art and culture ===
Some children&#x27;s play songs include elements such as &quot;There&#x27;s a hole at the bottom of the sea&quot;, or &quot;A sailor went to sea... but all that he could see was the bottom of the deep blue sea&quot;.

On and under the seabed are archaeological sites of historic interest, such as shipwrecks and sunken towns. This underwater cultural heritage is protected by the UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage. The convention aims at preventing looting and the destruction or loss of historic and cultural information by providing an international legal framework.

<text>VFA-31 or Strike Fighter Squadron 31 is known as the &quot;Tomcatters&quot;, callsign &quot;Felix&quot;, a United States Navy strike fighter squadron stationed at Naval Air Station Oceana flying the F/A-18E Super Hornet. The Tomcatters are the second-oldest Navy Fighter Attack squadron operating today.

==Squadron insignia and nickname==
The squadron was originally known as the &quot;Shooting Stars&quot;. The original &quot;Felix the Cat&quot; squadron was VF-3. After the Battle of Midway, VF-3 and VF-6 swapped designations on 15 July 1943, resulting in a three-year controversy as to which squadron owned the Felix name and emblem until VF-3 was re-designated VF-3A on 15 November 1946, and awarded the official approval to adopt Felix the Cat by the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO). VF-3A was then re-designated VF-31 on 7 August 1948.

The emblem and mascot is the famous cartoon character Felix the Cat, running with a large spherical black bomb with a lit fuse. The yellow field and outline were omitted from the aircraft and four stars at the end of a pair of sweeps were added. This emblem can be seen on the fuselage of the aircraft above the wing.

Several well-known aviators have flown with Felix on their shoulders, including Charles Lindbergh and Butch O&#x27;Hare.

The nickname &quot;Tomcatters&quot; was adopted in 1948.

==History==
Two US Navy squadrons have held the designation VF-31. The first to be designated VF-31 was in existence from May 1943 to Oct 1945 and is &quot;not&quot; related to the subject of this article. The second VF-31 has a direct lineage to the current VFA-31 &quot; Tomcatters&quot;.

===Early years===

VFA-31, was originally established as VF-1B on 1 July 1935, flying the F4B, making it the second-oldest active US Navy squadron behind VFA-14, which was originally established in 1919.

On 1 July 1937, the squadron combined with VF-8B and was redesignated VF-6, flying the F3F. Between the years 1937 and 1943 VF-6 flew the F3F-1 and two variants of the F4F Wildcat and ended with the F4F-4.

On 15 July 1943, VF-6 swapped designations with VF-3 and began flying the F6F Hellcat.

Through the years the squadron and their predecessors have served on many of the Navy&#x27;s early aircraft carriers, including the first, ; the second, ; and the sixth, . They were aboard &quot;Enterprise&quot; during the Attack on Pearl Harbor as well as the battles of Wake Island, Marcus Island, Midway, Guadalcanal, and the Eastern Solomon Islands. The squadron also saw aerial combat over the Philippines, Formosa, Okinawa, and China.

On 7 August 1948, VF-3A was redesignated VF-31. For almost four years, the squadron flew the F9F Panther, the squadron&#x27;s first jet aircraft.

===1950s===
In 1952, the squadron transitioned to the F2H Banshee, and then switched to the F3H Demon in 1957, flying it through 1962.

===1960s===

VF-31 transitioned to the F-4 Phantom II in 1964, flying the B model for two years before transitioning to the F-4J.

===1970s===
In 1972, squadron aircraft shot down a MiG-21 over North Vietnam with a F-4J Phantom and in doing so made VF-31 the only Navy fighter squadron to achieve aerial victories in three wars – World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War.

===1980s===

In 1980, VF-31 and concluded a 24-year period of continuous service together, the longest in US naval history.

VF-31 received the F-14A Tomcat in early 1981. The squadron&#x27;s first cruise was on board . In 1983, VF-31 embarked on its fourth cruise with &quot;Kennedy&quot;. The cruise took the carrier and its air wing to the southern Mediterranean off the North African coast. VF-31 regularly flew over Lebanese and Syrian positions in support of multi-national peacekeeping operations, often being fired at by Syrian AAA. During a mission in early December 1983, heat-seeking SA-7 SAMs were launched at two squadron F-14s. Although both Tomcats were able to return safely to &quot;Kennedy&quot;, this incident led to US Navy retaliatory strikes. On 4 December, both carriers in the Mediterranean Sea, &quot;Kennedy&quot; and , launched strikes against Syrian SAM sites, losing one A-7 Corsair II and one A-6 Intruder.

VF-31 shifted carriers and air wings in April 1985 joining along with its sister squadron, the VF-11 &quot;Red Rippers&quot;.

In June 1986, VF-31 and the rest of the &quot;Forrestal&quot; battle group set sail for the Mediterranean. While deployed the squadron participated in numerous fleet exercises. In August 1986, VF-31 participated in joint exercises with the Egyptian Air Force and Navy.

In September 1987, VF-31 and the &quot;Forrestal&quot; battle group participated in North Atlantic exercises above the Arctic Circle. In April, 1988 VF-31 and the &quot;Forrestal&quot; battle group set sail for a six-month Indian Ocean cruise which lasted for six months. &quot;Forrestal&quot; and CVW-6, with VF-31 attached, supported Operation Earnest Will, the escort of U.S. flagged tankers in the Persian Gulf. While heading home from the &quot;IO&quot;, the battle group once again participated in North Atlantic NATO exercises before coming home to NAS Oceana.

===1990s===
During May 1991, VF-31 and other CVW-6 squadrons on the &quot;Forrestal&quot; participated in Operation Provide Comfort, flying missions over northern Iraq in support of the Kurdish relief effort. VF-31 stayed with &quot;Forrestal&quot; until 1992, when the squadron switched carriers, planes and home bases. VF-31 (and VF-11) moved from NAS Oceana to NAS Miramar and to , and exchanged its F-14As for the new and improved F-14Ds.

In late 1996, VF-31 returned from its second Western Pacific deployment aboard USS &quot;Carl Vinson&quot;, flying missions in the Persian Gulf and over southern Iraq in support of Operations Southern Watch and Desert Strike.

VF-31 moved back to NAS Oceana in 1997. The squadron sent a single F-14D and crew to the 1997 Paris Air Show, primarily to promote new F-14 LANTIRN.

In 1998 the squadron made a deployment to the Persian Gulf with supporting Operation Southern Watch.

===2000s===
2000 began with a WESTPAC deployment on board USS &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;.

VF-31 deployed aboard USS &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; in July 2002, operating over Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, and again over the skies of Iraq supporting Operation Southern Watch. During their return home, the entire battle group was turned around on 1 January for the commencement of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Flying from the first night of combat, VF-31 was responsible for delivering ordnance to targets in Baghdad and the southern vicinities in direct support of coalition forces. During that deployment, VF-31 had the dubious distinction of having the longest cruise in the last 30 years of the Navy&#x27;s history, returning to NAS Oceana on 2 May 2003. The squadron flew 585 sorties, dropping 276 LGB/JDAM/MK 82.

In 2004, VF-31 and CVW-14 embarked on for a WESTPAC cruise, returning to the US on 31 October 2004.

In December 2004, VF-31 transferred from Carrier Air Wing Fourteen to its current home with Carrier Air Wing Eight and .

In September 2005, the squadron deployed aboard USS &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; with CVW-8 for the final F-14 deployment, again to the Persian Gulf. 7 February 2006 marked the last recovery of an F-14 Tomcat from a combat mission. While operating from &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, VF-31 was credited with being the last F-14 unit to drop a bomb in combat. VF-31 returned to NAS Oceana on 10 March 2006, for the final F-14 fly-in.

VF-31 remained operational aboard &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; until 28 July 2006, when the last Tomcat landing and catapult launch took place off the Virginia Capes, with journalists from around the world (Mexico, UK, Holland, Germany and US) witnessing. VF-31 was the last Tomcat squadron, with the last F-14 flight occurring on 4 October 2006, as BuNo.164603 flew from NAS Oceana to Republic Airport. After spending a year at the American Airpower Museum, the aircraft is now on static display outside of the former Grumman Aerospace Corporation headquarters in Bethpage, NY.

VF-31 transitioned to F/A-18E Super Hornet and was redesignated VFA-31 in late 2006.

VFA-31, along with CVW-8 and &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot;, participated in Joint Task Force Exercise 08-4 Operation Brimstone off the coast of North Carolina between 21 July – 31 July 2008. The British carrier , the amphibious assault ship with associated units and the Brazilian Navy frigate &quot;Greenhalgh&quot; and the French submarine also participated in the event.

On 8 September 2008, VFA-31 and the rest of CVW-8 deployed on board USS &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; on a regularly scheduled deployment. On 4 October, the &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; Carrier Group arrived in Cape Town, South Africa, the first visit by an American aircraft carrier since 1967 and three days later the carrier left Cape Town. CVW-8 and CVN-71 supported Operation Enduring Freedom and flew more than 3,100 sorties and dropped more than 59,500 pounds of ordnance while providing close air support for ISAF-forces in Afghanistan.

===2010s===

On 11 May 2011, the squadrons of CVW-8 embarked on &#x27;s maiden deployment, to conduct operations in the US 5th and 6th Fleet areas of operations. returning to NAS Oceana in December, 2011, days before the return of USS &quot;George H.W. Bush&quot;. VFA-31 flew extensive ground attack missions in Operation Inherent Resolve against IS targets in Syria, and peacefully intercepted MiG 29s.

==Awards==
During its long history, the squadron has received the Commander Naval Air Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet Battle Effectiveness Award for the best fighter squadron in the Atlantic Fleet, the Admiral Joseph C. Clifton Award for the top fighter squadron in the Navy, the Wade McClusky Award as most outstanding attack squadron in the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations Safety &quot;S&quot; award, and the Arleigh Burke Award, which is awarded &quot;to the ship or squadron with the most improved battle efficiency&quot;.

In 1974, VF-31 was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for excellence in combat during deployment to Vietnam in 1972–1973.

<text>Colonel John Augustus Wood VC (10 June 1818 – 23 January 1878) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Wood was 38 years old, and a captain in the 20th Bombay Native Infantry, Bombay Army during the Persian War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 9 December 1856 at Bushire, Persia, Captain Wood led a Grenadier Company which formed the head of the assaulting column and was the first man on the parapet of the fort, where he was immediately attacked by a large number of the garrison. A volley was fired at Captain Wood and the head of the storming party at very close range but although the captain was hit by seven musket balls he at once threw himself upon the enemy, killing their leader. He was closely followed by the men of his company and speedily overcame all opposition.

His was the first Victoria Cross to be won in a British Indian regiment and the standard captured that day is still preserved by the battalion.

==Further information==
He later achieved the rank of colonel. His VC is held by the 2 Rajputana Rifles regiment of the Indian Army. He died on 23 January 1878 aged 59.

<text>The Iowa Supreme Court is the highest court in the U.S. state of Iowa. The Court is composed of a chief justice and six associate justices.

The Court holds its regular sessions in Des Moines in the Iowa Judicial Branch Building located at 1111 East Court Avenue on the state Capitol grounds, south of the Iowa State Capitol.

==History==
In 1846, Iowa became the 29th state to join the United States. Following the constitution of the Federal government, the powers of the government in Iowa were divided into the legislative branch, the executive branch, and the judicial branch. The Iowa General Assembly divided the state into four judicial districts, and Supreme Court justices were to serve six year terms, while district judges were elected for five year terms. The Constitution of Iowa of 1857 increased the number of judicial districts to 11, and allowed the General Assembly to reorganize districts after 1860 and every four years thereafter.

==Functions==
The Supreme Court of Iowa is an appellate court. An appellate court reviews decisions of trial courts in which appeals have been allowed. An appellate court does not preside over trials. Appellate court hearings do not involve witnesses, juries, new evidence, or court reporters. Instead, an appellate court reviews the written record of the trial court to determine whether any significant legal errors occurred

The seven-member Supreme Court of Iowa has many important responsibilities.
* The Court is the &quot;court of last resort&quot; or the highest court in the Iowa state court system. Its opinions are binding on all other Iowa state courts.
* The Iowa Supreme Court has the sole power to admit persons to practice as attorneys in the courts of Iowa, to prescribe rules to supervise attorney conduct, and to discipline attorneys.
* The Court is responsible for promulgating rules of procedure and practice used throughout the state courts.
* The Supreme Court has supervisory and administrative control over the judicial branch and over all judicial officers and court employees.

==Justices==

Justices are appointed by the governor from a list of nominees submitted by the State Judicial Nominating Commission. A justice serves an initial term consisting of one year plus whatever time remains until the January 1st following the next judicial retention election after the expiration of the one year period. The regular term of office of justices retained at election is eight years. A justice must retire upon reaching the age of 72. The justices elect the chief justice. Terms end on December 31 of the year listed.

==Notable decisions==
=== &quot;In re Ralph, a colored man&quot; ===
&quot;In re Ralph, a colored man&quot;, July 4, 1839 was the first reported decision in the Supreme Court of the Territory of Iowa, a federal court with jurisdiction similar to that the Iowa Supreme Court would eventually hold when Iowa achieved statehood. It was decided twenty six years before the 13th Amendment, eighteen years before &quot;Dred Scott&quot;, and seven years before Iowa was granted statehood. A black man from Missouri, Ralph, was allowed to travel to Iowa to work, in an attempt to purchase his freedom. When Ralph could not obtain the amount needed, the slave owner sent bounty hunters to return Ralph to Missouri. The opinion denied the slave owner while giving Ralph his freedom, expounding that the law &quot;extend[s] equal protection to men of all colors and conditions&quot;.

===&quot;Clark v. The Board of Directors&quot;===
In 1868, the Iowa Supreme Court decided &quot;Clark v. Board of School Directors&quot;, ruling that racially segregated &quot;separate but equal&quot; schools had no place in Iowa, 86 years before the U.S. Supreme Court reached the same decision.

===Arabella Mansfield===
In 1869, Iowa became the first state in the union to admit women to the practice of law, with the Court ruling that women may not be denied the right to practice law in Iowa and admitting Arabella Mansfield to the practice of law.

===&quot;Coger v. The North Western Union Packet Co.&quot;===
The Court heard &quot;Coger v. The North Western Union Packet Co.&quot; in 1873, ruling against racial discrimination in public accommodations 91 years before the U.S. Supreme Court reached the same decision.

===&quot;Varnum v. Brien&quot;===
On April 3, 2009, in &quot;Varnum v. Brien&quot;, the Iowa Supreme Court unanimously struck down a statutory same-sex marriage ban as unconstitutional, joining the highest judicial bodies of Massachusetts, Connecticut, California, and Hawaii as the fifth court to rule for the right of same-sex marriage under the state constitution. At the next judicial retention election in 2010, voters removed all three justices facing a retention vote. It was the first time any Iowa Supreme Court justice had been removed by voters. Chief Justice Marsha Ternus, Justice Michael Streit, and Justice David L. Baker each received support from 45% or less of voters.

=== &quot;Nelson v. Knight&quot; ===
Marissa Nelson, a dental assistant, filed suit against her former employer Dr. James Knight, who terminated her employment at the insistence of his wife. Nelson had previously been texting Knight about personal matters outside work. On December 21, 2012, the court issued a 7-0 decision siding with Knight. The opinion, authored by Edward Mansfield, held that the termination of Nelson&#x27;s employment did not constitute unlawful sex discrimination.

=== &quot;Planned Parenthood v. Reynolds&quot; (2018) ===
The Court heard arguments in a lawsuit brought against the state of Iowa and the Iowa Board of Medicine by Planned Parenthood and Dr. Jill Meadows regarding a 72-hour waiting period to receive an abortion enacted by the state legislature and signed into law by Governor Terry Branstad in 2017. The Court decided in a 5-2 majority opinion, authored by Chief Justice Mark Cady, that the waiting period violated the due process and equal protection clauses of the Iowa Constitution because its restrictions &quot;are not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest of the state.&quot; Justice Cady argued that the state can inform women about abortion, including providing information about adoption, but that a 72-hour waiting period does not serve this interest sufficiently narrowly and imposes an undue burden on Iowan women.

=== &quot;Planned Parenthood v. Reynolds&quot; (2022) ===
In June 2022, the Court, in a 5–2 vote, found that the Iowa Constitution did not protect a right to an abortion, overruling its 2018 decision. The Court upheld a law establishing a 24-hour waiting period.

<text>Wilfred Wood VC (2 February 1897 – 3 January 1982) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

The VC was awarded for action on the Italian front against Austro-Hungarian forces in the First World War.

==Details==
He was 21 years old, and a private in the 10th Battalion, The Northumberland Fusiliers, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place at the battle of Vittorio Veneto for which he was awarded the VC.
For most conspicuous bravery and initiative on 28 October 1918, near Casa Van, Italy, when a unit on the right flank having been held up by hostile machine guns and snipers, Pte. Wood, on his own initiative, worked forward with his Lewis gun, enfiladed the enemy machine-gun nest, and caused 140 enemy to surrender.

The advance was continued till a hidden machine gun opened fire at point blank range. Without a moment&#x27;s hesitation Pte. Wood charged the machine gun, firing his Lewis gun from the hip at the same time. He killed the machine-gun crew, and without further orders pushed on and enfiladed a ditch from which three officers and 160 men subsequently surrendered.

The conspicuous valour and initiative of this gallant soldier in the face of intense rifle and machine-gun fire was beyond all praise.
After the war, he returned to his pre-war job on the railways, first as a Fireman, then as an engine driver. He retired in 1960 as a supervisor.

A LNWR Claughton Class locomotive was named after him in 1922. When this type was withdrawn from service, a London, Midland and Scottish Railway Patriot Class steam locomotive was named after him, from which the nameplate resided inside Norbury Primary School in Hazel Grove until it was donated to the Fusiliers Museum of Northumberland.

The JD Wetherspoon pub in Hazel Grove is named after him.

<doc id="1189291" wikidata="Q39738" url="?curid=1189291" title="Laoag">
<text>Laoag (), officially the City of Laoag (; ), is a component city and capital of the province of Ilocos Norte, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 111,651 people.

It is the province&#x27;s most populous settlement, as well as its political, commercial, and industrial hub. The Ilocos Region&#x27;s busiest commercial airport is also built in Laoag. It is also the northernmost city in the Philippines.

The municipalities of San Nicolas, Paoay, Sarrat, Piddig, Vintar, and Bacarra form its boundaries. The foothills of the Cordillera Central mountain range to the east, and the West Philippine Sea to the west are its physical boundaries.

Laoag experiences a prevailing monsoon climate of Northern Luzon, characterized by a dry season from November to April and a wet season from May to October. Despite being battered by powerful typhoons occasionally, Laoag can still be referred to as the &quot;Sunshine City&quot;.

==History==
Long before the coming of the Spaniards, there already existed an extensive region consisting of the present provinces of Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, Abra, and La Union renowned for its gold mines. Merchants from Japan and China would often visit the area to trade gold with beads, ceramics, and silk. The Austronesian inhabitants of the region called their place &quot;samtoy&quot;, from &quot;sao mi itoy&quot;, which literally meant &quot;this is our language.&quot;

In 1571, when the Spanish conquistadors had Manila more or less under their control, they began looking for new sites to conquer. Legaspi&#x27;s grandson, Juan de Salcedo, volunteered to lead one of these expeditions. Together with eight armed boats and 45 men, the 22-year-old voyager headed north.

On June 13, 1572, Salcedo and his men landed in Vigan and then proceeded towards Laoag, Currimao, and Badoc. As they sailed along the coast, they were surprised to see numerous sheltered coves (&quot;looc&quot;) where the locals lived in harmony. As a result, they named the region &quot;Ylocos&quot; and its people &quot;Ylocanos&quot;.

As the Christianization of the region grew, so did the landscape of the area. Vast tracts of land were utilized for churches and bell towers in line with the Spanish mission of (&#x27;under the bells&#x27;) – a proclamation by King Philip&#x27;s 1573 Law of the Indies. In the town plaza, it was not uncommon to see garrisons under the church bells. The colonization process was slowly being carried out.

The Spanish colonization of the region, however, was never completely successful. Owing to the abusive practices of many Augustinian friars, a number of Ilocanos revolted against their colonizers. Noteworthy of these were the Dingras uprising (1589) and Pedro Almasan revolt in San Nicolas (1660). In 1762, Diego Silang led a series of battles aimed at freeing the Ilocanos from the Spanish yoke. When he died from an assassin&#x27;s bullet, his widow Gabriela continued the cause. Unfortunately, she too was captured and hanged. In 1807, the sugar cane (&quot;basi&quot;) brewers of Piddig rose up in arms to protest the government&#x27;s monopoly of the wine industry. In 1898, the church excommunicated Gregorio Aglipay for refusing to cut off ties with the revolutionary forces of Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo. Unperturbed, he established the . Aglipay&#x27;s movement and the national sentiment it espoused helped restore the self-respect of many Filipinos.
&quot;The great increase in population from 1715 to 1818 from 18,980 to 282,845 made the administration of the province very difficult. Due to the excessive monopolies and forced labor, there were several uprisings: first by the people of Dingras in 1589; one that was led by Pedro Almazan in 1616; the revolt of Diego Silang in 1762–1763; by Ambaristo in 1788; by Pedro Mateo in 1808 (also known as Basi Revolt) and uprising of Sarrat in 1815. For this reason, the division of the Ilocos into two provinces was recommended by the local authorities. On February 2, 1818, a Spanish Royal Decree was promulgated dividing the Province of Ilocos Norte from Ilocos Sur. Laoag, which was then the biggest center of population, was made the capital of Ilocos Norte.&quot;

Laoag was captured by the Japanese Army on December 12, 1941, two days after the landing at Vigan and Aparri. Its airport was then used by the Japanese for most of World War II.

===Cityhood===

Built with an Italian Renaissance, the church has an unusual two-story façade, supported by two pairs of columns on each side of the arched entrance architecture design and at the top of the facade holds a recessed niche that showcases the image of the city&#x27;s patron saint, William of Maleval.

The dramatic increase in tourist arrivals also prompted the establishment of a Chinese consulate to oversee the security of Chinese citizens living or visiting the city. A new immigration policy was made to simplify entry of Chinese tourists into the country by issuing visitor visas at the airport upon arrival to entice more guests to come. Laoag City has been named as one of the top tourist destinations in Region I and in the country.

==Transportation==
Laoag International Airport services flights by PAL Express, Cebu Pacific and Sky Pasada with destinations to and from Manila, Cebu, Calayan Island, and Basco, Batanes. The Honolulu - Laoag vice versa will soon resume its direct flight with Philippine Airlines as its carrier. Foreign airlines offer direct charter flights to Laoag as part of travel packages with optional excursions to tourist destinations outside the city. Tourists can find travel agencies including ticket offices of several airlines at the terminal building.

Several large bus companies serve Laoag City making connections to North and Central Luzon provinces including Metro Manila. These transportation services are provided by GV Florida Transport, Viron Transit, Maria de Leon Bus Lines, Partas and Fariñas Transit Company. Laoag is from Manila via South Road Access of Laoag and via North Access of Laoag from Metro Manila.

Mode of transport within the city includes taxi, jeepney, tricycle, and kalesa. Mini buses have daily routes to and from Pagudpud, Batac, and Vigan among others.

The Laoag bypass linking Paoay on the western part serves as diversion road to long wheeler trucks without crossing the city proper. Another bypass road east of the city is under construction linking Bacarra and San Nicolas towns will help decongest traffic upon completion.

Although a fast developing city and premier tourist destination in the north Laoag has no modern traffic light system in major thoroughfares of the city.

==Education==
As the provincial capital, Laoag is the center of social and economic activity with almost all major commercial and institutional establishments gravitating towards it. The importance of education in socializing its population is shared by both the local government and the private sector, which has invested heavily in the development of the academic infrastructure.

Most of the lower-level schools are government-owned and are divided into three districts, comprising a total of thirty-three elementary schools. Ten private elementary schools are also present including a Chinese school. In addition, there are eight private and six public high schools, and significant rise of integrated schools.

In order to provide continuing education to sustain the economic momentum of the region, the government has established tertiary public learning institutions in the city: the College of Teacher Education (CTE) and the College of Industrial Technology (CIT) of the Mariano Marcos State University.

Other higher education institutions in the city include Northwestern University, Northern Christian College, Divine Word College of Laoag, Data Center College of the Philippines, Ilocos Norte College of Arts and Trades, AMA Colleges, and STI College.

Also found in Laoag are vocational schools namely Overseas Technical Institute, Lazo Fashion School, and Bel Arte School of Fine Arts.

The Rodolfo CG Fariñas Jr. National Science High School which is the second being established in Ilocos Region under the Department of Science and Technology, located in Barangay Vira east of bypass road, has already opened this school year 2024–2025 for Grade 7 students.

<doc id="1189303" wikidata="Q661561" url="?curid=1189303" title="Glacier Express">
<text>The Glacier Express is a direct Panorama Express (PE) train connecting railway stations of the two major mountain resorts of Zermatt and St. Moritz via Andermatt in the central Swiss Alps. The train provides a one-seat ride for an 8-hour end-to-end journey, and omits stops made by local trains. The Glacier Express has been called the &#x27;slowest express train in the world&#x27;. As St. Moritz and Zermatt are home to two well-known mountains, the Glacier Express is also said to travel from Matterhorn to Piz Bernina.

The journey from Zermatt starts at the dead end of an Alpine valley, the Mattertal, just below the Matterhorn at an elevation of before it descends to the huge valley of the Valais in Brig. It journeys through the center of the Swiss Alps, over 291 bridges, through 91 tunnels — such as the Furka Tunnel at an elevation of , which circumvents the Furka Pass — makes an intermediate stop at Andermatt in a secluded high Alpine valley, and traverses its high point on the Oberalp Pass at before descending to its low point at Chur at . From Chur, the capital of the canton of Graubünden, the Glacier Express regains altitude, stopping at Filisur — where travelers can change for a connecting train to reach Davos to the east — and then traverses the Albula Range via a tunnel at to reach the resort St. Moritz in a valley to the south. 

Since 2017, the train has been operated by the Glacier Express AG, a cooperation jointly owned by the former operators Matterhorn Gotthard Bahn (MGB) and Rhaetian Railway (RhB). For much of its journey, it also passes along and through the World Heritage Site known as the &quot;Rhaetian Railway in the Albula / Bernina Landscapes&quot;.

The first Glacier Express started on 30 June 1930 at 07:30 in Zermatt. Initially, it was operated by three railway companies: the Visp-Zermatt-Bahn (VZ), the Furka Oberalp Bahn (FO), and the Rhätische Bahn (RhB). From 2003 to 2017, the train was operated by Rhätische Bahn (RhB) and the Matterhorn Gotthard Bahn (MGB), which arose from a merger between the BVZ and the FO.

The entire line is metre gauge (narrow gauge), with using the rack-and-pinion system both for ascending steep grades and to control descent.

==History==

===Early years===
The completion of the final portion of the FO in 1926 opened up the cantons of Valais and Graubünden to further tourist development. In particular, a pathway was laid for the introduction of &quot;Kurswagen&quot; (through coaches) between Brig and Chur, and between Brig and St. Moritz.

In early June 1930, the then Visp–Zermatt Bahn was extended to Brig by the opening of a metre gauge line along the Rhone Valley between Visp and Brig. For the first time, it was feasible to operate through coaches all the way from Zermatt to St. Moritz and return. On , the first train of such coaches set out from Zermatt to St. Moritz, under the name &quot;Glacier Express&quot;. The new train&#x27;s name honoured the Rhone Glacier, which is near Gletsch, on the Furka Pass.

Until 1982, the Glacier Express operated only in the summer months, because the Furka Pass and the Oberalp Pass were both snowed over in winter. Initially, the train was made up of first to third class salon and passenger coaches, supplied by all three of the participating railway companies. Between Chur and Disentis/Mustér, passengers could enjoy a hot lunch in a Mitropa dining car. From 1933, the Glacier Express through coaches were attached to normal passenger trains between Brig and Zermatt.

In the earliest years of the Glacier Express, electric locomotives were used to haul the Glacier Express on the BVZ and the RhB, but steam locomotives were used on the FO. That changed in 1941-1942, when overhead catenary was installed on the FO, enabling completely electric operation for the full length of the route. However, no through trains were operated between 1943 and 1946, due to World War II.

Upon the resumption of daily through trains in 1948, the dining car service was extended from Disentis/Mustér to the top of the Oberalp Pass. Between the 1950s and the 1970s, both the BVZ and the RhB introduced new locomotive classes that, when attached to the Glacier Express, enabled reductions in schedule times. Meanwhile, the dining car service was extended further, to Andermatt.

===Year-round operations===
In 1981, a Glacier Express era came to an end with the final closure for the winter of the FO line over the Furka Pass and through the Furka Summit Tunnel, between Oberwald, Gletsch and Realp. In June 1982, that FO line was replaced by the newly opened Furka Base Tunnel. As a consequence, the Glacier Express not only became disconnected from its namesake Rhone Glacier, but also could now, for the first time, be operated on a year-round basis.

At that time, the BVZ, FO and RhB took the opportunity to relaunch the Glacier Express as a tourist attraction. Promotional material focused on the train&#x27;s status as &quot;the slowest express train in the world&quot;, covering , 91 tunnels, and over 291 bridges. A special promotional wine glass on a sloping base emphasised the steepness of some parts of the route. Passenger numbers rose from 20,000 in 1982 to over 53,000 in 1983, and to just over 80,000 in 1984.

===Recent developments===
In 1985, the Glacier Express timetable was completely revised. Between 1986 and 1993, the BVZ and the FO invested nearly 40 million Swiss francs in constructing 18 new first class panorama cars for the train. By 2005, more than 250,000 passengers were travelling on the Glacier Express each year.

In 2006, a few scenes of the documentary film &quot;The Alps&quot; were shot inside the train, and further new panorama cars were added to the Glacier Express passenger car fleet. On 7 July 2008, the Albula Railway and the Bernina Railway were jointly recorded in the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites, under the name &quot;Rhaetian Railway in the Albula / Bernina Landscapes&quot;. Currently, the Glacier Express is especially popular with tourists from Germany, Japan, and, increasingly, India.

In 2013, the direct service to Davos was discontinued because of decreasing passenger numbers and unfavourable economic circumstances.

In 2018, two additional summer services were introduced. Each morning one service departs from Zermatt to Chur, and one service departs from St. Moritz to Brig. These services then travel back in the afternoon.

===2010 derailment===

On 23 July 2010, a Glacier Express train derailed near Fiesch on the Matterhorn Gotthard Bahn line. One passenger was killed and 42 other passengers were injured. The accident was caused by the train traveling too fast as a result of human error.

== Itinerary ==


=== Albula line ===

Shortly after leaving St. Moritz station () in Graubünden, the train passes Samedan and Bever on the high Engadin plateau. There it continues in the &quot;Val Bever&quot; before entering the Albula Tunnel at under the Albula Pass. After the tunnel, the train passes through Preda, the first station in the &quot;Albula Valley&quot; and continues toward Bergün/Bravuogn. Between these two villages, the train has to go through many spirals because of the high difference of altitude within a short distance ( for ).

After another spiral, the train reaches Filisur at the end of the valley at (). From there, the train passes on the Landwasser Viaduct, the most emblematic landmark of the railway line and continues toward Thusis () where it reaches the Posterior Rhine and follows it to the city of Chur ().

=== Oberalp section ===

From Chur, the train follows back the course of the Rhine through the gorge of Ruinaulta and climbs slowly the valley toward Ilanz (), Disentis/Mustér () and Sedrun (). From Sedrun the line becomes steeper to finally reach its summit, the Oberalp Pass at . From there the train enters the Canton of Uri in Central Switzerland and continues down to Andermatt ().

=== Furka section ===

From Andermatt, the train goes forward in the valley called Urseren passing the villages of Hospental () and Realp (). From there the train enters the Furka Base Tunnel, leaving the old railway line which climbs the Furka Pass (operated today by the Furka Cogwheel Steam Railway), to emerge in Oberwald () in the Goms Valley, in the Canton of Valais. The train then continues toward Brig, following the course of the Rhone, and passes along the villages of Ulrichen (), Münster-Geschinen () and Fiesch (), before going through another spiral.

=== Mattertal line ===
From Brig, () the train continues to Visp (), then enters the valley of Mattertal and goes up, passing the villages of Stalden (), St. Niklaus () and Randa (), where a spectacular debris avalanche completely disconnected the railway and road in 1991. Täsch () is an important station as it is the end of the open road, and therefore a terminal for motorists. After a steeper section the train finally arrives in Zermatt at , after nearly 8 hours of travel.

<doc id="1189308" wikidata="Q164304" url="?curid=1189308" title="Deal or No Deal">
<text>Deal or No Deal is the name of several closely related television game shows, the first of which (launching the format) was the Dutch &quot;Miljoenenjacht&quot; (&quot;Hunt/Chase for Millions&quot;). 

The centerpiece of this format is the final round (a.k.a. the &quot;case game&quot; or &quot;main game&quot;) which is played with up to 26 cases (or, in some versions, boxes), each containing randomly assigned sums of money. After the player for the case game is determined, this contender claims one case or a box at the start of the game, without its contents being revealed. The contestant then chooses the other cases or boxes, one at a time, to be immediately opened and removed from play. Throughout the game, the player is offered an amount of money or prizes to sell back their case and end the game, being asked the titular question, &quot;Deal or No Deal?&quot; If the contestant rejects every deal and eliminates all the other cases, the player keeps the money that was in their case. While almost all contestants win money, a winning outcome is dependent on whether the player should have taken one of the deals or should have held onto the original case or box until the very end.

==Gameplay==
The gameplay of the show differs from country to country. In some countries, there is a preliminary contest in which the studio audience is whittled down to one final contender by several trivia question rounds, this final contender then proceeds to the main game. This was the format used by the Dutch show &quot;Miljoenenjacht&quot; (Hunt/Chase for Millions) which initiated the &quot;Deal or no Deal&quot; game (originally the Dutch show was based on a German format called &quot;Die Chance deines Lebens&quot; (The Chance of your Lifetime) which was based on trivia questions and did not have the briefcase element at all). There are also some versions with the number of players equal to the number of cases, each player receives one case. Via a short trivia round or a random selection, one player is selected to be the contestant for the main game with their case. In other countries, there is only one preselected contestant who will play the main game without any preliminary contest.

The main game revolves around the opening of a set of numbered briefcases, each of which contains a different prize (cash or otherwise). The contents (i.e., the values) of all of the cases are known at the start of the game, but the specific location of any prize is unknown. The contestant claims (or is assigned) a case to begin the game. The case&#x27;s value is not revealed until the conclusion of the game.

The contestant then begins choosing cases that are to be removed from play. The amount inside each chosen case is immediately revealed; by process of elimination, the amount revealed cannot be inside the case the contestant initially claimed (or was assigned). Throughout the game, after a predecided number of cases have been opened, the &quot;Banker&quot; offers the contestant an amount of money and/or prizes to quit the game; the offer is based roughly on the amounts remaining in play and the contestant&#x27;s demeanor, so the bank tries to &#x27;buy&#x27; the contestant&#x27;s case for a lower price than what&#x27;s inside the case. The player then answers the titular question, choosing:

* &quot;Deal&quot;, accepting the offer presented and ending the game, or
* &quot;No Deal&quot;, rejecting the offer and continuing the game.

This process of removing cases and receiving offers continues, until either the player accepts an offer to &#x27;deal&#x27;, or all offers have been rejected and the values of all unchosen cases are revealed. Should a player end the game by taking a deal, a pseudo-game is continued from that point to see how much the player could have won by remaining in the game. Depending on subsequent choices and offers, it is determined whether or not the contestant made a &quot;good deal&quot;, i.e. won more than if the game were allowed to continue.

Since the range of possible values is known at the start of each game, how much the banker offers at any given point changes based on what values have been eliminated (i.e. the offer increases if lower values are eliminated and decreases if upper values are eliminated). To promote suspense and lengthen games, the banker&#x27;s offer is usually less than the expected value dictated by probability theory, particularly early in the game. Generally, the offers early in the game are very low relative to the values still in play, but near the end of the game approach (or even exceed) the average of the remaining values.

Only a few people have ever won the top prize on any version of the show (see table below). For a contestant to win the top prize the player would have to select the case containing the top prize and reject every offer the banker makes during the game. The chances of a player selecting the top prize are 4–5% depending on how many amounts are in the game.

==International versions==

==Top prize winners==

All amounts below the prizes are their equivalents in United States dollars at the time of their win.


At the other end of the spectrum, in the UK edition broadcast on December 7, 2009, a contestant named Corinne opened her box to reveal (and thus win) 1p, having turned down first an offer of £88,000 and then an offer to swap boxes, which would have given her the top £250,000 prize. A similar event occurred on the U.S. version on August 25, 2008, where contestant Koshka Blackburn won $5,000 which was in her case after turning down the banker&#x27;s offer of $530,000 and then the option to switch cases, which would&#x27;ve made her the first $1,000,000 winner. Also in the U.S. on September 22, 2006, Michelle Falco kept in $750,000 and $1,000,000 in play all the way to the end, she turned down the biggest offer of $880,000 and refused to switch her case, in her case was $750,000. She also would have been the first $1,000,000 winner had she switched cases. And again, in the U.S. on October 22, 2008, contestant Richie Bell won $1 which was in his case after rejecting the final offer of $416,000 and the option to switch cases, which would&#x27;ve made him the second $1,000,000 winner. Richie also won an additional $10,000 after completing the &quot;Banker&#x27;s Challenge&quot; minigame, thus making his total winnings $10,001. Had he had switched, he would have won $1,010,000.

Many other contestants around the world also would have won the top prize if they had swapped their box/case, or if they refused the Banker&#x27;s Offer instead, which later shown that they had the top prize in their box/case all the time.

==Basis and antecedents==
The game show has attracted attention from mathematicians, statisticians, and economists as a natural decision-making experiment. In 2008 a team of economists analyzed the decisions of people appearing in Dutch, German and U.S. episodes and found, among other things, that contestants are less risk-averse or even risk-seeking when they saw their expected winnings drop. They went so far as to say that the show, &quot;almost appears to be an economics experiment rather than a TV show.&quot; They found that contestants behave similarly in different versions of the show, despite large differences in the amounts at stake; amounts appear to be evaluated in relative terms, for example in proportion to the initial average, and not in terms of their absolute monetary value. The research received a great deal of media attention, appearing on the front page of The Wall Street Journal and being featured on National Public Radio. This work was built upon by de Roos and Sarafidis, who analysed the Australian version of the show and determined that the risk-taking behaviour of a number of contestants would be inconsistent within each game (i.e. their aversion to risk would change), depending on the state of play and relative risk aversion of their confidant on the show.

Australian &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot; contestants are selected &quot;on the basis of being &#x27;outgoing&#x27;, but there is no screening of contestants on the basis of their risk preferences&quot;. It is thought that other versions may screen contestants for being amicable to risk-taking behaviour.

Despite its air of originality and huge international success—there are more than 60 versions worldwide—there have been, in fact, numerous antecedents to the current run of shows. The first was the &quot;It&#x27;s in the Bag,&quot; a New Zealand radio game show invented by Selwyn Toogood which began in the 1950s and which ran for decades after it was later adapted for television (1970s–90s). The show popularized the catch-phrases, &quot;By hokey,&quot; and &quot;What will it be, customers—the money or the bag?&quot; in New Zealand. Similarly, in the 1950s, the UK TV show &quot;Take Your Pick!&quot; offered contestants the choice of taking a money offer or risking opening a box. Later, in the 1980s, &quot;The Bong Game,&quot; a radio call-in show created by UK&#x27;s Capital FM, tested contestants by offering them increasing returns in tandem with increasing risk.

Another long-running game show, &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal,&quot; involved contestants deciding whether or not to take offers based on what may or may not be behind a curtain/door or inside a box. &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; ran in the U.S. for nearly three decades from 1963 to 1991, during which time Monty Hall was the program&#x27;s &quot;Big Dealer,&quot; and was revived in 2009 with Wayne Brady as the Big Dealer. Also in the U.S., in the 1970s and 1980s, was a game show called &quot;Treasure Hunt,&quot; hosted by Geoff Edwards and produced by Chuck Barris&#x27;s company, which featured a similar concept to &quot;Deal or No Deal.&quot; The show featured contestants selecting a treasure chest or box with surprises inside in the hope of winning large prizes or a cash jackpot. Both game shows, however, also featured worthless or nearly-worthless joke prizes, which &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; called &quot;zonks&quot; and which &quot;Treasure Hunt&quot; called &quot;klunks.&quot; &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot; does not feature such joke prizes in the US version but does in many international versions. Finally, from 1997 to 2003, &quot;Win Ben Stein&#x27;s Money&quot; pitted contestants against an in-house adversary.

== Methodology used by &quot;The Bank&quot; ==
Several theories concern the methodology &quot;The Bank&quot; uses to determine the appropriate bank offer. This is a secret held by the various publishers around the world, however several people have approximated the algorithm with various levels of accuracy. In most variations of the format, the Bank does not know the contents of the briefcase, and therefore, the Monty Hall problem does not apply to the probability calculations, but this varies from country to country.

Statistical studies of the US version of the show were undertaken by Daniel Shifflet in 2011, and showed a linear regression of bank offers against expected value. In summary, Shifflet found that in the syndicated 30-minute version of the show the bank would offer a percentage of the expected value (EV) of the remaining cases, and this percentage increased linearly from approximately 37% of EV at the first offer to approximately 84% of EV at the seventh offer. This version of the program also allowed players to ‘hypothetically’ play out the remainder of the game from the point where they accepted the bank&#x27;s offer, and Shiffler noted that the hypothetical bank offers were significantly higher than real bank offers at equivalent points in the game.

==Video games==
* Innovative Concepts in Entertainment developed an arcade redemption adaptation of the show, where instead of prize money, players could win tickets.
* The U.K. version of &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot; was converted into a mobile game by Gameloft and featured the same rules and format as the TV show. The game was so well-received that versions of it were developed for other countries as well. Its international success landed it on the top-sellers list.
* &quot;Affari tuoi&quot;, the Italian version of the format, was converted into a videogame for the Nintendo DS by the same name.
*Almost all major formats of the game were converted into games for various gaming consoles, the PC, Macromedia Flash, and even a dedicated electronic handheld game.
*Various online gambling and gaming sites have adapted the &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot; concept for their games.

==Online gambling==
The Deal or No Deal television game show, based on the original Dutch Miljoenenjacht (Hunt for Millions), was introduced to the world by Endemol. The popular format, which requires the contestant to choose from 26 boxes or cases to reveal cash values, grew in popularity and eventually made its way into the online gambling industry as a result of the 2009 partnership between Playtech&#x27;s Virtue Fusion and Endemol Games. 
Online Bingo licensees of Virtue Fusion, previously acquired by Playtech, introduced DOND themed 75-ball and 90-ball rooms in addition to a slot game based on the game show, scratch cards and the launch of a new bingo brand named after the game show, Deal or No Deal Bingo.
Online gamblers experience the show&#x27;s concept when securing a Full House win in the themed bingo rooms. The winner or winners enter a round of negotiations with the banker where they must make the ultimate decision, Deal or No Deal. The sense of community, often embraced by bingo players, is called upon as they assist the winner in determining the best option by commenting in the room&#x27;s chat section. The Community Jackpot is divided among the Full House winner (50%) and all game participants (50%).
In February 2016, Playtech announced the renewal of its licensing agreement with Endemol UK, which will see the availability of DOND licensed online products continue for an additional three years. Under this contract, Playtech is granted exclusive rights to deliver these themed games to the UK market.
The range of DOND games are available at Virtue Fusion powered bingo brands such as bet365, Gala Bingo, Ladbrokes, Mecca Bingo and William Hill.

<text>Thomas Woodcock VC (19 March 1888 – 27 March 1918) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest medal that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Woodcock was 29 years old, and a private in the 2nd Battalion, Irish Guards, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 12/13 September 1917 north of Broenbeek, Belgium, when an advanced post had held out for 96 hours and was finally forced to retire, the lance-sergeant (John Moyney) in charge of the party and Private Woodcock covered the retirement. After crossing the stream themselves, Private Woodcock heard cries for help behind him - he returned and waded into the stream amid a shower of bombs and rescued another member of the party whom he carried across open ground in daylight towards our front line, regardless of machine-gun fire.

He was killed in action at Bullecourt, France, on 27 March 1918.

==Further information==
He later achieved the rank of corporal. He is buried at Douchy-les-Ayette British Cemetery, France. 8m SW of Arras. Plot IV. row F. Grave 3.

His Victoria Cross is held by the Irish Guards and is on display at the Guards Museum, Birdcage Walk, London.

<text>Nick Galifianakis (; July 22, 1928 – March 27, 2023) was an American politician, military veteran, and lawyer from North Carolina. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as a member of the North Carolina House of Representatives of Durham County, North Carolina from 1961 to 1967. He then served three terms as a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1967 to 1973.

==Early life==
Galifianakis was born in Durham, North Carolina, the son of Greek immigrants Emmanuel &quot;Mike&quot; Galifianakis and the former Sophia Kastrinakis. He attended local public schools and then Duke University, earning a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1951 and a law degree in 1953.

After serving in the United States Marine Corps from October 1953 to April 1956, Galifianakis entered the Marine Corps Reserves, retiring as a major. He was admitted to the bar and practiced law in Durham. In 1960, he became an assistant professor of business law at Duke.

== State legislature ==
In 1966, he was elected to the first of three consecutive terms in the North Carolina House of Representatives. During his service in the state legislature, he was a leader in North Carolina’s modernization of the state’s judicial system.

==U.S. Congress==
In 1966, Galifianakis was elected to represent North Carolina&#x27;s 5th congressional district in the United States Congress. After the state was forced to conduct a mid-decade redistricting for the 1968 elections, he was placed in North Carolina&#x27;s 4th congressional district, a much more compact district stretching from Durham through Chatham County, North Carolina to Raleigh, North Carolina. He was reelected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1968 and 1970. Galifianakis voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1968, but was a supporter of the Equal Rights Amendment and opposed the Vietnam War.

Rather than seek a fourth term in the House, Galifianakis instead sought the Democratic nomination for the United States Senate seat held by B. Everett Jordan in the 1972 election, defeating him in the primary. While Galifianakis led his Republican challenger, former television commentator Jesse Helms, by a substantial margin for most of the campaign, Helms closed the gap by tying Galifianakis to his party&#x27;s presidential nominee George McGovern and with the late-campaign slogan &quot;Jesse Helms: He&#x27;s One of Us,&quot; which some perceived as a reference to Galifianakis&#x27;s Greek heritage. Galifianakis knew that McGovern was unpopular in his state and tried to distance himself from him. His prospects were also damaged when several conservative Democrats defected to Helms. Helms defeated Galifianakis by eight points in the general election.

Galifianakis sought the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate in 1974. He lost in the primary election, 50–32%, to Robert Burren Morgan, the state&#x27;s attorney general.

== Later career ==

After leaving politics, Galifianakis returned to his law practice in Durham and retired in his mid-80s.

==Personal life and death==
Galifianakis and his wife, the former Mary Louise Cheatham, married on April 5, 1963 in Durham, North Carolina, and had two children, Jon Mark Galifianakis and Katherine Brackney. He died in his sleep on March 27, 2023 at age 94 in Raleigh, North Carolina, following several years of suffering from Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

His nephew Nick Galifianakis is a cartoonist.

His other nephew Zach Galifianakis is an actor and comedian.

He was interred at Woodlawn Memorial Park in Durham, North Carolina.

<doc id="1189327" wikidata="Q20744" url="?curid=1189327" title="Dagebüll">
<text>Dagebüll (; ; ) is a municipality located at the west coast of Schleswig-Holstein in the Nordfriesland district, Germany. Today&#x27;s Dagebüll was created in 1978 as a merger of the municipalities of Fahretoft, Juliane-Marien-Koog and Waygaard. Dagebüll used to be a Hallig, the oldest houses were built on artificial dwelling hills which in parts can still be seen today. In 1704 the area was secured by sea dikes.

== Districts ==
=== Dagebüll Kirche ===
The district of Kirche (Church; North Frisian: &quot;Doogebel Schörk&quot;) is situated in the centre of the Dagebüll polder, constituting the core of the former Hallig. Many old farmsteads can still be found on dwelling hills.

When the church was built in 1731, it did not yet have a bell tower. Only when funds had been raised in 1905/1906, it was decided to build a tower.

=== Dagebüll Hafen ===
The district of Dagebüll Hafen (Dagebüll Harbor; North Frisian: &quot;Doogebel Huuwen&quot;) is located about 3 kilometres to the west of Dagebüll Kirche, directly at the shoreline. A substantial part of visitors to the islands of Föhr and Amrum will leave the mainland via Dagebüll Hafen. The place provides many tourist facilities and a large parking lot and garage for customers of the ferry lines. South of the ferry terminal, there is the Dagebüll Lighthouse, which is not used any more.

Not far from the lighthouse, the facilities of the Water and Shipping Administration are situated, where the Hallig railway line Dagebüll–Oland–Langeneß starts on a 900 millimetres narrow gauge causeway.

=== Fahretoft ===
Fahretoft is located between Dagebüll and Waygaard. The municipality&#x27;s sports club, TSV Fahretoft/Waygaard, founded in 1965, has its seat there. One of the polders in the area, the &quot;Bottschlotter Koog&quot;, was already created between 1633 and 1638, it was named after a local tidal creek. This polder hosts 28 inhabitants, all of whom mainly live on agriculture.

== History ==
The Dagebüll area used to be a tiny Hallig island, in 1626 it measured about 450 hectares. In the 16th and 17th century, several futile attempts were made to secure the area with dikes. It was impossible though to shut off all tidal creeks at once. At the Burchardi flood of 1634, Dagebüll suffered from a great loss of land.

In 1700, the inhabitants were granted a profitable charter, which allowed for the construction of a regular dike in 1702/1703. The new Dagebüll polder amounted to 502 hectares and relatively to the old Hallig, it was considerably shifted to the east. In 1704 a dam was built to connect the Dagebüll polder to the Old Christian Albrechts Polder. By the creation of the Kleisee Polder in 1727, Dagebüll eventually became part of the mainland.

== Traffic ==

=== Shipping ===
The ferry terminal provides services to the islands of Föhr and Amrum, also minor freight ships, mussel cutters and other vessels frequent the port.

=== Railway ===
Dagebüll features two small stations of the Norddeutsche Eisenbahngesellschaft Niebüll (NEG) railway on the route to Niebüll: Dagebüll Mole (on the ferry pier) and Dagebüll Kirche. Moreover, there is an auxiliary station inside Dagebüll Hafen proper. This one is only used when the pier is flooded due to exceptionally high tides and storms.

Since 1929, a small causeway rail connects Dagebüll to the Halligen of Oland and Langeneß across the North Frisian Wadden Sea. The railway is only used for goods transport and coastal management though, not for passenger service. In the beginning, the locomotives used to have sails and thus were driven by the wind, later diesel engines were introduced.

=== Roads ===
Dagebüll can be reached by car from the south via Husum and Bredstedt and from the east via Niebüll on state roads.

== Politics ==
As of 2003, the SPD and the WDFW association held four seats each in the municipality council, the CDU held three.

== Parish ==

The Dagebüll parish consists of the two districts of Dagebüll and Fahretoft. There are two churches, St. Lawrence in Fahretoft, built in 1703 and St. Dionysus in Dagebüll.

== Education ==
The Hans Momsen School at Fahretoft is an elementary school with about 50 pupils from Fahretoft, Waygaard and Dagebüll proper. There are only four, sometimes five teachers.

Subjects taught include German language, mathematics, local history, physical education,
North Frisian language, music, arts and religion. The school features a gymnasium and an outdoor sports field on which TSV Fahretoft/Waygaard&#x27;s football team has its home matches.

The Hans Momsen School was built in 1963, the old schoolhouse was located on the Dagebüll church hill, next to the pastorate.

== Sports club ==
TSV Fahretoft/Waygaard e.V. is the local sports association, it was founded in 1965. Sports offered include football, table tennis, gymnastics and badminton. The annual highlights are the Sports Badge Awards and a local hiking rallye, both of which took place in summer.

== Notable people ==
* Hans Mollenhauer Millies (1883–1957), violinist and composer.
* Christian Jensen (1839–1900), missionary. Founded a missioning society with activities in the United States, Tanganyika, China and Papua New Guinea.
* Hans Momsen (1735–1811), farmer, mathematician and astronomer.

<doc id="1189331" wikidata="Q3696473" url="?curid=1189331" title="Craig Waibel">
<text>Craig Waibel (born August 21, 1975, in Portland, Oregon) is a former American soccer player who spent eleven seasons in Major League Soccer. He was hired as the sporting director of Seattle Sounders FC in April 2021 and became their general manager in 2022.

==Playing career==

===Amateur and college===

Waibel was born in Portland, Oregon, and spent several years in Coeur d&#x27;Alene, Idaho, before his family moved to Spokane, Washington. There, he played for a youth team that traveled to statewide competitions and later Lewis and Clark High School, where Waibel graduated in 1994. During his senior year at Lewis and Clark, he chose to play college soccer at the University of Washington ahead of several other college programs in the Pacific Northwest. Waibel played for four years with the Washington Huskies and captained them for two seasons as the team made consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances. He scored his first collegiate goal from a penalty kick in a 1998 Nike Classic match against the Wisconsin Badgers, which the Huskies won 5–1.

In 1996, Waibel was injured playing for the Spokane Shadow in the USISL Premier League, forcing him to miss his junior college season. Despite that setback, Waibel continued to play for the Shadow in 1997 and 1998.

===Professional===
Upon graduating, Waibel was not selected in the 1999 MLS College Draft. The Seattle Sounders picked him 17th overall in the 1999 A-League draft. He earned a brief call up to the Colorado Rapids in the early part of the 2000 season, but played 27 matches for the Sounders, scoring three goals. Waibel was selected by the San Jose Earthquakes in the 2001 MLS SuperDraft with the 31st overall pick but then waived a month later. The Los Angeles Galaxy signed him soon after as a discovery player. Waibel was part of the Galaxy&#x27;s run to win the 2002 MLS Cup, making 12 appearances for the eventual champions. In addition to playing for the Galaxy, Waibel went on loan to the Sounders in both 2001 and 2002.

The following year, Waibel was waived by the Galaxy and was selected again by the San Jose Earthquakes in the 2002 Waiver Draft. He won his second straight MLS Cup in 2003, this time with the Quakes. For the 2004 season, Waibel stayed with the Earthquakes and scored his first professional goal, as well as a goal in the 2004 MLS Cup Playoffs. His 2005 season was cut short after knee injury he picked up against Santa Clara University in an exhibition game.

The Earthquakes relocated and became the Houston Dynamo before the 2006 season. During the season, Waibel made 28 appearances and scored a career-high five goals. Waibel notched his first career two-goal game in the October 14 season finale against Colorado. Waibel became a fan-favorite player for the Houston Dynamo also starting the &#x27;Waibel&#x27;s Warriors&#x27; charity group to benefit local foundations. With four championships, Wabiel is tied fifth among players for the most MLS Cups won.

In July 2010, Waibel was released by the Dynamo.

==Coaching and administration career==

Waibel served as an assistant coach for the University of Michigan in 2011. He was then announced as an assistant coach for the Washington Huskies men&#x27;s soccer program for the 2012 season. After serving as an assistant coach for Real Salt Lake during the 2014 season he was promoted to technical director for the 2015 season. In August 2015, he was promoted to general manager for the club. In September 2019, Real Salt Lake and Waibel parted ways.

On April 1, 2021, Seattle Sounders FC announced their hiring of Waibel as sporting director, working alongside former Real Salt Lake general manager Garth Lagerwey. He was reunited with his former youth coach Brian Schmetzer, now head coach of the Sounders. After Lagerwey left for Atlanta United FC, the Sounders appointed Waibel as general manager on November 30, 2022.

==Personal life==

Waibel&#x27;s twin brother, Chad, is an American football coach in Croatia. His older brother Mario was a professional lacrosse player and later coach.

<doc id="1189347" wikidata="Q861129" url="?curid=1189347" title="Chris Blackwell">
<text>Christopher Percy Gordon Blackwell OJ (born 22 June 1937) is a Jamaican-British former record producer and the founder of Island Records, which has been called &quot;one of Britain&#x27;s great independent labels.&quot; According to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, to which Blackwell was inducted in 2001, he is &quot;the single person most responsible for turning the world on to reggae music.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; describes him as &quot;indisputably one of the greatest record executives in history,&quot; while &quot;Barron&#x27;s&quot; has described him as &quot;a contender for most interesting man in the world.&quot;

Having formed Island Records in Jamaica on May 22, 1959, Blackwell was among the first to record the Jamaican popular music that eventually became known as ska. Returning to Britain in 1962, he sold records from the back of his car to the Jamaican community. His label became &quot;a byword for uncompromised artistry and era-shaping acts.&quot;

Backed by Stanley Borden from RKO, Blackwell&#x27;s business and reach grew substantially, and he went on to forge the careers of Bob Marley, Grace Jones and U2 among many other diverse high-profile acts. He has produced many seminal albums, including Marley&#x27;s &quot;Catch a Fire&quot; and &quot;Uprising&quot;, Free&#x27;s &quot;Free&quot; and The B-52&#x27;s&#x27; self-titled debut album in 1979.

Having sold Island in 1989, Blackwell embarked on ventures in &quot;hotels, real estate, resorts, another record company, rum, and his Island Films released &quot;Kiss of the Spider Woman&quot; and &quot;Stop Making Sense&quot;, among others.&quot;
In 2022, he published a memoir, &quot;The Islander: My Life in Music and Beyond&quot;.

==Early life==
Christopher Percy Gordon Blackwell was born on 22 June 1937 in Westminster, London, the son of Joseph Blackwell, an Irish member of the family responsible for the Crosse &amp; Blackwell brand, and Blanche Lindo Blackwell, a Costa-Rican-born Jamaican heiress. The family moved to Jamaica soon after his birth where his father became a major in the Jamaica Regiment.
His mother&#x27;s family, the Lindos, were of Sephardic Jewish heritage, originally from Spain, the family adopted Christianity and became New Christians. His parents divorced when he was 10 years old.

Blackwell spent his childhood in Jamaica, and was sent to Britain to continue his education at Harrow. Deciding not to attend university, he returned to Jamaica to become aide-de-camp to Jamaica&#x27;s Governor, Sir Hugh Foot. After Foot was transferred to Cyprus, Blackwell left King&#x27;s House to pursue a career in real estate and other businesses, including managing jukeboxes across the country, which brought him into contact with the Jamaican music community.

In 1958, Blackwell was sailing off Hellshire Beach when his boat ran aground on a coral reef. The twenty-one-year-old swam to the coast and attempted to find help along the shore in searing temperatures. Collapsing on the beach, Blackwell was rescued by Rasta fishermen who tended his wounds and restored him to health with traditional Ital food. The experience gave Blackwell a spiritual introduction to the Rastafarian lifestyle, and was a key to his connection to the culture and its music.

==Founding Island Records==
Only in his early 20s, Blackwell formed Island Records in 1958 with a start-up investment of $10,000 provided by his parents. The business took its name from Alec Waugh&#x27;s novel &quot;Island in the Sun&quot;. Radio personality Graeme Goodall was his initial business partner. Blackwell received an allowance of £2,000 per year from his mother, which enabled him to have his own apartment at a young age and build on the low revenue that the business was bringing in. Island&#x27;s debut release was a piano and vocal album by Bermudian jazz pianist Lance Hayward along with his band members, who all played at Half Moon resort in Jamaica as part of the resort’s in house band. Blackwell began recording Jamaican popular music in 1959, achieving a number one hit there with Laurel Aitken&#x27;s &quot;Boogie in my Bones/Little Sheila.&quot;

In 1961, Blackwell was a location scout and production assistant for the James Bond film &quot;Dr. No&quot; (1962). Blackwell&#x27;s mother, Blanche, had been original Bond author Ian Fleming&#x27;s mistress. After the film wrapped, producer Harry Saltzman offered him a full-time position. Conflicted between music and film, Blackwell visited a psychic, who told him that he would be successful if he stayed in the music industry.

==Commercial breakthrough==
By the following year, the fledgling record producer had released 26 singles and two albums on Island. Blackwell returned to England that year and continued to grow his business. He began having success with the niche market of Jamaican music, and progressed to bringing in licensed master tapes. One of these contained a performance by Jamaican singer Millie Small, who Blackwell brought over to England. In 1964, he produced and recorded Small&#x27;s cover of the 1956 Barbie Gaye song &quot;My Boy Lollipop,&quot; which was one of the first songs recorded in the ska style. Small&#x27;s version was a massive hit in 1964, selling over 7 million copies worldwide. It launched Island Records into mainstream popular music, and is acknowledged as the first ska hit. It also made Small an international star.

Blackwell later recalled his decision to license the release to Fontana, a part of Philips.

==Mainstream success==
After discovering The Spencer Davis Group, featuring Steve Winwood, at a performance in Birmingham, Blackwell focused on the rock acts that Island had signed. Island became one of the most successful independent labels of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s with an eclectic range of artists, including Traffic, King Crimson; Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer; Jethro Tull, Cat Stevens, John Cale, Free, Fairport Convention, Nico; Heads, Hands and Feet; John Martyn, Sparks, Spooky Tooth, Nick Drake, Roxy Music, Grace Jones, Ultravox, Eddie and the Hot Rods, Robert Palmer, Jess Roden, Marianne Faithfull, The Buggles, Etta James, Melissa Etheridge, Julian Cope, The Cranberries, Womack and Womack, U2, and others.

Blackwell also signed artists in non-English speaking countries such as French singer Charlélie Couture whose album, &quot;Poèmes rock&quot;, was released on Island. &quot;The bigger labels are supermarkets,&quot; Blackwell remarked. &quot;I like to think of Island as a very classy delicatessen.&quot; Yet Blackwell has admitted to turning down some major names, most notably Elton John, whom he considered too shy to become a successful performer.
Island and Blackwell himself became renowned for a relaxed, nurturing approach. Blackwell showed skill in spotting and creating trends, as well as a gift for finding talent. He had an imaginative flair for marketing, and Island&#x27;s releases were often packaged in lovingly designed gatefold sleeves. Blackwell has said: &quot;I really believe that if people see something that looks good, subconsciously they&#x27;ll think maybe there&#x27;s something going on inside, on the record. There were times when somebody came out with a cover which was actually better than the record itself, so I&#x27;d have to send them back to remake the record.&quot;

In 1968, Blackwell was the first record executive to offer a distribution deal to the newly formed Led Zeppelin. Zeppelin manager Peter Grant reneged on the handshake deal.

Island Records was also the first distribution home for Trojan Records, Chrysalis Records, Bronze Records, Stiff Records, Virgin Records, ZTT, Gee Street Records and the American Labels Shelter Records whose roster included Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, J.J. Cale and Phoebe Snow and also Sue Records, who produced Jimmy McGriff, The Soul Sisters and Ike and Tina Turner.

==Toots and the Maytals==
Toots and the Maytals introduced the term &quot;reggae&quot; in song with their single &quot;Do the Reggay&quot; (1968). Having signed Bob Marley, Blackwell added Toots and the Maytals to his roster, and had the final word in their lineup. In November 2016, Jackie Jackson described the formation of the group in a radio interview for Kool 97 FM Jamaica. Accompanied by Paul Douglas and Radcliffe &quot;Dougie&quot; Bryan in studio, Jackson explained,

We were talking about reggae is going international now. We kept on meeting and he (Blackwell) decided that the backing band that back all of the songs, the recording band, should be the Maytals band... And then we hit the road in 1975...we were the opening act for the Eagles, Linda Ronstadt, and Jackson Browne. We were the opening act for The Who for about two weeks.

The first Toots and the Maytals album released and distributed by Island Records was &quot;Funky Kingston&quot;. Music critic Lester Bangs described the album in &quot;Stereo Review&quot; as &quot;perfection, the most exciting and diversified set of reggae tunes by a single artist yet released.&quot; As Blackwell says, &quot;Toots and the Maytals were unlike anything else...sensational, raw and dynamic.&quot; Blackwell had a strong commitment to the band, describing Toots Hibbert as &quot;one of the purest human beings I&#x27;ve met in my life, pure almost to a fault.&quot; Blackwell appeared in the 2011 BBC documentary &quot;Reggae Got Soul: The Story of Toots and the Maytals&quot; which told the &quot;untold story of one of the most influential artists ever to come out of Jamaica.&quot;

==Bob Marley==
One of Blackwell&#x27;s achievements was bringing Bob Marley &amp; The Wailers to the attention of international audiences. Without a signed contract, Blackwell advanced money to The Wailers for their first Island album, displaying the trust which stemmed from his 1958 beach rescue by Rastas.

Excerpt from an interview of Winston Grennan by Carter Van Pelt:

Chris Blackwell say, &#x27;Yeah, Yeah, Yeah. I give them the money to make this record.&#x27; But at that time they was forming the band. Bob (Bob Marley) came to me, figure it was me, Gladdy, Winston Wright, Jackie and Hux to be the band. That was the band that Bob did really want, but those guys didn&#x27;t want to get involved. You know that the situation around Bob was pretty hectic...They turned it down. So right away, I couldn&#x27;t get involved, because I didn&#x27;t want to leave the guys...If I leave, I feel it would be a bad vibes.&quot;

Blackwell&#x27;s gesture led to the longterm success of both Marley and the label. Of his experience with Marley, Blackwell has said:

==More reggae, movies, and Compass Point==
Blackwell also pioneered reggae to wider audiences the UK and the US beginning in the mid 1970s with releases from Burning Spear, Augustus Pablo, Inner Circle, Dillinger, Black Uhuru, Third World, Aswad, Max Romeo, Justin Hines, Sly and Robbie and Lee Perry. He also formed Mango Records, which featured Jamaican and other artists from the Third World. Mango introduced Salif Keita, Baaba Maal, Gibson Brothers, Angélique Kidjo, King Sunny Adé and many others.

Eventually, Island moved into movies and released &quot;The Harder They Come&quot; (1972) in the UK, which featured Jimmy Cliff. Produced and directed by fellow Jamaican Perry Henzell, the film marked the first time that Jamaican themes appeared in mainstream cinema. In 1977, Blackwell built Compass Point Studios in Nassau, Bahamas as a recording home for his acts and other artists.

==After Island Records==
Blackwell sold his stake in Island in 1989, eventually resigning from the company in 1997. In 2009, Blackwell was at the centre of celebrations held in London for Island&#x27;s fiftieth anniversary.

Each of Blackwell&#x27;s companies was eventually sold to PolyGram and, in 1999, were part of the Universal Music Group conglomerate, but Blackwell left with a reputation for looking after artists as diverse as Bob Marley, U2, Cat Stevens, Grace Jones, Steve Winwood, Melissa Etheridge, Tom Waits, The Cranberries, Richard Thompson and PJ Harvey.

After selling these companies, Blackwell went on to found Palm Pictures, a media entertainment company with music, film and DVD releases. In the late 1990s, Blackwell merged Palm Pictures with Rykodisc to form RykoPalm, a new operation.

In 2001, Blackwell was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and bestowed the Ahmet Ertegun Award. During his acceptance speech he made a point of thanking Steve Winwood and acknowledged his importance in the development of Island Records. Blackwell said &quot;Steve Winwood was really the cornerstone of Island Records. He’s a musical genius and because he was with Island all the other talent really wanted to be with Island.&quot;

==Other activities==
Blackwell has long owned Goldeneye in Oracabessa, the previous home of Ian Fleming, where the author wrote all the James Bond books. Until his death, Fleming was the longtime lover of Blackwell&#x27;s mother, Blanche. Blackwell developed the property into a community of villas and beach cottages, each with its own private access to the sea, and Goldeneye is considered the most exclusive of the Island Outpost resorts.

Blackwell currently runs Island Outpost, which he set up to operate and market a group of elite resorts in Jamaica, including Strawberry Hill in the Blue Mountains (where Marley recovered after being shot in 1976), The Caves in Negril, and GoldenEye Hotel &amp; Resort in Oracabessa. Island Outpost also owned The Tides and The Marlin in Miami Beach, Florida. The Miami Beach properties including The Tides, The Marlin and The Kent along with several other hotels in Miami Beach and The Bahamas have since been sold.

Blackwell is involved in a number of philanthropic organizations. Among these are Island ACTS, the Oracabessa Foundation, the Oracabessa Bay Fish Sanctuary, the Mary Vinson Blackwell Foundation (established in honour of his late wife to whom he was married from 1998 till 2009), and the Jamaican Conservation Trust.

In 2003, Blackwell launched the Goldeneye Film Festival, which ran for three years. In September that year, Blackwell received the Jamaican Musgrave Medal, which is awarded to Jamaicans who excel in the arts, music and public service. In 2004, the Order of Jamaica was bestowed upon Blackwell for philanthropy and outstanding contribution to the entertainment industry. In April 2009, the UK magazine &quot;Music Week&quot; named Blackwell the most influential UK music executive of the past 50 years.

Blackwell revisited his family&#x27;s legacy in Jamaica&#x27;s banana, coconut, and rum export industries in 2009, when, at the age of 72 years, he introduced his own brand of rum, &quot;Blackwell Black Gold,&quot; onto the market. The beverage is made from Jamaican sugar cane, water and yeast, and aged in American oak barrels. Blackwell also produces a Bond-themed, limited-edition rum, featured in the 2021 film &quot;No Time to Die&quot;. His rum was also featured in the 2023 reality competition show &quot;007: Road to a Million.&quot;

<text>Shanna the She-Devil (Shanna O&#x27;Hara, Lady Plunder) is a jungle adventurer superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Carole Seuling and penciller George Tuska, the character first appeared in &quot;Shanna the She-Devil&quot; #1 (December 1972).

Shanna is depicted as an Irish woman, though she was raised in Zaire by an expatriate father. Following the death of her mother, Shanna migrated to the United States to live with relatives. As an adult, she worked as a veterinarian and a zoologist. She eventually settled in the Savage Land and married the jungle lord Ka-Zar. 

==Publication history==
&quot;Shanna the She-Devil&quot; was introduced in one of a trio of Marvel Comics aimed at a female audience, alongside &quot;Night Nurse&quot; and &quot;Claws of the Cat&quot;. Marvel writer-editor Roy Thomas recalled in 2007 that editor-in-chief Stan Lee:
Seuling in 2010 recalled: &quot;My instructions were to make [Shanna] someone who would fit in with the times and also was prone to a little more violence than Sheena or the other jungle queens of the past&quot;. With veteran penciler George Tuska, she created the lead character and her two leopard companions, as well as game warden and potential romantic interest Patrick McShane, loosely based on after actor Patrick McGoohan&#x27;s game-warden character in the film &quot;Nor the Moon by Night&quot;.

The writer Steve Gerber, in his first assignment for Marvel Comics, supplied additional dialogue for that first issue, as well as the next. Seuling explained:
Steve Gerber did not collaborate with me on the scripts or the origin story, but he added some additional dialogue since Stan [Lee] and Roy [Thomas] thought the stories were a bit light on the talking.

However, ... Steve Gerber was not one of the creators. He provided additional dialogue for the first two [issues] and then took over when I left [after four issues]. ... Gerber himself, before he died a few years ago, denied that he had any part in Shanna&#x27;s origin.
This initial series ran five issues (Dec. 1972 – Aug. 1973), with Jim Steranko drawing the covers of #1–2, John Buscema and Joe Sinnott of issue #3, and John Romita Sr. of the final two issues.

The character went on to a series of guest appearances, first in the jungle lord comic &quot;Ka-Zar&quot; #1 (Jan. 1974); then in a storyline running through the superhero comics &quot;Daredevil&quot; #109–111 (May–July 1974) and &quot;Marvel Two-in-One&quot; #3 (May 1974), which supplied additional details about Shanna&#x27;s past and family, and notes McShane&#x27;s murder by the supervillainess Nekra in the interim; in &quot;Daredevil&quot; #117 (Jan. 1975); and in a Ka-Zar story in the black-and-white, mature-audience comics magazine &quot;Savage Tales&quot; #8 (Jan. 1975).

Shanna then starred in two solo stories in &quot;Savage Tales&quot; #9–10 (March &amp; May 1975) by writer Carla Conway (assisted by then-husband Gerry Conway on the former), with pencil art by, respectively, Tony DeZuniga and Ross Andru. In the first of these two stories, Shanna&#x27;s leopards Ina and Biri are killed. Gerry Conway recalled in 2010 that this &quot;was part of the strategy to make her a stronger, fiercer character in the &quot;Savage Tales&quot; mode. It also raised the stakes for her personally, and by eliminating these &#x27;rivals&#x27; for her affections opened her up to a relationship with Ka-Zar&quot;, whom she would eventually marry, in &quot;Ka-Zar the Savage&quot; #29 (Dec. 1983).

In the meantime, Shanna starred in a backup story in &quot;The Rampaging Hulk&quot; #9 (June 1978), by writer Gerber and artist DeZuniga. She then starred in several eight-page solo stories in the omnibus title &quot;Marvel Comics Presents&quot;, beginning with a tale by writer-artist Bruce Jones in issue #13 (Late Feb. 1989), followed by the 10-part &quot;The Bush of Ghosts&quot;, by writer Gerard Jones and penciler Paul Gulacy in issues #68–77 (Jan.-Late May 1991).

Dovetailing with the end of that run came four full-length stories begun in 1978, completing plot threads from Shanna&#x27;s solo story in &quot;The Rampaging Hulk&quot; #9. Written by Steve Gerber and penciled by Carmine Infantino, Bret Blevins (two stories, the first credited as &quot;A. Novice&quot;) and DeZuniga, these non-chronological, essentially flashback stories ran in &quot;Marvel Fanfare&quot; #56–59 (April–Oct. 1991). The title&#x27;s editor, Al Milgrom, unearthed the unpublished stories because
Marvel has also published alternate universe versions of Shanna, unrelated except for the name.

Shanna was featured in the &quot;Marvel NOW!&quot; book titled &quot;Savage Wolverine&quot;. The new series, written and drawn by Frank Cho, debuted in January 2013. The title is a team-up story with Shanna and Wolverine as they try to survive the Savage Land together.

==Fictional character biography==

Shanna O&#x27;Hara, Lady Plunder is the daughter of an Irish diamond miner named Gerald O&#x27;Hara. Born in Africa, she spent the majority of her childhood growing up in the jungles of Zaire. At the age of six, her father went to kill a rogue leopard that belonged to her mother, Patricia O&#x27;Hara. While hunting for the leopard, Shanna&#x27;s father accidentally killed her mother. This traumatic incident led to Shanna&#x27;s lifelong crusade against the use of firearms. After the incident, Shanna moved to the United States to live with relatives. Shanna grows up to become an accomplished Olympic athlete, specializing in competitive swimming and track and field. She then became a licensed veterinarian.

After completing college, Shanna began to work for the Central Park Municipal Zoo in New York City as a zoologist. While working at the zoo, Shanna raised many animals, including a female leopard named Julani. During this period another shock to her system came when Julani was shot and killed by a zoo guard. The following day, the zoo director proposes Shanna take Julani&#x27;s cubs, Ina and Biri — Yoruba names meaning &quot;bright&quot; and &quot;black&quot;, respectively — to the Dahomey Reserve in Africa.

While in Africa, Shanna becomes more attuned to nature, patrolling the jungle and living freely in the wild lands. She begins to wear Julani&#x27;s fur pelt as a sight-and-sense cue to help with the raising of the cubs. In the jungle, Shanna becomes more and more at home with herself and her new native element, all the while protecting the reserve from poachers as Shanna the She-Devil.

During her stay in Africa, her father is kidnapped by the Mandrill. Shanna searches for him until the wizard Malgato kidnaps her to the Savage Land, a prehistoric jungle within Antarctica. She escapes with the help of Lord Kevin Plunder, a.k.a. the jungle lord Ka-Zar. Shanna returns to Africa to look for her father, and learns he was killed by the Mandrill. Seeking revenge, she goes to North America to aid Daredevil and Black Widow in stopping the Mandrill and Nekra&#x27;s plan to overthrow the American government.

After this, Shanna travels between San Francisco and the Savage Land, finally returning to Africa only to find Ina and Biri have been killed by a cult leader named Raga-Shah. After a short grieving period in North America, Shanna tracks and kills Raga-Shah by feeding him to her python Ananta. Around this time, she begins therapy with psychologist Dr. Dorothy Betz.

Shanna returned to the Savage Land and became Ka-Zar&#x27;s lover. They discovered their lost world was only part of a larger realm, Pangea, filled with wondrous races. The couple&#x27;s relationship was tempestuous: Shanna married Mele of the Botor who died in a hunting accident while with Ka-Zar. Shanna was also targeted by the demonic Belasco (who felt she resembled his lost love Beatrice). When Ka-Zar was seemingly killed while they were in New York, a distraught Shanna rampaged, was institutionalized, and nearly romanced Peter Parker. Shanna was rescued by a revived Ka-Zar, aided by Spider-Man, and the two returned to Antarctica, where they were married despite interference from Belasco and others. They employed the native warrior woman Zhira as nanny and protector of their son Matthew.

They survived the temporary destruction of the Savage Land by Terminus and its later re-creation by the High Evolutionary and Garokk.

Shanna briefly attained a mystical bond to the spirit of Africa, foiling Sir Guy Cross-Wallace who slaughtered and consumed wildlife, seeking the bond himself to rule the continent. Shanna was also briefly given power over the natural world by the High Evolutionary. Together, Ka-Zar and Shanna fight to preserve the Savage Land from external threats and from pollution by technology.

Shanna and Ka-Zar find Skrulls mining the rare metal vibranium in the Savage Land. Soon afterward as part of the &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; storyline, a Skrull ship crashes in the Savage Land, releasing earlier versions of modern superheroes (who claim to be the originals replaced by Skrulls for some time and who have escaped). Shanna and Ka-Zar soon learn, however, that these are simply more Skrulls in disguise. Spider-Man soon encounters Ka-Zar, Shanna, Zabu, and some of the natives accusing them of being Skrulls before Captain America attacked, thinking the same for Spider-Man. Ka-Zar, Shanna, and Zabu help Spider-Man fight until Captain America is hit by a dart that causes the individual to regress to the Skrull Pitt&#x27;o Nili who Shanna then kills. Shanna stays behind with Zabu to fight off any Skrulls left in the Savage Land, while Ka-Zar heads with the New Avengers and the Mighty Avengers to New York to fight the Skrulls.

Ka-Zar and Shanna later encounter the return of the Ethereals and end up fighting them when it comes to the Ethereals wanting the tribes of the Savage Land to be united with them.

As part of the 2012 &quot;Marvel NOW!&quot; branding in the pages of &quot;Savage Wolverine&quot;, Shanna agrees to guide a group of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents to a mysterious island within the Savage Land. A dampening field generator causes the transport to crash, and all the agents are killed by the native Neanderthals. At the same time, Wolverine crashes on the island, and joins with Shanna the She-Devil to destroy the dampening field generator. When Shanna the She-Devil is accidentally killed by the Neanderthals after running into Amadeus Cho, Amadeus and the local Neanderthals perform a ritual that involves a Man-Thing different from Ted Sallis that was rooted in the Savage Land for a long time. A blood sample was taken from it and Shanna was reborn. They then encountered the Hulk where a fight between him, Wolverine, and the giant gorillas accidentally damaged the dampening fields, which freed the alien Morrigon who returns to his master Visher-Rakk.

During the &quot;Empyre&quot; storyline, Shanna the She-Devil falls under the control of the Cotati that were operating in the Savage Land. This was because of Shanna&#x27;s connection with the Savage Land&#x27;s life force and the Cotati took advantage of that. Shanna tries to get Ka-Zar to join them as Matthew states to the Black Knight that they have to do something. Doctor Voodoo used a trick to do a mental trick. The Scarlet Witch does the same as she tries to free Shanna from the Cotati&#x27;s control. To assist her, the Scarlet Witch brings Ka-Zar into Shanna&#x27;s mind, where he learns that some creatures in the Savage Land are dying and trees are falling. As Matthew and the Black Knight fight the Cotati, a Doctor Voodoo-controlled Man-Thing fights the Cotati&#x27;s control and defeats Ventri. When Ka-Zar frees Shanna from the Cotati&#x27;s control, he is stabbed by a Cotati using the Black Knight&#x27;s Ebony Blade. As the Scarlet Witch and Doctor Voodoo work to extract Ka-Zar&#x27;s soul, Shanna the She-Devil uses the same waters that resurrected her in order to revive her lost love. The newly returned Ka-Zar helps turns the tide on the Cotati invaders by working with his wife in summoning dinosaurs to help repel boarders.

==Powers and abilities==
Shanna is gifted with Olympic-class athleticism along with extraordinary agility. She is a well-trained veterinarian, with the capability of being close to wild animals. Shanna is adept at hunting and gathering, healing and tracking. She is an experienced fighter, familiar with knives, spears, bows and arrows and other primitive forms of weapons. She has Olympic athlete-level strength: naturally excelling at swimming, diving, climbing, leaping, and running with great speed and determination.

After her resurrection, Shanna is tied into the life force of the Savage Land, instinctively knowing the languages and history of the Savage Land and its people. Shanna now possesses the strength of 10 men and is able to run over uneven terrain. The She-Devil has a connection with the floral and faunal elements of the natural environment, and is able to discharge energy blasts, bend plant matter to her will and directly communicate with the creatures of the land around her to enlist their aid.

A blonde, alternate-universe version of the character starred in the seven-issue miniseries &quot;Shanna, the She-Devil&quot; (vol. 2) (April–Oct. 2005), written and drawn by Frank Cho. This Shanna is the result of genetic experimentation that endows her with superhuman strength and agility.

The series was published with a &quot;PSR+&quot; rating through issue #4, and a &quot;Parental Advisory&quot; rating afterward.

A four-issue sequel miniseries, &quot;Shanna the She-Devil: Survival of the Fittest&quot; (Oct. 2007 – Jan. 2008) by writers Justin Gray and James Palmiotti and penciller Khari Evans, features this same alternate version of Shanna.

<text>Naparima College (informally known as Naps) is a public secondary school for boys in Trinidad and Tobago. Located in San Fernando, the school was founded in 1894 but received official recognition in 1900. It was established by Dr. Kenneth J. Grant, a Canadian Presbyterian missionary working among the Indian population in Trinidad. The school was one of the first to educate Indo-Trinidadians and played an important and crucial role in the development of an Indo-Trinidadian and Tobagonian professional class. Naparima is derived from the Arawak word (A) naparima, meaning ‘large water’, or from Nabarima, Warao, for ‘Father of the waves.’

The school was founded in the churchyard of Susamachar Presbyterian Church in San Fernando as the &quot;Canadian Mission Indian School&quot;. In 1899, the Mission Council petitioned the Board of Queen&#x27;s Royal College in Port of Spain for affiliation with it. In 1900, the school became a recognised secondary school and was thus eligible for state aid. It was then renamed Naparima College. In 1917 it relocated to its present campus at Paradise Hill on what was then the southern edge of the city.

==History==


*1866 Rev. Dr. John Morton, a young Presbyterian minister from Bridgewater, Nova Scotia arrives in Trinidad and is deeply concerned at the social conditions of the population of 25,000 Indians working on the plantations. Morton receives approval from the Maritime Synod of the Presbyterian church to found a mission to Trinidad. A friend and colleague, Rev.

==Administration==

===Principals===
The following is a chronological list of principals who have served at Naparima College.

===Vice Principals===
The following is a chronological list of vice principals who have served at Naparima College.

==Campus==

Naparima College&#x27;s campus sits atop Paradise Hill, overlooking the city of San Fernando in southern Trinidad. The city&#x27;s major landmark, the San Fernando Hill, towers over the college to the east; to the west is the Gulf of Paria. While the campus location has been the same for decades, there have been numerous infrastructural and developmental changes over the years.
Many of the major changes had arisen out of the demolition of the old wooden buildings, most of which had been around since the first half of the 20th century. Most notably, the college&#x27;s old gymnasium which was demolished in 1995, the Grant Memorial Building in 1999, and the structure referred to as the &quot;main building&quot; in 2005.

The structure that replaced the Grant Memorial Building is referred to as the &quot;Grant&#x27;s Memorial Wing&quot; or the &quot;new Grant building&quot;. Almost twice as large as the old building, it consists of two levels and a basement area (at the western end). It possesses a number of classrooms, Conference, Geography, Business, Language, Art, and Science Demonstration Rooms as well as an &quot;Intelligent Classroom&quot; and Scout Den.

Directly adjacent to the Grant&#x27;s Memorial Wing and connected via a pedestrian bridge is the Science laboratory building. Consisting of two levels, it contains a Chemistry laboratory on the first floor and Biology and Physics laboratories on the second floor.

Neighboring the laboratory building and connected by corridors on the second floor is another section which houses the library. Having undergone various remodeling sessions in the past few years, its design as of 2012 is the most effective for research and study purposes. The availability of its service characteristics means that the library can be considered to be a hybrid of both a reference and a lending library, albeit at a smaller scale for the institution. It has its own library staff, archives, Internet access as well as book rental and (magnetic card based) photocopying services.

Also in the same section, directly beneath the library on the first floor and accessed via corridors, is the Audio/Visual Room (abbreviated as the A/V Room), which is used for displaying media to aid lectures and presentations to an audience, especially by a visiting party. Also located in this section of the building are the offices of the deans of discipline and the dean of studies.

Adjacent to the aforementioned section of the school, but directly joined to it, is an L-shaped building that contains a number or classrooms, an Information Technology Laboratory, storage room (neighboring the cafeteria), Staff Room (for the teaching administration) and the offices of the Principal and Vice-Principal and the Main Office.

The washroom and shower facilities available for the student population and visitors alike are located on the western end of the campus, next to what is the Form 1 and 2 Blocks. These facilities are also located on the first floor of the gymnasium.

The cafeteria (known as The Café) is located on the northernmost sector of the campus. It has been extensively remodeled in the last few years, with its current design covering the largest area since Naparima College was founded.

The main section of the cafeteria, located just under what is now the Form 1S classroom of the Form 1 block, is the main area of business where students and members of the administration can trade. Adjacent to this is the area dubbed the Café Verandah. This area includes seating with tables. Local food merchants are also allowed to market there with permission from the administration. Students may purchase before and after regular school hours and during the luncheon and recess periods. The cafeteria staff reserves the right to bar any student from trading during class hours unless that student is accompanied with a written note provided by a member of the teaching or office administration.

The structure known as the &quot;Principal&#x27;s Residence&quot; is located a stone&#x27;s throw away from the main structure and is out-of-bounds to the student population. It had been an old building which went unused for years until its reconstruction was proposed and eventually completed alongside the gymnasium.

Towards the eastern sector lies the gymnasium which is the most recent addition to the campus (along with the Principal&#x27;s Residence). Whilst overlooking the on-campus playing field, it consists of three levels, the second and third of which serve a dual purpose of hosting indoor sporting events as well as an Auditorium. The first level, which may also be considered as a basement level, facilitates indoor sporting activities, physical training via the use of exercise equipment, as well as bathroom and shower facilities.

There are a number of outdoor facilities normally available for the purposes of recreational and leisure ventures and are scattered in and around the campus.

The college has two outdoor recreational grounds. The main on-campus general playing field is located at the westernmost sector of the school&#x27;s compound, and is available for use by the student population at any time before and after regular class hours. However, most activity occurs during both the recess and luncheon periods. It may also be utilized by students for the purposes of scheduled &quot;Physical Education&quot; lessons. The field also possess its own batting cage for the purposes of cricket practice.

The second and perhaps major playing field is located on the Lewis Street extension, San Fernando and being off campus it is generally out-of-bounds to the student population. It is mainly utilized for larger sporting events such as inter-school sporting competitions or for the events of Sports Day.

The spectator stand on the off-campus playing field which is known as the V.B. Walls Pavilion was constructed by the Naparima College Old Boys Association in 1965. Its name is a dedication to Rev. Dr. Victor B. Walls, a Naparima College principal from 1924 to 1953. It is scheduled for reconstruction.

The courtyard or &quot;quadrangle&quot; is located in what may be considered as the heart of the campus and is bounded by the structure housing the form 4 and 5 blocks to the north, the science laboratory building to the east and Grant&#x27;s Memorial Wing to the south whilst looking over the Gulf of Paria to the west. Within the past few years, the area which was dedicated to the courtyard had dramatically increased. The old wooden structure commonly known as the main building and the structure known as the water bay were situated here but were both demolished in 2005. The courtyard is used by Naparima College as the student assembly grounds and for recreational activity.

Other miscellaneous facilities or features around the campus include:
* A terrace above the scout den, overlooking the Gulf of Paria on the western sector
* Park benches at strategic locations
* Sinks located near Grant&#x27;s Memorial Wing and the Form 1 Block
* A pedestrian shelter located at the entrance to Paradise Hill
* Vehicular parking for administrative staff, visitors and form 6 students

==Form levels==

===Forms 1 – 5 levels===

Each form level from 1 to 5 is usually sub-divided into four Form Classes.
Each class in a form level is given the number of the form level and distinguished from each other by one of four letters – &#x27;N&#x27;, &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;P&#x27; and &#x27;S&#x27; (&quot;Naps&quot; - an abbreviation of &#x27;Naparima College&#x27; used in general references). For instance, at the first form level the classes are Form 1N, 1A, 1P and 1S; with the pattern continuing up each successive form level. Normally each form class contained the same group of students that began together in the first form level, i.e. for example the same students who reside in Form 1N would be promoted to Form 2N. This trend continued until the Fourth Form level where students were separated and grouped into classes based on their choice of CSEC subjects. However, in order to expose students to a greater number of individuals, this trend was changed whereby when progressing up each successive form level at the start of a new academic year, the students groups within each form level are changed that is, students do not progress the form levels with the same group they had started out with in the first form level.

The form classes:
* Form 1 – 1N, 1A, 1P &amp; 1S
* Form 2 – 2N, 2A, 2P &amp; 2S
* Form 3 – 3N, 3A, 3P &amp; 3S
* Form 4 – 4N, 4A, 4P &amp; 4S
* Form 5 – 5N, 5A, 5P &amp; 5S

===Form 6 level===
The form 6 level is usually treated as a separate branch of classes and as such does not conform to the usual class-naming scheme as described above, instead having a unique scheme for both the Upper and Lower 6 classes. The Lower 6 Level is regarded as the level consisting of the younger form 6 students in their first year of CAPE study while the Upper 6 Level is regarded as the older students who are in their second and final year of CAPE study.

Naparima College tends to accept on average, eight external students into the Lower 6th Form Level per year. Usually these students only spend two years at the institution itself.

The Upper 6 students are acknowledged as being in their final year at Naparima College, after having spent seven years (external students spend fewer years) at the institution.

The form classes:

Lower 6 Level:
*6BA
*6BS1
*6BS2
*6BS3

Upper 6 Level:
*6A
*6AS1
*6AS2
*6AS3

The promotion scheme is the same with students being allowed the opportunity of promotion into the appropriate class as shown below.

The 6AS3 form class was officially recognized in September of the academic year spanning 2011–2012.
There are 28 populated form classes at present.

===Admissions===

Admission to Naparima College is determined by performance on an examination, known as the Secondary Entrance Assessment (S.E.A) .Being a Denominational school that was originally founded by Christian missionaries from Canada, the Presbyterian Church in Trinidad and Tobago (PCTT) has the prerogative of selecting 20% of the annual intake of new students into Form 1. This is a practice that is also exercised by all of the other religious organisations in Trinidad and Tobago (e.g. the Roman Catholic Church, the Anglican Church, the Anjuman Sunnat ul Jamaat Association (A.S.J.A.) and the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha (S.D.M.S.)) where they have jurisdiction over secondary schools in this regard and therefore should not be construed as unfair in any way whatsoever. The S.E.A examination comprises three papers that must be attempted by all candidates; Creative Writing, Mathematics and Language Arts.
Naparima College tends to be an institution of first choice of the four prospective institutions each examine is required to list, in preferential order of interest prior to the examination. The four preferences are drawn from the totality of secondary institutions in Trinidad and Tobago. For a candidate to attain admission, he must obtain a percentage of 94–100 after writing the examinations. Female students have not been accepted since 1967 and can instead apply for the Naparima Girls High School.

Certificates and awards for academic achievements in the Caribbean Secondary Education Certificate examinations and Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examinations as well as other academic achievements are distributed to the students at this official ceremony. Teachers, parents, guardians and special guests are normally issued invitations to attend.

==House system==

The House System was instituted in 1959 by then-principal Rev. Lute. Each member of the student population is usually assigned to a particular house during their form 1 year and remain in that house during the rest of their academic career at Naparima College.

The houses usually compete with each other in some aspects of school life, most significantly is that of the annual Sports Day, where each house competes for the top ranking in sporting activities at Naparima College. Initially there were six houses but was then reduced to four.

The four houses are as follows:

* Flemington House (gold) – named for Allen Flemington, who served as a missionary and a French teacher at the school from 1939 to 1940. He left the school to volunteer for service in World War II as a fighter pilot, where he died in combat.
* Grant House (green) – named for the founder of Naparima College, Kenneth J. Grant.
* Sammy House (blue) – named for James Sammy, who taught at Naparima College from 1912 to 1968.He was the father of two other Masters at the college - Carl Sammy, long standing History teacher at Naparima College until his retirement in 2006 and David Sammy, former Vice Principal at Naparima College who later went on to become the Principal of Tableland High School in 2009.
* Walls House (red) – named for long-serving principal, Victor B. Walls.

==Publications==

===The Olympian Magazine===
Naparima College has a school magazine dubbed &quot;The Olympian&quot; which was started in 1945 by Ralph Laltoo. Efforts are made to publish one annually. It usually acts as a yearbook and highlights the events which may have transpired during a particular academic year at Naparima College. These may include academic and sporting achievements as well as brief summaries of extracurricular clubs and activities and special events such as the school bazaar or valedictory functions. Many of these normally being from the perspective of the student population.

===The Naparima College Handbook===

Normally issued to students during their Form 1 year, the Naparima College Handbook outlines the rules of the institution, codes of conduct as well as other information regarding school life.

===Motto===
&quot;A posse ad esse&quot;

This Latin phrase literally translates into English as &quot;From Possibility To Actuality&quot;.

The motto was selected by a contest launched by Rev. Dr. Victor B. Walls among the staff and students shortly after his arrival in 1923. The identity of the person who coined the motto remains a mystery. The motto serves as a force to encourage students to strive to be the best that they can be in all aspects of school life and in their other achievements. It is inscribed on the school&#x27;s insignia.

===Rationale===

Naparima College, the pioneer secondary school in San Fernando, was founded in 1894 by the Canadian Presbyterian Missionaries to spread education and civilisation amongst the depressed indentured immigrant population.

===College Hymn or College Anthem===
This college hymn was written around 1930 by Marion Elizabeth Walls, the wife of Reverend Victor Benjamin Walls. The melody is that of a well-known 18th-century evangelical hymn, recorded in the Anglican and Presbyterian hymn-books, and known variously as The Church of God, Thou whose Almighty Word, and Come, thou Almighty King.

<text>Sergey Ivanovich Taneyev (, ; – ) was a Russian composer, pianist, teacher of composition, music theorist and author.

==Life==
Taneyev was born in Vladimir, Vladimir Governorate, Russian Empire, to a cultured and literary family of Russian nobility. A distant cousin, Alexander Taneyev, was also a composer, whose daughter, Anna Vyrubova, was highly influential at court. Alexander was drawn closely to the nationalist school of music exemplified by The Five, while Sergei would gravitate toward a more cosmopolitan outlook, as did Tchaikovsky.

He began taking piano lessons at the age of five with a private teacher. His family moved to Moscow in 1865. The following year, the nine-year-old Taneyev entered the Moscow Conservatory. His first piano teacher at the Conservatory was Edward Langer. After a year&#x27;s interruption in his studies, Taneyev studied again with Langer. He also joined the theory class of Nikolai Hubert and, most importantly, the composition class of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. In 1871, Taneyev studied piano with the Conservatory&#x27;s founder, Nikolai Rubinstein.

Taneyev graduated in 1875, the first student in the history of the Conservatory to win the gold medal both for composition and for performing (piano). He was also the first person to be awarded the Conservatory&#x27;s Great Gold Medal. That summer he travelled abroad with Rubinstein. That year he also made his debut as a concert pianist in Moscow playing Brahms&#x27;s First Piano Concerto, and would become known for his interpretations of Bach, Mozart and Beethoven. In March 1876 he toured Russia with violinist Leopold Auer.

Taneyev was also the soloist at the Moscow première of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s First Piano Concerto in December 1875. He was chosen after Gustav Kross had given a dreadful performance at the concerto&#x27;s Russian première in St Petersburg three weeks earlier. The conductor on the later occasion was Nikolai Rubinstein, who had famously lambasted the work less than a year earlier (5 January), but who had by that time come to appreciate its merits. Tchaikovsky was clearly impressed by Taneyev&#x27;s performance; he later asked Taneyev to be soloist in the Russian première of his Second Piano Concerto and of his Piano Trio in A minor. After Tchaikovsky&#x27;s death, Taneyev edited sketches by Tchaikovsky that he completed with an &quot;Andante and Finale&quot; and were premièred as a Tchaikovsky Third Piano Concerto.

Taneyev attended Moscow University for a short time and was acquainted with outstanding Russian writers, including Ivan Turgenev and Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin. During his travels in Western Europe in 1876 and 1877, he met Émile Zola, Gustave Flaubert, César Franck, and Camille Saint-Saëns, amongst others.

When Tchaikovsky resigned from the Moscow Conservatory in 1878, Taneyev was appointed to teach harmony. He would later also teach piano and composition. He served as Director from 1885 to 1889, and continued teaching until 1905. He had great influence as a teacher of composition. His pupils included Alexander Scriabin, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Jacob Weinberg, Reinhold Glière, Paul Juon, Julius Conus, and Nikolai Medtner. The polyphonic interweaves in the music of Rachmaninoff and Medtner stem directly from Taneyev&#x27;s teaching. Scriabin, on the other hand, broke away from Taneyev&#x27;s influence.

Taneyev was also a scholar of notable erudition. In addition to music, he studied—for relaxation—natural and social science, history, mathematics, plus the philosophies of Plato and Spinoza.

During the summers of 1895 and 1896, Taneyev stayed at Yasnaya Polyana, the home of Leo Tolstoy and his wife Sofia. The latter developed an attachment to the composer that embarrassed her children and made Tolstoy jealous, although Taneyev himself remained unaware of it.

In 1905, revolution and its consequent effect on the Moscow Conservatory led Taneyev to resign from the staff there. He resumed his career as a concert pianist, both as soloist and chamber musician. He was also able to pursue composition more intensely, completing chamber works with a piano part which he could play in concerts as well as some choruses and a substantial number of songs. His last completed work was the cantata &quot;At the Reading of a Psalm&quot;, completed at the beginning of 1915.

Taneyev contracted pneumonia after attending the funeral of Scriabin, in Moscow, on 16 April 1915. While he was recovering, he succumbed to a heart attack in , near Zvenigorod.

A museum dedicated to Taneyev is located in Dyudkovo. There is also a section dedicated to Taneyev at the Tchaikovsky Museum in Klin.

==Taneyev and Tchaikovsky==
Taneyev became the most trusted musician among Tchaikovsky&#x27;s friends. The two developed a romantic relationship that would last until Tchaikovsky&#x27;s death. The symphonic poem &quot;Francesca da Rimini&quot;, Op. 32, one of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s most famous orchestral works, is dedicated to Taneyev.

Taneyev was a fastidious and diligent craftsman with an unrivaled technique. Tchaikovsky realized that the opinions of such a man, whose own taste and competence were so high, yet whose self-scrutiny was so exacting, were to be respected, and in consequence came greatly to appreciate criticism from Taneyev. In fact, Taneyev became the only one of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s friends encouraged by the composer to be absolutely frank about his works.

Taneyev&#x27;s frankness came at a price, however, and that price for Tchaikovsky was forbearance in the face of a forthrightness that frequently reached the point of absolute bluntness. This meant that, while Tchaikovsky appreciated Taneyev&#x27;s views and welcomed them, he did not always like them. The postscript to a letter Tchaikovsky wrote to Taneyev about &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot; and the Fourth Symphony sums up his general frame of mind: &quot;I know you are absolutely sincere and I think a great deal of your judgment. But I also fear it.&quot;

Tchaikovsky&#x27;s use of the word &quot;fear&quot; was not exaggerated. The music writer and composer Leonid Sabaneyev studied composition with Taneyev as a child and met Tchaikovsky through him. To Sabaneyev, Tchaikovsky really did seem afraid of Taneyev in some ways. He also suggests why:

I think he was unnerved by the overt frankness with which Taneyev reacted to Tchaikovsky&#x27;s works: Taneyev believed that one must indicate precisely what one finds to be &#x27;faults,&#x27; while strong points would make themselves evident. He was hardly fully justified in his conviction: composers are a nervous lot and they are often particularly dissatisfied with themselves. Tchaikovsky was just such a person: he worried himself almost sick over each work and often tried even to destroy them...

Sabaneyev recalled Tchaikovsky&#x27;s coming to Taneyev with his Fifth Symphony. Taneyev started playing through part of the manuscript at the piano. &quot;With characteristic pedantry Taneyev began showing Tchaikovsky what he considered to be faults, thereby sending Tchaikovsky into even greater despair. Tchaikovsky grabbed the music and wrote across the page with a red pencil: &quot;Awful muck.&quot; Still not satisfied with this punishment, he tore the sheet of music in half and threw it on the floor. Then he ran out of the room. Despondently Taneyev picked up the music and told me: &quot;Pyotr Ilyich takes everything to heart. After all, he himself asked me to give my opinion...&quot;

Despite Tchaikovsky&#x27;s notoriously thin skin when it came to criticism, he could not take any lasting offense at such transparent honesty, especially when Taneyev&#x27;s assessments could show a great deal of perception. Even if the manner in which Taneyev presented his comments made them sting all the more, Tchaikovsky was painfully grateful for his fellow-musician&#x27;s candor.

Soon after Tchaikovsky completed his ballet &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;, Taneyev made a piano transcription of the entire work. On finishing his transcription, he gave it to Tchaikovsky, who then made his own alterations to it. (This transcription was published in 1892.)

==Taneyev and The Five==
Tchaikovsky was not the only one with whom Taneyev was frank, though some were less appreciative of it. Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, recalling a clash Taneyev had with Mily Balakirev during a rehearsal of a concert to commemorate the unveiling of a monument to the pioneering Russian composer Mikhail Glinka, wrote:

&quot;At the rehearsal of the concert he publicly declared to Balakirev: &#x27;Mily Alekseyevich! We are dissatisfied with you.&#x27; I picture to myself Balakirev constrained to swallow a rebuke of this sort. Honest, upright and straightforward, Taneyev always spoke sharply and frankly. On the other hand, Balakirev, of course, could never forgive Taneyev his harshness and frankness with regard to his own person.&quot;

Nor was this the only time Taneyev shared strong opinions about the St Petersburg based nationalist music group known as &quot;The Mighty Handful&quot; or &quot;The Five.&quot; Rimsky-Korsakov recalls what he considered Taneyev&#x27;s glaring conservatism in the 1880s. Taneyev reportedly showed &quot;deep distrust&quot; in Alexander Glazunov&#x27;s early appearances. Alexander Borodin was merely a clever dilettante, and Modest Mussorgsky &quot;had made him laugh&quot;. He may not have had a high opinion of César Cui or even of Rimsky-Korsakov himself. However, Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s study of counterpoint, which Taneyev learned of from Tchaikovsky, may have prompted Taneyev to revise his opinion of that composer.

The following decade showed a marked change in opinion, Rimsky-Korsakov writes. Taneyev now appreciated Glazunov, respected Borodin&#x27;s work, and regarded only Mussorgsky&#x27;s compositions with disdain. Rimsky-Korsakov ascribed this change to a new period in Taneyev&#x27;s activity as a composer. Previously he had been absorbed mainly in research for his treatise on counterpoint, which left him little time for composition. Now he was throwing himself more freely into creative work. In doing so, Taneyev was allowing himself to be guided by the ideals of contemporary music while still preserving &quot;his astounding contrapuntal technique&quot;.

Rimsky-Korsakov also writes that, after the fiasco regarding the Mariinsky Theatre&#x27;s production of Taneyev&#x27;s &quot;Oresteia&quot;, Mitrofan Belyayev, the publisher and impresario who now headed the &quot;Mighty Handful&quot;, shared Taneyev&#x27;s outrage over the incident and volunteered to publish the score himself. Prior to its publication, Taneyev &quot;revised and signally improved the orchestration, which had not been uniformly satisfactorily... [T]hereafter, Taneyev began to avail himself of Glazunov&#x27;s advice in orchestration; of course he made rapid strides in that field&quot;. Note the &quot;of course&quot;. Glazunov had been Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s student in orchestration as well as composition.

==Master contrapuntalist==
Taneyev&#x27;s specialized field of study was counterpoint. He engrossed himself in the music of J. S. Bach, Palestrina, and such Flemish masters as Johannes Ockeghem, Josquin des Prez, and Orlande de Lassus. Eventually, he became one of the greatest of contrapuntalists.

Taneyev published a gigantic two-volume treatise, &quot;Moveable Counterpoint in the Strict Style&quot; (however, in the 1962 english edition this term appears as &quot;convertible counterpoint&quot;), the result of 20 years of labor. In it, the laws of counterpoint are broken down, explained, and brought into focus as a branch of pure mathematics. Taneyev used a quotation from Leonardo da Vinci as its inscription: &quot;No branch of study can claim to be considered a true science unless it is capable of being demonstrated mathematically&quot;.

An unfinished sequel on Canon and Fugue was published posthumously. During the 20th century, several books were published, which deal with either theoretical or pedagogical issues related to his theory.

Taneyev&#x27;s focus on strict counterpoint strongly influenced the way he composed his music. He described this process, while discussing his dramatic trilogy &quot;Oresteia&quot;, in a letter to Tchaikovsky dated 21 June 1891:

I spend a great deal of time on preparatory work, and less time on final composition. Some items I have not finished within the last few years. Important themes which are repeated in the opera, are used by me objectively, without any reference to a particular situation, for studies in counterpoint. Gradually, from this chaos of thoughts and sketches something orderly and definite begins to emerge. Everything extraneous is discarded. That which is unquestionably suitable remains.

Taneyev would continue this series of contrapuntal exercises until he had exhausted every polyphonic possibility. Only then would he actually begin composing music.

Rimsky-Korsakov described Taneyev&#x27;s compositional process similarly, but with more telling detail:

Before setting out for the real expounding of a composition, Taneyev used to precede it with a multitude of sketches and studies: he used to write fugues, canons, and various contrapuntal interlacings on the individual themes, phrases, and motives of the coming composition; and only after gaining thorough experience in its component parts did he take up the general plan of the composition and the carrying out of this plan, knowing by that time, as he did, and perfectly, the nature of the material he had at his disposal and the possibilities of building with that material.

Taneyev&#x27;s rationale for this process stemmed from his belief that truth and moral integrity in music were synonymous with its objectivity and purpose. He viewed classical concepts of composition as perfect examples of a compositional technique devoid of anything casual or extraneous.

Taneyev also saw a synthesis of counterpoint and folk-song as the means of creating large-scale musical structures that would follow Western rules of thematic development in sonata form. This goal had eluded both &quot;The Five&quot; and Tchaikovsky. Taneyev wrote:

The task of every Russian composer consists in furthering the creation of national music. The history of western music gives us the answer as to what should be done to attain this: apply to the Russian song the workings of the mind that were applied to the song of western nations and we will have our own national music. Begin with elementary contrapuntal forms, pass to more complex ones, elaborate the form of the Russian fugue, and from there it is only a step to complex instrumental types. The Europeans took centuries to get there, we need far less. We know the way, the goal, we can profit by their experience.

==Music==

Compositionally, Taneyev and Tchaikovsky differed on how they felt music theory should function. Tchaikovsky prized spontaneity in musical creativity. Taneyev, in contrast, thought musical creativity should be both deliberate and intellectual, with preliminary theoretical analysis and preparation of thematic materials.

As a consequence Taneyev took an intellectual approach in his characterization of the music of his teacher, Tchaikovsky. Nevertheless, Taneyev&#x27;s compositions reveal his mastery of classical composition technique, so that his style could be said to reflect the European, and especially German, orientation of the Moscow Conservatory, rather than the Russian nationalist outlook of the school of Mily Balakirev.

His compositions include nine complete string quartets (plus two partially completed), a piano quintet, two string quintets and other chamber works, including a piano prelude and fugue in G-sharp minor; four symphonies (only the last one published during his lifetime, and at least one incomplete), a concert suite with violin and a piano concerto, and other orchestral works; an organ composition &quot;Chorale with variations&quot;; choral and vocal music. Among the choral works are two cantatas, St. John of Damascus, Op. 1 (also known as &quot;A Russian Requiem&quot;), and At the Reading of a Psalm (Op. 36, sometimes regarded as his swan song). In his choral works the composer combines the melodic basis of the traditional Russian musical style with remarkable contrapuntal writing.

Taneyev regarded his &quot;Oresteia&quot;, originally conceived in 1882, as his major achievement. This work, which the composer entitled a &#x27;musical trilogy&#x27; rather than an opera, was closely modeled on the original plays of Aeschylus and was first performed at the Mariinsky Theatre on 17 October 1895. Taneyev wrote a separate concert overture, based on some of the opera&#x27;s major themes, which was conducted by Tchaikovsky in 1889.

Rimsky-Korsakov considered many of Taneyev&#x27;s compositions to be &quot;most dry and laboured in character.&quot; A private hearing of &quot;Oresteia&quot; at his home, with Taneyev at the piano, was quite another matter. The opera, he writes, &quot;astonished us all with pages of extraordinary beauty and expressiveness&quot;. He added that Taneyev&#x27;s working methods &quot;ought to result in a dry and academic composition, devoid of the shadow of an inspiration; in reality, however, &quot;Oresteia&quot; proved quite the reverse—for all its strict premeditation, the opera was striking in its wealth of beauty and expressiveness.&quot;

Along with beauty and expressiveness, Taneyev&#x27;s music could also show a whimsical streak. Gerald Abraham writes, &quot;Taneyev had a dual nature rather like Lewis Carroll&#x27;s, half mathematician, half humorist&quot;. Among Taneyev&#x27;s unpublished works are reportedly various parodies, including &quot;Quartets of Government Officials&quot;, &quot;humorous choruses, comic fugues and variations, toy symphonies, a mock ballet for Tchaikovsky&#x27;s birthday with an absurd scenario, and music which is an ingenious contrapuntal pot-pourri of themes from Tchaikovsky&#x27;s works&quot;.
